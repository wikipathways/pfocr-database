caption: Binding of VIP to VPAC receptors (i) activates adenylyl cyclase–mediated
  (AC-mediated) elevation of [cAMP]i, causing PKA-stimulated elevation of [Ca2+]i
  required for activation of basolateral K+ channels (ii). This [Ca2+]iresponse is
  insufficient to activate CaCCs (iii). Thus, Cl– secretion requires PKA-dependent
  activation of CFTR (iv). As during cholinergic stimulation, transepithelial Cl–
  secretion is sustained by NKCC1 (v) and NHE/AE (vi), expressed on the basolateral
  membrane () and driven by Na+ gradient established by the Na+/K+ ATPase (vii). While
  AE function was not elucidated directly in this study, canonical models of epithelial
  Cl– secretion (reviewed in ref. ) dictate that NHE-mediated alkalinization drives
  Cl–/HCO3– exchange resulting in Cl– uptake to sustain secretion. Secretion of Cl–
  drives movement of Na+ through a paracellular (tight junction; T.J.) pathway (viii)
  drawing osmotically obliged water into the gland lumen (ix) paracellularly or transcellularly
  through aquaporins (AQP; localization based on ref. ). Our data suggest that activation
  of CaCC(s), either directly or indirectly through agents that enhance cAMP-activated
  [Ca2+]i signals, could restore fluid secretion in serous cells lacking functional
  CFTR.
