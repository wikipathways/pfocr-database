caption: An anti-inflammatory effect is exerted by LIPUS by increasing miR-16 and
  miR-21 in exosomes. LIPUS increases miRNA-16 and miRNA-21 in exosomes derived from
  BMDCs. Human umbilical vein cultured endothelial cells preincubated with exosomes
  from LIPUS-treated BMDCs express less ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and have lower activity
  of NF-κB signaling in response to TNF-α. miRNA-16 inhibitsthe activity of the NF-κB
  signaling pathway by suppressing the expression of IκB kinase, and miRNA-21 limits
  the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory
  factor. BMDCs, bone marrow dendritic cells; LIPUS, low intensity pulsed ultrasound;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; IKK, inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase; IκBα, inhibitor
  of nuclear factor κBα; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; ICAM-1, intercellular
  adhesion molecule-1.
