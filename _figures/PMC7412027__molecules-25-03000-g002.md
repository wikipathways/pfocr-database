caption: Biosynthetic pathways of isoprene units such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate
  (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). Mevalonate pathway, Methylerythritol
  4-phosphate and Taxol biosynthesis from the isoprene units. Biosynthesis of terpenoids
  in fungi. Mevalonate and isoprenoids pathways are the main sources of isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethyl allyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) (isoprene units, C5).
  Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is the precursors of diterpenoids (Taxol, C20) by condensation
  reactions catalyzed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS). Abbreviations
  of enzymes; GPPS, geranyl pyrophosphate synthase; FPPS, Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase;
  GGPPS, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase; TS, taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene synthase;
  DAPT, baccatin III -13-O-(3-phenylpyropanyoyl) transferase (DAPT).
