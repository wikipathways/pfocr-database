caption: Amplification of HER2 is observed in 25 to 30% of breast cancer patients
  which can result in activation of both the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Raf/MEK/ERK cascades.
  Ras is mutated in approximately 35% of human cancers. B-Raf and Raf-1 are also mutated
  in certain human cancers. The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway is also activated in breast
  cancer due to mutations at PI3K, PTEN and Akt as well as mutations at upstream receptors.
  Abnormal Akt activation is associated with a poorer prognosis for breast cancer
  and resistance to chemo-hormonal therapy.
