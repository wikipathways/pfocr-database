caption: 'Triacylglycerol (TAG) lipolysis in Drosophila: biochemistry and main regulatory
  pathways. Mobilization of lipid droplet (LD) fat stores in adipocytes requires TAG
  hydrolysis by Bmm and Hsl [possibly also by PAPLA1 (Phosphatidic Acid Phospholipase
  A1)] to fatty acids (FAs) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which become exported to peripheral
  tissues, or are subjected to further lipolytic cleavage (possibly by Hsl) to release
  glycerol (G) and FAs. The latter can be catabolized via β-oxidation after activation
  to FA-CoA by Pdgy. LD coat proteins Plin1 and Plin2 restrict Bmm activity. Plin1
  phosphorylation by protein kinase A (Pka) may also promote adipokinetic hormone
  (Akh)-stimulated TAG mobilization by facilitating the activity of Hsl and/or other
  currently unknown lipases. Transcription of bmm is under antagonistic control of
  the Akh pathway during fasting and under the insulin signaling pathway during feeding
  conditions. Insulin signaling operates via activation of Akt, which represses bmm
  expression by promoting phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of the transcription
  factor Foxo. In parallel, Akt activates Sik3, which promotes the phosphorylation
  and cytoplasmic retention of the Foxo-activator HDAC4. Target of rapamycin (Tor)
  kinase, which is positively regulated by insulin signaling, represses bmm transcript
  levels by a currently unknown mechanism. The insulin and Akh pathways converge at
  Sik3, which is suppressed by Pka. Pka, in turn, depends on the cyclic AMP (cAMP)
  branch of Akh/AkhR (Akh receptor) signaling, which operates via Gs and adenylate
  cyclase (Ac). Lipolysis also involves the Ca2+ branch of AkhR activation (for details
  see  legend and main text). Genetic data support the idea that proteins such as
  Cam relay the rise in intracellular Ca2+, resulting in bmm expression by unknown
  mechanisms. Proteins shown in faded green with gray lettering are based on homology-based
  activity predictions and await experimental validation. See main text for definitions
  of protein name abbreviations. Note the antagonistic action of the lipoanabolic
  insulin/Tor pathway (in magenta) under feeding vs. the lipocatabolic Akh pathway
  (in blue) under fasting conditions.'
