caption: MIIP competing with Rac1-GTP to bind the PAK1-binding domain. The results
  of our studies provide evidence that MIIP inhibited EC migration through reducing
  the formation of lamellipodia. MIIP may block Rac1 signaling pathway through competing
  binding to Rac1’s downstream effector PAK1, which resulted in decreasing formation
  of lamellipodia and then inhibiting EC cell migration
