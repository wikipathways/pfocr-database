caption: The Immune Deficiency (IMD) pathway responds to DAP-type peptidoglycan (DAP-PGN)
  from mostly Gram-negative bacteria. DAP-type PGNs are recognized by transmembrane
  peptidoglycan-recognition proteins (PGRPs), leading to the translocation of the
  nuclear factor (NF)-κB-like factor, Relish, to the nucleus and upregulation of antimicrobial
  peptides (AMPs) []. AMPs are small cationic, amphipathic peptides that kill invading
  microbes by disrupting the pathogen membrane []. The Toll pathway responds to lysine-type
  peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria and β-glucans from fungi. Recognition
  leads to a proteolytic cascade that cleaves the endogenous cytokine-like protein,
  Spätzle (Sptz). Spätzle binds to the Toll receptor, causing the translocation of
  NF-κB-like factor Dorsal (or Dif) to the nucleus and the expression of AMPs [].
  The janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway
  responds to the endogenous cytokine unpaired (Upd) that is secreted by hemocytes
  in response to infection. Binding of unpaired to the Dome receptor leads to dimerization
  and translocation of STAT to the nucleus and production of AMPs []. The RNA interference
  (RNAi) pathway recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) derived from invading viruses.
  dsRNA is cleaved by Dicer and then loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex
  (RISC). The small interfering (siRNA)-RISC complex induces an anti-viral state by
  binding to complementary RNAs through base-pairing, causing cleavage and degradation
  of viral RNA [, ]. Excellent reviews discuss these mechanistic processes elsewhere
  [, , , , ].
