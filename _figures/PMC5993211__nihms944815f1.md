caption: In the early phase, viral nucleic acids are recognized by toll-like receptors
  (TLR) on the plasma and endosomal membranes receptors or within the cytoplasm by
  melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), retinoic-acid-inducible gene
  I (RIG-I), DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI), DDX41, interferon
  (IFN)-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 6 (IFIT6), cyclic GMP-AMP synthase
  (cGAS), DexH-box helicase 9 (DHX9), DHX36 or TNFα receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3).
  Signaling from TLR2, DHX9, and DHX36 goes through myeloid differentiation primary
  response gene 88 (Myd88) which stimulates phosphorylated IFN-regulatory factor 7
  (IRF7) to homodimerize and enter the nucleus to increase the transcription of IFNα.
  Signaling from the endosomal TLRs can also stimulate phosphorylated IRF7 homodimerization,
  while an alternative signaling pathway is through the TANK binding kinase-1 (TBK1)
  and IκB kinase ε (IKKε) complex, which stimulates phosphorylated IRF3 homodimerization
  to induce the transcription of IFNβ. TLR3 can also signal through TRAF3, which induces
  the phosphorylation of IRF3 via the TBK1 and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) complex.
  The TBK1 and IKKε complex is also formed in response to genomic DNA binding to DAI,
  DDX41, IFIT6 and cGAS via STING, which is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.
  During the replication of genomic DNA, RNA polymerase III forms single stranded
  RNA replicates that can be detected by MDA5 or RIG-I. MDA5 and RIG-I also sense
  viral dsRNA and ssRNA and then bind to mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein
  (MAVS), associated with the mitochondrial membrane, to stimulate the formation of
  the TBK1 and IKKe complex or MAVS binding stimulates IRF1 to translocate to the
  nucleus and induce the transcription of IFNλ. In the late phase, the cytokine interleukin-27
  (IL-27) binds to its transmembrane plasma receptor composed of interleukin 27 receptor
  A (IL27RA) and glycoprotein 130 (gp130) stimulating the transcription of oligoadenylate
  synthetase 2 (OAS2) in an IFN-independent manner. An alternative signal to induce
  OAS2 independent of IFNs occurs via IRF3. Type II IFNs bind to their receptor consisting
  of IFNγ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) and IFNGR2; each subunit is associated with janus kinase
  2 (JAK2) on the cytoplasmic domain. This activates signal transducers and activators
  of transcription 1 (STAT1) to become phosphorylated and homodimerize forming IFNγ
  activation factor (GAF). GAF then translocates to the nucleus and binds to GAF site
  within the promoter region of target genes to induce the transcription of IRF1,
  IRF2, IRF8, and IRF9. Type I IFNs bind to their receptor composed of IFNα receptor
  1 (IFNAR1) associated with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and IFNAR2 associated
  with cytoplasmic JAK1. Type III IFNs bind to their receptor composed of interleukin
  10 receptor 2 (IL10R2) associated with cytoplasmic TYK2 and IFNλ receptor 1 (IFNLR1)
  associated with cytoplasmic JAK1. Both type I and III IFNs binding to their respective
  receptors leads to the formation of the phosphorylated STAT1 and phosphorylated
  STAT2 heterodimer complex which then conjugates with IRF9 to form the IFN-stimulated
  gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. ISGF3 then translocates to the nucleus and binds
  to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) site within the promoter region of
  target genes to induce the transcription of OAS1, IFIT1, myxovirus-resistance A
  (MxA), IRF7, IFIT3, IFIT2, interferon-stimulated protein of 15kDa (ISG15), and protein
  kinase R (PKR).
