caption: The mechanism of SCFAs madiate a decrease in cholesterol levels. (a) SCFAs
  down-regulate gene expression in the cholesterol synthesis pathway through SREBP-1.
  (b) SCFAs promote the conversion of cholesterol into BAs by upregulating the expression
  of CYP7A1, thereby reducing cholesterol levels. (c) SCFAs accelerate cholesterol
  export and transport cholesterol out of the Kupffer cell in the NAFLD by regulating
  ApoA-I to affect ABCA1. (d) NPC1L1 abundantly expresses in the duodenum and mediates
  cholesterol absorption, while ABCG5/8 forms heterodimers, leading to cholesterol
  efflux. SCFAs downregulate NPC1L1 expression and upregulate ABCG5/8 expression,
  thereby reducing cholesterol levels. (e) SCFAs act on GPR43 to stimulate leptin
  production and inhibit SREBP-1 expression, thereby down-regulating cholesterol levels.
