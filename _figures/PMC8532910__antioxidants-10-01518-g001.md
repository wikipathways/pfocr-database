caption: 'Mechanisms of RIP1-dependent necroptosis and apoptosis. The RIP1-dependent
  cell death in the classical way can be induced via activation of the death receptor
  pathway. In the first step, TNFα or FasL, via binding to the respective receptor
  (TNFR1 or Fas), triggers complex I assembly (TNFR1, TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, cIAPs and
  CYLD). Under unavailability of TRADD or cIAPs, complex II b is formed (RIP1, RIP3,
  FADD and caspase 8), which induces RIP1-dependent apoptosis. Another scenario is
  initiated when caspase-8 or FADD are deficient then complex II c (necrosome) built
  from RIP1-RIP3 is formed. Subsequently, it phosphorylates and recruits MLKL, which
  oligomerize in plasma or other intracellular organs (mitochondria, ER, lysosomes)
  membranes, leading to their damage and cell death via necroptosis. Moreover, plasma
  membrane perforation evokes the release of DAMPs, which induces inflammatory response
  in surrounding tissue. Among other inducers of necroptosis, the following can be
  listed: LPS, TLRs, ROS, DNA damage, excitotoxicity and calcium overload. Beyond
  MLKL, among other postulated executioners of necroptosis, ROS, AIF, Drp-1, JNK,
  p38, ERK1/2, calpains and lysosome enzymes can be mentioned. Abbreviations: AIF—Apoptosis-Inducing
