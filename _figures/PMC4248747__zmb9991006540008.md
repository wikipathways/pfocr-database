caption: Proposed model for the control of β-catenin stability by RNF220/USP7. In
  the absence of the Wnt ligand (left panel), both β-catenin and RNF220 are recruited
  to the Gsk3β/axin/APC destruction complex, phosphorylated, and degraded through
  the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Whether Gsk3β directly phosphorylates RNF220 remains
  to be determined, and the ubiquitin ligase for RNF220 in this process is unknown.
  In the presence of the Wnt ligand (right panel), the destruction complex dissociates,
  β-catenin and RNF220 are both stabilized, and RNF220 works with USP7 to deubiquitinate
  β-catenin, further increasing its protein level and signaling activity.
