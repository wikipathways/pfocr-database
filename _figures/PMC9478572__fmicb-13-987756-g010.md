caption: 'Proposed model on the effects of mliR deletion on iron homeostasis and the
  adaptive responses to intracellular metal deficiency in B. argentinensis JUB59.
  Upper panel: the main components of the iron uptake system, the electron transport
  chain and relevant metabolic pathways are illustrated. Light gray components indicated
  in red text are downregulated in mliR-deletion mutant. Metabolites highlighted in
  red and small text are decreased in mliR-deletion mutant with respect to WT strain.
  Metabolites highlighted in purple and big text are augmented in mliR-deletion mutant
  with respect to WT strain. See text for more details. Lower panel: schematic representation
  of the biosynthetic pathway of LPS. The lipid component of Lipid A (orange), N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
  phosphate (light blue), KDO, 3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (purple) and the core
  oligosaccharide (green) are represented. KdsA, Kdo-8-P synthase; OM, outer membrane.
  See text for more details.'
