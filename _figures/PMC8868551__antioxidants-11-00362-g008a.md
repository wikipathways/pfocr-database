caption: (A) BD in adolescence increases the hepatic production of ROS and RNS, causing
  oxidative and nitrosative stress leading to apoptosis. BD stimulates the pro-oxidant
  enzymes CYP2E1 and NOX1, increasing cytosolic ROS generation, and NOX4 activity,
  increasing ROS mitochondrial generation and cytochrome C expulsion, contributing
  to apoptosis. BD affects the antioxidant enzymatic defense system, increasing SOD
  and CAT activities and decreasing GPx activity, but lipid and protein oxidation
  appears. BD affects the methionine cycle and the transsulfuration pathway, leading
  to depletion in GSH levels and HHcy. BD reduces the expression of DHFR, decreasing
  the cofactor BH4 and increasing the uncoupled form of eNOS, producing RNS and protein
  nitration. BD also leads to a hepatic depletion of FA, which could be implicated
  in all these actions. (B) FA antioxidant pathways against hepatic oxidation induced
  by BD in adolescence. FA supplementation to BD rats manages to reduce the oxidation
  of lipids and proteins, as well as protein nitration and apoptosis. It decreases
  the expression of the pro-oxidant enzymes NOX1 and NOX4, avoiding ROS generation
  and apoptosis. FA restores the balance of the antioxidant enzymatic defense system.
  Due to its participation in the methionine cycle and the transsulfuration pathway,
  it increases the levels of the antioxidant GSH and decreases the pro-oxidant Hcy.
  FA also increases the expression of DHFR and BH4 viability, increasing the stability
  of coupled eNOS, avoiding RNS generation and nitrosative damage.
