caption: Main Ca2+ influx pathways regulating Ca2+-sparks in young and aged mesenteric
  vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Opening of clustered RyRs in the SR produces
  Ca2+-sparks that activate BKCa channels providing a negative feedback effect on
  vasoconstriction. CaV1.2 L-type channels contribute to global cytosolic [Ca2+],
  thereby influencing luminal SR calcium (via SERCA) and generating the majority (75%)
  of Ca2+-sparks. Caveolae position CaV3.2 T-type channels close to RyRs for extracellular
  Ca2+-influx to trigger (~25%) Ca2+-sparks. In aged mice VSMCs, this CaV3.2-RyR pathway
  is lost. Instead, a gadolinium-sensitive Ca2+-influx pathway triggering (20%) Ca2+-sparks
  is upregulated. Nonselective TRP channels might be involved in this pathway. BKCa,
  Ca2+-activated K+ channels; RyR2, ryanodine receptor subtype 2; SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic
  calcium pump; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum.
