caption: Possible molecular mechanisms of cellular senescence in skeletal muscle cells.
  The cell-cycle exit is mainly regulated by induction of cyclin-dependent kinase
  (CDK) inhibitors including p53–p21Cip, p16Ink4a/p15Ink4b, and p27Kip1. CCN1 and
  miRNA29 directly activate both p53 and p21Cip, while Hsp90β represses p53–p21Cipsignaling.
  Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling activates CDK inhibitors via a pSmad3-dependent
  pathway. Notch and pSmad3 antagonize each other, and thus, Notch signaling inhibits
  these CDK inhibitors. Fibroblast growth factor receptor-p38 MAPK signaling has been
  identified as a critical pathway of deregulated cell-cycle progression and possibly
  influences cellular senescence; however, its downstream target(s) should be investigated.
  Skeletal muscle cells undergoing senescence show senescence-associated secretory
  phenotype (SASP), which can impinge on nearby cells.
