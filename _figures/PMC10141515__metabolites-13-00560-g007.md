caption: Differentially expressed proteins of the fatty acid metabolic pathway in
  ovarian cancer. Schematic representation of fatty acid metabolic pathway in ovarian
  cancer and highlight of key differentially regulated genes (SCD1/FADS2; overexpressed,
  FASN; underexpressed, ACL/ACC; overexpressed). Boxplot derived from TGCA expression
  datasets with tumor (red) and control (gray). * Represents statistical significance
  of p < 0.05.
