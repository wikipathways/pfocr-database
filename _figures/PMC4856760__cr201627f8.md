caption: Working model of the regulation of the type I interferon and NF-κB signaling
  pathway by TRIM9s. Upon virus infection, TBK1 is activated by adaptor molecules,
  such as MAVS and STING, phosphorylates IRF3 and provokes strong IFN production.
  On the other hand, these adaptor molecules activate IKK complex to promote NF-κB
  signaling. In the process, TRIM9s undergoes oligomerization and K63-linked auto-ubiquitination.
  Ubiquitinated TRIM9s serves as a platform to bridge GSK3β to TBK1, thus enhancing
  the oligomerization and auto-phosphorylation of TBK1. On the other hand, TRIM9s
  inhibits IκB degradation by suppressing β-TrCP activity, which leads to compromised
  NF-κB signaling and decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

  production of type I interferon by recruiting GSK3β to TBK1.
