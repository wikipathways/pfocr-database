caption: The schematic diagram for the HIF‐1α promoting fibroblasts activation to
  drive the growth of LC. We propose a schematic diagram for the HIF‐1α promoting
  fibroblast activation to drive the growth of LC. First, the tumour CM, TGF‐β1 and
  hypoxia up‐regulate the HIF‐1α expression in fibroblasts, inducing the conversion
  of fibroblasts into CAFs. Second, the fibroblasts with high HIF‐1α expression secrete
  CCL5 by activating NF‐kB signaling pathway, thus promoting the tumour growth of
  LC
