caption: 'Potential Role of GDH under Stress Conditions.Abiotic stresses result in
  ROS generation, inducing protease activity, increases in intracellular ammonium
  ions, and expression of gdh-NAD;A1, which participates, along with the GS/GOGAT
  pathway, in NH4+ assimilation. The supply of 2OG for Glu synthesis is provided by
  isocitrate deamination catalyzed by I(C)DHs. Glu synthesis under stress conditions
  by GDH is shifted to Pro synthesis. The enzymes involved in this metabolic scheme
  include the following: GS1, cytosolic glutamine synthetase; GS2, chloroplastic glutamine
  synthetase; IDH, mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase; and ICDH, cytosolic isocitrate
  dehydrogenase.'
