caption: Scheme of the main biochemical reactions during sperm cell activation by
  progesterone. We suggest a division of the reactions into two modules—the CatSper
  module and the Calcium module. (a) CatSper module. Without activation, the CatSper
  channel is inhibited by the plasma membrane lipid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG).
  Progesterone activates an abhydrolase domain-containing protein 2 (ABHD2), an enzyme
  that cleaves 2-AG into arachidonic acid and glycerol, and thus activates CatSper.
  (b) Calcium module. Calcium ions enter cytosol through open CatSper channels and
  then diffuse into spermatozoon midpiece (MP), where a specific isoform of phospholipase
  C, PLCδ, is located. This enzyme activity is upregulated by calcium; PLCδ catalyzes
  IP3 production from the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
  IP3 activates IP3 channel-receptors (IP3R) located on the spermatozoon calcium store,
  RNE (redundant nuclear envelope), and thus induces calcium release into the cell
  cytosol. Plasma Membrane Calcium ATPase (PMCA) present in the sperm cilia membrane
  extrudes calcium into extracellular media. Signaling Pathway Calcium ATPase (SPCA)
  pumps calcium into the calcium stores RNE. Moreover, calcium buffers such as calmodulin
  (CaM) located in the cytosol and calreticulin (CalRet) located in the endoplasmic
  reticulum can reversibly bind calcium. IP3 is metabolized by inositol polyphosphate
  5-phosphatase (IPP5P).
