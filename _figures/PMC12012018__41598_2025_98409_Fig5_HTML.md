caption: Spatial metabolic pathway network of differential amino acids. (I) Comparison
  between mice infected with sensitive (S) and resistant (R) parasites; Metabolites
  labeled in red and blue respectively represented up-regulated and down-regulated.
  Metabolites labeled in orange suggested that there may be oppositely regulated between
  the groups. The superscript “S” or “R” means the variations original from sensitive
  or resistant groups. (II) Comparison between mice infected with sensitive (S) and
  resistant (R) parasites under the treatments of ART monotherapy and ART-CHR combination.
  The superscript arabic numbers next to the letter S or R represents 1S vs. S-ART
  or R vs. R-ART, 2S vs. S-1:2 or R vs. R-1:2, 3S-ART vs. S-1:2 or R-ART vs. R-1:2
