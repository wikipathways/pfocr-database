caption: TRIM38-mediated negative regulation of TLR3/4-mediated and TNF/IL-1-triggered
  signaling. After the activation of TLR3/4, TRIM38 is recruited to the adapter protein
  TRIF, leading to its K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation, therefore negatively
  regulating TLR3/4-mediated induction of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs.
  In the early phase of infection, type I IFNs induce the expression of TRIM38, which
  in turn mediates the degradation of TAB2/3 by a lysosomal pathway, leading to negative
  regulation of TNF- and IL-1-triggered signaling and inflammatory response.
