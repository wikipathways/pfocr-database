caption: Summarizing model to explain the pathway how SIAH ubiquitin ligases influence
  migration, invasion, and proliferation according to our results. At low levels of
  active SIAH1 or SIAH2, p27 is present and inhibits phosphorylation of Rb via CDK
  inhibition. Non-phosphorylated Rb sequesters the E2F1 transcription factor and thereby
  inhibits stathmin expression. High levels of active SIAH1 and SIAH2 ligases induce
  ubiquitinylation of p27 and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Active CDKs phosphorylate
  Rb, inducing the release of E2F1 and stathmin expression. Stathmin depolymerizes
  microtubules, a prerequisite for increased migration, invasion, and proliferation.
