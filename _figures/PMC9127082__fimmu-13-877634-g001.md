caption: Iron metabolism and the pathway of ferroptosis. Ferrireductase (DMT1) converts
  Fe (III) to Fe (II). Some of Fe (II) is bound to ferritin and forms cytosolic labile
  iron pool (cLIP), and some crosses the basolateral membrane through ferroportin
  (FPN) into the plasma to combine with transferrin (TF). Fe (II) can initiate liposome
  peroxidation through the Fenton reaction. The system    is a counter-transport that
  can ingest cystine and excrete glutamic acid to synthesize glutathione (GSH). Glutathione
  peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a selenium enzyme that catalyzes GSH into oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG) and reduces toxic peroxides to non-toxic hydroxyl compounds. And the FSP1-CoQ-NADPH
  pathway and DHODH can inhibit lipid peroxidation and protect cells from ferroptosis
  by generating ubiquinol. In the GCH-BH4 pathway, GCH1 resists ferroptosis through
  its metabolite BH4. BH4 acts as a free-radical-trapping antioxidant or participates
  in ubiquinone synthesis to inhibit lipid peroxidation.
