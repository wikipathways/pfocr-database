caption: Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis within macrophage. MAP infects by passing
  the mucosal barrier, preferentially via M cells, and after which it is engulfed
  by subepithelial macrophage (A). A number of MAP bacilli are degraded within the
  phagosome (B) and stimulate CD4+ immune responses via antigen presentation through
  the MHC class II pathway. (C) Alternatively MAP evades destruction within phagosome,
  through inhibition of normal killing mechanisms, and proliferates. (D) Secreted
  MAP proteins may pass from the phagosome to the cytosol and be subsequently available
  for presentation to CD8+ immune responses via the MHC class I pathway. Survival
  and proliferation within macrophage is a vital element in the virulence of paratuberculosis.
