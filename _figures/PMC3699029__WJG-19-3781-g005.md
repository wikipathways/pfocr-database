caption: Schematic diagram of the effect of glycyrrhizic acid on the interruption
  of p53 signaling in carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatocyte apoptosis (blue arrows).
  Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) suppressed the activation of p53, decreased the expression
  level of Bax and increased the expression level of Bcl-2, which resulted in reduced
  cytochrome C release from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, and inactivated caspase-9
  and -3; GA also significantly inhibited Smac release from mitochondria into the
  cytoplasm and elevated the expression level of c-IAP1, resulting in inhibition of
  caspase-3 activity. Ultimately, GA suppressed the apoptosis of hepatocytes.
