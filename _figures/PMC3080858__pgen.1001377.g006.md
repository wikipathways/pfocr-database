caption: 'Top panel: Under favorable environmental conditions, signaling through the
  TGF-β pathway activates the R-SMAD proteins DAF-8 and DAF-14, which regulate insulin
  gene expression while antagonizing DAF-3 and DAF-5 function. These insulins may
  act as agonists and activate IIS, thereby promoting phosphorylation and suppression
  of DAF-16 activity. In this feed-forward model, the worm undergoes reproductive
  growth and has a normal life span. Middle panel: PDP-1 negatively regulates TGF-β
  signaling through dephosphorylation of DAF-8 and DAF-14. Under these conditions,
  DAF-3 and DAF-5 repress the transcription of agonistic insulins as well as expression
  of the daf-7 TGF-β ligand and daf-8, leading to further downregulation of the TGF-β
  pathway. Alternatively, DAF-3 and DAF-5 may promote transcription of potential antagonistic
  insulins. This results in reduced signaling through the IIS pathway, enhancing DAF-16
  nuclear localization. Lower panel: Under low IIS conditions, DAF-16 localization
  is predominantly nuclear, where it regulates the transcription of hundreds of target
  genes that act in combination to regulate longevity, stress resistance, dauer formation
  and the response to stress. Paradoxically, under low IIS conditions, DAF-3 and DAF-5
  play opposite roles. DAF-5 is likely to synergize with DAF-16 and modulate the activity
  of its target genes. DAF-3 acts to antagonize DAF-16, either directly or through
  suppression of DAF-16 target genes. Therefore, the role of DAF-3 in modulating IIS
  depends upon the level of signaling through the pathway.'
