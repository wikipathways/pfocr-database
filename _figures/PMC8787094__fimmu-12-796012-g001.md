caption: 'RNA binding PRRs and their regulation (A) Innate immune signaling pathways
  triggered by RNA binding PRRs. Interaction of endosomal TLRs (TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8),
  cytosolic RLRs (RIG-I and MDA5) and cGAS with different RNA substrates activates
  IRF3/7 and NFκkB pathway in TRIF/MyD88, MAVS and STING dependent manner, respectively.
  This activation leads to an induction of ISGs (IFN stimulated genes) as a part of
  the type I IFN response. On the other hand, NLRs (e.g. NLPRP1/3) promote apoptosis
  speck-like protein (ASC)/caspase-mediated signaling. Caspase-dependent cleavage
  of Gasdermin-D (GSDM-D) and maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 lead to pyroptosis
  and inflammation, respectively. All these pathways contribute to developing cellular
  innate immunity and counteracting the effect of different pathogens. While LGP2
  can positively (+) and negatively (–) regulate RIG-I and MDA5 pathways, LysRS inhibits
  the cGAS-STING pathway (, , –). (B) RNA sensing by non-PRR RBPs. Upon dsRNA binding,
  ZNFX1 driven type I IFN response via MAVS leads to the expression of ISGs: RIG-I
  and MDA5, which autoregulate their expression by a positive feedback loop. In addition,
  La, an autoantigen, could promote RIG-I induction upon viral RNA binding. Sensing
  of dsRNA structures containing stem-loops 1 and 2 (SL1 and SL2) within SARS-CoV-2
  5’UTR by prenylated OAS1 promotes RNase L mediated degradation of the viral RNA
  and hence displays negative effect (–) on SARS-CoV-2. Ro60 interaction with Alu
  RNA elicits innate immunity by positively regulating TLR7 signaling. ZBP1 interaction
  with viral or host Z-RNA activates NLRP3 signaling by positively regulating RIPK3,
  which encourages the NLPRP3 pathway directly or via caspases. These pathways (along
  with MLKL mediated necroptosis) lead to PANoptosis or inflammatory cell death (–).'
