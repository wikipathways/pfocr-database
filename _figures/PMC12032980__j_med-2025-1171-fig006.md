caption: 'Molecular mechanisms for the causal interaction between MIG, IL10, B-NGF,
  IFN-G, and MZL: MIG/CXCL9 may promote MZL progression by upregulating β-catenin,
  while IL-10 likely facilitates tumor immune evasion, contributing to MZL development.
  The molecular mechanism through which B-NGF inhibits MZL progression remains unclear.
  MZL may reduce IFN-γ levels, potentially suppressing tumor cell apoptosis by inhibiting
  the JAK-STAT1-caspase signaling pathway. This reduction could enhance the activity
  of immunosuppressive M2-like TAMs and weaken the synergistic effect of TNF. Furthermore,
  through the p16INK4a-Rb pathway, it may inhibit tumor cell senescence and dormancy,
  leading to immune suppression and evasion, thereby promoting MZL progression'
