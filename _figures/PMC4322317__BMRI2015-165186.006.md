caption: Images (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively, indicate cluster 92, cluster
  92 after filtering (using the node removal method), cluster 92 after the edge filtering
  method based on MR, and cluster 92 after the edge filtering method based on sequence
  similarity. Proteins of corum_788 complex belong to the REACT_20619.1 metabolic
  pathway, and they are involved in the metabolism of mRNA. Pictures were drawn by
  Sytoscape software [].
