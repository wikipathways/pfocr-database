caption: 'Schematic representation of the effects of apoA-I on TNF-α mRNA stabilization
  in LPS-stimulated macrophages. The results of the present studies revealed the following
  scheme for the possible mechanisms: apoA-I down-regulates the expression of TNF-α
  via a post-transcriptional regulation manner in macrophages; when macrophages are
  treated with apoA-I, the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is activated, and the STAT3
  dimers bind to the regulated elements of TTP in the nucleus. Then the expression
  of TTP is up-regulated, which in turn promotes the degradation of inflammatory cytokine
  mRNA through its 3′-UTR AREs. Plus sign indicates activation; scissors indicate
  degradation.'
