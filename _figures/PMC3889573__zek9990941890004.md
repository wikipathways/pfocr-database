caption: The ER stress response and UPR pathways in C. neoformans. The Cryptococcus
  UPR pathway consists of the Ire1 kinase, the bZIP transcription factor Hxl1, and
  their target genes. The UPR pathway responds to ER stress caused by the accumulation
  of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER. In addition, the UPR pathway is involved
  in cell wall integrity, antifungal drug resistance, and virulence. However, Ire1
  has Hxl1-independent roles in certain cellular functions, including capsule biosynthesis.
  Conversely, Hxl1 appears to have Ire1-independent functions. Please refer to the
  text for more details on the regulatory mechanism of the UPR pathway. Black arrows
  indicate positive regulation or activation, whereas red lines ending in circles
  indicate negative regulation or repression. Broken arrows or lines indicate potential
  but unclear regulation.
