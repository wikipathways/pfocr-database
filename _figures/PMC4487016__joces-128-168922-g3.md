caption: Molecular architecture of the SEA complex. Schematic representation of the
  molecular architecture of the SEA complex obtained through integrative modeling.
  Domains and folds of each SEA member are represented by different geometric forms.
  Mammalian homologs of SEACAT (GATOR2) and SEACIT (GATOR1) subcomplexes are indicated.
  All of the components of GATOR1 have been linked to cancer and other diseases; see
  main text for details.
