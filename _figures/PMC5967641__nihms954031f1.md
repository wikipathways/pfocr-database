caption: NAD+ biosynthesis, consumption and salvage pathways. The intracellular NAD+
  pool consists of both oxidized (NAD+) and reduced (NADH) forms. Electrons derived
  from substrate catabolism are carried by NADH and used for oxidative phosphorylation
  and biosynthetic reactions. NAD+ also functions as a co-substrate for sirtuins,
  ADP-ribose transferases, and cyclic ADP-ribose synthases (CD38). Eukaryotes synthesize
  NAD+ from the amino acid tryptophan via the de novo pathway or NAD+ can be salvaged
  from nicotinamide (NAM) and converted into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by
  nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt). NMN can also be generated by the
  phosphorylation of NR by nicotinamide riboside kinase (Nrk).
