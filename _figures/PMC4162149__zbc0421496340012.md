caption: A model for MC4R-dependent Ca2+signaling and the role of NCKX4. MSH binding
  to the MC4R is shown to active Gαq, via the exchange of GTP for GDP (upper row).
  It is important to note that MC4R may constitutively activate Gαq even in the absence
  of ligand (). So activated, Gαq goes on to bind and stimulate PLC-β, which subsequently
  cleaves phosphatidylinositol 1,4-bisphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and
  inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). The membrane-bound diacylglycerol then activates
  the Ca2+-selective entry channel, TRPC6, which results in an elevation of cytosolic
  [Ca2+] and consequent neuronal activation, which may include the initiation of action
  potentials () and the release of oxytocin (, ) (lower row). Normally, NCKX4 acts
  locally to extrude the Ca2+ that enters via TRPC6, thus moderating the signaling
  pathway so only strong signals drive neuronal activation. In the absence of this
  moderating influence, even weak, constitutive, signaling via MC4R can result in
  sufficient Ca2+ entry to initiate neuronal activation.
