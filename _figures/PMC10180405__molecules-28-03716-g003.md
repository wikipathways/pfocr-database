caption: 'BMP-2 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways participate in the pharmacological
  activity of naringin in mediating osteogenic differentiation. BMP-2 may interact
  with its receptors, such as BMPRII and BMPRI; this is followed by the activation
  of Smad1/5/8, which recruits Smad4, forming a complex and entering the nucleus for
  the transcriptional mediation of osteogenic factors, such as RUNX-2. After being
  activated by Wnt, β-catenin is stabilized and translocated to the nucleus for the
  transcriptional mediation of osteogenic factors. Activated β-catenin may also stimulate
  the BMP-2/Smad signaling pathway to induce osteogenic differentiation. Naringin
  can stimulate the BMP-2/Smad and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways to promote osteogenic
  differentiation. Abbreviations: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; BMPRs, BMP receptors;
  SMAD: suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic; Runx-2, Runt-related transcription
  factor-2; LRP, LDL receptor-related protein; Axin2, axis inhibition protein 2; APC,
  adenomatous polyposis coli; CK1α, casein kinase 1α; TCF-4, transcription factor
  4; LEF1, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1.'
