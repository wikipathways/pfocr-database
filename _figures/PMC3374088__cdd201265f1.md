caption: Caspase-8 has a crucial role in the regulation of DRs. Downstream of DRs
  like TNF, caspase-8 is part of the death-inducing signaling complex, recruited by
  its interaction with FADD, (a). Here, it inhibits the activation of RIPK3 by RIPK1,
  thus also regulating necroptosis. At the same time caspase-8 is bound and regulated
  in its pro-apoptotic function by its interaction with FLIP. Consequently, both apoptosis
  and necrosis can result from activation of the DR in a regulated manner. (a) In
  a normal receptor, the regulated interaction of these elements allows a controlled
  cell death. Wild-type mice therefore show normal development with a regulated death
  pathway. (b) Knockout mice for caspase-8, caspase-8−/−, FADD, fadd−/− or double
  knockouts for both show an embryonically lethal phenotype due to uncontrolled necrosis
  by active (phosphorylated) RIPK3. (c) Triple knockouts for fadd−/−, flip−/− and
  ripk3−/− have a normal cell-death pathway and develop to normal birth because of
  absence of necrosis (driven by RIPK3) and apoptosis (driven by FADD and thus inability
  to recruit caspase-8). (d) Double-knockout mice for ripk3−/−; flip−/− die during
  embryonic development due to uncontrolled apoptosis driven by active (stars) caspase-8.
