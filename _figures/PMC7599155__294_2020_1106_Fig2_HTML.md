caption: Dna2 is an essential gatekeeper to HR-dependent restart of stalled replication
  forks. By degrading dissociated nascent DNA at stalled RFs, Dna2 counteracts RF
  reversal, promoting the resumption of DNA synthesis and/or RF convergence to mediate
  complete genome replication. By processing stalled RFs, Dna2 also limits opportunities
  for RF restart by RDR, and this makes Dna2 indispensable for cell survival. While
  RDR provides an important salvage pathway for stalled RFs, DNA synthesis in the
  context of a displacement loop (D-loop) is unstable. In the absence of Dna2, excessive
  RDR results in an accumulation of unsustainably high levels of recombination by-products
  by way of D-loop collapse. Exposure of long ssDNA tracts then causes Rad9-dependent
  checkpoint activation and terminal cell-cycle arrest. For further details, see main
