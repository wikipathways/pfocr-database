caption: The dual-feedback control system that maintains hydrostatic pressure in the
  lens. Lens surface pressure (pset) is maintained by the competing activities of
  the two arms of a dual-feedback system that regulate ion transporters that control
  the intracellular osmolarity of cells at the lens surface. Increases in pressure
  (Dpi), hypoosmotic stress, increased zonular tension, or the TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A
  (GSK), all work via TRPV4 to activate a signaling pathway that involves the release
  of ATP via hemichannel, the subsequent activation of purinergic P2Y receptors, and
  the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (SFK) to increase the activity of the
  Na+/K- ATPase and decrease lens pressure. Decreases in pressure (Dpi), hyperosmotic
  stress, decreased zonular tension or the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin all work via TRPV1
  to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) and the WNK (Kinase with no lysine (K)), and SPAK (Ste20-related
  proline-alanine-rich kinase)/OSR1(oxidative stress-responsive kinase-1) signaling
  pathway to directly activate the sodium potassium dichloride cotransporter (NKCC)
  and to eventually reduce the decrease in the activity of the Na+/K- ATPase to effect
  an increase in surface pressure. This scheme is based on earlier model (; ). The
