caption: Rapidly induced cell autonomous bypass signaling. a Using EGFR mutated lung
  tumors as an example, oncogenic EGFR signals through the MEK/ERK pathway to drive
  growth and survival, but also suppresses FGFR2, FGFR3 and TGFβ2 expression. b Upon
  treatment with EGFR-specific TKIs, MEK/ERK activity is inhibited to reduce growth
  and survival signaling, but also de-represses alternative bypass growth and survival
  pathways including FGFR2, FGFR3, TGFβ2 and IL6. EGFR TKIs increase NFκB pathway
  activity which may drive expression of IL6 []. These transcriptional changes result
  in establishment of emergent autocrine loops to ensure the continued growth and
  survival of the tumor in the presence of an EGFR inhibitor
