caption: 'Mechanisms of gene conversion by double-strand break repair. The ends of
  a broken DNA molecule (A) are processed by exonucleolytic resection of the 5'' end
  to give a 3'' overhanging tail (B). This tail is coated by the Rad51 recombinase
  and then invades a homologous donor sequence forming a D-loop (C). The 3''-end in
  the D-loop primes DNA synthesis that copies the homologous sequence (D). At this
  point there are two different possible routes: In a pathway called synthesis-dependent
  strand-annealing (SDSA), the extended 3''-end is dissociated from the D-loop (E).
  It might then anneal to the 3'' tail from the other side of the break, because the
  extended sequence is now complementary to that 3''-end (F). After gap-filling and
  ligation we are left with an unchanged donor molecule and a repaired molecule that
  carries sequence copied from the donor (G). Where the site of the original break
  was bridged, donor sequence is in both strands. Where sequence copied from the donor
  has annealed to the other 3''-end, there is heteroduplex, having one strand from
  the donor sequence and one from the damaged molecule. Resolution of heteroduplex
  is described in . SDSA is the major mode of recombinational repair of double-strand
  breaks in somatic cells. It does not lead to crossing over. In an alternative process
  called the double Holliday junction pathway, the 3''-end from the other side of
  the break anneals to the displaced strand in the D-loop (H), generating a double
  Holliday junction (I). As shown, the double Holliday junction can be resolved by
  endonuclease or by helicase and topoisomerase to give the same non-crossover configuration
  (G). Alternatively, the double Holliday junction can be resolved endonucleolytically
  to form a cross-over (not shown). Each line represents a nucleotide chain or strand
  of DNA. The damaged molecule is shown as red and the donor (undamaged) molecule,
  as well as sequences copied from it, are shown in black. New DNA synthesis is shown
  as dotted lines. Polarity is indicated by half arrows on 3'' single-strand ends.'
