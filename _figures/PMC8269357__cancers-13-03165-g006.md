caption: The network analysis of identified cancer-related mRNAs and aberrantly expressed
  mRNAs in cancer cells. The expression of identified cancer-related RBPs was regulated
  by the classical cell survival signal pathway (A). mRNAs that are overexpressed
  in cancer cells were shown to be regulated by the identified cancer-related RBPs
  in cancerous cells (B).
