caption: Dopaminergic neurons receive excitatory input from glutamatergic neurons.
  Excitation results in Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane through NMDA receptors.
  Ca2+ is transported into the ER and mitochondria. In response to either IP3 or elevated
  cytosolic Ca2+ levels, Ca2+ is released from the ER through IP3 or ryanodine receptor
  channels. ER Ca2+ stores are replenished by SOCE, a process in which STIM1 interacts
  with TRPC1 Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, resulting in Ca2+ influx. Much
  of the Ca2+ that enters through TRPC1 channels is transported into the ER, replenishing
  the ER Ca2+ pool. SOCE may also lead to activation of AKT, which, in turn, activates
  mTOR. In this issue of the JCI, Selvaraj et al. () reveal a role for impaired SOCE
  in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons caused by the mitochondrial toxin MPTP.
  MPP+, a metabolite of MPTP, is transported into dopaminergic neurons via the dopamine
  transporter protein (DAT) and then interacts with and inhibits complex I in the
  mitochondrial electron transport chain. This results in excessive generation of
  superoxide and dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ regulation. One consequence of
  these mitochondrial alterations is suppression of expression of the Trpc1 gene,
  resulting in impaired SOCE, ER Ca2+ store depletion, and activation of the UPR.
  If strong and sustained, the UPR can trigger a programmed cell death (PCD) pathway
  involving the proteins activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CHOP. CytC,
  cytochrome c; PTP, permeability transition pore.
