caption: The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is triggered by various stimuli inducing
  mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. In response to apoptotic stimuli, these
  proteins undergo conformational changes, which lead to their oligomerization on
  the outer mitochondrial membrane. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins block this process
  by interacting with Bax and Bak, which inhibits mitochondria permeabilization and
  subsequent cell death. After mitochondrial permeabilization, cytochrome c released
  into the cytosol binds to Apaf-1. It induces the conformational change and oligomerization
  of Apaf-1. This promotes apoptosome formation. The apoptosome is composed of Apaf-1,
  caspase-9 and cytochrome c. The apoptosome can recruit, dimerize and induce caspase-9.
  Successively, it leads to cleaving and inducing of caspase-3 and caspase-7. The
  last step of apoptosis is DNA degradation. The extrinsic apoptosis signal is triggered
  by activation of death receptors. The cognate extracellular death ligands refer
  to soluble molecules of the TNF family. They are released as homotrimers and bind
  to the TNF-R family. Ligand-binding makes the cell membrane receptors trimerize
  and activate. TNF-Rs have a death domain (DD) that can recruit other DD-containing
  proteins. These proteins include Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD)
  and TNF-R type 1-associated death domain protein (TRADD). These proteins bind to
  caspase-8 and caspase-10, and then activate DISC. DISC primarily activates caspase-8
  and promotes the cell death outcome. After the activation of caspase-8 and -10,
  caspase-3 and -7 are cleaved, which causes cell degradation.
