caption: Mechanisms of protein sequestration at the nuclear periphery. (A) The INM
  regulates cell stemness via sequestration of Notch, Wnt, and TGFβ pathway effectors.
  The Notch signaling corepressor NCOR and coactivator SKIP are anchored to the nuclear
  periphery in normal cells (; ). Although NCOR is activated at the nuclear periphery,
  SKIP may be restricted from binding to Notch-dependent promoters. SKIP has also
  been shown to interact with SMAD2/3 to regulate TGFβ-dependent transcription ().
  Similarly, SMAD2/3 is bound to MAN1. The interaction with MAN1 sequesters SMAD2/3,
  attenuating heterodimerization with Smad4 and suppressing TGFβ-induced transcription
  (; ). Wnt pathway regulation involves emerin-mediated nuclear export of β-catenin
  as well as the possible stabilization of β-catenin by α-catenin and nuclear actin
  (; ; ; ; ). (B) Proliferation is regulated by the interaction of the nuclear lamina
  with AP-1, Rb, and ERK1/2. Hypophosphorylated cFos and Rb are sequestered by the
  nuclear lamina, priming a readily available population of transcription factors
  for rapid cell cycle regulation (; ). Activation and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2
  contribute to the phosphorylation of Rb and cFos. Phosphorylated Rb is degraded,
  freeing E2F to activate transcription. Similarly, phosphorylation of cFos facilitates
  dimerization with cJun and promoter binding. E2F is also sequestered to the nuclear
  periphery via its interaction with Germ cell-less (GCL) and Lap2β (). Nuclear ERK1/2
  can bind to lamin A/C as well (), potentially regulating its activity and turnover.
  (C) Lamin A is required for the proper localization and enzymatic activity of SIRT1
  and SIRT6, regulating chromatin condensation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)
  activity (; ). hMOF localization is also dependent on lamin A/C (), implicating
  the nuclear lamina in both histone acetylation and deacetylation. In addition, lamin
  A binds the chromatin remodeling complexes PRC and NuRD, establishing a repressive
  heterochromatin state at the INM (; ). (D) The shelterin complex components TRF1/2
  and AKTIP regulate telomere replication, length, and stability (; ; ; ). Whereas
  TRF1 may bind lamin B (), TRF2 stabilization of telomeres at the nuclear periphery
  is dependent on binding to lamin A/C and Lap2α (). Similarly, AKTIP interacts with
  lamin A/C, lamin B, and PCNA to regulate telomere replication and stability ().
  The INM-incorporated lipid moiety S1P is also able to promote telomere stability
  by preventing the degradation of hTERT ().
