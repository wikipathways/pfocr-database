caption: ß-catenin lies at the heart of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. (A) In
  the absence of the Wnt ligands, Axin, APC, and GSK3 form the ß-catenin destruction
  complex. Axin serves as a scaffold for APC and GSK3, which bind and phosphorylate
  cytoplasmic ß-catenin, respectively. Phosphorylated ß-catenin is ubiquitinated by
  ß-TrCP and targeted for degradation in proteasomes. (B) Pathway activity is initiated
  by Wnt ligands that are secreted by neighboring cells. Wnt ligands are produced
  in the ER and become palmitoylated by Porcupine (PORCN) receptors, which in turn
  translocate Wnt ligands into the Golgi for endosomal exocytosis. Extracellular Wnt
  ligands bind to receptors Fz and LRP5/6 and trigger the removal of destruction complexes
  and Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) from the cytosol to stabilize ß-catenin.
  Accumulated ß-catenin translocate into the nucleus and binds to LEF/TCF and induces
  gene transcription of targets such as c-Myc, cyclin D, Axin2, and alkaline phosphatase
  (ALP). Pathway activity is turned off by multiple mechanisms, including negative
  feedback inhibition whereby ß-catenin induces gene transcription of secreted Wnt
  inhibitors, sclerostin (Scl) and Dickopff 1 (Dkk1).
