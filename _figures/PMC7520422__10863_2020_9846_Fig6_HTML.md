caption: Phosphatidylcholine (PC) content in the cell membrane increases by the induction
  of the Kennedy pathway, PE N-methyltransferase and CDP-choline pathway. Conversely,
  the induction of PC N-methyltransferase, PLC and PLD leads to PC degradation. PC
  is the easily accessible energy for the cell which could be used for cancerous proliferation;
  PE - phosphatidylethanolamine, PLC - phosphatidylcholine, PLD – phospholipase D,
  CDP - cytidine diphosphate;
