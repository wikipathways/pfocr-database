caption: 'Schematic depiction of cannabinoid and exemplar mono‐, sesqui‐, and diterpenoid
  biosynthesis. The isoprenoid and prenyl precursors for cannabigerolic acid (CBGA),
  are provided by the hexanoate and 2‐C‐methyl‐D‐erythritol 4‐phosphate (MEP) pathways,
  respectively. Geranyl diphosphate (GPP), is a key intermediate metabolite and building
  block for both cannabinoid and terpenoid biosynthesis. The seven‐step mevalonate
  (MVA) pathway converts pyruvate and glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate (G‐3‐P) into isopentenyl
  diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Key catalytic enzymes controlling
  flux through this pathway include the first two steps, 1‐deoxy‐D‐xylulose 5‐phosphate
  synthase (DXS) and 1‐deoxy‐D‐xylulose 5‐phosphate reductase (DXR). In the six‐step
  MEP pathway, three units of acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) are converted to IPP, which
  is isomerized with DMAPP by IPP isomerase. The enzyme catalysing the synthesis of
  MEV, 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl‐CoA reductase (HMGR), is considered to control flux
  through this pathway. The number of consecutive condensations of the five‐carbon
  monomer isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to its isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)
  is indicated by 1x, 2x, 3x. Longer‐chain isoprenoids, GPP, farnesyl diphosphate
  (FPP) and geranyl geranyl diphosphate (GGPP), are the products of IPP and DMAPP
  condensation catalysed by GPP synthase, FPP synthase and GGPP synthase, respectively.
  GPP, FPP and geranyl‐geranyl diphosphate (GGPP) are the precursors for mono‐, sequi‐,
  and di‐terpines, respectively. The final steps catalysing the synthesis of major
  active cannabinoids, cannabichromenic acid (CBCA), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and
  Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), are oxidocyclases, CBCA synthase (CBCAS),
  CBDA synthase (CBDAS) and THCA synthase (THCAS). Components of Figure 2 are derived
  from . AAE, acyl‐activating enzyme; CBD: cannabidiol; CYP76F39, α/β‐santalene monooxygenase;
  GPP synthase small subunit; OLS, olivetol synthase; P450: haemoprotein cytochrome
  P450; PT, prenyltransferase; STS, santalene synthase; TS, gamma‐terpinene synthase;
  TXS, taxadiene synthase'
