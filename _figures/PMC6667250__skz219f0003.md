  enrichment was reported by . Genes shown in dark red were differentially expressed
  as determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR). Genes
  in pink and green that were higher or lower, respectively, in breast muscle of the
  high FE compared to the low FE Pedigree Male phenotype. Vacuole sorting protein
  (VPS) genes are shown as bars for simplicity. The figure was based on one provided
