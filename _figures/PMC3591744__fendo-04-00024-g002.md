caption: Schematic representation of GnRHR (A) and Kiss-R (B) signaling. (A) GnRH
  binds to the Gq/11-coupled membrane receptors. Activation of Gq/11 proteins stimulates
  phospholipase C (PLC) activity to generate inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG). Increases of these signal messengers lead to the activation of protein kinase
  C (PKC) and an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). The PKC and Ca2+ pathways are involved in the GnRH regulation of
  GTH subunit gene expression, while GTH secretion is mainly mediated by the GnRH-induced
  increase in intracellular calcium through the calmodulin (CaM). It has also been
  proposed that GnRH caused GTP loading on Gs and increased intracellular cAMP via
  activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), which elevates GnRH release via the cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase (PKA) (Liu et al., ). (B) Binding of kisspeptin to teleosts Kiss-R2
  activates the Gq/11 and PLC to generate IP3 and DAG. IP3 causes intracellular Ca2+
  release from the ER, which activates PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  cascade. However, teleosts Kiss-R could be activated by the cAMP/PKA pathway probably
  through Gs. All the figures were adopted from Ando et al. (), Krsmanovic et al.
