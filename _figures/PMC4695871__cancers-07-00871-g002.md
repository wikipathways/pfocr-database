caption: Binding of the Hedgehog ligand (SHH) to Patched (PTCH1) removes the inhibitory
  signal for the G-protein-coupled receptor, Smoothened (SMO), causing translocation
  of the GLI1 and GLI2 transcription factors into the nucleus. Itraconazole inhibits
  SMO at a site distinct from cyclopamine, vismodegib, and sonidegib. Arsenic trioxide
  degrades GLI2 and, in combination with itraconazole, demonstrates activity in animal
  models resistant to vismodegib due to SMO mutations.
