caption: Proposed schematic of chemokine-induced traffic and activation of DCs following
  DNA vaccination with plasmid-encoded Flt3L and MIP-1α. (A) Following intramuscular
  injection in mice of plasmid-encoded MIP-1α (pMIP-1α) and plasmid-encoded Flt3L
  (pFlt3L), in combination with HIV-1 env, muscle and resident APCs are transfected
  with plasmid, leading to protein production. MIP-1α protein is secreted, while Flt3L
  is expressed on muscle cells or on the surface of resident APCs. HIV-1 env is processed,
  and peptides are presented by MHC class I molecules; this peptide/MHC complex stimulates
  CD8+ T lymphocytes. Soluble protein released by transfected cells is taken up by
  APCs, and via the MHC Class II pathway, the peptide/MHC complex stimulates CD4+
  T lymphocytes. Cross-priming occurs in which CD8+ T cell responses are primed by
  exogenous class I–restricted antigens that are not expressed in, but rather are
  acquired by, local APCs. (B) DCs that express CCR5 are recruited to the site of
  immunization in response to MIP-1α secretion. DCs bind Flt3L on the surface of local
  APCs or muscle cells, resulting in their expansion and maturation as they migrate
  to the draining lymph node. How antigen is acquired by the newly recruited DCs is
  an important question that remains poorly understood. These DCs acquire antigen,
  express CCR7, and are attracted by chemokines expressed in the draining lymph nodes.
  (C) The same DCs as in B traffic to the draining lymph nodes, where they prime naive
  T cells. Mature DCs express high levels of MHC class II, costimulatory molecules,
  activation markers, adhesion molecules, and chemokine receptors, secrete cytokines
  and chemokines, and form dendrites.
