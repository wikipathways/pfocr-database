caption: Regulation of intracellular GPCR (including α2C-ARs) activity. Newly synthesized
  GPCRs can be retained in the ER as a result of misfolding and/or chaperone-linked
  quality control and retention/retrieval mechanisms (designated as red 5th and 6th
  transmembrane domains). Prolonged cooling, cell signaling or exogenous chaperones
  (chemical, pharmacological) can counteract quality control and chaperone-mediated
  retention of GPCRs in the ER, enabling transport of the receptors through the Golgi
  compartments. Receptor maturation is associated with alterations in the glycosylation
  of the proteins, and acquisition of EndoH-resistance (designated as changes in GPCR
  N-terminus). Mature GPCRs can be retained in the trans-Golgi compartment for rapid
  transport to the cell surface in response to cell signaling activated by acute cooling,
  and by agonists stimulating the same GPCR (homologous) or distinct GPCRs (heterologous
  sensitization). Intracellular receptors retained in the biosynthetic pathway can
  be activated by agonists capable of accessing the intracellular compartments (GPCR
  activation designated by starbursts). Cell surface receptors can also be translocated
  to the trans-Golgi compartment following phosphorylation (by GRKs, designated by
  red 3rd intracellular loop) and internalization via the endosomal pathway.
