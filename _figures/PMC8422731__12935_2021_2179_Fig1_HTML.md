caption: The classical STAT3 Signaling Pathway in Cancer Cells. Binding of IL-6 to
  its membrane-bound IL-6 receptor α (IL-6R) and IL-6 receptor β (also known as gp130)
  results in formation of IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 complex. The IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 complex activates
  the JAKs by phosphorylation which results in STAT3 phosphorylation and activation.
  STAT3 activation can be achieved by phosphorylation via other factors such as growth
  factors (i.e. FGF, IGF and EGF). These growth factors bind to their cognate membrane
  receptors. Upon phosphorylation, STAT3 forms a homodimer which translocates into
  the nucleus to bind to the promotor region of target genes and activates target
  gene transcription
