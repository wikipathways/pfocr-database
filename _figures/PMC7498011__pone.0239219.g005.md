caption: The biological relevance of 14 statistically significant triplets was confirmed
  by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis as well as GRN analysis. A subnetwork of GRN
  that includes the regulatory relations of such triplets is shown here. Red nodes
  represent the X3 position gene in each triplet, green nodes represent the X1 and
  X2 position genes, and other genes are presented by blue nodes.
