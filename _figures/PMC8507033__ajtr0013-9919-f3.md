caption: ECM Anabolism/Catabolism regulatory network in NPCs with miRNAs. miR-21,
  by targeting PTEN and inhibiting the transformation of LC3-I to LC3-II, inhibits
  autophagy and finally regulates ADAMTSs expression. Also, miR-21 can inhibit the
  expression of PDCD4, and then inhibit the phosphorylation of c-Jun and the activation
  of AP-1, finally affecting the expression of MMPs. miR-223-3p, miR-194-5p and miR-155
  inhibit the activation of NF-κB through different pathways, and then regulate the
  expression of MMPs and ADAMTSS, respectively. miR-154 inhibits the expression of
  MMPs by targeting FGF-14. miR-486-5p inhibits the expression of MMPs and ADAMTSS
  via down-regulating the FOXO1 expression. miR-22 inhibits the activation of the
  canonical Wnt pathway through unknown mechanism, and ultimately inhibits the expression
  of MMPs and ADAMTSS. At the same time, there is mutual negative regulation between
  miR-22 and H19. miR-146a-5p activates the Jak/STAT3 also through the unknown pathway,
  thereby promoting the expression of MMPs and ADAMTSs. Finally, MMPs and ADAMTSs
  promote the degradation of key ECM molecules such as Col II and Aggrecan.
