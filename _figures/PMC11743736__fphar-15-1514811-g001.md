caption: Lipid metabolism pathways and promising targets for breast cancer treatment.
  This schematic diagram illustrates the key processes and molecular involved in lipid
  metabolism, including fatty acid (FA) uptake, De novo lipogenesis (DNL), FA oxidation
  (FAO) and cholesterol biosynthesis. Extracellular triglycerides are hydrolyzed by
  lipoprotein lipase (LPL), releasing free FAs for cellular uptake via membrane-associated
  proteins such as CD36, fatty acid transport protein (FATP), and plasma membrane
  fatty acid-binding protein (FABP). Intracellularly, acetyl-CoA generated from FAs
  or glucose enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce energy in mitochondria.
  Acetyl-CoA also serve as a substrate for DNL. This metabolic pathway leads to the
  synthesis of malonyl-CoA and, ultimately, palmitate, which can subsequently undergo
  elongation and desaturation processes to yield a diverse array of FAs. These FAs
  can be modified to form diverse lipids including diacylglycerols (DAGs) and triacylglycerols
  (TAGs). TAGs are stored in lipid droplets, which regulate lipid storage and release
  under metabolic demands. Additionally, the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, which
  is initiated by acetyl-CoA, proceeds through the formation of intermediate compounds
  such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and squalene, eventually leading to the production
  of cholesterol. Cholesterol contributes to membrane fluidity and steroid hormone
  synthesis, with excess cholesterol stored as cholesterol esters in lipid droplets.
  Importantly, these metabolic pathways altered in breast cancer cells, which is likely
  associated with cancer progression. Promising therapeutic targets are marked with
  orange lightning symbols. Created in https://BioRender.com
