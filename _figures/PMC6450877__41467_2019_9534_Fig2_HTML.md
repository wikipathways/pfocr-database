caption: Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is an intermediate in the formation of dehydro-F420-0.
  a Production of F420-0 in our revised biosynthesis pathway (left) compared to the
  currently accepted pathway (right). b Coupled-reaction high-performance liquid chromatography
  (HPLC) assays showing that both Mtb-FbiD and CofC from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii
  (Mj-CofC) enzymes use PEP to produce dehydro-F420-0. c Tandem mass spectral identification
  of dehydro-F420-0. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation of dehydro-F420-0,
  showing fragment ions with their corresponding structures. The inset displays the
  observed spectrum of the parent molecule (expected monoisotopic m/z 512.0711 [M − H]−)
