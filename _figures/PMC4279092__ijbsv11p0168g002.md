caption: Regulatory role of IL-27 in the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
  (A) IL-27 induced by Mtb infection modulates macrophage response. IL-27 inhibits
  autophagy by inducing negative regulator factors of autophagy mTOR and Mcl-1 through
  PI3K/AKT and PI3K, respectively. IL-27 induces IL-10 production through Stat1/Stat3,
  which in turn blocks phagosomal maturation. It also suppresses TNF-α and IL-12 via
  Stat3 and both cytokines required for augmenting IFN-γ production by macrophages.
  In addition, IL-27 targeting NF-kB to inhibit IL-18 mediated IFN-γ production. Suppression
  of IFN-γ led to down-regulation of V-ATPase and CD63 and Capethsin D (CD) and subsequently
  suppression of phagosomal acidification. (B) IL-27 induced IL-10-producing type
  1 regulatory T cells (Tr1) cell via Stat1/Stat3 and AhR/c-Maf pathway, which in
  turn suppress Th1 and Th17 cells. IL-27 directly inhibits Th17 cells by inhibiting
  ROR-γ expression and IL-6 signaling.
