caption: Model of the SPS-sensing pathway and the role of Asi1 in maintaining the
  latency of Stp1 and Stp2. (A) In the absence of inducing amino acids, the SPS sensor
  (Ssy1–Ptr3–Ssy5) of extracellular amino acids is present in the plasma membrane
  (PM) in its preactivation conformation (red). The transcription factors Stp1 and
  Stp2 are synthesized as inactive precursors that localize to the cytosol as a result
  of the presence of a cytoplasmic retention signal (anchor) that prevents the unprocessed
  full-length forms to efficiently enter the nucleus. In the absence of Asi1, full-length
  Stp1 and Stp2 enter the nucleus (dashed arrow) at rates sufficient to derepress
  amino acid permease (AAP) gene expression. The ability of Asi1 located in the inner
  nuclear membrane (NM) to prevent transcription is dependent on the nucleoplasmically
  oriented COOH-terminal RING motif (blue box) and on the presence of the sequences
  of Stp1 and Stp2 (Region I) in the NH2-terminal regulatory domain (red and white
  box). Consequently, there are low levels of amino acid permeases in the plasma membrane.
  (B) In the presence of inducing amino acids, the SPS sensor is activated (green),
  leading to the endoproteolytic processing of Stp1 and Stp2 (scissors). The shorter
  activated forms of Stp1 and Stp2 are efficiently targeted to the nucleus (solid
  arrow), where they bind SPS sensor–regulated promoters (DNA-binding domains; green
  boxes) and induce their transcription. The increased transcription of amino acid
  permease genes results in a concomitant increase in amino acid permeases in the
  plasma membrane, and cells exhibit induced rates of amino uptake.
