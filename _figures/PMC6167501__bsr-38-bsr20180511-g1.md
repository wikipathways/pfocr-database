caption: (A) In regular conditions, ligands such as growth factors or mitogens bind
  to the RTK, which is activated by autophosphorylation. Phosphotyrosine residues
  recruit adaptor protein Grb2 and Sos, promoting Ras:GTP association. Activated by
  GAPs such as NF1, Ras hydrolyzes GTP and activates Raf, the first effector kinase
  in the MAPK pathway. Raf then phosphorylates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates ERK.
  p-ERK activates cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates. (B) In melanoma cells, mutations
  in Ras may impair its capacity to hydrolyze GTP, therefore remaining activated.
  Loss of function mutations on NF1 are involved in the same mechanism, promoting
  sustained Ras:GTP association. Mutations in B-Raf kinase are the most frequent in
  melanoma, causing continued phosphorylation of MEK and downstream targets. The pathway
  can be targetted at any level by specific inhibitors.
