caption: Injury to vascular tissues (including storage of vein graft in Normal Saline)
  leads to membrane disruption and ATP release. Extracellular ATP activates the P2X7R/p38MAPK
  pathway, leading to IL-1β production and inflammation. Activation of P2X7R leads
  to increased extracellular ATP via release from P2X7R channels/pores. Prolonged
  exposure to IL-1β leads to increased arginase II expression and activation of P38MAPK,
  which contributes to endothelial dysfunction and amplification of the response to
  injury.
