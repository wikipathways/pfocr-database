caption: PDE–PK composite site as the new target for drug discovery. (Center panel)
  The cyclic nucleotide binding domains (CNB) of protein kinase, the ‘receptor’ (R)
  and catalytic site of phosphodiesterase (‘PDE’, red) coupled in the presence of
  fluorescent analog of cyclic nucleotide (green diamond, cNMP*) to form an [RcNMP*–PDE]
  active complex (red circles plot). (Left pathway) The stability and activity of
  the complex were tested by addition of cyclic nucleotide substrates (purple) and
  resulted in the competitive displacement of the fluorescent analogs and leading
  to a catalytic active [Rsubstrate–PDE] complex. The displaced fluorescent analog
  of cAMP reassociates with PDE–PK complex resulting in increased FP (cyan plus plot).
  (Right pathway) Inhibitors (gray) bind to and block the active site and prevent
  composite site formation yielding an [RcNMP–PDE] inhibited complex as observed by
  no changes in FP (black circles plot).
