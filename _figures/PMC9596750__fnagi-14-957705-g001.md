caption: 'The strategies for inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in Parkinson’s
  disease (PD). The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia can be divided into
  the priming stage and activation stage. Various inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated
  or pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including fibrillar α-synuclein, can
  activate the NF-κB pathway to upregulate the expression of NLRP3 sensor protein,
  pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18. The inactive NLRP3 proteins then oligomerize upon activation
  by the various stimuli including potassium ion efflux, mitochondrial dysfunction,
  and related reactive oxygen species (ROS) release. These signals might be generated
  by, but not limited to, the phagocytosis of fibrillar α-synuclein. The activated
  NLRP3 proteins then trigger an assembly of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  containing a CARD (ASC), which subsequently activate pro-caspase 1. Activated caspase
  1 facilitates the maturation of pro-cytokines, leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine
  release. The released cytokines as well as fibrillar α-synuclein directly exocytosed
  by the microglia promotes neuronal death, leading to the release of more fibrillar
  α-synuclein, thus amplifying microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Potential
  target sites of NLRP3 activation in microglia include: ➀ targeting the NF-κB priming
  pathway to prevent the upregulation of NLRP3 and cytokines, however, this might
  be highly non-specific; ➁ directly targeting the inflammasome components and preventing
  its activation; ➂ targeting the downstream inflammasome effectors. The specific
  NLRP3 inhibitors mentioned in this work are indicated in red. **Anakinra and rilonacept
  indirectly inhibit IL-1β by binding to IL-1 receptors and serving as a decoy receptor
  for IL-1β, respectively.'
