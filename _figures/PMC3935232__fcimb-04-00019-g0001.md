caption: 'Proposed lipid II pathway in Chlamydiaceae. A complete cycle of lipid II
  biosynthesis, including translocation to the periplasm, processing and bactoprenol
  carrier recycling is required for coordinated function of the divisome machinery
  and modulation of Nod1 and Nod2 mediated host immune response to chlamydial muropeptides.
  Biosynthesis of lipid II takes place in the cytoplasm and at the inner leaflet of
  the cytoplasmic membrane. In two consecutive biosynthesis steps of L-Ala racemization
  and D-Ala ligation, catalyzed by GlyA and the MurC/Ddl fusion protein, the D-Ala-D-Ala
  dipeptide is produced. MurF adds the dipeptide to the nascent peptide chain to complete
  synthesis of the soluble precursor UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and to provide D-Ala-D-Ala
  moieties in the cell wall precursors for transpeptidation activity of the penicillin-binding
  proteins PBP2 and PBP3. Actin-ortholog MreB functionally organizes MurF, MraY, and
  MurG (Gaballah et al., ), the last three enzymes in lipid II biosynthesis, at the
  septum. The synthesized precursor is translocated to the periplasm and processed
  by the concerted activity of the PBP enzymes and amidase AmiA to allow for bactoprenol-P
  recycling. In the process, the rudimentary by-product found by Liechti et al. (),
  in which the peptide side chains are cross-linked by peptide bonds, might result
  (Ghuysen and Goffin, ) and released muropeptides might contribute to modulation
  of the host immune response (McCoy and Maurelli, ). Chlamydiaceae lack transglycosylases
  as well as endopeptidases and pyrophosphorylases described so far to link lipid
  II sugar units to form glycan chains, to cleave peptide bridges between cross-linked
  glycan chains and to dephosphorylate bactoprenol-PP, respectively. Moreover, the
  L-Glu racemase MurI is absent. Question marks and dashed arrows highlight steps
  of the pathway that remain to be clarified. (GlcNAc: N-acetylglucosamine; MurNAc:
  N-acetylmuramic acid).'
