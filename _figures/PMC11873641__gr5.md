caption: Interconnections of gut microbiome and obesity-associated cancer. The interplay
  between diet, adipose tissue, gut microbiota dysbiosis, immune system and intestinal
  permeability leads to the development of obesity-induced gastrointestinal cancer.
  High-fat diet induces alterations in gut microbiota composition (gut dysbiosis)
  that increases the population of LPS-producing bacteria in the gut. This results
  in the downregulation of the expression of TJ proteins, leading to increased permeability
  of intestinal epithelial cells. Consequently, the defective intestinal barrier increasingly
  translocate LPS as well as bacteria and viruses. In circulation, LPS binds to macrophages,
  triggering immune activation via TLR signaling pathways and an upsurge in the release
  of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, thus inducing inflammation. Additionally,
  gut dysbiosis induces hematopoietic dysfunction and metabolic alterations. Consumption
  of a high-fat diet promotes an increase in adipose tissue and fat mass as well as
  the risk of obesity, disrupting adipocyte function. This leads to increased release
  of leptin and resistin, which contribute to the amplification of inflammatory signaling
  pathways. All of these pathways contribute to the development of obesity-associated
  gastrointestinal cancers by creating an inflammatory environment conducive for tumorigenesis.
  Thus, this signifies the complex and interconnected relationship between diet, gut
  dysbiosis, obesity and GI cancers. IL-6, interleukin-6; LPS, liposaccharide; TJ,
  tight junctions; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha
