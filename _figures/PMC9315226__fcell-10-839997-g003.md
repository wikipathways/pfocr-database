caption: 'Adaptive resistance to ERK1/2 pathway inhibition through feedback relief,
  de-repression of RTKs and activation of ERK5. Activation of ERK1/2 cascade is controlled
  by homeostatic negative feedback loops operating at various levels including ERK1/2-dependent
  phosphorylation and inhibition of RAF and RTKs. When ERK1/2 signalling is inhibited
  by RAFi, MEK1/2i or ERK1/2i these inhibitory feedback loops are lost, resulting
  in reactivation of the pathway; this is manifest as rapid pathway “rebound” after
  initial pathway inhibition. Many of these same RTKs are also able to activate the
  ERK5 pathway, consequently loss of ERK1/2 activity can result in activation of the
  ERK5 pathway. This is seen in: KRAS-mutant PDAC, where inhibition of ERK1/2 results
  in activation of EGFR and SRC-dependent activation of ERK5; BRAF-mutant melanoma
  where inhibition of ERK1/2 results in activation of IGF-1R and thence ERK5 and in
  NRAS-mutant melanoma where inhibition of MEK1/2 results in activation of PDGFRβ
  and thence ERK5. In such cases, co-administration of ERK1/2 pathway therapeutics
  and ERK5i may be indicated.'
