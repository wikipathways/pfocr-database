caption: 'A schematic overview of insulin signaling and glucose utilization pathways
  in the brain. Glucose enters the cell through the synergistic action of a variety
  of GLUTs and is further catalyzed by different enzymes. However, the most important
  factor regulating glucose transport is insulin and its receptors. Insulin promotes
  the activation of IR through autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues,
  which can bind to IRS-1/2 and activate it, thereby regulating the cascade of energy
  metabolism signals, such as the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signal pathway. In the brains of early
  AD patients with MCI, alterations in the gene expression profiles will lead to increased
  insulin consumption. The symptoms of cerebral diabetes, such as decreased glucose
  metabolism and energy exhaustion, have been found in MCI samples. The decrease in
  glucose metabolism may aggravate the impairment of cognitive function. Furthermore,
  the brain in the early stage of AD under diabetic conditions can aggravate the symptoms
  of peripheral diabetes. The biochemical diagram of the changes in normal intracellular
  glucose catabolism and ATP synthesis includes the glycolysis pathway that initially
  occurs in the cytoplasm, the TCA cycle and OXPHOS pathway that occurs in the mitochondria,
  and the PPP, which provides raw materials for biosynthesis and regulates redox.
  Changes in these biological processes in the AD brain are shown by the following
  symbols: (+), increased expression; (–), decreased expression. The structural and
  functional disorders of mitochondria eventually lead to decreased ATP production,
  increased ROS production, and the occurrence of oxidative stress. Moreover, further
  mitochondrial damage will also lead to a vicious cycle that aggravates neurodegeneration.
