caption: Hcy (demethylated Methionine) can enter the remethylation cycle with the
  aid of Folic Acid (5-Methyl-tetrahydrofolate) and the Folate cycle, the enzyme Methionine
  Synthase, and the necessary Cofactor B12. Folic Acid in addition to being a methyl-donor
  can serve as an electron or hydrogen donor to restore the required BH4 Cofactor
  to recouple the eNOS enzyme necessary for the production of eNO from L-arginine.
  Hcy may also enter the Transsulfuration Pathway with the assistance of Cystathionine
  Beta Synthase (CBS) enzyme and the necessary Cofactor B6 to form Cystathionine and
  Cysteine which can then be excreted in the urine or converted to the very important
  antioxidant Glutathione. The substrate Folic Acid and the Cofactors B6 and B12 are
  very important not only for improving hyperhomocysteinemia but also important for
  the recoupling of the BH4 cofactor to the eNOS enzyme for the production of eNO.
