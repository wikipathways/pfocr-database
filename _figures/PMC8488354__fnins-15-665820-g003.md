caption: Neuroprotective signaling pathways stimulated by the mAChRs. M1, M3, and
  M5 mAChRs are associated with the Gq/11 subfamily of G proteins, which are responsible
  for the increase of cytosolic Ca2+, activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and protein
  kinase C (PKC), which leads to the production of signaling molecules inositol triphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Acetylcholine (ACh) activation of the M2 and M4
  receptors, which are associated with the Gi/o subfamily of G proteins, increases
  the opening time of potassium channels and decreases the production of adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic
  monophosphate (cAMP). Besides, the stimulation of the M1 mAChRs by agonists or ACh
  increases the production of sAPPα and decreases the production of amyloid Aβ peptide.
  Protein kinase C (PKC) and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2
  are involved in this process by activating α-secretases. The activation of the M1
  mAChRs counteracts Aβ-induced neurotoxicity via the Wnt signaling pathway, as Aβ
  inhibits this pathway through the destabilization of β-catenin. In contrast, stimulation
  of M1 mAChR inactivates glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3β) via PKC activation, thus
  stabilizing β-catenin and inducing the expression of the Wnt-targeting and cyclin-D1
  genes for neuronal survival.
