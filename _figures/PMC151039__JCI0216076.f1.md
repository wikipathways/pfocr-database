caption: '(a) The classical pathway for bile acid synthesis begins with CYP7A1, which
  converts cholesterol into 7α-hydroxycholesterol. This pathway mainly produces cholic
  acid in humans. (b) Alternate pathways for bile acid synthesis. Cholesterol is first
  converted into oxysterols by one of three different enzymes: sterol 27-hydroxylase
  (CYP27), expressed in multiple tissues including liver; cholesterol 25-hydroxylase,
  present at low levels in multiple tissues including heart, lung, and kidney; and
  cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46), expressed predominantly in the brain. Oxysterols
  are transported through the bloodstream to the liver, where they are 7α-hydroxylated
  by oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) in the case of 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol
  and by CYP39A1 in the case of 24-hydroxycholesterol. Alternate pathways preferentially
  produce chenodeoxycholic acid in humans.'
