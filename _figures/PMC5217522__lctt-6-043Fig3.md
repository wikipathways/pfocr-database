caption: 'Experimental strategies to inhibit Notch receptors.Notes: The most commonly
  used pan-Notch inhibitors have been γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs). Most GSIs target
  the γ-secretase protease component presenilin (1 or 2), which has aspartic-type
  endopeptidase activity and it is believed to represent the γ-secretase subunit that
  catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of integral membrane proteins. Several GSIs
  have been experimented in Phase I–III clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease and
  cancers of different origin. GSIs cannot be considered specific Notch inhibitors,
  since γ-secretases cleave a large number of cellular proteins. Fully humanized monoclonal
  antibodies (mAbs) targeting the domain of interaction between NotchEC and Notch™
  (mAb anti NRR in the figure) promise a great level of specificity, but they are
  yet to proceed into clinical trials since their last publication of Notch-specific
  inhibitory antibodies in 2010. Antibodies blocking the interaction domain of specific
  Notch receptor isoforms with Notch ligands (mAb A6 targets Notch-1), various forms
  of Notch soluble ligands or decoy peptides have been used in experimental settings
  only.Abbreviations: MamL, Mastermind-like; NRR, negative regulatory region.'
