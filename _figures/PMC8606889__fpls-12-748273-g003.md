caption: Biosynthetic pathway of abscisic acid (ABA) in the developing seeds of Samgwang
  grown on reclaimed land (RL) and verification of upregulated genes through qRT-PCR.
  ↑ indicates upregulation. The Log2FC (FC, fold change) expresses the Log2 value
  of a ratio of expression value of RL to that of normal land (NL; RL/NL), which was
  generated by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR, respectively, from the developing seeds of Samgwang.
  The significant difference for each dataset was determined by t-test.
