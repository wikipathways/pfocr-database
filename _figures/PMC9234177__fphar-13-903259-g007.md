caption: 'The comparison between the effects of allicin and DATS against digestive
  system cancers in vivo. The figure summarizes the different anticancer effects of
  allicin and DATS in vivo. Firstly, allicin and DATS have four consistent anticancer
  effects, including reducing tumor weight and volume, inducing apoptosis, inhibiting
  tumor invasion and metastasis, and enhancing tumor cell chemosensitivity. Both compounds
  can induce apoptosis by regulating apoptosis-related proteins. In addition, allicin
  can also induce apoptosis, inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis by inhibiting STAT3,
  and enhance tumor chemosensitivity through ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. However,
  DATS induces apoptosis by activating MAPK pathway and destroying cell microstructure,
  and inhibit invasion and metastasis by down regulating MMP-9 and up regulating E-cadherin.
  Allicin also has two more effects: enhancing the radiotherapy sensitivity of tumor
  cells and activating T cells and NK cells with the participation of recombinant
  interleukin-2. DATS has one more effect: increasing the expression of cytokines,
  including IL-12 and IFN-γ, TNF-α, to stimulate the immune response of the host.'
