caption: Medicinal plants and bioactive compounds that exert a protective effect through
  modulation of the nuclear factor kappa B(NF-κB) pathway. Activation of either the
  tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR-1) by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or Toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR-4) by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) leads to the
  recruitment of IkappaB kinase α (IKKα) and IkappaB kinase β (IKKβ). These enzymes
  free NF-κB from its sequestration in the cytosol. The tumor necrosis factor receptor
  type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) scaffold recruits Fas-associated death domain
  (FADD) that activates caspase 8, leading to the truncation of BH3-interacting domain
  (BID) to form tBID. Truncated BID (tBID) activates BCL2-associated X protein (BAX)
  and BCL2-antagonist/killer 1 (BAK) mitochondrial translocation and release of cytochrome
  c that activates effector caspases. Genistein exerts a protective effect through
  the inhibition of activation of TNFR-1. Berberine inhibits the recruitment of the
  NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) complex to TNFR-1 and reduces the activation of
  NF-κB. Proanthocyanins inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)-mediated
  activation of NF-κB. Phylanthus niruri, Vinga angularis, caffeic acid, bee venom,
  ursolic acid, naringenin, apigenin, genistein, rutin, and betulinic acid reduce
  the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. As a consequence, the transcription
  and release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α
  (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β(IL-1β), and monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1 (MCP-1) are reduced.
