caption: (A) Schematic diagram of the interaction of HH signalling on p53 and Nanog.
  Activating interactions are indicated by green arrows and inhibition is indicated
  by red symbols. The effect of HH or the HH agonist SAG are indicated by yellow arrows
  next to the molecules, whereas the effect of HH pathway inhibitors (Cyclopamine,
  siSMO) is symbolized with grey arrows. (B) Nanog promotes clonogenicity and proliferation
  of gliomas, and probably also has a function in the maintenance of stemness in the
  stem cell niche of the subventricular zone. (C) Nanog controls stemness in cerebellar
  stem cells and in medulloblastoma cancer (stem) cells. The developing cerebellum
  is illustrated on a time axis relevant for the mouse brain. Darker colours indicate
  higher proliferation, and circles symbolize postmitotic cells in panels (B, C).
  VZ, ventricular zone; Ep, ependymal layer; GCP, granule cell precursor; IGL, internal
  granule layer; NSC, neural stem cell; PC, Purkinje cells.
