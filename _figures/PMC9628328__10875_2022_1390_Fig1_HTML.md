caption: 'Canonical pathway of NF-κB signaling. Upon binding of ligands, such as IL-1
  to the IL-1R, LPS to TLR4, or diacylated lipopeptides like PAM2CSK4 to TLR2/6, the
  inflammatory signaling is mediated via the myddosome complex which consists of MyD88
  and IRAK family kinases. MyD88 associates with IRAK4 via a homophilic interaction
  between their death domains. IRAK4 induces the phosphorylation of IRAK1. The hyperphosphorylated
  IRAK1 then dissociates from the complex and associates with TRAF6 to activate TAK-1/TAB
  complex. The latter enhances the activity of the IKK complex which then leads to
  phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. Thereby, NF-κB dimers such as p65 (RelA)
  and p50 are activated and migrate into the nucleus which results in gene transcription
  and the induction of inflammatory cytokines. (Adapted from Heller S, Kölsch U, Magg
