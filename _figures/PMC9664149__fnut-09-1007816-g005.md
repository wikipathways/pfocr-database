caption: 'Cellular glutathione synthesis and recycling: The importance of the γ-glutamyl
  pathway. The degradation or catabolic part of the GSH cycle, takes place partially
  extracellularly and partially inside cells. (1) The extracellular degradation of
  GSH occurs on the surface of the cells that express the enzyme γ-glutamyl transpeptidase
  (GGT) and the dipeptidases found in the external plasma membrane. Following plasma
  membrane carrier-mediated GSH release from the cell, GSH becomes accessible to the
  active site of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, which catalyzes GSH breakdown into γ-glutamyl
  fraction and cysteinyl-glycine by transferring the γ-glutamyl fraction to an amino
  acid acceptor, forming γ-glutamyl-amino acid. The cysteinyl-glycine fraction is
  split by the enzyme dipeptidase generating cysteine and glycine. (2) The γ-glutamyl-amino
  acid can be metabolized to release the amino acid and 5-oxoproline, which can then
  be converted into glutamate to be used in the synthesis of GSH. (3) The cells incorporate
  cysteine and most of the intracellular cysteine is used for the synthesis of GSH.
  Cysteine can be used for protein synthesis and part can be degraded to sulfate and
  taurine. The cycle γ-glutamyl allows GSH to be used as a continuous source of cysteine.
  The γ-glutamyl amino acid is taken up by cells through a specific transport mechanism.
  Cysteinyl glycine is also taken up by cells. Inside the cell, the γ-glutamyl amino
  acid is hydrolyzed by γ-glutamyl cyclo-transferase and converted into oxoproline,
  a cyclic form of glutamate converted into glutamate via oxoprolinase, and a free
  amino acid.'
