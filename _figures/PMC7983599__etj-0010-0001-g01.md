caption: Central and peripheral actions of thyroid hormones (TH) on adipose tissues.
  Cold exposure activates the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and norepinephrine
  (NE) release. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-expressing neurons in the paraven­tricular
  nucleus (PVN) are activated upon cooling, leading to augmented sympathetic outflow
  and increased TH release via the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. T3 administration
  in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) further activates SNS by inhibition
  of AMPK phosphorylation. NE and T3 act in a synergistic manner to regulate metabolic
  activity. White adipose tissue (WAT) is regulated by circulating T3, as T4-converting
  deiodinase 2 (DIO2) is suppressed by liver X receptor (LXR). T3 enhances NE-induced
  lipolysis by increasing the number of β1,2-adrenergic receptors (β1,2-AR), postreceptor
  signaling, and expression of lipolytic enzymes as carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1α (CPT1α). Free fatty acids (FFA) serve as substrate and activator for thermogenesis
  in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here, intracellular T3 is regulated by DIO2 activity,
  which is activated in the course of β3-adrenergic activation or by bile acids via
  the G protein-coupled membrane bile acid receptor (TGR5). The inhibitor LXR is suppressed
  by the adipokine adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP). T3 and adrenergic
  stimulation interact to increase UCP1 gene expression and substrate delivery, promoting
  thermogenesis. TH receptor α (TRα) mediates synergistic effects of TH signaling
  and SNS, whereas TRβ modulates UCP1 expression. Adrenergic actions are mediated
  by the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Green, activation; red, inhibition.
