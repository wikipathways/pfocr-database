caption: 'Hypoxic environment directly and indirectly regulates bone metabolism via
  A HIF signaling and B gut microbiota. Note: (A) Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α
  mediates the regulation of the RANKL/OPG pathway via osteoblasts, while HIF-2α directly
  inducesTNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) expression, thereby promoting osteoclastogenesis.
  Additionally, the inactivation of PHD enzymes activates the NF-κB signaling pathway,
  leading to enhanced expression of inflammatory genes. Notably, NF-κB and HIF-1α
  exhibit mutual upregulation through a positive feedback loop. (B) Hypoxic conditions
  can result in a decreased abundance of intestinal microbiota associated with the
  synthesis of SCFAs, such as Ruminococcaceae and Trichospiraceae. The reduction in
  acetic acid may enhance osteocalcin secretion via an immune-mediated mechanism.
  Propionic acid and butyric acid increase osteocalcin levels and serum CTX-I, thereby
  contributing to bone loss. Additionally, hypoxia-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota
  compromises the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, allowing bacterial
  products to activate the NF-κB pathway through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). This
  leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α,
  which inhibit osteoblast activity and ultimately result in bone loss'
