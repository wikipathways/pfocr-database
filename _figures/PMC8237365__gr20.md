caption: Example of a living energy conversion material.S. cerevisiae coated with
  indium phosphide (InP) has been metabolically engineered for the light-driven overproduction
  of shikimic acid. To this aim, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway has been
  disrupted by deletion of the enzyme ZWF1 to reduce carbon loss in the form of CO2.
  However, the shikimic acid pathway required NADPH produced in the pentose phosphate
  pathway. To overcome this limitation, NADPH regeneration was compensated by the
  photogenerated electrons from InP nanoparticles, thus providing a carbon- and energy-efficient
  production system for shikimic acid. Aro1-D, pentafunctional aromatic enzyme; ARO1D920A,
