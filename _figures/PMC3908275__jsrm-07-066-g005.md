caption: 'Interaction of MSCs and HSCs. Various factors are involved in the cell-to-cell
  interaction between MSCs and HSCs with spatial and temporal complexity. HSCs attach
  to MSCs via adhesion molecules such as N-cadherin and b-integrins (ECM: extracellular
  matrix secreted from MSC-derived cells). Soluble cytokines from MSCs such as SCF,
  SDF1 and Ang1 support the growth and differentiation of HSCs through cognate receptors
  (Kit, CXCR4 and Tie2). When HSCs and MSCs are in close proximity, expression of
  Notch ligands (Jagged and Delta-like) is upregulated in MSCs by Wnt from HSCs, while
  that of Notch receptors is upregulated in HSCs by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) from MSCs
  and HSCs. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can further upregulate Notch
  receptor expression in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. The upregulated Notch
  signaling pathway induces the expression of downstream targets such as Hes1. The
  expression of bone morphogenic protein (BMP) is upregulated in MSCs by Shh signaling.
  Frizzled, Ptc/Smo, VEGFR, Alk: receptors for Wnt, Shh, VEGF and BMP, respectively.'
