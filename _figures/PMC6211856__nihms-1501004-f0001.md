caption: Various pathways leading to neuronal death are represented in this figure.
  Calpain-2 activation is shown downstream of NR2B and its associated RasGRF1, which
  leads to ERK activation and calpain-2 phosphorylation/activation. Several targets
  of calpain-2 are also represented, including the STEP/p38 pathway, which has long
  been shown to contribute to neuronal death. Calpain has often been shown to trigger
  apoptosis through the degradation/inactivation of several pro-survival proteins
  and the degradation/activation of pro-death proteins. Several studies have also
  linked calpain activation to the regulation of autophagy, which is generally considered
  to be a pro-survival mechanism, and a recent report clearly showed that calpain-2
  activation inhibits autophagy. Similarly, a calpain-cathepsin hypothesis for Alzheimer’s
  disease has been proposed, suggesting that calpain activation could elicit the release
  of lysosomal proteases in the cell cytosol, thus contributing to neuronal damage.
  Importantly, apoptotic pathways, autophagy and lysosomes are interacting with each
  other to provide a balance between cell survival and cell death. We previously reported
  that calpain, by truncating the C-terminal domain of mGluR1a eliminates the pro-survival
  effect of this receptor stimulation, while maintaining its pro-degenerating component,
  related to increase intracellular calcium release [].
