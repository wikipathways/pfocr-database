caption: Model illustrating the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis by sugar and
  ethylene signaling. With exogenous sucrose supplied, increased sucrose levels may
  enhance invertase activity (). Invertase can degrade sucrose into fructose and glucose,
  and generated glucose signaling/levels control YDA stability, which is due to glucose
  promoting YDA stability (). And TT8, in turn, may control invertase activity by
  YDA-EIN3-TT8 signal transduction pathway (). Thus, it appears to form a glucose
  signal loop for controlling sucrose-specifically depends on anthocyanin biosynthesis.
  This explains why anthocyanin biosynthesis specifically depends on sucrose. In a
  similar fashion, glucose signaling induces ethylene production, which also triggers
  the suppression of anthocyanin accumulation by the C2H4-Receptor-CTR1-EIN2-EIN3/EIL1
  signal pathway. Solid lines indicate direct regulation, whereas dotted lines indicate
  either indirect regulation or regulation in an unknown manner.
