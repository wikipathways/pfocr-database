caption: In the oral cavity, salivary α-amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch
  to produce maltopolysaccharides (MPS) and maltooligosaccharides (MOS), then the
  subsequent end products maltotriose and maltose. These saccharides, as well as other
  digestible sugars from the diet, are further hydrolyzed to monosaccharides by taste
  cell-expressed α-glucosidases. Sugars are thought to activate at least two distinct
  signaling pathways. One pathway is activated by the binding of sugars or nonnutritive
  sweeteners to a G protein-coupled receptor, T1R2+T1R3; this in turn activates the
  inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signaling cascade, resulting in neurotransmitter (ATP)
  release. Another pathway (inset), identified in mice, is thought to be activated
  when glucose diffuses through SGLT1 or one of the GLUTs in the cell membrane, and
  is then metabolized, yielding ATP. The ATP binds to KATP channels and blocks K+
  efflux; this causes membrane depolarization and neurotransmitter release, which
  sends signals to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) in the brainstem. These
  two pathways are thought to operate in distinct populations of taste cells ().
