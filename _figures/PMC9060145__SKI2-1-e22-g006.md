caption: Predicted inhibition of inflammatory and immune response pathways in healthy
  reconstructed human epidermis treated with DX308 and atRA. Ingenuity pathway analysis
  of all significantly differentially expressed transcripts (|fold‐change| ≥2 and
  FDR <0.05) revealed a predicted inhibition of (a) inflammatory and (b) immune response
  by 1000 nM DX308 cotreated with 1 nM atRA. atRA, all‐trans retinoic acid; FDR, false
  discovery rate
