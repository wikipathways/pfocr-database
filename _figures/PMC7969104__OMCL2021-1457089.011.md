caption: A schematic illustration of BAP31 regulating superoxide anion production
  and neuroinflammation in microglia. BAP31 deficiency upregulates LPS-induced superoxide
  anion and hydrogen peroxide production through p22phox and the keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
  pathway, excess superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide cooperate with inflammatory
  cytokine to induce the damage and death of neurons.
