caption: Working model of the signaling pathways involved in the radiation-induced
  bystander effect. Binding of TNF-α, TGFβ, IGF, IL-1, and IL-8 ligands to the corresponding
  receptors activate signaling pathways including MEK1/2; mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase (MKK3/6), and p38 kinase (all in blue lines), which lead to COX-2
  gene expression. Specific inhibitors of the various signaling pathways, such as
  Wortmannin (wt) for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and N-(α)-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethylketone
  hydrochloride for the NF-κB can be used to delineate specific signaling routes involved
  in the bystander phenomenon.
