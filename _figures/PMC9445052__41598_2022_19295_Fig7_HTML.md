caption: 'Summary schematic of hypothesized effects of mTOR inhibition during differentiation
  of myeloid cell populations in the presence of gram-negative bacterial components
  (E. coli lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Cows experience a nutrient deficit postpartum
  at the same time as immune dysfunction. We previously showed that the activation
  of the mTOR pathway is reduced in postpartum dairy cows. Summarized results are
  derived from in-vitro pharmacological mTOR inhibition with rapamycin (RAPA) or Torin-1
  (TR1) in monocyte derived macrophages (M1, M2), dendritic cells (moDC), and co-culture
  of moDC with autologous mixed lymphocytes (MLR). We propose that the inflammatory
  response during nutrient deficit associated mTOR-pathway inhibition may result in
  the following effects: (1) increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  and expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) in M1, (2) decreased pathogen clearance
  by phagocytosis in M1, (3) selective regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators in
  M1 (IL12A, IL12B, IL6, IL1β), (4) increased expression of pro-inflammatory, Th1-promoting
  cytokines in moDC (IL12A, IL12B, IL6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF) and a more
  potent activation of T cells by increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules
  (CD80) and cytokine profile changes (decreased IL10, increased TNF and IFNG) in
  moDC-MLR co-cultures, and (5) decrease in the M2 restorative phenotype hallmark
  features such as expression of arginase 2 (ARG2), surface CD163, and production
  of anti-inflammatory IL10. Overall, the observed changes indicate an inflammatory
  response that is heightened in magnitude and potentially in duration.'
