caption: Changes in glucose (purple pathway) or lipid (light blue pathway) metabolism
  may both lead to epigenetic modifications underlying cytokine expression. Metabolic
  switching towards aerobic glycolysis results in epigenetic modifications in innate
  immune cells and enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The role of glycolysis
  as a pathway that drives the induction of trained immunity in monocytes is demonstrated
  by the blockade of glycolysis by incubation of cells with 2-deoxy-d-giucose (2-DG).
  The pharmacological modulation of rate-limiting glycolysis enzymes with 2-DG inhibits
  the generation of histone marks underlying trained immunity. Oxidized low-density
  lipoprotein (oxLDL) induces trained immunity (light blue pathway). OxLDL-dependent
  activation of NLRP3 leads to trained immunity. CD36 internalization, cholesterol
  crystal formation and NLRP3 activation can be inhibited by cytochalasin D (CYTOD),
  methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and Z-VAD-FMK, respectively. The cholesterol synthesis
  pathway (yellow), through mevalonate, is linked to the induction of trained immunity.
  Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with fluvastatin downregulates H3K4 trimethylation
  (H3K4me3) and prevents the induction of trained immunity and the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Mevalonate induces trained immunity by epigenetic reprograming of macrophages,
  which is prevented by inhibitors of enzymes downstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme
  A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMG-CoAi). In trained immunity, the most widely studied pattern
  recognition receptors (PRRs) are the C-type lectin receptor dectin 1 (REF.) (dark
  blue pathway), which is involved in antifungal immunity and can be activated by
  β-glucan, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2;
  green pathway), which recognizes bacterial molecules, such as muramyl dipeptide
  (MDP). Dectin 1-mediated macrophage activation induces specific epigenetic marks
  that lead to trained immunity. This pathway is inhibited by metformin, rapamycin
  and ascorbate, which target AKT, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α (HIFlα), respectively. Peptidoglycan (PepG) is a pathogen-associated molecular
  pattern (PAMP) that synergizes with endotoxin to cause the release of inflammatory
  cytokines,. MDP is the smallest PepG-derived molecular structure that can engage
  NOD2 (REF.). NOD2 activation and signalling through nuclear factor (NF)-κB stimulates
  epigenetic rewiring of macrophages and induces trained immunity. This activation
  of macrophages is inhibited by butyrate, which prevents histone acetylation. Finally,
  certain cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF),
  can induce trained immunity, resulting in increased tumour necrosis factor (TNF)
  production upon subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. This process is
  dependent on MAPKs, ERK1 and ERK2 (REF.). H3K18ac, H3K18 acetylation; H3K27ac, H3K27
  acetylation; HATi, histone acetyl transferase inhibitor; HDACi, histone deacetylase
  inhibitor; HMTi, histone methyltransferase inhibitor; IL, interleukin.
