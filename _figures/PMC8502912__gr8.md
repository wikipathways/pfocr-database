caption: Summary illustration of the signaling pathways for LPA induction of TF expression
  in SMCs. LPA initiates its signaling pathways through LPA1 and activates intracellular
  PKDs. Activation of PKD2 further activates downstream p38α and JNK2, leading to
  induction of TF expression. The previous reported LPA-induced MEK1/2-ERK pathway
  () is found to be PKD-independent, but cross talks with JNK, contributing to TF
  expression.
