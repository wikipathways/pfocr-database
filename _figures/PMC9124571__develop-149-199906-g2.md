caption: Immune cell-cell interactions within the damaged heart are crucial for limiting
  scarring during heart repair. A key feature in the transition from an inflammatory
  response to permanent fibrosis or regeneration is the crosstalk between the many
  different immune cell types that populate the heart. Upon cardiac injury, paracrine
  signaling occurring between resident cardiac cells (e.g. cardiomyocytes, CCR2− macrophages
  and mast cells) and infiltrating populations (e.g. neutrophils and CCR2+ monocytes
  and macrophages) determines the kinetics of immune responses and ultimately cardiac
  output and function following injury. Recruited neutrophils contribute to their
  own clearance, and therefore resolution of inflammation, by expressing NGAL, a marker
  that promotes the phagocytic capacity of monocyte-derived CCR2+ Ly6Chigh pro-inflammatory
  macrophages. Upon ingestion of apoptotic neutrophils, CCR2+ Ly6Chigh monocyte-derived
  macrophages increase production of anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines
  (e.g. IL10 and TGFβ) and subsequently downregulate expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g. IL1β and TNFα). This signaling cascade promotes in situ differentiation
  into CCR2+ Ly6Clow macrophages and contributes to resolution of tissue inflammation.
  Phagocytosing macrophages also decrease IL23 expression, which reduces IL17A production
  by γδ T cells. Whereas γδ T cells and neutrophils release IL17A within the damaged
  myocardium to increase neutrophil production and recruitment to the injured heart,
  decreased IL17A expression reduces neutrophil accumulation, which dampens inflammation
  and improves tissue healing overall. CCR2+ Ly6Clow pro-reparative macrophages contribute
  to tissue repair by directly depositing collagen into the fibrotic scar and by activating
  collagen-depositing myofibroblasts via TGFβ. This pro-fibrotic repair is promoted
  by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through an IFNγ-dependent pathway, but counterbalanced
  by eosinophil and NK cell inhibition of collagen overproduction by myofibroblasts.
