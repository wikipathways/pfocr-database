caption: S-palmitoylation is involved in the regulation of multiple cellular signal
  transduction pathways. We summarised several crucial and well-established signalling
  pathways that are under the control of S-palmitoylation. The majority of proteins
  are subjected to S-palmitoylation at the ER or Golgi by the respective DHHC-PATs.
  Some protein substrates could traffic from the ER to the Golgi or Golgi to the plasma
  membrane after being palmitoylated to activate the corresponding signalling cascades
  (e.g., EGFR pathway, N-Ras/H-Ras pathway, GPCR pathway, AGK-Akt-mTORC1 pathway,
  STING pathway and LRP6 pathway). In some cases, protein substrates anchor at the
  original organelle after being palmitoylated. Once S-palmitoylation is blocked,
  these protein substrates detach from the original organelle to abnormally activate
  the corresponding signalling pathway (e.g., SCRIB pathway and FLT3-ITD pathway).
  In addition to regulating protein trafficking, some proteins are protected from
  degradation in lysosomes after being palmitoylated to further activate the corresponding
  signalling pathway (e.g., Fas pathway and PD-L1 pathway). In addition, S-palmitoylation
  can regulate the activation of signalling pathways by regulating protein‒protein
  interactions (e.g., the PCSK9-PI3K-Akt pathway). Furthermore, some protein substrates
  are under dynamic palmitoylation-depalmitoylation regulation, abnormally activating
  signalling pathways by increasing palmitate turnover (e.g., the STAT3 pathway).
