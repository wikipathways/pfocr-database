caption: (a) The role of Notch signaling in macrophage polarization. Notch signaling
  promotes M1 macrophage polarization by synthesizing IRF8 and NF-κB and inhibits
  M2 macrophage polarization by downregulating JMJD3. (b) The Notch signaling pathway.
  The Notch ligands (Dll1, Dll3, and Dll4 and Jag1 and Jag2) bind to the Notch receptors
  (Notch 1–4). Upon ligand binding to the Notch receptor, proteolytic cleavage takes
  place (via α-secretase) in Notch receptor, resulting in the release of NICD. The
  NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds to RBP-J, resulting in the release of
  IRF8 and NF-κB. The GIT1 inhibits the Notch1-Dll4 mediated signaling. Dll, delta
  like; GIT1, G protein-coupled receptor-kinase interacting protein-1; IRF8, interferon
  regulatory factor 8; Jag, Jagged; JMJD3, Jumonji domain-containing 3; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells; NICD, Notch intracellular
  domain; RBP-J, recombining binding protein suppressor of hairless. To see this illustration
