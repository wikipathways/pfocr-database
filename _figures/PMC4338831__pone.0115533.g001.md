caption: Modeled interactions of a single xenobiotic (X) with Phase 0-III effector
  enzymes and regulators. Solid arrows represent transport through membranes or biochemical
  reactions. Dashed arrows denote regulation including multi-step transcriptional
  and translational regulation (gray) and more direct interaction (black), such as
  binding of a drug to nuclear receptors. ABC0 and ABCIII symbolize general Phase
  0 and Phase III efflux transporters, respectively. CYP and GST represent a Phase
  I oxidase (a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily) and a Phase II GSH transferase,
  respectively. NR symbolizes a general xenobiotic nuclear receptor, while Nrf2 denotes
  a specific transcription factor. (GST, ABCIII and Nrf2 are duplicated to increase
  clarity of the figure. Regulatory arrows are not duplicated.) Letters ‘c’ and ‘e’
  indicate cytoplasmic and extracellular localization, respectively. X’c is the CYP-oxidized
  cytoplasmic metabolite of Xc. X”c is the glutathione-conjugated form of X’c. X’bc
  represents reactive species produced by normal cell metabolism. X’bc is metabolized
  by the same pathway as X’c. Negative feedback loops are Xc → NR → CYP —| Xc, X’c
  (and X’bc) → Nrf2 → GST —| X’c (and X’bc), Xc → NR → ABC0 —| Xc, Xc → NR → Nrf2
  → ABC0 —| Xc, where → denotes activation and —| denotes inhibition. Feedforward
  loops are Xc → NR → GST —| X’c, Xc → NR → ABCIII —| X”c (‘direct’ regulation) and
  Xc → NR → Nrf2 → GST —| X’c, Xc → NR → Nrf2 → ABCIII —| X”c (‘indirect’ regulation).
