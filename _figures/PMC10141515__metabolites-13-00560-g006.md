caption: Differentially expressed proteins of the serine metabolic pathway in ovarian
  cancer. Schematic representation of the serine metabolic pathway that highlights
  the differentially regulated genes in ovarian cancer (ASCT1; underexpressed, SHMT2;
  overexpressed, PSPH; overexpressed, PSAT1; overexpressed, PHGDH; overexpressed).
  Boxplot derived from TGCA expression datasets with tumor (red) and control (gray).
  * Represents statistical significance of p < 0.05.
