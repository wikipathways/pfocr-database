caption: A schematic diagram shows key molecular pathways involved in the penetration
  of LPS induced by high-fat diet. Consumption of high-fat diets increases the penetration
  of LPS, which induces low-grade chronic inflammation; Consumption of high-fat diets
  inhibit the secretion of MUC2 by activating the IRE1/XPB-1 signaling pathway in
  goblet cells; Fatty acids assist in the cellular internalization of LPS and then
  activate its intracellular signaling pathway depending on CD36 in intestinal epithelial
  cells.
