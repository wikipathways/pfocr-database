caption: The HOG-MAPK pathway. The HOG-MAPK pathway is responsible for conidia stress
  tolerance. SskA is the final receptor of the TcsB-YpdA-SskA two-component signaling
  system and is the key activator of SskB (MAPKKK). Pbs2 (MAPKK) is activated by SskB.
  MpkC (MAPK) and SakA (MAPK) are the main effectors of the HOG pathway, activated
  by Pbs2. SakA and MpkC are involved in activating the CWI pathway. Transcription
  factor AtfA and the hypothetical osmotic stress regulator OsrA are activated by
  SakA. DprA and DprB are involved in the protection against oxidative, osmotic, and
  pH stress. DprC is involved in the protection against freeze stress.
