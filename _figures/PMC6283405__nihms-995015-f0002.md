caption: Isoprenoid pathway for the production of biobased diesel and jet fuels. (a)
  Acetyl-CoA generates the building blocks for isoprenoid production through the mevalonate
  pathway. (b) Farenyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) synthesizes feranyl pyrophosphate
  (FPP) from two IPP and one DMAPP. Farnesene and bisabolene are synthesized by their
  respective synthases from FPP. Hydrogenation of each molecule produces biodiesel
  fuel candidates. (c) Geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS), converts an IPP and
  DMAPP molecule to geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP). Limonene and pinene are synthesized
  by limonene and pinene synthase, respectively. Chemically dimerized pinene and hydrogenated
  limonene are biobased jet fuel candidates.
