  Up-regulated UHRF2 silences SIRT4 expression, and SIRT4 negatively regulates aerobic

  of JWA was achieved through the AMPK/FOXO3a/FAK signaling pathway, an inhibition
  on both glycolysis and cancer migration. Blue line: KRAS can activate the protein
  kinase ERK signaling pathway, and in turn mediate intranuclear expression and promote
  glycolysis. Small-molecule KRAS inhibitors can act on KRAS.'
