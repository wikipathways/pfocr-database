caption: ROS regulation of signaling pathways in cancer. ROS has been demonstrated
  to regulate signaling pathways in cancer. Increase in ROS such as H2O2 activates
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through the inhibition of PTEN, resulting in constitutive
  activation of PI3K/Akt that contributes to cell survival and proliferation in cancer.
  Similarly, ASK-1, a kinase in the MAPK signaling cascade, is displaced from Trx-ASK1
  complex under oxidative stress. ASK-1 subsequently activates downstream p38 and
  JNK, leading to apoptosis and autophagy. Redox-mediated inactivation of PP2A was
  reported to sustain NF-κB activation, Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser70, and Myc phosphorylation
  at Ser62, leading to cell migration and invasion, inhibition of DNA damage and cell
  proliferation, respectively. Figure created with biorender.com.

  description: ROS regulation of signaling pathways in cancer. ROS has been demonstrated
    to regulate signaling pathways in cancer. Increase in ROS such as H2O2 activates
    PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through the inhibition of PTEN, resulting in constitutive
