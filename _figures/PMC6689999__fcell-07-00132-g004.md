caption: Thy-1-induced astrocyte adhesion and migration. In astrocytes, Thy-1/CD90
  binding to integrin microclusters induces receptor oligomerization and leads to
  the formation of bigger clusters and integrin activation. Integrin then recruits
  signaling molecules, such as PLCγ. Active PLCγ hydrolyzes PIP2, generating diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and IP3. The latter activates the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)
  to allow the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER lumen is shown). Increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration opens the hemichannels
  (Connexin 43 and Pannexin 1), leading to the consequent release of ATP to the extracellular
  medium. Locally increased ATP concentration activates P2X7 receptors, which allow
  Ca2+ entry into the cell. This signaling pathway is part of a more complex cascade
  of reactions leading to cell polarization, adhesion and migration [more details
  in  and ].
