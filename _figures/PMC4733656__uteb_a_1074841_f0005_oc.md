caption: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. The pathway is activated by
  binding of the AHR to ligands that include dioxin-like chemicals (DLCs) and some
  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This allows for dimerization with the AHR
  nuclear transporter (ARNT) that forms the transcriptionally active complex that
  binds to xenobiotic response elements (XRE) and thereby upregulates the transcription
  of a number of proteins including enzymes involved in biotransformation, indicated
  here, as well as the AHR repressor (AHRR) that provides negative feedback of the
  pathway. Hsp90, XAP2, and p23 are chaperone proteins; SRC-1 and p300 are examples
  of co-regulator proteins involved in transcription. © McGraw-Hill Education. Reproduced
