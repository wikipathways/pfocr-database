caption: Molecular mechanism underlying melatonin’s anabolic effect on bone density.
  Melatonin binding to its G-protein coupled receptor (MT2R), located on the cell
  membrane of hMSCs and pre-osteoblasts, induces a signaling cascade that leads to
  the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2 and, favoring (green arrows) cell proliferation
  and the upregulation of factors involved in cell differentiation via Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. The factors involved in controlling the bone formation and osteoblasts
  and osteocyte differentiation from precursor cell lines are bone morphogenetic proteins
  2 and 4 (BMPs), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteocalcin (OCN).
