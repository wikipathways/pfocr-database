caption: Summary diagram showing potential points in endometrial cell signaling pathways
  which may be influenced by BVDV infection. (A) Many cell types respond to viral
  infection by production of type 1 interferons. IFNA and IFNB have similar structure
  and biological actions to the bovine pregnancy recognition factor IFNT. All three
  type 1 IFNs bind to interferon alpha and beta receptor subunits 1 and 2 (IFNAR1
  and IFNAR2) to initiate cell signaling via the Janus activated kinases (JAKs) and
  tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) pathways. This phosphorylates STAT1 and STAT2, which then
  dimerise and combine with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form interferon
  stimulatory gene factor 3 gamma (ISGF3G) which translocates to the nucleus and activates
  interferon stimulated response elements (ISRE) to induce transcription of ISGs.
  We showed previously that ncpBVDV-1 infection of endometrial cells inhibited transcription
  of IFNAR1, IFNAR2, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 (). Inhibition of this pathway will
  reduce transcription of most ISGs, as confirmed in the present study. ISGs shown
  in green were inhibited by ncpBVD-1 whereas TRIM56, shown in red, was stimulated.
  Possible effects of these changes in gene transcription on processes important for
  placental establishment are suggested (, ). (B) In order to infect cells, BVDV is
  taken up by endocytosis and incorporated into the endosome, where it may be sensed
  by TLR3 or TLR7/8. For replication to occur, viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm
  where it can be detected by the pattern recognition receptors DDX58, which recognizes
  ssRNA, and IFIH1, which targets dsRNA during the RNA replication phase. TLR and
  PRR then signal via TNF receptor associated factors 3 and 6 (TRAF3, TRAF6) and IRF3
  or IRF7 to increase transcription of type 1 IFN. Virus encoded Npro suppresses the
  type I IFN response by causing proteolysis of IRF3. TRIM56 is an E3 ligase which
  interacts with Npro to promote its anti-viral activity. Erns is a viral envelope
  glycoprotein with ribonuclease activity which can degrade viral RNA mainly in endosomal
  compartments, so preventing activation of the TLR3 and TLR7 signaling pathways.
  GBP4 is an IFN-induced GTPase which can disrupt TRAF6 mediated polyubiquitination
  of IRF7, a prerequisite for IRF7 activation (). We show here that basal expression
  of DDX58 and GBP4 was inhibited and TRIM56 expression was stimulated by both KY
  and HO, but only HO was able to inhibit IFNT-stimulated transcription of GBP4 and
  IFIH1.
