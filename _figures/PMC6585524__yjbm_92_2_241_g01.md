caption: Photic signaling pathways involving main kinases activities in the circadian
  clock. The scheme depicts an SCN neuron of the retinorecipient region receiving
  retinohypothalamic (RHT) efferent photic stimulation. The neurotransmitters glutamate,
  BDNF and PACAP are released in response to light. Other neurotransmitters released
  from SCN neurons such as VIP, NGF, and GRP (not shown) also participate. Ca2+/cAMP
  dependent pathways PKG, PKA, and ERK, requires convergent activation of their corresponding
  upstream receptors (NMDAr, PAC1, VPAC2, and TRKB. Except for PKG, whose downstream
  effectors are still unknown, the photic activation of these pathways converge to
  CREB phosphorylation for its nuclear translocation and interaction at CRE elements
  for the induction of immediate-early genes (e.g., c-Fos, c-Myc) and clock genes
  Per1-2 and Cry1-2 (not shown). mTOR, GSK, and CKI signaling affect the circadian
  machinery by direct regulation on stability and half-life of clock proteins. mTORC1
  signaling can enhance translation of CLOCK, CRY1, BMAL1, and SCN neurotransmitter
  VIP. Upstream mTOR regulators are unknown at the SCN. GSK-dependent phosphorylation
  of PER2, CRY2, BMAL1 and REV-ERBα (not shown) is constitutive, it is downregulated
  by a circadian phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle and contribute to degradation.
  CK1 activity respond to the circadian clock, as well as to glutamate-NMDAr photic
  pathway. Since the activity of CK1 is complex, the degradation pathway for PER was
  only included for the sake of simplicity. The figure also summarizes part of the
  molecular clockwork which generates the circadian output composed by interacting
  transcription/translation feedback loops of negative (PER:CRY) and positive (CLOCK:BMAL1)
  heterodimers inhibiting or activating transcription, respectively. Positive loop
  starts with CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer binding at E-boxes to promote transcription
  of Per1-2 and Cry1-2 clock genes, and also of the clock-controlled genes (CCGs)
  driving clock output. PERs and CRYs proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm and are
  phosphorylated at specific phosphosites. Then they dimerize and translocate to the
  nucleus, where they inhibit Clock and Bmal1 transcription generating the negative
  feedback loop each circadian cycle. Half-life of clock proteins determined by the
  accumulation/degradation ratio, contribute to the circadian period regulation. Black
  arrows indicates alosteric activation/increased levels; red circle indicate phosphorylation;
  degradation is indicated with a diamond; white arrows indicate translocation; red
  arrow, transcription.
