caption: 'The system is built on an elongated iron oxide NP (nanoworm; NW) scaffold,
  with multiple copies of a tandem peptide comprised of a homing peptide and a pro-apoptotic/cytotoxic
  peptide conjugated onto the surface of the NW. The tumor-homing peptide has two
  activities: the intact peptide binds to cell surface p32 on tumor vessel endothelium
  (and on tumor cells and tumor associated macrophages). The peptide is internalized
  into cells expressing cell surface p32 and transported to mitochondria. A truncated
  form of the peptide, created by proteolysis at the cell surface, subsequently binds
  to neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) through its CendR (R/KXXR/K) motif, which triggers a macropinocytosis-related
  transcytosis and trans-tissue transport pathway (CendR pathway). The NWs are swept
  into this pathway and out of the vasculature and into extravascular tumor tissue.
  The pro-apoptotic peptide serves the anti-cancer drug in the construct (see ref.
  for references).'
