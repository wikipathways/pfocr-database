caption: 'Single-cell transcriptome regulatory network of the tumor microenvironment
  (TME) and chemoresistance in cervical cancer. In total, 24,371cells were clustered
  into nine separate cell types, including immune cells (T cells, B cells, and myeloid)
  and non-immune cells [fibroblast cells and endothelial cells (ECs), epithelial cells,
  and smooth muscle cells]. Among these, fibroblast cells formed five distinct subtypes,
  and cluster 4 (C4) contained proliferative fibroblast cells enriched in cancer samples.
  ECs comprised two subclusters: C0 corresponded to tumor-associated ECs. T and B
  cells formed five and three subclusters, respectively, where C1 of T cells expressed
  higher levels of immune checkpoint molecules (PDCD1) than the other clusters did
  and C4 highly expressed proliferating cancer marker genes, MKI167 and BIRC5. Subpopulations
  of B cells were not strongly affected by drug resistance. Differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) between chemoresistant and chemosensitive patients were enriched in
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway involved in tumor development, progression,
  and apoptosis, which might lead to chemoresistance.'
