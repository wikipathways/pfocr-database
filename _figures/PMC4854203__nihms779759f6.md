caption: (A) Overview of the distribution of the 272 significant differentially regulated
  genes and their time dependency.(B) Activation of the BR signaling cascade (dashed
  arrows) triggered by binding of BRs to the membrane-localized BRI1 receptor. Through
  a still unknown mechanism, this signal is transported to the nucleus where it inhibits
  the BIN2 kinase. Bikinin acts by direct inhibition of the activity of the group
  II ASK family (red arrow). The inhibition of BIN2 kinase activity, either through
  an unknown signal after binding of BRs to the BRI1 receptor or after direct inhibition
  by bikinin, depletes the pool of phosphorylated BES1/BZR1 proteins. By the inhibition
  of BIN2 and the action of the BSU1 phosphatase, non-phosphorylated BES1/BZR1 proteins
  accumulate, which in turn activate the transcription of BR-related genes and the
  feedback inhibition on the BR biosynthesis.
