caption: The constitutive components and the transduced mechanisms of Hh signaling
  pathway. A. In the absence of Hh ligand, the latent Gli transcription factors Gli2/3
  are bound to a multiprotein complex with the negative regulator Sufu. Phosphorylation
  of Gli2/3 by PKA, GSK3β and CK1 targets latent Gli proteins to proteasome-dependent
  repressor formation (Rep-Gli2/Gli3) that cannot activate target gene transcription
  upon binding to DNA in the nucleus; B. Upon binding of Hh ligand to its receptor
  Ptch, Ptch translocates out of the primary cilium, losing its ability to inhibit
  Smo, which moves into the cilium, thus stimulating the pathway and preventing Gli2
  and Gli3 cleavage. The activated forms of Gli2 and Gli3 bind to Gli-promoters in
  the nucleus and stimulate transcription of the ubiquitous mammalian target genes
