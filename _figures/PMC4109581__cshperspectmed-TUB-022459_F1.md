caption: Host cell apoptosis pathways are classified into two main categories—extrinsic
  and intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway of cell death is triggered by the
  interaction of death receptors (DRs) with specific death ligands and involves activation
  of caspase 8. Intrinsic pathways are triggered by stimuli that target mitochondria
  and result in release of cytochrome c, which participates in apoptosome formation,
  a platform for caspase 9 activation. In addition, CD8+ T cells engage the extrinsic
  pathway via the Fas death receptor and the intrinsic pathway via perforin/granzyme
  secretion. Caspase 8 and 9 activate downstream effector caspases (caspase 3, 6,
  and 7), which leads to the characteristic features of apoptotic cells via activation
  of multiple targets. Apoptosis is immunologically silent as cellular material is
  enclosed within apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis of Mtb-infected cells results in packaging
  of mycobacterial antigens within apoptotic bodies that, when phagocytosed by dendritic
  cells, allow for antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells via cross-presentation and
  the induction of a robust adaptive immune response. Additionally, uptake of dying
  apoptotic cells by healthy macrophages or neutrophils (efferocytosis) leads to killing
  of bacteria. However, Mtb-mediated apoptosis induction was also reported to help
  in dissemination of bacteria during early phase of infection.
