caption: Regulation of ferroptosis and STAT signaling pathways by various compounds
  in cancer models. The figure illustrates the role of key signaling molecules, such
  as JAK2, STAT3, STAT1, and STAT6, in mediating responses to natural and synthetic
  compounds targeting different cancer types. Inhibition or activation of these pathways
  leads to alterations in lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis
