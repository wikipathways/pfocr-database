caption: 'a—schematic diagram of pathways by which maternal diabetes causes NTDs and
  CHDs. Maternal hyperglycemia causes increased glucose transport into embryo cells
  via GLUT2. Among the pathways by which increased glucose uptake causes oxidative
  stress (increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)) are as follows: increased glucose
  metabolism, including increased oxidative phosphorylation, which consumes oxygen
  faster than it can be replenished, leading to increased superoxide production; increased
  substrate for the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBSP), which inhibits generation
  of NADPH from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which decreases the reducing
  equivalents needed to generate reduced glutathione (GSH). Increased ROS stimulate
  activities of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B).
  Both increased AMPK and DNMT3B activities inhibit production of Pax3 mRNA, but it
  is not known if the effects of ROS on DNMT3B are mediated by phosphorylation by
  AMPK. Decreased Pax3 mRNA leads to decreased PAX3 protein levels. Because PAX3 stimulates
  p53 degradation, decreased PAX3 increases p53 stability. Increased p53 protein leads
  to cell cycle withdrawal, increased oxidative metabolism, decreased pluripotency,
  and potential changes in folate-dependent 1-Carbon (1C) metabolism. It is not known
  which individual, or combination, of these processes leads to apoptosis, but increased
  p53-dependent apoptosis, causes NTDs and CHDs. b—diagram of regulation of the Pax3
  CpG island. In undifferentiated embryo cells, methylation of cytosine residues within
  a CpG island within the Pax3 transcription regulatory element by DNMT3B prevents
  Pax3 transcription. Upon differentiation, decreased Dnmt3b expression leads to demethylation
  of the Pax3 CpG island, thereby permitting Pax3 transcription. However, oxidative
  stress (ROS) stimulates DNMT3B activity, which maintains the Pax3 CpG island methylation
  pattern of undifferentiated cells, thereby inhibiting Pax3 expression. c—biochemical
  pathways influenced by GLUT2-transported GlcN metabolism. Glucosamine (GlcN) is
  transported into embryo cells by GLUT2, which has a KM of 0.8 mmol/L for GlcN. During
  maternal hyperglycemia, glucose is transported by GLUT2, which has a KM of 16 mmol/L
  for glucose, and glucose inhibits transport of GlcN. At physiological glucose concentrations,
  glucose concentrations, glucose is transported by GLUT1 and GLUT3, which have KMs
  of 5 mmol/L for glucose. GLUT1 can also transport GlcN, with a KM of 2 mmol/L (although
  circulating GlcN concentrations this high are unlikely to be achieved even when
  ingesting GlcN supplements). GLUT2-transported GlcN becomes phosphorylated (GlcN-6-P)
  and enters the HBSP, providing uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-N-GlcNAc).
  UDP-N-GlcNAc is transferred onto lipid carrier molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) membrane, where it is used for the initiation of N-glycosylation (N-CHO) reactions.
  Fructose-6-P plus the amino acid Glutamine (Gln) can be converted to GlcN-6-P plus
  Glutamate (Glu) by the enzyme glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFA).
  However, exogenous GlcN spares fructose-6-P and Gln, providing more glycolytic metabolites,
  increasing lactate production, and maintaining substrates for the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA) and oxidative phosphorylation (Ox Phos). Among the glycolytic metabolites
  that are increased by exogenous GlcN is glucose-6-P, which stimulates activity of
  the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD), thereby increasing NADPH production. Stimulation of glycolysis
  and the PPP increase substrates for growth and biomass accumulation'
