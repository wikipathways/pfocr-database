caption: Hcy and methylation cycle - Mouse tissue Hcy metabolites. A. Hcy metabolite
  levels in mouse tissues. Hcy metabolites were measured in six tissues (heart, liver,
  lung, kidney, spleen, and brain) from C57BL/6 J mice (n = 4, 14–18 weeks of age).
  Samples were collected and homogenized with 4 M perchloric acid (PCA) solution.
  Tissues extracts were assessed for Hcy metabolites (Hcy, SAM and SAH) by LC-ESI-MS/MS
  as described in the materials and methods section. B. Hcy and methylation cycle
  (Classical) Hcy is generated by Met demethylation and de-adenosylation. Hcy can
  be removed by the transsulfuration pathway to generate Cysta, Cys, H2S and others
  by-products, or be remethylated back to Met by receiving a methyl group from the
  folate cycle and/or Cho-Bet metabolism. Through adenosylation, Hcy can form SAH,
  a potent inhibitor of nuclear methylation. SAM is converted from Met metabolism
  in an ATP dependent manner and serves as a methyl donor for PE to PC conversion,
  which can also come from phosphorylation of Cho, a precursor of Bet. C/D. Hcy and
  methylation cycle (Liver/Spleen). Representation of tissue specific Hcy-SAH metabolic
  models.
