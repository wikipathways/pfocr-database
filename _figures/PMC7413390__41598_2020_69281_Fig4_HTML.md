caption: The canonical pathway represented by differentially expressed proteins in
  BALF between sarcoidosis and controls implementing Overlapping Canonical Pathway
  functionality in IPA. The 293 differentially expressed proteins map to 65 statistically
  significant canonical pathways. Each canonical pathway is represented as a node.
  The edges indicated at least two common proteins between the nodes to denote shared
  biological function. Complex network of pathways with diverse functions including
  immunological processes, signal transduction by kinases, acute phase response signaling,
  NRF2-mediated antioxidant response and several metabolic pathways were detected
  in this analysis.
