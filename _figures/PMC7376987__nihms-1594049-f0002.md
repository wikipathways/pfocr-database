caption: Summary of recent advancement toward heart regeneration. A schematic representation
  of factors promoting (blue box) and inhibiting (pink box) cardiac regeneration.
  After an injury, scar area consists of unhealthy or dead cardiomyocytes, infiltrated
  with immune cells and repopulation of the scar are with fibroblast. Cardiomyocyte
  proliferation can be achieved through inhibition of Hippo pathway, expressing cell
  cycle regulators in cardiomyocytes, inhibition of thyroid hormone, manipulating
  extracellular matrix. Cardiac regeneration can also be achieved by activating heart
  resident macrophages, activation of Treg cell, increase in collateral artery and
  increased lymphogenesis.
