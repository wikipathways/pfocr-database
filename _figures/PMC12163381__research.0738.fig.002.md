caption: 'ILs exacerbating AKI progression. This figure illustrates the mechanisms
  by which various cytokine families facilitate the progression of AKI. (A) IL-1 family:
  Signaling pathways involving IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-36, highlighting their
  interactions with MyD88 and IRAK4, leading to activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways.
  (B) CXC family: Role of IL-8 in AKI progression through its interaction with CXCR
  receptors, leading to activation of ICAM-1, p38 MAPK, and PI3K/Akt pathways. (C)
  IL-10 family: Signaling pathways of IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24, showing their interactions
  with JAK1/STAT3 and TYK2/STAT5 pathways. (D) IL-12 family: Signaling pathways of
  IL-12 and IL-23, focusing on the p35/p40 and p19/p40 subunits and their interactions
  with JAK2/STAT1 and TYK2/STAT3 pathways. (E) IL-17 family: Role of IL-17A and IL-17C
  in AKI progression, showing their interactions with TRAF, MAPK, TAK1, AP-1, and
  NF-κB pathways. (F) IL-34 family: Signaling pathway involving CSF-1R, ERK1/2, Akt,
  and NF-κB. (G) Overview of AKI progression: Overall process, including TEC injury,
  necrosis, DAMP release, lymphocyte activation, and the promotion of further injury
  through cytokines and ROS. Figure created with BioRender.com'
