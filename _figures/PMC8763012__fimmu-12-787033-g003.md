caption: The ClueGO based enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and pathway identified
  from genes differently experessed in four experimental diets (A) 0.3% FA+IS, (B)
  1% FAω3, (C) 1% FAω6, and (D) 0.3% FA of pre-infected group of samples. The shape
  size shows the GO terms and pathway significance (larger shape (e.g. circle, square)
  = higher significance). The shape depicts database source i.e., GO biological process
  (circle), GO cellular component (hexagon), GO molecular function (parallelogram),
  and KEGG pathways (square). The statistics of representative GO terms or pathways
  are tabulated in .
