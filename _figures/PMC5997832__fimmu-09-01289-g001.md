caption: 'IRE1α structure and its downstream mechanisms in mild and severe stress.
  (A) A model depicting the IRE1α structure and its functional domains: luminal domain
  (LD), transmembrane domain (TD), linker region (LR), kinase domain (KD), RNase domain
  (RD), and an activation loop at the KD. (B) Stress factors, such as mutations, high
  demand for secretory proteins, ionic imbalance, and disease cause an accumulation
  of misfolded proteins, leading to activation of the unfolded protein response. Immunoglobulin
  binding protein regulates IRE1α through dimerization, autophosphorylation, and further
  oligomerization. During mild endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, activated IRE1α
  helps the cells to recover from stress through increasing the ER folding chaperones
  and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) components by generating stable transcription
  factor XBP1s, as follows: active IRE1α cleaves XBP1 mRNA, and the cleaved fragments
  are ligated by RtcB. Stable XBP1 mRNA is generated and translated to form the transcription
  factor XBP1s, which moves to the nucleus and induces the expression of chaperone
  proteins and ERAD process-associated genes. Another process, regulated IRE1α-dependent
  decay (RIDD), degrades mRNAs and reduces the load of new proteins entering ER, which
  helps in cell survival; in addition, the generation of small RNA fragments triggers
  the inflammatory response. (C) With severe stress, IRE1α induces the alternative
  pathway: apoptotic signaling by recruiting TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)
  and apoptosis signaling kinase1, leading to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation.
  Phosphorylated JNK induces apoptosis through many signaling pathways. It causes
  the proapoptotic proteins Bcl-2-associated X protein (BaX), and Bim to translocate
  to the mitochondrial membrane by inhibiting antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma family
  2 (Bcl-2). The mitochondrial membrane is ruptured, and cytochrome C is released,
  which activates caspase-9 and -3, which in turn cleave many proteins and cause cell
  death. Phosphorylated JNK also translocates Sab protein, which increases the mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and leads to cell death directly, as well as ROS inducing
  inflammation-mediated cell death. In addition, JNK-mediated transcription factor
  AP-1 induces pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated cell death. IRE1α also can induce
  inflammation-mediated cell death by activating NFκB. Furthermore, RIDD activity,
  which degrades prosurvival mRNAs, which increases caspase-2 expression, causes translocation
  of BH3-interacting domain to the mitochondria, and also degrades miRNA17, which
  stabilizes the thioredoxin-interacting protein thioredoxin-interacting protein,
  leading to inflammation and ROS-mediated cell death. In addition, spliced XBP1s
  stimulates the expression of the proapoptotic protein CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein
  homologous protein (CHOP), which induces cell death. Finally, IRE1α/TRAF2 association
  can activate caspase-12-mediated cell apoptosis.'
