caption: The role of KDEL ligand and receptor in chaperone retrieval and retention
  within the ER and escape into the cytosol. Within the ER, membrane bound and soluble
  chaperones assist in the folding (not shown) and transport of glycoproteins to the
  cell surface. During this process the chaperones, e.g., calreticulin (CRT) escort
  their cargos between the ER and Golgi complex. Upon chaperone docking to the KDEL
  receptors (KDELR) via their KDEL ligand, the KDELR activates a number of G proteins
  (βγ, Gq, and Gs) and kinases (PKC, PKA, and Src), which allows released proteins
  to be transported via the secretory anterograde pathway toward the plasma membrane,
  while chaperones are returned to the ER via a retrograde pathway. There are a number
  of situations in which the process of chaperones interacting with their KDEL receptors
  might be impaired. During ER stress induced by tumorgenesis, the ER chaperone production
  increases and may lead to increased saturation of the KDEL receptors with chaperones.
  In addition, the optimum acid pH can increase during cell stress reducing KDEL ligand/receptor
  interaction. In hematopoietic cells carrying Type I (52 bp deletion) and Type II
  (5 bp insertion) mutations in the carboxyl terminus of calreticulin, may result
  in lack of binding of chaperones to the KDEL receptors. This leaves the chaperones
  vulnerable to being trafficked by a number of secretory and alternative mechanisms
  into the cytosol and ultimately out of the cell.
