caption: Relationships between gut microbiota, gut microbiota-associated metabolites,
  and EGFR/VEGFR/KRAS pathways. (A) Gut microbiota and gut microbiota-associated metabolites.
  (B) The bacteria produce special products. *SCFAs-producing bacteria include Bacteroides,
  Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Propionibacterium, Faecalibacterium,
  Oscillospira, Ruminococcaceae, Eubacterium, and Coriobacteriaceae. **SCFAs primarily
  include butyrate and propionate. ***Gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae
  and Escherichia coli. (C) The products regulate the EGFR/VEGFR/KRAS pathways. (1)
  UDCA downregulates EGFR expression and inhibits the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby inducing
  apoptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, UDCA supresses EMT in tumor cells by inhibiting
  the EGF-EGFR pathway. (2) Butyrate reduces the expression of VEGF and NRP-1 by inhibiting
  the transactivation of Sp1 in tumor cells, which subsequently suppresses angiogenesis.
  Furthermore, butyrate enhances the production of ROS, leading to the inhibition
  of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and ultimately resulting in autophagy of
  tumor cells. (3) Propionate inhibits the mTOR signaling pathway, contributing to
  autophagy in tumor cells. (4) DCA stimulates the production and release of EGF,
  disrupts membrane structure to upregulate EGFR activity, and activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway in tumor cells, promoting proliferation and invasiveness. DCA additionally
  increases the expression of VEGF mRNA in tumor cells, further enhancing angiogenesis.
  (5) TMAO enhances the production and secretion of VEGF from tumor cells, promoting
  tumor angiogenesis; the activation of NF-κB signaling by TMAO may contribute to
  these effects. (6) Fusobacterium nucleatum promotes EMT through the activation of
  the EGFR signaling pathway in tumor cells, including the downstream effector kinases
  AKT and ERK. (7) LPS upregulates the expression of VEGFR by enhancing NF-κB binding
  to the VEGFR promoter in endothelial cells, promoting tumor angiogenesis. LPS also
  induces the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in tumor cells through increased
  phosphorylation, thereby enhancing the invasive ability. BAs, bile acids; DCA, deoxycholic
