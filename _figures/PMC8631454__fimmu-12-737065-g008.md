caption: Schematic illustration of DMF modulating microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  DMF modulates the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway at different levels. In the
  priming step, DMF prevents the translocation of NF-κB and subsequently downregulates
  the expression of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18. Additionally, DMF promotes Nrf2 activation
  and upregulates the expression of Nrf2 target genes. Accordingly, DMF reduced the
  formation of cellular and mitochondrial ROS and restored the mitochondrial membrane
  potential. In the activation step, DMF inhibits caspase-1 cleavage and its activity.
  Subsequent cleavage of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pore-forming GSDMD was prevented
  by DMF.
