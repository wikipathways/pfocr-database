caption: 'The map of metabolic pathways under the symbiotic and/or free-living conditions.
  The map of metabolic pathways is shown: (a) nitrogen fixation, (b) ubiquinone biosynthesis,
  (c) amino sugar metabolism, (d) peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Box symbols indicate
  the same things as in Figure . Daggers (†) indicate the reactions that have universally
  existed but have not been proposed in M. loti by KEGG pathway analysis. Asterisks
  indicate the focused enzymes discussed in the “Results and discussion” section.
  Abbreviations are as follows: GlcN, Glucosamine; GlcNAc, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine;
  MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid.'
