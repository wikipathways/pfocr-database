caption: 'a The subnetwork given by all interactors. Using the subnetwork given by
  the three modules (Fig. e) we only kept the genes of the modules which are connected
  to another module. Pink genes are members of the fetal lung methylation module,
  yellow genes are members of the COPD methylation disease module and turquoise genes
  are members of the COPD expression disease module. The blue vs. red edges represent
  physical vs. functional interactions, whereas green edges represent both. b We show
  here all pathways which were significantly enriched for at least four of the sets
  of genes listed in the first column. The pathways are in the first row. The adj.
  p-value is given if the pathways were significantly enriched (adj. p-value < 0.05)
  using the set of genes and the KEGG data base. Module A to Module B: The set of
  intermediate genes from module A connecting to module B were used for the enrichment.
  c AGE-RAGE Pathway: The AGE-RAGE pathway was enriched for interacting genes between
  the COPD expression disease module and the fetal lung methylation module, as well
  as for both sets of interactors within the fetal lung methylation module and the
  interactors between the COPD expression and COPD methylation module. The pink squared
  genes are the interactors which locate in the fetal lung methylation module and
  the turquoise genes locate in the COPD expression disease module. Note that VEGFA
  is downstream in the AGE-RAGE pathway and upstream for the Focal Adhesion (red arrow)
  and is identified in the COPD expression disease module. Focal Adhesion Pathway:
  The Focal Adhesion Pathway is enriched for interacting genes between both of the
  COPD disease modules and the fetal lung methylation module as well as for the interactors
  between the COPD expression and COPD methylation module. The yellow squared genes
  are from the COPD methylation disease module, the turquoise genes are in the COPD
  expression disease module, and the pink squared genes are the interactors which
  locate in the fetal lung methylation module. Note that VEGFA links the AGE-RAGE
  pathway and the Focal Adhesion and is located in the COPD expression disease module'
