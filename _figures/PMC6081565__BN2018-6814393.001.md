caption: Two classic pathways of necroptosis. One of the classic pathways is RIP3
  binding to RIP1 to form procedural necrosis complex II, which in turn binds to MLKL
  and mediates necroptosis of the mitochondrial pathway. The other is RIP1 binding
  to AIF, which translocated into the nucleus and mediates necroptosis of the nuclear
  pathway.
