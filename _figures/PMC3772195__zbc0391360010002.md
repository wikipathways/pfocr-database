caption: Sulfenic and sulfinic acid redox cycles. A, RSOH can be directly reduced
  to free thiol by Trx, although the importance of this pathway in cells is still
  debated (Cycle 1). RSOH can also react with GSH to generate a mixed disulfide (although
  not all protein-SOHs are accessible to GSH), which is subsequently reduced by glutaredoxin
  (Grx; Cycle 2). B, in the presence of a neighboring Cys residue, RSOH forms an internal
  disulfide that is later reduced by Trx (Cycle 3). C, typical eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs
  are inactivated by overoxidation to sulfinic acid (Step 1). Srx restores the sulfenic
  acid group using an ATP-dependent mechanism in which an activated sulfinic phosphoryl
  ester is generated (Step 2). This intermediate collapses to form a thiosulfinate
  moiety with Cys-99 of Srx (Step 3). It has been proposed that this intramolecular
  thiosulfinate is finally resolved by a common cellular reductant, such as GSH or
  Trx, with consequent release of Prx-SOH (Step 4).
