caption: Illustration of mechanistic action of quercetin in L6 myotubes. Quercetin
  pretreatment in L6 myotubes enhanced AMP to ATP ratio which resulted in a transient
  change in mitochondrial membrane potential. There was also an associated increase
  in intracellular calcium level, which resulted in the activation of AMPK and its
  downstream target P38MAPK. Akt was also upregulated pointing to the conclusion that
  quercetin follows AMPK pathway, and it overlaps with insulin signaling pathway.
