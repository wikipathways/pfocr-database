caption: Immunomodulatory effect of protein/amino acid metabolites on the colon. Tryptophan
  promotes the expression of the tight junction protein to achieve the intestinal
  barrier function. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which is a crucial ligand-dependent
  transcription regulator in the cytoplasm, can bind to tryptophan and its downstream
  metabolites. The resulting complex is transported to the nucleus, where the AHR
  is activated. This regulates the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal
  inflammatory cells and the transcription and expression of inflammatory-related
  factors (such as interleukin-22, IL-22). Short-chained fatty acids regulate protective
  immunity and tissue inflammation by controlling intestinal epithelial cells (IEC),
  promoting the development of regulatory T cells (Treg), enhancing the secretion
  of mucus by goblet cells, and promoting IL-18 in T cells. Short-chain fatty acid
  receptor 2 and 3 (FFA2 and FFA3) are essential regulators of intestinal inflammation
  and epithelial barrier function. Short-chain fatty acid receptor 2 regulates the
  Treg development. Short-chain fatty acid receptor 2 on dendritic cells can also
  promote the production of intestinal IgA. Different from FFA2, FFA3 (which is expressed
  in the intestinal nonimmune cell population) enhances the expression of transforming
  growth factor-α, IL-6, and other cytokines and chemokines mainly through mitogen-activated
  protein (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathway; short-chained fatty
  acids can promote IEC to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMP) through FFA2. Some
  amino acids significantly stimulate the expression of β-defensin in epithelial cells
  by blocking nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and MAPK inflammatory signaling pathways
  and activating the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway.
