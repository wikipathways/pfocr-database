caption: Role of amino acids and amino-acid catabolizing enzymes in T-cell activation.
  Uptake of amino acids via cell surface transporters (CAT and the light subunits
  of LAT) is increased upon T cell activation. The intake of amino acid leads to the
  activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway which
  controls protein synthesis and the reprogramming of T cell metabolism necessary
  for the full expression of the activation program. Amino acids are also required
  for protein synthesis, for the control of the redox balance (through glutathione
  tripeptide [GSH]) synthesis from cysteine and for epigenetic modifications of histones
  and ADN (through S-adenosylhomocysteine production from methionine). Amino acid
  catabolizing enzymes interfere with TCR signaling by starving T cells of amino acids
  and through the production of several bioactive metabolites (NO, kynurenine [Kyn],
  H2O2, etc.) acting at specific steps. Amino-acid catabolizing enzymes may also interfere
  with T-cell activation by degrading precursors of monoamines with costimulatory
  functions, such as serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine. Some of these effects are listed
  in the yellow and green boxes. For more detailed description of the action of amino-acids
  and their derivatives on TCR signaling, see . The general effect of amino-acid catabolizing
  enzymes results in blockade of T-cell proliferation and function.
