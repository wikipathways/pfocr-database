caption: 'Biogenesis of piRNAs: A) piRNAs are generated from primary and second pathways
  (Ping-Pong cycle). In the primary pathway, piRNA precursors are transcribed from
  piRNA clusters. Antisense primary piRNAs are cleaved, trimmed to short fragments,
  and its 3’ ends are 2’-O-methylated and then loaded onto Piwi family proteins. In
  the secondary amplification pathways, also known as the Ping-Pong cycle, PIWI proteins
  associated with antisense piRNA and cleaves piRNA precursors in the sense strand,
  or PIWI proteins associated with sense piRNA and cleaves antisense piRNA precursors
  in the sense strand. The incorporated RNA is therefore processed into a mature secondary
  piRNA by trimming and modification likely by the same mechanisms that generated
  a primary piRNA. B) The biological functions of piRNAs. In the nucleus, Piwi-piRNAs
  complexes can repress transposon expression by methylation of transposon region
  or chromatin modification around transposon region. In the cytoplasm, piRNAs can
  degrade retrotransposon-associated mRNAs, cause cleavage of mRNAs through a miRNA-like
  mechanism and facilitate mRNA maturation.'
