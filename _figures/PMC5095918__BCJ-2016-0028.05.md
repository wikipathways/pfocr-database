caption: (A) Cytokine/receptor-mediated activation of LUBAC/UBE2L3 triggers linear
  (Met1) polyubiquitination of NEMO required for IKK kinase activation. IKK phosphorylates
  the NF-κB sequestration protein IκBα that is then recognized by SCF/β-TrCP ligase
  for Lys48 polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Released
  NF-κB translocates to the nucleus to transactivate NF-κB response genes. (B) Model
  for hyperactivation (indicated by red arrows) of the NF-κB pathway in patients carrying
  UBE2L3 risk alleles associated with autoimmune diseases. UBE2L3 SNP rs140490 correlates
  with increased levels of UBE2L3 protein, causing enhanced LUBAC signalling, accelerated
  IκBα degradation, and hyperactive NF-κB response.
