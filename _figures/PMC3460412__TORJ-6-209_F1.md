caption: 'Activation of p38 MAPK downstrem of TNFR1. Engagement of TNFR1 by trimeric
  TNF promotes a structural change in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (which
  is itself trimeric). The cytoplasmic death domain of TNFR1 then mediates recruitment
  of the adaptor protein TRADD (TNF receptor associated death domain protein). This
  provides a platform for recruitment of additional proteins that include the kinase
  RIP1 (receptor interacting protein 1), TNF receptor associated factors (TRAFs) 2
  and 5, cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) 1 and 2 and, it is thought,
  the E2 enzymes UBC13 and UEV1. From here, the picture of signaling events becomes
  a little blurred, because: i) a number of entities in the complex possess ubiquitin
  E3 ligase activity (namely the TRAFs and the cIAPs); ii) some ubiquitin modifications
  of proteins in the complex have not been consistently identified in different labs;
  and iii) downstream events have often been studied in the context of signaling to
  NF-κB or JNK rather than p38 MAPK. K63-linked polyubiquitination of the TRAFs themselves
  or of RIP have been implicated in downstream signaling. A more recent notion is
  that transmission of the signal depends on the generation of unanchored polyubiquitin
  chains []. TAK1 is next recruited to the complex via interactions between polyubiquitin
  chains and TAK1 binding proteins (TABs), which possess poly-ubiquitin binding domains
  []. TAK1 proteins that are brought together at polyubiquitin chains then phosphorylate
  and activate one another. K63-linked ubiquitination of TAK1 itself may also be involved
  in the activation of p38 MAPK [].'
