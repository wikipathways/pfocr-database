caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling in DCs and tumors in driving immune suppression and
  immune evasion. The canonical Wnt signaling shape anti-tumor immune responses by
  modulating DC functions, such as activation, trafficking, capturing and cross-presenting
  TAAs and expression of immune regulatory factors (RA, IL-10, IDO, TGF-β). Activation
  of β-catenin and its down-stream mediators mTOR and TCF4 in tumor DCs through Wnt-LRP5/6
  signaling leads to the induction of anti-inflammatory factors RA, IDO, and IL-10
  that are critical for promoting Treg response to tumor antigens. Wnts regulate trafficking
  of DCs to tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) by regulating the expression
  of chemokine receptors CCR5, XCR1, and CCR7. Within the TME, DC-intrinsic Wnt signaling
  limits the recruitment of CTLs by suppressing the expression of chemokines CXCL9/10.
  Wnt signaling leads to metabolic alterations in DCs that programs them to a regulatory
  state. Wnt-β-catenin-PPARγ-mediated signaling shifts DC metabolism from glycolysis
  to FAO by upregulating the expression of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A)
  fatty acid transporter. In addition, Wnt-β-catenin-TCF signaling in tumor DCs promote
  vitamin A metabolism through the induction of enzymes involved in RA synthesis and
  tryptophan metabolism through the induction of IDO. The canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway in tumor cells promotes tumor growth and immune evasion via chemokines (CCL4,
  XCL1, CCL5) that are critical for the recruitment and accumulation of DCs within
  the TME.
