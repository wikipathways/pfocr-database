caption: Following an attack by a phage or the aberrant expression of a secreted or
  membrane protein, envelope stress response systems, such as the two-component BaeSR
  signal transduction pathway, are activated. An activated response regulator, for
  instance phosphorylated BaeR (BaeR-P), triggers expression of the Cas proteins and
  perhaps also the transcription of full-length CRISPR RNA. Full-length CRISPR RNA
  is recognized by the CasCDE core complex and processed to produce small guide RNAs
  (crRNAs), which have a uniformly processed 5′ end and a variable 3′ end. CasE or
  perhaps the entire CasCDE ternary complex remain associated with the processed crRNAs
  and may be guided to the target DNA to initiate DNA degradation. Whether CasCDE
  is a landmark to attract other effector proteins such as CasA and CasB through transient
  interactions is currently unclear but additional enzymes are necessary as CasE or
  CasE-containing complexes do not exhibit any measurable DNase activity. Nonetheless,
  silencing by the Cas effector complex is achieved by base-pairing between the crRNA
  and the DNA target, which may occur during active replication of phage genome or
  plasmid DNA. Finally, a small number of bacteria acquire new spacers derived from
  the foreign DNA (marked by an asterisk), leading to survival by CRISPR RNA-mediated
  degradation of DNA.
