caption: Enzymes involved in PGE2 synthesis and metabolism. Arachidonic acid is cleaved
  from membrane phospholipids by a phospholipase A2 (PLA2). A cyclooxygenase (PTGS1
  or PTGS2) converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). PGH2 can be converted
  to PGE2 by a PGE2 synthase (PTGES) or to PGF2α by aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3).
  PGE2 is metabolized to PGF2α by an enzyme with 9-keto reductase activity (AKR1C1
  or AKR1C2). PGE2 is metabolized to 15-keto-PGE2 by prostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD).
  For each conversion, enzyme listed in boldface is the predominant form in the ovulatory
  follicle. Molecular structures are provided to highlight the conversion made by
  each enzyme. PGE1, PGE2 and PGE3 are distinguished by the number of double bonds
  in the molecular structure.
