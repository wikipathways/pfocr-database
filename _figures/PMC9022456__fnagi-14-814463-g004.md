caption: Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway involved in UPS. (A) Under non-stressed conditions,
  Nrf2 binds to Keap1 complex which has E3 ligase activity in the cytoplasm. When
  Nrf2 is ubiquitinated, it is targeted to the 26S proteasome for proteolysis which
  keep it low in cytoplasm. (B) Under oxidative stress conditions, Critical cysteine
  residues in Keap1 is covalently-modified by electrophilic species or reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and Nrf2 avoides Keap1-mediated ubiquitination modification. Then
  Nrf2 translocated to the nucleus, starts ARE/EpRE transcription through heterodimerization
  with SMAF protein, and induced the expression of a series of cytoprotective genes.
