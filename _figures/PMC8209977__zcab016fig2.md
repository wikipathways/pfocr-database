caption: 'Roles of RAD51 in DSB repair pathway selection and consequences for genomic
  instability. The choice of the DSB repair pathway occurs in two steps (, ): 1, competition
  between canonical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ), which is conservative (),
  and resection leading to a 3′ ssDNA; 2, competition between conservative HR and
  non-conservative single-strand annealing (SSA) or alternative end-joining (A-EJ)
  on the 3′ ssDNA. Resection can reveal complementary single-stranded DNA; their annealing
  results in SSA (long sequences) or A-EJ (microhomology-mediated) with loss of the
  intervening sequence. Thus, SSA and A-EJ are non-conservative, leading to genomic
  instability. (A) Loading of wild-type RAD51 (red circles) on ssDNA triggers conservative
  HR through its enzymatic search for homology and strand exchange activity and thus
  maintains genome stability. In addition, the presence of RAD51 on ssDNA prevents
  the annealing of the complementary ssDNA, protecting genome stability against non-conservative
  repair. (B) The absence of RAD51 on ssDNA does not allow HR and makes DNA accessible
  to alternative and non-conservative SSA and A-EJ, fostering genomic instability.
  (C) The loading of mutant mRAD51 (hatched red circles) proteins with maintained
  DNA binding capacities, yet unable to perform strand exchange, will result in defective
  HR without stimulation of alternative non-conservative repair. Non-conservative
  repair generates genomic instability that can fuel tumourigenesis. (D) Overexpression
  of RAD51 might initiate more strand exchange and HR events, resulting in resistance
  of DNA damage-based chemotherapy. In addition, this putative stimulation of strand
  exchange might result in the accumulation of unresolved HR intermediates that generate
  genetic instability. RAD51 overexpression might result in disequilibrium of other
  HR functions and cell homeostasis, leading to tumourigenesis.'
