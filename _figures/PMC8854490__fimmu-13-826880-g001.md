caption: The cGAS-STING signaling pathway. cGAS can recognize exogenous DNA from pathogens
  or self-DNA (from the mitochondria and nucleus). After cGAS recognizes DNA, it synthesizes
  the second messenger 2’3’-cGAMP, which activates STING. The translocation of STING
  from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is a prerequisite for participating
  in the downstream signal transduction and regulating IFN-I transcription. Activated
  STING can recruit and activate IKK and TBK1. TBK1 phosphorylates IRF3. Subsequently,
  phosphorylated IRF3 forms a dimer and translocates to the nucleus, where it acts
  together with NF-κB to initiate the expression of IFN-I and other immune regulatory
  factors.
