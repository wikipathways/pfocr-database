caption: 'Disease mechanisms in C3 glomerulopathy, based on genetic defects identified
  in family studies. A: Physiological regulation of C3 activation to C3b via the alternative
  pathway is mediated by complement factor H (CFH) (Cfh). Competitive inhibition of
  CFH by CFHR proteins is termed CFH deregulation; B: Homozygous deficiency or dysfunction
  of CFH results in excessive C3 activation; C: Hyper-functional C3 produces excessive
  C3 activation despite normal CFH activity; D: Abnormal CFHR proteins enhance CFH
  deregulation, leading to excessive C3 activation. Adapted from Barbour et al[].'
