caption: 'Cardiac myocyte signaling coupled to phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5. Cyclic GMP
  (cGMP) is generated by two mechanisms: a nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-soluble guanylate
  cyclase (sGC) coupled pathway, and membrane natriuretic receptor-guanylate cyclase
  (NPR-A/B, rGC) pathway. These two pools of cGMP interact with different effectors
  – namely other PDEs that regulate both cGMP and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),
  and protein kinase G (PKG). PDE5 is a cGMP-selective PDE that is also activated
  by cGMP binding to the enzyme as well as PKG phosphorylation of the enzyme. sGC-generated
  cGMP can both augment and reduce cAMP in the cell by inhibiting PDE3 and activating
  PDE2, respectively. Inhibiting PDE5 also augments cGMP from this pool, and while
  this has been proposed to modulate PDE3 in the right ventricle [], this has not
  been observed for the left ventricle. PDE5-modulated cGMP pools do not appear to
  impact cAMP-dependent signaling in normal adult myocytes []. Natriuretic peptide
  receptor (NPR)–coupled cGMP does not normally interact with PDE5; indeed the precise
  PDE responsible for modulating this pool remains unclear.Cardiac stress regulation
  by PDE5 inhibition is primarily controlled by PKG targeting, and PDE5 inhibition
  enhances PKG signaling to stimulate these pathways. Shown on the left side are sarcomere
  proteins, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium handling proteins (PLB [phospholamban]),

  kinase Cα (PKCα) their regulation of nuclear transcription factors (nuclear factor
  of activated T-cells [NFAT], myocyte enhancer factor-2 [MEF2], SRF, and GATA4).
