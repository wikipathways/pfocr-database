caption: Microbial pathogens and their components initiate the innate immune response
  through activation of multiple signaling pathways, most importantly the TLR-NF-κB
  axis, driving the production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. Unphosphorylated
  GSK3β is an essential and controlling mediator of this inflammatory response to
  bacteria. Likely in order to prevent an overly robust response to infection, several
  endogenous mechanisms serve to dampen bacterial-driven inflammation. The cholinergic
  anti-inflammatory pathway, triggered upon α7nAChR engagement by endogenous (acetylcholine)
  and exogenous (e.g., nicotine) agonists, is a classic example. α7nAChR-mediated
  activation of PI3K leads to phospho-inactivation of GSK3β at Ser9 (through Akt and
  PIP3) resulting in increased activity of CREB, displacement of NF-κB p65 from the
  co-activator of transcription, CBP, and lowered transcriptional activity of NF-κB
  p65-driven pro-inflammatory genes. Increased chromosomal access to CREB also promotes
  production of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Inhibitors of TLR pathway molecules (JAK3;
  PI3K; Akt) that normally drive GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation (white lines) exacerbate
  bacterial-driven inflammation, while promoters of GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation (α7nAChR
  pathway) or pharmaceutical GSK3β inhibitors (e.g., SB216763) suppress pro-inflammatory
  mediators while promoting anti-inflammatory IL-10 in response to infection (red
  lines). Perhaps independently, activation of the canonical Wnt (Wnt/β-catenin) pathway
  also leads to phospho-inactivation of GSK3β and the stabilization of β-catenin which
  suppresses inflammation by interference with NF-κB. There is much current emphasis
  on the development of pharmacological inhibitors of GSK3β that alter the magnitude
  of the inflammatory response through differentially regulating pro- and anti- inflammatory
  cytokines. Therefore, it is possible that we will eventually be able to up- or down-regulate
  the intensity of the innate response to bacterial infection depending on the clinical
  necessity.

  description: Microbial pathogens and their components initiate the innate immune
    response through activation of multiple signaling pathways, most importantly the
    TLR-NF-κB axis, driving the production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines.
    Unphosphorylated GSK3β is an essential and controlling mediator of this inflammatory
    response to bacteria. Likely in order to prevent an overly robust response to
    infection, several endogenous mechanisms serve to dampen bacterial-driven inflammation.
    The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, triggered upon α7nAChR engagement by
    endogenous (acetylcholine) and exogenous (e.g., nicotine) agonists, is a classic
    example. α7nAChR-mediated activation of PI3K leads to phospho-inactivation of
    GSK3β at Ser9 (through Akt and PIP3) resulting in increased activity of CREB,
    displacement of NF-κB p65 from the co-activator of transcription, CBP, and lowered
    transcriptional activity of NF-κB p65-driven pro-inflammatory genes. Increased
    chromosomal access to CREB also promotes production of anti-inflammatory IL-10.
    Inhibitors of TLR pathway molecules (JAK3; PI3K; Akt) that normally drive GSK3β
    Ser9 phosphorylation (white lines) exacerbate bacterial-driven inflammation, while
    promoters of GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation (α7nAChR pathway) or pharmaceutical GSK3β
