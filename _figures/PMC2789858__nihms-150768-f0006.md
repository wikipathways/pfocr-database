caption: Schematic model showing the role of physiological synaptic vs. excessive
  extrasynaptic NMDAR activity in the neurodegeneration of Huntington’s disease. Physiological
  synaptic NMDAR activity promotes neuroprotection, in part by facilitating non-toxic
  aggregation of mtHtt via the chaperonin TRiC. Otherwise toxic mtHtt would interfere
  with the neuroprotective CREB-PGC-1α pathway. In contrast, extrasynaptic NMDAR activity
  promotes neuronal cell injury and death, in part by increasing the relative level
  of Rhes, and, in conjunction with soluble/toxic mtHtt, by contributing to transcriptional
  deregulation of the CREB-PGC-1α cascade. Drugs inhibiting extrasynaptic or synaptic
  activity are indicated. Note that most NMDAR antagonists, as well as high concentrations
  of memantine, block both synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR-mediated currents, while
  low concentrations of memantine block predominantly the extrasynaptic component,
  thus relatively sparing synaptic activity and promoting neuroprotection.
