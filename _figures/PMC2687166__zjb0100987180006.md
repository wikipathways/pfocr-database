caption: Possible purine catabolic pathway. This metabolic pathway is based on the
  B. subtilis motif (). The genes of (C)-203U28 that appeared to participate in this
  pathway are indicated by their c2p numbers. The gene-enzyme relationships of the
  purine degradation pathway are shown in Fig. .
