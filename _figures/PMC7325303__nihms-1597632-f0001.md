caption: To initiate apoptosis, cellular stress or damage signals [1] unleash pro-apoptotic
  proteins (BH3-only ‘activators’ of apoptosis) via their upregulation (BIM or PUMA)
  or cleavage (BID cleaved to form truncated tBID) [2], which can either be bound
  and sequestered by pro-survival proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL1 [3] or, when
  these pro-survival proteins are saturated or absent, can activate BAX and/or BAK
  [4]. Activated BAX or BAK oligomerize and form pores to cause mitochondrial outer
  membrane permeabilization (MOMP), resulting in the release of apoptogenic molecules
  including SMAC, OMI and cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
  Cytochrome c binds APAF1 in the cytosol to form the apoptosome (5), which serves
  as a platform for the activation of caspase 9, which then goes on to activate the
  effector caspases 3 and 7 (6) to dismantle the cell and prepare it for phagocytosis.
  Caspase activation can be blocked by XIAP (7), which in turn is inhibited by the
  released SMAC and OMI proteins from mitochondria (7). Upstream damage or stress
  signalling can also activate BH3-only ‘sensitizer’ proteins that don’t efficiently
  activate BAX and BAK but inhibit the activity of pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins
  to release any sequestered BH3-only activators, which trigger MOMP (8). BH3 mimetics
  are a novel class of agents that are able to sensitize cells to apoptosis by blocking
  the activity of pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins (9).
