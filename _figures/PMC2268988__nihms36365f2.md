caption: E2F target genes are regulated by repression of transcription in G0/G1 phase,
  followed by activation in G1/S phase. Repressive complexes containing primarily
  E2F4 and p107/p130 occupy promoters in G0/G1 phase, and association with chromatin
  remodeling enzymes such as histone deacetylases (HDAC) contributes to transcriptional
  repression. pRB binds to and inhibits the transcriptional activity of the activating
  E2Fs 1-3. Upon cell cycle entry, cyclin-CDK complexes such as cyclin D-CDK4 overcome
  inhibition by CDK inhibitors such as p16INK4a and phosphorylate the pocket proteins.
  This phosphorylation leads to disruption of the pocket protein-E2F complexes, causing
  E2F4 to be exported from the nucleus, and activating E2Fs to bind the promoters
  of cell cycle-regulated target genes and activate their transcription.
