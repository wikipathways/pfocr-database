caption: '(A): cytoskeleton; (B): PI3K signaling pathways; (C): endoplasmic reticulum
  activity; (D): lipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism; (E): carbohydrates and
  pyruvate metabolism; and (F): steroid hormone metabolism and oxidative stress. The
  red balls represent up-regulated genes, while the green balls represent down-regulated
  genes. The connections of genes were generated from the data analysis consist of
  GO analysis and KEGG pathway. The solid lines represent the relationships between
  the genes. The dashed lines represent the genes that have an indirect effect. The
  arrow represents activation. The flathead represents suppression. ‘a’ represents
  activation; ‘b’ represents binding; and ‘c’ represents compound. The abbreviation
  ‘dep’ represents phosphorylation; ‘dis’ represents dissociation; and ‘inh’ represents
  inhibition.'
