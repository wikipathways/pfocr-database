caption: MAPK signaling pathway in CAFs and the crosstalk of CAFs with cancer cells.
  In CAFs, by E2 and G1, the EGFR/ERK signaling upregulated FASN expression for the
  metabolism of fatty acids. The PDGF-BB and SDF-1 could stimulate the higher invasive
  and migratory capability of CAFs via ERK1/2 phosphorylation. FA activated RAS upregulating
  SNAIL1 via ERK2 signaling, which mediated the fibrogenic response of CAFs. TIMP-1
  enhanced CAF proliferation and migration and activated ERK1/2 signaling pathway
  in CAFs by the production of soluble factors. In the crosstalk between CAFs and
  cancer cells, CAF-derived EREG and POSTN could enhance the cancer cell proliferation
  and tumor growth by the downstream effector of ERK1/2. VCAM-1 and CAF-derived IL-32
  increased the proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and EMT in cancer cells by activating
  p38/MAPK signaling pathway. Activated CXCL12/CXCR4 signal promoted EMT process through
  ERK/AKT-Twist1-MMP1 pathway. EPA decreased the expression of IL‑6 and VEGF secretion
  in CAFs by inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, thereof affecting angiogenesis. E2
