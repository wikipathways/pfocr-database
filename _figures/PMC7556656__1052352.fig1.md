caption: NOTCH1 signaling pathway and effects of NOTCH1 mutations on CLL susceptibility
  to anti-CD20 mAb. In the context of a wild-type NOTCH1 gene (left panel), ligands
  (DLL -1, -3, -4 belonging to the Delta-like family or JAGGED -1, -2 belonging to
  the Serrate family) expressed by stromal cells and by antigen presenting cells (APC)
  bind to the extracellular portion of the NOTCH1 receptor on CLL cells. Ligand-receptor
  binding triggers sequential cleavages of the NOTCH1 receptor mediated by the ADAM10
  metalloprotease and the S3 γ-secretase. As a consequence, the IntraCellular NOTCH1
  (ICN) domain is free to translocate to the nucleus, where it interacts with RBPJ
  and other co-activators to induce transcription of target genes promoting cell growth
  and survival and other cellular programs. The signaling cascade is terminated by
  ubiquitinylation of the NOTCH1 autoregulatory PEST domain, that is mediated by the
  FBW7 complex and leads to ICN degradation in the proteasome. In CLL cells with wild
  type NOTCH1 genes, type 1 anti-CD20 antibodies (rituximab, ofatumumab) induce cell
  death in vitro and, in vivo contribute to better patient outcomes in patients treated
  with chemo-immunotherapy. NOTCH-1 mutations occur in a sizeable fraction of CLL
  (right panel), upregulate NOTCH1 signaling and lead to increased expression of target
  genes. Most mutations in CLL disrupt the PEST domain, reducing proteasomal degradation
  of ICN and stabilizing ligand-triggered NOTCH1 signaling. Type 1 anti-CD20 mAb are
  less efficacious against NOTCH1 mutated CLL cells both in vivo and in vitro. The
  exact mechanism of anti-CD20 refractoriness associated with NOTCH1 mutations is
  not fully understood, but has been suggested to be linked, at least in part, to
  downregulation of CD20 expression.
