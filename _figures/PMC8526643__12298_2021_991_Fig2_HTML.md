caption: Schematic representation of crosstalk among various molecules involved in
  signalling of glyoxalases in plants. Glyoxalase pathway mediated MG detoxification
  in plants is controlled by intricate mechanisms involving a plethora of signalling
  molecules such as phytohormones, messenger molecules, nutrients, reaction substrates
  and secondary metabolites. A crosstalk between these molecules facilitates optimal
  regulation of glyoxalases that are best suited for plant survival. Red and yellow
  arrows and/or arrowheads indicate upregulation of GLYI and GLYII, respectively whereas
  corresponding coloured circles and/or flatheads represent downregulation/inhibition,
  combination of arrowhead and circle represent both up and downregulation (as reports
  pertaining to both conditions available). NR, Nitrate reductase; CaMK, Calmodulin
  Kinase; GA, Gibberellin; JA, Jasmonic acid; ABA, Abscisic acid; SA, Salicylic acid;
  BR, Brassinosteroid; H2O2, Hydrogen peroxide; NO, Nitric oxide; H2S, Hydrogen sulphide;
  Ca2+, Calcium; Mel, Melatonin; NO3−, Nitrate; NH4+, Ammonia; MG, Methylglyoxal;
  GSH, reduced glutathione; SLG, S-D-lactoylglutathione; HOG-MAPK, High osmolarity
  glycerol-Mitogen activated protein kinase pathway; D-LDH, D-lactate Dehydrogenase;
  GABA, γ-Aminobutyric acid; GAD, Glutamate decarboxylase; ROS, Reactive Oxygen Species;
  GLYI, Glyoxalase I; GLYII, Glyoxalase II; RD26, Responsive to Desiccation 26; RAB18,
  Responsive to ABA 18; RD29B, Responsive to Desiccation 29B; Msn2p/Msn4p, Multicopy
