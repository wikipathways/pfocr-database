caption: Schematic representing the key role of IFNα and LPS-activated monocyte-derived
  exosomes in brain endothelial stimulation. We propose that IFNα and LPS together
  cause significant changes in the monocyte exosome cargo, specifically miRNAs. These
  exosomes are taken up by the brain endothelial cells leading to damage in the form
  of abnormal upregulation of adhesion molecules, chemoattractants and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. This mechanism is regulated by the TLR4/NF-κB pathway and involves dysregulated
  epigenetic operation by miRNAs known to be involved in these pathways. These miRNAs
  are constitutively expressed in endothelial cells (left panel). Stimulation of monocytes
  by IFNα and/or LPS changes the miRNA content within the exosomes and thereby the
  recipient endothelial cells (middle). Inhibiting the release of exosomes or TLR4
  or NF-κB reverse this effect (right).
