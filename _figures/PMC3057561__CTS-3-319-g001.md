caption: 'Model of human Th17 differentiation: IL‐1 signaling appears to cooperate
  with a pathway driven by TGF‐β+ IL‐6/IL‐21/IL‐23 to induce human Th17 cells, associated
  with expression of ROR‐c and Stat3. IL‐23 might promote differentiation of human
  Th17 cells to a pathogenic phenotype, which contribute to autoimmune pathology.
  Human Th17 cells, depending on the stage of development, might lose Th17 phenotype
  or be redirected to Th1 cells by IFN‐γ/IL‐27/IL‐12, Th2 cells by IL‐4, or Tregs
  by IL‐2.'
