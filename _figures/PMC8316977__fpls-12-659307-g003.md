caption: The regulatory genes involved in seed germination in rice. Most of the genes
  regulate seed germination mainly through GA, ABA, and ROS pathways in rice. Rice
  GD1, OsIPMS1, and MYBS1/MYBS2 regulate seed germination by influencing αAmy expression
  through GA pathway. Rice OsPYL, OsDSG1, OsIAGLU, OsFbx352, and OsMFT2 regulate seed
  germination involved in ABA pathway. Rice HDA705 regulates seed germination through
  GA and ABA pathways. Rice qSE3, OsAPX1, and OsRACK1A regulate seed germination involved
  in the crosstalk between ABA and ROS pathways. A number of genes have been reported
  to be involved in seed germination under stress conditions. Rice qLTG3-1 and OsSAP16
  regulate low-temperature germinability, and qSE3 regulates seed germination under
  salt condition, and OsB12D1, TPP7, miR393a, and OsCBL10 regulate seed germination
  under flooding condition. Arrows and lines with slanted dashes indicate positive
  and negative effects, respectively. ABA, abscisic acid; GA, gibberellin; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; ATP, adenosine-triphosphate; LTG, low-temperature germinability;
  GD1, germination-defective 1; OsIPMS1, isopropylmalate synthase; OsAmy, alpha-amylases;
  HDA705, RPD3/HDA1-type histone deacetylase; OsFbx352, F-box protein; OsPYL, pyrabactin
  resistance 1 like; OsDSG1, delayed seed germination 1; OsMFT2, mother of FT and
  TFL 1; OsIAGLU, indole-3-acetate betaglucosyltransferase; qSE3, QTL for seedling
  establishment under salinity stress; OsRACK1A, rice receptor for activated C kinase
  1; OsAPX1, ascorbate peroxidase; ZFP36, zinc finger transcription factor; qLTG3-1,
  QTL for seed germination under low temperature; OsSAP16, stress-associated protein
