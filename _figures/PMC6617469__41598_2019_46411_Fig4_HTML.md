caption: 'Expressional change of genes for the central carbon metabolic network in
  Kmmig1. The ratio of the transcriptional level of each gene in Kmmig1 to that in
  the parental strain that is presented by log2(fold change) is shown at the right
  bottom side. Red-coloured bars: significantly up-regulated genes in Kmmig1; blue-coloured
  bars: significantly down-regulated genes; black-coloured bars: not significantly
  changed genes. In the central carbon metabolic network, significantly up-regulated
  and down-regulated genes in Kmmig1 are represented in red and blue, respectively,
  and genes that were not significantly changed in Kmmig1 are represented in black.
  Further details are given in Supplementary Information File .'
