caption: Divergent roles of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in colon carcinogenesis.
  MyD88 deficiency in the models of colon carcinogenesis shown on the left side of
  the figure in which mucosa damage is limited [e.g., repeated treatments with the
  azoxymethane (AOM) carcinogen, ApcMin/+ or Il10−/− mice] and protects against tumor
  growth, probably by limiting in hematopoietic cells the inflammatory response downstream
  of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) triggered by commensal bacteria or their products
  (pathway A) [,,,]. Once polyps are formed, they are characterized by increased permeability
  allowing bacterial trans-mucosal translocation (B) and tumor promotion due to an
  increased inflammatory response, dominated by the production of interleukin-23 (IL-23)
  that induces T helper 17 (Th17) cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) to produce
  IL-22 and IL-17 (C) []. IL-22 is important in mucosal homeostasis and repair []
  and is regulated at the level of production as well as by the amount of IL-22 binding
  protein (IL-22BP) produced (D) []. However, persistence of IL-22 after mucosal repair
  prolongs epithelial cell proliferation favoring polyp formation (E) []. Thus, IL-22-deficient
  mice have decreased and IL-22BP-deficient mice have increased carcinogenesis in
  these models []. In the AOM/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model of colon carcinogenesis
  shown on the right side of the figure, the extensive mucosal damage and erosion
  induced by DSS allow massive trans-mucosal microbial translocation with an excessive
  inflammatory response []. Microbes, in part through the release of short chain fatty
  acids (SCFAs) [], induce epithelial cells to produce IL-18 (F) that has a mucosa
  protective effect by blocking the production of IL-22BP (G), thus increasing the
  bioavailability of IL-22 (H) for mucosa tissue repairs []. MyD88-deficient mice
  lack the IL-18 protective effect because of the role of MyD88 in IL-18R signaling
  while they are able to produce colon damaging and tumor-inducing inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-11 and IL-6 (I) even in the absence of TLR and IL-1R signaling []. Thus,
  MyD88-deficient mice have a dramatically increased susceptibility to AOM/DSS-induced
  colitis and carcinogenesis [,–]. This phenotype is in part reproduced by mice unable
  to produce IL-18 (Il18−/−), to process pro-IL-18 (Nlrp3−/−, Nlrp6−/−, ASC−/−, or
  Caspase1−/−) or to signal in response to IL-18 (Il18r−/− ) [,]. Also, deficiency
  of IL-18 functions results in dysbiosis (J) with expansion of colitis-inducing bacteria
  such as TM7 and Prevotella spp. []. In the AOM/DSS model, IL-22-deficient mice show
  increased and IL-22BP-deficient mice decreased susceptibility to colitis-associated
  cancer [].
