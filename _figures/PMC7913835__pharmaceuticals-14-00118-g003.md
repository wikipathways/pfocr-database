caption: 'Protein–protein interaction network between gene products with high-impact
  variants contained in the top enriched pathways and those presenting differentially
  methylated sites in CLZ-treated patients. Proteins are grouped by colors according
  to the pathway they are involved in (e.g., proteins in red: circadian entrainment;
  blue: insulin secretion; yellow: thyroid hormone signaling pathway; green: GABAergic
  synapse). Clusters are based on STRING analysis. The center of the figure highlights
  the close interactions between nodes.'
