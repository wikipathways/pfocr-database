caption: Schematic illustration of the novel proposed mechanisms of the anti-angiogenic
  impact of Resvega® (RGA), which is able to target several angiogenesis molecular
  pathways in human ARPE-19 retina cell model. RGA counteracts angiogenic VEGF-A production
  through an alteration of the AKT/PI3K and NFκB pathways. In detail, RGA reduces
  the regulator complex IKK controlling the downstream NFκB subunits P65 and P50 belonging
  and their nuclear/cytosolic localization. This new RGA-targeted pathway complements
  data on the impact of RGA, which we have previously demonstrated to be involved
  in preventing activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in ARP19 cells []. The disruption
  of these two important angiogenesis signaling pathways likely leads to a sensitization
  of retina cells to the anti-VEGF treatment, resulting in an increased ability of
  Avastin® to decrease VEGF-A secretion over time.
