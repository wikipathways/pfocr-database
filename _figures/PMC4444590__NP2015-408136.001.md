caption: Mitochondrial complex I dysfunction in patients with BD could lead to increased
  release of superoxide anions, resulting in greater reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  production. This release of ROS causes a conformational change in NLRP3 such that
  the pyrin domain (PYD) becomes available recruit ASC. The combining of NLRP3 and
  ASC that allows for the recruitment of caspase 1 (csp1) through ASC's CARD domain,
  causing the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The inflammasome then migrates
  to the mitochondria, allowing it to be close to the site of damage. Activated NLRP3
  inflammasome releases caspase 1 into the cytosol, which then cleaves and activates
  two downstream cytokines, Il-1beta and Il-18, causing them to be released into the
  extracellular space. These two cytokines cause the activation of downstream pathways,
  which may differ depending on the type of immune cell. Indeed, NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation may underlie the different patterns of cytokine activation observed in
  the brain and peripheral samples of patients with BD, where alterations in cytokines
  pertaining to the IL-1 pathway have been reported for the brain, while a more general
  pattern of cytokine activation involving IL-6 and TNF-alpha has been reported in
  the periphery. Cytokine activation in the periphery can lead to various immune disorders,
  including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while, in the brain, it could lead
  to alterations in neurotransmitters and neurodegeneration.
