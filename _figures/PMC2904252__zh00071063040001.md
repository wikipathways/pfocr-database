caption: 'Schematic presentation of the polyamine metabolic pathway. Spermidine (Spd)
  and spermine (Spm) are synthesized by the sequential addition of aminopropyl groups
  derived from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine onto putrescine (Put) and Spd to
  form Spd and Spm, respectively. Catabolism of polyamines proceeds via 2 distinct
  pathways: 1) the back conversion pathway [spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase/polyamine
  oxidase (SSAT/PAO)] or 2) the oxidation of Spm by spermine oxidase (SMO). In the
  polyamine back conversion pathway, Spd and Spm are acetylated by SSAT and then oxidized
  by PAO, leading to generation of Put and catabolic by-products [i.e., hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2), acetyl-3-aminopropionaldehyde]. The SMO oxidizes Spm directly and generates
  Spd, H2O2, and 3-aminopropanal.'
