caption: 'Mechanisms of action of Nutraceuticals (Ns) and Ozone (O3) on NF-kB (nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells)/Keap1 (kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein)/Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) molecular pathways.
  Here, we illustrate how NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2 signalling pathways involved in the
  neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s Disease mechanisms can be therapeutic
  targets for Nutraceuticals (Ns) and Ozone (O3) molecule. In the absence of stimuli,
  NF-κB is found in cytoplasm bound to the inhibitory IκB (nuclear factor of kappa
  light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cell inhibitor) proteins. In response to stimuli
  (Reactive oxygen species, ROS), IκB proteins are rapidly phosphorylated by IκB kinase
  and ultimately degraded by the 26S proteasome. The resulting release of NF-κB and
  subsequent translocation to the nucleus promote its action on target genes involved
  in inflammation/immunity (pro-inflammatory cytokines). If chronic, this can provoke
  neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration. O3 (by second messengers: Hydrogen Peroxide,
  H2O2 and 4-Hydroxynonenal, 4HNE) and Ns can block this system, contributing to an
  anti-inflammatory response. On the other hand, the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway is organized
  in this way: in the absence of stimuli, Nrf2 binds to its repressor Keap1, an adapter
  between Nrf2 and Cullin 3 protein, which leads to ubiquitination followed by proteasome
  degradation. Under oxidative stress, after heterodimerization with the Muscoloaponeurotic
  Fibrosarcoma (MAFs), the Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus, where it dimerizes and
  binds to ARE (Antioxidant Response Element) genes: Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Glutathione
  (GSH), Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST), Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), heme oxygenase
  1 (HO-1), NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and other anti-oxidant enzymes,
  provoking a strong anti-oxidant response. HO-1 is a gene encoding enzyme that catalyses
  the degradation of heme in carbon monoxide (CO), that in turn is an inhibitor of
  the NF-κB pathway, thereby decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  HO-1 directly inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokines and activates the anti-inflammatory
  cytokines. Keap1 can also prevents NF-κB activity via IKK (IκB kinase) inhibition.
  O3 (by second messengers: Hydrogen Peroxide, H2O2 and 4-Hydroxynonenal, 4HNE) and
  Ns can activate Keap1/Nrf2 signalling exercising both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant
  effects. O3 and Ns can activate pro-autophagy and anti-apoptosis mechanisms and
  block proteosome degradation. Ns can have significant effects on Aβ and τ toxicity
  and aggregation, decreasing the neurodegeneration.'
