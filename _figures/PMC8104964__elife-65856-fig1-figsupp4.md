caption: LPS binding to TLR4 at the cell surface initially activates the MYD88-dependent
  signaling pathway, which results in activation of NF-κB and production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α. Endocytosis of the LPS-TLR4 complex leads to activation
  of the TRIF-dependent signaling pathway, which both further activates NF-κB and
  initiates an interferon response. Labels of genes mentioned in the main text are
  bolded. For genes with mismatched protein and gene names, protein names are indicated
  with gene names in parentheses.
