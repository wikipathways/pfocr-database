caption: Activation of the Wnt/Fz ligand-receptor leads to the production of the second
  messengers IP3 and DAG from membrane-bound PIP2 via the action of membrane-bound
  enzyme PLC. IP3 causes a release of Ca2+ from the ER and extracellular Ca2+ influx
  through transmembrane Ca2+ channels; CaN and CamKII are activated which in turn
  activate NFAT and NFkB. DAG is also activated by increased intracellular Ca2+, which
  activates PKC. PKC activates NFkB and CREB. NFAT, NFkB, and CREB translocate to
  the nucleus and transcribe downstream regulatory genes such as Runx2. Elevated Runx2
  activity increases OPG production while simultaneously decreasing RANKL production.
  BMP2, upregulated by extracellular Ca2+, can affect this pathway by binding to BMP2
  receptors which activate PI3k. PI3k activates the gamma subunit of PLC increasing
  its conversion of IP3 and DAG [,].
