caption: 'Mechanisms of acquired PARP inhibitor resistance in ovarian cancer. 1. PARP
  enzymes are responsible for single strand break repairs in the DNA through base
  excision repair pathway. DNA double strand break repair is impared in homologous
  recombination deficient (HRD) cells. The HRD cancer cells are sensitive to PARP
  inhibition, and vulnerable to death given the synthetic lethality effect of blocking
  PARP. 2. Acquired resistance to PARP inhibition is represented by: 2A. DNA end protection
  loss and/or replication fork restoration, which may occur due to loss of nucleases
  recruitment and fork reversal degradation. 2B Homologous recombination restoration,
  represented mainly by the acquired somatic mutations or epigenetic changes, restoring
  the function of homologous recombination proteins. 2C. Drug-target mechanisms, including
  diminishment of trapping of PARP and increase of the drug efflux. The former is
  secondary to the overexpression of the ABCB1 trans-membranal drug efflux pump. The
  PARP inhibitor is diffused into the cell, without the need of any mediator. The
  ABCB1 pump is overexpressed in the cell membrane, increasing the efflux of the PARP
  inhibitor, and reducing the intracellular PARP inhibitor concentration.'
