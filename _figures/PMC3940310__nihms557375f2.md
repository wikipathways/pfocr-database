caption: Pathways for hepatic fatty acid synthesis (FASN). (a) The pathway describes
  the conversion of dietary glucose to palmitate by de novo lipogenesis; the pathway
  requires acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC)-1 and fatty acid synthase. Palmitate (16:0)
  is a product of de novo lipogenesis but is also derived from the diet. Palmitate
  is subsequently elongated [fatty acid elongase (Elov)l5 and Elovl6] and desaturated
  [stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD)] to form C16–18 saturated and monounsaturated (ω7
  and ω9) fatty acids. (b) The essential fatty acids, linoleic acid (18:2, ω6) and
  α-linolenic acid (18:3, ω3), are derived from the diet. These fatty acids are desaturated
  [fatty acid desaturases (FADS)1 and FADS2] and elongated (Elovl2 and Elovl5) to
  form the major C20–22 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) appearing in cells, i.e.,
  arachidonic acid (ARA; 20:4, ω6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6, ω3). DHA production
  requires peroxisomal β-oxidation (p-βOx). C22 PUFAs are retroconverted to C20 PUFAs
  by p-βOx.
