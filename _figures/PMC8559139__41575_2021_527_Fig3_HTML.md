caption: ALD, alcohol-associated liver disease; AUD, alcohol use disorder; eGFR, estimated
  glomerular filtration rate. *Preferred biomarker is phosphatidyl ethanol (PEth)
  given its ability to detect moderate to severe alcohol use up to 4 weeks prior.
  **FDA/EDA-approved medication for AUD. ***Topiramate should be avoided in patients
  with hepatic encephalopathy. This proposed algorithm has not yet been validated
  or tested in clinical practice, so further studies are needed to assess its broad
  use.
