caption: Alternative BA synthetic pathway manipulated by gut microbiota. (1) Gut bacteria
  express 7-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7-HSDH) which catalyzes the epimerization
  of BA 7-hydroxyl groups and converts the primary non-12-OH BA (CDCA) to UDCA. (2)
  Non-12-OH BAs can be produced by a non-bacteria metabolic process. (3) Gut bacterial
  species might also express 12α-dehydroxylase activity, which would convert 12-OH
  BAs to non-12-OH BAs. The activation of the alternative pathway accelerates BA circulation
  and fecal excretion and suppresses hepatic cholesterol and lipid metabolism
