caption: Ratio heatmaps of identified canonical TCR signaling proteins that showed
  significant changes of phosphopeptide abundance for both types of stimulation (q
  value < 0.05; > 2–fold or < 0.5-fold). Depicted is the canonical TCR signaling pathway
  with quantitative ratio heatmaps beside each protein, corresponding to the changes
  in phoshphorylation between stimulated cells (cold or CD3/4 antibody stimulation)
  and control cells. Cold vs control is the heatmap square on the left of each pair
  while CD3/4 vs control is on the right. Data represent five biological replicate
  experiments. Green represents elevated phosphorylation in stimulated cells relative
  to control whereas red was elevated in control relative to stimulation. White dots
  within the heatmap indicate statistically significant differences.

  of T cells closely mimics soluble antibody stimulation.
