caption: BMP attaches to extracellular matrix (A) through the binding of integrins
  (B). The cascade of events after the binding of BMP (C) to its receptors (D) include
  the activation of R-SMAD (SMAD 1, 5 and 8) through phosphorylation (E), thereafter,
  binding with SMAD 4 to form a complex that enters the nucleus and binds to DNA causing
  the transcription of osteoblastic genes.
