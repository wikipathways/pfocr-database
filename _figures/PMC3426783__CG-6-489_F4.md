caption: 'IPA network analyses were applied to differentially expressed genes in mouse
  brain after in vivo ketamine exposure. The two top networks were merged to create
  the gene interaction network that involved Tnnt 1 (oval), which is regulated by
  Fox O1 (circle) and involved in the Calcium signaling pathway (rectangle). Dark
  gray color: up-regulated genes. Light gray color: down-regulated genes. White color:
  genes that were not differentially expressed after ketamine treatment.'
