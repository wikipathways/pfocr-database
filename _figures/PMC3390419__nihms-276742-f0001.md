caption: Three major apoptotic pathways, initiated by the apical caspase-2, −9, and
  −8/10, are depicted. In the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, caspase-8 (or caspase-10)
  is activated upon the binding of a cognate ligand such as Fas ligand through the
  formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which includes a death
  receptor (for example, Fas) and a death domain-containing adaptor protein (for example,
  Fas-associated death domain or FADD). Once active, caspase-8 directly cleaves and
  activates executioner caspases (for example, caspase-3) and/or the BH3-only protein
  Bid, which activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by triggering oligomerization
  (activation) of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. Bax/ Bak activation is promoted
  by cleaved Bid (tBid), as well as other BH3-only proteins; the antiapoptotic Bcl-2
  family members regulate the inhibition of Bax/Bak. The intrinsic pathway leads to
  the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space of the mitochondria to
  the cytoplasm. Binding of cytochrome c induces oligomerization of the adaptor protein
  Apaf-1, which recruits and activates caspase-9 (through formation of the apoptosome),
  leading to activation of executioner caspases. Caspase-2 is activated through the
  PIDDosome, which consists of the two adaptor proteins, PIDD (p53-induced protein
  with a death domain) and RAIDD (RIP-associated ICH-1/CED-3 homologous protein with
  a death domain). Only a few direct caspase-2 substrates have been identified, and
  apoptotic pathways induced by the activation of caspase-2 appear to be mediated
  at least in part by the cleavage of Bid.
