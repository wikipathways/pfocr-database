caption: The role of p53 and AKT/mTOR in cellular responses to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
  UV activates both, p53 and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. An intact p53 response in
  irradiated cells leads to cell cycle arrest to enable damage repair and eventually
  to induce apoptotic cell death when the damage is too severe and/or repair remains
  incomplete. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are negatively regulated by AKT/mTOR
  activity. Thus, AKT/mTOR can enforce proliferation. It also prevents autophagy,
  a mechanism to recycle damaged proteins or organelles that remain under the control
  of p53. So far, AKT/mTOR can counteract the activity of p53 in response to UV irradiation
  and vice versa. At last, p53 in concert with AKT/mTOR signaling can drive cells
  to premature senescence, an irreversible cell-cycle arrest that counteracts oncogenic
  transformation. Shifting the balance between p53 and AKT/mTOR signaling can determine
  between either cell death or survival and clonal expansion of irradiated cells.
