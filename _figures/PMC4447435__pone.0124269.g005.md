caption: AP-site lesions in DNA that are formed by spontaneous hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic
  bond or by removal of inappropriate bases by DNA N-glycosylases are recognized by
  PARP-1 [,,]. By virtue of the presence of PARP-1 in the pol β complex, the complex
  is recruited to the AP-site in DNA. Upon binding to AP-site, PARP-1 is auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated
  []. While the complex remains bound to the AP-site DNA strand, BER may proceed either
  by an APE1-dependent (left-hand side of the scheme) or APE1-independent (right-hand
  side of the scheme) pathway. In the case of the APE1-dependent pathway, APE1 incises
  the AP-site, while the complex is still bound to the AP-site. The dRP removal, DNA
  synthesis and ligation steps are conducted. On the other hand, in situations where
  APE1 is deficient, APE1-independent BER operates where PNKP plays a central role
  []. In this case, for example, the complex bound at the AP-site incises the DNA
  strand by its PARP-1’s lyase activity []. Tdp1 and/or PNKP trim or edit the 3′blocked
  group to generate the 3′-OH necessary for the DNA synthesis and ligation steps,
  respectively. PAPR-1 is depicted as the blue triangle in the pol β complex.
