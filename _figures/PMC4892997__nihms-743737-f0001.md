caption: Upon infection viral ligands (ss/ds RNA/DNA, RNA/DNA hybrids, glycoproteins)
  are detected by host viral sensors (PRRs, TLRs, ALRs, NLRs) which signal through
  STING and MAVS to activate IRFs and NFkB, which in turn move in to nucleus, bind
  to IFN promoter and drive IFN expression. Primary IFNs are secreted out of the cell
  where they bind to IFNAR and initiate JAK-STAT pathway. This involves formation
  of ISGF3 with STATs and IRF9, which translocate into the nucleus and bind to ISRE
  elements to drive expression of ISGs. Among ISGs are antiviral effectors, IFN signaling
  enhancers (IFNs, IRFs, STATs, PRRs) and inhibitors (SOCS, USP18). PRRs can also
  lead to formation of inflammasome complex which activates caspase 1 and initiates
  cell death response upon viral infection.
