caption: When gefitinib resistance occurs, the cancer cells would try to break through
  the EGFR/STAT3 signaling pathway. Due to the persistent inhibition of EGFR by gefitinib,
  they had to compensatively activate other signaling pathways which pass through
  STAT3. Blocking STAT3 activation by LL1 can reactivate the efficacy of gefitinib.
