caption: . Proposed effect of vasodilatory-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) on insulin
  resistance and inflammatory signaling in multiple organs. Nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic
  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway activates VASP, which inhibits nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) activation; thereby, further inhibiting downstream inflammatory processes
  and enhancing insulin sensitivity. The schematic end-result of NO/cGMP/VASP signaling
  suggests its role against cardiometabolic disorders such as metabolic syndrome,
  type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases. Adapted from Cheng et al.
