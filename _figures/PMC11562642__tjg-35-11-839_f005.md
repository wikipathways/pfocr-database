caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the toxicity mechanism of MNNG in the gastric
  mucosa and the protection mechanism of FA against MNNG-induced gastric mucosal injury.
  Upon exposure to MNNG, the NF-κB signaling pathway is effectively activated in the
  gastric mucosa of rats. This induces the transcription of NLRP3, as well as pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α. Formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and
  subsequent auto-catalysis of pro Caspase-1 lead to the proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18, resulting in the production of mature IL-1β and IL-18, respectively,
  thereby exacerbating the inflammatory response. Additionally, MNNG exposure activated
  the PI3K/AKT pathway to augment gastric mucosal injury. Importantly, FA provides
  enhanced protection against MNNG-induced gastric mucosal injury by inhibiting the
  NF-κB/NLRP3 and PI3K/AKT pathways
