caption: Contribution of SARS-CoV-2 to neurodegeneration via invasion into CNS. SARS-CoV-2
  can directly invade olfactory bulb, penetrate brain via retrograde axonal transport
  from peripheral nerve endings, or reach brain via hematogenous pathway. Virus invasion
  along with excessive peripheral cytokine production, due to the septicemia, upregulate
  central cytokine production and will enhance the microglial activation, which along
  with T cell infiltration lead to neuroinflammation and contribute to neurodegeneration.
  Furthermore, it has been shown that SARS-CoV spike protein can promote Endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response, impair autophagy and proteostasis in mitochondria
  and culminate in misfolded protein accumulation and apoptosis
