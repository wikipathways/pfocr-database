caption: The complex network of protein–protein interactions of Ape1. Ape1 is a multifunctional
  protein with a role in DNA repair to maintain genomic integrity and a function in
  cellular redox signaling to activate key transcription factors, leading to changes
  in expression of genes involved in crucial cellular processes. In addition to these
  functions, Ape1 interacts with several different proteins from the BER pathway and
  other DNA repair and signaling pathways to create a complex mesh of direct and indirect
  interactions. This matrix is a graphical representation of the molecular relationships
  between genes or gene products (proteins or complexes). Each gene or protein is
  represented as a node and the lines (edges) joining them represent the biological
  relationships between them. At least one reference from the literature, from a textbook,
  or from canonical information stored in the Ingenuity knowledge base corroborates
  each edge. Orthologs of a gene (human, mouse, and rat) are represented as a single
  node in the network but are stored as separate objects in the Ingenuity knowledge
  base. The various shapes of the nodes represent the functional class of that gene
  product. The nature of an edge is descriptive of the nature of the relationship
  between the nodes (e.g., solid line indicates a direct relationship, dashed line
  indicates an indirect relationship, etc). This interaction network was generated
  through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems®, www.ingenuity.com).
