caption: Independent lines of evidence show that many CNS inhibitors and their receptors
  are present at or near synapses. Nogo receptors suppress dendritic spine formation
  in the juvenile CNS and promote spine maturation and stability in adulthood [, ,
  ]. Emerging evidence suggests that the Nogo-A/NgR1 complex antagonizes growth factor
  (FGF2 and BDNF) signaling by suppressing the activity of the mammalian target of
  rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and MAP kinase signaling from Erk1/2 to nuclear p-CREB
  pathway. mTORC1 is activated by PI3K–AKT signaling and promotes translation of synaptic
  mRNAs, including NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor subunits, via phosphorylation of
  specific downstream effectors such as elF4E binding protein (4EBP1) and p70S6-kinase
  [, ]. One negative regulatory pathway of mTOR includes phosphatase and tensin homolog
  (PTEN), a synaptic protein associated with autism spectrum disorders. How exactly
  NgR1 activates downstream signaling pathways at the synapse is largely unknown but
  may involve RhoA-ROCK-LIMK-cofilin mediated breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton.
  The extracellular matrix components hyaluronic acid (HA), CSPGs and HSPGs are found
  near synapses where they form surface compartments that limit lateral diffusion
  and exchange of AMPA-type glutamate receptors [, ]. The CSPG receptors LAR and RPTPσ
  are present both pre- and post-synaptically, but their CSPG-dependent function at
  the synapse has not yet been established. Both NgR1 and NgR3 bind CSPGs, but whether
  this interaction takes place at or near spine synapses is not known. Integrins have
  been implicated in the regulation of homeostatic synaptic plasticity, and recent
  evidence suggests an important role for integrin signaling in CSPG-mediated spine
  morphogenesis [].
