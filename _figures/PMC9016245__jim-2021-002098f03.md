caption: Airway remodeling and mitochondria. The accumulation of dysmorphic mitochondria
  is related with asthma and airway remodeling and will be done with increased ASM
  mass and fibroblast dysfunction. TGF-β induces PRMT1 expression in lung fibroblasts
  and can regulate post-translational arginine methylation which play important roles
  in signal transduction and events in the extracellular milieu. Arginine methylation
  displays a novel protein modification which is implicated in the intracellular signaling,
  DNA repair and processing, protein–protein interaction, and gene expression regulation.
  PRMT1 upregulates extracellular matrix deposition through ERK1/2-STAT1 signaling.
  The TGF-β-activated signal pathway augments PRMT1 expression and caused mitochondria
  dysfunction through the SMAD2/3, C/EBPb, PRMT1, PGC-1a signaling sequence. The TGF-β1
  and C/EBPb are upstream of PGC-1a and PRMT1 expression. In the alveolar macrophages
  and epithelial cells, TGF-β1 overexpression induces mitochondria dysfunction that
  leads to remodeling of bronchi.
