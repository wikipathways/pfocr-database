caption: The production and function of S1P in the intestine. S1P is generated in
  the intestine through SMase pathway, de novo synthesis and rescue pathway, and the
  de novo synthesis pathway is the main one. In the SMase pathway, bioactive SLs are
  hydrolyzed to ceramides by SMases, and in the endoplasmic reticulum, serine and
  palmitoyl-coA are synthesized by the de novo pathway. Ceramide is transported to
  the Golgi apparatus to generate sphingosine under the action of ceramidase, S1P
  under the catalysis of intracellular SphK1/2, and hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine
  under the action of SPL. In addition, sphingosine can also be acylated by ceramide
  synthetase to form ceramides in the ER, a process known as the “salvage pathway.”
