caption: Metabolism of chemotherapeutic drugs-related gene polymorphisms. In cancer
  cells 5-FU is converted to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP). 5-FdUMP
  inhibits the DNA synthesis by competing with deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) for
  binding to thymidylate synthase (TS) in a complex that is stabilized by the reduced
  folate 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. 5-FU can also inhibit RNA synthesis in a
  pathway that involves its metabolism to 5-fluorouridinemonophosphate (5-FUMP) and
  subsequent conversion to 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (5-FUTP) via 5-fluorouridine
  diphosphate (5-FUDP). The main effect of cyclophosphamide is due to its metabolite
  phosphoramide mustard that forms DNA crosslinks both between and within DNA strands
  at guanine N-7 positions (known as interstrand and intrastrand crosslinkages, respectively).
  This is irreversible and leads to cell apoptosis. Anthracyclines inhibit DNA and
  RNA synthesis by intercalating between base pairs of the DNA/RNA strand, thus preventing
  the replication of rapidly growing cancer cells. In addition, they can generate
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) damaging DNA, proteins and cell membranes. Glutathione
  S-transferases (GSTs) catalyse the detoxification of alkylating agents used in chemotherapy
  and/or ROS
