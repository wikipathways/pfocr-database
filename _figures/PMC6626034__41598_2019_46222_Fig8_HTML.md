caption: A putative model for TmIMD-mediated regulation of AMPs in response to the
  Gram-negative bacteria E. coli. (A) In Tenebrio, PGRP-LC senses bacterial and/or
  fungal pathogens and processes the signal via the cleavage of the cytoplasmic adapter
  protein IMD. Subsequently, IMD drives the phosphorylation of the NF-κB homolog in
  the IMD pathway, Relish. Activated Relish translocates to the nucleus and controls
  the transcriptional activation of specific AMP genes. However, the nexus between
  the pathogen types that regulate the expression of specific sets of AMP genes remains
  obscure. (B) We propose that the knockdown of IMD transcripts prevents the activation
  and subsequent translocation of Relish to the nucleus, thereby downregulating the
  expression of nine AMP genes in the Tenebrio model system.
