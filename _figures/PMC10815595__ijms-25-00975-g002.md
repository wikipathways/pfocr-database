caption: HBV-HCC pathways of top 10 upregulated miRNA. The top 10 upregulated miRNAs
  influence viral carcinogenesis primarily by modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis.
  This panel can modulate cell proliferation in MAPK pathways by targeting SRC/RAS/MAPK/CREB,
  as well as by targeting JAK/STAT3/5 in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This panel
  appears to be able to modulate apoptosis by targeting 14-3-3, CASP3 and p53, as
  well as P13K in the P13K/AKT pathway and NF-kB in NF-kB signaling (See Table 1 and
  the Discussion section for further verification of direct HCC role)
