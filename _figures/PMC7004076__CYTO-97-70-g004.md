caption: Potential molecular mechanisms of YQCT. (a) Genes regulated by YQCT. Orange
  nodes represented chemical components and blue nodes represented genes. (b) GO term
  enrichment results. The color of each node indicated the significance of the enriched
  term, the redder meant the higher relevance. The size of each node represented the
  number of GO term associated genes, the bigger meant the higher association. The
  names of most significant terms in each cluster were shown. (c) KEGG pathway enrichment
  results. The color of each node indicated the significance of the enriched term,
  the redder meant the higher relevance. The size of each node represented the number
  of KEGG term associated genes, the bigger meant the higher association. The names
  of most significant terms in each cluster were shown. [Color figure can be viewed
