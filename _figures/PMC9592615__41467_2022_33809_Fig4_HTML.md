caption: (i) The carbamylation of nitride complex 1 with phenyl chloroformate affords
  carbamate complex 2. (ii) Reductive carbon−oxygen bond cleavage in the carbamate
  ligand of 2 produces isocyanate complex 4a. (iii) After one-electron reduction,
  the dissociation of the chloride ligand of 4a affords a five-coordinate isocyanate
  complex. A pair of the isocyanate complex sandwiches a dinitrogen molecule to form
  a dinitrogen-bridged dimolybdenum complex with a Mo–N≡N–Mo core, which is a precursor
  of [{MoI(PNP)}2(μ-N2)] A. (iv) The bridging N2 ligand of A undergoes a direct N≡N
  bond cleavage to regenerate 1.
