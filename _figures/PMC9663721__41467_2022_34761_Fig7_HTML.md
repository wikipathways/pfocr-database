caption: The signal peptide-containing P26s/poxins (labeled with red spot) from alphabaculoviruses
  or parasitoid wasps appear to contain both extracellular and intracellular immune
  suppression functions, whilst those without signal peptide either only harbor intracellular
  cGAMP degrading activity or lack both activities. Whether or not secreted P26 homologs
  from lepidopteran hosts function as extracellular melanization inhibitors is unclear
  and, thus, shown in gray background. In the cytoplasm of mammalian and insect cells,
  2′3′-cGAMP produced by cGAS or cGAS-like receptor (cGLR) in response to dsDNA ligand
  can be inhibited by poxin/P26’s nuclease activity; while a novel 3′2′-cGAMP generated
  in Drosophila by cGLR1 in response to dsRNA ligand stimulation is resistant to poxin/P26.
  In insect hemolymph, secreted poxin/P26 proteins inhibit insect melanization pathway
  by targeting the key co-factor of a PPO activating protease, at least in baculovirus
  HearNPV-H.armigera infection system. They may also degrade extracellular 2′3′-cGAMP,
  which needs further study.
