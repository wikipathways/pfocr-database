caption: Control of the TRAF6 signalosome by miR-146a. Activated Toll-like receptor
  (TLR) or lnterleukin-1 receptor (IL1R) results in the recruitment of MyD88 and IRAK4,
  which activates the serine/threonine kinase, IRAKI, through IRAK4-dependent phosphorylation
  (dashed line). IRAKI associates with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRAF6, which mediates
  the activation of the IKK complex through K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, resulting
  in NF-κB transcription factor activation. TRAF6 also regulates other proteins (as
  indicated by grey box) that may also contribute to immune signaling and malignancies.
  miR-146a suppresses IRAKI and TRAF6 protein expression through direct binding at
  3′UTR sites within IRAKI and TRAF6 mRNAs. Reduced expression and/or deletion of
  miR-146a results in derepression of IRAKI and TRAF6 protein, and increased downstream
  pathway activation resulting in reduced HSC fitness, increased inflammatory cytokine
  expression, and altered myeloid differentiation. miR-146a also represses STAT1 and
  CXCR4 in hematopoietic cells, which may also contribute to the HSC defects following
  deletion of miR-146a.
