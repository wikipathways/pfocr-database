caption: Mechanism of mcr‐mediated colistin resistance; adapted from (Sun et al.,
  ). (a) Schematic representation for LPS‐lipid A modification by MCR‐2 in E. coli.
  In the cytoplasm, bacterial LPS‐lipid A is synthesized using UDP‐GlcNAc as the primer
  substrate. The fatty acid intermediates (C12 and C14) from the bacterial type II
  fatty acid synthesis (FAS II) pathway enter into the conservative 10‐step route
  of lipid A synthesis involving nine enzymes (LpxA, LpxC, LpxD, LpxH, LpxB, LpxK,
  LpxL, LpxM, and KdtA). The nascent lipid A from the cytoplasm is translocated by
  the ABC transporter MsbA, a lipid flippase (35), across the inner membrane into
  the periplasm. The integral membrane protein MCR‐2 is supposed to be localized on
  the periplasm side of inner membrane and catalyzes the chemical modification of
  the 2‐keto‐3‐deoxyoctulosonic acid (Kdo2)‐lipid A, giving Kdo2‐PEA‐4 = ‐lipid A.
  The modified form of Kdo2‐lipid A, Kdo2‐PEA‐4 = ‐lipid A, then is exported by LptABCFG
  and LptDE into the outer leaflet of the outer membrane (36), thus reducing the negative
  membrane charge. That is the reason for the low/decreased affinity of bacterial
  surface to the cationic antibiotic polymyxin. (b) Chemical reaction in which MCR‐2
  catalyzes the modification of lipid A with 4 = ‐phosphatidylethanolamine. MCR‐2
  catalyzes the addition of phosphatidylethano‐ lamine to position 4 =  of lipid A,
  giving the final products of both PEA‐4 = ‐lipid A and diacylglycerol
