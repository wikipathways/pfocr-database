caption: '(A) In the case of a HR defect, such as mutations in BRCA1/2 genes, Polυ
  is overexpressed. Polυ blocks the formation of RAD51–ssDNA nucleofilament and thus
  RAD51 toxicity in cells deficient in HR. (B) At the same time, Polυ is recruited
  to DNA damage sites by PARP1 where it performs untemplated error-prone synthesis
  required for alt-EJ. Polυ recruitment to damage sites might also depend on other
  alt-EJ factors (gray circles). Abbreviation: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA.'
