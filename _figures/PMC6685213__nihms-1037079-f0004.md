caption: Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes an arsenal of viral proteins that
  modulate multiple innate immune pathways. KSHV viral interferon regulatory factor
  1 (vIRF1), viral G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) and replication and transcription
  activator (RTA) can downregulate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4, and TRIF
  (also known as TIR domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM1)), a TLR adaptor
  protein, is further inhibited by KSHV RTA. Inhibition of these TLR signalling pathways
  results in the downregulation of the type I interferon response. Ubiquitylation
  of the RNA sensor, retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I), which is crucial
  for its activation, is inhibited by KSHV ORF64, resulting in the dampening of RIG-I
  activity and inhibition of the interferon response. KSHV vIRFs and ORF45 can inhibit
  activation of cellular IRFs such as IRF3 and IRF7. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator
  of interferon genes protein (STING) is a cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, and cGAS
  activation is inhibited by KSHV ORF52 and KSHV latency-associated nuclear protein
  (LANA), whereas KSHV vIRF1 prevents STING association with the serine/threonine-protein
  kinase TBK1, thereby inhibiting interferon production through the pathway mediated
  by IRF3 and IRF7. The NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome,
  which comprises NLRP1, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD
  (ASC) and pro-caspase-1, is inhibited by KSHV ORF63, resulting in inhibition of
  IL-1β and IL-18 activation. 5'ppp, 5'-triphosphate; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA;
