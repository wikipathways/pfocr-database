caption: Predicted HumanCyc pathway for arginine degradation. The computer icon in
  the upper-right corner indicates this pathway was predicted computationally. Neither
  enzyme names nor gene names are drawn adjacent to the first three reactions of this
  pathway to indicate that these steps are pathway holes, meaning no enzyme has been
  identified for these steps in the human genome. The graphic at the bottom indicates
  the positions of genes within this pathways on the human chromosomes. Moving the
  mouse over a gene in the webpage for this diagram will identify the gene and the
  chromosome.
