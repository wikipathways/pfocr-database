caption: Role of macrophage, fibroblast and endothelial cell pathways in MAIT cells.
  IPA analysis of DEGs of MAIT cells in comparison with conventional T cells showed
  a functionally activated MAIT cell signaling pathway in association with macrophage,
  fibroblast and endothelial cell roles in rheumatoid arthritis. MAIT cells regulate
  NF-kB activity through TLRs and LT-BRs in the innate immune system while also regulating
  the NF-kB signaling pathway through receptors for IL-17 cytokines. The box indicates
  the gene involved in the biological pathway. The red box represents upregulated
  genes, but the green box shows downregulated genes. The purple box indicates already
  known important genes in each biological pathway. The information was obtained from
  the IPA database. A black (white) box indicates that there is no expression data
  from the RNA-seq experiments. Solid lines provide evidence of the directed interaction
  between two genes. However, the dotted line indicates the in-directed interaction.
