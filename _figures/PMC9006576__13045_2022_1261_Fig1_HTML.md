caption: Signaling pathways of RNA sensors in normal and cancer cells. RNA derived
  from virus infection, intracellular uptake, mitochondrial stress, chromosomal instability
  can be sensed by RNA sensors. RNA-sensing TLRs, including TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, predominately
  localize to the endosome. All RNA-sensing TLRs form homodimers upon activation.
  TLR3 recruits TRIF to activate the kinases TBK1 and IKKE via activation of TRAF,
  resulting in phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor IRF3 to
  drive type I IFN expression. TLR7 and TLR8 recruit MyD88. MyD88 then recruits the
  kinases IRAK4 and IRAK1, activates TRAF6 and TAK1, resulting in activation of IRF7
  and NF-kB which drives IFN-I expression. RIG-I, LGP2, MDA5 and NOD2 recognize intracellular
  RNA, bind to the mitochondrial located adaptor protein MAVS, and trigger the activation
  of TRAF3 to activate TBK1 and drive type I IFN expression. RIG-I senses 3pRNA though
  MAVS signaling pathway and MAD5 induces IFN responses via TBK1-IRF3 pathway
