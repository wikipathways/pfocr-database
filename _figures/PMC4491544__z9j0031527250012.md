caption: Muscle protein homeostasis in critical illness. Diagram depicts changes to
  protein metabolism caused by pathophysiological processes in critical illness including
  sepsis, inflammation, and prolonged exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Upper
  light grey boxes denote altered regulation of major steps in protein synthesis (left)
  and degradation (right). Blue boxes identify the downstream effects of altered pathway
  regulation. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; AKT, also known
  as protein kinase B; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; mTOR, mechanistic target of
  rapamycin; p70S6K, p70S6 kinase; S6, ribosomal protein S6; elF-4E, eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor-4E; 4E-BP1, elF-4E binding protein-1; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; FOXO, forkhead box-O; HDAC, histone deacetylase;
  DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid; RNA, ribonucleic acid; mRNA, messenger RNA; tRNA, transfer
  RNA; Ca2+, calcium ions; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase;
  U, ubiquitin; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ADP, adenosine diphosphate.
