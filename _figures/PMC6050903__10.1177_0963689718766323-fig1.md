caption: 'Regulated cell death signaling pathways. Regulated cell death pathways may
  be differentiated by their dependence on caspase activity. Apoptosis, a caspase-dependent
  regulated cell death pathway, can be initiated by extrinsic or intrinsic cellular
  cues. DR binding from appropriate signals, including TNF-α, initiates the extrinsic
  pathway. Alternatively, internal signals, including hypoxia and ROS, activate the
  intrinsic pathway. Both pathways converge on caspase-3 activation and result in
  morphological changes, such as plasma membrane blebbing. Since membrane integrity
  is conserved during apoptosis, this cell death modality is a poor inducer of inflammation.
  Pyroptosis, a gasdermin-dependent form of regulated cell death requires the formation
  of inflammasomes which results in the activation of caspase-1 or caspase-11. Caspase-1
  activates the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. As such, pyroptosis is
  an immunogenic form of regulated cell death. Ferroptosis results in the accumulation
  of lipid peroxides as a result of glutathione depletion and GPx4 dysfunction. Necroptosis
  can be initiated by DR-ligand binding resulting in the activation of RIPK1 and RIPK3
  with subsequent phosphorylation of MLKL. Parthanatos is triggered by diverse stimuli,
  including ROS production, resulting in the hyperactivation of PARP1 resulting in
  the prospective release of AIF.AIF: apoptosis-inducing factor; DR: death receptor;
  GPx4: glutathione peroxidase 4; IL: interleukin; MLKL: mixed lineage kinase domain-like
  protein; MOMP: mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; PARP1: poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerase 1; pMLKL: phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein; RIPK:
  receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
  TNF: tumor necrosis factor.'
