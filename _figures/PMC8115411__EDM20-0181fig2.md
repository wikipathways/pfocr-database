caption: Underlying mechanisms of gynecomastia in Graves’ disease. The figure shows
  how thyrotoxicosis results in hormonal disbalance, and thus gynecomastia. The left
  pathway shows that increased production of thyroid hormones due to Graves’ disease
  stimulate the liver into an increased expression of SHBG. HNF4A is suspected to
  play an important role as the underlying mechanism of the upregulation of SHBG.
  SHBG binds free testosterone more than estrogen, thus creating a relative low testosterone
  level in comparison to the pre-morbid state. The right pathway illustrates that
  thyroid hormones stimulate the activity of aromatase in peripheral tissue, thus
  decreasing the total amount of androgens in the body.
