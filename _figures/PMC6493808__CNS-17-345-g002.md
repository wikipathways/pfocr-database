caption: Apoptotic processes in PD. Extrinsic pathway initiated from the cell surface
  receptors (e.g., Fas) and proceeding through a cascade of events, in which caspases
  are involved. The activation of the intrinsic pathway begins with the permeabilization
  of the mitochondrial outer membrane, which leads to the release of key mitochondrial
  proteins (such as cytochrome c, Smacs, AIF, etc.). Members of the Bcl2 family of
  proteins are important modulators of pro‐ and antiapoptotic mechanisms. The inset
  shows the structure of the mitochondrion and the respiratory chain (JNK, c‐Jun N‐terminal
  kinase; Smacs, secondary mitochondria‐derived activator caspases; AIF, apoptosis
  inducing factor; Apaf‐1, apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1).
