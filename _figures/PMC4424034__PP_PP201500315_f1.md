caption: Proposed biosynthesis of α- and β-thujone in . The monoterpenenoids α- and
  β-thujone are proposed to derive from GDP through a four-step biosynthetic pathway
  starting with (+)-sabinene synthase (). Sabinene may be oxidized to either (+)-cis-
  or (+)-trans-sabinol followed by oxidation to (+)-sabinone as the proposed direct
  precursor to α- and β-thujone. Here, we provide evidence for (+)-trans-sabinol but
  not (+)-cis sabinol as an intermediate in thujone biosynthesis in the gymnosperm
  . In contrast, in the angiosperm common garden sage, thujone is formed by the (+)-cis-sabinol
  intermediate (). This article describes (+)-trans-sabinol dehydrogenase enzyme activity
  in  tissue extract and gene discovery and functional characterization of  (+)-sabinene-3-hydroxylase.
  The proposed pathway was redrawn based on .
