caption: Ceramides contribute to metabolic disorders via inhibition of PI3k/Akt as
  a common pathway between vasoconstriction and insulin resistance. Ceramides can
  facilitate the inactivation of protein kinase B (AKT) through (A) its dephosphorylation
  by protein phosphatase 2A or (B) binding to the inhibitor PKCzeta protein which
  leads to narrowing of blood vessels and inhibition of glucose transporter 4 translocation
  (glucose intolerance), respectively. [eNOS, Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase; Glut
