caption: Schematic representation of lumican’s signaling in carcinogenesis. (a) Inhibiting
  the binding of FOXO3 to the lumican promoter by the small molecular weight leads
  to decreased FOXO3-dependent lumican expression and neuroblastoma cell migration.
  (b) Upon lumican downregulation, its colocalization with p120 catenin (p120ctn)
  decreases, leading to actin cytoskeleton remodeling and accelerated lung cancer
  cell invasion. (c) Lumican-deficient hepatic cancer cells show decreased invasion
  and migration mediated by reducing IGF-IR, ERK-1, and JNK activation status. (d)
  Lumican is an upstream regulator of the TGF-β2/Smad 2 signaling pathway in an osteosarcoma
  cell model, regulating cell adhesion. (e) Lumican interacts with the integrin β1/FAK
  signaling axis, affecting tumor progression positively or negatively. (f) Lumican
  induces the dimerization of the EGFR receptors and their subsequent uptake and degradation,
  leading to attenuated PDAC cell growth. (g) Hypoxia significantly reduces lumican
  secretion from pancreatic stellate cells and results in attenuated PDAC cell growth.
  (h) Lumican affects the signaling of Snail, an EMT trigger molecule that facilitates
  cancer metastasis, attenuating melanoma metastasis to the lungs.
