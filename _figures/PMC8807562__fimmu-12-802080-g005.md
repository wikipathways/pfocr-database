caption: (A) Characterization of CAFs in the TME. CAFs are heterogeneous. Myofibroblasts
  were found to replace fibroblasts in the TME, which have a protumorigenic effect,
  with high expression of genes related to myogenesis, the Notch pathway and angiogenesis,
  and PDGF signaling is activated in the TME, which may be associated with the promotion
  of angiogenesis. (B) Characterization of ECs in the TME. The EC phenotype changes
  in the TME and appears significantly heterogeneous, which leads to tumor immunity
  toward immunosuppression. There is a strong activation of VEGF and Notch signaling
  that regulates EC development in NSCLC and downregulated expression of genes involved
  in immune activation and immune cell homing in tumor ECs, thus contributing to tumor
  immunetolerance.
