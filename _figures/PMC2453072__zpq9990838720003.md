caption: E. coli NDP kinase genetic and biochemical interactions suggest that ndk
  could function at the interface between dNTP synthesis and base excision repair.
  The uracil glycosylase base excision repair pathway (Left) and the pathway of de
  novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway (Right) are shown. Arrows with asterisk indicate
  genetic interactions identified in this study. The Ndk/Ung functional biochemical
  interaction was identified by Goswami et al. (). Additionally, Ndk and human Nm23-H2
  have been shown to cleave DNA and suggested to do so in a mechanism similar to AP
  lyases (). The schematic representation of the uracil BER pathway was adapted from
  ref. .
