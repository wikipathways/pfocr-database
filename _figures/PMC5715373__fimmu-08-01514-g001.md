caption: 'Strategies to generate tolDCs for clinical therapeutics. PBMCs or bone marrow-derived
  cells can be differentiated into tolDCs in the presence of pharmacologic agents
  and immunomodulatory cytokines. The generated tolDCs are either donor-derived (in
  the case of living-donor transplantation) or autologous (in the case of autoimmune
  diseases or transplantation) and can be further pulsed in vitro with specific antigens
  (peptides, donor cell lysates, apoptotic cells). tolDCs can regulate Teff responses
  by various mechanisms: 1. Fas/FasL pathway-mediated deletion; 2. Production of IDO
  which degrades the essential amino acid tryptophan through kynurenine pathway, causing
  starvation of Teff. The production of IDO is favored by reversed signaling via interaction
  between CD80/CD86 on DCs and CTLA-4 on regulatory T cell (Treg). 3. Surface expression
  of inhibitory molecules and secretion of regulatory mediators. Abbreviations: CTLA-4,
  cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4; IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; iTreg, induced
  regulatory T cell; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; tolDC, tolerogenic
  dendritic cell; Teff, effector T cell; Tmem, memory T cell; Tnaive, naïve T cell;
  tTreg, thymic-derived regulatory T cell.'
