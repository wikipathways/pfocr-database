caption: Schematic diagram of the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol synthesis. Nitrogen-containing
  bisphosphonates (N-BPs) inhibit farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase, preventing
  synthesis of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) required
  for the prenylation of a number of key proteins essential for cell survival. Inhibition
  of FPP synthase also causes the accumulation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which
  is incorporated into the cytotoxic metabolite ApppI (triphosphoric acid 1-adenosin-5'-yl
  ester 3-(3-methylbut-3-enyl) ester). Statins also act through this pathway by inhibition
  of HMG-CoA reductase.
