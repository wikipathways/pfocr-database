caption: Proposed model of the mechanism by which GPCRs signal via PKA and PP1 to
  promote PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Endogenous IGF1 secreted from cells activates
  the IGF1R but fails to stimulate IRS1 YXXM phosphorylation, which drives PI3K activation
  because of the presence of Ser/Thr phosphorylations on IRS1. PKA-activated downstream
  GPCRs phosphorylate the PP1 regulatory subunit MYPT1 to activate PP1. Activated
  PP1 then dephosphorylates Ser/Thr residues on IRS1, thereby stimulating IGF1R-dependent
  IRS1 YXXM phosphorylation to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. The GPCR agonists FSH
  or hCG, the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, the PKA inhibitor PKI, a CA MYPT1
  mutant, the PP1 inhibitor tautomycin, and the IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 were utilized
  in the experiments outlined here.
