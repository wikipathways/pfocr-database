caption: Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. The conserved Wnt/β-Catenin pathway regulates stem
  cell pluripotency and cell fate decisions during development. The Wnt ligand is
  a secreted glycoprotein that binds to Frizzled receptors, leading to the formation
  of a larger cell surface complex with LRP5/6. Activation of the Wnt receptor complex
  triggers displacement of the multifunctional kinase GSK-3β from a regulatory APC/Axin/GSK-3β-complex.
  In the absence of Wnt-signal (off-state), β-catenin, an integral E-cadherin cell-cell
  adhesion adaptor protein and transcriptional coregulator, is targeted by coordinated
  phosphorylation by CK1 and the APC/Axin/GSK-3β-complex leading to its ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation through the β-TrCP/Skp pathway. GSK, glycogen synthase
  kinase
