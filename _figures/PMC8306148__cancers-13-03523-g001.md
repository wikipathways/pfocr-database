caption: Known pathways related to stemness in MM. Dsh, disheveled protein; APC, adenomatous
  polyposis coli; β-ctnn, β-catenin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; DISP1, dispatched
  1; SHH, sonic hedgehog; PTCH1, patched1; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease;
  NICD, Notch1 intracellular domain; RBP-Jk, recombination signal-binding protein-Jkappa;
  MAML, mastermind-like family members. This image describes the common pathways related
  to stemness and corresponding targets in MM cells. The Wnt, Notch, and hedgehog
  pathways can regulate MM cells at the transcription level, and PI3K at the translation
  level, and all of them are involved in the regulation of cell growth, survival,
  and drug resistance. In the Wnt pathway, GSK3 β protein expression was upregulated,
  and Wnt activation was inhibited on condition of PCDH10 gene overexpression. Drugs
  such as piceatannol, bc2059, imaquinone, and ethyl monoquinone can downregulate
  β-ctnn protein and inhibit Wnt pathway. R-spondings can act on lgr4 and promote
  Wnt pathway activation. In Hedgehog pathway, Shh and Gli1 can regulate bcl-2. In
  the Notch pathway, sahn1 can bind to the intracellular domain ICN of Notch and affect
  the recruitment of MMAL. GSI (an enzyme inhibitor) can act on γ-secretase and cause
  MM cell toxicity. In the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, buparlisib can act on P110, while
  nvp-bez235 (imidazoloquinoline derivative) can bind to the ATP binding slit of PI3K
  and mTOR kinases and inhibit this pathway. These are the drug targets that have
  been studied.
