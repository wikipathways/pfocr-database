caption: Inhibition of GSK-3 activates Wnt and mTOR signaling. In the canonical Wnt
  pathway, GSK-3 and β-catenin bind to the Axin complex, along with APC. GSK-3 phosphorylates
  β-catenin, targeting it for rapid destruction. Wnt binding to the Fz/Lrp receptor
  complex causes inhibition of GSK-3, which in turn stabilizes β-catenin and activates
  Wnt target genes that promote progenitor proliferation and self renewal. In PI3K/PTEN-regulated
  pathways, growth factors (GFs) bind to surface receptors and activate PI3K, leading
  to activation of Akt, whereas PTEN inhibits activation of Akt. Once activated, Akt
  phosphorylates and inhibits GSK-3. GSK-3 phosphorylates Tsc2, inhibiting the mTOR
  pathway. Thus, inhibition of GSK-3 activates mTOR and promotes proliferation and
  exit from the LT-HSC pool. Inhibition of GSK-3 thus activates distinct downstream
  signaling pathways that have opposing functions in HSC renewal and differentiation.
