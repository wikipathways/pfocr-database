caption: (A) Illustration of TAG synthesis and lipid droplets (LDs) formation from
  free fatty acids (FAs). Free FAs enter the cells through passive diffusion and fatty
  acid transporters and are activated into the form of acyl-CoA with the help of acyl-CoA
  synthetase. After further modification by related enzymes, acyl-CoA eventually forms
  TAG and LDs in the presence of DGAT1 and DGAT2. (B) The adipogenesis pathway shows
  the last step of lipogenesis involving enzymes DGAT1/2. TAG synthesis and LD formation
  are normal when DGAT1/2 are functioning properly. (C) Inhibition of DGAT1 and DGAT
  2 using small-molecule inhibitors T863 and PF-06424439, respectively, to deplete
  cellular LDs. When DGAT1/2 are inhibited, TAG synthesis and LD formation are reduced,
  leading to increased free FAs. ER endoplasmic reticulum, DGAT diglyceride acyltransferase.
