caption: Immune system activation in AA. After the NKG2D receptor is recognized by
  the NKG2D associated ligands (MICA, ULBP3, and ULBP6), it promotes aggregation of
  CD8+NKG2D+ T cells. Activated CD8+NKG2D+ T cells mainly produce IFN-γ to upregulate
  MHC class I and II expression via the JAK-STAT pathway and generate GZMB to induce
  apoptotic cell death. Concurrently, CD8+NKG2D+ T cells increase an upregulation
  of γ-chain cytokines (IL-2 and IL-15), which create a positive feedback loop by
  promoting the activation of IFN-γ–producing CD8+NKG2D+ T cells. NK cells and CD4+
  T cell subtypes (Th17 and T reg cells) also produce IFN-γ. NK cells attack hair
  follicles upon the binding of NKG2D ligand to NKG2D receptor and through CXCR3 ligands
  expression (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11). While CD4+ T cell subtypes, initiated by
  upregulation of MHC class II, trigger several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
  PDCs play a role in the pathogenesis by producing a large amount of type I IFN to
  enhance the activation of CD8+, CD4+, and NK cells. However, TNF-α, created by CD4+
  and CD8+ T cells, also have negative effects by suppressing PDCs activity and interfering
  with the keratinocytes differentiation.
