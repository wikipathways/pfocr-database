caption: A. Routes of Administration. There are three main routes of NPs drug delivery
  to the brain (1) Oral and parenteral, (2) Intracerebroventricular injection, and
  (3) Intranasal. B. Role of a different region of Nasal Cavity in IN DDS. Intranasal
  DDS comprises two pathways that involve three regions of the nasal cavity, i.e.,
  Vestibular Region, Respiratory Region, and Olfactory region. The olfactory (major)
  and trigeminal (minor) play a significant role in drug delivery to the brain via
  the nasal route. C. Intranasal Pathway for Drug Delivery to Brain. Intranasal drug
  delivery bypasses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) due to the presence of olfactory
  nerves (Olfactory Pathway) and trigeminal nerves (Trigeminal Pathway). These nerves
  provide direct access to broad regions of the brain without any hindrance being
  posed by BBB. The intranasal pathway also involves a secondary route via systemic
  circulation, which involves the crossing of BBB. (Major pathway and neurons- Red
  color; Minor pathway and neurons- Blue color)
