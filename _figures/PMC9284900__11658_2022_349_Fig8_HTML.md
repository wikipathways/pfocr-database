caption: Graphical abstract of the whole study. METTL3 in CMs was upregulated in response
  to Ang-II, promoting m6A modification on pri-miR-221/222, thus leading to increased
  miR-221/222 expression. Subsequently, DKK2 was inhibited and Wnt/β‐catenin/c-Myc
  pathway was activated, finally promoting myocardial hypertrophy
