caption: The diagram of metabolic pathways may be affected by addition of sucrose
  for BaX030, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, pentose phosphate pathway,
  purine metabolism, fatty acid/amino acid synthesis and metabolism, etc. The marked
  genes in red corresponding to the proteins were up-regulated, and the green were
  down-regulated.
