caption: Model of the involvement of HSPs and class Ib molecules in immune surveillance
  and anti-tumor responses. A During the priming phase (adapted from []), HSP-peptide
  complexes released in the extracellular compartment from infected or stressed cells
  (e.g., apoptosis, cell lysis) are internalized by APCs through receptor-mediated
  endocytosis (e.g., CD91). (1) Antigenic peptides channeled into the class Ia presentation
  pathway specifically activate CD8 T cells. (2) HSPs internalized by the same receptors
  or interacting with other receptors (e.g., Toll-like receptors) stimulate production
  of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and up-regulate co-stimulatory molecules.
  (3) HSPs are proposed to also stimulate class Ib-mediated response by a yet unknown
  mechanism that is likely to be Ag-specific, and involve a CD8 T cell subset. B During
  the effector phase, tumor targets that have down-regulated surface class Ia molecules
  to escape recognition and lysis by conventional CTL, can still be killed by NK cells
  unless they express surface class Ib molecule that can bind inhibitory NK receptors.
  We propose that HSPs generate CCU-CTL effectors that can recognize and kill tumors
  expressing these class Ib molecules
