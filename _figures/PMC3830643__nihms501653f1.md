caption: 'A, All fatty acid synthesis mechanisms follow a similar sequence of enzymatic
  reactions. A starter molecule is transferred to the phosphopantetheinyl group on
  ACP or CoA. The starter is then elongated by two carbon atoms and involving a four-reaction
  mechanism: decarboxylative condensation with a malonyl group by a synthase, reduction
  by a ketoreductase, dehydration by a dehydratase and reduction by an enoyl reductase.
  The product is released, or condensation with another malonyl group initiates the
  next round of elongation. B, Fatty acid synthase type I. All enzymes are domains
  of a single polypeptide (note that the apicomplexan FASI has a more complex multimodular
  architecture). C, Fatty acid synthase type II. All enzymes are encoded as individual
  proteins. D, Fatty acid elongation pathway. The system consists of enzymes encoded
  as individual proteins, acting on a CoA-bound starter molecule–typically a longer
  fatty acid (16 carbon or longer). ACP, acyl carrier protein; CoA, Coenzyme-A; FASI,
  fatty acid synthase type I pathway; FASII, fatty acid synthase type II pathway;
  FAE, fatty acid elongation pathway.'
