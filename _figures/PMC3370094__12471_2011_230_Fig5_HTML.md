caption: Overview of possible disease pathways as discussed and presented in this
  review. Degenerative CAVD and bicuspid CAVD are likely to follow a similar pathway,
  but the higher mechanical stress may induce the process early on. Genetical causes
  for bicuspid CAVD have not yet been identified, but cannot be ruled out yet. Rheumatic
  CAVD is caused by specific bacterial infections, but following healing and scarring
  (dashed/solid arrows), these valves also calcify and interstitial cells have been
  found to undergo osteogenic differentiation. The dashed arrow between matrix remodelling
  and calcification shows that this process may occur, but for severely stenotic valves,
  the path through osteogenic differentiation is probably more likely. The suggested
  therapies so far have not been successful in stopping progression of CAVD. Statins
  and inhibitors of ACE-related processes have been suggested to be primarily involved
  in prevention of onset of CAVD, while bisphosphonates were reported to be beneficial
  at later stages of the disease. For all therapies, both successful and unsuccessful
  results on progression of CAVD have been reported. Better matching of different
  stages of CAVD with specific applied therapies may shift the balance towards more
  effective treatment
