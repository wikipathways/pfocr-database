caption: Scheme for the STATc activation pathways. STATc activation scheme that involves
  coordinated stress regulation over the phosphatase (PTP3) and the kinase arms (two
  TKLs; Pyk2 and Pyk3). The calcium/second messenger pathway and the serine/threonine
  group TKL kinase, Phg2, are involved in PTP3 regulation. The hyperosmotic stress-induced
  intracellular cGMP increase and the cGMP-binding protein, GbpC, are suggested to
  affect Pyk2 and Pyk3 activities in the STATc stress response.
