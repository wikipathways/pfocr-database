caption: MAPK/ERK signaling pathway mutations in odontogenic tumors. BRAF p.V600E
  is the most common mutation in ameloblastomas, followed by KRAS (mostly p.G12R),
  NRAS, HRAS, and FGFR2 mutations reported in a few BRAF wild-type cases. Additionally,
  an EGFR mutation has also been reported in one ameloblastoma case. These less commonly
  reported mutations in ameloblastomas are indicated with an asterisk (*). Ameloblastic
  fibromas, ameloblastic fibrodentinomas, ameloblastic fibro-odontomas, ameloblastic
  fibrosarcoma, ameloblastic carcinomas, and clear cell odontogenic carcinoma (a single
  case) also carry BRAF p.V600E mutation. An NRAS mutation has also been reported
  in one case of ameloblastic fibrosarcoma in a mutually exclusive manner with BRAF
  p.V600E. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are characterized by frequent KRAS codon
  12 (either p.G12V or p.G12R, and in a single case p.G12D) driver mutations, which
  occur in approximately 70% of cases. Detailed information on the studies reporting
  these mutations is shown in .
