caption: Neurotrophic-tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) receptor signaling
  pathway and inhibitors. The ligands nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and NT-4 bind to their receptors, namely NTRK1
  (tropomyosin receptor kinase A or TrkA), NTRK2 (tropomyosin receptor kinase B or
  TrkB), and NTRK3 (tropomyosin receptor kinase C or TrkC). These receptors are under
  the regulation of the co-receptor p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). The binding
  of the ligand to the receptor promotes to the dimerization of the receptor and its
  subsequent intracellular phosphorylation. Several signaling cascades are further
  activated—phospholipase Cγ (PLC-γ), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and
  phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) —and are converging to protumorigenic cell processes,
  such as proliferation, survival invasion, or differentiation. The hyperactivation
  of the NTRK signaling pathway induced by NTRK alterations—fusions or point mutations—can
  be overcome by the use of NTRK antagonists (eg, ANA-12 and cyclotraxin B) or small-molecule
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, larotrectinib and entrectinib). For now, only small-molecule
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used in the clinic.
