caption: 'When the p38/MK2 pathway is not activated by stress or KapB expression (cell
  on the left), MK2 remains in the nucleus, hsp27 remains bound to actin filaments,
  p115RhoGEF is found in a cytosolic oligomer-induced inhibitory state, and RhoA is
  not active. In this case, the actin cytoskeleton is unchanged, p-bodies are not
  dispersed and ARE-containing RNAs remain unstable. When KapB is expressed (cell
  on the right), it mimics the stress-induced activation of the p38/MK2 pathway, binds
  to MK2 and stimulates its kinase activity, resulting in hsp27 phosphorylation and
  the stimulation of p115RhoGEF activity, leading to RhoA activation. The consequences
  of the dual stimulation of RhoA and MK2 by KapB are as follows: 1. RhoA and ROCK-dependent
  formation of actin stress fibers, and migratory and angiogenic phenotype and 2.
  RhoA-dependent but ROCK-independent dispersal of PBs that correlates with the increased
  stability of ARE-containing mRNAs and the translation of their encoded proinflammatory
  and angiogenic protein products.'
