caption: CsA can influence cell survival through calcineurin-dependent and calcineurin-independent
  pathways. CsA and FK506 are calcineurin blockers, but they bind different cytosolic
  proteins called cyclophilin and FKBP, respectively. Calcineurin inhibition can prevent
  cell death through a BAD and/or NOS pathway. First, dephosphorylated BAD protein
  is pro-apoptotic and initiates apoptosis. It binds and blocks anti-apoptotic proteins
  (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and prevents them from stopping apoptosis. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins
  inhibit cytochrome c release through the mitochondrial pore and therefore inhibit
  the activation of the cytoplasmic caspase cascade caused by cytochrome c release.
  Alternatively, dephosphorylated nNOS produces nitric oxide. Nitric oxide can interact
  with superoxide anion to form peroxynitrate, which interacts with either DNA or
  proteins via oxidative reactions that can trigger oxidative injury and necrosis
  or apoptosis. CsA can also influence cell survival through a calcineurin-independent
  pathway. MPTP is a protein pore formed in the inner membrane of the mitochondria
  that can lead to mitochondrial swelling and cell death through apoptosis or necrosis.
  The pore is formed by ANT, PiC, VDAC and CyP D. The pore opening raises the permeability
  of the mitochondrial inner membrane and allows influx of cytosolic molecules into
  the mitochondrial matrix, increases matrix volume, disrupts membrane potential and
  ATP synthesis and causes loss of cytochrome C, a component of the electron transport
  chain. CyP D regulates pore opening and CsA binds and inhibits CyP D. NIM811 blocks
  CyP D without affecting calcineurin. ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase; BAD, Bcl-2-associated
  death promotor; Bcl-xL, B-cell lymphoma-extra large; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma 2; CyP
  A, cyclophilin A; CyP D, cyclophilin D; MPTP, mitochondrial permeability transition;
  VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel.
