caption: The mechanism by which TGF-β controls fibroblast activity in asthma through
  SMAD2/3→C/EBPβ→PRMT1→PGC-1α signaling. In human lung fibroblasts, TGF-β stimulation
  activates SMAD2/3 signaling, which induces the expression of C/EBPβ. C/EBPβ is essential
  for PRMT1 upregulation, which orchestrates PGC-1α, mitochondria mass, and fibroblast
  proliferation. Therefore, PRMT1 and C/EBPβ may play a crucial role in fibrotic processes
  and present a novel therapeutic target in chronic inflammatory pulmonary diseases.
