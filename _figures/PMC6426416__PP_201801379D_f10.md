caption: 'Model of ER stress-dependent autophagy activation in Pi-deprived root tips.
  Pi deprivation causes cell type-specific Fe accumulation in the apoplast of root
  tips, which triggers ROS formation. There is deposition of callose and pectin polymers
  in cell walls, followed by the inhibition of cell-to-cell communication and RAM
  maintenance (; ). These processes are governed by the root cell type-specific expression
  domain of LPR1 (), which encodes a cell wall-targeted ferroxidase (). PDR2, the
  ER-resident AtP5A, functions in ER stress response (; ; ) and is thought to restrict
  LPR1 secretion or LPR1 activity in the apoplast (). Thus, the PDR2-LPR1 module links
  local root Pi sensing to ER stress response (or UPR) and associated autophagy stimulation,
  which is augmented by loss of PDR2, but is prevented by loss of LPR1 function. ER
  stress-associated autophagy activation is largely dependent on IRE1b and, to a minor
  extent, on IRE1a, which are both ER stress transducers (; ; ). Phi supplementation
  or Fe omission, as well as chemical (PBA) and molecular (BiP) chaperones, suppress
  autophagy under Pi starvation and restore RAM activity. These data suggest that
  Pi deprivation activates autophagy in root tips as a consequence of Pi sensing and
  inherently associated ER stress (dotted arrows) rather than a means for Pi recycling.
  Unlike ER stress-induced autophagy, activation of autophagy by C, N, or S starvation
  is mediated by a TOR-dependent regulatory pathway (). Experimental ER stress-inducing
  conditions/agents: heat exposure. TM, tunicamycin; DTT, dithiothreitol. Molecular/chemical
  chaperones: BiP, binding protein (overexpression); PBA, 4-phenylbutyrate.'
