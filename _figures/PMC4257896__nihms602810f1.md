caption: sAC converts ATP in cAMP, the ubiquitous second messenger, which is degraded
  by phosphodiesterase (PDE). sAC is activated by Ca2+ (e.g. overexpression of the
  mitochondrial calcium uniporter, MCU) and HCO3− originated from the CO2 derived
  from the krebs cycle spontaneously or by the action of carbonic anhydrase. It was
  proposed that cAMP activates PKA, leading to phosphorylation of the NDUFS4 subunit
  of complex I (CI, green line), thereby regulating CI activity. sAC also induces
  phosphorylation of subunit COXIV-1 of complex IV (blue line), leading to an increase
  in COX activity, membrane potential (Δψ), O2 consumption and ATP production, without
  altering ROS level. It needs to be noted that the evidence that PKA is the sAC effector
  in mitochondria is contradictory and other kinases may be involved. Other OXPHOS
  complexes are phosphorylated, but whether this involves the mitochondrial sAC-signaling
  pathway is still unknown. Furthermore, proteins related to TCA cycle, calcium homeostasis,
  apoptosis, transporters, fatty acid oxidation and β-oxidation are also phosphorylated.
