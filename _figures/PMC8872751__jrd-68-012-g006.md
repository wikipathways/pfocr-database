caption: Hypothetical scheme of the signal pathways mediating TGFB1-induced suppression
  of angiogenesis during follicular-luteal transition in vitro. TGFB1 binds to receptors
  leading to activation of ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and inhibition of
  ErbB signaling pathway. This suppresses the transcription of CLDN1, CDH1 and ESAM
  resulting in disruption of the cell adhesion junction, while increasing the expression
  of SDC1 and COL1A1 that inhibit ECM degradation, and promote the deposition of COL1A1.
  CLDN1, claudin 1; CDH1, E-cadherin; ESAM, endothelial cell-specific adhesion molecule;
  SDC1, syndecan-1; COL1A1, collagen type I alpha 1 chain; ECM, extracellular matrix.
