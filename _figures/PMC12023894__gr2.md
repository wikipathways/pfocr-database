caption: 'The transmission of the non-classical Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. (A)
  Patched 1 (PTCH1)-independent actions, where down-regulated in rhabdomyosarcoma
  LIM protein (DRAL) and tumor-up-regulated CARD-containing antagonist of caspase-nine
  (TUCAN) form a pro-apoptotic complex that activates caspase-9 and caspase-3, thereby
  regulating cell apoptosis and the cell cycle. (B) Smoothened (SMO)-mediated signaling
  that is independent of GLI family zinc finger 1 (GLI1). SMO activates small G proteins
  such as Rac1 and RhoA, influencing cytoskeletal rearrangement and consequently regulating
  cell migration and axon guidance. (C) PTCH1-SMO independent mechanism of GLI1 activation.
  It shows how multiple signaling pathways including epidermal growth factor (EGF)
  , Wnt, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) converge to ultimately activate
  GLI1 and GLI family zinc finger 2 (GLI2) transcription factors. This mechanism involves
  a complex signaling network, including the participation of various molecules such
  as Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), protein kinase B (AKT), β-catenin,
  and suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) proteins, ultimately leading
  to the activation and nuclear translocation of GLI transcription factors. IHH: Indian
