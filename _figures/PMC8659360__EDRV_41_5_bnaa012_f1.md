caption: Progesterone role in reproductive diseases. Progesterone synthesis starts
  with the signal from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland to release FSH and
  LH, which further stimulate ovaries to produce progesterone. Progesterone primarily
  regulates female reproductive function and breast development. Binding of progesterone
  at its receptor differentially affects tissue growth at its various sites of action.
  Progesterone is thought to be stimulatory for uterine fibroid growth, while it is
  protective for endometrial cancer and endometriosis. The effect of progesterone
  on breast cancer is complex and variable. Progesterone plays a role in the growth
  and development of uterine fibroids through stimulation of cell proliferation and
  facilitating extracellular matrix accumulation. This occurs through activation of
  the AKT and TGF-β3 pathways and the effects of their downstream intermediaries.
  Progesterone is thought to negatively impact the development of endometriosis; a
  reduction in P4-regulated genes and PR-B expression in stromal cells has been reported
  in endometriotic lesions. Progesterone is thought to play a protective role in the
  development of some endometrial cancers through downregulation of the TGF-β signaling
  cascades, with the downstream effect inhibiting the growth of endometrial epithelial
  cells and reducing cancer cell viability and invasion. In the breast, the role of
  progesterone is complex and controversial. P4 has been shown to drive proliferation,
  survival, invasion, and angiogenesis of breast cancer cells through the EGF and
  Wnt-1 pathway, as well as various other intermediaries. In contrast, progestin has
  also been shown to induce MKP-1 (MAPK phosphatase 1) expression in a PR-dependent
  fashion as a means of inducing antiproliferative effects.
