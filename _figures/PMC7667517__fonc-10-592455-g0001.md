caption: 'A Summary of the glycogen metabolism axis, including agents that pharmacologically
  modulate the axis. Glucose enters cells via glucose transporters (GLUTs), where
  it is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) by hexokinase (HK), followed
  by a transfer of the phosphate group from carbon 6 to 1 by phosphoglucomutase (PGM)
  to yieldglucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P). The resultant G-1-P is converted to UDP-glucose
  (UDP-G) by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UPP). This is then used by glycogenin
  (GYG; in dimerized form), a specialized primer of glycogen synthesis, to auto-glucosylate
  and extend its chain. After auto-glucosylation, glycogen synthase (GS) elongates
  these initial chains and creates further α-1,4-glycosidic linkages. Branchpoints
  of α-1,6-glycosidic linkages are mediated by the glycogen branching enzyme (GBE).
  GS is heavily regulated allosterically and by a network of kinases. Phosphorylation
  of GS decreases its activity and hence the rate of glycogen synthesis. GS has phosphorylation
  sites for Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3), protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase
  C (PKC), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK), casein kinase 1 (CK1), and casein kinase 2 (CK2). GS is also positively
  regulated: allosterically by glucose-6-phosphate, and via dephosphorylation by protein
  phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 3 (PPP1R3C). Phosphorylation can also mediate
  activity with phosphorylase kinase (PhK) activating the enzyme and driving glycogenolysis.
  A proportion of glycogen is also degraded via the lysosomal autophagy route by the
  enzyme acid maltase (AM). Enzymes of the pathway implicated in tumorigenesis are
  highlighted by black squares, those implicated in tumor suppressive roles (PhK and
  AGL) are italicized. Red boxes indicate means of pharmacologically modulating the
  axis, highlighting glycogen-targeted drugs that have already been used for clear
  cell cancers. Glucose entry and processing can be inhibited by 2-deoxy-D-glucose
  (2DG), 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), and lonidamine. AKT and GSK which inactivate GS by
  phosphorylation can be targeted with GSK3B inhibitors (e.g., AR-A014418 and SB-2216763),
  as well as PI3K (Perifosine), AKT (MK2202) and mTOR (Everolimus) inhibitors. AMPK
  can be activated to promote glycogen synthesis, as has been performed with metformin
  and resveratrol. PYG has been targeted using inhibitors such as CP91149, CP320626,
  and flavoperidol, to prevent glycogen mobilization. Furthermore, the downstream
  effects of AGL on hyaluronic acid synthesis can be disrupted using 4-methylumbelliferone
  (4MU).'
