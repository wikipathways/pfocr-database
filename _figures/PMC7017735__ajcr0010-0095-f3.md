caption: MetaCore pathway analysis of the upregulated genes in ER+ patients from different
  public databases. The 501 significantly expressed genes in ER+ patients and in the
  MCF-7-estradiol group that were identified by the Venn diagram analysis were exported
  to the MetaCore pathway analysis tool to explore potential gene networks and signaling
  pathways impacted by the selected genes. (A) MetaCore pathway analysis indicated
  that the amino acid metabolism-related pathway and (B) the L-arginine pathway were
  significantly associated with ER+ patients and the MCF-7-estradiol group.
