caption: 'Sphingolipid Metabolism. In this simplified schematic overview of the sphingolipid
  pathway, gene names are italicized. The ceramide structure is from www.lipidmaps.org
  (accessed on 28 July 2021). Enzymes shown are either directly involved in hematopoiesis
  and/or lineage differentiation or they regulate a sphingolipid that is being discussed
  in the context of hemopoiesis. The figure was created using BioRender.com (accessed
  on 28 July 2021). PC: phosphatidylcholine; P-Chol: phosphoryl choline; R1: fatty
  acid; SPT: Serine Palmitoyl Transferase; SPTLC: SPT long base chain subunit; ssSPT:
  small subunit of SPT. SPT consists of three enzymatic subunits: SPTLC1, SPTLC2 or
  3, and ssSPTa or b and one of three regulatory subunits ORMDL1-3.'
