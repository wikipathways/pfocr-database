caption: The interaction between the innate immune factors. ① The HIV replication
  cycle. After PRRs recognize and bind to HIV, the viral outer membrane fuses with
  the cell membrane, and the viral RNA enters the cytoplasm. Under the action of reverse
  transcriptase, viral RNA is reverse transcribed to produce RNA-DNA hybrid strands,
  which are subsequently transcribed to produce double-stranded DNA. The viral double-stranded
  DNA integrates into the pre-viral gene of host DNA, which is then latent or transcribed
  into mRNA, and then translated to viral protein and packaged into a complete virus.
  The mature progeny virus is released to produce new HIV by budding. ② MyD88 dependent
  pathway. In ECs/LTNPs, HIV is recognized by TLR7/8 and TLR9, and the activated TLRs
  stimulate the MyD88 signaling pathway, then activate TRAF 6 and recruit NF-κB and
  IRF7, and increase the production of type I interferons, TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6,
  thereby controlling virus replication and delaying disease progression. ③ MyD88-independent
  pathway in ECs or LTNPs. The dsRNA binds TLR3, then stimulates the TRIF signal pathway,
  raises TRAF3/TRAF6, and recruits NF-κB and IRF3 to trigger type I interferons and
  TNF-α. ④ The DNA receptor signaling pathway in ECs/LTNPs. The dsDNA binds cGAS,
  stimulates STING signal pathway, recruits IRF3/TBK1, then activates NF-κB and IRFs,
  and triggers type I interferons, TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 production, thus slowing
  the disease progression. ⑤ The RNA receptors signaling pathways in HIV infection.
  The RIG-1/MDA5 recognizes dsRNA, binds Cardif in the mitochondria, raises IKK, and
  activates NF-κB to trigger type I interferons production. However, the role of RLRs
  signaling pathway in ECs remains unclear.
