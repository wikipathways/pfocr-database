caption: ERR interception of the cell cycle and ERRα/PGC-1 influence on cancer signaling
  pathways. (A) Prominent ERR effects on cell cycle involve accelerated G2 to M (mitosis)
  progression. ERRs dislodge the resting stage (G0) by stimulating the action of positive
  factors, culminating in continued cell-divisions. (B) The ERRα/PGC-1 axis (complex)
  is a prominent suppressor of multiple tumor signaling pathways. PGC-1α and β are
  the vital ERRα co-activators and simultaneously function as converging centres for
  multiple signaling pathways relevant to cancer pathogenesis. Topical research attempts
  have inferred enhanced PGC-1β expression via cMYC induction, simultaneously triggered
  via HER2 activation and insulin like growth factor receptor signaling pathways.
  Likewise, the switching on of the mTOR/YY-1 pathway secondary to phosphoinositide
  3-kinase functional state induces the PGC-1α expression. Other than cMYC induction
  and mTOR/YY-1 pathway activation, hypoxia and nutritive stress also function as
  potential sources of PGC-1α, while saturated fatty acids and cytokines promote PGC-1β
  expression under physiological conditions. The resultant ERRα/PGC-1α/1β complex,
  thereafter, activates the expression of genes corresponding to the TCA cycle, oxidative
  phosphorylation and numerous other metabolic processes. ERRα has also been revealed
  to be implicated in interacting with β-cat/TCF complex and HIF-1, exerting a reciprocal
  modulation on mutual transcriptional activities. Such signaling responses concurrently
  affect metastasis and angiogenesis. ERRα activity is also affected by the suppressed
  phosphorylation in the HER2 signaling pathway. ERR, estrogen related receptor; IGF-1,
