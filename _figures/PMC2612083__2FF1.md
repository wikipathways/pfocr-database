caption: 'Fig. 1: Working model showing potential routes by which stressors and cytokines
  could influence depressive state. Stressors and cytokines may promote several common
  neurochemical changes, and it is suggested that they may act synergistically in
  affecting some neurochemical processes. Moreover, stressors and cytokines may result
  in the sensitization of neurochemical processes, resulting in exaggerated responses
  to subsequent challenges. Both cytokines and stressors, as depicted in the figure,
  increase the release of corticotropin-releasing hormones (CRH) in hypothalamic and
  extrahypothalamic sites, although, in the case of stressors, this outcome may involve
  activation of bombesin-like peptides (neuromedin B and gastrin-releasing peptide).
  In addition to activating hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal function, corticotropin-releasing
  hormones may influence serotonin (5-HT) processes, and γ-aminobutyric acid receptor
  A (GABAA) activity may act as a mediator in this regard. The 5-HT variations (as
  well as those of other amines) may influence depression directly or may do so through
  other processes. In this regard, an alternative, although not necessarily mutually
  exclusive, pathway involves cytokine/stress activation of either nuclear factor-κB
  (NFκB), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases or janus kinase / signal transducer
  and transcription (JAK-STAT) activator pathway signalling. These would influence
  oxidative or apoptotic mechanisms, leading to altered growth factor expression (e.g.,
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF]), again favouring impaired neuroplastic
  processes and culminating in major depression. ACTH = adrenocorticotropic hormone;
  AVP = arginine vasopressin; CORT = cortisol; DA = dopamine; GRP = gastrin-releasing
  peptide; IL = interleukin; NE = norepinephrin; NMB = neuromedin B; TNF = tumour
  necrosis factor. Reprinted from Anisman et al. Neurotransmitter, peptide and cytokine
  processes in relation to depressive disorder: comorbidity between depression and
  neurodegenerative disorders. Prog Neurobiol 2008;85:1-74, with permission from Elsevier.'
