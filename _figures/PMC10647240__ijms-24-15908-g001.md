caption: 'Schematic diagram of the interaction and influence between the immune metabolic
  and parenchymal cells. Innate immunity and adaptive immunity continuously interact
  to produce an immune response that changes the immune microenvironment; meanwhile,
  the release of inflammatory factors, proteases, etc., results in abnormal metabolism
  of parenchymal cells. The glycolysis of glucose in VSMCs becomes the main metabolic
  pathway rather than OXPHOX, known as the Warburg effect. The excessive accumulation
  of FFAs and SFA in the lipid metabolism process of ECs can result in oxidative stress.
  Amino acid products of the TCA cycle are reduced in fibroblasts, whereas HCY accounts
  for major metabolism which can lead to OXPHPX dysfunction. These metabolic abnormalities
  eventually lead to apoptosis, necrosis and phenotypic transformation of parenchymal
  cells. In the process of degrading proteins, ROS and superoxide produced will also
  cause metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, which will cause abnormality and
  heterogeneity of immune cells so that they perpetuate inflammation and damage of
  aortic wall. This vicious cycle will eventually accelerate the process of AD. (NETs:
  neutrophil extracellular traps, ROS: reactive oxygen species, OXPHOX: oxidative
  phosphorylation, USFA: unsaturated fatty acid, FAs: fatty acid, SFA: saturated fatty
  acid, FFAs: free fatty acid, TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle, Hcy: homocysteine, VSMCs:
  vascular smooth muscle cells, ECs: endothelial cells)'
