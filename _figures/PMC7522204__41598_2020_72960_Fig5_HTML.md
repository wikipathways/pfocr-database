caption: In silico analysis indicating an inhibitory effect of Ambrisentan on PAR2
  signaling pathway. We applied QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood
  City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) tool to perform an in silico analysis of the effect
  of ETAR inhibition by Ambrisentan on PAR2 signaling. Molecules in red are predicted
  to be affected by Ambrisentan inhibition. Direct and indirect interactions are shown
  by solid and dashed lines, respectively.
