caption: The inhibition of the NF-κB pathway activation by HIF. Chronic hypoxia is
  associated with NF-κB activation, although there are also mechanisms that silence
  the proinflammatory response, such as an increase in PHD3 expression, which inhibits
  IKK activity. Additionally, there is an HIF-1 induced increase in the expression
  of IκBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB. The simultaneous activation of NF-κB and HIF causes
  these two transcription factors to compete for the coactivator p300.
