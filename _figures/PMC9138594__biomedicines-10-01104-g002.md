caption: HIF2α-ODZ1 gene expression pathway. HIFs are heterodimeric proteins, composed
  of alpha (α) and beta (β) subunits. In normal conditions, HIFα is subjected to ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation. However, under hypoxia, HIF is stabilized and translocated
  to the nucleus. In the nucleus, HIFα (HIF1α, HIF2α, or HIF3α) dimerizes with HIF1β
  and the heterodimer binds to hypoxia-response element (HRE), a specific sequence
  (RCGTG) located within the promoter of target genes, including ODZ1, inducing their
  expression [].
