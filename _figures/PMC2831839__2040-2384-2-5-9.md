caption: Schematic diagram of a proposed mechanism of MNTX synergistic effects with
  temsirolimus on inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenic events. VEGF binding to VEGF
  receptors (1) induces Src activation (tyrosine phosphorylation)(2), Src-mediated
  PI3 kinase/PDK1 activation with consequent phospho-threonine308 Akt phosphorylation
  (3) and mTOR Complex 2 formation (mTOR/SIN1/Rictor) with consequent phospho-serine473
  Akt phosphorylation (4). Activated (serine/threonine phosphorylated) Akt promotes
  mTOR Complex 1 formation (mTOR/FKBP12/Raptor) (5) required for EC proliferation
  and migration (6). MNTX inhibits the mu opioid receptor and promotes tyrosine phosphatase
  activity and Src inactivation (7). Temsirolimus binds to FKBP12 and inhibits mTOR
  Complex 2 formation (8). Therefore, the synergistic effects of MNTX with temsirolimus
  are achieved through inhibition of different components of a common VEGF-induced
  angiogenic signaling pathway. MNTX can have important clinical utility by potentially
  lower the therapeutic dose of temsirolimus in the treatment of various diseases
  requiring angiogenesis including cancer.
