caption: Neutrophil apoptosis. Extrinsic apoptosis as typified by apoptotic pathway
  triggering by TNF-α or Fas ligand (TNF-α depicted). Extrinsic apoptosis proceeds
  via clustering and cleavage of procaspase-8. In neutrophils (and other type II apoptotic
  cells) it is linked to the intrinsic apoptotic (or mitochondrial) death pathway
  by cleavage of the pro-apoptotic bcl-2 homologue Bid. The intrinsic pathway is initiated
  when the tightly regulated balance of bcl-2 homologue proteins tips in favour of
  pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bim, Bad, Bax and Bak. Also shown is the antiapoptotic
  function of TNF-α which mediates production of survival proteins via NF-κB signalling.
  The key anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologue in neutrophils is Mcl-1 which is regulated
  by a number of signalling pathways (created using SABIOscience presentation tools).
