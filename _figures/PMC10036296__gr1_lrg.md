caption: Pathophysiological mechanisms involved in COVID-19 vascular dysfunction and
  coagulopathy. During infection, SARS-CoV-2 gains entry to human cells via interaction
  of its spike protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Downregulation
  of ACE2 activity, related accumulation of angiotensin-II, and upregulation of the
  kallikrein-bradykinin pathway with a marked reduction in pericytes through apoptosis
  of infected cells contribute to the thromboinflammatory process. The diseased endothelium
  harms vascular integrity with consequent vascular leakage and vasoconstriction that
  induce ischemia and apoptosis. This leads to macrophage and complement activation,
  and further leukocyte recruitment. Amplification loops of the inflammatory response
  ensue, with overproduction of cytokines and immune mediators. At the time of endothelial
  injury and the consequent inflammatory response, exposure of a thrombogenic basement
  membrane can trigger coagulation pathways. Activation of the clotting cascade involves
  recruitment of platelets and release of trophic cytokines and procoagulant mediators,
  which are further enhanced by the expression of adhesion proteins (including P-selectin,
  von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen), increase in tissue factor activity, and
  suppression of fibrinolysis and thrombomodulin that ultimately results in thrombosis.
  Elevated inflammatory markers and hematological derangements such as thrombocytopenia
  and high levels of D-dimer and other fibrin breakdown products correlate with greater
  mortality risk and adverse outcomes. CRP, C-reactive protein; DVT, deep vein thrombosis;
  ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; IL, interleukin; MI, myocardial infarction;
  PE, pulmonary embolism; TNF, tumour necrosis factor; VWF, von Willebrand factor.
