caption: Model of H1 involvement in the repression of the interferon response. Histone
  H1 participates in the repression of strongly silenced genes such as ISGs under
  basal conditions, and in the repression of non-coding transcripts derived from repeats
  such as satellites, transposons and endogenous retroviruses located in heterochromatic
  regions which may cause, upon induction in H1-depleted cells, activation of the
  IFN signaling pathway. Transcription of repeats may give raise to ss/dsRNAs (–)
  or non-B DNA structures such as R-loops (), that could be sensed by universal (HMGBs)
  or ligand-specific cytosolic sentinels (DDX60) that activate RNA (MDA5/IFIH1, RIG-I,
  LGP2, OASs) or DNA sensors (cGAS, IFI16), or by membrane-associated Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs). These proteins transduce the signal to specific adaptors (MAVS/IPS1, STING),
  leading to the activation of TBK-IRFs and IKK-NFkB. These transcription factors
  bind specific sites at ISG promoters, including genes for the synthesis of type
  I IFN that upon interaction with specific receptors lead to the activation of JAK-STAT
  pathway and additional IRFs. For simplicity, few of the sensor and adaptor proteins
  are drawn. ISGs up-regulated in multiH1 KD cells include DDX60, MDA5/IFIH1, RIG-I/DDX58,
  LGP2, PKR, OAS1/IFI4, OAS2, OASL, IRF1, IRF7, IRF9, IFNB, STAT1 (in green). HMGB1,
  HMGB2 and HMGB3 are down-regulated. Inhibitors of members of the IFN signaling pathway
  are shown (in red).
