caption: Figure 3. Cdc42, Rac, RhoA and their effector pathways in invadosome formation.
  In most cases, Cdc42, Rac and Rho participate in the construction of invadosomes.
  Cooperative and antagonist crosstalks exist between the pathways and at various
  levels. The contribution of each pathway to the formation of the structure depends
  on the cell type considered. Signaling elements in orange have so far been described
  at invadopodia only.
