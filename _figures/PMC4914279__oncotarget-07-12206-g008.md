caption: Early after infection, TGEV stimulates the phosphorylation of cofilin and
  the polymerization of F-actin through the EGFR-PI3K-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK signaling
  pathway. EGFR is another receptor for TGEV invasion, and is involved in the regulation
  of actin dynamics and TGEV invasion. Lipid rafts are clustered and act as signaling
  platforms for EGFR-mediated signaling.
