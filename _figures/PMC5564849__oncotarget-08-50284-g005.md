caption: Cellular molecules are represented as nodes and the biological relationship
  between two nodes is represented as a line. The intensity of the node color indicates
  the degree of up-(red) or down-(green) regulation. Solid lines show direct, dotted
  lines and indirect actions. Gray lines show actions within one network, purple lines
  show actions between different networks. The networks of neoambrosin and damsin
  involved RNA post-transcriptional modification, cellular assembly and organization,
  cellular function and maintenance, cell cycle, molecular transport, RNA trafficking,
  DNA replication recombination and repair, cellular growth and proliferation, as
  well as cell death and survival. In addition, the affected pathways for neoambrosin
  were NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, EIF2 signaling, cell cycle control
  of chromosomal replication and protein ubiquitination pathway, whereas for damsin
  NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, EIF2 signaling ephrin receptor signaling,
  role of JAK2 in hormone-like cytokine signaling, JAK/Stat signaling were the top
  affected pathways.
