caption: The mechanisms of accelerated aging triggering PD. The red genes are PD biomarkers,
  the green genes are aging biomarkers, the orange gene is the most important network
  node, and the blue genes are the top significant network nodes with the top highest
  betweenness. The blue arrows represent the links with PPAR signaling pathway, the
  black arrows represent the links with energy metabolism, the red arrows represent
  the links with ion imbalance, the green arrows represent the links with cell apoptosis,
  and the orange arrows represent the links with immune responses
