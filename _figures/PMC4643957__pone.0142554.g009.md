caption: 'A hypothetical model is presented to elucidate major signaling pathways
  that are associated with glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) and glycogen synthesis.
  (A) In this model, glucose transporter-mediated uptake of glucose is activated by
  an insulin-receptor signaling pathway. (B) Glucose takes part in aerobic glycolysis
  in the cytoplasm and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria to produce energy
  for hESC proliferation and self-renewal. Presumably, excessive glucose is converted
  to glycogen by activated glycogen synthase (GSa) upon stress and differentiation
  signaling to enhance hPSC survival. Glycogen can be decomposed in the presence of
  phosphorylated glycogen phorsphoylase (pGP) whenever necessary. (C) The insulin
  signaling pathway also activates the PI3K-AKT pathway, which phosphorylates GSK-3.
  The GSK-3 phosphorylation leads to its inactivation and subsequently inhibits the
  phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (GS). Thus, activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway
  increases glycogen synthesis. (D) The mechanism of BMP-4-induced glycogen body formation
  is likely through the inhibition of GSK-3 by the putative Smad pathways. (E) The
  mechanism by which the GSK3i CHIR modulates the synthesis of glycogen is likely
  through the inhibition of GSK-3 activity, thereby altering glycogen synthase activity.
  (F) Concomitantly, GSK-3 inhibitors (e.g., CHIR99021 and BIO) may promote hPSC differentiation
  by activation of the β-catenin-WNT pathway. (G) The function of aggregated glycogen
  bodies is unclear and may be associated with response to extracellular stress and
  differentiation signals such as BMP-4. (H) Under sustained Oct-4 expression conditions,
  GSK3i-mediated glycogen accumulation concomitant with Wnt activation and other naïve
  growth components enhances the transition from the primed pluripotent to the naïve
  state in hPSCs. The proposed mechanisms in this model supported by this study are
  color-highlighted. The “?” symbols indicate inconclusive observations. The abbreviations
  are: 2iL, the naïve pluripotent growth condition that include GSK3i, MEKi, and LIF;
  3iL, the naïve pluripotent growth condition that include GSK3i, MEKi, BMP4i, and
  LIF; AKT, the serine-threonine protein kinase encoded by v-akt murine thymoma viral
  oncogene homolog; CHIR, CHIR99021; GPi, dephosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase
  (inactive form); GSa, dephosphorylated glycogen synthase (active form); GSK-3, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3; pGPa, phosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase (active form); pGSi,
  phosphorylated glycogen synthase (inactive form); PI3K, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  and β-cat, β-catenin.'
