caption: Pathogenetic mechanisms of cancer-related anemia and main related targeted
  approaches. The pathogenesis of cancer-related anemia involves multiple mechanisms
  induced by chronic inflammation associated to cancer and leading to functional iron
  deficiency and impaired erythropoiesis. Then, a multitargeted approach including
  conventional treatment such as ESAs, blood transfusion, iron therapy, as well as
  drugs targeting the inflammatory pathway, modulators of the iron metabolism, hepcidin
  antagonists, novel regulators of erythropoiesis and nutritional support should be
  considered. Figure was created in BioRender.com.
