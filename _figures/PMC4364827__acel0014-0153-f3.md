caption: Activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) after DNA double-strand breaks
  (DSB) induction in young and old cells. The signaling pathway starts with the MRN
  complex recruitment and continues with ATM phosphorylating H2AX. As represented
  here, the heterodimer Ku70/80 can also interact directly with the DSB and promote H2AX
  phosphorylation in DSB-flanking chromatin. The modified histone form (γH2AX) triggers
  MDC1 and 53BP1 assembly to the DSB and subsequent binding of ubiquitin ligase RNF8
  and other chromatin remodeling factors. Proteins from both the nonhomologous end
  joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways are also recruited at
  the sites of damage to repair the DSB. Aging cells show a decline in the DDR efficiency
  at different points of this response. These points are represented by numbers (1–4)
  in the scheme.
