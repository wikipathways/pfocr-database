caption: Phytosaponins stimulate the glucocorticoid receptor and activate the hippo-YAP/TAZ
  signaling pathway, leading to the recruitment of MDSCs as well as promoting their
  proliferation and differentiation into M-MDSCs, during which a series of cytokines
  are produced to regulate the immune response of the body. (The figure was created
