caption: Schematic representation of PI3K-AKT pathway and associated cellular activities.
  PDK2 is shown as mTORC2. Continuous lines represent direct AKT phosphorylation,
  leading to activation (arrow end) or inhibition (blunt end). PI3K kinase consists
  of p110 catalytic and p85 regulatory subunits. PI3K is activated by receptor tyrosine
  kinases. Once, activated PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 helps to recruit PH domain
  binding protein like Akt to cell membrane and thus activates Akt. The recruitment
  of Akt to cell membrane leads to the conformational changes in Akt and helps PDK1
  for phosphorylation at Thr308 residue. The complete activation of Akt requires phosphorylation
  of AKT at the hydrophobic C-terminal domain Ser473 residue. This phosphorylated
  AKT regulates apoptosis and various cellular activities by phosphorylating various
  downstream substrates.
