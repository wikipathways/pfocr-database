caption: The terpene synthesis pathway. Terpenes are synthesized via the MEP pathway
  in prokaryotes and via the MVA pathway in eukaryotes such as yeast. Both of these
  synthesis pathways occur in plants. HDR, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate
  reductase; HDS, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate synthase; MDS, 2C-methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate
  synthase; CMK, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase; MCT, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-d-erythritol
  cytidylyltransferase; DXR, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase; DXS,
  1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; Erg10, acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase;
