caption: PLC signaling in B cells. The principal isoforms of PLC-β in hematopoietic
  cells are PLC-β2 and PLC-β3. They can be activated by βγ-dimers or Gα subunits of
  the Gq family of heterotrimeric G proteins that are coupled to seven transmembrane
  receptors. PLC-βs can be inhibited by PKA, and expression of PLC-β2 can be downregulated
  by LPS (this report), which signals through TLR4. PLC converts PIP2 to DAG and IP3.
  IP3 binding to the IP3R on the ER leads to a rise in cytoplasmic calcium by the
  release of calcium from ER stores and, indirectly, by opening store-operated plasma
  membrane calcium channels, the major ones being CRAC. DAG and IP3 can also be produced
  by PLC-γ2, activated primarily through signals from the BCR. There is an alternate
  calcium release pathway from BCR through cADPR to RYR3 in the ER. There is a possible
  cross-talk pathway from G protein through PI3Kγ, PIP3 and Bruton's tyrosine kinase
  to activate PLC-γ2, but we found that inhibiting PI3K with wortmannin or Ly294002
  had no effect on chemokine-induced calcium flux (see text). DAG, together with calcium,
  can bind to the GEF CalDAG-GEFI, leading to integrin activation. DAG can also enhance
  integrin avidity for adhesion proteins through a PKC-dependent pathway. Calcium
  has roles in uropod release at the back of migrating cells by contributing to the
  activation of myosin II and the activity of synaptotagmins, which are important
  for lysosome fusion. Arrows show positive effects. Solid lines ending in bars show
  inhibitory effects. Pharmacological inhibitors used in this study are shown in brackets.
  Downregulation of PLC-β2 demonstrated in this study is shown using the dashed line.
