caption: 'Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways in cardiac hypertrophy. Upon activation
  by CaM, CaN dephosphorylates cytoplasmic NFAT, a known hypertrophic transcription
  factor, and promotes its translocation to the nucleus and subsequent transcriptional
  activity. After silencing CaMKII, protein expression in the CaMKII and CaN-NFAT
  signaling pathways was inhibited, and the nuclear transfer of NFATc4 was decreased.
  CsA, an inhibitor of CaN, inhibits the expression in the CaN-NFAT pathway but activates
  the CaMKII signaling pathway, MyD88 inflammatory pathway, and ICa-L. WXKL improves
  CH through the CaMKII and CaN-NFAT signaling pathways. CaM: calmodulin; CaN: calcineurin;
  NFAT: nuclear factor of activated T cells; CaMKII: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase II; L-type Ca2+ current: ICa-L; CsA: cyclosporine A; WXKL: Wenxin Keli; CH:
  cardiac hypertrophy.'
