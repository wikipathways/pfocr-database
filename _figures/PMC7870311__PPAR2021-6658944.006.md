caption: Possible mechanisms of fenofibrate during hepatic IR injury. In our IR-induced
  liver injury model, activated Kupffer cells promoted the release of proinflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and production of ROS. Fenofibrate can
  activate PPAR-α via phosphorylating AMPK, collaboratively regulating inflammation
  response, apoptosis, and autophagy downstream. Furthermore, AMPK activation increased
  accumulation of Nrf-2 to reduce ROS generation. FF shows hepatoprotective effects
  against IR injury by inhibiting inflammation and attenuating apoptosis and autophagy
  through the AMPK/PPAR-α pathway.
