caption: Comparison of ATR activation and signaling pathway in interphase and in mitosis.
  As described extensively in the previous section, ATR is primarily activated through
  the creation of single-stranded DNA breaks (SSBs) or stalled replication forks during
  interphase, which act as recruitment sites for ATRIP, an essential ATR binding partner.
  Once ATR is recruited to these sites, additional factors, including the 9-1-1 complex,
  TopBP1, and ETAA1, are able to fully activate ATR and the downstream signaling cascade,
  mainly through Chk1. The primary role of active Chk1 in this context is to arrest
  the cell cycle until the damaged DNA is repaired or to promote apoptosis if the
  degree of DNA damage is beyond repair. In contrast, ATR in mitosis is primarily
  recruited to the centromeres through centromeric R-loops, which are likely formed
  by transcription of the centromeric regions. Once activated, ATR activates Chk1
  as it does during interphase. However, active Chk1 in mitosis primarily phosphorylates
  and activates Aurora kinase B and also promotes recruitment of essential spindle
  assembly checkpoint (SAC) components to the kinetochore to promote faithful chromosome
  segregation
