caption: 'Metabolic pathway diagram of mannitol-producing strains and schematic diagram
  of strain construction process. (A) Schematic metabolic network of the engineered
  mannitol biosynthetic pathway in PCC 7942. Black lines represent reactions catalyzed
  by endogenous Synechococcus enzymes; whereas, the metabolic pathways marked in red
  are newly introduced pathway. Abbreviations: CBB cycle, Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle;
  F-1,6-P, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; UDP-Glc, UDP-glucose;
  G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; G-1-P, glucose-1-phosphate; Sps, sucrose-phosphate synthase;
  Spp, sucrose-6-phosphatase; Mtld, mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase; M1Pase, mannitol-1-phosphatase.
  The two-step conversion process initiated with the catalysis of mannitol-1-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (Mtld) converting fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) into mannitol-1-phosphate
  (M1P), followed by the hydrolysis of M1P into mannitol by mannitol-1-phosphatase
  (M1Pase). (B) The attempts to construct mannitol-producing strains. See Results
  Section for descriptions of specific strategies'
