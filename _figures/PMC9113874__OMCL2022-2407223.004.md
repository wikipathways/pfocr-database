caption: HIF-1α regulates metabolic reprogramming of hypoxic cells. Pictorial representation
  of glucose metabolism in hypoxic cells. (1) HIF-1α shows the mechanism of transcriptional
  activation under hypoxic conditions in which the degradation mechanism of HIF-1α
  is hindered by inactivation of oxygen-sensing enzymes (PHD-2 and FIH-1) at low oxygen
  tension, which leads to stabilization and transactivation of HIF-1α-mediated phenotypic
  expression of several enzymes involved in glycolysis. Hypoxic cells perform catabolism
  and anabolism with respect to HIF-1α activity. (2) The pentose phosphate pathway
  is an anabolic process for cancer cell survival and development. Conversion of glucose
  6-phosphate to ribose 5-phosphate and NADPH in the presence of the G6-PDH enzyme
  involved in the biosynthesis (fatty acid synthesis and de novo synthesis) and antioxidant
  systems. It helps in building blocks and prevents oxidative stress in newly divided
  and proliferated cells. (3) Glucose is catabolized by a series of upregulated glycolytic
  enzymes, mainly HK-2, PFK-L, PKM2, and LDHA, which participate in the conversion
  of glucose into lactate and energy production in the form of ATP. (4) Mitochondrial
  bypass of pyruvate promoted the Warburg effect in hypoxic cells and expressed PDK,
  which inhibits pyruvate conversion to acetyl-CoA and avoids oxidative phosphorylation,
  which gives energy to normal cells. (5) MCT-4 is a membrane transporter that is
  strongly expressed in hypoxic cells and is involved in the efflux mechanism of glycolysis
  end products, lactate and H+, to avoid intracellular acidosis by effluxing lactate
  and H+ from the intracellular region to the extracellular matrix and subsequently
  promotes glycolysis for energy fulfillment.
