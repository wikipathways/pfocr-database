caption: Pathway model of the C. elegans Gαspathway. Shown are the C. elegans orthologs
  of the canonical Gαspathway that are relevant to this study, arranged as originally
  defined by vertebrate biochemical studies, which is consistent with this study and
  previous C. elegans genetic studies (; ). According to the model, GSA-1 (Gαs)'s
  action is mediated, in whole or part, by its major effector molecule ACY-1. ACY-1
  produces the small signaling molecule cAMP. The binding of cAMP to KIN-2 (a PKA
  regulatory subunit) leads to its dissociation from the inactive holoenzyme and the
  release of active KIN-1 (a PKA catalytic subunit). Other potential effectors of
  cAMP are not shown. cAMP action is terminated by one or more cAMP phosphodiesterases
  (not identified). Activating green proteins or reducing the function of red proteins
  suppresses ric-8(md303). For each component, the number of alleles that this study
  identified is indicated, along with allele type (dominant or recessive).
