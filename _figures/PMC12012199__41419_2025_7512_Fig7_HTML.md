caption: As in our previous research, EphA7 was significantly hypermethylated in CC
  tissues, and the CRISPR-dCas9-Tet1 system was used to reduce the promoter methylation
  of EphA7 by reactivating its expression, which provided strong evidence that promoter
  methylation of EphA7 is inversely correlated with gene expression in CC. In this
  study, we found that the promoter demethylation of EphA7 via the CRISPR-dCas9-Tet1
  system inhibited proliferation, migration and EMT, and induced apoptosis through
  the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, we found that E2 could impair SP1, reduce
  the methylation of EphA7, and reverse the expression of EphA7 by reducing the expression
  of DNMT1 via the SP1/ER axis. Furthermore, the chemosensitivity of CaSki and SiHa
  cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel was effectively improved with the demethylation
  of EphA7, and the demethylation of EphA7 was associated with a favorable response
  to therapy and a favorable prognosis for CC patients. In addition, pooled analysis
  indicated that EphA7 hypermethylation was positively correlated with tumor purity
  but negatively correlated with immune infiltration, CTLs and IC activity, and the
  expression of EphA7 was significantly positively correlated with TMB, MSI, and SNV
  neoantigens, suggesting a better prognosis with EphA7 demethylation/high expression.
  Overall, specific demethylation of the EphA7 promoter and restoration of endogenous
  EphA7 expression by dCas9-Tet1 hold promising therapeutic applications and offer
  a favorable prognosis for CC
