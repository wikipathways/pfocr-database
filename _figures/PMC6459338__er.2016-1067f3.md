caption: The classical and “back-door” pathways of androgen biosynthesis. In the classical
  pathway (solid gray arrow), C21 precursors (pregnenolone and progesterone) are converted
  to the C19 adrenal androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione by
  the sequential hydroxylase and lyase activities of CYP17A1. Circulating adrenal
  androgens [including dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S)] enter the prostate
  and can be converted to T by a series of reactions involving the activity of HSD3B,
  HSD17B, and aldo/keto reductase (AKR1C) enzymes. T is then converted to the potent
  androgen DHT by the activity of SRD5A. In the back-door pathway to DHT synthesis
  (short gray arrows), C21 precursors are first acted upon by SRD5A and the reductive
  3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) activity of AKR1C family members, followed
  by conversion to C19 androgens via the lyase activity of steroid 17α-monooxygenase
  (CYP17A) and subsequently to DHT by the action of HSD17B3 and an oxidative 3α-HSD
  enzyme. Redrawn from Mostaghel and Nelson ().
