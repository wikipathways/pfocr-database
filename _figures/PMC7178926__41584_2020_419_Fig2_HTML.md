caption: IL-6 participates in a broad spectrum of biological events, such as synovial
  inflammation, immune responses, haematopoiesis and acute-phase reactions. a | IL-6
  binds to IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and glycoprotein 130 (gp130) to form a hexameric
  complex. Both membrane-bound IL-6R and soluble IL-6R can be part of the hexameric
  complex and are associated with the classical signalling and trans-signalling pathways,
  respectively. Intracellular signalling pathways involve the Janus kinase (JAK) and
  signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Pharmacological
  inhibitors of IL-6 signalling prevent IL-6 from binding to IL-6R by targeting either
  the cytokine itself or the receptor. b | In the context of disease, IL-6 can have
  both local inflammatory and systemic effects. Some of the manifestations of the
  diseases for which IL-6 inhibitors are approved could be explained by the effects
  of IL-6, on the basis of both preclinical and clinical data. IL-6 has been implicated
  in the pathogenesis of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile
  idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), Castleman disease, giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis
  and cytokine release syndrome, among others. c | As IL-6 has multiple roles in the
  dysfunction of the immune and inflammatory systems, anti-IL-6R therapy could relieve
  various symptoms such as fever, fatigue, pain, joint destruction, anaemia and others.
