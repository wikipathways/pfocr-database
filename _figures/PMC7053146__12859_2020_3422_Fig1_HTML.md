caption: The modified branched pathway model used in this work, adapted from Voit
  and Almeida []. Black arrows indicate fluxes. The green and red arrows denote positive
  and negative regulatory interactions, respectively. The dashed line denotes the
  system boundary. Metabolites are X1, X2, X3, X4, and XBM. System fluxes are v1,
  v2, v3, v4, and v5. Pooling fluxes for X1, X2, X3, X4, and XBM are v6, v7, v8, v9,
  and vBM, respectively. The parameters in blue specify reaction rates and stoichiometry,
  such that bm3X3 + bm4X4 → XBM. Not shown are initial conditions. Kinetic rate laws
  are implemented as generalized mass action (GMA) rate laws from BST
