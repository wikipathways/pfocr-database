caption: a) The biosynthetic pathway for LM and LAM results in three primary products,
  PIMs, LM and LAM. The degree of acylation for each product can vary, as can secondary
  modifications on LM and LAM. An unknown process drives expression of AM and M on
  the surface of the bacteria as part of their capsule. A simplified structure of
  LM/LAM is presented for clarity. Grey text indicates glycolipid species. b) Ribbon
  diagram of Aman6 (PDB:5AGD; grey) in complex with ɑ-1,6 mannotetraose aligned in
  ccp4i Superpose with the AlphaFold 2.0 predicted structure for LamH (Rv0365c) associated
  with its Uniprot entry (O06315; blue). c) The confirmed catalytic residues in Aman6
  (D124/D125; D125N mutant in 5AGD; grey) are conserved in LamH (D96/D97; blue). d)
  Phylogenetic tree of GH76 enzymes from the Mycobacteriales. Genomes for all available
  members of the Mycobacteriales were used to generate a custom BLAST database in
  Geneious Prime 2023.1.1. LamH was used as a query in a BLAST search of this database,
  yielding high-confidence homologs from all species. This list of proteins was submitted
  to NGPhylogeny.fr using the PHYML/OneClick tool, the tree was then manually coloured
  to identify individual genera.
