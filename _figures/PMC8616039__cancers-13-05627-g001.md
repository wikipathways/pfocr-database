caption: Mechanisms of peripheral T-cell lymphoma development and agents used for
  targeted therapies. Multiple mechanisms are responsible for the development and
  proliferation of different subtypes of PTCL, including signaling pathway deregulation,
  epigenetic dysregulation, tumor microenvironment signals, and virus-mediated oncogenesis.
  Not all of these mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of each PTCL subtype.
  Some potential therapeutic targets and agents targeting them are also shown.
