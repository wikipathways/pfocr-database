caption: Schematic synthesis of data and hypothesis. Organoids from nonadenomatous
  (NA) and adenomatous (A) biopsies displayed different phenotypes during investigations,
  summarized as delayed maturation in intestinal primitive cells from NA and overactive
  proliferation and migration in A organoids. Delayed maturation in intestinal primitive
  cells from NA seems to impact secretory differentiation (ATOH1 pathway) and may
  be linked to APC and LGR4 dysfunctions as well as to p110α activation. In the proliferation
  and migration of intestinal primitive cells from A, in addition to APC dysfunction,
  EGFR, and TGF‐β (TGF‐β), but probably also LGR5‐ and Wnt‐dependent pathways, play
  a critical role by regulating p110β, β‐catenin, and YAP. Notably, both NA and A
  areas differ in their survival pathways. APC*, mutant APC. Figure created with BioRender.com
