caption: Roles of miR-33a and its target genes in prostate (top) and breast cancer
  (bottom), and the underlying mechanisms. (A) miR-33a downregulation upregulates
  its target gene PIM1, as well as CPT1A and HADHB, which promote β-oxidation pathway
  and proliferation. (B) miR-33a upregulation downregulates EN-2, inhibiting proliferation,
  migration and invasion. (C) miR-33a upregulation inhibits its target gene TGFBRI,
  which further downregulates ZEB1, downregulating vimentin and upregulating fibronectin,
  leading to inhibition of EMT, metastasis, invasion and migration. (D) miR-33a upregulation
  downregulates its target genes ROS1 and ADAM9, inhibiting proliferation and migration.
  (E) miR-33a upregulation downregulates its target gene ABCA1, inhibiting radiosensitivity.
  (F) miR-33a upregulation downregulates its target gene EZH2, inhibiting proliferation
  and migration. (G) miR-33a upregulation inhibits its target gene eIF5A2, downregulating
  vimentin and upregulating E-cadherin, leading to inhibition of EMT and chemoresistance.
  Blue represents miR-33a; yellow represents the target genes of miR-33a; orange represents
  the downstream proteins; light green represents the signaling pathways and EMT processes;
  dark green represents the biological processes of cancer cells. miR, microRNA; EMT,
  epithelial-mesenchymal transition; PIM1, Pim-1 proto-oncogene; EN-2, engrailed homeobox
  2; TFGBRI, transforming growth factor β receptor 1; ZEB1, Zinc finger E-Box binding
  homeobox 1; ADAM9, ADAM metallopeptidase domain 9; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter
  A1; EZH2, enhancer of zeste homolog 2; eIF5A2, eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 5A2; CPT1A, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A; HADHB, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
