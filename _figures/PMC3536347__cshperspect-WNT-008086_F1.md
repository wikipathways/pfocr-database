caption: Pharmacologic inhibitors of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and known
  interactions with pathway components (see  for references). This figure depicts
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in its active state, with cytoplasmic accumulation and
  nuclear translocation of β-catenin, along with the transactivation of target genes
  in the nucleus mediated by interaction between β-catenin and members of the TCF
  family of transcription factors. Note that in contexts in which downstream mutations
  in APC or β-catenin result in constitutive pathway activation, the use of upstream
  inhibitors that target ligand secretion, ligand binding, and even the APC-AXIN-GSK3β
  complex may not be sufficient to inhibit signaling. Also, targeting of β-catenin
  interactors can involve either the disruption of protein interactions or the direct
  inhibition of transcriptional activity (see also  for additional details and references).
