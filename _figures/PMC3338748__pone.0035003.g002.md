caption: (A) The flow diagram depicts the experimental strategy for SNV discovery
  and confirmation. For the AGRE and control cohorts, orthogonal multiplexing was
  performed to prepare two distinct sets of sample pools (15 pools of 20 samples each,
  or 20 pools of 15 samples each). Following enrichment of exonic target regions for
  all 18 mGluR pathway genes, SNVs were identified and confirmed by deep resequencing
  of orthogonal pools on two independent NGS platforms (Illumina GAII and the Helicos
  HeliScope). SNVs concordantly detected on both platforms were then analyzed as shown
  in panel B. (B) The flow diagram depicts the procedure used to classify the presumptive
  functional effects of identified variants. SNVs concordantly detected on both NGS
  platforms were classified as common or rare using a minor allele frequency (maf)
  threshold of 1%. Common SNVs, rare SNVs occurring in both autism and control populations,
  and rare synonymous (silent) SNVs were considered likely to be benign. Rare SNVs
  in intronic sequences flanking exons that did not affect conserved splice donor
  or acceptor sites or in 5′ untranslated regions were classified as not benign but
  of unknown significance. Rare SNVs causing missense substitutions or occurring in
  mRNA 3′ untranslated regions (and therefore possibly affecting mRNA stability or
  translation , ) were considered possibly deleterious, and rare SNVs causing nonsense
  mutations or affecting conserved splice donor or acceptor sequences were considered
  probably deleterious. These latter two categories of SNVs were together considered
  potentially deleterious.
