caption: Proposed model for MOAS and complement signaling with microglia. A consequence
  and subsequent driver of the exacerbated cAMP-PKA signaling is high levels of cytosolic
  Ca2+ within the dendritic spine. Calcium levels rise through multiple sources, including
  the calcium conductance of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDAR) channels (specifically
  composed of NR2B subunits) as well as release from internal storage within the smooth
  endoplasmic reticulum (SER), called the spine apparatus once it extends into the
  spine. Calcium leaves the SER through calcium channels, specifically IP3R and RyR.
  Mitochondria have the ability to modulate calcium overload in the dendritic spine.
  Calcium regulation can be achieved through mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ as well
  as direct calcium exchange through mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs) which
  are regions that connect the SER and the mitochondria. We hypothesize that as mitochondria
  become calcium overloaded, this leads to mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g. interruption
  to fission), resulting in a phenotype called “Mitochondria on a string” (MOAS).
  Within the dendritic shafts of glutamatergic-like pyramidal neurons of layer III
  of the dlPFC of aged rhesus macaques, we have observed MOAS with pinched “string”
  regions next to calcium-containing SER. We further propose that MOAS can generate
  inflammatory signaling molecules, e.g. C1q, that can recruit nearby microglia to
  phagocytose the ailing spine. It is known that dysfunctional mitochondria can result
  in elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and generation of inflammatory
  molecules, such as complement proteins. C1q is a component of the classical pathway
  of complement signaling. It initiates activation of downstream complement proteins,
  which can signal to microglia through their receptors. Microglia are equipped with
  complement receptors (CR1, C1qRp, CR3, CD93, MEGF10), which can recognize complement
  proteins and initiate phagocytosis of these spines. Consistent with this hypothesis,
  we have seen the presence of C1q in the aged macaque dlPFC in three separate neuronal
  compartments (spine head, presynaptic axon terminus, and in the dendritic shaft
  next to dysmorphic mitochondria-on-a-string “MOAS”). It is important to note that
  while this model focuses on complement as a downstream signaling molecule to local
  glia, there are other potential downstream signaling molecules, e.g. phosphatidylserine,
  caspase 3, that can also lead to pruning by glia.
