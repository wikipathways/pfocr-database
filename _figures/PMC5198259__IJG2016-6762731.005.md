caption: Genes and biological pathways that were involved in regulation of anthocyanin
  accumulation promoted by hematin. Outermost box represents the cell wall. Bilayer
  oval shape represents the plastid. The red-brown ring and network represent the
  nuclear and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The red crescent represents the
  vacuole. The box in the nucleus represents transcription factors (TFs). Yellow MYB,
  green WD40, and red bHLH represent a ternary transcription factor complex which
  transcribes anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. The circled numbers represent biological
  pathways involved in the regulation of anthocyanin accumulation promoted by hematin.
  ① represents the phytochrome regulation pathway. ② represents the starch and sucrose
  pathway. ③, ④, ⑤, and ⑥ represent phytohormones ABA, JA, Auxin, and CTK regulation
  pathways, respectively. ⑦ represents the Ca2+ regulation pathway. Pfr represents
  the far-red phytochrome. PIF3 represents phytochrome-interacting factor. Each anthocyanin
  biosynthesis regulatory pathway related gene is in .
