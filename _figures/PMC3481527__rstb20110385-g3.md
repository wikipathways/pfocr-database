caption: CB1 cannabinoid receptor signalling and regulation of neural stem/progenitor
  cell proliferation. CB1 receptors are coupled to Gi proteins, thereby mediating
  the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA). CB1 receptor
  coupling to Gi signalling is also associated with activation of the extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway via different mechanisms (see text for details).
  Direct activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways by CB1 receptors may converge,
  thus synergizing with their activation by other receptors such as growth factor
  receptors with tyrosine kinase activity (RTK). CB1 receptor-induced activation of
  RTKs can occur by promoting the processing of membrane-bound growth factor inactive
  precursors to yield active growth factors, or by activating intracellular Src family
  protein kinases. In some circumstances, CB1 activity can antagonize RTK-mediated
  ERK signalling (see [,] for further details). Activation of the CB1 receptor ultimately
  controls different transcriptional regulators, including CREB, STAT-3, PAX-6 and
  β-catenin. The CB1 receptor may also regulate mammalian target of rapamycin complex
  1 (mTORC1) in NPs as it occurs in differentiated neurons.
