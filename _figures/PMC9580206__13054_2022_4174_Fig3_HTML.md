caption: Energy utilization pathways during cell stress. In response to cell stress,
  adipose and muscle tissue catabolism releases free fatty acids (FAA) and branch
  chain amino acid metabolites (BCAA) into circulation (steps 1 and 2). Free fatty
  acids and branch chain amino acid metabolites are taken up by the liver (step 3).
  Metabolic switch including utilization of branch chain amino acid metabolites in
  the TCA cycle, pentose phosphate pathway activation, and incomplete fatty acid oxidation
  resulting in energy production, redox regulation, biosynthesis, and production of
  circulating short-chain acylcarnitines
