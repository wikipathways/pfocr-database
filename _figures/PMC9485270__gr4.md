caption: The components of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The
  signaling cascade begins with the binding of a mitogen or growth signal on a cell
  surface receptor. This binding process allows RAS to exchange GTP for GDP, thus
  continuing the phosphorylation cascade in the cytoplasm until ERK translocates into
  the nucleus. The illustrations were inspired by BioRender.
