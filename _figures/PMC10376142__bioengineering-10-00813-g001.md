caption: Anthrax toxin translocation mechanism. The anthrax toxin protective antigen
  (PA) first binds to the host cell membrane protein receptor anthrax toxin receptor
  ANTXR1/2 and then is cleaved by the host cell surface furin family protease to oligomerize.
  Then, the lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF) are recruited by PA oligomers,
  and the toxin complex is internalized by the host receptor-mediated endocytosis
  pathway. Acidic conditions within the endosome trigger the structural rearrangement
  and channel formation of PA for LF/EF translocation into the cytosol. Refolded LF
  cleaves cytosol target protein MAPKKs from the N-terminal, and refolded EF catalyzes
  the cAMP formation, thus inducing cell necrosis and edema, respectively. This image
