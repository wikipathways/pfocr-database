caption: Pathways significantly affected by iRBC exposure in HMBECs(A) The endosomal
  signaling pathway was affected by co-incubation with ring stage iRBCs and shear
  stress (1.5 dyne/cm2), as demonstrated by mRNA-sequencing.(B) The CXC subfamily
  signaling pathway was affected by co-incubation with ring stage iRBCs and shear
  stress 1.5 dyne/cm2, with six genes downregulated and one gene upregulated.(C) Co-incubation
  with ring stage iRBCs affected expression of genes encoding tight unction components
  in HBMECs, with most genes downregulated in HBMEC1.5+Rings compared with HBMEC1.5+RBCs
