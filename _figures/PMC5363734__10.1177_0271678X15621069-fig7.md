caption: 'Proposed mechanism of pressure-induced, P2Y-dependent activation of TRPM4
  through the Rho signaling pathway in cerebral arterioles. Mechano-sensitive P2Y
  receptors are stimulated by increase in intravascular pressure, which initiates
  the activation of RhoA and ROCK. ROCK subsequently activates TRPM4 channels, and
  causes membrane depolarization, Ca2+ entry through VDCCs, and activation of MLCK,
  which phosphorylates MLC and results in smooth muscle contraction. Additionally,
  ROCK increases the Ca2+-sensitivity of the contractile machinery via inhibiting
  MLCP.ROCK: Rho-dependent protein kinase; VDCC: voltage-dependent calcium channels;
  CaM: calmodulin; MLC: myosin light chain; MLCK: myosin light chain kinase; MLCP:
  myosin light chain phosphatase; Vm: membrane potential.'
