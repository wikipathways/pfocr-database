caption: 'Involvement of calcium in AD progression: A number of factors can increase
  the likelihood of an individual developing sporadic AD. These could include changes
  in age-related calcium handling which result in increased calcium fluxes. Such increases
  are associated with increased production of Aβ, and also with reductions in macroautophagy
  – a clearance pathway for intracellular aggregates. Many genetic polymorphisms have
  been identified which can increase the risk of developing AD, including several
  calcium related genes. Notably, environmental and lifestyle appear to offer both
  great protection and also risk to developing AD. Accumulation of Aβ is considered
  one of the primary steps in developing AD. Aβ can aggregate into oligomers and fibrils,
  which can themselves alter cellular calcium homeostasis leading to increased calcium
  influx into neurons, astrocytes, but also into specific compartments such as mitochondria
  and synapses. Elevation of calcium can lead to synaptic dysfunction, and subsequent
  cognitive deficits. Over time these synaptic dysfunctions could lead to synaptic
  loss, and eventually the neuronal loss that plagues the late stage AD brain. Aβ
  aggregates can also lead to τ phosphorylation, via reductions in the ubiquitin-proteasome
  system, increases in τ kinases and decreases in τ phosphatases. Increases in calcium
  influx have been associated with activation of τ kinases and may also contribute
  to the development of NFTs.'
