caption: 'Structural landscape of druggable proteome in oncology drug discovery. In
  total, 18 selected cancer genes with well-annotated driver mutations and available
  protein three-dimensional structures across five classic cancer pathways were illustrated:
  1) PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway, 2) EGF/EGFR signaling, 3) RAS pathway, 4) cell metabolism
  pathways, and 5) hormone (estrogen/androgen) pathways. Cancer driver mutations were
  collected from My Cancer Genome (https://www.mycancergenome.org/). Protein structures
  were collected from PDB database (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do).'
