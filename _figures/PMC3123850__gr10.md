caption: A proposed mechanism by which VEGFR2 stimulation predisposes to renal injury
  in the mouse kidney. EMC, extracellular matrix; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition;
  NO, nitric oxide; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, platelet-derived
  growth factor receptor; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor β1; TI, tubulointerstitial;
  VEGFR2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Dashed lines indicate a proposed
  pathway that was not demonstrated in the present study.
