caption: Schematic representation of N-linked protein glycosylation and O-antigen
  biosynthesis. (A) Bacterial N-glycosylation pathway. The oligosaccharide is assembled
  on the undecaprenyl–P–P carrier by the activity of PglC and additional glycosyltransferases
  in reactions that occur on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. The LLO
  is translocated into the periplasm by the ABC transporter PglK (NBD=nucleotide-binding
  domain). The oligosaccharyl transferase (OTase) PglB transfers the oligosaccharide
  to Asn residues of acceptor proteins. (B) Wzy-dependent pathway for O-antigen synthesis
  in Gram-negative bacteria. The O-antigen subunit is assembled onto undecaprenyl–P–P
  by the activity of WecA and additional glycosyltransferases in reactions that occur
  on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Lipid-linked O-antigen subunits
  are translocated by Wzx, polymerized and transferred to the lipid A-core oligosaccharide,
  that is assembled by an independent pathway. (C) N-glycosylation in eukaryotes.
  A dolichylpyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharide is assembled on the cytoplasmic side
  of the ER membrane and then translocated by RFT1 into the ER lumen. Oligosaccharide
  synthesis is completed before transfer to Asn residues by the OTase. Symbols have
  been attributed to the sugar residues according to the CFG nomenclature, the symbols
  for bacillosamine and ramnose have been newly introduced.
