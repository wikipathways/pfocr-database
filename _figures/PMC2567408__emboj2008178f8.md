caption: NCAM upregulation leads to a functional switch. A working model of the molecular
  mechanisms underlying the change in NCAM subcellular localization and its interacting
  partners during EMT is depicted. In epithelial cells, low levels of NCAM form a
  complex with FGFR and PLCγ leading to the activation of the Raf-kinase PKCβII and
  thus to a sustained activation of the MAPK pathway and cell adhesion. Upon loss
  of E-cadherin function during EMT, NCAM is highly expressed, and a subset localizes
  to lipid rafts where it associates with p59Fyn, leading to FAK phosphorylation,
  focal adhesion assembly and cell migration. Both NCAM-mediated signalling pathways
  are required for neurite outgrowth. In contrast, FGF-induced stimulation of FGFR
  results in PLCγ-mediated activation of PKCα and a short pulse activation of the
  Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway resulting in cell adhesion and proliferation. FGF-induced signalling
  is over-ruled by the NCAM-mediated signals (; ).
