caption: After irisin binds to membrane receptors, AMPK phosphorylation increase,
  and its downstream Akt/eNOS and Akt/mTOR signaling cascades are activated, thereby
  promoting NO secretion, autophagy, and angiogenesis, and inhibiting apoptosis and
  ROS production. On the other hand, irisin can also inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory
  factors by inhibiting p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and promote angiogenesis and cell
  proliferation, and inhibit apoptosis by activating ERK signaling pathway.
