caption: Reversing resistance or enhancing the efficacy of targeted therapy and chemotherapy
  by targeting the ferroptosis pathway. (A) Targeted drugs exert antitumor effects
  by blocking oncogenic signaling pathways, but innate or acquired resistance reduces
  their efficacy. (B) One of the mechanisms of resistance is reduced susceptibility
  to ferroptosis. Targeting multiple pathways in ferroptosis to restore their response
  to ferroptosis could eliminate resistance or improve the efficacy of existing standard
  treatments, including chemotherapy and targeted therapy. System Xc− and GPX4 have
  critical roles in preventing ferroptosis and potential targets to reverse treatment
  resistance. Other factors that regulate the redox of intracellular lipid are also
  have critical roles in anticancer treatment resistance. Many approved drugs target
  those potential targets and may reverse the resistance by exploiting ferroptosis
  pathway.
