caption: 'Mechanisms Underlying Micropatterning-Mediated Regulation of Cell Behavior.
  Micropatterning can influence cell behavior through various mechanisms, including:
  Integrin Signaling: Integrins sense mechanical signals from external micropatterns
  and recruit proteins like Talin and vinculin, thereby regulating F-actin assembly.
  This leads to cytoskeletal remodeling and consequent changes in cell behavior. Focal
  Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) Pathway: Integrins transmit
  mechanical signals to FAK, which activates the ROCK signaling pathway. This pathway
  further regulates F-actin dynamics, impacting cell behavior. FAK can also activate
  the BMP2 signaling pathway, influencing gene expression through p-Smad phosphorylation.
  LATS1/2 Activation: F-actin’s influence extends to the activation of LATS1/2, which
  governs the phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ. This phosphorylation determines whether
  YAP enters the nucleus and binds to TEAD, ultimately affecting gene expression.
  The LINC complex and Lamin also play pivotal roles in this process. Notch Signaling:
  Micropatterning can also modulate cell behavior through the Notch signaling pathway.
  Notch activation results in the production of Notch intracellular domain (NICD),
  which can bind to DNA binding protein RBP-J (also known as CSL or CBF1) to regulate
  gene expression. These intricate mechanisms collectively contribute to the regulation
  of various cellular behaviors in response to micropatterns, providing a deeper understanding
  of the cellular responses observed in micropatterning experiments.'
