caption: The summary of Treg-of-B (P) cell generation and their molecular mechanisms
  in alleviation of asthmatic inflammation. In the process of generation of Treg-of-B
  (P) cells, Peyer’s patch B cells would activate T cells with STAT6 phosphorylation.
  Phosphorylated STAT6 could trigger IL-4 production and then lead to positive feedback
  loop to increase the cell viability, via enhancing Bcl-2 and BclXL, and reducing
  Bax, and sustain the STAT6 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated STAT6 would regulate
  LAG3 expression, which mediated the suppressive ability of Treg-of-B (P) cells and
  alleviated murine model of airway inflammation.
