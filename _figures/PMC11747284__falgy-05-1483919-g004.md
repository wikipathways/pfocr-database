caption: The schematic represents the PRLR signaling pathways, including both long
  and short isoforms. Homodimer of the hPRLR long form (LF) mediates PRL-stimulated
  JAK2/Stat5 signaling required for transcription/expression of PRL/PRLR target genes,
  which are essential for the various biological effects of the hormone. The activation
  of the MAP kinase pathway involves both PRLR isoforms. The connections between the
  JAK-Stat and MAPK pathways are also suggested, but the interactions between receptors
  and various transducing molecules remain unclear. (Created with BioRender)
