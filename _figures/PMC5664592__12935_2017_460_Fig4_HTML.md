caption: Signal transduction pathway of the BCR-ABL fusion gene and Imatinib action.
  Imatinib selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity that is responsible for
  the signaling pathway illustrated through tyrosine kinase phosphorylation of these
  interactions. Main signaling pathways associated with the oncogenic activity of
  the BCR-ABL gene is MYC, RAS, MAPK, STAT and PI3K. These pathways result in the
  inhibition of gene transcription, mitochondrial processing of apoptotic reactions
  and cytoskeletal organization culminating in an increase in abnormal cell activities
  including unimpeded proliferation, angiogenesis and enhanced cell survival. When
  Imatinib binds to the tyrosine kinase receptor it in turn deactivates these pathways
  resulting in cell death of the mutated leukemic cell (produced with Microsoft® PowerPoint®)
