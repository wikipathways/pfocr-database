caption: Macrophage infection affects host metabolic state and can induce an M1 profile.
  M1 macrophages are characterized by a hyper-activated glycolysis coupled with a
  limited mitochondrial activity (limited OXPHOS and FAO) upon lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) or interferon gamma (IFNγ) activation (left part). The transporter Glut 1
  and the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase 2 (HEK2) and phosphofrucotkinase 2 (PFK2)
  are activated (central part) in a hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α)-dependent
  manner. LPS also activates the uncoupling protein 2 (ucp2) transcription via p38
  and JNK pathways, leading to a decrease in pyruvate incorporation into TCA cycle.
  Some pathogens (vacuolar or cytosolic, right part) can use glycolytic derivatives
  [such as pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) metabolites, amino acids, and lactate]
  as nutrients to sustain their propagation.
