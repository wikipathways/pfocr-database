caption: Macrophages can chemotaxis and migrate to adjacent tissues of IVD such as
  paraspinal muscles, DRG, facet joints and fat; and then synthesize more pro-inflammatory
  factors such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, resulting in spinal cord hyperalgesia, inducing
  or exacerbating LBP. The macrophages toward M1 polarization will lead to the accumulation
  of lactic acid in muscle, and the decrease of PH value can up-regulate the expression
  of ASIC3. Macrophages infiltrating into the damaged DRG promote the secretion of
  inflammatory mediators and induce neurogenic pain; macrophages can infiltrate the
  facet joints, aggravate the inflammation and degeneration of the facet joints, and
  cause LBP. Macrophages are the main source of GDF3 in damaged tissues, and PPARY
  in macrophages can promote tissue repair and regeneration by regulating the expression
  of GDF3. Chemokines CX3CL1 and CCL2 recruit macrophages and bind to CX3CR1 and CCR
  on macrophages,respectively, inhibiting the release of IGF1 and aggravating the
  inflammatory response; the chemokine MCP-1 could bind to CCR2, inducing and aggravating
  inflammation. The LPS acting on TLR4 in macrophages will lead to increased release
  of pro-inflammatory factors through the NF-KB signaling pathway.
