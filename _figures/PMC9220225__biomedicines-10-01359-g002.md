caption: Main molecular effects of 2-HG in AML cells. The reduction of α-KG to 2-HG
  by mutated IDH enzymes leads to profound alterations in the biology of AML cells.
  The inhibition of α-KG-dependent dioxygenases–such as TET2 []—alters the chromatin
  architecture, thus rewiring gene expression and inducing differentiation blockade.
  Moreover, 2-HG leads to metabolic deregulation through the activation of the mTOR
  pathway and the inhibition of the HIF pathway. The increase in ROS levels resulting
  from NADPH consumption and altered mitochondrial respiration contributes to the
  blockade of differentiation and the aggressiveness of AML blasts.
