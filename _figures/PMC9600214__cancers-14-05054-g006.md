caption: Schematic view over most important NADPH-related pathways in the cytosol
  and the major pathway for lactate and hydrogen ion production. NADPH plays a vital
  role in the reduction of the increased oxidative stress in cancer [,,,]. NADPH is
  known to be produced through several fermentable metabolic pathways, where most
  depend on glucose or glutamine [,]. ➀ The most important pathway for NADPH production
  is the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that emanates from glycolysis and depends
  on glucose for its function [,,]. ➁ The second most important pathway for NAPDH
  production is conversion from malate to pyruvate, fueled by glutamine and increasingly
  important during glucose deprivation [,,,]. ➂ In some cancers there is another pathway
  for NADPH production, mainly glutamine fueled, utilizing isocitrate dehydrogenase
  [,,]. ➃ Hydrogen ions are produced as a product of the glycolysis pathway (red)
  and are exported out from the cytosol, thereby contributing to the low pH in the
  TME [,]. ➄ Lactate can be produced either both from glucose (red) or from glutamine
  (blue) and is exported out from the cytosol (black) and contributes to high lactate
  levels in TME [,]. ➅ Schematically describing the NADPH pool in the cytosol and
  how it is constantly refilled from pathways mainly dependent on glucose and glutamine
  [,,]. ➆ The reduction power from NADPH is used to detoxify the cells from oxidative
  stress. Glutathione (GSH) is one of the most important scavengers of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) in cancer cells and when oxidized by ROS to glutathione disulfide
  (GSSG) it is reduced back to GSG by NADPH [,].
