caption: Dysregulation of the Myostatin Pathway in Mtm1−/y MiceThe members of the
  myostatin pathway analyzed in this manuscript at the mRNA or protein levels are
  indicated in this figure. Genes regulation in Mtm1−/y mice is represented by color-coding
  as follows; upregulated genes (green), downregulated genes (red), or unchanged compared
  to WT (blue).
