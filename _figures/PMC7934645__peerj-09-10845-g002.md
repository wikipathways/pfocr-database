caption: MAZ induced-FOXF2 activation negatively regulates the mesenchymal markers
  and EMT-TFs in BLBC to inhibit EMT. FOXF2 inhibits the EMT properties mediated by
  FOXC2 and FOXQ1 that are thought to be tumor suppressors through directly binding
  to the FOXC2 promoter or recruiting NCOR1 and HDAC3 for co-expression, respectively.
  VEGF-C/VEGFR3 pathway involved in angiogenesis can also be inhibited by the expression
  of FOXF2. FOXF2 represses CDK2-RB-E2F, Wnt/β-catenin and EGFR pathway to inhibit
  excessive cell proliferation. Moreover, FOXF2 regulates ECM homeostasis by transcriptional
  activation of TIMP3, the inhibitor of MMP.
