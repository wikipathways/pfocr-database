caption: The signaling pathway for treatment of angiogenic boosting. Erythropoietin,
  a crucial cytokine for hematopoiesis, significantly boost angiogenesis by elevating
  the expression of nitric oxide (NO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
  and its receptor, which are critical for new blood vessel development. Similarly,
  statins, which are commonly used to reduce lipid levels, also promote angiogenesis
  in ischemic conditions by enhancing neurogenesis and upregulating VEGF. Phosphodiesterase
  inhibitors, such as cilostazol and sildenafil, improve cerebral endothelial function
  and angiogenesis by activating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), which increases NO
  levels. This overall enhancement of angiogenesis crucially upregulates endothelial
  cell viability and function, thereby aiding in the recovery of cerebral blood flow
