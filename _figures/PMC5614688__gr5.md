caption: Cross-talk between the signal transduction pathways involved in mechanical
  stimulation and diacerein treatment of chondrocytes. Mechanical stimulation (illustrated
  with a flash) is transduced via the integrin/FAK (focal adhesion kinase) pathway,
  modulating proteinkinase C (PKC), Phosphoinositid-3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B-cells (NF-κB). Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) activates the extracellular signal–regulated
  kinases (ERK1/2) and NF-κB, which subsequently regulate cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)
  and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Arachidonic acid (AA) via COX2 is converted to prostaglandin
  H2 (PGH2) which is further processed into and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by prostaglandin
  synthase (PGES). PGE2 acts via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/PI3K/ protein
  kinase B (PKB, Akt). Receptors for platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) function via
  the Akt, Ras, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), Scr signaling. Inhibition by mechanical
  stimulation is given by a blue T, inhibition by diacerein is represented by a black
  T. The inflammatory pathway is marked by red arrows.
