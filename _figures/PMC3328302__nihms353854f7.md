caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed interaction between CDH17 and
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway during HCC progression. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is frequently
  activated during tumorigenesis. Genomic amplification and/or overexpression of CDH17
  induces cadherin switch and initiates epithelial-mesenchymal transition, probably
  through destabilization of the E-cadherin/catenin complex, inhibition of GSK-3β/Axin-based
  proteosome activity, and activation of cyclooxygenase 2/cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein
  kinase A signaling pathway. Thus, nuclear shuffling and accumulation of β-catenin
  would result in LEF/TCF-mediated transcription of Wnt-responsive genes, such as
  cyclin D1 leading to HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. Knockdown CDH17 expression
  by shRNA both in vitro and in vivo could inhibit tumor growth and enhance cell death,
  and the underlying antitumor mechanism involves relocalization of β-catenin to the
  cytoplasm and a concomitant reduction in cyclin D1 and an increase in Rb.
