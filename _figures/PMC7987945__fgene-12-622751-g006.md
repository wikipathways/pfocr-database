caption: Predicted protein to protein interaction network of the four co-expressed
  DEGs in LWF, SYF and LYF follicles of HR and LR hens. (A) Presumed regulatory network
  of GABRA1 in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway by using the STRING
  database; (B) Inferred interaction network of NDUFAB1 in oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway; (C) Deduced regulatory network of NCAM2 in cell adhesion molecules interaction
  pathway; (D) Predicted interaction network of LOC424014 in putative methyltransferase.
