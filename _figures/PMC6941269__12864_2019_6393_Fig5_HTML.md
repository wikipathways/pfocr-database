caption: Simplified diagram of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. a Cluster analysis
  of expression profiles of HCT, C3H, CCoAOMT, FLS and LAR. b Simplified diagram of
  flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. c Cluster analysis of expression profiles of C4H,
  CHS, CHI, F3H, F3’H, F3’5’H, DFR, LDOX/ANS and ANR. The heatmaps was clustered by
  pearson method of Mev4.90 software. Heatmaps indicate the gene expression levels
  by Log2 [FPKM+ 1] with a rainbow color scale, each row represents a single gene,
  and each column represents a sample. The IDs and names of selected DEGs are indicated
  to the right of the histograms
