caption: Cell cycle, cellular growth and proliferation pathways detected by ingenuity
  pathways analysis. Forty-one miRNA target SNPs with individual genotype data were
  assessed, 12 miRNA SNP-related genes were detected in the pathway with tumour necrosis
  factor (TNF) and cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor (CDKN) centrally located in the
  molecular network.
