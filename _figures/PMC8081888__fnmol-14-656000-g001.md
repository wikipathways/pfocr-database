caption: 'Metabolic pathways of glucose metabolism. Representation of key steps in
  glucose metabolism. Upon entering the cell, glucose is first metabolized by HK into
  G6P, consuming ATP. G6P can branch off into the PPP pathway, producing R5P and generating
  large amounts of NADPH as a byproduct. R5P is a precursor for creating nucleic acids.
  NADPH generated by the PPP can be used to scavenge ROS via glutathione reduction,
  converting H2O2 into H2O. G6P is further metabolized into F6P and subsequently into
  FBP. FBP is metabolized into one molecule of DHAP and another of GADP. DHAP can
  branch off into lipid biosynthesis where it is a precursor for phospholipids and
  triacylglycerol. Otherwise, DHAP is transformed into GADP and both GADP molecules
  are metabolized into 3-PG, generating ATP in the process. 3-PG can be used for serine
  biosynthesis, which can then contribute toward synthesis of sphingolipids as well
  as glycine and cysteine. 3-PG goes on to be metabolized into PEP and then into pyruvate
  by PK activity. Pyruvate can: serve as substrate for alanine biosynthesis; be converted
  to lactate by LDH (known as anaerobic respiration or aerobic glycolysis); enter
  a mitochondrion where PDH metabolizes it into Acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA then enters
  the TCA cycle, where it is metabolized in a series of sequential reactions resulting
  in citrate, α-KG, succinate, fumarate, malate, oxaloacetate which cycles back to
  citrate. Some of these reactions generate byproducts such as NADH and FADH2. NADH
  and FADH2 are then used for OXPHOS, generating ATP in the inner mitochondrial membrane
  matrix. Abbreviations: α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; ADP, adenosine
