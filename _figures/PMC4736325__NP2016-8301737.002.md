caption: Synaptic binding partners and signaling pathways of BAI adhesion-GPCRs. (a)
  Synaptic interactions of BAI1. On the N-terminal segment of BAI1, the TSRs and the
  RGD motif are predicted to bind integrins. The TSRs also putatively bind complement
  C1ql factors, although the function of this interaction is unclear. BAI1 activates
  the RhoA pathway by coupling with Gα 12/13, although this has only been shown in
  cultured HEK293T cells and requires confirmation in neurons (red outline). The C-terminal
  region of BAI1 binds to IRSp53 via its proline-rich region (PRR), but the function
  of this interaction needs to be further explored. BAI1 also interacts with the Rac1
  activator modules ELMO1/DOCK180 (via the α-helical RKR motif (HD)) and Tiam1/Par3
  (via the PDZ-binding motif (PBM)). However, only the Tiam1/Par3 interaction is required
  for BAI1's effects on dendritic spine formation and excitatory synaptogenesis. In
  addition, BAI binds to the ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 and suppresses its polyubiquitination
  activity on PSD95, stabilizing PSD95 expression levels. (b) Synaptic interactions
  of BAI3. The TSRs and the CUB domain of BAI3 have been shown to bind complement
  C1ql factors C1ql3 and C1ql1, respectively. In cerebellar development, the C1ql1-BAI3
  interaction helps establish proper synaptic connectivity in Purkinje cells and maintain
  a single-winner climbing fiber. The α-helical RKR motif (HD) of BAI3 also interacts
  with ELMO1/DOCK180 to regulate dendritogenesis, but the role of this interaction
  in synaptogenesis remains to be determined.

    (a) Synaptic interactions of BAI1. On the N-terminal segment of BAI1, the TSRs
