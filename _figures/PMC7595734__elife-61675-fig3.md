caption: Certain pathogens can obtain nutrients directly from their environment and
  may not require host cell invasion for lipid uptake. (A) Borrelia spp. are extracellular
  bacteria and acquire lipids directly from mammalian cells and the blood. B. burgdorferi
  also organizes its membrane into eukaryotic-like lipid rafts. (B) Trypanosoma brucei
  is extracellular in both mammalian and arthropod hosts. These parasites acquire
  various lipids from the blood and can synthesize their own fatty acids using the
  type II fatty acid synthase system (FASII) and the microsomal elongase pathway when
  resources are restricted. In the tsetse fly, the enzyme acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase
  (ACC) regulates the microsomal elongase pathway based on lipid abundance. (C) Trypanosoma
  cruzi is extracellular in its trypomastigote and epimastigote forms. Within the
  triatomine, epimastigotes acquire various lipids from the blood meal. Additional
  lipids function as signaling molecules and promote the differentiation from epimastigotes
  into metacyclic trypomastigotes. At this stage, metacyclic trypomastigotes may be
  deposited in the skin of a mammal before invading cells to become amastigotes. Intracellular
  amastigotes transform into trypomastigotes, burst out of host cells, and enter the
  bloodstream. PC = phosphatidylcholine, PG = phosphatidylglycerol, HDL = high density
