caption: Proposed model from the present study. A proposed schematic summarizing the
  observations following hydrogen gas post-conditioning and subsequent neuroprotection
  against SAH. SAH increased neuronal pyroptosis, which hydrogen gas post-conditioning
  not only significantly attenuated, but also improved neurological dysfunction further
  downstream. This may be associated with increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and phosphor-decreased
  p38 MAPK activation by opening mitoKATP. 5-HD, an inhibitor of mitoKATP, could partially
  reverse these neuroprotective effects. DAMP, damage associated molecular patterns;
  mitoKATP, mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channels.
