caption: 'A schematic model of the Smoothened receptor signaling pathways controlling
  KCC2 activity. (A) In the absence of the ligand Shh, the Patched (Ptch) receptor
  maintains the Smoothened (Smo) receptor in an inactive state. Smo signaling can
  be activated either by the binding of Shh which inactivates Ptch and releases Smo
  or by the binding of its agonist SAG (Shh Signaling Agonist). Smo signaling can
  operate through: (1) canonical pathway which activates the transcription factors
  Gli allowing transcription of Gli target genes, (2) Non-canonical pathway that is
  Gli-independent but triggers transient calcium currents allowing transcription of
  targeted genes. (B) Left: (1a) Constitutive activity of the Smo-CA receptor promotes
  Gli1 downstream target genes expression. (1b) The Smo-Gli1 signaling pathways activate
  the phosphorylation of KCC2 at the residue Serine 940, increasing KCC2 function
  and stability at the cell surface, which renders GABAergic transmission less depolarizing.
  (2) The Smo/Gli1 signaling pathways may modify the synthesis/transport of sterols,
  impacting the composition of the plasma membrane and lipid rafts and the stability
  of KCC2 at the cell surface. (3) The Smo-Gli1 pathway may also regulate chloride
  ions homeostasis and KCC2 function through a second messenger. Right: (4) Dominant-negative
  activity of Smo-ΔN represses Gli1 expression. (5) Inhibition of Smo-Gli1 signaling
  pathway induces dephosphorylation of residue Serine 940 and KCC2 internalization.'
