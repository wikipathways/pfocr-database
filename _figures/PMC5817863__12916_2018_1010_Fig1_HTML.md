caption: 'Schematic view of the circadian pathway. CLOCK and NPAS2 form heterodimers
  with ARNTL (also known as BMAL1) or ARNTL2 (BMAL2); these heterodimers act as transcription
  factors binding to enhancer box (E-box) elements upstream of target genes. Besides
  the clock-controlled genes (CCGs), which mediate the circadian pathway physiological
  functions, CLOCK and NPAS2 activate the transcription of other core circadian genes
  such as PER1, PER2, PER3 and CRY1, CRY2. PER and CRY proteins heterodimerize and
  activate a negative feedback loop acting directly on CLOCK and NPAS2. The activity
  of PER and CRY proteins is also regulated by additional proteins such as CSNK1E
  and CSNK1D (inhibition) and TIMELESS (unclear effect), respectively. CLOCK and NPAS2
  also transactivate the expression of other pathway components such as NR1D1, NR1D2
  (also known as REV-ERBs) and RORA, RORB and RORC (which are transcription factors
  acting through ROR/REV-ERB elements): these proteins can inhibit or enhance ARNTL
  transcription, respectively, which adds a further level of modulation of CLOCK/NPAS2
  activity. Green lines, stimulatory effect (positive loop); red lines, inhibitory
  effect (negative loop)'
