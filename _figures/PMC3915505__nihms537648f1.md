caption: Schematic view of the infective cycle of reovirus. Initial infection occurs
  through interaction between the virion and junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAM1)
  and sialic acid residues on the cell membrane (1). The virus is internalised in
  an endosomal compartment where it is partially digested to form the intermediate
  subviral particle (ISVP) (2). Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) escapes for the
  endosome (3). In cells that contain normal wild-type RAS genes, the presence of
  dsRNA leads to phosphorylation of PKR (4) and subsequent activation of eIF2α (5).
  This in turn leads to shutdown of viral protein synthesis, thus aborting a productive
  infection (6). In contrast, in cells with mutant RAS or an activated Ras pathway,
  PKR remains in a hypophosphorylated form (7) and viral RNA species are able to direct
  synthesis and assembly of daughter virions (8).
