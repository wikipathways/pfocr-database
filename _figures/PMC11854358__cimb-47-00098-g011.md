caption: Hypothesized mechanistic diagrams for the effect of PFESA-BP2 exposure on
  EGF signaling and JAK/STAT signaling based on previous supportive studies. (A) Our
  proposed mechanism for the inhibition of EGF signaling at 6.0 mg/kg-day PFESA-BP2
  exposure [84]. Inhibition occurred in association with the underexpression of core
  genes EGFR and EGR1 (depicted in red). (B) Our hypothesis for the mechanism by which
  PFESA-BP2 exposure at 3.0 mg/kg-day significantly altered genes and downstream regulators
  within JAK/STAT signaling [85]. The overall pathway was activated at 0.3 mg/kg-day,
  increasing the activation of STAT and the transcription of target genes. The two
  downstream oncogenic signaling pathways, MAP2K and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, were activated
  (depicted in green), increasing cell proliferation and oncogenic activity. The downregulation
  of SOCS2 (depicted in red) decreases the inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling, increasing
  its activation and risk of HCC development. (C) Our proposed mechanism for JAK/STAT
  signaling inhibition by PFESA-BP2 exposure at 6.0 mg/kg-day, decreasing the activation
  of STAT and the transcription of target genes [86]. Downstream MAP2K and PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling was activated and inhibited, respectively. Increased MAP2K signaling activates
  genes involved in transcription. As a result, the overexpression of JUN, a key transcription
  factor in JAK/STAT signaling, increases cell proliferation and oncogenic activity.
  Reduced PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling decreases the activation of STAT and the transcription
  of target genes. The downregulation of SOCS2 decreases the inhibition of JAK/STAT
  signaling, increasing the activation of the pathway and risk of HCC development
