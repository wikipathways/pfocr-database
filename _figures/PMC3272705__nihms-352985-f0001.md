caption: Subcellular itineraries of paradigmatic substrates of ubiquitin-dependent
  sorting pathways. (a) Yeast carboxypeptidase Cps1 is biosynthesized as a transmembrane
  precursor form (pCps1), which is transported from the biosynthetic pathway to endosomes.
  Ubiquitination in endosomes, mediated by Rsp5, provides a signal for recognition
  by the ESCRT machinery. Before the inclusion within the ILVs of MVBs, pCps1 is deubiquitinated
  by Doa4. When the MVBs fuse with the vacuole, the ILVs and their content are delivered
  to the vacuole lumen. Here, the ILV membranes are degraded by lipases, whereas pCps1
  is processed into the mature form (mCps1) by specific proteases. (b) The Na+ channel
  ENaC is delivered to the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells where it functions
  to channel Na+ from the extracellular space into the cells. Residency of ENaC in
  the apical plasma membrane is controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, which
  ubiquitinates ENaC and thereby signals its Epsin-dependent endocytosis from clathrin-coated
  pits and delivery to an apical early endosome. Deubiquitination by UCH-L3 or USP2-45
  favours recycling of ENaC to the plasma membrane via the apical recycling endosome.
  ENaC molecules that remain ubiquitinated are recognized by the ESCRT machinery and
  sorted into the MVB pathway for lysosomal degradation. (c) When the epidermal growth
  factor (EGF) binds to its receptor (EGFR) at the plasma membrane, this induces a
  conformation change of the receptor that promotes dimerization. This triggers tyrosine
  phosphorylation, which, in addition to initiating signal cascades, promotes receptor
  ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl. The activated receptor is endocytosed
  and delivered to an early endosome. If the ligand dissociates in the early endosome,
  ubiquitination is no more sustained, and the EGFR becomes deubiquitinated by the
  DUB AMSH. This promotes recycling to the plasma membrane. If still activated in
  the endosome, the EGFR remains ubiquitinated and is recognized by GGA3 and the ESCRT
  machinery. This causes its sorting into ILVs following deubiquitination by the DUB
  USP8. The receptor and its ligand are degraded when the MVB fuses with a lysosome.
