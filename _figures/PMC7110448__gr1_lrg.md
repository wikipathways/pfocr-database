caption: Activation of cell death pathways in IAV-infected epithelial cells. Following
  IAV infection, the viral protein NS1 inhibits apoptosis by activating the PI3K/Akt
  pro-survival pathway, therefore leading to increased viral replication. Later, viral
  proteins, predominantly NP, activate caspase signaling to facilitate viral protein
  packaging and virion production, leading to viral egress and consequentially apoptosis.
  Unknown viral factors induce necrosis through unelucidated mechanisms, causing enhanced
  inflammation. Finally, IAV-infected epithelial cells undergo necroptosis, a programmed
  form of necrosis involving the proteins RIPK3 and MLKL. By eliminating the natural
  replicative niche of the virus, necroptosis helps limit viral replication. Solid
  arrows indicate both direct viral and host effects, while dashed arrows indicate
  indirect by-products.
