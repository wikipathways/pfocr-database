caption: Overview of light regulation on ascorbate biosynthesis. Ascorbate biosynthesis
  is regulated transcriptionally by the ascorbic acid mannose pathway regulator 1
  (AMR1), ethylene response factor 98 (ERF98), and Solanum lycopersicum basic helix–loop–helix
  (bHLH) transcription factor 59 (slbHLH59; tomato-specific). AMR1 has negative effects
  on GMP, GME, GGP, GPP, GDH, and GLDH in Arabidopsis. AMR1 expression decreases rapidly
  under light; thereafter, ascorbate levels increase. AtERF98 is the positive regulator
  of the ascorbate pathway by directly binding to the promoter of VTC1, and up-regulating
  the expression of VTC1, VTC2, GDH, and GLDH. The light-specific functionality of
  ERF98 has yet to be investigated. slbHLH59 activates the genes of the pathway in
  tomato fruits and increases ascorbate levels under the light. The close homolog
  of this transcription factor (TF) in Arabidopsis is unfertilized embryo sac 12 (UNE12),
  however, its role for ascorbate biosynthesis has yet to be investigated. Ascorbate
  undergoes post-translational regulation via constitutive photomorphogenic9-signalosome
  subunit 5B (CSN5B), VTC3, and the feedback regulation of VTC2. CSN5B binds to VTC1
  and promotes its degradation under the dark. VTC3 is a putative kinase/phosphatase
  for light regulation of ascorbate. Feedback regulation of ascorbate is controlled
  by an unusual open reading frame (uORF), located upstream of the VTC2 gene. uORF
  functionality under the light needs further investigations. Ascorbate is also controlled
  via photosynthetic and mitochondria electron transport chains, designated as photosynthetic
  electron transport chain (pETC) and mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC),
  respectively. This relationship is bidirectional.
