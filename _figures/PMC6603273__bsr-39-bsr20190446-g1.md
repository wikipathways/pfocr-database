caption: 'The first step is deamination by a branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT),
  followed by a three-step cycle: condensation by a MAM, isomerisation by an isopropylmalate
  isomerase (IPMI) and oxidative decarboxylation by an isopropylmalate dehydrogenase
  (IPMDH). At this point the intermediate will either go through another cycle or
  exit by transamination by a BCAT. The pathway intermediates are (1) amino acid,
  (2) 2-oxo acid, (3) 2-alkylmalic acid, (4) 3-alkylmalic acid and (5) chain-elongated
  amino acid.'
