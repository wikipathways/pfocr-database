caption: Inflammatory response induced by the unfolded protein response. Upon ER stress,
  PERK undergoes its dimerization and autophosphorylation to phosphorylate eukaryotic
  translation initiator 2α (eIF2α) and Janus kinase 1(JAK1), which respectively promote
  activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) expression and signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, thereby leading to inflammatory gene
  expression. In addition, translation attenuation by PERK-dependent phosphorylation
  of eIF2α results in decreased translation of both IκB and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)
  but elevation of the proportion of NF-κB to IκB, owing to the shorter half-life
  of IκB, thereby promoting NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response. In response to ER
  stress, activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) increase the expression
  of functionally active proteins of XBP1s, leading to inflammatory gene expression.
  During ER stress, interaction of IRE1α and TRAF2 can promote NF-κB-mediated inflammatory
  response by triggering IκB kinase (IKK)/κB pathway and nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain 1 and 2 (NOD1/2)/receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2)
  pathways. In addition, both IRE1α-mediated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD)/retinoic-acid
  inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) pathway and IRE1α-induced expression of spliced x-box-binding
  protein 1 (XBP1s) are responsible for activating NF-κB. In addition to the activation
  of NF-κB, IRE1α-TRAF2 complex can also recruit apoptosis signal-regulating kinase
  1 (ASK1) and subsequently activate JNK, thereby resulting in expression of pro-inflammatory
  genes by stimulating the bZIP transcription factor activator protein 1(AP-1). Upon
  ER stress, ATF6 is transported to Golgi, where it is cleaved by Site-1 protease
  (S1P) and Site-2 protease (S2P), releasing its active cytosolic fragment (ATF6f).
  ATF6f as a transcription factor, directly participate in regulating inflammatory
  response. Besides, ATF6f can also activate NF-κB by inducing the phosphorylation
  of the AKT.
