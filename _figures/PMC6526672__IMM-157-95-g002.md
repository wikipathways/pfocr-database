caption: The signalling pathways involved in glucose metabolism‐regulated NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. Glucose metabolism mainly involves glycolysis, the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The metabolites participating
  in glycolysis are HK1 and PKM2. HK1 promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation by enhancing
  glycolysis levels, requiring mTORC1 activation. Active PKM2 activates NLRP3 via
  lactate‐induced EIF2AK2 phosphorylation, and dimeric PKM2 combined with HIF1‐α promotes
  pro‐IL‐1β transcription. NADPH mostly derived from the PPP downregulates the expression
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome components, and a decreased amount of NAD + facilitates
  NLRP3 and ASC assembly by suppressing α‐tubulin deacetylase SIRT2 activity. The
  metabolites involved in the TCA cycle are citrate and succinate, both of which active
  the NLRP3 inflammasome. Succinate promotes HIF1‐α stabilization by reducing prolyl
  hydroxylase (PHD) release and induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.
  Active Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and enhances the expression of proteins
  to suppress ROS.
