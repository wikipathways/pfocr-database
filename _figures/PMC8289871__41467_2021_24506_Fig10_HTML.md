caption: Pancreatitis inducing agents, such as fatty acid/ethanol metabolite palmitoleic
  acid (POA) impair metabolism, most notably mitochondrial function, leading to ATP
  depletion and inhibition of Ca2+ clearance pathways, such as the plasma membrane
  Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA), leading to cytotoxic Ca2+ overload. The net effect of ATP depletion
  and cytotoxic Ca2+ overload is rapid necrotic cell death, a major hallmark of acute
  pancreatitis. Insulin binding to the insulin receptor leads to the downstream activation
  of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway and the direct Akt-mediated phosphorylation and
  activation of the key glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase fructose bisphosphatase-2
  (PFKFB2). This leads to the production of the key glycolytic metabolite fructose
  2,6-bisphosphate, which is an allosteric activator of the rate limiting phosphofructokinase-1
  (PFK1), which in turn drives glycolytic flux and thus glycolytic ATP production
  and supply to the PMCA. This appears to be sufficient to maintain acinar cell ATP
  and prevent inhibition of the PMCA, even in the face of impaired mitochondrial function,
  thereby protecting against necrotic cell death and the self-perpetuating tissue
  injury and spiralling inflammatory response characteristic of acute pancreatitis.
  During diabetes (Ins2Akita mice) and in PACIRKO mice, this endogenous insulin protection
  is abolished, leading to more severe acute pancreatitis. Moreover, exogenous insulin
  administration, using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp to infuse high dose
  insulin while maintaining close glucose control, ameliorates or protects against
  further pancreatic injury suggesting a potential therapy for severe acute pancreatitis.
