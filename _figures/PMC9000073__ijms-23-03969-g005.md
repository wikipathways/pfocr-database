caption: De-acylation/re-acylation cycle (Lands pathway) []. Lands pathway is a phospholipid
  remodeling mechanism through the de-acylation/re-acylation cycle where Lyso-PL is
  produced from PL through PLA2 action or from acyl-CoA through acyl-CoA-hydrolase’s
  action. Lyso-PL with the action of acyl-CoA-acyltransferase and in the presence
  of FA leads to PL production. (Copyright © 2022, Elsevier).
