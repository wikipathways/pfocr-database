caption: Glycolipid and phospholipid biosynthesis pathways in  S. pneumoniae , GAS
  and GBS. Genes of known or predicted function in each pathway are indicated. Lipids
  and substrates in black are common to all three species, in green are specific to  S.
  pneumoniae  (Spn), in red are specific to GBS, in blue are present in  S. pneumoniae  and
  GAS, and in purple are present in both GAS and GBS. DAG, diacylglycerol; Glc2-DAG,
