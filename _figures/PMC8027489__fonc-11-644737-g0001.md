caption: Schematic representation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and its main components.
  The PI3K pathway regulates diverse cellular processes, including protein synthesis,
  cell survival, proliferation, glucose metabolism, apoptosis, DNA repair, and genome
  stability. Akt-mediated phosphorylation inhibits the activity of the TSC1–TSC2 complex,
  also known as hamartin-tuberin. This is a critical step for the negative regulation
  of mTORC1, whose activity controls anabolic processes. Another important downregulation
  of Akt phosphorylation is toward BAD, while MDM2 activity is enhanced, promoting
  the degradation of the tumor-suppressor p53, which also plays a part in the P300-mediated
  cell apoptosis. Cell cycle regulation occurs through the stimulation of cyclins
  A and D and the inhibition of GSK3. The latter event is also responsible for increased
  glucose metabolism. PTEN is intimately involved in the regulation of these mechanisms
  through its substrate PIP3. Notably, the activity of PTEN in the cell nucleus that
  leads to cell survival control is related to the upregulation of key mediators,
  such as RAD51, CDNPC, and P300. RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; CKR, chemokine receptor;
