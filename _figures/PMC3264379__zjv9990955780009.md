caption: Proposed model for regulation of HCV replication mediated by the Ras/Raf/MEK
  pathway. HCV infection can activate the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway. On the other hand,
  activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway can inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway and attenuate
  the expression of ISGs, such as the OAS and PKR genes, resulting in the derepression
  of HCV replication. This demonstrates a possible mechanism of evasion of the host
  antiviral system by HCV and provides a reasonable explanation for the low response
  to IFN therapy in HCV-infected patients. Upon HCV infection, the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway
  is activated and causes downregulation of IFNAR expression, reduces the phosphorylation
  status of STAT1 and STAT2, and lowers the expression of ISGs such as the OAS and
  PKR genes. All of these events result in dysfunction of the JAK-STAT pathway. By
  these mechanisms, HCV creates a suitable in vivo environment for its own replication.
