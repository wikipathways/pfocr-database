caption: 'Riparian–stream interactions that could be altered by salt additions. Direct
  pathways are solid lines, indirect pathways are dashed, shapes are pools and arrows
  are processes. Hexagons represent inorganic salt pools. Circles represent detrital
  pools. Squares represent living biotic pools. White text represents abiotic processes,
  yellow text represents biotic processes. Numbers next to text are for reference
  to the specific processes connecting pools. Pathway 1 (PW1: pink arrows) demonstrates
  how salts can impact stream detrital processing through direct salt inputs and runoff
  (runoff (1)) and subsequent increased stream salinity that may impact osmoregulation
  of aquatic biota (microbial decomposers, detritivores and algae) (osmoregulation
  (2)); the quality of detritus (detrital quality (3)), aquatic biota consumption
  of detritus and associated microbial decomposers and algae (consumption (4)) also
  interact to mediate the amount and quality of detritus (double-headed arrows). Decomposition
  of detritus (decomposition (5)) changes the quality and quantity of fine particulate
  (FPOM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) that is consumed (6) by microbial decomposers
  and detritivores to then influence the timing and emergence (7) of aquatic insects.
  Pathway 2 (PW2: green arrows) demonstrates how salts may indirectly impact detrital
  processing from plant uptake of salt in riparian systems (uptake (8)). The resulting
  salt-enriched plant tissue and leaf litterfall (litterfall (9)) are then deposited
  to aquatic or terrestrial systems, which impact terrestrial biota (microbial decomposers
  and detritivores) by altering consumption (consumption (10)) and decomposition in
  riparian systems (decomposition (11)). Altered consumption and decomposition of
  leaf litter changes the quantity and quality of FPOM and DOM that can enter stream
  systems (leaching & transport (12)). Pathway 3 (PW3: blue arrows) demonstrates how
  salt can directly impact terrestrial detrital processing by increasing salt consumption
  by microbial decomposers and detritivores (consumption (13)) and then alters their
  growth and decomposition (decomposition (14)) and the subsequent generation and
  quantity of FPOM and DOM input to riparian and stream systems (leaching and transport
  (12)) or consumption by terrestrial microbial decomposers and detritivores (consumption
  14). Lastly, these three pathways may ultimately impact microbial decomposers and
  detritivore emergence timing and quantity (emergence (7)) that generates positive
  or negative feedback loops between riparian and stream systems. Drawings by Natalie
