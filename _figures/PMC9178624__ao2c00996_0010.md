caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed role of the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway
  in the endothelial H2S production and vasodilation in rat cerebral arteries. Acetylcholine
  (ACh) acting on the M receptor in the endothelial cell results in increases in CSE
  and 3-MST protein expression and H2S production. There is an interaction of reciprocal
  inhibition between the H2S and the RhoA. The H2S released from endothelial cell
  inhibits the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway in the vascular smooth muscle cell, and
  the inhibition reduces phosphorylation of MLC (p-MLC) and intracellular free Ca2+
  concentration ([Ca2+]i) and leads to a subsequent relaxation of the vascular smooth
  muscle cell.
