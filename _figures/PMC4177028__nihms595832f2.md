caption: Intracellular energetic units (ICEUs). ICEUs include sites of ATP hydrolysis
  (myofibrillar ATPases, sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase, ion-pump ATPase) which are
  relied to the mitochondrial ATP synthesis through the creatine kinase (CK)/PCr network.
  Metabolic or randle cycles include free fatty acids (FFA) and glucose (GLU) transport
  and degradation. FFA is taken up by a family of plasma membrane proteins (fatty
  acid transporter protein, FATP1, fatty acid translocase, CD36) and esterified to
  acyl-CoA via fatty acyl-CoA synthetase. The resulting acyl-CoA is then transported
  into mitochondria via carnitine palmitolyltransferase I (CPT and CPT II). Once inside,
  acyl-CoA becomes a substrate for the β-oxidation pathway (β-FAO), resulting in the
  production of one molecule of NADH, one molecule of FADH2, and one molecule of Acetyl-CoA.
  Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle, where it is further oxidized to CO2 with the concomitant
  generation of three molecules of NADH, one molecule of FADH2 and one molecule of
  ATP. GLU is taken up by glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) and enters the glycolysis
  pathway, which converts glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (PYR), two net ATP
  and two NADH. NADH is transferred into mitochondria via the malate–aspartate shuttle
  (mal/asp shuttle). OAA, oxaloacetate. Pyruvate enters into the Krebs cycle and oxidative
  phosphorylation (OxPhosph) via Acetyl-CoA. NADH and FADH2 issued from both metabolic
  pathways are oxidized in the respiratory chain. Mitochondrial creatine kinase (MtCK)
  catalyses the direct transphosphorylation of intramitochondrial ATP and cytosolic
  creatine (Cr) into ADP and phosphocreatine (PCr). ADP enters the matrix space to
  stimulate OxPhosph, while PCr is transferred via the cytosolic Cr/PCr shuttle to
  be used in the functional coupling between CK and ATPases (acto-myosin ATPase and
  ion pumps). Feedback regulation of mitochondrial ATP synthesis is performed by Cr/Pc,
  ADP, Pi ratios. Cell signaling via AMP kinase (AMPK) provides a parallel control
  of most of these processes, including substrate uptake via fatty acid and glucose
  transporters and flux via β-FAO and glycolysis. Reproduced from  with permission.
