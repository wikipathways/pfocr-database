caption: Overview of protein modification by the ubiquitin and the proteasome system.
  Ubiquitin is activated, transferred, and conjugated to a target protein by the action
  of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. This process is balanced by the action of de-conjugating
  enzymes. Modified proteins can undergo degradation via the endosome/multi-vesicular
  body (MVB)/lysosome pathway or via the 26S proteasome with and without adaptor proteins.
  Functional activation [e.g. IκB kinase (IKK) via ubiquitination of its regulatory
  subunit NEMO or associates] or translocation (e.g. polyubiquitination of p53) can
  be other consequences. Proteins, modified by ubiquitin or the ubiquitin-like (UBL)
  modifiers NEDD8 or FAT10, are ‘escorted’ to the 26S proteasome by ubiquitin-domain
  proteins. As for ubiquitinated proteins, the escort process can be supported by
  E4 enzymes, which extend the ubiquitin chain by a few more ubiquitin molecules.
  This allows binding of adaptor proteins such as Rad23, whose UBL domain is recognized
  by the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-like domain of the Rpn1/S2 subunit of the 19S proteasome.
  Besides substrate binding, the 19S complex facilitates deubiquitination and unfolding
  of the target protein by virtue of its ATPase activity as well as opening of the
  proteolytic tunnel of the 20S proteasome, which is formed by four stacked rings
  (two outer α-rings and two inner β-rings), each with seven subunits. Conformational
  changes of the gating structures of the outer α-rings, namely the N-terminal ends
  of the α2-, α3-, and α4-subunits, allow this opening into the inner proteolytic
  chamber. The subunits of the regulatory α-rings are paired over their numerically
  corresponding β-subunits. On the other hand, the subunits on the inner two β-rings
  are aligned counter to each other such that the β1 subunit of one ring lies above
  the β7 unit of the other ring. This orientation allows a staggered spatial distribution
  of the N-terminal threonin residues of the active centres of the β1-, β2-, and β5-subunits
  for caspase-like, trypsin-like, and chymotrypsin-like activity, respectively (matches
  ascending order of significance for cell viability with the β5-subunit as the most
  important). These proteolytic activities degrade target proteins into oligopeptidic
  products, which are 8–12 amino acids in length on average and are processed further
  by proteases. In addition to operating in conjunction with the 19S complex as the
  26S proteasome, the 20S proteasome can function independently. In this mode, hydrophobic
  structures of misfolded or (oxidatively) damaged proteins rather than regulatory
  subunits induce conformational changes of the gatekeeper α-subunits and gain access
  into the proteolytic tunnel. Further details regarding the proteasomal system are
  provided elsewhere.
