caption: Signaling Pathway of Estrogen Receptor. Estrogen can cross the plasma membrane,
  where it interacts with intracellular ER and ER to affect DNA directly. The GPER1
  and/or ER and ER can interact with estrogen to cause it, to activate intracellular
  signaling cascades as an alternative. Estrogen-mediated signaling events can be
  classified as genomic and non-genomic due to differences in the cellular and molecular
  processes regulating gene expression, in which estrogen-receptor complexes can bind
  to DNA directly or indirectly. The migration of estrogen-receptor complexes into
  the cell nucleus and direct contact with chromatin at particular DNA sequences known
  as estrogen response elements are two examples of genomic impacts (EREs). More than
  one-third of human genes controlled by estrogen receptors are reported to lack ERE
  sequence elements, although EREs have been found in multiple gene promoters and
  regulatory regions. Contrarily, non-genomic impacts entail the indirect control
  of gene expression via a range of intracellular signaling occasions. Below is a
  description of the known ways through which estrogens regulate both genomic and
  non-genomic aspects of gene expression.
