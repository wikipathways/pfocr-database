caption: 'Proposed metabolic and hemodynamic changes induced by caloric restriction
  (CR). This figure shows the comparison between old control and CR rats. CR downregulated
  glucose metabolic pathway (with reduced glucose uptake, glycolysis, lactate, and
  glucose-glycogen recycling) but upregulated ketogenic pathway. The ketone bodies
  may come from astrocytic fatty acid oxidation or blood stream. Ketone bodies are
  converted to acetoacetate and then further metabolized to acetyl-CoA. The altered
  metabolic pathway resulted in enhanced TCA cycle flux and glutamate-glutamine recycling
  (Vcyc(tot)) between neurons and astrocytes. Elevated CBF may be due to enhanced
  neuronal activity and increased ketone bodies levels. *This was shown in our previous
  study (). Abbreviations: BHB, β-hydroxybutyrate; CBF, cerebral blood flow; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid.'
