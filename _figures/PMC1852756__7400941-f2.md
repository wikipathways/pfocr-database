caption: The small nuclear ribonucleoprotein biogenesis pathway. RNA polymerase II
  transcribes snRNAs as precursors containing an m7G cap and short 3′-end extensions
  in the nucleus. The cap-binding complex (CBC) binds nascent snRNAs and mediates
  the recruitment of the phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export (PHAX), exportin 1
  (Xpo1) and ras-related nuclear protein GTP (RanGTP) for nuclear export. In the cytoplasm,
  the seven Sm proteins bind first to the chloride conductance regulatory protein
  (pICln) and the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) complex—which symmetrically
  dimethylates SmB, SmD1 and SmD3—and then to the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex.
  The SMN complex bound to the Sm proteins interacts with snRNAs and mediates Sm core
  assembly. Hypermethylation of the 5′ cap of snRNAs by trimethylguanosine synthase
  1 (TGS1) occurs after Sm core formation; both the SMN complex and snurportin, which
  associates with the 5′ cap of snRNAs, then bind to importin-β and mediate snRNP
  nuclear import. The SMN complex and snRNPs transiently localize to Cajal bodies,
  in which snRNPs undergo further maturation steps including methylation and pseudo-uridylation
  by small Cajal body-specific ribonucleoproteins (scaRNPs), before functioning in
  pre-messenger RNA splicing. Depending on the cell type and developmental stage,
  the SMN complex also localizes to Gems. snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein.
