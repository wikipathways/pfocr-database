caption: Schematic representation of miRNAs, their related gene targets and cellular
  pathways likely involved in MFS aortopathy. In blue, miRNAs involved with the Hippo
  signaling pathway (related to adherens junctions) and TP53 signaling (related to
  cell cycle); in black, miRNAs belonging to the “cell cycle” pathway; in green, miRNAs
  belonging to the “P53 signaling” pathway. MiR-26a and miR-217 are involved in Hippo
  signaling, whereas miR-145 and miR-25 are involved with adherens junction regulation,
  and their downregulation promotes the activation of CDH1/APC genes, allowing for
  matrix remodeling. MiR-27b, miR-30d, miR-27a and miR-29c are involved in P53 signaling,
  whereas let-7f-5p is involved in “cell cycle signaling”, likely through CCNA2 and
  TP53 upregulation. Downregulation of the miR-29 family induces the expression of
  collagen types I and III, influencing cardiac fibrosis, which is likely responsible
  for the compromised aortic distensibility and systemic compliance in MFS patients.
