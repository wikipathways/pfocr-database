caption: (A)Cadherins, HEG1 and integrins are three transmembrane receptors connected
  to CCM proteins or functions. All three receptors are already known to play in different
  steps of vessel morphogenesis. Possible cross-talks between their dependent signaling
  pathways through CCM proteins are represented by arrows.(B)CCM2 is a scaffold for
  small GTPases of the Rho family and for p38MAPK kinase. It is involved in actin
  cytoskeleton remodeling through scaffolfing of Rac, activation of the p38 MAPK kinase
  pathway and proteosomal degradation of RhoA. CCM2 could also be involved directly
  or indirectly in Cdc42 activation. As a result, cell-cell junctions, cell polarity
  and lumen formation are likely dependent on CCM2 signaling.
