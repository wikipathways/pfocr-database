caption: Schematic representation of the entire signaling pathway. The FOXC1 transcription
  factor regulates miR-31-5p expression in LoVo cells or OR-LoVo cells. The low nuclear
  localization of FOXC1 causes low miR-31-5p expression and high LATS2 expression,
  leading to apoptosis and increased OXA-based chemosensitivity in LoVo cells. By
  contrast, high miR-31-5p expression regulates the chemoresistance to OXA after FOXC1
  binds to the miR-31 promoter of miR-31-5p, which targets LATS2, leading to cancer
  growth and suppression of apoptosis in OR-LoVo cells.
