caption: 'The androgen-androgen receptor signaling pathway. A: The androgen receptor
  gene resides on the long arm of X chromosome (locus Xq11-Xq12). Upon transcription
  it produces mRNA containing 8 exons interrupted by introns which codes for the AR
  protein made up of 919 amino acids. AR protein contains several functional domains
  such as N-terminal domain (NTD), DNA binding domain (DBD) and ligand binding domain
  (LBD); B: Ligand binding domain of androgen receptor in complex with its ligand
  5-α-dihydrotestosterone (5ADHT). The crystal structure of the androgen receptor
  ligand binding domain in complex with 5-alpha dihydrotestosterone (PDB ID 1T7T with
  resolution 1.70Å) was downloaded from RCSB protein databank. The PyMOL molecular
  visualization system was used to represent the protein-ligand complex in cartoon-sticks
  form; C: General mechanism of AR signaling. Testosterone diffuses into the cells
  and gets converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) via the action 5-α-reductase (5-a-R).
  DHT binds to the ligand binding pocket of androgen receptor (AR) and promotes its
  dissociation from the heat shock protein (HSP). Free AR then translocate into the
  nucleus and binds to androgen receptor element (ARE) present in the promoter region
  of AR responsive genes. At the promoter AR recruits components of basal transcriptional
  machinery such as TATA binding protein (TBP), transcription factor IIF (TFIIF),
  and cAMP responsive element binding protein (CRBP) which ensures the transcription
  of AR responsive genes'
