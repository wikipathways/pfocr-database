caption: a. At 6 hrs-7 days post-BNT162b2 prime, DCs and macrophages in dLNs take
  up the vaccine and express spike proteins. These innate cells are highly activated
  and produce cytokines, including IL-6, IFNα, IFNγ, MCP1, and MIP1b. In this process,
  the MDA5-IFNAR1 signaling pathway is essential for IFNα production and innate cell
  activation. b, At days 7 to 21, strong GC B and TFH responses are induced in B cell
  follicle. CD8 T cell response is increased mildly in both spleen and lung tissue.
  c, At days 1 to 3 days post-boost, much more IFNγ is produced by NK, CD4, and CD8
  T cells, contributing to the enhanced innate cell activation after boost. d, At
  21 days post-boost, the antibody response, CD4, and CD8 T cell responses increase
  significantly. The MDA5-IFNAR1 signaling pathway is essential for CD8 T cell response
  in both spleen and lung tissue.
