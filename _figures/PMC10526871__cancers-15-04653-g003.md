caption: 'ERs can act through genomic and non-genomic pathways in PCa. In the genomic
  pathway, estrogen triggers the dimerization of ERs and their nuclear translocation
  to regulate the transcriptional activity of genes. ERs can directly control the
  transcription of genes bearing the estrogen response element (ERE) in their promoter
  region. In addition, ERs can modulate gene transcription through protein−protein
  interactions with other transcription factors (TF), which can mediate the recruitment
  of ERs at promoters without EREs. In the non-genomic pathway, membrane-associated
  ERs can participate in signal transduction and modulate the activation of key enzymes
  and molecular pathways, thus resulting in the indirect regulation of transcriptional
  programs. Known ER-regulated transcriptional programs in PCa: (I) ERα: transactivation
  of proliferative, apoptotic, survival, differentiation, vasodilation, autophagy,
  and inflammation targets; transactivation of oncogenes and non-coding RNAs. (II)
  ERβ1 transactivation of apoptotic, anti-proliferative, anti-invasive, and anti-inflammatory
  targets; repression of AR, oncogenes, and hypoxic genes. (III) ERβ2 and ERβ5—stabilization
  of the HIF-1α protein and induction of hypoxic genes. Created with BioRender.com,
