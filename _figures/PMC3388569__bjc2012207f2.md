caption: Shared biological pathway activation between chemotherapeutic agent treatments.
  The Pearson correlation test was performed to analyse the relationship between IC50
  values and gene expression. Genes whose expression highly correlated with the IC50
  value associated with each drug (P<0.01) were uploaded into the GeneGo MetaCore
  software to identify significantly represented pathways (P<0.05). (A) Ovarian cancer
  cell line sensitivity to carboplatin or cisplatin treatment was associated with
  1201 and 454 genes, respectively. Genes associated with OVCA sensitivity to carboplatin
  and cisplatin were represented in 77 (carboplatin) and 68 (cisplatin) biological
  pathways. (B) Ovarian cancer cell line sensitivity to paclitaxel or carboplatin
  plus paclitaxel treatment was associated with the expression of 1025 and 1049 genes,
  respectively. Genes associated with OVCA sensitivity were represented in 64 (paclitaxel)
  and 25 (carboplatin plus paclitaxel) biological pathways. (C) Ovarian cancer cell
  line sensitivity to carboplatin plus paclitaxel treatment or carboplatin was associated
  with the expression of 1049 and 1201 genes, respectively. Genes associated with
  OVCA sensitivity were represented in 25 (carboplatin plus paclitaxel) and 77 (carboplatin)
  biological pathways. (D) Ovarian cancer cell line sensitivity to carboplatin plus
  paclitaxel treatment or cisplatin treatment was associated with the expression of
  1049 and 454 genes, respectively. Genes associated with OVCA sensitivity were represented
  in 25 (carboplatin plus paclitaxel) and 68 (cisplatin) biological pathways.
