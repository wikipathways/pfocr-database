caption: Proposed association between the Cpx envelope stress response and the ETC.
  Upon activation of the Cpx response, CpxR represses the transcription of the operons
  encoding the NDH-I and cytochrome bo3 respiratory complexes. The Cpx response may
  further regulate the biogenesis of these complexes at the posttranscriptional level
  through increased expression of protein-folding and -degrading factors. These complexes
  also contribute to Cpx pathway activity. OM, outer membrane; PP, periplasm; CP,
  cytoplasm; Q, quinone; Cyo, cytochrome.
