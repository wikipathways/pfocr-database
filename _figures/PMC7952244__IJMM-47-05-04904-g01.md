caption: Chronic inflammation is closely associated with age-dependent IR. The expression
  levels of inflammatory factors, such as MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α and leptin are
  upregulated, while the expression levels of adiponectin are downregulated in aging
  WAT. Subsequently, aging WAT is infiltrated by macrophages, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T
  cells and Treg cells. Excessive metabolic products flux into the mitochondria during
  aging, resulting in the overproduction of ROS and spin-down of electrons, which
  can result in oxidative stress and ultimately, damage the activation of the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway, thereby inducing IR. MCP-1, monocyte chemotactic protein 1; WAT,
  white adipose tissue; Treg, T regulatory; ROS, reactive oxygen species; IR, insulin
  resistance; IRS, insulin receptor substrate.
