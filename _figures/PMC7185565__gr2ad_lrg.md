caption: PDZ domain proteins are involved in a variety of signal transduction pathways.
  (A) PDZ domains interact with neuronal receptor proteins. A neuronal synapse is
  depicted showing PDZ proteins and several receptors they bind. (B) Adhesion proteins
  and associated PDZ domain proteins found at tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions
  (AJs). (C) Proteoglycan adhesion proteins that target of PDZ domain proteins. (D)
  A simplified representation of the Wnt pathway, both the canonical and noncanonical
  branches of the Wnt pathway are shown. PDZ proteins that interact with the Frizzled
  receptor are listed. (E) Regulation of CFTR by PDZ-domain proteins. CFTR is associated
  with NHERF2 and the LPA2 GPCR in a complex. On lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) activation
  of LPA2, adenylate cyclase (AC) is inhibited through Gi resulting in low cAMP levels
  and inhibition of CFTR. Activation of AC occurs through Gs (e.g., adenosine receptor),
  which increases cAMP levels and CFTR activity.
