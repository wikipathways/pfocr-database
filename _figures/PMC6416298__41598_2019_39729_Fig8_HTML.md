caption: Tonic inhibition is due to effects on ICC. Schematic illustrating how tonic
  inhibition affects ICC. Release of nitric oxide (NO) from enteric inhibitory motor
  neurons activates sGC in ICC, which leads to increased cGMP, and a subsequent decrease
  in Ca2+ release from ER. Reduced Ca2+ release decreases Ano1 activation, which due
  to the electrically coupled nature of the SIP syncytium leads to reduced excitability
  of SMCs. Also possible, but not tested in the current study, might be direct effects
  of NO on SMCs that may reduce contractions via the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway, leading
  to desensitization of the contractile element (CE) to cytoplasmic Ca2+.
