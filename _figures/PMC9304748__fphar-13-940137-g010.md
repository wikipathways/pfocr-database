caption: Proposed mechanism of midazolam for ameliorating acute liver injury and related
  oxidative stress induced by CCL4. Under normal physiological conditions, the Nrf2
  protein level is tightly controlled by Keap1. Upon oxidative stress treatment, midazolam
  can bind to Keap1 stably, and hinder the coalition between Keap1 and Nrf2. Nrf2
  is released and translocation to the nucleus to bind to AREs and initiate the anti-oxidative
  response by upregulating the expression of downstream target genes including HO-1
  and SOD, which then decreases intracellular ROS production and alleviates oxidative
  stress-induced cytotoxicity. Midazolam ameliorates acute liver injury induced by
  carbon tetrachloride via enhancing Nrf2 signaling pathway.
