caption: Metabolic coordination of macrophage activation. (A) Inflammatory (M1) activation.
  LPS and/or IFNγ stimulation increases glucose consumption, which is converted to
  lactate instead of entering the Krebs cycle as pyruvate. The pentose phosphate pathway
  and fatty acid synthesis are activated to generate biomolecules. These metabolic
  alterations depend in part on HIF-1α, which stimulates glucose entry and conversion
  to lactate and directly promotes M1 gene expression. (B) M2 polarization depends
  on increased β-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids. This is fuelled
  by the uptake and lysosomal breakdown of TAGs and the de novo synthesis from glucose.
  PPARγ and PPARδ bind these intracellular lipids and are key effectors of the metabolic
  and phenotype switch upon IL-4 stimulation. (C) Macrophages display a metabolically
  activated phenotype upon stimulation with SFAs. In the adipose tissue, one mechanism
  of SFA uptake is through the digestion of dead adipocytes at crown-like structures.
  Binding of LPS primes macrophages towards the pro-inflammatory effects of SFAs,
  leading to a distinct macrophage phenotype that secretes inflammatory mediators
  such as IL-1β. PPARγ has a dual role in stimulating the clearance and breakdown
  of dead adipocytes, and inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines. ER,
  endoplasmic reticulum; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  SFA, saturated fatty acid; TAGs, triacylglycerides; UFA, unsaturated fatty acid.
