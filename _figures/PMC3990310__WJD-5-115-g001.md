caption: 'A schematic representation of the arachidonic/thromboxane metabolic pathway:
  Arachidonic acid generated from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 and phospholipase
  C undergoes additional enzymatic transformation by cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2)
  into prostaglandin and thromboxane metabolites. In platelets, Arachidonic acid (AA)
  is metabolized by COX-1 into prostaglandins PGG2, PGH2 and by thromboxane synthase
  into the bioactive thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent activator of platelet
  aggregation with a short half-life. TXA2 is quickly inactivated into a more stable
  thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and converted in the liver into an 11-dehydro-thromboxane
  B2 (11dhTXB2) metabolite excreted in the urine. Aspirin (ASA) irreversibly inhibits
  platelet COX-1 leading to decreased thromboxane-mediated platelet activation. TXA2
  and 11dhTXB2 can be generated by COX-2 present in various inflammatory cells, pathway
  not affected by ASA.'
