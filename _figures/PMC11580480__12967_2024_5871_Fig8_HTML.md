caption: Summary chart. This study begins with models of normal and intrauterine adhesions.
  To investigate the fibrosis mechanism, we identified differential miR-195-5p through
  tissue exosome sequencing and verified our findings across cell, tissue, animal,
  and human levels. Treatment with agomir-195-5p increased Smad7 by inhibiting YAP
  in the Hippo pathway, reducing ECM deposition and reversing myofibroblast transdifferentiation.
  This led to the repair of endometrial fibrosis, resulting in a thicker endometrium
  and increased gland number
