caption: Contribution of Rho to canonical Wnt3A signaling. Cytosolic β–catenin is
  continuously degraded in unstimulated cells via a process initiated by its binding
  to a complex of proteins that includes axin, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
  protein and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), termed the β–catenin destruction
  complex. This complex interacts with β– catenin to induce its phosphorylation, which
  targets it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome. Wnt binding by
  Fzd and a co-receptor, LRP5/6, activates a positive regulator of the pathway, disheveled
  (Dvl), which in turn inactivates the destruction complex and allows the accumulation
  of cytoplasmic β–catenin [52]. Stabilized β–catenin can then shuttle into the nucleus
  and bind to members of the T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancing factor (LEF) family
  of transcription factors to induce expression of target genes [53]. Wnt3A binding
  to Fzd and LRP5/6 also leads to the activation of RhoA GTPase in a manner that depends,
  at least in part, upon Dvl and possibly other pathways yet to be defined. Our results
  show that activated RhoA, through the stimulation of ROCK, potentiates the β–catenin-dependent
  induction of target genes via unknown intermediates indicated by the dashed line.
  The full activation of these genes, which comprise a subset of the β–catenin targets,
  is dependent on both β–catenin and Rho and is required for Wnt3A–driven cellular
  consequences, including osteoblastic differentiation.
