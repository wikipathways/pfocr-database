caption: Simplified schematic diagram of the basic circuitry and components involved
  with signaling from the ischemic myocardium into the central nervous system. Localized
  ischemia activates cardiac ischemia-sensitive afferent neurons (CISAN) with cell
  bodies in the nodose ganglia (NG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of spinal segments
  C1–C3 and T1–T6, respectively (, ). The CISAN also project to intrinsic cardiac
  ganglia (ICN) (, ). CISAN with cell bodies in DRG synapse in laminae I–V, VII, and
  X, where neurons of the spinothalamic tract (STT) are excited (red-colored pathway
  and solid black large•pathway). Some CISAN project directly into the brain stem
  (cell bodies located in NG), primarily at the nucleus tractus solitarius. As illustrated,
  CISAN contain different profiles of substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), calcitonin
  gene-related peptide (CGRP), and “other” putative neurotransmitters. These are presumably
  released at the dorsal horn sites to activate STT neurons, especially during cardiac
  stress. These nociceptive reflex pathways can be modulated by site-specific electrical
  stimuli delivered to either the spinal cord or vagus (LVS) nerves. The centrally
  derived neuromodulation of nociceptive pathways, evoked from LVS or high cervical
  SCS electrical stimulation (represented by thunderbolt), can arise from pathways
  involving propriospinal neurons (PSN) {1}, interneurons {2}, or from brain stem
  sites either on STT or via PSN {3}, to release neurotransmitters (e.g., dynorphin,
  DYN) to modulate the myocardial ischemia stress-induced release of SP from CISAN.
