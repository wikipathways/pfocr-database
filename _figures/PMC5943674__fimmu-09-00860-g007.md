caption: Metabolomic fingerprint in the lungs of Mtb-infected mice. (A) Heat map showing
  the percentage change in the levels of metabolites in the lungs of Fth−/− mice compared
  to Fth+/+ mice at 4 and 9 weeks postinfection (n = 4). (B) Levels of essential amino
  acids in the lungs of mice at 4 weeks postinfection. (C) Levels of polyamines in
  the lungs of Mtb-infected mice at 4 weeks postinfection. (D) Amino acids feeding
  into the TCA cycle. Arg and polyamine biosynthesis pathway at 9 weeks postinfection
  in lungs of Fth−/− mice compared to Fth+/+ mice. ODC, Ornithine decarboxylase; SPDS,
  spermidine synthase; SPS, spermine synthase; SSAT, spermidine and spermine acetyl
  transferase; DHS, deoxyhypusine synthase; DOHH, deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. Green
  text indicates increased levels of metabolite and red indicates reduced levels in
  the lungs of Fth−/− mice at 9 weeks postinfection. Statistical testing was performed
  using the unpaired Student’s t-test. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of four
  mice (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001).
