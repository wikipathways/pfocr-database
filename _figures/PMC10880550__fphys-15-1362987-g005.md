caption: Complex interactions among GIRK, TRPC1/4/5 and KCNQ channels with GPCRs via
  G proteins α or βγ subunits and PIP2 in neurons. The role of GPCRs in neurons is
  intricate and complicated. When acetylcholine acts on neuronal cells, the physiological
  function of at least three ion channels (TRPC1/4/5, GIRK, KCNQ) must be analyzed
  considering their distribution and expression. In addition, βγ subunit also inhibits
  CaV channels, contrary to activation of GIRK. As for TRPC1/4/5, heteromers seems
  to play a major role in the brain recently, so heteromers should always be considered
  together as well as homomers. In addition to acetylcholine, galanin, norepinephrine
  (NE), and serotonin must always be considered as a neurotransmitter acting on both
  Gi and Gq proteins. Furthermore we must remember that GABA, dopamine, somatostatin,
  neuropeptide Y, and dynorphin, which act on Gi-coupled GPCR pathway, can work inducing
  the direct binding of Gαi proteins to TRPC4/5 homomer. In our hands, Gαq also binds
  directly (Myeong et al., 2018), but the structure of Gαq bound TRPC4/5 has not yet
  been revealed. GPCRs that suppress the M current have been demonstrated to utilize
  Gq/11 proteins for the activation of phospholipase C, leading to the hydrolysis
  of PIP2. PIP2 serves as a diffusible second messenger within the membrane, directly
  influencing the activity of KCNQ currents
