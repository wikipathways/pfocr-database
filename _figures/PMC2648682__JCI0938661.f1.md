caption: PD-1 signaling leads to dephosphorylation of molecules in the T cell activation
  cascade previously phosphorylated in response to TCR ligation. In this issue of
  the JCI, Franceschini et al. show that PD-1 signaling leads to inhibition of IL-2
  signals in Tregs (). (i) IL-2 signaling via the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) induces STAT-5
  phosphorylation (pSTAT-5). (ii) Dimerization and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated
  STAT-5 leads to increased proliferation of Tregs but also to PD-1 upregulation.
  (iii) Increased surface PD-1 expression inhibits STAT-5 phosphorylation (), possibly
  via SHP2. ITSM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif.
