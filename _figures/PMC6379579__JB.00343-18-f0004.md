caption: Differential expression of genes related to the ethylmalonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA
  pathways when cells are grown in the presence of 1,2-PD. Orange arrows represent
  downregulation of the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway in response to 1,2-PD, blue arrows
  represent upregulation of the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway, and black arrows represent
  no significant change in expression. TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
