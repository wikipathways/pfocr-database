caption: miRNAs modulation in direct cardiac reprogramming. The overexpression of
  cardiac-enriched miRNA-1, miRNA-133, miRNA-208, and miRNA-499 in combination with
  inhibitor of the Janus kinase pathway could directly reprogram fibroblasts into
  cardiac-phenotyped cells in vitro. By adding the combination of miRNA-1 and miRNA-133,
  the efficiency of four human cardiac transcription factors-based direct reprogramming
  was significantly enhanced.
