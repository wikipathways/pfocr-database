caption: 'GCs stimulate GSK3ß and inhibit Wnt signaling. Filled (colored) shapes represent
  components of the canonical Wnt pathway and empty (white) shapes represent signaling
  molecules that intersect with the Wnt pathway. GSK3ß is positioned at an interesection
  between the Wnt pathway and protein tyrosine kinase signaling. Lightning bolts indicate
  phosphorylation. Inhibitory and stimulatory effects of GCs are depicted by red and
  green circled G’s, respectively. GCs inhibit growth factors (GF) and the downstream
  PI3K/Akt pathway. Consequently, the inhibitory phosphoryltion of GSK3ß on Ser9 (octagon)
  is attenuated and GSK3ß is thus activated. Outside the canonical Wnt pathway, active
  GSK3ß phophorylates c-Myc on Thr58, resulting in c-Myc degradation. Within the canonical
  Wnt pathway, GSK3ß phosphorylates ß-catenin, resulting in its degradation. This
  adds to increased rates of ß-catenin degradation due to stimulation of Wnt inhibitors
  of the SFRP and DKK families, as well as inhibition of Wnt ligands. Inactivation
  of the Wnt receptor complex stabilizes the ß-catenin destruction complex, where
  ß-catenin is phosphorylated, tagging it for degradation. Accumulation of ß-catenin
  is thus inhibited. Because ß-catenin is a critical co-activator for LEF/TCF transcription
  factors, their target genes (i.e., Wnt target genes) are suppressed. Additionally,
  GCs attenuate expression of some LEF/TCF transcription factors and stimulate that
  of HDAC proteins, which inhibit both ß-catenin and LEF/TCF. Abbreviations : APC
  adenomatous polyposis coli, CK -Iα casein kinase-I α, DVL disheveled, GSK glycogen
  synthase kinase, HDAC histone deacetylase, LRP5 low density lipoprotein-related
  protein 5, SFRP secreted freezled-related protein'
