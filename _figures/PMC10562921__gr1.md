caption: 'Efficient PHB accumulation requires a match between acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) and
  electrons. A: In E. coli wild type, glucose is oxidized through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
  (EMP) and/or the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathways. The numbers represent the relative
  metabolic fluxes through the EMP (red) and the ED (blue) pathways, respect to one
  molecule of oxidized glucose. The harvested ATP is “consumed” in an ATP hydrolysis
  reaction, mimicking the ATP consumed for maintenance or other metabolic processes.
  Names of the metabolites and enzymes are detailed in the Supplementary Material.
  B: It is possible to see that, either using the EMP (red arrow) or the ED pathway
  (blue arrows), there is a mismatch between the catabolic supply of AcCoA and reducing
  equivalents and the demand of AcCoA and reducing equivalents of the PHB synthesis
  pathway: for every two molecules of AcCoA generated, four pairs of electrons must
  be harvested by NAD, NADP or released as formate/H2. However, only one NAD(P)H is
  re-oxidized during the synthesis of 3-(R)-hydroxybutyrate (the monomer of the PHB).
  The other molecules of NAD(P)H have to be re-oxidized in processes delivering electrons
  outside of the cells (respiration or fermentation). Circles represent enzymatic
  steps catalyzed by oxido-reductases. C: Proposed engineered pathway enabling an
  efficient anaerobic conversion of glucose to PHB. Due to the combination of reactions
  from the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas and the Non-Oxidative Glycolysis pathways, we nicknamed
  this engineered pathway as NOGEMP. Note that all the reducing equivalents coming
  from the carbon source can be harvested in the product, approaching the maximum
  theoretical product yield. Names of the metabolites and enzymes are detailed in
  the Supplementary Material.'
