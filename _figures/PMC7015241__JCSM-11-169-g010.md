caption: Working model describing how MYPN and PALLD may promote SRF signalling. The
  SRF coactivator MRTF‐A is sequestered in the cytoplasm through binding to G‐actin
  and incorporation of G‐actin into F‐actin filaments releases MRTF‐A, allowing it
  to translocate to the nucleus where it binds and activates the SRF transcription
  factor. Thus, the nuclear accumulation of MRTF‐A, and consequently SRF activity,
  is regulated by the F‐actin/G‐actin ratio. MYPN inhibits actin polymerization but
  strongly prevents actin depolymerization, with the net result of increasing the
  F‐actin/G‐actin ratio, stimulating the SRF signalling pathway. PALLD both promotes
  actin polymerization and inhibits actin depolymerization and thus has an even stronger
  activating effect on the SRF pathway. Both MYPN and PALLD bind to the central region
  of MRTF‐A, comprising its SAP and LZ domains, possibly further affecting the localization
  or activity of MRTF‐A.
