caption: P2Y receptor signalling could enhance cyst growth. a Remodelling of the normal
  renal tubule (top left) into an enclosed cyst (top right) allows ATP to accumulate.
  Coupled with perhaps reduced nucleotidase activity and the large representation
  of P2 receptor subtypes likely to be present in these cyst-lining epithelial cells,
  an amplifying loop of autocrine signalling could occur that promotes osmotically
  driven fluid accumulation and cellular proliferation. b Exploded view of the apical
  cell membrane lining a hypothetical renal cyst. G-protein-coupled P2Y receptor activation
  triggers release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum or production of cAMP via
  adenylyl cyclase (AC) and subsequent activation of calcium-sensitive chloride channels
  (CaCC) or CFTR, respectively. The facilitated transcellular transport of Cl− creates
  a solute gradient that promotes the osmotic flow of water into the cyst lumen. The
  increase in [Ca2+]i and cAMP can modulate the ERK pathway and consequently cellular
  proliferation
