caption: Molecular events leading to AL amyloidosis and possible targeted therapies.
  The usually small and indolent B-cell clone may produce a light chain (λ in ∼80%
  of patients) with mutations in the variable region, causing low folding stability
  and high protein dynamics, favoring improper aggregation. Interactions with the
  microenvironment, such as extracellular chaperones, matrix components including
  glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and collagen, shear forces, endoproteases, and metals
  modulate aggregation and oligomer formation. Cells may be transiently required in
  the amyloidogenic cascade and promote the initial nucleation of the deposits. The
  oligomers and, probably, the misfolded protein may exert toxic effects, impairing
  cell function and reducing cell viability in target organs. A propensity for certain
  germ line genes to target specific organs has been reported, for instance, LV1-44
  for heart, LV6-57 for kidney, and KV1-33 for liver. Oligomers are on the pathway
  to forming highly organized fibrils displaying an X-ray cross-β fiber diffraction
  pattern. SAP is ubiquitously present in amyloid deposits. The formation of soluble
  amyloid oligomers can be catalyzed by amyloid fibrils. As seen by electron microscopy,
  the amyloid deposits are formed by rigid, nonbranching 10- to 12-nm width fibrils
  and exhibit a characteristic affinity for Congo red staining with birefringence
  under polarized light. Physical and mechanical replacement of parenchymal tissue
  by amyloid deposits cause dysfunction of vital organs. In addition, amyloid fibrils
  may contribute to cell toxicity. The frequencies of involvement of main target organs
  are derived from 1065 patients with AL amyloidosis diagnosed at our center between
  2004 and 2015. The callouts indicate therapeutic targets. (A) The synthesis of amyloid
  light chain can be effectively suppressed by high-dose chemotherapy and conventional
  chemotherapy using drugs that target critical plasma cell functions and, more recently,
  by antiplasma cell immunotherapy. (B) Small molecules able to stabilize the light
  chain variable regions, thus inhibiting proteolysis, aggregation, and proteotoxicity,
  are under development. (C) Counteracting proteotoxicity caused by the misfolded
  light chains and aggregates is a challenging task that might be pursued with molecules
  modulating the mitochondria-mediated production of reactive oxygen species, as well
  as with metal-binding compounds. (D) Inhibitors of fibril formation have been tested
  in vitro, and compounds, such as epigallocatechin gallate, redirecting the oligomer
  off-pathway, are in clinical trials. (E) Immunotherapies, using different antibodies
  targeting diverse epitopes on amyloid fibrils, aiming at promoting the clearance
  of amyloid deposits are now being actively tested in the clinic. ANS, autonomous
