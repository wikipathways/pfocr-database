caption: Schematic diagram of repressed (left) and activated (right) canonical HH
  signaling pathways. In the absence of HH ligands, PTCH localizes to the primary
  cilium and prevents SMO from entering the cilium. This results in phosphorylation-dependent
  ubiquitination of GLI transcription factors, leading to either degradation and clearance
  from the cell (GLI1 and GLI2) or partial proteolysis of GLI3 to form a repressive
  form (GLI3R) lacking C-terminal activation domains. GLI3R enters into the nucleus,
  binds GLI binding consensus sequences, and represses transcription of HH target
  genes. In the presence of HH ligands (SHH, IHH, DHH), PTCH is internalized, allowing
  migration of uninhibited SMO to the primary cilium. This results in increased stability
  and nuclear accumulation of GLI transcription factors and transcription of HH target
  genes (GLI1, BCL2, PTCH, CCND2, CCND1, and ABCG2, among others).
