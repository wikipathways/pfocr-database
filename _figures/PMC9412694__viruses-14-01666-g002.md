caption: 'The impact of mRNA methylations in the innate immune response. (I) Foreign
  unmodified mRNAs (red), but not methylated mRNAs, are sensed in the cytoplasm through
  RLRs, RIG-I and MDA5, thereby triggering their activation and conformational changes
  to recruit MAVS adaptor protein, which in turn will activate TBK1 and IKKε (not
  shown), to induce IRF3 and IRF7 phosphorylation. (II) Phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7
  translocate to the nucleus and initiate IFNB expression. (III) IFNβ binds to the
  IFNAR receptor and activates JAK-mediated STAT2 phosphorylation, which will then
  bind to phosphorylated STAT1 and IRF9. (IV) The STAT1–STAT2–IRF9 complex translocates
  to the nucleus and triggers the expression of a variety of ISGs. RNA methylations
  are involved in many steps of this pathway, regulating the innate response through
  several mechanisms. Foreign and cellular mRNAs (grey) with a 5′-cap structure (m7G
  and 2′-O methylations, filled blue and green circles, respectively) do not trigger
  MDA5 sensing. Similarly, foreign and cellular mRNAs, and circRNAs with m6A-methylated
  residues (filled purple circle), interact with the YTHDF2 reader protein (F2, light
  blue), sensed as “self” and do not trigger RIG-I sensing. M6A methylations also
  regulate the translation of IRF3, IFNAR1 and ISGs by increasing the translation
  efficiency of IRF3 and ISGs, via YTHDF1 (F1, light blue) binding, and by improving
  the mRNA stability of IFNAR1. M6A methylations also regulate MAVS protein levels
  by increasing the mRNA decay of methylated MAVS mRNA. F1: YTHDF1; F2: YTHDF2; M3:
  METTL3; M14: METTL14.'
