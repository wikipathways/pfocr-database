caption: Schematic model of nitric oxide (NO) responsive molecular events in Chlamydomonas
  reinhardtii. The orchestrated implementation of metabolic processes in response
  to NO is achieved by 1. the modulation of NADPH oxidase (RBOL2) and/or ROS signaling
  pathway for the regulation of downstream metabolisms, 2. reduction of NO amount
  via scavenging elements, 3. transient inhibition of photosynthesis together with
  the induction of the antioxidant defense system and modification of the redox state
  to prevent oxidative stress, 4. transient attenuation of transcriptional and translational
  capacity accompanying with the upregulation of the protein trafficking system (ubiquitin,
  SNARE, and autophagy) and molecular chaperone system for dynamic regulation of protein
  homeostasis and function, and 5. enhancement of amino acid catabolism and nitrogen/sulfur
  availability.
