caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), except
  for TLR3, use a MyD88-dependent signaling pathway to induce NF-κB activation. TLR3,
  (and TLR4), on the other hand, can activate MyD88-independent, TRIF-dependent pathway
  to induce NF-κB or type I interferon (IFN) activation. MyD88 recruits TRAF6 and
  members of the IRAK family, leading to the activation of the TAK1 complex. The activated
  TAK1 complex then activates the IKK complex, consisting of IKKα, IKKβ and NEMO (IKK-γ),
  which catalyze the phosphorylation of IκB proteins. IκBs are degraded by the proteasome,
  allowing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus. Simultaneously, the TAK1 complex
  activates the MAPK pathway, which results in the phosphorylation and activation
  of AP-1. NF-κB and AP-1 control inflammatory responses through the induction of
  inflammatory cytokines. The signaling cascade triggered by TLR3 uses MyD88-independent,
  TRIF-dependent pathway. TRIF recruits TRAF3, which then interacts with TBK1 and
  IKKi. These kinases mediate phosphorylation of IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes
  and translocates into the nucleus to regulate transcription. TRIF also interacts
  with TRAF6 and RIP1, which mediate NF-κB activation. Activation of the IRF3, NF-κB
  and MAPK pathways results in the induction of type I IFN, particularly IFN-β.

  description: Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. Toll-like receptors (TLRs),
    except for TLR3, use a MyD88-dependent signaling pathway to induce NF-κB activation.
    TLR3, (and TLR4), on the other hand, can activate MyD88-independent, TRIF-dependent
    pathway to induce NF-κB or type I interferon (IFN) activation. MyD88 recruits
    TRAF6 and members of the IRAK family, leading to the activation of the TAK1 complex.
    The activated TAK1 complex then activates the IKK complex, consisting of IKKα,

    are degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus.
    Simultaneously, the TAK1 complex activates the MAPK pathway, which results in
