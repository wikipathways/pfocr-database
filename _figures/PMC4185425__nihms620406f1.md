caption: (A) T cells are activated when their TcR and CD28 receive antigen-specific
  signals delivered by peptide/MHC complexes (pMHC) and costimulatory signals such
  as CD80 (B7.1), respectively. Activated T cells up-regulate PD-1 and can then be
  suppressed by interaction with PD-L1+ cells. Signaling through PD-1 results in T
  cell apoptosis, exhaustion, and/or anergy, and involves phosphorylation of SHP2
  which blocks the activation of ZAP70, AKT, PI3K, and PKCΘ which mediate the down-stream
  events that culminate in activation through the TcR. PD-1 signaling also activates
  Cbl-b and Smad3 which down-regulate cell surface expression of the TcR and cell
  proliferation, respectively, inhibits the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL, and activates
  the pro-apoptotic gene Bim. PD-L1 also tolerizes peripheral T cells by reverse signaling
  through T cell-expressed CD80. Green and red lines indicate pathways that are activated
  and suppressed, respectively. (B) Crystal structure of the extracellular PD-L1:PD-1
  complex (human PD-L1 and murine PD-1). PD-L1 (shown in red) consists of extracellular
  IgV and IgC domains. PD-1 (shown in blue) consists of a single extracellular IgV-like
  domain. (Structure is from ()).
