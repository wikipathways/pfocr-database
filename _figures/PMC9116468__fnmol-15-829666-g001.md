caption: Schematic of how Siah2 is regulated in developing CGNs. The laminin-rich
  basement membrane surrounding the oEGL in a developing cerebellum promotes Shh signaling
  driven primary ciliogenesis in GNPs via Integrin β1—Ras/Mapk signaling. The primary
  cilium allows GNPs to sense the Shh mitogen and activate the Shh pathway to maintain
  Siah2 expression which in turn promotes GZ occupancy by inhibiting GZ exit. Siah2
  acts in a feed-forward mechanism to maintain mitogen sensitivity by promoting primary
  ciliogenesis through the antagonism of a key cilia disassembly proteins Pifo and
  Dbn, and the polarity inducer Pard3. As GNPs leave the oEGL, the lack of trophic
  support leads to the disassembly of the primary cilium and loss of sensitivity to
  Shh, which promotes CGN differentiation.
