caption: 'The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolome.(A) The de novo
  synthesis of NAD+ from TRYP appears to be more important than NAD+ production leading
  to the production of several neuroreactive compounds such as the neurotoxin and
  NMDA receptor agonist, quinolinic acid, and the NMDA receptor antagonist, kynurenine
  acid. (B) NAD+ can also be produced by the salvage of nicotinic acid, nicotinamide
  and nicotinamide riboside. (C) PARP activity following DNA damage utilized NAD+
  as the essential substrate to repair damaged DNA. Hyperactivation of PARP due to
  accumulation of free radicals can lead to cell death by NAD+ depletion, and energy
  restriction. NMDA: N-methyl D-aspartate; PARP: poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; ROS:
  reactive oxygen species; TRYP: tryptophan.'
