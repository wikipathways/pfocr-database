caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating four possible pathways for NAD biosynthesis.
  The diagram summarizes current knowledge on plants, mainly Arabidopsis, and mammals
  (uniquely the two-step salvage pathway). Arabidopsis produces NaMN using a combination
  of the de-novo pathway (pink background) and the four-step salvage pathway (blue
  background). Synthesis of NAD from NaMN through NaAD is common to both pathways,
  here designated the ‘common pathway’ (green background). The mammalian two-step
  salvage pathway is also shown (purple background). Enzymatic properties of Arabidopsis
  NMNAT make feasible both the catalysis of NaMN to NaAD in the common pathway and
  of NMN to NAD in the two-step salvage pathway. Metabolites unidentified in Arabidopsis
  are ringed by a dashed line. Thin arrows indicate metabolic conversion in NAD biosynthesis
  and the thick arrows indicate NAD degradation and consequent Nam production by PARPs
  or NAD glycohydrolases and NMN production by Nudix hydrolases. Abbreviations: Asp,
