caption: A. The chain-elongation machinery. Methionine enters the chain-elongation
  cycle via deamination by BCAT4 and is subsequently condensed with acetyl-CoA in
  a reaction catalyzed by MAM1 and MAM3. MAM1 can catalyze one to four condensation
  cycles, whereas MAM3 catalyzes one to six cycles. Subsequently, an isomerization
  and oxidation-decarboxylation step occurs and the molecule can re-enter the cycle
  or enter the core pathway following a transamination step. B. Synthesis of the core
  methylthio glucosinolate structure. The first enzymatic step has side chain specificity
  with CYP79F1 that converts both short- and long- chained methionine derivatives
  (n = 1–6) to the corresponding aldoxime whereas CYP79F2 only takes the long-chained
  methionine derivatives (n = 5–6). C. Secondary modifications. Short- and long-chained
  methylthio glucosinolates can be secondarily modified to methylsulfinyl glucosinolates
  in Col-0 leaves. In the seeds, the short-chained methylsulfinyl glucosinolates can
  be further modified to hydroxy and benzoyloxy forms. Characterized enzymes in the
  pathway are noted next to the reaction arrows.
