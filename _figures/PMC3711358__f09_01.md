caption: Diagram of the signal transduction pathway regulating stomatal development.Stages
  of stomatal development are given at the bottom of the figure. Cell color and cell-type
  abbreviations are as described in . EPF1, EPF2 and STOMAGEN activate or inhibit
  signaling via TMM and the ERf, which transduce the signal to the YDA MAPK cascade.
  MPK3/6 inactivates SPCH through phosphorylation, reducing the number of entry divisions.
  Experimental evidence supporting inhibition or activation are shown with solid lines.
  Dashed lines indicate predicted interactions.
