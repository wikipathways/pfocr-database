caption: Mechanisms of MDSC-induced immune suppression and development of hyper-inflammation
  activation in COVID-19. Several mechanisms likely contribute to the MDSC-induced
  immune suppression and development of hyper-inflammation activation seen in patients
  with COVID-19. Delayed production of type I interferon leading to enhanced release
  of monocyte chemoattractants by alveolar epithelial cells leading to sustained recruitment
  of MDSCs into the lungs. TGFβ and IL-10 release by MDSCs can induce further inflammatory
  programs in resident (M2) macrophages while recruiting inflammatory monocytes, as
  well as granulocytes and lymphocytes from circulation. Signaling through activation
  of Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways
  is necessary for MDSC expansion. Increased HIF1α expression can induce the transcription
  of inflammation related genes. The effector mechanisms employed by MDSCs to control
  immune cell subsets depend on the MDSC subtype with PMN-MDSCs mainly use reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and arginase I, whereas M-MDSCs use inducible nitric oxide
  synthase (iNOS) and arginase I to dampen bystander cells. Increased PDL1 expression
  on recruited macrophages and MDSCs can directly decrease antigen-specific T-cell
  activation through interactions with the PD-1 receptor on T-cells. Increased signaling
  through the Galectin-9 and Tim-3 pathway can lead to the inhibition of Th1 or CD8+
  T cell responses. Increased production of TGFb, ROS and L-arginine production by
  MDSC can inhibit the function of NK and CD8+ T cells during disease progression.
  Activated MDSCs contribute to the COVID-19 cytokine storm by releasing high amounts
  of pro- inflammatory cytokines.
