caption: Figure 3. Regulation of neuronal migration within the mammalian cerebral
  cortex by the Reelin/Rap1/N-cadherin pathway and other small GTPases. (A) Reelin
  signals through Rap1 (and its downstream enzymes Ral, Rac and Cdc42) and N-cadherin
  on neurons at the MMZ to polarize them toward the RMZ. Rab5 and Rab11 might also
  be involved. The subsequent glia-guided migration within the RMZ is independent
  of Reelin, Rap1 or N-cadherin. During this migration, the Reelin signal is downregulated
  (degradation of phosphorylated Dab1, downregulation of functional receptors) and
  N-cadherin is downregulated by the Rab7 pathway which may be a consequence of the
  downregulation of the Reelin pathway. When neurons reach the top of the RMZ, they
  undergo a final somal translocation. This final somal translocation could depend
  on the reduction of the Reelin signal or, alternatively, Reelin may induce a second
  set of intracellular signals in cells performing the final somal translocation as
  they are more mature than when they encountered Reelin for the first time in the
  RMZ and are in a different biological context. (B) In the absence of Reelin, Rap1
  or N-cadherin, neurons are disoriented within the MMZ. Rab5 or Rab11 inhibition
  induces a similar phenotype. In the absence of Reelin or Rab7, the final somal translocation
  is also affected and could be, at least in part, a consequence of defective N-cadherin
  downregulation.
