caption: Mechanisms of immune evasion promoted by Tregs and MDSCs via immune checkpoints
  and inhibitory cytokines This figure illustrates how Tregs and MDSCs promote immune
  evasion by inhibiting effector T cell activity through multiple pathways in the
  TME. Tregs interact with antigen-presenting cells via CTLA-4 and secrete IL-10 and
  TGF-β to suppress effector T cells. MDSCs further inhibit effector T cells through
  the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, enhancing tumor immune evasion. The function of NK cells
  is also suppressed, reducing the clearance of tumor cells
