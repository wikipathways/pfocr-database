caption: RNF proteins modulate the RLR signaling pathway. Following the recognition
  of distinct dsRNA features by RIG-I and MDA5, their CARDs recruit and activate the
  downstream adaptor protein MAVS to trigger IRF3 and NF-κB activation, resulting
  in the production of IFN-I and inflammatory cytokines. RNF proteins emerged as key
  regulators via positively (green arrows) or negatively (red T-shaped solid line)
  modulating the RLR signaling pathway. P, phosphate
