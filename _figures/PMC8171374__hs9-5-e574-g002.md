caption: 'ITP pathogenesis. ITP results from a peripheral destruction of platelets
  that takes place in the blood, the spleen, and the liver, together with an inappropriate
  bone marrow production due to an autoimmune response against megakaryocytes and
  insufficient TPO levels. In the blood, platelet destruction is most probably mediated
  by CDC: the binding of antibodies to platelet GP leads to the activation of the
  classical complement pathway and the formation of the MAC, leading to platelet lysis.
  Complement activation also leads to the deposition of C3b on platelet surface, which
  promotes the phagocytosis of opsonized platelets by macrophages in the spleen, mediated
  by the ligation of antiplatelet antibodies to FcγR and C3b to CR1. Splenic macrophages
  are the major antigen-presenting cells that stimulate autoreactive CD4 T cells in
  ITP. These autoreactive T cells contain TFH cells that interact with autoreactive
  B cells and induce their proliferation, their differentiation into plasma cells,
  and the production of antiplatelet antibodies by a mechanism dependent on IL-21
  secretion and CD40/CD154 interactions. BAFF is a cytokine produced by monocytes
  (and polymorphonuclear cells) that participates to the stimulation and survival
  of B cells and plasma cells. Antiplatelet antibodies, by the recruitment of neuraminidase-1
  at platelet membrane, trigger platelet desialylation. Desialylated platelets are
  recognized by the Ashwell-Morell receptor expressed on hepatocytes, leading to their
  removal from circulation and to the production of TPO, the major growth factor of
  megakaryocytes. In the bone marrow there is an autoimmune response against megakaryocytes
  that express similar GP as platelets and are thus recognized by antiplatelet antibodies
  and exposed to CDC and ADCP. Of note, bone marrow also represents a niche for autoreactive
  plasma cells. CD8 cytotoxic T cells can mediate cytotoxicity against platelets;
  however, due to the necessity of a close cell contact, this phenomenon probably
  takes place in the spleen rather than in the blood. Moreover, there is a recruitment
  of CTL into the bone marrow where they participate to the immune response against
  megakaryocytes. Overall, the autoimmune response is favored by a loss of tolerance,
  supported by a deficiency of Tregs in the spleen, the blood and the bone marrow.
