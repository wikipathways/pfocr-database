caption: Multifaceted involvement of GSK-3 in promoting MDD neuropathology. Several
  bidirectional signaling pathways work cooperatively to elevate GSK-3 activity in
  MDD. Such processes, initiating from the DAMP-mediated activation of the TLR4, include
  the heightened production of inflammatory cytokines from NF-κB and STAT3 with subsequent
  suppression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant factors from Nrf2 and
  CREB. Imbalanced cytokine production results in modified cellular differentiation
  of T helper cells into pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cell variants, with synchronous
  reductions to the proliferation of Th2 cells and Tregs. Inflammatory cytokines TNF-α,
  IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ stimulate IDO to metabolize TRP into KYN which is further
  metabolized into QUIN and KYNA. Downstream effects of IDO activation include reduced
  5-HT and α7nAChR signaling, and enhanced NMDA and IFN-γ signaling, collectively
  inhibiting PI3K and Akt, and disinhibiting GSK-3, which subsequently inhibits the
  action of insulin. Positive regulation (red arrows) and negative regulation (blue
  arrows) of each pathway and/or process are shown. Changes in the overall activity
  of these pathways compared to normal conditions are represented by the solid arrows
  (increased activity) and dotted arrows (decreased activity). α7nAChR, α7 nicotinic
