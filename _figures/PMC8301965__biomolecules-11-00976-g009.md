caption: The effect of Centipeda minima extract (CMX) on hair growth. (A) Wnt activation
  and related signal pathways. The above figure shows CMX as a major effector of the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In the absence of the Wnt ligand, the levels of
  β-catenin are low in the cytoplasm. However, when the Wnt ligand binds to frizzled
  (FZDR), LRP5/6 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6), and Axin
  disruption complexes, β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm, migrates into the
  nucleus, interacts with the TCF transcription factor, and activates the target genes,
  such as Wnt5a/FZDR/VEGF. Additionally, CMX enhances ERK activation and the expression
  of growth factors, such as VEGF and IGF-1, in the extracellular medium. (B) Effect
  of CMX on anagen stimulation. The activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  promotes anagen induction.
