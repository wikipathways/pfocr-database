caption: A. The cAMP/CREB pathway promotes miR-21 transcription via its unique promoter
  located in the intron of Tmem49. The mature miR-21 inhibits PDCD4 activity resulting
  in reduced apoptosis of cystic epithelial cells. miR-21 also inhibits PPARa mediated
  oxidative phosphorylation. RG-012 is an anti-miR that inhibits miR-21 activity.
  B. The miR-17 miRNA family is derived from the miR-17~92 and two other paralogous
  miRNA clusters. c-Myc promotes the transcription of the miR-17~92 cluster. The miR-17
  family consists of miR-17, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a, miR-106b and miR-93. These
  miRNAs have the same seed sequence and directly inhibit PKD1, PKD2, and PPARa. RGLS4326
  is an anti-miR drug that inhibits the miR-17 family.
