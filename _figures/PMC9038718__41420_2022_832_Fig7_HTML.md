caption: LINC00858 can recruit the transcription factor RAD21, which in turn binds
  to the PCNP promoter to promote PCNP transcription and expression, thereby activating
  the STAT3/5 signaling pathway, promoting the proliferation, migration, and invasion
  of colon cancer cells, inhibiting their apoptosis, and ultimately promoting colon
  cancer progression.
