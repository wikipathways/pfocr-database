caption: Summary figure of Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 regulation in the kidney. Salt-inducible
  kinases (SIKs) sequester CRTC2 associated with 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasm
  through phosphorylation of CRTC2. PTH signaling cascade activates Cyp27b1 expression
  (A) in part by PKA inactivation of SIKs, which allows nuclear translocation of unphosphorylated
  CRTC2 to complex with CBP and phosphorylated CREB to induce Cyp27b1 expression (green
  up arrow) through the M1 and M21(a–c) enhancers. SIK inhibition by SK-124 allows
  translocation of CRTC2 without apparent activation of the PKA pathway or increases
  of pCREB and CBP to activate Cyp27b1. 1,25(OH)2D3 acts through the VDR and RXR binding
  at the M1 and M21(a–c) enhancers to suppress Cyp27b1 (red down arrow). SRC1 and
  SRC3 are involved in PTH/SIK activation, whereas SRC1 is involved in 1,25(OH)2D3
  and FGF23 suppression of Cyp27b1. CRTC2 is also increased on the genome by 1,25(OH)2D3
  through an unknown mechanism. FGF23 signaling through the FGFR/Klotho (Kl) membrane
  receptor leads to suppression of Cyp27b1 through an unknown transcription factor
  (??) or signaling cascade. For Cyp24a1 expression, 1,25(OH)2D3 and FGF23 signaling
  uses SRC1, SRC3, and CRTC2 signaling for activation. PTH/SIK signaling suppresses
  Cyp24a1 expression (B). Enhancers −21 kb to −32 kb, DS1. enhancers −35 kb to −37
  kb, DS2. CBP, CREB-binding protein; CRTC2, CREB-regulated transcription coactivator;
  DS, DownStream region; 1,25(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; pCREB, phosphorylated
  (p-133) CREB; PTH, parathyroid hormone; RXR, retinoid X receptor; VDR, vitamin D
  receptor.
