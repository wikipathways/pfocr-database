caption: 'Metabolic network of BC in Komagataeibacter xilynus E25. Sugars are metabolized
  through the pentoses phosphate pathway (PPP) to Glc-6-P, while glycolysis is not
  a relevant pathway in Komagataeibacter species due to the lack of phosphofructokinase.
  Glucose is partially oxidized in the periplasm to obtain reductor power. In the
  case of K. xylinus E25, the oxidation product is gluconic acid, although the final
  product is species-dependent. Ethanol is dehydrogenized to acetate by ADH1, an ADH2
  inner-membrane-bound enzyme, and directed to Glc-6-P by the tricarboxylic acid cycle
  (TCA) and gluconeogenesis (GNG) pathways. Glc-6-P is isomerized to Glc-1-P by phosphoglucomutase
  (PGM) and is subsequently transformed to UDP-Glc by UTP–Glc-1-P uridylyltransferase
  (UGPT). Upon activation by c-di-GMP of BcsA, UDP-Glc units are polymerized into
  nascent glucan chains coupled with its translocation to the periplasm by means of
  cellulose synthase subunits BcsA (A) and BcsB (B). BcsC (C) is then involved in
  the arrangement of the nascent chains, and BcsD (D) forms the pore to export the
  nanofibrils. The main metabolic pathways, TCA, GNG, and PPP, are indicated in green.
  The pathway leading to BC synthesis is indicated in blue. Key enzymes, phosphoglucoisomerase
  (PGI), phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), PGM, and UGPT are indicated.
