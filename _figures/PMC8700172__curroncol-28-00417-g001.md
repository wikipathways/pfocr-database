caption: Dual role of CCN proteins in breast cancer. This schematic diagram illustrates
  that CCN1 initiate breast tumor by modulating αV integrin proteins and Rac1-NOX
  complex formation. CCN1 proliferate the tumor via αV and extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), CCN2 via interleukin11, bone morphogenetic protein-9 (BMP-9), CCN3
  via epidermal growth factor (EGF) and CCN4 via N-Myc downstream regulated 1 (NDRG1).
  CCN1, CCN2, CCN3, CCN4 can upregulate matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), transforming
  growth factor beta (TGFβ), Ca oscillation and RANKL/OPG ratio, N-cadherin, snail
  and β-catenin proteins, respectively. They can also down-regulate protease-activated
  receptor (PAR), interleukin 11 and BMP-9, cell adhesion, E-cadherin respectively,
  and metastasize the tumor to distant organs. CCN1 can inhibit tumor growth by upregulating
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF), CCN3 by binding with TGFβ, CCN5 by upregulating homeobox
  D10 pathway, p27Kip1 and downregulating twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1), microRNA
  10b (miR-10b), epithelial–mesenchymal transition transcription (EMT transcription),
  CCN6 by downregulating E-cadherin expression, IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor
  type 1 receptor) signaling, BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4)/TAK1(transforming
  growth factor-β-activated kinase 1)/p38.
