caption: Molecular mechanism of the relationship between candidate circRNAs/mRNAs
  and GDM. (A) CBLB can inhibit LCK and ZAP70 expression levels by ubiquitination,
  thus exerting negative feedback regulation on T-cell receptor activation; (B) ITPR3
  can encode IP3R in response to IP3-mediated Ca2+ release and promote the activation
  of the T cell receptor signaling pathway; (C, E) circ-ITPR3 and circ-ICAM1 act as
  miRNA sponges for miR-24-3p and miR-874-3p/miR-339-5p, respectively, which induces
  upregulation of the downstream target genes NFKBIA and ICAM1; (D) circ-ITPR3 regulates
  the expression of NFKBIA by recruiting EIF4A3. (F) The adsorption of circ-ICAM1
  to miR-874-3p weakens the anti-apoptotic effect of miR-874-3p, which increases the
  apoptosis of β cells and decreases the release of insulin.
