caption: 'Gold nanoparticle effects on muscle injury: AuNPs promote anti-inflammatory
  and antioxidant effects and interact with different molecules, which synergistically
  reduce oxidative stress. The entry of AuNPs into the cellular environment inhibits
  circulating proinflammatory cytokines, and interactions with CYS-179 of IKK-B and
  subsequent inhibition of the NF-kB pathway and amplification of the inflammatory
  response impact the regulation of oxidative stress.'
