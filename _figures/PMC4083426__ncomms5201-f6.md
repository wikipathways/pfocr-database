caption: 'A complete cycle of lipid II biosynthesis, processing and recycling needs
  to be maintained for coordinated function of the cell division machinery. Structural
  protein MreB (in interaction with RodZ) functionally organizes MurF, MraY and MurG,
  three key components in lipid II biosynthesis, at the septum. The synthesized precursor
  is translocated to the outside and processed by a rudimentary cell wall biosynthesis/cell
  division machinery. DD-CPase activity of AmiA, together with PBP6 and Cpn0902 (NlpD),
  might orchestrate DD-CPase functions in chlamydial cell division. Amidase activity
  of AmiA would play a central role in processing lipid II by releasing the pentapeptide
  side chain to allow for (i) transpeptidation of pentapeptides catalysed by monofunctional
  transpeptidases FtsI and PBP2 and for (ii) regulation of host immune response due
  to blocking of Nod2 sensing. FtsZ as well as transglycosylases, endopeptidases and
  pyrophosphorylases are not found in Chlamydiaceae. Dashed arrows and question marks
  indicate steps of the proposed pathway that remain to be elucidated. (GlcNAc: N-acetylglucosamine;
