caption: 'Mechanism of inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection.SARS-CoV-2 invade
  host cells with angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) receptors present on the cell
  surface membrane. Virus nucleocapsid (N) protein hijack the host interferon type-1
  signalling for the successful replication, transcription, and new viral progeny.
  Infected host cells undergo pyroptosis and release numerous proinflammatory cytokines
  (IL-6, IL-2, and TNFα) DAMPs and PAMPs. These free contents recognized by the neighboring
  cells and proceed with the same process of pyroptosis by using the NLRP3 receptor
  and also trigger the proinflammatory cytokines synthesis by TLR4-Nf-κB pathway.
  Monocytes (transform later into macrophage) and T-lymphocytes are attracted to the
  infected site and promote further pro-inflammation events, resulting in cytokine
  storm damage to the lung and other organs in the body.TLR4: Toll like receptor 4;
