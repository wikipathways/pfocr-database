caption: Overview of the osteoclast signaling network. A schematic representation
  of ITAM-mediated costimulatory signal in the RANKL-induced TRAF6 signaling pathway
  of osteoclast differentiation. In osteoclast precursors, phosphorylation of ITAM
  stimulated by immunoreceptors and RANKL–RANK interaction recruits the Syk family
  kinases, thus activating phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK),
  as well as Tec kinases. They augment the calcium influx required for the activation
  of NFATc1. NFATc1 subsequently migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to its gene
  promoter and triggers an auto-amplifying feedback loop. Calcium signals in osteoclast
  precursors are provided by the ITAM-bearing proteins, Fc receptor γ subunit, and
  its functional analog DNAX activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12). FcRγ-chain is associated
  with the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors, such as osteoclast-associated receptor
  (OSCAR) and paired Ig-like receptor-A (PIR-A). DAP12 is associated with its signaling
  counterpart, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell-2 (TREM-2), and signal-regulatory
  protein β1 (SIRPβ1).
