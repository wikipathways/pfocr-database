caption: 'Schematic representing the significant changes in gene expression in the
  lung of Keap1Δ2–3/Δ2–3;CctCre+ mice compared with Keap1flox/flox mice. Gene interactions
  were identified and described by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems).
  Genes indicated in green were significantly increased in expression in Keap1Δ2–3/Δ2–3;CctCre+
  mice (fold change > 1.5). Genes indicated in red were significantly decreased in
  expression (fold change < 1.5). Genes indicated in white were not different between
  groups (n = 3). The X symbols represent genomic DNA. Abbreviations are as follows.
  ABCC1: ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP) member 1; AOX1: aldehyde oxidase
  1; ARE: antioxidant response element; BACH1: BTB and CNC homology 1; CAT: catalase;
  CBR1: carbonyl reductase 1; EPHX1: epoxide hydrolase 1; GCLC: glutamate-cysteine
  ligase catalytic subunit; GCLM: glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit; GPX2:
  glutathione peroxidase 2; GSR: glutathione reductase; GST: glutathione S-transferase;
  OH-1: heme oxygenase-1; NQO1: NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1; NRF2: nuclear erythroid
  2 p45 related factor-2; PRDX6: peroxiredoxin 6; TXNRD1: thioredoxin reductase 1.'
