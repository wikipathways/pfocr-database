caption: Linking the protein C pathway with EPCR‐ and ICAM‐1‐binding IEs in cerebral
  malaria. (A), Effects of EPCR in the absence of Plasmodium falciparum‐IE. Thrombin
  (Thr) is produced by the interaction between tissue factor (TF) and circulating
  activated factor VII (VIIa) (1). Thrombin initiates the EPCR‐ and thrombomodulin
  (TM)‐facilitated activation of protein C (APC) that then inhibits thrombin production
  (2). APC uses EPCR as a coreceptor for cleavage of proteinase‐activated receptor
  1 (PAR‐1). The EPCR‐APC activation of PAR‐1 inhibits the nuclear factor‐κB pathway
  and exerts anti‐inflammatory and anti‐apoptotic activity (3). S1P signaling results
  in decreased endothelial permeability, and S1P production leads to enhancement of
  tight junctions and protection of endothelial barrier integrity (4). Angiopoetin‐1
  (Ang1) produced in response to the APC‐PAR‐1 interaction decreases Weibel‐Palade
  body (WPB) exocytosis by occupying Tie2 (5). (B), The impact of infected erythrocytes
  expressing EPCR‐bound PfEMP1 on the surface. The IE‐EPCR interaction activates endothelial
  cells to release pro‐inflammatory cytokines (IL‐1, TNFα) that induce shedding of
  EPCR and TM from the endothelial surface and increases expression of ICAM‐1 (6).
  The EPCR‐IE interaction results in reduced levels of APC and increased thrombin
  generation with fibrin deposition (7). Increased levels of thrombin shift the PAR‐1
  response toward activation of the RhoA and NFκB with increased surface expression
  of ICAM‐1 on the endothelial cell (8). The shift in the PAR‐1 response inhibits
  S1P release resulting in loss of tight junctions, and compromises endothelial barrier
  function by causing localized vascular leaks (9). A reduction in Ang‐1 levels increases
  WPB exocytosis via Tie2 and production of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and Ang2 (10).
  Increased levels of Ang‐2 further increase WPB exocytosis and contribute to the
  loss of endothelial barrier integrity and leakage (11). Platelets become activated
  by thrombin and cytokines, which leads to production of platelet microvesicles (12).
  Thrombin and activated platelets combine to form thrombi (13). Strings of vWF and
  activated platelets form complexes, which like thrombi impair the cerebral circulation.
  (C), The increase in ICAM‐1 (in panel B) allows IE expressing PfEMP1 with a shared
  DBLβ ICAM‐1 motif to adhere to the brain endothelium. A large proportion of the
  ICAM‐1‐adhering IEs might initially bind EPCR via their CIDRα1 domains
