caption: Intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis involves proapoptotic BCL-2 family members
  (e.g. BAX or BAK) located in the mitochondrial outer membrane promoting mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeability (MOMP), cytochrome c release, caspase activation and
  apoptosis. Cytochrome c binds APAF1, and in an ATP-dependent process, the multimeric
  apoptosome is formed. Procaspase 9 binds to the apoptosome, gets cleaved and activated,
  and then activates caspase 3 . Members of the IAP family including XIAP negatively
  regulate caspase activation and they can be inactivated by SMAC. Anti-apoptotic
  members of the BCL-2 family (e.g. BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL1, Bcl-w, A1) inhibit the proapoptotic
  BCL-2 family members (e.g. BAX and BAK). BH3-only proteins such as BIM, BAD, BID,
  PUMA and NOXA can inhibit MCL1. It is important to note that within the intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway, mitochondrial permeabilization represents the point of commitment
  to cell death (irrespective of caspase activity). The extrinsic apoptosis pathway
  is depicted at the cell membrane as a trimeric TNF family receptor (Fas-R, TRAIL-R1,
  TRAIL-R2, TNF-R1, TNF-R2) that is bound by the respective ligand with proteins FADD
  and caspase 8 recruited to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Caspase
  8 or 10 activation at the DISC results in Bid cleavage which provides cross-talk
  to the mitochondria in Type II cells which amplifies the death signal at the level
  of cytochrome c leading to apoptosis. c-FLIP binds to caspase 8 and prevents its
  activation. Prototypical growth factor activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
  are shown in the cell membrane as dimeric proteins (e.g. members of the ERBB family
  such as EGFR, Her2, ERBB3) with downstream events involving PI3K and Akt activation.
  The RAS-MAPK pathway is also depicted. These pro-survival pathways also promote
  cell proliferation and negatively impact on the intrinsic cell death pathway, in
  part, through phosphorylation of BCL-2 family members. TNF and TRAIL receptors can
  activate NFkB which transcriptionally activates anti-apoptotic genes in the nucleus
  thereby attenuating cell death and promoting cell survival. Immune mechanisms can
  activate cell death through the extrinsic pathway, e.g. through TRAIL produced by
  Natural Killer (NK) cells in response to Interferon action, or through the blockade
  of cell death ligands, e.g. PD-L1. Immune cells such as cytotoxic T-cells or NK
  cells also produce granzyme which is a serine protease that induces apoptosis in
  target cells such as cancer cells. A protein called perforin forms pores in target
  cells to mediate granzyme-induced cell death. Various other components of the tumor
  microenvironment including stroma, fibroblasts and physical factors can impact cell
  death and cell survival pathways in ways that impact on drug responses. Drugs targeting
  endothelial cells can deprive tumor cells of nutrients leading to cell death. DNA
  damage response (e.g. those involving checkpoint kinases such as ATM/ATR, Chk1/Chk2)
  and cell stress response pathways (e.g. the integrated tress response leading to
  ATF4 and CHOP activation) ultimately activate proapoptotic genes that induce cell
  death, in addition to p53. Among the transcribed genes following p53 activation,
  Bax, Puma, Noxa, DR5, and FasL are noteworthy, but it should also be noted that
  many kinase inhibitors ultimately signal transcriptional activation of Bim. Additional
  cellular processes (e.g. autophagy, anoikis, ferroptosis, regulated necrosis) can
  cross-talk with apoptosis signaling pathways and are impacted by cancer therapeutics
  including those used in combinations with proapoptotic agents.
