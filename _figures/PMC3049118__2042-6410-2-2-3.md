caption: Endocrine system development and function genes increase in the spleen of
  CVB3 infected males at 12 h pi. Male and female BALB/c mice were inoculated intraperitoneally
  with 103 plaque forming units of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) or phosphate buffered
  saline on day 0 and microarray was conducted on individual spleens at 12 h post
  infection (pi) (five/group). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of microarray data that
  had not been corrected for multiple comparisons revealed that the top gene network
  in males involved endocrine system development and function (Network 1). Red and
  green represents genes significantly up- or down-regulated in CVB3 infected males
  compared to infected females, respectively.

  cardiovascular disease and heart failure in male mice.
