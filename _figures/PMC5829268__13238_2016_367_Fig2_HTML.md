caption: Schematic demonstration of TCR signaling. T cells recognize pMHC complexes
  through the TCR-CD3 cluster. Several classes of proteins are then recruited to the
  plasma membrane by the activated receptors and participate in signal propagation.
  Phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) cleaves molecules of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol
  bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The
  interaction of IP3 with its receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum up-regulates
  the level of Ca2+ in the cytosol, further activating the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin.
  NFAT, as a nuclear factor of activated T cells, is regulated by the calcium pathway.
  DAG is primarily involved in the activation of the Ras/Erk pathway. T cells are
  activated though these signaling pathways, releasing IFN-γ, Granzyme B, IL-2, and
  so on
