caption: Network model describing association of hyperactivated mTOR signaling with
  developmental and morphological defects in forebrains. Node colors represent up-
  (red) and down-regulation (green) of the corresponding genes (center color) and
  proteins (boundary color) in TSC1 CKO samples compared to WT. The color bar denotes
  the gradient of log2-fold-changes between TSC1 CKO and WT. Edges represent protein-protein
  interactions (gray) collected from the five interactome databases (Materials and
  Methods) and activations (arrows) and inhibition (inhibition symbols) obtained from
  the KEGG pathway database. Solid and dotted lines indicate direct and indirect activation/inhibition,
  respectively. Plasma membranes are denoted in blue.
