caption: DNA-PKcs, ATM, and ATR provide genome maintenance at different stages of
  neural development. Genome stability is maintained during neural development by
  independent functions of key DNA damage-response kinases that integrate the maintenance
  of genome stability. DNA-PKcs, ATM, and ATR can function independently at different
  stages of neural development to regulate cell cycle control, apoptosis, and DNA
  repair after genome damage. The available pathways for DNA DSB repair change as
  cells differentiate, with NHEJ becoming the main pathway for repair of this lesion
  in nonproliferating cells (i.e., those that are differentiated and mature). HR is
  operative in cycling cells as it requires a sister chromatid present in the S and
  G2/M phase of the cell cycle as a repair template. Although this schema outlines
  independent protein kinase functions relevant to the current study, multiple additional
  roles for theses kinases (not indicated), especially for ATM, have been established.
  Notwithstanding this, it is apparent that each kinase has separate independent roles
  linked to the proliferative and differentiation status of the nervous system.
