caption: 'The stress response includes the activation of two endocrine systems: the
  hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The
  final mediators of the stress response are cortisol and catecholamines (adrenaline
  and noradrenaline) secreted by the adrenal cortex and medulla respectively. SNS
  signalling also occurs via nerves. Fig 1b. Stress regulation of tumour initiation.
  Reported stress effects on the hallmarks of cancer proposed by Hanahan and Weinberg(,).
  Fig 1c. Proposed mechanisms of glucocorticoids and catecholamines on tumour initiation.
  The adrenergic pathway mediates the effect of catecholamines by binding the β2-adrenoceptor
  and activating into adenylyl cyclase which converts ATP in cAMP. cAMP activates
  two major effectors, protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange factor directly regulated
  by cAMP (EPAC) respectively leading to the activation of CREB and AP-1, transcription
  factors that modulate gene expression. Cortisol activates the stress pathway mediated
  by glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). The binding of glucocorticoids to GRs results
  in the translocation of the complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it modulates
  gene expression. Stress-regulated processes include important molecular mechanisms
  such as proliferation, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage and repair that might contribute
  to cancer initiation. Arrows indicate up/down regulation. Fig 1d. Stress effects
  on DNA damage response Glucocorticoids bind to the GR, induce ROS/RNS and activate
  the DNA Damage Response (DDR). Two key signal transducing kinases are ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) which are primarily
  involved in the responses to DSB’s or stalled replication, respectively. ATM and
  ATR activation leads to phosphorylation of effector kinases, facilitating cell cycle
  arrest via cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition, DNA damage repair and apoptosis,
  through phosphorylation of substrates like p53 and BRCA1. Stress hormones also affect
  DNA repair by disrupting the signalling pathways mediated by RAD51 and BRCA1, contributing
  to DNA damage accumulation. The unliganded GR can directly interact and positively
  regulate activity on the BRCA1 promoter. Binding of glucocorticoids negates this
  positive effect, reducing promoter activity.'
