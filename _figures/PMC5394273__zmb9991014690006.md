caption: Proposed model for the regulation of integrin α5β1-mediated cell migration
  by N-glycosylation. (Left) Integrin α5β1 may form a complex with several receptors
  (e.g., syndecan-4), which may trigger active α5β1 internalization and the turnover
  of FA to provide the appropriate cell-substrate adhesiveness for efficient cell
  migration. (Right) However, in the case of the α5 mutant lacking N-glycosylation
  on sites 1 and 2, the cells exhibit increased active α5β1 expression on the cell
  surface and enhanced cell adhesion signaling as a result of its decreased ability
  to associate with related proteins, which results in the suppression of cell migration.
  The present study provides new insights into the concept that modest cell adhesion
  is best for cell migration (). The solid arrows indicate a normal signal pathway
  in integrin α5β1-mediated cell migration, while the dotted arrows indicate that
  these events are aberrant.
