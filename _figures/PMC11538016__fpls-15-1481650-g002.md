caption: Model of CLE signaling in plant-microbe interactions. (A) Model of systemic
  signals mediated by CLE signaling in legume-rhizobium interactions. The transcription
  factors NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) and NIN-LIKE PROTEINs (NLPs) induce CLE gene expression
  in response to nodulation and high nitrogen conditions, respectively. Mature CLE
  peptides are post-translationally modified by HPATs LjPRENTY or MtRDN1 and translocate
  to the shoot via xylem, where the cognate receptors recognize the mature peptides.
  The miR2111 translocates from the shoot to the root via phloem and suppresses excessive
  nodulation by downregulating TOO MUCH LOVEs (TMLs) expression. (B) Model of systemic
  signals mediated by CLE signaling in plant-AM fungi interactions. AM colonization
  and high phosphate conditions induce the accumulation of CLE peptides, which are
  post-translationally modified by RDN1 and translocated to the shoot, where the cognate
  receptors recognize the mature CLE peptides. Strigolactones (SLs) and NUCLEAR FACTOR-YA
  transcription factors (NF-YAs) accumulation is suppressed through yet unknown long-distance
  signals translocating from the shoot to the root downstream of the CLE peptides
  perception, thereby suppressing additional AM symbiosis. (C) Model of local signal
  mediated by CLE peptide mimics in M. truncatula. AM fungi produce CLE mimics that
  inhibit primary root growth partially dependent on CLV2. The AM-CLE mimics also
  induce more AM colonization probably due to their induction effect of lateral root
  formation. (D) Model of systemic signal mediated by CLE signaling in plant and root-knot
  nematode interaction in Arabidopsis. The CLE3, which is upregulated in root-knot
  nematode-induced galls, regulates gall formation in a shoot-expressed CLV1-dependent
  manner, presumably via SUCROSE-PROTON SYMTORTER 2 (SUC2)-regulated sucrose translocation
  from the shoot to the root. (E) Model of local signal mediated by CLE peptide mimics
  in plant-cyst nematode interaction in Arabidopsis. Mature CLE mimics are secreted
  to the apoplast via the host ER-Golgi network. The host receptors recognize the
  mimics and induce expression of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 4 (WOX4) and HOMEOBOX GENE
  8 (AtHB8) which regulate procambium activity and vascular formation, thereby supporting
  cynsytium formation. Dashed lines indicate putative or indirect pathways. Figure
