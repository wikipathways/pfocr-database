caption: These pathways are reviewed in detail in refs. [, ]. (A) RIG-I binds HCV
  RNA, resulting in a change in RIG-I conformation and the activation of E3 ubiquitin
  ligases (yellow shapes). Ubiquitinated RIG-I may activate MAVS, which forms prion-like
  aggregates that recruit additional ubiquitin ligases. Activated MAVS forms prion-like
  aggregates that recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligases TRAF2/5/6 and TRAF3. The ubiquitin
  ligases catalyze the production of K63 polyubiquitin chains and recruitment of enzymes
  that activate the downstream IRF3 and NF-κB pathways. The NS3/4A protease of HCV
  can disable this pathway by cleaving MAVS near its transmembrane domain. ISG15,
  possibly induced by HCV RNA-stimulated PKR, may inhibit one or more ubiquitination
  steps. RNF135, ring finger protein 135; TRADD, TNFR type 1-associated death domain;
  NEMO, NF-κB essential modifier; IKK, IκB kinase. (B) TLR3 recognizes dsRNA within
  endosomal compartments and signals via the adaptor, TRIF, which recruits ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzymes, including TRAF3 and -6. These synthesize K63 polyubiquitin, which recruits
  enzymes that activate the IRF3 and NF-κB transcription factors. The NS3-4A protease
  of HCV can disable TLR3 signaling by cleaving TRIF. PELI-1, protein pellino homolog
  1; TAK, TGF β-activated kinase; TAB, TAK-binding protein.
