caption: Thiol redox homeostasis in microglia. Cysteine for GSH is imported as cystine
  via the plasma membrane xCT exchanger. GSH is oxidized to GSSG during GSH peroxidase
  (GPx)‐catalysed reduction of H2O2 in cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. GSSG
  is substrate for GSH reductase (GR) that replenishes the GSH pool. Thioredoxin reductase
  (TrxR) reduces sulphenic acid derivatives of free thiol groups in proteins by coupling
  to oxidation of thioredoxin (Trx‐(SH)2). Alternatively, oxidized protein thiols
  may be S‐glutathionylated by GSH, followed by reduction by glutaredoxin reductase
  (GrxR). The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) supplies NADPH for reduction of GSSG
  and oxidized thioredoxin (Trx‐SS). Grx‐(SH)2, reduced glutaredoxin; Grx‐SSG‐SH,
  oxidized glutaredoxin.
