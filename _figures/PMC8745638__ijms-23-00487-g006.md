caption: Summary of the swarming regulation by the QseEF-GlmY pathway involving expression
  of rcsB, flhDC and cheA. The sensor kinase QseE senses specific signals and transfers
  phosphoryl group to response regulator QseF. Then, QseF activates expression of
  GlmY, followed by cheA activation and rcsB inhibition. RcsB downregulation and CheA
  upregulation facilitate flagellum production and swarmer cell differentiation, respectively,
  thereby enhancing swarming motility. QseG could help activation of QseEF and unknown
  factor X facilitates GlmY expression. GlmY may interact with flhDC and modulate
  its expression. In addition, QseF could affect flhDC expression in a GlmY-independent
  way. Arrow, positive effect; line with a vertical bar, negative effect; dotted line,
  direct effect needed to be investigated.
