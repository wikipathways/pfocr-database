caption: Central carbon metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is rewired
  in a cell-autonomous manner by oncogenic KRAS signaling and in a cell-extrinsic
  manner via interaction with host stromal cells. Key enzymes that are upregulated
  by oncogenic KRAS are indicated with an asterisk. (Glucose metabolism, shown in
  red) Glucose is preferentially used for anabolic processes (anabolic glucose metabolism)
  in PDAC. This is mediated by the upregulation of key enzymes involved in those processes.
  Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) upregulation increases the glucose uptake, which fuels
  glycolysis and branching anabolic pathways. These include the hexosamine biosynthesis
  pathway (HBP), which produces precursors for glycosylation, and the non-oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway (non-oxPPP), which produces ribose for nucleotide biosynthesis.
  (Glutamine metabolism, shown in blue) Glutamine is a key substrate that is used
  to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and maintain redox balance in PDAC, which
  is mediated by a pathway distinct from all other types of cancers. (PSC-derived
  alanine, shown in green) As shown above, glucose and glutamine are primarily used
  for anabolic pathways and redox maintenance in PDAC. To supplement the TCA cycle,
  PDAC cells utilize alanine that is released from pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)
  in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In response to stimuli from PDAC (unknown),
  PSCs secrete alanine through SLC1A4 in an autophagy-dependent manner. PDAC cells
  upregulate SLC38A2 to uptake PSC-derived alanine, which then fuels the TCA cycle
  and is used to produce macromolecules, including free fatty acids (FFA). Ac-CoA,
  acetyl coenzyme A; Asp, asparagine; αKG, α-ketoglutarate; Cit, citrate; Mal, malate;
