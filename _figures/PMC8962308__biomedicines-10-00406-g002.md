caption: VIP and PACAP receptor-mediated signalling pathways. PAC1 and VPAC receptors
  are preferentially coupled to Gαs, leading to activation of adenylate cyclase (AC),
  subsequent cAMP production, and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA may in
  turn activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). These three class B
  receptors can also activate the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway after coupling to
  Gαi, Gαq, or Gα16 and stimulate calcium levels and protein kinase C (PKC). Released
  Gβγ can activate PLC and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) pathways, and Ca2+
  entry into the cell through receptor-operated Ca2+ ion channels. PAC1 and VPAC receptors
  may also activate phospholipase D (PLD) through the ADP-ribosylation factor- (ARF)
  or a PKC-dependent mechanism. cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signalling
  was also demonstrated following activation by kinases acting downstream of PAC1
  and VPAC receptors, such as PKA, CamK (Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase),
  and ERK. Internalized receptors may also activate G protein-independent signalling
  pathways, as seen for PAC1 and activation of MAPK through a β-arrestins-dependent
  mechanism and for PI3K/Akt.
