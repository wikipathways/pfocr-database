caption: (A) Several molecular features in the cell body of an oxidatively stressed
  neuron. Acrolein and HNE are endogenous by-products of membrane lipid peroxidation
  that develop as a consequence of oxidative stress (a). These type-2 alkenes can
  form adducts with key sulfhydryl groups of the Keap1–Nrf2 complex (b). This promotes
  dissociation of this complex and subsequent nuclear translocation of Nrf2 that specifically
  targets genes with ARE or EpRE, within their promoter regions. These genes encode
  a subset of drug metabolizing enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases (GST) and
  NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and antioxidant molecules such as heme oxygenase
  1 (HO-1) and thioredoxin. The detoxifying and antioxidative stress enzymes/proteins
  generated by the Keap1–Nrf2 pathway offer nerve cell protection from electrophilic
  attack. The relatively fast turnover of resident proteins also works in favor of
  the nerve cell body (c), because adducted and dysfunctional proteins can be quickly
  replaced and the operation of neuroprocesses maintained. (B) The possible toxicological
  events initiated by oxidative stress (a) in the nerve terminal. Thus, although protein
  adduction begins in the cell body (A) and progresses during axonal anterograde transport,
  adduction continues at the nerve terminal and results in a relatively large pool
  of adducted, dysfunctional proteins (b). These abnormal proteins participate in
  broad presynaptic functions; for example, neurotransmitter uptake, release and storage.
  Because turnover is relatively slow at the nerve terminal (b), protein adducts are
  replaced slowly and, therefore, accumulate. The build-up of functionally compromised
  proteins produces a progressive, cumulative neurotoxicity. Nerve terminals are also
  susceptible to electrophilic attack because, in the absence of transcriptional/translational
  capacity, an ARE/EpRE-type reaction cannot be initiated (c). Finally, many of the
  adducted cysteine sites are NO acceptors and, as a consequence, irreversible type-2
  alkene adduction disrupts transient and spatially precise NO signaling. Nerve terminals
  are highly vulnerable to such disruption, because NO signaling modulates numerous
  critical presynaptic processes involved in neurotransmission; for example, the synaptic
  vesicle cycle (d). Decreased neurotransmission will disrupt regional neural circuits
  and higher order networks, which might be responsible for the difficulties in declarative
  memory that characterize AD (; ; ). The peroxidation-based electrophile burdens
  in both nerve terminal and cell body are additive to preexisting type-2 alkene backgrounds
  that result from lifetime environmental exposure; for example, through food—symbolized
  by the French fries; through ambient/occupational exposure—symbolized by the industrial
  plant.
