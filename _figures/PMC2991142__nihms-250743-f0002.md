caption: Models of apoptosis-induced compensatory proliferation in Drosophila. (A)
  Normal developmental apoptosis results in removal of dead cells by phagocytosis.
  An example of a situation in which compensatory proliferation occurs after normal
  developmental apoptosis is when dying enterocytes in the Drosophila midgut stimulate
  intestinal stem cell proliferation. (B) P35 expression renders apoptotic cells unable
  to complete apoptosis. Dronc-dependent p53 and JNK signaling triggers the release
  of signaling cytokines such as Wg and Dpp, which promote hyperplastic overgrowth
  of the affected tissue. (C) Induction of apoptosis in a temporally and spatially
  restricted manner without P35 expression results in tissue regeneration through
  compensatory proliferation. The question marks indicate that it is unclear whether
  JNK signaling operates either in dying cells or regenerating cells. (D) Apoptosis
  induction in differentiating photoreceptor neurons in the Drosophila retina engages
  a different pathway of compensatory proliferation. Dying photoreceptor neurons release
  Hedgehog (Hh) in a manner that requires DrICE and Dcp-1. Hh stimulates cell cycle
  reentry of postmitotic non-neuronal cells.
