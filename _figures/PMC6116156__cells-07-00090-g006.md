caption: Diagram of GABABR-mediated potentiation of mGluR1-TRPC3 signaling pathway
  in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Stimulation of mGluR1 at the dendrites of Purkinje
  cells activates TRPC3 channels to evoke an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC).
  The EPSC is enhanced if GABABRs expressed on the dendrites of the same Purkinje
  cell are activated at the same time. The enhanced EPSC is still mediated by mGluR1-TRPC3
  coupling, presumably through enhancing mGluR1 function and/or increasing the sensitivity
  of TRPC3 to mGluR1 mediated signaling in Purkinje cells.
