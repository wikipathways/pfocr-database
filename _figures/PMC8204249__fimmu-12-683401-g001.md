caption: Mechanisms of JAK2 activation by MPN driver mutations. (A) Normal mechanism
  for receptor activation of the human thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor MPL (myeloproliferative
  leukemia proto-oncogene). MPL, expressed in HSPC and megakaryocytic lineage cells,
  exists in an equilibrium between inactive monomers and active homodimers. Binding
  of the monomeric ligand TPO stabilizes dimer formation, allowing phosphorylation
  of the receptor by dimeric JAK2 tyrosine kinase. This step initiates intracellular
  signaling downstream of active JAK2. The active receptor-kinase holocomplex is subject
  to inhibition by several inhibitor molecules, notably SOCS (suppressor of cytokine
  signaling) family proteins, tyrosine phosphatases, and the adaptor protein SH2B3
  (also known as LNK, lymphocyte linker protein). Mutations in genes encoding these
  various inhibitory molecules are rare driver mutations in MPNs, which lead to JAK2
  hyperactivation by removal of physiologic inhibition. (B) Activation of JAK2 signaling
  by mutant CALR. The single-pass transmembrane protein CALR (calreticulin) is a calcium-binding
  chaperone protein that normally recycles between plasma and intracellular membranes
  in the secretory pathway. Mutated CALR acquires a neomorphic C-terminus (depicted
  as striped), which is capable of binding to and dimerizing MPL, consequently producing
  signaling-active MPL homodimers, which recruit and activate JAK2, in the absence
  of TPO binding. CALR mutations in MPN are therefore hypothesized to have similar
  effects to activating MPL W515L/K mutations, which are present in roughly 10% of
  ET and MF patients. (C) Effect of the JAK2 V617F mutation. JAK2 (Janus kinase),
  depicted as the ancient Roman god Janus (sculpture in the Vatican Museum, Rome),
  contains homologous kinase and pseudokinase domains, the pseudokinase being inhibitory
  to the kinase. V617F mutation in the pseudokinase domain inactivates the inhibition,
  producing a constitutively active (autophosphorylated) kinase. (D) Direct activation
  of JAK/STAT signaling by active JAK2. Mutant JAK2 (typically V617F) dimerizes MPL
  and other cytokine receptors, rendering the receptor active even in absence of a
  bound ligand. The active receptor-bound JAK2 phosphorylates STAT3 and STAT5 homodimers,
  which then translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription. Unlike MPL and
  CALR mutations, JAK2 mutations enable constitutive JAK2 activity even in cells that
  do not express MPL. Mutant JAK2 has been shown to promote epigenetic changes and
  increase the potential for unrepaired DNA damage. Active JAK2 collaterally activates
  MAP kinase (MAPK) and PI3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways independently of STAT3
  and STAT5.
