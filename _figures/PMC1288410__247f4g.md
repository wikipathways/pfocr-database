caption: Model of possible signal transduction mechanisms generating cAMP in relaxin-stimulated
  cells. Conventionally, the relaxin receptor, LGR7, would be expected to stimulate
  adenylcyclase (AC) via a Gs-protein intermediate. However, considerable pharmacological
  evidence supports an alternative pathway involving a tyrosine kinase (TK) cascade
  (probably employing a mitogen-activated protein kinase) to inhibit a specific phosphodiesterase
  (PDE), thereby causing an effective upregulation of cAMP. (Reproduced with permission
