caption: Different pathways of interaction of F. nucleatum with epithelial cells.
  (1), FadA binding to E-cadherin activates β-catenin signaling, leads to cell proliferation,
  oncogenic, and inflammatory responses. (2), FAD-I can induce hBD2 expression via
  both TLR-1/2 and TLR-2/6. LPS and cell extracts of F. nucleatum can also increase
  production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. (3), F. nucleatum binds to
  CD46 which results in the overexpression of MMP-9. (4), F. nucleatum triggers the
  expression of MMP-9 and MMP-13 over the p38 signaling pathway, which causes invasion
  into the epithelial cell. Activation of the extraregular regulated protein kinases
  (ERK) signaling pathway augments the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1α levels. F.
  nucleatum infection-triggered inflammatory response activates the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  which is enhanced by NLRX1. (5), Stimulation by F. nucleatum leads to upregulation
  of ADAM8 expression which is involved in inflammation and essential for osteoclastogenesis.
