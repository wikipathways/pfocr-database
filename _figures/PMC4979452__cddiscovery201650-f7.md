caption: Cell adhesion. Focal adhesions are complexes through which signals are transmitted
  to extracellular matrix (ECM) and interacting cells. Connection between focal adhesions
  and ECM is realized through subcellular structures, including integrins that bind
  to extracellular proteins. The intracellular domain of integrin binds to the cytoskeleton
  via adapter proteins. Other intracellular proteins associate with this complex.
  Adherens junctions are subapical structures that function as mediators of cell窶田ell
  adhesion. They have a crucial role as sensors of extracellular stimuli. Cadherins
  are principally responsible for cell窶田ell adhesion. The extracellular domain of
  cadherin forms complexes with the extracellular domains of cadherin on neighboring
  cells. The cytoplasmic domain of cadherin associates with catenins, which provide
  anchorage to the actin cytoskeleton. Tight junctions are areas of two cells forming
  an impermeable barrier. They are composed of sealing strands, each of which is formed
  from a row of transmembrane proteins embedded in both plasma membranes, with extracellular
  domains joining one another directly. Although different proteins are present, the
  major are claudins and occludins. These associate with different membrane proteins
  that anchor the strands to the actin cytoskeleton. Gap junctions are transmembrane
  channels that connect the cytoplasm of two cells, allowing various molecules to
  directly pass. Each single channel comprises two hemichannels composed by connexin
  proteins. The cytoplasmic domain of connexins binds to ZO-1, allowing the association
  between the gap and tight junctions. Desmosomes are structures specialized for cell-to-cell
  adhesion, arranged on the sides of plasma membrane and linking surface proteins
  to intracellular keratin filaments. The inner dense plaque proteins are attached
  to intermediate filaments. Pathway objects and links are described separately in
  .
