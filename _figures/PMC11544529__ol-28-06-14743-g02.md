caption: 'Role of DUBs in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, p53 and TGF-β pathways in urologic
  cancers. RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway: RAS proteins with GTPase activity are activated
  by upstream RTKS, and activated RAS activates RAF. Activated RAF further activates
  MEK, which in turn activates ERK, the sole downstream substrate. Finally, the activated
  ERK enters the nucleus and initiates a series of physiological and biochemical reactions.
  USP9X knockdown upregulates the ERK signaling pathway, thereby further promoting
  cancer cell invasion. These findings validate the effectiveness of USP9X as a tumor
  suppressor; however, the substrates of USP9X require further investigation. The
  overexpression of USP19 notably decreases ERK levels, whereas USP19 knockdown increases
  ERK phosphorylation, thereby promoting RCC cell proliferation. However, the underlying
  mechanisms remain unclear. Downregulation of USP39 markedly inhibits the phosphorylation
  of ERK at the Thr202/Tyr204 site, thereby preventing activation of the MAPK pathway.
  p53 pathway: When cells suffer DNA damage, p53 is activated, further preventing
  cell proliferation and initiating apoptosis. By deubiquitinating MDM2, USP2a critically
  controls the p53 pathway, thereby elevating the intracellular levels of MDM2 and
  subsequently downregulating p53. Similarly, USP7 enhances the stability and activation
  of p53 through the deubiquitination of MDM2. Mechanistically, USP28 deubiquitinates
  and stabilizes p53 in BCa cells. However, due to the limited association studies
  on p53 and USP28, the underlying mechanisms remain to be further explored. TGF-β
  pathway: Upon conjugation with a TGF-β activator, activated TGF-β binds to TGF-βRII
  and TGF-βRI to phosphorylate transcription factors by forming a tetrameric complex.
  Smads 3 and 2, Smad complex DNA-binding cofactors, regulate gene expression by recruiting
  transcription factors. USP, ubiquitin-specific protease; RAF, rapidly accelerated
