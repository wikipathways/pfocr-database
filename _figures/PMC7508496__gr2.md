  and TGF-β1 bind to distinct type II receptors that form complexes of specific type
  I serine-threonine kinase receptors. BMP-7 binds specifically to activin-like kinase
  (ALK)-3 and ALK-6 receptors, whereas TGF-β1 binds to the ALK-5 receptor. The complexes
  trigger the initiation of intracellular signal streams mediated by Smad proteins.
  BMP-7 phosphorylates RSmads 1, 5, and 8, whereas TGF-β1 activates RSmads 2 and 3.
  Smad4 acts as a partner to facilitate translocation of the activated RSmads into
  the nucleus. The translocated heteromeric complex involving RSmads 2 and 3 modulates
  profibrotic genes, promoting the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts
  such as α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition,
  and enhancing the deposition of collagen. Similarly, upon activation by exogenous
  BMP-7, the Smad1/5/8 complex with Smad4, translocates into the nucleus and blocks
  the nuclear accumulation of Smad3 and thereby TGF-β1 action. This phosphorylation
  of Smad 1/5/8 by BMP-7 results in the transcription of target genes that oppose
  the fibrogenic effects induced by TGF-β/Smad 2/3 signaling. At physiological concentrations,
  Smad6 appears to inhibit BMP signaling by interacting with BMP type I receptors
  and Smad7 inhibits TGF-β/activin signaling by interaction with TGF-β/activin type
  I receptors, which suggests that the principal functions of Smad6 and Smad7 regulate
  the BMP or TGF-β/activin pathways, respectively. Moreover, Smad7 suppresses fibrosis
  by altering TGF-β/Smad3-regulated microRNAs. Abbreviations as in .'
