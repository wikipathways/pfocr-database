caption: Conditions within the kidney that are conducive to C activation. The C cascade
  is activated by distinct mechanisms at various ultrastructural locations within
  the kidney. Immune-complexes can deposit in the mesangium and at different locations
  within the glomerular capillary wall. In some diseases, autoantibodies bind to specific
  renal antigens. Other conditions in the kidney that favor C activation are increased
  concentrations of C proteins in the efferent vessels, low pH, increased local concentrations
  of C proteins due to production by tubular epithelial cells, and high concentrations
  of ammonia which can activate the alternative pathway. The glomerular basement membrane
  does not express C regulatory proteins, although factor H controls alternative pathway
  activation on the glomerular basement membrane. The apical surface of tubular epithelial
  cells also does not express C regulatory proteins, and alternative pathway proteins
  may be activated at this location in proteinuric conditions. EC, endothelial cell;
  PO, podocyte; fB, factor B; fD, factor D.
