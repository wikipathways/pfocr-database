caption: 'The structure and formation mechanism of KL-la, KD-la and Kce. The formation
  of these chemical structural isomers of KL-la, KD-la and Kce are produced through
  two pathways: glycolysis and the glyoxalase cycle. During glycolysis, a series of
  enzymatic reactions transpire within the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell. Glucose
  undergoes a step-by-step degradation through a series of intermediate reactions,
  culminating in the production of lactate (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). The lactate
  exists in two stereoisomeric forms: L-lactate [with (S) configuration] and D-lactate
  [with (R) configuration]. KL-la is induced by glycolysis-derived L-lactate, which
  involves the transfer of an L-lactyl group from an L-lactyl-CoA to a lysine residue
  on a target protein, which is regulated by the writer p300 and eraser HDAC3 (Zhang
  et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2024). KD-la is formed by an uncatalyzed reaction involving
  LGSH generation through the glyoxalase cycle pathway, as detailed by Gaffney and
  colleagues (Gaffney et al., 2020). Kce, another lysine lactylation isomer, is one
  of the MGO adducts (Khadha et al., 2020; Kulkarni and Brookes, 2020). Designed and
  created by Wenjuan Zhao and Jiayi Xin'
