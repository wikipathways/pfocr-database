caption: 'Antitumor effects mediated by CBD on TNBC and ER+ breast cancer. (A) In
  TNBC, CBD decreases cell proliferation by activating TRPV1 and PPAR, through the
  inhibition of cyclin D1 and mTOR, promoting apoptosis, which is also caused by autophagy
  through the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress, leading to the inhibition
  of AKT and mTOR signaling. The inhibition of EGFR decreases cell survival, through
  the inhibition of either AKT or NF-kB, and downregulation of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling
  pathway, which decreases the metastatic potential directly or through the inhibition
  of Id-1. The latter can also be promoted by ROS. (B) In ER+ breast tumors, CBD,
  through the activation of PPAR, induces inhibition of mTOR and cyclin D1, causing
  apoptosis and a reduction in cell survival. CBD can also induce apoptosis through
  the activation of TRPV1 via endoplasmic reticulum stress. CBD inhibits aromatase
  and decreases its protein levels, downregulates ERα and upregulates ERβ. D1: cyclin
