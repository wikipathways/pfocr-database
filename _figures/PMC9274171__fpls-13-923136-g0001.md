caption: Regulation of leaf senescence by classical and peptide hormones. IPT and
  APT1 participate in CK biosynthesis and catabolism, respectively. AHK2/3/4, ARR2,
  and CDF6, signaling components of CK, delay leaf senescence. CWINV (cell-wall invertase)
  delays senescence via regulating sink-source relations. YUC6 delays leaf senescence
  by increasing auxin biosynthesis, while ARF2 and SAUR36/49 promote leaf senescence
  by transmitting auxin signal. ANT, a downstream component of ARF2, postpones senescence
  phenotype. DELLA proteins delay processes of GA-induced leaf senescence via inhibiting
  functions of various WRKYs. ACS is involved in ethylene biosynthesis. ETR1, one
  receptor of ethylene signaling pathway, is involved in ethylene-induced leaf senescence.
  Ethylene promotes leaf senescence through EIN2-EIN3-miR164-ORE1 pathway or several
  EIN2 downstream components, including NAP, ORS1, and ANAC019/047/055. SL accelerates
  leaf senescence via functions of MAX2/ORE9. NAP can elevate ABA biosynthesis via
  inducing AAO3 expression, and ABA-NAP-SAG113 pathway promotes leaf senescence. The
  receptors of ABA, PYLs and the downstream TFs, ABF2/3/4 and ABI5 all promote ABA-triggered
  leaf senescence. LOXs promote leaf senescence by increasing JA content under stress
  conditions. JA promotes senescence via signaling pathway relating to COI1, JAZs,
  and MYC2/3/4, with increased expression of SAGs and enhanced ROS. WHY1 and several
  WRKYs promote SA content through elevating expression of SID2, a key synthase for
  SA biosynthesis. S3H and S5H catalyze SA to decline activated form of SA. SA promotes
  leaf senescence dependent on NPR1 and PAD4, associated with ROS. Peptide hormones
  including CLE42/41/44, CLE14, and PSK delay leaf senescence. CLE42/41/44 function
  redundantly to delay senescence via antagonizing with ethylene pathway. CLE14 is
  induced by high salinity and drought stresses and reduces ROS level via transcriptional
  activation of JUB1, a NAC TF. PSK may be perceived by its receptor PSKRs to contribute
  to ROS scavenging. In addition, GA, ethylene, SL, and ABA are also associated with
  regulation of a series of SAGs expression. DET2 contributes to BR biosynthesis and
  BAT1 inactivates BR. BR accelerates leaf senescence through signaling transduction
  involving positive regulators, BRI1 and BES1. Hormones including ethylene, SL, ABA,
  JA, and SA play significant roles in integrating environmental signals into the
  regulation of leaf senescence. Hormones presented in green ellipses including CK,
  auxin, GA, and mentioned peptides delay leaf senescence, whereas ethylene, SL, ABA,
  JA, SA, and BR in orange ellipses promote leaf senescence, according to phenotypic
  changes caused by exogenous application. SAGs, senescence-associated genes; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species.
