caption: Pathway of tetrapyrrole synthesis in higher  plants, showing the major end
  products (boxed) and relevant  intermediates and enzymes. In plants, algae, and
  most bacteria, the  first committed precursor ALA is synthesized from glutamate
  in the C5  pathway in three steps. However, in rhizobial species (as well as in  certain
  other bacteria, animals, and fungi) ALA is synthesized in a  single step by ALA
  synthase (dotted line). Urogen, Uroporphyrinogen.
