  between the plastid and the ER occurs among different plant species []. A portion
  of C16:0-ACP, C18:0-ACP, and C18:1-ACP pool can be incorporated into phosphatidylglycerol
  (PG) and galactolipids in the plastid. A portion of the acyl-CoA moieties can be
  incorporated into triacylglycerol (TAG, the major lipid fraction in plant seed oils)
  biosynthesis in the seed via the Kennedy pathway. GmFAD3 genes are differentially
  expressed during seed development or cold temperature exposure []. The GmFAD7/8

  signaling []. GmSACPD-C is the nodule specific isoforms as shown earlier [].
