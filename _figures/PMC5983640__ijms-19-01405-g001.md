caption: 'P62-interacting partners to activate different signaling pathways for cellular
  functions: (A) P62 has multiple domains, such as a PB1 domain, a ZZ-type zinc finger
  domain, a TRAF6-binding (TB) domain, an LC3-interacting region (LIR), KIR domain,
  and a ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA). PB1 domain plays an important role for
  self and hetero-oligomerization of p62 by binding with other PB1 containing protein,
  such as aPKC, ERK, and NBR1. P62 interacts with the RIP at ZZ zinc finger region,
  and TRAF6 at TB domain, which regulates NF-κB activation. P62 binds with LC3 by
  the LIR, and Keap1 by the KIR domain. The C-terminal UBA domain of p62 associates
  with ubiquitin; (B) P62 stimulates the oligomerization of aPKC and interaction with
  MEKK3 and caspase-8 leading to the enhancement of NF-κB activation. The LIR domain
  of p62 binds with LC3 to activate autophagy. Its KIR domain interacts through Keap1
  to activate Nrf2 pathway that regulates oxidative stress.'
