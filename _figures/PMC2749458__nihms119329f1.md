caption: 11β-HSD is 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. 11ß-HSD type 1 (mainly located
  in liver, adipose tissue and brain) catalyses the reduction of inert cortisone to
  active cortisol; 11ß-HSD type 2 oxidizes active cortisol to inert cortisone in the
  kidney. 5α- and 5β -reductase are the rate limiting enzymes in the conversions of
  cortisol to 5α-tetrahydrocortisol (THF) and 5β-THF, respectively, largely occurring
  in liver, but also the brain. 5β-reductase is also rate limiting in the conversion
  of cortisone to tetrahydrocortisone (THE).
