caption: (A) Schematic of viral RNA recognition and antiviral signal activation by
  RIG-I and MDA5. Both receptors utilize MAVS on mitochondria (or peroxisome) for
  activation of the downstream signaling pathway. This review focuses on the interactions
  between the CARD domains of RIG-IMDA5 and MAVS. See (B) for details. (B) Antiviral
  signal activation requires monomer-to-filament transition of MAVS CARD, which in
  turn requires homo-oligomerization of RIG-I/MDA5 2CARDs. There are at least two
  mutually non-exclusive mechanisms that induce 2CARD oligomerization; ubiquitin-mediated
  and filament-induced mechanisms.
