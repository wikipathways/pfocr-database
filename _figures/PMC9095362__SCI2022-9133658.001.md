caption: CSC-Exos are involved in cancer cell proliferation. Exosomes secreted from
  p53-mutated lung cancer cells promote cancer cells proliferation by mediating the
  RCP/DGKα receptor cycling pathway. The production of cancer stem cell-derived exosomes
  (CSC-Exos) induced by mutated TP53, and these CSC-Exos can regulate the expression
  levels of podocalyxin and promote cancer cell growth. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
  cell-derived exosomes carrying miR-21 promote the proliferation of HCC cells by
  inhibiting the expression of PTENp1 and PTEN. Exosomes derived from non-small-cell
  lung cancer (NSCLC) cells carry miR-25 to reduce the expression of the PTEN, PDCD4,
  and RECK in NSCLC cells, leading to the growth of cancer cells. Medulloblastoma-derived
  exosomal miRNAs such as miR-181a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7b-5p promote the proliferation
  of cancer cells via the Ras/MAPK pathway. Medulloblastoma (MB) cell-derived exosomal
  miRNAs such as miR-181a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7b-5p promote the proliferation
  and invasion of cancer cells via the Ras/MAPK pathway. Icotinib-resistant human
  NSCLC (HCC827) cells produce exosomes carrying oncogenic MET mRNAs that mediate
  NSCLC progression by upregulating alpha-actinin 4 (ACTN4).
