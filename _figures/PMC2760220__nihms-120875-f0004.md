caption: 'Reconstructed pathways of l-amino acids biosynthesis in C. acetobutylicum
  in view of the incomplete TCA cycle. The diagram assumes l-glutamate biosynthesis
  from pyruvate, rather than through ammonia assimilation, which requires an intracellular
  l-glutamate pool. The following pathways and sub-categories are highlighted within
  the broadly defined pathway of amino acids biosynthesis. The links to carbohydrate
  metabolism, pyruvate and glucose-6-phosphate (which are linked through glycolysis)
  are shown in red and green, respectively. The incomplete TCA cycle (light yellow)
  contains separators (broad dashed lines) to show locations of missing conventional
  TCA cycle enzymes. l-amino acids synthesized directly from pyruvate, oxaloacetate
  or malate precursors are shown in dark blue. Other TCA cycle l-amino acid precursors
  (2-oxoglutarate, succinyl-CoA and succinate) are connected to oxaloacetate, malate
  and fumarate through the urea cycle (shown in light blue). Shown in purple are l-amino
  acids, which are (i) synthesized from 2-oxoglutarate or l-glutamate, (ii) require
  the 2-oxoglutarate/l-glutamate interconversion during a processing step or (iii)
  require a succinyl-transferase during synthesis. Pathways leading to the biosynthesis
  of aromatic l-amino acids and l-histidine are shown in orange. ORFs of C. acetobutylicum
  encoding required enzymes of a particular pathway are given. Gene names separated
  by commas designate sequential processing steps. A slash (/) separator identifies
  genes encoding enzymes capable of parallel operation. Pathways involving a large
  number of genes are labeled in the figure as Lists. The corresponding genes for
  these pathways are given below. List 1: CAC3169/CAC3176/CAC3652, CAC0091, CAC3170/CAC3604,
