caption: Proposed model for the role of ET in defense responses during L. theobromae-induced
  peach gummosis. The inoculation of L. theobromae onto peach shoots dramatically
  induces ET production. Exogenous ET represses the JA pathway by downregulating OPR
  expression but increases salicylic acid (SA) levels by upregulating PAL expression.
  On the other hand, ET treatment transcriptionally increases UDP-sugar metabolism,
  transport (GONST, URGT) and cell wall degradation (PG, PEL, PE, EXP), leading to
  excessive polysaccharide accumulation and cell damage due to gum outflow. EIL1,
  a key transcription factor of ethylene signaling, directly binds to promoters of
  the UDP-sugar biosynthetic genes UXS1a, UXE, RGP and MPI and transactivates their
  expression. Solid brown dots represent the gum biosynthesized in the Golgi being
  transported through the endomembrane system and out of the cells. The arrows and
  blunt-head lines indicate activation and suppression, respectively.
