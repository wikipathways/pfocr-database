caption: Targeting several key enzymes or proteins (green ellipses) are potential
  to re-sensitize the resistant tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents (purple font).
  Targets marked with green ellipses involve multiple metabolic pathways, including
  glutaminolysis, transport and glycolysis of glucose, pentose phosphate pathway,
  fatty acid oxidation, pyruvate dehydrogenation, and production of polyamine. The
  drugs that can be metabolically regulated are highlighted with purple font. 6PGD,
  6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; CDDP, cisplatin; CoA, coenzyme A; CPT, carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase; ENO, enolase; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLS,
  glutaminase; GLUT1, glucose transporter protein 1; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A;
  ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase.
