caption: 'AKT stimulates metabolic changes that contribute to anabolic metabolism
  by directly phosphorylating key metabolic enzymes. AKT promotes plasma membrane
  localization of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and increased glucose uptake by directly
  phosphorylating and inhibiting TXNIP, a protein that promotes endocytosis of GLUT1.
  AKT signaling also promotes retention and metabolic activation of the newly acquired
  glucose by activating HK2, which phosphorylates glucose to generate glucose 6-phosphate,
  which cannot be transported out of the cell by GLUT1 and is the entry metabolite
  for the hexosamine pathway, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and glycolysis.
  AKT enhances flux into glycolysis through phosphorylation and activation of PFKFB2,
  which produces fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric activator of the rate-limiting
  glycolytic enzyme PFK1, which commits the glucose-derived carbon to glycolysis.
  Both the oxidative and non-oxidative PPP, which branch off of glycolytic intermediates,
  generate ribose-5-phosphate that serves as the sugar moiety for purine and pyrimidine
  nucleotides. AKT phosphorylates and activates the non-oxidative PPP enzyme TKT,
  thereby contributing to ribose-5-phosphate production for nucleotides. AKT also
  phosphorylates and increases the activity of NADK, which catalyses the phosphorylation
  of NAD+ to generate NADP+, a limiting substrate for the oxidative PPP, which generates
  two molecules of the reducing cofactor NADPH through its oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate.
  Downstream of AKT, mTORC1 activation acutely stimulates de novo pyrimidine synthesis
  through an S6K-dependent phosphorylation of the pyrimidine synthesis enzyme CAD.
  Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, is either converted to lactate by LDH,
  which regenerates NAD+ needed for sustained glycolysis, or can enter the mitochondria
  and TCA cycle for oxidation initiated by the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex,
  the activity of which can be inhibited by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). AKT
  phosphorylates PDK and promotes its inhibition of PDH, thus favouring the LDH reaction
  [Note: this phosphorylation is believed to occur within the mitochondria]. AKT directly
  regulates lipid synthesis through phosphorylation of ACLY, which generates acetyl-CoA
  in cytosol from the TCA cycle-derived citrate.TXNIP, thioredoxin-interacting protein;
