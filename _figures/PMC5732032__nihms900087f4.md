caption: (a) Hyperactivated EGFR signaling activities converge on the elevation of
  c-MYC to promote anaerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) in GBM cells. This effect
  can be suppressed by dual inhibition of PI3K and mTOR inhibitor(s). (b) Amplified
  and hyperactivated EGFR can also stimulate thousands of distal cis-regulatory elements
  called enhancers to promote a cancer-driving gene expression program. Small molecule
  compound such as JQ1 can intercept this epigenomic reprogramming activity by inactivating
  an enhancer-binding transcription cofactor BRD4. (c) In the brain, hyperactivated
  EGFR increases cholesterol update in GBM cells. LXR agonist like LXR-623 suppresses
  cholesterol update by activating an endogenous cholesterol homeostasis pathway involving
  IDOL, which degrades LDLR, and ABCA1, which transports cholesterol out of the cell.
