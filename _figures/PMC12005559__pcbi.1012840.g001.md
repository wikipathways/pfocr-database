caption: The various components of the biosynthetic mevalonate pathway system are
  color-coded by type, as indicated. Metabolic reactions, transport steps, and the
  production of mRNAs and proteins are shown as solid lines, while regulatory signals,
  representing feedback inhibition (red) and modulation of enzyme activity [15], are
  given as dotted lines; mRNAs whose transcription is affected by dioxin, are indicated
  by boxes outlined in red. The key transcription factor SREBP binds to sterol regulatory
  elements (SREs) in the promoter regions of its target genes. It controls the activity
  of mevalonate pathway via these target genes, among which HMG CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme
  A) reductase is considered the rate-limiting step of the pathway, even though control
  of the pathway is distributed. Adapted from [13]
