caption: Signaling pathway of CTLA-4. The dendritic cell identifies antigens in the
  microenvironment and, with the help of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC),
  presents these antigens to inactive T lymphocytes, initiating the activation process
  (A). The first step occurs when the MHC binds to the T-cell receptor (TCR). After
  this binding, surface proteins of the CD80/86 family on dendritic cells bind to
  the CD28 receptor on T lymphocytes, promoting increased cell proliferation, enhancing
  cytokine production, and combating tumor melanocytes. During activation, CTLA-4,
  initially stored in vesicles within the cytoplasm, is released, becomes a receptor,
  and binds with higher affinity than CD28 to the CD80/86 family proteins (B). This
  binding leads to the inactivation and apoptosis of T lymphocytes, allowing tumor
  melanocytes to survive, as lymphocytes do not target them, blocking T-lymphocyte
  activation from the binding of melanocytes to antigen-presenting cells (C). By binding
  to tumor melanocytes, the dendritic cell prevents the antigen from being presented
  to T lymphocytes, thus inhibiting T-lymphocyte activation. As a result, the tumor
  melanocyte evades the immune system’s response
