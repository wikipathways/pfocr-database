caption: PUFAs are key actors in the regulation of endocannabinoid system. Endocannabinoids
  are signaling lipids produced from membrane long-chain fatty acid in response to
  neuronal activity that bind the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) CB1R. The two
  principal eCBs, AEA and 2-AG, are AA-derived metabolites while DHEA derived from
  the DHA. eCBs are released into the synaptic cleft and then bind the CB1R on the
  presynaptic neuron. Activation of CB1R inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity leading
  to a subsequent reduction in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) cascade,
  augmentation of potassium channels, and inhibition of subsequent calcium influx
  via calcium channels. Consequently, the activation of the CB1R inhibits the release
  of both excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmitters from the
  presynaptic neuron and decreases synaptic plasticity. The stimulation of CB1R by
  CB agonists (THC, WIN55,212-2, and CP-55940) or eCBs also activate MAPK signaling
  pathway. Both eCB-dependent plasticity and CB1R-dependent signaling pathway in brain
  areas involved in mood-regulation are altered in mice that chronically fed an omega-3
  deficient diet.
