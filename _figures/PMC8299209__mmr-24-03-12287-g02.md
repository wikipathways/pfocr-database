caption: TLR pathway, NLR pathway and their effects on the WNT/β-catenin signaling.
  (A) Depiction of TLR-MyD88 independent pathway with terminal IFN-1β secretion. Intracellular
  PAMP-dsRNA in endosomes is recognized by TLR3, and IKKε/TBK1 are recruited to phosphorylate
  IRF3 via TRIF and TRAF3. IRF3 is translocated to the nucleus to induce IFN-1β expression.
  (B) Overview of TLR-MyD88-dependent pathway inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  such as pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Upon extracellular binding of PAMPs, TLRs recruit
  MyD88 to cytoplasmic TIR. MyD88 associates with IRAKs, in which IRAK4 phosphorylates
  IRAK1 and 2 and promotes their association with TRAF6, and this in-turn recruits
  and activates TAK1. TAK1 then activates the IKK complex. The subsequent IκBα degradation
  frees NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus for target gene expression. TAK1 can also
  mediate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression through MKKs/MAPK cascades. (C) Diagram
  indicating the positive and negative influence of inflammatory pathways on WNT signaling.
  TLRs/MyD88 inhibits the binding of WNT ligands to the LRP5/6 Fz receptor complex.
  Phosphorylated TAK1 activates NLK, which separates β-catenin/TCF-LEF from DNA. In
  addition, activated NLR could also inhibit WNT through the same TAK1/NLK pathway
  following RIP2 attachment and phosphorylation. Positively, the combination of MyD88
  triggers the anti-inflammatory pathway achieved through PI3K/Akt activation. Akt
  enhances β-catenin level and expression of WNT target genes. Alternatively, activated
  NLRs interact with WNT receptors via LYPD6. (D) NLR pathway including the canonical/noncanonical
  inflammasome pathway. Following extracellular PAMP recognition by NLRs, ASC directly
  attaches to NLRs via the PYD domain and pro-caspase-1 via CARD. Inflammasomes self-assemble,
  leading to the cleavage of caspase-1. The activated caspase-1 catalyzes pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18 into functional IL-1β and IL-18. K+ ion channels on the inflammatory
  cell surface are activated by active caspase-1, which results in pore formation
  in the cell membrane. In the noncanonical pathway, caspase-11 activation can directly
  enhance IL-1β and IL-18 release and promote the caspase-1 pathway.
