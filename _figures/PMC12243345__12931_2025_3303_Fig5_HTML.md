caption: Hypoxia and CSE exposure of MH-S cells affects HIF-1α, altering HIF-1 signalling
  and affecting IL-17 signalling, and TNF signalling pathways. The genes that are
  significantly upregulated in these pathways are mainly enriched for the functions
  of inflammation (cytokines and chemokines), glycolysis (LDH, PDK), M1 polarization
  (iNOS), extracellular matrix remodelling (MMPs), and angiogenesis (VEGF). LDH, lactate
  dehydrogenase; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; TNF tumour necrosis factor; VEGF,
  vascular endothelial growth factor
