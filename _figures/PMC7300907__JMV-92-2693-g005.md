caption: Proposed working model of ACE2 during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In the first
  wave of infection, SARS‐CoV‐2 enters host cells through ACE2 and releases its viral
  RNAs, which are subsequently sensed by TLR3 and RIG‐I/MDA‐5. The activation of TLR3
  and RIG‐I/MDA‐5 leads to the activation of innate immune signaling pathways, resulting
  in the production of IFNs and other inflammatory cytokines. Then, ACE2 was upregulated
  by these cytokines through the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of
  transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway or other pathways, which subsequently mediated
  the enhanced entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 into host cells. ACE2, angiotensin‐converting enzyme
  2; IFN, interferon; SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;
  TLR3, Toll‐like receptor 3
