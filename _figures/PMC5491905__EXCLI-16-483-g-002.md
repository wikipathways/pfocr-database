caption: . In the absence of IPC, reactive oxygen species such as superoxide inhibit
  HDACs causing hyperacetylation of HMGB1 in the nucleus. In this form HMBG1 translocates
  to the cytoplasm and eventually enters the extracellular space to coordinate the
  sterile immune response. (1) IPC exerts its cytoprotective effects by decreasing
  the amount of superoxide produced intracellularly, thereby disinhibiting HDACs from
  acting on HMGB1 in the nucleus. HMGB1 is then unable to move into the extracellular
  space to drive immune activation. (2) The decreased amount of HMGB1 in the vasculature
  reduces signaling through the NF-kB pathway, thereby suppressing the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha.
