caption: 'Different biological activities of DCV-derived soluble CPE and sEV-CPE.
  Soluble CPE secreted from high metastatic HCCH cells inds HTR1E receptors on recipient
  HCCH cells and activates ERK-BCL2 signaling pathway to promote survival under hypoxic
  stress. HCCH-derived sEVs that contain CPE are taken up by recipient low metastatic
  HCCL cells to enhance proliferation and invasion. HCCH: hepatocellular carcinoma;
  DCV: dense core vesicles; sEVs: small extracellular vesicles; CPE: carboxypeptidase
