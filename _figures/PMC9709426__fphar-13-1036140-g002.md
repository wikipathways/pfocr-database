caption: The diagram of cell signaling pathways and molecules of ferroptosis in breast
  cancer. SUFU deletion increase the ferroptosis by activated by RSL3 via ACSL4. PKCβII
  activate ACSL4 to induce lipid peroxidation and improves the efficacy of immunotherapy.
  DKK1 inhibit their stem cell properties. Because CSCs are highly sensitive to ferroptosis,
  DKK1 induces SLC7A11 increasing and promote the development of metastase og CSC.
  DMOCPTL inhibit GPX4 to induce ferroptosis by EGR-1. 27HC exposure induce the overexpression
  of GPX4 to inhibit ferroptosis and increase the proliferation and metastasis. The
  upregulation of DDR2 elicits ferroptosis to recurrent breast cancer through the
  Hippo pathway. EMT induce DDR2 upregulation to active ferroptodis by regulating
  YAP/TAZ. GSK-3 β promoting erastin-induced ferroptosis by blocking Nrf2. p53 reduces
  the expression of SLC7A11 by inhibiting H2Bub1. FGFR4 suppress GSH synthesis and
  efflux of Fe2+ through β-catenin/TCF4/SLC7A1 signaling pathway.
