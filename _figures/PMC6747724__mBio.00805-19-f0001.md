caption: Fate of acetyl-CoA in anabolism and catabolism. Acetyl-CoA is either oxidized
  to CO2 in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to generate reducing equivalents and
  ATP/GTP or assimilated into biomass. Two acetyl-CoA assimilation pathways are present
  in bacteria, the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (A) and the glyoxylate cycle (B). Reaction
  balances of the individual pathways are shown on the bottom. Note that the activation
  of acetate to acetyl-CoA requires the hydrolysis of one ATP into AMP and PPi (not
  included in balance). Key reactions of the individual pathways are indicated in
  dashed boxes. Genes encoding the individual enzymes of the EMCP and GC are named
  according to the nomenclature established for Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 and
  Escherichia coli K-12, respectively. The corresponding enzyme names and open reading
  frames in P. denitrificans are listed in .
