caption: MGAT2 has a role in the lipolysis/re-esterification of stored TG in hepatocytes.
  TG synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum begins with glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P)
  from glycolysis or by the phosphorylation of glycerol by glycerol kinase (GK). G3P
  undergoes two successive acylation reactions first producing 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate
  (LPA) and then phosphatidate (PA) which is dephosphorylated to 1,2-diacylglycerol
  (1,2-DG). DGAT catalyzes a third esterification reaction producing TG that is stored
  in cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) and can subsequently be used for VLDL assembly.
  VLDL acquire their TG via the lipolysis/reesterification of preformed TG stored
  in LDs. Lipases hydrolyze LD TG generating 2-monoacylglycerol (2-MG). Monoacylglycerol
  acyltransferase-2 (MGAT2) uses this 2-MG as a substrate producing 1,2-DG and subsequently
  TG, which is utilized for VLDL assembly at the ER. Some glycerol is also likely
  generated from the complete hydrolysis of TG, which can re-enter the glycerol 3-phosphate
  pathway. GPAT, glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase; AGPAT, 1-acylglycerophosphate
  acyltransferase.
