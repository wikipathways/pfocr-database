caption: 'The mechanism of Hippo pathway and the hippo targets of ncRNAs. (A) the
  Hippo pathway is inactivated. YAP and TAZ cannot enter the nucleus and are subsequently
  degraded by the proteasome. (B) the Hippo pathway is activated. YAP/TAZ enters and
  accumulates in the nucleus and promote the transcription of genes. MST1/2: Mammalian
