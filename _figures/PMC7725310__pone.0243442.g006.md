  cortex (cluster a in S7 Fig in ). (G) The uropod. In Dictyostelium, a cGMP-based
  signaling pathway activates the interaction between myosin filaments and pF-actin
  filaments, leading to contraction of the uropod. Pseudopods that extend at a very
  high rate stop prematurely in cells with a very strong uropod (cluster b in S7 Fig
  in ). In mammalian cells the three major components of the cell -pseudopod, cortex
  and uropod- play similar roles as in Dictyostelium, but the excitable system in
  panel E may have other small GTP-proteins such as CDC42, and the uropod in panel
  G is not regulated by cGMP but by the Rho-kinase Rock.
