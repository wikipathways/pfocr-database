caption: The model of various RBPs involved in ABA-related signaling pathway in the
  Arabidopsis seed germination and/or dormancy. All PRBs are showed in pink box, the
  targets of RBP are in yellow box, and the blue boxes are the other components in
  the signaling transduction. All proteins are normal font, and mRNAs are showed with
  italic font. Arrows with lines or dashed lines indicate the proteins and/or genes
  are directly or indirectly regulated by upstream factors, respectively. Lines with
  bars indicate the negative regulation in the signaling. P, phosphate; PP2C, protein
  phosphatase 2C; SnRK2, SNF1-related protein kinases 2; RD22, responsive to dehydration
  22; RAB18, ABA-responsive gene 18; ATAF1, Arabidopsis transcription activation factor
  1; ABI2, the phosphatase ABA Insensitive 2; ABI4, ABA-INSENTIVE 4 (a nuclear transcriptional
  factor); CBF/DREB, C-repeat binding factor/dehydration-responsive element (DRE)
  binding proteins.
