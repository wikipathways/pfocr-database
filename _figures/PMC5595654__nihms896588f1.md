caption: (A) Cones use glutamate (Glu) to signal cone bipolar cells (cBCs) and horizontal
  cells (HCs). The dendrites of cBCs and HCs have both dopamine D1Rs and GABAARs.
  Evidence also suggests that HCs provide a feedforward GABA signal to cBC dendrites
  (shown) and an inhibitory feedback signal to cones (not shown), but the roles of
  these pathways in producing cBC surrounds remain unclear. (B) Model that accounts
  for how both the effectiveness of the GABA feedforward signal to ON-cBC dendrites
  and the strength of ON-cBC surround responses are modulated by gradual changes in
  the ambient (background) light level. As ambient illumination slowly increases during
  the morning, reaching a peak at midday, D1R activation increases, which in turn
  augments intracellular PKA, so that the expression and activity of GABAARs on ON-cBC
  dendrites - including dendritic tips - are enhanced. As a result, the effectiveness
  of the GABAAR-mediated feedforward signal from HC dendrites to ON-cBC dendrites
  increases, enhancing the strength of surround antagonism and activation. Conversely,
  as background illumination slowly decreases during the afternoon and evening, reaching
  darkness at night, D1R activation is reduced. This in turn decreases intracellular
  PKA, substantially lowering GABAAR expression and activity so that ON-cBC surround
  strength is minimal. Experiments and findings in this study primarily address whether
  light/dark regulation of ON-cBC dendritic D1Rs and GABAARs modulates the strength
  of ON-cBC surround light responses.
