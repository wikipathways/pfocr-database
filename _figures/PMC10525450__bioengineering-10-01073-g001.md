caption: 'Astaxanthin biosynthesis pathway and constructed plasmids. (A) Simplification
  of the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway reconstructed in HEK293T cells. Genes involved
  in this pathway are as follows: psy1 gene, phytoene synthase; crtI and crtYB genes,
  phytoene desaturase; lcyb gene, lycopene β-cyclase; crtZ and H.crtZ genes, β-carotene
  hydroxylase; crtW, bkt3, and cbkI genes, β-carotene ketolase; and DGTT1 and DGTT2
  genes, diacylglycerol acyltransferases. The yellow and red background colours indicate
  the sub-pathways of β-carotene and astaxanthin, respectively. Dashed arrows indicate
  that reaction was not successfully completed. The heterologous (exogenous) genes
  and molecules are shown in red. (B–I) illustrate the constructed plasmids utilized
  in this study.'
