caption: Schema of Ang II-induced NFAT activation in cardiac myocytes. In cardiac
  myocytes, stimulation of AT1R induces NFAT activation through Gαq-PLC signaling
  pathway. DAG, generated by PLC activation, directly activates TRPC3 and TRPC6 (TRPC3/C6).
  Activation of TRPC3/C6 causes slow increases in the membrane potential to a positive
  direction (ΔΨ) and concomitantly increases the frequency of spontaneous firing due
  to activation of L-type Ca2+ channel. The Ca2+ influx though L-type Ca2+ channel
  activates calcineurin-NFAT pathway, which leads to hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes.
