caption: 'The efficacy of specific inhibitors (green “+”: active; red “-”, inactive)
  and a potential rational therapeutic approach (blue boxes) are shown for each class
  of BRAF or MEK mutation. In general, the therapeutic approach for each class of
  mutation is based on its classification as an “activator” or “amplifier”, with activators
  requiring targeting downstream of or at the level of the mutation, and with amplifiers
  requiring upstream inhibition in combination with downstream inhibition. The level
  at which the pathway is targeted in each scenario is marked in orange. For MEK mutants,
  upstream inhibition would include RAF inhibition in BRAFV600 cancers or RTK inhibition
  in RAS/BRAF wild type cancers. In some cases, upstream inhibition may be helpful
  even when targeting activator mutations as a means of disrupting adaptive feedback
  reactivation of MAPK signaling, for example as when adding an RTK inhibitor (e.g.,
  anti-EGFR antibodies) in BRAFV600 colorectal cancers (CRC).'
