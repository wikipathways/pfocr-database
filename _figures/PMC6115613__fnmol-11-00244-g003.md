caption: 'p75NTR and TrkB pathways leading to migration and invasion in normal and
  pathological conditions. As described in this figure, several signal pathways are
  preferentially activated in cell invasion and migration processes involving p75NTR
  upon NT activation. From the left to the right: (1) ephrin-B receptor phosphorylate
  Kidins220/ARMS leading to p75NTR/TrkB activation (; ) and increasing their sensitivity
  to BDNF, leading to the activation of MAPkinase signaling pathways (). Ephrin-B
  receptor activation is also linked to STAT3 and RhoA signaling leading to cytoskeleton
  remodeling (; ). (2) In the absence of Kidins220/ARMS, p75NTR/TrkB could interact
  with other scaffold proteins like Par3 (; ). In this context, the BDNF activates
  p75NTR/TrkB leading to AKT pathway activation, but also to Par3 activation (). Activated
  Par3 activates Rac1, which modifies cadherin-11 interaction with catenins leading
  to cytoskeleton remodeling (). (3) In some cases, p75NTR/TrkB also interact with
  sortilin leading to a high sensitivity to proBDNF. ProBDNF/p75NTR/TrkB also activate
  AKT pathway (). (A) Information collected from NCC migration and invasion during
  the development. (B) Information collected from cancer studies (highlighted in blue).
  Orange and blue borders = information related to both situations, NCC and cancer
  cells migration and invasion.'
