caption: 'IRF9 signaling via the JAK–STAT pathway and antagonism by viral proteins.
  Recognition of IFN-α/β by IFNAR2 will trigger heterodimerization to IFNAR1, resulting
  in autophosphorylation of TYK2. Activated TYK2 then phosphorylates the adjacent
  JAK1. STAT2 recruited by activated IFNAR2 will be phosphorylated by JAK1, thus allowing
  docking of STAT1 that in turn gets phosphorylated. The phosphorylated STAT1–STAT2
  heterodimer then dissociates from the IFNARs and forms the ISGF3 complex with IRF9.
  ISGF3 complex is then translocated into the nucleus and bind to the ISRE promoter
  sequence to initiate the transcription of ISGs. IRF9 has been shown to associate
  with STAT2 and shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Also annotated are the
  viral antagonisms directed toward IRF9. HPV16 E7, ReoV T1L μ2, and PBocaV NP1 binds
  to IRF9 and therefore prevents the formation of ISGF3 complex. Meanwhile, SVV ORF63
  directs the proteasomal degradation of IRF9. Abbreviations: HPV16 E7, human papillomavirus
  16 E7; SVV ORF63, simian varicella virus ORF63; ReoV T1L μ2, reovirus T1L μ2; PBocaV
  NP1, porcine bocavirus NP1; IRF9, interferon regulatory factor 9; IFNAR, IFN alpha
  receptor; TYK2, tyrosine kinase 2; JAK-STAT, Janus kinase–signal transducer and
  activator of transcription; ISGF3, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3; ISGs, interferon-stimulated
  genes; ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element.'
