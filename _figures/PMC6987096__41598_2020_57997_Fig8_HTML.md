caption: 'A schematic diagram that depicts platelet-induced estrogen biosynthesis
  in endometriosis. Activated platelets induce the activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway and TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway in endometriotic lesions. The two signaling
  pathways regulate several genes coding for hypoxia and inflammatory molecules, such
  as HIF-1α, COX-2 and VEGF–, which are upregulated after platelets treatment in HESCs.
  Activated platelets induce hypoxia in endometriotic lesions as shown by elevated
  expression of HIF-1α and VEGF. Increased HIF-1α accumulation results in DUSP2 down-regulation,
  which results in prolonged activation of ERK and p38 MAPK and increased COX-2 expression
  in endometriotic stromal cells, as well as increased ERβ expression which can also
  be induced by activated platelets. The COX-2 overexpression leads to increased production
  of PGE2 in endometriosis, further favor E2synthesis in HESCs. High levels of local
  E2 (through ERβ) and PGE2 in turn may further amplify COX-2 expression, which results
  in overexpression of steroidogenic genes, and continuous local production of E2
  and PGE2 in endometriotic tissue. PGE2 increases intracellular cAMP levels via the
  receptors EP2 or EP4. Elevated cAMP upregulates SF-1 and enhances its binding to
  the promoter of steroidogenic genes, as well as PKA activation, resulting in the
  phosphorylation of CREB which facilitates its binding to a cAMP-response element
  (CRE) on the promoter region of the StAR, aromatase or some other steroidogenic
  genes,, and acts as an initiator to unfold the DNA-histone binding and then provides
  space for C/EBP binding to the promoter of these steroidogenic genes. PGE2-induced
  StAR promoter activity appears to be regulated by CREB and C/EBPβ in a cooperative
  manner in endometriotic stromal cells. PGE2 negatively regulates AMPK via the PKA
  signaling pathway, and CREB and related proteins are also the direct downstream
  targets for AMPK. AMPK is crucial for the activation of CREB via phosphorylation
  and there is a negative regulatory role of AMPK in the expression of CREB. CRTC2
  is translocated into the nucleus, where it forms a transcription complex with CREB.
  AMPK can directly phosphorylate CRTC family members. In the absence of AMPK activity,
  CRTC2 is dephosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus and associates with CREB,
  and then increases target gene expression. Activated platelets also inhibit AMPK
  activation via downregulation the phosphorylation level of AMPK in HESCs (Qi et
  al., unpublished data), which can further activate the CREB binding to steroidogenic
  genes in HESCs. In addition, it reported that USF2 binds to the SF-1 promoter, and
  stimulates the expression of SF-1 and its target genes, and recent research has shown
  that FXR competes with CREB in binding the promoter region of CYP19A1, which results
  in the downregulation of aromatase expression. Progesterone induces the expression
  of epithelial HSD17B2 by activating stromal PR-B, which can mediate the formation
  of retinoid acid to bind to the promoter and thus activate HSD17B2. In endometriotic
  tissues, the decreased PR-B expression in stromal cells disrupts the paracrine action
  of progesterone. ERβ suppresses ERα and PR-B, leading to progesterone resistance
  and deficient inactivation of E2 in endometriotic lesions. Abbreviations used: AA:
