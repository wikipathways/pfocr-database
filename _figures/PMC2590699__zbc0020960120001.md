caption: Current model for Okazaki fragment maturation. The main pathway  (thick arrows)
  involves very limited strand displacement by Pol  δ, followed by FEN1 cutting of
  the single nucleotide flap. This process  is iterated until all initiator RNA (iRNA;
  red) is degraded  (Nick Translation). Excessive strand displacement is postulated
  to be  rare (dotted arrows). It is reduced by the Exo activity of Pol  δ (Idling),
  and enhanced by Pol32 or Pif1 (Long Flap  Formation). The processing of long flaps
  requires Dna2. Regression of the  resulting small flaps to the nick position is
  accomplished by FEN1 or the Exo  activity of Pol δ.
