caption: 'Phosphorylation (P) of specific sites in PR couples multiple receptor functions,
  including transcriptional synergy in the presence of steroid hormones and growth
  factors predicted to activate MAPK and/or CDK2, and nuclear import or export (shuttling)
  in response to MAPK activation. Rapid ligand-dependent PR downregulation occurs
  by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway (degradation). 1. Ligand-binding mediates dissociation
  of heat-shock proteins and nuclear accumulation of PR. 2. Nuclear PR mediates gene
  regulation via the classical pathway; phosphorylated PR may recruit regulatory molecules
  that are phosphoproteins, and function in one or more interconnected processes (transcription,
  localization and turnover). 3. PR and growth factors activate MAPKs independently
  via a c-Src kinase-dependent pathway, and this may result in positive regulation
  of PR action via ‘feedback’ regulation (i.e., direct phosphorylation of liganded
  PR or co-activators), occurring in both the absence and presence of steroid hormone
  ligands and on PRE-containing or other PR-regulated gene promoters. 4. Activation
  of MAPKs by PR provides for regulation of gene targets whose promoters do not contain
  PREs and are otherwise independent of PR-transcriptional activities but utilize
  PR-activated MAPKs, such as regulation of the cyclin D1 promoter by ETS factors.
  5. MAPK regulation of PR has been shown to mediate nuclear accumulation/shuttling
  and nuclear export that is coupled to regulation of PR transcriptional events.ER:
  Estrogen receptor; PR: Progesterone receptor.'
