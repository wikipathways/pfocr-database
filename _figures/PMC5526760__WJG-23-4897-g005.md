caption: 'Summary of gene function and epistatic interaction of the IL-10/STAT3 signaling
  pathway in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. In the IL-10 pathway genes, genetic
  variations in IL-10 and STAT3 are associated with adult IBD, and genetic mutations
  identified from IL10RA and IL10RB are associated with pediatric/very early onset
  inflammatory bowel disease (published data). In this study, we found SNP-SNP epistatic
  interaction within the IL-10 gene, between IL10 and IL10RA genes, and between IL10RB
  and HO1 genes. We also found epistatic interaction among three SNPs between the
  two genes IL-10 (two SNPs) and IL10RA, and among the three genes IL-10, IL10RB and
  HO1. Bp: Bonferroni P value.'
