caption: Fe deficiency (−Fe+P) causes a decrease in the expression of bZIP58 that
  is central to controlling the transcription of nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes.
  P limitation under Fe deficiency (−Fe−P) prevents this downregulation of bZIP58
  and induces VTC4. The induction of VTC4 expression requires bZIP58, whose effect
  could be direct or indirect, represented here by “X”. We propose that induction
  of VTC4 increases ascorbic acid in the chloroplast mediated by PHT4;4. We hypothesize
  that the increase of ascorbic acid level prevents ROS accumulation, thus maintaining
  the expression of bZIP58 and its downstream photosynthesis genes and leading to
  the “stay-green” phenotype. The figure was created with BioRender.com.
