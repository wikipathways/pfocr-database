caption: 'Whereas prokaryotic type galactolipids are issued from phosphatidate (PAP)
  synthesized in the chloroplast, formation of eukaryotic type galactolipids is dependent
  on the supply to the envelope of some PC derivatives formed in the ER: either diacylglycerol
  (DAGE) or phosphatidate (PAE). PAP converting PA to DAG is present in the envelope
  but only in the inner membrane. Altogether, a number of lipid transfers noted by
  dashed arrows are important to build plastid membranes. Under phosphate deprivation,
  DGDG formation is stimulated corresponding to activation or stimulation of a part
  of the galactolipid synthesis pathway indicated in red. Under these conditions,
  DGDG is transferred through membrane contact between chloroplast and mitochondria.'
