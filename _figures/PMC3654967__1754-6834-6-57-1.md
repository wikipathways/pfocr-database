caption: Isoprenol and prenol biosynthesis pathway. The heterogenous pathway that
  was introduced into E. coli is indicated by the red line. The black arrow represents
  the MVA upper pathway, the blue arrow represents the MVA lower pathway, and the
  purple arrow represents the isopentenol forming pathway. HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A; HMGS, HMG-CoA synthase; HMGR, HMG-CoA reductase; MK, mevalonate kinase; MKK,
  phosphomevalonate kinase; MVD, mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase; IDI, isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate:dimethylallyl pyrophosphate isomerase.
