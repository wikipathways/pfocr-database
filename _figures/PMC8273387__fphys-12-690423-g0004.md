caption: A working model for induction of cardiomyocyte necroptosis by Cops8 deficiency.
  Loss of function of Cops8/CSN is expected to suppress the CRLs shown in green font,
  which in turn disrupts the respective ubiquitination events and thereby blocks NFκB-mediated
  survival signaling and inhibits the apoptotic pathway via increasing BCL2 and hindering
  the activation of caspase-8 (Casp8), steering the death receptor-triggered pathway
  to the RIPK1–RIPK3-mediated necroptosis. The pathways in the shaded zone are likely
  involved but not directly examined in Cops8-deficient mice. It is hypothesized that
  TFNα comes from autocrinal or paracrinal routes from the myocardium with cardiomyocyte-restricted
  Cops8 knockout (Cops8-CKO). The interrogations that have been completed are marked
  with bold black font. Dotted line denotes a potential link that has not been tested
  yet. Nec-1, necrostatin-1; p-IκBα, phosphorylated IκBα; Psm, proteasomal degradation;
  RIPK3-KO, global knockout of RIPK3; ROS, reactive oxygen species [adopted from Xiao
  et al. ()].
