caption: A schematic diagram of H1N1-induced signaling and inflammatory genes expression.
  Single-strand RNA (ssRNA) generated following H1N1 infection primarily activates
  cellular inflammatory genes via the Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8)-dependent pathway
  to activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and inhibitory κB kinase complex
  (IKKα/β/γ), respectively. Both activating protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κB
  (NFκB) are activated as downstream events of TLR7/8-dependent activation of chemokines
  (including RANTES and MCP-1) production. An arrowhead proposed the possible multiple
  intracellular target sites for ER, DeHE, Evo and/or Rut to inhibit chemokines production
  in H1N1-infected A549 cells. (ER, the ethanol extract of E. rutaecarpa; DeHE, dehydroevodiamine;
  Evo, evodiamine; Rut, rutaecarpine).
