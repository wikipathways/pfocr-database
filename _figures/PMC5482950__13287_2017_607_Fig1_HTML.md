caption: Immunomodulatory properties of craniofacial MSCs. Craniofacial MSCs target
  several subsets of innate and adaptive immune cells, including helper T-lymphocytes
  (Ths), CD8+ T cells, dentritic cells (DCs), macrophages, mast cells, and regulatory
  T-lymphocytes (Treg). These effects may be mediated by soluble factors secreted
  by MSCs, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β),
  nitric oxide (NO), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), or in a cell-cell contact-dependent
  manner, inducing T-cell apoptosis through the Fas/FasL pathway. GM-CSF granulocyte-macrophage
  colony stimulating factor, IFN interferon, IL interleukin
