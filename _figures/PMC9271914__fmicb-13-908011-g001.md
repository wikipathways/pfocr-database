caption: Bile acids (Bas) metabolism and enterohepatic circulation. In the liver,
  primary BAs (CA and CDCA) are synthesized by enzymatic catalysis from cholesterol.
  CYP7A1 initiates the classical synthesis pathway and the ratio of CA/CDCA is regulated
  by CYP8B1. CYP27A1 and CYP7B1 are mainly responsible for the alternative synthesis
  pathway. Then conjugated CA/CDCA with taurine or glycine are excreted across the
  canalicular (apical) membrane into the bile by the BSEP and stored in the gallbladder
  before being released to the duodenum, where primary BAs are transformed into secondary
  BAs by gut microbiota via deconjugation, dehydroxylation, oxidation, desulfation,
  dehydrogenation, and epimerization. Most BAs are reabsorbed in the ileum by the
  ASBT and then connected to the IBABP. After that, BAs are transported to the portal
  vein via OSTα/β and are taken up mainly by NTCP. In enteroendocrine cells, FXR enables
  TGR5 to induce the secretion of GLP-1 in intestinal L-cells. The combination of
  BAs to FXR not only inhibits the FXR-SHP pathway, accelerating lipid synthesis,
  but also induces FGF19 in the liver and ilea, and FGF19 binds to the FGFR4 on the
  hepatocytes, inhibiting BA synthesis. Approximately 5% of BAs are lost in fecal
  excretion. BAs, bile acids; CA, cholic acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; CYP7A1,
