caption: Cellular and physiological responses controlled by higher relative amount
  of p47/p44. Increased expression of p47/p44 in different tissues and circumstances
  leads to diverse outputs. High expression of p44 (mouse homolog of p47) promotes
  differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [] and senescence of several mice
  tissues leading to a premature aging phenotype through hyper-activation of insulin-like
  growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) []. In normal mice brain tissue, p44-induced expression
  of Tau kinases results in hyper-phosphorylation of Tau and neuron deficit and cognitive
  decline []. Although elevated expression of p47 was also reported in neural progenitors
  and in glioblastoma (GBM) samples, the signaling pathway involved is yet unknown
  [].
