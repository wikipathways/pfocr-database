caption: 'Experimental and simulated flux distribution via glycolytic pathways under
  autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions. Brown color shows the flux via Entner–Doudoroff
  pathway, blue color shows the flux via phosphoketolase (PKET) pathway, green color
  indicates the net flux via futile cycle of fructose-1,6 bisphosphatase (FBPas) and
  phosphofructokinase (PFK), red color shows the flux via 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase
  (GND). Index “a” denotes the cases of possible match between experiments and simulations
  if flux via ED-P is not considered in model; flux via ED-P was not considered in
  experimental-based calculations (; ). Index “b” shows the case of simulated result
  being in the confidence interval of experimental value. All data were taken or simulated
  under ambient CO2 condition. (i) lower flux FBPase – PFK (green) under mixotrophic
  conditions is caused by redistribution of carbon flow, i.e., higher flux via EMP-P
  in expense of Calvin-Benson cycle (ii) flux values presented in this figure and  vary
  to some degree because they represent two independent and alternative calculations
  (two best fits). Units of metabolic fluxes: 10– 2 mmol h– 1 gDW– 1.'
