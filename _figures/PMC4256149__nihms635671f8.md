caption: A model of CED-3-activated suppression of AKT signaling by CNT-1 in C. elegans.
  In non-apoptotic cells, some AKT kinases are recruited to the plasma membrane and
  activated by PIP3 to transduce the survival signal. In apoptotic cells, CNT-1 is
  cleaved by activated CED-3 to generate potent phosphoinositide-binding tCNT-1, which
  translocates to the plasma membrane from the cytoplasm. tCNT-1 outcompetes AKT kinases
  for binding to PIP3 and thus displaces and inactivates AKT kinases, leading to loss
  of the survival signal and apoptosis.

  by inhibiting the AKT pathway.
