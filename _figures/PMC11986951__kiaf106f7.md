caption: Possible model for the starch accumulation based on phosphorylation status
  of CmGLG1 and CmGWD in response to target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling. The left
  and right panels of the figure represent potential models of starch degradation
  and accumulation, respectively. The “P” in the background of the yellow circles
  denotes the phosphorylation of the specified amino acid residues. Solid lines indicate
  that the respective proteins are functional, while gray dashed lines indicate that
  the function is absent or reduced. When starch is degraded, CmGWD and CmGLG1 are
  phosphorylated directly or indirectly by the TOR signaling pathway. Consequently,
  CmGWD becomes activated and phosphorylates starch, whereas CmGLG1 becomes inactivated,
  resulting in a reduction in de novo starch synthesis and the promotion of starch
  degradation. Conversely, when TOR is inactivated (e.g. by rapamycin treatment or
  nitrogen deficiency [-N]), phosphorylation of CmGWD and CmGLG1 does not occur. In
  this case, CmGWD becomes inactivated, and CmGLG1 is activated. This leads to a decrease
  in starch phosphorylation and an increase in de novo starch synthesis, thereby promoting
  starch accumulation
