caption: 'Extracellular dimeric TGF-β binds to its transmembrane receptor (TGFβR),
  triggering the transphosphorylation of the receptor. The activated receptor recruits
  and phosphorylates R-Smads, downstream proteins in the TGF-β signaling pathway.
  Activated R-Smads migrate to the nucleus, where they interact with other co-activators,
  forming the transcription complex. Three approaches have been used to disrupt this
  pathway as follows: (1) Monoclonal antibodies with high affinity and neutralizing
  capability against TGF-β. (2) Small molecules that inhibit downstream signaling
  from the receptor to Smads. (3) Antisense oligonucleotides developed against either
  TGF-β or its receptor to impair this signaling pathway'
