caption: 'Overview of the integrative model of autophagy. Schematic describing interactions
  of the four agent types from Figure , expanded by the addition of nutrients. Each
  agent is color-coded; phagophores (PP) in grey, autophagosomes (AP) in red, lysosomes
  (LYS) in yellow and autolysosomes (AL) in purple. Two distinct nutrient-type global
  values are included: bound nutrients (blue) and free nutrients (green). Merging
  arrows represent fusion events between the two agents to form or expand an autolysosome.
  Black arrows represent degradation events. Arrows marked with BAF or ND indicates
  that this pathway is influenced under conditions with BAF or by ND. Black arrows
  represent degradation events.'
