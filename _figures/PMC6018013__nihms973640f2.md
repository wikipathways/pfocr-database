caption: (A) A classical example of GPCR signaling pathway. Receptors, such as ADRB2,
  are in an inactive state until an agonist binds to activate the receptor. The activated
  receptor-G protein complex is formed resulting in GDP to GTP exchange by the G protein
  complex followed by the dissociation of the Gα subunit from the Gβγ dimer. Both
  Gα and Gβγ subunits, in turn, activate downstream effectors. Gαx represents the
  general Gα subunit followed by diagrams for Gα12/13, Gαi, Gαs, and Gαq pathways.
  (B) β-arrestins can function as adaptor/scaffolding molecules activating the ERK
  (MAPK) cascade. GRK phosphorylates the activated receptor recruiting β-arrestin
  to the phosphorylation sites along with Raf, ERK (MAPK), and MEK. This association
  triggers activation of the ERK (MAPK) cascade leading to cytosolic signaling pathways.  were
  adapted from Pierce, et al. [].
