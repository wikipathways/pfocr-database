  due to a significant decrease in serum 17,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP). With
  fish development, ovarian development in cyp17a2 −/− fish showed signs of recovery
  at 180 days after hatching (dah). However, the absence of DHP and cortisol in cyp17a2
  −/− XX fish impaired oocyte maturation and ovulation. Administration of exogenous
  DHP and cortisol successfully restored oocyte maturation, but mature oocytes remained
  entrapped within surrounding follicular cells. B: Cyp17a2 expressed in follicular
  cells catalyzes steroid precursors into DHP, which plays a crucial role in regulating
  oocyte maturation through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. GVBD, germinal vesicle
