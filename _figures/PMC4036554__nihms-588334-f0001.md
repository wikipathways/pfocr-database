caption: Dietary iron (predominantly in the form of ferric iron (Fe3+)) is absorbed
  in the duodenum through the concerted action of a reductase, such as duodenal cytochrome
  b (DCYTB), which produces ferrous iron (Fe2+), and divalent metal transporter 1
  (DMT1). Iron exits the basolateral surface of the enterocyte through the iron efflux
  pump ferroportin, which functions together with the oxidase hephaestin to oxidize
  ferrous iron to form ferric iron, which is loaded onto transferrin (TF). The diferric
  iron transferrin complex (TF–[Fe3+]2) circulates through the bloodstream to deliver
  iron to sites of utilization. Principal among these sites is the bone marrow, where
  iron is used in the synthesis of haemoglobin and red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs circulate
  for approximately 90 days before they are catabolized by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial
  (RE) system. Iron is released from catabolized haem and effluxed out of the macrophage
  through the action of ferroportin, where it is loaded onto TF in the bloodstream,
  in a process termed iron recycling. TF–[Fe3+]2 is also delivered to peripheral tissues
  and the liver, which is the primary organ for the storage of excess iron. Although
  small amounts of iron are lost through desquamation, there is no excretory pathway
  for iron, so levels of iron in the body are primarily regulated at the absorption
  step. Excess iron induces the synthesis of the peptide hormone hepcidin (HP), which
  serves as a master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. HP binds to ferroportin
  and triggers its degradation, inhibiting both delivery of dietary iron through the
  enterocyte and iron recycling through the macrophage. HP is also induced in response
  to inflammatory cytokines and thus contributes to the anaemia of cancer.
