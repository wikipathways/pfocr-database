caption: The regulation of proliferation and of bone-metastasis genes by ERβ1 and
  ERβ2. This figure incorporates data of the genes that were found to be regulated
  by the expression of ERβ1 or ERβ2, together with data of their relative relationships
  from the proprietary software database. A, Model of the antiproliferative circuit
  promoted by ERβ1. The down-regulation of c-Myc, Cyclin E, and p45SKP2 and the up-regulation
  of Cyclin D1 result in an overall inhibition of cell growth. Also shown is the ERβ2-mediated
  up-regulation of c-Myc and p45SKP2, which causes ERβ2 cells to proliferate faster
  than the control cells. B, Pathway diagram showing how ERβ2 regulates factors that
  control osteoblastic and osteolytic activity by up-regulating RUNX2, Twist1, and
  β-catenin, resulting in increased DKK1, which controls the RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin
  (OPG) ratio. In addition, other genes that are either up-regulated or down-regulated
  by ERβ2 may have possible net effects that contribute to ERβ2-mediated effects.
