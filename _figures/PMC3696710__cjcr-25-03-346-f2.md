caption: The different models of Hh signaling pathway activation in cancer. A. Hh-dependent
  Gli activation. Prostate, lung and pancreatic cancer have been shown to depend on
  the presence of Hh ligand. These tumors display constitutively elevated activity
  that is likely to be due to increased ligand (Hhhigh) and Smo (Smohigh) expression;
  B. Hh-independent Gli activation. Ligand-independent tumor growth has been shown
  to arise from loss of Ptch or Sufu repressor function (Ptchloss, Sufuloss) or activating
  mutations in the Hh-effector Smo (Smoact); C. Non-canonical activation. In epithelial
  tumor cells, TGF-β signaling has been shown to activate the transcription of Gli,
  whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) and/or Ras signaling promotes GliA function
  through the kinase cascade. In these models, ligand-dependent, ligend-independent
  and non-canonical activation are characterized by an increase in GliA activity and
  Gli target gene expression. Possible oncogenic routes activated downstream of Hh/Gli
  such as proliferation, and survival, metastasis and stem cell activation are driven
  by (direct) transcriptional stimulation of key regulators of these processes
