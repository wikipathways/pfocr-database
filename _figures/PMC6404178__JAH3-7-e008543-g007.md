caption: 'Statins and prenylation inhibitors in Marfan syndrome aneurysm development:
  hypothesized model. The GTPase Ras is a key regulator of TGF‐β (transforming growth
  factor β)–dependent ERK (extracellular signal‐regulated kinase) signaling. Ras modification
  with the isoprenoids, farnesyl (F‐PP) and geranylgeranyl (GG‐PP) allows membrane
  attachment. TGF‐β signaling through a receptor serine/threonine kinase complex (TGFBR)
  results in Ras activation (Ras‐GTP). In Fbn1 C1039G/+ aortic root/ascending aorta,
  we hypothesize that TGF‐β activates Ras, which triggers ERK signaling. ERK activation
  regulates a wide variety of targets involved in breakdown of the extracellular matrix
  (ECM), including the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). We believe statins indirectly
  reduce TGF‐β–dependent ERK activation by preventing Ras modification with isoprenoids,
  thereby decreasing membrane association. HMG‐CoA, 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl coenzyme
