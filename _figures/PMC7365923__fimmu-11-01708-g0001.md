caption: Artemisinin-family drugs for cytokine storm in COVID-19. The dysregulation
  of the cytokine storm involves mainly APCs. TLR2 and TLR4 locate mainly outside
  macrophages, DCs, and granulocytes. Also, they are expressed within endosomes, play
  a role in recognizing bacteria and viruses. Through MyD88-dependent or TRIF-dependent
  pathway, TLR2 and TLR4 transmit signals for the activation of IRF3 and NF-κB to
  induce the type I interferon and cytokines. Besides, TLR2 leads to the activation
  of AP-1, which is responsible for the transcription of inflammatory cytokines. The
  cytokines target at the naïve T helper cell, to result in the naïve T helper cell
  to differentiate to Th1 cell and Th17 cell, subsequently to secrete the inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, the IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 secreted by monocytes
  and macrophages could activate cytokines receptors (i.e., IL-6R, IL-8R), lead to
  the activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathways and cell migration. The artemisinin-family
  drugs target at a variety of molecules (red and blueness nodes) in the inflammatory
  networks, such as NF-κB, IRF3, ERK (not shown in the figure), and RORγt, which inhibit
  the differentiation of inflammatory cells and the production of cytokines and chemokines.
  IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. It could be secreted by virtually all immune
  cells, including macrophages, DCs, NK cells, T cells, and B cells. At the moment,
  the high concentration of IL-10 in severely ill patients with COVID-19 is a mystery.
  On the one hand, it might play a role in antagonizing the biological function induced
  by IL-6. On the other hand, the high concentration of IL-10 might contribute to
  the lymphocytes exhaustion. AP-1, activating protein-1; CCL, C-C motif chemokine
