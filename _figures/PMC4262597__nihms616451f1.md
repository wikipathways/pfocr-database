caption: Model of cAMP pathways acting during mammalian sperm capacitation. Two different
  sources of cAMP orchestrate signaling pathways in the sperm head (A) and in the
  principal piece (B). In the head, a tmAC increases cAMP levels which act primarily
  on EPAC, leading to the preparation to undergo the acrosome reaction. In the sperm
  flagellum, cAMP is increased through the synergic effect of Ca2+ and HCO3 stimulation
  of sAC. The increased pool of cAMP acts on PKA, as well as on CNG channels and NHE
  channels. These molecules impact directly on the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway
  that correlates to sperm capacitation. See text for details.
