caption: 'Demonstration of integrating fatty acid negative auto-regulation with product-addiction.
  Layer I: CRISPRi based fatty acid negative auto-regulation. The fatty acid inducible
  promoter P(A1R1)x2A3 was used to control the transcription of gRNAs, which were
  used to guide dCas9 to FAS1, FAS2, and FabD. Layer II: End-product addiction. PFdeO-TEF
  is a hybrid promoter, which is composed of FdeR binding site FdeO and the TEF core
  promoter. PConst refers to the constitutive promoter. In the presence of naringenin,
  FdeR bands FdeO site and activates PFdeO-TEF. The expression of LEU2 gene confers
  the leucine-auxotrophic host cell growth in the leucine drop-out medium.'
