caption: Multimodal imaging strategy. (A) Schematic shows the relationship between
  molecular markers expressed in activated mTOR signaling pathway. (B) Distance from
  endoscope to adenoma (arrow) is measured in vivo with gauge (arrowhead) passed through
  the instrument channel. (C) Grid (1 x 1 mm2 squares) is digitally overlaid onto
  the endoscopic image for measuring long and short axes of adenoma (arrow). (D) T1-weighted
  coronal MRI scan (low resolution) identifies anatomic landmarks to localize adenoma,
  defining a window (dashed lines) for axial scans (high resolution). (E) Adenoma
  (arrow) dimensions (a, b, and c) are validated ex vivo with calipers.
