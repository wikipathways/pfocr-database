caption: Model of the PdhR regulon. The whole set of regulatory targets of PdhR obtained
  in this study are aligned along the  E. coli  metabolism pathway. The PdhR targets
  include the genes involved in carbon source catabolism from PDH down to respiratory
  electron transport, lactate degradation, TCA cycle and β-oxidation of fatty acid
  degradation. The genes repressed by PdhR are shown in blue while the genes activated
  by PdhR are shown in red. The PdhR regulon members, ppsA, pykF, lldP, lldD, fumD,
  fadE, fadI and fadJ, were identified in this study.
