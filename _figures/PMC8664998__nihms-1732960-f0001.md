caption: (A) Lipid microdomains enriched in LacCer are binding sites for fungal β-glucan
  and a signaling platform for CR3 recruitment, allowing this receptor to respond
  to non-opsonized pathogenic fungi. LacCer domains trigger a signaling pathway through
  Lyn, PI3K, p38, and PKC, leading to actin polymerization, required for migration,
  phagocytosis, and ROS production. (B) Caveolae is involved in the invasion of C.
  neoformans yeast in HBMEC. CD44 is located in caveolin-1-enriched membranes (Cav-1),
  where it recognizes the fungal hyaluronic acid. The intimate contact between Cav-1
  and actin promotes the fungal internalization by HBMEC. The activation of Rho GTPase
  is correlated with actin remodeling and increased fungal internalization, which
  could be mediated by Cav-1. In addition, yeast extracellular vesicles and the HIV
  gp41 stimulate the clustering of CD44 on Cav-1 domain, increasing binding and invasion
  of C. neoformans yeast. (C) Flotillin domains on phagolysosomal membrane of macrophages
  are affected by melanin from A. fumigatus conidia. In comparison to non-melanized
  conidia (pksP), WT conidia block the release of calcium ions from the phagolysosome
  lumen to the cytoplasm, avoiding the activation of calmodulin (CaM). Conidia melanin
  impairs the formation of flotillin domains on phagolysosomal membranes and reduces
  the recruitment and assembly of V-ATPase and NADPH. (D) Recruitment of CR3, the
  main macrophage receptor for H. capsulatum, to lipid microdomains requires GM1.
  When β-(1,3)-glucans are exposed on the H. capsulatum cell wall the lipid microdomains
  allow the cooperation between CR3 and dectin-1, enhancing the inflammatory signaling
  through Syk, JNK, AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos).
