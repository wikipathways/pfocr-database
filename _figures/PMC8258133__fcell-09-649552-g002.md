caption: Exosomes regulate adipogenic differentiation. miR-450a-5p contained in exosomes
  from rat adipose tissue promotes adipogenesis by inhibiting the expression of WISP2.
  Exosomes secreted by M1 macrophages significantly promote lipid droplet formation
  by up-regulating the expression of PPAR-gamma gene. miR-1246 in FBS secreted exosomes
  inhibits adipogenic differentiation by targeting EBF1. Gastric cancer exosome-delivered
  ciRS-133 promotes adipogenic differentiation by suppressing the functionality of
  miR-133 and promoting PRDM16 expression. Lung tumor cell A549-derived exosomes inhibit
  adipogenic differentiation via TGFβ signaling pathway. miR-92a-3p in K562 cell line
  inhibits adipogenesis of ADSC by reducing C/EBP α expression after transcription.
