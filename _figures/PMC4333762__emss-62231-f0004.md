caption: Hypothetical model of the functions of the peripheral lamina and the nucleoplasmic
  LAP2α-lamin A/C complex in the regulation of the pRb/E2F pathway in non-proliferating
  and proliferating cells. In arrested cells the lamina may tether and stabilize hypophosphorylated
  pRb and serve as platform for efficient PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of phospho-pRb.
  The nucleoplasmic LAP2α-lamin A/C complex activates repressor activity of pRb leading
  to E2F target gene repression. In proliferating cells, ERK may release pRb from
  the lamina, favoring its cdk-mediated phosphorylation. LAP2α-lamin A/C complexes
  dissociate from phospho-Rb, allowing E2F activation and E2F target gene expression.
