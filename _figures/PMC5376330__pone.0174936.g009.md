caption: The schematic shows a summary of our findings in a proposed simplified mechanism
  for the effects of AT-RvD1 on VSMC migration. AT-RvD1 increases cAMP levels at least
  by activating ALX/FPR2; the subsequent activation of PKA interferes with actin polymerization
  by inhibiting VASP (by phosphorylation) and Rac1, and with focal adhesion formation
  by decreasing paxillin localization to the cell leading edge. “R” and “C” represent
  the regulatory and the catalytic subunits of PKA, respectively.
