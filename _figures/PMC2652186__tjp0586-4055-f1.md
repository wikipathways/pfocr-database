caption: During chronic inflammation, decreased tissue perfusion and increased energy
  demand causes hypoxia. This leads to inhibition of hydroxylases (PHD/FIH) and subsequent
  stabilization and transactivation of HIF. Simultaneous activation of the NF-κB pathway
  leads to transcriptional up-regulation of HIF mRNA expression which facilitates
  the activation of HIF signalling.
