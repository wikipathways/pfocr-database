caption: 'A. Common oxidized purines, B. Common oxidized pyrimidines, C. Base excision
  repair pathway in the nucleus: i. 8-oxoguaine is 8oxoguanine glycosylase, OGG1,
  which removes the damaged base and produces a 3′ nick, ii. This intermediate is
  recognized by apurinic endonuclease, APE1 that facilitate OGG1 turnover, and nicks
  the 5′ of the sugar moiety to generate a one base gap, iii. DNA polymerase β, XRCC1
  and PARP1 are recruited to the gap and pol β fills in gap (iv) which is ligated
  close (v) D. Base excision repair in mitochondria. DNA polymerase γ provides gap
  filling and strand displacement synthesis that is trimmed by Exonuclease G (ExoG)
  and ligated by DNA ligase III. Adapted from [, ]'
