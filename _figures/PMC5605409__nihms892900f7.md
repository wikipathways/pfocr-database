caption: 'Interactions between MKK3, MPK1, RBK1, and ROP proteins, combined with the
  altered auxin responsiveness of mutants defective in these signaling components,
  suggests a pathway for modulating of auxin-responsive cell expansion. In this pathway,
  MKK3 phosphorylates and activates MPK1, MPK1 phosphorylates and activates RBK1,
  and RBK1 phosphorylates ROP, likely leading to altered ROP activity. We hypothesize
  four potential mechanisms of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of ROP activity:
  1) Phosphorylated ROP displays altered affinity for RIC effector proteins, leading
  to downstream effects such as altered cytoskeleton organization; 2) ROP phosphorylated
  increases ROP affinity for GDIs, leading to decreased ROP localization at the plasma
  membrane; 3) Phosphorylated ROP displays increased affinity for GAPs, leading to
  an accumulation of the inactive GDP-bound form of ROP proteins; 4) Phosphorylated
  ROP displays decreased affinity for ROP GEFs, leading to an accumulation of the
  inactive GDP-bound form of ROP.'
