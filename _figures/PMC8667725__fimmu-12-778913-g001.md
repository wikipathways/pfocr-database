caption: SARS-CoV-2 and Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) interactions. (A) SARS-CoV-2
  infection is mediated via the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which
  would cause ACE2 downregulation. Subsequent block of Ang II/Ang–(1-7) metabolism
  lead to the high levels of Ang II production through ACE upregulation. The imbalanced
  Ang II/Ang 1–7 causes the suppression of AT2 and Mas receptors with anti-inflammatory
  properties. In contrast, Ang II and its receptor AT1R activations induce pro-inflammatory
  effects, fibrosis, and thrombosis, leading to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
  (ARDS) in lungs. (B) In patients with comorbidities, including hypertension, administration
  of RAS blockers (e.g., ACE-I, and ARBs) suppresses the ACE pathway. In these patients,
  SARS-CoV-2 infection increase ACE2 expression. Upregulated ACE-2 converts Ang I
  to Ang–(1-9) and Ang–(1-7), activating the bradykinin pathway via MAS and AT2R receptors.
  Upregulated bradykinin (bradykinin storm) in the lungs of COVID-19 patients would
  increase SARS-CoV-2 virulence by inducing hypotension, vascular permeability, water
  loss, and inflammation.
