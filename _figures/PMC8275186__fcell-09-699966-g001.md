caption: Interstrand crosslink repair pathways at the stalled replication fork. (A)
  Replication-dependent ICL repair is considered to be carried out mainly by the Fanconi
  anemia pathway. After damage recognition, the ID2 complex is ubiquitylated by the
  activated FA core complex. The monoubiquitinated ID2 complex can further recruit
  structure-specific nucleases for unhooking. Gap filling is carried out by TLS polymerases,
  but the mechanism behind the recruitment of the polymerases is yet unknown. We hypothesize
  that Ub-ID2 serves as a DNA- encircling sliding clamp for TLS polymerases and nucleases.
  (B) When the ongoing DNA replication fork is blocked by DNA lesions, such as ICLs,
  upstream factors recognize it, and PCNA is monoubiquitinated by RAD6/RAD18. We hypothesize
  that monoubiquitinated PCNA acts as a hub for the recruitment of certain PIP box-
  and UBZ domain-containing structure-specific nucleases to unhook the ICL lesion.
  Translesion synthesis polymerases are also recruited to the site of damage by Ub-PCNA,
  which complete the bypass of the DNA damage. The covalent bond of the monoadduct
  is removed by nucleotide excision repair.
