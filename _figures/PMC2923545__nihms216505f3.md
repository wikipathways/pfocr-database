caption: A. Anaphylatoxins are produced and act locally within the immunological synapses.
  Both T cells and APCs synthesize C3a and C5a and express their cognate receptors.
  B. Systemically or locally produced C3a and C5a regulate APC function through the
  production of cytokines, chemokines and interferons. C3aR/C5aR signaling may occur
  on APCs as well as other cell types and synergize with TLRs, NLRs and NOD-like receptors.
  AP, alternative pathway; APC, antigen presenting cell; TLR, Toll-like receptor;
  RLR, retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors; NLR, nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain (NOD)-like receptors; IFNAR, interferon α receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; CCR5; C-C chemokine receptor type 5.
