caption: 'Roles of BRCA2 in replication fork restart. Under replication stress, stalled
  or collapsed forks can be restarted by several pathways, including fork reversal
  (A), homologous recombination to repair one-sided double-stranded breaks formed
  after fork collapse (B), fork repriming by translesion DNA synthesis bypassing the
  lesion (C), or by PrimPol-mediated replisome re-initiation downstream of the lesion
  followed by template switching to repair the associated gap (D). BRCA2 plays both
  homologous recombination (HR)-dependent and HR-independent roles to support fork
  restart and maintain fork stability. In fork reversal (A), stalled forks are reversed
  by RAD51 in two pathways involving DNA translocases (A1: SMARCAL1, ZANRB3, and HLTF;
  A2: FBH1)) to form chicken foot structures, which are susceptible to nuclease degradation
  by MRE11, EXO1, and DNA2. BRCA2 (in association with BRCA1 and PALB2), FANCD2, and
  ABRO1 protect reversed forks against MRE11- and EXO1-mediated resection (A1), while
  53BP1, FANCA, BOD1L, and VHL prevent DNA2-mediated degradation (A2). Whether the
  two pathways generate alternate DNA structures is not known. Reversed forks are
  restored primarily by the RAD51, MUS81, POLD3 pathway and secondarily by the BRCA2,
  PALB2, and POLη pathway. The repair of one-sided DSBs (B) by HR is presumed to occur
  in a fashion highly analogous to the repair of two-sided DSBs (see ) including the
  critical mediator function of BRCA2 in RAD51 filament formation. BRCA2 appears to
  play no role in translesion DNA synthesis (C). Finally, BRCA2 plays a crucial role
  to facilitate RAD51-mediated HR to repair DNA gaps left behind re-initiated forks
  (D) by template switching. Arrowheads represent the 3′-OH end.'
