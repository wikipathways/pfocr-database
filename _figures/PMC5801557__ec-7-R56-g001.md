caption: Parathyroid tumorigenesis mechanisms via the cyclins pathway. CCND1 gene,
  encoding cyclin D1, is upregulated in parathyroid adenomas. MEN1 gene inactivation
  results in a reduction of P27 and inhibition of cyclin and CDK complexes, as well
  as a loss of control of cell cycle progression. Inactivating somatic and germline
  mutations of CDC73 are frequently identified in patients with parathyroid carcinoma.
  CDKN1B has been reported to be downregulated in adenomas compared to normal tissues.
