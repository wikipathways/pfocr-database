caption: Schematic representation of ASS234 targets involved in AD pathogenesis. ASS234
  forms a N5 flavin adduct (like clorgyline) with MAO A and it is able to block AChE-induced
  Aβ aggregation. ASS234 shows antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties and it is
  able to induce neuroprotection through the Wnt pathway. ASS234 also shows less toxicity
  than donepezil in HepG2 cells (With permission of Bolea et al., ).
