caption: The hepatic hormone hepcidin is the central regulator of systemic iron homeostasis.
  The expression of the gene encoding hepcidin (hepcidin antimicrobial protein, “HAMP”)
  is regulated at the transcriptional level by iron via the BMP/Smad signaling pathway,
  by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and by IL-1β via the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and
  by erythropoietic demand. While iron and inflammation increase the expression of
  hepcidin, erythropoietic demand and iron deficiency cause suppression of hepcidin.
  Hepcidin regulate, the level of the sole known iron exporter, ferroportin, at the
  cell surface of enterocytes, hepatocytes, erythrocytes and macrophages, and thereby
  controls the amount of iron in the circulation. IL-6, Interleukin-6; BMP, Bone morphogenetic
  protein; Smad, mothers against decapentaplegic; JAK/STAT3, Janus kinase/Signal Transducer
  and Activator of Transcription 3.
