caption: Regulation of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway. Calcium influx activates calcineurin.
  Calcineurin is negatively regulated by several endogenous inhibitors including the
  calcineurin homologous protein (CHP), a CnB homolog [], DSCR, Down Syndrome’s Candidate
  Region (also called RCAN, regulator of calcineurin) [–], DYRK 1 and 2 (dual-specificity
  tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylation-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2) [], AKAP79 that binds
  to the CnA subunit [], and Cabin (CAIN) []. The immunosuppressant CsA and FK506
  form CsA–cyclophilin A (Cy) and FK506–FB506 binding protein (FKBP) complexes, respectively,
  to bind and competitively inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity []. NFAT is negatively
  regulated by several kinases including Protein kinase A (PKA) that serves as a priming
  kinase to phosphorylate NFATc1 to prepare its regulatory domain for further phosphorylation
  by GSK3 [,]. PKA also functions as a maintenance kinase to phosphorylates NFATc4
  for forming a complex with 14-3-3 and maintain it in the cytosol in an inactive
  state []. DYRK1 and 2 are priming kinases that phosphorylate NFATc2 on its SP3 region
  and prepare its subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3 and casein kinase 1 (CK1) on
  the SRR motif for export [,]. CK1 and MEKK1 phosphorylate NFATc3 to mask its NLS
  and suppress its nuclear import [], while JNK and p38MAPK serve as export kinases
  to phosphorylate NFAT for facilitating nuclear export [–]. NFATc1 can autoamplify
  its own transcription and also stimulate the transcription of NFATc2 []. NFAT proteins
  partner with other transcription factors to stimulate the expression of their target
  genes.
