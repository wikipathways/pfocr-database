caption: RV regulation of the IFN amplification pathway. Following infection, RV NSP1
  efficiently blocks exogenous IFN-directed phosphorylation of STAT1 at Y701, shown
  here for the IFNAR1 (1). In the virus-infected cell, RV also mediates the lysosomal
  degradation of receptors for types I, II, and III IFN by an unknown process (2).
  Along with IRF3 and IRF5, the viral NSP1 protein also proteasomally degrades IRF9
  and IRF7 in the infected cells, which are required for optimal IFN amplification
  responses (3). In addition, RV can inhibit the nuclear translocation of STAT1-pY701
  by an unknown mechanism (4). Remarkably, in addition to these viral effects in infected
  cells, RV also potently inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation in uninfected bystander cells
  in response to different types of IFNs (5). The viral and host factors underlying
  this bystander inhibition of IFNs are unknown.
