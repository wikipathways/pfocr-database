caption: The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway in cyanobacteria. Only major intermediates
  are shown in the core pathway from glutamate to protoporphyrin IX. One arrow corresponds
  to one enzyme involved in the respective reaction. Enzymes operating under aerobic
  and low-oxygen conditions in the three reactions are shown by blue and red arrows,
  respectively. Intermediates detected in ΔchlR cells are shown in green.
