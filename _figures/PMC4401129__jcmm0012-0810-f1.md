caption: Schematic representation of Tie2 (Tie2 tyrosine kinase receptor) structure
  and Ang-1-Tie2 signallingsignaling. Ang-1 binding to Tie2 leads to dimerization
  and autophosphorylation of Tie2. Several effector molecules are recruited and activated,
  leading to downstream signallingsignaling. Several downstream signallingsignaling
  molecules have been identified. Tie2 signals primarily through the PI3-kinase (phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase) pathway. However, Tie2 can also activate other molecules, such as Grb2
  (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2), ABIN-2 (A20-binding inhibitor of NF-κB-2),
  SHP2 (Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase), STATs (Signal
  transducer and activator of transcriptions), Shc-A (Src homology 2 domain containing
  protein), and Dok-R (Downstream-of-kinase-related protein) to elicit various downstream
  effects.
