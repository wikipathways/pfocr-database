caption: Schematic illustration of pathways involved in K-RasG13D mutation. In the
  status of wild type, K-Ras activates both PI3K/Akt and RAS/ERK pathways and promote
  cancer cell growth while suppress stemness (orange lines). Upon mutation at K-RasG13D,
  it mainly acts on RAS/ERK pathway to promote cell proliferation and reduce stemness
  by regulating gene expressions in the nucleus (Red lines). Inhibiting the mutation
  by S7333 will suppress RAS/ERK pathway (blue lines). Under the activation of K-RasG13D
  mutation, the treatment of SCH772894 can more effectively suppress the RAS/ERK pathway
  thus cell proliferation and stemness in mutated but not wild type cells (blue lines).
  Differently, BEZ235 treatment can inhibit cell growth and stemness in both mutated
  and un-mutated cells via PI3K/Akt and bypassing RAS/ERK pathway. After blocking
  K-RasG13D mutation, the activating signal of RAS/ERK is reduced, the sensitivity
  to SCH772894 treatment in mutated cells decreases.
