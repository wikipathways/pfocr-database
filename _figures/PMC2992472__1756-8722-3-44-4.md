caption: 'Schematic representation of the regulatory network of apoptosis in BCL11B
  and its related genes. (a) BCL2L1 is affected by the BCL11B gene in transcriptional
  regulation. (b, d) BCL11B and BCL2L1 participate in the same protein-protein interactions,
  along with competitive downstream target proteins. BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) normally interferes
  with the mitochondrial programmed cell death pathway by sequestering proapoptotic
  proteins such as BCL2-associated × protein (BAX) and BCL2-antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1;
  BAK), suggesting that BAX/BAK may be competitive target proteins downstream of BCL11B.
  (c) The SPP1 gene may be a target of the BCL11B gene in transcriptional regulation:
  it plays a consistent role in anti-apoptotic effects with the BCL11B gene by decreasing
  mitochondrial cytochrome c release.'
