caption: A model for the control of oocyte meiotic maturation by  Gαs-adenylate cyclase
  signaling in the gonadal sheath  cells. MSP is proposed to trigger Gαs-adenylate
  cyclase  signaling resulting in PKA activation. Based on genetic epistasis analysis,  Gαs-adenylate
  cyclase signaling is proposed to antagonize at  least two pathways that inhibit
  meiotic maturation, one involving the germline  innexins INX-14 and INX-22, and
  an uncharacterized pathway defined by  mutations (X?) that suppress acy-4(lf) (S.K.,
  J.A.G. and D.G.,  unpublished). See text for details.
