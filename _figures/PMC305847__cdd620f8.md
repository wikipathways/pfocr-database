caption: Fig. 8. A model for checkpoint regulation of meiotic chromosome segregation
  and spore morphogenesis by Sum1 and Ndt80. In this model, persistent DSBs signal
  through the Rad17/Rad24/Mec1 checkpoint signaling pathway to negatively regulate
  Sum1 destruction in prophase. The signaling pathway is shown to inhibit X, which
  could represent a trans-acting component of the degradation machinery or a cis-domain
  of the Sum1 protein itself required for its destruction. The pachytene checkpoint
  is also shown to negatively regulate Ndt80 (; ). Different classes of MSE can be
  regulated by Sum1, by Ndt80, or by both Sum1 and Ndt80 due to differential affinities
  of MSE sequence variants for these proteins (). A set of promoters regulated by
  the Sum1/Ndt80 class of MSE would be rate limiting for chromosome segregation. Thus,
  mutation of either SUM1 or RAD17 would increase the expression of this gene set
  to partially bypass the checkpoint block and permit chromosome segregation. In contrast,
  a set of promoters regulated predominantly by the Sum1 class of MSE, as well as
  a set of promoters regulated predominantly by the Ndt80 class of MSE, is required
  for spore morphogenesis. Thus, mutation of both SUM1 and RAD17 are required to completely
  bypass the block to allow spore formation under conditions where the checkpoint
  is active.
