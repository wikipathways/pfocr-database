caption: Schematic diagram of tumor environment in renal cell carcinoma with currently
  available therapeutic drug targets. Created with Biorender.com. (a) Intratumoral
  cell hypoxia leads to PI3K pathway pVHL activation, leading to HIF accumulation
  and altered cellular transcription, with downstream effects including angiogenesis
  factor production. (b) Various receptors and pro-angiogenic factors that interact
  with endothelial cells. (c) Immune checkpoints on regulatory T cells such as PD-1
  and CTLA-4 are integral to the anti-tumor response, and their inhibition allows
  T cells to activate and cause cell death.
