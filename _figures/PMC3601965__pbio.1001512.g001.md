caption: Secreted oligopeptide signals are synthesized as immature pro-peptides, which
  are then processed and secreted. The mature oligopeptides bind to and regulate histidine
  kinases belonging to two-component or phosphorelay signal transduction systems,
  or the oligopeptides otherwise bind to oligopeptide permeases, which import the
  oligopeptides into the cell. Here the oligopeptides bind to and regulate (activate
  or, in some cases, inhibit) the activity of DNA binding transcription factors, such
  as Streptococcus Rgg, Bacillus PlcR and NprR, or Enterococcus PrgX. Alternatively,
  the oligopeptides bind to and regulate the Bacillus Rap proteins. The Rap proteins
  function as phosphatases targeting intermediate response regulators such as Spo0F
  belonging to the sporulation phosphorelay pathway that activates (phosphorylates)
  the master response regulator Spo0A, or the Rap proteins function as transcriptional
  anti-activators targeting response regulator transcription factors such as ComA
  and DegU. H, histidine; D, aspartate; P, phosphoryl group; Pi, inorganic phosphate;
  REC, receiver domain; DBD, DNA Binding Domain.
