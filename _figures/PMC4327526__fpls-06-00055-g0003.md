caption: LCBs, PA, MAPKs, and ROS in the signaling pathway involved in stomata closure
  as a strategy to prevent pathogen entry during an immunity response. The schematic
  shows the main pathway involved in the response to the bacterial strains Pst DC3000,
  E. coli and Xcc, or to treatment with elicitors such as chitosan, YEL, flg22, LPS
  (solid lines) and SA, a phytohormone involved in defense responses (dashed lines).
  In the case of innate immunity, pathogen signals are recognized by receptors surface-located
  and then information is transmitted as illustrated. Once the information reaches
  stomata, which is barely understood, they are closed by mechanisms that regulate
  ion and water fluxes that produce loss of guard cell turgor and then the closing
  of the central pore. The defense strategy is to close stomata in order to prevent
  new pathogen entry. The less characterized pathways are those engaged by exposure
  to E. coli, Xcc, flg22, and LPS, as well as those comprised in the response to the
  virulent pathogen Pst DC3000. The former have been shown to involve MPK3/6 in stomata
  closure, whereas the response to Pst DC3000 has been shown to require ABA, promoting
  rapid and transient increases in LCBs within the same time frame as stomata closure
  (3 h). In the case of chitosan and YEL, stomata closure requires H2O2 produced by
  a peroxidase within the apoplast, which then diffuses into the cell causing an increase
  in NO levels and activation of MPK9/12. Enhanced production of H2O2 induced by SA
  is not only mediated by the apoplast peroxidase, but also the catalytic activity
  of the AtrbohD/F NADPH oxidases. This effect is possibly mediated through the action
  of PA, whose cellular levels have been observed to increase during SA-induced stomatal
  closure. No evidence of MAP kinase activation has been documented in this pathway.
