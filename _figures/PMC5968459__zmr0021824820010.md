caption: Hierarchical regulatory network controlling different cell types of Ustilago
  maydis. During the fusion of two nonpathogenic, yeast-like sporidia, the binding
  of peptide pheromones to the pheromone receptor (Pra) activates a MAP kinase (MAPK)
  cascade, and environmental signals feed via a so-far-unidentified receptor into
  a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway. Both pathways converge at Prf1, the
  central transcription factor required for mating-dependent gene expression. Prf1
  is additionally regulated at the transcriptional level by the transcription factors
  Rop1 and Hap2, both of which are thought to be targets of the MAPK cascade. The
  phosphorylation of Prf1 results in the induction of the bE and bW genes; after the
  fusion of two sporidia, bE and bW form a heterodimeric transcription factor that
  is the master regulator to induce filamentous growth and pathogenic development.
  The central node for gene regulation at the onset of pathogenic development is the
  transcription factor Rbf1. rbf1 gene expression is already induced by Prf1 prior
  to cell fusion, but expression is boosted after cell fusion and the formation of
  the filamentous dikaryon by the bE/bW heterodimer. Rbf1 is sufficient to trigger
  the expression of all genes required for plant penetration. Among the Rbf1-induced
  genes are the transcription factors Biz1 and Hdp2, both of which are absolutely
  required for plant infection. Hdp2 and Biz1 are highly expressed at the later stages
  of in planta development, while rbf1 expression is barely detectable within the
  plant. biz1 and hdp2 are also regulated by physical cues on the plant surface via
  the plasma membrane receptor Sho1/Msb2. Two transcription factors specifically expressed
  during the biotrophic phase are Fox1, which is thought to contribute to the regulation
  of several effector genes, and Ros1, a regulator for the late developmental steps
  during spore formation.

  description: Hierarchical regulatory network controlling different cell types of
