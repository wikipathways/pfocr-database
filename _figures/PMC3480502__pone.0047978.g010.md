caption: Following MNNG exposure, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced and DNA
  double-strand breaks (DSB) are formed. PAR transiently accumulates and its metabolism
  results in a decrease in ATP and NAD+ levels, while cellular AMP increases concomitantly.
  The high AMP levels activate AMPK by LKB1. AMPK activation causes inactivation of
  the mTORC1 pathway through phosphorylation of Raptor and inhibition of S6 phosphorylation.
  S6 phosphorylation may also be affected by the reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation observed
  following PAR synthesis. Even though mTORC1 inhibition is the first step towards
  the establishment of an autophagic state, autophagy is not activated. Rictor phosphorylation
  is affected by PAR synthesis and Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 is impaired. Finally,
  in HEK293 cells, PARP-1 activation by MNNG exposure results in necrotic cell death.
  The PARP inhibitor AG14361 and the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) inhibit
  PAR synthesis and prevent cell death.
