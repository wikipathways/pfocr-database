caption: 'General model of the RHO OF PLANTS (ROP) signalling pathway. GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE
  EXCHANGE FACTORS (GEFs) activate ROPs by catalysing the exchange of GDP for GTP,
  which enhances ROP plasma membrane attachment. In plants, three classes of GEFs,
  which have characteristic catalytic GEF domains, can activate ROPs. SPIKE contains
  a DOCK domain, SWITCHING B-CELL COMPLEX-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 70 (SWAP70) contains
  a DBL domain, and ROPGEFs contain the plant-specific PRONE domain. Active ROPs recruit
  different scaffolding proteins of the ROP INTERACTING CRIB-CONTAINING PROTEIN (RIC),
  ROP INTERACTING PARTNER (RIP), or BOUNDARY OF ROP DOMAIN (BDR) families to activate
  downstream signalling pathways. Depending on the complex composition and the recruited
  scaffold, specific pathways can be activated. GTPase ACTIVATING PROTEINS (GAPs)
  inactivate ROPs by promoting the hydrolysis reaction of ROPs from GTP to GDP. In
  plants, two classes of GAPs are found: PH domain-containing PHGAPs and plant-specific
  ROPGAPs, of which most contain a CRIB domain. Interaction of GAPs with ROPs can
  be enhanced by ARMADILLO REPEAT ONLY (ARO) or ROP1 enhancer 4 (REN4) scaffolding
  proteins. Furthermore, GUANOSINE NUCLEOTIDE DISSOCIATION INHIBITORs (GDIs) can sequester
  ROPs in the cytosol to ensure their inactivity. Both the activation and inactivation
  can be regulated by phosphorylation of the ROP regulators. GEFs are phosphorylated
  and activated by RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASEs (RLKs) and ACGVIII kinases, while GAPs are
  stabilized by phosphorylation via BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2). ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; TOR, TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN'
