caption: Representation of the tandem function of megalin and cubilin in renal uptake
  of 25(OH)-VD. (a) Filtered complexes of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and 25(OH)-VD
  are endocytosed by the proximal tubular epithelium via an endocytic receptor-mediated
  pathway recognizing VDBP. The VDBP is degraded in the lysosomes releasing 25(OH)-VD
  which is either secreted or hydroxylated in the mitochondria to 1,25(OH)2-VD. Both
  25(OH)-VD and 1,25(OH)2-VD reenter the circulation bound to VDBP. (b) Postulated
  megalin and cubilin shedding in chronic kidney disease (CKD) perpetuating vitamin
  D deficiency (VDD) with subsequent lower 25(OH)-VD reuptake and intracrine 1,25(OH)2-VD
  production in the renal proximal tubules.
