caption: Proposed reactions in the phenylpyruvate and mandelate pathways in yeast
  and genes proposed to be involved in the phenylpyruvate/mandelate pathway for synthesis
  of benzenoids. Interestingly, it has been reported that these enzymes in bacteria
  might use both phenylpyruvate- and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate-derived compounds as
  substrates (), and our results also suggest a double function in yeast.
