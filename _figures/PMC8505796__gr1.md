caption: 'Biological processes affected by ALDH1A1 or ALDH1A3 function.A. Inhibition
  of ROS production. Chemotherapeutics and radiation produce elevated levels of oxidative
  stress in cancer cells as part of their treatment effect; the “ROS scavenging” activity
  of ALDH could protect cancer cells against these therapeutic approaches by maintaining
  ROS at low levels. Attenuation of ALDH activity has been shown to accumulate ROS
  in CSCs, leading to DNA damage and apoptosis .B. Detoxification of reactive aldehydes
  to carboxylic acids is a natural trait of both enzymes. Oxidative stress damages
  DNA and proteins as long as it triggers lipid peroxidation of cellular phospholipids
  yielding over 200 species of reactive aldehydes. ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 detoxify them
  and protect the cell, leading to the detoxification of commonly used anticancer
  treatment regimens .C. Retinoid acid production. Alcohol dehydrogenases control
  the reversible conversion of retinol to retinal. Retinal is subsequently metabolized
  irreversibly to retinoic acid (RA) (all-trans, 9-cis, 13-cis) under control of ALDH1A1,
  ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3 and ALDH8A1 , . RA acts as a signalling molecule to regulate gene
  transcription, leading to changes in cellular differentiation and proliferation
  .D. Retinoid acid-mediated signalling. In the classic pathway (blue arrow) after
  entering the nucleus, RA is a ligand for heterodimer formed by nuclear retinoic
  acid receptor (RARα) and retinoid X receptor (RXRs), which anneals to DNA via a
  conserved DNA-binding domain at two RA responsive element sites (RARE and RXRE)
  . These responsive elements are found in promoters of many retinoid-inducible genes,
  and transcriptional activation occurs upon binding the RAR/ RXR complex to them
  . The RARs do not bind DNA alone, but RXR can bind DNA as a homodimer. In the absence
  of ligands, the RAR/ RXR complex still acts as a transcriptional repressor, thanks
  to bound corepressors, resulting in deacetylation of histones and thus repressing
  transcription of the target genes . Conversely, after RA binding, conformational
  changes and subsequent binding to coactivators (SRC or histone acetylases) lead
  to histone acetylation and transcriptional activation . In the non-classic pathway
  (red arrows), RA has multiple targets. It can bind to RXR and peroxisome-proliferator-activated
  receptor β/δ (PPARβ/δ) heterodimers or RXR and ERα heterodimers and trigger the
  expression of its downstream target genes like AKT or c-MYC, respectively. RA can
  also bind with the RARα monomer (green arrow) outside of the nucleus and activate
  the PI3K/AKT pathway , . The activation of the AKT, c-MYC or PI3K/AKT pathway leads
  to marked changes in cellular differentiation and proliferation, tumorigenesis,
  stemness and resistance to therapy .Abbreviations: ER – estrogen receptor, PPARβ/δ
  - peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor β/δ, RAR - retinoic acid receptor,
  RXR - retinoid X receptor, ROS - reactive oxygen species. (For interpretation of
