caption: Intracellular and metabolic pathways of glutamine. Glutamine can integrate
  into a wide variety of metabolic and intracellular pathways, such as hexosamine
  biosynthesis (HBP), nucleotide synthesis (NBP), and mitochondrial metabolism through
  conversion to glutamate by glutaminase (GLS), and further to α-ketoglutarate (αKG)
  by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) or transamination (PSAT/GOT/GPT). Glutamine can
  be synthetized endogenously by glutamine synthetase (GS). Through glutamate, glutamine
  integrates the synthesis of many amino acids such as alanine, aspartate, serine,
  glycine (SHMT), and proline (P5CS). Glutamine can be exchanged for essential amino
  acids (EAA) through the LAT transporters, which, in turn, stimulate the mechanistic
  Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. Additionally, glutamate
  can be exchanged for cystine by xCT, upstream of glutathione (GSH) synthesis through
  glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL).
