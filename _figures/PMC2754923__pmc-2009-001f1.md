caption: 'Overall sketch of the two IPP/DMAPP producing pathways and their intracellular
  localization in plants. Arrows indicate the overall pathway; many intermediates
  and additional substrates such as ATP and NADPH are omitted. The possible crosstalk
  between pathways is also marked with arrows. GPP: Geranyl diphosphate (C10), FPP:
  Farnesyl diphosphate (C15), GGPP: Geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C20).,'
