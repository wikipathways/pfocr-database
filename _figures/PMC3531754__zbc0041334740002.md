caption: Reaction diagram of the galloylated catechin biosynthetic pathway. In the
  first reaction (I), the galloylated acyl donor βG was biosynthesized by UGGT from
  the substrates GA and UDPG. In the second reaction (II), galloylated catechins ECG
  or EGCG were produced by ECGT from the substrates βG and nongalloylated catechins
  EC or EGC.
