caption: 'Major signaling pathways in melanomas. The most essential pathways in melanomagenesis
  are the MAPK pathway (in green) and the PI3K pathway (violet). The MAPK pathway
  is activated by receptor tyrosine kinase and G-protein-coupled receptors. This activates
  RAS proteins, which in turn activates MEK, and then ERK. ERK can then translocate
  to the nucleus and phosphorylate transcriptional factor substrates involved in cell
  survival. NF1 negatively regulates RAS proteins which inhibits downstream RAS signaling.
  The PI3K pathway can be activated by RAS or through the inactivation of PTEN. PI3K
  can activate several pathways (BAD, NF-kB) and AKT pathways, which in turn leads
  to phosphorylation of mTOR, which leads to increased cellular proliferation. The
  CDKN2A pathway is another essential network in melanomas (yellow). CDKN2A encodes
  two inhibitory variants of the G1–S phase. These inhibitors (tumor suppressors)
  are P16INK4A, which can bind to CDK4/6, preventing them from interacting with CCND1
  and RB phosphorylation. When phosphorylated, RB can release an E2F factor which
  leads to G1–S cell cycle progression. P14ARF can bind to MDM2 which is responsible
  for p53 degradation. Epigenetic regulators can be altered in melanomas. IDH1/2 are
  enzymes that convert isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate. IDH1/2 mutations can lead to
  the formation of the oncometabolite D2H that can alter and silence several key regulator
  genes (although the exact role of IDH mutations in melanomas has not been elucidated).
  Hotspot mutations and amplifications in EZH2 can lead to aberrant methylation of
  H3K27, leading to dysregulation of transcriptional factors. Alterations in c-KIT
  and NTRK fusions (although rare in melanomas) can contribute to melanomagenesis
  through downstream signaling of several pathways, including MAPK and PI3K, to drive
  cellular proliferation. Abbreviation: RTK: receptor tyrosine-kinase; NTRK: neurotrophic
