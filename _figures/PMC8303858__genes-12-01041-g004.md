caption: Global Interaction Map and regulatory pathways of the ACE2, FURIN and TMPRSS2
  interactome. Identified proteins are highlighted in light pink, showing direct regulatory
  relationships, including binding, post-translational modifications and transcriptional
  regulation. Differential pathways were generated using the “direct interaction”
  algorithm to map interactions and relationships. Based on biological process analysis
  and molecular functions, these proteins are implicated, including FURIN, in cell
  differentiation, protein cleavage and cell invasion. Unsupervised pathway assessment
  showed that TMPRSS2 is implicated in several biological pathways, involving cell
  fusion, viral entry and vascularization, in addition to being associated with severe
  acute respiratory syndrome pathogenesis, along with ACE2, which was found to be
  an upstream regulator for several of the identified interactomes involved in viral
  reproduction and the inflammatory response to viral infections. In silico validation
  included the protein entities and biological processes involved, along with the
  interaction types and directionality, along with the PubMed references utilized
  to derive these interaction types ().
