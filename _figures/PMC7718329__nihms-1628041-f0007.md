caption: Graphical depiction of the pathway under study regulating TNBC tumor-initiating
  CSCs. The figure represents a convergence of findings from our previous reports
  (–) and results from the current study. The antioxidant catalase (CAT), which specifically
  targets and neutralizes H2O2, is downregulated in TNBC. This allows for upregulation
  of redox signaling by H2O2, driving a gene expression cascade from TET1 through
  TARDBP and SRSF2 to support expression of MBD2_v2 and ultimately maintain CSC self-renewal.
  Moreover, increasing H2O2 leads to an increase in gene expression and expansion
  of CSCs. Obesity raises levels of pro-inflammatory signaling factors (e.g., cytokines)
  that raise levels of H2O2 systemically and in breast cancer cells as further evidenced
  and discussed in (). This may explain the link between obesity and increased expression
  of the genes in this pathway.
