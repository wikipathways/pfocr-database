caption: Summary highlighting the 4 pathways discussed in the text by which ATM influences
  the repair of DSBs. The impact on the level or fidelity of DSB repair in each pathway
  is shown by brackets; the type of cell affected is highlighted in red. Additional
  impacts of ATM, such as its role in regulating apoptosis, may also influence survival
  levels in response to DSBs but here we focus on pathways that influence DSB repair.
