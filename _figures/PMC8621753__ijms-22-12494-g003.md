caption: Representative actions of melatonin that involve the mitochondria. Melatonin,
  derived from the pineal gland, after supplemental ingestion or consumed in the diet
  is taken up by cells and transported into the mitochondria via the oligopeptide
  transporters, PEPT1/2. All cells are believed to synthesize melatonin in their mitochondria
  via the conventional pathway as described in the pineal gland. In mitochondria,
  melatonin can be reverse-metabolized to its precursor, N-acetylserotonin (NAS);
  this involves the extrahepatic monooxygenase enzyme, P450 1B1. Thus, the changes
  induced by melatonin may also involve NAS production. The most recently discovered
  actions of melatonin that involve the mitochondria are its effects on tunneling
  nanotubes (TNT) which allow for the transfer of mitochondria between cells. 5-HT
  = serotonin; AANAT = arylalkyl-N-acetyltransferase; ASMT = acetyl serotonin methyltransferase;
