caption: Schematic view of the branched chain amino acid pathway with the proposed
  pathway for norvaline synthesis from pyruvate in relation with glycolysis and the
  tricarbonic acid cycle in E. coli. Overflow metabolites and anaerobic routes are
  included. For simplification some metabolic pathways with more steps are illustrated
  by an interrupted line. Numbers relate to the amount of enzymatic reactions. Enzymes
  are indicated by their gene names.
