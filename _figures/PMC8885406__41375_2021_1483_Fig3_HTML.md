caption: Increased XPO1 expression mediates nucleocytoplasmic displacement and inactivation
  of tumor suppressor proteins, leading to tumorigenesis as well as emergent drug
  resistance. Cytoplasmic dislocation of P53 is implicated in imatinib’s acquired
  drug resistance and PI3K inhibitor CYH33. Mislocalized topoisomerase 2α (TOP2A)
  to the cytoplasm is linked to doxorubicin resistance. Ibrutinib resistance is associated
  with XPO1 mediated nuclear export of inhibitors of NF- κB (IκB), P50, and P65, leading
  to activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. The nuclear export of FOXO3A is illustrated
  in acquired ibrutinib resistance, which XPO1 inhibitors can overcome. Platinum resistance
  is linked to β-catenin, which is regulated by the XPO1 mediated cytoplasmic displacement
  of Galectin 3.
