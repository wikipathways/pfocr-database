caption: βHB decreases ROS production, increases antioxidant defenses, and increases
  neurotransmitter synthesis. βHB oxidizes the Q/QH2 couple to decrease the transfer
  of electrons from QH2 to oxygen by reverse electron transport at complex I (CI)
  and, thus, decrease the production of superoxide (O2•) radicals. βHB generates NADPH
  by (i) increasing the transfer of hydride ions from NADH to NADP+, (ii) inhibiting
  glycolysis, thus increasing pentose phosphate pathway flux, and (iii) increasing
  citrate-pyruvate and citrate-isocitrate cycle flux. NADPH, in turn, supports antioxidant
  defenses, including improving (reducing) the glutathione (GSH-GSSG), thioredoxin
  (TRX), and vitamins C and E reduced to oxidized ratios. NADPH reduces dihydrobiopterin
  (BH2) into tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and, thereby, increases the synthesis of the
  neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and melatonin.
