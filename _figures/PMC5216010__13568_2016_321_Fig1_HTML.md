caption: Fatty acid metabolism and heterologous alkane production in fungi. The S.
  elongatus FAR and FADO genes were heterologously expressed in A. carbonarius. The
  introduced alkane biosynthetic pathway is marked with green arrows. The FADO enzyme
  requires ferredoxin (Fdx), ferredoxin reductase (Fpr) and NADPH as cofactor. The
  endogenous source supplying these cofactors is not known. The fatty acid metabolism
  involves the ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase
  (FAS) and palmitoyl-ACP thioesterase (PAT). Fatty aldehydes are potentially converted
  into free fatty acids by the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH)
