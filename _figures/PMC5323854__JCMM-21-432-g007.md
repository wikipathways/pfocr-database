caption: Putative mechanism of necroptosis in the development of intestinal injury
  following intestinal I/R. In the proposed model, intestinal I/R stimulates the endogenous
  TNF‐α production and TNFR1 combination, and activation of the downstream RIP1/RIP3‐MLKL
  signalling pathway, which triggers necroptotic intestinal epithelium death and release
  of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, further contributing to the additional
  loss of functional epithelium and subsequent mucosal barrier dysfunction. Nec‐1
  administration reduced the number of necroptotic cells and extracellular HMGB1 level,
  which decreases the inflammatory drive that both increases TLR4 and RAGE expression
  and activates the detrimental effect of HMGB1 signalling in intestinal ischaemia.
