caption: The inflammatory pathways involved in the DN process. High glucose or stimulating
  factors cause the activation of multiple pathways, including P38/MAPK, PI3K/AKT,
  TLR4/NLRP3 and the novel CRP/DPP4/CD32b, which all further activate NF-κB pathway,
  and transcriptionally promote the expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines
  to enhance inflammation. SMAD7 can inhibit NF-κB activity. NRF2 has anti-inflammatory
  and antioxidant functions in DN. In addition, JAK/STAT pathway induces IL-6 to promote
  the inflammatory response in DN. DN, diabetic nephropathy; IL, interleukin; TNF,
  tumor necrosis factor; NF-κB, Nuclear factor-κB; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant
