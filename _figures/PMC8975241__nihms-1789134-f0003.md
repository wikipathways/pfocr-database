caption: '(A) PD-1 triggering on monocytes results in impaired Bruton’s tyrosine kinase
  (BTK) signaling, glycolysis and phagocytosis. PD-1 pathway blockade reverts this
  metabolic dysfunction. TLR: Toll-Like Receptor. (B) Granulocyte/macrophage progenitors
  (GMPs), which accumulate during cancer-driven emergency myelopoiesis express PD-1,
  which compromised growth factor-mediated signaling and metabolic activity, preserving
  an immature state and giving rise to myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). PD-1
  ablation or blockade prevents MDSC accumulation, and promotes effector differentiation.
  These effects are correlated with increased metabolic activity of glycolysis, pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), and TCA cycle and elevated cholesterol, a key enhancer
  of antigen-presenting function.'
