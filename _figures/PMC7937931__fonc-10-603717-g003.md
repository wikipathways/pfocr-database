caption: 'Diagram of the relationship between genes and their genetic functions. Correspondence
  between each gene and its function is shown by connections between lines. In the
  “Cancer Classification Markers” section, 17 classification marker genes were categorized
  in accordance with Di Palma classification. Filled “yellow” highlights represent
  significant differences in gene expression by immunostaining classification. Filled
  “violet” highlights represent significant differences in gene expression by onset
  classification (Ca-ex-PA > de novo). Filled “pink” highlights represent significant
  differences in gene expression by onset classification (de novo > Ca-ex-PA). Analysis
  by genetic function revealed that the significant differences in expression between
  Ca-ex-PA and de novo were concentrated in genes associated with angiogenesis and
  the AKT/PI3K signaling pathway (Fisher’s test: p-value = 0.025 and 0.004, respectively).'
