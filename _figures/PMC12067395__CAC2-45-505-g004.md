caption: 'Interactions between tumors and copper. (A) Proliferation. ATOX1 and SOD1
  bind copper ions and facilitate the translocation of ATOX1 and SOD1 into the nucleus,
  thereby activating the transcription of Cyclin D1 and contributing to ribosome maturation,
  which promotes tumor proliferation. (B) Energy metabolism. C‐MYC enhances the transcription
  of CTR1, thereby facilitating copper uptake. Elevated copper levels, in turn, stimulate
  the transcription of GLUT1, PKM, and LDHA, while also increasing the activity of
  CcO. This cascade significantly boosts the energy metabolism of tumor cells. (C)
  Carcinogenic signaling pathway. Copper directly binds and activates EGFR and MET,
  initiating signal transduction mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases in a ligand‐independent
  manner. Additionally, copper may inhibit the Notch signaling pathway, which further
  promotes tumorigenesis. (D) Autophagy. The interaction between copper and ULK1/2
  facilitates the formation of autophagosomes, thereby enhancing tumor survival and
  proliferation. (E) Angiogenesis. Cu activates NF‐κB and HIF‐1, resulting in an elevation
  of pro‐angiogenic factors. (F) Metastasis. Copper binds to LOX, enhances its activity,
  and facilitates LOX‐dependent metastasis. (G) Inflammation. Cu activates NF‐κB,
  resulting in an elevation of inflammatory factors. (H) Chemotherapy resistance.
  Elevated intracellular copper levels bind to PDK1, which subsequently activates
  the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway. This activation accelerates the transcription of ATP7B,
  resulting in increased platinum efflux and resistance. Abbreviations: ATOX1, antioxidant
