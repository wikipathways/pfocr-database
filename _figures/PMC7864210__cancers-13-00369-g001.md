caption: ERα:E2 signaling network and crosstalk with growth factor signaling. (A)
  Schematic view of classic genomic ERα:E2 signaling involving passive diffusion of
  E2 into cytoplasm and nucleus and activation of ERα signaling. (B) Growth factors
  activate receptor tyrosine kinases, which activate MAPKs. MAPKs can then phosphorylate
  and activate ERα either independent of E2 or synergize with E2 for optimal ERα activation.
  (C) Membrane associated ERα interacts and activates SRC kinase upon ligand binding.
  SRC kinase then phosphorylates and activates aromatase, which catalyzes conversion
  of androgens to estrogens within cells and amplify both genomic and nongenomic ERα-E2
  signaling. (D) Membrane anchored ERα can also activate various cytoplasmic kinases
  including PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway through nongenomic actions and these actions occur
  rapidly (within five minutes) after encountering the ligand. Activated PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  can enhance genomic actions of ERα (depicted in Figure 3). (E,F) Activated ERα alters
  gene expression in the nucleus through either direct binding to estrogen response
  elements (EREs) in the genome or bind genome by tethering onto other transcription
  factors (TFs) and their response element (RE).
