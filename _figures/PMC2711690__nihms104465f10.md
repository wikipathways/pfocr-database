caption: Independent of its source (endogenous/exogenous), 17β-estradiol protects
  the hippocampus against cerebral ischemia via activation of CREB pathway. Simplified
  scheme depicting the basic hypothesis proposed in the present study. The outer circle
  represents different phases of the rat estrous cycle. The rising levels of estradiol
  observed during the transition from diestrus to proestrus or after bolus injection
  to OvX female rats, induce phosphorylation of MAPK and CaMKII in hippocampal neurons.
  This phosphorylation of MAPK and CaMKII could be mediated via estrogen receptor
  activation and/or calcium influx through L-type calcium channels (; ). Activated
  MAPK and CaMKII induced phosphorylation of CREB. This estradiol-mediated CREB signaling
  pathway in hippocampus induced ischemic tolerance for the duration of that particular
  cycle or 72 h after a bolus of 17β-estradiol replacement to OvX rats. This estradiol-mediated
  neuroprotection was lost at the diestrus stage.
