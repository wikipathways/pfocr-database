caption: The methane monooxygenases (PMO1 and PMO2) are involved in the oxidation
  of methane and other SCA [] to their respective alcohols. The lanthanide-dependent
  methanol dehydrogenase (XoxF) is involved in the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde
  or formate. The XoxF or other alcohol dehydrogenases (e.g., the GMC oxidoreductase
  complex transported to the periplasm via the TAT system; GMC large subunit (GmcA)
  and small subunit (GmcB)) encoded by the strain might be involved in converting
  2-propanol and 1,2-propanediol to acetone and acetol, respectively. The reduced
  quinones can provide the reducing equivalents for PMO2 and PMO3 from methanol oxidation
  and 2-propanol oxidation pathways. Acetone generated from 2-propanol is oxidized
  to acetol through the action of the PMO3. The acetol produced is oxidized to methylglyoxal
  by GMC oxidoreductase. Transport of methylglyoxal into the cytoplasm can occur via
  passive diffusion or possibly via a transporter. The glyoxalase (I and II) enzyme
  system convert methylglyoxal to lactate, further converted to pyruvate by lactate
  dehydrogenase. The pyruvate generated can be converted to PEP by PEP-synthase, an
  essential step in gluconeogenesis during growth on the C3 substrates. The alternative
  complex III (Comp ACIII) transfers electrons from reduced quinones via a cytochrome
  c (Cyt-c) to complex IV, thereby regenerating the quinone pool. The respiratory
  complexes translocate protons across the cellular membrane. Pyruvate enters the
  TCA cycle for ATP/NADH production and anabolic processes. For selected predicted
  reactions for C1 and C3 metabolism, the gene identifiers are shown in blue for genes
  in cluster IT6_09370-09425 and red for others. Black dashed arrows represent reactions
  for which the candidate enzyme was not confidently predicted.
