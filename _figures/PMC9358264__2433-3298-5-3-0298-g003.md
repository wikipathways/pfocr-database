caption: Contribution of different types of antigen-presenting cells to MP1 development.For
  MP cell development, antigen-presenting cells including DCs are essential to provide
  naïve precursors with self-Ag/MHC as well as costimulatory/coinhibitory signals.
  Additionally, DC1s play an inevitable role in homeostatic MP1 differentiation. This
  DC subset tonically produces IL-12 in response to some self-derived agonists (unidentified)
  via TLR7-MyD88 signaling pathway in steady state.
