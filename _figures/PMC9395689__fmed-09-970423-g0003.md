caption: RAGE signaling in podocytes. (1) Exposure of podocytes to either AGE or soluble
  urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) activates the NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)
  and Rac1, which is a component of the NOX2 multiprotein complex. NOX2 generates
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) that activates Src kinases and induces the production
  of the calcium channel, TRPC6. Each of these responses can be inhibited by either
  RAGE antagonists (FPS-ZM1or azeliragon) or by an αVβ3 integrin antagonist (cilengitide,
  an angiogenesis inhibitor). Changes in TRPC6 activity are associated with podocyte
  injury. (2) Angiotensin II (Ang II) activation of the Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R)
  induces RAGE expression. Ang II also activates AT1R, which transactivates RAGE and
  induces the common RAGE downstream signal, diaphanous homolog 1 (DIAPH1). In additional
  cell types, DIAPH1 induces Rac1 activity, suggesting a potential similar function
  in podocytes. Rac1 activity can damage podocytes and induce foot process effacement.
  (3) AGE activation of RAGE induces the production of γ-secretase, which cleaves
  NOTCH1 to form the transcription co-activator, NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD1).
  NICD1 complexed to CBF-1/suppressor of hairless/LAG-1 (CSL) promotes the transcription
  of the NOTCH ligand, Jagged1. NOTCH1 cell signals in podocytes are associated with
  injury.
