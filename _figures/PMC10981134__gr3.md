caption: 'The coexistence of the classical and alternative p38 activation pathways
  is necessary to maintain a balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
  responses. TCR stimulation activates two distinct p38 signaling pathways: the ‘classical’
  pathway involving ZAP-70 kinase, LAT signalosome assembly, SOS recruitment, and
  activation of MAPK cascades, and the ‘alternative’ pathway, in which p38 is directly
  activated by ZAP-70. Indeed, TCR-induced ZAP-70 activation mediates p38 phosphorylation
  at Tyr323, inducing its auto-activation. Activation of p38 through the ZAP-70–dependent
  alternative pathway lowers the activation threshold for the classical pathway, leading
  to full p38 activation. Inhibition of the classical p38 pathway by SOS deletion
  leads to a reduction in Treg cell differentiation, whereas the alternative pathway
  is required to maintain pro-inflammatory T helper functions, thus suggesting that
  both pathways work in concert to balance pro- and anti-inflammatory T cell responses.
