caption: Angiopoietin-2-mediated vascular sprouting in hepatocellular carcinoma. Vascular
  remodeling is crucial for the growth and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC) [,]. The formation of new blood vessels is induced by the angiogenic switch,

  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang)-2 [,,,]. Overexpression
  of Ang-2 may be mediated by hypoxia [], VEGF overexpression [], cyclooxygenase (COX)-2
  overexpression [] and AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (Arid1a)
  deficiency [], among others, and alters the quantitative balance between Ang-1 and
  Ang-2 expression in favor of Ang-2 []. Subsequent interaction with its receptor,
  tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin (Ig) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) homology
  domains 2 (Tie2), which are predominantly expressed on the surface of endothelial
  cells, result in vessel destabilization and, thereby, facilitates other proangiogenic
  factors, including VEGF, to induce vascular sprouting [,]. Ang-2 is thus dependent
