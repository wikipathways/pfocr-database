caption: 'Schematic of the mechanism of PTX3 regulation of innate immunity and ferroptosis
  after LPS challenge. This graph showed that hepatocyte deficiency in PTX3 heightened
  Tfrc and Ccl20 expression, thereby augmenting ferroptosis and attracting macrophages.
  Simultaneously, Ptx3 deficiency in macrophages fostered M1 polarization via NF-κB
  pathway activation. These aggregated macrophages significantly contributed to the
  elimination of detrimental agents, facilitating inflammation clearance. (By Figdraw.com,
