caption: Quality control impacts the secretion of vitamin K-dependent proteins. (A)
  Newly-synthesized proteins undergo maturation that is mediated by chaperones and
  involves protein folding and, in some cases, disulfide bond formation and the assembly
  of complexes. Quality control mechanisms distinguish mature versus immature proteins,
  which are processed differently. Mature proteins exit the endoplasmic reticulum
  and traffic to the Golgi and beyond, while immature proteins are targeted for degradation
  through the ERAD pathway. (B) Vitamin K-dependent (VKD) protein maturation also
  includes Glu carboxylation to Gla that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cellular
  studies have shown that the fate of carboxylated and uncarboxylated proteins varies
  among individual VKD proteins. Specifically, both factor IX forms are secreted from
  cells, while only the carboxylated form is secreted in the case of protein C and
  protein Z.
