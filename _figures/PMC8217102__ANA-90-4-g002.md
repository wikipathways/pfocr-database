caption: Common cellular changes detected in the central nervous system of Down syndrome
  (DS)/Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects compared to controls. (A) 1. Endosomal body/multivesicular
  body (MVB) processing in normal individuals. 2. Uncorrupted lysosome (LYS)‐mediated
  degradative system. (B) 1. Altered endosome pathway. Individuals with DS/AD manifest
  changes and impairments in cargo sorting and metabolism from early endosomes (EEs)
  or late endosome (LEs) to MVBs toward the degradation pathway, resulting in increased
  number and enlargement of EEs, LEs, and MVB, and increased exosome production and
  release. 2. Degradative pathway defects. Proteolysis and recycling deficit in DS/AD
  result from selectively impaired lysosomal degradation of cellular material. APP
  = amyloid‐β precursor protein. [Color figure can be viewed at www.annalsofneurology.org]
