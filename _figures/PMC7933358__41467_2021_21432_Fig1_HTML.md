caption: a Griseorhodin A biosynthetic gene cluster encoding, e.g., the minimal type
  II polyketide synthase (PKS), cyclases, and tailoring enzymes. b Initial steps afford
  a reactive acyl-carrier protein (ACP)-bound poly-β-ketone, which is subsequently
  cyclized and modified to 3. Compounds 3 and 11 were previously identified in the
  course of gene deletion experiments (ΔgrhO5 and ΔgrhO6, respectively, encoding flavin-dependent
  tailoring enzymes investigated in this work) and assigned as putative advanced intermediates.
  The conversion of 3 into 4 via 8 and 11 (dashed box) and additional intermediates
  was elucidated in this work. A ketoreductase (presumably GrhO10) then converts 4
  into 13. c Examples of mature rubromycins likely formed from 13.
