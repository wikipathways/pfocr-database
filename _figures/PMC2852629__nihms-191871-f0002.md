caption: Ovarian Steroid Hormone Synthesis. In premenopausal women, the ovaries are
  the principal source of E2. The first, rate-limiting step in is the transfer of
  cholesterol from the cytosol to the inner membrane of the mitochondrion with the
  aid of StAR, and the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. After side chain
  cleavage and utilizing the delta-5 or delta-4 pathway, androstenedione is the key
  intermediary. A fraction of androstenedione is directly “aromatized” to E1, which
  is subsequently converted to E2. Alternatively, androstenedione is converted to
  testosterone, which in turn undergoes conversion to E2 by aromatase. In postmenopause,
  the circulating steroids androstenedione, testosterone, and E1 become the major
  precursor substrates of E2 production in peripheral and estrogen target tissues.
