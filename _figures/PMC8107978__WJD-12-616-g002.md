caption: 'A brief scheme of the insulin signaling pathway in the presence of insulin
  resistance. Not all insulin signaling pathways are equally affected, and selective
  insulin resistance is observed. (Partial) resistance in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/serine/threonine-specific
  protein kinase B pathway results in decreased glucose uptake mediated by insufficient
  translocation of glucose transporter 4 and decreased inhibition of lipolysis and
  gluconeogenesis. Additionally, deficient activation of endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase is also observed. Insulin-resistance-associated hyperinsulinemia promotes
  anabolic cell activities via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular
  signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway and via mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
  1. In addition to the anabolic actions of signaling via the MEK/ERK pathway, there
  is also enhanced expression of plasminogen 1 and endothelin 1. The inhibition of
  nuclear factor 2 compromises cell defense mechanisms against radical stress. Dotted
  lines represent inhibition, and solid lines represent stimulation/activation. IRS:
  Insulin receptor substrate; SHC: Src homology 2 domain-containing transforming proteins;
  MEK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK: Extracellular signal-related kinase;
  PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; AKT: Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase
