caption: 'Immune response in eubiosis condition and in immuno-nutrition. Gut homeostasis
  is maintained through the cooperation between microbiota and several micronutrients,
  acting in a synergic and powerful way. Eubiosis is maintained by the specific immuno-nutrition
  (e.g., Vitamin E, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Omega-3 Fatty acid as EPA and DHA, Se, Zn,
  Cu and Nucleotides). On the other hand, gut microbiota in eubiosis condition can
  cooperate with the immune system to preserve the intestinal barrier integrity. Mucosal
  APCs and associated lymphoid tissue can promote vaccine response, through antigen
  response and binding Tregs and B lymphocytes via IL-1 and IFN-α. Tregs, activated
  also through Vitamin E and D, can block Th17 lymphocytes and the related cytokines
  storm (i.e., IL-17) and suppress inflammation. At the same time, nucleotides, Se
  and Vitamin C can stimulate B cells to become plasma cells, and produce antigen-specific
  antibodies. Inside the B cell, the main intracellular signalling pathway promoted
  by NF-kB pathway related to inflammation is blocked via RXR/PPAR-γ heterodimer.
  The intracellular defence system, sustained by ROS, is balanced through SOD1 and
  GPx activity (with binding of Cu, Zn and Se, respectively). EPA and DHA can prevent
  the lipid bilayer oxidation in cooperation with Vitamin E. Vitamin D and can promote
  with RXR the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammation gene expression through the binding
  on VDREs. Abbreviation: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA); Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA);
