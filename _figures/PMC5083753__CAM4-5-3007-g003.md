caption: Anticancer and analgesic activities of β‐caryophyllene (BCP) and β‐caryophyllene
  oxide (BCPO). BCP and BCPO induce apoptosis and suppress proliferation of cancer
  cells as well as reduce levels of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis markers. Molecular
  mechanisms of BCPO anticancer activities include activation of mitogen‐activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway as well as inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and STAT3
  signaling. Additionally, BCP(O) increase cellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic
  drugs, enhancing their anticancer effectiveness. In response to pain stimuli, BCP
  and BCPO reveal different mode of actions. BCP‐induced effect of analgesia is obtained
  with endocannabinoid system (ECS) involvement, while BCPO analgesic activity is
  ECS independent. BCP binds to peripheral cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB 2) leading
  to β‐endorphin release from keratinocytes and activation of opioid receptors. In
  contrast, antipain effects of BCPO are possibly achieved by inhibition of central
  pain receptors. Additionally, both compounds inhibit the release of inflammatory
  mediators of pain.
