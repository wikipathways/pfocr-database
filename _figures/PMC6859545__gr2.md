caption: Cysteine residues are critical mediators of the antioxidant and heat shock
  responses. A) In the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway, the KEAP1 protein is responsible for sensing
  oxidant/electrophile stress. Human KEAP1 has 27 cysteines in total, enriched in
  the IVR-domain , . Cysteine modification leads to conformational changes in KEAP1,
  resulting in disruption of KEAP1-mediated ubiquitination of NRF2 . B) There are
  seven cysteine residues in human NRF2, implicated to take part in oxidant/electrophile
  sensing . However, no studies have addressed their impact on LDE-mediated NRF2 activation.
  C) Human HSF1 contains five cysteines, two of which (C35 and C135) have been shown
  to form a dimer upon heat stress or by H2O2, . However, no studies to date have
  identified LDE targets in HSF1. D) Molecular chaperone family of HSP70s are one
  of the more abundant HSPs that regulate HSF1 , . HSP70s have five cysteines. E)
  Human HSP90α family of HSPs contain seven cysteines that are reactive towards heat
  shock and oxidative stress , .
