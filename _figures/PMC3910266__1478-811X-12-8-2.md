caption: 'NOD1 signaling and interactions with Rho GTPases and NFATc. (Left panel)
  Schematic representation of the activation of NOD1 interacting with Caspase recruitment
  domain (CARD)-containing kinase RIPK2, which leads to activation of RIPK2 and subsequent
  recruitment and activation of TAK1. The TAK1 complex then induces the polyubiquitination
  of the IKK-β kinase, degradation of the NF-κB repressor IκB, nuclear translocation
  of NF-Kb, and transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators. NOD1 stimulating agonists
  also activate JNK. The guanine exchanger SopE from salmonella activates Rho GTPase
  Rac1 and Cdc42, which form a protein complex with NOD1 and the heat shock protein
  90 (not shown). Activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 induces the activation of NOD1/RIPK2
  signaling and induction of NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory mediators. Downregulation
  of NOD1 expression by calcineurin inhibitors or silencing NFATc1 mRNA markedly impairs
  bacterial-mediated activation of PMN functions (e.g. neutrophil migration and E.
  coli phagocytic killing capacities). (Right panel) Schematic view of the NFATc activation
  pathway by cell surface receptors coupled to Ca2+ mobilization. Ca2+-dependent activation
  of calmodulin (CaM) and calcineurin B (CnB) enables CaM binding to CnA regulatory
  region, and CnA activating conformational change. Activated calcineurin then dephosphorylates
  the phosphorylation motifs of NFATc, allowing NFATc to translocate to the nucleus.
  Nuclear NFATc, in collaboration with other transcription factors (such as AP-1),
  then induce gene transcription. Calcineurin activity is inhibited by CsA or FK506,
  which binds to their intracellular immunophillin receptors. The high-affinity calcineurin-binding
  VIVIT peptides are potent blockers of NFATc. IKK: I kappa B kinase; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal
  kinases; NEMO: NF-κB essential modulator; NF-κB: nuclear factor κB; RIPK2: Receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine-protein kinase 2; TAK1: Transforming growth factor-beta-activated
  kinase 1; TCR: T cell receptor.'
