caption: 'Mechanism-based combinatorial experimental regimens aimed at disrupting
  known oncogenic cooperation pathways in ABC-DLBCLs. Targets for rational mechanism-based
  combinatorial experimental regimens are shown for ABC-DLBCL (a and b). The black
  thick lines connecting the different drug targets pathways depict established biological
  interactions and/or dependencies. The single drugs listed in (a) have either proven
  clinical activity in patients with DLBCL or are currently in clinical trials for
  patients with B-cell lymphoma, including DLBCL. Pathways in ABC-DLBCL targeted by
  rational drug combinations using drugs tested as single agent in preclinical studies
  or clinical trials are shown in (b). Bortezomib and carfilzomib inhibit the 26S
  proteasome complex thereby blocking the degradation of negative regulators of cell
  cycle progression as well as of NF-κB inhibitory protein IκBα. Lenalidomide is an
  immunomodulatory agent directly binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor
  CRBN and promoting the recruitment of its common substrates to the E3 ubiquitin
  ligase complex, thus leading to substrate ubiquitinylation and degradation [] and
  subsequent repression of IRF4, a hallmark of ABC-DLBCL cells, thereby inhibiting
  the BCR-mediated canonical NF-κB-dependent pro-survival signaling pathways [, ].
  Silvestrol inhibits RNA helicase and translation initiationfactor eIF4A thereby
  blocking translation (i.e., of oncogenic factors) []. Azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine/5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine
  (DAC/5-AZA) inhibit DNA methyltransferases (mainly DMNT1 and DMNT3) resulting in
  the re-expression of tumor-suppressor genes [, ]. Mechanism-based drug combinations
  targeting the biological interaction between MYC and BCL2 as well as MYC and the
  PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway are aimed for both GCB- and ABC-DLBCL. Adapted from REF:
