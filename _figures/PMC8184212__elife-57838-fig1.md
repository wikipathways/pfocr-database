caption: (A) CoSMO (Cooperation that is Synthetic and Mutually Obligatory) consists
  of two non-mating cross-feeding yeast strains, each engineered to overproduce a
  metabolite required by the partner strain. Metabolite overproduction is due to a
  mutation that renders the first enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway resistant to
  end-product inhibition (; ). Hypoxanthine and lysine are released by live L-H+ and
  live H-L+ cells at a per cell rate of rH and rL, respectively (), and are consumed
  by the partner at a per cell amount of cH and cL, respectively. The two strains
  can be distinguished by different fluorescent markers. (B) Win-win mutation. A pleiotropic
  win-win mutation confers a self-serving phenotype (orange) and a partner-serving
  phenotype (lavender).
papertitle: Pleiotropic mutations can rapidly evolve to directly benefit self and
  cooperative partner despite unfavorable conditions.
