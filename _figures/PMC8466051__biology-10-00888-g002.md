caption: The tumor suppressor activity of VAV1 in T cell neoplasms. (A) In human TLX+
  T-ALL, the aberrant expression of TLX proteins leads to the transcriptional repression
  of VAV1 gene and the upregulation of ICN1 signaling. See further details in main
  text. (B) The presence of VAV1 gene mutations that causes the expression of a nonfunctional
  or absent CSH3 domain might account for the deletion of the tumor suppressor pathway
  and the increase of ICN1 levels in human PTCLs. We hypothesize that the concurrent
  engagement of VAV1-dependent canonical routes and ICN1 pathways might play a critical
  role in T cell transformation. In PTCLs, VAV1 mutations are found at amino acids
  of the Ac (Tyr174), PH (Lys404), ZF (Glu556) and CSH3 (Arg798 and Arg822) domains.
  Furthermore, all the truncations and fusions are targeting the CSH3 domain (i.e.
  VAV1-MYO1F and VAV1-S100A7). VAV1 mutations in PTLCs are reviewed in []. Examples
  of deficient (unable to bind CBL-B) and gain-of-function (hyperstimulation of RAC1
  and NFAT pathways) mutations are shown as blue diamonds and red circles, respectively.
