caption: Schematic diagram of the effects of extracellular antagonists in the Wnt/β-cat
  signaling pathway during the proliferation and differentiation in human osteoblast.
  Activation of the Wnt signaling induces the expression of genes that promote cell
  proliferation. In the transition to differentiation, the expression of extracellular
  antagonists decreases Wnt signaling and promotes the expression of differentiation
  markers. During the differentiation, the upregulation of SFRP2, SFRP3, SFRP4 and
  DKK2 is observed in the Saos-2 and MG-63 cell lines. DKK3 and WIF1 are upregulated
  in MG-63 and Saos-2 respectively, while DKK4 is uniquely upregulated in the hFOB1.19
  cell line. AXIN2, anxin 2; WIF1, Wnt inhibitory factor 1; DKK, Dickkopf; SFRP, secreted
  Frizzled-related protein; Fzd, Frizzled; LRP, Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; CK1, casein kinase 1; β-cat, β-catenin;
  Tcf, T-cell specific transcription factor; Lef, lymphoid-enhancer binding factor;
  Dvl, Dishevelled.
