caption: Various extrinsic and intrinsic regulators of embryonic and adult haematopoietic
  stem cell (HSC) self-renewal have been identified in mice and humans, however, our
  knowledge of the mechanism of HSC self-renewal remain incomplete. Factors that regulate
  HSC self-renewal in adult mice have been primarily studied in bone marrow HSCs,
  whereas factors that regulate HSC self-renewal in the mouse embryo have been mainly
  studied in fetal liver HSCs, except the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) pathway,
  which has been shown to regulate HSC differentiation only in the placenta. Our knowledge
  of the exact relationships between the various self-renewal factors is often lacking,
  although protein lin28 homolog B (Lin28b), the microRNA let-7 and high mobility
  group protein HMGIC (Hmga2) are known to participate in the same embryonic HSC self-renewal
  pathway. Multiple transcription factors including Sox17 and Atf4, as well as epigenetic
  regulators such as the polycomb repressive complex 2 component histone-lysine N-methyltransferase
  Ezh2, influence gene expression to promote HSC self-renewal in the mouse embryo.
  HSC self-renewal in adulthood is also regulated within the nucleus, including by
  the epigenetic regulatory molecules methylcytosine dioxygenase Tet2, DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase
  3A (Dnmt3a), the polycomb repressive complex 1 component Ezh1, and transcription
  factors including Gfi1 and Evi1, amongst others. CD117, Scf receptor Kit; Evi1,
  Ectropic virus integration site protein 1 homolog, histone-lysine N-methyltransferase
  MECOM; GPI-80, vanin 2; ITGAM, integrin αM; Lnk, SH2B adapter protein 3; Mpl, myeloproliferative
  leukemia protein, also known as thrombopoietin receptor; Pdgfb, platelet-derived
  growth factor subunit B; Pdgfrβ, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β; Scf,
  stem cell factor (also known as Kit ligand); Spred1, sprouty-related, EVH1-domain-containing
  protein 1; transcription factors, TFs.
