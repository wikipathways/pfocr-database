caption: 'Synaptic Long-Term Potentiation: Genes differentially expressed in the NAC
  of LE vs. SD rats are significantly over represented in the synaptic long-term potentiation
  pathway. In LE rats, genes that represent the ionotropic AMPA (Gria1) and NMDA (Grin2b)
  classes of glutamate receptors exhibit significantly higher mRNA expression levels
  (red-filled shapes) compared to SD rats, as do CAMK2 and CaN (Ppp3ca). Conversely,
  genes coding for the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR (Grm5) are expressed
  at higher levels in SD compared to LE rats (green-filled shapes), as are several
  genes for enzymes in this pathway, e.g., PKA (Prkag2), PP1 (Ppp1r3c), CAMK2(b),
  P(r)KC (delta, epsilon, iota and theta subunits), and MAPK1. Adapted from Ingenuity®
  System''s database of canonical pathways for Synaptic Long-Term Potentiation. Where
  the biochemical annotation in the Ingenuity canonical pathway differs from the gene
  symbol used by Affymetrix (see  & ), the Affymetrix gene symbol is included in parentheses.'
