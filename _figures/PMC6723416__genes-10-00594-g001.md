caption: 'Proposed Amaryllidaceae alkaloid biosynthetic pathway. Abbreviations of
  enzymes for which corresponding genes have been isolated from Amaryllidaceae plants
  are written in bold-black font, whereas those isolated from other plants are written
  in bold-grey font. Reactions in the grey-shaded area represent an alternative route
  for caffeic acid synthesis. Broken arrows represent more than one biochemical reaction.
  Abbreviations: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (CYP73A1);
  4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; C3H, coumarate 3-hydroxylase
  (CYP98A3); TYDC, tyrosine decarboxylase; NBS, norbelladine synthase; N4OMT, norbelladine
  4′-O-methyltransferase; CYP96T1, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 96T1; NorRed, noroxomaritidine
  reductase and Sh/Q, shikimate/quinate.'
