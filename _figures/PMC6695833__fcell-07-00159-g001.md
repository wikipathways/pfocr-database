caption: YAP1/Hippo and wild-type p53 pathways coordinately maintain genomic stability
  in response to stress. Genomic stresses such as oncogene expression, mitotic stress
  and cytokinesis failure trigger a crosstalk between Hippo and p53 pathways leading
  to mainly p53-dependent cellular growth arrest, senescence or apoptotic transcriptional
  programs to preserve genomic integrity. Upstream Hippo pathway components, MST1/2
  and LATS1/2, modulate p53 activity through co-operation with intermediary factors
  such as ASPP1 (; ) and RASSF1A () to inhibit MDM2 E3 ligase that targets p53 for
  proteasomal degradation. Solid lines represent direct interaction and dotted line
  represents transcriptional upregulation. TF represents the diverse array of transcription
  factors such as TEAD that the Hippo pathway effector, YAP1, associates with for
  spatio-temporal control of cell fate under genomic stress.
