caption: KEGG assignments to pathways related to hydrocarbon metabolism (left) and
  relative abundance of transcripts mapping to each step (right). The height of the
  bars in the pathway diagrams represents the number of transcripts (log scale at
  upper left) summed over samples P16, P52 and NP52, whereas the colors represent
  enrichment (red) or depletion (green) in the plume samples and darker colors indicate
  statistically significant differences.
