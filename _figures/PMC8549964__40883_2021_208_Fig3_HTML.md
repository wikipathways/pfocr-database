caption: 'FTY720 induces chemokine signaling and leukocyte migration during wound
  healing after palatal injury. Representative graph of the immune system pathways
  induced by FTY720 delivery at wounded palate. Pathway analysis RNA sequencing from
  palate mucosa treated immediately after injury with or without FTY720 scaffolds
  revealed that FTY720 delivery activated the following pathways: map04062-Chemokine
  signaling pathway, map04060-Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and map04670-Leukocyte
  transendothelial migration. In the graph, the genes annotated in the orange box
  indicate that they were upregulated by FTY720 treatment'
