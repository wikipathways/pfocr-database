caption: The circRNA/MAPK signaling axis in CRC. This signaling pathway is initiated
  by the binding of activated growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF),
  to tyrosine kinase receptors on the cell surface. This causes the downstream RAS
  to increase the GTP binding state. RAS-GTP dimers recruit RAF or RAF/MEK dimers
  to the plasma membrane and promote the activation of RAF and the formation of MEK
  homologous dimers. This is followed by activation and phosphorylation of downstream
  ERKs. Finally, ERKs induce phosphorylation of transcription factors and other substrates
  to participate in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis
  in the nucleus.
