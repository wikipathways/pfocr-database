caption: Variation of metabolic fluxes during metamorphic climax. Items and arrows
  with blue, red, and cyan colors mean downregulated/decreased, upregulated/increased,
  and unchanged, respectively. The thickness of arrows is uniform, and it does not
  indicate the level of metabolic flux. Arrows in dashed lines indicates deduced adjustment
  on this metabolic pathway
