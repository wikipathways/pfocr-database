caption: 'Integrated transcriptomic and metabolome analysis provides unique insights
  into pathways that are associated with retinoblastoma. (A) Differentially accumulated
  metabolites identified in Rb vitreous were mapped onto the KEGG global metabolome
  map associated with Rb. The nodes in the figure represent metabolic compounds. Edges
  are enzymatic transformations. Highlighted nodes represent the differentially accumulated
  metabolites identified in Rb vitreous. p < 0.05, FC > 2; upregulated (in red), p
  < 0.05, FC < 2; downregulated (in green). Edges highlighted in violet represent
  the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis map in Rb. Edges highlighted in yellow represent
  the fatty acid metabolism-related enzyme map in Rb. Edges in pink represent the
  amino-acid metabolism map in Rb. Edges in green represent the pentose phosphate
  pathway enzymes in Rb. (B) Integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic interaction
  network. Circular nodes indicate differentially regulated genes identified from
  the microarray; (in green as downregulated set: p < 0.05, FC < 2; in red as upregulated
  set: p < 0.05, FC > 2. Square blue nodes indicate differentially accumulated metabolites
  from metabolomics analysis (p < 0.05). Blue square nodes indicate upregulated metabolites
  (FC > 2), and yellow square nodes indicate downregulated metabolites (FC < 2).'
