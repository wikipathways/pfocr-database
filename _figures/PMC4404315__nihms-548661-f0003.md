caption: Analogously to , species-specific predictions are shown for a portion of
  the KEGG pathway map for JAK/STAT signaling focused on the IL-6 family of cytokines.
  A. The hESC predicted JAK/STAT signaling pathway showed that Stat3 is the gene most
  correlated to self-renewal, while upstream pathway participants exhibited lower
  SRC scores and weaker connection probabilities, suggesting that cytokines other
  than the IL-6 family, or signaling cross talk, may be required for STAT3 activation
  in hESCs. B. The mESC predicted JAK/STAT signaling pathway showed a strong connection
  between Lif and its putative target, Il6st. Further, key known mouse self-renewal
  genes in this pathway, including Lif, Il6st, and Stat3 are strongly correlated to
  other self-renewal genes as indicated by SRC score.
