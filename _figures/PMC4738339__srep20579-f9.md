caption: On the one hand, activated BSK1 induces MEK2-SIPK cascade, which in turn
  activates RBOHB-dependent oxidative burst. Thus enhance plant resistance to virus.
  On the other hand, BRs activates BES1/BZR1 through BR signaling pathway, activated
  BES1/BZR1 inhibits RBOHB-dependent ROS production and promote plant growth. The
  growth-immunity trade-off depends on the relative accumulation of BES1/BZR1 induced
  by BRs.
