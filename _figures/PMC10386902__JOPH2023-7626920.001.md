caption: 'ECM stiffness-regulated mechanical signaling pathways in RPE cells. (a)
  Increased ECM stiffness leads to the generation of abnormal RPE cells. (b) The RPE
  cells are located outside the retina and attached to the choroid. (c) Increased
  ECM stiffness modulates intracellular downstream signaling molecules such as YAP/TAZ
  and F-actin through integrins and other transmembrane proteins, thereby promoting
  phosphorylation of YAP and its subsequent translocation of nuclear where it interacts
  with the TEAD family of transcription factors to form transcription complexes that
  further regulate RPE cell migration, proliferation, and contraction of target genes
  (including CTGF, collagen I, α-SMA, c-MYC) that are implicated in PVR development.
  RPE: retinal pigment epithelium. PVR: proliferative vitreoretinopathy. CTGF: connective
  tissue growth factor. α-SMA: α-smooth muscle actin. TGF-β: transforming growth factor-β'
