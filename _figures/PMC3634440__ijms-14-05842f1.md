caption: Gene regulatory networks of plant transcription factors (TFs) in plant abiotic
  stress responses and abscisic acid-dependent gene expression. (A) Drought, salt,
  osmotic stress, temperature, and ABA stress factors modulating the level and activity
  of the TF (B) and their target genes (C). ABA-dependent signaling pathway can involve
  TF phosphorylation through the PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptor []. (B) The boxes represent
  TF proteins from the model plant Arabidopsis or from different crop plants. Red
  boxes and lines show that the TF is associated with ABA-signaling. For TF and target
  genes with several names only one of the names is shown. For references and abbreviations
  used see the main text. (C) The direct target genes are divided into regulatory
  genes including TF genes and stress-responsive genes encoding functional proteins.
  The Gene Ontology (GO) molecular function term is shown as a circle with color code
  below each Arabidopsis target gene. The GO molecular function annotation was obtained
  using the Gene Ontology search tool [] at The Arabidopsis Information Resource.
  Green arrows and red bars denote TF activation and repression, respectively. Some
  target genes with no known GO-based molecular function were grouped (i.e., PR1 and
  PR5, Atrboh A and Atrboh E, SAUR20 and SAUR63, but also rice genes involved in ROS/H2O2
  homeostasis, such as OsGSTU2).
