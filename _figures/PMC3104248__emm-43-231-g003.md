caption: Signaling molecules implicated in epilepsy (see the text for the detail).
  Arrows indicate the phosphorylation events. Up- and downward arrows indicate the
  changes in the expression level or activity of particular molecules. Double arrows
  indicate the protein-protein interaction. Some interactions were induced by phosphorylation.
  (A) PIM-1 is increased in kainate model. (B) 14-3-3 interacts with BID and dissociates
  from BAD in kainate model. (C) HSP70 level is increased in kainate model. (D) AKT
  decreased BIM expression in epilepsy model. AKT is activated by PDK1 phosphorylation
  at T308 and mTORC2 phosphorylation at S473. AKT modulates molecules involved in
  apoptosiss and cell cyle as well as other molecules in the mTOR pathway. (E) Various
  protein-protein interactions with TSC1 and TSC2. When mutated, TSC1/2 lose control
  of Rheb activity. (F) AMPK and CaMKKβ are increased in kainate model, causing TSC2
  inhibition. STRADα in an epileptic condition was indicated in red. AMPK is phosphorylated
  at T172 by STRADα-MO25α-LKB1 complex. (G) GSK3β is inhibited by phosphorylation
  at S9. In lafora disease, GSK3β can not be regulated due to the mutation in laforin,
  a phosphatase. (H) Activation of ERK decrease the surface expression of Kv4.2 channels
  in kainate model. KA - kainic acid, T-Threonine, S-Serine.
