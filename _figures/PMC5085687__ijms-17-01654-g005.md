caption: 'Potential molecular mechanisms of osteoporosis in ACTH-secreting pituitary
  adenomas. A summary schematic shows the potential signalling pathways for osteoporosis
  induced by ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas. It is mediated by three actions: (1)
  excessive cortisol exerts direct inhibitory effect on osteoblasts or deregulates
  RANKL (Receptor Activator for Nuclear Factor-κB Ligand), MCSF (Macrophage Colony
  Stimulating Factor) and TGF β (Transforming Growth Factor-β) pathways; (2) SPP1,
  COL1A1, NT5E, HTRA1 and ANGPT1 genes secrete from the pituitary to target the skeletal
  system through well-known bone related pathways; (3) other bone related genes are
  also involved in this process. Up-regulated genes are coloured in red font; down-regulated
  genes are coloured in green font. Unverified genes are black. Solid line is the
  signal transduction that has been confirmed, dotted line is the signal transduction
  that requires further confirmation. These pathways refer to the literature mining
  and pathway databases. CRH, Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone; ACTH, Adrenocorticotropic
  Hormone; GR, glucocorticoid receptors; GRE, glucocorticoid-responsive elements.'
