caption: LPA-LPA1signaling contributes to the development of renal fibrosis through
  interactions between tubular epithelial cells and fibroblasts, in which LPA-LPA1signaling
  stimulates tubular epithelial cells to produce CTGF through a Gα12/13-Rho-ROCK-MRTF-SRF
  pathway, and this tubular epithelial cell-derived CTGF in turn induces fibroblast
  proliferation and αSMA expression.
