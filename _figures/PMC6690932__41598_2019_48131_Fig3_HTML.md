caption: Drug screening of the lysosomal pathway by the lysosomal-METRIQ probe. Evaluation
  of the effects of known cancer-related inhibitors against the membrane-trafficking
  pathway and lysosomal activity. HeLa Tet-On cells expressing the lysosomal-METRIQ
  probe were cultured in regular medium with Dox for 48 h and treated with each drug
  from the SCADS inhibitor library for 12 h prior to analysis. The red/green fluorescence
  ratio was measured using flow cytometry. Kenpaullone obtained from ALEXIS and Calbio
  chem is indicated with * and **, respectively. Candidate membrane trafficking or
  lysosomal activity downregulators are coloured in blue. Candidate lysosomal biogenesis
  upregulators are coloured in red.
