caption: Prooxidants and HMGB1 act in concert to stimulate TLR4. Extracellularly released
  HMGB1 due to injury can potentially activate TLR4 in an autocrine or paracrine fashion.
  TLR4 is stimulated in response to exogenous oxidants resulting in the activation
  of c-Src, which interacts with TLR4 []. Increased formation of TLR4/c-Src complex
  leads to enhanced recruitment of different cytosolic adaptor proteins including
  toll-interleukin 1 receptor adaptor protein (TIRAP) that results in c-Src/NFκB/IκBα
  coupled activation.
