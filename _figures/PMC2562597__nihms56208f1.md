caption: 'Ethylene is perceived at the endomembranes by a family of receptors (see
  inset) that share similarity to prokaryotic two-component histidine kinase receptors
  []. The receptors form higher order complexes of homodimers and heterodimers [;
  Gao et al., unpublished]. RAN1 is a P-Type ATPase copper transporter homolog []
  in the Golgi membrane [] that provides the copper cofactor for ethylene binding.
  RTE1/GR is a novel protein [,] in the Golgi and ER [] that positively regulates
  ETR1 receptor signaling in Arabidopsis [,]. In the absence of ethylene binding,
  the receptors repress ethylene responses by signaling through CTR1, a Raf-like MAPKK
  kinase that negatively regulates responses []. When ethylene binds to the receptors,
  receptor signaling is inactivated, causing the CTR1 kinase domain (KD) to be inactivated,
  allowing downstream signaling to proceed through EIN2, which has similarity to theNramp
  family of metal ion transporters []. EIN2 is a positive regulator of ethylene responses,
  and loss of EIN2 renders the plant completely insensitive to ethylene []. EIN2 regulates
  a transcriptional cascade initiated by EIN3 and EIL1, two members of a small family
  of DNA-binding proteins []. EIN3 activates ethylene responses by binding to the
  EIN3-binding site (EBS) in the promoter of ERF1 []. ERF1 encodes a transcriptional
  activator that binds to the GCC-box in the promoters of several ethylene-responsive
  genes. A key regulatory step in the pathway is the degradation of EIN3 and EIL1
  by the 26S proteasome-dependent pathway, mediated by an SCFEBF1/2 E3 ligase complex
  containing F-Box proteins EBF1 and EBF2 [–,,]. Stability of EIN3 is promoted by
  phosphorylation of T174 through a MAP kinase cascade consisting of MKK9 signaling
  to MPK3/6, whereas degradation of EIN3 is promoted by phosphorylation on T592, possibly
  through a separate MAP kinase cascade involving CTR1[]. Repression of EBF1 and EBF2
  transcription is mediated by an exoribonuclease encoded by EIN5/XRN4 [,].Inset:
  Each receptor has a transmembrane (TM) N-terminal domain, which binds ethylene with
  a copper cofactor and localizes the receptor to the endomembranes []. Subfamily
  I receptors have three TM domains. Subfamily II receptors have a fourth TM domain,
  which might serve as a signal sequence. In the cytosol, the receptor contains a
  GAF domain adjacent to a coiled coil region followed by a histidine kinase (HK)-like
  domain. In some receptors, the HK domain is fused to a receiver domain, which appears
  to have a subtle role in signaling []. The GAF domain may play a role in transmitting
  the signal between the receptors [,; Gao et al., unpublished], as well as from the
  N-terminal domain to the HK and receiver. Although the HK domain is required for
  proper signaling, protein kinase activity does not play a major role []. Subfamily
  I receptors have autokinase activity on the histidine (H) []. Subfamily II receptors
  have degenerate HK domains and possess serine/threonine protein kinase activity
  []. (Subfamily I receptor ERS1 in Arabidopsis is capable of both activities [].)'
