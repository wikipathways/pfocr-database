caption: 'a, The pathway through which 1,6-addition products may be generated by a
  multicomponent process involving a dienoate, an allene and B2(pin)2. b, Preliminary
  experiment with an achiral NHC–Cu complex demonstrates that, although inefficient,
  reactions are exceptionally γ-, group- and 1,6-selective. Screening studies to identify
  an effective chiral catalyst indicates that a different NHC ligand is optimal for
  these transformations (vs. propargyl additions). c, The alternative approach entailing
  initial synthesis of a diboryl reagent leads to lower enantioselectivity. d, The
  catalytic protocol has considerable scope. Abbreviations: pin, pinacolato; TBS,
  tert-butyldimethylsilyl.Reactions were performed under N2 under the conditions shown
  for synthesis of rac-12a (Fig. 3b). Conversions, propargyl:allenyl, 1,6-:1,4-addition
  and diastereomeric ratios (d.r.) were measured by analysis of 1H NMR spectra of
  unpurified mixtures; the variance of values estimated to be <±2%. Yields correspond
  to isolated and purified products and represent an average of at least three runs
  (±5%). Ketone 12k was obtained after oxidative work-up. See the  for experimental
  details and spectroscopic analyses.'
