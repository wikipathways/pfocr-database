caption: A schematic model suggesting the mechanistic details of the regulation of
  neurodegenerative diseases by GSK-3β. (A) Under normal conditions, the activated
  PI3K/Akt ERKs signaling pathway leads to the inactivation of GSK-3β, which suppresses
  the downstream phosphorylation of Tau and Aβ that results in positive regulation
  of cognitive signaling, such as BDNF and insulin. (B) Under pathological conditions,
  mechanical stretching increases GSK-3β activity, induces oxidative stress, and increases
  MMP. Upregulation of GSK-3β activity negatively regulates BDNF and insulin signaling
  and promotes phosphorylation events critical to the development of Aβ and Tau aggregation.
  (C) Tws119, an inhibitor of GSK-3β, improves pathological conditions by positively
  regulating BDNF and insulin signaling. Moreover, it reduces phosphorylation events
  critical to the development of Aβ and Tau aggregation. BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor; MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; and GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase
