caption: A condensed scheme for lipid biosynthesis and glycerol-mediated signaling
  in Arabidopsis leaves. De novo FA synthesis occurs exclusively in the plastids of
  all plant cells and leads to the synthesis of palmitic acid (16:0)-ACP and oleic
  acid (18:1)-ACP. These FAs enter glycerolipid synthesis either via the prokaryotic
  pathway in the inner envelope of chloroplasts or are exported out of plastids as
  CoA thioesters to enter the eukaryotic glycerolipid synthesis pathway. Desaturation
  of stearic acid (18:0)-ACP to 18:1-ACP catalyzed by the SSI2/FAB2-encoded stearoyl-ACP
  desaturase is one of the key steps in the FA biosynthesis pathway that regulates
  levels of unsaturated FAs in the cell. The 18:1-ACP generated in this reaction enters
  the prokaryotic pathway through acylation of G3P and this reaction is catalyzed
  by the ACT1-encoded G3P acyltransferase. G3P can be made via a cytosolic enzyme
  GK or via G3Pdh. Dotted line indicates that GK-derived G3P makes a minor contribution
  to the plastidal G3P pool. Desaturation of 18:1 to 18:2 and 18:3 on membrane glycerolipids
  (GL) is catalyzed by FAD6 and FAD7/FAD8-encoded desaturases, respectively, that
  are present on the plastid envelop. Esterification of the CoA group is mediated
  by acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS). CoA, Coenzyme A; Lyso-PA, acyl-G3P; SL, sulfolipid;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
