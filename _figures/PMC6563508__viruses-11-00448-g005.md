caption: Cytosolic recognition of foreign nucleic acids and activation of interferon
  stimulated genes (ISGs). (A) Domain structure of the cytosolic RNA sensors RIG-I
  and MDA5, showing the CARD signaling domain, the DExD/H-box helicase domain, and
  the C terminal domain (CTD). LGP2 lacks the CARD signaling domain. (B) Schematic
  representation of the interferon response in mammals. RIG-I and MDA5 recognize non-self
  viral RNA signatures, including the presence of a 5’ triphosphate moiety on RNA
  (3P-RNA) or long dsRNA. Upon detection of foreign nucleic acids, the CARD domains
  transduce the signal to mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) located
  at mitochondrial membranes, leading to the phosphorylation and activation interferon
  response factors (IRF) 3 and 7. Upon activation, IRF3 and IRF7 form homodimers and
  translocate to the nucleus, where they bind Interferon-Stimulated Response Elements
  (ISRE) to activate transcription of type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β). Type I
  IFNs translocate across the cell membrane, after which they signal in a paracrine
  or autocrine manner via the interferon-α/β receptor (consisting of two subunits,
  IFNAR1 and IFNAR2). This activates the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to phosphorylation
  of STAT transcription factors (signal transducer and activator of transcription).
  Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 heterodimerize, and translocate to the nucleus to
  activate expression of broad range of ISGs.
