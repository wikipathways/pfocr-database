caption: A scheme for cell migration‐inducing protein (CEMIP)‐mediated ITPR3/CaMKII/NRF2/SLC7A11
  pathway inhibits ferroptosis in detachment‐resistant prostate cancer cells. CEMIP
  interacted with ITPR3 and promoted Ca2+ leakage from the endoplasmic reticulum and
  thereby activated CaMKII. Activated CaMKII (p‐CaMKII) further promoted the phosphorylation
  of NRF2, which led to NRF2 dissociated with KEAP1 and translocated from cytoplasm
  to nucleus. NRF2 facilitated SLC7A11 transcription and led to an increase in GSH
  levels, thereby inhibits ferroptosis
