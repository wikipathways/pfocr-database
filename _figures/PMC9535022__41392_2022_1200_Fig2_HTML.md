caption: 'Mutated driver genes and downstream signal pathways in LSCC. FGFR1 amplification
  is observed in 20% of LSCC patients. FGFR1 amplifications can lead to overexpression
  of wild-type FGFR1 proteins on the cell membrane, resulting in increased sensitivity
  to FGF and the promotion of tumor growth via increased activation of four key downstream
  signaling pathways: PLCγ, PI3K-AKT, RAS-MAPK, and STAT (green). Although mutations
  in EGFR gene are relatively rare in LSCC, in certain cases of LSCC these mutations
  are responsible for constitutive ligand-independent receptor activation and downstream
  signaling, promoting cell survival and proliferation. Mitogenic signaling, including
  activation of upstream PI3K and MAPK signaling, could drive cyclin D upregulation,
  which leads to CDK4/6 activation. The phosphorylation of RB by cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes
  and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes releases E2F transcriptional factors to activate genes
  required for G1-S transition. The CDKN2A gene encodes p16INK4A and p14ARF, which
  regulate cell cycle by inhibiting CDK4/6 and CDK2, respectively. In LSCC, the inactivated
  CDKN2A caused by genomic alterations may upregulate this pathway. DAG diacylglycerol,
