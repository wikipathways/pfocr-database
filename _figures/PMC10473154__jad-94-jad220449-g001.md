caption: miRNAs associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in PD. Various miRNAs were
  involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial fission, fusion,
  mitophagy, electron transport chain by targeting key proteins like PGC-1α, LRRK2,
  PINK 1, Parkin, DJ-1, and SNCA. miRNAs in red are those that downregulate their
  respective target whereas those in green upregulate them. Green and red arrows indicate
  stimulation and inhibition of downstream pathway respectively. Created with BioRender.com.
