caption: Proposed signaling pathway of EGb 761-induced neuroprotection and neurogenesis.
  We postulate that putative neuroprotective mechanism of EGb 761 is mediated through;
  1). The first sub-mechanism is EGb 761 activates HO1 pathway and HO-1 cleaves heme
  to form biliverdin and CO. Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by
  biliverdin reductase, an antioxidant CO has the ability to bind to the iron atom
  of the heme moiety associated with soluble guanylyl cyclase, thereby activating
  the enzyme and increasing intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production.
  cGMP can regulate axon branching by converting SEMA3A from chemorepulsion to the
  chemoattraction and also by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). GSK-3
  inhibition increases the activity of CRMP-2, which leads to cell survival and cell
  neuroplasticity. 2). The second sub-mechanism is EGb 761 activates VEGF which activates
  eNOS leading to elevated NO levels that mediates the conversion of SEMA3A from chemorepulsion
  to chemoattraction and ultimately to angiogenesis. 3). The third sub-mechanism is
  through the elevation of Wnt protein which leads to the activation of Wnt/β-Catenin
  pathway subsequently displacing GSK-3 from the complex which leads to the neurogenesis.Activation
  (➝), inhibition (⊣), mutual activation (↔).
