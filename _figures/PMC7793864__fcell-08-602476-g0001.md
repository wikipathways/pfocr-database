caption: The cartoon summarizes intracellular pathways used by cancer cells to support
  increased citrate synthesis in mitochondria. This can occur through a serine pathway,
  where increased expression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) creates a diversion
  from glycolysis. PSAT1 (phosphoserine aminotransferase) reaction requires conversion
  of glutamate into αKG (α-ketoglutarate) which can be then transported into mitochondria
  by oxoglutarate carrier (OGC) and support mitochondrial citrate synthesis through
  the reverse Krebs cycle. Lactate taken up through MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter
  1) is metabolized by lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) into pyruvate imported into
  mitochondria through MPC (mitochondrial pyruvate carrier) followed by Acetyl-CoA
  synthesis which can then join the Krebs cycle. Part of glutamine pool can be metabolized
  into glutamate and transported into mitochondria through AGC1 (aspartate-glutamate
  carrier isoform 1) followed by conversion into αKG. Released into the cytoplasm
  citrate is metabolized by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) and plays a central role in fatty
  acid synthesis.
