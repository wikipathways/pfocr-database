caption: 'Reverse (reductive) TCA cycle. The rTCA cycle is a carbon dioxide fixation
  pathway found in autotrophic eubacteria and archaea. It is considered to be a primordial
  pathway for the production of starting organic molecules for the biosynthesis of
  sugars, lipids, amino acids, pyrimidines and pyrroles. The rTCA cycle is largely
  the oxidative, catabolic TCA cycle operating in reverse. Most of the enzymes of
  the TCA cycle work reversibly and could catalyse both directions. Only three steps
  are thought to be non-reversible, and thus determine the oxidative or reductive
  direction of the cycle: the conversion of citrate to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA;
  the conversion of fumarate to succinate; and the conversion of 2-ketoglutarate to
  isocitrate. The presence of such enzyme activities in autotrophically grown bacteria
  and archaea is considered indicative of the presence of the rTCA cycle in these
  organisms.'
