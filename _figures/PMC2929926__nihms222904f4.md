caption: Signaling pathway of apoptosis stimulated by PAF in corneal epithelial cells.
  Apoptosis can be induced by UV irradiation. PAF accelerates the process of releasing
  cytochrome c and activating the caspase cascade that results in early DNA fragmentation
  and apoptosis. cPLA2 activation is involved in the process. Although the mechanism
  is not known, one possibility is that AA can regulate mitochondrial permeability
  and stimulate the release of cytochrome c. The cPLA2 inhibitor MAFP blocks the effect
  of PAF on the release of cytochrome c and, as a consequence, increases the time
  of DNA fragmentation after UV exposure []. Apaf-1 apoptotic protease-activating
  factor-1
