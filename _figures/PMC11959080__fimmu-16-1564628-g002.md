caption: Subcellular localization and proposed molecular mechanisms of ZNFX1. (A)
  Under normal cellular conditions, ZNFX1 is diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm.
  When cells are subjected to varying conditions, subcellular localization of ZNFX1
  becomes altered. During dsRNA treatment, ZNFX1 localizes to the mitochondria through
  its interaction with MAVS. During arsenite treatment, ZNFX1 enriches in stress granules.
  During inflammasome activation, ZNFX1 localizes to NLRP3 inflammasomes and ASC specks.
  (B) ZNFX1 is proposed to function via three molecular mechanisms. (Left) ZNFX1 acts
  as a dsRNA sensor. It recognizes and binds intracellular viral dsRNA. Through its
  interaction with MAVS at the outer mitochondrial membrane, the downstream Type I
  interferon signaling pathway becomes activated. (Middle) ZNFX1 regulates host mRNA
  stability. It can either cause mRNA degradation as shown for several ISG mRNAs or
  promote mRNA stability in the case of Prkaa2 mRNA. (Right) ZNFX1 inhibits NLRP3
  inflammasome activation. Binding of ZNFX1 to NLRP3 could prevent NLRP3 activation
  and formation of mature NLRP3 inflammasomes with ASC and Caspase 1, thereby inhibiting
  pyroptosis
