caption: T-cell immune regulation by IDO1. (a) IDO1 is induced by IFN-γ-dependent
  and/or -independent signal pathways, depending on the variety of immune stimuli
  by macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) [, ]. IDO1 activity is suppressed by the
  formation of NO or the competitive enzyme inhibitor, 1MT. Marked increases in IDO1
  suppress immune responses by locally depleting L-TRP and preventing T-cell proliferation
  []. Expression of IDO1 has been observed in certain types of activated macrophages
  and DCs. IDO1-expressing cells deplete TRP from the extracellular milieu and secrete
  TRP metabolites, including KYN, 3-HK, 3-HAA, and QUIN, which induce T-cell apoptosis
  and suppress immune responses in vitro. (b) CD19+ plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) express
  high levels of IDO1, which can activate mature regulatory T (Treg) cells via activation
  of the protein kinase general control nonderepressing-2 (GCN2) pathway of protein
  synthesis inhibition []. pDC-produced IDO1 and activated Treg can convert naïve
  T cells into new Treg. IDO1 acts in an autocrine manner to suppress pDC production
  of IL-6, which prevents the conversion of Treg into IL-17-producing Th17 proinflammatory
  cells []. IDO1 also downregulates type I IFN (IFN-α) production by pDC [].
