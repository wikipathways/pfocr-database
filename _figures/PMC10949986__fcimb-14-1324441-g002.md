caption: Promotion of new capillary formation by integrins during wound healing. Vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces a 5- to 7-fold increase in the protein
  expression of two collagen receptors, α1β1 and α2β1 integrins, on the surface of
  dermal microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) through the induction of mRNAs encoding
  α1 and α2 integrins subunits. α5 integrin localizes to cell junctions and participates
  in the angiopoietin (Ang)/Tie2 signaling pathway to maintain vascular homeostasis.
  αvβ3 integrin synergizes with VEGF to activate angiogenesis in ECs through VEGFR-2
  phosphorylation. α6β1 integrin appears to promote platelet pro-mediated angiogenesis
  associated with endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs). VEGF-A can induce endothelial
  and cancer cell migration by directly binding α9β1 integrin. By Figdraw
