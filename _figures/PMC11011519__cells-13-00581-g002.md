caption: In response to damage, astrocytes are characterized by the activation of
  inflammatory pathways, including NF-κB. This leads to increased expression of components
  like complement component expression (C1r, C1s, C3, and C4), contributing to synaptic
  damage. They also express inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, tumour necrosis
  factor α (TNF-α), and IL-6. These astrocytes exhibit hyperphosphorylation and activation
  of the STAT pathway, typically in response to injury. Additionally, the inhibition
  of the anti-inflammatory phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K-Akt) pathway in these
  cells results in decreased expression of neurotrophic factors, which contributes
  to synaptic loss and apoptosis.
