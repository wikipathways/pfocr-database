caption: Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and their signalling pathways. The recognition
  of foreign particles is initiated by PRR binding to pathogen‐associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) unique to microbes. Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) recognize a wide
  range of bacterial, fungal and viral ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), glycoproteins
  and nucleic acids. Ligand binding to a TLR activates a signalling cascade that is
  mediated by the adaptor proteins myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)
  or TIR‐domain‐containing adapter‐inducing interferon‐β (TRIF). The signalling cascade
  ultimately leads to the activation of transcription factors that induce the expression
  of proinflammatory cytokines (MyD88‐ and TRIF‐dependent signalling) or type I interferons
  (TRIF‐dependent signalling). The CLR family is composed of receptors such as Dectin‐1,
  Dectin‐2, mannose receptor (MR), dendritic cell‐specific ICAM‐3‐grabbing non‐integrin
  (DC‐SIGN), macrophage inducible C‐type lectin (Mincle) and MBL, which recognize
  carbohydrate molecules on fungal cells. Ligand binding leads to the phosphorylation
  of CLRs by spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) which then drives a signalling cascade involving
  the caspase recruitment containing protein 9 (CARD9)–B‐cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10)–mucosa‐associated
  lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) complex. Foreign agents are
  also recognized by molecules such as IgG and Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL) that bind
  and opsonize the pathogen promoting efficient host cell recognition and clearance
  through Fc γ receptors and the complement pathway, respectively. Figure created

  description: Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and their signalling pathways.
    The recognition of foreign particles is initiated by PRR binding to pathogen‐associated
    molecular patterns (PAMPs) unique to microbes. Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) recognize
    a wide range of bacterial, fungal and viral ligands such as lipopolysaccharide
    (LPS), glycoproteins and nucleic acids. Ligand binding to a TLR activates a signalling
    cascade that is mediated by the adaptor proteins myeloid differentiation primary
    response 88 (MyD88) or TIR‐domain‐containing adapter‐inducing interferon‐β (TRIF).
    The signalling cascade ultimately leads to the activation of transcription factors
    that induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (MyD88‐ and TRIF‐dependent
    signalling) or type I interferons (TRIF‐dependent signalling). The CLR family
    is composed of receptors such as Dectin‐1, Dectin‐2, mannose receptor (MR), dendritic
    cell‐specific ICAM‐3‐grabbing non‐integrin (DC‐SIGN), macrophage inducible C‐type
    lectin (Mincle) and MBL, which recognize carbohydrate molecules on fungal cells.
    Ligand binding leads to the phosphorylation of CLRs by spleen tyrosine kinase
    (SYK) which then drives a signalling cascade involving the caspase recruitment
    containing protein 9 (CARD9)–B‐cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10)–mucosa‐associated lymphoid
