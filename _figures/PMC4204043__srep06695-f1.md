caption: The synthetic pathway from glycerol to 3,4-DHPAA has been previously reported.
  In the previous system, norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) was used for THP synthesis.
  However, this system was constructed without NCS as described in the Discussion.
  The (R,S)-THP synthetic pathway employed two strains, dopamine production strain
  (red blanket) and monoamine oxidase expression strain (blue blanket). AroGfbr, feedback-inhibition-resistant
  (fbr) 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase; TyrAfbr, fbr-chorismate
  mutase/prephenate dehydrogenase; PpsA, phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase; TktA, transketolase;
  TYR, tyrosinase of Ralstonia solanacearum; DODC, DOPA decarboxylase of Pseudomonas
  putida; MAO, monoamine oxidase of Micrococcus luteus.
