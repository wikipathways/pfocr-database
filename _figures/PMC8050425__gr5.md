caption: Schematic representation of Can1 and Mup1 endocytic pathways triggered by
  distinct signals. (A) Substrate-dependent downregulation of Can1 and Mup1. Under
  substrate starvation conditions (absence of arginine for Can1 and absence of methionine
  for Mup1), both Can1 and Mup1 preferentially localize at MCCs, presumably more populated
  in an OF conformation. Inside these domains, Can1 and Mup1 are protected from ubiquitylation
  machinery , , . Low arginine/methionine concentrations maintain the inactive state
  of TORC1, stimulating Npr1 kinase, which, in turn, will phosphorylate Lbd19, leading
  to its inhibition , , . If arginine/methionine is added, these AAs stimulate the
  TORC1/Npr1 pathway, which, in turn, leads to the formation of Ldb19/Art1-Rsp5 complexes.
  In parallel, the transport cycles of these AAs induce a transient shift of the transporters
  conformation, resulting in the diffusion of the transporter away from MCCs , , .
  The IF conformation of these transporters exposes the N-terminal binding sites (degron)
  for Ldb19 adaptor, leading ultimately to Can1 and Mup1 ubiquitylation and subsequent
  degradation in the vacuole , . (B) Starvation-induced downregulation of Can1 and
  Mup1. Under AAs or N starvation conditions, the GAAC pathway upregulates the ECM21/ART2
  gene by the action of Gcn4 transcriptional regulator, which causes an increase in
  Ecm21 protein levels and allows the subsequent formation of Ecm21-Rsp5 complexes.
  Ecm21-Rsp5 will then ubiquitylate Can1 and Mup1 transporters, inducing their endocytosis
  and degradation via the MVB pathway. Gcn4 also induces transcription of genes involved
  in de novo biosynthesis of AAs in order to keep AA homeostasis. Under rich growth
  conditions, ECM21 transcription is strongly inhibited, which results in a decrease
  in the formation of Ecm21-Rsp5 complexes. Moreover, DUBs also appear to play a role
  in modulating Ecm21 activity, as already described for other transporters. PM, plasma
