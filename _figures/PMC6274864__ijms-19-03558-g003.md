caption: 'The role of AMPK in class IIa histone deacetylases traffic in rat soleus
  muscle at the initial stages of gravitational unloading (modified from []). (A):
  active muscle; (B): inactive muscle. Time-course studies on the MyHCI (β) expression
  demonstrate that a reduction in MyHCI (β) mRNA expression begins on the first day
  of unloading and then steadily decreases during, at least, two weeks of hindlimb
  unloading [,]. As shown in dominant-negative AMPK mutants, AMPK has no effect on
  the expression of slow MyHC after 14-day unloading []. It is clear that an experiment
  with transgenic animals does not allow for tracing the effect of AMPK on the expression
  of MyHC at the different time-points of unloading. However, the results of this
  experiment indicate that the decrease in the expression of slow isoform of MyHC
  after the completion of the initial stage of hindlimb unloading is determined not
  by AMPK, but by some other mechanisms, for example, via inhibition of the calcineurin/
  Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling pathway [,].'
