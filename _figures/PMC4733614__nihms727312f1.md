caption: (A) TCR engagement initiates PD-1 transcription through NFATc1 binding at
  the 5’ promoter region of PD-1. Transcriptional activity is prolonged by sustained
  stimulation of interferon-α in the context of chronic infection or tumor through
  association of IFN-responsive factor 9 (IRF9) with the IFN stimulation response
  element within the PD-1 promoter. Upon PD-1 engagement, SHP1/2 are recruited and
  dephosphorylate downstream members of the TCR signaling pathway (e.g. CD3δ and ZAP70)
  disrupting the normal TCR response as well as inhibiting PKCθ, RAS-Erk, and PI3K–Akt
  signaling. Consequently, PD-1 activation reduces the stability of the immunological
  synapse as well as the level of T cell survival proteins and leads to impaired cell
  growth and effector function. (B) In B cells, the recruitment of SHP-2 reduces the
  tyrosine phosphorylation levels of key signal transducers including the Igβ, Syk,
  PLCγ, vav, and PI3K pathways, thus suppressing BCR-mediated growth retardation,
  Ca2+ mobilization, and antibody secretion.
