caption: Targeting the cell cycle in breast cancer. (a) Cell cycle vulnerabilities
  of HR+ breast tumours. The Rb/E2F/CDK4/6 pathway is generally competent in HR+ breast
  cancers, making these cells dependent on CDK4/6 for progression through the restriction
  point. In such cells with intact Rb, CDK4/6 inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest
  in G0/G1. (b) Potential mechanisms of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in HR+ breast
  cancers. To overcome resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition, cells acquire molecular alterations
  that enable them to bypass the restriction point and uncouple their dependency on
  CDK4/6 activity for cell cycle progression. (c) Cell cycle vulnerabilities of TNBC
  tumours. TNBC tumours are typically TP53 mutant, highly aneuploid, and often exhibit
  centrosome amplification. These features make TNBC cells susceptible to the induction
  of further, intolerable, aneuploidy and multipolar spindle formation. TTK and PLK4
  inhibitors potentiate genomic instability and chromosome segregation errors in mitosis
  leading to cell death. (d) Potential mechanisms of resistance to TTK inhibition
  in TNBC. Gatekeeper mutations in TTK and delay of mitotic exit through impaired
  function of the APC/C have been demonstrated to confer resistance to TTK targeting
  drugs. Blue arrows/type indicate DNA amplification or activating mutations. Dashed
  lines indicate loss of activity/function. * indicates a gatekeeper mutation. Cell
  cycle checkpoints are indicated in red.
