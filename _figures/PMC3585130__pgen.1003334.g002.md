caption: '(A) SGA database (DRYGIN). Genetic interaction profiles among DPH1, DPH2,
  DPH4, DPH5, YBR246w and YLR143w query gene deletion strains and 3885 or 4457 array
  ORF mutants were extracted from data for a total of ∼1700 query strains deposited
  at DRYGIN (for full details, see excel spread sheet in ). Ranking of top interactors
  for each query ORF was according to PCC (Pearson correlation coefficient) determination.
  For simplicity, array ORFs DPH1, DPH2, DPH4, DPH5, EFT1, EFT2 (shown in bold) as
  well as potentially diphthamide related candidate loci YLR143w and YBR246w (red
  circles) are listed that score repeatedly as significantly high interactors of the
  query ORFs. (B) Yeast Fitness database (FitDB). Genes whose deletions phenocluster
  with the six query ORFs above were extracted from FitDB, which is based on genome-scale
  co-fitness defect analysis of homozygous yeast deletion mutants in response to greater
  than 1144 different conditions. For simplicity, the top ten interactors for three
  of the six query genes (DPH5, YLR143w and YBR246w: pale blue central nodes) above
  are depicted. (C) Representation of the tightly clustered and expanded DPH1-DPH7
  gene network where nodes (pale blue) correspond to individual DPH gene family members
  and edges connect gene pairs by PCC>0.14. Enhanced gene interaction strength is
  proportional to PCC stringency. Enriched GO process likelihoods in the diphthamide
  modification pathway are listed as P-values for the identified candidates DPH6/YLR143w
  and DPH7/YBR246w.'
