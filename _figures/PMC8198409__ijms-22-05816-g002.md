caption: SAP signalling and DGKα inhibition. Upon TCR stimulation, the adaptor protein
  SAP binds to ITSMs sequences on the cytoplasmic tail of the SLAM-family and other
  receptors, competing with SHIP and SHP-1/2 phosphatases and promoting activator
  signals. At the membrane, SAP interacts with different binding partners, such as
  the FYN Kinase, PKCθ and NCK1, involved in T-cell activation. Moreover, SAP mediates
  the inhibition of DGKα, resulting in an accumulation of PLCγ-derived DAG, leading
  to MAPK pathway activation, pro-apoptotic molecules expression and cytokines production.
  Furthermore, the increased levels of DAG enhance PKCθ activity resulting in signalling
  which potentiates NFκB activation. In antigen-experienced CD8+ cells, these events
  trigger the RICD program, which promotes effector T-cells clearance and prevents
  excessive lymphoproliferation.
