caption: 'Enzymes are indicated by capital letters; red color indicates transcripts
  that were up-regulated in ECM roots compared with non-symbiotic roots. Green indicates
  down-regulated transcripts. Numbers in brackets indicate the number of differentially

  not yet fully understood. Grey box indicates transcriptional regulators. Abbreviations
  are as follows: AGT anthocyanidin -o-glucosyltransferase, ANR anthocyanidin reductase,
  CHS chalcone synthase, C4H cinnamate 4- hydroxylase, 4CL 4-coumarate-CoA ligase,
  DFR dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, F3 H flavanone 3b-hydroxylase, F3′H flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase,
  FST flavonol sulphotransferase, FGT flavonol glucosyltransferase, GST glutathione
  S transferase, LAC laccase-like, LDOX leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, OMT O-methyltransferase,
  tannin R2R3 MYB TF tannin-related R2R3 MYB transcription factor, V-type H+ ATPase
  encoding a vacuolar proton pump that supports MATE antiporter, TT12 transparent
  testa 12 enconding a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion-type (MATE) transporter,
