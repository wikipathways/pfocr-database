caption: A schematic diagram for the hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. Ligands, such
  as Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Indian Hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh), are secreted
  by signaling cells and bind the transmembrane receptor patched (Ptch) in HH responding
  cells. In the absence of ligands, Ptch binds to Smoothened (Smo) and blocks Smo's
  function, whereas this inhibition is relieved in the presence of ligands, and Smo
  initiates a signaling cascade that results in the release of transcription factors
  Glis from cytoplasmic proteins fused (Fu) and suppressor of fused (SuFu). In the
  inactive situation, SuFu prevents Glis from translocating to the nucleus; in the
  active situation, Fu inhibits SuFu and Glis are released. Gli proteins translocate
  into the nucleus and control target gene transcription. The red lines and the agents
  in red show the inhibitors of this pathway with potential therapeutic value.
