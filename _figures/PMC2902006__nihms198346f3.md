caption: Excitatory projections represented by ⊕, inhibitory projections represented
  by ⊖, with the size of these symbols representing the relative effect of each projection
  on the synapsing nuclei. Nuclei are represented by circles or ovals, with solid
  colored circles and ovals reflecting those with normal populations of neurons, and
  speckled circles and ovals reflecting those with significantly reduced populations
  of neurons. An X reflects ablation of a nucleus. The relative tonic influences of
  each projection are represented by line thickness, with thicker lines depicting
  stronger influences, thinner lines depicting weaker influences, and dashed and dotted
  lines depicting weak influences due to damage to neurons in the respective nuclei.
  The REM-off region is represented by the vlPAG and LPT in red, and the REM-on region
  is represented by the PC and SLD in green. The SLD (or analogous nucleus in humans)
  projects to spinal interneurons (“direct route,” denoted by the dotted line from
  SLD to spinal interneurons) and likely represents the final common pathway that
  causes active inhibition of skeletal muscle activity in REM sleep. The “indirect
  route,” denoted by the dashed line from SLD to the MCRF to the spinal interneurons,
  may also contribute to EMG atonia. However, in humans, it is not yet known whether
  lesions in structures which project to and from the MCRF, and lesioning the MCRF
  itself, are critical in affecting EMG atonia during REM sleep. EMG=electromyographic,
  eVLPO= extended part of the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, LC=locus coeruleus,
  LDTN=laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, LPT=lateral pontine tegmentum, MCRF=magnocellular
  reticular formation, PC=pre-coeruleus, PPN=pedunculopontine nucleus, REM=rapid eye
  movement, RN=raphe nucleus, SLD=sublaterodorsal nucleus, vlPAG=ventrolateral part
  of the periaqueductal grey matter. See text for details. From Boeve et al, Brain
