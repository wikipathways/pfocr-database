caption: (A) silencing of PVT1 represses proliferation and decreases cyclin D1 expression
  through reducing recruitment of EZH2 and modulating TSHR; (B) down-regulated PTCSC3
  promotes cell growth and inhibits apoptosis; (C) BANCR overexpression inhibits cell
  proliferation and invasion, and induces apoptosis through inactivation of ERK and
  p38 in PTC cell lines (TPC-1, K1, and BCPAP); (D) FAL1 can reduce the expression
  of CDKN1A via binding to BMI1, thus promoting proliferation and migration; (E) NEAT1
  promotes migration and invasion, as well as increases the expression of β-catenin
  through the reduction of miR-214; (F) downregulation of NAMA inhibits apoptosis
  via modulating Raf- MEK-ERK signaling pathway; (G) down-regulated GAS8-AS1 promotes
  cell viability; (H) MALAT1 promotes proliferation and invasion by up-regulating
  the expression of IQGAP1 in FTC.
