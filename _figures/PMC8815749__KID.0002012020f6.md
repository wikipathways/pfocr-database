caption: Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) as the integrator of energy available to the
  fetus, coordinating organ development. At low oxygen tension, HIF-1α escapes degradation
  and initiates a cascade of signaling steps resulting in transcription of hypoxia-response
  element–containing genes. Energy delivery to the fetus can be reduced by maternal
  nutritional insufficiency, hypoxia due to maternal smoking, or increased hemoglobin-oxygen
  affinity resulting from gestational diabetes (). Maternal smoking also impairs fetal
  mitochondrial biogenesis via hypermethylation of PGC1α, leading to impaired nephrogenesis
  (). The HIF pathway represents an integrated signaling system that coordinates fetal
  cellular development with environmental stimuli by modulating metabolism to coordinate
  allocation of energy between processes occurring at multiple levels (cells, organs,
  organisms) through time (fetal development, life cycle, and across generations).
  The output of this process is manifested as trade-offs in fetal organ development.
  In human fetal kidneys of 14–24 weeks gestation, HIF-1α is expressed in glomeruli
  and collecting ducts, whereas HIF-2α is present in interstitial and peritubular
  cells (). After completion of nephrogenesis (33 weeks), both isoforms of HIF are
  undetectable, consistent with a regulatory role for oxygen tension in nephrogenesis.
  In fetuses subjected to maternal smoking, kidney growth is stimulated between 23
  and 27 weeks gestation, then markedly slowed through 32 weeks (a period of maximal
  nephrogenesis) (,). By contrast, cardiac growth in fetuses of smoking mothers is
  suppressed at 23–27 weeks, but increases by 32 weeks (). These adaptive changes
  are likely driven by HIF stimulating early renal erythropoietin (EPO) production
  and later cardiac hypertrophy. NOS, nitric oxide synthase; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor.
