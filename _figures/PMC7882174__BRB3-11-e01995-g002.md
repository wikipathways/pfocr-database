caption: Potential role of leonurine in cardiovascular disease. Leonurine can treat
  cardiovascular disease by anti‐atherosclerosis, reducing myocardial infarction and
  cardioprotective effects. It plays a strong protective role through a wide range
  of mechanisms. In atherosclerosis, leonurine plays an important role in reducing
  hypercholesterolemia through antioxidant stress and anti‐inflammation, which is
  of great significance to the treatment of AS. In myocardial infarction, leonurine
  activated PI3K/Akt signal pathway, down‐regulated the expression of Bax and Fas,
  and up‐regulated the expression of Bcl‐2 and Bcl‐xL. At the same time, leonurine
  promoted myocardial contraction and angiogenesis by up‐regulating mTOR/ERK signal
  pathway. In addition, leonurine also has cardioprotective effects by reducing calcium
  overload and anti‐apoptosis effects
