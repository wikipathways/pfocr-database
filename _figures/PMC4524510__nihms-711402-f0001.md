caption: The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is usually caused by disruption of
  mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9,
  and subsequent activation of downstream caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8 and -10, which
  eventually leads to apopto sis. On the other hand, caspase-dependent apoptosis induced
  by death receptor ligation (e.g., Fas ligand/Fas or TNF-α/TNF- α receptor) can function
  independently of the mitochondria by caspase-8 activation, which directly activates
  caspase-3, -6 and -7, or by causing proteolytic cleavage of the pro-apoptotic protein
  Bid to a truncated form (tBid), which in turn is inserted in the mitochondrial membrane
  and induces release of cytochrome c. Release of the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF)
  from mitochondria causes caspase-independent apoptosis.
