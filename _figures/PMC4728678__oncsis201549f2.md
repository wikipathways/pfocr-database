caption: Lipid rafts as platforms for cell signaling. (a) Lipid rafts are formed by
  a phospholipid bilayer enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids and resident signaling
  proteins (AKT) and receptors (GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; RTK, receptor tyrosine
  kinase including growth factor receptor (GFR); CXCR4, C-X chemokine receptor 4).
  Once activated by their respective ligands, the receptors recruit different signaling
  effectors that promote cell survival, cell migration and cell invasion, all of which
  contribute toward tumor growth. (b) Aggregation of death receptors (DR4/DR5, Fas)
  in lipid rafts forms CASMERs. Recruitment of CASMERs in a restricted space enhances
  fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD)/Caspase-8 death signaling pathway
  when compared with apoptotic signal induced by the activation of non-clustered death
  receptors.
