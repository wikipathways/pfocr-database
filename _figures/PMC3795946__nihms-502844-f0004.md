caption: Illustration showing a Gi/o protein coupled receptor (GPCR; green) inhibiting
  presynaptic CaV2.2 channels (blue) by different signaling mechanisms. The GPCR is
  activated by neurotransmitter released from a neighboring neuron. Following activation,
  the G dimer dissociates from Gi/o, binds to and directly inhibits both CaV2.2 channel
  splice isoforms (e37a (orange) and e37b (pink)). A second G protein-dependent pathway,
  that requires src tyrosine kinase (TK) activation but that is independent of G,
  inhibits e37a-CaV2.2. This schematic is based on data published in [] []. A prediction
  that follows from these studies is that e37a-CaV2.2 channels, that are more distant
  from GPCRs, will not be inhibited by membrane delimited G but may still be inhibited
  by src TK. This is because the latter mechanism involves a diffusible second messenger.
