caption: 'Diagrammatic representation of endocrine and paracrine effects of GH on
  mitogenesis, angiogenesis and apoptosis, either directly or by synergy with other
  growth factors. GH stimulates both IGF-I and IGBP3 []. While IGF-I and IGFBP proteases
  favors cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis [, , ], IGFBP3 [] and IGF-II receptors
  [] act in the opposite direction, via an IGF-independent pathway. The result of
  these opposed forces in a tissue-specific environment might be critical for normal
  and abnormal cell growth []. Dotted lines: inhibition. Continuous line: stimulation.Adapted
  from Ref. [, ]'
