caption: Overview of SENP functions in heart failure and cardiac ischemia-reperfusion
  injury. Hypertrophic stimuli induce SENP1 in a calcineurin/NFAT3-dependent manner
  in the failing heart. SENP1 deSUMOylates and thereby activates the MADS-box transcription
  factor MEF2C facilitating PGC1-α expression, whereas the transcriptional activity
  of PGC1-α is directly enhanced by SENP1. Hyperactivation of PGC1-α leads in turn
  to deregulated mitochondrial biogenesis and loss of the sarcomeric structure. Moreover,
  decreased SUMOylation of SERCA2a reduces enzyme stability and activity thereby worsening
  cardiac contractility in heart failure. Hypertrophic stimuli, by regulating various
  SENPs, may also change the balance between SUMO1- and SUMO2/3-modified DRP1, with
  SUMO1-DRP1 oligomerizing on the outer mitochondrial membranes thereby creating an
  ER-mitochondrial platform for recruitment of pro-apoptotic factors, ultimately leading
  to apoptosis. In contrast, SUMO2/3-DRP1 gets removed from mitochondria thereby protecting
  the cells from apoptosis. Hypertrophic stimuli also induce the stabilization of
  PML nuclear bodies (PML-NB) leading to p53 activation and subsequent apoptosis,
  accompanied, on the other hand, by TGF-β release and cardiac fibrosis. In contrast,
  RNF4, the SUMO-targeted E3 ubiquitin ligase exerts a protective effect through ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation of PML or other polySUMOylated targets. In cardiac ischemia/reperfusion
  (I/R) injury, SENP1 deSUMOylates and stabilizes Hif-1α, an important protective
  factor promoting cardiomyocyte survival. SENP2 removes SUMO2/3 from Akt rendering
  the Akt pathway less active in cardiomyocytes. Thus, SENP2 inhibition promotes cardiac
  de-differentiation, proliferation and angiogenesis via the activation of β-catenin,
  cyclin D1 and VEGF signaling, respectively. The activity of redox-sensitive SENP3
  is regulated in I/R but the specific cardiac targets of SENP3 remain to be clarified.
  Notably, RNF4 is induced by I/R and counteracts apoptosis most likely by affecting
  the PML-p53 axis. DJ-1 (also known as PARK7), a cytoprotective factor also induced
  in I/R, shifts the balance toward SUMO2/3-DRP1 via SENP5 inhibition, thereby preventing
  mitochondrial fission and subsequent apoptosis.
