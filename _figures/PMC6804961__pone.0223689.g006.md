caption: The 2D cell culture environment and 3D cell culture environment reacted to
  rapamycin and BCG treatment, and there were strong differences. The mTOR signal
  pathway was more highly blocked by rapamycin in 2D than in 3D. The secretion of
  IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ, which are antitumor cytokines, due to BCG was also increased
  more in 2D than in 3D, resulting in an enhanced antitumor effect on bladder cancer
  cells. This indicates that our model confirms the secretion of E-cadherin and N-cadherin
  and shows the difference in drug resistance according to the difference in the intensity
  of cell-to-cell interaction. The results provide a rationale for evaluating drugs
  using the 3D cell culture environment.
