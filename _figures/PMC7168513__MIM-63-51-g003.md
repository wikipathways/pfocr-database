caption: 'Crosstalk between enveloped RNA virus infection and STING dependent signal
  activation. Schema showing the viral RNA‐sensing immune response via the cytosolic
  DNA‐sensing pathway. Upon RNA virus infection, RNA helicase RIG‐I directly recognizes
  viral RNA and activates IFN production through interaction with mitochondrial adaptor
  IPS‐1. (a) STING may also associate with signaling complex of RIG‐I and IPS‐1, promoting
  triggering of the antiviral response in cells upon RNA virus infection (23). (b)
  Enveloped RNA viruses such as IAV, NDV and Sendai virus activate IFN production
  through a viral envelope‐mediated fusion process in a STING‐dependent but cGAS‐independent
  manner; however, the molecular mechanism of signal transduction is yet to be clarified
  (97). As shown in Figure 2, the hemagglutinin fusion peptide of IAV may also associate
  with STING via its dimerization interphase domain, thereby inhibiting STING‐dependent
  signal activation. Abbreviations: FP, fusion peptide'
