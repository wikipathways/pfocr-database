caption: (A) Schematic of the mechanism by which degradable Mg@PEG-PLGA hydrogel effectively
  promotes osteoplastic bone regeneration. Figure is licenced under CC by-NC-ND 4.0.
  [121]. (B) The Mg-@PEg-PLga hydrogel exerts significant anti-inflammatory effects
  by modulating macrophage polarization and inhibiting the IκBα/NF-κB pathway. Figure
  is licenced under CC by-NC-ND 4.0 [121]. (C) Hydrogen inhibits NF-κB by clearing
  the ROS BB and MAPK signalling pathways and then downregulates the expression of
  inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, MMP-13, etc). Adapted and reproduced from Ref.
