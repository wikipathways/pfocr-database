caption: The cPLA2α-eicosanoid axis. (A) The role of cPLA2α in generation of PGD2
  and LTs in IgE/antigen (Ag)-activated mast cells. Following FcεRI-dependent signaling
  that is linked to STIM1/ORAI1-driven Ca2+ influx, cPLA2α translocates from the cytosol
  to the perinuclear, Golgi and ER membranes, where several downstream eicosanoid-biosynthetic
  enzymes are also located. The activity of cPLA2α is augmented by phosphorylation
  at Ser505 by MAPKs, Ser727 by MAPK-activated protein kinases (MAPKAPKs), and possibly
  other kinases. The AA released from AA-containing phospholipids (PL-AA) by cPLA2α
  is then metabolized into PGD2via the COX pathway involving COX-1 (or COX-2 if it
  is induced) and H-PGDS and into LTB4 and LTC4via the 5-LOX pathway involving 5-LOX
  (which also translocates from the cytosol to the perinuclear membrane in response
  to Ca2+), FLAP (a cofactor that presents AA to 5-LOX), LTA4H and LTC4S. Alternatively,
  cPLA2α-generated alkyl-LPC is acetylated by LPCAT2 to PAF. These reactions occur
  independently of degranulation and cytokine induction.
