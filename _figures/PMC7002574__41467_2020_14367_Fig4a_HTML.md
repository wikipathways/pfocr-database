caption: 'a Network of functional interactions between PID-C and PID-N genes. Nodes
  represent PID-C and PID-N genes and edges show functional interactions from the
  ReactomeFI network (gray), physical protein–protein interactions from the BioGRID
  network (blue), or interactions recorded in both networks (purple). Node color indicates
  PID-C genes (green), PID-N genes (yellow), or both PID-C and PID-N genes (orange);
  node size is proportional to the score of the gene; and the pie chart diagram in
  each node represents the relative proportions of coding and non-coding mutations
  associated with the corresponding gene. Dotted outlines indicate clusters of genes
  with roles in chromatin organization and cell proliferation, which predominantly
  contain PID-C genes; development, which includes comparable amounts of PID-C and
  PID-N genes; and RNA splicing, which contains PID-N genes. A core cluster of genes
  with many known drivers is also indicated. b Pathway modules containing PID-C and
  PID-N genes. Each row in the matrix corresponds to a PID-C or PID-N gene, and each
  column in the matrix corresponds to a pathway module enriched in PID-C and/or PID-N
  genes (see the Methods section). A filled entry indicates a gene (row) that belongs
  to one or more pathways (column) colored according to gene membership in PID-C genes
  (green), PID-N genes (yellow), or both PID-C and PID-N genes (orange). A dark colored
  entry indicates that a PID-C or PID-N gene belongs to a pathway that is significantly
  enriched for PID-C or PID-N genes, respectively. A lightly colored entry indicates
  that a PID-C or PID-N gene belongs to a pathway that is significantly enriched for
  the union of PID-C and PID-N genes, but not for PID-C or PID-N genes separately.
  Enrichments are summarized by circles adjacent each pathway module name and PID
  gene name. Boxed circles indicate that a pathway module contains a pathway that
  is significantly more enriched for the union of the PID-C and PID-N genes than the
  PID-C and PID-N results separately. The enriched modules and PID genes are clustered
  into four biological processes: chromatin, development, proliferation, and RNA splicing
  as indicated.'
