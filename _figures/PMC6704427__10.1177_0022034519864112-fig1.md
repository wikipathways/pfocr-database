caption: Genetic abnormalities in HNSCC contribute to poor tumor immunogenicity. Aberrant
  signaling resulting from genes controlling processes, ranging from self-renewal
  to metabolism, can lead to deficits in cancer immunogenicity. The transcription
  factor SOX2 has been recently implicated in negatively regulating IFN-I-mediated
  antitumor immune responses by promoting the autophagosome-mediated degradation of
  the endoplasmic reticulum–resident protein STING, leading to decreased immune infiltration.
  PIK3CA is commonly coamplified with SOX2 in HNSCC, leading to the activation of
  the mTOR pathway, which reduces CTL infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.
  CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; HNSCC, head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma;
  IFN, interferon; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PD-1, programmed cell death
  protein 1; TCR, T-cell receptor.
