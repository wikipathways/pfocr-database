caption: Schematic illustration of the role of JLP in peritoneal fibrosis. PD treatment
  results in the release of large amounts of TGF-β from peritoneal mesothelial cells.
  Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by phosphorylation and form complexes in response
  to TGF-β stimulation and translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription
  of target genes in collaboration with various co-activators and co-repressors. The
  TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway plays a critical role in peritoneal fibrosis and promotes
  the deposition of ECM, EMT, autophagy, and apoptosis which involves the regulation
  of peritoneal fibrosis. JLP deficiency aggravates peritoneal fibrosis induced by
  HGPDS. JLP plays a protective role in peritoneal fibrosis by negatively regulating
  the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, EMT, autophagy, and apoptosis.
