caption: 'Protein-to-protein subnetworks involved in prolactin, leptin, BDNF, and
  neurotrophin signaling pathways in CD4+ lymphocytes. Note: The color of the nodes
  represents the magnitude of differences in protein expression levels between lithium
  non-responders and responders at the baseline as measured with the log2⁡(the average of MFR of Respondersthe average of MFR of Non-Responders).
  A positive value is indicative of a higher level of protein expression in lithium
  responders relative to non-responders. A negative value is indicative of a lower
  level of protein expression in lithium responders relative to non-responders. The
  white nodes are proteins that were not measured in the current study, but they are
  on the shortest paths between pairs of proteins that are included in the study.
