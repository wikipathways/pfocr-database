caption: The interplay between the PI3K/AKT pathway and circadian rhythm regulators.
  There is a bilateral association between circadian rhythm and the PI3K/AKT signalling
  pathway. Phosphorylation of BMAL1 and CLOCK by AKT inhibits their entry into the
  nucleus. GSK3 inhibition by AKT leads to indirect reduction of BMAL1 degradation.
  BMAL1:CLOCK complex induces AKT activity by mediating activation of PDK1. BMAL1,
  brain and muscle Arnt‐like protein 1; CLOCK, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput;
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol‐3‐kinase
