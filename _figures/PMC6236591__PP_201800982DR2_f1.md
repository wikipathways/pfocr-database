  description: Plastid-to-nucleus signaling mechanisms defined by the gun mutants.
    A, Model for GUN-dependent plastid signaling. The gun mutants define three interacting
    plastid-to-nucleus signaling mechanisms that regulate the expression of Lhcb genes.
    When chloroplasts experience dysfunction, increases in heme biosynthesis up-regulate
    the expression of Lhcb. Additionally, Lhcb expression is downregulated by a currently
    unknown signal (X) that requires GUN1 for either its biosynthesis or transduction
    and a signaling mechanism that depends on an unknown signal (Y) that converts
    HY5 acting downstream of cry1 from a positive to a negative regulator of Lhcb
    expression, possibly by promoting the association of HY5 and a unknown factor
    (Z; ). Arrows indicate positive regulation. T bars indicate negative regulation.
    This conversion of light from a positive to a negative regulator appears unique
    to Lhcb genes (). Plastid-to-nucleus signaling attenuates the light-induced expression
    of many other PhANGs () using a GUN1-dependent mechanism (; data not shown). This
    distinct regulation of Lhcb expression by plastid signals may explain the enhanced
    sensitivity of Lhcb to plastid dysfunction that many laboratories have reported
    since the early days of plastid-to-nucleus signaling research (). B, Plastid-localized
    tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway of plants. The arrows indicate one or several
