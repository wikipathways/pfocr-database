caption: 'A) Mutations in PHEO/PGL susceptibility genes belonging to the pseudohypoxic
  signaling cluster result in direct or indirect activation of the hypoxia signaling
  (HIF) pathway even in the presence of sufficient amount of oxygen (pseudohypoxia).
  Inactivating mutations in SDHx, SDHAF2, FH, or MDH2 lead to accumulation of Krebs
  cycle metabolites, such as succinate, fumarate, pyruvate, or glutamine, which is
  followed by activation of pseudohypoxic signaling and transcription of HIF target
  genes. VHL, EGLN1/2, and HIF2A genes are directly involved in hypoxic signaling.
  Mutations in these genes are associated with activation of the HIF signaling pathway.
  Pseudohypoxic signaling drives cell proliferation, deregulation of cellular energy
  and metabolism, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. B) Kinase signaling cluster
  includes mutations in genes involved in abnormal activation of kinase signaling,
  particularly PI3K/AKT, mTOR, and RAS/MAPK pathways. Activation of these pathways
  is associated with cell proliferation and survival, evasion from apoptosis, and
  chromatin remodeling. Kinase signaling pathways in PHEO and PGL can be disrupted
  by mutations in NF1, KIF1B, MAX, RET, TMEM127, H-RAS, and ATRX genes. Rarely, mutations
  in K-RAS, FGFR genes and fusion genes involving NGFR, BRAF, or NF1 can be found
  in PHEOs/PGLs. C) Recently, the Wnt signaling pathway has been implied to play role
  in PHEO/PGL pathogenesis based on the identification of CSDE1 mutations and MAML3
  fusion genes []. D) Mutations in SDHx and FH genes result in an accumulation of
  succinate and fumarate and mutated IDH1 activity that results in conversion of α-ketoglutarate
  to the oncometabolite D2HG. Succinate, fumarate, D2HG, and L2HG function as competitive
  inhibitors of α-ketoglutarate–dependent dioxygenases. Inhibition of reactions mediated
  by α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases leads to DNA and histone hypermethylation,
  activation of hypoxic responses, and inhibition of collagen maturation and folding.Abbreviations:
