caption: Cartoon of an engineered cell.  Four distinct strategies have been combined
  to illustrate a synthetic biology approach to metabolic engineering.  The engineered
  pathway is encoded by a synthetic operon designed from standard parts/components
  including tunable intergenic regions (TIGRs) that provide differential control over
  mRNA stability [].  An upstream device/module, a transcriptional modular AND gate
  acts as a master regulator by requiring two separate inputs to turn on expression
  of the pathway [].  The enzymes have been tagged with a peptide ligand that binds
  them to a synthetic protein scaffold, forming a complex of colocalized pathway enzymes
  [].  The central metabolism of the host/chassis has been modified to interface with
  the engineered system/network, providing a sufficient flux of necessary precursors
  and cofactors as well as increased transporters to facilitate product secretion
  [].  This image was generated in TinkerCell.
