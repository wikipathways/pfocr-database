caption: Formaldehyde-responsive miRNAs predicted to modulate MAM-associated genes
  in the brains of Mgmt−/− mice. These include miR-17-5p and miR-181d, which regulate
  genes involved in tumor suppression, DNA repair, amyloid deposition, and glutamatergic
  and dopaminergic neurotransmission. MiR-17-5p regulates the expression of EPHA4,
  GNPDA2, and TXNIP. There is a large brain-related literature on the gene encoding
  ephrin type-A receptor 4 (EPHA4) which, in the hippocampus, is located in the neuropil
  layers of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus. EPHA4 is involved in axonal development,
  maturation, targeting, and synapse formation (Tremblay et al., ; Clifford et al.,
  ). Inhibition of EPHA4 signaling reduces apoptosis in hippocampal CA1 neurons and
  is involved in the γ-secretase pathway, which processes APP to the extracellular
  amyloid deposits that characterize AD, ALS-PDC, and other tauopathies (Inoue et
  al., ). EphA4 and EphB2 receptors were reduced in the hippocampus before the development
  of impaired object recognition and spatial memory in an AD mouse model of cognitive
  decline that overexpresses human APP protein (Simón et al., ). Literature on the
  gene coding for glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2 (2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucose 6-phosphate;
  GNPDA2) is primarily related to obesity; the gene is downregulated in the hypothalamus
  in rats on a high fat diet (Gutierrez-Aguilar et al., ). The gene encoding thioredoxin-interacting
  protein (TXNIP) is a molecular nutrient sensor important in the regulation of energy
  metabolism and also involved in obesity (Blouet and Schwartz, ). Blockade of the
  NMDA receptor upregulates TXNIPin vivo and in vitro, where it binds thioredoxin
  and promotes vulnerability to oxidative damage (Martel et al., ). Transcriptional
  expression of both TXNIP and TP53 is upregulated in Cockayne syndrome, a human premature
  aging and dementing disorder (without amyloid deposition) associated with neurological
  and developmental abnormalities, and caused by mutations mainly in the CS group
  B gene (ERCC6, excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency 6; de
  Sousa Andrade et al., ). MiR-181d regulates the expression of CAMK2D, GRM5, NTS,
  and RFC1. The gene coding for DNA replication factor-1 (RFC1) is involved in DNA
  replication and repair, which would be expected following either MAM- or formaldehyde-induced
  DNA lesions. Neurotensin (NT) is a brain and gastrointestinal peptide that acts
  on G-coupled and transmembrane receptors that modulate dopaminergic transmission
  in brain pathways, notably the nigrostriatal pathway that degenerates in PD. Interactions
  may exist between NT receptor subtype 1 (NTS1) and dopamine D2 or NMDA receptors,
  such that NT-induced amplification of the latter may be involved in neurodegeneration
  (Tanganelli et al., ). GRM5 codes for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, one
  of the neuronal synaptic receptors that responds to the brain’s major excitatory
  transmitter glutamate. This activates a G-protein-coupled response that activates
  a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system and generates a calcium-activated
  chloride current. GRM5 is upregulated following repeated exposure to glutamate in
  vitro (Kawaai et al., ), downregulated in schizophrenia (Choi et al., ) and most
  probably involved in a host of degenerative disorders. MiR-181d also regulates the
  expression of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMK2D).
