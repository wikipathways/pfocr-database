caption: There is an important negative feedback between the immune and IGF systems.
  Proinflammatory cytokines decrease IGF sensitivity by enhancing IGFBP production
  and induce IGF resistance by decreasing signaling through the IRS → Akt pathway
  (left chart inset). In contrast, there is considerable evidence that IGFs increase
  cell survival by blocking caspase induction. IGFs depress proinflammatory cytokine
  signaling by increasing IL-10 secretion and expanding evidence suggests that IGFs
  directly depress proinflammatory cytokine signaling via JNK and NF-κB pathways (right
  chart inset). An appropriate balance between the immune and IGF systems is necessary
  for normal growth, development and quality of life.
