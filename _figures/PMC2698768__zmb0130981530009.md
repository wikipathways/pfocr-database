caption: Model of CD28 signaling pathways initiated by the distal and proximal motifs.
  Pathways mediated by the proximal tyrosine motif are initiated by the binding of
  the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase, leading to S473 phosphorylation of PKB/AKT, which
  can activate gene transcription through NF-κB. Additionally, the distal proline
  motif activates Lck, which in turn results in tyrosine phosphorylation of PDK1.
  PDK1 can then phosphorylate PKB on T308 as well as PKCθ on T538. Phosphorylation
  of GSK3β is also dependent on the distal proline motif, perhaps through PKCθ. Both
  PKCθ phosphorylation and GSKβ phosphorylation lead to increased gene transcription
  through NF-κB, NFAT, and AP-1. The critical, nonredundant signaling pathway is primarily
  provided by the distal proline motif, in that mutation of the proximal tyrosine
  motif does not functionally impair T-cell responses, whereas mutation of the proline
  severely impairs CD28 function.
