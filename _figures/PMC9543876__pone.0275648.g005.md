caption: GRB2 was found to have the largest number of connections with the other proteins
  shown in . The image of GRB2 related neighbors was generated using CPA and GeneMania.
  The pathway map (results with p < 0.0001) is shown along with functional pathway
  results which include Fc receptor signaling pathway, axoneogenesis, neuron projection
  guidance, inositol lipid-mediated signaling, and neutrophin receptor binding.
