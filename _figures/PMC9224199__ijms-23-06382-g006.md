caption: Schematic diagram of the effect of CanineCV on the IFN-I signaling pathway
  and CPV-2 replication. Infectious clones were transfected into cells, after which
  viral particles were packaged depending on the characteristics of the rolling loop
  replication. Then, viral protein expression was initiated, the host cell IFN-I immune
  pathway was blocked, protein synthesis was reduced, and antiviral defenses were
  dysregulated. CPV-2 replicates at higher levels in intracellular environments whereas
  antiviral genes are expressed at low levels.
