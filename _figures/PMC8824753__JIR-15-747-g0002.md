caption: Oral-intestinal microbes induce inflammation and help create an immunosuppressive
  environment, which are beneficial to CRC tumorigenesis. After colonization of the
  gut, F. nucleatum activates the NF-κB cascade pathway through TLR4 to increase expression
  levels of MiR-21 and inflammatory cytokines. P. gingivalis activates P2X7R, allowing
  the panX-1 hole to open and microbial molecules to flow in. Subsequently, P. gingivalis
  activates NF-κB through TLR4 to increase pro-IL-1β transcription levels, and that
  recruit tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, and activate NLPR3 and AIM2 inflammasome
  to promote maturation of pro-IL-1β into IL-1β, causing an inflammatory microenvironment
  conducive to CRC progression. Moreover, F. nucleatum promotes the polarization of
  M2- Mφ dependent on TLR4, which involves the IL-6/P-STAT3/C-MYC and TLR4/NF-κB/S100A9
  cascade signaling pathway. P. gingivalis also has weak M2- Mφ polarization. M2-
  Mφ polarization inhibits anti-tumor immunity. F. nucleatum binds TIGIT and CEACAM1
  on T cells and NK cells to inhibit secretion of IFN-γ and CD107a degranulation,
  thus creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment.
