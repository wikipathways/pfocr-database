caption: 'mTOR in cancer stem cells (CSCs). (A) The mTORC1 can modulate cell metabolism,
  cell survival, proliferation, and stem cell maintenance mostly through protein synthesis
  activation of transcription factors that induce the expression of genes coding proteins
  involved in these functions. Also, mTORC1 can promote Gli1 (downstream effector
  of the Hedgehog pathway), nuclear localization through its effector S6K1 that induces
  Gli1 releasing from its endogenous inhibitor, SuFu, and inhibits GSK3-mediated its
  degradation. Besides, mTORC1 under mitogenic signals and amino acid availability
  controls GSK3 nuclear import and, in turn, its nuclear functions as mediating c-Myc
  degradation. (B) The role of the mTORC2 complex in CSCs is mainly mediated by its
  effector Akt. This protein can phosphorylate many substrates, including OCT4 and
  SOX2, transcription factors that regulate stem cell self-renewal and promote pluripotency.
  Akt directly phosphorylates these transcription factors increasing its stability
  and triggering its nuclear import. Also, Akt inhibits GSK3, leading to GSK3 substrates
  stabilization such as β-catenin and Snail implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) and Gli2 that increases SOX2, OCT4, and Nanog expression in CSCs. FoxO3 inhibition
  by mTORC2 signaling through Akt activation and HDACs inhibition avoid FoxO3 nuclear
  localization and FoxO3 deacetylation, respectively. It might release FoxO3-induced
  c-Myc repression, promoting upregulation of glycolytic metabolism. 4E-BP1, eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1; FoxO3, forkhead box O3; GSK3,
  Glycogen synthase kinase; Gli1/2, Glioma-associated oncogene; HIF1 α, hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1 subunit alpha; S6K1, ribosomal protein S6 kinase; OCT4, octamer-binding
  transcription factor 4; SOX2, RY-box transcription factor 2. SuFu, SUFU negative
  regulator of hedgehog signaling. The arrows indicate: →, activation signals; ┴,
