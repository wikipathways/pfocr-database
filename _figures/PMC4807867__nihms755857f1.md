caption: Nutrient stress or loss of TARS activity leads to an increase in unfolded
  proteins which promotes the activation of PERK (protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic
  reticulum kinase) in the ER membrane. PERK transduces the signal through phosphorylation
  of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eiF2α) and activating transcription factor 4
  (ATF4) translation. ATF4 induces the transcription of genes important in protein
  degradation, translation and autophagy. Extended UPR activity leads to apoptosis.
  Castranova et al. made a direct link between loss of TARS synthetase activity and
  induction of angiogenesis through an ATF4-VEGF pathway. A separate pathway includes
  secretion of TARS and angiogenic signaling that is independent of TARS synthetase
  activity.
