caption: Erufosine induces ER stress, which leads to activation of the ER stress sensors.
  One of the pathways activated is the PERK signaling, which causes phosphorylation
  of eIF2α and activation of CHOP via ATF4. Subsequently, apoptosis is induced. Also,
  activation of IRE-1α leads to activation of the JNK pathway. Likewise, erufosine
  causes release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm, which acts on the mitochondria and may
  cause their depolarization, which is manifested by a loss of mitochondrial membrane
  potential and loss of ATP production. This eventually leads to ROS production, creating
  a pro-apoptotic environment within the cells. Also, erufosine causes activation
  of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Dotted lines indicate an indirect effect of
  erufosine on ER and mitochondrial responses. The question marks indicate unexplored
  mechanisms by which erufosine effects ER and mitochondrial membranes.
