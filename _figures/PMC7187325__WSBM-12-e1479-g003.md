caption: Calcium and ERK signaling networks for injury sensing and repair. Calcium
  and ERK can be activated by several different tissue injury signals, and can in
  turn activate several different tissue repair pathways. Cytosolic calcium can either
  come from extracellular influx via stretch activated channels, or from endoplasmic
  reticulum efflux. Calcium can then control several different cellular behaviors,
  including motility, contraction, and gene transcription. ERK can be activated by
  various receptor tyrosine kinases and can in turn control cellular contraction,
  motility, and gene transcription. One of the challenges in studying calcium and
  ERK signaling during injury is understanding which pathways are being activated
  at a given time by a given molecule, given the diverse and overlapping pathways
  containing calcium and ERK. Each pathway is referenced throughout the text. ERK,
  extracellular signal‐regulated kinase
