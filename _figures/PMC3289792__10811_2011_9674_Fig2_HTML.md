caption: Overview of an algal cell in the light, showing the main metabolic processes.
  Only the chloroplast and the cytosol were modeled as cell compartments; therefore,
  mitochondrial processes such as respiration through the electron transport chain
  were placed in the cytosol. Light is fixed in the chloroplast, yielding O2, ATP,
  and NADPH. These are needed for the fixation of carbon dioxide in the Calvin cycle
  into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP). GAP can be transported to the cytosol to
  be converted into building blocks for biomass. Lipids are formed through glycolysis
  and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Nitrate is taken up by the cell and converted
  into glutamate which in turn can be converted to protein and chlorophyll. GAP can
  be converted to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) from which carbohydrates are formed. G6P
  can also enter the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) which yields NADPH, DNA and RNA.
  Electrons are carried by NADH and FADH2 to the mitochondrial electron transport
  chain, yielding ATP by taking up O2
