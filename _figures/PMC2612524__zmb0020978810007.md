caption: A potential model for contributions of F-BAR-containing adaptor proteins
  and PTKs in regulating FcɛRI signaling during internalization. FcɛRI-evoked activation
  of Fes and Fer PTKs involves the actions of an upstream PTK (e.g., Lyn), which is
  facilitated by F-BAR domain-mediated membrane localization. F-BAR-containing adaptor
  proteins are known to induce membrane invagination and dynamic actin assembly via
  SH3-mediated recruitment of WASP and dynamin. We hypothesize that Fes and Fer PTK
  recruitment of HS1 by FesSH2 and its subsequent phosphorylation contribute stabilization
  of branched F-actin that promotes endocytosis and chemotaxis of mast cells.
