caption: Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling was subjected to BL-dependent optogenetic
  control as exemplarily illustrated for the MAPK/ERK pathway. In several approaches,,,
  OptoRTKs were constructed by appending an associating photoreceptor, e.g., the LOV
  domain of P. tricornutum aureochrome, to the intracellular C terminus of an RTK.
  BL then induced homodimerization of the chimeric receptor and activation of the
  downstream signaling cascade. In the CLICR strategy, endogenous RTKs could be activated
  upon BL exposure via an adapter protein consisting of AtCRY2 and an SH2 domain that
  specifically binds to the C termini of RTKs. The MAPK/ERK pathway was also targeted
  at lower tiers., On the one hand, the Raf kinase can be activated by recruiting
  it in BL-dependent manner to the plasma membrane (not shown). On the other hand,
  the B-Raf isoform can be activated away from the membrane in the cytosol by homodimerization
  or association with the isoform c-Raf. To optogenetically control these processes,
  the BL-dependent oligomerization of AtCRY2 or its interaction with AtCIB1 was harnessed.
