caption: Genes inhibited to decrease acetyl-CoA consumption. Since acetate is a byproduct
  synthesized by E. coli under both aerobic and anaerobic condition, the acetate formation
  genes, ackA and pta, were frequently deleted to avoid the consumption of acetyl-CoA
  to acetate. ack and pta encode the enzyme of acetyl-CoA kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase,
  respectively. In addition, acetyl-CoA is consumed significantly by TCA cycle aerobically.
  Therefore, the deletion of sucA, encoding for α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, sucC,
  encoding for succinyl-CoA synthetase and fumC, encoding for fumarase, were also
  used for increasing acetyl-CoA concentration. The orange shadowed area represents
  the CoA-dependent pathway for 1-butanol and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis,
  whose production improved by applying the deletion of acetyl-CoA consuming pathways.
  Dashed arrows indicate multi-step reactions.
