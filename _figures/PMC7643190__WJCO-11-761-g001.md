caption: 'Biomarkers, molecular pathways, existing and emerging therapeutic targets
  in colorectal cancer. A: Biomarkers and molecular pathways in colorectal cancer.
  Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) pathway: EGFR is a transmembrane receptor
  tyrosine kinase[]. EGF binding to the extracellular domain results in activation
  of down- stream intracellular signalling pathways such as RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK, and
  the PI3K PKB mTOR pathway, amongst others, which favour cell proliferation and survival[-];
  Angiogenesis pathway: Vascular endothelial growth factors influence angiogenesis
  in health and disease via binding to the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.
  Deregulated angiogenesis impacts on progression in solid tumours, thus providing
  potential anti-angiogenic therapies[]; Wnt pathway: The Wnt genes are vast family
  of highly conserved genes with wide ranging roles in development, cell proliferation
  and migration and tumorigenesis[]. Beta catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and
  nucleus leads to cell proliferation. Excess beta catenin accumulation is prevented
  by its destruction by the “beta catenin destruction complex” (a multiprotein assembly
  containing adenomatous polyposis coli and GSK3). Wnt binding to its receptor frizzled
  leads to impaired function of the Beta catenin destruction complex and hence beta
  catenin accumulation and cell proliferation[]. Mutations in adenomatous polyposis
  coli prevent the formation of the beta catenin complex, and therefore allow beta
  catenin accumulation and cell proliferation. PI3K inhibits the function of GSK3[],
  thereby impairing the beta catenin destruction complex, hence contributing to the
  tumorigenic accumulation of beta catenin. B: Existing and emerging therapeutic targets
  in colorectal cancer pathways. B: Cetuximab and Panitumumab are monoclonal antibodies
  targeting the EGFR, thus blocking activation of downstream signalling pathways.
  Mutated and constitutively active downstream effectors (such as RAS and RAF) confer
  resistance to EGFR blockade. Erlotinib and gefitinib are EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
  and are associated with improved PFS when combined to Bevacizumab in the DREAM trial[].
  Vemurafenib is a RAF inhibitor which in combination with EGFR blockade[] has shown
  marked responses in some case reports[]. Selumetinib is a MEK kinase inhibitor showing
  tumour response in some patients with KRAS mutant colorectal cancers progressing
  on Oxaliplatin[]. Regorafenib inhibits is a multi-kinase inhibitor[], with OS benefit
  in randomised double blind control trials[,]. Bevacizumab is a Monoclonal antibody
  against VEGFA with the most prominently established role in the treatment of metastatic
  colorectal cancer. Famitinib is a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor and targets
  the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. Monoclonal antibodies
  targeting the VEGF receptors are also under investigation[]. EGF: Epidermal Growth
  Factor; EGFR: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor; EGFR TKI: Epidermal Growth Factor
  Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor; K-ras: K-Ras protein (product of the proto-oncogene
  KRAS); BRAF: BRAF protein (product of the proto-oncogene BRAF; MEK: Mitogen activated
