caption: Canonical and noncanonical NLR inflammasome activation. NLR inflammasomes
  are activated by a diverse range of biological molecules and signaling pathways.
  Multiple models have been postulated to explain the mechanism underlying NLR sensing
  and activation, including direct ligand interactions, indirect mechanisms associated
  with sensing biochemical changes within the intracellular environment, the release
  of DAMPs due to lysosomal destabilization, and/or pore formation at the plasma membrane
  that promotes K+ efflux. In the canonical NLR inflammasome pathway, the NLR and
  NLR-like proteins undergo a conformational change after activation that recruits
  the adaptor protein ASC. ASC serves as a bridge facilitating pro-caspase-1 and NLR
  oligomerization through CARD-CARD and PYD-PYD domain interactions. NLR inflammasome
  formation results in the cleavage of caspase-1 into p10 and p20 subunits, which
  trigger the subsequent cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into the mature cytokines.
  In the noncanonical inflammasome pathway, the production of IFN-β and/or IFN-γ can
  sufficiently prime cells in part through STAT1 and induce the formation of a hypothetical
  noncanonical NLR inflammasome in response to intracellular gram-negative bacteria
  and LPS. Unlike the canonical NLR in-flammasome that cleaves caspase-1, noncanonical
  inflammasome formation results in the activation of caspase-11. It seems that noncanonical
  in-flammasome signaling can also induce canonical NLR inflammasome activation and
  the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18 through a currently undefined mechanism. Likewise,
  both canonical and noncanonical inflammasome formation initiates the unique form
  of cell death, termed pyroptosis.
