caption: (A) Several strategies are being pursued to target B7x in human cancers,
  and have demonstrated efficacy in pre-clinical murine models. Blocking the interaction
  of B7x with its receptor on immune cells with anti-B7x monoclonal antibodies eliminates
  this mechanism of immune escape. Further, anti-B7x antibodies can be used to target
  B7x-expressing tumor cells for cytotoxic or immune-mediated killing. Anti-B7x antibodies
  can mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity through Fc-dependent killing.
  Further, anti-B7x/anti-CD3 bispecific antibodies crosslink B7x to the T cell receptor
  on T cells, allowing effector T cells to kill target tumor cells. Anti-B7x antibodies
  can be crosslinked with toxins such as MMAE to kill tumor cells. B7x-expressing
  tumor cells can also be targeted by cellular therapies such as chimeric antigen
  receptor CAR-T cells, where T cells are engineered to target B7x on tumor cells,
  and thus mediate immune killing. (B) Two strategies have been used to activate the
  B7x pathway for the treatment of autoimmune disease such as Type 1 Diabetes. The
  B7x-Ig fusion protein of the extracellular region of B7x and the immunoglobulin-Fc
  domain can be administered systemically, which binds to the B7x-receptor on T cells
  and thereby induces systemic immunosuppression. B7x-Ig inhibits the effector functions
  of effector CD4 (Th1, Th17 cells) and CD8 T cells, and promotes immunosuppressive
  Tregs. Alternatively, the B7x gene can be genetically overexpressed in a target
  tissue. For example, a B7x-overexpression vector is transduced into pancreatic islet
  cells, upon which they are transplanted into the host organism. The renal capsule
  is a clinically relevant site to engraft the islet cells. B7x-overexpression in
  these cells suppresses autoreactive T cells, promotes Tregs, and thereby prolongs
  survival of the islet allografts.
