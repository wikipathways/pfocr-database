caption: Schematic view of insulin signaling pathway in adipose tissue. Binding of
  insulin to its receptor on adipocytes triggers the phosphorylation and activation
  of insulin receptor substrate, which forms a docking site for phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) at the membrane. When docked, PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, a second messenger
  that activates phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 and recruits Akt (also
  known as protein kinase B, PKB) to the cell membrane. Consequently, PI3K-AKT/PKB
  signaling pathway regulates metabolic processes. The red arrows indicate up-regulation
  (when pointing upward) or down-regulation (when pointing downward) in response to
  PI3K-AKT/PKB signaling pathway. The Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway
  leads to the activation of genes which are involved in cell growth, thereby promoting
  inflammation and atherogenesis. IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate; PKB, protein kinase B.
