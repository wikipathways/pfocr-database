caption: Working hypothesis on the mechanism by which plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
  (PAI-1) causes hepatic steatosis. In addition to inhibiting fibrinolysis (see ),
  inhibition of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) prevents the cleavage/maturation
  of pro-hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Decreased HGF signaling via the c-Met/ERK
  pathway leads to a decrease in the expression of apolipoprotein B (Apo) and microsomal
  triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) in the cell. The net effect is a decreased
  assembly and secretion of lipoproteins, resulting in an intracellular triglyceride
  accumulation. Knocking out PAI-1 or blocking its induction (with metformin) prevents
  this effect on very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production.
