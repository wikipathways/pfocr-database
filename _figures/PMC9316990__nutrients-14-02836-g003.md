caption: 'The molecular pathways involved in senescence cell cycle arrest. DNA damage
  activates a signaling cascade, defined as DNA damage response, which is characterized
  by phosphorylation of histone H2AX, 53BP1 and MDC1, ATM and ATR, and downstream
  kinases CHK2 and CHK1. The signal finally concentrates on the activation of p53,
  which induces p21, thereby causing cell cycle arrest. In the process of DNA replication,
  telomeres shorten to the limit, leading to DNA double strand breaks, triggering
  DDR, causing cell cycle arrest. The excessive production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) will also challenge the integrity and stability of DNA, or directly regulate
  the p53/p21 signaling pathway as a signal molecule, affect the cell cycle, and accelerate
  cell aging. Anthocyanins have a significant antioxidant capacity that can effectively
  remove ROS, repair damaged cells, and relieve cell cycle arrest. Abbreviations:
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; γH2AX, phosphorylated histone H2AX; ATM, ataxia–telangiectasia
  mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related homologue; DDR, DNA damage response; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase.'
