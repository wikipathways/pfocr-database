caption: Activation of the NFκB pathway. Under normal conditions, the NFκB dimer (composed
  of the proteins p50 and p65) is retained in the cytoplasm through interaction with
  its inhibitor protein, IκB. In response to various stimuli, the IκB kinase becomes
  activated and phosphorylates IκB, thereby targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent
  degradation by the proteasome. This leaves NFκB free to move to the nucleus and
  activate transcription of various target genes.
