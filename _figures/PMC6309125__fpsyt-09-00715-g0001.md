caption: The Hippo Pathway and its canonical upstream regulators. The translocation
  of YAP and TAZ and respective translational effects of the Hippo pathway are omitted
  when these two factors are phosphorylated due to LAST1/2 and MST1/2 activity. Both
  components can be affected independently via a wide range of canonical upsream regulators.
  Being retained in the cytoplasm YAP and TAZ are ubiquitinated and degraded. ADHD,
  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. LATS 1/2, large tumor suppressor kinase
  1/2; MOB1A/MOB1B, Mps one binder kinase activator 1A/1B; MST1/2, macrophage-stimulating
  protein 1/2; SAV1, salvador family WW domain containing protein 1 (protein WW45);
  TAZ, transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif; TEAD1-4, TEA domain transcription
  factors 1-4; YAP, yes-associated protein.
