caption: This schematic illustrates the key genetic and nongenetic mechanisms contributing
  to resistance against CDK4/6 inhibitors in HR+/HER2− breast cancer. In the canonical
  pathway, mitogenic and hormone-signaling pathways activate the cyclin D–CDK4/6 complex,
  which phosphorylates Rb, effectively releasing E2F transcription factors and promoting
  cell cycle entry. LOF mutations in Rb represent the most well-documented primary
  resistance mechanism to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Another genetic mechanism involves FAT1
  LOF mutations, which activate the Hippo pathway, leading to CDK6 overexpression
  and the formation of CDK6‒INK4 complexes resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Mutations
  in mitogenic and hormone-signaling pathways, such as ERBB2, FGFR1-3, PIK3CA, NF1
  and ESR1, which can increase c-Myc expression, are frequently observed in CDK4/6
  inhibitor-resistant tumors. Nongenetic mechanisms include Rb degradation, bypassing
  CDK4/6 inhibition to alternatively enter the cell cycle. However, this noncanonical
  pathway for Rb inactivation is incomplete, necessitating E2F amplification by c-Myc,
  which has been shown to inversely correlate with the outcomes of CDK4/6 inhibitor
  therapies. The loss of AMBRA1 stabilizes cyclin D and enables its interaction with
  CDK2, driving resistance. In addition, amplification of AURKA and CCNE1/2 upregulates
  CDK2 activity, allowing tumor cells to bypass the dependency on CDK4/6. Alterations
  in specific miRNAs also contribute to CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance. This model emphasizes
  the multifaceted nature of resistance mechanisms, highlighting the roles of genetic
  mutations, signaling pathway alterations and transcriptional regulation
