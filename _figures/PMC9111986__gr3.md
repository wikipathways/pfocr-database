caption: Cerebral cortex metabolite profiles of animals receiving HD-CPR are similar
  to sham animals that did not undergo cardiac arrest, while Std-CPR animals exhibited
  a distinct metabolite profile. A. PCA loadings plot for the first two principal
  components for all metabolite expression indicate HD-CPR and sham are similar to
  one another, but distinct from Std-CPR animals. B. Assembly of major metabolic pathways
  in the brain with differentially expressed metabolites shaded. Branched chain amino
  acid metabolic pathway is altered in Std-CPR animals. C. Std-CPR animals exhibited
  an increase in all branched chain amino acids compared to both HD-CPR and sham animals
  in cerebral cortex at 24 h after CA.
