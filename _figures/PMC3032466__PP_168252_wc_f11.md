caption: Expression of cell cycle genes in wild-type (WT) and CKX-4 tubers after GA3-mediated
  tuber sprouting. Expression data of differentially expressed ESTs representing genes
  of the cell cycle are shown in the left-hand panel and a schematic overview of the
  mitotic cell cycle, modified after , is shown on the right. Color bars as displayed
  by the MapMan tool were copied to and aligned in Microsoft PowerPoint. The color
  scale next to the panel indicates transcript levels, with red representing an increase
  and blue representing a decrease in transcript levels. The colors saturate at 8-fold
  change. Details on the assignment of individual POCI identifiers to genes shown
  are listed in Supplemental Table S3. At the G1/S-phase transition, CDK inhibitory
  protein ICK dissociates from CDKA-CYCD complexes and is degraded via the proteasome
  pathway. Phosphorylation of CDKA then activates the CDKA-CYCD complex, which initiates
  phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma-related protein (RBR), releasing the E2F-DP1
  complex. This complex promotes the transcription of genes required for progression
  into and through S-phase, where DNA replication takes place. The G2/M-phase transition
  is accompanied by a marked increase in transcription of both A- and B-type CDKs
  and A- and B-type cyclins. CDKA/B-CYCA/B complexes are activated by removal of the
  inhibitory phosphate by CDC25 and phosphorylation by CDK-activating kinase (CAK),
  both enzymes acting on the CDK part of the complex. The reverse reaction, inhibitory
  phosphorylation of CDK, is catalyzed by kinase WEE1 and promotes endoreduplication.
  During mitosis, CDC20- and CCS25-activated anaphase-promoting complex (APC) degrades
  cyclins A and B, leading to the transition from mitosis into G1-phase. CDC, Cell
  division cycle; DP, docking protein.
