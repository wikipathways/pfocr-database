caption: 'The interplay between HBP, mTOR, and AMPK signaling pathways. The HBP pathway
  senses glucose, glutamine, and nucleotide levels to produce UDP-GlcNAc, the primary
  metabolite for protein O-GlcNAcylation, via the enzyme OGT. GAFT1 and OGT suppress
  the AMPK activity, which is a master energy stress sensing enzyme. AMPK activated
  by phosphorylation favors the processes that produce ATP over the biosynthesis of
  molecules. Therefore, AMPK functions as a negative regulator of mTORC1, which induces
  translation and promotes cell growth when there are high levels of nutrients. Furthermore,
  AMPK activates TSC1/2, which ensures complete suppression of mTORC1 activity. Also,
  AMPK and mTORC1 pathways feedback take over the ULK1 activation, a protein necessary
  for the induction of autophagy. On the other hand, growth factors activate the AKT
  and MAPK kinase pathways, which convergence in the same way in the inactivation
  of the TSC1/2 complex, the negative regulators of mTORC1. On the other hand, the
  mTORC2 complex activity is controlled by glucose and acetate levels through acetyl-CoA,
  an intermediary metabolite in glycolysis, fatty acid catabolism, and the HBP pathways.
  mTORC2 also converges with the HBP pathway in the stimulation of GFAT1. In consequence,
  the interplay between these signaling pathways is involved in nutrient sensing as
  a means of regulating cell activity and growth and, more importantly, in reacting
  to changes in the microenvironment of the tumor. The arrows indicate: →, activation
  signals; ┴, inhibition signals.'
