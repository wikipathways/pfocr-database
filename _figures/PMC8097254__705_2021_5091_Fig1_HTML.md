caption: Pathway illustrating four different ways by which SARS-CoV-2 interferes with
  the immune system. (a) SARS-CoV-2 infection results in cytokines stress syndrome
  by producing a cascade of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2,
  IL-8, TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) through the
  activation of cytokine components. IL-2 and IL-8 further induce the expression of
  IL-6 and IL-17. CSS is characterized by a high level of IL-6. IL-6 causes liver
  damage by producing SAA serum amyloid. (b) SARS-CoV-2 infection causes the upregulation
  of NK cell receptors (NKG2A). High NKG2A levels halt the function of NK cells by
  exhausting them (b1). Simultaneously, T cell exhaustion occurs due to the activation
  of Treg cells because of CSS (b2). (c) Increased expression of TNF-α due to CSS
  causes thrombocytopenia. (d) SARS-CoV-2 infection causes ER endoplasmic reticulum
  stress, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). Prolonged stress results
  in activation of the NF-κB pathway, which causes inflammation and ultimately leads
  to the pathogenesis of malignant, metabolic, and airway diseases.
