caption: Schematic overview of the pathway controlling translational changes in adipogenesis.
  The PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway, which is stimulated by insulin, leads to activation
  of eIF4B, which changes preferences in translation activity []. Regulation of C/EBPα
  could possibly be explained by up-regulation of eIF4b activity, as members of the
  C/EBP family are regulated at the translational level (dashed line). Additionally
  an increase in translation of adipogenesis genes mediated by eIF4B is thinkable
  (dashed line). c-MYC over-expression in cycling cells has been reported to block
  exit from the cell cycle, accelerate cell division, and increase cell size (reviewed
  in []). When c-MYC levels are high, 3T3-L1 adipoblasts are locked in a proliferation-competent
  state and normal differentiation can not be activated. Persisting high levels of
  c-MYC can inhibit the expression of genes that promote adipogenesis namely C/EBPα
  and PPARγ2 and therefore prevent terminal differentiation of preadipocytes to mature
  adipocytes [,]. c-MYC is an important regulator of ribogenesis, as it activates
  Pol I, Pol II and Pol III []. As a supplement in media, Ghrelin promotes the proliferation
  and differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by increasing the mRNA levels of PPARγ
  and C/EBPα []. Ghrelin mRNA over-expressing 3T3-L1 cells, on the other hand, demonstrated
  significantly attenuated differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes []. Down-regulation
  of Ghrelin levels in the early phase of adipogenesis fits the known facts indicating
  a role of decreased endogenous Ghrelin levels in promoting adipogenesis).

  induction of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells.
