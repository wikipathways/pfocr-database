caption: During seed development, the transcripts of RVE1 and RVE2 are increasingly
  accumulated to induce and maintain seeds at the dormant state. Red light triggers
  the activation of phyB (Pfr form), which represses RVE1 and RVE2 expression, leading
  to the de-suppression of the GA biosynthetic gene GA3ox2 and the accumulation of
  bioactive GAs, and consequently the induction of seed germination.
