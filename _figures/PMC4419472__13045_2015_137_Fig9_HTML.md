caption: Schematic diagram describing the effect of oroxylin A on the inhibition of
  p53 degradation through the suppression of PTEN-regulated MDM2 expression. Oroxylin
  A enhanced cellular SIRT3 level, causing the deacetylation of PTEN and promoting
  its lipid phosphatase activity. The activated PTEN suppressed the transcription
  of MDM2, which was responsible for the degradation of p53. As a result, oroxylin
  A inhibited p53 degradation and the p53-related glycolytic pathway.
papertitle: Oroxylin A promotes PTEN-mediated negative regulation of MDM2 transcription
  via SIRT3-mediated deacetylation to stabilize p53 and inhibit glycolysis in wt-p53
  cancer cells.
