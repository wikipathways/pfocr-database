caption: Overview of the oxidative stress and immune alterations influence on tripartite
  synapse in schizophrenia. Chronic oxidative stress may trigger multiple intracellular
  changes responsible for the increase in neuronal Ca2 + influx and therefore accumulation
  of ROS and RNS, disrupting synaptic transmission. The action of immune response
  on glial cells can cause an impairment of glutamate reuptake, inducing a further
  enhancing of neuronal Ca2 + influx, while in neurons can directly alter the membrane
  delivery of the AMPAR and NMDAR. KYNA and QUIN, the neuroactive metabolites of TRP/KYNA
  pathway, act as NMDAR antagonists and agonists, respectively. Following the glutamatergic
  hypothesis of schizophrenia, has been suggested the imbalance in KYNA pathway, promoting
  the production of KINA over QUIN resulting in microglial activation and KINA-mediated
  neurotoxicity. Moreover, GABAergic inhibitory interneurons dysfunction may induce
  a glutamate storm from excitatory glutamatergic cortical pyramidal neurons and a
  subcortical dopamine storm. GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid); TRP (tryptophan); IDO (indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase); KIN (kynurenine); KINA (kynurenic acid); QUIN (quinolinic acid);
  ROS (reactive oxidative species); RNS (nitrosative species). Created with BioRender.com
