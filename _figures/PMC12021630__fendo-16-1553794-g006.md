caption: Molecular mechanism of PGRN in osteoporosis. (A) PGRN and E2 could significantly
  inhibit OC activity, while si-PGRN could significantly induce OC activity. At low
  E2 concentrations, PGRN acts as a chaperone protein to assist the binding of E2
  to ERα. However, at high E2 concentrations, PGRN cannot play a normal molecular
  chaperone role, interfering with the binding of E2 to ERα. The effects of PGRN,
  E2 and PGRN+E2 on promoting osteogenesis and inhibiting OC were significantly weakened
  after ko-ERα. PGRN, E2 and PGRN+E2 could significantly up regulate the levels of
  p-PERK, p-eIF2α and ATF4, and activate the PERK/p-eIF2α signalling pathway. After
  ko-ERα and ko-PGRN, the results were opposite, while r-PGRN could partially restore
  the function of PERK/p-eIF2α signalling pathway. In addition, in ko-PGRN cells,
  after ko-ERα, r-PGRN treatment did not significantly reduce PERK/p-eIF2α signal
  transduction. (B) The levels of PGRN in serum and bone marrow fluid of OVX mice
  were significantly increased. In RANKL treated mbmms, PGRN mRNA and protein levels
  were significantly increased in a time-dependent manner. si-PGRN significantly inhibited
  the gene expression of PGRN, down regulated the expression levels of TRAP, NFATc1
  and OSCAR, and reduced the number of TRAP+MNCs. In the presence of RANKL, r-PGRN
  reversed the above results, and PGRN significantly increased the expression of PIRO,
  ko-PGRN could significantly reduce the expression of PIRO, while si-PIRO significantly
  inhibited the formation of MNCs, reduced the number of TRAP+MNCs and PIRO mRNA level,
  r-PGRN partially restored MNCs inhibited by PIRO transfection. (C) PGRN could significantly
  increase the level of Estrogens, and PGRN and Estrogens could up regulate the expression
  of osteogenic markers Runx2, OPG and DMP1, and down regulate the expression of OC
  related markers NFATc1, ACP5 and CTSK. When PGRN+Estrogens co acted, the regulatory
  effect was more obvious. GRN was expressed in mouse bone tissue and cultured OB
  from BMSCs. ko-GRN led to a significant reduction in GRN mRNA levels, OC markers
  CTSK and ACP5 expression in bone and cultured OB from male and female mice with
  ko-PGRN. In contrast, the expression of TRAP-positive cells, immature OC-associated
  genes Csf1r, Adgre1 and C1q, and the expression of osteogenesis-related factors
  C3 and Osm in mouse OC were increased in distal femoral trabeculae
