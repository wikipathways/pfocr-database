caption: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathways; the signaling pathway
  is initiated by the binding of TGF-β to TβRII and, in the process, recruiting TβRI,
  forming a heterodimer complex. TβRII will activate TβRI by phosphorylation, resulting
  in recruitment of R-Smads, which will be anchored onto the complex by SARA. Phosphorylation
  of R-Smad or receptor-activated Smads will take place. Phosphorylated R-Smads will
  bind to Smad4, creating a complex that then signals translocation into the nucleus,
  leading to transcription of target proteins. TGF-β signaling can also result in
  the activation of non-Smad signaling, which also leads to target gene transcription,
  while I-Smads act as an inhibitor of the TGF-β signaling pathway.
