caption: HIV-1 MS mRNAs and US/SS mRNAs engage different translation pathways attributable
  to specific binding of nuclear RNA helicase (RHA) and m7G-cap hypermethylation that
  inhibits CBC exchange to eIF4E and favors exchange to CBP80/NCBP3 mRNPs for specialized
  translation unaffected by mTOR. (Left) eIF4E-dependent translation of Tat, Rev,
  and Nef from fully processed HIV-1 mRNAs is controlled through mTOR. Nascent HIV-1
  transcripts receive the monomethylated guanosine (m7G) cap and 3′ polyadenylate
  tail (AAA) and are alternatively spliced. m7G-cap is cotranscriptionally bound by
  CBC composed of CBP20-CBP80 and supports cap exchange to eIF4E. The mTOR substrate
  4EBP1 is the allosteric inhibitor of eIF4E. (Left) mTOR hyperphosphorylates 4E-BP1
  to activate global eIF4E-dependent mRNAs translation. mTOR inhibition (e.g., Torin-1)
  engenders hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 and global repression of translation inclusive
  of Tat, Rev, and Nef. (Right) CBP80/NCBP3-RHA–specialized translation of HIV-1 structural
  and accessory proteins. HIV-1 late gene expression is characterized by Tat and Rev
  transactivation of nascent HIV-1 RNAs at the TAR and RRE, respectively. HIV-1 m7G-cap
  is cotranscriptionally bound by CBC followed by folding of the 5′-UTR PBS segment
  three-way junction structure recognized by RHA. RHA engenders TGS1 hypermethylation
  of the m7G-cap–inhibiting cap exchange to eIF4E. NCBP3/CBP80-RHA mRNP engage a specialized
  translation pathway for structural and accessory protein synthesis during down-regulation
  of global translation.
