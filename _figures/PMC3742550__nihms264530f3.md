caption: Intracellular 1-carbon metabolism (simplified), emphasizing pathways relevant
  to the text. Multiple significant alterations in gene expression in this metabolic
  pathway were observed. Enzyme gene names are shown in capital letters, upregulated
  genes are shown in green and downregulated genes red, genes whose expression did
  not change are shown in black. Major end-products relevant to the discussion are
  in bold italics. Methionine adenosyltransferase 2b (MAT2b) is upregulated but all
  other genes whose expression were altered were downregulated. Notably thymidylate
  synthase (TYMS),dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and 2 de novo DNA methyltransferases
  3A and 3B (DNMT3A and DNMT3B) are downregulated. CTH (cystathionine lyase) is reduced
  as well. The function of the gene product of AHCYL1 (S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase-like
  1) is not known with certainty but a highly homologous protein catalyzes the reversible
  hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (S-Adohcy) to adenosine and L-homocysteine.
  Additional genes that were downregulated include folate receptor 1 (FOLR1); gamma
  glutamyl hydrolase (‘conjugase’,GGH), an enzyme that cleaves the polyglutamyl tail
  of folates; methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenease (MTHFD1), which is involved
  in the interconversion of 1-carbon derivatives of tetrahydrofolate; 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine
  methyltransferase reductase (MTRR), which regenerates an active form of methionine
  synthase (MTR) via reductive methylation with vitamin B12 as cofactor; and phosphoribosylglycinamide
  formyltransferase (GART), which is pivotal in purine biosynthesis. THF = tetrahydrofolate;
  S-AdoMet = S-adenosylmethionine; S-AdoHcy = S-adenosylhomocysteine.
