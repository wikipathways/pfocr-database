caption: The ClueGO based enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways identified
  from genes differently expressed in three group comparison. (A) single (lice) infection
  vs. pre-infection, (B) co-infection (lice+ISAv) vs. pre-infection, and (C) co-infection
  (lice+ISAv) vs. single infection. The shape size shows the GO terms and pathway
  significance (bigger he size higher the significance). The shape depicts batabase
  source i.e., GO biological process (ellipse), GO cellular component (hexagon), GO
  molecular function (parallelogram), and KEGG pathways (square). The statistics of
  representative GO terms or pathway are tabulated in .
