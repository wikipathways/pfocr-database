caption: The diagram depicts the effects of SRGAP2C, SRGAP2, and ENAH that have been
  reported on cell motility in the Slit-Robo pathway. ENAH and SRGAP2 receive signaling
  from SLIT/ROBO that results in the suppression of cell motility. SRGAP2C inhibits
  the function of SRGAP2. The percent of Sleeping Beauty induced primary tumors with
  a transposon insertion in a given gene are listed next to its protein product in
  the diagram. Insertions were found in animals with and without a Trp53 deficient
  background in addition to transposon mutagenesis (n = 28/119). Four primary tumors
  had a transposon insertion in more than one gene.
