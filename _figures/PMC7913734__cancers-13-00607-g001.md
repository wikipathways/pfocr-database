caption: MAPK signalling pathway with and without BRAF alterations. In the normal
  MAPK signalling pathway (a) BRAF interacts with RAS, and the complex activates subsequent
  proteins in the pathway to promote normal cell proliferation. However, when the
  BRAF is mutated (b) it causes a continuous activation of MAPK pathway, which results
  in uncontrolled cell proliferation, leading to malignancies.
