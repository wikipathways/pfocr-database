caption: The ERK5 pathway is subject to complex regulation that we propose plays a
  critical role in establishing the regulatory dynamics of ZSCAN4 expression. ERK5
  activation drives Klf2 transcription, which drives ZSCAN4/2C gene expression. However,
  ERK5 also directly phosphorylates KLF2, which negatively regulates KLF2 function
  by promoting ubiquitylation and degradation. Thus, ERK5 both promotes KLF2 transcriptional
  induction and negatively regulates KLF2 via direct phosphorylation, generating a
  dynamic system of amplification followed by negative feedback that accounts for
  oscillatory ZSCAN4 expression observed in mESCs.
