caption: Model of YB-1 function. Many environmental insults or cellular proliferation
  signals induce the expression and nuclear accumulation of YB-1 in mammalian cells.
  YB-1 is an integral part of a general cellular stress response signaling pathway
  required for protecting cells from a variety of stresses. The loss of YB-1 causes
  the loss of this protective mechanism. Consequently, cells deficient in YB-1 show
  an increased sensitivity to environmental stresses, leading to premature senescence.

  Stress Responses, and the Prevention of Premature Senescence.
