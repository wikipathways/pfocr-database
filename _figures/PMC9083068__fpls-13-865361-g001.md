caption: Model of histone modification and chromatin remodeling during various stages
  of the seed life cycle. (A) Epigenetic regulators act of pivotal seed development
  in Arabidopsis and rice. Line with a dot in tail end represent an unclear regulatory
  pathway. (B) Chromatin regulation of seed dormancy through mediating the expression
  of DOG1. Solid lines represent regulator that can modulate DOG1 expression directly.
  Dash lines represent those regulatory mechanisms that are still unclear. (C) The
  roles of histone modifiers and chromatin remodelers in regulating seed germination
  in response to light, temperature and abiotic stress. In the box below, the bold
  line with pink, gray and blue colors represent ABA, NaCl and mannitol treatment,
  respectively. Ellipse with dotted outline represents that the specific regulator
  is not clear. (D) Epigenetic factors act in seed-to-seedling transition. Illustrated
  histone modifiers and chromatin remodelers act in repression of ectopic expression
  of LAFL genes, thereby maintaining normal vegetative morphology of seedlings. The
  histone modifiers for histone acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination are marked
  in red, blue and green, respectively. Chromatin remodelers and epigenetic associated
  regulators are marked in purple and orange, respectively. Downstream genes are shown
  in boxes with aquamarine blue.
