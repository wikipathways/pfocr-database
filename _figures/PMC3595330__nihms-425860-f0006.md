caption: Estrogen can reduce Aβ production by favoring the non-amyloidogenic pathway
  of APP processing through activation of the MAPK/ERK or PKC pathways, while simultaneously
  promoting Aβ clearance in several ways, such as stimulating microglial phagocytosis
  and degradation as well as regulating levels of major enzymes involved in Aβ degradation.
