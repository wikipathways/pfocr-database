caption: (A) PIDDosome activity promotes controlled hepatocyte polyploidization, producing
  a “normal” ploidy spectrum that is sensitive to tumorigenesis. The ratio of each
  ploidy population is indicated for mice. The absence of PIDDosome leads to unrestrained
  polyploidization and hyperpolyploidy, which contributes to tumor resistance. (B)
  Tumor initiation (asterisks) occurs primarily in lower‐ploidy hepatocytes (mostly
  2n and possibly 4n), and once transformed, they acquire proliferation signatures
  that drive expansion
