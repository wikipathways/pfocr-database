caption: Schematic diagram of isoflavones and their competing metabolic pathways.
  The green box represents flavonol and anthocyanin metabolic pathway compounds. The
  yellow box represents flavone metabolic pathway compounds, and the purple box represents
  isoflavone metabolic pathway compounds. Blue text represents a significant decrease
  in the substance, and red text represents a significant increase in the substance.
  Gray text indicates that the substance was not detected. Multiple arrows in sequence
  represent omitted metabolites.
