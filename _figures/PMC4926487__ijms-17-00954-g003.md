caption: Schematic representation of the DNA repair system for neuroprotection implying
  that genome stability is sustained on several tumor suppressors. Examples of the
  action known to act on the neuron survival pathways are shown. Several dietary modulators
  linked to this pathway are also demonstrated, whose potential molecular targets
  may be based on the predominant sites. Note that some critical functions have been
  omitted for clarity.
