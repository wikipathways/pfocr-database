caption: Suggested mechanism of action of sildenafil on SSc fibroblasts. After a pro-oxidant
  stimulus, the cell activates intracellular pathways that rapidly induce both the
  translocation of the CXCR3 receptor on the plasma membrane and the phosphorylation
  of downstream signaling molecules such as STAT1, JNK and p38MAPK. These proteins
  adapt the DNA response inducing the expression and release of the pro-inflammatory
  chemokines CXCL-9, CXCL-10 and CXCL-11. The binding of these chemokines to the specific
  receptor CXCR3 on the plasma membrane increases and amplifies the pro-inflammatory
  response towards autocrine/paracrine action and recruits CXCR3+ immune cells to
  tissue damage. The action of sildenafil results in an impairment of CXCR3 recruitment
  on the plasma membrane and in the counteraction of the transduction pathway responsible
  for chemokines expression and release. This can determine the reduction of the inflammatory
  activation loop at the site of damage.
