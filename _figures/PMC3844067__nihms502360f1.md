caption: (A, B) Hypothetical examples of Polycomb PRC2 mediated repressive chromatin
  remodeling. (A) At the BDNF gene locus (chromosome 11p13/14.1), two separate promoters
  are thought to drive expression of BDNF sense and antisense transcript. Studies
  in mouse () confirm that the natural antisense transcript is a negative regulator
  for BDNF expression and neurotrophic function. These mechanism may involve repressive
  PRC2 chromatin remodeling at the BDNF/Bdnf locus, and removal of the antisense Bdnf–AS
  by short interfering RNAs (that trigger degradation by the RISC-Argonaute 2 pathway)
  decreases levels of the repressive histone mark, trimethyl H3K27. (B) A different
  type of chromatin-associated regulatory mechanism involving PRC2 and ncRNA may operate
  at the DPP10 locus on chromosome 2q14.1, which is defined by the emergence of a
  human-specific long ncRNA, LOC389023 in conjunction with increased enrichment for
  open chromatin-associated trimethyl H3K4 (H3K4me3) (). The LOC389023 transcript,
  via a GC-rich stem loop motif, is thought to recruit components of the PRC2 complex,
  including the SUZ12 zinc finger repressor protein. These mechanisms could then contribute
  to the observed human-specific downregulation of DPP10 transcript in the prefrontal
  cortex (). Additional work is required in order to clarify whether SUZ12 acts by
  recruiting additional PRC2-associated proteins to the DPP10 locus, and whether there
  is increased repressive histone methylation (H3K27me3) at DPP10.
