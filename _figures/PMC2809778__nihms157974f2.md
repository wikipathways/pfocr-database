caption: PINK1 directly or indirectly promotes phosphorylation of TRAP1, HtrA2 and
  parkin, resulting in activation of both localized and organelle level responses
  to promote neuronal cell survival.(1) A mild to modest localized stress to mitochondrial
  proteins (one yellow bolt) activates the PINK1-TRAP1 and PINK1-Omi/HtrA2 pathways,
  stabilizing the mitochondrial cytoarchitecture in response to oxidative stress and
  heat shock. Another response to localized outer membrane damage may involve tagging
  of damaged proteins for proteasomal degradation by ubiquitin ligases including Parkin,
  Mitochondrial fusion may act to stabilize membrane potential, diluting damaged DNA
  or other components.(2) More extensive damage from persistent mitochondrial ROS
  (two yellow bolts) may be caused by loss of PINK1 function and/or environmental
  toxins, leading to compensatory increases in Parkin expression and mitochondrial
  fission. Parkin participates in a parallel pro-survival pathway, compensating for
  damaged mitochondrial by driving selective autophagy of depolarized segments isolated
  by mitochondrial fission. This may also serve to limit release of apoptogenic intermembrane
  space proteins.(3) Successful neuronal adaptation to stress employing either of
  these parallel pathways would require effective transcriptional responses and reassembly
  of functional mitochondrial components. Nuclear encoded proteins are essential for
  both mitochondrial DNA replication (POLG) and transcription of mitochondrially encoded
  genes (POLRMT, TFAM, etc), along with coordinated synthesis, import and processing
  or assembly of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins.Under conditions of PINK1
  loss of function, alternative means to activate mitochondrial quality control pathways
  may serve to compensate for increased mitochondrial injury, although likely at a
  greater bioenergetic cost.
