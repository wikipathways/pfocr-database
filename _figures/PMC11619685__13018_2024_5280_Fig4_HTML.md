caption: Activation of the p38 MAPK-mediated senescence pathway can occur because
  of pH changes or stimulation of ASIC1 or ASIC3, which initiates the ATM/ATR pathway.
  Telemere uncapping and DNA damage can also directly initiate hypophosphorylation
  through the activation of the ATM/ATR pathway or activation of the p53-p21-Rb signalling
  pathway via CHK1/CHK2, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest can be
  caused by a lack of nutrients, mechanical stress, ROS, and other factors that activate
  the p38-MAPK and NF-kB signalling pathways, which in turn activate the p16-Rb signalling
  pathway to initiate hypophosphorylation. Additionally, pizeo-1 mediates a decrease
  in Ca2 + concentration, which initiates ER stress and induces cells to secrete SASP,
  thereby causing cell cycle arrest. Inflammatory storms can also cause cell cycle
  arrest through the Wnt–β-catenin pathway, which is mediated by pro-inflammatory
  factors such as IL-1β and IL-18. The cell cycle arrest described above mediates
  disc cell senescence
