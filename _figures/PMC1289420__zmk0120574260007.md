caption: A model for the role of cholesterol in membrane organization during neutrophil
  polarization and migration. During polarization and migration (top diagram), activation
  of the fMLP-receptor at the front stimulates the Gi/PI3-K pathway (red), which promotes
  actin polymerization and protrusion. Receptor activation at the rear stimulates
  the G12/13/RhoA pathway (green), which promotes actin-myosin contraction. These
  pathways segregate and are maintained at opposite poles of the cell in part via
  mutual negative feedback pathways (dotted red and green lines; ). Cholesterol is
  critical for the formation of membrane domains that enable the spatial segregation
  of signaling pathways to the front and rear of cells. Cholesterol may directly influence
  the activation of signaling proteins involved in the Gi/PI3-K pathway and inhibit
  lateral diffusion of D3-PIs. Cholesterol may also down-regulate the Gi/PI3-K pathway
  in the uropod, inhibiting negative feedback on the RhoA pathway and promoting uropod
  formation. In response to cholesterol depletion by MβCD (bottom diagram), activation
  of the Gi/PI3-K pathway (red) is enhanced, leading to D3-PI accumulation over the
  entire plasma membrane, and to actin polymerization and the formation of multiple
  protrusions. This in turn enhances negative feedback on the RhoA pathway (green),
  inhibiting uropod function.
