caption: 'The mTOR pathway profile in ESCs; generalized chart. The PI3K/AKT signaling
  activates mTOR kinase under the action of different factors: insulin-like growth-factor
  IGF, fibroblast growth factor FGF, etc. This pathway is downregulated in pluripotent
  cells. In addition, TSC1/2 is upregulated and suppresses the activity of mTORC1
  and mTORC2 complexes. Support of TSC1/2 functional activity also comes from SIRT1
  deacetylase, which coordinates autophagy via LKB/AMPK pathway. The main restrained
  mTOR activity signaling pathway is provided by SIRT1/AMPK/ULK1 pathway. AMPK is
  activated by SIRT1-dependent acetylation of LKB1. Activated AMPK phosphorylates
  autophagy-inducing ULK1 complex. Moreover, AMPK has an inhibitory activity on the
  mTORC1 complex restraining surplus anabolic processes. AMPK also activates p53 that
  translocates to the nucleus and upregulates DRAM1 and Sestrins gene expression.
  Proapoptotic p53 activity is suppressed by SIRT1 deacetylation. Lysosomal membrane
  protein DRAM1 stimulates autophagy, while Sestrins proteins stimulate the activation
  of the Gator1/2 complex, by which mTORC1 is inhibited.'
