caption: The sphingolipid networks. A schematic view of the interconnected sphingolipid
  network, which has Cers (purple) forming its central hub. Cer can be synthesized
  through the de novo pathway (green), initiated by the condensation of l-serine and
  palmitoyl-CoA; through the SMase pathway (blue), from the degradation of SM catalyzed
  by different SMases; or through the Salvage pathway (yellow), from the Sph generated
  by the degradation of complex sphingolipids. Cer can then serve as a substrate for
  sphingomyelin synthesis by SMS; be phosphorylated by a CerK to generate C1P; or
  be deacylated by CDases to form Sph, which can in turn be phosphorylated by SphK
  to produce S1P. S1P can be dephosphorylated by S1P phosphatase (S1PP) to regenerate
  Sph or be irreversibly degraded by S1P lyase to render ethanolamine 1-phosphate
  and hexadecenal, an irreversible reaction that provides the only escape pathway
  from this intricate metabolic network. DES, dihydroceramide desaturase-1; LPP, lipid
  phosphate phosphatases.
