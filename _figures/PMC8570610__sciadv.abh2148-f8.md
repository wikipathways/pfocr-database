caption: PD-1 is expressed on BTICs in resected clinical GBM specimens in situ and
  patient-derived BTICs in culture. Tumor-promoting effects of PD-1 in BTICs did not
  require interaction with PD-L1; thus, the therapeutic antibodies were unable to
  overcome the growth advantage of PD-1 in BTICs. Mice with intracranial Pdcd1 over-
  or underexpressing BTICs had shorter or longer survival, respectively. Mechanistically,
  phosphorylation of ITIM and ITSM motifs within the cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 recruited
  SHP-2 phosphatase and activated the NFκB pathway through IKKα/β in BTICs.
