caption: Schematic representation of different pathways involved in trained immunity.
  C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 is activated by β-glucans, found in the cell wall
  of fungi and bacteria. Activation of Dectin-1 induces a proinflammatory response,
  while also initiating the metabolic and epigenetic rewiring underlying innate immune
  memory. OxLDL can induce a trained phenotype through the formation of cholesterol
  crystals and NLRP3 activation. Mevalonate is produced in the cholesterol synthesis
  pathway and can induce epigenetic modifications in macrophages. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A (HMG-CoA) can inhibit the conversion of acetyl CoA to mevalonate. The mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of cellular metabolism and function.
  Moreover, mevalonate-, β-glucan- and oxLDL-induced trained immunity rely on mTOR
  activation. Therefore, inhibiting mTOR or its downstream target S6K1 can reduce
  trained immunity. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) inhibition
  impairs CD40-based T-cell co-stimulation (signal 2), which reduces inflammation.
