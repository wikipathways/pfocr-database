caption: 'a PGAM5 dephosphorylates Drp1 and facilitates its recruitment to mitochondria,
  thereby promoting mitochondrial fission and eliminating damaged mitochondrial segments
  via interactions with the ER and F-actin. b Left: in healthy mitochondria, PINK1
  is translocated to the mitochondrial inner membrane and degraded by PARL, whereas
  PGAM5 is degraded by unoxidized KEAP1 before its translocation to the mitochondria.
  Right: in damaged mitochondria, PGAM5 replaces PINK1 as the substrate for PARL cleavage,
  resulting in the accumulation of PINK1 on the mitochondrial outer membrane. PINK1
  recruits Parkin to ubiquitinate Parkin substrates, triggering mitophagy through
  the formation of autophagosomes and subsequent engulfment of mitochondria. In addition,
  PGAM5 can activate receptor-mediated mitophagy, such as FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy.
  c Damage to mitochondria causes PARL to cleave PGAM5, discharging it into the cytoplasm.
  The cleaved form of PGAM5 dephosphorylates β-catenin and induces its translocation
  to the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of mitochondrial biogenesis-related
  target genes. Increased levels of the cleaved form of PGAM5 promote mitochondrial
  biogenesis. Notably, this mechanism does not involve the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway (left). Created with BioRender.com'
