caption: 'The extracellular dopamine (DA-e) concentration of 400 (relative unit) under
  a healthy state (HS) was first obtained from the kinetic model. The concentrations
  of the metabolites for various deficiencies of VMAT2 and TH are listed in supporting
  information (). DA-e is the therapeutic objective: the dopamine level as close to
  its healthy level as possible that the identified enzyme targets can achieve. Other
  metabolites of interest included toxic species, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and
  reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Toxic species considered in this model were dopaquinone
  (DOPA-Q), 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), extracellular
  DOPAL (DOPAL-e), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate quinone (DOPAC-Q), and dopamine quinone
  (DA-Q). ROS included superoxide (O2−), intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), extracellular
  H2O2 (H2O2-e), and hydroxyl radical (HO), whereas RNS included peroxynitrite (HO–NO2)
  and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In this study, the toxic species, ROS, and RNS were
  considered the objectives for evaluating adverse effects.'
