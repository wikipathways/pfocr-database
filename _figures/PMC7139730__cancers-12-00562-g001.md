caption: 'The major cell death pathways: Apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. Apoptosis:
  DNA injury, stress, toxic accumulation, and nutrient or growth factor deficiency
  may result in the disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity to induce the release
  of cytochrome c from the mitochondria intermembrane space, where a number of Bcl-2
  family proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-2-like protein 4 (Bax), Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer
  (Bak), and Bcl-xL, regulate cytochrome c release. Further, cytochrome c can associate
  with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to activate caspase-3 and induce apoptosis in the intrinsic
  pathway. The binding of FasL or TNF-α or TRAIL to their respective receptors will
  convert procaspase-8 by autohydrolysis into caspase-8. The triggered caspase-8 activates
  caspase-3, followed by apoptosis in the extrinsic pathway. Autophagy: This process
  is achieved by induction, development of phagophore and lysosome fusion for degradation.
  Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) stimulate the PI3K/Akt, which regulates mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is negatively regulated by 5’-AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK). The activated AMPK and inhibited mTORC1 leads to activation
  of unc-51-like kinase 1/2 (ULK1/2) complex, essential for the initiation of autophagy.
  Beclin-1 complex initiates membrane isolation accompanied by two ubiquitin-like
  protein-conjugated systems, such as autophagy-related protein 12 (Atg12) and light
  chain 3 (LC3) systems, involved in autophagosome formation, culminating in lysosome
  fusion with autophagosome to hydrolyze all unnecessary cellular substances. Necroptosis:
  The TNF tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) signaling system stimulates the complex
  consisting of TNFR1-associated death domain protein, FAS-associated death domain
  protein, receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) involved
  in high-level RIPK3 transition, and mixed lineage kinase-like protein development,
  resulting in necrosome formation and disruption to the membrane and necroptosis.'
