caption: Interaction of TOR pathway members for the regulation of phagocytosis. TORC2
  is composed of subunits TOR, Rictor(Pia), Sin1(RIP3) and Lst8; TORC2 suppresses
  phagocytosis. TORC1 is composed of subunits TOR, Raptor and Lst8 and phosphorylates
  4E-BP; TORC1 promotes growth. TORC1 requires Raptor for function and does not regulate
  phagocytosis. Rapamycin in complex with FKBP12 rapidly disrupts TORC1 stability
  and represses phosphorylation of 4E-BP and inhibits growth. Long-term rapamycin
  treatment will partially inhibit TORC2 activity and stimulate phagocytosis. This
  process requires FKBP12 and Raptor and cannot further stimulate phagocytosis in
  cells lacking Rictor(Pia) or Sin1(RIP3). In Dictyostelium, neither Rheb nor Lst8
  are required for growth, but loss of either increases growth sensitivity to rapamycin
  (our unpublished observations); thus Rheb appears to potentiate the action of TORC1.
  Rheb is negatively regulated by TSC2, which is negatively regulated by the AGC kinases
  AKT and PKBR1. In Dictyostelium, AKT activity requires PI3K for membrane localization
  and coordinated phosphorylations within the kinase domain (by PDK1) and the C-terminal
  regulatory motif [by TORC2(PDK2)] () and is antagonized by PTEN. PKBR1 activity
  also requires phosphorylation by PDK1 and TORC2, but unlike AKT, PKBR1 does not
  require PI3K for membrane localization or activation (); in Dictyostelium, PI3K
  and PTEN do not regulate either PDK1 or TORC2 (). AKT and PKBR1 are basally phosphorylated
  at both kinase and regulatory sites in Dictyostelium growing in axenic culture ().
  Although, PKBR1 requires Rictor(Pia), Sin1(RIP3) and Lst8 for both of these basal
  phosphorylations, AKT is basally phosphorylated regardless of Rictor(Pia), Sin1(RIP3)
  or Lst8 (), perhaps suggesting a different kinase complex (PDK2?). In growing Dictyostelium,
  AKT is the predominant AGC kinase (). Both AKT and PKBR1 regulate macropinocytosis,
  but the contribution of PKBR1 is minor. Thus, loss of TOR, Rictor(Pia), Sin1(RIP3)
  or Lst8, which do not effect basal AKT, has minimal effect on macropinocytosis.
  Rapamycin only partially inhibits AKT and PKBR1 and also has only minimal effect
  on macropinocytosis. Loss of AKT, PKBR1 and Rheb activates phagocytosis. Loss of
  TSC2 suppresses phagocytosis. Activated Rheb suppresses phagocytosis through a mechanism
  that is independent of AKT and PKBR1, but that requires TORC2 components Rictor(Pia),
  Sin1(RIP3) and Lst8. Because TORC1 activity does not regulate phagocytosis, activated
  Rheb could function upstream of TORC2 in this pathway.

  description: Interaction of TOR pathway members for the regulation of phagocytosis.
    TORC2 is composed of subunits TOR, Rictor(Pia), Sin1(RIP3) and Lst8; TORC2 suppresses
    phagocytosis. TORC1 is composed of subunits TOR, Raptor and Lst8 and phosphorylates
    4E-BP; TORC1 promotes growth. TORC1 requires Raptor for function and does not
    regulate phagocytosis. Rapamycin in complex with FKBP12 rapidly disrupts TORC1
    stability and represses phosphorylation of 4E-BP and inhibits growth. Long-term
    rapamycin treatment will partially inhibit TORC2 activity and stimulate phagocytosis.
    This process requires FKBP12 and Raptor and cannot further stimulate phagocytosis
    in cells lacking Rictor(Pia) or Sin1(RIP3). In Dictyostelium, neither Rheb nor
    Lst8 are required for growth, but loss of either increases growth sensitivity
    to rapamycin (our unpublished observations); thus Rheb appears to potentiate the
    action of TORC1. Rheb is negatively regulated by TSC2, which is negatively regulated
    by the AGC kinases AKT and PKBR1. In Dictyostelium, AKT activity requires PI3K
    for membrane localization and coordinated phosphorylations within the kinase domain
    (by PDK1) and the C-terminal regulatory motif [by TORC2(PDK2)] () and is antagonized
    by PTEN. PKBR1 activity also requires phosphorylation by PDK1 and TORC2, but unlike
    AKT, PKBR1 does not require PI3K for membrane localization or activation (); in
    Dictyostelium, PI3K and PTEN do not regulate either PDK1 or TORC2 (). AKT and
