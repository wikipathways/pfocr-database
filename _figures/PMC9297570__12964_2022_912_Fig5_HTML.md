caption: hTid-1 in the regulation of cancers. A In Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  cells, hTid-1 Interacts with Galectin-7, causing the attachment of poly-ubiquitin
  chains to Galectin-7 and its subsequent degradation via the proteasomal pathway.
  B In Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer cells, hTid-1S increases the mitochondrial import
  of EGFR which increases the migration and invasiveness of these cells, while hTid-1L
  causes the attachment of poly-ubiquitin chains to EGFR and its subsequent degradation
  via the proteasomal pathway. C In breast cancer cells, hTid-1L causes the attachment
  of poly-ubiquitin chains to ErBb2 and its subsequent degradation via the proteasomal
  pathway. D In Colorectal cancer cells, increased expression of hTid-1L and Hsp70
  enhances the metastasis of these cells. E In Gliomas, increased expression of hTid-1L
  stops cell growth, while increased expression of hTid-1S has been observed to inhibit
  cell proliferation, causing apoptosis of SF767 cells and growth arrest of U373 and
  U87 cells
