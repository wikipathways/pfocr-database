caption: Left, In wild-type muscle, lipin-1 converts PA to DAG, providing substrate
  for TAG synthesis and activating PKD, with subsequent activation of Vps34 during
  autolysosome assembly. These steps allow normal autophagy flux. Right, In lipin-1
  deficiency (red arrows and lines), the lipin-1 enzyme substrate, PA, accumulates
  and DAG levels are reduced. This causes impaired TAG synthesis, reduced PKD/Vps34
  activation (active forms signified by asterisk), and reduced autophagic flux. Statin
  treatment has similar effects as lipin-1 deficiency at some points (blue arrows
  and lines). Statins cause increased PA accumulation and reduced PKD activation both
  in wild-type and lipin-1–haploinsufficient backgrounds. In addition, statin treatment
  in combination with lipin-1-haploinsufficiency or lipin-1 deficiency causes reduced
  mTOR activation, and autophagy initiation. The net result of statin treatment and
  reduced lipin-1 activity is to increase autophagy initiation, but prevent optimal
  flux through the pathway, leading to impaired autophagy clearance.
