caption: Ulysses’ voyage as a metaphor for the diagnostic pathway of the patient with
  suspected coronary artery disease. At the end of the first round of this odyssey,
  the cumulative cost is more than 100 times a simple exercise-electrocardiography.
  The cumulative radiation dose is that of more than 4,000 chest x-rays. The cumulative
  damage (including acute, subacute, and long-term risks) will cause a serious health
  detriment (including infarction, renal insufficiency, or cancer) in about 5–10%
  of patients.
