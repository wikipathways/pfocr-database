caption: Schematic of the mechanism of EGCG in attenuating NAFLD. Lipotoxicity induced
  from HFD can induce ROS, and activating ROS and chronic inflammation suppress FGFR
  expression, leading to a compensatory increase in FGF21 synthesis and secretion.
  It can inhibit AMPK pathway and Nrf2 pathway. The damage was reversed after administration
  of EGCG
