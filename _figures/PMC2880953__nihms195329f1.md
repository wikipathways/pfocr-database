caption: Diagram of the RA pathway. An RA-producing cell (left) shows the biosynthetic
  pathway for RA and a responding cell (right) shows signaling and catabolism, although
  RA also likely acts in the cells that produce it. Retinyl esters and beta-carotene
  are important stores of RA precursor. Green dashed arrows point to components of
  the pathway induced by RA signaling. The red line denotes repression of aldh1as
  by RA. Once made, RA (yellow circles) enters cells and binds Crabps (blue ovals),
  which transport it either to RARs (blue and green ovals) in the nucleus (orange)
  for signaling or to Cyp26s (red hexagon) for degradation. ROH, retinol; RAL, retinal;
  adhs, alcohol dehydrogenases; aldh1as, aldehyde dehyrogenase 1as.
