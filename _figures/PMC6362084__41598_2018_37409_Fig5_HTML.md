caption: Schematic of activated TLR4 signal inhibited by neurosteroids. LPS and GABAAR
  α2, respectively activate the TLR4 signal in RAW246.7 cells and P rat VTA. Signal
  activation initiates with LPS-induced TLR4/MD-2 complex formation at the cell surface
  in RAW246.7 cells and TLR4/GABAAR α2 or TLR4/MyD88 complex formation in the P rat
  VTA. Complex formation is followed by the intracellular signal, one direction of
  which is the (MyD88)-dependent pathway that activates TRAF6 and TAK1 and results
  in the activation (phosphorylation) of the transcription factors NF-κB and CREB.
  An alternate pathway activates PKA/CREB. Activated (phosphorylated) transcription
  factors translocate to the nucleus and initiate the production of various proinflammatory
  mediators, including TNFα. 3α,5α-THP inhibits both the LPS/TLR4/MD-2 and α2/TLR4
  complex formation and pregnenolone (Preg) inhibits the LPS/TLR4/MD-2 complex formation
  and thereby, both inhibit resulting intracellular signaling. The LPS-stimulated
  TLR4/MD-2 interaction also initiates the ability of LPS to increase HMGB1 expression,
  and this is also inhibited by 3α,5α-THP and pregnenolone in RAW246.7 cells, apparently
  through inhibition of the TLR4/MD-2 complex formation. Released HMGB1 can bind TLR4
  or/and modulate the production of proinflammatory mediators through NF-κB-dependent
  or NF-κB-independent signaling pathways (dashed lines),,,.
