caption: Tumor suppressive role of HNF4α. Schematic diagram depicting the published
  mechanisms of the tumor suppressive role of HNF4α in cancer. (A) HNF4α is involved
  in EMT and stemness regulation through Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. (B) HNF4α
  is regulated by miRNAs, affecting the metabolic enzymes and cellular biology via
  NOTCH signalling pathway. (C) HNF4α could induce cell cycle arrest and inhibit cell
  proliferation by competing binding of p21 promotor region to c-Myc protein. (D)
  HNF4α regulates non-coding RNA expression to control the metastasis gene expression
  through YAP/Hippo pathway and NF-κB signalling. ADAM17, ADAM metallopeptidase domain
  17; Bmp7, bone morphogenetic protein 7; CDKN1A, Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor
  1A; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Fus, FUS RNA binding protein; HNF4α,
  hepatocyte nuclear receptor 4 α; miR, microRNA; Rrm2, ribonucleotide reductase regulatory
  subunit M2; Set, SET nuclear proto-oncogene.
