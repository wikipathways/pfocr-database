caption: A proposed signaling pathway involved in Taurine against H2O2-induced oxidative
  damage. Schematic diagram shows that aurine activates Nrf2, induces expression of
  antioxidant enzymes (NQO1, HO1, and GCLC), and reduces H2O2-induced cell death by
  activating ERK and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in osteoblast cells. In addition, partial
  reduction of ERK, antioxidants, and ALP activity by a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor suggest
  the involvement of other signaling molecules and pathways.
