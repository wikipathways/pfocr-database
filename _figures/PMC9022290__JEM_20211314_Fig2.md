caption: CD36 mediates macrophage activation. oxLDL binds to extracellular domains
  of CD36, which promotes both signaling cascades and lipid uptake. The CD36 cytosolic
  tail recruits a signalosome complex including SFKs, JNK1/2, and Vav, which is also
  enhanced by NOX-derived ROS. Both signalosome and ROS (by inhibition of SHP-2) activate
  focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which leads to dysregulated cytoskeletal dynamics.
  Meanwhile, extracellular LCFA is transported into the cell via CD36 and then into
  mitochondria matrix through a series of transport machinery interactions including
  FABP4, ACSL1, CPT1, and CPT2. LCFA influx to mitochondria facilitates a metabolic
  switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis, accompanied by a reduction in FAO and increase
  in ROS production. The signaling cascades and metabolic switch in combination results
  in NF-κB pathway activation and proatherogenic responses including pro-inflammatory
  activation, oxLDL uptake, foam cell formation, and trapping of macrophages in the
  neointima.
