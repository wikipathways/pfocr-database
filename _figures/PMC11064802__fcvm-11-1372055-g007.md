caption: Mechanisms of action of carbohydrates in atherosclerosis therapy. Carbohydrates
  prevent against lipid accumulation by enhancing PPARα/PPARγ–liver X receptor (LXR)–ABC
  transporter and PPARα–mediated fatty acid β-oxidation. Alternatively, some polysaccharides
  alleviate lipid accumulation by suppressing fatty acid synthesis-related genes including
  PPARγ, fatty acid synthase, and sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c
  potentially through up-regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the
  liver. Furthermore, they inhibit phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase
  B (AKT/PKB)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK)/nuclear factor kappa B (NK-κB) signaling pathways to suppress inflammation.
  In the small intestine, carbohydrates decrease cholesterol absorption and increase
  cholesterol excretion by decreasing the level of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein
  and enhancing the LXR/ABCG5/8 signaling pathway, respectively. Moreover, carbohydrates
  suppress inflammation by inhibiting Toll-like receptor (TLR)/myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88)/NF-κB and modulating PPARγ/NK-κB signaling pathway
