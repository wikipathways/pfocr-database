caption: 'Enrichment for TCA cycle pathway in input datasets. A solid line presents
  a chemical reaction controlled by one or more enzyme. A dot line indicates adjacent
  metabolic pathway. Each Uniprot entry is divided by four squares, each representing
  a log2FC for a comparison between contaminated and reference plots, from left to
  right: K × B, K × L, M × B, M × L. The top line of the Uniprot entry is transcriptomic
  input, and bottom part is proteomic. The blue colour of a square reflects downregulation
  and red—upregulation. If a biological feature is significant for any of the omics
  data layers, it is highlighted by a thicker border and a red mark at the top right
  corner. A single databox can represent one or more biological features, where only
  the entry of the most significant feature will be shown. In this case, a green mark
  in the bottom right corner indicates one or more hidden features that share functions
  or contribute equally to the biological process. The metabolomic data can be seen
  as red or blue spots in the white circles, where usually, red means upregulation,
  and blue—downregulation. For more detailed data, please refer to . The figure was
  created with PaintOmics 4.'
