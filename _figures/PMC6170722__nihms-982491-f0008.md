caption: Schematic representation of insulin resistance-mediated mechanisms in LECs.
  Under normal physiologic conditions, insulin stimulates eNOS phosphorylation via
  PI3K/Akt signaling that regulates NO production. LEC junctions are well regulated
  via adherens junctions in the normal state, thus maintaining lymphatic function.
  However, the onset of insulin resistance impairs the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway, diminishing
  NO production, and impairs mitochondrial function in LECs. These mechanisms further
  disrupt the endothelial membrane integrity by disrupting the adherens junction and
  thus increase LEC permeability and activate proinflammatory signaling, together
  leading to impaired lymphatic function.
