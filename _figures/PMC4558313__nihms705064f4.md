caption: (A) In the liver of obese humans and animal models, the UPR is activated
  and the phosphorylation of IRE1 (inositol required 1), PERK (PKR-like endoplasmic
  reticulum localized kinase), and eIF2α are increased. However, the levels of sXBP1
  and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) activity are decreased in obesity in
  the liver (similar to beta cells). Due to changes in ER membrane composition (increased
  ratio of PC/PE) the transport of Ca2+ from cytosol to ER lumen by SERCA is impaired,
  leading to decreased Ca2+ levels in ER. Also, in the liver of obese animals IP3R1
  expression and activity are increased, which contributes both to decreased levels
  of ER Ca2+ and increased cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+. In the mitochondria,
  Ca2+ overload correlates with increased oxidative stress (ROS) and decreased oxidative
  function. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ also affects several cellular pathways such as
  autophagosome accumulation, and activates proteases such as calpain that cleaves
  and degrades ATG7. Both phenomena culminate in decreased autophagy, as seen in liver
  in obesity. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ also activates calcineurin leading to dephosphorylation
  of CRTC2 and its nuclear translocation, and activates CaMK to phosphorylate FOXO,
  with a direct impact on gluconeogenesis. CaMK also phosphorylates p38 and JNK leading
  to increased inflammation.In both adipocytes (B) and macrophages (C) of obese animal
  models, the UPR is activated and the phosphorylation of IRE1, PERK, ATF6 and eIF2α
  are increased. (B) In hypertrophic adipocytes there is increased deposition of Ca2+
  surrounding the lipid droplets and increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels. NFAT transcription
  factors isoforms 2 and 4 are induced in obese adipose tissue driving expression
  of inflammatory genes. TRPV4 (Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily
  V member 4) is a Ca2+-permeable ion channel that was first identified as an osmolality
  sensor. In adipocytes, it acts as a negative regulator of PGC1α and a positive regulator
  of inflammatory genes and proteins and JNK activity. These effects are related to
  the activation of ERK1/2. (C) Macrophages derived from obese animals show increased
  IP3R1 and ERO1α activity, which leads to higher Ca2+ release from ER to cytosol.
  In addition reduced levels of SERCA2b mRNA and protein expression is observed in
  this condition. Rise in cytosolic Ca2+ and mitochondrial oxidative stress have been
  shown to engage the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. In addition, the alterations in
  macrophage activity in obesity have been shown to activate CaMKK (Calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase kinase 2), the deletion of which leads to impaired cytokine secretion
  and phagocytosis and induces morphological changes.
