caption: Overall metabolism of citrulline in the urea cycle and of calcitroic acid
  secretion into the bile. Citrulline is an important intermediate of the urea cycle
  in the liver and is primarily synthesized from arginine and glutamine in the enterocytes.
  Citrulline is essential for the synthesis of arginine, which in turn produces nitric
  oxide. On the other hand, calcitroic acid has a less defined biological role. Calcitroic
  acid is an end product of 1α,25-(OH)2D3 metabolism through a C-24 oxidation by mitochondrial
  CYP24 enzyme and is secreted into the bile []. Osteoblasts, kidneys and intestine
  metabolize 1α,25-(OH)2D3 through this oxidation pathway, which is an important regulatory
  pathway for dihydroxyvitamin-D3.
