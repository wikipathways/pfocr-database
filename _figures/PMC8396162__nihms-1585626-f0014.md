caption: 'Initiation: exogenous and constitutive (i.e. genomically encoded such as
  dsRNA, piRNAs) triggers direct RDE-3 to pUGylate RNAs previously fragmented by factors
  in the RNAi pathway. Maintenance: pUG RNAs are templates for 2° siRNA synthesis
  by RdRPs. Argonaute proteins (termed WAGOs) bind 2° siRNAs and: 1) target homologous
  RNAs for transcriptional and translational silencing,,,, as well as 2) direct the
  cleavage and de novo pUGylation of additional mRNAs. In this way, cycles of pUG
  RNA-based siRNA production and siRNA-directed mRNA pUGylation maintain silencing
  over time and across generations. This model shows germline perinuclear condensates
  termed Mutator foci as the likely sites of pUG RNA biogenesis in germ cells for
  several reasons. RDE-3 localizes to Mutator foci and we show in  that endogenous
  pUG RNAs localize to Mutator foci. The fact that enzyme and enzyme product both
  localize to Mutator foci suggests that Mutator foci may be sites of RNA pUGylation.
  In addition, while pUG RNAs are still made in mut-16 mutants (-), which lack Mutator
  foci, the levels of both dsRNA-triggered and endogenous pUG RNAs are misregulated.
  Thus, while RDE-3 still has enzymatic activity in the absence of Mutator foci, these
  perinuclear condensates are likely coordinating target recognition and pUGylation
  in wild-type animals. Indeed, both the endonuclease RDE-8, which cleaves mRNAs targeted
  by dsRNA, and the RdRP RRF-117 also localize to Mutator foci, further suggesting
  that pUG RNA/siRNA cycling occurs in Mutator foci.Previous studies have shown that
  animals lacking RDE-3 still produce some 22G endo- siRNAs, including 22G siRNAs
  that associate with the Argonaute CSR-1 and whose biogenesis depends upon the RdRP
  EGO-1,. Thus, EGO-1 may also produce some 22G siRNAs via a pUG RNA-independent mechanism.A
  previous study showed that, in rrf-1 mutants that lack germlines, sel-1 RNAi causes
  a small fraction of sel-1 mRNA fragments to be uridylated in a largely RDE-3–dependent
  manner in the soma. This data suggests that, in somatic tissues, RDE-3 may add non-templated
  Us to the 3’ termini of mRNA fragments generated during RNAi. It was proposed that
  this uridylation may be important for turnover or decay of RNAi targets. Our work,
  combined with this earlier data about RDE-3–dependent uridylation, suggests two
  models. First, RDE-3 may possess two distinct catalytic activities: uridylation
  and pUGylation. According to this model, RDE-3 might add Us or UGs depending on
  context (e.g. cell/tissue-type or developmental timing). Alternatively, the mRNA
  uridylation observed in the soma could depend upon RDE-3 and the pUGylation system,
  but may be mediated by another, currently unknown, poly(U) polymerase.'
