caption: Regulated processing and secretion of VGF and its resulting downstream effects
  on microglia and neurons. (A) Action potential-mediated VGF mRNA synthesis is triggered
  by different factors, including conventional cell depolarization, the antidepressant
  imipramine, exercise, EGF, IL-6, insulin, NGF, BDNF and NT3. (B) VGF is translated
  in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where the signal peptide is removed to promote
  its sorting into the regulated secretory pathway. VGF promotes the biogenesis of
  immature LDCVs and targets itself into LDCVs in the Golgi apparatus. (C) Immature
  LDCVs containing VGF, PCs and other proteases are released from the Golgi apparatus
  and undergo homotypic fusion with other immature LDCVs. Inside the fused immature
  LDCVs, VGF is cleaved into a variety of active VGF-derived peptides by different
  proteases including PCs. (D) Anterograde axonal transport to the pre-synaptic terminal
  and local transport within the soma and to dendrites promotes condensation and maturation
  of LDCVs. (E) Mature LDCVs containing VGF and VGF-derived peptides undergo regulated
  secretion by exocytosis from the soma, dendrites, the axon and the pre-synaptic
  terminal. (F) VGF and VGF-derived peptides locally diffuse after regulated secretion
  where they bind to and activate different receptors on the soma, triggering action
  potentials and inducing VGF mRNA synthesis to rapidly replace VGF protein levels.
  (G) VGF and VGF-derived peptides, such as TLQP-62, diffuse across the synaptic cleft
  where they activate neuronal cell-surface receptors (). (H) VGF-derived peptides,
  such as TLQP-21 bind and activate microglial cell-surface receptors (). (I) Extracellular
  proteases cleave VGF and VGF-derived peptides, which reduces their active diffusion
  and is the only known mechanism for inhibiting their function. BDNF = brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor; EGF = epidermal growth factor; IL-6 = Interleukin-6; LDCV =
  large dense core vesicles; NGF = nerve growth factor; NT3 = neurotrophin-3; PC =
  prohormone convertase.
