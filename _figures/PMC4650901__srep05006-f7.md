caption: After entering the cells, UA-4 is hydrolyzed by amidase to be broken down
  to the carbon chain 6C and UA metabolite. The former competes with glucose for binding
  to hexokinase to inhibit cancer glycolysis pathway, while the latter produces depolarization
  in ΔΨm, cell arrest, ATP consumption, necrosis/apoptosis via caspase-independent
  pathway. 2-DG also inhibits glycolysis of cancer cells by targeting hexokinase.
  The dual targeting of cell necrosis/apoptosis and glycolysis pathways by using the
  safe and effective molecules represents a novel anticancer agent.
