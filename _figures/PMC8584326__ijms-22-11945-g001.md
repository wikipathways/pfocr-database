caption: Possible role of plant hormones in stress cross-tolerance. The biotic and
  abiotic stress factors are first sensed by the plant cell membrane and are transduced
  to specific downstream signaling pathways. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+
  play major roles as messenger molecules that initiate ABA-mediated cell signaling.
  It was discovered that ethylene-insensitive 2 (EIN2) and ethylene-responsive genes
  (ETR) of Arabidopsis are involved in ABA responses. They activate the ethylene-responsive
  transcription factors (ERFs), which are key regulatory hubs that integrate ethylene,
  ABA, and jasmonate signaling and thereby their corresponding responsive gene transcription.
  Brassinosteroids are perceived by the extracellular domain of Brassinosteroid-insensitive
  1 (BRI1)—a leucine-rich repeat kinase located in the plasma membrane. Upon perception,
  the intercellular serine–threonine kinase domain of BRI1 becomes phosphorylated
  and dissociates to form a complex with a second receptor kinase BRI1-associated
  receptor kinase BAK1. This transduces the signal by inactivating another kinase
  Brassinosteroid-insensitive 2 (BIN2), thus activating Abscisic acid-insensitive
  5 (ABI5), a bzip transcription factor that regulates the transcription of ABA- and
  BR-responsive genes. Increased biosynthesis of SA occurs upon pathogen attack by
  effector perception via ICS/PAL pathway in plastids. Conversion of SA to methyl
  salicylate (MeSA) is catalyzed by SA methyltransferase (SAMT). MeSA diffuses into
  the cytoplasm, where it is converted back to SA and is distributed to the systemic
  tissues. Increased levels of SA in the cytoplasm lead to the disruption of oligomeric
  NPR1 into its monomers, migrating to the nucleus to activate transcription of SA-responsive
  defense genes including PR genes.
