caption: Notch ligand on a signal-sending cell binds [Jagged1, Jagged2, Delta-like
  1 (Dll1), Dll3, and Dll4] to a Notch receptor (Notch 1, 2, 3, and 4) on an adjacent
  signal-receiving cell. The triggered Notch receptor undergoes two sequential proteolytic
  cleavages to form a free Notch intracellular domain (NICD), the first cleavage in
  the extracellular region by ADAM10/17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase), and
  the second by γ-secretase activity of PS (preselin) within the transmembrane domain.
  The NICD translocates into the nucleus followed by interaction with a transcriptional
  repressor complex composed of CSL [C-promoter–binding factor (CDF-1) suppressor
  of Hairless/Lag-1; aka Recombining binding protein suppressor of hairless (RBP-J)]
  and other corepressors. The NICD–CSL interaction dissociates the repressor complex
  and recruits MAML (mastermind-like proteins) and coactivators such as p300 to release
  gene silencing and upregulate Notch target genes. Numb is an inhibitor of Notch
  signaling. In our proposed model for asymmetric cell division for latency, Notch
  signaling will be restricted in cells distal to the APC that contain Numb, maintaining
  Tcm and Tscm phenotype and HIV latency. Cells proximal to the APC will have decreased
  expression of Numb; thereby maintaining the capacity for Notch signaling, T-cell
  proliferation, NFκB activity, IFN-γ, and IL-2 production offering a favorable environment
  for HIV replication.
