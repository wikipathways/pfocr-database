caption: Role of Cdc42 in cell polarization during mating. (A) In response to a gradient
  of mating pheromones secreted by cells of the opposite mating type, haploid a or
  α cells polarize to form the mating projection (stage 1). Cdc42 and other polarity
  proteins localize to the tip of the mating projection. Actin cables and patches
  are also polarized towards the tip. Septins, which may be involved in defining membrane
  domains, localize as patches at the base of the mating projection. The signaling
  events at the shmoo tip, indicated by the black box in the a cell at stage 1, are
  illustrated in panel B. During cell fusion (stage 2), the membrane protein Fus1
  localizes to the cell-cell contact zone. Together with Cdc42, Bni1, and the polarisome
  component Spa2, Fus1 is involved in the localized delivery of secretory vesicles
  (black circles) to the cell-cell contact zone, leading to the eventual cell fusion.
  (B) Upon pheromone binding, the receptor Ste2 clusters and activates the heterotrimeric
  G protein, which anchors to the plasma membrane via the lipid-modified tails (indicated
  by the wavy line) of its α (Gpa1) and γ (Ste18) subunits. The GTP-bound α subunit
  dissociates from the β (Ste4)-γ complex. The βγ complex then triggers the activation
  of the MAPK cascade, resulting in transcriptional activation and G1 arrest. The
  activation of Gβγ also triggers polarized growth towards the pheromone gradient.
  The blue lines indicate protein-protein interactions (see the text for details).
  Rho1 has been shown to interact with the β subunit and is thus recruited to the
  shmoo tip. See Fig.  for the Rho1 pathway. For simplicity, extensive cross talks
  between the MAPK cascade and actin organization are not indicated here.
