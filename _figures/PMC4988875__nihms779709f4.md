caption: The coordinated synthesis of 3-methylcrotonyl ACP for incorporation into
  Lyngbya majuscula curacin A involves condensation of acetyl ACP and acetoacetyl
  ACP to form HMG ACP. Subsequent dehydration to 3MG ACP is followed by decarboxylation
  of 3MG ACP to form 3-methylcrotonyl ACP that is incorporated into curacin A. This
  pathway utilizes a reaction scheme for generation of 3MG ACP that is analogous to
  reactions in other systems that utilize CoA derivatives.
