caption: Proposed mechanism of ferroptosis in DMED. More polyunsaturated fatty acids
  (PUFAs) are catalyzed into lipid peroxides with the help of the upregulated ACSL4-LPCAT3-LOX
  pathway in DMED. The cystine-glutamate anti-transporter (system Xc-) transports
  cystine into the cell, which participates in the synthesis of glutathione. Less
  glutathione reduces lipid peroxides under the catalysis of decreased GPX4 expression
  in DMED. The above molecular changes were alleviated after GPX4-LV injection. Subsequently,
  the level of ferroptosis is reactively improved. The end result of these processes
  is the amelioration of erectile function in DMED.
