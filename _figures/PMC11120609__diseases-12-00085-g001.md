caption: Metabolic pathway of cyclophosphamide. The hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzyme
  (CYP) system (CYP2B6, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4) metabolises cyclophosphamide (CY) to 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide
  (4-HCY). Subsequently, 4-HCY is oxidised to its tautomer aldocyclophosphamide (AldoCY),
  absorbed by cells, and converted to phosphoramide mustard (PM) and acrolein via
  β-elimination. AldoCY can be oxidised to o-carboxyethylphosphoramide mustard (CEPM)
  by aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1)
