caption: Proposed model illustrating the mechanisms by which AMPK functions as a central
  metabolic switch that governs glucose and lipid metabolism and activation of this
  master switch serves as a danger signal to alert NKT cells to infection and malignancy.
  Once activated, AMPK reduces plasma insulin levels, suppresses ATP-consuming metabolic
  functions (such as synthesis of fatty acids, sterols, glycogen and proteins) and
  increases ATP-producing activities (such as glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation
  and mitochondrial biogenesis) to restore energy homeostasis. In this study, antigen
  presenting cells were pretreated with 2DOG, cobalt chloride, AICAR, A769662 and
  metformin to targeted several steps in this pathway, as indicated with red arrows,
  and found an enhanced CD1d-mediated NKT-cell activation. These data suggest that
  targeting cellular metabolism may serve as a novel means of inducing innate immune
  responses.
