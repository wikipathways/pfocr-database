caption: 'The enhancement of drug sensitivity via molecular therapies targeting tumor
  growth and antitumor immunity. Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2- and
  HER3-targeted antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) products, including topoisomerase I
  (Topo I) inhibitors such as trastuzumab deluxecan (T-DXd) and patritumab deluxecan
  (HER3-DXd), have considerable antitumor effects in patients who have undergone HER2-targeted
  therapy. These ADCs are internalized into cancer cells and release Topo I inhibitors
  that are not cross-resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes, leading to cell death.
  The released payload penetrates adjacent cancer cells through a bystander effect.
  The ADC sacituzumab govitecan targets trophoblast antigen 2 (Trop-2), a surface
  protein bound to the Topo I inhibitor SN-38, which is released intracellularly and
  extracellularly. Cell cycle inhibitors targeting cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6)
  in the G1–S phase transition have shown promise when used in combination with endocrine
  therapy for patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive HER2-negative breast cancer.
  The development of cancer stem cells (CSCs) with persisting drug resistance is a
  major obstacle in chemotherapy. CSC-targeting therapies, which target several signaling
  pathways involved in cancer survival, may be employed effectively in combination
  with conventional therapy to eradicate residual tumor cells for the curing of cancer.
  The combined use of anticancer drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-programmed
  cell death 1 (PD-1), anti-programed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and anti-cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibodies, enhances therapeutic efficacy by increasing
  antitumor immune activity. Abbreviations: MHC, major histocompatibility complex;
  TCR, T-cell receptor; APC, antigen-presenting cell. This figure was custom-made
