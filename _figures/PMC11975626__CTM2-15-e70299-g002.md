caption: Interactions between immune cells and cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs).
  CAFs can influence a variety of immune cells through the secretion of multiple factors.
  They can secrete mediators such as interleukin (IL)‐6, IL‐8 and transforming growth
  factor beta (TGF‐β) to promote or inhibit immune cell activity. In addition, they
  can secrete C‐X‐C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), which acts on the CXCR4 receptor
  on tumour cells to upregulate cylindromatosis (CYLD) and promote the deubiquitination
  of P62. Deubiquitinated P62 inhibits autophagy of PD‐L1, leading to activation of
  the PD‐1/PD‐L1 pathway. Concurrently, CAFs can overexpress Gal1 and directly inhibit
  T cell activity. Serum amyloid A (SAA) secreted by CAFs can act on TLR2/TLR4 receptors
  and drive the polarisation of macrophages towards M2 phenotypes. CXCL12 can also
  act on the receptors of M2 macrophages, prompting them to secrete CXCL5, which binds
  to the receptors on tumour cells to enhance the AKT signalling pathway and lead
  to epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). CAFs can also inhibit the function of
  NK cells through direct cell‐to‐cell contact. For myeloid‐derived suppressor cells
  (MDSCs), CAFs can secrete C–C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) to enhance the immunosuppressive
  function of MDSCs, upregulate MMP2 and ACTA2 in MDSCs, and cooperate with M2 macrophages
  to promote the remodelling of extracellular matrix (ECM)
