caption: The signalling pathway and key factors which regulated the mitochondrial
  energy metabolism in MSCs. PKCλ/ι can activate HIF-1α, while HIF-1α promotes glycolysis
  and decreases ROS level in MSCs. SIRT3 and PGC-1α can induce SOD2, which regulate
  the ROS levels and promote OXPHOS in MSCs. In addition, PGC-1α can stimulate mitochondrial
  biogenesis and respiration through induction of UCP2, which can increase thermogenesis
  upon activation. Mechanismly, SIRT1 induces phosphorylation of LKB1 by deacetylation
  of LKB1. LKB1 activates AMPK through phosphorylation of AMPK. And mTORC1 is a downstream
  target of AMPK, which is negatively regulated by AMPK, can phosphorylate PGC-1α.
  And also SIRT1 can directly deacetylate the phosphorylated PGC-1α. Therefore, LKB1,
  AMPK, and SIRT1 all participate in the regulation of PGC-1α. AMPK, Adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated
