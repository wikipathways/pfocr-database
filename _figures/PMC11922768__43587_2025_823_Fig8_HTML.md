caption: Proximity labeling proteomics reveals proteins associated with various subcellular
  organelles, the ubiquitin–proteosome system and cytoskeleton. These proteins and
  their signaling pathways are linked to biological functions, including protein turnover
  and vesicle fusion (green box); cytoskeletal dynamics (yellow box); lipid localization
  and transport (red box); and others (gray box). Highlighted here are selected newly
  identified and validated proteins, alongside those previously known to be enriched
  in PAASs, such as lysosomal proteins LAMP1 (ref. 4), cathepsin B and D14, RAGC14
  and PLD3 (refs. 47,48); autophagosome protein ATG9A112; endoplasmic reticulum proteins
  RTN3 (ref. 112) and RTN1 (ref. 113); cytoskeletal neurofilament protein114; microtubule
  protein TUBB3 (ref. 20); synaptic proteins synaptophysin5 and VAMP2 (ref. 14); as
  well as APP31, Tau (MAPT)26 and ubiquitin71,112 (Supplementary Table 2)
