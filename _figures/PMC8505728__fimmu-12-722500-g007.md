caption: C. neoformans leads to a highly differentiated network of associated metabolic
  pathways within permissive phagocytes and fungicidal (non-permissive) phagocytes.
  Using male and female BALB/c mice, phagocyte subsets were purified and incubated
  with C. neoformans strain H99 at 37째C, 5% CO2 for 2hrs at a ratio of 20:1. Following
  incubation, cells were collected and stored in TRIzol at -20째C until analysis. RNA
  purification and analysis was conducted by Novogene using SMARTer Stranded V2 library
  prep and samples were sequenced using the Illumina Platform. Differential expression
  analysis was compared between each macrophage and DC subset alone and when incubated
  with C. neoformans strain H99. Significant differences within gene expression were
  identified and grouped into predicted canonical (active) pathways using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. (A) Associated pathways containing overlapping
  genes when comparing male CD11b+ DCs interacting with C. neoformans to CD11b+ DCs
  alone. (B) Associated pathways containing overlapping genes when comparing female
  Ly6c- monocyte-like macrophages interacting with C. neoformans to Ly6c- monocyte-like
  macrophages alone. Connecting lines indicate pathways with shared genes. Boxes shaded
  from dark red to light red indicates a difference p < 0.05 from greatest to least,
  respectively. Data were generated from 2 independent female and 2 independent male
  mouse experiments (n=2 male and female experiments).
