caption: Schematic diagram of the possible mechanisms of action allowing n-3 polyunsaturated
  fatty acids to act in synergy with 5-fluorouracil on cancer cells. While 5-fluorouracil
  induces cell cycle arrest and pyrimidine misincorporation into DNA, eicosapentaenoic
  acid and docosahexaenoic acid hamper inflammation, angiogenesis, and cell migration
  through competitive inhibition of cyclooxygenase II metabolic pathway and induce
  DNA damage and cell membrane disruption through their peroxidation products. COX-2,
