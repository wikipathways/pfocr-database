caption: Pathophysiological events involving astrocytes in AD. Schematic representation
  of the molecular mechanisms linking the NF-κB pathway activation to AD pathogenesis.
  OS, abnormal neuroinflammatory response, and excitotoxic neuronal damage are related
  to several pathways of astrocyte dysfunction. In black are the elements common to
  the three mechanisms, namely the Aβ/RAGE/NF-kB interaction. In blue are the elements
  related to neuroinflammation. In red the elements related to OS. In green the elements
  related to neurotoxicity/excitotoxicity. Aβ, amyloid-beta; RAGE, receptor for advanced
  glycation products; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; RNS, reactive nitrogen species,
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; LP, lipid peroxidation; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor
  alpha; IL, interleukin; GSH, glutathione; SOD, superoxide dismutase; EAAT, excitatory
  amino acid transporter; BACE1, beta-secretase 1; NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor;
  AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; NADPH oxidase, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; Ca++, calcium; ABCC1, ATP-binding cassette
  subfamily C member 1.
