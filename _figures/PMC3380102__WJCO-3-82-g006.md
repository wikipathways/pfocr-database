caption: 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha induced regulation of hypoxia-induced carbonic
  anhydrase 9 expression in human tumor cells without or with stimulation. A: Under
  normoxic conditions in the tumour cell microenvironment, hypoxia-inducible factor-1
  alpha (HIF-1α) is rapidly degraded via the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor gene
  product (pVHL) - mediated proteasome pathway; B: Following a shift in tumour environment
  aeration conditions from normoxic to hypoxic aeration conditions, HIF-1α subunit
  becomes stable and translocates into the cellular nucleus and interacts with co-activators
  of which its transcription machinery consists if e.g. p300/CBP to modulate the transcriptional
  activity of numerous hypoxia inducible genes, such as carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9)
  in our case, and about 61 other hypoxia induced genes[]; C: When the cells are stimulated
  under normoxia with either interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha
  (TNF-α) or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), the transcription factor HIF-1α
  subunit becomes stable despite the oxygenation status of the tumour environment
  and translocates into the cellular nucleus and interacts with co-activators of which
  its transcription machinery consists of e.g. p300/CBP to modulate the transcriptional
  activity of CA9 with a similar expression to that under hypoxia; D: Experimental
  stimulation with either IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α or TGF-β1 under hypoxia increases the
  CA9 level to almost double the expression rate under hypoxic conditions with the
  stimulation of these cytokines due to increased HIF-1α translocation into the nucleus
  and increased binding rate to the hypoxia response element element within the CA9
  promoter region.'
