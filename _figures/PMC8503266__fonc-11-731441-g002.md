caption: Schematic diagram of merlin and Hippo pathway signaling. On the one hand,
  merlin initiates the Hippo pathway by directly activating mammalian STE20-like protein
  (MST1/2), which in turn phosphorylates large tumor suppressor homolog 1/2 (LATS1/2),
  or by recruiting LATS 1/2 to the plasma membrane for phosphorylation by MST1/2 kinases.
  The activated LATS1/2 directly phosphorylates Yes-associated protein (YAP) at Ser397
  and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) at Ser311, priming
  the neighboring phosphodegron motif for phosphorylation by CK1δ/ϵ kinases and multi-level
  control of YAP/TAZ levels. In parallel, merlin also translocates to the nucleus
  and blocks the activity of the nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1, which promotes
  the ubiquitylation of LATS1/2 to activate YAP. In merlin-deficient cells, YAP/TAZ
  accumulates in the nucleus and forms hybrid transcription factors with TEA domain
  (TEAD) family proteins to promote the transcription of pro-proliferative genes,
  including PTGS2 and miR-29. PTGS2 encodes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that catalyzes
  the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) to prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2), thus promoting
  PGE-2 mediated MAPK, ERK, PI3K pathway. By inducing miR-29, YAP can also inhibit
  the translation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a broadly downregulated
  tumor suppressor in vestibular schwannoma.
