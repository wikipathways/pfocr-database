caption: Possible mechanisms of acute and chronic stress-inducing different types
  of SGs. (A) When subjected to acute stresses, the stalled 48S PICs in eukaryotic
  cells serve as the 'nucleus' of SGs. The SG 'shell' consists of various dynamic
  RBPs. The assembly of SG 'cores' and 'shells' is largely driven by LLPS. The mRNA
  in SGs is able to resume translation after the stress is relieved. (B) Chronic stress
  may induce mutations and aggregation of DNA-binding proteins and RBPs, leading to
  abnormal LLPS and generating aberrant SGs. The deposited tau may cross-link with
  RBPs. As chronic stress persists, RBPs in normal SGs may also undergo mutations
  and the autophagy hydrolysis pathway of SGs is blocked. Normal SGs gradually change
  from liquid to gel/solid and persist, eventually inducing various diseases. (C)
  The typical RBPs in SGs, such as G3BP1, are the main targets of various viruses.
  The N protein in SARS-COV-2 integrates with G3BP1 into SGs, promoting the degeneration
  of SGs. In addition, after SARS-COV-2 enters human host cells, the initially synthesized
  NSP1 may block the channel of host mRNA to enter the 40S subunit but promote viral
  replication. SG, stress granule; RBP, RNA-binding protein; SARS-COV-2, severe acute
  respiratory syndrome-coronavirus disease; LLPS, liquid-liquid phase separation;
  G3BP1, G3BP SG assembly factor 1; TIA1, TIA1 cytotoxic granule associated RNA binding
  protein; RACK1, receptor for activated C kinase 1; NSP1, non-structural protein
  1; PICs, preinitiation complexes; PTM, post-translational modification.
