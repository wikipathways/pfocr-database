caption: Model for the role of mTORC1 signaling in suppression of lipolysis in adipocytes.
  The β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, a synthetic catecholamine, promotes triacylglycerol
  (TAG) breakdown (lipolysis) by activating a large heterotrimeric Gαs-protein that
  activates adenylate cyclase (AC), which converts ATP into cAMP. cAMP binds the regulatory
  subunits of protein kinase (PKA), thus dissociating the repressive regulatory subunits
  from the catalytic subunits. Catalytically active PKA phosphorylates downstream
  targets, including perilipin and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), which contribute
  to initiation of lipolysis together with several other lipases including ATGL (adipose
  triacylglycerol lipase) and MGL (monoacyl lipase), ultimately leading to the breakdown
  of TAG into free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol. mTORC1 signaling suppresses lipolysis
  by either acting on common lipolytic targets (e.g., HSL, others?) via a pathway
  parallel to PKA or by converging on PKA to inhibiting its function. By inhibiting
  mTORC1 signaling, rapamycin synergizes with the PKA pathway to promote lipolysis,
  thus reducing TAG storage; therefore, mTORC1 signaling suppresses lipolysis, thus
  augmenting TAG storage
