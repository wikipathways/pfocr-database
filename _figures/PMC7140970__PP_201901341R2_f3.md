caption: 'Auto-regulation of nodulation and mycorrhizal symbioses share overlapping
  signalling pathways.Nod-factors activate a RWP-RK transcriptional regulator LjNIN
  which positively regulates nodule organogenesis, but also initiates long-distance
  negative regulation by activating LjCLE-RS transcription. Nitrate sufficiency induces
  nuclear accumulation of paralogous NLPs LjNRSYM1 and MtNLP4to transcriptionally
  activate overlapping sets of CLE-RS (red). How AMS activate CLE-RS transcription
  is currently unknown. In both cases, CLE peptides are transported to the shoot where
  they activate by direct binding (shown for LjCLE-RS2 to LjHAR1) or via possible
  co-receptors to activate CLAVATA1-like RLKs (LjHAR1/MtSUNN1/GmNARK/BdFON) MtCORYNE
  as well as LjCLV2/PsSYM28, which initiate less understood signaling cascades to
  generate a shoot-to-root signal. LjKLAVIER (KLV) is another LRR-RLK involved. LjHAR1
  activation reduces miR2111 levels, allowing TOO MUCH LOVE (TML) in the roots to
  negatively regulate RNS. LjHAR1 also activates shoot cytokinin production, another
  shoot-to-root signal. Signals downstream of HAR1/SUNN/NARK/FON to inhibit AMS are
  unclear, except for its effect on reducing strigolactone (SL) biosynthesis and export
  in the roots. In parallel, C-terminal encoded peptides (e.g. MtCEP1) also acts systemically
  on shoot MtCRA2 to positively regulate RNS via an unknown shoot-to-root signal,
  but this require common symbiosis signaling pathway and ethylene receptor ETHYLENE
  INSENSITIVE 2. Species prefix as in  except: Bd, Brachypodium distachyon.AON, autoregulation
  of nodulation; AOM, autoregulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis.'
