caption: The effect of angiogenesis in CRC. When colorectal cells are chronically
  stimulated by inflammation, mechanisms that trigger abnormal cell proliferation
  are activated. Simultaneously, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is abnormally
  activated, resulting in increased expression of VEGF and VEGF2-factors associated
  with angiogenesis. This further promotes the proliferation of cancer cells and the
  formation of blood vessels. (The figure was created by Figdraw, https://www.figdraw.com/static/index.html#/)
