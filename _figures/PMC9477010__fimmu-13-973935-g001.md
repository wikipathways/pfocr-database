caption: Schematic molecular mechanisms representation of pyroptosis pathway. Numerous
  factors such as DAMPs and PAMPs trigger the canonical inflammasome pyroptosis pathway
  to occur and activate pro-caspase-1. Cytoplasmic sensors of those stimuli include
  NLRs, AIM2, and Pyrin. Pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 then mature as a result of activated
  caspase-1. In the non-canonical pathway, activated caspase-11/4/5 is facilitated
  by direct recognition of intracellular LPS. Activated caspase-1/11/4/5 release the
  N-terminal domain of GSDMD (GSDMD-N) from the auto-inhibitory C-terminal domain
  of GSDMD (GSDMD-C) by cleaving full GSDMD. When GSDMD-N reaches the plasma membrane,
  it oligomerizes and creates a pore that ultimately aids in cell lysis. The formation
  of pore supports the secretion of intracellular content (HMGB1, LDH, ATP) and the
  inflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β activated by caspase-1. Caspase-8 may additionally
  cleave GSDMD and GSDMC through other pyroptosis pathways. Besides it, caspase-3/4/9,
  granzyme B (GZMB), and granzyme A (GZMA) may all act on GSDME and GSDMB, respectively.

  description: Schematic molecular mechanisms representation of pyroptosis pathway.
    Numerous factors such as DAMPs and PAMPs trigger the canonical inflammasome pyroptosis
    pathway to occur and activate pro-caspase-1. Cytoplasmic sensors of those stimuli
    include NLRs, AIM2, and Pyrin. Pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 then mature as a result

    domain of GSDMD (GSDMD-C) by cleaving full GSDMD. When GSDMD-N reaches the plasma
    membrane, it oligomerizes and creates a pore that ultimately aids in cell lysis.
    The formation of pore supports the secretion of intracellular content (HMGB1,
