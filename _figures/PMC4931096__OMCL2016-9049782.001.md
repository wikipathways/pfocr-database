caption: Biosynthetic pathways and the transformation of H2S in the mammalian body.
  H2S is synthesized in the mammalian body via both enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways
  but the nonenzymatic pathway accounts for only a small portion of its production.
  CBS and CSE both use PLP and vitamin B6 as cofactors. In the presence of cysteine
  and more so in the presence of homocysteine, CBS catalyzes the production of H2S,
  and the condensations of homocysteine and serine are the most recognized reactions
  catalyzed by CBS. CSE uses L-cysteine as the substrate to form two gases, H2S and
  NH3, as well as pyruvate. MST and CAT produce H2S and pyruvate from 3-mercaptopyruvate,
  which is formed from L- or D-cysteine, and α-ketoglutarate, which is produced by
  CAT. Thiosulfate nonenzymatically produces H2S and all essential components of this
  nonenzymatic path are present in vivo. Thiosulfate can be converted into sulfite
  in the liver, kidney, or brain tissues via thiosulfate reductase or by thiosulfate
  sulfurtransferase in the liver. H2S is also released from thiosulfate and persulfides
  [, ].
