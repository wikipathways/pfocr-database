caption: Mechanism linking dyslipidaemia and gastric cancer. The left side of the
  figure shows the inflammatory mechanisms associated with HDL and LDL both inside
  and outside the vasculature, which in turn drive the activation of relevant signalling
  pathways and cytokine release. The right side of the figure shows the mechanisms
  associated with representative inflammatory factors involved in gastric cancer progression
  and angiogenesis
