caption: 'Integrative view of DENV-induced metabolic alterations in hepatic cells.
  (A) (Step 1) Mobilization of fatty acids from LDs appears to be essential for DENV
  replication, as supported by the results obtained by Heaton and Randall (). Fatty
  acids are transported to the mitochondrial matrix, where β-oxidation works as the
  main energy-supplying pathway for maintaining virus replication, as we show here.
  (Step 2) The oxidation of the large contingent of acetyl-CoA molecules generated
  in β-oxidation requires tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle feeding with oxaloacetate.
  Our results support the idea of an anaplerotic role of glucose in this context,
  with the pyruvate molecules generated in glycolysis being converted into oxaloacetate
  by the pyruvate carboxylase (PC) reaction. (Step 3) Indeed, here we have shown that
  glucose has great importance in the oxidation of endogenous fatty acids in DENV-infected
  cells, which may explain the high glucose uptake and the increase in its requirement
  during DENV replication, as reported by Fontaine et al. (). Interestingly, those
  authors showed in the same work an increase in the initial intermediates of glycolysis,
  glucose-6-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate and a reduction in the final intermediates
  of this pathway, 3-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and lactate. (Step 4)
  Although Fontaine et al. () interpreted their observations to represent the result
  of an activation of the glycolytic pathway during infection, we propose here an
  alternative view for these findings: infection would activate the pentose-phosphate
  pathway, which not only diverts the available glycolysis intermediates to use in
  other reactions but also provides NADPH for the fatty acid synthesis reactions.
  Accordingly, glucose may also be a source of carbons in the formation of ribose-5-phosphate,
  an important intermediate for the synthesis of nucleic acids which is required during
  viral replication. (Step 5) Heaton et al. () showed that DENV NS3 recruits fatty
  acid synthase (FASN) to the viral replication sites, stimulating its activity and,
  consequently, the synthesis of fatty acids in DENV-infected hepatic cells. Fatty
  acid synthesis is triggered by the accumulation of citrate in the cytosol, which
  acts both as the carbon source for malonyl-CoA formation and as a positive regulator
  of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In addition, citrate is an important negative regulator
  of the enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK), causing the accumulation of the initial
  glycolysis intermediates (as observed by Fontaine et al. []) and favoring the glucose-6-phosphate
  shift toward the pentose-phosphate pathway, which generates, besides ribose-5-phosphate,
  NADPH, the reduced coenzyme required by FASN reactions. (Step 6) Fatty acids are
  required for the synthesis of either the convoluted membranes or triacylglycerols
  (TGs), which might be stored in LDs, culminating with hepatic steatosis, already
  observed in DENV infection by Leong et al. (), Lawn et al. (), and Póvoa et al.
  (). The accumulation of lipids in the intracellular LDs seems to reduce the production
  of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), as already shown in the clinical studies
  by Cui et al. () and El-Bacha et al. (). (Step 7) Finally, here we showed that infection
  reduces the ability of hepatic cells to oxidize glutamine. This would be explained
  by the fact that this amino acid is essential for formation of glutathione, which
  in the reduced form (GSH) is an important antioxidant molecule. Glutamine may also
  be converted into other amino acids required during viral replication. The signals
  “+” and “-” indicate the steps that are activated and inhibited, respectively, during
  DENV infection, based on the literature (cited in red in the figure) or on the results
  presented here (highlighted by the arrows colored in green, in the case of the steps
  that we showed to be activated, or in red, in the case of the steps that we showed
  to be inhibited). (B) Proposed mechanism for the Crabtree effect. Here we found
  that both DENV infection and 2-DG treatment reverse the Crabtree effect in hepatic
  cells. Since in both cases cytoplasmic ATP-consuming reactions are stimulated (fatty
  acid synthesis in infection and phosphorylation of 2-DG by hexokinase after cellular
  treatment with this molecule), our results support the most accepted hypothesis
  to explain the Crabtree effect: the intense ATP synthesis during glycolysis results
  in a decrease in ADP availability, reducing its uptake by mitochondria, which impairs
  oxidative phosphorylation.'
