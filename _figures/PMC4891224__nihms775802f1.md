caption: (A) Depiction of the pathway in steady state. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
  activation by ligand binding stimulates PI3K which converts phosphoinositide bisphosphate,
  PI(4,5)P2 (PIP2), to phosphoinositide trisphosphate, PI(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3), which serves
  as docking site for the membrane localization of PH domain-containing molecules
  like PDK1 and AKT. PDK1 phosphorylates AKT at T308 and mTORC2 phosphorylates AKT
  at S473, leading to full activation of AKT. In turn, AKT phosphorylates FOXO, thus
  retaining it in the cytoplasm and preventing FOXO-mediated transcription of RTKs
  and ER. Pathway stimulation also activates mTORC1 which represses IRS-1, thus attenuating
  PI3K-PDK1-AKT signaling. (B) MK-2206 inhibits both AKT and downstream mTORC1 activity.
  As a consequence of this, there is relief of mTORC1-dependent feedback inhibition
  of IGFIR/IRS-1 signaling as well as AKT-repression of FOXO with subsequent upregulation
  of RTKs and stimulation of PI3K, PDK1 and other non-AKT targets downstream. Thus,
  inhibition of the AKT node is an intrinsically incomplete approach for effective
  blockade of the PI3K pathway. Effective inhibition of this pathway would require
  blocking different nodes and alternative signaling pathways in order to achieve
  antitumor activity in tumors with aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway.
