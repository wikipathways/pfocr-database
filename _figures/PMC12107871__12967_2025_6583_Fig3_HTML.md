caption: 'Schematic description of the signaling process demonstrating the intricate
  cross-talk between NF-κB and STAT3 in inflammation-induced cancer. Both NF-κB and
  STAT3 have the ability to activate autocrinally and/or paracrinally and to engage
  in collaborative activation. The NF-κB pathway is triggered by TNF-α, as evidenced
  by transcription of NF-κB genes, such as IL-6 and COX-2, and phosphorylation and
  nuclear translocation of NF-κB p50/p65. IL-6 is freshly synthesized and released
  from the cells, binding to the IL-6 receptor via autocrine or paracrine pathways.
  As a result, intracellular JAK1/2 kinases and the IL-6R/gp130 complex are activated.
  In addition, PGE2 is generated in response to freshly produced COX-2, causing phosphorylation
  and activation of STAT3. When JAK1/2 phosphorylates STAT3 proteins, they dimerize,
  reach the nucleus, and trigger STAT3 transcription, which increases the expression
  of genes that trigger cancer progression through the various stages of the disease.
