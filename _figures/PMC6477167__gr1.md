caption: The interplay between HPV-infected keratinocytes and the local immune microenvironment
  critically influences cervical carcinogenesis.HPV suppresses inflammatory signaling
  in the host keratinocyte. Subsequent low epithelial cytokine and chemokine production
  prevents Langerhans cell recruitment allowing viral immune escape and persistence.
  At the transition from precancerous lesions to invasive cancer, the IL-6 cytokine
  plays a pivotal role for chronic stromal inflammation and immune deviation. Monocytes
  with an activated IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway accumulate via autocrine CCL2 chemokine
  induction. These myeloid cells produce high amounts of MMP-9, a matrix-metalloproteinase
  promoting tumorigenesis and they can express the immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1
  that suppresses cytotoxic T cell activity. On the other hand, stromal fibroblasts
  respond to IL-6 with C/EBPβ activation. One consequence is the production of CCL20,
  a chemokine attracting Th17 cells. Another consequence of fibroblast C/EBPβ signaling
  is the secretion of IL-1β, which induces IL-23 in dendritic cells leading to Th17
  expansion further fueling inflammation. At the same time IL-6 suppresses NF-κB activity
  in dendritic cells, thereby impairing their CCR7-dependent migration to lymph node
  homing chemokines as well as their IL-12 production, which may contribute to the
  Th2 shift observed in vivo.
