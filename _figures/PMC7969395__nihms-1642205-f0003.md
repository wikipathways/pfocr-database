caption: Tumor cells carrying mutant p53 or apoptotic bodies can be engulfed by antigen
  presenting cells (APCs). The MHC II of APCs presents mutant p53-derived neoantigens
  to CD4+ T cells, which help B cells produce antibodies against the neoantigens.
  Most tumor cells express MHC I, which self-presents mutant p53-derived neoantigens.
  CD8+ T cells are activated through the interaction between MHC I and T cell receptors
  (TCRs). Activated CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T cells) can attack tumor cells. The tumor
  infiltrated lymphocytes (TILs), containing mostly CD8+ T cells and natural killer
  (NK) cells, can be isolated from tumors, propagated to a large number ex vivo, and
  given back to the patients to attack the tumors. TCRs specific to mutant p53-neoantigens
  can be cloned and packaged into viral particles to generate either TCR-T cells or
  CAR-T cells, which are infused back into the same patients.
