caption: Molecular map of pathways that lead ROS to cause OPC dysfunctioning in SZ.
  A molecular map is essential to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying
  the impairment of OPC functioning by ROS in the SZ PFC. The map shows that two cellular
  pathways result in a reduced activation of the mTOR-P70S6K pathway under conditions
  of increased ROS production and decreased antioxidant levels. The first pathway
  involves ROS-induced downregulation of PDGFRα, leading to sub-activation of the
  mTOR-P70S6K pathway. The second AMPK-related pathway leads to inhibition of the
  mTOR-P70S6K signalling cascade, as well as to downregulation of the transcription
  of proliferation- and differentiation-related genes. Inactivation of mTOR-P70S6K
  causes decreased protein synthesis for proliferation and differentiation, and consequently
  leads to OPC dysfunction. See section 'ROS can cause OPC dysfunctioning - Inactivation
  of the mTOR-P7056 pathway in SZ OPCs' for a description,  for the pertinent references
  and the list of abbreviations for full names of all components of the molecular
  map. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; OPC,
  oligodendrocyte precursor cell; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PFC, prefrontal
  cortex; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SZ, schizophrenia.
