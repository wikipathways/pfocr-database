caption: A schematic illustrating how mechanical stimulation activates Hh signaling
  in the primary cilium. (A) In the absence of mechanical stimulation, cilia do not
  activate nuclear GLI activity. In the presence of mechanical stimulation, the nuclear
  GLI activity activates the downstream targets of the Hh signaling pathway. (B) A
  cartoon indicates WT mice can build up muscle. However, SC cilium-dysfunctional
  mice show exercise resistance.
