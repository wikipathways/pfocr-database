caption: Effects of dietary restriction on lipid profile changes and healthspan. This
  figure summarizes the molecular mechanisms by which DR improves lipid profile and
  enhances the healthspan. DR impacts multiple pathways, including sirtuins, mTORC1,
  and the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, which regulate lipid metabolism in the
  liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. DR also promotes a healthy gut barrier
  and modulates commensal microbiota, enhancing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production
  and immune homeostasis. Through increased β-oxidation, reduced lipogenesis, and
  enhanced oxidative stress resistance, DR maintains lipid homeostasis, reduces oxidative
  damage, and improves membrane fluidity. These coordinated effects result in balanced
  lipid metabolism, improved health outcomes, and anti-aging benefits
