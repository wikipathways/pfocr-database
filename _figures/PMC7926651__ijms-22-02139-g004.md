caption: 'The main mechanisms of Kupffer cell activation during chronic ethanol exposure.
  Step 1: An increase in intestinal permeability, leading to the release of LPS into
  the systemic circulation and activation of the TLR4 receptor. Step 2: Activation
  of the complement system, in particular via LPS. Steps 1 and 2 lead to the production
  of chemokines, cytokines, and other pro-inflammatory mediators. Step 3: Oxidative
  metabolism of ethanol; ROS and acetaldehyde lead to an increase in TXNIP expression,
  activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (ii). Step 4: Hepatocyte damage due to the oxidative metabolism of ethanol results
  in the release of danger signals, including ATP. Step 5: Ethanol induces the expression
  of P2X7R, further sensitizing the cell to danger signals like ATP. Step 6: ATP activates
  the NLRP3 inflammasome via purinergic receptors. Step 7: Release of the chemokines,
  cytokines, and inflammatory mediators produced upstream. Abbreviations: DAMP: danger-associated
  molecular pattern; LPS: lipopolysaccharides; ROS: reactive oxygen species; TXNIP:
  thioredoxin interacting protein.'
