caption: (A). A simplified scheme of Hh pathway in which Hh releases the inhibition
  of Smo by Ptc and activated Smo alter the balance between the activator (CiA/GliA)
  and repressor CiR/GliR) forms of Ci/Gli. (B) Hhat catalyzes the palmitoylation of
  Hh and Disp is involved in the secretion of lipidated Hh. Hh induces phosphorylation
  of Smo by multiple kinases including PKA (Drosophila only), CK1 and GRK2, which
  is required for Smo activation. In the absence of Hh, full length Ci/Gli is phosphorylated
  by multiple kinases including PKA, GSK3 and CK1 and subsequently targeted to ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated
  proteolysis through Slimb/βTRCP to generate CiR/GliR. Smo inhibits Ci/Gli phosphorylation
  by PKA/GSK3/CK1 to block the production of CiR/GliR. Furthermore, high levels of
  Hh stimulate Fu/Ulk3/Stk36-mediated phosphorylation Ci/Gli to promote the formation
  of CiA/GliA by antagonizing Sufu. HIB/SPOP targets CiA/GliA for degradation, which
  is attenuated by CK1. Cos2/Kif7 plays dual role by promoting the formation of CiR/GliR
  in the absence of Hh but CiA/GliA in the presence of Hh.
