caption: 'The Sre1 regulatory pathway. (A) In wild-type yeast, when the Sre1–Scp1
  complex senses low ergosterol, it is transported out of the ER and cleaved to form
  the active transcription factor Sre1N. Ofd1 regulates the quantity and activity
  of Sre1N in an oxygen-dependent manner. We modeled Ofd1 as having six states: unbound,
  bound to Sre1N, or bound to Nro1 at low oxygen or high oxygen. Each state of Ofd1
  is degraded with the same rate coefficient (not shown). (B) In sre1N yeast, the
  subject of the model in this article, Sre1N protein is produced directly, bypassing
  the ergosterol-sensing step. Symbols used in the model equations are in parentheses
  below each chemical species.'
