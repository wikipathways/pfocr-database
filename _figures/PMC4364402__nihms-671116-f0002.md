caption: Models of peripheral and spinal itch circuitry. (a) Excitatory itch pathways.
  Sensory neurons have cell bodies in the DRG (blue) and project primary afferents
  to the skin, where a variety of transduction molecules reside and detect itch, touch
  and pain stimuli. These neurons also send projections to the dorsal horn of the
  spinal cord, where they synapse with secondary neurons (gray). Second-order spinal
  neurons connect with other dorsal horn interneurons and/or spinal thalamic projection
  neurons (green). Model 1 proposes that GRP is a peripheral itch transmitter that
  activates GRPR on secondary pruriceptors. Chloroquine, SLIGRL and the mast-cell
  degranulating compound 48/80 (48/80) all require functional GRP signaling to evoke
  itch. Histamine (Hist), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and endothelin-1 induce itch
  independent of GRP signaling. Model 2 proposes that BNP serves as a peripheral itch
  transmitter that activates secondary pruriceptors that express NPRA and GRP. These
  neurons then activate tertiary GRPR-expressing pruriceptors. Model 3 is a combination
  of models 1 and 2, in which BNP and GRP act in parallel as peripheral itch transmitters.
  GRP can be released by DRG neurons and NPRA-positive spinal neurons. BNP activates
  NPRA-expressing spinal interneurons, and GRP activates GRPR-expressing spinal interneurons.
  (b) Model for the inhibitory inputs of the itch pathway whereby tonic activity is
  inhibited by paired activation of the pain circuitry. A subset of VGLUT2-expressing
  nociceptors in the DRG and a subset of dorsal horn inhibitory interneurons expressing
  Bhlhb5 specifically suppress itch signal transmission. Connections that are unknown
  or controversial are shown as dashed magenta arrows. CQ, chloroquine.
