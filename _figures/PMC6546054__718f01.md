caption: The σS degradative pathway in E. coli. (A) Under active growth, σS (blue)
  is loaded by adaptor RssB (pink) onto ClpXP (gray) for rapid degradation. Exposure
  to stress signals induces the production of unrelated antiadaptor proteins (IraP,
  IraM, and IraD; green), which inhibit RssB and block σS degradation. RssB phosphorylation
  (red circle) enhances interactions with σS but is not an absolute requirement for
  regulated turnover (; ), consistent with a conformational equilibrium model in which
  RssB can assume the “on” conformation even in the absence of phosphorylation. RssB
  oligomerization has not been incorporated into this mechanistic scheme, and the
  role of desphosphoryation in promoting RssB recycling remains unaddressed. “N” and
  “C” indicate the NTD (receiver domain) and CTD (effector domain) of RssB, respectively.
  (B) Crystal structure of the RssB-like protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Protein
  Data Bank [PDB] ID 3EQ2).
