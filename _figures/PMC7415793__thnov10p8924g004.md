caption: Treg in cardiomyocyte regeneration. Treg is crucial in the repair of myocardium
  post-MI in both adult and neonatal mice. One mechanism proposed is the modulation
  of M2 macrophages, which promote the formation of scar tissue after MI. However,
  perhaps due to the different subtypes of M2 macrophages identified in neonatal and
  adult mice in the myocardium, Treg promotes the expression of M2 cytokines by M2
  macrophages in adults but suppresses them in neonatal mice post-MI. Another mechanism
  of promoting myocardium repair is through the production of adenosine from CD39
  expressed on Treg cell surface, and adenosine protects cardiomyocytes from apoptosis
  by activating RISK pathway. Treg can also directly influence the proliferation of
  cardiomyocytes in neonates and adults after MI. Even though adult cardiomyocytes
  do not possess inherent regeneration potential unlike neonatal cardiomyocytes, after
  MI, Treg promotes the proliferation of cardiomyocytes despite the mechanism remains
  unknown. Several paracrine factors released by Treg have been identified to promote
  neonatal cardiomyocytes proliferation, and they include CCL24, GAS7, AREG, CSR7,
  TNFSF11, IL33, FGL2, MATN2, and IGF2.
