caption: A hypothetical mechanism to explain how NO facilitates penile reflexes and
  copulation in male rats by increasing dopamine release in the medial preoptic area
  induced by glutamic acid released from glutamatergic synapses of neurons originating
  in the amygdala and in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis activated by sexual
  stimuli (e.g., those produced by a sexually receptive female rat) and controlling
  dopamine release from incertohypothalamic dopaminergic neurons. Briefly, NO—once
  formed by yet unidentified neurons/cells in the medial preoptic area—is released
  in the extracellular space and acts as a retrograde intercellular messenger on (i)
  dopaminergic synapses to potentiate dopamine release and facilitate copulation,
  and (ii) glutamatergic synapses to sustain glutamic acid release facilitating dopamine
  release, by activating a NO-cGMP signaling pathway. NO may also facilitate dopamine
  release from dopaminergic synapses by inhibiting the dopamine transporter (DAT),
  thus allowing dopamine to persist in the extracellular space and act for longer
  times on its receptors. (+) = activation; (-) = inhibition; (???) = unknown neurotransmitters.
