caption: CD147 respectively activates two distinct signaling pathways to regulate
  [Ca2+]i oscillations. On the one hand, CD147 phosphorylates FAK and Src to promote
  the activation of the IP3R1 channel, which increases Ca2+ release from ER stores
  and enhances the amplitude of [Ca2+]i oscillations. On the other hand, CD147 activates
  CaMKP to inhibit PAK1 phosphorylation and subsequently PP2A activation. CD147-inactivated
  PP2A enhances phosphorylation of PLB and increases SERCA pump activity, thus accelerating
  ER Ca2+ refilling and enhancing the frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations. Moreover,
  CD147-promoted ER Ca2+ release and refilling are tightly regulated by changing [Ca2+]i.
  Under low [Ca2+]i conditions, PTP-PEST-mediated FAK dephosphorylation is suppressed,
  thus facilitating CD147-mediated FAK signaling pathway activation and subsequently
  the activation of the IP3R1 channel. Meanwhile, low [Ca2+]i-inactivated CaMKII impairs
  CD147-induced CaMKP activation, thus blocking the activation of the SERCA pump by
  CD147. Therefore, CD147 may only induce IP3R1 channel activation under low [Ca2+]i
  conditions. However, under high [Ca2+]i conditions, activated CaMKII facilitates
  CD147-induced CaMKP pathway activation, thus promoting SERCA pump activity. Meanwhile,
  high [Ca2+]i-activated ERK1/2 promotes the dephosphorylation of FAK by PTP-PEST,
  thus antagonizing the phosphorylation of FAK by CD147 and subsequently blocking
  the activation of the IP3R1 channel by CD147. Therefore, CD147 may only induce SERCA
  pump activation under high [Ca2+]i conditions.
