caption: 'Summary and working model. A: current finding: selective RTN stimulation
  increases breathing without producing arousal from non-REM sleep, sighs, or increasing
  BP, whereas stimulation of the noradrenergic A5 neurons produces arousal with little
  apparent effects on breathing or mean BP. B: working model for the contribution
  of A5, C1, and RTN neurons to arousal, breathing, and autonomic activation by hypoxia
  and hypercapnia: hypoxia activates C1 and A5 cells by a pathway stimulated by the
  O2-sensing carotid body (CB) afferents and relayed via caudal commissural commissural
  nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) neurons. Systemic hypoxia may also activate
  C1 cells via intrinsic and local glial mechanisms (, , ). C1 cell stimulation reproduces
  most of the effects of hypoxia: arousal from non-REM sleep, sighs, and increases
  in breathing and BP (). C1 cells innervate and excite major wake-promoting systems,
  the orexinergic and noradrenergic neurons, including the locus coeruleus (A6), A5,
  A2, and A1 (, , ). Sighs may be triggered upon arousal by norepinephrine release
  at the pre-Bötzinger complex via β-adrenergic signaling (); sighs are probably linked
  to hypoxia via the same wake-promoting/vigilance systems. RTN regulates breathing
  selectively; CO2-induced arousal from non-REM sleep is not produced by RTN stimulation
  but is likely caused by 5HT and other wake-promoting systems that do not trigger
  sighs (not represented here; see Ref. ). A5 neurons also innervate sympathetic preganglionic
  neurons (SPNs; not represented), which may cause some blood flow redistribution
  bu t little change in mean BP. CPG, respiratory central pattern generator.'
