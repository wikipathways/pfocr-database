caption: Lipid metabolism in microglia under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.
  In microglia, CD36 and TREM2 play a key role in the response to extracellular lipids.
  CD36 promotes lipid-responsive signalling pathways (like the PPARγ and LXR pathways),
  which in turn increase FAO and further upregulate Cd36. TREM2 activation (via ligands
  such as ApoE) results in the suppression of homeostatic microglial genes (P2ry12,
  Tmem119, and Cx3cr1), the activation of mTOR signalling, and the upregulation of
  lipid processing genes (such as Apoe, Lpl, and Fabp5). Despite mTOR increasing both
  FAS (through the cleavage and activation of SREBP-1) and glycolysis (which are canonically
  associated with a pro-inflammatory activation of myeloid cells), it appears that
  the role of TREM2 is to support correct lipid metabolism. In fact,TREM2 deficient
  microglia show the formation of intracellular cholesterol crystals that activate
  the inflammasome pathway. On the contrary, the downstream gene Fabp5 seems to play
  a key role in determining the pro-inflammatory activation of myeloid cells, possibly
  via inhibition of PPARγ signalling and FAO. In pro-inflammatory microglia, a broken
  TCA cycle is coupled with an upregulated mitochondrial CIC, which increases citrate
  export from the mitochondria to the cytosol, where it is converted into acetyl-CoA
  for FAS by ACLY. The resultant increase in FAS supports the expansion of the ER
  and Golgi, and the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Green arrows
