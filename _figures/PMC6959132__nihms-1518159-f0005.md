caption: Pathway for signaling from p75–Nogo receptor complex to RhoA. Binding of
  myelin derived inhibitors (Nogo, MAG, and OMgp) on the NgR causes strengthening
  of p75 and Rho GDI-Rho GTP complex resulting in actin stabilization and inhibition
  of neurite outgrowth. B) Binding of anti-Nogo Ab or competitive antagonist for the
  Nogo-66 receptor such as NEP 1-40 have shown to decrease myelin induced growth cone
  collapse and promote neurite outgrowth.
