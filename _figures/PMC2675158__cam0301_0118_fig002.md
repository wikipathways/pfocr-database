caption: Trafficking itinerary of APP and BACE1. A schematic diagram of the trafficking
  itinerary of APP and BACE1. Both proteins have very similar itinerary and can be
  found in compartments of the exocytic pathway and endocytic pathway. Locations of
  general components of membrane traffic known to affect APP/BACE1 traffic, such as
  gamma-ear-containing ARF-binding (GGA) proteins and the retromer complex are also
  shown. Although presenilins are largely localized to the ER-Golgi region at steady
  state, these and other components of the γ-secretase complex also have widespread
  presence. Note that this is a general scheme which does not include detail depiction
  of neuronal domains such as axons and dendrites. Dark arrows indicate exocytic or
  anterograde transport and white arrow endocytic or retrograde trafficking. ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; ERGIC, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment; TGN, trans-Golgi network; EE,
  early endosome; RE, recycling endosome; LE, late endosome; L, lysosome.
