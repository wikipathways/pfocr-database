caption: (A) Steady state of KRAS mutant cells. Activating mutations of KRAS genes
  confer resistance to GAP-mediated K-Ras GTP hydrolysis, leading to uncontrolled
  activation of K-Ras downstream signaling and tumor growth. (B) Initial response
  to K-RasG12C inhibition. K-RasG12C inhibitors function by locking K-RasG12C in its
  GDP-binding state and hence suppress MAPK/ERK signaling and tumor growth. (C) Adaptive
  resistance to K-RasG12C inhibition. After initial response, ERK-mediated feedback
  inhibition of vertical RTKs/SHP2 pathway is lifted, which induces the activation
  of N-Ras, H-Ras, and K-RasG12C. Given that RTKs/SHP2 signaling pathway is hyperactive
  in this stage, newly synthesized K-RasG12C immediately binds with GTP, potentiating
  the feedback adaptive resistance. In addition, AURKA operates by interacting with
  GTP-bound K-RasG12C and promotes downstream RAF activation. Consequently, ERK is
  reactivated and tumor growth is resumed.
