caption: 'VBPs are biosynthesized via the shikimate pathway, and C6-C1, C6-C2 and
  C6-C3 pathways. Biosynthetic enzymes, e.g., 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate
  synthase (DAHPS), 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), chorismate
  mutase 1 (CM1), arogenate dehydratase (ADT), phenylacetaldehyde synthase (PAAS),
  phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate: CoA
  ligase (4CL), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), coniferyl alcohol acetyltransferase
  (CFAT), isoeugenol synthase (IGS), eugenol synthase (EGS), cinnamoyl-CoA ligase
  (CNL), cinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/dehydrogenase (CHD), 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT),
  benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol/2-phenylethanol benzoyltransferase (BPBT), S-adenosyl-L-methionine:benzoic
  acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BSMT), are involved. Black continuous
  lines represent one enzymatic step, whereas black dotted lines represent multiple
  enzymatic steps.'
