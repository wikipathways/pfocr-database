caption: Many anticancer agents mediate tumour cell killing though activation of the
  BCL-2-regulated apoptotic pathway. BH3-only proteins are activated transcriptionally
  and/or posttranscriptionally in a cytotoxic stimulus-specific manner by many anticancer
  agents, often with 2–3 members cooperating to induce apoptosis. BH3-mimetic compounds
  bind directly to and block the BCL-2 pro-survival proteins and thereby elicit apoptosis
  even in cells lacking upstream activators of BH3-only proteins, such as the tumour-suppressor
  p53, which is critical for transcriptional induction of Puma and Noxa
