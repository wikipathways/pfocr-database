caption: Effects of metabolites of probiotics on intestinal epithelial barrier. Indole
  3-propionic acid can bind to PXR and up-regulate the expression of tight junction
  protein. The indole-3-lactic acid activates AhRs of the gut epithelium and promotes
  the expression of IL-22. The soluble proteins P40 and p75 isolated from LGG can
  activate EGFR and then up-regulate the expression of an APRIL in the epithelium,
  thus stimulating the secretion of lgA by B cells. Besides, P40 and p75 can activate
  EGFR–PIK3–Akt signaling pathway to maintain gut homeostasis. Moreover, these two
  proteins also prevent tight junctional disruption by protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent
  mechanisms. Butyrate is able to bind to the GPCR including GPR41, GPR109A, and GPR43
  and induce the production of IL-18 in the colonic epithelium. Furthermore, butyrate
  also motivates the O2 consumption of the gut epithelium to maintain HIF stability
  and increase the expression of barrier-protective HIF target genes. In addition,
  bacteriocins produced by probiotics act as colonizing peptides to encourage producers
  to gain a competitive advantage over other strains and to occupy established niches
  in the intestines. Alternatively, bacteriocins can act as a killing peptide, directly
  inhibiting the adhesion of pathogens to the mucus layer and protecting the first
  barrier of the intestinal tract. HIF hypoxia-inducible factor, GPR109A G-protein-coupled
