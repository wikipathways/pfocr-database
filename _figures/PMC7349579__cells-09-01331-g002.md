caption: Interactions of LCSCs influencing HCC. (A) The Wnt protein directly interacts
  with cell surface receptor Frizzled and LRP5/6 co-receptors for activation of the
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Immediately after, Dishevelled protein is activated and released,
  leading to the generation of destructive enzymatic complex (APC/Axin/GSK-3β) and
  inhibition of GSK-3β. Following accumulation and stabilization, β-catenin translocates
  from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and subsequently binds TCF/LEF proteins to activate
  transcription of downstream target genes, including MMP3, MMP7, ADAM10, Twist, Slug,
  Tiam1, c-Myc, cyclin D1, and Fibronectin. (B) Ligand binding to NOTCH leads to cleavage
  and release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), promoting transcription factor
  complex (CBF1/RBPjk/Su(H)/Lag1 (CSL)) translocation from the cytoplasm to nucleus
  and activation of downstream target genes. (C) Desert hedgehog (DHH), Indian hedgehog
  (IHH), or Sonic hedgehog (SHH), the ligands binding PTCH1 or PTCH2, promote SMO
  localization to primary cilium on the cell membrane. Subsequently, glioma-associated
  oncogene homolog (GLI), a transcription factor, translocates to the nucleus and
  activates transcription of downstream genes. (D) Interactions with ligand stabilize
  TβRI and TβRII, following which TβRII phosphorylates the GS domain of TβRI, leading
  to further activation. Subsequent recruitment of intracellular SMAD proteins and
  translocation to the nucleus stimulate downstream gene transcription. (E) DNA methylation
  transferase (DNMT1) and histone deacetylases (HDAC) act as key epigenetic regulatory
  factors for downstream gene transcription. (F) Enhancement of surface markers of
  LCSC populations, including EpCAM, CD133, CD44, CD24, CD13, CD90, and CD47. (G)
  Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote
  LCSC surface marker populations (IL-6 and STAT3) within the microenvironment.
