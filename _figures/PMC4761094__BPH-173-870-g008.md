caption: A representation of the proposed mechanism of glycaemia‐enhanced vasoconstrictor
  signalling in vascular smooth muscle. Activation of PKCα and PKCβ with increasing
  glucose has a cumulative inhibitory effect on the Kv current so enhancing vasoconstriction
  by depolarizing stimuli (such as 60K), or enhancing contraction to ATII, which activates
  an alternate PKC isoenzyme. ET1‐induced vasoconstriction is only potentiated by
  glucose concentrations up to 10 mM, due to it acting via a PKCα‐dependent pathway.
  The mechanism by which glucose activates PKC is currently unclear with ROS generation,
  de novo DAG synthesis, or a presently unidentified endothelial‐derived modulator
  being potential candidates.
