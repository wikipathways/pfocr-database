caption: Hepcidin transcription depends upon signaling through BMP receptors (BMP-Rs)
  and downstream Smads. BMPs can act as autocrine or paracrine hormones. Binding of
  BMP to cell surface HJV positions BMP to activate BMP receptors. Activation of BMP
  receptors leads to the generation of phosphorylated RSmads, which dimerize with
  Smad4. The RSmad/Smad4 heterodimer translocates into the nucleus and activates transcription
  of the HAMP gene, which encodes hepcidin. Soluble HJV binding to BMP prevents the
  formation of a cell surface BMP-HJV complex and blocks activation of BMP receptors.
  Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 bind to IL-6 receptors (IL-6Rs), activating
  Stat3, which also binds to the HAMP promoter. Stat3 activation requires the presence
  of Smad4, as deletion of the Smad4 gene prevents IL-6 induction of hepcidin. Smad4
  is downstream of TFR2 and HFE, which suggests that the signal provided by these
  proteins also activates the HAMP promoter or that these membrane proteins affect
  BMP receptor signal transmission. In their study in this issue of the JCI, Babitt
  and colleagues demonstrate in vivo that soluble HJV binds BMPs produced by the liver,
  leading to alteration in iron homeostasis ().
