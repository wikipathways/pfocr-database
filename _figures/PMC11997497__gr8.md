caption: Graphic model of dedifferentiation-immunosuppression loop formed by malignant
  cell and macrophage in ICCMalignant cells and macrophages in ICC are involved in
  a dedifferentiation-immunosuppression loop. Briefly, macrophages play a crucial
  role in this process by secreting TGFB1, which induces dedifferentiation of malignant
  cells. This is achieved through the activation of Hippo signaling pathways and the
  upregulation of SERPINE1 and VEGFA expressions. Additionally, macrophages promote
  malignant cell proliferation by influencing the expression of HMGB2. In turn, malignant
  cells reciprocate the interaction by inducing an immunosuppressive TAM phenotype.
  This is accomplished by the expression of various immune checkpoints, such as LILRB1/2,
  which contribute to immune evasion and suppression within the TME
