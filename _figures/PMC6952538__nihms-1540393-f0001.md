caption: 'RORγt functions play a central intermediary role in linking the control
  of cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism to the regulation of immune responses
  and autoimmune disease. Many endogenous oxysterols generated by the cholesterol
  biosynthetic pathway and cholesterol metabolism act as effective RORγt agonists,
  leading to the recruitment of coactivators such as NCOA1 and CBP and the transcriptional
  activation of RORγt target genes, including IL17, IL21, IL23R, and AHR. The increase
  in proinflammatory cytokines promotes inflammation and autoimmune disease. Many
  synthetic RORγ ligands and some oxysterols, such as 24S-OHC and several hydroxylated
  metabolites of vitamin D3, function as inverse agonists. Inverse agonists prevent
  coactivator binding, promote the recruitment of corepressors such as NCOR1 and HDAC1/2,
  and repress the transcription and production of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby
  reducing inflammation and protecting against autoimmune disease. Changes in cholesterol
  biosynthesis and metabolism, for example, by treatment with statins or a high-cholesterol/fat
  diet, affect the generation of RORγt agonists and thereby RORγt activity and the
  development of inflammation and autoimmune disease. Posttranslational modifications
  can also affect RORγt activity by changing RORγt protein stability or its ability
  to recruit coactivators. Abbreviations: OHC, hydroxycholesterol; ROR, retinoic acid–related
  orphan receptor; RORE, ROR response element.'
