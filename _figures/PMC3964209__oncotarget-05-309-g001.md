caption: Antiapoptotic factors are colored in red and proapoptotic components are
  colored in blue. Constitutive activation of survival pathways by microenvironment
  signals and B cell receptor signaling leads to the transcriptional activation of
  prosurvival factors from the Bcl-2 and IAP families which are thus overexpressed
  in CLL cells. The increased antiapoptotic activity exerted by these factors results
  in (i) sequestration of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak (which thus prevents
  the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the subsequent cascade of caspase
  activation) and (ii) direct inhibition of caspase activities by IAP proteins. Moreover,
  deficiencies in the p53 apoptotic pathway (which are frequently observed in CLL)
  reduce the expression of BH3-only proteins like Puma and Noxa (known to block the
  antiapoptotic activity of prosurvival Bcl-2 family members and promote Bax and Bak
  activation). IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein; NF-kB, nuclear factor-kappaB;
  PI3K, phosphoinositol-3 kinase.
