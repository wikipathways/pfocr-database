caption: Functionally characterized miRNAs in relation to disease resistance. Most
  of the indicated miRNAs have been characterized in Arabidopsis plants infected with
  Pseudomonas syringae. Dicer-like proteins (DCLs) process double-stranded RNAs or
  single-stranded RNAs with hairpin structures, giving rise to mature sRNAs which
  are loaded into Argonaute (AGO)-containing RNA induced silencing complexes (RISCs)
  to induce gene silencing of their complementary targets. The RNA silencing-based
  antiviral defence involves the production of virus-derived sRNAs (vsiRNAs) by DCL
  activities that drive degradation of viral RNA in a sequence-specific manner. In
  addition to post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS)-based regulation, a role
  for RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in plant disease has emerged. Two miRNAs,
  miR162 and miR168, are involved in the regulation of the miRNA pathway itself by
  guiding cleavage of DCL1 and AGO1 mRNAs, respectively. In rice, the involvement
  of miR160, miR398 and miR7695 (in bold) in PTI responses is documented (Campo et
  al. ; Li et al. ). miR160 targets Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) whereas miR398 targets
  Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase genes. MiR7695 targets an alternatively spliced transcript
  of the Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 6 (Nramp6) gene from rice.

  description: Functionally characterized miRNAs in relation to disease resistance.
    Most of the indicated miRNAs have been characterized in Arabidopsis plants infected
