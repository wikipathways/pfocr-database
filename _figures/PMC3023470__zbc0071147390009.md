caption: Schematic illustration of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in CHO cells
  expressing SPHK1/2 and hSPNS2. S1P and FTY720-P are synthesized through the phosphorylation
  of Sph and FTY720 by SPHK1 and/or SPHK2, respectively. S1P and FTY720-P are exported
  through SPNS2. Intracellularly, FTY720 inhibits the conversion of DH-Sph into DH-Cer
  and S1P into hexadecenal.
