caption: A schema of the putative mechanisms by which myostatin may influence the
  function of bone cells. Myostatin influences osteoblastic differentiation through
  the osteocyte and its release of exosomal miR-218 in a mechanism that involves the
  activation of SOST and its inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway. Additionally,
  myostatin promotes RANKL production in osteocytes and, in turn, has the potential
  to increase osteoclast differentiation, activity, and viability. We note that myostatin
  has been recently reported to directly accelerate RANKL-mediated osteoclast formation
  by a mechanism through transcription factor Smad2-dependent regulation of NFATC1
  (nuclear factor of activated T-cells; Ref. ). Whether there is a direct effect of
  myostatin on osteoblasts remains to be determined.
