caption: A simplified overview of the NF-κB signalling pathway in which a ligand-activated
  receptor (e.g. TNFR, IL-1R, TLR4) assembles and activates a signalosome complex
  which activates the ‘IKK kinases’ TAK1 or NIK. The activated IKKs phosphorylate
  IκBα to promote its proteasomal degradation, thereby releasing NF-κB (represented
  as a p65:p50 heterodimer) to enter nucleus and drive gene expression. Feedback regulation
  operates at virtually all levels of the pathway, from receptors to NF-κB gene transcription
  itself, as represented by the following examples. sTLR4, a soluble extracellular
  decoy receptor, is expressed following lipopolysaccharide stimulation and inhibits
  LPS-induced signalling by sequestration of LPS and/or blockade of the interaction
  between TLR4 and its co-receptors. SIGIRR is a transmembrane decoy receptor that
  lacks critical residues that are essential for signalling by IL-1R and so disrupts
  IL-1R receptor signalling. IRAK-M lacks kinase activity and disrupts IRAK-4-mediated
  phosphorylation of IRAK-1 and downstream IKK/NF-κB activation. A20 is a deubiquitylase
  that is expressed following NF-κB activation and removes K63 ubiquitin chains from
  multiple components to disrupt signalosome function; it also promotes K48-linked
  unbiquitylation and degradation of RIPK1; both effects block IKK activation and
  so prevent NF-κB activation. In the non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation, stabilisation
  of NIK leads to phosphorylation and activation of IKKα to activate NF-κB; however,
  IKKα in turn phosphorylates the C-terminus of NIK to promote its proteasomal degradation
  as an inhibitory feedback mechanism to restore homeostasis. PP4R1, a regulatory
  subunit of the PP4c Ser–Thr phosphatase is expressed following activation of the
  T cell receptor and recruits PP4c to IKKα/β and catalyses their dephosphorylation
  and inactivation. NLRC5 expression is indirectly induced by LPS-dependent NF-κB
  activation via the NF-κB target gene, IFN-γ; NLRC5 binds to the IKKα/β kinase domains
  and blocks the binding of NEMO. NF-κB interacting long non-coding RNA (NKILA) is
  an LPS, IL-1β and TNFα-inducible NF-κB-regulated transcript that interacts with
  the NF-κB:IκBα complex in the cytoplasm and blocks IKK-dependent phosphorylation
  of IκBα. IκBα is itself an NF-κB target gene and de novo expressed IκBα can inhibit
  NF-κB activity by disrupting its interaction with DNA and by shifting the equilibrium
  of NF-κB subunit localisation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Finally, a variety
  of transcriptional repressors are recruited to DNA-bound NF-κB to inhibit gene transcription;
  an example is CITED2 which binds to the NF-κB coactivator p300, preventing p65 acetylation
  and inhibiting retention of p65 at target promoters. Further details on these exemplars
  of feedback regulation are provided in the text.
