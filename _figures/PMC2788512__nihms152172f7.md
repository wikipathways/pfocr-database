caption: The emerging genetic network of the Wnt1 signaling pathway reveals the interaction
  between the Wnt1 and SHH pathways at three major steps of mDA development; i) ventralization
  and inhibition of alternate fates, ii) promotion of neurogenesis, and iii) DA phenotype
  specification and survival. Arrow indicates positive regulation and -| indicates
  negative regulation. Black arrows indicate the regulation previously shown. Green
  and purple arrows indicate the regulations observed in this study. Overlapping function
  of Lmx1b is indicated by purple arrows. Dotted lines represent regulations that
  are not shown to be direct yet. Solid lines represent regulation that has been shown
  to be direct. Please refer to the Discussion section for details and related references.
