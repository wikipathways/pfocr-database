caption: 'Central carbon metabolism and catabolite control protein CcpA. The pathway
  shown was constructed for S. pyogenes MGAS5005 based on the BioCyc database. Metabolite
  names are written in black and gene names in red. Log2 fold changes of the 24-h
  (left), 48-h (center), and 96-h (right) groups with respect to the THY group are
  indicated in the color scale boxes. Color scale indicates enrichment (red) and depletion
  (blue) during infection. An asterisk indicates significant difference: *, P < 0.1.
  In operons or regulons, asterisks indicate that a significant difference was confirmed
  for all included genes. Log2 fold change values of operons or regulons shown are
  mean log2 fold changes in transcript levels of all genes. The phosphocarrier protein
  HPr (ptsH) is phosphorylated at Ser46 by the kinase HPrK (ptsK) through the cytoplasmic
  enzyme EI (ptsI), which allows HPr-Ser46-P to dimerize with the carbon catabolite
  protein CcpA and elicit carbon catabolite repression by binding to catabolite response
  elements in promoter sequences ().'
