caption: Mutations affecting ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2), a trimeric protein (encoded
  by RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C), and POLA1, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-α,
  an essential component of the DNA-replication machinery, are suggested to result
  in an alteration in cytosolic levels of RNA–DNA hybrids. Mutations in BLM, ATM and
  DCLRE1C, encoding the RecQ–like helicase BLM, the DNA repair protein ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM) and the DNA double-strand break repair protein Artemis, respectively,
  lead to the accumulation of products of DNA damage. SAMHD1 hydrolyses deoxynucleoside
  triphosphates (dNTPs) and may also play a role in DNA repair, while TREX1 degrades
  single-stranded and double-stranded DNA molecules. DNASE2, encoding the lysosomal
  endonuclease DNase II (DNASE2), promotes clearance of nucleic acids generated through
  apoptosis and the phagocytosis of maturating erythroblast nuclei. Mutations in LSM11
  and RNU7-1 result in a disturbance of histone stoichiometry, leading to sensing
  of nuclear DNA. ATAD3A mutations result in a leakage of mitochondrial DNA into the
  cytosol. All of the aforementioned mutant genotypes signal to interferon induction
  through cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)–STING signalling, which leads to
  the production of type I interferon (via activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)–interferon
  regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and possibly NF-κB (not shown)). Gain-of-function mutations
  in STING lead to constitutive translocation of the protein from the endoplasmic
  reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, and dominant negative mutations in coatomer subunit-α
  (COPA), involved in retrograde Golgi apparatus to endoplasmic reticulum vesicular
  transport, also result in abnormal STING trafficking. MDA5 (encoded by IFIH1) and
  RIG-I (encoded by DDX58) normally sense exogenous viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA);
  Aicardi–Goutières syndrome-related gain-of-function mutations in MDA5 lower its
  activation threshold to enable sensing of endogenous dsRNA species. dsRNA-specific
  adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1) deaminates adenosine to inosine, and loss-of-function
  mutations are proposed to result in the generation of abnormally immunogenic dsRNA
  species derived from Alu inverted repeats. Mutations in any of these proteins activate
  interferon signalling via an RNA-sensing pathway involving MAVS. The same is true
  of mutations in the mitochondrial ribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPT1)
  and in the RNA helicase SKIV2L, which plays a role in limiting the activation of
  the cytosolic dsRNA receptor machinery in response to IRE1-mediated RNA degradation.
  The predominant signalling pathway induced by mutations in N-glycanase (NGLY1),
  a conserved deglycosylation enzyme, remains unclear. The signalling pathways involved
  in inducing an interferon signature due to mutations in C1q, the first protein of
  the classical complement pathway, encoded by C1QA, C1QB and C1QC, and ACP5, which
  encodes the lysosomal phosphatase tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and
  in the multiple genes encoding distinct proteasomal components, are also currently
  undefined. After induction, interferon (IFN) binds to heterodimeric interferon-α/β
  receptor 1 (IFNAR1), leading to phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2 and subsequent
  activation of the transcription factor complex ISGF3. ISGF3 binds to interferon-stimulated
  response elements in gene promoters and induces the expression of interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISGs). USP18 is a negative regulator of signalling downstream of IFNAR1.
  Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 stabilizes the level of intracellular USP18. Mutations
  in ISG15 cause a reduction of the level of USP18, resulting in enhanced interferon
  production. While STAT2 plays a role in positive interferon signal induction, homozygous
  separation-of-function mutations at p.Arg148 lead to disruption of a role in limiting
  IFNAR2 signalling. Gain-of-function mutations in JAK1 and STAT2 lead to enhanced
  type I interferon and other cytokine signalling pathways. We are uncertain of the
  interferon status of disease related to mutations in adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2),
  sterile α-motif domain-containing protein 9-like (SAMD9L), suppressor of cytokine
  signalling 1 (SOCS1), barrier-to-autointegration factor 1 (BAF), ENPP1 ectonucleotide
  pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (ENPP1), ribonuclease T2 (RNASET2) and oligoadenylate
  synthetase 1 (OAS1), encoded by CECR1, SAMD9L, SOCS1, BAF1, ENPP1, RNASET2 and OAS1
  respectively, either because of a current lack of or because of the presence of
  conflicting clinical, in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo evidence. PPP, triphosphate.
