caption: The regulation network of phytohormones on root hair initiation and elongation
  in Arabidopsis. GL2 inhibits the expression of ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 (RHD6) and
  RHD6 LIKE1 (RSL1), which are positive regulators of root hair initiation and elongation.
  RHD6 and RSL1 promote the expression of RSL2 and RSL4, which in turn promote root
  hair elongation by upregulating the expression of elongation genes. JAZ protein,
  a repressor of JA signal transduction, inhibits RHD6 transcription and interferes
  with the interaction between RHD6 and RSL1. JAZ protein also inhibits the transcription
  of EIN3 and EIL1 in the ethylene signaling pathway. EIN3/EIL1 can form a complex
  with RHD6/RSL1 to promote root hair initiation, and EIN3 binds to the promoter region
  of RSL4 to promote its transcription. The auxin response factor ARF5 also binds
  to the RSL4 promoter region to induce RSL4 expression, and the auxin response factor
  ARF7 and ARF19 bind to the promoter region of ERU to induce ERU expression. GA negatively
  regulates the expression of root hair elongation genes through DELLA-mediated signal
  transduction. ABA induces the accumulation of OBP4 protein, and OBP4 binds to the
  RSL2 promoter region to inhibit RSL2 expression. ABA also induces the expression
  of AtOXI1 and other root hair initiation-related genes by H2O2 production. CK can
  promote root hair elongation by promoting RSL4 expression. SL induces root hair
  elongation-related gene expression through the MAX2-mediated signal transduction
  pathway. BR negatively regulates the expression of root hair elongation-related
  genes. →, positive regulation; ┤, negative regulation. JA, jasmonate; ETH, ethylene;
  CK, cytokinin; GA, gibberellin; BR, brassinosteroid; SL, strigolactone; and ABA,
  abscisic acid.
