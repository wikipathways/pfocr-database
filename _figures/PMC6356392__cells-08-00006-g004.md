caption: Proposed scheme of the antitumor effects of DIFs. After the addition of one
  of the DIFs to tumor cells, the DIF rapidly (within several minutes) disturbs mitochondrial
  function [,], increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [] and intracellular
  calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) [,,,] and inhibits the activities of p21-activated
  kinase 1 (PAK1) [] and calmodulin-dependent cAMP/cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE1) (resulting
  in an increase in cAMP levels) []. Over time (from several minutes to hours) the
  DIF also affects the activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk),
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway, which suppresses the expression of cyclins D/E (and promotes the degradation
  of cyclin D1) and the subsequent reduction of phospho-pRB [,,,,,,,]. At appropriate
  concentrations the DIFs have been found to induce growth arrest in all the tumor
  cell lines tested to date in vitro and in vivo and at higher concentrations they
  have induced caspase-independent cell death [,,]. Also, the DIFs induce differentiation
  of murine and human leukemia (B8 and K562) cells in vitro [,] and promote retinoic
  acid-induced differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 cells in vitro []. In addition,
  the DIFs suppress the migration of some cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [,]. Chemical
  structure–activity relationship analyses have revealed that DIF-3(+1) and Bu-DIF-3
  are promising lead compounds for the development of anti-cancer drugs [,,].
