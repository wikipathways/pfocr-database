caption: 'Posttranscriptional mechanisms of regulation of the miRNA biogenesis pathway.
  MiRNA biosynthesis requires two steps of processing: (1) processing from primary
  miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNA) to precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) by the ribonuclease
  III (RNase III) Drosha in the nucleus and (2) processing from pre-miRNA to a mature
  miRNA duplex by the RNase III Dicer in the cytoplasm. Both steps can be regulated
  by various RNA-binding proteins and DNA-binding proteins as summarized in panels
  a–d. (a) Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) ( green) recognizes
  the terminal loop of pri-miRNAs (red ) and promotes the structural remodeling of
  the stem region of pri-miRNAs, which generates a favorable Drosha (light blue)-binding
  site and enhances processing. The nuclear factor 90/nuclear factor 40 (NF90/NF40)
  complex ( purple) associates with the stem region of pri-miRNAs, which precludes
  association with the Drosha-processing complex and inhibits processing. (b) Similar
  to hnRNP A1 in panel a, KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) ( gray) binds
  to the terminal loop of pri-miRNAs and promotes both Drosha (light blue) and Dicer
  ( yellow) processing. (c) Binding of Lin28 (orange) to the terminal loop of pri-miRNAs
  prevents the association of both Drosha (light blue) and Dicer ( yellow). Additionally,
  Lin28 acts as a scaffold to promote the association of terminal RNA uridyltransferase
  4 (TUT4; also known as Zcchc11) (light green) with the pre-miRNA. TUT4 promotes
  the 3′-uridinylation of pre-miRNA, which is then rapidly degraded. (d ) The RNA
  helicases p68 and p72 (teal ) play a critical role in the posttranscriptional regulation
  of numerous miRNAs in response to cellular signals, including transforming growth
  factor β(TGF-β) stimulation, p53-mediated DNA damage response, and estrogen stimulation.
  The downstream mediators of TGF-βstimulation and DNA damage, Smads and p53 ( pink),
  promote miRNA processing. Conversely, when bound to E2 ( pink), ERαreduces the processing
  of a subset of miRNAs. Adapted from Reference .'
