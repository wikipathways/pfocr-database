caption: Genetic map and transcriptional regulation of the TOL pathway. A, the enzymes
  encoded in the upper operon sequentially transform toluene or xylenes into benzoate
  or methylbenzoates, respectively. These are then transformed into acetate and pyruvate
  by the enzymes encoded in the meta operon. B, transcriptional regulation of the
  upper and meta operons. Structural genes (in gray), the regulatory genes xylS and
  xylR (in white), and the Pu, Pm, PS1, PS2, PR1, and PR2 promoters, are indicated.
  The activating (+) or repressing (−) effects of XylR and XylS are specified. Activation
  of Pu and PS1 by the XylR regulator requires the presence of an effector such as
  toluene, xylenes, or 3-methylbenzyl alcohol. To activate Pm, XylS must either bind
  to an aromatic effector (benzoate or methylbenzoates) or be expressed at high levels.
