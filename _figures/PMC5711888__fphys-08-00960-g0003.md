caption: 'A diagram of our reduced network model: The ANG/TIE signaling pathway is
  shown in gray, Shear Stress in white, Oxygen and Energy in blue, VEGF in yellow,
  AKT/SRC in light blue, TGF in pink, NOTCH in orange, WNT in purple, RAS/PLCγ in
  violet, and FGF in green. Ligands are represented as hexagons, other micro-environment
  variables as octagons, receptors as right arrows, transcription factors as ellipses,
  and signal transducers as rounded rectangles. Intracellular signaling is represented
  in black arrows, extracellular signaling is represented with blue arrows. Activatory
  interactions are shown as regular arrows and inhibitory interactions are shown as
  blunt arrows. The self activatory feedback circuits required to keep the micro-environment
  constant during the simulation are shown in red.'
