caption: Diagram showing activation of Notch signalling. Notch receptor precursor
  is processed in the Golgi apparatus before being translocated to the cell membrane.
  After binding to ligand present on adjacent cells, Notch undergoes two proteolytic
  cleavages which produce the active form of Notch (NIC). NIC moves into the nucleus
  where by interacting with transcriptional factor CBF1 induces the transcription
  of Notch target genes.
