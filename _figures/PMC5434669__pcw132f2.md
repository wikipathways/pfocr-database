caption: '(a) A schematic diagram summarizing the current understanding of the DREB2
  (left) and the AREB pathway (right). NaCl stress and ABA increase the amount of
  transcriptionally active DREB2 and AREB via two routes: (i) an enzymatic cascade
  leading to post-translational modification of the TF proteins (phosphorylation cascade
  involving PP2C/SnRK2 for AREB, unknown mechanism for DREB2), and (ii) induction
  of TF gene expression. DREB2 and AREB proteins are subject to ubiquitin-mediated
  proteolysis mediated by DRIP and KEG, respectively. Currently there is no evidence
  that DRIP and KEG activities are affected by NaCl and/or ABA. For details see main
  text. (b) The proposed mathematical model of the DREB2 (TF1) and AREB (TF2) pathways.
  The same arrowheads defined in (a) are used to describe different types of biological
  processes. Asterisks (*) denote the post-translationally modified form of the TF
  protein. Dashed arrows indicate the kinetic processes associated with time delay.
  Arrows originating from null sets (ø) denote de novo production of proteins, while
  arrows pointing towards null sets represent degradation of proteins. Model parameters
  for kinetic rates of the signaling processes are shown next to the corresponding
  arrows.'
