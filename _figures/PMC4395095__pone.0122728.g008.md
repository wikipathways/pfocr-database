caption: A consensus biochemical pathway for DHN melanin synthesis based on what is
  known from other fungal systems is shown [, , ]. Processing steps of the well-known
  DHN pathway are presented with dark arrows. PKS, polyketide synthase; 4HNR, tetrahydroxynaphthalene
  reductase; SD, scytalone dehydratase; 3HNR, trihydroxynaphthalene reductase; VD,
  vermelone dehydratase; 1,3,6,8-THN, tetrahydroxynaphthalene; 1,3,8-THN, trihydroxynapthalene;
  1,8-DHN, dihydroxynaphthalene. Tc, tricyclazole, can inhibit both reductases (4HNR
  and 3HNR) presented in a model pathway. Distinctive steps described in A. nidulans
  (An), A. fumigatus (Af), T. marneffei (Tm) are shown with dashed arrows. Asterisks,
  * and **, refer to data from previous study [] and this study, respectively.
