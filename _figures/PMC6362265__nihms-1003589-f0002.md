caption: In unstressed conditions, stress sensor proteins activating transcription
  factor (ATF) 6, inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1) α, and RNA-dependent protein kinase-like
  ER-resident kinase (PERK), representing the three branches of the UPR, are associated
  with the folding chaperone glucose regulated protein/binding immunoglobulin protein
  (GRP78/BiP) in the ER. Accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins within the ER
  lumen causes GRP78/BiP disassociation from these three sensor proteins, leading
  to UPR activation. Each pathway uses a different mechanism of signal transduction.
  Activated IRE1α mediates unconventional splicing of X-box binding protein (XBP)
  1 to produce spliced, active isoform of XBP1. IRE1α recruits TNF receptor associated
  factor (TRAF) 2 to activate the downstream signal mediators, NF-κB/JNK. IRE1α-mediated
  activations of XBP1 and TRAF2/NF-κB/JNK regulate UPR target genes associated with
  lipid metabolism, immune, inflammatory response, and differentiation, as well as
  structural/ functional expansion of ER and ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD).
  In addition, IRE1α can reduce the ER protein folding load by the IRE1-dependent
  decay of mRNA (RIDD) causing degradation of ER membrane-bound mRNAs. Activated PERK
  recruits and phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF2) α reduce global
  protein synthesis and thereby reduce protein folding load in ER-stressed cells.
  Paradoxically, however, PERK/eIF2α-translation of ATF4 increases certain UPR gene
  transcriptions, including CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP).
  Lastly, activated ATF6 is exported to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved by
  the Golgi-resident proteases SP1 and SP2 to produce the functional fragment of ATF6.
  The functional ATF6 is then translocated to the nucleus where it transactivates
  UPR genes associated with ER homeostasis.
