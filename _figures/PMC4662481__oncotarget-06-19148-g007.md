caption: The phosphorylation of AKT is a key step for regulating cell proliferation
  and apoptosis. The extracellular cytokines and survival factors activate AKT signaling,
  which promotes the phosphorylation of Survivin and finally results in apoptosis
  inhibition and cell proliferation. However, PHLPP, that is under the regulation
  of miR-495, may dephosphorylate AKT and inactivate AKT signaling pathway, and also
  possibly dephosphorylate Survivin and promotes Survivin transportation into nuclei,
  then inactivates the function of Survivin, finally results in an increase of cell
  apoptosis and decrease of cell proliferation.
