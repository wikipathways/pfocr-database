caption: Taste receptors modulate oral immune response to microorganisms. (A) In gingiva
  epithelial cells (GECs) treated with S. mutans competence stimulating peptide-1
  (CSP-1), a vigorous increase in intracellular calcium mobilization and secretion
  of cytokines/chemokines including IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α occurred primarily through
  the T2R14-Gβγ-PLCβ pathway, recruiting immune cells and mediating the immune response
  to pathogens. (B) LPS can induce a significant dose- and time-dependent increase
  in adenylate cyclase (AC) activity and thereafter elevates intracellular cAMP levels,
  positively affecting NF-κB activity through its major effector protein kinase A
  (PKA) and stimulating inflammatory responses. In addition, the cAMP/PKA/cAMP response
  element binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway may promote the LPS-induced release
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-33, and TNF-α. In human gingival
  fibroblasts (HGFs), agonist-stimulated T2R16 mobilizes downstream α-gustducin to
  activate the phosphodiesterase (PDE) that hydrolyzes cAMP, thereby reducing intracellular
  cAMP levels and alleviating the LPS-induced inflammation as well as tissue injury.
  (C) Taste receptors of gingival solitary chemosensory cells (gSCCs) activated by
  bacterial metabolites would stimulate epithelial cells to release antimicrobial
  peptides (AMPs) as a direct bactericidal effect and also recruit immune cells to
  modulate the oral immune response.
