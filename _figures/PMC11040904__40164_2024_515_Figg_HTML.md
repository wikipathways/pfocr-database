caption: Posttranslational modification of PD-1. As a transmembrane protein, PD-1
  undergoes intricate posttranslational modifications. The primary site of focus for
  PD-1 is within the Golgi apparatus. Fut8 plays a pivotal role in promoting the core
  structure of the PD-1 protein, thereby contributing to the stabilization of PD-1.
  Upon binding to PD-L1, the intracellular domain of PD-1 undergoes phosphorylation,
  recruiting SHP2-2 and subsequently initiating immunosuppressive signaling. Lck enhances
  the phosphorylation of PD-1, intensifying its downstream effects. IL-2 promotes
  the transcription of FBXO38, which, in turn, binds to the cytoplasmic region of
  PD-1, facilitating polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation.
  MARCH5, c-Cbl, and FBW7 are also implicated in promoting PD-1 ubiquitination. MDM2
  facilitates the interaction between NGLY1 and PD-1, leading to the deglycosylation
  of PD-1. Furthermore, DHHC9 promoted the palmitoylation of PD-1 to enhance its interaction
  with Rab11. Inhibition of palmitoylation diminishes the transport of PD-1 to the
  recycling endosome, promoting its degradation in the lysosome. This process is also
  associated with a notable enhancement in the interaction between PD-1 and mTOR signal
  effector proteins (S6K and eIF4E). The black arrows indicate positive regulatory
  pathways, while the red arrows indicate negative regulatory pathways
