caption: Stages of cancer cell colonisation of the bone. (A) Tumour cells are attracted
  to the high levels of chemoattractants in the bone marrow (red), such as Ca2+, CXCL12
  (C–X–C motif chemokine ligand 12) and RANKL. In the endosteal niche, hematopoietic
  stem cells (HSC) and disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) competitively bind to osteoblasts
  through interactions between CXCR4/CXCL12 and Annexin II/Annexin II receptor. In
  addition, expression of E-cadherin on the DTC surface can form adherin junctions
  with N-cadherin expressing osteoblasts as well as form interactions between RANK
  and RANKL, the latter of which is secreted by osteoblasts and osteocytes. Furthermore,
  DTCs also express integrins which can interact with a number of factors in the bone
  marrow (VCAM-1, bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteopontin (OPN), victronectin); (B) Once
  in the bone marrow, DTCs compete with HSCs for the endosteal niche. DTCs are able
  to proliferate; although a majority of cells die or remain dormant. The local environment
  has a significant impact on the fate of these DTCs. Local levels of type I collagen
  and fibronectin have been demonstrated to repress dormancy. Dormant cells have been
  reported to be found in the vascular niche, in close proximity to capillaries and
  within regions rich in CXCL12 and E-selection. The vascular niche is able to secrete
  thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) and Notch-1, which are important for maintaining dormancy.
  Several studies also show TGFβ2, can play an important role in the maintenance of
  dormancy through MAPK signalling, while TGFβ1 secreted from neovascular tips is
  associated with tumour cell reactivation. Periostin can also be secreted by neovascular
  tips as well as Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs), leading to DTC reactivation. The endosteal
  (osteoblastic) niche can also maintain tumour cell dormancy through the secretion
  of GAS6 by osteoblasts and OPN and angiopoietin-1 by spindle-shaped N-cadherin+
  osteoblasts (SNOs). To exit dormancy, osteoclasts are able to release stem cell
  signals, triggering the NFκB pathway. We also know that the release of Ca2+ from
  normal bone remodelling can bind to calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) to stimulate
  PTHrP, leading to tumour cell reactivation; (C) After DTCs are reactivated, they
  become proliferative and establish macrometastases. Bone matrix derived TGFβ, IGF,
  PDGF and BMP can promote tumour cell proliferation, as well as Cancer Associated
  Fibroblasts (CAFs) secreted CXCL12. Once macrometastases are established, the tumour
  can release factors that drive osteoclasts (M-CSF, TNFα, IL-11 and IL-8) to induce
  osteolytic lesions through the stimulation of RANKL. Tumour cells have also been
  shown to release miRNAs that stimulate osteogenesis through the down-regulation
  of DKK-1 and SOST-1. Finally, association of tumour cells with the endosteal niche
  has been associated with tumour cell growth.
