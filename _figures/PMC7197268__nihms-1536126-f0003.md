caption: AC5 presumably located on transverse tubules adjacent to the nuclear envelope
  can locally produce cAMP, followed by PKA phosphorylation that inhibits AC5 and
  activates PDE4D3 activity, resulting in decreased cAMP accumulation [, ]. Activation
  of ERK5 by MEK5 will lead to PDE4D3 inhibition and increased PKA activity []. When
  high cAMP levels activate the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac1, Rap1 will
  inhibit the ERK5 pathway, reversing the ERK5-mediated inhibition of PDE4D3 and limiting
  downstream signaling. In addition, there is an incoherent feedforward loop that
  will oppose PKA phosphorylation of PDE4D3 resulting from PKA phosphorylation and
  activation of PP2A in the complex [].
