caption: 'Figure 1. (A) Schematic of various signaling inputs and regulatory pathways
  that govern PKA activity in S. cerevisiae. The cAMP-independent activation of PKA
  by ammonium (NH4+), amino acids and phosphate (Pi) make up the ‘fermentable-growth
  medium (FGM)’ pathway. (B) Left: Signaling inputs that activate PKA in the human
  fungal pathogen, C. albicans (top). Following activation, PKA induces the yeast-to-hypha
  transition that promotes invasion of the gut epithelium (bottom). MDPs, muramyl
  dipeptides. Right: Novel signaling inputs and regulatory mechanisms in the plant
  pathogenic species F. solani (blue pathway) and M. oryzae (red pathway) (top). In
  M. oryzae, the activation of PKA leads to the formation of the appressorium (AP),
  which promotes penetration through the outer plant cuticle into the underlying tissue
  (bottom).'
