caption: Arrows indicate sites of inhibition. Sigirr inhibits the initiation of this
  pathway by preventing TLR4's interaction with MyD88. IRAK-M and TOLLIP both prevent
  the dissociation of IRAKs from MyD88. TRIAD3A has several mechanisms of inhibition
  by interacting within the Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domains of TIRAP, TRIF, and
  RIP1. Overexpression of TRIAD3 also degrades TLR4. A20 is a de-ubiquitinating enzyme
  which removes ubiquitin moieties from TRAF6 to prevent downstream signaling. miR-21
  is a microRNA targeting the protein PDCD4 and preventing activation of NF-κB. VACV
  A52R is a viral protein that prevents the formation of IRAK TRAF6 complexes. TANK
  prevents the ubiquitination of TRAF6 suppressing further downstream signaling. ST2825
  a synthetic compound, prevents MyD88's association with IRAKs. DUBA cleaves polyubiquitin
  chains from TRAF3 to suppress type I interferons.
