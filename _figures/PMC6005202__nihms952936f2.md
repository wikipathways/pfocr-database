caption: A simplified view of global primary metabolism is highlighted in yellow,
  with various branches that may be engineered to produce specific molecules of interest
  highlighted in the outer brown area. Co-products may be harvested alongside plant
  cell wall biomass, which is broken down as a monosaccharide feedstock for downstream
  microbial fermentative processes. Platform chemicals encompass many diverse molecules
  that span across all of primary metabolism; however, here we have only highlighted
  the example of muconic acid that may be engineered from various intermediates of
  the shikimate pathway. Many secondary metabolites derived from phenylpropanoids
  or amino acids are involved in plant disease resistance as biopesticides and may
  confer relevant agricultural traits.
