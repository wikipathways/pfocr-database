caption: Roles of PAK1 and PAK2 in vascular remodeling. PAK1 exerts its influence
  on cell proliferation by activating Rac1 through the MAPK signaling pathway, while
  PAK2 mitigates ROS-induced activation and endothelial apoptosis by inhibiting BAD
  and Caspase-3. Collectively, PAK1 and PAK2 target VSMCs, impacting their migration
  and thereby playing a significant role in vascular remodeling
