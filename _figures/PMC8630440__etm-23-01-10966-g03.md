caption: KEGG pathway and protein domain enrichment of differentially expressed proteins.
  (A) The illustration from the KEGG database showing that the enriched proteins derived
  from umbilical cord serum were involved in ECM-receptor interactions. (B) KEGG pathway
  enrichment analysis showing that ‘focal adhesion’ and ‘ECM-receptor interaction’
  were the most enriched pathways. (C) Protein domain enrichment analysis of high-abundance
  proteins mainly involved the ‘galactose-binding domain-like’ domain. (D) Protein
  domain enrichment analysis of low-abundance proteins mainly involved the ‘serine
  proteases, trypsin domain’ and ‘peptidase S1, PA clan’ domains. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes; ECM, extracellular matrix.
