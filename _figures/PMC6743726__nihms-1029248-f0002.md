caption: In the liver, the transsulfuration pathway connects transmethylation cycle
  (methionine cycle) to glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis. Methionine forms S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM), the major biological methyl donor, by the action of methionine adenosyltransferase
  (MAT). SAM is then converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by the actions of various
  methyltransferases (MTs). These MTs transfer the methyl group to accepting molecules
  (e.g., DNA, RNA and proteins) undergoing methylation. Homocysteine is derived from
  the hydrolysis of SAH by the action of SAH hydrolase (SAHH). In the methionine cycle,
  methionine can be regenerated from homocysteine by one of two remethylation pathways.
  In one pathway (1), methionine synthase (MS) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl
  group from N5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) to homocysteine creating methionine
  and tetrahydrofolate (THF); this reaction requires vitamin B12 (B12) as a cofactor.
  In the other pathway (2), betaine is the source of the methyl group transferred
  to homocysteine, which is catalyzed by a zinc (Zn)-dependent enzyme, betaine homocysteine
  methyltransferase (BHMT). The transsulfuration pathway starts with homocysteine
  being irreversibly converted to cystathionine by the enzyme cystathionine-β-synthase
  (CBS). Cystathionine is further converted to cysteine by cystathionine-γ-lyase (CL).
  Cysteine can then feed GSH biosynthesis
