caption: 'Fibrosis related intracellular Ca2+signaling pathways. (A). Schematic mechanism
  of key pro-fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) gene transcription regulation involving
  different signaling pathways. Including calcineurin/NFATc, PKCα, p38-MAPK, and p42/44-MAPK
  in lamina cribrosa (LC) cells. TGF-β, oxidative stress, and/or cell membrane stretch
  stimuli provoke [Ca2+]i movements from Ca2+ entry (through TRPC and L-type Ca2+
  channels) and extrusion of Ca2+ from Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), Ryanodine Receptor
  (RYR), and inositol triphosphate Receptor (IP3R). [Ca2+]i rise activates calmodulin,
  which in turn activates calcineurin. Activated calcineurin induces dephosphorylation
  of transcription factors of activated transcription factors of activated T-cells
  (NFATc), which next translocate to the nucleus to activate Ca2+ related genes including
  those involved in fibrosis in glaucoma. [Ca2+]i rise also induce a sequential phosphorylation
  of PKCα, and downstream series of phosphorylations of p38-MAPK, and p42/44-MAPK
  resulting in expression of Ca2+-dependent genes such as profibrotic ECM genes and
  ultimately proliferation of glaucoma LC cells. (B) Schematic illustration of the
  three modules (ERKs, JNKs, p38-MAPK). Stimuli, such as cell surface receptors including
  receptor tyrosin kinase (RTK), growth factor receptors, and G-protein coupled receptors
  (GPCR), activate up-stream protein kinases, which in turn activate downstream MAPKs.
  MAPKs signalling pathways are structured in modular cascades in which activation
  of upstream kinases lead to sequential activation of a MAPK module (MAPKKK, MAPKK,
  MAPK). MAPKKK phosphorylates (indicated by P) and activates MAPKK, which in turn
  phosphorylates and activates MAPK. Shown are the major MAPK pathway components,
  the JNK, and the p38-MAPK modules, and the various cellular responses including
  fibrosis elicited by MAPK control. MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK:
  Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinas; MAPKKK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase kinase.'
