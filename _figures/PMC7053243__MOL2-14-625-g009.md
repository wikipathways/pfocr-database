caption: Schematic diagram showing the proposed mechanism of MYC inhibition by excess
  BASP1 protein competing for binding to CaM. Binding of CaM to BASP1 or MYC is Ca2+‐dependent
  (Maekawa et al., ; Matsubara et al., ; Raffeiner et al., ). In addition to degradation
  by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, MYC is also specifically cleaved by calpains,
  Ca2+‐dependent proteases (Conacci‐Sorrell et al., ; Farrell and Sears, ; Gregory
  and Hann, ). Interference of BASP1 with the MYC : CaM interaction leads to enhanced
  MYC degradation and less nuclear entry. Mitogenic signaling, amplification, translocation,
  or retroviral transduction leads to MYC hyperactivation and subsequent deregulation
  of numerous transcriptional targets including strong repression of the tumor suppressor
  BASP1 gene (Hartl et al., ).
