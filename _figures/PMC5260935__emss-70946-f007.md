caption: TLR4 stimulation induces the nuclear activity of the RelA:p50 dimer, which
  is subjected to rapid negative feedback by IκBα. Costimulation through LTβR generates
  a late RelA:p52–containing NF-κB activity in fibroblasts. In costimulated macrophages,
  however, the RelA:p52 dimer triggersed the hyperactive Nfkbia promoter, which leads
  to the production of IκBα additionally at late time points. This late-phase IκBα
  synthesis attenuatesd the late-acting RelA:p50 and RelA:p52 activities in costimulated
  macrophages and abrogatesd crosstalk between the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB
  pathways. Early and late signaling events have been indicated with solid and dashed
  lines, respectively.
