caption: Overview of the growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP)-peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-gamma (PPARγ) pathway in lipid and energy metabolism. The interaction of
  hexarelin with the scavenger receptor CD36 promotes the transcriptional activation
  of nuclear receptor PPARγ and target gene profiling involved in metabolism. In macrophages,
  hexarelin and other GHRPs induce a molecular cascade involving nuclear liver X receptor
  LXRα and expression of apolipoprotein E (apoE) and sterol transporters ABCA1 and
  ABCG1. Such activation of the PPARγ-LXRα-ABC metabolic pathway increases cholesterol
  efflux, resulting in enhanced HDL reverse cholesterol transport and regression of
  atherosclerosis. In hepatocytes, CD36 activation by hexarelin reduces de novo cholesterol
  synthesis. Activation of the LKB-AMPK pathway resulted in the inhibition of the
  rate-limiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) enzyme. Also,
  induction of Insig1/2 expression through PPARγ/PGC-1α activation led to HMGR degradation
  and SREBP-2 retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby blunting the homeostatic
  response to sterol depletion. In adipocytes, CD36 activation with hexarelin promotes
  mitochondrial activity and biogenesis through enhanced PPARγ and co-activator PGC-1α
  transcriptional activity. Induction of key genes involved in fatty acid utilization
  and energy production in mitochondria results in an increased fatty acid β-oxidation
  and thermogenic-like profile indicative of a browning effect of white fat (adapted
  from Refs [,]).

    The interaction of hexarelin with the scavenger receptor CD36 promotes the transcriptional

    In macrophages, hexarelin and other GHRPs induce a molecular cascade involving

    resulted in the inhibition of the rate-limiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme
    A reductase (HMGR) enzyme. Also, induction of Insig1/2 expression through PPARγ/PGC-1α
