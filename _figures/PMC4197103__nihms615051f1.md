caption: The activation of death receptors (TNFR1, Fas, and TRAIL), TLR3, TLR4, or
  the TCR can result in apoptosis or necroptosis. TNFR1 ligation to TNF leads to the
  assembly of complex I that can activate the canonical NF-kB pathway or the non-canonical
  NF-kB pathway (under cIAP depleting conditions). If CYLD deubquitinates RIPK1, then
  complex IIa forms and is known as a TRADD-dependent complex. Complex IIb, a TRADD-independent
  complex, is known as the ripoptosome. Caspase 8 cleavage of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in complexes
  IIa and IIb results in apoptosis. Inactive caspase 8 turns complex IIb into a RIPK1/RIPK3
  necrosome. After MLKL is phosphorylated by RIPK3, necroptosis ensues. TLR3 and TLR4
  activation results in the recruitment of TRIF, which recruits RIPK3 and leads to
  ripoptosome or necrosome formation. Currently, the necroptotic signaling mechanism
  that stems from TCR stimulation remains unknown.
