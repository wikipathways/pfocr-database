caption: Schematic of the podocyte and the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB). The
  GFB is composed of the podocytes, the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and the
  fenestrated endothelial cells. The podocyte has a unique actin cytoskeleton made
  up of F-actin and nonmuscle myosin such as nonmuscle myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9)
  and myosin 1E (MYO1E). Its other structural components include actin-binding proteins
  such as synaptopodin and α-actinin 4 (ACTN4) and actin polymerization regulatory
  protein inverted formin 2 (INF2). Wilms tumor 1 gene is a nuclear transcription
  factor important in podocyte gene development. The cell–cell junction of the podocyte
  (the slit diaphragm) is formed by nephrin, podocin, CD2-associated protein, and
  NEPH1. Podocin is associated with lipid rafts, a signaling domain of the slit diaphragm.
  It recruits nephrin and NEPH1 to form a signaling complex with other molecules such
  as transient receptor potential cation channel 6 (TRPC6), growth factor receptor–bound
  protein 2, and phospholipase C epsilon-1 (PLCE1) at the slit diaphragm. The apical
  membrane of the podocyte is formed by negatively charged molecules such as podocalyxin,
  podoplanin, podoendin, and glomerular epithelial protein-1. RhoA-activated Rac1
  GTPase-activating protein (ARHGAP24) and its regulator RhoGDIα (ARHGDIA) are critical
  for maintaining podocyte cell shape and membrane dynamics. COQ6 and other regulators
  of the coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis pathway are important in podocyte energy regulation.
  The basal part of the podocyte contains α3β1 integrin and α- and β-dystroglycans
  that anchor the podocyte to the GBM. Talin, paxillin, and vinculin (TPV) interact
  with different laminins in the GBM, especially laminin β2. Mutations in many of
  the aforementioned proteins have been associated with nephrotic syndrome.
