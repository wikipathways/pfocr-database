caption: Gene interaction network analysis associated with the acyl lipid metabolism
  related candidates underlying the CI of unique QTL. The visualized interaction network
  of 54 candidates was constructed by String software and exhibited by Cytoscape V-3.5.0
  software. The five different regions represent different metabolic pathway of acyl
  lipid metabolism. Nodes represent the potential candidates and edges represent the
  interaction of them. Node size represents “Degree” and edge size represents “Combined-score,”
  and the color for nodes and edges represents the “Betweenness certrality” and “Edge
  Betweenness”, respectively. All the value for these four parameters was calculated
  by Network Analyzer that included in Cytoscape V-3.5.0 software.
