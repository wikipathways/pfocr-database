caption: 'Note: (A.) The potential liver injury components urate-lowering Chinese
  medicine are indicated by blue triangles, the core targets are indicated by red
  arrows; the direct targets of components and “liver injury” are represented by yellow
  circles, and the interaction targets of components and “liver injury” are gray.
  (B.) The pathways are represented by green diamond. The targets are indicated by
  red arrow; the direct target of the compound and disease are represented by yellow
  circle, and the interacting proteins are represented by gray circle. To get an initial
  sense of the biological processes and pathways enriched by putative targets that
  were relative with liver injury, the functional enrichment analysis was conducted
  based on DAVID. And the results were classified into several signaling pathways,
  including pathways in cancer, Epstein-Barr virus infection, Viral carcinogenesis,
  p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, the immune system,
  signal transduction, gene expression, cell cycle, DNA replication, and other processes
  in Fig 2.'
