caption: Proliferation of β-cells or precursors is regulated by the classical cdk-pRB-E2F
  pathway. In this way, proliferative stimuli activates cdk4 that phosphorylates the
  retinoblastoma protein pRB, thereby releasing E2F activity which regulates the expression
  of genes, such as TK or DHFR implicated in cell division. In this context, CKIs,
  such as p27 inhibit cdk4 action and have a negative role in β-cell expansion. In
  addition to the control of β-cell proliferation cell cycle regulators participate
  in the insulin secretion process of β-cells. Under glucose-stimulated insulin signalling
  the cyclin D/cdk holoenzyme phosphorylates pRB and facilitates the expression of
  Kir6.2 gene under the control of E2F1. Expression of the ATP-dependent Kir6.2 potassium
  channel is required for insulin secretion.
