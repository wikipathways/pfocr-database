caption: Schematic presentation of BAD serine 134 phosphorylation in RAF and RAS mutant
  tumor cells. Stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (TRK) at the plasma membrane
  (PM) leads to activation of RAS GTPases and RAF kinases. The cell lines HCT 116,
  DX3, and MEL-Juso carry mutated RAS genes, resulting in enhanced activation of the
  PI3K/Akt pathway. Although Akt was shown to be a BAD-targeting kinase, it has a
  minor contribution in phosphorylating BAD at serine 134. The cell lines A375 and
  SK-MEL-28 harbor an activating mutation within B-RAF (V600E) that leads to elevated
  phosphorylation of BAD serine 134, mainly through the MEK-ERK cascade. The specific
  inhibitors of RAF, MEK, and PI3K are highlighted in blue boxes. Phosphorylation
  of BAD at serine 134 affects the efficiency of apoptosis and proliferation. Thick
  arrows indicate enhanced activation or phosphorylation. For more details, see “Results”
  and “Discussion” sections.
