caption: The release of glutamate from presynaptic neurons leads to activation of
  glial AMPA receptors with subsequent receptor phosphorylation by PKCα bound to PICK1
  and dissociation of receptor-bound GRIP. The latter then binds to and activates
  SR, which promotes the formation of D-serine. Additionally, PICK1 might bring PKCα
  into the vicinity of SR, thus, facilitating its phosphorylation and effecting enzyme
  activity. The newly synthesized D-serine is stored in vesicles and released into
  the synapse where glutamate and D-serine co-activate NMDA receptors on postsynaptic
  neurons. Potentially, D-serine might be degraded by either intracellular DAO or
  SR following reuptake of the neurotransmitter or it might be dissipated by diffusion
  from the synaptic cleft.
