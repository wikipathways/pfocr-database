caption: Posttranslational modification of NLRP3 inflammasome components via ubiquitination
  and deubiquitination. Ubiquitination is a reversible PTM in which Ub is covalently
  attached to lysine (K) residues of target proteins, particularly involving K48-,
  K63-, and K27/K29-linked ubiquitination. Pellino-1 promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  by attaching K63-linked ubiquitin chains to K55 of ASC, whereas USP50 counteracts
  this process by removing K63-linked chains from ASC, thereby inhibiting activation.
  HUWE1 and MARCH5 catalyze K27-linked polyubiquitination of NLRP3 at unknown sites
  within the PYD domain and at K324 and K430 in the NACHT domain, respectively. Ubc13
  facilitates K63-linked polyubiquitination of NLRP3 at K565 and K687, while OTUD6A
  removes K48-linked ubiquitin chains from K430 and K689. Additionally, ABRO1 enhances
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation by competing with WWP2 for binding to BRCC3. TET2
  deficiency promotes JNK1 activation and BRCC3-mediated deubiquitination, further
  contributing to NLRP3 activation. TRIM50 inhibits NLRP3 ubiquitination, thereby
  inducing inflammasome activation. Similarly, TRIM62 and RNF31 enhance the K63-linked
  ubiquitination of NLRP3, promoting its activation. HSPA8 facilitates the degradation
  of SKP2, which in turn decreases NLRP3 ubiquitination and leads to inflammasome
  activation. Conversely, STING negatively regulates NLRP3 activation by reducing
  both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination of NLRP3. Several deubiquitinating enzymes
  (DUBs), including USP30, USP9X, USP14, UCHL5, USP47, USP7, and ZNF70, promote NLRP3
  inflammasome activation by removing ubiquitin chains from NLRP3. Specifically, USP47
  also enhances activation by suppressing miR-138-5p through a ZNF883-dependent mechanism.
  In contrast, TRIM31 mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of NLRP3 at K496, targeting
  it for proteasomal degradation. YAP facilitates NLRP3 degradation via β-TRCP1-mediated
  K27-linked ubiquitination at K380. TRIM65 induces both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination
  of NLRP3, disrupting the NEK7–NLRP3 interaction. TNFAIP3 promotes K48-linked ubiquitination
  of NEK7 at K189 and K293, leading to its proteasomal degradation, while METTL3 enhances
  the degradation of TNFAIP3 transcripts. Parkin and CHIP mediate K48-linked polyubiquitination
  of NLRP3, resulting in its proteasomal degradation in microglia and other contexts,
  respectively. Furthermore, TRIM24, TRIM40, and TRIM59 promote NLRP3 ubiquitination.
  The E3 ligase gp78/Insig-1 mediates K48-/K63-linked ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting
  NLRP3 oligomerization. STAMBP restrains inflammasome activity by removing K63-linked
  polyubiquitin chains from NLRP3. SLC25A3 promotes NLRP3 ubiquitination, disrupting
  the NLRP3–NEK7 interaction. Finally, TIMP2 enhances NLRP3 ubiquitination and facilitates
  its degradation via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. ABRO1 Abraxas brother protein
