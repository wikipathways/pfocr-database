caption: 'Overview of main route to ascorbate through l-galactose in plants highlighting
  various features and known regulatory points of control for the various enzymatic
  steps. Alternative pathways are included but not detailed. See text for enzyme abbreviations
  (isoforms not listed e.g., VTC2/VTC5 etc.); red text denotes Galacturonate pathway
  enzyme; green text denotes l-galactose pathway enzymes; and dark yellow text denotes
  recycling pathway enzymes. Triplet arrows denote two or more steps of conversion.
  Hollow arrows denote substrates shunted to other processes/states (e.g., polymerization).
  Footnotes: ɫ: collective noun for these three oxidative states is ‘ascorbate’, also
  expressed as ‘total ascorbate’ in empirical measurements; Z: oxidation can be by
  direct chemical interaction or enzyme mediated (e.g., by ascorbate oxidases/peroxidases
  etc.); d: different action between tissue types e.g., leaves versus fruit. g: also
  activates MIOX4 (involved in myo-inositol synthesis) transcription (not detailed).
  i: binds to CSN5B to inhibit CSN5B binding to GMP.'
