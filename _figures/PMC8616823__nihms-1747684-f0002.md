caption: Multiple signalling pathways are activated in brain tumour microenvironment
  astrocytes and tumour-associated macrophages, but their contribution to immunosuppression
  as well as the dominance of a specific pathway within specific subpopulations (not
  shown) are unknown. Astrocytes (part a) upregulate genes encoding immunosuppressive
  (IL-10, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and PDL1) and pro-oncogenic (CHI3L1)
  factors in the glioma tumour microenvironment, while nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling
  is concomitantly induced by tumour-derived RANKL. STAT3 is a central regulator of
  astrocyte reactivity programmes and characterizes a brain metastasis-promoting astrocyte
  subset. Other subsets promote tumour growth through paracrine factors such as brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or TNF through cell contact-dependent (CX43) or cell
  contact-independent mechanisms. Microglia (part b) and monocyte-derived macrophages
  (MDMs) (part c) can have both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions.
  In microglia (part b), tumour sensing (SIGLEC-H and GPR34) and homeostatic (CX3C-chemokine
  receptor 1 (CX3CR1)) programmes are disrupted, while TLR2 and NRP1 signalling respectively
  increase tumour invasion and immunosuppression. In monocyte-derived macrophages
  (part c), an anti-inflammatory phenotype supported by aryl hydrocarbon receptor
  (AHR) activation suppresses T cell responses (part d) via the catabolism of ATP.
  T cells supply tumour-associated macrophages with a CSF1R-independent survival signal
  by inducing IGF1 via IL-4. Anti-tumour T cell responses are suppressed by cytokines
  such as IL-10 and TGFβ, checkpoint proteins such as PDL1 and VISTA, and adenosine
  signalling. Overall T cell exhaustion is evidenced by increased immune-checkpoint
  expression and the inhibitory receptors A2aR and CD161 are broadly present in glioblastoma-infiltrating
  T cells. ARGl, arginase 1; cGAMP, cyclic GMP–AMP; EGF, epidermal growth factor;
