caption: Paradoxical activation of the ERK5 C-terminal TAD function by ERK5i and ERK5
  PROTACS as a potential solution. (A) All ERK5i tested to date, including XMD8-92,
  XMD17-109, XMD17-26, AX15836, compound 46, compound 34b, and BAY-885 (and represented
  by orange circle) have been shown to bind to the ERK5 kinase domain and cause a
  conformational change that leads to the exposure of the NLS, nuclear localisation,
  and paradoxical activation of the C-terminal TAD, albeit to varying degrees (; ).
  This is seen with AX15836, compound 46, and BAY-885 as well as XMD8-92 so it is
  unrelated to BRD4 activity. The fact that this is seen at doses that inhibit ERK5
  kinase activity indicates that this is a kinase-independent activity of ERK5 and
  is consistent with kinase independent biological effects of ERK5 (). (B) Since ERK5
  possesses both kinase-dependent and -independent functions and the latter are not
  targeted by conventional ERK5 kinase inhibitors, other approaches are required to
  fully inhibit the various biochemical functions of ERK5. One attractive approach
  is to a develop proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTAC) in which a potent, selective
  ERK5 ligand (represented by orange circle) is linked to an E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiting
  ligand (represented by green circle), resulting in the poly-ubiquitylation and degradation
  of ERK5. This approach will ablate all ERK5 functions including catalytic activities,
  allosteric regulatory sites, scaffolding or protein-protein interaction sites and
  the TAD function. The availability of potent and selective ERK5i (AX15836, compound
  46, compound 34b, and BAY-885) may allow the relatively rapid development and testing
  of an ERK5 PROTAC.
