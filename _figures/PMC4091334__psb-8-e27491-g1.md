caption: Figure 1. Illustration of a potential mechanism for the observed role for
  an apoplastic diffusion barrier (the embryonic cuticle) in robust epidermal cell
  fate establishment during Arabidopsis embryogenesis. A signaling feedback loop within
  the embryo, implicating the receptor kinase ACR4, the hypothetical ACR4 ligand (L)
  and the transcription factors ATML1 and PDF2, is established during very early embryogenesis
  and is necessary for the maintenance of epidermal fate in the outer cell layer of
  the embryo. This maintenance depends upon levels of Ligand L which, in the absence
  of an apoplastic barrier, is free to move away from the embryo in the apoplast.
  At around the late globular stage in development, as the endosperm starts to cellularize,
  a second signaling pathway involving the receptor-like kinases GSO1 and GSO2 and
  the endosperm-specific subtilisin protease ALE1 (produced under the control of the
  bHLH transcription factor ZOU), mediates a reinforcement of the embryonic cuticle,
  effectively sealing off the embryo to permit maintenance of high levels of ligand
  L within the embryo and thus stabilize epidermal cell fate. Solid arrows represent
  positive regulation which can be either direct or indirect. ENDO CW = Endosperm
  Cell Wall, EMBR CW = Embryo Cell Wall.
