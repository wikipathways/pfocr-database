caption: CircRNAs function as miRNA sponges to influence viral replication. (A) A
  quintuple ceRNA network exists in SARS-CoV-1 infection that includes one miRNA (MMU-miR-124-3p),
  one lncRNA (Gm26917), one TF (Stat2), one mRNA (Ddx58) and two circRNAs (Ppp1r10,
  C330019G07Rik). They form a closed 3-node miRNA feed-forward loop and a 4-node ceRNA
  network, respectively. Upregulation of Ddx58 leads to reprogramming of miRNA splicing
  events, resulting in downregulation of miRNA expression. Meanwhile, the helicase
  domain of the RIG-I/Ddx58 receptor can interact with SARS-CoV-1 nonstructural protein
  13 (NSP13) to initiate the viral life cycle. Furthermore, Ppp1r10 and C330019G07Rik
  act as sponges for miR-124-3p, inhibiting miR-124-3p expression, which in turn impedes
  Ddx58 degradation and further inhibits SARS-CoV-1 replication (). (B) circ_0067985
  derived from the FNDC3B gene and circ_0006275 derived from the CNOT1 gene serve
  as miR-127 and miR-2392 sponges, respectively, to regulate the downstream expression
  of MAP3K9, MYO15B, SPOCK1, MEF2C, USP15 and ZBTB11. Of these, the upstream regulator
  of the MAPK pathway, MAP3K9, further regulates the downstream ERK/MAPK pathway to
  inhibit MERS-CoV replication ().
