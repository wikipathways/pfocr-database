caption: Figure 1.Network analysis of “sleep-related” genes in Drosophila. (A) A gene
  interaction network built based on gene ontology weighting using GeneMANIA from
  genes implicated in sleep regulation in Drosophila. Dark blue circles represent
  genes that are part of a network, while light blue circles are genes that are not
  part of a network based on current experimental evidence. Blue lines denote reported
  physical interactions between protein products, while green lines represent known
  genetic interactions from previous studies. (B) Gene Ontology (GO) analysis in GeneMANIA
  reveals a high degree of enrichment for signaling and MAP kinase pathway members.
  The network can be easily rearranged to highlight these components (green circles)
  and obtain an idea of the number and identity of these genes. Genes that are part
  of this network include the three MAP kinase members (known as basket (JNK), rolled
  (ERK) and p38b (p38 MAPK) in flies), upstream kinases such as Mekk1 and target transcription
  factors such as Fos (known as kayak in flies) and Jun (known as jra in flies). Such
  analysis suggests that future studies should focus on members of this network as
  potential sleep regulatory elements. The rest of the network shows the original
  sleep-related genes in gray and other members of the overall network in white.
