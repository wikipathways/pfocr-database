caption: The role of BACE1 in the leptin pathway. BACE1 contributes to dysregulated
  leptin signaling directly and indirectly. Elevated BACE1 expression is associated
  with increased PTP1B and SOCS3, which negatively regulate JAK2/STAT3 signaling,
  preventing leptin‐stimulated gene regulation. When BACE1 is reduced, energy expenditure
  is increased likely via increases in UCP1 expression and □‐oxidation. Aβ‐mediated
  inflammation can cause JAK/STAT3 signaling and ER stress, which can increase PTP1B
  and SOCS‐3 transcription, and regulate genes important in appetite and body weight
  regulation and β‐oxidation. Created with BioRender.com
