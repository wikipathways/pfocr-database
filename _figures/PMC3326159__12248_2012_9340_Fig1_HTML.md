caption: Example of multiple clearance pathways affecting the pharmacokinetics of
  a typical protein therapeutic. Depicted is a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model
  with intravenous administration of a dose (D), concentrations of the protein therapeutic
  in the central (PT 1) and peripheral (PT 2) compartment, and interdepartmental clearance
  Q. The pharmacokinetic model includes two clearance pathways, one from the central
  compartment (CL 1) representative of for example renal metabolism or proteolytic
  degradation through the reticuloendothelial system, and a second unspecific proteolytic
  degradation pathway from the peripheral compartment (CL 2) Added to these two clearance
  pathways is, on the right side, a target-mediated disposition pathway that constitutes
  interaction of the protein therapeutic with its pharmacologic target receptor, which
  is in a homeostatic equilibrium of synthesis and degradation (synthesis rate k syn
  and degradation rate constant k deg). The dynamic equilibrium for the formation
  of the resulting protein therapeutic–receptor complex (PT–R) is determined through
  the association rate constant k on and the dissociation rate constant k off. The
  formation of PT–R does not only elicit the pharmacologic effect, but also triggers
  degradation of the complex. Thus, target binding and subsequent PT–R degradation
  constitute an additional clearance pathway for the protein therapeutic (CL 3). The
  left side of the graphic depicts the effect of an immune response to the protein
  therapeutic resulting in ADA formation. Again, the circulating concentration of
  the ADA is determined by a homeostatic equilibrium between its formation rate (k
  formation) and a catabolic turnover process (rate constant k cat). The ADA response
  results in the formation of immune complexes with the drug (ADA–PT). Dependent on
  the size and structure of the immune complexes, endogenous elimination pathways
  through the reticuloendothelial system may be triggered, most likely via Fcγ-mediated
  endocytosis. Thus, immune complex formation and subsequent degradation may constitute
  an additional clearance pathway (CL 4) for protein therapeutics
