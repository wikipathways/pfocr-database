caption: a) Signaling pathways and transcription regulation of adipogenesis. The insulin
  (Ins) and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) pathways promoted lipid accumulation
  by inhibiting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg), the master
  regulator of adipogenesis. The Wnt and hedgehog (HH) pathways conversely inhibit
  this process. CAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPb) and C/EBPd activate PPARg
  and C/EBPa, which in turn form a positive feedback loop and promote expression of
  genes that drive the adipocyte phenotype. This pathway is regulated by a variety
  of other factors, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5),
  sirtuin (SIRT 1 and 2), and foxhead box protein 01 (FOX01) (). b) Structure of fatty
  acids prevalent in consumer meat products.
