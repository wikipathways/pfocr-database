caption: Multimeric IgG immune complexes engage multiple Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) through
  low-affinity, high-avidity interactions (step 1). Receptor crosslinking upon IgG
  immune complex binding triggers phosphorylation (P) of their immunoreceptor tyrosine
  activating motifs (ITAMs), which in turn leads to the activation of kinases of the
  SYK and SRC family (step 2), as well as activation of the protein kinase C (PKC)
  pathway, resulting in a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels following activation
  of Ca2+ channels (step 3). Kinase activation also leads to actin remodelling (step
  4), which is critical for receptor internalization and phagocytosis of the IgG immune
  complex. At later stages, cellular activation is associated with activation of specific
  transcription factors such as p38 and Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) (step 5)
  that drive the expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  (for example, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1β and IL-8) (step 6) that shape
  immune responses and alter the effector function, migration and survival of leukocytes.
