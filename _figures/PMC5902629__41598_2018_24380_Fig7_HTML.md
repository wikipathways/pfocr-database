caption: Proposed function of HadD in the mycolic acid biosynthesis pathway in M.
  smegmatis. The biosynthesis process of the meromycolic chain starts from the methyl-terminal
  end. After a first set of FAS-II elongation cycles, the possible dehydratation-isomerization
  of a C20-C22 3-hydroxyacyl-AcpM intermediate would allow the introduction of the
  future distal cis double bond (Fig. ) in the meromycolic chains. After a second
  set of FAS-II elongation cycles, a Claisen-type condensation of the resulting short
  α′-meromycoloyl chains with a carboxy-C22/C24 fatty acyl-CoA by Pks13 enzyme, followed
  by transfer onto trehalose (Tre) and reduction, generates the trehalose α′-MA esters.
  A second possible dehydratation-isomerization of the α′-meromycoloyl chains would
  introduce the future proximal cis double bond (Fig. ). After a third set of FAS-II
  elongation cycles including (3R)-hydroxyacyl-AcpM dehydratation steps, the condensation
  of the resulting long α-meromycoloyl chains with a carboxy-C22/C24 fatty acyl-CoA
  generates the trehalose α-MA esters. Finally, methyl transfer and oxidation reactions
  allow the biosynthesis of the epoxy-MA esters. HadD would catalyze either the dehydratation-isomerization
  or the dehydratation reactions during the synthesis of the third meromycolic segment
  (orange frame) (see also Fig. ). The total carbon number of the different acyl chains
  are mentioned.
