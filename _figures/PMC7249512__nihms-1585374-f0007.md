caption: Newly emerged females were injected with dsRNA targeting A. aegypti PK (dsRNA-PK)
  or dsRNA against firefly luciferase (dsRNA-FL) and fed a blood meal supplemented
  with [1,2-13C2]-glucose. Measurements for glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate
  were made by HRAM-IC/MS, and measurements for pyruvate and lactate were made with
  HRAM -LC/MS. Plots of the measured relative abundance of [13C]-isotopologs against
  the degree of [13C]-labeling for metabolites that exhibited kinetic enrichment of
  [13C]-labeling. Each column corresponds to a single metabolite isotopolog series,
  and each individual data plot corresponds to an individual time point, over the
  time course studied. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three independent samples
  (*P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001 when compared to dsRNA-FL). N = 15 mosquitoes for each
  time point.
