caption: 'Mechanisms of ADSCs differentiation into SMC and EC. TGF-β pathway plays
  a central role in the differentiation of ADSCs into SMC. ADSCs secrete TGF-β through
  MEK/ERK-dependent mechanism when treated with SPC. Meanwhile, SPC activates the
  Rho/ROCK system and subsequently promotes the binding of MRTF and SRF. MRTF, SRF,
  Smad2/3 and Myocardin jointly initiate the expression of smooth muscle related genes.
  Med23 represses SMC differentiation via promoting ELK1-SRF to combine with the promoter.
  PI3K pathway involves in EC differentiation of ADSCs. EC: endothelial cell, SMC:
  smooth muscle cell, ROCK: Rho-associated protein kinase, SRF: serum response factor,
  MRTF: myocardin related transcription factor, ELK1: ETS Like-1 protein.'
