caption: A diagram of growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) function in transforming
  growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced skin fibrosis. During the onset of skin fibrosis,
  infiltrating immune cells secrete TGF-β, which activates resident fibroblasts through
  the mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3) signaling pathway. GAS5 suppresses
  the progression of fibrosis by promoting Smad3 dephosphorylation through facilitating
  protein phosphatase 1A (PPM1A) binding to Smad3, thus inhibiting Smad3-mediated
  myofibroblast activation. GAS5 also inhibits fibroblast proliferation through the
  impeding JNK signaling pathway.
