caption: Putative signaling pathway involved in radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction.
  In general, activation of Akt occurs through the binding of growth factors (GF)
  to their specific receptor (reviewed in () and, in salivary acinar cells, requires
  the activation of PI-3 kinase (combined p85 and p110 subunits) (). An important
  molecule that regulates the DNA damage response is p53, and negative regulation
  of p53 protein levels by Akt is mediated via activation of the Murine Double Minute
  Clone 2 (MDM2). p53 activation following radiation leads to apoptosis of salivary
  acinar cells (arrows mark activated caspase-3-positive cells) and subsequent loss
  of function. It is probable that other pathways (right-side icon) regulating the
  apoptotic response, discussed in the section “Other Pathways Involved in Radiation
  Damage”, could play a role in radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction. In addition,
  other factors (left-side icon), such as autophagy, necrosis, senescence, etc., could
  be involved in DNA damage, leading to loss of function.
