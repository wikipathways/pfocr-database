caption: Potential key targets of aspirin in PIK3CA-mutated CRC. Mutations of the
  PIK3CA helical and kinase domain lead to an overactivity of PI3K (visualized by
  multiple arrows). Helical domain mutations decouple the enzyme from upstream signals
  by RTK, indicated by the red “X”, although it has to be noted that Ras-GTP activation
  by external signals may still be required for full PI3K activation. Kinase domain
  mutations are, however, independent from Ras-GTP activation. PI3K activates Akt
  and PDK1. mTOR is both an activator of Akt and a downstream target and, therefore,
  closely linked to its actions. mTOR has been identified as a direct acetylation
  target of aspirin (ASA), and is presumably inhibited by this. Akt is the central
  player connecting most pathways, however, glutaminolysis may be influenced by PDK1
  Akt-independently. Aspirin has been reported to inhibit PDK1-mediated glutaminolysis
  by an, as yet, unresolved mechanism. Further, salicylate and aspirin have been observed
  to suppress NF-κB via IκB, thereby reducing chemoresistance in cancer cells. NF-κB
  is also involved in COX-2 expression. COX-2 has been reported to act upstream of
  PI3K via PGE2/EP4 and to modify the activity of growth factor receptors (e.g. IGFR
  or EGFR), inducing its own expression via a feedback loop. It is acetylated by aspirin
  at S516 which disables the production of PGH2, but enables the formation of aspirin-triggered
  lipoxin (AT-L) and resolvins (AT-Rv) in a transcellular fashion. In addition, salicylate
  may suppress the transcription of COX-2 mRNA. In addition, aspirin has been reported
  to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin-mediated signaling, although the exact target of aspirin
  in this context is unclear. Wnt/β-catenin are also substantially involved in the
  pathophysiology of cancer stem cells, which are highly associated with therapy-resistance
  and metastasis. Stemness of these cells may also be inhibited by aspirin via p300
  and NANOG. NF-κB may also be involved. Gut bacteria are involved in inflammatory
  processes and the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. In this context, it has
  been observed that aspirin can influence the growth of intestinal bacteria, possibly
  leading to a shift in the intestinal microbiome towards a more favorable composition.
  The named pathways and their potential interconnections are shown. Arrows illustrate
  the connections between them, arrow thickness is related to their hypothetical importance
  in the carcinogenesis of the PI3K pathway. The microbiome, inflammation, as well
  as AT-L and AT-Rv formation are depicted, despite not being directly involved in
  PI3K signaling. However, as they are influenced by aspirin, they might enhance the
  anticarcinogenic effect seen in patients with PIK3CA-mutated CRC
