caption: Mechanism of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor
  (NLR) family apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP)-NLR family caspase recruitment
  domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) inflammasome-mediated PANoptosis, inflammatory
  cell death. Ligands from Gram-negative bacteria such as needle and inner rod protein
  of the Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) can be detected by murine NAIP1 and NAIP2,
  respectively, whereas flagellin can be detected by murine NAIP5/NAIP6. The single
  human NAIP (hNAIP) detects all the T3SS proteins such as needle, inner rod protein,
  and flagellin. After detecting T3SS proteins, NAIP associates with NLRC4 to induce
  activation of the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome. This activation results in inflammasome
  assembly and the cleavage and activation of caspase-1 (CASP1). Activated CASP1 triggers
  gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis. NLRC4 also activates caspase-8 (CASP8),
  which goes on to activate caspase-3/-7 (CASP3/7) to trigger apoptosis. Activation
  of the necroptotic pathway has also been observed during S. Typhimurium infection;
  this may occur through inhibition of CASP8. NAIPs are transcriptionally induced
  by interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8).
