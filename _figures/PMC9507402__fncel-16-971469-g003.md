caption: Therapeutic targets in the pyroptotic pathways after ICH. To date, several
  inhibitors have been described for the NLRP1/NLRP3/NLRC4 inflammasome and caspase-1
  after ICH. RO27-3225 suppressed NLRP1-dependent pyroptosis via inhibiting MC4R-mediated
  ASK/JNK/P38 MAPK signaling pathway. Maraviroc (MVC) suppressed PKA/CREB/NLRP1 signaling
  pathway via inhibiting CCR5. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome
  by inhibiting P2 × 7 receptor. Hypoxia-pretreated olfactory mucosal mesenchymal
  stem cells (OM-MSCs) are known to decrease the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome.
  Additionally, specific inhibition of NLRP3 has been reported by studies using its
  derivative MCC950. RGS2 suppressed the interaction of LRRK2 and NLRC4 and NLRC4
  inflammasome activation by regulating pLRRK2. Belnacasan (VX-765) and Ac-YYAD-cmk
  are bioavailable prodrugs of a potent inhibitor for caspase-1.
