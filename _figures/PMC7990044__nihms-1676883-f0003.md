caption: Examples of genetic modifications designed to prevent known xenograft injury
  (top) include Gal α1–3Gal (Gal) and 2 other carbohydrate (CHO) gene knockouts (TKO),
  and expression of human complement pathway regulatory proteins (hCPRPs), coagulation
  pathway regulatory proteins (eg, thrombomodulin [hTBM] and endothelial protein C
  receptor [hEPCR]), and self-recognition receptors (hCD47; human leukocyte antigen-E
  [HLA-E]; bottom). Absence of carbohydrate antigens (CHO TKO) and expression of human
  complement and coagulation pathway regulatory molecules reduce endothelial activation
  and injury and promote endothelial cytoprotective mechanisms. Expression of self-recognition
  receptors inhibits (red negative symbols, bottom) pathogenic mechanisms mediated
  by monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells that contribute to cross-species injury
  (green positive symbols, top). In addition to the pathways illustrated, hCD39, human
  tissue factor pathway inhibitor, hemoxygenase-1, and A20 are among the human genes
  included in some of the various multigene pig constructs that are currently under
  preclinical evaluation. aPC indicates activated protein C; PAR-1, proteinase-activated
  receptor 1; and SIRPα, signal regulatory protein-α.
