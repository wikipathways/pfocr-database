caption: Example of EGFR-mediated signaling changes, a commonly disrupted pathway
  in lung cancer. The EGFR pathway could be disrupted by an increased expression of
  growth factor ligands. By targeting EGFR with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
  and MAb (monoclonal antibodies), EGFR activity can be eliminated. However, a downstream
  factor (e.g. MAPK signaling pathway) may also be activated to disrupt the pathway,
  thus making TKIs ineffective. Pathway data was obtained and selected from the Cancer
  Cell Map database and drawn using Cytoscape.
