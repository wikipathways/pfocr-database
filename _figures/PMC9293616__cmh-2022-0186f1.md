caption: Mechanisms for protective effects by UDCA, silymarin, DDB and its combination
  with other supplements, vitamin E, and aspirin in chronic liver diseases. UDCA and
  silymarin negatively regulate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inhibiting
  Bax translocation, reinforcing Bcl-2 activity, and blocking the activations of caspase-3
  and -12, which prevents the apoptosis of hepatocytes in chronic liver diseases.
  Moreover, UDCA, silymarin, vitamin E, and organosulfur (from garlic oil) relieve
  ROS-mediated oxidative stress in hepatocytes. Cytosolic FFA contributes to the intracellular
  ROS pool, and carnitine shuttles FFA-derived acyl-coenzyme as into the mitochondria,
  making them to undergo β-oxidation. TNF-α/IL-6 receptor signaling and TLR signaling
  upregulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB activation, while
  UDCA, silymarin, DDB, vitamin E, and carnitine block this pathway in both hepatocytes
  and Kupffer cells. UDCA increases the secretion of bile acids via the upregulation
  of the hepatobiliary transporter genes, such BSEP, MRP2, and MRP3, and also enhances
  biliary bicarbonate excretion. Interestingly, UDCA induces neutral lipid accumulation
  in hepatocytes by exerting FXR-antagonistic effects. Aspirin attenuates intrahepatic
  inflammation by blocking platelet-derived, GPIbα-mediated Kupffer cell activation.
