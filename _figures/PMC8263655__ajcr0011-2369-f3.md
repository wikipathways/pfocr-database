caption: LncRNA LNMAT1 acts on NF-κB pathway to up-regulate the expression of CCL2
  in tumor cells to induce TAMs to differentiate into M2 macrophages. Meanwhile, TAMs
  can also secrete the lymphangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor C
  (VEGF-C) and act on the VEGFC/VEGFR3 signaling pathway, ultimately promote tumor
  immune escapepromotes tumor survival and metastasis.
