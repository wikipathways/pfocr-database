caption: Synaptic NMDARs couple strongly to Ras activation, with Ca2+-dependent activation
  of RasGRF being a prime mediator of this (although other mechanisms are also likely
  to contribute, such as activation of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) by Ca2+–calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II (CaMKII)). In contrast, extrasynaptic NMDARs cause inactivation
  of Ras and ERK. While the molecular basis of this is unclear, several Ca2+-dependent,
  NMDAR-associated signalling molecules are known to inhibit Ras and ERK. The ERK-inactivating
  phosphatase STEP is activated by the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, while
  the Ras-inactivating synGAP is activated by CaMKII (not inhibited, as was previously
  thought). Differences between the synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR signalling complex
  may explain their opposing influence on the Ras–ERK signalling pathway.
