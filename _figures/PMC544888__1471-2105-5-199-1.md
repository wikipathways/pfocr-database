caption: 'Hierarchical structure of E. coli transcriptional regulatory network. A:
  The original unorganized network. B: the hierarchical regulation structure in which
  all the regulatory links are downward. Nodes in the graph are operons. Links show
  the transcriptional regulatory relationships. The global regulators found in this
  work are shown in red. The yellow marked nodes are operons in the longest regulatory
  pathway related with flagella motility.'
