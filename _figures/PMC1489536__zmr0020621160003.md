caption: 'Denitrification process. Shown is a hypothetical model of the denitrification
  pathway in P. stutzeri, which comprises respiratory nitrate reductase (NAR), nitrite
  reductase (NIR), NO reductase (NOR), and N2O reductase (N2OR). Furthermore, evidence
  for the presence of a periplasmic nitrate reductase (NAP) in P. stutzeri exists
  (). The postulated nitrate/nitrite antiporter at the inner membrane has been also
  included in the model. The organization of the nar (), nir, nor, and nos () genes
  of P. stutzeri is also shown. The numbers of amino acids of the hypothetical gene
  products are used to label unassigned ORFs. Abbreviations: b, heme B; c, heme C;
  c551, cytochrome c551; CuA and CuZ, copper centers A and Z, respectively; Cyt c,
  unspecified c-type cytochromes accepting electrons from bc1; Cyt cb, cytochrome
  cb terminal oxidase complex; Cyt bc1, cytochrome bc1 complex; d1, heme D1; FeS,
  iron-sulfur centers; MGD, molybdenum cofactor; orf, open reading frames; Q, QH2
  quinone cycle. Gene abbreviations are described in the text. (Adapted from references
  138 and 230; adapted from reference 420 with permission.)'
