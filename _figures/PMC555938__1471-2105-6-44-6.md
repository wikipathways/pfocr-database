caption: The metabolic shift pathway of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae according to
  the dynamic regulatory modeling in Table 2. The related genes are represented as
  ovals with different colors of light blue (fermentation), light yellow (gluconeogenesis),
  and gray (other relevant genes not as target genes). There are three types of lines
  with colors of red (activation), blue (repression), and black. In addition to the
  black line representing the signal pipes from genes, the red lines are shown depending
  on the degree of activation whilst the blue lines are shown depending on the degree
  of repression. The black square symbol attached on the lines is the bifurcate node
  from the same signal source. And the circle symbol attached on the lines is the
  collecting nodes from different signal sources. The colored degree bar between activation
  and repression is also shown in the bottom of the figure.
