caption: 'RUNX3 and p53 act independently and in concert to elicit their tumour suppressive
  function. (A) DNA damage or oncogene-induced replication stress induces ATR/ATM-mediated
  checkpoint activation. Activation of checkpoint machinery induces interaction between
  RUNX3 and p300, which in turn stabilizes phosphorylated and acetylated p53 to allow
  transcription of p53-dependent genes for cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. (B) On
  the other hand, oncogene activation induces mitogenic signalling by activation of
  downstream MEK1–ERK1 pathway. Mode 1: this signalling event allows the interaction
  between RUNX3–p300–BRD2 inducing transcription of ARF. ARF expression stabilizes
  p53 at protein level allowing transcription of p53 target genes. Mode 2: mitogenic
  signalling stimulates RUNX3–BRD2–pRB complex formation. This complex binds onto
  p21 promoter through RUNX-binding sites and induces p21 expression. Prolonged p21
  expression inhibits further cell cycle progression.'
