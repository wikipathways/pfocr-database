caption: Intracellular SK-1 and SK-2 activity. The activation of SK-1 and SK-2 occurs
  via ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to proinflammatory mediators, such as histamine
  and TNFα. Upon the activation, SK-1 is translocated from the cytoplasm to plasma
  membrane where it catalyses sphingosine to form S1P. S1P can then be transported
  outside the cell and then act back on its receptors to induce the activation of
  G-proteins for subsequent cellular changes, such as survival, proliferation, and
  migration. In contrast, SK-2 activity is associated primarily with the nuclear membrane,
  where it is phosphorylated prior to being translocated out of the nucleus. At the
  nuclear membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, S1P can be dephosphorylated to sphingosine
  and ceramide via the sphingolipid salvage pathway where many enzymes including sphingomyelinases,
  cerebrosidases, ceramides, and ceramide synthases are involved to induce apoptosis.
