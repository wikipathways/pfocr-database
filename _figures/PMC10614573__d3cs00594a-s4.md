caption: (A) A subset of reaction pathways that account for the majority of the formose
  observed behaviour. The Breslow's autocatalytic cycle is at the centre, and serves
  as a continuous source of small sugars (mostly two- and three-carbon ones), while
  various dominant formaldehyde chain-growth reaction pathways arise from the cycle
  components. Only key compounds, such as those constituting the Breslow cycle, dihydroxyacetone
  (3) and fructose (7), have been numbered. Adapted with permission from ref. . Copyright

  to that of gluconeogenesis, that could be subject to occur through non-enzymatic
  reactions. From glucose-6-phosphate, it would be possible to generated ribose-5-phosphate
  through an analogous version of the pentose phosphate pathway (not shown). Compounds
  G3P, DMAP, F1,6BP and F6P in panel B are phosphorylated versions of compounds 2,
  3 and 7 in panel A. Adapted with permission from ref. . Copyright 2020 American
