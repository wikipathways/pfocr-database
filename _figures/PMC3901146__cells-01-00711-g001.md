caption: 'Regulation of cellular stress-induced cell death pathways by IAPs. Cellular
  stress likely activates the intrinsic pathway of cell death involving the release
  from the mitochondria, of pro-apoptotic factors including cytochrome c and Smac.
  Once in the cytoplasm, cytochrome c induces an ATP-dependent conformational change
  and oligomerization of APAF-1 (apoptotic peptidase activating factor-1) in the Apoptosome.
  APAF-1 then recruits and promotes the activation, through homodimerization, of the
  initiator caspase-9. Active caspase-9 is then stabilized by auto-processing and
  detached from apoptosome. DNA damage can also induce a depletion of cIAP1 and XIAP,
  allowing the formation of a RIP-1 containing platform named Ripoptosome. Ripoptosome
  can trigger either caspase-8 or -10 activation and apoptosis, or caspase-independent
  cell death referred to as Necroptosis. Initiator caspases-9, -8 or -10 induce the
  activating proteolytic processing of effector caspase-3 and/or -7 responsible for
  apoptotic cell death. IAPs can inhibit apoptotic pathways at several levels: 1)
  cIAPs and XIAP are potent inhibitors of Ripoptosome assembly; 2) XIAP can directly
  inhibit the activity of processed forms of caspase-9, -3 or -7; cIAPs;3) XIAP can
  induce the K48 ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of processed forms
  of caspase-9, -3 or -7; 4) NAIP is able to block the proteolytic processing of caspase-9
  at the Apoptosome level; 5) cIAPs, ML-IAP and Apollon can bind to Smac, preventing
  it from neutralizing XIAP. SMs: Smac mimetics; UPS: ubiquitin-proteasome system.'
