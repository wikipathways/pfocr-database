caption: A schematic model illustrating the mechanisms by which DSF/Cu activates innate
  immune signaling pathway to enhance anti-tumor immunity and potentiate therapeutic
  responses to PD-1 checkpoint blockade (created with BioRender.com). DSF/Cu induces
  oxidative stress and DNA damage in tumor cells by generating excessive ROS. This
  process leads to the release of cytosolic dsDNA, which robustly activates the cancer
  cell-intrinsic cGAS-STING-dependent innate immune signaling pathway. Consequently,
  tumor cells produce IFNβ and pro-inflammatory chemokines, such as CCL5 and CXCL10,
  which recruit conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes, and
  natural killer (NK) cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME). This infiltration
  converts the TME into an inflamed or "hot" immunophenotype, enhancing sensitivity
  to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Therefore, the combination of DSF/Cu with
  anti-PD-1 antibodies significantly enhances immune responses, demonstrating superior
  therapeutic efficacy in suppressing tumor growth
