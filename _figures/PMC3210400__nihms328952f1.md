caption: Overview of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in animals showing the predicted
  functional roles of Ae. aegypti acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) of and fatty acid synthase
  1 (FAS1). Hexose sugars from nectar meals, and ketogenic amino acids from blood
  meals, are converted into the fatty acid substrate acetyl-CoA, which is used to
  synthesize malonyl-CoA, the precursor to palmitate. RNAi-mediated knock down of
  ACC and FAS1 expression should result in altered levels of the acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA,
  both of which are regulators of other metabolic and signaling pathways.
