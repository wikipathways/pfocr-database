caption: The diagram on the right summarizes positions that are typically monitored
  by NMR to estimate hepatic fluxes. (Note that all H and C positions are potentially
  labeled with this combination of tracers.) Glucose labeling from heavy water (2H2O)
  allows discrimination between contributions of glycogen, glycerol and TCA cycle
  intermediates towards endogenous glucose production (EGP). By introduction of 13C
  labeled gluconeogenic precursors such as [U-13C3]propionate (or [U-13C3]lactate),
  the TCA cycle intermediates become labeled, and subsequently, distinct 13C labeling
  patterns are transferred into glucose molecules by means of the gluconeogenic pathway
  (only carbons 1,2,3 of glucose were considered here for simplicity). These isotopomers
  indicate contributions from anaplerotic, cataplerotic and TCA cycle fluxes. Finally,
  infusion of [3,4-13C2]glucose at a known rate followed by measurement of tracer
  dilution allows estimation of endogenous glucose rate of appearance (EndoRa) and
  therefore conversion of relative to absolute fluxes in vivo. This final step is
  unnecessary for ex vivo and in vitro experiments where total glucose output can
  be measured without tracers.
