caption: 'Changes in brain energy metabolism during worker maturation elucidated by
  pathway analysis of data from brain RNA-seq experiments. Gene expression data from
  nurse, forager and scout brains were mapped to citrate cycle pathways compiled by
  the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Genes in the tricarboxylic acid pathway
  (shown) and other energy metabolism pathways were predominantly upregulated in foragers
  and scouts brains relative to nurses. Solid lines indicate the predicted enzymatic
  reactions catalyzed by the product of each gene and dotted lines indicate indirect
  links to other metabolic pathways. ACLY: ATP citrate (pro-S)-lyase; ACO: aconitate
  hydratase; CS: citrate synthase; DLAT: Dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase;DLD:
