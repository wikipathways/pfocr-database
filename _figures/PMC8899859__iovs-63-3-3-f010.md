caption: A proposed model of the Hifα/Pparα signaling axis induced by OSA (A) and
  a flow-chart of changes in lacrimal gland function (B). Chronic intermittent hypoxia
  induces an increase in Hifα expression in lacrimal gland cells. Hifα then translocates
  into the nucleus, combines with Hifβ, and activates downstream genes. Hif can inhibit
  Pparα, which leads to an increased intracellular lipid production via the regulation
  of Fas and a decrease in fatty acid oxidation via the regulation of Cpt1a. Upregulation
  of Cd36 promotes the uptake of lipid in lacrimal gland. In addition, Hifα can activate
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, directly or indirectly through Pparα. Activation of
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, intracellular lipid deposition, and inflammatory cell
  infiltration contribute to inflammation in the lacrimal gland microenvironment.
  Lipid accumulation and inflammation could induce ROS production. Inflammation, lipid
  deposition, ROS, increased lacrimal gland apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction,
  and impaired myoepithelial structure ultimately lead to decreased aqueous tear production.
