caption: 'Altered Hh signalling pathway and mechanism of action of vismodegib and
  sonidegib. Reproduced from ref. following the license terms of CC BY 4.0.(a) In
  absence of ligands, the receptor Patched (PTCH1) inhibits Smoothened (SMO), allowing
  the protein suppressor of fused (SUFU; pathway regulator) to bind and inhibit the
  transcription factors GLI. (b) Altered Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway in basal
  cell carcinoma (BCC): a genetic alteration found in BCC of the receptor PTCH1, which
  prevents inhibition on SMO and allows the activation of downstream signals even
  in the absence of Hh ligands, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. (c) Mechanism
  of action of the inhibitors, vismodegib and sonidegib, which present affinity for
  SMO, blocking the Hh signalling pathway and consequently signal transduction.'
