caption: Pathway model for interleukin (IL)-1α and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced
  inhibition of human skeletal muscle cell (HuSKMC) differentiation. IL-1α and TNF-α
  induced secretion of Activin A in differentiating HuSKMCs cells and this secreted
  Activin A mediated their effects. Release of Activin A was dependent on transforming
  growth factor-β-activated kinase-1/p38/nuclear factor κB pathway activation, but
  independent of SMAD2/3 signaling. The released Activin A subsequently inhibited
  differentiation via ALK/SMAD2/3 signaling.

  levels of Activin A.
