caption: Schematic representation of the role of direct T-cell PPR signaling in the
  mechanism by which intermittent PTH treatment stimulates bone formation. In this
  schema, PPR signaling stimulates T cells to secrete Wnt10b, a Wnt ligand required
  to activate Wnt signaling in stromal cells and osteoblasts. In the presence of T
  cell-produced Wnt10b, stimulation of osteoblastic cells by PTH activates the Wnt
  signaling pathway. This, in turn, leads to increased commitment of mesenchymal stem
  cells to maturing into osteoblasts, increased osteoblast proliferation and differentiation,
  and decreased osteoblast apoptosis or cell death. The resultant increased bone formation
  is followed by an increase in bone mass. OB, osteoblast.
