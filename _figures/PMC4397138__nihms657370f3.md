caption: Regulation of lymphatic muscle contraction occurs primarily through phosphorylation
  of the 20-kDa regulatory myosin light chain (MLC20), which is regulated by the relative
  activities of MLC kinase (MLCK) and MLC phosphatase (MLCP). Increased levels of
  cytosolic Ca2+ presumably initiate lymphatic muscle contraction by binding to the
  universal intracellular Ca2+ receptor protein, calmodulin (CaM). This complex activates
  the catalytic subunit of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). In turn, MLCK phosphorylates
  MLC20, leading to contraction. MLC20 phosphorylation is reversed by MLC phosphatase
  (MLCP) that results in muscle relaxation. Phosphorylation of the MLCP subunit MYPT1
  inactivates it, leading to sustained muscle contraction. Two important signaling
  pathways involved in modulating the Ca2+ sensitivity of the smooth muscle contractile
  apparatus in response to agonist stimulation are Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and
  protein kinase C (PKC). Agonist stimulation activates the G-protein coupled receptors
  that activate the small GTPase RhoA and its downstream effector Rho-kinase (ROCK).
  This pathway, as well as phorbol esters, also activates PKC. Both ROCK and PKC may
  potentially increase MLC20 phosphorylation by activation of MLCP and subsequent
  inhibition of its activity. Application of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 results in a loss
  of tonic contraction. On the other hand, PKC may also directly activate ERK1/2 to
  initiate MLC20 phosphorylation. The PKC inhibitor GF109203x has been shown to abrogate
  this PKC-mediated ERK activation in lymphatic muscle. In a parallel pathway, Substance
  P (SP) binding to neurokinin receptors NK1R and/or NK3R activates ERK1/2. Activation
  of p-ERK increases MLC20 phosphorylation, which is diminished upon inhibition of
  ERK1/2 with PD-98059. SP-mediated downstream signaling is blocked by the neurokinin
  receptor inhibitor NK1R (L703606) and/or NK3R (SB222200). Inhibition of MLCK activity
  by ML-7 decreases levels of phosphorylated forms of MLC20, and leads to a subsequent
  decrease in tonic contraction.
