caption: The mechanism of WTD against angiogenesis in RA. Overview of the underlying
  mechanisms of WTD treatment by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Activation of
  PI3K by receptor tyrosine kinases promotes cell growth, proliferation, migration
  and invasion as well as angiogenesis. PI3K signaling can activate and phosphorylate
  AKT, and p-AKT can inhibit the expression of apoptosis-related genes to allow the
  cells to survive while promoting the expression of genes related to cell proliferation,
  migration, and invasion. More importantly, p-AKT can activate mTOR to upregulate
  the expression of HIF1α. HIF-1α is stabilized under hypoxic conditions and quickly
  translocated to the nucleus, where it facilitates the expression of the associated
  genes VEGF and ANGI). However, VEGF and ANGI can bind corresponding homologous receptors
  coupled to endothelial cells to promote synovial angiogenesis. PI3K, Phosphatidylinositide
  3-kinases; AKT, protein kinase B; mTOR, Mammalian target of rapamycin; HIF-1α, Hypoxia-induced
  factor 1α; VEGF, Vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR2, Vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor 2; ANG1, Angiopoietin 1; TEK, Angiopoietin-1 receptor.
