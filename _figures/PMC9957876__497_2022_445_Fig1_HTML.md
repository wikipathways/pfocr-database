caption: Model of meiotic recombination/DNA repair pathways in plants. Meiosis begins
  with the assembly of a proteinaceous axis (incorporating ASY1 and ASY3), which forms
  the base of chromatin loops, and the programmed induction of DNA double-strand breaks
  by SPO11-1, SPO11-2 and MTOPVIB. Following DSB induction, DNA ends are resected,
  and the single-stranded overhangs bound by DMC1 and RAD51 to mediate inter-homologue
  strand-invasion/D-loop formation. These joint molecules are then processed by numerous
  parallel pathways to be resolved as crossovers or non-crossovers. DSBs can also
  be repaired without inter-homologue invasion via the sister chromatid. While hundreds
  of DSBs are induced at the beginning of meiosis, only a small percentage become
  crossovers. Many recombination intermediates initially enter the class I (ZMM) crossover
  pathway and have early association with ZMM proteins including HEI10. However, most
  intermediates exit this pathway and lose their association with HEI10 (HEI10 coarsening)
  so that by late pachytene, only the few intermediates destined to become class I
  crossovers remain. These class I crossovers account for ~ 70–90% of crossovers in
  plants. Joint-molecules/recombination intermediates not destined to become class
  I crossovers have several potential fates. Helicases (FANCM, RECQ4) and associated
  proteins disassemble recombination intermediates and promote non-crossover formation
  via synthesis dependent strand annealing (SDSA) or double Holiday junction (dHJ)
  dissolution. Other intermediates may be resolved as class II crossovers via partially
  redundant pathways involving MUS81 and FANCD2. This model is based on that described
  in (Mercier et al. ), incorporating data from (Morgan et al. ).
