caption: Hippo Pathway for tumor suppression. Inactivation of YAP/TAZ leads to oncogenic
  transcriptional module. Its inactivation is due to activation of hippo kinases MST1/2
  that facilitates activation of LATS1/2 thereby phosporylating and retaining YAP/TAZ
  in the cytoplasm via 14–3-3 or being subjected to proteasomal or autophagy-induced
  degradation. Followed by this, suppression of TEAD-mediated gene transcription occurs.
  On the other hand, inactivation of hippo kinases occurs due to myriad reasons. Inactivation
  of hippo kinases leads to dephosphorylation of YAP/TAZ and translocates inside the
  nucleus inducing TEAD target gene expression. However, recent studies highlight
  Hippo-YAP-independent activation of TEAD too.,.
