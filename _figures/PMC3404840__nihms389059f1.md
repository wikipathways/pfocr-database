caption: 'HIV-1 Nef promotes viral replication and viral survival by hijacking host
  cell machinery to achieve immune evasion and anti-apoptosis.(A) HIV infection activates
  the two main pathways of cell death in lymphocytes: activation-induced cell death
  through the TNF family of death receptors; and activated T-cell autonomous death
  through Bcl-2-related proteins and mitochondria. Host apoptosis signals – ‘inside
  in’ (HIV replication initiating viral particle attack) and ‘outside in’ (FasL–Fas
  and membrane-bound TNF-α–TNFR2 ligations) – cause cell death before the viral lifecycle
  is completed. Both forms of apoptosis signaling are blocked by Nef, and in addition,
  Nef controls cell death in the host by phosphorylation of p53 and by promoting the
  upregulation of FasL and the downregulation of MHC class I (not shown) that forces
  the cytotoxic T lymphocyte into an apoptotic pathway and prevents the recognition
  of Nef-infected cells.(B) Activation of the TCR cascade by Nef requires a costimulus
  activation signal (through dendritic cells) to initiate a signal strong enough to
  stimulate viral replication.P: Phosphate; TCR: T-cell receptor.'
