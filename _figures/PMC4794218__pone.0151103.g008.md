caption: Putative metabolic pathways were inferred from changes in the intermediates
  levels in the liver of the G6PDx-FB mice. Red indicates the significantly elevated
  metabolites relative to those in the controls. Green shows significantly reduced
  metabolites relative to those in the controls.
