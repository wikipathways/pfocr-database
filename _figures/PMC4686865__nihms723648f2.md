caption: '[18F]FDG is a glucose analog with 18F-fluorine replacing the oxygen in the
  C-2 position. [18F]FDG is actively transported into the cytosol by the glucose transporters
  (GLUTs), which are overexpressed in pathological conditions such as cell transformation
  and inflammation. [18F]FDG can then be phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) to form
  [18F]FDG-6-P, but cannot continue further the glycolytic pathway since the 18F substitution
  prevents the formation of [18F]Fructose-6-P by phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). Specifically
  the scheme demonstrates the inability of the 18F substituted cis-Enediolate intermediate
  to form a ring closure and thus the phosphorylated furanose ring.'
