caption: Crosstalk between Wnt, Notch, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Wnt signaling
  activates Ngn1, which then binds p300/CBP coactivator proteins to promote neuronal
  differentiation. Ngn1 competes with STAT3 to inhibit gliogenesis during neurogenic
  phases. During gliogenesis, the STAT3 transcription factor is activated through
  phosphorylation by JAKs. The active form of STAT3 binds the p300/CBP coactivator
  proteins and promotes gliogenesis. Notch signaling activates gliogenic genes; HES
  inhibits neurogenesis via inhibition of proneural genes. At the same time, RBP-Jκ
  is also activated to promote gliogenesis. RBP-Jκ binds a repressive cofactor protein,
  termed nuclear receptor corepressor, to suppress gliogenic genes and inhibit glial
  cell differentiation when the JAK-STAT pathway is not activated.
