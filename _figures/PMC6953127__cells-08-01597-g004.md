caption: Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) structure and function
  AMPK are heterotrimeric proteins comprising a catalytic subunit (α subunit) and
  two regulatory subunits (β subunit and γ subunit), the domain composition of each
  subunit being shown. Thr172 is a key site for the activation of AMPK. The upstream
  kinases LKB1 and CAMKK2 are activated by various metabolic stresses and intracellular
  calcium, respectively. Activation of LKB1 and CAMKK2 activates AMPK by phosphorylation
  of Thr172. As an energy-sensing kinase, once activated, AMPK inhibits the energy-consuming
  synthesis process (that is, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumption), such as the
  biosynthesis of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, while simultaneously activating
  the energy-producing process (that is, ATP production), such as glucose metabolism
  and autophagy to maintain the balance of energy.
