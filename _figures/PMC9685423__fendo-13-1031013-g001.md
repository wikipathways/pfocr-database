caption: Proposed metabolism of cholesterol to the C27 bile acid 3β,20R,22R-triH-Δ24-CA
  (green background). For comparison the acidic pathway to the C27 bile acid 3β,7α-diH-Δ24-CA
  is shown (blue background) as is the pathway to progesterone (yellow background).
  Enzymes are indicated in blue. When shown in bold the enzymatic reactions can be
  found in the literature, when shown in normal typeface and with a broken arrow they
  are postulated. Cholesterol is shown in red with full stereochemistry and numbering
  system on a salmon background. For simplicity the 3β,20R,22R-triH-Δ24-CA and 3β,7α-diH-Δ24-CA
  are shown as the acids rather than the CoA-thioester products of SLC27A5 (bile acid
  CoA ligase). 20S-HC is shown on an orange background, although the enzyme responsible
  for its formation is unproven, it can be converted to 20R,22R-diHC by CYP11A1. Note
  the stereochemistry of metabolites down-stream of 20R,22R-diHC towards and including
  3β,20R,22R-triH-Δ24-CA are assumed based on biosynthetic considerations.
