caption: 'Rationale of kinase inhibitors and ICI combined therapies. (A) VEGF produced
  by tumor cells and immune cells creates a tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive
  environment by impeding DC maturation and T cell infiltration, increasing the recruitment
  of Tregs, TAMs, and MDSCs. KIs exert immunological effects by either blocking VEFG
  pathway or depleting/reprogramming the immunosuppressive cells directly. (B) ICI
  are antibodies against inhibitory pathways that block effective antitumor T cell
  response, including the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and CTLA-4. The rationale of the combined
  therapy is predicated on relief of immunosuppression within TME by KIs and re-activating
  T cell response by ICI. Abbreviations: CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
  protein 4; ICI, immune checkpoint inhibitors; KIs, kinase inhibitors; MDSCs, myeloid
  derived suppressor cells; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1; PD-L1, programmed
  death-ligand 1; TAM, tumor-associated macrophages; Tregs, regulatory T cells. Created
