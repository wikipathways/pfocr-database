caption: Effects of social rank on blood cell gene expression and regulation vary
  by species and treatment according to two new studies in PNAS (, ). (A) The Toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR4) is activated by bacterial LPS, which induces a MyD88-dependent
  proinflammatory pathway and a Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing
  IFN-β (TRIF)-dependent antiviral pathway. Also shown is the GC hormone-induced GC
  receptor (GR) pathway to highlight interactions across LPS and GC treatment. Social
  rank-mediated effects on gene expression in response to LPS are represented for
  female macaques and male baboons, while rank-mediated effects on chromatin accessibility
  are represented for female macaques. (B) Overview of the relative scale of rank-mediated
  differences in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in female macaques in
  response to LPS and GC (Dex) treatment. IRF, interferon regulatory factor.
