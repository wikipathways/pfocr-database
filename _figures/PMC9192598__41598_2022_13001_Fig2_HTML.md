caption: Potential biological signaling networks involved with PM-induced skin diseases
  predicted from the public data-based analysis. Direct biological interaction among
  the identified genes related to PM-induced skin diseases. (a) Biological functions
  of the genes predicted to be altered by signaling networks were analyzed using Pathway
  Studio. The predicted functions are presented as a “functional class” in the pathway.
  (b) Cellular processes predicted to be affected by signaling networks among the
  identified genes were analyzed using Pathway Studio. The descriptions of the schematic
  symbols are located to the left of each figure.
