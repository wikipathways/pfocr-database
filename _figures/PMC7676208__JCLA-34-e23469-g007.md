caption: The potential mechanisms of inflammation by COLEC12 mediated through TLR4
  in osteosarcoma. COLEC12 could reduce TLR4 expression, weaken NF‐κB and C3 signaling
  pathway to release inflammatory factors downstream, restrain immune defense to tumor
  cells, inhibit apoptosis of tumor cells, and cut down lives of mouses
