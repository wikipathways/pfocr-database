caption: Schematic stages of the autophagic pathway. The process of autophagy progresses
  through several stages, including initiation, elongation, maturation, and degradation.
  Several stimuli are implicated in activation and inhibition of autophagy where the
  negative autophagic regulator; MTOR, is directly involved. Inhibition of MTOR, e.g.,
  through nutrient starvation, rapamycin, or activation of AMP-activated protein kinase
  (AMPK) in energy-depleting conditions promotes autophagy. Activated AMPK inhibits
  also the MTOR downstream protein complex; the autophagic protein ULK1, which interacts
  with ATG13, ATG101 and RB1CC1. Conversely, nutrient-rich conditions deactivate MTOR
  and thereby suppress autophagy. Additionally, induction of the PI3K-AKT pathway
  by growth factors inhibits autophagy by activating MTOR and suppressing the BECN1-containing
  class III PtdIns3K complex. Activation of the ULK1 complex results in the translocation
  of the BECN1 complex to the assembly site of a phagophore and generates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate
  (PtdIns3P), which is involved in recruiting a number of ATG proteins. The BECN1
  complex is activated by ATG14, SH3GLB1, UVRAG, and AMBRA1, and is suppressed by
  KIAA0226/Rubicon or BCL2. Elongation of the phagophore requires 2 ubiquitin-like
  conjugation systems, the ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1 conjugation system and the microtubule-associated
  protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) conjugation system. These conjugation systems require
  participation a range of proteases and ligases such as ATG3, ATG4B, ATG7, and ATG10
  to trigger oligomerization on the outside of the membrane of the growing autophagosome.
  ATG9 and/or ATG16L1-positive vesicles are involved in membrane trafficking and formation
  of these autophagosomes. Under conditions of autophagosomal maturation, the ATG
  proteins are released back into the cytosol, and the final stages of autophagy can
  then be initiated by autophagosome-lysosome fusion using, for example, interaction
  between STX17, as an autophagosomal SNARE and its partners SNAP29 and VAMP8.
