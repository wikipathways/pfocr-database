caption: Model of the signaling pathway by which FSH, via PKA, regulates the PI3K
  and ERK pathways in GCs. The results presented here support the contributions of
  constitutively active pathway components upstream of ERK, the ability of MKP3(DUSP6)
  to dephosphorylate MEK-phosphorylated ERK in the absence of FSH, and the ability
  of FSH, in a PKA-dependent manner, to inhibit the phosphatase activity of the likely
  ERK DUSP, MKP3. The ability of ERK to promote phosphorylation/activation of the
  transcriptional factor YB1 is based on a prior publication (). The ability of PKA
  to sensitize IRS1 to the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin-like growth factor
  1 receptor (IGF1R) is also based on prior publications (, ).
