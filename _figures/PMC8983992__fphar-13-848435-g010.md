caption: 'Ideograph of AKEX0011’s therapeutic effects. AKEX0011 alleviated the inflammatory
  and fibrotic reactions of silicosis through the following mechanisms (A) Apoptosis:
  AKEX0011 reduced silica-induced apoptosis and alleviated the inflammatory cascade
  caused by apoptosis, which ultimately reduced the extent of silicosis. (B) ASK1-p38
  MAPK signaling pathway: silica can induce inflammation and fibrosis by activation
  of the ASK1-p38 MAPK signaling pathway. AKEX0011 ameliorated inflammation and fibrosis
  by inhibition of the activation of the p38 signaling pathway. (C) Macrophage polarization:
  In the pathophysiology of silicosis, the macrophage polarization disorder occupies
  an important position. AKEX0011 reduced macrophage polarization through suppressing
  NF-κB and PPAR-γ pathways.'
