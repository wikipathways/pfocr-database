caption: 'Mechanisms of coagulopathy in APL. (A) Physiologic mechanisms of coagulation
  and anticoagulation. Tissue factor (TF) released by trauma to the vascular wall
  activates factor VII. Small amounts of activated factor VII (VIIa) activates factor
  X which in turn activates factor V. Activated factor X (Xa) together with activated
  factor V (Va) cleaves and activates prothrombin to thrombin (IIa). Only small amounts
  of thrombin are generally produced via this mechanism. These levels are insufficient
  to form a robust fibrin clot but can activate platelets, factor VIII, factor X,
  and factor V resulting in generation of clinically significant amounts of IIa on
  the surface of activated platelets. High levels of IIa are now sufficient to cleave
  fibrinogen to fibrin and thus, stabilize the clot. During normal hemostasis, clot
  formation is restricted to the place of endothelial damage via: (i) mechanisms dependent
  on endothelial cell expression of thrombomodulin (Th - binds and inactivates IIa)
  and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR – binds and activates protein C, which
  together with protein S inactivates IIa, Va, and VIIIa); (ii) antithrombin III (ATIII
  – binds and inactivates IIa) and (iii) fibrinolysis pathway that results in generation
  of plasmin from plasminogen. tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; uPA, urine plasminogen
  activator; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; TAFI, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis
  inhibitor. (B) Mechanisms by which the coagulation pathways are dysregulated in
  patients with APL. Malignant promyelocytes produce excessive amounts of TF, cytokines
  (i.e., IL1β, TNFα) and cancer procoagulant leading to unrestricted generation of
  massive amounts of IIa and consumptive coagulopathy. In addition, APL promyeloblasts
  express high levels of Annexin II, a receptor and activator of tPA/uPA resulting
  in uncontrolled generation of plasmin and hyperfibrinolysis. (C) Mechanistic impact
  of therapeutic interventions routinely used in APL. Standard of care recommendations
  are depicted with red highlighting, text and bars (platelets, fibrinogen, or fresh
  frozen plasma and ATRA). Of note, ATRA can rapidly (within minutes) decrease expression
  of Annexin II and thus, ameliorate hyperfibrinolysis. In yellow boxes are proposed
  interventions that are not currently recommended as routine but that may positively
  influence the coagulopathy of some patients with APL. Green bars depict suggested
  mechanisms of action of these proposed interventions. Recombinant VIIa has been
  used in patients with life threatening intracranial bleeding; low dose heparin not
  only decreases consumption of coagulation factors by blocking IIa but also alleviates
  endothelial damage; fibrinolysis inhibitors (tranexamic acid and ε-aminocaproic
  acid) can mitigate hyperfibrinolysis and excessive fibrinogen consumption. Most
  exciting is the potential use of recombinant human thrombomodulin (rhTh) to not
  only balance IIa activity but also palliate some of the cytokine dependent endothelial
  damage. While these interventions may have a role to play in management of coagulopathy
  in APL, further clinical trial data are needed before making firm recommendations.'
