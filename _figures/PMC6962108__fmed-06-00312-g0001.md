caption: Mechano-sensing by LSECs drives fibrotic processes. LSECs can respond to
  changes in shear stress and pressure in the sinusoid through activation of PIEZO
  channels. Data by Hilscher et al. () suggests this is triggered by integrins and
  myosin filaments. PIEZO channel activation drives cleavage of Notch to release NICD,
  and transcription of Notch pathway genes HES1 and HEY1. Activation of this mechanism
  results in chemokine secretion (CXCL1) which recruits neutrophils (a). Signaling
  by LSECs is also known to trigger HSC activation (b) which leads to stiffening of
  the ECM, potentially driving activation of other mechano-sensitive pathways (c)
  such as YAP1.
