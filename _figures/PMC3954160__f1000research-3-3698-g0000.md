caption: ( a) KEGGViewer rendering of the insulin signaling pathway. Pathway components
  can be manually repositioned. Genes and pathways are represented as green and blue
  boxes respectively while purple dots represent chemical compounds. Relationships
  represent reactions e.g. activation, inhibtion or phosphorilation. ( b) Zoomed view
  of the insulin signaling pathway. Condition 1 is selected in the control panel (top
  right) and the expression range is set to consider expression levels between -0.43
  and 0.43 to be non differentially expressed. Genes PPP1CA and PYGB in red are upregulated
  while GYS1 in blue is downregulated. GSK3B and CALML6 in green are non differentially
  expressed genes. The purple dot C00369 represents Starch.
