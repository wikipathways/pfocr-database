caption: Numerous signaling pathways are constitutively activated and/or deregulated
  in MCL, including BCR, BAFF-R, mTOR, WNT, and NOTCH1 signaling as well as pathways
  that promote the cell cycle and inhibit apoptosis. mTOR and proteasome inhibitors
  are the only two pathways for which specific drugs have been approved. Several small
  molecules targeting the BCR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at different levels (indicated
  by white text) are currently being studied in clinical trials. Other clinical trials
  are using small molecules to target the BCL2 family proteins directly involved in
  apoptosis and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) directly involved in the progression
  through G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. The WNT and NOTCH1 pathways are
  potential targets for β-catenin (β-cat) inhibitors and NOTCH1 inhibitors, respectively.
  Pharmacologic inhibition of PARP activity has become an interesting therapeutic
  strategy in tumors with dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms, such as MCL.
