caption: NFκB pathway (left). Proinflammatory stimuli, such as LPS, facilitate the
  phosphorylation of IκB and result in the recognition of P-IκB by the Cullin-1-Nedd8-Skp-βTRCP
  complex, culminating in its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The
  rate-limiting step for this is the conjugation of NEDD8 to Cullin-1. Neddylation
  is achieved through a multi-enzyme process, wherein SENP8 enables cleavage of the
  NEDD8-precursor and promotes NEDD8 conjugation to the Cullins. Loss of SENP8, or
  pharmacological inhibition of NEDD8 conjugation by MLN4924, prevents activation
  of Cullin-1 and thus prevents liberation of NFκB from IκB, resulting in quenched
  pro-inflammatory signaling. HIFα pathway (right). In contrast to NFκB, HIFα in its
  hydroxylated form is degraded by the proteasome after ubiquitination through the
  von Hippel Lindau protein (pVHL). pVHL in its activated form contains neddylated
  Cullin-2, thereby controlling cellular HIFα levels. Use of MLN4924 prevents Cullin-2
  neddylation, and as shown in this study leads to higher levels of the hydroxylated
  HIFα isoform.
