caption: Formation and function of novel regulatory apocarotenoids. (A) β-Cyclocitral
  can be produced through cleavage of all-trans-β-carotene at the (C7′–C8′) double
  bound, which is catalyzed by CtCCD4b or 1O2 attack. Very recently, it was also shown
  that lipoxygenases, e.g. the tomato TomLoxC and the Arabidopsis LOX, can mediate
  the formation of this volatile, which acts as a growth regulator of roots and is
  involved in high light acclimation. (B) Anchorene, which can be formed by cleaving
  the (C11–C12) and (C11′–C12′) double bounds in all carotenoids downstream ζ-carotene
  in the carotenoid pathway, stimulates ANRs formation in Arabidopsis seedlings. (C)
  The recently discovered zaxinone is synthesized from all-trans-zeaxanthin (or all-trans-lutein)
  via the intermediate apo-10′-zeaxanthinal (not shown). The latter is the substrate
  of Zaxinone synthase (ZAS) that mediates the cleavage of the (C13–C14) double bond.
  Zaxinone is required for normal rice growth and development and is a negative regulator
  of SL biosynthesis. Created with ‘Biorender’.
