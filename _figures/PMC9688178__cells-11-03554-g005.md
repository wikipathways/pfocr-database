caption: 'The signaling pathways regulating T cells in metabolic diseases. PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway promotes the differentiation of CD4+T cells. mTOR signaling pathway
  takes part in the development of thymus and T cells and the exhaustion of CD8+T
  cells. PI3K/Akt/FOXO suppresses the development of Tregs and promotes the expression
  of cytotoxicity effector. AMPK signaling pathway negatively regulates Th17 differentiation,
  glucose uptake, mitochondria function, and CD8+T cell differentiation, whereas the
  pathway positively regulates Treg cells’ differentiation. These pathways could regulate
  the ratio of Treg to Th17 together. The decrease in the ratio leads to AT inflammation,
  insulin resistance, NAFLD, and gout. PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Akt: protein
  kinase B; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; AMPK: Adenosine 5‘-monophosphate
  (AMP)-activated protein kinase; NAFLD: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The figure
