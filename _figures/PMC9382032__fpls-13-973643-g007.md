caption: Mapping of the most significantly enriched KEGG pathways of the four sets
  of specifically expressed genes. (A) Expression patterns of the genes that are specifically
  expressed the stems of the iSAS samples (iSAS-stem) that are involved in the significantly
  enriched pathway “proteasome.” (B) Expression patterns of the genes that are specifically
  expressed in the roots of the iSAS samples (iSAS-root) that are involved in the
  significantly enriched pathway “plant hormone transduction.” (C) Expression patterns
  of the genes that are specifically expressed in the stems of the strong-SAS samples
  (sSAS-stem) and that are involved in the significantly enriched pathway “aminoacyl-tRNA
  biosynthesis.” (D) Expression patterns of the genes that are specifically expressed
  in the roots of the strong-SAS samples (sSAS-root) and that are involved in the
  significantly enriched pathway “ribosome.”
