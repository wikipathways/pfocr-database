caption: TNFR1 signalling. Binding of TNF to TNFR1 results in the formation of complex
  I which consists of the membrane-bound adaptor molecules TNFR1-TRADD-RIPK1-TRAF2
  or TRAF5 that associate with the E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2, which add
  K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to RIPK1 and other components of the signalling
  complex. This results in recruitment of linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex
  (LUBAC), which adds M1-linked linear polyubiquitin chains to RIPK1. Subsequently,
  via activation of TAK1, the Jun/p38 signalling pathways as well as the IKK complex,
  consisting of IKKα, IKKβ, and the regulatory subunit NEMO, are activated. IKK phosphorylates
  the inhibitor of NFκB, IκB, which is then degraded following K48 polyubiquitination,
  giving rise to activated NFκB and its translocation into the nucleus. By binding
  to specific promoter regions of cytokine and chemokine genes, but also for genes
  of anti-apoptotic, cytoprotective proteins (see text for details), NFκB mediates
  either inflammation or cell survival. Upon recruitment of FADD to TRADD, the death-inducing
  signalling complex (complex II) is formed, which in turn recruits pro-caspase 8
  to finally execute the proapoptotic downstream pathway of TNFR1. In hepatocytes,
  TNF-induced apoptosis requires the activation of the mitochondrial pathway that
  involves cleavage of BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (Bid) to truncated Bid
  (tBid), activation of Bax, formation of mitochondrial permeability transition pores,
  release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and finally activation of caspase
  9 and caspase 3. Alternatively, in the presence of phosphorylated RIPK1, RIPK3 can
  be recruited into the complex which in turn phosphorylates MLKL to induce necroptosis.
  Necroptotic cell death is caspase-independent and represents a pro-inflammatory
  form of cell death
