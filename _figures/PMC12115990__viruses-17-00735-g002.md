caption: Biological functions of TRIM25 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer cell survival.
  (A) SARS-CoV-2 proteins participate in viral immune evasion by interfering with
  antiviral signaling. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA can activate TRIM25 and RIG-I for the
  subsequent aggregation of MAVS, which regulate IRF3/7 and IFN production. The IFNs
  produced bind to a type I IFN receptor to activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway,
  leading to the production of ISGs. Both the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP)
  and ORF6 proteins influence the nuclear translocation of IRF3/7 and STAT. The NP
  recruits G3BP2 and TRIM25, while ORF6 mediates TRIM25 degradation, limiting TRIM25-mediated
  RIG-I ubiquitination. (B) TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination regulates multiple biological
  pathways. (Ba) TRIM25 can lead to the degradation of Keap1, resulting in the nuclear
  translocation of Nrf2 and the production of antioxidant proteins. (Bb) 14-3-3σ can
  be degraded by TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination, which contributes to the degradation
  of Mdm2 and p53. (Bc) The inhibitory effect of GPX4 on ferroptosis is negated by
  the participation of TRIM25 in the treatment of N6F11. (Bd) Neddylated TRIM25 can
  induce the nuclear translocation of TEFB, which is responsible for the transcription
  of autophagy-related genes. (This figure was created using BioRender. Liu, Q.X.
