caption: Crucial environmental factors associated with NK cell function in the TME
  of breast cancer. a) Hypoxia modulates epigenetics through the HDAC1/PRC2 axis,
  thereby influencing the NF-κB and STAT signaling pathways. Hypoxia regulates IFN-γ
  secretion in NK cells. Furthermore, HIF-1α-induced autophagy promotes the degradation
  of GZMB. b) Glucose, as the primary energy source for NK cells, is critical for
  the function of these cells. The upregulation of GLUT1/2/3 and TNFα-TNFR2 signaling
  facilitates glucose uptake, promoting glycolysis and enhancing the antitumor activity
  of NK cells. c) Lactate production in the TME is tightly coupled with LDHB activity.
  MCT4 mediates lactate export from tumor cells, whereas MCT1 can reverse the acidic
  microenvironment. This modulation ultimately augments NKp46 expression and NK cell
  functionality. d) The hypoxic microenvironment, glycolytic metabolism of tumor cells,
  and excretion of lactate within breast cancer tumors considerably affect the mitochondrial
  homeostasis of NK cells. This disruption leads to mitochondrial shrinkage and fragmentation,
  compromising the antitumor efficacy of NK cells
