caption: Schematic illustration of the intermittent high-glucose-dependent induction
  of H3K4me3 promoting Notch signaling-dependent acquisition of mesenchymal character
  of endothelial cells. In normal endothelial cells, H3K4me3 levels remain to be minimal
  and the expression of Notch-associated ligands Jagged1 and Jagged2, including the
  activation of Notch pathway is very limited, thereby maintaining endothelial phenotype.
  Upon intermittent high-glucose challenge, endothelial cells exhibit a heightened
  level of H3K4me3 contributed by an increase in SET1/COMPASS proteins MLL2 and WDR82.
  Elevated H3K4me3 consequently enriches on the promoter region of Notch ligands Jagged1
  and Jagged2, thereby causing their expression, which in turn causes Notch activation.
  Such hyperactivation of Notch signaling supports the acquisition of mesenchymal
  character in endothelial cells. Interplaying with MLL through small molecule inhibitors
  or by siRNA-dependent knockdown caused reversal of intermittent high-glucose dependent
  Notch activation and concurrent inhibition of acquiring mesenchymal character by
  endothelial cells.
