caption: Immune response pathway against MERS-CoV infection. Macrophages present virus
  antigens to a naive T cell. This process is followed by the activation of T cells.
  Differentiation induces the production of cytokines specific to the different T
  cell subsets (Th1, Th2), resulting in the massive production of cytokines. Due to
  natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cell (CD8 T cell) activation, these cells
  produce effective mediators, such as IFNγ and granzyme, to clear a viral infection.
