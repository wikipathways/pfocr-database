caption: The nuclear effects of DRD1/PKA pathway and reactive species on postsynaptic
  neurons. The noncanonical DRD1 activation induced by METH produces an overactivation
  of several kinases, such as ERK1/2, DARPP-32-pT34, CREB, CDK5, and CaMKII. The latter,
  together with DA- and GLUT-derived reactive species, is shuttled into the nuclear
  compartment where they carry posttranslational modifications of histones and TFs.
  These events promote both a relaxation of chromatin structure (yielded by an increase
  of histone acetyltransferases (HAT)/decrease of histone deacetylases (HDAC)) and
  increased binding of TFs (such as Elk-1, AP-1, and CREB) at the level of their target
  gene sequences. These metabolic events eventually translate into an increase expression
  of IEGs.
