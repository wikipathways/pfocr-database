caption: Regulation of connexin- and pannexin-based channels by cytokines released
  from activated microglia. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) stimulate the receptor for age (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) receptors
  (1), respectively, resulting in activation of the nuclear factor-κβ; (NF-κβ) pathway
  (2). This pathway induces the autocrine/paracrine release of tumor necrosis factor-α;
  (TNF-α), which acts upon its receptor TNFR1 (3) and leads to the activation of glutaminase
  and the further release of glutamate through Cx32 HCs (4). In parallel, NF-κβ signaling
  promotes the autocrine/paracrine release of interleukin-1β; (IL-1β), which acts
  upon its receptor as well as accessory proteins (IL1RI and IL1RAcP; 5) and leads
  to the release of ATP through Cx43 HCs and Panx1 channels (CHs) via an unknown mechanism
  (6). Additionally, IL-1β signaling favors the opening of GJCs composed of Cx43.
