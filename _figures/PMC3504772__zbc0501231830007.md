caption: A proposed mechanism for the spatiotemporal regulation of Rabex-5 in the
  endocytic trafficking of ubiquitinated L1. M, motif-interacting with Ub; Z, ZnF.
  Step 1, Src kinase is involved in the phosphorylation of a tyrosine-based motif,
  thereby regulating recruitment of the AP-2 protein. However, the dephosphorylation
  of this motif upon L1-L1 homophilic interactions results in the recruitment of AP-2,
  causing the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1 from the plasma membrane. The dephosphorylation
  of L1 also triggers the recruitment of an unidentified E3-ligase to ubiquitinate
  L1 on the plasma membrane. Step 2, the coupled monoubiquitination of Rabex-5, presumably
  in a switched off state, in which the MIU domain interacts with the mono-Ub moiety
  in cis, undergoes deubiquitination by an unidentified deubiquitinase upon L1 ligand
  stimulation, which might cause a Ca2+ influx. Then, monoubiquitinated Rabex-5 undergoes
  deubiquitination, converting Rabex-5 to a switched on state in which the MIU domain
  is positioned for trans interactions. Step 3, the interaction of ubiquitinated L1
  with Rabex-5 recruits Rab5, which in turn triggers the endocytosis of ubiquitinated
  L1 from the plasma membrane. Next, the ubiquitinated L1·Rabex-5·GDP-Rab5 complex
  in an endocytic vesicle is transported to the endosomal membrane. Step 4, Rabex-5
  turns on the GEF activity of the HB-VPS9 tandem domain by recruiting Rabaptin-5
  to endosomes. Step 5, the conversion of GDP-Rab5 to GTP-Rab5 catalyzed by the GEF
  domain releases the Rabex-5·GTP-Rab5·Rabaptin-5 complex from the ubiquitinated L1
  on the endosomes. Releasing the ubiquitinated L1 from the MIU domain allows this
  domain to interact with the mono-Ub moiety in cis and to return to the coupled monoubiquitinated
  Rabex-5 for another cycle.
