caption: In the canonical NF‐κB signalling pathway, the NEMO complex composed of Iκκɑ/
  Iκκβ /Iκκ phosphorylates IκB, which leads to its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal
  degradation. P65/p50 transcription factors are released to activate the transcription
  of target genes. In the non‐canonical NF‐κB signalling pathway, NIK is activated
  and phosphorylates Iκκ, p100 is phosphorylated and processed into p52, which binds
  RelB transcription factors and translocates into the nucleus to activate the expression
  of specific genes. Canonical and non‐canonical NF‐κB signalling pathways together
  mediate cellular inflammation and immune responses. Created with MedPeer (medpeer.cn)
