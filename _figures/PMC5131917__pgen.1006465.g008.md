caption: (A) Targeting of SDE2 to PCNA-associated replication forks via the N-terminal
  UBL containing a PIP box leads to the cleavage of SDE2 at the diglycine motif. DUB
  activity is required for its cleavage. (B) The cleaved C-terminal SDE2 functions
  as a negative regulator of damage-inducible RAD18-dependent PCNA monoubiquitination.
  The SDE2 domain is required for this process. (C) Degradation of the cleaved N-terminal
  and C-terminal SDE2 products by CRL4CDT2 allows timely S phase progression and promotes
  replication stress response, at least partly through PCNA-Ub-dependent lesion bypass,
  to ensure genome stability. Deregulation of SDE2 levels, either by knockdown or
  by defective proteolysis, disrupts this genome maintenance pathway.
