caption: 'In the absence of IFN (left), constitutively internalized IFNAR1 and IFNAR2
  subunits may recycle from the sorting endosome to the PM. While the mechanism is
  unknown for IFNAR2, IFNAR1 is sorted back to the PM through its interaction with
  the endosomal sorting nexin (SNX)-BAR sorting complex for promoting exit 1 (ESCPE-1).
  ESCPE-1 complex (top right inset) is composed of SNX heterodimers formed by SNX1
  or SNX2 that are associated with SNX5 or SNX6. Whether IFNAR1 transits through the
  trans-Golgi Network during its recycling to the PM has not been investigated yet.
  Upon IFN stimulation (right), the IFN-bound receptor complex is endocytosed via
  clathrin-coated pits. Upon arrival to the sorting endosome, IFNAR receptor complex
  is dissociated: 1) IFNAR1 is addressed to the lysosomal degradative pathway, first
  through multivesicular bodies, then in lysosomes where it is fully degraded, and
  2) IFNAR2 interacts with the endosomal retromer complex which controls its recycling
  to the PM. The retromer (bottom right inset) is formed by the cargo-selective-complex
  (CSC), a trimer composed of vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 35 (VPS35)-VPS29-VPS26
  proteins, associated with the nexin SNX3 and the small GTPase Rab 7.'
