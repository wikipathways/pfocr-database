caption: MicroRNA biogenesis and mechanism of action [composed from Ref. (–)]. 1.
  MicroRNA genes can be found as independent transcriptional units, or embedded within
  introns, and occasionally exons of other genes. In the canonical pathway, microRNA
  are transcribed as long primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase
  II (and occasionally RNA polymerase III). Pri-miRNAs can be several kilobases long
  and can contain the stem loops of several mature miRNAs (giving rise to miRNA clusters—see
  Box ). In the non-canonical pathway, miRNA precursors lie in mRNA introns (“miRtrons”).
  2. Pri-miRNAs are processed by the nuclear protein DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical
  8 region) and the enzyme DROSHA into hair pin shaped structures called pre-miRNA
  transcripts. In the non-canonical pathway, miRNA precursors in mRNA introns are
  spliced out and bypass DGCR8/DROSHA. 3. Pre-miRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm
  by exportin-5. 4. The enzyme DICER cleaves the pre-miRNA hairpin loop to produce
  a mature miRNA duplex. 5. One strand of the miRNA duplex (the guide strand) associates
  with Argonaut (AGO) protein in the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). The remaining
  strand (termed the passenger strand) is degraded. In most cases, there is a preference
  for which strand is incorporated due to factors like thermodynamic stability. 6.
  The mature single-stranded miRNA in the miR-RISC complex binds to complementary
  sequences in the 3′ untranslated region of mRNA molecule, preventing translation.
  Bound mRNA may be degraded or stored for translation later (). Bound mRNA may be
  sequestered into processing bodies (p-bodies) possibly for later release ().
