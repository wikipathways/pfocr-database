caption: 'Figure 3. A model of acute regulation of AMPK by radiation. Ionizing radiation
  causes DNA damage leading to increased ATM phosphorylation, which leads to enhanced
  expression of the γH2AX marker. ATM leads to phosphorylation and activation of AMPK
  and its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Ionizing radiation leads
  to AMPK-dependent checkpoint, associated with expression of the cycling-depended
  kinase inhibitor p21cip1 and a G2-M cell cycle arrest. Immunofluorescence microscopy
  images were obtained from untreated or radiated (1 h post irradiation) A549 cells,
  which were fixed and stained with Hoechst (blue), an antibody that detects phosphorylated
  AMPKα on its Thr172 residue (green, 1:00 dilution, Cell Signaling), as well as phosphorylated
  H2AX (γH2Ax) (red, 1:200 dilution, Cell Signaling). Abbreviations: ATM, ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase.'
