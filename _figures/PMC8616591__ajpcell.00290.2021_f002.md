caption: 'The potential role of GPC1 in regulating Wnt signaling pathway. A: at baseline
  without R-spondins (RSPOs), transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases (ZNRF3 or RNF43)
  reduce cell surface levels of Wnt receptors Frizzled (FZD) by direct ubiquitination,
  leading to limited Wnt signaling. B: as GPC3, GPC1 might serve as a Wnt coreceptor
  by directly binding to Wnt via HS chains and/or its core protein to potentiate downstream
  signaling. C and D: in addition, GPC1 might act as a RSPOs coreceptor to present
  RSPOs via HS chains in the absence or presence of LGRs. With LGRs, RSPO3 can bind
  simultaneously to LGRs and GPC1, and together present the RSPO3 to ZNRF3/RNF43,
  leading to the internalization and degradation of ZNRF3/RNF43. Membrane clearance
  of ZNRF3/RNF43 results in increased number of FZD at the cell membrane with the
  consequent enhanced Wnt cascades. Without LGRs, RSPO3 is presented by GPC1 alone
  to sufficiently induce Wnt signaling potentiating through a similar mechanism. GPC1,
  glypican-1; HS, heparan sulphate; LGRs, leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein
  coupled receptors.'
