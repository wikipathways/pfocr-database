caption: Summary. Pre-treatment of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) with tumor necrosis
  factor induced protein-6 (TSG-6) overcomes the differentiation inhibition induced
  by high concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). TSG-6 inhibits the
  nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway by binding to CD44 and drives the
  odonto/osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs
