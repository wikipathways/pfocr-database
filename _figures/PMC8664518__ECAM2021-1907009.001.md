caption: Possible anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture-related therapies contributing
  to analgesia in menstrual pain. Progesterone withdrawal leads to the increased production
  of prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs), cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs). These inflammatory factors promote the recruitment and activation of leukocytes,
  further increasing the inflammation and uterine hypoxia and ischemia, ultimately
  aggravating menstrual pain, which are considered as a vicious cycle. Acupuncture
  could reduce the release of PGs and downstream inflammatory cytokines by regulating
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, further relieving the inflammatory
  environment of uterus and uterine ischemia and hypoxia to alleviate menstrual pain.
  We suggest that further complexity is added to acupuncture-induced analgesia via
  interactions between chemokines and leukocytes. Symbols “↑” represent rising trend
  during menstrual pain. Symbols “—” represent inhibition of acupuncture. Abbreviations
  are listed at the end of the article.
