caption: Dietary unsaturated fatty acids enter the liver via fatty acid transporters
  where they are oxidized for energy purposes or detoxified by P450s. Inactivation
  of the P450 system as a result of Por deletion leads to hepatic accumulation of
  unsaturated fatty acids and a reduction of plasma lipid levels. Hepatic lipid accumulation
  triggers the activation of the nuclear receptor CAR (and possibly PXR), leading
  to P450 induction and liver growth. The overexpression of P450s is aimed at re-establishing
  hepatic lipid homoeostasis and the prevention of toxicity via increased metabolism
  of unsaturated fatty acids. Inactivation of POR prevents this increased metabolism
  and ultimately leads to hepatic steatosis. The development of steatosis establishes
  a cyclical process that potentiates hepatic lipid accumulation and growth. The adverse
  effect of P450 induction is altered drug metabolism and environmental chemical detoxification,
  but, in addition, the increased production of oxidized lipids could result in development
  of oxidative stress.
