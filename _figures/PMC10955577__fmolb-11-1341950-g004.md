caption: The metabolic pathways for the identified metabolites. Compared to reference
  controls (C), the blue boxes show the metabolites that are significantly lower in
  patients (P), while the orange box shows the metabolite that is significantly higher
  in patients. On the other hand, the yellow shaded circles represent the metabolites
  that appear in patients only and not in controls, while the blue shaded metabolites
  are some molecules that may have a role in developing the clinical symptoms of PD
  according to literature. This pathway was derived from KEGG database
