caption: Disruptions in STEP associated with excitotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease,
  and drugs of abuse. A, extrasynaptic NMDAR stimulation invokes calpain-mediated
  proteolysis of STEP61 producing the truncated cleavage product STEP33. STEP33 is
  unable to bind to and dephosphorylate its substrates. The stress-activated MAPK
  p38 is preferentially activated by extrasynaptic NMDAR stimulation, and the cell
  death pathways are subsequently initiated. Cleavage of STEP61 is therefore likely
  to be a component of excitotoxic insults associated with stroke/ischemia and Huntington's
  disease. On the other hand, synaptic NMDAR stimulation leads to the activation of
  multiple kinases responsible for phosphorylating STEP61 and recruiting the ubiquitin
  proteasome system to dendritic spines. Preliminary evidence suggests that phosphorylation
  of STEP61 at Ser221 is required, but not sufficient, for ubiquitination of STEP61
  (P. Kurup and P. J. Lombroso, unpublished observations). Synaptic NMDAR stimulation
  results in the degradation of STEP61, leads to an increase in ERK1/2 activation,
  and promotes neuronal survival. Ub, ubiquitin. B, in Alzheimer's disease, Aβ binding
  to α7nAChRs and synaptic NMDAR stimulation invoke activation of PP2B/calcineurin
  and PP1 to dephosphorylate STEP61 at Ser221, thereby increasing the affinity of
  STEP61 for its substrates. In a second pathway, Aβ inhibits the ubiquitin proteasome
  system and prevents degradation of STEP61. The net result is an accumulation of
  unphosphorylated and active STEP61 protein levels in AD, which leads to inappropriate
  dephosphorylation of GluN2B Tyr1472 and internalization of GluN2B-containing NMDARs.
  C, drugs of abuse, such as amphetamine, stimulate release of dopamine and glutamate
  and activate D1Rs and NMDARs, respectively. Stimulation of D1Rs initiates PKA-mediated
  phosphorylation of STEP61 and DARPP-32, which in turn inhibits PP1 activity. These
  two parallel pathways result in greater phosphorylation of STEP61 and less dephosphorylation
  of STEP61 substrates, including ERK1/2. A converging pathway is the NMDAR-mediated
  activation of MAPK kinase to phosphorylate and activate ERK1/2. Increased phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 subsequently initiates gene transcription and promotes neuroadaptive changes
  that underlie behavioral abnormalities associated with drugs of abuse.
