caption: 'Proposed neutrophil functions in the inflammatory and tumor microenvironment
  (TME). (Figure middle) Neutrophils undergo maturation in the bone marrow (BM) under
  the combined stimulation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-3 (IL-3). As myeloid progenitors
  develop, upregulation of CXCR2 and downregulation of CXCR4 occur. The whole maturation
  process, which is characterized by distinct changes in cell size, nuclear morphology,
  and granule content, progresses through six sequential stages: myeloblasts; promyelocytes;
  myelocytes; metamyelocytes; band cells; and mature polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes.
  Once matured, granulocytes reside in the BM and establish a storage pool in other
  organs, such as the lungs, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, standing by and ready
  to enter the peripheral blood for systemic recycling. In response to infection,
  inflammation, or tumor-derived signals, mature neutrophils are mobilized from the
  BM pool or other organ pools into the peripheral blood (PB). In contrast, peripheral
  mature neutrophils will be gradually aging and return to the BM for the last clearance.
  (Figure left) It is known that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a typically hypoxia
  position, where activated intracellular hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α) induces
  alteration of the cellular metabolic pathway and the accumulation of some hypoxia-induced
  factors and chemokines, like high-mobility-group box-1 (HMGB-1), oxysterols, 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic
  acid (14,15-EET), semaphorin 3E, exosomes, and IL-1β, IL-17, and IL-23. In addition,
  tumor cells and other stromal cells actively recruit neutrophils. Upon crossing
  the blood vessel, those recruited neutrophils are regulated by surrounding chemokines,
  some of which are C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL8, and
  CXCL12, to recognize, adhere, or kill tumor cells cooperating with other immune
  effector cells. However, evidence to date supports that tumor-associated neutrophils
  (TANs) are modified by tumor cells to promote tumor progression rather than to kill
  tumors. (Figure right) With respect to the inflammatory microenvironment, injured
  or infectious tissue releases various chemokines or proteins, like complement component
  3a (C3a), complement component 5a (C5a), formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP),
  leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and platelets. In response, neutrophils migrate from storage
  pools to the inflamed tissue by rolling, crawling, and transendothelial migration
  (TEM) within the PB. This process relies on cytoskeletal rearrangement, which is
  facilitated by structures. Recruited neutrophils have a crucial role in inflammation
  regulation at the pathologic site. First, neutrophils rapidly initiate a respiratory
  burst that consumes a large amount of oxygen and produces reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (.OH), and hypochlorous
  acid (HOCl), which directly kill the pathogens or diseased cells. Additionally,
  neutrophils carry out phagocytosis during which neutrophils extend pseudopods to
  surround and engulf target pathogens or cells to form a phagosome. This mechanism
  also eliminates engulfed materials directly. Moreover, neutrophils undergo degranulation
  to regulate the immune environment. During degranulation, neutrophils will release
  a variety of intracellular enzymes, like elastase and myeloperoxidase, to the extracellular
  matrix, which can degrade the cell walls or harmful components involved in regulating
  inflammation. Furthermore, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation is another
  latest way to limit the spread of pathogenic microorganisms. NETs release chromatin
  and antibacterial proteins into the extracellular space to establish a net-like
  structure that can capture and degrade microorganisms and debris. Finally, after
  fulfilling PMN leukocyte functions, spent PMN leukocytes with a decrease in proinflammatory
  capacity undergo apoptosis and are removed by macrophages, which is like what occurs
  in tumor settings. Alternatively, PMN leukocytes will reverse the TEM process back
  to the PB for the next mobilization. 14,15-EET, 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid;
