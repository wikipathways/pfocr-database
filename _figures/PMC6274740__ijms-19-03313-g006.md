caption: Schematic diagram showing the effects of Kir4.1 inhibition on neuronal excitability
  and astrocytic BDNF expression. Inhibition (e.g., gene mutation, reduced expression,
  and pharmacological blockade) of Kir4.1 channels increases the [K+]o and [Glu]o
  levels at synapses and elevates neural excitability. Kir4.1 inhibition also activates
  the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and enhances BDNF expression in astrocytes,
  facilitating neural sprouting, synaptogenesis, neurogenesis and reactive gliosis.
  Through these influences, Kir4.1-containnng channels seem to play crucial roles
  in modulating the development of central nervous system disorders such as epilepsy
  and mood disorders (e.g., major depression).
