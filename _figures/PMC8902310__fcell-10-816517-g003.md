caption: 'Canonical nucleic acid-sensing pathways and potential defects in PDAC. (A)
  Canonical nucleic acid-sensing pathways detect dsDNA or dsRNA fragments (DAMPs)
  generated as a result of stress, or following drug treatment, which accumulate in
  the cytoplasm. dsDNA fragments activate the cGAS-STING pathway. dsRNA fragments
  activate the MAVS/RIG-I/MDA5 or other sensing pathways, for example, TRAF3/TRIF.
  These complexes drive TBK1, resulting in endogenous type I interferon production
  and interferon-stimulated gene expression. Nucleic acids along with signaling molecules
  such as cGAMP can be secreted by tumor cells and activate nucleic acid-sensing or
  innate damage-sensing pathways in normal immune or stromal cells. Secreted IFN-I
  can activate IFN signaling in other tumor cells. Antigen presentation is upregulated
  with increased MHC-I expression. (B) In PDAC, these pathways are disrupted. The
  cGAS-STING pathway can be lost by deletion or downregulation. RNA sensing can be
  inhibited through the upregulation of STAU and ADAR1. cGAMP can be degraded by the
  upregulation of ENPP1. IFNAR receptor can be downregulated. Antigen presentation
  can be inhibited by the downregulation of MHC1 expression. Pathways that are lost
  or downregulated in PDAC are shown in gray. NA= nucleic acid; dsDNA= double-stranded
