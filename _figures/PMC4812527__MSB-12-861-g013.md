caption: Shown are modified outputs of the KEGG Mapper tool (v2.1, April 2014) of
  the WNT signaling pathway for DMRs identified in mothers and children during pregnancy
  and at time of birth, respectively. Each DMR assigned to a gene of this pathway
  is indicated in blue for children or red for mothers. The lighter hues correspond
  to hypomethylation, while the darker hues indicate hypermethylation. Green stars
  denote DMRs classified as ngDMRs.
