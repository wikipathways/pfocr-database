caption: Working model of SND1, negatively regulating ABI4 in the ABA biosynthesis
  pathway. SND1 is a master switch for the formation of secondary cell walls through
  the induction of Myb46 under normal conditions. For a strong and successful plant
  growth, SND1 directly binds to the ABI4 promoter and negatively regulates the expression
  of the ABI4 transcript, inhibiting of the ABA biosynthesis pathway. SND1 is induced
  by osmotic stress and inhibits continuous ABA production under these conditions.
papertitle: Dual role of SND1 facilitates efficient communication between abiotic
  stress signalling and normal growth in Arabidopsis.
