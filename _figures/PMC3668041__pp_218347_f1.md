  pseudolaric acid B 2, cis-abienol 3, triptolide 4, oridonin 5, carnosol 6, marrubiin
  7, forskolin 8, grindelic acid 9, ingenol-3-angelate 10, and jatrophone 11. These
  diterpenes are formed by bifunctional class I or class I/II enzymes or pairs of
  monofunctional class II and class I , catalyzing the cycloisomerization of  into
  distinct diterpene scaffolds. Products of  can undergo various functional modifications

  of diterpene specialized metabolism (e.g. ), we showed the variable  and  enzyme
  modules as “LEGO-like” blocks. This is conceptually modified from , who referred

  of the  modules indicate variations of the γβα three-domain structure of plant ;
  a red “X” indicates loss of function of class I or class II activity. Recombining  and  enzyme
  modules of diterpene pathway may allow for production of known and new diterpenes
  through metabolic engineering or synthetic biology.
