caption: Use of MIMO models to infer regulatory interactions in breast cancer cells.
  The interaction matrix wij from a set of good models can be used to infer regulatory
  interactions (squares=inputs; circles=internal system variables and other observables).
  Positive wij means activation and negative wij means inhibition of the target. Interestingly,
  some of the interactions are well known in MCF7 cells (green arcs) and others constitute
  predictions (orange arcs). See  for functional comments on interactions. No underlying
  pathway model was used—the network is a straightforward interpretation of the optimized
  model parameters wij. The EGFR → MEK → ERK and PI3K → AKT, canonical pathways are
  identified. Also, note the detection of self-inhibitory interactions in MEK/ERK
  signaling, identification of eIF4E and AKT as direct regulators of apoptosis and
  G1 arrest.
