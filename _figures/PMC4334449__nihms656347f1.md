caption: 'Pathogenesis of HCC and targets for chemopreventive agents. Receptor tyrosine
  kinase pathways induce MAPK and PI3K–Akt kinase signalling pathways in >50% of HCCs.
  Activation of the PI3K–Akt kinase signalling pathway results in disruption of the
  mTOR pathway, which is seen in 40–50% of cases of HCC, leading to inactivation of
  tumour suppressors such as PTEN, and promoting carcinogenesis. Statins prevent post-translational
  prenylation of signalling Ras/ Raf proteins, inhibit the activation of the proteasome
  pathway, limiting the degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21
  and p27, and block Myc phosphorylation and activation, suppressing tumour initiation
  and growth. Metformin activates AMPK, which inhibits the mTOR pathway. Thiazolidinediones
  also exert anticancer effects through inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system
  and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Antiplatelet agents, such as
  aspirin, decrease T-cell-mediated inflammation through inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2,
  decreasing severity of fibrosis and progression to HCC. Insulin and sulphonylureas
  might promote hepatocarcinogenesis by increasing IGFR1 activity, resulting in abnormal
  stimulation of multiple cellular signalling cascades, enhancing growth-factor-dependent
  cell proliferation and affecting cell metabolism. Cirrhotic-stage HCV and HBV infection
  leaves the liver prone to the development of activating mutations in oncogenes and
  inactivating genetic and epigenetic suppression of tumour suppressor genes. Abbreviations:
  AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma;
  IGFR1, insulin-like growth factor receptor 1; IR, insulin receptor; MAPK, Ras mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PPAR-γ, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ.'
