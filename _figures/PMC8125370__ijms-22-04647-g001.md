caption: Concept of trained immunity. (a) The LPS signaling pathway via Toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR4) and the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells (NF-κB) constitutes a hallmark of both innate and adaptive immune activation.
  NF-κB is a protein complex controlling the transcription of DNA, cytokine production,
  cell survival. It orchestrates the immune response to infection. The activation
  of NF-κB is initiated by the signal-induced degradation of Nuclear factor of kappa
  light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor (I-κB) proteins; and (b) comparison
  between innate and adaptive immunity. Innate and adaptive immunity provide broad
  and antigen-specific protection, respectively. (Top) innate immunity can provide
  protection against heterologous stimuli. Adaptive memory (bottom) is elicited with
  primary exposure to a specific antigen, and then, a secondary exposure and subsequent
  protection requires exposure to the same antigenic epitopes.
