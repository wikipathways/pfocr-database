caption: Cardiac insulin signaling pathway and substrate uptake. Binding of insulin
  to the insulin receptor (IR) stimulates IR autophosphorylation, which activates
  insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Phosphorylated IRS-1 then stimulates phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) to convert the lipid metabolite PIP2 into PIP3, the activator of
  Akt2 kinase. Once activated, Akt2 performs inhibiting phosphorylation on RabGAP
  AS160, thereby de-inhibiting Rab proteins, which trigger the budding of vesicles
  containing GLUT4 (in orange) and CD36 (in light green) substrate transporters from
  the endosome. Budding of GLUT4 vesicles in response to insulin also happens from
  an additional GLUT4 intracellular storage compartment, namely GLUT4 storage vesicles
  (GSVs). Following vesicle formation, GLUT4 and CD36 will travel to the sarcolemma
  to mediate the uptake of glucose and (long-chain) fatty acids, respectively. The
  fusion between GLUT4- or CD36-containing vesicles and the sarcolemma is mediated
  by v- and t-SNARE proteins (not represented in the figure). The tuned subcellular
  recycling of these substrate transporter molecules to and from the sarcolemma translates
  into balanced glucose and fatty acid uptake rates, which is necessary for proper
  myocardial functioning.
