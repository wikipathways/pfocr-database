caption: Pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance mediated by the phase separation
  of the Hippo pathway. a YAP-MAMLD1 and C11ORF95-YAP fusion proteins in neural stem
  cells undergo phase separation with various transcription factors, including chromatin
  remodeling factors. This sequestration from the PRC2 complex promotes ependymoma
  development by disrupting normal transcriptional regulation. b The paraspeckle protein
  NONO promotes the phase separation of TAZ, activating TAZ-driven oncogenic transcriptional
  programming in glioma cells. c Elevated expression of the lncRNA SNHG9 in triple-negative
  breast cancers recruits LATS and PA to form phase-separated condensates. d In the
  early stages of liver cancer, downregulation of the G6PC gene leads to glycogen
  accumulation. This accumulation forms a phase separation with MST1 and Laforin,
  activating the Hippo pathway and promoting tumor initiation. e In arterial stiffness,
  LATS1/2 interacts with DDR1 to form condensates. This interaction prevents YAP phosphorylation,
  allowing unphosphorylated YAP to translocate to the nucleus and associate with TEAD,
  leading to the activation of target gene expression. f Mutations in the FERM domain
  of NF2 lead to condensate formation with IRF3 and TBK1, inhibiting MAVS/STING signaling.
  This inhibition results in IRF3 phosphorylation, which induces an antitumor immune
  response. g In cancer cells undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy, elevated YAP expression
  results in the formation of condensates with transcriptional cofactors TEAD, RNA
  polymerase, and EP300. These condensates drive the expression of target genes such
  as Myc and CD155, contributing to resistance against anti-PD-1 therapy
