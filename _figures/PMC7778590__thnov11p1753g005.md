caption: Targeting YAP for PDAC therapy. There are several strategies for targeting
  YAP in PDAC. Statin-mediated inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway
  reduces the geranylgeranylation and membrane localization of Rho GTPases, restricting
  YAP nuclear accumulation and thus its activity. Verteporfin and VGLL4-mimicking
  peptides disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD, inhibiting YAP-induced transcription.
  Metformin activates AMPK, which inhibits YAP both directly and by activating LATS
  kinases. BET inhibitors oppose the transcription of YAP-regulated genes. Neratinib
  increases the phosphorylation of LATS1 and YAP, causing YAP cytosolic accumulation
  and degradation.
