caption: Schematic representation of competence initiation (green and blue), carbohydrate
  uptake via the PTS (red), and possible mechanisms by which the transport and metabolism
  of certain carbohydrates influence competence gene expression (black) by altering
  comS and comX expression in S. mutans. Genetic competence is initiated by the alternate
  sigma factor ComX, which directs RNA polymerase to the promoters of late competence
  genes. Expression of comX is regulated by the ComR/XIP complex, consisting of the
  Rgg-type regulator ComR and XIP, a 7-aa peptide derived from ComS. In addition to
  comX, the ComR/XIP complex activates the promoter of comS, creating a positive-feedback
  loop. The CSP-ComDE pathway is one of several extracellular signaling systems capable
  of influencing expression of the ComRS circuit, subsequently affecting genetic competence.
  After the product of comC has been exported and modified to produce CSP, this peptide
  is detected by ComDE, and through an unknown mechanism, the ComRS circuit is activated.
  Finally, carbohydrate uptake via the PTS is mediated by the transfer of a phosphate
  group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the incoming carbohydrate through EI, HPr,
  and membrane-bound PTS permeases. During transport of different carbohydrates, particular
  glycolytic intermediates can accumulate, the cognate EIIAB permeases exist in a
  dephosphorylated state, and the phosphorylation status of HPr changes. We hypothesize
  that particular metabolic intermediates and/or differentially phosphorylated PTS
  enzymes arising from the transport and metabolism of carbohydrates analyzed in this
  study () may interact with factors that influence com gene expression and, in some
  cases, the progression to the competent state. See the text for more details.
