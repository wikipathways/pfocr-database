caption: This figure shows the reconstructed signaling network from a combination
  of databases. An arrow shows the positive regulatory relationship between two proteins,
  while a T shaped arrow indicates inhibition. Green nodes are stimuli, blue nodes
  are readouts, white nodes are unmeasured or unobserved, and blue nodes with a red
  border represent inhibitors and readouts at the same time. Please note that in the
  node labels, we have added the phosphorylation sites to the protein names in order
  to connect them to the experimental measurements.
