caption: Dynamics of phosphosites in the ErbB pathway (the HER2-positive gastric cancer
  [pre-treatment] group versus the HER2-negative gastric cancer group). Proteins in
  the ErbB signaling pathway are selected from the KEGG database. Proteins with quantified
  phosphosites are shown as white boxes with solid lines. Proteins without quantified
  phosphosites are shown as grey boxes with dotted lines. Differentially expressed
  phosphosites with significance (log2 |FC| > 1 and p < 0.05) are depicted by a purple
  line. Differentially expressed phosphosites with a tendency (log2 |FC| > 1 and and
  0.05 ≤ p < 0.1) are depicted by a green line.
