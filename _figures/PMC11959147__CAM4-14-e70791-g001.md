caption: Illustration of the PI3K (left) and TP53, inside the nucleus, (right) signaling
  pathways [21, 22]. The left panel illustrates the PI3K pathway, a key intracellular
  signaling cascade involved in cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Upon
  activation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to its receptor (EGFR), phosphorylation
  of PI3K occurs, leading to downstream activation of AKT. This process is negatively
  regulated by PTEN, a tumor suppressor that dephosphorylates PIP3 to inhibit pathway
  hyperactivation. Further downstream, mTORC1 is activated, contributing to cellular
  growth, metabolism, and cancer progression. Genetic alterations in components of
  this pathway, including PIK3CA mutations and PTEN deletions, are frequently observed
  in colorectal cancer (CRC). The right panel depicts the TP53 signaling pathway,
  a critical regulator of genomic stability and cellular response to DNA damage. DNA
  damage activates ATM and ATR kinases, which phosphorylate CHK1/CHK2, leading to
  the stabilization and activation of p53. Activated p53 transcriptionally regulates
  key target genes involved in cell cycle arrest (p21, CDKN1A), DNA repair, apoptosis
  (BAX, PUMA), and senescence. Negative regulation of p53 by MDM2 and MDM4 results
  in its degradation under normal conditions, while mutations in TP53 disrupt its
  tumor‐suppressive functions, contributing to CRC progression. These pathways play
  crucial roles in colorectal cancer development and therapy resistance, making them
  important targets for molecular characterization in early‐onset CRC among Hispanic/Latino
  patients
