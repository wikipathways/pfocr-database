caption: Canonical Notch signaling and Notch conservation between human and Monosiga
  brevicollis. Throughout Figure 1, conservation of Notch proteins or domains between
  human and M. brevicollis is indicated by green (positive), yellow (unknown), or
  red (negative) shading according to references [] and []. (A) Conservation of mammalian
  Notch receptor domains in M. brevicollis. Mammalian (human) Notch receptors contain
  36 EGF-like repeats and three LNR or NRR (Lin-12 Notch Repeats or Negative Regulatory
  Region) repeats in the extracellular domain. The intracellular portion of human
  Notch contains seven ankyrin domains and a PEST sequence at the C-terminal. For
  simplicity, the intracellular RAM (RBPj Association Module) domain, two NLS (Nuclear
  Localization sequence) domains, and TAD (Transactivation Domain) are not shown in
  this figure. Please refer to references [, ] for complete details. Three separate
  proteins (N1, N2, and N3) in M. brevicollis contain six Ankyrin domains, two LNR
  domains, and 36 EGF-like repeats respectively []. (B) Model of canonical Notch activation
  mechanism. Notch receptors are modified in the secretory pathway (ER/golgi) by Furin
  cleavage (S1 cleavage) and glycosylation of EGF-like domains by O-fucosyltransferase
  (O-fut), Rumi/Poglut1 (Protein O-Glycosyltransferase 1), and fringe family glycosyltransferases.
  The Furin cleavage products remain non-covalently associated in the membrane where
  a pulling force initiated by Notch ligand endocytosis in sending cells enables further
  cleavage by α-secretase (S2 cleavage, NEXT fragment) at the LNR domain, and γ-secretase
  (S3 cleavage, NICD fragment) in the membrane of receiving cells. Several regulatory
  proteins including Numb, Notchless, and Deltex control Notch availability at the
  membrane. After γ-secretase cleavage, the NICD fragment translocates to the nucleus
  where it displaces the transcriptional co-repressor SMRT from CSL/RBP-jk. NICD participates
  in a transcriptional complex with CSL, MAML, and p300 to drive transcription of
  Notch targets such as Hes and Hey genes. NICD steady-state levels are controlled
  by nuclear export, ubiquitination (Ub) by Sel10, and subsequent degradation in the
  proteasome.
