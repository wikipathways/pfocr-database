caption: Oestrogen metabolism in PAH. The circulating C19 precursors, testosterone
  and androstenedione are converted by CYP19A1 to 17β oestradiol and oestrone respectively.
  These metabolites then undergo hydroxylation at the C2, C4 or C16 positions by activity
  of CYP enzymes, including CYP1B1. While hydroxylation at C2 produces anti-proliferative
  metabolites, C16 hydroxylation induces proliferative metabolites. The CYPs are therefore
  key determinants of metabolite formation and can perturb the pathway towards an
  anti- or pro-proliferative state. Hydroxylated oestrogens can be further metabolized
  to the methoxyestrogens, which may also influence PASMC proliferation.
