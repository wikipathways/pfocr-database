caption: Changes in metabolite levels derived from amino acids in mature seeds. Mature
  seeds of non-transformant (NT) and homozygous GT plants (GT) were subjected to metabolome
  analysis using CE-MS (see ). Representative metabolites are shown in this pathway
  map, and the fold change in metabolite levels in mature seeds of GT plants to that
  in NT is shown using a color scale, as indicated.

  description: Changes in metabolite levels derived from amino acids in mature seeds.
    Mature seeds of non-transformant (NT) and homozygous GT plants (GT) were subjected
    to metabolome analysis using CE-MS (see ). Representative metabolites are shown
    in this pathway map, and the fold change in metabolite levels in mature seeds
    of GT plants to that in NT is shown using a color scale, as indicated.
