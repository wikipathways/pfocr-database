caption: Proposed model of the C. metallidurans CH34 and its c-di-GMP signaling pathway
  in response to cadmium. 1, Cadmium ions (gray circles) enter the cell through metal
  ion transporters (MIT). 2, Cadmium induces gene expression of detoxification systems
  CadA, MerA, and RND antiporter pumps. Cadmium ions upregulate the phosphodiesterases
  (PDEs) (mrp1 and mrp2 genes) encoded in the mercury resistance operons Tn4378 and
  Tn4380 and downregulate the diguanylate cyclase (RMET_RS11180). 3, MerA proteins
  (yellow circles) may act as chelator proteins of free cadmium cooperating with canonical
  detoxification systems. Efflux of cadmium is facilitated by CadA and RND antiporter
  pumps. 4, Upregulation of Mrp1/2 and downregulation of RMET_RS11180 protein decreased
  c-di-GMP levels. 5, The drop of c-di-GMP levels inhibits the cell adhesion (pilus)
  and extracellular polysaccharide synthesis (cellulose and Pel) that may favor the
  planktonic lifestyle. Vertical arrows stand for upregulation (green) and downregulation
  (red) of molecules.
