caption: 'A) Main components involved in the speract signaling pathway. The binding
  of speract with its receptor in the flagellar membrane triggers the cascade that
  produces changes in  in two different forms: a sustained (tonic) increment and superimposed
  (supratonic) fluctuations. B) Events produced by the signaling pathway.'
