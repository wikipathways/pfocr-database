caption: 'Schematic overview of the autophagic pathway and potential drug target points
  of the pathway. The autophagic pathway involves the following steps: induction,
  nucleation, maturation and degradation. Initiation of the pathway begins with growth
  factors signaling the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1).
  The Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) complex consisting of autophagy-related gene 13
  (ATG13) and family interacting protein of 200 Kd ( FIP200) is required to initiate
  Beclin 1 class III PI3K complex, which is responsible for initiating the Vacuolar
  Protein Sorting Protein 34 (Vps34), Beclin 1, ATG14L, p150 complex that initiates
  the formation of the phagophore membrane. ATG12-ATG5 and the microtubule-associated
  protein light chain 3 (LC3) conjugates are essential for the formation of the autophagosome
  and its degradation in the lysosome.'
