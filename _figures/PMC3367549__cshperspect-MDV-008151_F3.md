caption: Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. A key first step in the SHH pathway
  is the posttranslational processing of SHH protein to produce the mature SHH-N ligand,
  which is lipid (palmitate and cholesterol) modified (, ). Secretion of SHH is dependent
  on a transmembrane protein Dispatched (). In the absence of SHH ligand (right-hand
  side of figure), the 12-span transmembrane protein Patched (Ptch1) prevents a seven-pass
  transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) from entering the primary cilium. Gli3 is
  proteolytically cleaved with its amino-terminal fragment functioning as a transcriptional
  repressor of putative repressors (X) to induce the expression of downstream targets
  (referred to as class I genes in neural development). When SHH binds to Ptch1, the
  repression of Smo is relieved and Smo moves into the cilium, where it promotes the
  accumulation of Gli proteins and inhibit the proteolytic cleavage of Gli3. Gli proteins
  translocate to the nucleus where they activate the transcription of class II genes,
  Gli1 and Ptch1 (; ). The latter produces a negative feedback loop to switch off
  SHH signaling. Several other regulators of SHH signaling have been identified. The
  intracellular protein Sufu interacts with Gli3 in a SHH-dependent manner to regulate
  the efficiency of Gli3 processing. Membrane proteins Gas1, Boc, and Cdo bind to
  SHH and may regulate the accessibility to SHH ligand to Ptch1. Rab23 promotes the
  expression of class I while inhibiting the expression of class II genes, and PKA
  can inhibit the activity of Gli2/3 activator complexes.
