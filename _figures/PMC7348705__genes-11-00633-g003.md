caption: The schematic diagram presents the multiple pathways regulating the root
  system architecture (RSA; lateral and primary root) response to the localized and
  high nitrate conditions in Arabidopsis. Only those pathways discussed in the present
  review are depicted. The green arrows indicate systemic transport and assimilation,
  the black arrows indicate positive signaling as a stimulatory effect, red lines
  indicate negative signaling as an inhibitory effect, the orange lines depict the
  unknown positive and negative signaling pathways, and dotted lines represent the
  unconfirmed nitrate-mediated signaling pathways. The low nitrate and severely low
  nitrate conditions have been reported to have a stimulatory and inhibitory effect
  on LR development, respectively, while high NO3− supply has an inhibitory effect
  on LR growth [] (see text for further information). External NO3 regulates primary
  root growth in Arabidopsis. The receptor for the external glutamate signal is shown
  as a glutamate-gated Ca2+ channel because these are known to be activated at root
  tips []. However, its specific role in this signaling pathway is unconfirmed (see
  text for further information).
