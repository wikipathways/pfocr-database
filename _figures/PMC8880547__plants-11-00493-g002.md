caption: Transcriptional regulation pathway of KNAT7 gene. SCW-associated upstream
  transcription factors (MYB61, SND1/NST1/NST2, VND1/VND7) and MYB46 directly bind
  the binding sites in the KNAT7 gene promoter to regulate the expression of the KNAT7
  gene. KNAT7 positively regulates the expression of various xylan synthesis genes
  (IRX9/10 and IRX14L/FRA8). Interactions between KNAT7 and KNAT3 TFs might regulate
  F5H expression, and the interactions between KNAT7 and BLH6 negatively regulate
  the expression of the homeodomain-ZIP (HD-ZIP) TF gene Revoluta. All these interactions
  ultimately regulate SCW formation in higher plants. All genes are shown as rounded
  rectangles and proteins are indicated by rectangles.
