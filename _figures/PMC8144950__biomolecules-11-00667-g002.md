caption: Genetic regulation of NSC (neural stem cell) dynamics. The role of different
  pathways in maintaining NSC proliferation, differentiation, and self-renewal are
  shown. In NSCs, Wnt, MAPK, and Hedgehog signaling acts as a positive regulator of
  proliferation where its upregulation increases NSC number. TGF-β, Notch, and Hippo
  pathways act to maintain the quiescent state of NSCs and promote stemness. JAK/STAT
  pathway is involved in decisions of lineage specification where upregulated signal
  induces astrocyte differentiation and downregulated signal induces neural differentiation.
  MAPK is also involved in NSC migration towards the site of injury.
