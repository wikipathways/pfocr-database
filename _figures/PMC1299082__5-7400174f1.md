caption: The heterotrimeric G-protein cycle. This simplified model highlights elements
  of the pathway that are found in both metazoans and plants. The repertoire of each
  element in plants is greatly reduced compared with metazoans. GPCR, G-protein-coupled
  receptor; RGS, regulator of G-protein signalling. Figure modified with permission
