caption: Coordination of UPRmt, mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis during aging.
  Proteotoxic and metabolic stress impair mitochondrial homeostasis and induce ATFS-1
  nuclearization. In turn, ATFS-1 orchestrates the mitochondrial unfolded protein
  response (UPRmt), which restores mitochondrial function. Excessive mitochondrial
  damage causes oxidative stress and initiates a bipartite retrograde response, mediated
  by SKN-1, to preserve mitochondrial homeostasis. SKN-1 coordinates expression of
  both mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy genes. Mitophagy is stimulated to eliminate
  entire damaged mitochondria. DCT-1, PINK-1 and PDR-1 act in the same pathway to
  mediate mitophagy. SKN-1 transcriptionally regulates expression of the DCT-1 mitophagy
  receptor. Notably, the skn-1 gene is among ATFS-1 transcriptional targets during
  activation of UPRmt, thus, establishing a complex interplay between UPRmt, mitophagy
  and mitochondrial biogenesis.
