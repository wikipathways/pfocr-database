caption: AID-initiated SHM pathways. AID acting on ssDNA exposed in the transcription
  bubble in an immunoglobulin V region deaminates C preferentially at WRC hot spot
  motifs. Subsequent copying of U by a high-fidelity DNA polymerase results in C →
  T transitions, or copying by error-prone pol η could generate C → N transition or
  transversion mutations. A second stage of diversification leading to mutations at
  A:T sites requires the action of either mismatch repair proteins, including MSH2–MSH6,
  or base excision repair proteins, including UNG and apurinic endonuclease (APE).
  Mutations at WA hot spot motifs could be made by pol η during long (mismatch repair)
  or short (base excision repair) gap-filling synthesis. The mismatch repair pathway
  (solid arrow) has been suggested to play a greater role than the base excision repair
  pathway (dashed arrow) in introducing mutations at A:T sites (), although the relative
  importance of each pathway remains to be determined.
