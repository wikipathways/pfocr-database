caption: The pathway signalling starts with the binding of insulin or growth factors
  to insulin receptors. This binding in turn activates PI3K. Activated PI3K converts
  PIP2 to PIP3. These PIPs then mop up PDK1 and Akt to the cell membrane. When PDK1
  and Akt are taken to the cell membrane, Akt gets activated and phosphorylated. Phosphorylation
  and activation of Akt phosphorylate and inactivate TSC1 and TSC2. The consequence
  of this in turn is the activation of Rheb and mTOR1, part of the two functional
  complexes of mTOR. At this point, AMPK, an energy sensor that detects changes in
  the intracellular ATP/AMP ratio, comes in and directly phosphorylate TSC2. This
  phosphorylation is very significant as it conditions TSC2 for further phosphorylation
  by GSK3. Further phosphorylation of TSC2 by GSK3 inhibits mTOR1. Amino acid availability
  activates mTORC1 via Rag GTPases. The PI3K downstream effectors including Akt, PIP3,
  mTOR, GSK3 and PDK1 regulate cell growth, proliferation and survival. Akt, PIP3,
  GSK3 and PDK1 downstream of PI3K effect the ion channels. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors
  that block the ion channels and/or enhance cancer management act on some of these
  effectors and effect their signalling, thereby causing cardiovascular toxicity and
  APD elongation, through interactions with the ion channels in the heart, conversely. APD, action
  potential duration; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate; TSC, tuberous sclerosis.
