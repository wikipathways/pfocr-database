caption: 'Overview of the main synaptic signaling mechanisms of endocannabinoid and
  hypocretinergic systems. (A) Endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic signaling. (1) Glutamate
  is released from presynaptic terminals and stimulates both ionotropic and metabotropic
  glutamate receptors, leading to postsynaptic depolarization through Ca2+ entrance
  and Gq-protein activation. (2) High Ca2+ concentration stimulates endocannabinoid
  synthesis through PLC and PLD. 2-AG synthesis is also mediated by Gq-protein activation.
  (3) Endocannabinoids are released to the synaptic cleft and activate CB1 and CB2
  presynaptic receptors. Some of the main downstream consequences of CB receptor activation
  and subsequent Gi-protein stimulation are: (3a) inhibition of AC activity, (3b)
  membrane hyperpolarization after modulation of K+ and Ca2+ channels, and subsequent
  inhibition of NT release, (3c) activation of protein kinase cascades such as MAPK
  pathway. (B) Hypocretin-mediated synaptic signaling. (1) Hypocretins are released
  from presynaptic terminals and activate postsynaptic HcrtR1 and HcrtR2. (2) HcrtR
  stimulation is mainly associated with Gq-protein activation, but it can activate
  also other G-protein subtypes. Some of the main downstream consequences of HcrtR
  activation and subsequent Gq-protein stimulation are: (2a) activation of PLC activity,
  and subsequent DAG and 2-AG synthesis (2b) membrane depolarization after modulation
  of K+ channels, non-specific cationic channels and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, (2c) activation
  of protein kinase cascades such as MAPK pathway. NT, neurotransmitter; iGluR, ionotropic
