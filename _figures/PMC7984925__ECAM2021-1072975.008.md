  network. The word colors represent different groups: red represents the disease;
  pink represents the compound prescription; black represents the active component;
  blue represents the target gene; green represents the pathway; node size and color
  represent the degree; the degree from low to high represents the node from small
  to large and the color from orange to cyan; edge size and color represent edgebetweenness;
  edgebetweenness from low to high represents the edge from thin to thick and the
  color from orange to cyan.'
