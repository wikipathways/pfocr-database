caption: γ-34.5 deletion enhances safety and tumor-specificity of OHSV-IL12. (A) Healthy
  cells have inherent anti-viral defense mechanisms, such as protein kinase R (PKR).
  PKR phosphorylates translation initiation factor eIF2α, which shuts down synthesis
  of foreign proteins or viral antigens. (B) OHSV with an intact γ-34.5 overturns
  anti-viral defense in healthy cells through γ-34.5-mediated dephosphorylation of
  eIF2α and helps in viral protein synthesis/viral replication in healthy cells, leading
  to development of disease. (C) γ-34.5 deletion results in no eIF2α dephosphorylation
  in normal or healthy cells, and thereby, no protein synthesis and viral replication.
  (D) Cancer cells usually have defective PKR-eIF2α pathway, thus no inhibition of
  foreign protein synthesis. Therefore, γ-34.5-deleted OHSV can freely replicate in
  cancer cells.
