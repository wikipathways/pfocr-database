caption: Biological effect of PARPi on cancer cells. (a) PARPi delays DNA repair that
  generates double-strand breaks (DSB) and catastrophic unrepaired DNA damages in
  tumor cells, increasing neoantigens load and tumor mutation burden; (b) DSB induced
  by PARPi in tumor cells produce double-strand DNA (dsDNA) fragments that, through
  cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) binding, lead to stimulator or interferon genes (STING)
  activation and the generation of a type I interferon (IFN) response. This upregulates
  chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10 leading to T cell recruitment; (c) Upregulation of PD-L1
  via STING pathway lead to T cell exhaustion.
