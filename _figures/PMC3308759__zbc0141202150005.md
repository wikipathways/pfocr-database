caption: Model for TLS across BPDE-dG and recruitment of pol ζ to a replication-stalled
  site. Following the insertion of a nucleotide (N) opposite BPDE-dG (red triangle),
  extension from this newly created terminus requires pol ζ when N is incorrect A,
  T, or G. On the other hand, when N is correct, C (the extension) does not necessarily
  depend on pol ζ. Pol κ might conduct this extension. Pol ζ is recruited by REV1
  through the interaction between REV1 and REV7, a subunit of pol ζ (thick red arrow).
  Then REV1 may interact with monoubiquitinated PCNA at its ubiquitin-binding motifs
  to bring pol ζ to a stalled site. This is the major pol ζ recruitment pathway. A
  REV1-independent minor pathway (thin red arrow) also exists, but its mechanism is
  unclear. U, 1, 3, and 7 represent monoubiquitin, REV1, REV3 and REV7, respectively.
