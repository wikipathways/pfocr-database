caption: 'Classical (canonical) and biased (noncanonical) activation of PAR2. (A)
  Classical: Activation of PAR2, through the proteolytic removal of the N-terminal
  pro-peptide domain by trypsin and TLPs, unmasks the tethered ligand in order to
  trigger signalling via Gαq, and calcium flux leads to associated inflammatory responses.
  (B) Biased: Proteases cleaving downstream of the activation site (e.g., NE and PR-3)
  disarm the receptor to truncate the tethered ligand, rendering it unavailable for
  further activation, although the MAPK pathway can still be activated independent
  of calcium increase and β-arrestin interactions.'
