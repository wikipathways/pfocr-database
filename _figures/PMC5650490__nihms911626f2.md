caption: Aberrations in the microbiome following MIA can lead to altered development
  of peripheral immunity, which in turn leads to alterations in brain development.
  Deficits in long-range connections between brain regions implicated in SZ and ASD,
  including the hippocampus (HC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate
  cortex (ACC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the amygdala (AM) have been reported
  in MIA(, , ). Specific alterations in activity of glutamatergic neurons in the cortex
  caused by decreased function of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area
  (VTA) and decreased GABAergic input also occurs in SZ and ASD as well as the MIA
  models(, , ). Changes in expression of immune molecules in the brain and even at
  synapses, including cytokines and MHCI molecules, alters synaptic plasticity and
  function, and contributes to the changes in circuitry and connectivity between brain
  regions that characterize these disorders(). Finally, alterations in immune and
  neuronal signaling due to MIA may converge upon the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) pathway, which regulates synapse formation, growth, translation, survival,
  and autophagy().
