caption: Proposed IAA biosynthetic pathway in plants. (A) Previously proposed IAA
  biosynthetic pathway. The YUC and CYP79B pathways that lead to IAOx synthesis are
  illustrated by blue and red arrows, respectively. (B) The IAA biosynthetic pathway
  proposed in this study. Each number indicates a proposed pathway for biosynthesis
  of IAA from TRP. The bold arrows indicate novel pathways converting IAOx to IAA.
  Dotted square indicates the IAOx metabolic pathway in Arabidopsis. The IAOx-dependent
  IAA biosynthetic pathway is shown in the gray squares. Cloned genes that potentially
  encode enzymes for IAA, CL, and IG biosyntheses are shown in italics.
