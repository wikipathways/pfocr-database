caption: TGF-β processing and uPA-uPAR-dependent activation. (a) TGF-β is synthesized
  as a precursor protein. The signal peptide (SP) targets TGF-β precursor protein
  to the secretory pathway, which is cleaved during the transit through the rough
  endoplasmic reticulum (RER); a homodimer of protein is formed and then is cleaved
  by furin convertase to produce small latent complex (SLC), in which mature TGF-β
  remains noncovalent bounded to latency-associated peptide (LAP), being in that way
  as inactive form. Next, SLC by covalently binding to latent TGF-β binding protein
  (LTBP) produces the large latent complex (LLC); finally, LLC is secreted and stored
  into the extracellular matrix (ECM) for its subsequent activation. (b) uPA bounded
  to its uPA receptor (uPAR) activates plasminogen (Plg) to the active form plasmin
  (Plm); Plm can directly degrade ECM and/or may promote the activation of latent
  TGF-β by proteolytic cleavage within the N-terminal region of the LAP.
