caption: Metformin effects on non-transformed cells versus lung cancer cells. Metformin
  treatment has different effects on LC cells than non-transformed cells. In both
  cell types, metformin exerts its effect through a dysfunction of complex I of the
  electron transport chain, however, in non-transformed cells, metformin promotes
  glucose incorporation through increased expression of GLUT1 (green membrane proteins),
  hexokinases (orange circles), and decreasing the gluconeogenesis process. The ATP
  generation process is also increased through activation of AMPK and with a sustained
  OXPHOS. In LC cells, metformin stimulates energy generation through over-activation
  of OXPHOS processes associated with an increasing of AMPK pathway activity, mTOR
  inhibition, and a decrease in all glycolytic proteins and processes that are associated
  with this metabolic pathway. (Created with BioRender.com).

  description: Metformin effects on non-transformed cells versus lung cancer cells.
    Metformin treatment has different effects on LC cells than non-transformed cells.
    In both cell types, metformin exerts its effect through a dysfunction of complex
    I of the electron transport chain, however, in non-transformed cells, metformin
    promotes glucose incorporation through increased expression of GLUT1 (green membrane
    proteins), hexokinases (orange circles), and decreasing the gluconeogenesis process.
    The ATP generation process is also increased through activation of AMPK and with
    a sustained OXPHOS. In LC cells, metformin stimulates energy generation through
    over-activation of OXPHOS processes associated with an increasing of AMPK pathway
    activity, mTOR inhibition, and a decrease in all glycolytic proteins and processes
