caption: PA14 infection causes an insulin agonist-mediated activation of DAF-2, which
  likely involves expression of ins-7. Upon DAF-2 activation, several serine-threonine
  kinases phorphorylate DAF-16, causing the transcription factor to be retained in
  the cytoplasm and inhibiting its transcriptional-regulatory activity. Consequently,
  DAF-2–regulated gene expression is affected, causing the downregulation of immune
  defense genes such as lys-7 and thn-2. Germline signaling and heat shock regulate
  DAF-16 in parallel to the effect of PA14 and DAF-2 activity. DAF-2 and DAF-16 may
  function in a network with other signaling components to affect the expression of
  DAF-2-regulated genes including spp-1.
