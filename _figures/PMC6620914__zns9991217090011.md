caption: Schematic of GPR30-mediated signaling. GPR30, a G-protein-coupled receptor,
  activates heterotrimeric G-proteins, which in turn activates multiple effectors,
  including adenylyl cyclase (resulting in cAMP production), the phosphorylation of
  ERK1/2, and Src. The latter appears to be involved in the activation of transactivation
  of EGFRs via a G-protein-dependent pathway. The activated ERK by GPR30 agonist inhibits
  p-DAPK1 from dephosphorylating to the active form (DAPK1). This leads to the inhibition
  of active DAPK1 binding with the NR2B, and then phosphorylated NR2B at Ser-1303.
  The phosphorylated NR2B at Ser-1303 enhances the function of NMDARs, which causes
  the overload of Ca2+. The GPR30 is also shown to directly activate the PI3K/Akt
  survival signaling cascades.
