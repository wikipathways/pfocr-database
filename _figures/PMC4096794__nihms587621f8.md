caption: In scenario 1 with an intact SUMO pathway and active TFAP2C, breast cancer
  cells are maintained in the luminal phenotype. Transcriptional regulation of many
  luminal gene promoters are coordinately regulated by TFAP2C, ERα and FOXA1, as well
  as potentially other co-factors. As diagrammed in scenario 2, loss of TFAP2C in
  the presence of the SUMO pathway induces epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT),
  characterized by repression of luminal genes and induction of basal-associated genes.
  As shown in scenario 3, inhibition of the SUMO pathway in the absence of TFAP2C
  activity, SUMO unconjugated TFAP2A induces mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET),
  characterized by repression of basal-associated gene expression and induction of
  luminalassociated genes.
