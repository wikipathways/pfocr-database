caption: General mechanism of intracellular gustatory response. When tastant molecules
  combine with trans-membrane GPCR and the complex cytosolic subunit of βγ, Ggust,
  and Gγ13 cause conversion of ATP and PIP2 (with PLCβ, phospholipase Cβ) into cAMP
  and IP3, respectively. This IP3 mediated the increase of Ca2+ inside the cell through
  opening of channels in the Ca2+ storing organelles of cell, i.e., endoplasmic reticulum
  (not shown in the figure). This increased Ca2+ opens the TRPM5 channels which allow
  entry of Na+ ions. Both these positive ions change the membrane potential. Similarly,
  conversion of ATP into cAMP causes opening of AC channels which affects the downstream
  channels which may be similar to olfactory transduction signaling pathway. PLCβ,
  phospholipase Cβ; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate.
