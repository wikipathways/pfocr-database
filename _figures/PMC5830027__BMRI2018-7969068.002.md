caption: The metabolic pathway of NUCKS1 in physiological and pathological process.
  In in vivo studies, NUCKS1 plays the important roles in other metabolic diseases,
  especially involving in regulating insulin metabolism. NUCKS1 has correlation with
  the inflammatory immune diseases via involving in up-and-down certain cytokines
  and activating some pathways. In in vitro studies, NUCKS1 has connection with miRNA,
  but the expression level of them is inversely. Meanwhile, NUCKS1 plays significant
  roles in DNA damage response and participates in DNA repair pathway.
