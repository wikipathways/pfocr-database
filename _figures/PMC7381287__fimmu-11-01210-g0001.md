caption: LPS signaling. Extracellular gram-negative bacteria release LPS in the form
  of micelles or OMVs. OMVs and micelles containing LPS can be delivered intracellularly
  where LPS activates caspase-dependent responses (right). Soluble LPS-binding protein
  (LBP) allows CD14 to capture LPS monomers. CD14 increases the sensitivity of TLR4-MD2
  for LPS and favors the re-location of the complex formed by LPS, CD14, and TLR4-MD2
  in the plasma membrane lipids rafts. Once in the lipid rafts, TLR4-MD2 starts TIRAP-MyD88-dependent
  responses. CD14 also induces the endocytosis of LPS and TLR4-MD2. From endosomes
  TLR4-MD2 triggers the TRAM-TRIF pathway and thereby sustains the activation of NF-κB
  and the production of type I IFNs (–).
