caption: —(a) The canonical ether/ester biosynthetic pathways in Archaea and Bacteria
  and how they relate to glycerol metabolism. Based on  from . Archaeal pathways in
  blue and yellow (blue = heterotrophic Archaea and yellow = autotrophic Archaea),
  bacterial pathway in red. Hypothetical biosynthetic pathway, as suggested by , in
  dashed lines. (b) Composition of bacterial and archaeal phospholipids. In Archaea,
  glycerol-1-phosphate (G1P) is synthesized from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)
  using the enzyme glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (G1PDH). The first and second
  isoprenoid chains (GGGPs) are added by geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase
  (GGGPS) and digeranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase (DGGGPS), respectively.
  In Bacteria, glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is synthesized by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G3PDH) from DHAP. There are two forms of this enzyme, GpsA and GlpA/GlpD, encoded
  by the gps and glp genes, respectively. G3P may also be produced from glycerol by
  glycerol kinase (GlpK). In certain Bacteria, such as Gammaproteobacteria, the first
  fatty-acid chain is added by a version of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase called
  PlsB. Other Bacteria, including most gram-positive bacteria, use a system which
  includes another glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, PlsY, in conjunction with
  the enzyme PlsX (; ). The second fatty-acid chain is attached by 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate
  O-acyltransferase (PlsC).
