caption: (A) Overview of ceramide metabolism. Ceramide is an intracellular hub that
  controls cell death and survival in endothelial cells. Ceramide accumulation in
  the cell leads to ceramide-induced cell death. Ceramide is enzymatically synthesized
  de novo from serine and palmitoyl-CoA (coenzyme A) via the actions of SPT (serine
  palmitoyl-CoA transferase) and CerS (ceramide synthase) (the de novo synthesis pathway
  [blue panel]). Ceramide is also generated by other metabolic pathways, including
  from 1) sphingomyelin by SMS (sphingomyelinases; the sphingomyelin pathway [green
  panel]); 2) glucosylceramide (GlcCer) via the actions of GCase (β-glucosidase; the
  salvage pathway [orange panel]); 3) ceramide-1-phosphate phosphatase via the actions
  of C1PPase (ceramide-1-phosphate phosphatase; alternate pathway [gray panel]); and
  4) sphingosine via the actions of CerS (the catabolic pathway [yellow panel]). However,
  ceramide is enzymatically converted to metabolites that promote cell survival, including
  1) GlcCer, which is synthesized by GCS (glucosylceramide synthase); 2) sphingosine-1-phosphate,
  which is synthesized by SK (sphingosine kinase); and 3) ceramide-1-phosphate, which
  is synthesized by CK (ceramide kinase). In their study, Koike and colleagues explored
  the hydrolytic pathway, in which proapoptotic ceramide is converted to GlcCer (which
  is a glycosylated prosurvival signaling molecule) by the enzyme GCS. (B) Mechanism
  by which cigarette smoke (CS) induces pulmonary endothelial cell death by reducing
  the conversion of ceramide to GlcCer (glycosylceramide) to induce autophagic cell
  death. CS reduces the levels and/or activity of GCS in pulmonary endothelial cells,
  which leads to 1) increased intracellular levels of proapoptotic ceramide, and 2)
  reduced generation of GlcCer (a prosurvival mediator) in pulmonary endothelial cells.
  Reduced intracellular GlcCer levels lead to decreased activation of the mTOR pathway,
  which causes lysosomal membrane dysfunction (possibly via impaired fusion of lysosomes
  with autophagosomes) and failure to adequately acidify autolysosomes, which impairs
  autophagic flux and induces autophagic cell death. Accumulation of ceramide in the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to ER stress, resulting in apoptosis. Thus, CS-induced
  reductions in intracellular GlcCer levels reduce cell survival by impairing autophagic
  flux to trigger autophagic cell death and promoting apoptosis via ceramide-induced
  ER stress. CDase = ceramidase; S1PP = sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase.
