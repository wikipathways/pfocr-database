caption: 'Functional studies for the localization and functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
  Schematic representation of an infected cell and the localizations/functions of
  the different SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The drawings are based on the articles indicated
  in the figure. Dashed boxes: detailed regions in , B S: spike protein; M: membrane
  protein; N: nucleocapsid. M protein was encountered localizing with actin filaments
  (). SARS-CoV-2 infected Caco-2 cells immunostained for F-actin (white) and M protein
  (red). M protein localizes along and to the tip of filopodia. 1 and 2, dashed box:
  magnification seen in pictures 1 and 2. Scale bar 10 µm; 5 µm in 1 and 2. SARS-CoV-2
  main protease (Mpro) fused to HA tag (Mpro-HA) inhibits the nuclear translocation
  of the NF-κB subunit p65, blocking NF-κB activation (by abolition of NF-kB mediated
  gene transcription by IL-1β) (). LLPS of SARS-CoV-2 N protein recruits TGF-beta-activated
  kinase 1 (TAK1) and IκB kinase (IKK) complex. Schematic representation from Wu et al.
  of SARS-CoV-2 N protein regulating NF-κB signaling pathway by recruiting TAK1 and
  IKKβ through liquid–liquid phase separation. Confocal picture: Huh7 cells stably
  expressing EGFP-N protein, treated with 1 μg/mL poly(I:C) for 6 h, followed by labelling
  IKKβ and DAPI. Scale bars, 5 μm (). Nucleocapsid protein LLPS concentrates SARS-CoV-2
  replication machinery components: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, non-structural protein
  nsp12, accessory sub-units nsp7 and nsp8 (required for transcription) concentrate
  with RNA/N droplets. Confocal picture: SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein associates
  with stress granules, formed through LLPS to maximize replication efficiency. Colocalization
  of Alexa Fluor 488 labeled N-SARS-CoV-2 (green) with stress granule marker G3BP1
  (red) in arsenite-treated digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells. Scale bar: 10 µm ().
  N protein compacts viral RNA via protein-RNA LLPS, and interactions between N protein
  and host RNA-binding proteins are mediated by phase separation (). SARS-CoV-2 N-protein
  undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) with the viral genome, and a model
  of viral packaging through LLPS is proposed (). SARS-CoV-2 double-stranded RNA,
  marker of viral replication, colocalizes with the viral protein nsp3 in the perinuclear
  region (). ORF9b colocalizes with mitochondrial TOM70 and blocks IFN1 production.
  Picture: Confocal microscopy of HEK 293T cells transfected by SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b-Flag.
  Staining with an anti-flag antibody (green) and an anti-TOM70 antibody (red). DAPI
  (blue): nuclei. Scale bar, 10 µm (). (): Confocal microscopy was used to show relocalization
  of AGPAT proteins to SARS-CoV-2 induced DMVs, colocalization of nsp3 (HA-nsp3) with
  PA (Phosphatidic acid) (GFP-PA) and AGPAT (acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase)
  (GFP-AGPAT). CLEM was used to show formation of numerous DMVs. (Transient transfection
  of Huh7 cells with SARS-CoV-2 HA-nsp3-4-V5 expression construct and EGFP-PABD-Raf1-WT
  construct; or transfection with AGPAT2-GFP expressing plasmid and HA-nsp3-4-V5 expression
  construct). SARS-CoV-2 ORF8-HA co-localizes with MHC-I (HLA-A2), mediating MHC-I
  downregulation via degradation. Confocal picture: co-localization of HLA-A2 (red)
  with LAMP1 (green) lysosomes, with LC3 (green) (marker of autophagosomes) and with
  SARS-CoV-2 ORF8-HA (green). Scale bars, 5μm. HEK293T cells were transfected with
  ORF8-HA expressing plasmid (). SARS-CoV-2 N protein forms condensates with viral
  RNA and membrane associated M protein for packaging of the viral RNA ().'
