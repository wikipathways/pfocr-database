caption: 'Strains show high phenotypic variability despite high genomic and metabolic
  pathway conservations. Starch and sucrose metabolism map: boxes represent reactions
  while circles represent compounds. Core reactions are colored blue, variable reactions
  are colored orange or yellow; compounds present in PM plates are filled with gray.
  Red circles around compounds highlight those compounds for which at least one strain
  has an AV difference with another strain equal or higher than 2 AV.'
