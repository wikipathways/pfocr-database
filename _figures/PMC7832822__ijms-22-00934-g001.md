caption: Diagram of the benefit of CISD2-elevating strategies in neurodegenerative
  diseases (NDs). NFκB-provoked inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction underlie
  the pathogenesis of NDs. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the central nervous
  system (CNS) induces neuroinflammation by triggering the activation of microglia,
  astrocytes, and glia-secreted proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Advanced neuroinflammation
  consequently leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and the production of mitochondrial
  damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP), which promote the activation of NLRP3
  inflammasome and subsequently exaggerate neuroinflammation. Through association
  with PPAR-β and prevention of IκB degradation, CISD2 can inhibit NFκB activation
  (red bar). Therapeutic strategies that upregulate CISD2 have the potential to attenuate
  the PPAR-β/IκB/NFκB signaling pathway and mitigate NFκB-provoked inflammation and
  mitochondrial dysfunction implicated in NDs.
