caption: Networks of shear stress-induced OA progression. Mechanisms of PICs and MMPs
  in mediating high fluid shear stress in OA development are summarized. Indeed, the
  increased expression of PICs and MMPs in response to high fluid shear stress is
  believed to play a key role in the development of OA via a COX-2/PGE2-dependent
  pathway at the early stage of the disease. At the late stage of OA, 15d-PGJ2 exerts
  its effects on the pathogenesis of OA by inducing apoptosis but not an inflammatory
  mechanism. However, we could not distinctly segregate the inflammatory mechanism
  from apoptotic mechanism and thoroughly separate OA progression into 2 stages due
  to the roles of PICs in apoptosis.
