caption: Poly(I:C) significantly increased ACE2 and TMPRSS2 possibly via the IFN and
  NFκB signaling pathways in HNECs. Poly(I:C) activates both the IFN and NFκB signaling
  pathways by binding to TLR3, resulting in the induction of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. IFN-β
  upregulates ACE2 expression; however, ACE2 as well as the target genes of the NFκB
  signaling pathway such as TNF-α and IL-6 is suppressed by fluticasone propionate,
  while TMPRSS2 and an interferon-stimulated gene are not. This suggested that ACE2
  in HNECs is regulated not only via the IFN signaling pathway but also via the NFκB
  signaling pathway.
