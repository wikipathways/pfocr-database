caption: Model for the Role of MEKK2 Regulation in Autoimmunity.MPK4 acts downstream
  of MEKK1 and MKK1/2 as a negative regulator of MEKK2 RNA abundance. Activated MPK4
  is required for the repression of MEKK2 expression. In a wild-type plant, MEKK2
  is expressed at a basal level. When the MEKK1-MKK1/2-MPK4 signaling pathway is disrupted,
  MEKK2 abundance increases, which in turn triggers the autoimmune response.
