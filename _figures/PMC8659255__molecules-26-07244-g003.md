caption: Metabolic engineering of Halomonas bluephagenesis TD01 to synthesize P (3HB-co-4HB).
  When using γ-butyrolactone as 4HB precursor, 4-hydroxybutyric acid is converted
  to 4HB-CoA by OrfZ. 3HB-CoA is derived from acetyl-CoA under the action of PhaA
  and PhaB. When using glucose as the sole substrate, it is converted to succinyl-CoA
  via glycolytic pathway and TCA cycle. OgdA catalyzes the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate
  to succinyl-CoA which is further converted to succinate semialdehyde by SucD. Deletion
  of gabD genes prevented the conversion of succinate semialdehyde to succinate. Next,
  succinate semialdehyde is converted to 4-hydroxybutyric acid by 4HbD. Under the
  action of PhaC, 3HB-CoA and 4HB-CoA are polymerized to form P(3HB-co-4HB). OgdA,
