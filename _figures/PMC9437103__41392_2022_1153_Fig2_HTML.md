caption: The IGF1/PI3K/AKT pathway in exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy
  and exercise-induced cardioprotection. Exercise induces IGF1 secretion, which activates
  IGF1R tyrosine kinase followed by recruitment of PI3K. The PI3K through converting
  PIP2 to PIP3 in the plasma membrane, further leads to recruitment of PDK1 and AKT
  to the plasma membrane and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of PDK1 and
  AKT. The activation of IGF1/PI3K/AKT is essential to mediate exercise-induced physiological
  cardiac hypertrophy through promoting cardiomyocyte growth in size. The IGF1/PI3K/AKT
  pathway also exerts cardioprotective effects through promoting cardiomyocyte contractility,
  enhancing survival while reducing apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, inhibiting pathological
  hypertrophy, and promoting angiogenesis. IGF1 insulin growth factor 1, IGFR1 insulin
  growth factor 1 receptor, PI3K phosphoinositide-3 kinase, PIP2 phosphatidylinositol
