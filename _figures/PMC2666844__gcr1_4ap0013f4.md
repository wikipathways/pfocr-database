caption: Simplified schematic diagram of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling.
  IGF-I and IGF-II bind to IGF receptor (IGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),
  with high affinity resulting in phosphorylation of intracellular proteins including
  insulin receptor substrate (IRS). The signal is then conveyed to specific downstream
  effectors such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT/PKB),
  and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. These pathways play crucial
  roles in antiapoptosis as well as cell proliferation. Bioavailability of both IGFs
  is influenced by the presence of IGF binding proteins (IGFBP). New therapeutic agents
  such as AG1024 and gefitinib aim to block this signaling pathway at level of the
  receptor. Downstream targeting agents such as rapamycin, CCI-779, and RAD001 are
  also under investigation.
