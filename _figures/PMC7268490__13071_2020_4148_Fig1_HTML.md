caption: A schematic diagram of experimental workflow. To explore the underlying mechanism
  of MTZ resistance, we conducted quantitative proteomic analysis to profile global
  proteomes of MTZ-S and MTZ-R parasites. iTRAQ combined with LC-MS/MS analysis were
  performed to identify the differentially expressed proteins in the MTZ-R proteome.
  Functional annotations, protein-protein interaction networks and pathway enrichment
  analysis of the differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by GO, STRING and
  GESA, respectively. Proteins potentially associated with MTZ resistance were selected
  for experimental validation
