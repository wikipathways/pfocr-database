caption: 'Anti-tumourigenic JNK signalling. JNK signalling has several different anti-tumourigenic
  roles, which are best understood in the context of scrib–/– clone elimination from
  epithelial tissues. During cell competition, scrib–/– cell elimination depends on
  JNK signalling (rightmost image) – the pathway is activated by both autocrine and
  paracrine Egr and promotes apoptosis via Hid and Rpr, as well as SWH signalling-mediated
  Yki downregulation. JNK signalling is also activated by Rho1 signalling through
  Wnd, and partly depends on an unknown “competition signal” from the wildtype neighbours,
  which itself depends on Yki and Jak-STAT signalling. Jak-STAT signalling is activated
  in wildtype neighbour cells by JNK-mediated Upd family ligand expression in the
  scrib–/– cells, and contributes to their compensatory proliferation. Autocrine JNK
  signalling also promotes scrib–/– cell extrusion from the epithelial layer (lower
  image) – upregulation of the Slit-Robo2-Ena pathway downregulates Shg (E-cadherin)
  and promotes detachment from the tissue, while also upregulating JNK via an F-actin-mediated
  feedback loop. The wildtype neighbour cells are also capable of actively eliminating
  the scrib–/– cells (leftmost image) – JNK signalling activated by Egr promotes engulfment
  behaviours by the wildtype cells, activated via Pvr, Ced-12, and Mbc. However, if
  scrib–/– cells can evade competition, JNK signalling and SWH signalling (if they
  occur) are not capable of downregulating Yki activity to a sufficient degree that
  the cells can be eliminated (central image) – instead, Yki promotes cell survival
  and overproliferation by upregulating targets such as CycE and Diap1. Gene and protein
  name abbreviations used in the diagram are as follows: Eiger (Egr), Grindelwald
  (Grnd), Wengen (Wgn), PDGF- and VEGF-receptor related (Pvr), Myoblast city (Mbc),
  Yorkie (Yki), Cyclin E (CycE), Death-associated inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (Diap1),
  Wallenda (Wnd), reaper (rpr), head involution defective (hid), unpaired 1 (upd1),
  unpaired 2 (upd2), unpaired 3 (upd3), roundabout 2 (robo2), enabled (ena), Shotgun
