caption: Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the mesophilic halophile Haloferax volcanii.
  Glucose is degraded via the spED pathway, and fructose is degraded via the EMP pathway.
  The pathway for fructose degradation is characterized by 1-PFK and FBPA class II;
  the common lower EMP shunt is characterized by two GAPDH isoenzymes that are differently
  regulated in response to the C source () as well as catabolic PK and anabolic PEPS.
  Enzyme reactions with catabolic function are indicated by red arrows, anabolic reactions
  are shown as blue arrows, and reversible reactions are indicated by black arrows.
  Enzymes for which the encoding genes are regulated by the transcriptional regulator
  GlpR are marked (black box). Enzymes for which the encoding genes were up- or downregulated
  in response to the gluconeogenic (Casamino Acids)/glycolytic (glucose) shift are
  depicted as red open arrows in the respective direction (). The net equations of
  glucose conversion to pyruvate via the modified ED pathway and of fructose conversion
  to pyruvate via the modified EMP pathway are depicted in boxes (PTS, PEP-dependent
  phosphotransferase system; KHK, ketohexokinase; 1-PFK, fructose-1-phosphate kinase).
