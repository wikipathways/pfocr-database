caption: Summary of sesquiterpene production in Artemisia annua via the mevalonate
  (MVA) pathway in the cytosol FPP is highlighted as the key precursor not only for
  artemisinin synthesis but also for Squalene and other sequiterpenes. The plastidial
  methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway that leads to monoterpene production is
  also included. enzymes in red have been cloned from A. annua and the sesquiterpene
  synthases and squalene synthases also cloned from A. annua are in blue (DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  diphosphate; GGPP, geranyl geranyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl pyrophosphate; GGPS,
  geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; IDI, isopentyl
  diphosphate isomerase; ABA, abscisic acid; FPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; FPP,
  farnesyl pyrophosphate; AMS, amorpha-4,11-diene synthase; SQS, squalene synthase;
  GAS, germacrene A synthase; ECS, δ-epicederol synthase; CPS, caryophyllene synthase;
  FS, beta farnesene synthase).
