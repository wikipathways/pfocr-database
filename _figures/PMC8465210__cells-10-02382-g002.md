caption: Canonical and alternative NF-κB pathways. As part of the canonical NF-κB
  pathway, the IκB kinase (IKK) complex is activated by phosphorylation. The IKK complex
  then phosphorylates the inhibitor of NF-κBα (IκBα), leading to its degradation by
  the proteasome. This event allows the NF-κB (RelA/c-Rel-p50) dimer to translocate
  to the nucleus. The alternative pathway is initiated when the IKKα homodimer is
  activated by phosphorylation, which phosphorylates the p100 bound to RelB. This
  phosphorylation leads to p100 being degraded by the proteasome to form the RelB-p52
  dimer. This NF-κB (RelB-p52) dimer then translocates to the nucleus. Both RelA/c-Rel-p50
  and RelB-p52 dimers act as transcription factors to up-regulate the expression of
  the downstream oncogenic effectors (e.g., c-myc and cyclin D1) that promote cell
  growth, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis.
