caption: Chemokines and their receptors’ roles in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In
  osteoblastic niche, T-ALL cells are in direct, stable contact with vascular cells
  in the BM that produce CXCL12, while in vascular niche CXCL12 is secreted by several
  stromal cell types, especially CAR cells. Apart from the BM microenvironment, extramedullary
  organs such as the brain and spleen showed high expression of CCL19, which is involved
  in leukemic cells’ infiltration to such sites. CXCL12/CXCR4 triggers the activation
  of downstream kinases Src and ABL1 which are responsible for the phosphorylation
  of RhoGDI2, which released RhoA and RhoC, leading to subsequent cytoskeleton redistribution
  and assembly in the process of migration. CXCR4 could activate both ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt
  pathways to promote the survival of leukemic blasts. In the homing of B cell progenitor
  ALL cells to the BM, CXCL12-mediated activation of p38MAPK was required and ZAP70
  kinase can control the expression of CXCR4 and CCR7 via ERK1/2, which is correlated
  with CNS infiltration during T-ALL. CXCR4 could also activate RAC1 to mediate migration
  and engraftment of B-ALL cells in the BM or testicles. In addition, CXCR4 can induce
  the proliferation of T-ALL cells via Myc. CXCL10/CXCR3 axis may increase survival
  rate of leukemic cells during treatment through stabilizing Bcl-2 and inhibiting
  caspase activation. CXCL10 has also been proved to promote migration of leukemic
  cells via MMP9. The expression of CCR5 and CCR7 is regulated by Notch-1. CCR5 regulate
  leukemic cell’s proliferation and anti-apoptosis through JAK/STAT3 pathway. CCL25/CCR9
  axis increase drug efflux-induced resistance by activating the binding of P-gp and
  ERM. It also facilitates the infiltration through RhoA-Rock-MLC and PI3K/AKT-RhoA
  pathway
