caption: 'The oral administration of A. muciniphila and its EVs affected the serotonin
  pathway through the gut-brain axis in mice. This figure shows major intermediates,
  enzymes, and transporters in serotonin synthesis and clearance. Colonic and hippocampal serotonin
  synthesis increased through interactions with the bacterium and its EVs and upregulation
  of Tph1 gene in the colon and Tph2 gene in the hippocampus. Also, the increased
  serotonin availability in the colon of mice increased SERT expression in both groups.
  Conversely, the SERT expression decreased in the hippocampus of both groups. The
  Mao gene expression reduced following EV treatment in the colon and following both
  treatments in the hippocampus. Treatments with A. muciniphila and its EVs affected
  colonic inflammation and inflammation-related genes. Compounds: 5-HT = serotonin;
  Enzymes & transporters: Tph = Tryptophan hydroxylase, SERT = Serotonin transporter,
  Mao = Monoamine oxidase.'
