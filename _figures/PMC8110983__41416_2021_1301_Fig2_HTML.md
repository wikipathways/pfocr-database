caption: Tumours increasingly metabolise glucose through glycolysis which is increased
  through mutant KRAS-dependent upregulation of glycolytic enzymes (1). Other KRAS-dependent
  metabolic changes promote the use of other carbon sources such as glutamine and
  branched chain amino acids (BCAA) from the breakdown of peripheral tissue, as well
  as other non-essential amino acids from pancreatic stellate cell autophagy, in the
  TCA cycle; substrates from the TCA cycle are used for biosynthesis (2). Together,
  these changes increase survival in a hypoxic and nutrient-deficient environment.
  Tumour-derived cytokines prompt several catabolic effects in peripheral tissues
  (3). Interleukin (IL)-6, TNF or interferon γ (IFNg) induce the breakdown of muscle
  fibres through the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT3) pathway and nuclear factor (NF)-κB-dependent induction of nitric oxide (4)
  which leads to decreased myogenesis through downregulation of the myogenic regulatory
  factor MyoD and increased proteolysis through E3-ligase-dependent ubiquitination
  (5). Similarly, members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily activate
  the canonical Smad2/3 pathway which promotes ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteolysis
  and scleraxis-mediated muscle fibrosis and reduces Akt/mTOR-mediated myogenesis
  (6). Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumour-derived extracellular vesicles induce
  myoblast apoptosis by Toll-like receptor 7-dependent c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling
  (7). In white adipose tissue, pro-inflammatory signals, specifically IL-6, promote
  lipolysis through activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway and NF-kB in adipose tissue
  and induces adipocyte browning through upregulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1)
  (8). Lipolysis through hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) are also mediated by adrenomedullin
  from tumour-derived exosomes which activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) pathway in adipocytes. Exosomal cargoes (other than adrenomedullin) can also
  induce adipocyte browning through UCP-1 expression (9). Lipolysis is maintained
  through paracrine signals in fat tissue liked zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG/LMF) and
  miRNAs which induce adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and HSL catalyse the hydrolysis
  of stored triglycerides (10). In the central nervous system, pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  particularly IL-1β, and macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC)-1 (a member of the
  TGF-β superfamily), induce anorexia by reducing anabolic neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related
  protein (AgRP) and increasing catabolic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine-and-amphetamine
  regulated transcript (CART) signalling (11).
