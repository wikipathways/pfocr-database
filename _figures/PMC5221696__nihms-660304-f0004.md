caption: Instructive regulation of PtdIns 4-OH kinase by Sec14 and TGN/endosomal membrane
  trafficking. A model is drawn where Sec14 interfaces PtdCho metabolism (and consumption
  of the pro-secretory lipid DAG) with the amplitude of PtdIns4P pro-secretory signaling
  in the yeast TGN/endosomal membrane trafficking pathway. Sec14 serves as a sensor
  for flux through the CDP-choline pathway for PtdCho biosynthesis and, via PtdCho
  binding and activation of heterotypic exchange cycles, stimulates activity of the
  Pik1 PtdIns 4-OH kinase to produce PtdIns4P in response to CDP-choline pathway activity.
  Cellular activities whose loss of function result in ‘bypass Sec14’ are highlighted
  in red (see text).
