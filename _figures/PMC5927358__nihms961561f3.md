caption: 'Wnt/TOR and Wnt/STOP signaling pathways. (Left) In the Wnt/TOR pathway,
  in the absence of Wnt ligands, GSK3β phosphorylates and activates TSC2, which, in
  turn, inhibits mTORC1 activity. Binding of the Wnt protein to its receptor and coreceptor
  leads to sequestration of the destruction complex, including GSK3β, into multivesicular
  bodies. This prevents activation of TSC2, leading to activation of mTORC1 and promotion
  of protein translation. (Right) In the Wnt/STOP pathway, the activity of GSK3β promotes
  phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of a multitude of target proteins. Upon
  Wnt ligand binding and sequestration of GSK3β into multivesicular bodies, these
  GSK3β-target proteins are no longer targeted for degradation and accumulate in the
  cytoplasm. Abbreviations: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CK1α, casein kinase 1α;
  Dvl, Dishevelled; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; LRP, lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; mTORC1, mTOR complex 1; TSC2, tuberous
  sclerosis complex 2; Wnt/STOP, Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins; Wnt/TOR,
  Wnt-dependent regulation of mTOR.'
