caption: 'Key enzymes of glucose metabolism (gluconeogenesis, green arrows), DNL (blue
  arrows), and FAO (orange arrows) are activated by TH (in red). Glycolysis is a metabolic
  pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. Gluconeogenesis is the metabolic process
  that synthesizes glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. TH regulates key enzymes
  involved in these pathways, including G6PC and PEPCK. PEPCK is the rate-limiting
  step of gluconeogenesis and catalyzes the reaction of oxaloacetate to PEP. DNL is
  the process by which glucose or other carbohydrates are converted to fatty acids
  for triglyceride synthesis. Key enzymes activated by TH in this process include
  ACC, which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA in the first
  step of DNL. Downstream of this reaction, FASN catalyzes the formation of palmitate,
  a long-chain fatty acid. Conversely, FAO is the process by which long-chain fatty
  acids are oxidized for energy during energy-deficient states. TH acts on CPT1, the
  rate-limiting enzyme of FAO. Additional enzymes regulated by TH critical for FAO
  include PDK4 and UCP2. Abbreviations: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; CPT1, carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1; DNL, de novo lipogenesis; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; FASN,
  fatty acid synthetase; PDK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1; TH, thyroid hormone; UCP2, uncoupling
  protein 2'
