caption: The intracellular signaling pathway of IL-33R. When IL-33 binds to ST2, IL-1RAcp
  is recruited to form a ligand-receptor complex, generating the minimum IL-33 receptor
  complex. The complex binds to the intracellular TIR domain and activates IRAK1,
  IRAK4, MyD88, and TRAF6. IRAKs induce the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α
  to generate NF-κB, subsequently activating the MAPK signaling pathway, which involves
  ERK1/2, P38, and JNK, and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Transcription factors NF-κB
  and AP-1 induce target gene expression in response to IL-33. Except for the classic
  shared mechanism of the IL-1R family, IL-33 interacts with IL-2, IL-7, and TSLP
  to mediate gene expression in a STAT5-dependent manner. In mast cells, the formation
  of this receptor complex also requires the presence of c-kit. FcƐR1 and ST2 jointly
  activate nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) by mobilizing intracellular
  Ca2+. In mouse peritoneal macrophages, the activation of NF-κB induced by IL-33
  is dependent on JAK2. IL-33 mediates various cytokine or chemokine expressions through
  classic and exclusive signaling pathways in different immune cells, such as IL-4,
  IL-5, and IL-13 in Th2 cells, CCL4, CXCL8, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 in mast cells,
  which have been summarized in . sST2 is the most critical antagonist of IL-33 identified
  so far.
