caption: Fas apoptotic pathway. Patients with ALPS have defective Fas-mediated apoptosis.
  During downregulation of the immune response, activated B and T lymphocytes upregulate
  expression of Fas ligand, and activated T lymphocytes up-regulate expression of
  Fas. Fas ligand and Fas interact, activating the intracellular Fas-associated death
  domain (FADD) and triggering the caspase cascade with subsequent proteolysis, DNA
  degradation, and apoptosis. Apoptotic signalling mediated by Fas is part of the
  extrinsic pathway as it is activated through engangement of cell surface death receptors.
  The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated by cellular stressors, leading to alterations
  in mitochondrial membrane permeability and release of apoptosis-inducing substances.
