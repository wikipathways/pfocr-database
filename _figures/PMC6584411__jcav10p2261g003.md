caption: SNORA71A co-expression network. (A) Construction of PPI network for SNORA71A
  co-expressing networks. Interaction network of GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
  of hub genes in the blue module. The circle size of each node presented the connectivity
  degree in the weighted gene co-expression network, and different colors represented
  different GO or KEGG pathways. (B) The top 20 biological processes of SNORA71A co-expressed
  genes in the blue module were listed. (C) KEGG pathway analysis indicated the pathway
  of SNORA71A co-expressed genes in the blue module.
