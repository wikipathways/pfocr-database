caption: Schematic depicting the effects of tyramine and FLP-18 on behavior (A) and
  the underlying molecular pathway (B). Touch leads to the activation of the AVA (not
  pictured) and RIM neurons resulting in the release of FLP-18 and tyramine (RIM only)
  during the escape response. Tyramine activates LGC-55 chloride channels which hyperpolarize
  AVB neurons and neck muscle. Hyperpolarization of the AVB suppresses forward locomotion,
  indirectly increasing reversal length, while hyperpolarization of neck muscle leads
  to the suppression of head oscillations (SHO) during the reversal. Tyramine also
  activates the Gαo coupled SER-2 receptor in GABAergic VD motor neurons enhancing
  ventral bending during the omega turn. FLP-18 activates NPR-5 in neck and body wall
  muscle resulting in an EGL-30/Gαq mediated Ca2+ influx. FLP-18 antagonizes the effect
  of tyramine in neck muscles, facilitating the re-initiation of head movements following
  the omega turn. FLP-18 and tyramine act synergistically on divergent targets to
  orchestrate the omega turn. FLP-18 increases forward run velocity in an NPR-5 dependent
  manner. See text for details.
