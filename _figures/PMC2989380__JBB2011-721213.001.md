caption: 'Potential metabonomic targets for bioactive food components during glucose
  metabolism in cancer cells.  Cancer cells metabolize glucose and glutamine more
  than normal cells to support the de novo biosynthesis of nucleotides and energy
  required for the high rate of cell proliferation.  Tumor-specific PKM2 determines
  the ratio of glucose metabolism between glycolysis and PPP, whereas GLUT1 and TK
  play critical roles in energy production in neoplastic cells via the TCA cycle and
  glutaminolysis, respectively.  Each of these pathways is modulated by specific bioactive
  food components (see text). BFCs: bioactive food components; PKM2: pyruvate kinase
  M2 isoform; PPP: pentose phosphate pathway; TK: tyrosine kinase; GLUT1: glucose
  transporter 1; TCA: tricarboxylic acid.'
