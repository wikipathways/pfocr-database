caption: Schematic model for the possible E2 uptake pathways in leukocytes. (A) In
  human, SHBG is mainly produced by the liver than released into the bloodstream.
  From the bloodstream SHBG can be sequestered into various tissues, including lymphoid
  tissues. (B) According to the’free hormone hypothesis’, the transport of E2 through
  the plasma membrane takes place by passive diffusion. The classical cytoplasmic
  forms of ERα and ERβ – upon binding the hormone – act as inducers/regulators of
  transcription in the nucleus. (Pathway 1). E2, dissociated from SHBG, can also bind
  to a cell surface receptor (mER) and induce rapid signal transduction events such
  as increase of intracellular cAMP and calcium levels, activation of ERK, MAPK, PI3K
  or Akt pathways. It can also be internalized and either used by metabolizing enzymes
  or act as a regulator of transcription through classical ERs. In the investigated
  immune cells either the truncated ERα46, as an integral membrane protein, or other
  palmitoylated, membrane-associated forms of ERs, and GPR30 may also function as
  mER (Pathway 2). SHBG with the bound E2 can bind to a membrane receptor and be internalized
  through an endocytic pathway. One possible candidate for this receptor (RSHBG) is
  ERα46, which is expressed in human lymphocytes and monocytes. In other cell types
  (such as neurons, fibroblasts, etc.), megalin (LRP2) may also function as RSHBG
  (Pathway 3).
