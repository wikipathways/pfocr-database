caption: mTORC1 inhibits various steps of autophagy. mTORC1 phosphorylates and inhibits
  ULK1 and Atg13 which are part of the ULK complex, thereby blocking autophagy initiation
  step. mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of Atg14, AMBRA1, and NRBF2 from the PI3KC3
  complex I, which is one of the PI3KC3 complexes, negatively regulates autophagosomal
  nucleation step. mTORC1 also affects maturation of autophagosome through inhibitory
  phosphorylation of UVRAG. TFEB and TFE3 are transcription factors critical for lysosomal
  biogenesis and expression of autophagy genes. Different steps in the autophagy process
  are illustrated and denoted in blue. Bold letters in different complexes denote
  proteins that are phosphorylated by mTORC1.
