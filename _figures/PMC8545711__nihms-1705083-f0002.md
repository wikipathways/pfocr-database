caption: 'In the Cancer Immunity Cycle [], DCs in the tumor take up tumor antigens
  and traffic to the tumor draining LN (dLN), where they encounter rare naïve tumor
  antigen-specific (referred to as tumor-specific) CD8+ T cells. If the activation
  conditions are appropriate, these tumor-specific CD8+ T cells will become activated,
  proliferate and differentiate into effector cells. In the tumor dLN, the PD-1 pathway
  plays a critical role in regulating initial T cell priming and effector differentiation.
  Loss of PD-1 signals promotes T cell expansion and effector differentiation within
  the tumor dLN. Following activation, T cells traffic to the tumor through the blood.
  Because the blood is a major route of immune cell trafficking, it is useful for
  assaying anti-tumor T cell responses en route to the tumor. New CD8+ T cell clones
  trafficking from blood to the tumor are associated with better responses to anti-PD-1.
  In the tumor, the PD-1 pathway inhibits both CD8+ T cells and Treg cells. Recruitment
  of new CD8+ T cells from the periphery into the tumor is associated with better
  responses to PD-1 blockade, and loss of PD-1 signals has a greater impact on the
  proliferation of progenitor-like exhausted T cells (TEX) than terminally exhausted
  TEX. The outcome of PD-1 blockade is a balance between enhanced CD8+ T cell responses
  and increased Treg suppressive activity, and protective anti-tumor immune responses
  following PD-1 blockade are often associated with an increased ratio of CD8+ T cells
  to Treg cells numerically. Abbreviations used in the Figure: PD-1 = Programmed Death-1,
  TEX = exhausted CD8+ T cells, dLN = tumor draining lymph node. This Figure was created
  with BioRender.com.'
