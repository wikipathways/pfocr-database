caption: Models depicting the proposed functions of the FA protein interaction network
  in the repair of stalled or collapsed DNA replication forks. Upon encounter of a
  DNA lesion on the template strand during DNA replication several options are possible.
  (A) To ensure timely replication fork progression, the template strand DNA lesion
  can be bypassed in an error-prone REV1- and/or DNA Pol ζ-dependent TLS mechanism.
  The FA core complex is required for the assembly of REV1 nuclear foci, suggesting
  that the FA core complex may specifically promote error-prone REV1-dependent TLS.
  This pathway appears to be independent of both PCNA and FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination.
  The molecular details of FA core complex promoted REV1-dependent TLS remain to be
  fully elucidated. (B) The DNA replisome may arrest at the lesion and subsequently
  resume DNA synthesis downstream of the lesion. The ensuing post-replicative gap
  (or daughter-strand gap) may be repaired by a combined HR/TLS PCNA mono-ubiqutination-dependent
  mechanism. We propose that the mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI may also
  be required for this process by an as-yet-undefined mechanism.
