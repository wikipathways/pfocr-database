caption: AGEs are endogenously synthesized by a non-enzymatic reaction involving a
  glycation/condensation process between reducing sugars and the free amino group
  of different biomolecules to form Schiff bases, which are subsequently converted
  to Amadori products. Degradation of both Schiff bases (Nakimi pathway) and Amadori
  products (non-oxidative cleavage) renders the main intermediate compounds in the
  formation of AGEs. These highly reactive intermediates are also formed by other
  metabolic intermediates
