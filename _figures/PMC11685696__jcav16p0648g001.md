caption: Physiological functions and mechanisms of the intestinal mucosal barrier.
  The intestinal barrier encompasses physical barrier, chemical barrier, immune barrier,
  and microbial barrier. The physical barrier is constituted by the intestinal absorptive
  cells, Paneth cells, and goblet cells that constitute the intestinal mucosal epithelium
  and the intercellular connections, which physically hinder microbial components
  from entering the intestine. The chemical barrier is primarily composed of the mucus
  layer consisting of digestive fluids, various digestive enzymes, lysozyme, bile
  acids, and mucins, which is capable of decomposing large molecular substances and
  bacterial components. The immune barrier is composed of the mucosal-associated lymphoid
  tissue (MALT) and diffuse immune cells, among which include Peyer's patches, follicular
  dendritic cells, and intraepithelial lymphocytes in the mucosa. It can recognize
  antigens, phagocytize viruses and intestinal pathogens, present antigens to immune
  cells, and generate humoral immunity and cellular immunity. The microbial barrier
  comprises the microorganisms and microbial metabolites residing in the intestine,
  and the commensal bacteria modulate the colonization of pathogenic bacteria by inhibiting
  their growth, consuming nutrients, generating bacteriocins, and influencing cell
  signaling pathways
