caption: 'Proposed halogen reaction cycles involved in the immune defense against
  pathogens and in the inflammatory process. The amplified reactions of reactive halogen
  species (RHS), including HOX, OX−, X2, X• and OX• (X = Cl, Br or I), produced by
  dissociative electron transfer (DET) within the phagosome cause major damage (represented
  by RX/RNX) to the DNA/RNA/lipids/proteins of phagocytosed pathogens. The immune
  defence system consists mainly of three components: the H2O2signaling pathway as
  the trigger, the RHS reaction cycles as the amplifier, and the NO•signaling pathway
  as the terminator. H2O2 from other intracellular organelles such as mitochondria
  and peroxisomes can also diffuse across membranes and promote the anti-pathogen
  activity.'
