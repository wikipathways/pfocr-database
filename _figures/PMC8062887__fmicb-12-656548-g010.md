caption: The crosstalk between HsfA-Hsp90 and CWI pathway in A. fumigatus during HS.
  The CWI pathway is activated during early adaptation to HS, possibly via MidA mechanosensor
  located at the cell membrane. This signal funnels into Rom2, a guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor, and the small Rho GTPAse Rho1, leading to the activation of PkcA
  and the CWI pathway. These events culminate with the phosphorylation of the MAP
  kinase MpkA, which, in turn, phosphorylates the transcription factor RlmA, thus
  activating the transcription of genes (+) important for thermotolerance, cell wall
  integrity, and remodeling. The CWI pathway proteins PkcA, MpkA, and RlmA are constitutive
  Hsp90 clients. A direct consequence of the HS is the thickening of the cell wall
  after 5 min of temperature increase, which may have consequences to the remodeling
  of the cell wall and exposure of carbohydrate to the cell surface. However, these
  consequences remain to be investigated (red question marks). Also, the cellular
  plasma membrane becomes more fluid in response to thermal insult. Although not necessary
  for HsfA activation, PkcA and MpkA negatively regulate the expression of HsfA and
  Hsp90, both during the HS (dashed blue arrows) and upon cell wall stress induced
  by caspofungin (not shown in the Figure; see text for details). The resulting increase
  in protein abundance of HsfA and Hsp90 in the pkcA and mpkA mutants possibly occurs
  via undescribed compensatory mechanisms accompanied by the activation of additional
  signaling cascades to retain the CWI and thermotolerance (purple dashed line). In
  the face of heat stress, mRNA abundance of HsfA increases and triggers the expression
  of genes related to thermotolerance, cell wall integrity, cell wall remodeling,
  lipid, and iron metabolism. One of its transcriptional targets, Hsp90, is also induced
  to deal with HS and assist the stabilization of client proteins. After about 15–30
  min of HS, the HsfA levels decrease, possibly due to the action of Hsp90 in the
  regulatory feedback loop. This regulatory mechanism comprises the Hsf1/Hsp90 protein–protein
  interaction (not investigated here), which is reversed during the HS, when Hsp90
  protein levels increase and decouple from Hsf1 to assist the folding of client proteins.
  The activity of Hsf1 remains until Hsp90 again binds to Hsf1, negatively regulating
  Hsf1 (see text for details). Hyperphosphorylation (not investigated here) is another
  regulatory event that modulates the transcriptional activity of HsfA orthologs in
  other fungal pathogens. The protein(s) kinase(s) responsible for HsfA phosphorylation
  are still unknown in A. fumigatus. This diagram is based on data from this article
  and the references (; ; , ).
