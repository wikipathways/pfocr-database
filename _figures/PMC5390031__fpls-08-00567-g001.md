caption: Schematic representation of probable role of miRNA during isoflavonoid biosynthetic
  pathway in soybean seed. Text in blue color represents key metabolites of the isolavonoid
  pathway. Enzymes targeted by newly identified soybean miRNAs are highlighted by
  red line. Dotted line represents unclear role of miRNA in the pathway. Reaction
  catalyzed by the same type of enzyme is shown with same color while other enzymes
  are mentioned in black color. The competing pathways that share the naringenin and
  daidzein substrate are in black color. FNS, flavone synthase; F3H, flavone 3-hydroxylase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; ANS, Anthocyanidin synthase;
  LAR, Flavon-3,4diol 4-reductase.
