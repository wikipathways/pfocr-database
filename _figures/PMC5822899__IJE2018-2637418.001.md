caption: 'Schematic illustration of the main intracellular pathways and the effects
  of drugs used in dyslipidemia and obesity in (A) differentiation of preadipocytes
  into mature adipocytes. This process is on dependence of the PKA pathway, which
  activates transcriptional factors such as C/EBPB, C/EBPd, C/EBPa, and PPARG that
  ultimately lead to increase of adipogenesis gene expression. Statins and liraglutide
  inhibit adipogenesis while niacin and fibrates stimulate, by inducing upregulation
  of adipogenesis genes (∗leptin; adiponectin, FABP4, perilipin, and GLUT4, SCD1)
  expression and (B) immune and endocrine functions of WAT. Adipocyte exerts autocrine
  and paracrine actions, through secreting adipokines and also endocrine actions in
  distant organs. Most of the drugs exhibit an anti-inflammatory role through modulation
  of adipokine expression. Through modulation of leucocyte chemotaxis, they also affect
  NK cell activity and macrophage phagocytosis. See text for more details. →: stimulates;
