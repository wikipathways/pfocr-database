caption: Schematic representation of the Ca2+ signals that influence the activity
  of BK and SK channels in UBSM to control the membrane potential. Depolarization
  during an action potential activates VDCCs, resulting in Ca2+ influx and a subsequent
  increase in average cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. Local Ca2+signalling from RyRs to BK channels
  (Ca2+ spark) is indicated (; ). Distant Ca2+signalling from VDCCs to RyRs is also
  shown (; this study). Activity of BK and SK channels depends on Ca2+ entry through
  VDCCs, although it is not known if this communication is local or distant. Pharmacological
  compounds used in this study to inhibit each pathway are indicated in italics. Although
  they were not a focus of the present study and they are not indicated on this diagram,
  KV channels also regulate UBSM action potential repolarization.
