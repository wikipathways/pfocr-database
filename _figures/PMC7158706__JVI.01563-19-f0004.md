caption: Upregulation of interferon signaling pathways. (A) Pathway image from IPA
  core analysis illustrating gene expression associated with interferon signaling.
  (B) The molecular activity prediction (MAP) tool indicates the potential outcomes
  of activating the interferon signaling. The color intensity indicates the degree
  of upregulation (red). Predicted activation (orange), inhibition (blue), and unknown
  association (yellow) are also shown. Gray indicates molecules that were present
  in the data set but did not pass the cutoff values of a false discovery rate (FDR)
  of ≤0.05 and a log2 fold change (FC) of either ≥1 or ≤−1. (C) Individual populations
  (red and yellow) were sorted, and STAT1 gene expression was measured by RT-PCR at
  2 weeks postinfection. Data are mean fold changes ± standard error of mean (SEM)
  compared to D116A-infected cells. Data are cumulative for three individual astrocyte
  donors. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post
  hoc test for multiple comparisons (*, P < 0.05).
