caption: 'Dictyostelid signalling pathways evolved from an amoebozoan stress response.
  (A). In solitary amoebas, starvation or drought stress increases intracellular cAMP
  levels to activate (PKA), which induces the transition from growing trophozoite
  into walled dormant cyst. The cAMP phosphodiesterase, RegA, inhibits this process
  by hydrolysing cAMP; it bears a conserved response regulator domain that is the
  target for phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by sensor histidine kinases/phosphatase
  (SHK/Ps) that, respectively, activate/inactivate the hydrolytic activity. The signal
  module of SHK/Ps, RegA, PKA, and AcrA is conserved throughout Amoebozoa. (B,C) In
  the multicellular Dictyostelids, this stress pathway came under control of signals
  exchanged between the cells that regulate the differentiation of walled spores and
  stalk cells. See main text for details. Other abbreviations: AcrA, AcgA, AcaA: adenylate
  cyclases R, G, and A; PKA: cAMP-dependent protein kinase; cAR: cell surface cAMP
  receptor; DhkC: sensor histidine kinase C; DhkA: sensor histidine phosphatase A;
  TagC: tight aggregate C—a protease; AcbA: acetyl-coA-binding protein A, the precursor
  of SDF2: spore differentiation factor 2—a peptide; DIF-1: differentiation factor
