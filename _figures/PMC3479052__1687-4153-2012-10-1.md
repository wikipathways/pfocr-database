caption: 'Positive and negative regulations in the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway. The diagram
  shows the logical relationships among the principal components of the Ras/cAMP/PKA
  pathway. The switch cycle of Ras2 protein between its inactive state (Ras2-GDP)
  and active state (Ras2-GTP) is regulated by the activity of Cdc25 (a) and Ira2 (b).
  The intracellular ratio of GTP and GDP also contributes to the regulation of the
  activity of Ras proteins (a), since Cdc25 stimulates the exchange of these nucleotides
  on Ras according to their relative concentration. Ras2-GTP controls the activity
  of the adenylate cyclase Cyr1 (c), which mediates the synthesis of the second messenger
  cAMP (d). cAMP activates PKA (e) by binding to its regulatory subunits and releasing
  its catalytic subunits. The degradation of cAMP is governed by Pde1 (i) and Pde2
  (j), which constitute a major negative feedback in this pathway, as they both contribute
  to decrease the intracellular level of the second messenger. The active form of
  PKA exerts three main regulations in this pathway through the phosphorylation of
  different components: a positive regulation of Pde1 (h) and of Ira2 (g), and a negative
  regulation of Cdc25 (f). Since the increased activity of the phosphorylated forms
  of both Pde1 and Ira2 result in switching off the signal—that is, they both contribute
  to reducing the intracellular level of cAMP—due either to a faster degradation of
  cAMP by Pde1 (i) or to a diminished fraction of active Ras2 by Ira2 proteins (b),
  these two positive regulations actually have the effect of a negative feedback control
  on the whole pathway. The negative regulation of Cdc25 by PKA results in a partial
  inactivation of the GEF activity (a), and thus a reduced activation of the Ras2
  protein, which results in a decreased activity of the adenylate cyclase and therefore
  contributes to lowering the cAMP level.'
