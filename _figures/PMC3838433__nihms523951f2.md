caption: Within the iron uptake pathway, IrtAB [,] and Esx-3 [] are thought to be
  involved in iron-mycobactin retrieval, while MmpS4/L4 and MmpS5/L5 are thought to
  be involved in mycobactin export []. Within the heme uptake pathway, Rv0203 may
  function as a hemophore, MmpL3 and MmpL11 are the proposed heme transport proteins
  and MhuD is the heme-degrading protein.
