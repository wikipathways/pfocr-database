caption: Cytokine Storm and ALI/ARDS Induced by Influenza Virus Infection. When a
  highly pathogenic influenza A virus infects alveolar epithelial cells, macrophages
  recognize this virus using TLR 7, which involves several adaptor molecules and transcription
  factors, such as MyD88, and activates IRF7 and NF-κB. Influenza A virus can also
  be recognized by RIG 1 via the adaptor molecule IPD-I and activate IRF3 and NF-κB.
  The activation of IRF-7 and IRF-3 causes their translocation into the nucleus. This
  produces interferon type I, while NF-κB acts as a transcription factor to induce
  pro-inflammatory cytokines’ production, including IL-6, TNFα, and pro-IL-1β. Macrophages
  also present virus peptides on the cell surface through MHC class II and activate
  lymphocyte CD4 T cells, which differentiate into Th1. Activated lymphocyte T cells
  then release various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemoattractants. All of these
  mechanisms result in a cytokine storm. The cytokine storm then leads to ARDS, characterized
  by necrosis, tissue damage, an influx of leucocytes, and blood vessel dilation,
  causing edema fluids to accumulate in the alveolar, characterized by tissue hypoxia
  and hypoxemia. The damaged tissue releases HMGB1 and binds with RAGE, activating
  the intracellular signaling pathway and resulting in NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory
  gene expression induction; thus, the cytokine storm continues. We created this figure
  using the BioRender online app and license.
