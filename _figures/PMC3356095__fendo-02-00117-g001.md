caption: Allopregnanolone (APα) mechanism of action promotes neurogenesis. (1) APα
  activates the GABA type A receptor to initiate the efflux of chloride ions (Cl−)
  from neural progenitor and neural stem cells. (2) Extrusion of Cl− from the intracellular
  compartment leads to membrane depolarization and activation of the voltage dependent
  L-type calcium channel. (3) The intracellular calcium (Ca++) rise activates Ca++dependent
  kinases that ultimately lead to regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis
  of cell cycle proteins. (4) Involving the transcription factor cyclic AMP response
  element binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway, APα up-regulates the expression
  of cell cycle genes that promote neural progenitor mitosis while simultaneously
  down regulating genes that repress cell division. (5) The mechanism of APα-induced
  neurogenesis takes advantage of the developmentally regulated direction of Cl− flux
  to induce neurogenesis in those cells that are phenotypically competent to divide
  while not activating those mechanisms in mature neurons (Wang et al., ; Brinton
  and Wang, ). Adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells (BrdU+ cells immunolabeled
  green; NeuN+ cells are colored red; coronal section of mouse hippocampal dentate
  gyrus; scale bar = 50 μm) in the image above are shown as an illustrative example
  of neurogenesis within the mouse dentate gyrus subgranular zone (SGZ). Newly born
  granule cells proliferate and develop into neurons and glia along the border between
  the hilus and the granule cell layer. Migration (through the vertical space of the
  granule cell layer (GCL); arrows indicate sequence of temporal development) and
  integration of these cells occurs within the days and weeks following proliferation.
  Newly born neurons that survive will continue to mature and send axonal projections
  to form mossy fiber synapses in the CA3 subfield and dendrites to extend into the
  molecular cell layer (MCL) to receive glutamatergic afferents from the perforant
  pathway of the entorhinal cortex.
