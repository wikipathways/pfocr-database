caption: Schematic drawing depicting possible signaling pathways mediating LPS-elicited
  acute and chronic neuroinflammation. The TLR4 signaling pathway plays a critical
  role in initiating LPS-elicited acute neuroinflammation but may not be sufficient
  to maintain chronic neuroinflammation. This study revealed that the activation of
  the MAC1-NOX2-ERK1/2 pathway is essential in the initiation/maintenance of chronic
  neuroinflammation and in triggering the resultant neuronal loss. Further evidence
  indicates that the coupling of MAC1 and its downstream effector NOX2 is essential
  in maintaining sustained reactive microgliosis and chronic neuroinflammation. During
  the chronic neuroinflammatory stage, continuing activation of MAC1 by DAMPs primarily
  released from damaged/dying neurons triggers long-lasting ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
  which further activates NOX2. The MAC1-NOX2 axis activation in microglia produces
  superoxide and ROS to cause oxidative stress, forming a vicious feedforward cycle
  to maintain the reactive microgliosis. Continuing operation of this vicious cycle
  serves as a critical driving force to sustain low-grade neuroinflammation and drive
  neurodegeneration.
