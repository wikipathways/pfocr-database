caption: 'The Role of NADPH in Insulin Secretion from Pancreatic β-Cells. This diagram
  provides a detailed representation of the biochemical pathways involved in insulin
  secretion within a pancreatic β-cell. Glucose uptake through the Glucose transporter
  2 (GLUT2) transporter initiates a series of metabolic reactions, starting with glycolysis
  and leading to the production of ATP, which causes the closure of ATP-sensitive
  potassium channels and subsequent cell depolarization. This depolarization triggers
  the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to enter the
  cell and stimulate the exocytosis of insulin from secretory vesicles. The figure
  also illustrates the critical role of NADPH in this process: it is generated by
  the G6PD reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway and is utilized for the regeneration
  of GSH, with GSH facilitating insulin granule exocytosis via SENP1. Additionally,
  NADPH produced by NNT in mitochondria also promotes insulin release. However, NADPH
  is consumed by NADPH oxidase to ROS, which can inhibit the insulin secretion process.
