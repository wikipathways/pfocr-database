caption: 'A schematic depiction of the design and mechanisms of blood–brain barrier
  (BBB) transmigration of three emerging brain delivery technologies: BBB-crossing
  antibodies (a), brain-tropic adenoviral vectors (b) and engineered extracellular
  vesicles (c, d). a BBB-crossing antibodies are raised against a select number of
  BBB receptors that undergo receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) (Table ). Therapeutic
  antibodies (TH-Ab)  or other therapeutic cargoes, bio-engineered to incorporate
  BBB-crossing function, internalize via clathrin-coated vesicles and are trafficked
  through the early endosome pathway, including multivesicular bodies (MVB). They
  are released on the abluminal side of the BBB, as free antibodies or, in some cases,
  via exosomes, where therapeutic cargoes engage central targets (such as misfolded
  proteins or receptors on parenchymal cells) or replace missing molecules (for example
  growth factors or enzymes). The carrier receptor is recycled back to the luminal
  membranes via recycling endosomes to accept new cargoes from the circulatory compartment.
  b Brain-tropic and non-brain-tropic AAVs, AAV9 and AAV2 respectively, recognize
  discrete receptors on brain endothelial cells that initiate internalization. Thereafter,
  distinct intracellular trafficking routes are utilized by AAV9 and AAV2, with the
  former undergoing active transcytosis across the BBB and the later peri-nuclear/nuclear
  localization and transduction of the endothelial cells. Following transcytosis across
  the BBB, AAV9 is taken up by and subsequently transduces parenchymal cells. AAV9
  is also capable of spreading within the brain by anterograde, retrograde and trans-synaptic
  neuronal transport. c Exosomes can be used as brain delivery vehicles in either
  their natural or in engineered forms. They can be loaded with various gene-based
  (siRNA, miRNA, DNA) and protein-based (antibodies, peptides) biotherapeutics. Specific
  targeting ligands are genetically engineered into the exosomal membranes in producing
  cells to achieve BBB crossing and/or drug delivery to target cells. d Natural exosomes
  may internalize into brain endothelial cells by fusion with the plasma membrane
  and release their cargoes into endothelial cells. Exosomes expressing RMT ligands
  likely undergo clathrin-dependent endocytosis, trafficking and abluminal release.
  Transcytosing exosomes could target parenchymal cells or release their cargo into
  the brain extracellular space. AAV adeno-associated virus, MVB multivesicular body;
