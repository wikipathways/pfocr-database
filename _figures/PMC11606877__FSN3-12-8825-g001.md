caption: 'Anticancer role of RES against NMSC: Focusing on oxidative stress, cellular,
  and molecular mechanisms. RES exhibits chemopreventive and antineoplastic capabilities
  against NMSC. It does so by triggering apoptosis in cancerous cells, inhibiting
  proliferation, and regulating inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. The research
  highlighted in the manuscript indicates that a synergistic lipid‐nanocarrier incorporating
  RES and 5‐FU showed significantly enhanced effectiveness in curtailing the proliferation
  of malignant cells, notably in the A431 cell line, compared to traditional formulations.
  This figure indicates that RES increases the expression of mir‐126, which in turn
  leads to decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as inhibition
  of the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway'
