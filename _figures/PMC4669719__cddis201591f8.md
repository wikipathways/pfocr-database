caption: Schematic diagram of the NRG1-ERBB4-NRG1 autocrine pathway. Genetic manipulation
  of ERBB4 into MSC provides irreplaceable partner to ERBB2, the latter of which forms
  an ERBB2/ERBB4 heterodimer that binds to its ligand NRG1. ERBB4 can bind to NRG1
  by forming a homodimer. Activation of the NRG1-ERBB pathway in MSC-ERBB4 enhances
  cell mobility and anti-apoptosis through the phosphorylation of Akt. Overexpressing
  ERBB4 in turn regulates the synthesis and secretion of NRG1. The released NRG1 contributes
  to restore the declined NRG1 level in the infarcted region and support cell growth,
  dividing and anti-apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. By ERBB4 overexpression in MSCs,
  we figured out a novel approach that benefits both MSCs and cardiomyocytes, and
  enable an effective myocardial repair after ischemia
