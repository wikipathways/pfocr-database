caption: Overview of oxidative stress. Lipid peroxides serve multiple functions in
  cellular physiology, including the inhibition of autophagy via the mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR), pathway and the promotion of selective autophagy to eliminate
  damaged organelles. During apoptosis, peroxidized fatty acids enhance the permeability
  of the mitochondrial outer membrane, leading to the release of cytochrome c and
  subsequent cell death. Additionally, lipid peroxides are involved in ferroptosis
  and act as danger signals that activate proinflammatory pathways. In the immune
  response, lipid peroxides bind to immune cell receptors such as Toll‐like receptor
  4 (TLR4) to activate the NF‐κB signaling pathway, enhance the inflammatory response,
  and promote recruitment and activation of macrophages and T cells. Protein oxidation
  occurs primarily due to ROS and other oxidants, resulting in the oxidative modification
  of specific amino acid residues, which disrupt protein functions and contribute
  to cellular signaling and metabolic dysfunction. This oxidative damage modifies
  protein–protein interactions and can impair cellular pathways. In terms of DNA,
  oxidative damage primarily leads to base modifications and strand breaks, with notable
  products like 8‐OHdG exhibiting high mutagenic potential. Cells respond to oxidative
  DNA damage by activating repair mechanisms, including base excision repair, which
  involves a coordinated effort of specific repair enzymes. The accumulation of oxidative
  mutations has significant implications for tumorigenesis, while oxidative damage
  is also a contributing factor in neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria, as the
  energy centers of the cell, produce ATP through the ETC, but oxidative stress can
  lead to excessive ROS production, causing mitochondrial dysfunction and increased
  cell death. This figure was created with BioRender (https://biorender.com/)
