caption: SARM1 is a central executioner of axon death via a multicomposite catabolic
  reaction typical of multifunctional NAD(P) glycohydrolases(A) Programmed axon degeneration
  is a widespread axon death mechanism driven by activation of SARM1 NAD(P)ase and
  prevented by its negative regulator NMNAT2, a short half-life enzyme essential to
  convert NMN into NAD. NMNAT2 forms together with the upstream enzyme NAMPT a key
  two-step pathway for NAD salvage in mammals that also provides metabolic conversion
  of the prodrug vacor into the neurotoxic, recently discovered, VMN intermediate.
  When NMNAT2 in axons becomes depleted or inactive, both NMN and VMN rise and NAD
  declines concomitantly; these fluctuations trigger SARM1 NAD(P)ase and, as shown
  here also base exchange, and thus initiate a signaling cascade that culminates into
  axon death. The early activation mechanism and key components of this process are
  highlighted in red and in blue for vacor toxicity.(B) Ordered Uni-Bi reaction mechanism
  of multifunctional NAD(P)ases (EC 3.2.2.6) like SARM1. From the substrate NAD(P),
  the pyridine moiety, Nam, is released first and then two distinct ADP ribosylated
  products arising from a single common intermediate (gray boxed). These may be ADPR(P)
  via classical hydrolysis or cADPR(P) via anhydrous cyclization. A third product
  XAD(P) represents any dinucleotides formed instead via transglycosidation (EC 2.4.99.20),
  a reaction of base exchange that replaces the pyridine moiety of the substrate with
  any related free base available.
