caption: The molecular mechanism underlying TIMP-1–mediated suppression of hepatocarcinogenesis.
  The schematic highlights the molecular events that were examined here to uncover
  the mechanism of TIMP-1–mediated inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation. The primary
  event in the pathway between TAg-induced IGF-II reactivation and hepatocyte proliferation
  affected by TIMP-1 overexpression was an increase in IGFBP-3 levels, due to the
  inhibition of MMP-mediated proteolysis of IGFBP-3 by TIMP-1. The direct result of
  increased IGFBP-3 levels was decreased dissociable IGF-II levels concomitant with
  decreased signaling through the IGF-IR and decreased hepatocyte proliferation.
