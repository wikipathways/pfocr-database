caption: TLS pathways for replication through 1-MeA. In the Polι/Polθ pathway, following
  nt insertion by Polι by Hoogsteen base pairing opposite 1-MeA, Polθ would extend
  synthesis; in the Polη pathway, this Pol would act alone at both the steps of TLS.
  TLS by Polι and Polη requires the noncatalytic and scaffolding role of Rev1. In
  the Polλ/Polζ pathway, following the insertion of T opposite 1-MeA by Polλ, Polζ
  would extend synthesis. In this pathway, Polλ’s scaffolding role would be additionally
  required for assembly with Polζ.
