caption: 'Simplified de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway.(a) Serine and palmitoyl
  CoA are condensed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) to generate 3-ketosphinganine.
  3-ketophinganine is reduced to dihydrosphingosine by 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase
  (KDSR). Dihydrosphingosine is acetylated by ceramide synthases (CERS) and further
  desaturated by ceramide desaturase (DEGS) to generate ceramide. Ceramide is the
  substrate for generation of other sphingolipids (sphingomyelin, galactosylceramide,
  glucosylceramide, sulfatide, and lactosylceramide). Abbreviations: SGMS = sphingomyelin
  synthase, SMase = sphingomyelinase, UGT8A = UDP galactosyltransferase 8A, GALC =
  galactosylceramidase. CST = galactosylceramide sulfotransferase, ARSA = arylsulfatase,
  GBA = glucosylceramidase, UGCG = UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase, LacCer
  synthase = lactosylceramide synthase. (b) Biosynthesis of non-hydroxylated sphingolipids.
  (c) Biosynthesis of 2-hydroxy sphingolipids. Fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) catalyzes
  hydroxylation of fatty acids in the C2 position, which can be incorporated into
  sphingolipid precursors (i.e., dihydroceramide) in the acylation step of de novo
  synthesis.'
