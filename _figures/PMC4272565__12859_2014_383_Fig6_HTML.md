caption: Schematic diagram of breast cancer pathway. BRCA1 plays a central role in
  breast cancer by connecting DNA damage and chromatin remodeling to downstream processes
  such as cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Black lines (edges) represent biochemical
  pathways, red and green edges are novel and known PPIs, respectively. Ovals and
  clouds represent proteins and protein complexes, respectively. Red ovals represent
  novel proteins that are associated with breast cancer pathway on the basis of the
  predicted interactions they form.
