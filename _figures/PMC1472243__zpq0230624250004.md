caption: 'Model of BT3172-directed metabolic regulation. B. thetaiotaomicron has 32
  HTCS proteins that incorporate the elements of classical two-component signaling
  proteins [a sensor, phosphoacceptor (HisKA), histidine kinase (HATPase_c), response
  regulator receiver (Response_reg), and signal output domain] in one polypeptide.
  Structural diversity among HTCS proteins is greatest among their sensor domains.
  This domain in BT3172 (Met-1-Glu-745) contains three predicted transmembrane spanning
  elements, producing periplasmic- and cytoplasmic-facing elements. Expression of
  BT3172 is induced by mannosides; the HTCS, in turn, induces expression of α-mannosidases
  required for breakdown of mannosides. Asp-146-Ser-299 of the cytoplasmic portion
  of BT3172''s sensor domain serves as a site for binding two proteins: glucose 6-phosphate
  isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9; key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway) and glucose 6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49; catalyzes the first step in the pentose phosphate shunt).
  Loss of BT3172 diminishes glycolytic pathway activity in vivo and in vitro. The
  organization of BT3172 and its interacting partners links sensing the availability
  of carbohydrates in the environment with regulation of bacterial carbohydrate metabolism.'
