caption: Scheme of the effect of polyphenols on SIRT1 and NF-κB signaling pathway
  involved in neuroinflammation. Stress signals as cytokines and ROS activate astrocytes
  and microglia, stimulating NF-κB signaling pathway, which leads to transcription
  of proinflammatory genes. This cascade of intracellular events results in increased
  cytokine production, ROS generation, inflammation, tissue damage and aging. Polyphenols
  (i.e resveratrol) can reduce the level of stress signals such as ROS, by avoiding
  oxidative stress, and citokines by activating and protecting SIRT1, which in turns
  cause a suppression of inflammation. SIRT1 directly inhibits NF-κB (by deacetylating
  the RelA/p65 subunit at lysine 310); preventing transcription activation of proinflammatory
  genes.
