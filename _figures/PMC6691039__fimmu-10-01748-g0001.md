caption: Platelet Theory. An invading pathogen binds to platelets either directly
  (absence of plasma protein) or indirectly (presence of plasma protein). Binding
  results in platelet activation via Src kinases which results in prostanoid release,
  cytokine secretion, granule secretion, and activation of GPIIbIIIa. Release of ADP
  and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) serves to amplify the platelet response. In conjunction
  with this, activation of GPIIbIIIa allows fibrinogen binding resulting in platelet
  aggregation. Secretion of platelet cytokines and chemokines activates the vascular
  endothelium. For example, secreted TNFa activates the TNFR1 receptor on endothelial
  cells which triggers the death pathway resulting in apoptosis. This results in endothelial
  cell shrinkage and loss of barrier integrity leading to increased vascular permeability
  and shock. Separation of endothelial cells allows for pathogens to escape the bloodstream
  and infect major organs which eventually leads to multi organ failure.
