caption: Mitochondrial carnitine shuttle, one-carbon folate metabolism and trans-sulfuration
  pathway. (4.1) Coenzyme A thioesters (Acyl-CoAs) cannot cross mitochondrial membranes.
  CPT1a facilitates the transfer of the acyl group from CoA to carnitine. Acyl-carnitines
  are permeable to the outer mitochondrial membrane, but not the inner mitochondrial
  membrane, requiring the transport via carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT)
  to reach the mitochondrial matrix. Once in the matrix, CPT2 converts the acyl-carnitine
  back to an acyl-CoA, which can then undergo FAO (see ). The released carnitine is
  then transported back across the inner mitochondrial membrane by CACT to be reused
  in the cytosol. (4.2) Non-esterified fatty acids of 12 or less carbons do not require
  the carnitine shuttle system, and can diffuse across both mitochondrial membranes.
  However, they still require esterification to CoA by mitochondrial ACS before they
  can be metabolized by FAO. (4.3) The carnitine shuttle system is regulated by malonyl-CoA,
  a precursor to FA synthesis which also inhibits CPT1a activity. Malonyl-CoA is principally
  produced from citrate that is broken into OAA and Ac-CoA in the cytosol by ATP citrate
  lyase (ACL). The released acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by ACC to malonyl-CoA. ACC
  is modulated by AMPK, which phosphorylates ACC and reduces its activity. (4.4) The
  folate pathway supports the transfer of one-carbon units from serine for biosynthetic
  processes. During this process both MTHFD2(L) and ALDH1L2 generate NADPH, which
  is essential for mitochondrial redox homeostasis. Despite the bidirectionality of
  this pathway, most of the cytosolic one-carbon units derived from serine are catabolized
  in the mitochondria. However, when the mitochondrial folate pathway is lost the
  directionality of the cytosolic one-carbon flux is reversed to compensate the synthesis
  of NADPH. (4.5) In the cytosol, MTHFD1 regenerates THF and the intermediate 5,10-methylene-THF
  links the folate pathway with the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (Met)
  within the TSP. In the liver and kidney mitochondria, BHMT regenerates Met, linking
  the mitochondrial oxidation of choline to betaine with the TSP, but the presence
  of this pathway in brain cells has not been confirmed.
