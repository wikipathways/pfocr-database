caption: . Biosynthetic gene cluster and proposed biosynthetic pathway of TXN-A and
  relative metabolites. (A) Localization of the cloned DNA region as represented by
  three overlapping fosmids and organization of the txn gene cluster. Color coding
  indicates the genes for the PKS and PKS associated enzymes (pink), tailoring enzymes
  (red), deoxysugar (blue), regulators and resistant proteins (green), and all others
  (black). (B) Proposed model for type II PKS and post-PKS modification. (C) Proposed
  biosynthetic pathway of two deoxysugar moieties. The significant points of the pathway
  were highlighted by colored circles.
