caption: 'Diagram of the localization of the polycystic kidney disease (PKD) proteins,
  the pathways implicated in its pathogenesis, and putative therapeutic targets. The
  polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), associated with autosomal dominant polycystic
  kidney disease (ADPKD), and FPC and DIZP1L, associated with autosomal recessive
  polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), are ciliary proteins and have functions in relation
  with the primary cilia. GANAβ [associated with ADPKD and autosomal dominant polycystic
  liver disease (ADPLD)], together with the classical genes of the ADPLD, PRKCSH,
  and Sec63, is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a role in the
  translocation and folding of the protein maturation. PC1 and PC2 form a receptor–channel
  complex in the cilium and is implicated in the Ca2+pathway. PC2 also regulates intracellular
  calcium in the ER. PC mutations result in deregulation of Ca2+ leading an increase
  in cAMP and upregulation of the PKA and MAPK pathways. Abbreviations: RyR, ryanodine
  receptor; IP3R, IP3 receptor; PDE, phosphodiesterase; AC-VI, adenylyl cyclase 6;
  Gs and Gi, guanosine nucleotide-binding proteins; V2R, V2 receptor; cAMP, cyclic
  AMP; PKA, protein kinase A; MAPK, MAP kinases; SIRT1, sirtuin 1.'
