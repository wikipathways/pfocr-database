caption: Prevention of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction by targeting multidrug
  resistance protein (Mrp) isoforms in brain microvessel endothelial cells. Our laboratory
  has reported that expression of Mrp1, Mrp2, and Mrp4 are increased at the BBB in
  the setting of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) stress. H/R stress is known to decrease
  glutathione (GSH) levels and increase glutathione disulfide (GSSG) concentrations
  in brain microvascular endothelial cells. We postulate that changes in GSH/GSSG
  transport occur during H/R as a result of altered functional expression of at least
  one Mrp isoform. Since nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), a ROS sensitive
  transcription factor, is known to regulate Mrps, we propose that this signaling
  pathway is a central mechanism for regulation of Mrps at the BBB. Antioxidant drugs
  can be used as pharmacological tools to understand how targeting activation of the
  Nrf2 pathway can control Mrp expression and/or activity.
