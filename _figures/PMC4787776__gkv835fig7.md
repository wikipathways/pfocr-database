caption: Model for the induction of apoptosis in cells lacking CHK1 function during
  replication stress. In normal cells DNA replication fork stress generates ssDNA
  as a result of uncoupling of replication and helicase complexes. RPA coated ssDNA
  triggers activation of the ATR-CHK1 pathway to enhance survival by suppressing origin
  firing and apoptosis and stimulating S-phase checkpoints and HR-dependent replication
  fork restart. Our results indicate that CHK1 is also required for the loading of
  the PP4 protein phosphatase complex onto chromatin to control phosphorylation of
  RPA2. When CHK1 is inhibited or depleted, cells fail to trigger S-phase checkpoints
  or fork restart and fail to load the PP4 complex onto chromatin. Cells lose control
  of CDC45-dependent origin firing leading to the accumulation of RPA-coated ssDNA
  and enhanced activation of ATR. This together with the failure to load the PP4 protein
  phosphatase complex and activation of DNA-PK leads to extensive hyperphosphorylation
  of RPA2. Depletion of CDC45 substantially reduces ssDNA formation, RPA2 hyperphosphorylation,
  ATR activation, and apoptosis while suppression of RPA2 hyperphosphorylation alone
  reduces the level of apoptosis. While these data are consistent with the proposal
  that ssDNA formation driven by inappropriate firing of replication origins in the
  absence of CHK1 function commit cells to apoptosis through RPA2 hyperphosphorylation,
  it is also likely that other cellular responses to the high level of ssDNA may also
  contribute to the induction of apoptosis.
