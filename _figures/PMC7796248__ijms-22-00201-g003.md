caption: Obese and diabetic conditions disinhibit the hippocampal inhibitory control
  over the HPA axis. ① HPA axis hyperactivation is reported in diet-induced obese
  and diabetic conditions, resulting in ② increased corticosterone synthesis and secretion.
  Corticosterone can cross the blood-brain barrier and activates the glucocorticoid
  receptors in the hippocampus. The activation of the glucocorticoid receptor ③ impairs
  neuroplasticity and ④ promotes neuroinflammatory response. ⑤ The hippocampus is
  shown to inhibit the HPA activity through the vHipp/BNST/PVN neural circuit pathway,
  whereas dysregulated hippocampal plasticity may disinhibit the HPA axis and aggravates
  the diet-induced hyperactivation of the HPA axis. Created with BioRender.com.
