caption: Metabolic routes relevant to this study. The genes analyzed in this study
  are shown in a red box, red arrows indicate genes that showed overexpression, and
  an asterisk represents those genes that showed an increase in the level of expression
  regarding the CNS WHO grade of the brain glioma biopsies. The gliomas undergo metabolic
  remodeling to meet the needs of the highly proliferative cells, which can be summarized
  as an increase in the expression of some genes involved in glycolysis, such as HK1,
  PFKM, GAPDH, and LDHAL6A. Besides this, the overexpression of some genes involved
  in PPP was also demonstrated (G6PD, PGD1, and TKT1), which will probably allow the
  glioma cells to have a more significant enzymatic activity in this pathway, and
  thus the cells obtain precursors for nucleotide synthesis and reducing power. Finally,
  the Krebs cycle and fatty acid synthesis pathways play central roles in cellular
  metabolism; we also found that the IDH1, SDHB, FASN, ACACA, and ELOVL2 genes were
  overexpressed, resulting in significant disturbances in the cellular metabolism
  of gliomas.
