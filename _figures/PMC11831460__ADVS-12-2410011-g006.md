caption: Schematic illustration of oral LR‐S‐CD/CpG@LNPs to achieve tumor accumulation,
  in situ vaccination, and activation of systemic antitumor immune responses against
  CRC. After oral administration, nanotherapeutics effectively pass through the upper
  GIT and accumulate in the deep orthotopic tumor tissues under NIR irradiation. Subsequently,
  CD/CpG@LNPs induce ICD of tumor cells via PTT/PDT and release abundant autoneoantigens.
  Neoantigens and CpG are employed in concert to facilitate DC maturation and promote
  the infiltration of CTLs into the colorectal tumor tissues. Moreover, Lactobacillus
  enhances the antitumor immune responses by upregulation the level of I3A through
  the tryptophan metabolic pathway. The synergistic treatment modality of PTT/PDT,
  in situ vaccination, and I3A not only suppresses orthotopic tumors, but also activates
  systematic antitumor immunity against distant tumors, increases the abundance of
  gut beneficial bacteria, and decreases the abundance of harmful bacteria
