caption: Differences in the functional impact of IL-7/IL-7R-mediated signaling in
  T-ALL cells and their normal counterparts. In T-ALL cells, Bcl-2 is upregulated
  by IL-7 via PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which also regulates cell cycle progression.
  STAT5 is also required for IL-7-mediated cell cycle progression and viability. However,
  STAT5 does not upregulate Bcl-2 downstream from IL-7. By contrast, IL-7 recruits
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway strictly for cell cycle progression in normal T-cells, whereas
  STAT5 appears to transcriptionally activate Bcl-2 and upregulate viability.
