caption: USP13 in infection. USP13 stabilized STAT1 to suppress DEN2. The removal
  of K27 linked polyubiquitin chain of STING by USP13 hindered the recruitment of
  TBK1 to STING, leading to reduction of IFN production. The NSP13 of SARS-COV-2 could
  hijack USP13 to stabilize itself and the binding of NSP13 with TBK1 prevented MAVS-TBK1
  signaling pathway. Green arrow indicates promotion; Red capped line represents inhibition.
