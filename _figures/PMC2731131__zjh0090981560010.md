caption: Schematic summary of LPS-triggered programmed cell death in human endothelial
  cells. LPS bound to CD14 triggers responses through TLR4. In the presence of FADD,
  LPS-activated TLR4 recruits MyD88 which, in turn, engages FADD. FADD recruits pro-caspase
  8, which undergoes autocatalytic activation. This response is normally inhibited
  by cFLIP, the level of which rapidly decays in the absence of new protein synthesis
  (eg, when CHX is present). Activated caspase 8 may directly activate effector caspases,
  causing apoptotic cell death. This response may also be amplified by caspase 8-mediated
  cleavage of cytosolic Bid, forming active tBid. tBid translocates to the mitochondria,
  initiating release of cytochrome c into the cytosol where, in combination with other
  proteins, activates caspase 9. Active caspase 9, like caspase 8, activates effector
  caspases and also leads to apoptotic cell death. In the absence of FADD or when
  phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase is inhibited by LY294002 or when IFN-γ is present,
  LPS activates a MyD88-independent release of cathepsin B (cat B) from the lysosome
  into the cytosol. Cytosolic Cat B initiates mitochondrial release of cytochrome
  c and other death-inducing proteins from the mitochondria through a mechanism that
  is independent of Bid. Some of these released proteins, such as apoptosis inducing
  factor, can cause cell death through a pathway that does not involve caspases. Caspase
  inhibitors like zVAD can block the actions of caspase 8, caspase 9 and effector
  caspases, preventing death triggered via MyD88 and FADD. However, zVAD does not
  inhibit cat B and cannot prevent mitochondrial release of proteins like apoptosis
  inducing factor and thus cannot prevent cell death when Cat B is activated, although
  it may prevent the appearance of certain features of death caused by caspases such
  as nuclear fragmentation. Programmed cell death initiated by Cat B can be prevented
  by Cat B inhibitors such as CA074 or zFA.
