caption: The major signaling pathway causing insulin resistance is the convergence
  of multiple stimuli leading to the activation of S6 kinase. Overnutrition results
  in increased levels of circulating fatty acids, amino acids and excess glucose that
  cause activation of mTOR/S6 kinase. Activation of RAAS results in oxidative stress
  due to activation of NADPH oxidase by Ang II and aldosterone. Oxidative stress induced
  activation of kinases including JNK and S6 kinase, results in serine phosphorylation
  of IRS-1 and inhibition of insulin metabolic signaling. Cytokine-induced insulin
  resistance also involves activation of S6 kinase. Oxidative stress and insulin resistance
  is also accompanied by impaired AMPK signaling which is a negative regulator of
  mTOR/S6 kinase. Persistent hyperactivation of mTOR/S6 kinase also leads to ER stress,
  oxidative stress and activation of JNK. Excess accumulation and enhanced oxidation
  of fatty acids concomitant with increased accumulation of lipid intermediates result
  in lipotoxicity and metabolic inflexibility. These four overnutrition-induced cellular
  events are further amplified by their feed-forward interactions.
