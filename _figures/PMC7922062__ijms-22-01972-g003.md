caption: Glycan-lectin interactions within the breast cancer microenvironment modulate
  the phenotype of tumour-associated macrophages. The binding of lectins (glycan binding
  receptors) on macrophages to aberrant glycans exposed at the surface of BC cells
  induces a protumour phenotype in macrophages, promoting immunosuppressive functions.
  (a) Few glycan-lectin interactions are currently known, being the most described
  the interactions between sialylated epitopes of BC cells and sialic acid-binding
  immunoglobulin-like lectins (SIGLECs). The recognition of ST-enriched MUC1 by SIGLEC-9
  activates the MAPK-ERK pathway, increasing the expression of immunosuppressive factors,
  which induces the protumour phenotype of other infiltrating immune cells. Sialyl
  T (ST) and sialyl Tn (STn) antigens are recognized by SIGLEC-10, triggering an immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-mediated signalling which recruits Src homology
  2 (SH2)-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1) and SHP2 tyrosine
  phosphatases. These phosphatases inhibit the phosphorylation of myosin, hampering
  the motility of macrophages membrane and engulfment of tumour cells. SIGLEC-15 has
  been described to bind STn, inducing a DAP12-mediated cascade that triggers an increased
  secretion of TGF-β. In another recent study, SIGLEC-15 showed higher binding avidity
  for other sialylated glycans, not triggering TGF-β secretion, but instead activation
  of the SYK/MAPK signalling pathway. SIGLEC-15-glycan interactions within TME remains
  an open question. (b) Terminal GalNAc on tumour cells is recognized by macrophage
  galactose-like lectin (MGL), upregulating the ERK pathway and the expression of
  IL-10, via NF-κB. Some studies also report the role of clusterins in TAM modulation.
  Although much is not understood in this interaction, clusterin-stimulated macrophages
  were shown to polarize into a proangiogenic, anti-inflammatory phenotype, with increased
  secretion of VEGF, IL-8 and IL-10. Monosaccharides are represented according to
  the symbol nomenclature for glycans (SNFG) [,,,,,,,,,,].
