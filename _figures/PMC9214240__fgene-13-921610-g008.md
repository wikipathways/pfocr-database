caption: Diagram depicting classes of nDNA-encoded genes and proteins that form the
  nDNA-mtDNA axis. Except the 13 proteins encoded in mtDNA, all mitochondrial localized
  proteins are nDNA-encoded and synthesized in the cytosol. These proteins are then
  transported into mitochondria through the operation of specialized protein-importing
  machinery and ultimately localize at various sites within mitochondria. The dotted-line
  rectangle indicates groups of nDNA-encoded proteins forming the nDNA-mtDNA axis
  governing transcription and translation of mtDNA-encoded genes. In the DCM model
  studied, activation of Hippo signaling pathway suppressed nDNA-encoded mitochondrial
  genes that further interferes with this axis exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction.
