caption: 'Learning and short-term memory depend on the cAMP pathway. After the activation
  of a G protein coupled receptor by a ligand (L), adenylyl cyclase (AC) synthesizes
  cAMP, which in turn is hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase (PDE). The Drosophila mutants
  rutabaga (AC) and dunce (PDE) were among the first mutants isolated with heritable
  defects in learning/memory. Increased levels of cAMP lead to the activation of Protein
  Kinase A (PKA). After dissociation from its regulatory subunit, the catalytic subunit
  phosphorylates many targets: (1) potassium channels, which regulate neural activity
  during short-term memory phases; and (2) the cyclic AMP responsive element binding
  protein (CREB) transcription factor, which regulates the expression of other genes
  during long-term memory formation.'
