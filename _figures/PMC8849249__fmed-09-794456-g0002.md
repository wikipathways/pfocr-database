caption: Signaling mechanisms with balance of bone formation and resorption in bone
  metabolism. The balance between bone formation and bone resorption is largely regulated
  by the Wnt/ β catenin pathway and the RANK/RANKL/OPG axis. Wnt protein binds to
  its co-receptors Frizzled and LRP5/6 on the surface of osteoblasts, which leads
  to the stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, before it translocates
  to the nucleus where it regulates target genes and induces bone formation. This
  pathway can be inhibited by sclerostin and members of the Dkk protein family. RANKL
  binds to its receptor RANK, which is expressed on pre-osteoclasts. This induces
  the activation of several transcription factors and in turn osteoclast differentiation
  and maturation. OPG, which is a soluble decoy receptor and also secreted by osteoblasts,
  can bind to RANKL and thereby inhibits bone resorption. Under physiological conditions,
  OPG and RANKL are in equilibrium and preserve bone homeostasis. Several proinflammatory
  cytokines and growth factors (white boxes) stimulate and upregulate RANKL expression
  and mediate osteoclast maturation and activation. The metabolic state of the bone
  is reflected by its biochemical products, which also serve as bone turnover markers
  for either bone formation or resorption. b-ALP, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase;

  description: Signaling mechanisms with balance of bone formation and resorption
    in bone metabolism. The balance between bone formation and bone resorption is
    largely regulated by the Wnt/ β catenin pathway and the RANK/RANKL/OPG axis. Wnt
    protein binds to its co-receptors Frizzled and LRP5/6 on the surface of osteoblasts,
    which leads to the stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm,
