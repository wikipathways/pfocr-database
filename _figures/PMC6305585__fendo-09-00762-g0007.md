caption: APOBEC1-mediated RNA editing in metabolic disorders. The color of the first
  arrow in each pathway indicates the mechanism (refer to Figure ) by which APOBEC1
  regulates its direct targets, depicted in pink shapes. Additional activators of
  specific pathway steps are depicted in red rounded rectangles. Gray arrows point
  to ApoB-associated secondary functions. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LDL, low-density
  lipoprotein; VLDL, very-low-density lipoprotein. The figure was created with BioRender.
