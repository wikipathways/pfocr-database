caption: 'DLK regulates multiple responses to axonal damage. DLK signaling becomes
  activated following axonal injury and regulates multiple cellular responses (in
  orange): neuronal death [,], axonal regeneration [,,,] and/or protection from degeneration
  [], depending upon the context (). Whether DLK promotes loss of dendrites and synaptic
  inputs is hypothesized based on discussed data [,,,–], but remains to be determined.
  The distal part of the axon, which becomes removed from the cell body undergoes
  Wallerian degeneration. This is also influenced by DLK signaling [,,]. In addition,
  DLK and downstream signaling components crosstalk with other factors that influence
  axonal degeneration, the NMNAT enzyme and Sarm1 NADylase [,,,].'
