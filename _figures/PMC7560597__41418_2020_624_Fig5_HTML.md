caption: Autophagy process involves five key steps, (1) initiation, (2) nucleation,
  (3) elongation, (4) autophagosome formation, and (5) degradation, where each step
  is regulated by specific ATG proteins as highlighted, or explicit proteins such
  as ULK1, Beclin-1, P13P, LC3 conjugation system as mentioned. cGAS–STING activation
  can initiate autophagy and follow the five key steps triggering its own degradation,
  however the requirement of specific autophagy components at each step is ambiguous.
  In addition, cGAS–STING activation mediated by cGAS–STING–TBK1–IRF3 assembly complex
  can translocate directly to autophagosomes via an unknown mechanism. Also, cGAS
  can interact directly with Beclin-1 to initiate autophagy independent and/or absence
  of STING. Furthermore, ULK1 can phosphorylate STING and prevent its activation.
