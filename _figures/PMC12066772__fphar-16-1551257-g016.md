caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanism by which Iso inhibits RANKL-induced
  osteoclastogenesis. Iso competes for binding with RANKL-RANK, thereby interfering
  with their interaction. Furthermore, Iso inhibits the phosphorylation of key signaling
  pathways, including MAPK, NF-κB/PI3K-AKT, and Ca2+ pathways, as well as calcium
  ion channels. This interference results in the reduced self-transcription of NFATc1
  and a subsequent downregulation of OC-specific genes. Collectively, these findings
  suggest that Iso impedes osteoclastogenesis by blocking RANKL-RANK binding and inhibiting
  the transcriptional activation of NFATc1. This image was drawn using the Figdraw
