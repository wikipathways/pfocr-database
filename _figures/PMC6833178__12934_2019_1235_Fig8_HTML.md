caption: Metabolic characterization of the MEP pathway in E. coli expressing isoprene
  synthase and isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase from a plasmid. The intracellular
  metabolite concentrations, secretion rate of metabolites and isoprene production
  rate are plotted against dxs expression. The expression strength of dxs was modulated
  by randomization of its ribosome-binding site. DXP 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate,
