caption: '(A) Mechanisms of balanced agonism; activation of the IGF-IR stimulates
  not only the AKT pathway by phosphorylation of IRS-I and PI3K, but in addition,
  stimulates the β-arrestin-1 (β-arr1) pathway which leads to proteasomal degradation
  of the IGF-IR through an ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated mechanism and ERK activation. (B)
  Beta-arrestin-1 biased agonism. Binding of monoclonal (blocking) antibodies directed
  against the IGF-IR block the kinase cascade pathway (by blocking phosphorylation
  of IRS-1, PI3K and AKT) but simultaneously activate the β-arrestin-1 (β-arr1) pathway
  which induces enhanced IGF-IR receptor internalization (ubiquitination) and activation
  of ERK signaling pathway. (Modified from Salisbury & Tomblin. Insulin/Insulin-like
  growth factors in cancer: new roles for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, tumor resistance
  mechanisms, and new blocking strategies. Front Endocrinol (Lausanne), 2015; 6:12).'
