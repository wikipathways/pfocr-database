caption: 'Mechanisms of action of HDPs: (a) direct killing of the bacteria, (b) immunomodulation.
  In (a), as indicated on the left, HDPs can translocate through the bacterial membrane
  to reach inner targets, such as (i) DNA, (ii) RNA or (iii) interfere with biosynthetic
  reactions by binding to proteins or substrates. The inset schematically shows peptidoglycan
  biosynthesis in S. aureus. HDPs can interfere at different points in this pathway.
  In (a), on the right, direct killing through membrane perturbation is shown. The
  specific mechanisms here are: (iv) barrel stave, (v) toroidal or (vi) carpet or
  detergent-like pore formation, which lead to cell lysis. In (b), intracellular uptake
  occurs either through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (yellow) or direct translocation
  []. Once inside, HDPs can function in a myriad of ways: (i) wound healing, (ii)
  recruitment and polarization of T cells, (iii) promotion of neutrophil extracellular
  trap (NET) release, (iv) differentiation of dendritic cells, (v) phagocytosis, (vi)
  modulation of the host microbiome, (vii) induction of chemokines (blue), which leads
  to the recruitment of monocytes (grey) and macrophages (purple), (viii) neutralization
  of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), (ix) induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines and (x)
  suppression of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines.'
