caption: '(A) Schematic of sphingolipid metabolism. Highlighted are the enzymes responsible
  for the steady- or conditional-state levels of S1P: SphK1, or SphK2, SPL, and SPP.
  SphK1 and SPL also catabolize DH-sphingosine produced in the de novo pathway of
  sphingolipid synthesis (initiated by SPT). Also shown are upstream metabolites in
  the sphingolipid pathway that can accumulate intracellularly if SphK1 is inhibited.
  (B) Schematic illustrating how ceramide/S1P rheostat may be disrupted by CS, which
  inhibits intracellular S1P production and extracellular signaling via S1PR1, thereby
  weakening prosurvival effects that oppose ceramide-induced cell death by necroptosis.
  Excessive lung microvascular cell death, in turn, contributes to emphysema development.
