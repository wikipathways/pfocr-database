caption: Future perspectives overview implicating serine/glycine metabolism-targeted
  therapies in combination with radiation therapy. The rational integration of serine/glycine
  metabolism-targeted therapies in combination with radiotherapy is important to optimize
  the efficacy and enhance the therapeutic ratio of radiotherapy. The stratification
  methods to select patients that might benefit from these combined treatment modalities
  could include the analysis of serine, GSH, or methionine serum levels or the expression
  of de novo serine/glycine biosynthesis enzymes. The therapeutic strategies targeting
  serine/glycine metabolism include limiting the availability of exogenous serine
  by diet restriction and targeting the enzymes of de novo serine/glycine biosynthesis
  pathways, for instance, SHMT inhibition using sertraline. In addition, mitochondrial
  inhibitors, e.g., metformin, phenformin or artemether, might have synergistic antitumor
  effects in combination with serine/glycine-targeted strategies and enhance the response
  to radiotherapy. Finally, targeting serine/glycine metabolism before radiotherapy,
  concomitantly or sequentially, requires considering serine/glycine metabolism functions
  in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment and how targeting this metabolic
  pathway might enhance or counteract the response to radiotherapy. The blue arrows
  indicate expected cellular changes, in green beneficial outcome of the cellular
  changes and in orange the limitations of the outcomes related to the cellular changes.
