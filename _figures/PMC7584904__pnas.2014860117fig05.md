caption: Metabolic pathway highlighting significant changes in the endosperm of line
  E15 compared to wild-type seeds. Significant changes are shown as gradients of red
  (higher levels in E15), blue (lower levels in E15), and green (detected only in
  E15). Metabolites with the same abundance in both genotypes are shown in gray and
  those undetected in either genotype are shown in white. The average of six technical
  replicates was used for all calculations. N.C., not confirmed.
