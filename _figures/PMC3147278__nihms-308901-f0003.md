caption: Cross-talk between TLR4 and IL-1 signaling pathways. Activation of TLR4 by
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) initiates a signal through the Janus kinase signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 1 (JAK-STAT1) pathway as well as through tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). IL-1 signal transduction is initiated
  through the TRAF6 signaling pathway by the binding of either IL-1α or IL-1β to the
  IL-1R1/IL-1RAP complex. The IL-1R2/IL-1RAP complex competes for the binding of IL-1α
  and IL-1β and does not produce a signal when bound, therefore limiting the availability
  of IL-1α or IL-1β to bind to the IL-1R1/IL-1RAP complex. A dashed line indicates
  that other signaling molecules not shown are also involved in the pathway.
