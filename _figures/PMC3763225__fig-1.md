caption: Biosynthetic pathways to L-ascorbate in higher plants. The major ascorbate
  biosynthetic pathway is the D-Man/L-Gal or Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway (yellow). The
  minor L-gulose pathway is branched at GDP-Man 3′,5′-epimerase (purple). The last
  step of this alternative route is the oxidation of L-gulono-1,4-lactone to ascorbate.
  The myo-Inositol branch (blue); also provides L-gulono-1,4-lactone for the biosynthesis
  of ascorbate via the formation of UDP-glucuronate by myo-Inositol oxidase. The D-galacturonic
  acid route (green), uses D-galacturonic acid, a principal component of cell wall
  and similar to the classical D-Man/L-Gal pathway provides galactono-1,4-lactone
  via the formation of L-galactonate by D-galacturonate reductase. Question marks
  indicate reactions where the gene and the specific enzyme have not been identified
  yet. The conversion of L-galactono-1,4-lactone to ascorbate by GLDH coupled to mitochondrial
  ETC is shown in red (mitochondria-like shape) circle. ETC, electron transfer chain;
  GLDH, L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase. To see this illustration in color,
