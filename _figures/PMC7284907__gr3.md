caption: Role of oxidative stress in the regulation of muscle atrophy. A. High levels
  of ROS downregulate the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis by several mechanisms including a decline
  of Akt phosphorylation, the repression of mTORC1 and the inhibition of 4E-BP1 and
  S6K1 phosphorylation which are essential for protein synthesis. B. ROS activate
  caspase-3 through the activation of caspase-12 (extrinsic apoptotic pathway) or
  caspase 9 (intrinsic apoptotic pathway). Calpains also contribute to apoptosis through
  caspase-12 activation and promoting EndoG pro-apoptotic factor release from mitochondria.
  C. ROS up-regulate the ubiquitin proteasome system by increasing the gene expression
  of MuRF-1 and MAFbx by FoxO3 dephosphorylation and NF-κB activation. D. Oxidative
  stress promotes the activation of calpains by cytosolic Ca+2 increase. E. Activation
  or inhibition of autophagy depends on the sub-cellular ROS localization. Nox2-derived
  ROS lead to the activation of SCR-PI3K-Akt pathway and inhibit autophagy. However,
  mitochondrial ROS activate autophagy by i) inducing FoXO3 nuclear translocation,
  due to the Akt-mTOR pathway inhibition, which leads to autophagy related genes expression;
  ii) repressing mTORC1 by ATM activation which increases ULK activity; iii) inducing
  p38/p53; iv) inactivating ATG4 which prevents the premature cleavage of LC3.
