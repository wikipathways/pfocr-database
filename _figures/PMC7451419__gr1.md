caption: Porphyrin biosynthesis pathway. Aminolevulinic acid synthase catalyzes the
  production of delta-aminolevulinic acid from glycine and succinyl-CoA. Three subsequent
  reactions convert delta-aminolevulinic acid to uroporphyrinogen, which is converted
  to coproporphyrinogen by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD). Three subsequent
  reactions result in the formation of heme. Familial porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)
  is an autosomal dominant condition, caused by pathogenic variants in the UROD gene.
  Reduction in UROD activity below 20% causes accumulation of uroporphyrinogen, which
  deposits in the skin and liver causing the skin-blistering and hepatic injury characteristic
  of PCT. UROD pathogenic variants alone are insufficient to cause disease, and most
  cases of PCT are sporadic. Hepatic iron accumulation is required for both familial
  and sporadic disease. Specifically, hepatic iron is suspected to promote synthesis
  of a UROD inhibitor through a yet unknown oxidation reaction. Alcohol increases
  flux through the porphyrin pathway, increases iron absorption and contributes to
  formation of the UROD inhibitor.
