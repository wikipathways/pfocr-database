caption: Schematic presentation of select miRNAs that regulate toll-like receptor
  signaling pathways. During innate immune response, toll-like receptors (TLRs) are
  activated by various pathogens and initiate signaling transduction to induce the
  production of type I interferons (IFNs) and other inflammatory cytokines. miRNAs
  exert pronounced control of the pathway activation at multiple levels to ensure
  the generation of proper immune response. The miRNAs preferentially target the common
  signaling components and transcription factors, but also directly act on receptors
  and cytokine mRNAs. In most cases, decreases in the concentrations of miRNA target
  proteins achieve effective negative regulation and therefore avoid detrimental immune
  activation. However, if the target protein itself is a negative regulator (IL-1
  receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-M, suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1),
  SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase-1 (SHIP1)), miRNA-mediated regulation
  will facilitate TLR signaling and the production of inflammatory cytokines. ERK,
