caption: Core molecular mechanism of non-apoptotic regulated cell death. a RIPK3-stimulated
  MLKL is necessary for membrane rupture formation in necroptosis. Upstream elicitors
  include DR, TLR, and viruses, which induce RIPK3 activation through RIPK1, TICAM1,
  and ZBP1, respectively. In addition, RIPK3 is activated by AR via an unknown adaptor
  protein or kinases. b Pyroptosis is mostly driven by GSDMD after cleavage of this
  protein by CASP1 and CASP11 in response to PAMPs and DAMPs, or cytosolic LPS. c
  Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that relies on the balance between iron accumulation-induced
  ROS production and the antioxidant system during lipid peroxidation. The ACSL4-LPCAT3-ALOX15
  pathway mediates lipid peroxidation. In contrast, several antioxidant systems, especially
  system xc- that includes the core components SLC7A11, GPX4, and NFE2L2, inhibit
  this process. d Parthanatos is a PARP1-dependent form of cell death that relies
  on the AIFM1-MIF pathway. e Entotic cell death is a form of cellular cannibalism
  through the activation of entosis followed by the engulfing and killing of cells
  through LAP and the lysosomal degradation pathway. RHOA, ROCK, myosin, and CDC42
  are required for entosis. f Netotic cell death is driven by NET release, which is
  regulated by NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production and histone citrullination. g
  Lysosome-dependent cell death is mediated by releasing hydrolytic enzymes (cathepsins)
  or iron upon LMP. h Autophagy-dependent cell death is driven by the molecular machinery
  of autophagy. i Alkaliptosis is driven by intracellular alkalinization after IKBKB-NF-κB
  pathway-dependent downregulation of CA9. j Oxeiptosis is an oxygen radical-induced
  form of cell death driven by the activation of the KEAP1-PGAM5-AIFM1 pathway
