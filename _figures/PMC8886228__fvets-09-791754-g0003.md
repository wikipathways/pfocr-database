caption: Glucose uptake and oxidation. Glycolysis plays an important role in cardiac
  bioenergetics. In cardiomyocytes, glucose is transported via glucose transporters
  (GLUTs). Some glucose is converted to fructose and then fructose 6-phosphate for
  glycolysis via polyol pathway. The majority of glucose goes through a series of
  enzymatic reactions of glycolysis to be converted to pyruvate. These enzymes include
  hexokinase (HK) for glucose 6-phosphate, phosphofructokinase 2 (PFK2) for fructose
  6-phosphate, and PFK1 for fructose 1,6-biphosphate. Pyruvate can be reduced to lactate
  by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in cytosol or oxidized to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH) in the mitochondria. A small amount of pyruvate can be converted
  into alanine by alanine transaminase (ALT).
