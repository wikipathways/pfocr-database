caption: PTGIR and PTGER4 are activated by their ligands (PGI2 and PGE2 respectively)
  turning on the AC which converts ATP into cAMP; cAMP activates PKA which in turn
  triggers STAT3 by phosphorylation. STAT3 binds to the promoters () of S100A8 and
  S100A9 inducing their expression. TLR4 and when activated by its ligand LPS, activates
  the JAK2-STAT3 pathway which induces the expression of S100A8/9 and inhibits NF-kB.
  We have shown the induction of S100A8/9 genes in THP-1 activated by LPS (). ZBTB40
  could potentially bind directly to the S100A8/9 promoters inducing their expression
  and/or to the PLA2G1B promoter (by Encode) activating its expression. PLA2G1B encodes
  an enzyme that initiates the PG synthesis including PGI2 and PGE2 which bind PTGIR
  and PTGER4 respectively, inducing S100A8/S100A9 (see above). Based on RNAseq data,
  expression of NFKB1 in THP-1 induces the expression of EBI3 (one of the top 5 HITS)
  () most likely via direct binding to the EBI3 promoter by RELB subunit. EBI3 encodes
  the interleukine-27 subunit beta, which can bind to IL27R and activate JAK/STAT3
  pathway [,]. In addition, NFKB1 induces the expression of PTGIR (<2 FC, RNAseq data)
  and by LPS (). RELB binds directly to PTGIR promoter (by Encode).
