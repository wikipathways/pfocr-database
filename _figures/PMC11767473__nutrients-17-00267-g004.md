caption: The importance of RANK/RANKL signaling pathway in osteoclasts differentiation.
  The RANK/RANKL pathway regulates various signaling involved in osteoclastogenesis,
  such as MAPK, cFos, and NF-κꞵ through AP-1 and NFATc1 activation. RANK/RANKL also
  triggers ROS production, the mechanism that enhances osteoclastogenesis. The diagram
  highlighted the role of Nrf2 in decreasing osteoclastogenesis by targeting ROS formation.
  Furthermore, OPG can inhibit osteoclast formation by targeting RANK-RANKL binding.
