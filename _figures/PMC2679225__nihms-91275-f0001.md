caption: Involvement of p53 signaling after ROS generation. After ROS generation from
  mitochondria, p53 transcriptionally generates pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax,
  Noxa, p53AIP1, PUMA, and Bid. These products act directly on mitochondria. Mitochondrial
  translocation of Bax is promoted by JNK through transcriptional activation of Bim.
  Full-length PIDD (PIDD-FL) is also transcriptionally upregulated by p53. PIDD-CC,
  a fragment of PIDD-FL cleaved by autoproteolysis, activates caspase-2 through the
  formation of the PIDDosome, which precedes Bid truncation and translocation to mitochondria.
  Moreover, p53 translocates to the mitochondrial membrane and activates the mitochondria-dependent
  apoptotic pathway in a transcription-independent manner. BH3-only proteins and p53
  interact with both pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL on the mitochondrial
  membrane. This interaction causes Bax oligomerization and activation, which triggers
  cytochrome c release, leading to neuronal death. tBid, truncated Bid.
