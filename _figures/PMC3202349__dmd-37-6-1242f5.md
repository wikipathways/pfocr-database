caption: Proposed scheme for CYP3A4-mediated metabolic activation of dasatinib. Dasatinib
  hydroxylation leads to the formation of a chemically reactive para-quinoneimine
  intermediate (major pathway) or hydrogen abstraction of the methyl leads to an ortho-imine-methide
  intermediate (minor pathway). These reactive intermediates react with glutathione
  to form corresponding GSH adducts or may react with CYP3A4 and lead to enzyme inactivation.*,
  proposed sites of glutathione adduction.

    ortho-imine-methide intermediate (minor pathway). These reactive intermediates
    react with glutathione to form corresponding GSH adducts or may react with CYP3A4
