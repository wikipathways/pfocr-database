caption: A network of genes in mice immunized with UV-V after SARS-CoV challenge.
  A direct comparison of gene expression profiles in the lungs of UV-V- and UV-V+TLR-immunized
  mice is shown. The diagrams show the TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways. Genes shown
  in red were upregulated, and those in green were downregulated, compared with expression
  for the PBS group. Several genes downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 signaling were upregulated
  in UV-V+TLR-immunized mice (B) compared with expression in UV-V-immunized mice (A).
  We overlaid gene expression data on the formed network using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  software.
