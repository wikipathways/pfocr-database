caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of microarray data showing (A) predicted
  inhibition of IL6 signaling at 3 hr and (B) activation at 24 hr after APAP 300 compared
  to PHX, based on downstream gene expression profile. As shown in , IL6 was activated
  as early as 3 hr after PHX, while activation was delayed (starting from 12 hr) after
  APAP300. Positive or negative z-score (absolute z-score > 2 considered as significant)
  represents predicted activation or inhibition of upstream regulator based on expression
  profile of downstream genes. p-values signifies extent of overlap between set of
  downstream target genes of a upstream regulator in dataset compared to all known
  downstream target genes of that upstream regulator in the reference genome. (red
  shapes: upregulated genes; green shapes: downregulated genes with intensity of color
  reflecting extent of upregulation or downregulation; blue center shape: predicted
  inhibition; orange center shape: predicted activation)'
