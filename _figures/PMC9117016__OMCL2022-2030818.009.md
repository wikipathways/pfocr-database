caption: Summary of the proposed mechanism responsible for the recovered bone loss
  of OVX mice after WR exercise. In OVX mice, WR exercise activates CD8+ T cells to
  produce the inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ, which inhibits osteoclastogenesis and bone
  resorption through the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. The suppression of IκB
  and p65 phosphorylation in the NF-κB pathway, as well as the suppression of ERK
  and p38 phosphorylation in the MAPK pathway, triggers a decreased level of NFATc1.
  As a result, the expression of osteoclast marker genes is downregulated.
