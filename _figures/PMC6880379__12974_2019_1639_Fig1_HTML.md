caption: Aim2 protein-mediated modulation of AD-related inflammation. Mouse microglia
  express detectable basal levels of Aim2 protein. Detection of low levels of cytosolic
  DNA, released in the brain due to traumatic brain injury (TBI), pyroptosis (caused
  by activation of inflammasomes), and brain infections, by cGAS activates the IFN-stimulatory
  DNA (ISD) pathway and the T1 IFN response, resulting in upregulation of the Aim2
  gene expression and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The IL-10 suppresses neuroinflammation.
  Detection of increased levels of cytosolic DNA by macrophages/microglia activates
  the Aim2 inflammasome, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (IL-1β and IL-18) and cell death by pyroptosis. The activation of the Aim2 inflammasome
  and pyroptosis contributes to AD-related inflammation and associated neurotoxicity,
  resulting in neurodegeneration. Cell death by pyroptosis inhibits the ISD pathway
  and the production of IL-10
