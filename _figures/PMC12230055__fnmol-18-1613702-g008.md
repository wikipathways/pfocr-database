caption: This figure illustrates the dynamic interrelationships among the various
  key regulatory mechanisms involved in the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
  and their intervention strategies in IS. It encompasses current research topics
  of significant interest and pioneering directions in the field. Specifically, the
  activation of PI3K/Akt effectively inhibits oxidative stress and reduces the expression
  of pro-apoptotic proteins, thereby reducing neuronal apoptosis. It has been demonstrated
  to impede microglia M1-type polarization induced by oxidative stress, thereby attenuating
  neuroinflammatory injury. PI3K/Akt exerts neuroprotective effects through the regulation
  of downstream mTOR proteins and the inhibition of the process of autophagy. Of particular
  significance is the observation that the activation of PI3K/Akt has been demonstrated
  to inhibit ferroptosis in IS, reduce cellular autophagy, and promote microglia polarization
  toward an M2-type phenotype. This, in turn, has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory
  and repair effects. The present study explores the significance of TCM in the treatment
  of IS, with a particular focus on its targeted engagement with the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  Bioinformatics offers a scientific foundation for the efficacy of TCM, underscoring
  its potential as a therapeutic modality. By Figdraw
