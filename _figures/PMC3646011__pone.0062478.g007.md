caption: Exposure to certain drugs affecting DNA or chromatin results in enhanced
  expression of secreted growth factors and cytokines. These secreted factors (SFs)
  may in turn signal in autocrine/paracrine manner for activation of Akt and inhibition
  of GSK3 beta associated degradation complex (GSK3β/DC) resulting in stabilization
  of TAZ oncogene. Consequently, expression of EMT genes is enhanced, leading to increased
  cell migration and drug resistance (DR) in both drug affected and neighboring cells.
  These processes can be overcome by using pyrvinium (PYR), a pharmacological activator
  of GSK3 beta associated degradation complex.
