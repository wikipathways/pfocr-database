caption: Following myectomy injury, Fgf signaling promotes myocyte cell reprogramming
  and dedifferentiation by activating caspase 3, among others. The known roles of
  Fgf and our preliminary results () suggest that Fgf may also play a role in the
  regulation of cell migration and redifferentiation. Fgf signal through the Mek/Erk
  pathway to activate, at early stages of muscle regeneration, ERK2.
