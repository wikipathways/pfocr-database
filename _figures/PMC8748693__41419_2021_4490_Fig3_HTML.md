caption: 'Several metabolic pathways are involved in the regulation of ferroptosis,
  including: (i) iron-Fenton reaction (black). ROS are produced by the Fenton reaction
  that is driven by excessive iron, which can be derived from the import of extracellular
  iron and the supply of intracellular stored iron via ferritinophagy. (ii) GPX4 antioxidant
  activity (brown and blue). Suppression of lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis occurrence
  largely depends on GPX4 activity, which relies on GSH and IPP-derived Sec. Cystine
  import by the amino acid antiporter system  and mevalonate routes are necessary
  for GSH and IPP production, respectively. Additionally, IPP-derived CoQ inhibits
  ferroptosis mediated by FSP1 in the cytosol or by DHODH in mitochondria. (iii) Lipid
  metabolism pathway (green). The oxidation of PUFA and AA is also involved in ferroptosis.'
