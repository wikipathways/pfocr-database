caption: Glutamate oxidation via the TCA cycle coupled to the urea cycle after TBIThis
  schematic illustrates how glutamate can be used as an alternative fuel source when
  pyruvate carbons are prevented from entering the TCA cycle (bold arrows). The blue
  shaded metabolites represent the metabolites participating in glutamate metabolism.
  Bolded metabolites represent molecules measured in this study. Pyruvate and lactate
  metabolites are shaded in purple to illustrate that glycolysis and the TCA cycle
  are decoupled from one another, following acute TBI. Select enzymes discussed are
  italicized. TBI is known to damage and impair pyruvate dehydrogenase and coenzyme
  A (CoASH). This pathway bypasses the need for the first several steps of the TCA
  cycle that couple glucose metabolism to the TCA cycle and are blocked in the context
  of TBI. The TCA cycle continues on to generate high energy intermediates (red and
  dark purple) that facilitate oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway ultimately
  produces citrulline, nitric oxide (NO) by nitric oxide synthases and urea via the
  arginine to ornithine branch. This figure was created with BioRender.com.
