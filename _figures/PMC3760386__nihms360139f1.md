caption: Metabolic activation pathway of FAU []. FAU is first phosphorylated by intracellular
  thymidine kinase (TK) to form 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosyl) uracil monophosphate
  (FAUMP), which is then methylated by thymidine synthase (TS) to form methylated
  product FMAUMP [1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro- β-D-arabinofuranosyl) 5-methyluracil monophosphate].
  The methylated product FMAU can be incorporated into DNA and thus causing cell death.
papertitle: Simultaneous determination of 1-(2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosyl)
  uracil (FAU) and 1-(2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro- β-D-arabinofuranosyl 5-methyluracil (FMAU)
  in human plasma by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.
