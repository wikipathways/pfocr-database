caption: A working model of root and shoot mechanisms in autoregulation of nodulation
  (AON). Legumes regulate nodulation in response to pre-existing infections and soil
  nitrogen levels. Nitrate induces the production of a nitrate-induced CLE peptide
  (NIC1; A) that acts locally in the root via the AON receptor kinase, NARK (B; or
  its orthologues in other species), to inhibit nodule progression (C). NARK may act
  in concert with other components to perceive NIC1. Rhizobia-induced CLE peptides
  (RICs) are induced at several stages of nodule development and may be transported
  via the xylem (D) to the shoot. In the shoot, NARK and possibly also CLV2, KLV and
  CRN are required for the perception of these putative ligands (E). Two kinase-associated
  protein phosphatases (KAPP1/2) are phosphorylated by NARK and in turn dephosphorylate
  the NARK kinase (F). An equilibrium of phosphorylation between these components
  may be required preceding the production of the shoot-derived inhibitor (SDI; G).
  SDI is transported via the phloem to the roots where it inhibits further nodule
  progression and cell divisions (H). A compound similar to SDI may also be involved
  in the nitrate pathway that acts locally to inhibit the progression of nodule formation
  (C).
