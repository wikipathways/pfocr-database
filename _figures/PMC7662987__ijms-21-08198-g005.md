caption: Schematic display of antitumor activity of CUDC-907 hybrid drug against prostate
  cancer cells. Synergistic anti-cancer activity of CUDC-907 is illustrated by its
  inhibition of HDACs activity and PI3K/Akt pathway []. Increase in histone 4 acetylation
  and reduced activation of PI3K/Akt confirms its dual action on HDAC and PI3K. Outcome
  of these effects resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, increase in DNA damage
  due to downregulation of DNA damage repair response proteins, and apoptosis because
  of downregulation of c-myc and antiapoptotic Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL proteins, and upregulation
  of pro-apoptosis protein Bim (blunt end lines indicate inhibition, upward arrows
  indicate upregulation and downward arrows indicate downregulation of proteins).
