caption: Model in which ATE1 R-transferases regulate homeostasis of G-protein signaling
  in cardiomyocytes through arginylation of RGS4 (and RGS5 and RGS16 as well). In
  this model, N-terminal Met is cotranslationally cleaved off by Met aminopeptidases
  (Met Aps), exposing the pro-N-degron Cys-2 at the N terminus. In normally growing
  embryos, the Cys-2 residue is oxidized into CysO2(H) or CysO3(H) and subsequently
  arginylated by ATE1 R-transferases, producing the N-degron Arg, which is recognized
  by N-recognins containing the UBR box. The degradation of RGS4 through the N-end
  rule pathway leads to the activation of G-protein signaling and thus cell proliferation.
  However, if the Cys-2 residue is not readily oxidized, for example in ischemia,
  RGS4 is accumulated and turns down G-protein signaling. This mechanism may represent
  a sensor of oxygen or its derivative in the cardiovascular system.
