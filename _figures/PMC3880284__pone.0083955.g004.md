caption: A list of 37 proteins was recognized by ingenuity pathway analysis software
  to build a connectivity network. This network was highly associated to cancer (p-value = 5.9E-12)
  and integrates the data from the list of proteins identified in control (grey-filled
  circles), in estrogen (green-filled circles), in tamoxifen (red-filled circles)
  or in both estrogen and tamoxifen (yellow-filled circles) treatments. Some molecules
  (unfilled) were added by IPA software to complete the pathway. The proteins known
  to be regulated by estrogen (surrounded by an orange outline), by tamoxifen (surrounded
  by violet outline) or both (surrounded by blue outline) are also indicated.
