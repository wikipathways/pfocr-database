caption: Contribution of autophagy-lysosomal pathway and α-syn secreted in Parkinson’s
  disease. (A) In normal conditions, it is possible to detect monomers of alpha-synuclein
  (α-syn), which are degraded by Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS), and oligomers
  of α-syn are efficiently degraded by Autophagy-Lysosomal (ALP) pathway or can be
  secreted by exosomes. Both degradation and secretion processes occur in a coordinate
  balance. (B) On Parkinson’s Disease condition, abundant oligomers and fibrils of
  α-syn are formed, and it less degraded by autophagy due to an impairment of this
  pathway, and it is possible to observe an increased secretion of α-syn by exosomes.
