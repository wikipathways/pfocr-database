caption: 'Regulation of autophagy pathway in ischemic stroke. Brain ischemia leads
  to diminished oxygen and glucose supply to the brain, causing multiple metabolic
  changes. Exposed in nutrient-depleted condition, the ratio of AMP/ATP in brain cells
  becomes higher, which is a major stimulus for AMPK activation. Activated AMPK initiates
  autophagy through a direct and indirect pathway. In a direct pathway, AMPK activates
  the ULK1 complex by phosphorylating ULK1 at several serine residues, while in indirect
  pathway, AMPK activates it by inhibiting mTORC1. In IS, accumulated misfolded proteins
  disrupt the balance between the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathway.
  Increased BAG3 and HDAC6 initiate the conversion of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
  to autophagy-lysosome pathway. A study shows that knockdown DRAM1 inactivates the
  autophagy pathway through blocking the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome, indicating
  the role of DRAM1 in the autophagy pathway. Abbreviation: mTOR, mammalian target
  of rapamycin; AMPK, 5’-Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ULK1 Unc-51-like
  kinase 1; ATG, autophagy related proteins; FIP, focal adhesion kinase family interacting
