caption: Diagram summarizing the two proposed GA-signaling pathways in rice.  (Model
  A) Gα works in high sensitive GA receptor  system. There may be an alternative GA
  receptor system for low  sensitivity to GA that does not involve Gα. High sensitive  α-amylase
  induction and internode elongation by GA may be mediated  mainly through the high
  sensitive reception system (red), whereas leaf  sheath elongation may be through
  the low sensitive reception system  (blue). (Model B) Gα works in a pathway that
  regulates  the GA signaling. α-Amylase induction and internode elongation may be  regulated
  mainly by this pathway to result in high sensitivities to GA  (red), whereas leaf
  sheath elongation may be not regulated by this  pathway to result in low sensitivity
  to GA (blue). The SLR protein  works at the downstream site of these two pathways.
