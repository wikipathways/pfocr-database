caption: The circuit disruption underlying the hypodopaminergic state is reversed
  by ketamine. (A) ilPFC hyperactivity increases BLA activity. BLA excitatory drive
  induces RE hyperexcitability which also may be a resultant of ilPFC inputs through
  TRN. RE projections disrupt the vHIP activity and its connectivity with NAc. Impairment
  of vHIP activity decreases the GABAergic tone from NAc to VP. VP excitability is
  resulting from a decreased NAc inhibitory drive and increased BLA excitatory drive.
  The increased inhibitory output of VP inhibits VTA and leads to a hypodopaminergic
  state. (B) Ketamine normalizes the hypodopaminergic state by downregulating the
  BLA activity in response to ilPFC activity restoration. The inputs coming from BLA
  and ilPFC are proposed to regulate the RE activity normalization. RE may represent
  one important neurobiological pathway underlying the reestablishment of the vHIP
  and NAc connectivity. Stabilization of NAc and BLA activity decreases the activity
  of VP inhibitory inputs to the VTA which ultimately restores dopaminergic activity.
  ilPFC, the infralimbic portion of the medial prefrontal cortex; BLA, basolateral
  amygdala; TRN, thalamic reticular nucleus; RE, reuniens thalamic nucleus; vHIP,
