caption: Enrichment plots from GSEA analysis. GSEA analysis showed that translational
  elongation, mitochondrial membrane organization, mitotic nuclear division, nucleoside
  monophosphate biosynthetic process, and mismatch repair oxidative phosphorylation
  was differentially enriched in the S100A16 high expression phenotype. Leukocyte
  tethering or rolling, regulation of CAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, negative
  regulation of CAMP-mediated signal, regulation of glutamate receptor signaling pathway,
  regulation of AMPA receptor activity, and regulation of excretion was differentially
  enriched in the low expression phenotype of S100A16. Translational elongation, mitochondrial
  membrane organization, mitotic nuclear division, nucleoside monophosphate biosynthetic
  process, and mismatch repair oxidative phosphorylation was differentially enriched
  in the low expression phenotype of S100A16. (A) Protein-protein interaction network
  for S100A16 in PDAC (B).
