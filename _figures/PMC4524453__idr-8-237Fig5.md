caption: 'Mutational routes to SCV formation.Notes: The diagram shows part of the
  cdG/RsmA signaling network in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hypothetical SCV-inducing
  mutations in uncharacterized DGCs are included. Signaling systems where mutations
  have been implicated in clinically relevant SCV formation are circled. Activating
  signals are denoted with arrows, suppression with bars. Purple hexagons represent
  cdG molecules. Pathways where the link to SCV is hypothetical or uncertain are marked
  with question marks (?). The dashed arrow refers to a pathway where the relationship
  to clinical SCV formation is currently unclear.Abbreviations: SCV, small colony
  variant; DGC, diguanylate cyclase.'
