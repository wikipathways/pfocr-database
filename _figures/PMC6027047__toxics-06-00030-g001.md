  (PhIP), 5-methylchrysene, and tamoxifen are shown as prototypes of procarcinogens.
  Bioactivation is carried out with phase I and/or phase II enzymes, which lead to
  the formation of DNA adducts. AA-I undergoes nitro-reduction through NAD(P)H:quinone
  oxidoreductase (NQO1), cytochrome P450s 1A1 and 1A2, NADPH:P450 reductase (POR)
  or prostaglandin H synthase (COX). The resulting N-hydroxyaristolactam-I is bioactivated
  by SULTs to form an unstable N-sulfoxy ester, which quickly undergoes heterolytic
  cleavage to produce the reactive nitrenium/carbenium intermediate that forms dA-AL-I
  and other DNA adducts. PhIP undergoes N-hydroxylation by P450s, then it is further
  bioactivated by NATs or SULTs to form N-acetoxy or N-sulfoxy esters, which lead
  to the formation of dG-C8-PhIP through the nitrenium intermediate. 5-Methylchrysene
  undergoes epoxidation (P450s 1A1 and 1B1) followed by epoxide hydroxylation (epoxide
  hydrolase) on the bay-region phenyl ring, to form the corresponding trans-1,2-dihydrodiol-5-methylchrysene.
  A subsequent round of monooxygenation leads to the formation of anti-1,2-dihydrodiol-3,4-epoxide-5-methylchrysene,
  which can form a DNA adduct at the N2-atom of dG (dG-N2-5-methylchrysene-diolepoxide).
  Two pathways are involved in the DNA adduct formation of the bioactivated tamoxifen.
  In the first pathway, oxidation of the allylic ethyl side chain results in the formation
  of α-hydroxytamoxifen. The subsequent esterification catalyzed by SULTs leads to
  the reactive carbenium intermediate and the dG-N2-α-hydroxytamoxifen adduct. The
  second pathway involves aryl-oxidation of one of the phenyl rings to yield 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  quinone methide, a reactive electrophile that can form the DNA adducts. Both pathways
  lead to (Z)- or (E)-dG-N2-4-hydroxytamoxifen.
