caption: Network analysis obtained from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of aberrantly
  (p ≤ 0.05) regulated proteins between recurrence (R) and recurrence-free (RF) patients.
  Official gene symbols and relative expression values for each protein are depicted.
  For detailed information on aberrantly regulated proteins see Table S3.
