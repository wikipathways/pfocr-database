caption: 'Metabolic pathway of xylose degradation, glycolysis, and fermentation in
  Z. mobilis 8b strain. The box adjacent to the enzyme contains gene expression information
  from Additional file : Table S2-1, Table S2-6. The top row is for sugar effect:
  xylose-responsive genes compared to glucose in log phase without or with the supplementation
  of exogenous acetate from left to right column respectively, and the middle row
  is for acetate effect in log phase when exogenous acetate was added into single
  sugar of glucose or xylose respectively, from left to right column (Additional file
  : Table S2-1). The bottom row is for acetate effect in mixed sugar in log, transition,
  or stationary phase respectively, from left to right column (Additional file : Table
  S2-6). Absolute values greater than 1.5-fold (number in the box is log2-based value)
  were used, with red-filled box indicating upregulation and blue-filled box downregulation.'
