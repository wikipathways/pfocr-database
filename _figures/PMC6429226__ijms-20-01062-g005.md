caption: 'Apoptosis can be modulated by the activity of polyphenols in prostate cancer.
  Induction of apoptosis takes place through three main mechanisms: extrinsic, intrinsic,
  and perforin/granzyme pathways []. In the extrinsic pathway, activation of transmembrane
  death receptors (Fas/TNFR/DR) by their ligands (FasL/TNFα/TRAIL) induces the recruitment
  of FADD and further results in triggering of caspase-8 action. Mitochondrial release
  of cytochrome c, provoked by the truncated BID protein, induces the formation of
  the apoptosome and activation of caspase-9, which in turn activate caspase-3 and
  -7. The intrinsic pathway cross-talks with the extrinsic pathway at the mitochondrial
  level, where the BH-3 family of proteins (Noxa, Bmf, Puma, Hkr, Bik, etc.) promotes
  apoptosis through Bax/Bak assembly. The regulation of the apoptotic pathways is
  coordinated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which consists of both pro-apoptotic
  members (Bax, Bak) and anti-apoptotic members (Bcl-2). The cytotoxicity mediated
  by immune cells (i.e., cytotoxic T lymphocytes) occurs through pore formation in
  the membrane of the target cells. This pore can be formed with the help of pore-forming
  proteins (perforin) and is used to deliver proteases (granzymes), which in turn
  will trigger the apoptotic pathway [,]. The pro-apoptotic molecules that are upregulated
  by polyphenols in prostate cancer are caspase-3 (apigenin, gallic acid, gingerol,
  EGCG, quercetin), caspase-8 (apigenin, gallic acid, EGCG, quercetin), caspase-9
  (apigenin, gallic acid, EGCG, quercetin), cytochrome c (gallic acid), Bax (apigenin,
  EGCG, quercetin), TRAIL (apigenin), and DR (apigenin), while the anti-apoptotic
  molecules that are downregulated are Bcl-2 (apigenin, gingerol, EGCG, and quercetin).
