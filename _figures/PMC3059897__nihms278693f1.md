caption: Schematic representation of V(D)J recombination in the context of the cell
  cycle. Gene segments are shown as filled boxes, and recombination signals sequences
  (RSS) as triangles. For the joining phase, only gene segments are shown, as the
  excised RSS-flanked DNA fragments are omitted for clarity. RAG1 protein expression
  is constant throughout the cell cycle, whereas RAG2 is degraded at the onset of
  S phase. The T490A mutation (red line) keeps RAG2 stable even in S and G2-M. RAG
  cleavage products are largely repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) during
  G01–G1 phase, with alternative end-joining (A-EJ) serving as a back-up pathway.
  At the entry to S phase, degradation of RAG2 facilitates the completion of the joining
  phase of V(D)J recombination, and subsequently no new DNA cleavage is initiated.
  In contrast, RAG2 T490A does not affect V(D)J recombination in G0–G1, but it now
  allows for DNA cleavage in S phase. Although some end-joining might still occur
  exclusively by canonical NHEJ activities, DNA repair at this point largely involves
  homologous recombination (HR) repair factors. The latter scenario can lead to translocations,
  but the survival of respective cells is suppressed by p53.
