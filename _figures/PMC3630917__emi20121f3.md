caption: The SARS-CoV life cycle in host cells and its S protein structure. Life cycle
  of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV begins its life cycle when its S protein binds to the cellular
  receptor ACE2. After receptor binding, the conformation change in the S protein
  facilitates viral envelope fusion with the cell membrane through the endosomal pathway.
  Then SARS-CoV releases RNA into the host cell. Genome RNA is translated into viral
  replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, which are then cleaved into small products
  by viral proteinases. At the same time, polymerase, which produces a series of subgenomic
  mRNAs by discontinuous transcription, is finally translated into relevant viral
  proteins. Viral proteins and genome RNA are subsequently assembled into virions
  in the ER and Golgi, which are budding into the lumen of the ERGIC and then transported
  via vesicles and released out of the cell. ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2;
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC, ER–Golgi intermediate compartment.
