caption: Survival pathways in CML progenitors and stem cells. In Bcr-Abl-expressing
  cell lines and CML progenitors, the binding of SCF to its receptor activates the
  PI3K pathway resulting in mTOR and Akt activation. In the absence of Bcr-Abl activity,
  the inhibition of mTOR is sufficient to induce cell death. In stem cells, survival
  is less dependent on the Bcr-Abl activity and was not affected by the mTOR inhibition.
  The activation of the c-kit/PI3K pathway is sufficient to sustain cell survival
papertitle: PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors sensitize chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells
  to nilotinib and restore the response of progenitors to nilotinib in the presence
  of stem cell factor.
