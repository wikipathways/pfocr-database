caption: (A)  Innate immune response in lung tissue with or without viral mRNA. The
  top bar of the individual gene heat maps was created by combining expression data
  for samples Day 2 A (I+P+), Day 2A (I+), and Day 7 B (I+), where viral mRNA was
  detected by array. The bottom bar was created by combining expression data for samples
  Day 2 A, Day 2 B, Day 4 A, Day 4 B, and Day 7 A, where no viral mRNA was detected.
  As in classical heat maps, brighter colors indicate stronger gene induction in combined
  samples, with red signifying upregulation and green downregulation. This illustrates
  the significant impact of the presence (top bar) or absence (bottom bar) of influenza
  viral mRNA on gene expression, even among essentially similarly affected portions
  of the same lung or among animals that were all infected. We selected probes with
  the strongest signals for any one gene for the purpose of these diagrams. All shown
  data are the results of comparing the combined gene expression in the lungs of experimental
  animals, as described above, versus gene expression in the lungs of mock-infected
  animals (pooled). This figure was produced using Resolver 4.0 (Rosetta Biosoftware)
  and Pathway Builder Tool (Protein Lounge, San Diego, CA). (B) T- and B-cell regulation
  in lung tissue with or without viral mRNA. All red arrows indicate activation and/or
  secretion. All black arrows indicate inhibitory interactions. The top bar of each
  heat map anchor was created by combining data from ratio experiments for Day 2 A
  (I+P+), Day 2 (I+), and Day 7 B (I+), in which viral mRNA was detected by array.
  The bottom bar of each heat map anchor was created by combining data from ratio
  experiments for Day 2 A, Day 2 B, Day 4 A, Day 4 B, and Day 7 A. This illustrates
  the significant impact of the presence or absence of influenza viral mRNA on gene

    The top bar of the individual gene heat maps was created by combining expression
