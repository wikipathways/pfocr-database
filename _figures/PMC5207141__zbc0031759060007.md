caption: Summary of NAE metabolism via hydrolysis, oxidation, and glucosylation-malonylation.
  Saturated (NAE 12:0) and polyunsaturated (NAE 18:2 and NAE 18:3) NAEs are hydrolyzed
  by FAAH to generate ethanolamine and free fatty acids. There is also evidence that
  NAE 18:2 and NAE 18:3 undergo oxidation by LOX to generate hydroperoxides. The pathway
  reported here shows that NAE 12:0 is glucosylated by an unknown glucosyltransferase,
  and the glucose-NAE 12:0 conjugate is malonylated by PMAT1.
