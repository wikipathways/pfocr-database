caption: The roles of selected long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs)
  in regulating virtually all important signalling pathways relevant to colorectal
  cancer (CRC) are shown. Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway, which leads to enhanced
  proliferation and can modulate treatment responses, can occur via downregulation
  of miR-143 and/or upregulation of miR-31 (1). miR-21, the most frequently overexpressed
  miRNA in CRC, can favour cancer progression by targeting PTEN, preventing PIP3 dephosphorylation
  and resulting in hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT pathway (2). In addition, miR-21
  can target PDCD4, which is thought to be an important mediator in apoptosis effector
  pathways. (3)In the presence of DNA damage, p53 holds the cell cycle at the G1-S
  checkpoint to allow DNA repair or to induce apoptosis if repair is not possible.
  In a positive feedback loop, p53 increases the expression of miR-34a (which is frequently
  downregulated in CRC), resulting in enhanced p53 activity (4). Moreover, miR-34a
  directly targets SMAD4, a key effector in TGFβ signalling. Thus, downregulation
  of miR-34a enhances TGFβ signalling and results in enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) and tumour cell invasion, (5). Loss of E-cadherin in epithelial
  cells leads to a loss of contact inhibition, which favours cell growth, migration
  and invasion via β-catenin-TCF signalling (6). In CRC cells, miR-29a and the lncRNA
  HOTAIR have been described to decrease the expression of E-cadherin. miR-135 directly
  targets and downregulates APC, which, under normal conditions, degrades β-catenin,
  resulting in downstream activation of the WNT-β-catenin pathway (7). When tumours
  grow rapidly, hypoxia stimulates the formation of new blood vessels through angiogenesis,
  which is crucial for tumour survival and is regulated by the VEGF pathway. VEGF
  is a direct target of miR-126 and is also repressed by the lncRNA GAS5, and both
  are frequently downregulated in CRC, (8).
