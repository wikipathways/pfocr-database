caption: Maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree (A) based on concatenated sequences of
  proteins involved in signaling pathways. Homologs with E values of 1 × 10−20 or
  less in at least one organism were chosen for the analysis. Bootstrap values based
  on 1,000 replicates are shown on nodes. Wnt signaling pathway modules (B) and cell
  adhesion modules (C) found through sequence similarity with equivalent human homologs
  and mapped to respective standard KEGG pathways (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html).
  The intensity ranging from yellow to red denotes the percent identity of the sponge
  transcript (or a fragment thereof) match to a human protein. Many of the identified
  similarities, especially in the low-identity range, are shared domains of a human
  multidomain protein. Legend for panels (B) and (C) shown at the bottom.
