caption: Entry of negative strand RNA virus mRNA into the host translation machinery.
  Cartoon depicts the cycle of translation initiation for a host mRNA (depicted in
  black with a blue circle depicting the M7 guanine cap) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
  where it is recruited by the cap-binding complex eIF4F through its cap moiety and
  delivered to the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is primed with the eIF2 complex bound
  to Methionine tRNA (tRNA not depicted). The final step in the process is the recruitment
  of the 80S ribosomal subunit and the initiation of translation. Negative strand
  RNA viruses produce capped mRNA that is generally presumed to be recruited to the
  ribosome through host machinery such as eIF4F. In this diagram, viral mRNA is shown
  in red, and is depicted as exiting from the site of viral mRNA synthesis to be recruited
  into the same pathway as host mRNAs. This cartoon depicts viral mRNA completely
  displacing host mRNA from the translation process, but varying degrees of host protein
  synthesis inhibition are seen during virus infect, suggesting different levels of
  dominance at the translation initiation step.
