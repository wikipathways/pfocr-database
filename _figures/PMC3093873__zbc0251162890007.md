caption: 'Model for the allosteric communication between AAA+ modules in Hsp104. A,
  conformational coupling between NBD1 domains is the mechanistic basis for the trans
  interaction of protomers and propagates nucleotide-induced structural rearrangements
  across the hexamer. NBD1 can adopt two states that differ in their ATPase activity:
  T (square, low activity) and R (circle, high activity). The transition between the
  two states is concerted, i.e. it occurs simultaneously in a number of NBD1s, two
  of which are depicted here in white and gray. ATP binding to NBD1 stabilizes the
  T state, whereas ATP hydrolysis induces the transition to the R state. B, the trans
  interaction of NBD1 co-ordinates the behavior of NBD2 in the Hsp104 hexamer. Depicted
  are two of six protomers in gray and white. Similar to NBD1 (top), NBD2 (bottom)
  can adopt T and R states with differing ATPase activity. However, the T↔ R transition
  in NBD2 is inversely linked to the T↔ R transition in NBD1. ATP binding to NBD1
  induces a concerted transition of NBD1 to the T state. Adoption of the T state is
  propagated to NBD2 using a NBD1→NBD2 cis pathway. It triggers a conformational change
  of NBD2 to the R state and stimulates nucleotide exchange, thereby strongly activating
  ATP turnover in this domain. ATP hydrolysis in NBD1 triggers the co-operative transition
  of NBD1 to the R state and concomitantly causes NBD2 to revert to the T state. C,
  nucleotide occupancy in NBD2 modulates the affinity of NBD1 toward ATP. When NBD2
  is occupied with ADP (or empty), NBD1 adopts an open conformation with a low affinity
  toward ATP (R state). Binding of ATP to NBD2 induces a conformation of NBD1 to which
  ATP binds more tightly (T state). ATP hydrolysis in NBD2 facilitates the transition
  of NBD1 to the R state. D, allosteric model for ATP hydrolysis in Hsp104 is shown.
