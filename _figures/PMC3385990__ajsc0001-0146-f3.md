caption: 'Gp130 mediated IL-6 family of cytokines signaling pathway. (Left) In the
  wild type gp130 mouse, IL-6 family of cytokines can activate STAT family proteins
  especially STAT3 and STAT1 depending on the YXXQ phosphorylation motif on four distinct
  tyrosines of gp130 or they can activate the SHP-2/ERK MAPK pathway depending on
  the YXXV phosphorylation motif on Y759 . (Right) In gp130FXXQ knockin mouse, tyrosines
  at the 767, 814, 905, and 915 YXXQ motifs was blocked by phenylalanine replacement
  thus preventing STAT family binding to gp130. Therefore, gp130FXXQ mice have lost
  gp130-mediated STAT1/3 activation. There are three possible explanations: (1) STAT3
  is still activated in HSC via non-receptor tyrosine kinase (2) Function of STAT3
  is perfectly counterbalanced by STAT1. (3) Function of STAT3 is exactly counterbalanced
  by unknown effectors that also dock with gp130FXXQ.'
