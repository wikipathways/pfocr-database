caption: Schematic diagram of postreceptor adaptations of the cAMP pathway observed
  in response to chronic antidepressant treatment. The cAMP signal transduction pathway
  is upregulated by chronic antidepressant administration. This includes increased
  coupling of stimulatory G-protein (Gs) to adenylyl cyclase, increased levels of
  cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and increased expression of the cAMP response
  element-binding protein (CREB). Target genes of CREB (e.g., BDNF) are also upregulated
  by antidepressant treatment. In addition to regulation of CREB by receptors that
  are directly coupled to the cAMP pathway (i.e., βAR, 5-HT4,6,7), other 5-HT and
  norepinephrine (NE) receptors that indirectly stimulate Ca2+-dependent kinases may
  also activate CREB. The results of the present study demonstrate that chronic antidepressant
  treatment increases the expression of PDE4A and PDE4B. Upregulation of these PDE4
  isoforms would be expected to dampen the cAMP response. Although this may be adaptive
  in normal brain, it could also dampen the antidepressant responses that are mediated
  by upregulation of this pathway. Selective inhibitors would block the upregulated
  PDE4A and PDE4B and could thereby enhance the cAMP and antidepressant responses.
