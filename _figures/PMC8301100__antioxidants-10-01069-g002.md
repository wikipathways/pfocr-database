caption: Contribution of the Nrf2 pathway to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease
  and Alzheimer’s Disease. In PD, an increase in the dopamine release could affect
  mitochondrial function, producing an increase in ROS levels affecting Nrf2 activity
  and the response against the oxidative damage. Additionally, the decrease in Parkin
  and PINK expression levels shown in PD could affect mitochondrial function, inducing
  depolarization, fragmentation, respiratory deficiency, and ATP reduction. These
  changes will affect synaptic function, contributing to neurodegeneration and cognitive
  impairment present in PD. In AD, the GSK-3β protein, which is a kinase that promotes
  the anomalous phosphorylation of tau protein, promotes Nrf2 degradation by proteasome
  activity through the Fyn’s phosphorylation. Additionally, during AD, activated GSK-3β
  induces tau hyperphosphorylation, which could affect mitochondrial function. Later
  on, the accumulation of pathological forms of tau could lead to the formation of
  neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which is considered a hallmark in AD.
