caption: Spatiotemporal regulation of feeding response by O-GlcNAcylation. (Left)
  Acute postprandial response. During early insulin signaling, OGT remains in the
  cytosol. Insulin binds to insulin receptor (IR) and triggers its autophosphorylation.
  Phosphorylation of IR recruits IRS1 to be phosphorylated, after which IRS1 binds
  to PI3K. PI3K catalyzes the production of PIP3, which recruits PDK1 to be phosphorylated
  and activated. Activated PDK1 phosphorylates and activates AKT, which further phosphorylates
  and activated downstream targets, including GSK3β and FOXO, which enhances glycogen
  synthesis and suppresses gluconeogenesis. (Right) Prolonged postprandial response.
  The insulin signaling pathway needs to be attenuated after a period of stimulation
  in order to maintain homeostasis. O-GlcNAcylation of insulin signal proteins contributes
  to the attenuation of the pathway. During prolonged insulin signaling, OGT translocates
  to the plasma membrane and binds with PIP3 through the PIP3-binding domain. OGT
  is then phosphorylated and activated by IR. Activated OGT O-GlcNAcylates key insulin
  signaling proteins including IRS1, PI3K, PDK1, and AKT, antagonizing the activation
  by phosphorylation on these proteins. These events lead to decreased glycogen synthesis
  and increased gluconeogenesis.
