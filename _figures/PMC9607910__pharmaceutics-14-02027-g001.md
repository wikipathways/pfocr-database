caption: '(A) The bladder cancer dual pathway involves the presence of papillary or
  non-papillary lesions. papillary lesions harbor mutations in FGFR3, TERT, PIP3,
  and deletion of CDKN2A on Chromosome 9. Papillary lesions typically present as NMIBC.
  Non-papillary lesions include mutation of TERT, PIP3, FGFR3, p53, Rb1, and deletion
  of CDKN2A on chromosome 9. Non-papillary lesions typically describe MIBC. (B) The
  bladder consists of four layers: the epithelium, submucosa, detrusor muscle, and
  parietal peritoneum. Staging for bladder cancer is depicted in this figure. Tumors
  are classified based on the TNM grading system where T describes the primary tumor
  in terms of its size and tissue penetration. N characterizes the involvement, or
  lack thereof, lymph nodes. M describes the presence of absence of metastasis. MIBC
  is characterized by being T2 and can present with or without nodal or metastatic
  involvement.'
