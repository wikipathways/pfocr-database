caption: (left) Nucleic acid sensors that respond to viral infection detect viral
  nucleic acids as foreign, thereby leading to the production and action of IFN. Sensors
  include the RIG-I and MDA5 cytosolic helicases and their mitochondrial membrane-associated
  adaptor IPS-1; the Toll-like receptor TLR3 that acts through the TRIF adaptor; TLRs
  7, 8 and 9 that act through the MyD88 adaptor; and, RNA polymerase III that acts
  through IPS-1. RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3 sense dsRNA, and pol III senses cytosolic dsDNA
  to produce dsRNA. TLRs 7 and 8 sense ssRNA, and TLR9 CpG-rich DNA. These nucleic
  acid sensors trigger antiviral innate immunity through activation of factors that
  lead to transcriptional activation of IFN production. (right) Signaling by types
  I, II and III interferons through the canonical JAK-STAT pathway is illustrated,
  leading to the transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes. Among the IFN-induced
  gene products are ADAR1 and PKR, both of which bind dsRNA and possess enzymatic
  activity, one (PKR) regulated by dsRNA and the other (ADAR1) utilizing dsRNA as
  a substrate. Adapted from Samuel [].
