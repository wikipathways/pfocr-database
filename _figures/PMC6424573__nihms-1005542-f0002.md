caption: 'NO is produced from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) of which there
  are three isoforms: neuronal NOS1 (nNOS), endothelial NOS3 (eNOS) and inducible
  NOS2 (iNOS). NO targets guanylate cyclase-1 (GC-1), a heterodimeric protein capable
  of converting GMP to cGMP. cGMP produced by GC-1 can target cGMP-gated ion channels,
  and activate downstream kinase signaling cascades. Phosphodiesterase enzymes (PDE)
  bind to cGMP and catalyse its breakdown into GMP – PDEs act as important regulators
  of signal transduction mediated by cGMP. cGMP bioavailability in the cell can be
  modulated in two ways: 1) through the use of GC-1 stimulators and activators, which
  increase production of cGMP, or, 2) through the use of PDE inhibitors which prevent
  the breakdown of cGMP in the cell.'
