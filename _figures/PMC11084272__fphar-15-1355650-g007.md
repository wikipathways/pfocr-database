caption: Mechanism of action of multifunctional FYD in preventing cancer metastasis.
  FYD interrupts adhesion of CTCs to vascular endothelium by suppressing CAMs through
  inhibition of the TNF-α-stimulated NF-кB signal pathways in endothelial cells. Additionally,
  FYD reduces motility of CTCs by regulating EMT, PI3K/AKT and FAK signaling pathways,
  thereby the inhibiting transendothelial migration (extravasation) of CTCs. Furthermore,
  FYD enhances anti-cancer immune responses by substantially increasing the subsets
  of Tc and NK cells in the peripheral immune system. The combined effects of FYD
  resulted in the continuous exposure of CTCs to the hostile microenvironment of the
  bloodstream, rendering them susceptible to death induced by anoikis, shear stress,
  and immune elimination
