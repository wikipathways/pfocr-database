caption: Biosynthetic pathway of menaquinone in Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus
  lactis covered in this review. Metabolic pathways engineered in microorganisms for
  production of vitamin K were displayed. The prenyl chain structures are synthesized
  by the MEP pathway in B. subtilis and by the MVA pathway in L. lactis subsp. cremoris.
  The naphthoquinone ring structure is synthesized by the shikimate pathway and connected
  to side chains by the menaquinone pathway. The brown square with a dotted line refers
  to the pathway of menaquinone-7 synthesizing in B. subtilis. The blue square with
  a dotted line refers to the pathway of menaquinones synthesizing in L. lactis subsp.
  cremoris. The enzymes in bold were overexpressed to increase vitamin K production
  in the previous studies. PYR, pyruvate; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; DXP, 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate;
