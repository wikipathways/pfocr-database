caption: Changes in different metabolites and their metabolic pathways in MRSA biofilms
  treated with or without AS. The red font indicates the differentially altered metabolite
  in the pathway. The yellow background indicates that the level of the metabolite
  increased, and the green background indicates a decrease. The blue dashed boxes
  indicate pathways in which metabolic biomarkers of the MRSA biofilm are involved
  in the absence of the intervention. Pink dashed boxes indicate pathways in which
  pharmacodynamic metabolic markers of AS are involved.
