caption: TNFα-regulated major cellular signaling pathways. Binding of TNFα to TNFR1/2
  leads to the rapid phosphorylation of the NF-κB, ERK, p38, and JNK pathways, and
  activates a group of transcription factors, such as NF-κB, Elk1, and AP-1, in the
  nucleus. In addition to these pro-survival pathways, TNF-α can induce apoptosis
  through receptor-mediated caspase activation, and caspase-dependent and -independent
  components of the mitochondrial cell death pathway. A balance between these intracellular
  signaling pathways determines whether cells will die or survive after exposure to
  TNF-α. TNFα-mediated ROS generation is mainly derived from mitochondria and membrane-associated
  NADPH oxidase, which contributes to signaling pathways. JNK, c-Jun N-terminal Kinase.
