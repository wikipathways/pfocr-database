caption: Schematic showing methionine metabolism reactions. The metabolites methionine,
  SAM, SAH, homocysteine, cystathionine, choline, and betaine were measured by LC-MS/MS.
  The neuronal mitochondrial metabolite NAA, a marker of neuronal respiratory capacity,
  was also measured in this study by HPLC. In the methionine cycle, the essential
  amino acid methionine is converted to SAM by MAT. Upon donating a methyl group,
  SAM is converted to SAH. SAH is converted to homocysteine by SAH hydrolase (AHCY).
  Homocysteine is then remethylated to methionine by the B12-dependent enzyme MTR
  with the methyl group transferred from folate-derived 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF)
  to B12 (cobalamin) to homocysteine. Betaine can be supplied in the diet or through
  the oxidation of choline in mitochondria. BHMT catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine
  to methionine with betaine as the methyl donor. Methylation of histones is catalyzed
  by histone methyltransferases (HMTs), which transfer a methyl group from SAM to
  amino acids on histone amino-terminal tails. The methionine cycle is linked to GSH
  production through the transulfuration pathway. The first step in this pathway is
  catalyzed by CBS with vitamin B6 as a cofactor. GSH is involved in maintaining redox
  homeostasis in cells. THF, Tetrahydrofolate; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; CBS, cystathionine-β-synthase;
  MTR, methionine synthase; MAT, methionine adenosyl transferase.
