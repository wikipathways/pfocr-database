caption: 'The regulatory structure of the Snf1 pathway. The regulatory graph depicts
  the information flow through the NR1 network as a bipartite-directed graph. Elemental
  reactions (red nodes) produce or consume elemental states (blue nodes) via reaction
  edges, which correspond to the edges in the reaction graph (). The elemental states
  in turn influence the elemental reactions via contingency edges, and they define
  contextual constraints on reactions. The inputs in form of external stimuli can
  be found at the top of the picture, as grey nodes with node names in square brackets.
  The cytoplasmic reactions and SNF1 complex formation are found in the middle part,
  and the nuclear reactions at the bottom with the transcriptional output again as
  grey nodes with names in square brackets. Information passes through the network
  along the unidirectional edges, either by production (blue edges) or consumption
  (purple edges) of elemental states by reactions, or by the regulatory effect of
  elemental states on elemental reactions. Positive contingencies from activating
  states to activated reactions are denoted in green, while inhibitory contingencies
  appear in red. More complex requirements, such as formation of the active forms
  of the SNF1 complex, are defined by Boolean states that are indicated as white triangles
  (AND) or diamonds (OR). The compartment borders in grey represent the plasma membrane
  and the nuclear membrane, and have been included as visual guides but carry no information.
  At the center, we have the three active forms of the SNF1 complex; SNF1*CYT, SNF1*VAC
  and SNF1*NUC, that are localised to the cytoplasm, the vacuole and the nucleus,
  respectively. Information can only pass along the direction of the edges, and we
  can follow them from inputs to outputs. In this network we have four inputs: The
  three grey stress inputs to the upper right, and extracellular glucose to the upper
  left. The last is part of an unconnected subgraph, highlighting the fact that we
  do not know how the glucose signal is sensed by the pathway. The original NR1 Cytoscape
  file is attached as .'
