  (dashed green). The latent signal may also divert EGFRs en route to the Ap membrane
  via a previously characterized N-glycan-dependent biosynthetic route (red) (). (B)

  between a dileucine motif 658-LL and epithelial cell specific clathrin adaptor AP1B
  in cells with established cell-cell TJ and AJ (solid black and grey boxes) (). Data
  presented in this manuscript indicate AP1B sorts EGFRs in a biosynthetic pathway
  most likely via post-TGN endosome sorting intermediates (solid green). We cannot
