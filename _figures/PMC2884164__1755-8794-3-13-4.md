caption: NRF2-mediated oxidative-stress response pathway that is involved with pituitary
  adenoma protein-mapping data. A gray label denotes an identified protein. The various
  shapes of nodes denote the different functions. A duplicated shape means this node
  contains multiple components. An arrow denotes the pathway direction. A line with
  a small circle denotes a biological result.
