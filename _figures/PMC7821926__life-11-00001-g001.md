caption: 'Schematic representation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway.
  Idopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-involved
  mechanisms are generally involved in UPR induction. Incorrectly folded proteins
  bind to (UPR) sensor proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, resulting
  in activation of the UPR. Protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription
  factor 6 (ATF6), and serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease inositol-requiring
  enzyme (IRE)-1 activate a series of reactions and signaling pathways, which eventually
  leads to transcription initiation and translation regulation of the effector genes.
  These genes include C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) and components of the ER-associated
  degradation (ERAD) system and regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD), which regulate
  apoptosis/autophagy, ER expansion, and protein folding. Abbreviations: eIF2α (eukaryotic
  initiation factor 2 alpha), ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4), XBP-1 (X-box
  binding protein-1), ER chaperone-binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP).'
