caption: Pathways activating JAK/STAT signaling. The JAK–STAT pathway is activated
  by diverse receptors, including those for IL-6 and IL-6 family cytokines, RTKs,
  G-protein-coupled receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), hormone receptors and the
  intracellular kinases, Src and protein kinase C. Activated STAT induces a genetic
  program that promotes various cellular processes that are depicted in the lower
  part of the diagram, including cancer therapy resistance, inflammation, apoptosis,
  cell motility, immunosurveillance, stemness, survival, stress response and cell
  proliferation.
