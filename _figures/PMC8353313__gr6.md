caption: Schematic representation of CE-mediated neuroprotection against STS-induced
  toxicity. STS inhibits protein kinases and induces apoptosis and severe cytotoxicity
  to neurons. CE restores expression of FGF2, maintains the activity of PI3K/Akt,
  Erk1/2 and PKCα/CaM pathway, and promotes cell survival. The PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway plays a role in CE-mediated function, as inhibition of PI3K/Akt by LY294002
  is known to abrogate CE activity. Meanwhile, the cleaved-Casp-3 associated apoptotic
  pathway activated by STS was significantly attenuated by CE. In addition, DNA do
  novo methyltransferase activity may be involved in CE-mediated regulation of gene
  expression and can be inhibited by the Dnmts inhibitor 5-AZ, suggesting that epigenetic
  regulation is involved in CE-mediated neuroprotection processes.
