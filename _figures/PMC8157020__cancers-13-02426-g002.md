caption: 'STAT3 as potential target pathway in nmCRPC. Major types and mechanisms
  of current STAT3 inhibitors: siRNA/ASO, polypeptides, DNA decoys, small molecule
  and/or PROTAC inhibitors. The goal of inhibitors is to decrease levels of STAT3
  mRNA or protein (siRNA/ASO or PROTAC), to inhibit STAT3 nuclear translocation (DNA
  decoys), or the transcriptional activity by interfering with DNA binding (peptides
  or small molecule inhibitors). Major pathways regulating STAT3 signaling in prostate
  epithelial cells are depicted.'
