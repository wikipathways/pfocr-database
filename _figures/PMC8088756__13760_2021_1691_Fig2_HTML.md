caption: Schematic representation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) activation and induction
  of cytokine storm. Two necessary proteins to activate these receptors are the cluster
  of differentiation 14 (CD14) and myeloid differential protein-2 (MD-2), triggering
  2 internal signaling pathways, including the MyD88-dependent and the MyD88-independent
  pathways, which is known as TRIF-dependent signaling pathway. TLRs trigger the internal
  signaling pathways to activate some transcription factors responsible for the generation
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like nuclear factor-kβ (NF- kβ), as well as interferon
  regulatory factors (IRF) that mediate the type I interferon (IFNs)-dependent antiviral
  response
