caption: Effect of mechanical strain on tenocyte. IL-1β is expressed in response to
  mechanical overload. It exerts its effects in an autocrine and paracrine fashion
  to increase its own expression from tenocytes. It triggers different signaling pathways
  leading to both inflammation and subsequent repair. By binding to its receptor,
  IL-1β activates the PC/PKC-PLC pathway that induces NF-κB to translocate to the
  nucleus and increase CCL2 gene expression. CCL2 recruits monocytes to loading site
  and activates resident macrophages initiating an inflammatory response.
