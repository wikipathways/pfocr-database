caption: Schematic diagram showing the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathway. Without Wnt
  ligands, β‐catenin is degraded by a destruction complex composed of axin, APC, and
  GSK‐3β, preventing nuclear entry and gene transcription. When Wnt binds to the frizzled
  receptor and co‐receptor LRP5/6, the destruction complex is inhibited, allowing
  β‐catenin to accumulate, translocate to the nucleus, and activate Wnt target genes
  through interaction with TCF/LEF. These genes regulate essential processes such
  as cell proliferation and neuronal development. Dysregulation of this pathway is
  linked to diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli;
  GSK‐3β, glycogen synthase kinase‐3β; LRP5/6, low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐related
  protein 5/6; TCF/LEF, T‐cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor; Wnt, wingless‐related
  integration site. Biorender.com program
