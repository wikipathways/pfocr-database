caption: Ethanol metabolism pathway. Ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde through
  the cytosolic enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), the microsomal enzyme cytochrome
  P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and the peroxisomal enzyme catalase. The ADH enzyme reaction is
  the main ethanol metabolic pathway involving an intermediate carrier of electrons,
  namely nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which is reduced by two electrons
  to form NADH. Acetaldehyde is metabolized mainly by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2)
  in the mitochondria to acetate and NADH before being cleared into the systemic circulation.
