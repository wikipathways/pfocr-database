caption: Therapeutic peptides for lung diseases. The peptides Liraglutide, Ghrelin,
  ANP, Ac2-26, LL-37, FF/CAP18, VIP, PIPS, AcF, FeG, CNP, and BNP inhibit acute lung
  injury by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway and suppress the activities of
  C5aR and ROS during the progression of inflammation. The peptides PAP, CGEN25009,
  Liraglutide, ANP, CNP, M10, Ac-SDKP, DR8, FGD21, and Oral E4 play antagonizing roles
  against the NF-κB signaling pathway, TGF-β signaling pathway, oxidative stress,
  the vitality of REXFP1/LGR7 receptor and the remodeling of extracellular matrix
  component in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, the peptides CPP33-HADP,
  HADP, LVTX-8, Cecropin B1a, Kla-TAT+HPRP-A1, Mushroom peptide, SAH-EJ2, CSIO, SFP,
  R1-P2, and MANS suppress the development of lung cancer by inhibiting the invasion,
  proliferation, and promoting apoptosis of lung cancer cells
