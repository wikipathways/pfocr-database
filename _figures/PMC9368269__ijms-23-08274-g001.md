caption: The enzymatic pathways of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) synthesis and catabolism.
  The production of LPC is the result of the fragmentation of the sn-2 residues of
  phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolyzed by PLA2. Three catabolism pathways of LPC are
  listed. LPC catabolism occurs through a disproportionation reaction involving two
  LPC molecules catalyzed by cytosolic lysophospholipase-transacylase (LPTA) to form
  PC and glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC). A hydrolytic pathway is catalyzed by autotaxin
  (ATX) to yield lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and choline, and a reacylation pathway
  to form PC is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT).
