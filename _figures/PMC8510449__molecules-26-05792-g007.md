caption: Pathways of elemene reversing drug resistance through regulation of the cell
  cycle pathway. β-Elemene blocks the G2–M cell cycle by regulating the cell cycle
  G2 checkpoint. Cyclin B1 and Cdc2, the cell cycle G2 checkpoints, are inactivated
  by an increase in Wee1 kinase phosphorylation, decreased Cdc25C dephosphorylation,
  and increased Cdc2 and Cdc25C phosphorylation. The symble ↑ indicates upregulated
  expression. The symble ↓ indicates downregulated expression.
