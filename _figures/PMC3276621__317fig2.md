  Phospholipids and TAG share DAG and PA as common precursors. In the de novo synthesis
  of phospholipids, PA serves as the immediate precursor of CDP-DAG, precursor to
  PI, PG, and PS. PS is decarboxylated to form PE, which undergoes three sequential
  methylations resulting in PC. PA also serves as a precursor for PGP, PG, and ultimately
  CL, which undergoes acyl-chain remodeling to the mature lipid. Alternatively, PA
  is dephosphorylated, producing DAG, which serves as the precursor of PE and PC in
  the Kennedy pathway. DAG also serves as the precursor for TAG and can be phosphorylated,
  regenerating PA. The names of the enzymes that are discussed in detail in this YeastBook
  chapter are shown adjacent to the arrows of the metabolic conversions in which they
  are involved and the gene–enzyme relationships are shown in –. Lipids and intermediates
  are boxed, with the most abundant lipid classes boxed in boldface type. Enzyme names
  are indicated in boldface type. The abbreviations used are: TAG, triacylglycerols;
  PI, phosphatidylinositol; PA, phosphatidic acid; CDP-DAG, CDP-diacylglycerol; DAG,
  diacylglycerol; MAG, monoacylglycerol; Gro, glycerol; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate,
  PS, phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol;
  PGP phosphatidylglycerol phosphate; CL* precursor cardiolipin; MLCL, monolyso-cardiolipin;
  CL, mature cardiolipin; PMME, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine; PDME, phosphatidyl-dimethylethanolamine;
  PC, phosphatidylcholine; FFA, free fatty acids; Cho, choline, Etn, ethanolamine,
  Ins, inositol; Cho-P, choline phosphate; CDP-Cho, CDP-choline; Etn-P, ethanolamine
  phosphate; CDP-Etn, CDP-ethanolamine; PI 3-P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate;
  PI 4-P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PI 4,5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate;
  PI 3,5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate. Nucl, nucleus; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; Mito, mitochondria; LD, lipid droplets; G/E/V, Golgi, endosomes, vacuole;
  Pex, peroxisomes; Cyt, cytoplasma; PM, plasma membrane. CL* indicates a precursor
  of cardiolipin (CL) with saturated acyl-chain that undergoes deacylation/reacylation
  to mature CL. See text for details.'
