caption: Synthesis of tryptophan from chorismate. After the seven-step pathway via
  shikimate generates chorismate, the biosynthesis of tryptophan diverges from those
  of the other two AAA. 5-PRPP = 5-Phosphoribose-1-diphosphate; APR synthase = Anthranilate
  phosphoribosyl synthase; PRA isomerase = Phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase;
  1-(2-Carboxyphenylamino)-1-d. r.−5- phosphate = 1-(2-Carboxyphenylamino)-1-dexoyribulose-5-
  phosphate, IGP synthase = indole glycerol-4-phosphate. Tryptophan synthase A (or
  α-subunit) cleaves indole glycerol-3-phosphate into indole and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate,
  while tryptophan synthase B (or β-subunit) is responsible for the PLP-dependent
  condensation of the latter two compounds into tryptophan.
