caption: a | MicroRNAs are important regulators of effector T cell differentiation,
  including T cell activation, acquisition of effector functions such as cytokine
  production, and T cell proliferation (top panel). Genetic ablation of key molecules
  of the miRNA biogenesis pathway in CD4+ T cells underlines the importance of miRNAs
  for these processes (lower panel). Activation of microRNA-deficient CD4+ T cells
  results in increased and aberrant cytokine production, reduced cell proliferation.
  b | Mechanistic overview illustrating miRNA participation in regulatory networks
  that control T cell activation, expansion, and effector cell differentiation. Note
  that specific miRNAs are both regulated targets and upstream regulators of signaling
  pathways that govern T cell behavior. Selected miRNA target genes are indicated.
  TEFF, effector T cell; Tnaive, naïve T cell.
