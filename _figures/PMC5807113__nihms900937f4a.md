caption: 'Model for the PAP-mediated regulation of PSS expression and lipid synthesis
  during growth. The diagram shows the Henry regulatory circuit that includes the
  repressor Opi1, the Ino2-Ino4 activator complex, and the UASINO element in CHO1
  (), and the bifurcation of phosphatidate for the synthesis of triacylglycerol and
  phospholipids via the CDP-diacylglycerol pathway. Under growth conditions (e.g.,
  exponential phase, left) whereby Pah1 expression (green highlight) and PAP activity
  are low (), the level of phosphatidate is elevated and the Opi1 repressor is tethered
  to the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane via its interactions with phosphatidate
  and Scs2. This allows for the transcriptional activation (bold arrow) of CHO1 by
  the Ino2-Ino4 complex and the inductions of Cho1 (pink highlight) and PSS activity
  for increased phospholipid synthesis (large letters) via the CDP-diacylglycerol
  pathway. The reduced rate of triacylglycerol synthesis in the exponential phase
  of growth () is indicated with small grey letters. Under growth conditions (e.g.,
  stationary phase, right) whereby Pah1 expression (pink highlight) and PAP activity
  are high (), the synthesis of triacylglycerol is elevated (large letters) and the
  phosphatidate level is reduced (small grey letters). This allows for the dissociation
  of Opi1 from the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane and its entry into the nucleus
  where it represses the transcriptional activation of CHO1 (thin grey arrow and letters)
  by inhibiting the function of the Ino2-Ino4 activator complex through its binding
  to Ino2. The repression of Cho1 (green highlight) and PSS activity results in the
  reduction of phospholipid synthesis (small grey letters). Abbreviations: PA, phosphatidate;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; TAG, triacylglycerol; CDP-DAG, CDP-diacylglycerol; PS, phosphatidylserine;
