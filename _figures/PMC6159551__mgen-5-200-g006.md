caption: Maps of transcriptionally altered metabolic pathways in encysted compared
  with vegetative A. brasilense. Maps were redrawn based on the KEGG metabolic pathway
  to highlight metabolic pathways significantly regulated in cysts. Thick purple arrows
  indicate processes transcriptionally upregulated in a cysts vs. vegetative cells
  and thick yellow arrows indicate processes transcriptionally downregulated. Thin
  black arrows denote processes not significantly different between cysts and vegetative
  cells. (a) Pyruvate metabolism. (b) Butanoate metabolism, focusing on poly-hydroxybutanoate
  (PHB) synthesis.
