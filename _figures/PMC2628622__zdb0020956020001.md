caption: Jak/Stat canonical pathway in human diabetic nephropathy as assessed by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis software. The Jak/Stat family members represented include Jak-1,
  -2, and -3 and Stat-1, -2, -3, -4, -5A, -5B, and -6. The mRNA expression changes
  for Jak/Stat family members in early (PIMA Indians, n = 22–24) (left panel) and
  progressive (European, n = 7–11) (right panel) human diabetic nephropathy (DN) are
  indicated in red for increased expression and green for decreased expression, compared
  with the corresponding control group (LD + MCD, n = 7–12). 2000–2008 Ingenuity Systems.
