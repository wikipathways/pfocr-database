caption: 'Genome-wide microarray analysis was done on tumors from juvenile hosts (n=15)
  or adult hosts (n=12). SAM-tandem-bootstrapping was done to identify 243 genes that
  were modulated by at least 1.5-fold in tumors from pubertal hosts compared to adult
  hosts. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed two main biological processes with the
  243-gene profile: embryonic development, organ development and organ morphology
  (A, IPA score 43); and cellular growth and proliferation, cancer, and tumor morphology
  (B, IPA score 38). (C) The 243 JvA gene profile represented canonical mammary luminal
  genes, including Foxa1, Krt18, and Areg. Tumors arising from transplants in juvenile
  hosts or adult hosts were immunostained with the pY1161-IGFR antibody. (D) Cell
  membranes were weakly positive for pY1161-IGFR near the edge of AH tumors(Bar, 60
  µm). (E) Cell membranes were strongly positive for pY1161-IGFR near the edge of
  JH tumors (Bar, 60 µm). (F) pY1161-IGFR staining was semi-quantitatively assessed
  as the percent of a tumor that exhibited positive staining. JH tumors exhibited
  a 25-fold increase in cells positive for phosphorylated-IGFR (Mann-Whitney test,
  p=0.026).'
