caption: Schematic diagrams showing the basic components of the signal-transduction
  pathways for actin assembly, and showing the phosphorylation cycle for the shuttling
  of actin monomers by Hsp27 to regions of new actin assembly. (A) The signal-transduction
  pathways that allow FMLP receptor binding to activate the uncapping of actin filaments,
  Arp2/3 nucleation and the release of actin monomers by Hsp27. The first two pathways
  on the left-hand side have been emphasized. All three pathways are initiated by
  the heterotrimeric G-protein complex linked to the FMLP receptor. The far left pathway
  involves phosphoinositide kinases that generate PtdIns (4,5) and PtdIns (3,4,5)
  that inactivate the barbed end capping proteins gelsolin and CapZ, resulting in
  free barbed ends. The middle pathway is less well understood, but results in the
  activation of the GTPase Cdc 42, which in turn activates N-WASP, which binds to
  and activates Arp2/3 to nucleate the formation of new actin filaments. The far right
  pathway involves the activation of MAP kinase kinase kinases (MKKKs) to phosphorylate
  MAP kinase kinases including MAP kinase kinases 3 and 6 (MEK 3/6). These proteins
  then phosphorylate p38 MAP kinase that phosphorylates and activates MAPKAP kinase
  2/3 to phosphorylate Hsp27 causing the release of sequestered actin monomers. LT
  cleaves the amino-terminus of MEK 3/6, preventing downstream phosphorylation of
  Hsp27. (B) Model of how Hsp27 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation could serve
  to shuttle actin monomers to sites of new actin filament assembly. LT blocks MEK
  3/6 function and prevents Hsp27 phosphorylation. See text for details.
