caption: 'Scheme: putative mechanisms of interaction between H1- or H2-histamine receptors
  and other GTP-binding protein-coupled heptahelical receptors in the sarcolemma of
  a cardiomyocyte. As delineated in , H2-histamine receptors after stimulation by
  endogenous histamine or by the exogenous H2-histamine receptor selective agonists
  like dimaprit will elevate via stimulatory GTP-binding proteins (Gs) the activity
  of sarcolemmal adenylyl cyclases (AC). Thus, more cAMP is formed and cAMP-dependent
  protein kinases (PKA) are activated. This leads to a subsequent phosphorylation
  and activation of cardiac regulatory proteins (RP). Their phosphorylation (compare  for
  details) leads to an increase in force of contraction. The same pathway is used
  by the cardiac 5-HT4-serotonin receptor stimulated by endogenous serotonin or the
  β-adrenoceptors (β-AR) stimulated by exogenous isoproterenol to increase cAMP and
  thereafter force of contraction. The increase of force of contraction induced by
  histamine by acting on H2-histamine receptors is abrogated by additionally acting
  endogenous compounds like adenosine acting on A1-adenosine receptors or endogenous
  acetylcholine (or exogenous carbachol) stimulating M2-muscarinic receptors. Three
  pathways may be used by M2-muscarinic receptors and A1-adenosine receptors. They
  may inhibit via inhibitory G-proteins (Gi/oα) the activity of AC, thereby reduce
  cAMP content and thus decrease force of contraction. In addition, A1-adenosine and
  M2-muscarinic receptors can activate sarcolemmal potassium ion channels: this shortens
  the duration of the action potential; less time is available for trigger Ca2+ to
  enter the cell via L-type Ca2+ channels (see ), cytosolic Ca2+ declines and force
  falls. Lastly, M2-muscarinic and A1-adenosine receptors may directly or indirectly
  activate protein phosphatases (PP, see ) which would reduce the phosphorylation
  state and subsequently the force in the myocardium. Moreover, as shown in , H1-histamine
  receptors, may activate phospholipase A2 (PLA2), thereby activating cyclooxygenase
  2 (COX2) which generates metabolites of arachidonic acid which can elevate force
  of contraction. Finally, there seems to be a direct interaction whereby the H2-receptor
  stimulation can reduce the activity of the H1-histamine receptor.'
