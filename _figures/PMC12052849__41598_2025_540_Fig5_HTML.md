caption: A proposed working model of apoptosis regulated by USP18 through the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4
  signaling pathway. USP18 inhibits the expression of CHOP, a marker gene of ER stress,
  by regulating the PERK-eIF2α-ATF signaling pathway, which relieves the inhibition
  of downstream anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, thereby inhibiting cell apoptosis. USP18
  can also directly affect apoptosis by regulating the classical mitochondrial-mediated
  apoptosis pathway. Solid arrows indicate promotion, and dashed arrows indicate inhibitory
  effects
