caption: As discussed in the main text, BDNF signaling via TrkB vs. p75NTR is complex
  but elegant, allowing for a diversity of signaling mechanisms and cellular effects
  that are cell type- and context-dependent. Activation of the full-length TrkB by
  mature BDNF classically results in activation of PLCγ with downstream effects on
  [Ca2+]i via the IP3 pathway that can enhance contractility, the ERK pathway and
  the PI3K/Akt pathway that can both promote cell proliferation and survival. In addition
  TrkB can work through the NFκB pathway. In contrast to TrkB-FL, the truncated TrkB-T1
  can be both inhibitory (red; by dimerizing with TrkB-FL or chelating BDNF) and activating
  via RhoA and PKC, leading to cytoskeletal remodeling, gene regulation and other
  effects. The low-affinity p75NTR, when activated by mature BDNF is typically activating
  to pathways that TrkB-FL works through, but importantly can be inhibitory via the
  JNK or Akt pathways. This is particularly the case when p75NTR is activated by pro-BDNF
  and forms a ternary complex with the adaptor protein sortilin.
