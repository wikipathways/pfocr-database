caption: The expression profile of important regulatory genes and the accumulation
  patterns of sugars in the glycolytic pathway during four important developmental
  periods. In the color scale, each cube metabolized the average of three replicates
  in the same period. The metabolite data were standardized by the logarithm of 10,
  and the gene was the logarithm of 2; red or orange represents a higher relative
  content, but blue or green represents a lower relative content, from left to right
  represents the average relative content of metabolites at 10, 18, 26, and 34 DAP,
  respectively. The red triangle represents that the enriched genes in class 4 and
  class 5 are in the K-means clustering analysis, showing a tendency of up-regulation.
