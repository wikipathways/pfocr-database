caption: Schematic representation of paraquat-mediated innate immune responses in
  a Drosophila PD model. Short-term PQ exposure regulates genes involved in the Drosophila
  innate immunity. PQ activates full-length Relish p110 by proteolytic cleavage and
  induces nuclear translocation of Relish p68. In the dopaminergic neurons, PQ-induced
  Relish activation leads to poor survival, mobility defects and loss of specific
  dopaminergic neuron clusters. PQ-mediated toxicity involves components of the IMD
  pathway, the adapter protein, IMD and the downstream caspase, DREDD. PQ inhibits
  Relish-dependent induction of AMPs through activation of pirk, a negative regulator
  of the IMD pathway. PQ-mediated suppression of AMPs disrupts the innate immune response
  thereby increasing susceptibility to Gram-negative bacterial infections. On the
  other hand, PQ might also directly activate other unknown factors which might interact
  with either Relish, DREDD and/or Pirk and lead to suppression of AMPs. Dotted lines
  represent hypothetical pathways regulating immune responses downstream of PQ.
