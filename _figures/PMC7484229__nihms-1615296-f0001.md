caption: Possible mechanisms of action of ketamine. Mechanistically, acute blockade
  of NMDA receptors by ketamine causes an activation of AMPA receptors, which then
  modulates downstream signaling systems in the limbic system to mediate antidepressant
  effects. The downstream actions of AMPA receptors activation leads to increase in
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and activation of its receptor tropomyosin
  receptor kinase B (TrkB). In addition, AMPA receptors stimulate mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, deactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3),
  and inhibition of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase phosphorylation.
