caption: Mechanism of action of PRMT3 and CARM1 in different cancer. The mechanisms
  of action of PRMT3 and CARM1 in various cancers mainly involve arginine methylation,
  protein–protein interactions, signalling pathway regulation, and glycolysis regulation.
  Abnormalities in these mechanisms may lead to malignant biological behaviours such
  as proliferation, survival, and metastasis of cancer cells. In breast cancer, PRMT3
  is involved in regulating H4R3me2a modification, thereby modulating the endoplasmic
  reticulum stress signalling pathway and promoting the proliferation and migration
  of cancer cells. In liver cancer, PRMT3 mediates the arginine methylation of IGF2BP1,
  increasing resistance to oxaliplatin. In pancreatic cancer, PRMT3 catalyses the
  methylation of hnRNPA1, increasing the expression of ABCG2 and thus enhancing chemotherapy
  resistance. Meanwhile, CARM1 catalyses the arginine methylation of MDH1R248, regulating
  the glutamine metabolism and redox balance of pancreatic cancer cells. In breast
  cancer, CARM1 interacts with BAF155 to drive tumour progression and metastasis.
  On the other hand, CARM1 activates the AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, promoting the
  progression of liver cancer. Additionally, in glioblastoma (GBM), PRMT3 enhances
  the expression and activity of HIF1A, thereby promoting glycolysis and exerting
  carcinogenic effects
