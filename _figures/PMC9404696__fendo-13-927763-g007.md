caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism by which ANGPTL8 induces
  ectopic lipid deposition by promoting adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal
  stem cells. The elevated fatty acid levels upon long-term exposure to an HFD upregulate
  liver ANGPTL8. ANGPTL8, in turn, secreted by the liver into the blood, acts on MSC
  cells in various organs. Secreted ANGPTL8 upregulates the expression of PPARγ and
  c/EBPα by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and promotes the adipogenic
  differentiation of MSCs, resulting in lipid deposition in multiple organs and causing
  obesity in male mice. Estrogen can inhibit the expression of ANGPTL8 to counteract
  the effect of ANPTL8 KO on obesity in female mice.
