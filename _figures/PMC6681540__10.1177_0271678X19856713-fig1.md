caption: Schematics of the proposed glucose phosphates-mediated allosteric signaling
  pathway associated with astrocytic glycogenolysis. Glycogen degradation in astrocytes
  can be triggered by (i) adenylate kinase (AK)-mediated production of AMP after ATP
  hydrolysis by Na+/K+-activated adenosine triphosphatase (NKA) and/or (ii) monoamine-initiated
  G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)-mediated second-messenger signaling cascades,
  either the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway or the phospholipase C (PLC)/Ca2+pathway
  (for a detailed description, see DiNuzzo et al.). Since glycogenolysis is faster
  than uptake and phosphorylation of glucose, the intracellular concentration of Glc-1-P
  increases. Glc-1-P enhances active K+ uptake by NKA. Glc-1-P is isomerized by phoshoglucomutase
  (PGM) to Glc-6-P and also converted to Glc-1,6-P2 by Glc-1,6-P2 synthase (not shown).
  Glc-6-P inhibits glucose phosphorylation by hexokinase (HK). Besides being a cofactor
  in the PGM-catalyzed reaction, Glc-1,6-P2 further inhibits HK and stimulates phosphofructokinase
  (PFK), thereby favoring glycolytic processing of glycogen-derived Glc-6-P and mitochondrial
  metabolism of downstream pyruvate (not shown) as well as oxidative phosphorylation.
  The decrease in substrate flow through HK entails a reduction of extracellular glucose
  uptake by astrocytes and glucose-sparing for neuronal utilization (dashed arrow).
  Overall, the effects of glycogenolysis are net changes in astrocytic uptake of potassium
  (increased) and glucose (decreased).
