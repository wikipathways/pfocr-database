caption: Pathways impinging specifically on glucose-mediated F-actin remodeling in
  the β cell. The β cell responds to certain insulin secretagogues by remodeling its
  cortical filamentous actin (F-actin). Glucose metabolism can signal to Cdc42, at
  least partially though β-Pix, to activate p21-activated kinase (PAK1) and evoke
  Rac1 activation. Under basal conditions, Cdc42 and Rac1 are held inactive by guanine
  nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) proteins Caveolin-1 and RhoGDI. In addition,
  GLP-1 activation of GLP-1R can lead to increased cAMP and PKA activation which can
  activate SAD-A kinase and feed into the PAK1 pathway. Active PAK1 signals to multiple
  effectors, such as Rac1, to facilitate F-actin remodeling. PAK1 is important for
  Raf/MEK activation, leading to ERK activation. PAK1 (and possibly ERK as well) may
  then signal to myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK)-myosin IIA (MyoIIA) to further mediate
  F-actin remodeling. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) participates in cross-talk with
  ERK, which may indirectly modulate cortical F-actin remodeling. The F-actin binding
  and severing protein Gelsolin complexes directly with the t-SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide
  sensitive factor attachment receptor) protein Syntaxin 4, ultimately impacting SNARE-mediated
  insulin exocytosis. Syntaxin 4 in particular is essential for second-phase insulin
  release, complexing with the other t-SNARE protein synaptosomal-associated protein
  of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) (or SNAP-23) and the incoming granule vesicle-SNARE, VAMP2.
