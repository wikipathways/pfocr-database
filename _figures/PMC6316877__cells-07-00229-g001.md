caption: 'Major pathways and metabolite exchange that take place in the mitochondria.
  1: Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis connects to the mitochondria by phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP), pyruvate and lactate. 2: Fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidation utilize citrate
  and acetyl-CoA as metabolic intermediates. 3: Glutathione (GSH) is produced in the
  mitochondria from glutamate, which maintains cellular redox balance. 4: Protein
  biosynthesis uses de novo synthesized amino acids from the mitochondria. 5 Neurotransmitter
  biosynthesis (proline and GABA) partially takes place in the mitochondria then continues
  in the cytosol. 6: Electron Transport Chain subunits I-V make up the Oxidative Phosphorylation
  pathway and are located on the inner mitochondrial membrane and use reducing equivalents,
  NADH and FADH2, as electron sources. Electrons move through the subunits from I
  or II to IV, which creates a proton gradient in the process. The proton gradient
  is used by subunit V to generate ATP. 7: Fumarate and succinate are exported to
  the cytosol as enzyme co-factors. 8: 1-carbon metabolism supplies carbon for purine
  nucleotide biosynthesis and methylation of proteins and DNA. 9: Aspartate (Asp)
  supports pyrimidine ring biosynthesis. →: Canonical oxidative pathway. →: Anaplerotic
  pathway. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH); pyruvate carboxylase (PCB); phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase (PEPCK); malic enzyme (ME); gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).'
