caption: A model illustrating cell wall architecture and antifungal agents targeting
  specific components of the cell wall (A). Several antifungal agents are available
  that target the cell wall, but only the echinocandins have been licenced for the
  treatment of fungal infections; research into β-1,6-glucan inhibitor has been relatively
  unsuccessful. Cell wall integrity pathway leading to caspofungin drug tolerance
  (B). The Pkc pathway is activated in response to damage to the cell wall caused
  by inhibition of β-1,3-glucan synthesis by echinocandins. The signal that cell wall
  is weakened is transduced by membrane-bound mechanosensors such as members of the
  Wsc family, to activate Rho1. Rho1 activates Pkc1 which in turn activates the downstream
  MAP kinase cascade leading to the phosphorylation of Mkc1. A number of transcription
  factors are then activated including Cas5 and Rlm1 that switch on the expression
  of genes involved in cell wall construction and remodelling. The calcium signalling
  pathway is involved in cell wall salvage response. The pathway is activated by Ca2+
  that enters the cell through membrane-localised channels or is released from intracellular
  stores. Ca2+ binds to and activates calmodulin (Cmd1). Cmd1 activates the phosphatase
  calcineurin, which is made up of 2 subunits Cna1 and Cnb1. Calcineurin dephosphorylates
  the transcription factor Crz1. Crz1 then moves into the nucleus and induces the
  expression of genes through binding to CDREs within their promoter sequences. The
  calcium signalling pathway regulates CHS genes. CDREs, calcium-dependent response
  elements; CWPGs, cell wall protein genes; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol.
