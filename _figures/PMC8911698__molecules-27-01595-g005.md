caption: Schematic mechanism of plant sterols regulating insulin signalling and inflammation.
  The mechanism of action of phytosterol is illustrated in the figure based on the
  literature available. As phytosterol is a potent antidiabetic, it enhances insulin
  signalling molecules, such as IR, IRS 1/2, PI3K, Akt, and AS160, which promotes
  GLUT4 synthesis and glucose absorption. There is still a lack of research on the
  effects of phytosterols on the GLUT4 translocation pathway (denoted as ?). Phytosterol
  also suppresses inflammatory events by inhibiting the IKK/NF-kB and c-Jun-N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) signalling pathways. Plant sterol-facilitated activation is indicated
  by a green plus symbol. The red circle denotes phytosterol’s inhibitory effect on
  bothinsulin signalling and inflammation.
