caption: Targeting adenosine signaling pathways for cancer therapy. Many antibodies
  have been developed to block CD39/CD73 activity and suppress the production of adenosine.
  Some chemical antagonists have been developed to inhibit adenosine signaling in
  immune and tumor cells to block CD39/CD73 enzyme activity. Many inhibitors have
  been developed to counteract adenosine signaling in immune cells via A2AR/A2BR.
  Targeting the adenosine signaling pathway in the TME alleviates the immunosuppressive
  microenvironment and unleashes the anti-tumor potential of immune cells. ATP, adenosine
  triphosphate
