caption: Bidirectional regulation of the cGAS-STING pathway and immune cells in the
  tumor immunosuppression microenvironment (A) The cGAS-STING pathway inhibits M2
  macrophage polarization and promotes anti-tumor immunity. The STING agonist, PMXAA,
  promotes DC overexpression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86, thereby reprogramming
  immunosuppressive M2 macrophages into immune-activating subtype M1 macrophages.
  Meanwhile, STING agonists, DMXAA and 2’3’-cGAMP, can reprogram M2 macrophages into
  M1 macrophages in vitro. Additionally, STING activates IRG1, promotes TFEB nuclear
  translocation, inhibits M2 macrophage polarity, and reduces immunosuppression. (B)
  The cGAS-STING pathway promotes M2 macrophage polarization and immunosuppression.
  Radiation-exposed tumor cells can produce broken DNA, activate the cGAS-STING pathway,
  promote IL-34 secretion, and promote M2 macrophage polarization and recruitment,
  thereby promoting tumor cell survival. Simultaneously, tumor cells can release degraded
  DNA into the TME for macrophage uptake. Macrophage uptake activates the cGAS/STING/TBK1/STAT6
  signaling pathway, inducing the generation of M2 macrophages and promoting apoptosis
  of M1 macrophages. (C) Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway induces inactivation
  of MDSCs, reducing their immunosuppressive function. The c-di-GMP activates the
  cGAS-STING pathway in MDSC, converting immunosuppressed MDSC subpopulations into
  an IL-12-producing immunostimulatory phenotype that enhances the CD8+ T cell-mediated
  immune response. Additionally, STING signaling activates SOCS1 protein, physically
  interacting with STAT3, preventing its phosphorylation and dimerization, and reducing
  the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs by inhibiting the production of GM-CSF and
  IL-6. (D) Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway also promotes the recruitment of
  MDSCs, thereby exerting their immunosuppressive function. After irradiation, tumor
  cells activate the STING/IFN-I pathway and release the chemokines CCL2, CCL7, and
  CCL12 via the CCR2 pathway to recruit MDSCs. The recruited MDSCs reduce the immune
  response of T cells and exert immunosuppressive functions. (E) Activation of cGAS-STING
  attenuates Treg-mediated immunosuppression. In Tregs, activation of STING decreased
  GATA3/NOS2 expression, which is associated with immunosuppression, increased CD4+
  T cell infiltration, and reduced immunosuppression. (F) Activation of the cGAS-STING
  pathway promoted Treg cell-mediated immunosuppression. Tumor-derived exosomes activate
  the cGAS-STING pathway in initial lymphocytes, activate Foxp3, STAT5, and SMAD3,
  and promote the conversion of initial CD4+ T cells into Treg cells, thereby mediating
  immunosuppression
