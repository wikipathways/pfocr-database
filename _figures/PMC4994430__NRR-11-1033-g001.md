caption: 'Sealing pathway schematic for multiple proteins and pathways involved in
  vesicle mediated repair of plasmalemmal damageSee text for references. Ca2+ influx
  at a site of plasmalemmal damage activates Ca2+ binding proteins, many of which
  increase vesicular traffic. The P2X7 protein, activated by ATP, also increases intracellular
  Ca2+. To date, three parallel sealing pathways have been identified that involve
  1) oxidation, 2) calpains, and 3) cAMP (whose levels are mediated by Ca2+ activated
  adenylate cyclases). (1) The oxidation pathway activates vesicle formation, synaptic
  membrane fusion proteins (labeled in yellow), and Tri-partite motif proteins (TRIM
  proteins). (2) Calpains cleave cytoskeletal elements to free vesicles bound to the
  cytoskeleton, phospholipase C (PLC) and regulatory subunits of PKC isomers. PLC
  activation, in turn, cleaves the membrane lipid PIP2 into second messengers IP3
  and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG binding to regulatory subunits activates some PKC
  isomers. Ca2+ and DAG activate additional PKC isomers and the membrane fusion protein
  MUNC-13. (Note: not all PKC isomers are implicated in plasmalemmal sealing). PKC
  phosphorylates various isomers of synaptic membrane fusion proteins, and the membrane
  bound protein MARCKS. MARCKS increases DAG production, thereby enhancing PKC activity.
  (3) cAMP activates PKA and Epac. PKA directly phosphorylates SNARE proteins, such
  as SNAP-25 (inhibited by Botulinum toxin (BonT) A/E), synaptotagmin (inhibited by
  BonT B/TeNT), and syntaxin (inhibited by BonT E). PKA likely does not activate isomers
  of SNARE proteins required for Golgi membrane fusion (labeled in green) and ESCRT
  proteins that are inhibited by the fungal toxin Brefeldin A. In contrast, Epac (the
  guanine exchange factor) activates SNARE proteins in both the Golgi and synaptic
  membrane fusion pathways that converge at N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF:
  labeled in blue). Finally, both lipid rafts and PEG produce membrane fusion, bypassing
  NSF.'
