caption: 'Application of MAPK, PI3K, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in the pathogenesis
  of obesity. Photo Note: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a key mediator
  of signal transduction in mammalian cells. The MAPK signaling pathway consists of
  a three-layer kinase cascade consisting of MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKK), MAPK kinases
  (MAPKKs), and MAPK. ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, ERK5, and other MAPKs play a complex role
  in appetite regulation, lipogenesis, and glucose homeostasis [25]. JNK and p38 have
  similar functions and are related to inflammation, apoptosis, and growth. ERK mainly
  involves tube cell growth and differentiation, and its upstream signal is the well-known
  Ras/Raf protein, ERK5, and ERK1/2 pathways, which are similar. MAPK signaling pathway
  plays different roles in adipose tissue browning and thermogenesis. Note: ↑ indicates
  an increase in content, and ↓ indicates a decrease in content. “?” Indicates that
  the research is uncertain'
