caption: 'SASP regulation of aging intervertebral disc cells converges on the p53/p21
  and p16/Rb pathways. NF-κB: NF-κB is a major factor regulating the transcription
  of many SASP-related components. ATM autophosphorylates and promotes phosphorylation,
  SUMOylation, and monoubiquitination of NEMO. As a result, monoubiquitinated NEMO
  translocates to the cytoplasm together with ATM, activating the IKK complex. Phosphorylation
  of IκB leads to the release of p65, which is then transferred to the nucleus and
  upregulates the transcriptional program of SASP factors. AMPK: Mitochondria-derived
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) replenish DNA damage foci and DDR signaling after
  initial senescence. and mediates changes in metabolic status low NAD+/NADH and increases
  in AMP: ATP ratios. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated by high AMP
  and ADP levels and can affect SASP by activating p53 and stabilizing p21 mRNA. cGAS/STING:
  After cytoplasmic chromatin fragments and mitochondrial DNA are damaged, they are
  released into the cytoplasm and then activate the cGAS/STING signaling pathway to
  produce the second messenger cGAMP. STING dimerizes and is excreted from the endoplasmic
  reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. It then binds to TBK1 to form a complex. TBK1
  then phosphorylates IRF3 and IκB kinase in parallel. IKK phosphorylates inhibitor
  of NFκB (IκB), resulting in the release of NFκB. mTOR: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/AKT activates class I PI3K. This process generates PIP3 and leads to PKB/Akt
  activation. Active PKB/Akt activates mTOR indirectly by inhibiting its negative
  regulator [tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2)]. Activated mTORC1 enhances p53 function'
