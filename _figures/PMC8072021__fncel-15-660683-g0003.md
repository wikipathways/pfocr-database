caption: Loss of PrPC control of β1 integrin–ROCK signaling upon prion infection alters
  neuronal polarity, renders neurons highly sensitive to TNFα, and promotes PrPSc
  and Aβ accumulation. (A) In prion-infected neurons, PrPSc provokes a loss of PrPC
  negative regulatory role on β1 integrin/ROCK signaling. Overactivated ROCKs (i)
  affect the neuronal polarity and connectivity via the LIMK/cofilin/actin pathway,
  (ii) favor plasma membrane TNFR accumulation, and (iii) amplify the production of
  PrPSc and Aβ via PDK1 overactivation and TACE internalization. (B) In the brain,
  prion-infected glial cells release neurotoxic factors such as TNFα that would precipitate
  the death of prion-infected neurons primed by the ROCK-dependent accumulation of
  TNFR1 at the plasma membrane. The ROCK-dependent rise of PrPSc and Aβ peptides would
  self-sustain the toxic dialog between microglial cells and neurons (microglial reaction).
