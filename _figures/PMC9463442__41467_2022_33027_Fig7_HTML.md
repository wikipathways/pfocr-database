caption: Transcriptionally active RNAPII is more prominent in S-G2 cell cycle phases
  (showed in Fig.) when HR is known to repair DSBs. RNAPII recruitment to DSBs, that
  involves the pre-initiation complex (PIC), favors nascent RNA transcription, leading
  to generation of small RNA:DNA hybrid structures that cause RNAPII pausing (showed
  in Figs., ). RAD52 and XPG are capable of rescuing the transiently paused RNAPII
  activity (8), allowing for 5’DNA strand displacement. Experimental inhibition of
  transcription impairs recruitment of the DNA resection factors CtIP, MRE11 and BRCA1
  (showed in Figs., ) to DSBs. MRE11 initiates 5’strand degradation, while the CtIP-BRCA1
  axis is essential to regulate the speed of resection by controlling transcription
  upon DNA damage (showed in Fig.). We show that CtIP and BRCA1 are factors promoting
  and/or re-starting the locally paused RNAPII-mediated transcription. These upstream
  events guide the DSB repair choice towards HR through initiation and progression
  of DNA end resection, in a feedback loop in which proper CtIP and BRCA1 recruitment
  are stimulated by the RNAPII at the DSB site, at least in part through complex formation
  between CtIP and RNAPII. Additional proteins and auxiliary processes such as exosomes
  RNA splicing and Drosha/Dicer contribute to regulation of RNA:DNA hybrids along
  the initiated HR pathway to adjust this process in a cell context- and time-dependent
  manner to safeguard genomic integrity.
