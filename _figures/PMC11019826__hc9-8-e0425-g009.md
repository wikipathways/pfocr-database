caption: 'Schematic representation of how l-carnitine prevents the progression of
  MASH and the development of liver tumors. Insulin resistance, lipid peroxidation,
  and reactive oxygen species generation in MASH liver induce the expression of the
  stress-induced transcriptional factor EGR1. TGF-β1 accelerates the pathophysiology
  of MASH by acting as a positive feedback regulator between MASH and EGR1, which
  potentially activates the NEDD9/FAK/AKT oncogenic signaling pathway. l-carnitine
  could ameliorate EGR1-mediated NEDD9 expression by reducing ROS generation, improving
  lipid metabolism, and activating anti-inflammatory activity. Abbreviations: EGR1,
  early growth response 1; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MASH, metabolic dysfunction–associated
  steatohepatitis; NEDD9, neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated
  protein 9; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
