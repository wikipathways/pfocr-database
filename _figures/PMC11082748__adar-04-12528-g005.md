caption: The genes (N = 21) detected by IPA as involved in the neuroimmune pathway
  were entered into a representation using the GeneMANIA algorithm. The hatched genes
  are these genes. The solid genes are those added by the algorithm to complete the
  pathways. Fifty percent of the network structure is associated with coexpression,
  and 20% is associated with predicted associations
