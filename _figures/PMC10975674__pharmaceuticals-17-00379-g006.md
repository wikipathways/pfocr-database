caption: Oxidative stress and Nrf2–ARE signaling. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2 (Nrf2)–ARE is an important signaling pathway that regulates the expression
  of antioxidant enzymes. Nrf2 binds to KEAP1 in the cytoplasm and maintains low activity
  under normal physiological conditions. If cells are exposed to oxidative stress,
  Nrf2 unbinds KEAP1 and translocates into the nucleus to bind with ARE. This promotes
  the transcription and expression of a series of antioxidant enzymes, including heme
  oxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and thioredoxin (Trx)
