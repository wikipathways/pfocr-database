caption: Proposed direct model for dopamine-dependent ERK activation in D1-dopaminoceptive
  neurons. Cocaine acts by increasing synaptic dopamine leading to ERK activation
  in NAc, required for locomotor sensitization and CPP. It has previously been proposed
  that D1 receptor activation affects ERK activity only indirectly, via PKA- and DARPP-32/STEP-mediated
  inhibition of ERK dephosphorylation (; ), whereas direct ERK activation itself occurs
  in the D1 MSNs only via NMDAR-dependent glutamatergic signaling (; ) through calcium-sensitive
  Ras-guanine nucleotide releasing factor (Ras-GRF1) (; ). We propose here a more
  parsimonious mechanism for ERK-dependent cocaine-induced dopaminergic signaling,
  in which cAMP elevation by dopamine in D1-MSNs results in parcellation of signaling
  between ERK and CREB with separate cellular consequences under the control of each
  pathway. An indirect modulatory role for PKA-dependent ERK phosphatase inhibition
  after psychomotor stimulant administration (; ), and additional ERK regulation by
  glutamatergic input to D1 dopaminoceptive neurons in the context of cellular plasticity
  underlying cocaine addiction (; ; ; ) is not contradicted by this model. We posit
  that D1 receptor activation, and cAMP elevation, in D1 MSNs likely results in parallel
  effects on ERK, both directly via NCS-Rapgef2 and indirectly via PKA with the effects
  of cocaine requiring multiple necessary, but perhaps individually insufficient inputs
  activated by dopamine, that converge on D1-MSN ERK phosphorylation. These include
  PKA/DARPP/STEP/PP1 (), PKA/RasGRP2/Rap1 (,), a NMDAR-dependent ras activation (;
  ), and NCS-Rapgef2/Rap1/B-Raf/MEK.
