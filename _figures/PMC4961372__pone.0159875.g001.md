caption: 'Plant wounding induces the conversion of 18:3(n-3) to JA (for details see
  text). JA might be conjugated to Ile yielding JA-Ile, a reaction catalyzed by JAR1.
  JA-Ile is the bioactive phytohormone, which can be perceived by the SCFCOI-complex
  leading to the de-repression/induction of JA-responsive genes. Inactivation of JA-Ile
  signaling can be achieved via two possible routes: either by the enzymatic activity
  of the amido-hydrolases ILL6 and IAR3 that catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of JA-Ile,
  or by enzymatic activity of distinct members of the cytochrome P450 subfamily CYP94
  (i.e. CYP94B1, CYP94B3 and CYP94C1) that catalyze the sequential ω-oxidation of
  JA-Ile to 12-hydroxy-JA-Ile and 12-carboxy-JA-Ile. Although all three mentioned
  CYP94-enzymes have the capacity to catalyze the hydroxylation (mono-oxygenation)
  as well as the carboxylation (double oxygenation), they exhibit distinct catalytic
  specificities. Beside JA-Ile, oxidized JA-Ile derivatives may also serve as substrate
  for IAR3 (and Ill6) in planta. JAR, JASMONATE RESISTENT1; IAR3, IAA-ALA-RESISTENT3;
  ILL6, IAA-LEU RESISTENT-like6.'
