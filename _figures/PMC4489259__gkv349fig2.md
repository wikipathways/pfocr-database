caption: 'Output of a fictitious combination of gene expression and mutations in version
  of the Calcium signaling pathway modified for illustrating the examples. The figure
  illustrates the possible effects due to the combination of gene expression and gene
  loss of function within the topology of a pathway. In the figure, blue background
  indicates gene expression, while gray background means no expression in the tissue
  studied. Yellow background means unknown expression in the tissue. Black arrow indicates
  signal transmission whereas gray arrow means no signal is transmitted. (A) signal
  deactivation: the gene GNA11 is expressed but harbors a deleterious mutation and
  the signal does not flux downstream; (B) signal activation: the repressor INH harbors
  a deleterious mutation and therefore cannot inhibit PLN and the signal flux, that
  would be interrupted here with a functional protein, is activated instead; (C) neutral
  effect: PLCG1 with a deleterious mutation does not transmit the signal, however,
  The signal is transmitted anyway from EGFR to both, ITPR1 and PRKCA, through the
  protein PLCD3, because the receptor-effector signaling circuit is internally redundant;
  (D) neutral effect: several examples show how mutations affect to genes that are
  not expressed in the tissue studied (CACNA1A, CACNA1I, RYR1, etc.) and consequently
  have no effect in the particular tissue of study.'
