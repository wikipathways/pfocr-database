caption: 'Kynurenine metabolism after SBI. Surgical Brain Injury (SBI) induces the
  expression of immune-mediated cytokines which activate macrophages. The activation
  of macrophages stimulates synthesis of kynurenine in the brain which has target
  receptors in microglia and astrocytes, leading to the synthesis of QUIN and KYNA
  respectively. Abbreviations: SBI = Surgical Brain Injury, TRP = Tryptophan, IDO
  = Indoleamine 2,3 Dioxygenase, KAT II = Kynurenine Aminotransferase 2, KMO = Kynurenine
  3 Monooxygenase, KYNA = Kynurenic Acid, QUIN = Quinolinic Acid.'
