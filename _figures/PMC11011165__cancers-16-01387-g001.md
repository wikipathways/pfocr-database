caption: Mechanisms of inappropriate STAT activation in cancer cells. STATs can be
  activated constitutively in cancer cells through a variety of mechanisms. This can
  include autocrine or paracrine production of cytokines that can activate these pathways,
  activation of upstream kinases through mutation (such as in JAKs), overexpression
  (such as EGFR), inappropriate activation (such as SRC), or activating translocations
  (such as in BCR-ABL), and loss of negative regulators (such as SOCS3). Rarely, the
  STATs can be activated by mutation within the STAT itself
