caption: Several classical mechanisms of EDCs that contribute to the development of
  endometriosis [79, 80]. Under normal conditions, AHR is located in the cytoplasm,
  bound to a complex of proteins. In TCDD or PCBs treated PBMC and MenSCs, they both
  bind to AHR, forming a complex with ARNT. This complex is then transported into
  the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the AHR/ARNT complex promotes the transcription
  of IDO1, upregulating FOXP3 expression, increasing the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α,
  which promotes AHR promoter hypomethylation, and also enhanced MenSCs migration,
  ultimately promoting the formation of ectopic lesions. BPA acts on primary endometrial
  stromal cells (EnSC) and primary endometrial epithelial cells (EnEC) by binding
  to its receptor GPER. This interaction blocked estrogen signaling and triggered
  the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, leading to upregulated expression of MMP2 and MMP9,
  which increased the H3K27me3 level. BPA also activated the Wnt signaling pathway,
  further promoting cell proliferation and invasion, which contributed to the formation
  of ectopic lesions. Figure drawn by the author using BioRender based on information
