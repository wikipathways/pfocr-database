caption: 'OncoboxPD visualization of GDP-mannose biosynthesis molecular pathway. Nodes
  correspond to pathway participants. Color reflects node activation according to
  color scale on the bottom. For this example, thyroid papillary cancer sample 5 RNA
  sequencing profile  was normalized on six healthy thyroid samples from ANTE collection
  . Nodes that don’t correspond to known gene products are shown grey because for
  them no CNR value can be calculated. Auxiliary central nodes of biochemical reactions
  (BR) have rhombic shape and are filled in black. Ovals denote gene products, octagons
  - metabolites. Green arrows denote activating interactions. The figure can be found
  following the path: result file in Folders (“example” with green icon) ->sample
  TC15 in Sample table-> Pathway activation level tab-> De novo triacylglycerol biosynthesis
  pathway -> static graph. (For interpretation of the references to color in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)'
