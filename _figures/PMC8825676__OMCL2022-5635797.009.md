caption: Schematic of the chondroprotective effect of luteolin via the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway.
  Luteolin protected chondrocytes against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and inflammation
  by increasing levels of phosphorylated AMPK and activating Nrf2, which translocates
  into the nucleus to increase the transcription and expression of Nrf2-target genes,
  such as HO-1, NQO1, and GCLC.
