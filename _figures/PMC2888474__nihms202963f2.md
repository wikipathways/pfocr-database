caption: Genetic Alterations in Glioblastoma Occur Frequently in 3 Cellular Signaling                         Pathways.
  DNA alterations and copy number changes in the following signaling                         pathways
  are indicated in (a) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), RAS, and                         phosphoinositol–3–kinase
  (PI3K); (b) p53 tumor suppressor;                         and (c) retinoblastoma
  (Rb) tumor suppressor. Activating genetic alterations                         are
  shown in red. Genetic alterations that lead to a loss of function are                         indicated
  in blue. In each pathway, the altered components, the type of                         alteration,
  and the percentage of tumors carrying each alteration are shown.                         Blue
  boxes contain the total percentages of glioblastomas with alterations                         in
  at least 1 known component gene of the designated pathway. EGFR indicates                         epidermal
  growth factor receptor; MET, mesenchymal- epithelial transition                         factor;
  PDGFRA, platelet-derived growth factor receptor–A; PTEN,                         phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; . Reprinted with permission from The Cancer                         Genome
