caption: The mechanism of SLS. In trypanosomes all mRNA aretrans-spliced. In this
  process, the exon or spliced leader is donated to the mRNA from a small RNA, the
  spliced leader RNA. The SL RNA is transcribed and assembled in a distinct nuclear
  site that was termed the SL factory [], where the SL RNA is transcribed, modified
  and assembles with its binding protein. Under stress that perturbs the ER homeostasis
  such as blocking translocation of proteins across the ER membrane (via RNAi silencing
  of SRP receptor, SEC61, or SEC63) or by prolonged exposure to chemicals such as
  DTT and 2DG or under drastic pH changes, the SLS pathway is induced. The hallmarks
  of SLS are shut-off in SL RNA transcription due to the inability of tSNA42 to bind
  to the SL RNA promoter, leading to the accumulation of the tSNAP42 in the nucleus.
  The shut-off of SL RNA transcription leads to marked reduction in mRNA production
  and to induction of apoptosis. One key kinase in this pathway is PK-3, a serine-threonine
  kinase that transmits the signal from the ER to the nucleus. Despite the fact that
  trans-splicing is inhibited during SLS, the level of certain mRNAs is increased.
  These mRNAs may lead the synthesis of proteins that are essential for executing
  SLS.
