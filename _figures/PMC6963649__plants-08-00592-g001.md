caption: Overview of the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway. (A) Inactivation of
  SnRKs, CIPKs, and CDPKs under normal growth conditions (light orange box). PP2C
  (red oval box) plays an important role in the inactivation of SnRKs, CIPKs, and
  CDPKs. Inactive MAP3K17/18 (orange oval box) and AREB/ABF (Abscisic Acid Response
  Element/Abre-Binding Factor) (yellow oval box) undergo protein degradation. (B)
  Initial perception of environmental and developmental cues. ABA signaling is transduced
  in Ca2+-independent (light blue box) as well as Ca2+-dependent (light orange box)
  manners. Active SnRKs, CIPKs, and CDPKs (dark blue oval box) play important roles
  in downstream signal transduction. (C) Stomatal regulation via ABA signaling in
  response to stress and healthy conditions. Under stress conditions, stomatal regulation
  (purple arrow →) is carried out by active SnRK2.6/OST1 (blue oval box) through the
  regulation of downstream ion channel genes (green oval boxes), such as SLAH3, SLAC1,
  and KAT1. This regulation helps stomata remain closed to avoid loss of excessive
  water under adverse conditions. Under normal conditions, SnRK2.6/OST1 inactivated
  by PP2C cannot regulate the downstream genes; thus, stomata remain open. (D) Response
  to stress tolerance via the ABA signaling pathway. The stress tolerance mechanism
  (black arrow →) is regulated in Ca2+-independent as well as Ca2+-dependent manners.
  The MAP kinase cascade (orange oval box) pathway carries the signal for the response
  to abiotic stress tolerance. It delays ABA gene expression. Contrarily, signal transduction
  via only AREB/ABF (yellow oval box) shows early expression of ABA related genes,
  resulting in an early response to stress tolerance. (E) Involvement of ABA signaling
  in the plant developmental process. Downstream ABA signaling involved in different
  developmental processes (red arrow →) such as seed germination (light green oval
  and square boxes), lateral root growth (light blue oval and square boxes), and regulation
  of flowering time (yellow oval and square boxes). ABI5 emerges as a critical ABA
  signaling component in the regulation of the plant developmental process. ABA signaling
  integrates with light signaling (black dark oval box) to regulate plant development.
  The brown tack facing up (⊥) indicates the role of ubiquitination in ABA signaling.
  These E3 ubiquitin ligase elements in ABA signaling guide the inactive protein to
  undergo degradation. The question mark (?) indicates the unknown pathway.
