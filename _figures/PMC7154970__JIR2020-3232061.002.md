caption: The regulatory roles of microRNAs in Tregs. A—Foxp3 directly regulates the
  expression of micro155. Micro155 directly targets the 3′ UTR of the mRNA of suppressor
  of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), which suppresses IL-2 signaling. B—Micro146a negatively
  regulates IFNγ production by directly targeting its key transcription factor Stat1.
  C—Micro17-92 regulates secretion of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. D—The
  expression of micro142-3p is negatively regulated by Foxp3 directly or indirectly.
  Micro142-3p inhibits the production and secretion of cAMP and TGFβ by directly targeting
  adenylyl cyclase (AC) 9 and glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP), respectively.
  E—Micro10a regulates Treg stability by targeting the transcriptional repressor Bcl-6
  and the corepressor Ncor2. F—Micro15a/16 negatively regulates the expression of
  Foxp3 and CTLA-4. G—Micro568 regulates the activation, differentiation, and function
  of Tregs by targeting NFAT5. H—Let-7d plays an important role in the exosome-mediated
  immunosuppressive function of Tregs. I—Micro31 regulates periphery Treg generation
  by targeting Gpra5a. J—Micro125a-5p regulates the differentiation and function of
  Tregs by targeting IL-6R and Stat3. K—Micro126 influences the induction and suppressive
  function of Tregs through the PI3K/AKT pathway. L—Micro218 regulates the amount
  of Tregs by targeting VOPP1. M—Micro27 impairs the development and homeostasis of
  Tregs by targeting SMAD2/3, RUNX1, and c-Rel. N—Micro26a plays a vital role in the
  expansion and function of Tregs by targeting IL-6. O—Micro4281 promotes Tregs generation
  by binding to the TATA box of promoter of Foxp3.
