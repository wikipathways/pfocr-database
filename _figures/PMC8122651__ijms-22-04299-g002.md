caption: Roles of the nigrostriatal pathway in the regulation of the basal ganglia
  pathway. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the putamen receive stimulatory input through
  the cortico-striatal glutamatergic neurons. They also receive dopaminergic input
  through nigrostriatal DAergic neurons. DA stimulates the direct pathway by acting
  on the D1Rs expressed on the MSNs that project to the GPi but inhibits the indirect
  pathway by acting on the D2Rs expressed on the MSNs that project to the GPe. Thus,
  degeneration of DAergic neurons originating from the SN results in an under-stimulation
  of the direct pathway and under-inhibition of the indirect pathway, resulting in
  problems with purposeful movement. DR, dopamine receptor; Glu, glutamine; NMDAR,
  NMDA receptor. Figures created with https://biorender.com/ (accessed on 13 April
