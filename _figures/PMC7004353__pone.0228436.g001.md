caption: Design to compare effects of GVAD and Cyp1b1 deletion at different stages
  of development (Left) Mid-gestation; E9.5 liver budding Foregut/FG, Endoderm (Endo),
  Septum Transversum Mesenchyme (STM). (Center) PN0.5; Stellate activation markers
  examined. (Right) PN21; suppression of oleate and cholesterol pathway genes (A).
  Design for assessment of effects of a retinol-depleted maternal diet (GVAD versus
  Suff) and of Cyp1b1 deletion (WT versus Cyp1b1-/- pups) on livers at birth (PN0.5)
  and weaning (PN21). Gene expression and retinoid content in pooled livers are compared
  on the day after birth (n = 3 pools) and on individual pups at PN21 (B).
