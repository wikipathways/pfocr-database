caption: Expression ratios representing the changing abundance of 237 bone-related
  mRNA species in MC3T3-E1 cells between days 5 and 10 in culture were used to populate
  the IPA osteoarthritis pathway network and signaling pathway activation state was
  assessed using the IPA molecular pathway predictor tool. Observed upregulation and
  downregulation of mRNAs are shown in red and green, respectively, while predicted
  activation or inhibition of signaling intermediates and pathways are shown in orange
  and blue.
