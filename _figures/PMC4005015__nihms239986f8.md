caption: The hyperglycemic hexosamine pathway starting from the glycolytic intermediate,
  F-6-P, which is converted by GFAT to glucosamine-6-P and eventually to UDPGlcNAc,
  an O-linked GlcNAc. Intracellular glycosylation by adding GlcNAc moieties to serine
  and threonine residues of proteins (e.g. transcription factors) is catalysed by
  OGT. Increased glycosylation of transcription factors, such as Sp1, AP2 and CREB,
  often at phosphorylation sites, increases the expression of cytokines and enzymes,
  including TGF- β 1, PAI-1, and glycosyltransferase. In addition, AGEs can exert
  cellular effects by increasing a-series ganglioside levels to inhibit retinal pericyte
  cell proliferation. Other cytoplasmic proteins are also subjects to dynamical modification
  by hyperglycemia-induced O-linked GlcNAc, such as the inhibition of eNOS activity
  by O-acetylglucosaminylation at the Akt site of the eNOS protein and activations
  of various PKC isoforms by glucosamine without membrane translocation.
