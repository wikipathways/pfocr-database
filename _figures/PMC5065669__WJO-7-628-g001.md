caption: 'Cellular energy production. In skeletal muscle, glucose enters the cell
  through glucose transporter type 1 or 4 (GLUT1 or GLUT4, respectively). Glucose
  is converted to pyruvate in the glycolysis pathway. Pyruvate is transported across
  the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes (OMM and IMM, respectively) and into
  the mitochondrial matrix where it is converted into acetyl-coA. Fatty acids undergo
  β-oxidation in the mitochondria, creating acetyl-coA and NADH. Acetyl-coA is utilized
  by the Kreb’s cycle, creating NADH and succinate which enter the electron transport
  chain (ETC) at complex I and II, respectively. The movement of electrons through
  the ETC is coupled to the production of ATP in a process called OXPHOS. IMS: Intermembrane
  space; OXPHOS: Oxidative phosphorylation.'
