caption: Dendritic cells (DC) can either activate adaptive immunity or tolerize T
  cells depending on their state of maturation. DC progenitors develop from hematopoietic
  (bone marrow–derived) progenitors under the influence of various cytokines, particularly
  granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Under circumstances of
  microbial infection, specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (termed PAMPs)
  engage pattern recognition receptors (PAMPs), leading to release of pro-inflammatory
  danger signals that induce DC maturation. DC maturation leads to up-regulation of
  co-stimulatory molecules, MHC and chemokines that result in activation of T cells
  to effecter cells (right side of figure). In the absence of these “danger signals”,
  DCs follow a default pathway (left side of figure) in which they become “tolerizing
  DCs” that present antigen to T cells in the absence of co-stimulatory signals. This
  represents a steady-state pathway for continuous presentation of self-antigens.
  The consequence is that these T cells are turned off (anergy), inducing tolerance.
