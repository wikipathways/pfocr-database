caption: EGF receptor (EGFR) trafficking pathways and associated outcomes. Activated
  cell-surface EGFRs are internalized and sorted at the early endosome. The fate of
  the receptor has important consequences for biological cell outputs, with the recycling
  pathway favoring cell proliferation (depicted green), although the degradative pathway
  via ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-mediated sorting within
  multivesicular bodies (MVBs)/lysosomes correlates with normal cellular homeostasis
  (depicted in blue). Atypical trafficking pathways to the nucleus and mitochondria
  have also been described and are proposed to favor survival, but the transport mechanisms
  are not well established. Exposure to stress leads to the removal of the receptor
  from the cell surface, and this has been proposed to potentiate cell death (depicted
  in red). Conversely, stress-activated receptor might also be recycled, thereby promoting
  cell survival and/or proliferation.
