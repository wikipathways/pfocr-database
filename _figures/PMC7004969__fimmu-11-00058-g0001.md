caption: 'Selected important players of osteoblast differentiation. Promoting factors
  (green square) include: BMP: bone morphogenic proteins of the TGF-β superfamily,
  a large (>20) group of anabolic proteins secreted by different cells to ensure development
  of bone, cartilage and tendons mainly via the Runx2 axis. TGF-β: transforming growth
  factor β1−3, contained in bone cartilage tissue in large amounts. Regulates osteoblast
  differentiation and development similar to BMPs, with additional anti-inflammatory
  properties. IGF: insulin like growth factor, mainly promotes osteoblast activity,
  but also has positive effect on differentiation. FGF: fibroblast growth factor,
  stimulates OB differentiation in a manner similar to BMP signaling (Runx2 pathway).
  IL-11: is directly induced by mechanical strain in bone and PTH signaling and downregulates
  effects of Wnt inhibitors like Dkk-1/2. IL-17A: effects depend on targeted cell
  type. MSC differentiation is supported, but calvarial preosteoblasts receive negative
  effects. PTH: parathyroid hormone, only stimulates OB differentiation through Runx2
  if elevation of PTH is intermittent, continuously elevated levels result in bone
  resorption. Vitamin D: complexes Runx2 and other cofactors to upregulate osteoblast
  specific genes. Mechanical stimulation promotes bone growth and OB activity according
  to Wolff''s law: bone structure forms according to applied force. Inhibiting factors
  (orange square): TNFα: supposedly hampers with differentiation through inhibition
  of IGF-1, BMP-2/6 and possibly guiding SSCs to lineages other than osteoblasts.
  Dkk: the Dickkopf ligand family are potent inhibitors of the Wnt pathway, thus inhibiting
  development. HDCAs: histone deacetylases, prominently HDCA3-7 inhibit Runx2-DNA
  interaction, interfere in gene translation. CCL-3: also known as macrophage inflammatory
  protein 1-α (MIP-1-α) promotes inflammation and osteoclast activation. Additionally,
  it blocks the Runx2 pathway in OBs. Notch: effects of Notch on OBs are not fully
  clarified, although findings constitute a hampering function by Runx2 inhibition.
  Immobilization: absence of mechanical strain results in OB inhibition by non-triggering
  of Wolff''s law.'
