caption: Canonical signal transduction cascades in preclinical models of despair and
  major depressive disorder. On the left side of the figure, monoamine neurotransmitter
  binding to cognate receptors recruits G protein adapters to their intracellular
  C-terminal tail. This activates (Gs)/inhibits (Gi) the cAMP/PKA/CREB cascade. Adenylyl
  cyclase converts ATP-to-cAMP, which stimulates protein kinase A to phosphorylate
  CREB. Phospho-CREB translocates to the nucleus to stimulate transcription of target
  genes involved in neuroprotection, neurotransmission, and cytoskeletal dynamics.
  On the right, neurotrophins bind to their cognate receptor tyrosine kinases and
  induce the autophosphorylation of their intracellular domain(s). This recruits numerous
  adapter proteins to the plasma membrane and stimulates protein–protein interactions
  that culminate in the activation of Raf, a protein kinase. Raf activates the small
  molecule Ras to induce mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Like the cAMP/PKA/CREB
  cascade, the MAPK/ERK pathway culminates in nuclear translocation of transcription
  factors (including CREB) to the nucleus. There is also cross-talk between these
  two cascades (as depicted in the middle of the figure) via phosphoinosotides leading
  to Akt activation. Akt phosphorylates GSK-3β, which dissociates it from Axin and
  APC (“degradation complex”). This stabilizes β-catenin and facilitates its nuclear
  translocation. Please refer to the accompanying text for a discussion of intracellular
  second messenger/signal transduction aberrations in depression, normalizing responses
  with antidepressants, and experimental targets for future drug development. βAR,
