  AA transporters also serve key roles. SLC38A2 mediates proline and alanine uptake,
  and its deletion decreases bone mass in mice. SLC1A5 supplies glutamine and asparagine,
  key for protein synthesis and osteoblast differentiation. SLC1A5 and SLC7A7 (γ+-LAT1)
  coordinate glutamine uptake in response to Wnt signaling. Knockdown of these transporters
  impairs glutamine uptake and blocks Wnt-induced osteogenesis. Osteoclastogenesis
  depends on dynamic AA metabolism. Key EAA-derived metabolites (from Leu, Ile and
  Phe) promote differentiation under AA deficiency. Arginine is key for RANKL-induced
  osteoclast formation; its depletion impairs differentiation independently of mTORC1
  and can be rescued by citrulline or argininosuccinate. Glutamine supports biosynthesis
  and energy production via α-ketoglutarate (αKG), activates NFATc1 epigenetically
  through the serine synthesis pathway, and is required in late differentiation via
  SLC1A5 and GLS. Hypoxia increases glutamine demand, and MYC inhibition suppresses
  this pathway. IL-17-αKG signaling contributes to bone loss and is blocked by SLC1A5
  inhibitor V9302. Tryptophan catabolism via IDO regulates Th17/Treg balance, indirectly
  affecting osteoclast activity. BMSC, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell; EAA, essential
