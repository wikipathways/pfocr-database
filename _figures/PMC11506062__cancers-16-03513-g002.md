caption: 'An overview of the major metabolic pathways at work within cancer cells.
  Cell survival, growth, and proliferation require glucose to generate ATP, lipids,
  and amino acids through glycolysis, alongside other downstream reactions and pathways,
  including the pentose phosphate pathway, glutaminolysis, lipid synthesis, and branched-chain
  amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. The Warburg effect, characterized by increased glucose
  uptake and lactate production despite adequate oxygen, highlights metabolic reprogramming,
  supporting rapid tumor growth and survival even under oxidative conditions. The
  mTOR signaling pathway regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, and cytoskeletal
  organization in response to insulin, growth factors, and other metabolic and cellular
  cues. Additionally, p53 plays an important role in promoting ATP production, facilitating
  citric acid cycle (also referred to as the TCA cycle or Krebs cycle) and glutamate
  synthesis, while regulating glycolysis and lipid synthesis. Dysregulation of mTOR
  signaling and p53 has been implicated in numerous diseases, including cancer and
  metabolic disorders. Moreover, the metabolic processes of cancer cells operate in
  distinct ways depending on the availability of nutrients. In situations where nutrients
  are abundant (nutrient-replete conditions), there is a focus on nucleotide production,
  lipid generation, and the utilization of glutamine. Conversely, under nutrient-deprived
  conditions, cancer cells favor fatty acid oxidation, acetate breakdown, the utilization
  of BCAAs, and glutaminolysis related to macropinocytosis and autophagy. Understanding
  the metabolic adaptations of cancer cells to diverse nutrient environmental conditions
  is vital for developing targeted therapies to combat disease progression. Abbreviations:
