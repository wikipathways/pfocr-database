caption: A schematic diagram of the potential mechanisms for CDDO-Me–mediated Nrf2
  activation in CHF. On the one hand, CDDO-Me promotes the dissociation of Nrf2 from
  Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1; a natural Nrf2 inhibitor) in the cytosol,
  thus translocating to the nucleus where enhanced binding of Nrf2 to CBP promotes
  pro-antioxidant pathways, and reduced binding of NF-κB to CBP results in the inhibition
  of the pro-oxidant pathway in CHF. At the same time, Nrf2 binds to its own promoter
  at AREL1 and AREL2 sites to amplify its antioxidative effects by increasing its
  own transcription. On the other hand, CDDO-Me may inhibit the binding of NF-κB to
  DNA and subsequent transcriptional activation through the direct interaction with
  IκB kinase (IKK) β to prevent NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. AREL1 and AREL2,
  Antioxidant Response Element (ARE)-Like Sequence 1 and 2.
