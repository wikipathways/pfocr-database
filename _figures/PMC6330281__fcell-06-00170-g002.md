caption: The Wnt signaling cascades. (A) The canonical Wnt signaling cascade depends
  on β-catenin, which serves as an intracellular signaling molecule. In case Wnt is
  not binding to Fz receptors, β-catenin is sequestered into a destruction complex
  composed of Axin, CK1α, APC and GSK3β, phosphorylated, ubiquitinylated and subsequently
  degraded by the proteasome. Following the binding of Wnt to Fz receptors and LRP5/6
  co-receptors, DSH recruits the destruction complex to the cell membrane by interacting
  with the receptor complex. This allows newly synthesized β-catenin to accumulate
  within the cytoplasm and to translocate to the nucleus. By displacing the transcriptional
  co-repressor groucho from TCF transcription factors, nuclear β-catenin can activate
  a gene transcription program, whereas Wnt-binding antagonists (sFRPs/WIF) and Wnt
  receptor antagonists (Dkk/SOST) inhibit the canonical cascade. (B) The non-canonical
  Wnt signaling cascade is characterized by the activation through phosphorylation
  cascades, which are themselves activated by specific ligand–receptor interactions,
  seemingly without engagement of the LRP co-receptors. Increasing intracellular Ca2+
  levels following PLC- and DAG production can trigger many of these cascades. Subsequently,
  PKC and CaMKII can activate transcription factors like NFκB and CREB, mediated IP3
  and calmodulin is involved in the activation of NFAT. However, only the Wnt-binding
  antagonists are able to inhibit the non-canonical cascade. APC, adenomatous polyposis
  coli; CaMKII, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II; CK1α, caseine
  kinase 1-α; CREB, cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  Dkk, Dickkopf; DSH, disheveled; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3 β; IP3, inositol
  1,4,5-triphosphate; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; NFAT,
  nuclear factor of activated T cells; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; sFRPs, secreted frizzled-related
  proteins; SOST, sclerostin; WIF, Wnt inhibitory factor.
