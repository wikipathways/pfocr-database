caption: The diagram shows the cell signaling pathways, which were involved in postconditioning.
  Reperfusion after stroke leads to ROS eruption, which causes dysfunction of the
  Akt cell signaling pathway, increases δ PKC activity, although decreases ε PKC activity;
  in addition, ROS also activates JNK and ERK activity. Furthermore, the Akt pathway
  is associated with the JNK and ERK pathways. The PI3K–Akt inhibition directly results
  in dephosphorylation of GSK3β and β-catenin degradation, and indirectly causes cytochrome
  c release and caspase-s activity. ε PKC may activate KATP channel resulting in neuroprotection.
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; Cyto C, cytochrome c; Cas-3, caspase-3; GSK 3 β, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; P-Akt,
  phosphorylated Akt; P-PTEN, phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
  on chromosome 10; P-PDK1, phosphorylated phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases; KATP
  channels, ATP-sensitive potassium channels.
