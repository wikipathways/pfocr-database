caption: 'A hypothesis for mechanisms of release of cardiac troponins into serum in
  COVID-19 patients. Current evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infects cardiac myocytes
  by binding to ACE2 and entering the cell by endocytosis and eventually releasing
  single-stranded mRNA that replicates. Lower levels of ACE2 induce an increase in
  AngII levels, an increase in binding to the AT1R, and activation of Gq and β-arrestin
  signaling (shown in green). Signaling via Gq induces maladaptations whereas signaling
  via β-arrestin not only desensitizes the receptor but also induces adaptive responses.
  With the elevation in AngII, there is generation of Ang [–], as a cardioprotective
  biased ligand favoring β-arrestin signaling over the Gq pathway. Also noted is evidence
  that with activation of β-arrestin signaling either by AngII or biased ligands there
  is an induction of its translocation directly to the sarcomeres thick and thin filaments
  illustrated in the lower left, as well as indicated in a cytoplasmic pool of cTn.
  Together with co-morbidities listed in the left-most panel, the dysfunctional AngII
  signaling arising from infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to frank necrosis or membrane
  instabilities in which cTn is released from the cytoplasmic and likely the sarcomeric
  pool to the serum. AMI: Acute Myocardial Infarction; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
  ss mRNA: single stranded mRNA; AngII: Angiotensin II; ARB: Angiotensin Receptor
  Blocker; ACE2: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2; PKC: Protein Kinase C; See discussion
  in text and reference [] for further information.'
