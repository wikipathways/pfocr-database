caption: Model of STAT3-dependent negative regulation of DCs induced by HDAC inhibition.
  In BMDCs, SAHA treatment induced STAT3 acetylation, which directly induced expression
  of Ido and IL-10Ra. The upregulation of IL-10Ra enhanced the IL-10 signaling pathway
  which supports accentuation of IDO expression, forming a positive feedforward mechanism
  for sustaining the tolerogenic function of BMDCs following SAHA treatment.
