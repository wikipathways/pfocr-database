caption: 'Top left, in red: NK cells recognize tumor targets that lack MHC, as this
  prevents the inhibitory response mediated by KIR. Several tumors down-regulate MHC
  in response to T cell immune pressure. The same pathway does not become activated
  in the setting of allogeneic NK cells and is only engaged when NK cell effectors
  recognize self MHC. Bottom, in blue: NK cell activating receptor ligands are expressed
  by numerous malignancies [-,,-], and these tumors engage NK-activating receptors,
  some of which associate with ITAM-containing DAP10 and DAP12 to mediate NK cell
  activation via proteins such as Vav1 and PLCγ2. Top right, in green: NK cells are
  the principal effectors of ADCC, mediating tumor lysis in settings when antibodies
  targeting overexpressed surface targets are used. Various antibodies have been developed
  to recruit ADCC against tumor cells bearing targets such as Her2, CD20, EGFR, and/or
  CD52. These antibodies bind to the CD16 receptor, which, in turn, is associated
  with ITAM-containing proteins such as the TCRζ chain–leading to NK cell activation.'
