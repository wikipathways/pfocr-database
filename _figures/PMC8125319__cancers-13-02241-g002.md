caption: 'BRAF inhibition and genetic mechanisms of secondary cancer and resistance.
  BRAF Inhibition: BRAFV600E results in constitutive activation of the pro-survival
  MAPK pathway. BRAF inhibitors target the oncogenic BRAF mutation and initially are
  highly effective. Secondary Cancer: BRAF inhibitors can paradoxically activate the
  MAPK pathway in cells with wild type BRAF and oncogenic RAS mutations by signaling
  through CRAF, resulting in cSCC development. The occurrence of cSCC is reduced when
  MEK inhibitors are used to further restrict the activation of the MAPK pathway.
  Resistance to both BRAF inhibition and MEK inhibition predominately develop through
  RAS, BRAFV600E, MEK, RTK, PTEN, or AKT mutations indicated by red stars. These mutations
  either reactivate the MAPK pathway or upregulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pro-survival
  pathway. cSCC, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase;
