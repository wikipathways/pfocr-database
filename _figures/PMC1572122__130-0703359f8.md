caption: Schematic pathway for TNF-α and IL-1β signaling of cellular proliferation.
  Each solid line and arrow represents a step in an activating pathway. Each T-shaped
  and dashed line represents inactivation or inhibition. TNF-α and IL-1β bind to their
  receptors (R) and activate phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C (PC-PLC) and phosphatidylinositide-phospholipase
  C (PI-PLC) through the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase (TK) to induce protein
  kinase C (PKC) activation. Activation of PKC leads to sequential phosphorylation
  of MEK1/2 and p42/p44 MAPK that relays extracellular signalling into nuclei. TNF-α
  and IL-1β induce activation of the components of downstream p42/p44 MAPK and enhance
  DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in TSMCs.
