caption: Schematic representation of the difference between Ctenopharyngodon idella
  melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (CiMDA5) and C. idella retinoic acid-inducible
  gene I (CiRIG-I) in inducing grass carp IFNs (CiIFN) genes. The red arrows indicate
  the RIG-I pathway, while yellow arrows indicate the MDA5 pathway. Under grass carp
  reovirus (GCRV) infection, CiMDA5 and CiRIG-I facilitate the holistic phosphorylation
  levels of grass carp IFN regulatory factor 3 (CiIRF3) and CiIRF7. Both CiMDA5 and
  CiRIG-I enhance heterodimerization of CiIRF3 and CiIRF7. Differently, CiMDA5 facilitates
  but CiRIG-I weakens the threonine phosphorylation level of CiIRF7, which results
  in the status that CiMDA5 facilitates but CiRIG-I weakens the homodimerization of
  CiIRF7. This mechanism explains that CiMDA5 induces a stronger CiIFN-I response
  than CiRIG-I under GCRV infection in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney cells.
