caption: Schematic representation of dual role of BCAP in regulating inflammatory
  responses and induction of tissue repair genes. (Left) In WT macrophages, TLR ligation
  by LPS leads to activation of NF-κB which culminates in production of inflammatory
  cytokines. TLR ligation also activates PI3K-AKT in a BCAP-dependent manner. Activated
  AKT phosphorylates its downstream targets FOXO1 and GSK3β to limit inflammation.
  AKT activation also enhances glycolysis, which leads to accumulation of metabolic
  byproducts like lactate. This metabolite is used to promote histone lactylation,
  which is important for the up-regulation of reparative genes and overall reparative
  transition of macrophages. (Right) In BCAP-deficient macrophages, TLR ligation does
  not lead to activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, which results in lack of inactivation
  of FOXO1 and GSK3β resulting in enhanced inflammatory phenotype. In addition, lack
  of active AKT leads to decreased glycolysis and lower production of lactate. This
  translates into reduced histone lactylation and hampered expression of reparative
  genes, thus diminishing reparative macrophage transition. Figure was created using
  Biorender.
