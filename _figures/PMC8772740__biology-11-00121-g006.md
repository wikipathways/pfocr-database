caption: Proposed mechanism of signaling crosstalk between Sema3A-Nrp1 and HR pathways.
  Results of stimuli by histamine and high extracellular Ca2+ are reflected in the
  possible mechanisms for kCer regulation of cell migration and differentiation. HR,
  histamine receptor; Nrp1, neuropilin1; DG, diacylglycerol. Black arrows, activations
  via histamine; broken-lined red arrows, activations by kCer; thick-lined red arrows,
  activations by high Ca2+; , suppression via histamine.
