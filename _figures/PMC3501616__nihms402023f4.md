caption: The hypothetical pathway links the IRF6 gene regulatory network (IRF6, TP63,
  TFAP2A, and TGFB3, all previously implicated in craniofacial development) with the
  Rho signaling pathway through ARHGAP29. This pathway may also involve WNT and TGFB3,
  which can signal through the Rho pathway, and are required for craniofacial development.
  We propose that decreased ARHGAP29 would maintain Rho in an active state, which
  would negatively regulate processes critical for craniofacial development such as
  cellular migration. GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor.
