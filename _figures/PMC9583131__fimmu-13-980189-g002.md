caption: 'Anti-Inflammatory properties of SSRIs. (A) CNS-mediated mechanisms: SSRIs
  target microglial cells to impact through TLR4 and CD14, resulting in decreased
  inflammatory cytokines generation (IL-1ß and TNF-α) and reduced free radicals production.
  HPA-axis activation via alteration in cytokine network comes up with inflammation
  decrement. (B) Peripheral mechanisms: T-cell activation is inhibited by diminished
  antigen presentation of intestine-habitant DC. Circulating immune cells are also
  impressed; increasing cAMP in monocytes and macrophages brings about inflammatory
  cytokines drop. Generic immune cells were targeted through decreased pro-inflammatory
  cytokine gene expression, followed by subsidence in the NF-κB pathway activity and
  B-cell activation. Also, alleviating TLR3 activity with the inhibition of the IRF3
  pathway leads to an inflammation drop. SSRIs directly affect T-cell by reducing
  TLR2/4 expression, a decline in IFN-γ generation, a rise in IL-10 production, and
  disturbance in their proliferation.'
