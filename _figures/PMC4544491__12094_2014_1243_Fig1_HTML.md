caption: Interaction and synergism involving fluoropyrimidines and gemcitabine. Yellow
  triangles signal the active metabolites of this synergistic combination able to
  produce direct damage to nucleic acids. The blue pathway refers to normal integration
  of pyrimidines into DNA and RNA. The purple line represents fluoropyrimidines metabolism,
  just as the green pathway depicts to gemcitabine intervention. Crossroad and so
  synergism is located at tymidylate synthase (TS), being inhibited directly by fluoropyrimidine
  metabolite FdUDP and indirectly by the inhibition of the enzyme that catalyzes TS
  substratum, dUMP (deoxiuridine monophosphate)
