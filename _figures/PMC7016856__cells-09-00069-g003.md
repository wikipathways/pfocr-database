caption: Regulation of fibrotic signaling pathways by PKA and AKAPs. (A) AKAP13-dependent
  modulation of fibrotic responses in ventricular fibroblasts. (Left side) Stimulation
  of AT1-Rs by Ang-II enhances AKAP13 Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)
  activity through a signaling pathway that involves Gα12. Active RhoA released from
  AKAP13 promotes several pro-fibrotic responses including myofibroblast differentiation,
  collagen production, TGFβ1 production, migration, and invasion. (Right side) Phosphorylation
  of AKAP13 by anchored PKA is known to promote 14-3-3 recruitment and inhibition
  of AKAP13 RhoGEF activity. PKA has also been shown to phosphorylate Rho guanine
  nucleotide dissociation inhibitor α (RhoGDIα), which favors its association with
  RhoA-GTP and RhoA inhibition. It remains to be established whether AKAP13-anchored
  PKA can mediate these two inhibitory responses in cardiac fibroblasts. Termination
  of cAMP signaling is mediated AKAP13-anchored PDE4. (B) AKAP12-dependent regulation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cardiac fibroblasts. Binding of aldosterone
  to mineralocorticoid receptors induces their nuclear translocation and the activation
  of a transcriptional response that results in the downregulation of AKAP12 mRNA
  and protein. Suppression of AKAP12 expression leads to the downregulation of PGC-1α.
  This inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis and promotes the production of ROS and oxidative
  stress, a potent activator of pro-fibrotic signaling pathways.
