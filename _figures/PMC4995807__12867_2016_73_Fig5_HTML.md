caption: Overview of NPM1 functions in various DNA damage response pathways. NPM1
  has been shown to modulate the BER pathway as well as the translesion synthesis
  by modulating the levels of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) and polymerase
  eta. In the absence of NPM1 or with the expression of non-phosphorylatable NPM1,
  double-strand break repair by homologous recombination fails to be completed, however
  the exact mechanism of NPM1 function in these pathway remain to be fully elucidated
