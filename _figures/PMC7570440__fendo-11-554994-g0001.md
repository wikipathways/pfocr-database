caption: Major longevity pathways and longevity-associated transcription factors in
  C. elegans. The IIS pathway is one of the most studied longevity pathways. DAF-2,
  AGE-1, and DAF-16 are its three key genes. Mutations in DAF-2 and AGE-1 and low
  IIS activity prolong lifespan via DAF-16 and downstream gene expression. AMPK is
  another crucial metabolic energy sensor that links nutrient availability to lifespan
  by binding and phosphorylating a set of transcriptional (co)activators. The mTOR
  pathway is another critical pathway that links nutrient availability and metabolism
  to longevity; however, its mechanism remains to be fully elucidated (, –).
