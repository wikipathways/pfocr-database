caption: Summary scheme of LRP4:MuSK signaling. (A) Signaling events differentially
  induce AChR clustering toward either NMJ formation and motor neuron innervation
  or toward formation of aneural clusters. (B) Details of neural and aneural NMJ signaling
  via LRP4:MuSK activation. In canonical (agrin-dependent) NMJ signaling, binding
  of agrin to co-receptor LRP4 stimulates activation of MuSK and downstream effector
  functions (left). In this pathway, Neurotrypsin likely operates as a regulator through
  specific agrin cleavage at α and β sites; non-canonical (i.e., agrin-independent)
  events such as cross-talk with Wnt and BMP signaling pathways also trigger MuSK
  activation, possibly through direct binding of Wnt ligands and inhibitors to MuSK
  Fz-CRD or to LRP4 β-E domain clusters. The downstream effector functions differ
  into a spectrum that highlights numerous aneural regulatory events that could be
  particularly critical prior to motor neuron innervation and NMJ formation.
