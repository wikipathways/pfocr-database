caption: (A) Protein-level dosage compensation predominantly targets subunits of multiprotein
  complexes. The Ac/N-end rule pathway is involved in the underlying mechanism for
  the selective compensation of unassembled subunits. (B) An experimental setup for
  measuring the contribution of each quality control factor to dosage compensation.
  The untagged dosage-compensated protein was expressed from multicopy plasmid pTOW40836
  containing the native regulatory sequences, including promoter and 5´ and 3´ untranslated
  regions. If the target gene is subjected to dosage compensation, the level of the
  TAP-tagged target protein expressed only from the chromosome decreases upon an increase
  in gene copy number (Multi) compared to vector control (Single). The Multi/Single
  ratio is higher than that in WT cells in the deletion mutant of a gene encoding
  an E3 ubiquitin ligase or a catalytic subunit of each NAT, if the deleted factor
  contributes to the compensation of the target gene.
