caption: Schematic depiction of the effects of regular exercise on inflammatory conditions
  in multiple sclerosis and COVID-19 diseases. The generally common and different
  pathways through which MS and COVID-19 cause an inflammatory condition are shown
  on the left while isolated effects of regular exercise that regulate/modulate inflammation
  are shown on the right. Plus (+) signs represent the incremental effects of exercise,
  while minus (−) signs represent decreased effects of exercise. The cumulative effects
  of regular exercise are shown by the thick green arrows and green circles. Treg
  cells, T regulatory cells; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; CAIP, cholinergic
  anti-inflammatory pathway; SNS, sympathetic nervous system; ACh, acetyl choline;
  TLRs, toll-like receptors.
