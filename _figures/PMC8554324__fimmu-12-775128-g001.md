caption: 'Remodeling of the healthy niche into a permissive leukemic niche. Neuropathy:
  Leukemic progression is associated with sympathetic neuropathy. Loss of β2-adrenergic
  signaling directly promotes leukemic progression and triggers the expansion of MSCs
  primed for osteoblastic differentiation but with a defect in terminal maturation
  leading to a reduction in mineralized trabecular bone. Mesenchymal stem cells: In
  leukemia, MSCs are dysfunctional expressing lower levels of key healthy HSC niche
  factors such as Scf and Cxcl12 impairing healthy hematopoiesis. LSCs express high
  levels of the CXCL12 receptor CXCR4 and other adhesion molecules such as CD44 and
  VLA-4 to usurp the adhesion mechanisms of healthy HSCs. MSC also contribute to LSC
  survival by the production of microvesicules and via mitochondria transfer, providing
  energy support. Alteration of the vascular niche: The expression of VEGF in the
  leukemic niche induces an increase in vascular density and the production of NO
  by endothelial cells increases vascular leakiness contributing to hypoxia. In leukemia,
  endosteal blood vessels are more disrupted than the central bone marrow ones. Adipocytes:
  Leukemic cells support their own metabolism and survival by stimulating lipolysis
  which fuels fatty acid oxidation in chemotherapy resistant LSCs expressing the fatty
  acid transporter CD36. Inflammatory niche: Activation of Notch signaling in osteolineage
  cells leads to the activation of the NF-κB pathway in leukemic cells supporting
  their survival and proliferation. An autocrine secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules
  like IL-1 and TNF-α also activates the NF-κB pathway. HSC, hematopoietic cells;
