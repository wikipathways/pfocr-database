caption: Hypothetical action mechanism of aspirin on nonalcoholic fatty liver and
  atherosclerosis. Simultaneous amelioration of both nonalcoholic fatty liver and
  atherosclerosis by aspirin is mainly achieved by catabolic activation, anti-inflammation,
  or vasodilation, which are the result of sequential regulation of the PPARδ→p-AMPK→PGC-1α→oxidative
  phosphorylation pathway. In addition, the effects of aspirin are achieved by macrophage
  modulations, which include the increase of mannose receptor and decrease of CCR2.
