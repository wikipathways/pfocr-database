caption: Mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein-signaling pathway are linked
  to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary artery hypertension. Loss-of-function
  or loss-of-expression mutations of genes involved in BMP signaling correlate with
  the pathogenesis of HHT. Loci targeted include the ligand (BMP9), the type II receptor
  (BMPR2), the type I receptor (ACVRL1), the type III receptor (Eng), the R-Smad (Smad9),
  the co-Smad (Smad4), and Drosha. Mutations in the BMPR2 gene were also found in
  patients with pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). A small number of individuals
  with BMP9, ACVRL1, Eng, or BMPR2 mutations develop both HHT and PAH, indicating
  a genetic overlap between these disorders. Star indicates mutations associated with
  HHT and circle indicates mutations associated with PAH. BMP, bone morphogenetic
  protein; HHT, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia; PAH, pulmonary artery hypertension;
  SBE, Smad binding element.
