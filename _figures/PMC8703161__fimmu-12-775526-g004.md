caption: Role of gut microbiota-associated bile acids metabolism in liver injury and
  regeneration. After a liver injury or partial hepatectomy, bile acids (BAs) absorbed
  from the intestine suddenly become too high for the remnant liver, leading to secondary
  liver injury. Excessive BAs binding to hepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) inhibits
  transcription of cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (CYP7A1), which reduces
  the production of primary BAs. In addition, activated FXR can promote the secretion
  of primary BAs into bile canaliculus and upregulate expression of Foxm1b, thus relieving
  BAs overload and facilitating liver regeneration. Meanwhile, in the small intestine,
  BAs activate intestinal FXR to secret fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15/19, which
  binds to fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4). FGFR4/agonist also induces
  expression of Foxm1b and improves proliferation. Gut microbiota is responsible for
  secondary BAs production in the large intestine. Secondary BAs binding to intestinal
  transforming growth factor 5 (TGR5) elicits secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1
  (GLP1), which activates the insulin signaling pathway. Absorbed secondary BAs binding
  to hepatic TGR5 has an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing the release of TNF-α
  from the Kupffer cell. TGR5 activation also promotes BAs secretion by secreting    and
  Cl- from cholangiocyte and increasing transformation of hydrophilic BAs from hydrophobic
  BAs, which reduce BAs load and BAs toxicity-induced liver injury, promoting liver
  regeneration. Moreover, primary BAs stimulate and secondary BAs suppress the expression
  of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 16 (CXCL16) by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells
  (LSECs). CXCL16 is a chemokine that recruits natural killer T (NKT) cells, which
  suppress liver tumors.
