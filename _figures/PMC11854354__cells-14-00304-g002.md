caption: The signaling cascades generalized for ubiquitin-mediated IKK activation
  in IL-1R/TLR and TNF pathways. K63-linked ubiquitin chains modified to IRAK1 by
  TRAF6 in the IL-1R/TLR pathway or RIP1 by cIAP1/2 in the TNF pathway bind to TAB2/3
  subunits of the TAK1 kinase complex, and this binding promotes autophosphorylation
  of TAK1, which results in its activation. In the meantime, the K63-linked and/or
  linear ubiquitin chains resulting from the LUBAC catalyzation on IRAK1 or RIP1 also
  bind to NEMO, bringing the IKK complex into the vicinity of TAK1, thereby facilitating
  the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of IKKβ by TAK1. An arrow with a curved
  dashed line indicates “ubiquitinate”, and an arrow with a curved solid line indicates
  “phosphorylate”. The different ubiquitin chain linkages are color-coded. The depiction
  of the signaling model is adapted from the articles [21,47]
