caption: In response to tissue damage, neutrophils perform diverse functions in the
  wound bed including phagocytosis, ROS production, cytokine release, NET formation
  (neutrophil extracellular trap) and apoptosis. Discrete metabolic changes are tied
  to these different functions. (1) Damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released
  from cells (e.g., DNA, histones, HMGB1, N-formyl peptides, ATP, etc.), chemokines
  and lipid mediators act as powerful neutrophil chemoattractant. ATP released from
  mitochondria into the extracellular space activates purinergic signaling and mTOR
  which are required for neutrophil chemotaxis. mTOR signaling and extracellular Ca2+
  influx downstream of purinergic signaling reinforce chemotaxis and lead to neutrophil
  activation. (2) Following activation, neutrophils rely heavily on glycolysis to
  meet their energy demands. (3) NADPH oxidase (NOX)-generated reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) are crucial for the phagocytic function of neutrophils. NOX uses excess NADPH
  produced via shunting of the glycolytic intermediate (Glucose-6-P) through the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP). Nucleotide synthesis through ribose-5-P is also activated
  in phagocytic neutrophils. (4) Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and neutrophil
  death (NETosis) also rely on glycolytic by-products from the PPP to control inflammation
  and bacterial killing. (5) Rising intracellular levels of ROS and Ca2+ efflux signal
  to mitochondria which can disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Disruption
  of MMP leads to release of cytochrome-c which activates caspases leading to apoptosis.
