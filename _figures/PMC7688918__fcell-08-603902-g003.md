caption: In response to I/R injury, neutrophils migrate from the circulation to the
  injured heart in response to CXCL and release S100A8/A9. The heterodimeric complex
  binds to RAGE on the surface of immune cells and stimulates immune cells to secrete
  inflammatory cytokines by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. On the other hand,
  S100A8/A9 interacts with TLR-4 to inhibit NDUFs gene expression by suppressing the
  PGC-1/NRF1 signaling pathway, which decreases cardiac mitochondria electron transport
  chain (ETC) complex I activity. Mitochondrial dysfunction eventually leads to the
  death of cardiomyocytes.
