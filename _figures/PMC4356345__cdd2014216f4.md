caption: Caspase function in tissue regeneration and tumor cell proliferation. Activation
  of caspase-3 and -7 during radiotherapy or during tissue injury causes cleavage
  and activation of iPLA2. This results in AA synthesis and subsequent PGE2 activation.
  The secreted PGE2 promotes proliferation in surrounding tumor cells by activation
  of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This facilitates tumor cell repopulation and acts as
  a limiting factor of effective therapy. Shedding of microparticles by apoptosing
  cells (pancreatic beta cells) stimulates proliferation/differentiation of neighboring
  cells through activation of regenerating (reg) genes. PGE2 also interacts with Wnt
  signaling pathway to regulate stem cell/progenitor formation and function. iPLA2,
  calcium-independent phospholipase A2; AA, arachidonic acid; PGE2, prostaglandin
  E2; HSC, hematopoietic stem cells
