caption: 'The building blocks of heme are succinyl CoA and glycine, which combine
  to form delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), the first committed intermediate of the
  pathway. ALA synthase is encoded by two distinct genes: ALAS2 in the bone marrow
  and ALAS1 elsewhere, including the liver (see text). The second step involves condensation
  of two molecules of ALA to form porphobilinogen (PBG), the pyrrole subunit of the
  heme ring. Four PBGs are linked initially in a linear tetrapyrrole, hydroxymethylbilane,
  which cyclizes to form the initial porphyrin of the pathway, uroporphyrinogen (UROgen).
  The sequential conversion of UROgen to coproporphyrinogen (COPROgen) and finally
  to protoporphyrinogen (PROTOgen) involves successive removal of peripheral carboxyl
  groups. The dashed arrow indicates that the end-product, heme, exerts feedback regulation
  on the formation of ALA, the initial committed intermediate. The gene symbols for
  the pathway enzymes are noted in .ALA, delta-aminolevulinic acid; PBG, porphobilinogen;
  URO, uroporphyrin; COPRO, coproporphyrin; PROTO, protoporphyrin.'
