caption: Proposed model by which CD4+ T-cell response involved in Parkinson's disease
  are triggered in the gut mucosa. (1) In healthy conditions, gut microbiota produces
  SCFAs and high levels of dopamine. (2) In addition to the gut microbiota, catecholaminergic
  neurons of the enteric nervous system also contribute to the secretion of high dopamine
  levels into the gut mucosa and lumen. (3) SCFAs and dopamine stimulate GPR41, GPR43,
  and GPR109A and low-affinity dopamine receptors (i.e., DRD2), respectively in CD4+
  T-cells, favouring their differentiation into Tregs and their suppressive activity,
  thereby promoting tolerance to food-derived and microbiota-derived antigens. (4)
  Under some circumstances, such as dysbiosis, some tight junctions components become
  down-regulated and thereby epithelial layer of gut mucosa might be disrupted. Consequently,
  some strains of gut microbiota trigger an initial inflammation mediated by innate
  immune cells, which promote local oxidative stress with the covalent modification
  of self-proteins. (5) The oxidative environment promotes the generation of α-synuclein
  inclusions, which impair vesicular secretion by neurons of the enteric nervous system
  and thereby reduction in dopamine levels. (6) In addition, α-synuclein inclusions
  are captured by mucosal APCs and presented to naïve CD4+ T-cells specific for Lewy
  bodies derived antigens. Moreover, α-synuclein inclusions stimulates TLRs in macrophages
  and dendritic cells, triggering thus inflammation, oxidative stress and thereby
  further generation of α-synuclein inclusions, which constitutes a vicious cycle
  of chronic inflammation and generation of Lewy bodies. (7) According to Braak's
  hypothesis, after a long period of time (years) with chronic inflammation, Lewy
  bodies generated in the enteric nervous system would be transported by retrograde
  movement through vagus nerve until reaching the brain stem. (8) Lewy bodies in the
  brain would stimulate TLRs in microglial cells inducing the production of inflammatory
  cytokines and thus favouring the permeabilization of the BBB. (9) Inflammatory cytokines
  coming from peripheral blood circulation would also contribute to BBB permeabilization.
  In addition, a reduction in SCFAs (i.e., induced by a dysbiosis in gut microbiota)
  might alter GPR41-signalling in the BBB, thus promoting disassembling of tight junctions
  and further permeabilization of the BBB. (10) Inflammatory CD4+ T-cells (Th1 and
  Th17) generated years ago in response to Lewy bodies in the gut mucosa would migrate
  through the blood and infiltrate the brain (red arrow; this is the main hypothesis
  raised here). (11) Microglial cells would capture Lewy bodies and subsequently they
  would present Lewy bodies-derived antigens to Th1 and Th17 infiltrating the brain.
  Thus, microglial cells would restimulate Lewy body-specific CD4+ T-cells promoting
  further neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the
  nigrostriatal pathway.
