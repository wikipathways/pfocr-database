caption: 'In response to injury, there are significant and dynamic changes to the
  OGlcNAc sub-proteome. As increasing O-GlcNAc levels promotes survival, and as decreasing
  OGlcNAc levels promotes apoptosis and necrosis, stress-induced changes in O-GlcNAcylation
  are thought to reprogram cellular pathways promoting survival. Stress-induced changes
  in the OGlcNAc modification correlate with increased expression, activity and substrate
  targeting of OGT (yellow) and decreased expression and activity of OGA (blue), as
  well as increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. One mechanism
  supporting metabolic remodeling is increased expression of GFAT, the rate-limiting
  enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which is mediated by the transcription
  factor Xbp1s. O-GlcNAc has been demonstrated to activate proteins/pathways (green)
  leading to cell survival (for example, heat shock protein expression) and to inhibit
  proteins (red) that promote cell death (for example, CHOP activation), collectively
  increasing cellular protection. For some pathways, the molecular mechanism by which
  O-GlcNAc mediates survival/inhibition are unknown (dashed lines), whereas for others
  the O-GlcNAcylated proteins and sites have been identified (solid lines). Nonetheless,
  additional work is required to fully delineate how O-GlcNAc promotes a pro-survival
  phenotype. Abbreviations used in this figure: G6PD, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
