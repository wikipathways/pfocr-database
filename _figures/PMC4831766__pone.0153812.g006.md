caption: '(A) wBm require pyruvate for intracellular glucose and energy production.
  Parasite glycolytic enzymes (GE) are clustered to the bacterial surface in a complex
  with wBm00432, which can support the conversion of the intracellular glucose into
  pyruvate. Pyruvate is then utilized by the bacteria either for energy production
  or gluconeogenesis. (B) Bacteria change the expression of host genes that are involved
  in the glycogen metabolic pathway. A decline in bacterial fitness due to antibiotic
  treatment increases glucose levels and decreases utilization of glycogen, resulting
  in an increase in glycogen stores as well. Abbreviations: TCA: tricarboxylic acid
  cycle, GS: glycogen synthase, GP: glycogen phosphorylase, GSK-3: glycogen synthase
  phosphatase-3, HK: hexokinase, G-6-P: glucose-6-phosphate.'
