caption: a In OSCC, inhibition of p53 leads to overexpression of PRC1, which in turn
  further suppresses p53. The EGFR signaling pathway is enhanced by overexpressed
  PRC1, subsequently leading to the promotion of proliferation. b After PRC1 knockdown
  in OSCC, p53 is upregulated which causes additional inhibition of PRC1 as feedback,
  which consequently suppresses the EGFR pathway and inhibits proliferation
