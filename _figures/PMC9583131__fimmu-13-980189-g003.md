caption: 'The dual demeanor of Serotonin. (A) Anti-Inflammatory: The gut microbiota
  enter the Trp into Ahr and Kyn pathways and the 5-HT synthesis process. Initially,
  SSRIs inhibit 5-HT reabsorption in platelets and myenteric nerves and boost mucosal
  serotonin content, initiating anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Proliferation and resistance
  to ROS arise in the epithelium via the 5-HT4 receptor. 5-HT reduces TNF-α production
  by monocytes and macrophages (1) directly through their 5-HT4 and 5-HT7 receptors
  and (2) indirectly via the 5-HT4 receptor on the myenteric nerve, which is accompanied
  by releasing Ach that eventually comes up with IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-α decrement.
  Similar changes in TNF-α fabrication occur via B-cell, T-cell, and NK cell 5-HT2
  receptors. Additionally, 5-HT7 on the DC turns down the IL-6 and IL-1ß and elevates
  IL-10. (B) Pro-inflammatory: Over time, SSRI dosage augmentation affects, directly
  and indirectly, the gut microbiota composition, and disrupts Ahr and Kyn pathways.
  Pathogens’ toxins pass the leaky epithelium created by dysbiosis and stimulate the
  gut toward inflammation. Moreover, the inhibition of 5-HT reabsorption is amplified,
  resulting in much more serotonin levels. This primes pro-inflammatory mechanisms,
  which are known as the endocrine-immune axis. Macrophage phagocytosis is reinforced,
  and through the 5-HT2 receptor, they release IL-2 that activates T-cells. In addition,
  by acting on DC, 5-HT activates T-cells and increases IL-17, IL-12, and IFN-γ via
  the NF-κB pathway. Monocyte 5-HT1A receptor provocation reduces the inhibitory effect
  on NK-Cell to increase IFN-γ production. On the other hand, the impacts on 5-HT3,
  5-HT4, and 5-HT7 monocyte receptors increase IL-6, IL-8, and INF-1ß. Also, B-Cell
  proliferates and activates through 5-HT1A receptor instigation. The serotonin amount
  can boost neutrophil, basophil, and mast cell chemo-toxicity. This process is turned
  into a destructive cycle since increased T-cells (CD4+ types) initiate the immune-endocrine
  axis (EC cells proliferation and boosting the serotonin content). Eventually, the
  destructive cycle exacerbates the inflammation.'
