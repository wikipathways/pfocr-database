caption: Proposed pathway of cytotoxicity in renal tubular epithelial cells exposed
  to septic serum. Exposure of renal tubular epithelial cells to septic serum results
  in induction of iNOS and an initial fall in mitochondrial membrane potential. This
  is followed by mitochondrial superoxide generation and the formation of peroxynitrite,
  which act to sustain mitochondrial dysfunction (dashed arrows), leading to ATP depletion
  and cell death. By scavenging superoxide and peroxynitrite, MnTmPyP is able to break
  the cycle of mitochondrial injury and protect the renal epithelium.
