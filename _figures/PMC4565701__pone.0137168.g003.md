caption: Flow of substrates and products is indicated by arrows and enzymes catalyze
  the reaction are labeled beside arrows. Heat maps of the genes encoding the enzymes
  are placed beside the enzymes. Each grid indicates a sampled period. The first four
  grids indicate superior grains of 10DAF, 15DAF, 21DAF, 27DAF, and the last four
  grids indicate inferior grains of 10DAF, 15DAF, 21DAF, 27DAF. Expression of genes
  (in TPM) was subjected to log2 conversion. With those zero expression genes, zero
  was converted with 0.01(in TPM).
