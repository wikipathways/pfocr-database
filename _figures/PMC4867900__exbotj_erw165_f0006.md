caption: 'Life without complex I. The figure is based on altered protein levels in
  ca1ca2 plants relative to wildtype plants as obtained by label-free quantitative
  shotgun proteomics. Green arrows within the grey boxes indicate increased protein
  levels in the double-mutant, and red arrows indicate decreased levels. Absence of
  complex I causes reorganization of the cellular respiration system. Since electron
  insertion into the first segment of the mETC is not possible, increased electron
  insertion at later segments takes place (induction of complexes II, IV). This requires
  increased oxidation of organic substrates (induction of enzymes of glycolysis, the
  TCA cycle, and amino acid catabolism). Mitochondrial ATP formation most likely is
  still reduced, which requires increased fermentation. The growth rate of the double-mutant
  is drastically reduced. This is reflected by reduced amounts of the two photosystems,
  Calvin cycle enzymes, and enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore,
  altered metabolism and electron transport pathways in the mitochondria and chloroplasts
  cause increased ROS formation and stress symptoms. Several components of the ROS
  and stress defense system are induced in the double-mutant, as is the alternative
  oxidase, a well-known stress indicator in plants. Note: causal events indicated
  by black arrows do not necessarily indicate primary effects, but may well represent
  indirect consequences. For further details see the discussion section.'
