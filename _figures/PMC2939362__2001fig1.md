caption: Domain organization of proteins in the Hh signaling pathway. Domains for
  which high-resolution structures have been determined are shown in color, and those
  that are positive or negative regulators of Hh pathway activity are indicated by
  (+) or (−), respectively. (Ig) Immunoglobulin; (Fz) Frizzled-like cysteine-rich
  domain; (EGF) epidermal growth factor; (GFR) glial-derived neurotrophic factor family
  receptor; (HS) heparan sulfate; (GPI) glycosylphosphatidylinositol.
