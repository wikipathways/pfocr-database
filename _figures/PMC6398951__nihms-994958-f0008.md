caption: (A) At baseline, CTR iHTNs (left) show baseline levels of orexigenic (pCREB
  and pFoxO1) and anorexigenic pathway proteins (Jak2 and STAT3) and a baseline response
  to added hormones to maintain a balance between food intake (NPY) and energy expenditure
  (α-MSH). At baseline, OBS iHTNs (right) show an imbalance in food intake versus
  energy expenditure in that there is an activation of the orexigenic pathway while
  the anorexigenic pathway is not equally active.(B) Upon treatment of relevant hormones
  such as ghrelin (orexigenic) and leptin (anorexigenic), the CTR iHTNs (left) maintain
  their balance between food intake and energy expenditure. Interestingly, OBS iHTNs
  (right) show a further imbalance in that there is a further increase in orexigenic
  signals upon ghrelin treatment, but leptin does not elicit an equally effective
  anorexigenic response. As a result, OBS iHTNs show exacerbated orexigenic signals
  as well as possible resistance to leptin.
