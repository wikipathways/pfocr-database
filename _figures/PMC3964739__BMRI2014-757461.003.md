caption: Estradiol availability affects the regulation of enzymes involved in tricarboxylic
  acid cycle activity. E2 enhances the glycolytic/pyruvate/acetyl-CoA pathway to generate
  electrons required for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation to sustain utilization
  of glucose as the primary fuel source.
