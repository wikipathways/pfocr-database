caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of transcription initiation. In unbranched mechanism
  1, abortive synthesis is proposed to occur on the pathway to promoter escape. Branched
  mechanism 2 proposes two classes of initiating complexes: productive complexes (subscripted
  P) that escape from the promoter without releasing any short RNA, and nonproductive
  (abortive) complexes (subscripted NP) that cannot escape and only synthesize and
  release short RNA. CC, closed complex; EC, escaped (elongation) complex; ITC, initial
  transcribing complex; OC, open complex; R, RNAP.'
