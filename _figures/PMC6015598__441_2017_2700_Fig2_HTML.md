caption: Dysfunctional cellular mechanisms in PD. Convergent molecular mechanisms
  in protein homeostasis, intracellular trafficking, the autophagic/lysosomal pathway
  and calcium signaling in Parkinson’s. Aggregation of misfolded αSyn is responsible
  for ER stress and failure of autophagic pathways and sequestration of Hsc70 into
  the lysosome. Impairment of macroautophagy machinery is attributable to mutations
  in SNCA, Atg7, ATP13A2 and LRRK2. Association of αSyn transcription factor TFEB
  blocks TFEB translocation into the nucleus, hence impairing the expression of autophagy/lysosome-related
  genes. αSyn aggregates inhibit ER-Golgi vesicular transport by interaction with
  Rab1a and impair endosomal transport and fusion with lysosome by disrupting Rab7
  function. PD-related mutations in DNAJC13, DNAJC6 and GAK induce perturbation in
  endosomal trafficking and disrupt clathrin mediated endocytocis. Parkinson’s-associated
  mutations lead to Ca2+ mishandling and Ca2+ dyshomeostasis through alteration of
  ER-mitochondrial tethering, reducing Ca2+ transport between organelles and a failure
  of intracellular buffering mechanisms. Sustained Cav channel opening underlies low
  intrinsic buffering capacity dopaminergic neurons leading to elevated Ca2+ influx
