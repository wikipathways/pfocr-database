caption: Resistance to BRAF inhibitors can occur through stromal extracellular signals
  (blue) leading to ERK reactivation upstream of MEK (orange) or to enhanced survival
  signaling(green). Pathway re-activation occurs through either activating NRAS mutations
  (*), loss of the RAS suppressor NF1, BRAF amplification or alternative splicing
  leading to BRAF truncations, overexpression or mutation of the MEK activators CRAF,
  MLK or COT/TPL2/MAP3K8 as well as MEK mutations (*). Enhanced survival signaling
  is brought about by the PI3K pathway [mutations in PI3K or AKT (*)] or for instance
  by over-expressed MITF. Stromal derived signals can emanate from fibroblasts or
  macrophages; thereby macrophages can release factors that directly act on melanoma
  cells or factors that activate fibroblasts.
