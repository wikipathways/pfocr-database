caption: Ehrlichia enters the cell via Caveolae (in blue)-mediated endocytosis. Initial
  entry is characterized by an infectious dense core which later differentiates to
  a replicative reticulate form. Bacteria can exit from the cell by host cell lysis
  or exocytosis. Host immune recognition is mediated by TLR2 on the cell surface,
  or TLR7/TLR9 within the endosome, leading to MyD88 pathway activation. NOD2 may
  also sense Ehrlichia within the cytoplasm. The phylogenetically related organism
  A. phagocytophilum induces a PRR activation signature like Ehrlichia, for innate
  recognition by TLR2 and NOD2. Together, TLR and NOD2 recognition can activate the
  transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
