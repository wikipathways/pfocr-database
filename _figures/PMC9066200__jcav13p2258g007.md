caption: Schematic diagram of the β2-AR-PlexinA1-JAK/STAT3 pathway. The schematic
  diagram summarizes the results of this study. Our research showed that chronic stress-related
  hormones are related to the occurrence of EMT in gastric cancer. According to our
  observations, chronic stress then triggers the HPA (hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal)
  axis to promote the release of catecholamine hormones. These β2-AR agonists not
  only recognize β2-AR but also activate the transmembrane protein PlexinA1. β2-AR
  interacts with PlexinA1 and subsequently promotes the downstream JAK-STAT3 signaling
  pathway. The JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway mediates the phenotypic transition of gastric
  cancer cells to EMT and subsequently stimulates the undesirable progression of human
  gastric cancer.
