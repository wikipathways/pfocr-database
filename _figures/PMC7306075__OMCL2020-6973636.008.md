caption: A schematic showing the proposed mechanism of dichloroacetate- and atorvastatin-related
  phenotype regulation. DCA inconsiderably increased apoptosis and oxidative stress
  and decreased proliferation and ΔΨm (MMP) in a p38 activation-dependent manner.
  By contrast, ATO markedly upregulated the p38 signal pathway and oxidative stress,
  resulting in profound apoptosis. Slightly reduced proliferation and MMP when DCA
  and ATO combination treatment could achieve more therapeutic targets and only cause
  moderate ROS damage.
