caption: 'Schematic illustration of CaSR maturation through the secretory pathway.
  Results from this report (bold) and a previous study () allow sorting of CaSR loss-of-function
  mutants into class Ia, which traffic to the Golgi and class Ib, which are not able
  to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. Class II mutants reach the plasma membrane and
  can also be divided into two categories: class IIa mutants exhibit some activity
  that can be enhanced by rescue with NPS R-568, whereas class IIb mutants are not
  able to activate signaling despite enhanced plasma membrane localization.'
