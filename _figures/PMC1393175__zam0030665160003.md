caption: Transcriptional response of frc and oxc to pH 5.5, pH 4.5, and 1% (70 mM)
  ammonium oxalate (pH 6.8) in MRS broth after 30 min. The solid rectangles indicate
  另wofold-higher expression, the cross-hatched rectangles indicate a 另wofold reduction
  in expression (P < 0.05), and the open rectangles indicate values of gene expression
  that are not statistically different from values obtained under the control conditions
  (L. acidophilus incubated in fresh MRS broth for 30 min). Plus and minus signs indicate
  that the experiment was carried out in the presence and in the absence of oxalate,
  respectively. The proposed metabolic pathway of oxalate decarboxylation by L. acidophilus
  is also shown. The structures of the compounds were obtained from the website http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg2.html.
