caption: Mechanisms of oxysterol action in viral infections. Oxysterols have broad
  antiviral activities across both non-enveloped viruses (left) and enveloped viruses
  (right). Among non-enveloped viruses, (a) 25-OHC inhibits the absorption of Seneca
  valley virus in BHK-21 cells without affecting the other stages of the viral replication
  cycle. (b) 25-OHC regulates endosomal dynamics in reovirus infection by reducing
  the co-localization of viral particles with Rab7 in HeLa cells. (c) In poliovirus
  pseudovirus-infected HEK293 cells, 25-OHC reduces viral replication by interacting
  with OSBP to reduce PI4P accumulation on poliovirus-induced membranes. (d) In rotavirus-infected
  MA104 cells, 25-OHC and 27-OHC interact with OSBP to prevent its subsequent interaction
  with VAP-A. This results in reduced cholesterol recycling between the ER and late
  endosomes, thereby sequestering viral particles within late endosomes and preventing
  cytosolic entry and replication. Among enveloped viruses, (e) the oxysterols 25-OHC,
  27-OHC, 22(S)-OHC, 20α-OHC, and 7β-OHC prevent viral entry across a broad range
  of viruses, some through mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. 25-OHC has been
  shown to co-localize within the plasma membrane, affecting membrane properties and
  preventing viral entry. (f) In HSV-1-infected, cells, 25-OHC and 27-OHC regulate
  the inflammatory response by inducing NF-κB activation, promoting the upregulation
  of inflammatory genes involved in antiviral control. (g) In MCMV-infected BMDMs,
  25-OHC activates the integrated stress response pathway for its antiviral functions.
  (h) In SARS-CoV-2-infected HEK293-hACE2 and VeroE6 cells, 27-OHC and 25-OHC induce
  cholesterol remodeling on the plasma membrane, preventing viral entry. (i) Additionally,
  25-OHC is also able to localize within late endosomes, where it inhibits cholesterol
  export, preventing SARS-CoV-2-mediated membrane fusion for cytosolic entry. (j)
  In SARS-CoV-2 and HCV infections, oxy210 displayed antiviral activities by limiting
  the viral-induced DMV-dependent replication. (k) 25-OHC affects glycoprotein glycosylation
  and the production of infectious virions in LASV-infected huh-7 cells. (l) In ZIKV-infected
  cells, 7-KC prevents viral budding from host cells, decreasing the viral progeny
  production.
