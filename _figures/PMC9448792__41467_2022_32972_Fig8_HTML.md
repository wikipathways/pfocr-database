caption: 'GR expression is increased in the diabetic proximal tubule. Cortisol binds
  GR and translocates to the nucleus where it localizes to glucocorticoid response
  elements (GRE) in genes like FKBP5. Decreased chromatin accessibility of GRE in
  the FKBP5 gene body is observed as reduced accessibility of proximal-tubule-specific
  ATAC peaks in DKD (red triangles). Reduced accessibility of FKBP5 GRE leads to reduced
  transactivation by GR and reduced FKBP5 expression. Reduced FKBP5 expression decreases
  activity of the GR negative feedback loop. In the absence of FKBP5 negative feedback,
  GR can exert both DNA-binding-dependent and DNA-binding-independent actions that
  lead to adverse metabolic effects, anti-inflammatory effects, and increased gluconeogenesis.
  GR hallmark pathway genes that are differentially expressed in our study include:
  CDKN1A, CREBBP, EGR1, FKBP5, FOS, HSP90AA1, ICAM1, JUN, MAPK10, NCOA2, NFKB1, NR3C1,
  NR4A1, PBX1, PCK2, PRKACB, SGK1, SMARCA4, STAT1, STAT5A, STAT5B.'
