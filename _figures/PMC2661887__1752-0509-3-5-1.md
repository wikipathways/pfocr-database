caption: Process diagram of the biosynthesis of valine and leucine in C. glutamicum.
  The pathway shown here is constructed using the information from both the KEGG and
  the METACYC databases. Metabolites outside the cell are not directly included in
  the model system. As 2-ketoisovalerate (KIV) is the starting point for both products,
  its production and degradation are highly regulated. For this purpose four feedback
  inhibitions control the reactions linked to this intermediate. Val and Leu can be
  transported out of the cell when not needed thereby competing for a free binding
  site in the transporting enzyme. Note that enzymes are omitted from this process
  diagram for the sake of a clear arrangement of the participating species.
