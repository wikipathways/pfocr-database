caption: 'Generalized schematic representation of the BMP signaling pathway. Type
  I and type II BMP receptors span the cell membrane and bind extracellular BMP ligand.
  Ligand binding to BMP heterotetrameric receptor complexes activates signaling through
  type II-receptor-mediated phosphorylation of the type I receptor on the GS domain.
  Type I receptor phosphorylation is accompanied by decreased binding to the GS domain
  of proteins that prevent receptor signaling in the absence of ligand binding. Activated
  type I receptors phosphorylate cytoplasmic signal transduction proteins such as
  R-SMADs and MAPKs (including JNK, ERK and p38), which, in turn, directly or indirectly
  regulate the transcription of target genes in the nucleus. Abbreviations: BMP, bone
  morphogenetic protein; BMPR, bone morphogenetic protein receptor; Co-SMAD, common-mediator
  SMAD; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GS domain, glycine–serine domain;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; R-SMAD, receptor-regulated
  SMAD.'
