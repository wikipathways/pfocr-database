caption: Cancer-mediated hypercoagulability occurs as a consequence of direct activation
  of procoagulant pathways by cancer cells [mediated by aberrant expression of tissue
  factor (tf) by tumour cells; release of tumour cell–derived,tf-expressing microparticles;
  and cancer procoagulant and other cell-surface proteases] or of indirect systemic
  effects of cancer on a variety of cell types, including leucocytes, endothelial
  cells, and platelets. In various malignancies, neutrophils are “primed” to release
  their contents in the form of neutrophil extracellular traps, resulting in direct
  activation of procoagulant pathways, platelet activation, and inhibition of naturally
  occurring anticoagulant pathways, including tf pathway inhibitor. As a consequence
  of these various direct and indirect mechanisms, patients with cancer have an elevated
  risk of venous thromboembolism.
