caption: In the absence of Wnt stimulation, the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) forms
  a trimeric complex, known as the “destruction complex,” with glycogen synthase kinase-3β
  (GSK) and Axin. This complex then interacts with β-catenin and degrades by the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. When Wnt ligands bind to the seven-transmembrane receptor, the cytoplasmic
  protein Dishevelled (Dsh) is recruited to the membrane and binds to Axin1 and Axin2.
  The mechanism of Dsh-mediated inhibition of Axin is not well understood, but it
  has been suggested that Dsh might disrupt the destruction complex. Inhibition of
  Axin results in accumulation of β-catenin, which subsequently translocates into
  the nucleus. β-catenin interacts with LEF/TCF (lymphocyte enhancer factor/T cell
  factor) proteins and serves as a coactivator of LEF/TCFs to stimulate transcription
  of Wnt target gene. Grouch protein (Gro) acts as corepressor of LEF/TCFs and normally
  binds to LEF/TCFs in the absence of β-catenin. New therapeutic treatments aimed
  at this pathway include monoclonal antibodies, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors,
  and several small molecules.
