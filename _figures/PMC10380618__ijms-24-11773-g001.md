caption: Simplified scheme of interconnections between storage lipid and protein breakdown
  in germinating lupin seeds. During lipid breakdown, fatty acids released by lipases
  from triacylglycerols (TAG) deposited in lipid droplets are oxidized in the peroxisome
  through β-oxidation. The next step of lipid breakdown involves the glyoxylate cycle,
  which operates partially in the peroxisome (also known as the glyoxysome) and the
  cytoplasm. The final product of lipid mobilization is sucrose, which is one of the
  most important carbon transport forms, and it can also be used as a respiratory
  substrate. However, in germinating lupin seeds, the main respiratory substrates
  are amino acids. With the intense amino acid interconversions in tissues of lupin
  germinating seeds, toxic ammonia is generated, and to maintain a low level of this
  byproduct, asparagine is synthesized in high amounts to utilize ammonia. Some metabolites
  of the glyoxylate cycle are subtracted from the typical pathway of lipid breakdown
  and can be used as respiratory substrates as well or be involved in amino acid metabolism.
  It was evidenced that in germinating lupine seeds, a pool of lipid-derived carbon
  skeletons is directed for amino acid synthesis, and glutamate and asparagine are
  among the main targets of carbon flow from lipid to amino acids. Based on data from
  the literature [,,,,,]. ACOX Acyl-CoA oxidase, AS asparagine synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing),
