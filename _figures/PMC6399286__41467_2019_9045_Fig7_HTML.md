caption: Schematic model of purinergic signalling from L-cells to local targets. ATP
  released together with GLP-1 and PYY from L-cells, exemplified here by angiotensin
  receptor stimulation, can activate purinergic receptors located on neighbouring
  enterocytes, potentially modulating fluid secretion by opening of Ca2+-sensitive
  K+ channels. ATP released from L-cells also targets local nerve terminals of vagal
  afferent neurons deriving from the nodose ganglion (brown cell) which express purinergic
  P2X3 receptors, providing ATP neurotransmitter mediated signalling pathway from
  the intestinal epithelium to the brainstem

  modulate intestinal enterocytes and afferent neurons.
