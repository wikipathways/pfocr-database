caption: 'Metabolic alterations due to fosmidomycin (FOS) treatment predicted by genome-scale
  metabolic model simulations. FOS treatment causes an inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis,
  leading to a reduction in heme detoxification. The simulations suggest that the
  parasite enhances redox metabolism to counter increased oxidative stress, a consequence
  of reduced heme detoxification (). Specifically, the parasite increased the flow
  of metabolites through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), reducing metabolic fluxes
  involved in the synthesis of pyrimidine metabolites and acetyl-CoA. In addition,
  the parasite increased flux through polyamine metabolism to generate the purine
  nucleotides ATP and GTP. This increased flux also activated a eukaryotic initiation
  factor, eiF5A, via spermidine (sprm) and hypusine (). The simulations also predicted
  inhibition of the methyl-group cycle, reducing lipid synthesis under FOS treatment
  (). Abbreviations: akg, alpha-ketoglutarate; asp, aspartate; cit, citrate; dxp,
