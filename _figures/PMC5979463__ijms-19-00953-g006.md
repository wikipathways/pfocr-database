caption: Schematic diagram of the protective response of quetiapine. UVB irradiation
  can change the expression levels of SOD, GSH-Px and MDA, as well as potentially
  being regulated through the p38 MAPK signal pathway, and may then cause a range
  of damage (inflammation injury, apoptosis and so on). The protective mechanism of
  quetiapine may be regulated by the same pathway, as well.
