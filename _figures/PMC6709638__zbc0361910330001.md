caption: Selenium metabolic pathways in E. coli and S. cerevisiae that lead to free
  Sec. Pathways specific for S. cerevisiae and E. coli are shown in red and blue,
  respectively. 1, in S. cerevisiae, SeMet is imported through amino acid permeases
  (), whereas selenite is taken up through phosphate transporters and a monocarboxylate
  transporter (, ). 2, SeMet enters the Met metabolic cycle and is converted to Se-adenosylmethionine
  (SeAM) by SAM synthase (). 3, the Met salvage pathway converts Se-adenosylmethionine
  back to SeMet. Se-adenosylmethionine is also a substrate of methyltransferases,
  which release Se-adenosylhomocysteine (SeAH) as a product of methylation reactions.
  Se-adenosylhomocysteine is hydrolyzed to selenohomocysteine (SeHCys) by S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine
  hydrolase. Selenohomocysteines can be methylated back to SeMet by Met synthase ().
  4, enzymes of the trans-sulfuration pathway convert selenohomocysteine to Sec ().
  Cystathionine synthases and cystathionine lyases interconvert selenohomocysteine
  and selenocystathionine (SeCyst). Selenium from selenite can also replace sulfur
  in the trans-sulfuration pathway. 5, reduction of selenite to selenide occurs nonenzymatically
  and involves GSH and other organic selenium intermediates (). 6, selenide reacts
  with O-acetylhomoserine in yeast to form selenohomocysteine. In E. coli, selenide
  can react with SAM to produce methylselenol (MSe) () (7), or it can be a substrate
  of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylases AB (cysM and cysK) for the production of free Sec
  (, ) (8). 9, because methionyl-tRNA synthetase and CysRS cannot discriminate between
  sulfur- and selenium-containing amino acids, SeMet and Sec are ligated onto tRNA
  and misincorporated at Met and Cys codons, respectively, during protein synthesis
  (figure was adapted from Ref. ).
