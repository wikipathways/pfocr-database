caption: The protective effect of H2S on vascular endothelial cells in type II diabetes
  model. HG and palmitate induces an increase in ROS production in vascular endothelial
  cells. Increased ROS leads to extremes oxidative stress which impairs ATP production.
  This alteration results in excessive autophagy, which finally induces cell death.
  Exogenous H2S attenuates ROS production through the Nrf2-ROS-AMPK pathway. Through
  attenuating ROS production, H2S inhibits this pathway, which reduces excessive autophagy.
  This effect of H2S can maintain the homeostasis of vascular endothelial cells and
  increase cell survival
