caption: 'Gene interaction pathway. Network visualization for interaction of the 93
  candidate genes and regulatory factors observed from the QTL results using Cytoscape_V2.6.3
  software. Genes are presented as nodes and gene interactions are presented as edges.
  (a) The five regulatory factors and genes that are directly affected by only one
  regulatory factor: the five regulatory factors indicated by round rectangle with
  different color (yellow, LEC2; pink, LEC1; green, FUS3; light blue, ABI3; red, WRI1),
  while the genes are depicted as hexagon with the same color of the regulatory factors
  which linked to them. (b) The genes affected by two or more regulatory factors,
  denoting as diamond-shaped nodes, and the two diamond-shaped nodes with light blue
  color are LFY and SEP2, separately. (c) The genes indirectly affected by regulatory
  factors. In the middle of the cluster are three very important genes in fatty acid
  synthesis denoted as rectangle nodes with different color (pink, FAD2; green, FAE1;
  light yellow, FATB), and other genes are depicted as ellipse pink-filled nodes.'
