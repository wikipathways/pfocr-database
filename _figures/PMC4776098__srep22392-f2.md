caption: (a) Using the NSR/rod PPC network pathway to highlight target interactions,
  downstream signaling cascades initiated via binding of candidate chemotactic factor
  SDF-1α to its CXCR4 receptor is shown to involve the canonical JAK-STAT pathway,
  which increases rates of migratory signaling molecule transcription. Freshly isolated
  P4 rod PPC CXCR4 expression is down-regulated (green with bold outline) relative
  to other cells in the light-damaged retina and migration activation is supported
  as a canonical function. (b) With downstream signaling following CXCR4 up-regulation
  (red) via ligand exposure, migratory signaling activation emerges with expression
  levels comparable to other migratory cell types in IPAs database. Enhanced activation
  is observed between CXCR4 and JAK-STAT (orange arrow) as well as with MIF activation
  of CXCR4. Further downstream signaling events reveal the involvement of hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) and nuclear factor-kb (NFKB1A) in regulating transcription
  of the CXCL12-CXCR4 pair which increase chemotaxis in damaged neural tissue.
