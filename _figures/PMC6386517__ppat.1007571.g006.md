caption: (A) RpiA is required to generate ribulose-5-phosphate, a substrate that could
  be converted into fructose 6-phosphate (Fructose-6P) in the non-oxidative phase
  of the pentose phosphate pathway. (B) GlnA generates glutamine from glutamate and
  ammonia. (C) Cellular fructose-6P and glutamine converge in the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway to ultimately generate UDP-GlcNAc, which is used by EpaX to synthesize an
  enterococcal polyGlcNAc-containing polymer, which could be a decoration of the rhamnopolysaccharide
  EPA (D) or a yet unknown polymer (E). These polyGlcNAc-containing polysaccharides
  are extracellularly localized (F) and promote the movement and penetration of E.
  faecalis into semisolid surfaces (G) or through human epithelial cell monolayers
  (H). In the absence of a functional RpiA or GlnA, the levels of UDP-GlcNAc are not
  sufficient to promote polysaccharide synthesis, thus blocking efficient surface
  penetration and/or translocation.
