caption: Schematic overview of TGF-β signaling. The components of Smad and non-Smad
  pathways are shown, as well as the latent TGF-β complex and the extracellular antagonists,
  Follistatin (bound to Activin) and Noggin (bound to BMP). Ligand occupancy induces
  phosphorylation of the type II receptors (RII), which in turn activates type I receptors
  (RI). (A) Smad-dependent signaling mediated by TGF-β, Activin and/or Nodal and BMP,
  as well as the corresponding Smad proteins and their inhibition by the inhibitory
  (I)-Smads, Smad6 or Smad7. Note that TGF-β also activates BMP receptor-regulated
  (R)-Smads in certain contexts. The nuclear Smad complexes that regulate gene expression
  in concert with other transcription factors (TFs) most likely contain two R-Smad
  (identical or different) subunits and one co-Smad. (B) In TGF-β-associated non-Smad
  signaling, TGF-β RII and RI receptors signal through TRAF6 and TAK1 to activate
  the JNK, p38 and inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) kinase (IKK) pathways, and through ShcA
  to activate the ERK pathway. TRAF6 also promotes cleavage of RI by TACE; the cleaved
  intracelluar domain (ICD) of RI then associates with transcription factors to activate
  gene expression. The TGF-β type II receptor can directly phosphorylate PAR6 through
  recruitment by Smurf1 and target RhoA for degradation, which leads to the dissociation
  of tight junctions. (C) In BMP-associated non-Smad signaling, BMP type II receptors
  bind and activate LIMK1 to inhibit the actin-disassembling factor cofilin. Figure
