caption: EGFR family members regulate autophagy affecting cancer cell survival and
  death. EGF receptor family members interact with key proteins in the autophagic
  pathway, leading to both cell survival and cell death dependent on the context.
  This includes activation of the mTOR pathway, leading to inhibition of the ULK1
  complex, the binding of EGFR family members to beclin-1, and EGFR binding to LAPTM4B,
  releasing beclin-1 from Rubicon. The context of these interactions determines the
  level of autophagy, which is often dysregulated in cancer.
