caption: LAT in the TCR pathway enhances signal transduction by sequestering inhibitory
  factors through a LLPS mechanism. Upon antigen activation, the T-cell receptor (TCR)
  promotes the phosphorylation of LAT protein, mediated by its interaction with Grb2
  and SOS proteins. This activation triggers the Ras signaling pathway and recruits
  PLC-γ1, ultimately enhancing cytokine production and calcium release from T-cell
  stores. Inhibition of LAT phosphorylation by the phosphatase CD45 results in the
  suppression of downstream signaling events. To ensure effective signal propagation,
  LAT forms clusters via the LLPS mechanism with its cooperative proteins, selectively
  enriching ZAP-70 while excluding a portion of CD45, effectively isolating the inhibitors
  of the reaction. Consequently, this creates a microenvironment that preserves a
  sustained phosphorylation state, promoting prolonged signaling and the release of
  calcium (Ca²+) ions following TCR activation. This figure is drawn by Figfraw(www.figdraw.com)
