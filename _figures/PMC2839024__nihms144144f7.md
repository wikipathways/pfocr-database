caption: Proposed mechanism of IGF-I signal transduction in myoblasts. Signaling through
  IGF-IR recruits adaptor molecules including IRS-1 to IGF-IR. This promotes binding
  of PI3K and generation of 3′ lipid phosphoinositides that recruit other molecules,
  including Akt, to the membrane, ultimately resulting in their activation. PI3K p110α
  catalytic subunit is required for Akt activation, but p110β is not. A second pathway
  includes a non-catalytic action of p110β that is associated with IGF-IR internalization
  and is required for activation of ERK. ERK may then phosphorylate IRS-1 at Ser 636/639,
  inhibiting PI3K binding and promoting IRS-1 degradation, thus attenuating IGF-IR
  signals.
papertitle: PI3K p110α and p110β have differential effects on Akt activation and protection
  against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in myoblasts.
