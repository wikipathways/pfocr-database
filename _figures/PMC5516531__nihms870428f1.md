caption: Tumors were prospectively collected from 56 patients for ex-vivo functional
  assessment of the status of the HR pathway, using RAD51 foci analysis. Tumors were
  classified as HR deficient or proficient using this assay. A multi-faceted genomics
  approach, integrating whole-exome sequencing, analysis of germ-line mutations, copy
  number variation, gene expression, and methylation was then used to determine the
  underlying etiology of HRD.
