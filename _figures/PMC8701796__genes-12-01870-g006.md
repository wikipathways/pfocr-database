caption: The circRNA–miRNA–mRNA regulatory network for DECs and DEGs, associated with
  the signaling pathway ‘glutamatergic synapse’. The network was constructed using
  Cytoscape 3.8.2 software. The nodes are designated the mRNAs or circRNAs. Each line
  connecting the nodes indicates the interaction of the corresponding mRNAs and circRNAs
  with common miRNAs. Accordingly, a different number of lines connecting the nodes
  indicates a different number of miRNAs, for the interaction with which circRNAs
  and mRNAs compete. The cut-off for circRNA-expression changes was 1.50. Only those
  circRNAs whose Padj < 0.05 were selected for analysis.
