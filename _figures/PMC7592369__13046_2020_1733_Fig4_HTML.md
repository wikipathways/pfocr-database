caption: 'Role of HIF-α on fatty acids metabolism during cancer progression via epigenetic
  regulation. Two FAO enzymes, the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases MCAD and LCAD, are inhibited
  by the activated HIF-1α under hipoxia. LCAD and MCAD loss disturbs the process of
  FAO which leads to ROS alteration via TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle and separate
  LCAD loss inhibits PTEN pathway, which finally mediate resistance to tumor progression.
  HIF-1α loss-of-function may rescues the resistance and contributes to cancer progression.
