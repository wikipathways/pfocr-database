caption: Typhoid toxin’s mechanism of action involves its entry into the mitochondria,
  where it initiates the proinflammatory SASP by directly targeting mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA) and inducing damage to this essential genetic material. This mtDNA damage
  triggers a cascade of events, beginning with the disruption of mtDNA integrity,
  which subsequently leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and a disturbance in redox
  homeostasis. As a consequence of these perturbations, damaged mtDNA is released
  into the cytosol, activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. This activation,
  in turn, instigates the expression of proinflammatory components, ultimately contributing
  to the development of the proinflammatory SASP (Created with BioRender.com)
