caption: 'Animal cell cytokinesis. Top: schematic of the major events during cytokinesis
  in animal cells [gray: DNA; red: microtubules; adapted by permission from Springer
  Nature: ©(Fededa and Gerlich, )]. Bottom: summary of the main signaling events during
  cytokinesis in animal cells. (i) During mitotic metaphase, condensed chromosomes
  align at the metaphase plate. (ii) Bipolar attachment of chromosomes to spindle
  microtubules releases the spindle attachment checkpoint and activates the anaphase
  promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which degrades mitotic cyclin B and inactivates
  the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK1). CDK1 inactivation triggers reorganization
  of the mitotic spindle into an array of antiparallel microtubule bundles (the central
  spindle) between the separating chromosomes. Microtubule bundling is promoted by
  Aurora B (AurB), the centralspindlin complex (CSC) and microtubule-bundling protein
  required for cytokinesis 1 (PRC1). (iii) A cortical contractile ring assembles from
  long formin-nucleated actin filaments and bipolar filaments of the motor, myosin
  II, and constricts to cleave the daughter cells. Actomyosin ring assembly is initiated
  in response to a signaling pathway where Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and AurB phosphorylate
  the CSC, leading to activation of the Rho GDP-GTP exchange factor, Ect2, and its
  translocation to the cell cortex where it activates the RhoA GTPase. RhoA activates
  both myosin II (myo II) via the Rho kinase, ROCK, and formins which nucleate actin
  filaments (act fils), and recruits the scaffold protein anillin, resulting in the
  formation of actin and myosin filaments and subsequent assembly of the actomyosin
  ring. In addition to continued RhoA signaling, constriction of the actomyosin ring
  is influenced by changes in cortical tension, plasma membrane lipid composition
  at the site of furrow ingression, and by active force generation by the action of
  myosin motors (Emoto et al., ; Atilla-Gokcumen et al., ; Glotzer, ). (iv) The central
  spindle is compacted to form a microtubule-based midbody positioned in the center
  of a thin intercellular bridge that connects the daughter cells while the contractile
  ring is converted into a cortical midbody ring. (v) Endosomal trafficking of the
  Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) and FIP3-endosomes, together with the Endosomal
  Sorting Complex Required for Transport III (ESCRT-III) filament system, which recruits
  the microtubule severing enzyme, spastin (Spa), act to remodel the intercellular
  bridge and bring about abscission, the final topological separation of the two daughter
  cells (Connell et al., ; Carmena et al., ; D''Avino and Capalbo, ). Additional regulators
  of abscission include citron kinase (CK), which works together with AurB in the
  CPC to stabilize the midbody architecture (Watanabe et al., ; McKenzie et al., )
  and Plk1, which inhibits ESCRT-III recruitment to the midbody until late cytokinesis,
  when Plk1 is degraded (Bastos and Barr, ). Abscission is also regulated by tension
  on the intercellular bridge (Gould, ).'
