caption: After mispair recognition by Msh2-Msh6 (or Msh2-Msh3) and recruitment of
  Mlh1-Pms1, a repair can be initiated by several pathways. In the well-understood
  Exo1-dependent pathway, recruitment of Exo1 by Msh2-Msh6 and/or Mlh1-Pms1 allows
  for 5’–>3’ resection of the nicked strand past the mispair to generate a gap. In
  the Rad27-dependent pathway, strand-displacement synthesis from a nick by DNA polymerase
  δ and 5’ flap cleavage by Rad27 is coordinated by Msh2-Msh6, likely through shared
  interactions with PCNA. In both of these pathways, the nicks could be pre-existing
  or could be made by the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease. The less well-understood Exo1-independent
  and Rad27-independent pathways are hypersensitive to reduced activation of the Mlh1-Pms1
  endonuclease, suggesting a role for additional rounds of nicking by Mlh1-Pms1. Additional
  nicking could generate a gap, equivalent to the Exo1-dependent pathway, or small
  fragments that can readily be displaced by the strand-displacement synthesis in
  the absence of Rad27.
