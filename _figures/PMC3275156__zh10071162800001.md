caption: Simplified diagram of the classical corticosteroid synthetic pathway. Enzyme
  gene names are in italics and gray. StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein)
  is required for translocation of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial
  membrane, where CYP11A1 (P450 side-chain cleavage, or P450scc) catalyzes the conversion
  of cholesterol to pregnenolone. Further steroid conversions are performed by 3β-HSD
  (3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5–Δ4 isomerase), CYP17 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase,
  or P450c17), CYP21 (21-hydroxylase, or P450c21), CYP11B1 (11β-hydroxylase or P450c11β),
  CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase or P450c11AS), 11β-HSD types 1 and 2.
