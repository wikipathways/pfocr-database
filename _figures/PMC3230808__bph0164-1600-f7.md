caption: Diagram of the regulation of CYP1A1 by capsaicin in Hepa-1c1c7 cells. Capsaicin
  (CPS) alone weakly enhanced AhR activation. Additionally, capsaicin activates the
  TRPV1 receptor and then induces raised intracellular calcium and thus activates
  the PI3-kinase/Akt signalling pathway. PI3-kinase/Akt signalling induces C/EBPβ
  protein expression and activation. PAHs such as 3-MC and capsaicin bind to AhR and
  are then degraded by hsp90. The PAHs/AhR complex binds ARNT and this complex is
  then translocated to the nucleus. The translocated capsaicin or PAHs and AhR/ARNT
  complex binds to the XRE site and thus CYP1A1 expression is increased. C/EBPβ activated
  by capsaicin prevents the PAHs/AhR/ARNT complex from binding to the XRE. C/EBP,
  CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein; PAH, poly aryl hydrocarbon; TRPV1, transient receptor
  potential vanilloid type-1 receptor; 3-MC, 3-methylcholanthrene; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor; XRE, xenobiotic response element.
papertitle: CCAAT/ enhancer-binding protein β activation by capsaicin contributes
  to the regulation of CYP1A1 expression, mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
