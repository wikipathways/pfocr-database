caption: LLPS in cancer. a Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) can phase-separate with
  its substrates and cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase to form condensates, which promote
  the degradation of its substrates via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. SPOP consists
  of a substrate-binding meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) domain and two dimerization
  domains, BTB and BACK. The self-association by two dimerization domains and the
  multievent interactions between MATH domain and substrates are necessary for the
  phase separation of SPOP. Cancer-associated mutations in the MATH domain disrupt
  the formation of SPOP condensate by preventing the interaction between substrates
  and SPOP. b The transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional
  coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) can activate the transcription of various
  genes via LLPS. The Hippo signaling pathway can inhibit the formation of YAP/TAZ
  condensates. However, the Hippo signaling pathway is inactivated in many cancers.
  Therefore, the accumulation of TAZ and YAP can largely activate the transcription
  of proto-oncogenes via phase separation, promoting cell proliferation and anti-PD-1
  immunotherapy resistance via LLPS. The intrinsically disordered TA and CC domains
  are essential for the formation of YAP condensates, whereas the CC and WW domains
  are vital for TAZ phase separation
