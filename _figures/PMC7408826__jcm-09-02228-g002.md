caption: 'Molecular alterations that drive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)
  proliferation, survival and metastasis through aberrant signaling (highlighted in
  pink): (A) alterations in KNSTRN expression promote abnormal chromosome segregation
  during mitosis; (B) CDKN2A encodes for cell-cycle regulatory proteins p16INK4A and
  p14ARF, involved in retinoblastoma (RB) and p53 pathways. loss of heterozygosity
  (LOH), mutations or deletions of CDKN2A leads to functional loss of: (i) p16INK4A,
  which allows phosphorylation of RB by CDK4-Cyclin D complex and release of E2F transcription
  factors, that can then transcribe S phase promoting genes; (ii) p14ARF, which allows
  MDM-2 to bind p53 and inhibit apoptosis; (C) activating mutations in EGFR, RAS and
  RAF or inactivation of negative regulator RASA1 promotes cell proliferation and
  survival through constitutive activation of MAPK pathway; (D) proposed model for
  RIPK4 action in skin carcinogenesis that depicts the phosphorylation of PKP1 by
  RIPK4, which promotes binding to scaffold protein SHOC2 and blocking of RAS/MAPK
  signaling. In the absence of functional RIPK4, the complex cannot assemble and the
  signaling pathway remains active, thus facilitating cSCC development; (E) the inactive
  precursor is cleaved in the Golgi by a furin-like convertase (S1 cleavage) and translocated
  into the cell membrane, where binding of a NOTCH ligand (Delta, Jagged) to the receptor
  induces the second cleavage (S2) by a member of the disintegrin and metalloproteinases
  (ADAM) family. This results in the formation of a membrane-tethered NOTCH truncated
  fragment, which is further cleaved (S3) by a presenilin-dependent γ-secretase complex,
  generating the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD). The active form of the NOTCH receptor
  (NICD) can now enter into the nucleus, where it exerts its transcriptional activity.
  Inactivation of NOTCH 1/2 favors cSCC progression, however, the specific functional
  significance of this mutation has yet to be described; (F) the molecular mechanisms
  that contribute to tumor development in the context of FAT1 functional loss are
  poorly understood in cSCC, however, a model proposed for HNSCC suggests FAT1 acts
  as a scaffold for Hippo kinases, favoring the activation of the complex and the
  phosphorylation of YAP, which is sequestered in the cytoplasm or degraded. Absence
  of FAT1 dismantles the Hippo core complex leading to YAP dephosphorylation and its
  translocation to the nucleus, where it interacts with TEAD to induce the expression
  of genes promoting tumor progression (created in BioRender.com).'
