caption: Probability flux distributions for human red blood cell. The red blood cell
  model with imposed maximum and minimum constraints on each flux was sampled using
  the in silico algorithm. The histograms next to each reaction represent the distribution
  of solutions with respect to each reaction flux. The vertical shaded line on each
  plot indicates where the zero flux line is. Several general flux distribution patterns
  have been identified including right peak (HK), left peak (G6PDH), central peak
  (PGK), and broad peak (PYR exchange). Due to the convexity of the solution space,
  no distribution can have more than one peak. The flux distribution shape gives information
  about the sensitivity of the solution space to each constraint. If a flux distribution
  has a right peak, decreasing a maximum constraint will eliminate many solutions
  from the valid space. Reactions that are part of the same pathway with no intermediate
  branch points (PGM, EM, PK) all have the same flux distributions. Distributions
  shown are based on 500,000 uniformly distributed points in the steady-state flux
  space. These details on these distributions can be seen in more detail in  (original
  distributions). The dotted lines in the load reactions represent the main physiologic
  function of the specified metabolic load, but are not explicitly accounted for in
  the stoichiometric matrix.
