caption: 'Glycogenolysis and glycolysis pathways to lactate. The reaction in the box
  denotes glycogenolysis that is followed by glycolysis pathway in which G6-P is degraded
  to lactate. (S 4.1) means “see Section 4.1”. TCA cycle: tricarboxylic acid cycle.
  ATP synthesized by degradation of pyruvate is not drawn, because the present review
  only deals with anaerobic contraction. For further details see the text.'
