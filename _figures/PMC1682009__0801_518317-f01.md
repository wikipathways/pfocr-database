caption: Activation of the Akt pathway through binding of a ligand to a receptor,
  tyrosine kinase. Binding of insulin to the insulin-receptor results in a cascade
  of signaling events, which activate Akt and trigger protein synthesis and cell growth.
  Tuberin and hamartin form a complex that maintains the small G protein, Rheb, in
  the inactivated state. Phosphorylation of tuberin results in loss of its GTPase
  activating activity (GAP), allowing Rheb to activate mTOR and other downstream targets.
  Loss of tuberin or hamartin function through genetic mutations can result in constitutive
  activation of protein translation and cell growth, which is believed to play an
  important role in hamartoma formation in TSC and LAM. Signaling through mTOR can
  be inhibited by sirolimus or rapamycin, as well as other mTOR inhibitors.
