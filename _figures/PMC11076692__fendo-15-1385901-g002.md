caption: '46,XX Testicular and ovotesticular DSD. Loss of the antagonistic balance
  of the RSPO1/WNT4/β-catenin pathway and the SRY/SOX9/FGF9 pathway can lead to the
  development of an abnormal gonad. (A) In XX individuals with Yp translocations and
  the presence of SRY, testicular differentiation can occur. In 46,XX SRY-negative
  individuals, testicular development may result from different conditions: overexpression
  of “pro-testicular” factors such as SOX9, SOX3, SOX10, FGF9, DMRT1, and (B) reduced
  expression of “pro-ovarian” factors such as RSPO1, WNT4, NR2F2. These changes in
  gene expression can be caused by an increase in the number of gene copies or their
  regulatory sequences. Additionally, in particular conditions, factors like WT1 and
  NR5A1 can also promote testicular development in 46,XX individuals. *Indicates genes
  associated with 46,XX testicular and ovotesticular DSD in humans'
