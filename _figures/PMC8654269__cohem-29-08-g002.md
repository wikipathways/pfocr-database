caption: Dysregulation of interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase-dependent signaling
  in myeloid malignancies. Inflammatory and immune-related receptors, such as certain
  TLRs and IL-1R, recruit the adaptors TIRAP and MyD88, along with IRAK kinases and
  TRAF6, to form the Myddosome complex. Negative regulators of the pathways, such
  as miR-145, miR-146a, and TIFAB, are frequently deleted in MDS and AML. Mutations
  in U2AF1 and SF3B1 result in conversion of hypomorphic (IRAK4-S) to hypermorphic
  (IRAK4-L) IRAK4 isoforms in MDS and AML. IRAK4-L can recruit MyD88 and IRAK1 to
  activate signaling to NF-κB and MAPKs. The signaling pathway was adapted from Trowbridge
  and Starczynowski (2021). AML, acute myeloid leukemia; IRAK, interleukin 1 receptor-associated
  kinases; MDS, myelodysplastic syndromes; TLRs, toll-like receptors.
