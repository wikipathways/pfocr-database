caption: An example of the complexity of p21‐activated kinase (Pak1) signaling in
  a ventricular cardiac myocyte. Illustrated are the multiple pathways of signaling
  with the activation of Pak1. Included are signaling to actin polymerization via
  cofilin and LIMK (LIM kinase) and to integrins in the costamere complex, including
  vinculin (Vin), paxillin (Pax), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), contiguous with the
  extracellular matrix (ECM), and signaling networks (via tensin and tailin). Noted
  also is the dystroglycan/sarcoglycan complex, which is linked to these networks
  and dysferlin/caveolin at the t‐tubules. Other mechano‐sensitive elements are shown
  in a network of stress sensors, including microtubules and Z‐disk (with docked signaling
  molecules, one of which is Pak1 in the inactivated state). Major proteins controlling
  sarcomere mechanics are cardiac myosin‐binding protein C (c‐MyBP‐C) and troponin
  I (cTnI). The illustration depicts membrane (LTCC, L‐type Ca‐channels) and sarcoplasmic
  reticulum ryanodine release channels (RYR), the sarco‐endoplasmic Ca‐Pump (SERCA2a)
  and phospholamban (PLB) all of which control excitation and Ca‐fluxes to and from
  the myofilaments and area regulated by protein kinase A and protein phosphatase
  2A. Green arrows indicate activating and inhibiting pathways to these cellular organelles.
  Also indicated is Pak1 nuclear signaling via Akt, MKK7, JNK, SRF, calcineurin, and
  in the Hippo pathway via YAP (yes associated protein). See text for discussion of
  these regulatory mechanisms and an expanded section on Hippo signaling
