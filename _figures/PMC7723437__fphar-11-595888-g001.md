caption: 'The endolysosome pathway: Extracellular signaling molecules upon binding
  to cell surface receptors can be engulfed by endocytosis. These endocytosed vesicles
  can mature and differentiate into early endosomes (pH 5.5–6.0), late endosomes (pH
  5.5–5.0), lysosomes (pH 5.0–4.5), and endolysosomes (a fusion process of lysosomes
  and late endosomes). Various marker substances can differentiate early from late
  endosomes including Rab4 (early endosomes), and Rab5 and Rab7 (late endosomes).
  Both early and late endosomes regulate recycling processes that return constituent
  molecules back to plasma membranes. Late endosomes can produce multi-vesicular bodies,
  which can fuse with lysosomes or can be released from cells in the form of extracellular
  vesicles (exosomes). Lysosomes regulate the degradation of extracellular materials
  in endolysosomes produced by fusions with late endosomes. Lysosomes can also fuse
  with autophagosomes to form autolysosomes; sites where extracellular and intracellular
  components are degraded. EL, endolysosomes; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EE, early
  endosomes; LE, late-endosomes; MVBs, multi-vesicular bodies; AP, autophagosomes;
