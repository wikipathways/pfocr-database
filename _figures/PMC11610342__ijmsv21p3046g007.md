caption: JSHT alleviated LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells by modulating
  macrophage polarization. LPS induction results in the nuclear translocation of NFκB
  and activates the pERK/pJNK signaling pathway. It promotes macrophages to pro-inflammatory
  M1 polarization and increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such
  as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. JSHT-administration inhibits LPS-induced nuclear translocation
  of NFκB and downregulates the pERK/pJNK signaling pathway. It raises tendency of
  macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 polarization and decreases the LPS-induced secretion
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), while increases repair cytokines
  (TGF-β and IL-10)
