caption: 'Inflammation in the gouty joint. Multiple steps in the inflammatory pathway
  are initiated by MSU deposition in the joint. MSU crystals are recognized by the
  pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system, such as the TLRs and
  are phagocytosed by macrophages. Intracellular MSU crystals are recognized by the
  NLRP3 inflammasome (a multiprotein complex composed of a C-terminal LRR ‘sensor’
  domain, a central nucleotide-binding domain (NACHT domain), which regulates self-oligomerization
  and an N-terminal PYD) resulting in oligomerization of NLRP3 and cleavage of procaspase-1
  to caspase-1. Cathepsin B, ROS, and K+ efflux (stimulated by ATP accumulation) are
  also understood to have some involvement in the activation and oligomerization of
  NLRP3 following MSU internalization. Caspase-1 in turn cleaves inactive proIL-1β,
  transcribed in a NF-κβ-dependent manner following TLR stimulation, to produce active
  IL-1β, which is released into the extracellular joint fluid. IL-1β activates IL1
  receptors on endothelial cells and resident macrophages within the joint, resulting
  in signal transduction and gene activation and leading to the secretion of an array
  of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These in turn recruit and activate
  leukocytes into the joint thereby amplifying the inflammatory cascade.Abbreviations:
  ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD; CARD, caspase recruitment
  domain; PYD, Pyrin domain; IL, interleukin; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; MSU, monosodium
  urate; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88); NACHT, domain
  present in neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (NAIP) major histocompatibility
  complex class II transactivator; NF-κβ, nuclear factor κβ; NLRP, NACHT domain, LRR
  domain, and Pyrin domain-containing protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLR,
