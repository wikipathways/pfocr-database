caption: Biological consequences of methylation on Rho-RhoGDI interaction. (A) During
  the final step of the prenylation pathway, Icmt methylates Rho proteins. Due to
  methylation, the relative binding interaction between RhoA and RhoGDI is decreased,
  allowing RhoGEF to displace RhoGDI and activate Rho. The RhoGEF mediated exchange
  of GDP by GTP results in activated Rho and increased Rho signaling and Rho-mediated
  events. (B) When Icmt activity is decreased, Rho proteins are not methylated and
  the binding affinity of RhoGDI to Rho proteins is increased. The increased binding
  of RhoGDI impairs the ability of RhoGEF to bind and activate Rho proteins, thus
  inhibiting Rho signaling and Rho-mediated biology.

  description: Biological consequences of methylation on Rho-RhoGDI interaction. (A)
    During the final step of the prenylation pathway, Icmt methylates Rho proteins.
    Due to methylation, the relative binding interaction between RhoA and RhoGDI is
    decreased, allowing RhoGEF to displace RhoGDI and activate Rho. The RhoGEF mediated
    exchange of GDP by GTP results in activated Rho and increased Rho signaling and
    Rho-mediated events. (B) When Icmt activity is decreased, Rho proteins are not
    methylated and the binding affinity of RhoGDI to Rho proteins is increased. The
    increased binding of RhoGDI impairs the ability of RhoGEF to bind and activate
    Rho proteins, thus inhibiting Rho signaling and Rho-mediated biology.
