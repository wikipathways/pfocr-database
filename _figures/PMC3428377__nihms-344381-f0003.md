caption: Signaling pathways for estrogen production and action. PGE2 that originates
  from malignant epithelial cells or adipose fibroblasts activates specific signaling
  mechanisms to induce aromatase expression in adipose fibroblasts. The best characterized
  and most potent components of the PGE2-dependent signaling pathway in the adipose
  fibroblast are PKA/PKC and p38/JNK. Some of the key transcription factors downstream
  of this pathway include C/EBPβ, JunD and JunB, and LRH-1 which bind to the tumorigenic
  aromatase promoter region I.3/II (see text). The key cis-regulatory elements, C/EBPβ-S
  and CRE and the promoters II and I.3, cluster within a sequence of less than 300
  bp. LRH-1 binds to a nuclear receptor half-site located more proximal to promoter
  II (PII). It is very likely that these key elements regulate the activity of both
  promoters coordinately. The details of this complex regulation are not well understood.
  Estrogen produced as a consequence of aromatase activity acts on estrogen receptor-α
  (ERα) in neighboring epithelial cells to enhance carcinogenesis by transactivating
  specific genes. PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer
  binding protein; C/EBPβ-S, C/EBPβ site; CRE, cAMP response element; PR, progesterone
  receptor, Wnt, wingless-type MMTV integration-site family; ADORA, adenosine A1 receptor.
