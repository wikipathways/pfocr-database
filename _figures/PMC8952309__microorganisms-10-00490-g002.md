caption: Interplay between diet, gut microbiota, and macrophages during intestinal
  fibrosis. The gut microbiota regulates intestinal macrophage phenotypes and functions
  by releasing specific metabolites derived from the metabolism of dietary components.
  Dietary fibre (green pathway) is metabolised by gut microbiota, leading to short
  chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, which in turn promotes M2b and M2d macrophage
  polarisation, which is characterised by an increase of lipid oxidation, providing
  sustained energy for macrophage anti-fibrotic functions. Dietary components can
  exert detrimental effects, activating pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic processes.
  The western diet (red pathway), characterised by high fat, high sugar and high salt
  contents, alters gut microbiota composition (dysbiosis), impairs the gut barrier
  and leads to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA), saturated fatty acid (SFA),
  and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production. In turn, macrophages undergo a metabolic
  reprogramming towards glycolysis and assume an M1, M2a, or M2c phenotype, leading
  to myofibroblast activation, producing ECM through TGF-β1 secretion.
