caption: Hypothesized role of UV-B in shade avoidance. UV-B perceived by the photoreceptor
  UVR8 interacts with COP1 and up-regulates transcription of HY5 and HYH. GA2ox1 levels
  increase, reducing GA, and increasing DELLA stability, which inhibits PIF function.
  In a separate pathway, UV-B signaling blocks low R:FR-mediated up-regulation of
  auxin biosynthesis, in part through enhanced degradation of PIF4 and PIF5. Together,
  UV-B inhibits auxin biosynthesis and elongation growth, inhibiting shade avoidance.
