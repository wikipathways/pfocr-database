caption: 'Immune and central nervous systems interact and contribute to the etiology
  and pathophysiology of cytokine-induced depression. Text boxes summarize the putative
  factors contributing to the development of depressive symptoms as well as the accompanying
  alterations in peripheral and central neuroimmune modulators. Current theory proposes
  that years of cumulative risk factors (e.g., genetic polymorphisms, repeated brain
  injuries or vascular insults, exposure to stress and toxins, or oxidative stress)
  combine to activate danger associated molecular pattern detectors (DAMPs) within
  the innate immune system, in turn modifying microglial receptors [e.g., toll-like
  receptors (TLRs), receptors for highly glycosylated end products (RAGEs)], resulting
  in the chronic overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β,
  and IL-6 (). Related immune mechanisms activating pathogen associated molecular
  pattern molecules (PAMPs) are also speculated to contribute to the etiology of depressive
  symptoms and may be especially relevant for depression accompanying specific medical
  conditions. 2a. IDO pathway and its role in mediating cytokine-induced depression.
  Cytokines, such as IFN-γ, can induce the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)
  or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO; an analogous enzyme located in the liver), which
  induces the metabolism of tryptophan. Activation of IDO decreases the amount of
  tryptophan for conversion to serotonin and increases the possibility of oxidative
  stress. Specifically, kynurenine, a metabolite of tryptophan, can be transported
  across the blood–brain barrier into the brain where it is further metabolized in
  macrophages, microglia and astrocytes leading to the generation of potentially neurotoxic
  compounds: 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and quinolinic acid (QA). Taken together,
  these studies provide support for the hypothesis that alterations in the regulation
  of certain cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α released during an immune response
  activate the hepatic synthesis of CRP and components of the HPA axis, alter neurotransmitter
  networks activity, and induce fatigue, loss of appetite, anhedonia, and other depressive
  symptoms.'
