caption: Proposed mechanistic diagram of the effects of LP treatment on EPA, DHA,
  PC and major eicosanoids against lung cancer. The phytosome portion of LP likely
  contains high levels of PC and serves as transporters for n-3 PUFAs EPA and DHA.
  Increases in EPA and DHA function as competitive inhibitors of COX-2. In addition,
  an increase in EPA results in an increase in downstream PGE3. Other GSE-mediated
  modulations of major eicosanoids signaling pathways previously described by our
  group are also depicted (a decrease in PGE2 due to COX-2 inhibition by GSE, while
  an increase in prostacyclin synthase (PTGIS) by GSE results in an overall increase
  in PGI2. Furthermore, an increase in 15-HETE is likely due to shunting of the n-6
  AA precursor toward the 15-LOX pathway in the setting of COX-2 inhibition. Collectively,
  through modulations of these eicosanoids and n-3 PUFAs, LP increases apoptosis,
  decreases cell proliferation and inflammation, thereby reduces the driving forces
  of cancerization.
