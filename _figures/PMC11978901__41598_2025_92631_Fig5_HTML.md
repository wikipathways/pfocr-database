caption: 'Metabolic pathways associated with sepsis after trauma. (A) Metabolic pathways
  related to sepsis after trauma under the impact of severe trauma. (B) Glycerophospholipid
  metabolism. (C) Metabolic pathways associated with sepsis after trauma under the
  impact of infection (D) Caffeine metabolic pathway. *Color gradient and circle size
  indicate the significance of the pathway ranked by p‑value (yellow: higher p‑value,
  red: lower p‑value) and pathway impact score (larger circle indicates higher impact
  score)'
