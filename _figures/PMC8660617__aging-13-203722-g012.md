caption: Cell cycle-related networks correlated with the 26S proteasome delta subunit,
  non-ATPase 7 (PSMD7) family gene in breast cancer (BRCA). MetaCore pathway analysis
  of biological processes revealed that pathways related to "Cell cycle_ESR1 regulation
  of G1S transition" were significantly associated with BRCA development.
