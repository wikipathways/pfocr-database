caption: There are several potential avenues through which ER function is linked to
  inflammatory signaling. In response to ER stress, the three branches of the unfolded
  protein response (UPR) are activated. In the first branch, PERK-mediated attenuation
  of translation results in release of NF-κB from its inhibitor IκB. NF-κB moves to
  the nucleus and switches on expression of a variety of different genes involved
  in inflammatory pathways, such as those encoding the cytokines IL-1 and TNF-α. In
  the second branch of the UPR, activated IRE1α recruits tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-receptor-associated
  factor 2 (TRAF2), and this complex interacts with JNK and IκB kinase (IKK) and activates
  them. These inflammatory kinases then phosphorylate and activate downstream mediators
  of inflammation. The third branch of the UPR, the ATF6 pathway, also activates NF-κB.
  There is also crosstalk between the three branches. For example, spliced X-box binding
  protein 1 (XBP1s), as well as ATF4, induce production of the inflammatory cytokines
  IL-8, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) by human endothelial cells.
  XBP1s has also been implicated in production of IFN-β when ER stress is combined
  with activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and in IFN-α production by
  dendritic cells. The ability of XBP1s to expand the capacity of the ER for protein
  folding (and ER calcium stores) enables it to mediate calcium-dependent inflammatory
  responses in human bronchial epithelial cells, which produce IL-8. (Inset) Assembly
  of a putative metabolic inflammasome or metaflammasome. This protein complex integrates
  pathogen and nutrient sensing with ER stress, inflammatory kinases, insulin action,
  and metabolic homeostasis. The eIF2α kinase PKR (double-stranded RNA-activated protein
  kinase) is a core component of the metaflammasome and interacts directly with several
  inflammatory kinases such as IKK and JNK, insulin receptor signaling components
  such as IRS1, and the translational machinery via eIF2α. Nutrients, inflammatory
  mediators, and ER stress regulate PKR activity.
