caption: Relationship between HG and sepsis. Sepsis can stimulate the hypothalamus
  to increase the secretion and release of CRH. Meanwhile, CRH promotes the synthesis
  and release of ACTH from the pituitary gland, and ACTH in turn stimulates the adrenal
  cortex to secrete cortisol, which can lead to an increase in blood glucose. Sepsis
  can also stimulate macrophages to secrete large amounts of IL-6, TNF-α, and other
  proinflammatory mediators. These proinflammatory mediators can disrupt the signaling
  of the insulin transduction pathway, and it is a major cause of insulin resistance
  in the host. Insulin resistance can further exacerbate HG in turning. Glucose is
  recognized by TLRs in a variety of tissue cells and activates NLRP3 inflammasomes
  that can cleave pro-caspase-1 into activated caspase-1 to induce inflammation. Activated
  caspase-1 processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to form mature IL-1β and IL-18, promoting
  the development of inflammation in sepsis. HG, high glucose; CRH, corticotropin-releasing
  hormone; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis
  factor; TLRs, Toll-like receptors.
