caption: Output and input pathways of the central circadian timing system in the mammalian
  brain that may be involved sundowning–related behavioral aggression and circadian
  dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The master circadian pacemaker,
  is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN releases the fast
  neurotransmitter GABA, as well as several peptides including vasoactive intestinal
  peptide (VIP) and argine vasopressin (AVP) from its major axonal output pathway
  to the nearby subparaventricular zone (SPZ). The GABAergic SPZ regulates rhythms
  of locomotor activity, sleep-wake, and feeding via pathway to the dorsomedial hypothalamus
  (DMH), and regulates rhythms of aggression propensity via a pathway to the ventromedial
  hypothalamus (VMH). The SCN is entrained to the daily light-dark cycle by input
  from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, which release pituitary
  adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) and glutamate (GLU) via the retinohypothalamic
  tract (RHT). The RHT also densely innervates the SPZ in most nocturnal mammals,
  but provides little or no innervation of the SPZ in many diurnal mammals, including
  humans (indicated by dashed line). A cholinergic (ACh) input to the SCN from the
  basal forebrain has been suggested in rats, but is absent in mice (indicated by
  dashed line). Cholinergic input to the SCN has also been reported from the laterodorsal
  tegmentum (LDT), pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT) complex, which also releases GABA
  and GLU. Serotonergic (5HT) inputs to both the SCN and SPZ have been reported from
  the midbrain raphe complex. Finally, the geniculo-hypothalamic tract (GHT), originating
  from the retinoreceipient (not shown here) ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)
  and intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) of the thalamus, provides an input of GABA and
  neuropeptide Y (NPY) to both the SCN and SPZ. Structures are not drawn to scale.

  description: Output and input pathways of the central circadian timing system in
    the mammalian brain that may be involved sundowning–related behavioral aggression
    and circadian dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The master
    circadian pacemaker, is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus.
    The SCN releases the fast neurotransmitter GABA, as well as several peptides including
