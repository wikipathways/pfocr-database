caption: (A) Schematic organization of metabolic pathways for plasma metabolites and
  immune cells after 1-hour ethyl pyruvate (EP) administration. We applied color coding
  to the text based on the Log2 fold changes of metabolites, with significant changes
  (p-value < 0.05) highlighted in bold and marked with an asterisk (*). IL-6, HO-1,
  and glucose levels are shown based on qPCR and blood chemistry results (see Fig. 6).
  Substances shown in black text represent metabolites that were not detected by MS.
  (B) The relative intensity changes of metabolites involved in the significant metabolic
  pathways (phenylalanine biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, and steroid hormone
  biosynthesis) are described separately. Changes in plasma metabolites related to
  the lipid metabolic pathway are described in detail in Fig. 5A
