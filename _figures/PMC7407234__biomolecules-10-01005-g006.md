caption: Schematic representation of the proposed model for MX1’s role in ERS-mediated
  cell fate. (A) When misfolded proteins begin to accumulate within the ER lumen,
  the BiP chaperone breaks free from PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 to bind to misfolded proteins,
  activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). The intensity and duration of ERS
  are decisive factors that define the cellular fate to survival or death []. (B)
  MX1 may sequester BiP, enhancing PERK-mediated pathway activation, leading to cell
  death. Further, HO-1 may favor this ERS axis, enhancing MX1 levels. ERAD = Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated
  protein degradation.
