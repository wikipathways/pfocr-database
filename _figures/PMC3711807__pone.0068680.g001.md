caption: Regulatory T cells, activated macrophages, infected macrophages, and chronically
  infected macrophages are able to produce IL-10. IL-10 inhibits the production of
  TNF-α in all cell types. IL-10 indirectly prevents the recruitment of immune cells
  to the site of infection by inhibiting chemokine production. IL-10 limits the secondary
  regulatory mechanism (cell-cell contact, TGF-β, and other regulatory mechanisms)
  down regulation of activated macrophages by regulatory T cells. Activated macrophages,
  infected macrophages, chronically infected macrophages, resting macrophages (STAT1
  or NFκB activated), cytotoxic T cells, and pro-inflammatory T cells are able to
  produce TNF-α. TNF-α directly induces recruitment of immune cells to the site of
  infection (lung). TNF-α induces production of IL-10 in activated macrophages, which
  represents the pro/anti inflammatory plasticity of activated macrophages. TNF-α,
  along with interferon-γ derived from pro-inflammatory T cells, induces activation
  of resting macrophages or it can induce the caspase-mediated apoptosis pathway found
  in all cell types.
