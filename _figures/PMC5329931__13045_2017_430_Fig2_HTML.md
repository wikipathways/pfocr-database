caption: The effects of TAMs on tumor progression. The protumor functions of TAMs
  include cancer initiation and promotion (blue), immune suppression (green), metastasis,
  establishment of a premalignant niche (orange), and promotion of angiogenesis (purple).
  (1) TAMs can produce cytokines such as IL-6/IL-17/IL-23 or mitogens to induce the
  initiation and progression of cancer via the NF-κB or STAT3 signaling pathway in
  tumor cells. (2) Suppression of CTL proliferation by TAMs is at least partly dependent
  on metabolism of l-arginine via iNOS or arginase I, which results in ROS production.
  TAMs inhibit CTL responses via PD1/PD-L1 signaling pathway. TAM-derived PGE2 and
  IL-10 promote the induction of Tregs, and TAM-derived CCL17/18/22 recruit Tregs,
  which results in CTL suppression. (3) Neoplastic cell invasion of ectopic tissue
  can be promoted through protease-dependent ECM remodeling that may directly affect
  neoplastic migration or the premalignant niche. TAM-derived CCL18 promotes tumor
  metastasis by triggering integrin clustering and enhancing their adherence to extracellular
  matrix (EM) in tumor cells. TAM-derived TGF-β plays important roles in initiation
  and progression of the EMT. TAMs-derived TNF-α, VEGF, and TGF-β can transport through
  the bloodstream to destination organs, where they induce macrophages to produce
  S100A8, which further recruits tumor cells to these organs and promotes the formation
  of metastatic foci. (4) Hypoxia induces HIF-1α expression in TAMs and further regulates
  the transcription of many genes associated with angiogenesis. Subsets of Tie2+ TAMs
  can interact with mural cells/pericytes to regulate vascular structure
