caption: Mechanisms of insulin–EGF signal integration. (A) Weak ERK activation in
  response to insulin. IR is a strong activator of PI3K signaling, and insulin stimulation
  induces pronounced adaptor recruitment to the membrane (GAB1 → PIP3-GAB1; IRS →
  PIP3-IRS). The membrane-associated IRS proteins (but not GAB1) are the preferred
  substrates of the IR kinase (PIP3-IRS → PIP3-pIRS). However, phosphorylated IRS
  proteins do not effectively recruit Ras activators, such as Grb2–SOS, implying that
  insulin is a weak activator of ERK signaling. (B) ERK activation in response to
  physiological EGF doses. Active EGFR phosphorylates the membrane-associated GAB1
  (PIP3-GAB1 → PIP3-pGAB1), which in turn efficiently recruits Grb2–SOS and SHP2,
  and thereby activates Ras-MAPK signaling (for simplicity, the Shc-dependent pathway
  of EGFR-induced MAPK activation is not shown). However, ERK phosphorylation induced
  by low doses of EGF may remain suboptimal, as the GAB1 recruitment to the membrane
  is submaximal and highly transient (GAB1 → PIP3-GAB1). GAB1 phosphorylation and
  Raf activation are enhanced by EGFR-induced Src kinase activity. (C) ERK activation
  can increase upon insulin and EGF co-stimulation. Synergistic ERK activation predominantly
  arises from coincidence detection of insulin and EGF stimuli at the level of GAB1;
  the GAB1 adaptor is massively recruited to the membrane by IR signaling (GAB1 →
  PIP3-GAB1) and subsequently phosphorylated by EGFR and active Src (PIP3-GAB1 → PIP3-pGAB1).
  The relative activities of the processes are illustrated by the boldness of the
  arrows.
