caption: Molecular mechanism schematic diagram illustrating the recovery effect of
  tanshinone IIA on TOCPinduced ovarian dysfunction. TOCP induces ovarian apoptosis
  mediated by inhibiting the YAP phosphorylation, ultimately leading to ovarian dysfunction.
  Tanshinone IIA stimulates the YAP phosphorylation, causing its retention in the
  cytoplasm. Unphosphorylated YAP translocates to the nucleus and enhances the expression
  of downstream target genes CCN1 and CCN2. Upregulation of CCN2 promotes the phosphorylation
  of AKT, ERK1/2, and P38 signaling pathways, ultimately inhibiting ovarian apoptosis
  and reversing TOCP-induced ovarian dysfunction
