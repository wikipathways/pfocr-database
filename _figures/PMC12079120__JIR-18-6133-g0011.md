caption: Sketch diagram describes pharmacology mechanism of isoliquiritigenin on periodontitis.
  ISL has a great potential in curing periodontitis through its dual mechanisms of
  antibacterial activity and anti-inflammatory effects on immune cells. NF-κB signaling
  pathway is great important, which is inhibited by ISL targeting to protein, IKKB,
  in immune cell of periodontitis
