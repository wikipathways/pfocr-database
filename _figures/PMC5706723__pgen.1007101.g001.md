caption: 'A: Simplified diagram of the regulatory pathway leading to acid resistance
  in exponential phase-minimal medium cultures of E. coli. Thick arrows represent
  genes, with black denoting regulators, and hatched arrows indicate genes whose promoters
  were used as reporters in this study. Gray rectangles represent two-component system
  proteins, black ovals and diamonds represent other types of regulators. For clarity,
  only representative AR effector-encoding genes are shown, and genes of the PhoP
  regulon are omitted. B: Locus in MG1655 containing safA and ydeO (depicted as dark
  grey arrows) that is missing in E. coli MP1. Black vertical lines represent the
  boundaries of the region missing in MP1. Figure not drawn to scale.'
