caption: T cell aging is associated with a loss of miR-181a expression due to reduced
  TCF1 expression (left). Reduced miR-181a expression contributes to impaired T cell
  function by activating negative regulatory signaling pathways by miR-181a targets,
  e.g., ERK dephosphorylation by DUSP6. Inhibition of GSK3ß increases the expression
  of TCF1 and its target miR-181a in T cells from old adults, thus enhancing downstream
  T cell activation and proliferation (right).
