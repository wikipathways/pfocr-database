caption: NF-κB Signaling Pathway. A cartoon representing the cascade of biochemical
  events that are initiated by various stimuli, eventually leading to NF-κB nuclear
  translocation and transcriptional activation. Recruitment of different adaptor molecules
  to different receptor complexes coupled with activation of different downstream
  kinases is shown. There are mainly two signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation,
  classical (also known as canonical) and alternative. The formation and activation
  of the IKK complex, which consists of catalytically active kinases (e.g., IKKα,
  IKKβ, and IKKγ) and noncatalytic regulatory proteins (e.g., NEMO and ELKS), is a
  universal event in both signaling pathways. In the classical signaling pathway,
  ligand binding to a cell surface receptor leads to the recruitment of adaptor proteins
  (e.g., TRAF6) to the receptor, leading to the recruitment of IKK complex and subsequent
  phosphorylation and degradation of the IκB proteins. Unlike the classical signaling
  pathway, the alternative signaling pathway, which is normally triggered by non-proinflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., LTβ, BAFF, and CD40L) as well as some viruses (e.g., HTLV and EBV),
  does not allow the recruitment of NEMO. Instead, ligand binding to a cell surface
  receptor leads to the recruitment of NIK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates
  IKKα dimers. Typically, the classical signaling pathway leads to the activation
  of NF-κB dimers consisting of RelA, c-Rel, RelB, and p50, while the alternative
  signaling pathway leads to the activation of NF-κB dimers consisting primarily of
  RelB and p52.
