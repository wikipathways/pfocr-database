caption: 'Potential mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial
  dysfunction. (A) Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress: in COVID-19
  patients, the stimulated NADPH oxidase induced by TNF-α leads to ROS accumulation.
  Additionally, elevated IFN reduces expression of functional ACE2 leading to imbalanced
  RAS signaling and increased ROS. Excessive ROS generation then disturbs vascular
  tone and increases endothelial permeability; (B) The VEGFA/VEGFR2 pathway: inflammatory
  cytokines can activate the VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling that promotes the phosphorylation
  of endothelial adhesion molecules and eNOS by activating the corresponding kinases,
  thereby increasing vascular permeability; or (C) The HMGB1-RAGE/TLR4 pathway: the
  binding of HMGB1 to RAGE or TLR4 up-regulates adhesion molecules and chemokines
  mainly through MAPK and NFκB pathway, respectively, thereby promoting vascular leakiness.
  In addition, the property of HMGB1 to rupture lysosomal membrane could activate
  inflammasome that eventually leads to pyroptosis of ECs. Black solid lines indicate
  direct binding or interaction, pink solid or dash lines indicate activation or stimulation,
  green solid or dash lines indicate inhibition, and black dash lines indicate a consequence.'
