caption: Regulation of the floral transition by the sugar signaling pathway in different
  photoperiods in SAM and Leaves. Proteins involved in signaling pathways under SD,
  LD, or both photoperiods are shown in ovals with a blue, orange, or blue-orange
  background. The positive regulatory interactions are depicted by blue arrows and
  negative interactions are depicted by red T-bars. The thick lines represent protein-protein
  interactions, whereas thin lines indicate transcriptional regulation. Unknown mechanisms
  are depicted by dotted lines and sugar transport is depicted by wavy lines.
