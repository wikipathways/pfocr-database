caption: Model of estrogen signaling pathways in cancer. 17β-estradiol (E2) activates
  ERα or ERβ to induce the receptor dimerization, and subsequently acts as a transcription
  factor or interacts with other transcription factors binding to the promoter region
  of the target genes. E2, tamoxifen (TAM) or G1 activate the G-protein Coupled Estrogen
  Receptor (GPER) distributed in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane. Activation
  of GPER located in the plasma membrane stimulates steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)
  through a Gβγ-subunit protein pathway. The β and γ subunits of the G protein activate
  the SRC tyrosine kinase, which binds to the integrin ανβ1 through the SHC adapter
  protein. The complex activates the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), which then cleaves
  the pro-heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (proHB-EGF) and releases the heparin-binding
  EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) into the extracellular space. The free HB-EGF then
  transactivates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Phosphorylation of EGFR
  in turn activates the downstream pathways, which can induce rapid non-genomic effects,
  or genomic effects regulating different genes transcription and leads to cell survival
  and proliferation. On the other hand, through GPER, E2, tamoxifen or G1 is able
  to stimulate the adenylyl cyclase activity through a Gα-subunit protein pathway,
  which then leads to the protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated suppression of the EGFR-induced
  ERK activity. Thus, via the GPER, E2, tamoxifen or G1 may balance the ERK activity
  by stimulating two distinct G-protein signaling pathways that have opposing effects
  on the EGFR-to-MAPK axis. Long-term tamoxifen treatment could sensitize the cancer
  cells through E2-stimulated upregulation of GPER and translocation from the endoplasmic
  reticulum to the plasma membrane.
