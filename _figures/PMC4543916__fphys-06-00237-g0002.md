caption: Schematic representation of signaling and biochemical pathways activated
  by T3 and/or T2 in skeletal muscle that promote variations in substrate metabolism,
  lipid handling, and thermogenesis at the mitochondrial level. If not accompanied
  by T3 or T2, the symbol + indicates that the pathway is stimulated by both iodothyronines.
  T3 and T2 activate processes leading to the import of FFA and their oxidation at
  the mitochondrial level, with FAT/CD36 playing a role. Through activation of AMPK-ACC
  signaling pathway, T2 and T3 relieves the inhibition of CPT1 by malonyl-CoA, and
  thus promote the entrance of fatty acids into mitochondria and their oxidation.
  The rise in MTE activity, would contribute to maintain a high level of fatty acid
  oxidation rate. The box represents processes, occurring at the level of mitochondrial
  inner membrane, underlying coupled and uncoupled respiration affected by T3 and
  T2.
