caption: Activation of inflammasomes. Different inflammasome sensors sense different
  ligands, canonical inflammasome activation occurs through the response to PAMP/DAMP/HAMP.
  Upon initiation and activation, the inflammasome complex assembles, inducing caspase-1
  self-cleavage and activation, and cleaves GSDMD to release the N-terminal domain
  and induce pyroptosis. Activated caspase-1 promotes cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  to activate IL-1β and IL-18, which are released through the GSDMD pore. Inhibitors
  that target inflammasomes are also depicted in the Figure.  “ASC+/-”means this activation
  pathway is independent of ASC; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; DAMP,
  damage-associated molecular patterns; HAMP, homeostasis-altering molecular processes;
  GSDMD, gasdermin D.
