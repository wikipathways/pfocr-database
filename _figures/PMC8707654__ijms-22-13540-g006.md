caption: 'Schematic depiction of pathways detected in plasma MV by pathway analysis.
  Glycerophospholipid metabolism (a): relevant metabolites detected by metabolomics
  were involved in the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by lecithin-cholesterin acyl transferase
  (LCAT) and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT).Changes in (a) were detected
  comparing the controls to all breast cancer patients and to the subgroup luminal
  B. Ether lipid metabolism (b): pathway analysis suggested involvement in the reaction
  catalyzed by LPCAT or phospholipase 2 when comparing metabolites of the control
  group to subgroup luminal B.'
