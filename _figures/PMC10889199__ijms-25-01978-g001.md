caption: Mechanism of endothelial cell senescence. Senescent endothelial cells develop
  a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and an increase of SA-β-Gal activity.
  Senescence results in decrease of endothelial NO synthase expression and reduction
  of NO production, and the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and ROS levels increase significantly,
  leading to DNA damage and promotion of senescence and apoptosis. Senescent cells
  also exhibit upregulation of p53/p21 or p16/Rb pathways and markers associated with
  activation of the DNA damage response (p38MAPK and γH2AX). In addition, the VEGF
  signaling pathway, along with AMPK, mTOR, and SIRT1, is also involved in the endothelial
  cell senescence
