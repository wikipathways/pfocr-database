caption: A model illustrating the role of the N-end rule pathway in N-terminal arginylation
  of ER-residing proteins and the ligand-mediated regulation of autophagy in stressed
  cells. In this model, ER residents and clients acquire cotranslationally and cotranslocationally
  the degrons of the N-end rule pathway, which normally remain separated from cytosolic
  N-end rule machinery. N-terminal arginylation of ER-residing proteins, especially
  BiP, is induced by various stress signals such as cytosolic misfolded proteins that
  are initially tagged with Ub but cannot be readily processed by the proteasome (Step
  1). One physiological stress signal that induces N-terminal arginylation of ER proteins
  is the presence of cytosolic foreign dsDNA which triggers innate immune responses.
  N-terminal arginylation is thought to occur when the N-terminal residue of the substrates
  is exposed to the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane (Step 2), which may facilitate
  the cytosolic relocalization of arginylated ER proteins. We do not exclude the possibility
  that N-terminal arginylation occurs after the substrates complete their cytosolic
  relocalization. Arginylated ER proteins relocated to non-ER compartments appear
  to have both shared and distinct functions and metabolic fates. At least a subpopulation
  of cytosolic R-BiP appears to be associated with its cargoes such as cytosolic misfolded
  proteins (Step 3). R-BiP, alone or loaded with its cargo, binds to the ZZ domain
  of p62 through the N-end rule interaction of its Nt-Arg (Step 4). This induces an
  allosteric conformational change of p62, exposing PB1 and LIR domains. PB1 domain
  promotes self-oligomerization and aggregation of p62 (Step 5), together with cargoes
  such as cytosolic misfolded proteins (Step 6). LIR domain mediates the interaction
  of p62 with LC3 on the autophagic membranes (Step 7). In this model, the Nt-Arg
  residue acts as an autophagic delivery determinant to autophagosomes for BiP and
  its cargoes, an activating ligand to p62, and an autophagic degron for BiP and the
  cargoes of R-BiP and p62.
