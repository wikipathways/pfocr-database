caption: Effects of pyrazoleamide treatment in P. falciparum. Our integrated model
  analysis suggests that a sublethal dose of pyrazoleamide (PYZ) caused a reduction
  in PfATP4 flux, disrupting the homeostasis of sodium ions (Na+) and protons (H+)
  and, ultimately, reducing the osmotic pressure. The model also indicated reduced
  uptake of amino acids (AA), such as isoleucine, and a decreased rate of protein
  synthesis in drug-treated parasites. We found that the parasites adjust carbohydrate
  metabolism to produce an osmolyte (MI) that can counter the effects of drug treatment.
  However, this metabolic adjustment results in decreased flux via PPP, consequently
  decreasing NADPH and PRPP, and exacerbating the effects of the drug by increasing
  oxidative stress. Hence, our results suggest that downstream consequences of metabolic
  adjustments contribute to the efficacy of pyrazoleamides in P. falciparum. AA amino
  acid, ADP adenosine diphosphate, ATP adenosine triphosphate, G6P glucose 6-phosphate,
