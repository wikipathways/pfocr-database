caption: The core pathway of Notch signaling. Proneural genes such as Mash1 and Ngn2
  promote neuronal differentiation and induce the expression of Dll1, which in turn
  activates Notch in neighboring cells. Upon activation of Notch, the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD) is released from the transmembrane portion and transferred to the
  nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA-binding protein Rbpj and the transcriptional
  co-activator Maml. The NICD–Rbpj–Maml complex induces the expression of transcriptional
  repressor genes such as Hes1 and Hes5. Hes1 and Hes5 then repress the expression
  of proneural genes and Dll1, thereby leading to the maintenance of neural stem/progenitor
  cells. Numb inhibits Notch signaling and induces neuronal differentiation.
