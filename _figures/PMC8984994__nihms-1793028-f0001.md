caption: 'The antiviral response in norovirus-infected cells. Norovirus infection
  induces an antiviral response that restricts virus replication. a. Human norovirus
  attachment is facilitated by human blood group antigens (HBGA) and a receptor that
  is yet to be identified. In mice the receptor is CD300lf []. b. Viral entry results
  in sensing of the virus and viral components by molecular sensors. The molecular
  sensors that are triggered during human norovirus infection have not been identified,
  however human norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) have been shown to trigger TLR2
  and TLR5 (70). MDA5 and RIG-I are also involved in the response against human norovirus
  [] and TLR7 has been shown to trigger an antiviral response that protects against
  murine norovirus (MNV) []. c. Virus sensing results in activation of transcription
  factors including NFkB [] and interferon regulatory factors IRF1(102), IRF3 and
  IRF7(3) which facilitate transcription of genes encoding type I, type II and type
  III interferon. d. Interferon is secreted and engages corresponding receptors on
  the cell surface, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of STAT1/2 through
  the JAK/STAT pathway []. e. STAT1/2 translocate to the nucleus and facilitate upregulation
  of hundreds of antiviral interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). f. The proteins encoded
  by antiviral ISGs restrict virus replication. This figure summarizes the immune
  components involved in the antiviral response to norovirus infection and includes
  findings from human norovirus infection as well as its surrogates: ¥human norovirus
