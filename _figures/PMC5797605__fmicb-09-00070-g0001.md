caption: 'mTOR signaling during autophagy. mTOR has two complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2,
  differentiated according to their activator proteins Raptor and Rictor. When activated,
  mTOR blocks ULK complex formation by phosphorylating it. ULK and PI3K complex formation
  marks the initiation of autophagy, followed by ATG-5, 12, and 16 binding on the
  phagophore membrane. This leads to LC3 translocation on the autophagosome membrane,
  which is required for fusion with lysosome and ultimately bacterial killing. Autophagy
  activating factors and pathways are denoted in black color and autophagy inhibitors
  are in red color letters and lines; mTOR activation leads to protein synthesis,
  nucleotide synthesis, cytoskeletal regulation and ion transport. These are denoted
  in blue color. Yellow color highlight denotes mycobacterial factors influencing
  autophagy.'
