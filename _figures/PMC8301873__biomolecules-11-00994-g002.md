caption: The role of the purinergic signaling pathway in regulating endothelial function.
  Hypoxia, thrombosis, and ischemia-reperfusion injury promote extracellular ATP (eATP)
  release from dying astrocytes and neurons that potentiates endothelial dysfunction.
  Damaged endothelial cells release pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-α, which
  directly upregulate leukocyte-endothelial adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1) to
  facilitate leukocyte adherence and transmigration through the endothelium. This
  contributes to a pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative environment. CD39 is expressed
  on endothelial cells in the vasculature and converts eATP and ADP into AMP. AMP
  is catabolized by CD73 to generate adenosine. While ATP and ADP potentiate inflammation
  and thrombosis, adenosine inhibits platelet aggregation, inhibits inflammation and
  oxidative stress (created with BioRender.com).
