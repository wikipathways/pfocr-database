caption: 'The estrogen metabolic pathway is depicted. The top and bottom sections
  represent the extracellular space, and the middle section represents the intracellular
  space. The mitochondrial compartment is labeled in pink. Enzymes are labeled in
  green and estrogen metabolites are labeled in grey. Protein definitions with corresponding
  abbreviations and their associated genes are as follows: CDR=Aldo-keto reductase
  family 1 member C4 (Chlordecone reductase), coded by AKR1C4; 3-oxo-5-beta-steroid
  4-dehydrogenase=3-oxo-5-beta-steroid 4-dehydrogenase, coded by AKR1D1; ASD=Arylsulfatase
  D, coded by ARSD; COMT=catechol-O-methyltransferase, coded by COMT; CYP11A=cytochrome
  P450, family 11, subfamily A, polypeptide 1, coded by CYP11A1; CYP11B1=cytochrome

  11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 1 (11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1), coded
  by HSD11B1; 17-beta-HSD1=Estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 1 (17-beta-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase type 1), coded by HSD17B1; 17-beta-HSD3=hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase
  3, coded by HSD17B3; 3-beta-HSD1=3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta 5-->4-isomerase
  type 1, coded by HSD3B1; SRD5A1=steroid-5-alpha-reductase, alpha polypeptide 1 (3-oxo-5
  alpha-steroid delta 4-dehydrogenase alpha 1), coded by SRD5A1; ASC=Steryl-sulfatase
  (Arylsulfatase C), coded by STS; EST-1=Estrogen sulfotransferase, coded by SULT1E1;
  SULT2B1=Sulfotransferase family cytosolic 2B member 1, coded by SULT2B1; UDPGT 2B11=UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
  2B11, coded by UGT2B11. Two genes not in the figure but in the pathway analysis
  are ESR1=estrogen receptor 1, coded by ESR1; ESR2=estrogen receptor 2 (ER beta),
  coded by ESR2. Single nucleotide polymorphisms for these genes are derived from
  the Illumina platform array. Additional abbreviations for estrogen metabolites are
  as follows: OH=hydroxyl; Me=methoxy'
