caption: Proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of mycobacterial arabinogalactan. AG
  synthesis is initiated by a transfer of GlcNAc-1-phosphate onto a decaprenyl phosphate
  and continues with the sequential addition of glycosyl residues to this lipid carrier.
  Enzymes that have been suggested to be involved in this process are presented.
