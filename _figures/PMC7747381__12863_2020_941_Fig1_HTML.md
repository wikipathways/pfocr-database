caption: Genetic pathway of sex determination in Ceratitis capitata. Cctra and Ccdoublesex
  (Ccdsx) pre-mRNAs exon-intron structures and sex-specific transcripts are shown.
  Female-specific and male-specific Cctra exons are indicated as pink and dark blue
  boxes, respectively. Cctra female-specific transcript on the left contains a 429
  aa long ORF. Cctra male-specific exons introduce premature stop codons in male-specific
  longer transcripts (orange vertical bars). CcTRA M1 and M2 male-specific isoforms
  contain truncated CcTRA ORFs represented by azul regions. In XX embryos, maternal
  CcTRA (orange circle) and CcTRA-2 (green circle) proteins promote female-specific
  splicing of newly transcribed Cctra pre-mRNA, suppressing male-specific splicing
  by binding to TRA/TRA-2 cis regulatory elements (red spots). Female-specific Cctra
  mRNA encodes zygotic CcTRA (violet circle) that maintains (together with zygotic
  CcTRA-2; dark green circle) the Cctra autoregulation induced by the maternal contributions
  by a feedback loop. Both CcTRA and CcTRA-2 proteins promote also female-specific
  splicing of the downstream Ccdsx pre-mRNA, producing mRNAs that include a female-specific
  exon (pink) and encode CcDSXF isoform inducing female sexual differentiation [].
  In XY embryos the Y-linked Maleness-on-the-Y gene (MoY) induces male-specific Cctra
  splicing and, hence, the collapse of the positive feedback loop []. By default,
  male-specific splicing of Ccdsx leads to male-specific splicing and CcDSM isoform
  inducing male sexual differentiation [, ]
