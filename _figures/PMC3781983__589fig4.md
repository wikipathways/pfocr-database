caption: Schematic representation of the cytosolic oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway,
  adapted from . G6P (glucose-6-phosphate) is oxidized by G6PDH to yield 6-phospho-gluconate
  (6PG) and in the process reduces NADP to NADPH and functions in reducing oxidative
  damage, eventually leading to the production of ribulose-5-phosphate (R5P) and erythrose-4-phosphate
  (E4P), which are used for nucleotide synthesis (essential in the synthesis of aromatic
  amino acids) and defensive chemistry (such as glucosinolates) via the shikimate
  pathway, respectively.
