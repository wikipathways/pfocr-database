caption: Conceptual diagram of the interferon-like antiviral response of Crassostrea
  gigas involving the TLR/NF-κB, RIG-1/MAVS, and putative cGAS/STING signaling pathways
  that result in the transcription of antiviral genes. The oyster genome encodes several
  novel toll-like receptors (TLRs) that lack transmembrane domains, implying they
  have a cytoplasmic function. These novel TLRs and downstream signaling adaptors
  are upregulated in response to OsHV-1 inoculation [,,]. The oyster has a functional
  RIG-1 pathway that senses the presence of cytoplasmic dsRNA (i.e., polyI:C) and
  signals via downstream MAVS and TRAF adaptors []. The transcription factor IRF appears
  to function downstream of oyster MAVS and activates the IFN promoter and IFN stimulated
  response elements (ISRE) in mammalian cells [,]. Activation of IRF and NF-κB results
  in their translocation to the cell nucleus, leading to the transcription of antiviral
  genes. It is not currently known if oysters have a functional cGAS/STING-dependent
  antiviral response (pathway highlighted with grey arrows) []. The oyster genome
  encodes a STING homologue with three N-terminal transmembrane domains followed by
  a STING domain []. Oyster STING binds cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) [] and interacts
  with downstream TBK1 kinase []. Functional assays are required to determine if oyster
  cGAS binds cytosolic DNA and synthesizes CDNs. Note the unusual protein domains
  for RIG-like receptors and STING. Novel RIG-like receptors contain N-terminal death
  domains and novel STING either lack transmembrane domains or contain TIR domains
  []. TIR domain-containing proteins such as TLRs and interleukin-1 receptors are
  known to play key roles in innate immune signaling []. TLR, toll-like receptor;
