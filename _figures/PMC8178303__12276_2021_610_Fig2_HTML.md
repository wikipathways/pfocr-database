caption: a SFTSV transmission to humans commonly occurs from virus-carrying-tick-bite.
  b The SFTSV then invades the lymph node nearest to the tick-bite wound, targeting
  immune cells such as B-cells, impairing host immune response from invading pathogen.
  c After further replication, the virus goes to the systemic circulation, in response
  to viremia, other immune cells are over-stimulated causing cytokine storm and severe
  inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). d Thrombocytopenia is a hallmark of SFTSV
  infection; hence, several mechanisms may be attributed to the decrease of platelet
  count, such as, increase consumption of peripheral platelets from virus-induced
  activation of the coagulation pathway, which may be related to the occurrence of
  disseminated intravascular coagulation or due to endothelial damage from severe
  systemic inflammation, and by clearance of SFTSV-bound-platelet by splenic macrophages.
  e Disseminated intravascular coagulation and endothelial damage caused by cytokine
  storm lead to multi-organ dysfunction, reflected by the elevation of liver, kidney,
  and heart serum markers (Created with BioRender.com).
