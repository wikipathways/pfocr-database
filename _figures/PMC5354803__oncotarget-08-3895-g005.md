caption: HBV-induced oxidative stress promotes liver carcinogenesis via modulation
  of signaling cascades, resistance to ROS-triggered apoptosis, promotion of genome
  instability and metabolic adaptation of infected cells. So far analysis of the mechanisms
  by which HBV-derived ROS drive carcinogenesis are limited predominantly to in vitro
  systems based on HBx overexpression, however some observations have been made in
  biopsy materials. HBx activates proinflammatory NF-κB signaling via ROS generated
  in mitochondria. HBx induces, again in a ROS-dependent manner, the expression of
  cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), which in turn amplifies proinflammatory cytokine signaling.
  Virally-induced ROS also activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway with subsequent induction
  of liver regeneration (ALR) protein, the forkhead transcription factor FOXO4 and
  alterations to the PI3K/AKT pathway. Additional metabolic alterations induced by
  HBx are due to induction of key transcription factors of lipid homeostasis, such
  sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), liver X receptor, C/EBP1
  and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). HBx also induces oxidation
  of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN), which further
  enhances the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, in HCC tissues expression
  of OGG1, a DNA repair enzyme frequently is frequently (over)expressed and methylation
  of the promoter of a runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) gene is augmented.
  RUNX3 is a protein whose inactivation has been implicated in the development of
  various solid tumors. Finally, HBV also causes a ROS-dependent translocation of
  Raf-1 kinase to mitochondria.
