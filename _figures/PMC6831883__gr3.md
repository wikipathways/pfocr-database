caption: Timing Analysis and Its Results for the Citric Acid Cycle(A) Timing analysis.
  To determine the timing of the metabolic change upon H2O2 exposure, multivariate
  adaptive regression splines were fit to each temporal trace (log2[x vs 0 min H2O2])
  of each metabolite.(B) Timing analysis results for the citric acid cycle. Timing
  analysis results for all organisms and conditions considered, for the intermediates
  of the citric acid cycle. The half-time to local maximum t1/2 was not determined
  (1) for spline fits with R2 < 0.2 and (2) if no significant maxima could be identified
  (i.e., peak prominence of Δlog2(FC) < 0.2). Furthermore, following local maxima
  with less than 50% change of log2(FC) were removed.
