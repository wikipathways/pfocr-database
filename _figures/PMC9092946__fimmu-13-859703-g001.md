caption: 'Cellular stress response mechanism. Depicted are intracellular signaling
  pathways involved in the stress response against extracellular and intracellular
  stressors. From top to bottom: Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation
  (ERAD) recognizes misfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces
  their ubiquitinylation for protein degradation through the proteasome. Low cytosolic
  amino acid levels can inhibit the proteasomal degradation through the proteasome
  and further inhibit cell growth and proliferation. Unfolded or misfolded proteins
  within the ER activate BiP, a major chaperone in the initiation of the unfolded
  protein response, that further interacts with (ATF6) and the protein kinase RNA-like
  endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) to induce the UPR, leading to ATF6f and ATF4
  dependent transcriptional modification. In rapidly proliferating cells, MYC dependent
  transcription enriches the cytosol with mRNAs waiting for proper translation on
  ribosomes. Protein folding mistakes can be recognized by the inositol-requiring
  enzyme 1 α (IRE1α), that via splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) induces
  transcriptional modification and thereby lipid and glycose metabolism. The RNase
  domain of IRE1 mediates the cleavage of multiple RNAs in a process known as regulated
  IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) (). c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation may be
  linked to ER stress by IRE1 and autophagy induction after ER stress relies on the
  IRE1-JNK pathway (). The ER is highly involved in calcium homeostasis by acting
  as a calcium storage. Ion-pumps like the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase
  (SERCA) are actively transporting calcium between the cytosol and ER lumen. High
  cytosolic calcium concentration can increase the production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) that further are able to promote NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)
  inflammasome activation which is usually activated by exogenous pathogens, recognized
  by their RNA/DNA on pattern recognition receptors (PRR) like Toll-like receptors
  (TLR) and the involved tissue damage products like ATP that can be recognized by
  purinergic receptors like P2R. Created with BioRender.com.'
