caption: Research progress of disulfidptosis in the TME. (A) In SLC7A11high lung cancer
  cells, KEAP1 mutation is a key factor leading to SLC7A11 overexpression. GLUT inhibitors
  can block the PPP, reducing NADPH production and promoting disulfidptosis. N-acetylcysteine
  and penicillamine can reduce cystine to cysteine extracellularly, or 2-mercaptoethanol
  can convert cysteine to cystine intracellularly, thereby restoring NADPH levels
  and inhibiting disulfidptosis. (B) In the TME, the low arginine environment caused
  by excessive tumor cell absorption activates ATF4 in CD4 + T cells, promoting SLC7A11
  expression and inducing a transient Treg-like phenotype and function in CD4 + T
  cells. Furthermore, low arginine levels also enhance the expression of PD-1 and
  CTLA-4 in CD4 + T cells. KEAP1, kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; TME, tumor microenvironment; NRF2, nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related
  factor 2; ATF4, activating transcription factor-4; GLUT, glucose transporter; NADPH,
  niacinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; SLC7A11, recombinant solute carrier
