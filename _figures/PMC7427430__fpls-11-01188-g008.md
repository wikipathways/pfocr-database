  mites/CiLV-C. The current model integrates the experimental facts obtained in this
  work with those revealed from previous assays of interaction between A. thaliana
  plants and B. yothersi mites (; ), and CiLV-C (). Left and right halves of the diagram
  show hallmarks during the plant interaction with nonviruliferous and viruliferous
  mites, respectively. Left: During feeding, Brevipalpus mites use their stylets to
  pierce mesophyll cells and inject saliva that might contain mite-encoded effectors.
  In response to the interaction with mites, salicylic acid (SA) is accumulated and
  induces SA-dependent genes (e.g.: pathogenesis-related proteins, PRs), which benefit
  mite performance. In parallel, jasmonic acid (JA) is increased, triggering the expression
  of JA-dependent genes such as the ones involved in the synthesis of glucosinolates
  and the markers from the JA pathway VSP2 (vegetative storage protein 2) and PDF1.2
  (plant defensin 1.2). RNA silencing and a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst restricted
  to the few cells affected by mite feeding are also triggered. Plant growth and developmental
  processes are repressed (). Right: Upon plant interaction with viruliferous mites,
  CiLV-C reaches mesophyll cells with mite salivary flow and moves locally to cells
  surrounding inoculation sites. Virus presence intensifies ROS production and the
  SA-mediated response and activates several genes related to cell death and hypersensitive
  response (HR). Those responses are also triggered by the transient expression of
  P61, placing this protein in the epicenter of processes triggering typical HR lesions;
  P61 protein accumulates in the ER membrane, which might cause an ER stress that
  triggers the upregulation of genes related to unfolded protein response (UPR) and
  contribute to the induction of cell death. CiLV-C infection also triggers the induction
  of genes associated with cell growth, which might be involved in hyperplasia and
  hypertrophy processes. JA response is repressed in virus-infected plants, probably
  as a consequence of the antagonism exerted by the increased SA production. Viral
  infection also inhibits the plant primary metabolism, e.g. photosynthesis, likely
  contributing to the development of the chlorosis symptoms. A putative virus suppressor
  of RNA silencing (VSR) may target and inactivate the first antiviral defense line,
  leading to the upregulation of a second line that enhances the RNA silencing activity
  (). Ultimately, as a result of the activation of several defense mechanisms, CiLV-C
  remains restricted to cells around the mite feeding sites, where chlorotic/necrotic
  lesions develop as a probable consequence of an HR-like resulting from an incompatible
  interaction.'
