caption: Regulation of presynaptic Cav channels by GSK-3. Under low GSK-3 conditions
  the interaction of P/Q Cav channels with the SNARE complex is favored and Ca2+ flux
  and neurotransmitter release are enhanced; likewise, N-type Cav channel interaction
  with CPMP-2 is stabilized and axonal growth is stimulated. Opposite effects are
  expected upon high levels of GSK-3 induced, for example, by stimulation of semaphorin
  3A signaling pathway.
