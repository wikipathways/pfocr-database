caption: Schematic illustration of phosphorylation events in central metabolic pathways
  of M. pneumoniae. Of the central metabolic pathways, only glycolysis is operative
  in M. pneumoniae, and a few carbon sources such as glucose, fructose, and glycerol
  can be utilized. Pyruvate can be oxidized to acetate or reduced to lactate. An incomplete
  pentose phosphate pathway serves to generate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate for nucleotide
  biosynthesis. Phosphorylated enzymes are highlighted in gray. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; GPC, glycerophosphorylcholine; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PRPP, phosphoribosyl
  pyrophosphate; P, phosphate.
