caption: Model for glucose-mediated control of cargo recycling. (A) In glucose-rich
  conditions, metabolism of the cell is maintained to promote growth, in part through
  the cAMP synthesis pathway sensed through the GPCR Gpr1 and heterotrimeric G-protein
  alpha subunit, Gpa2. In glucose conditions, we propose that GPA2 expression is suppressed
  via the established glucose repression pathway involving Glc7/Reg1 > Snf1 > Mig1.
  The pheromone signaling and mating pathway, controlled through haploid-specific
  GPCRs Ste2/Ste3, also functions at the PM via the G-protein alpha subunit, Gpa1.
  Gpa1 also has a function at endosomes, with PI3kinase subunits Vps15/Vps34 producing
  PtdIns3P. Surface recycling of PM cargoes is efficient in glucose-replete conditions,
  via an active and efficient recycling pathway from endosomes back to the surface.
  (B) Glucose starvation triggers several metabolic changes, including growth arrest
  sensed via Gpr1. This is accompanied by a reduction in mating response, as the Ste2/3
  receptors are down-regulated. The Glc7 > Snf1 pathway results in dephosphorylation
  and translocation of nuclear repressor Mig1. In consequence, the yeast AP180 clathrin
  adaptors are transcriptionally up-regulated and induce higher levels of internalization
  from the PM. Concomitantly, levels of GPA2 are increased, which we propose act as
  inhibitors of Gpa1-mediated recycling, potentially through sequestering more Gpa1
  at the PM and therefore decamping from PI3K at the endosome and disrupting the lipid
  organization required to efficiently promote recycling.
