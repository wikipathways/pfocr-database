caption: 'Antioxidant mechanisms of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids. Phenolic
  compounds exert antioxidant effects through direct and indirect mechanisms. In direct
  mechanisms: (a) they neutralize free radicals (R·) by donating a hydrogen atom from
  the phenolic hydroxyl group (Ar–OH), resulting in a stabilized phenoxyl radical
  (Ar–O·) and a non-radical product (R–H); (b) some phenolic compounds can chelate
  transition metal ions such as Fe2+, thereby reducing the catalytic formation of
  highly reactive species via Fenton reactions. Indirect mechanisms involve the activation
  of the NRF2 signaling pathway, which upregulates antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide
  dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). SOD catalyzes
  the dismutation of superoxide anion (•O2−) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which
  is further detoxified by CAT and GPx into water (H2O) and oxygen (O2). If not neutralized,
  H2O2 can participate in Fenton reactions, generating hydroxyl radicals (•OH), extremely
  reactive species capable of inducing lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and
  DNA damage, thus amplifying cellular oxidative injury'
