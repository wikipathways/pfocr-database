caption: 'Highly schematicized illustration of deficits in the ubiquitination signaling
  pathway in AD that normally clears waste molecules (such as amyloid peptides) from
  the brain’s extracellular space: initially, a UBE1 enzyme activates, in an ATP-dependent
  manner, the 76 amino acid ubiquitin molecule by forming a high-energy thioester
  bond with ubiquitin; this E1-ubiqutin (UBE1) complex is next transferred to the
  ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UBE2A); a ubiquitin ligase (UBE3) next positions the
  target substrate near the UBE2A enzyme allowing for the sequential transfer of ubiquitin;
  once a chain of four or more ubiquitin molecules is placed onto the substrate protein,
  the molecule is then targeted for proteolysis and degradation by the 26S proteasome;
  large and self-aggregating proteinaceous species (such as amyloids) once formed
  may be more difficult to ubiquitinate, sequester, and degrade []; a ciRS-7-driven
  miRNA-7-mediated lack of UBE2A near the center of this pathway would impair the
  trafficking of amyloid peptides and other neurotoxic end-stage molecules to the
  26S proteasome complex [,,,,,]; note that in sporadic AD ciRS-7 is down-regulated
  () and ambient miRNA-7 is elevated, resulting in the down-regulation of UBE2A expression
  and an impairment at the UBE2A-ub stage (red rectangle) in the normal ubiquitination
  of end-stage molecules; this eventually leads to dysfunction and deficiency in the
  26S proteasome system (downward wavy arrow at right).'
