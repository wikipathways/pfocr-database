caption: A proposed model for crosstalk between the de novo purine metabolic pathway
  and the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signalling pathway in
  Magnaporthe oryzae. Evidence supports a novel crosstalk pathway between de novo
  purine metabolism and cAMP signalling through MoPdeH and xanthosine monophosphate
  (XMP) regulating synergistically the growth and virulence of M. oryzae. GMP, guanosine
  monophosphate; IMP, inosine‐5′‐monophosphate; MPA, mycophenolic acid.
