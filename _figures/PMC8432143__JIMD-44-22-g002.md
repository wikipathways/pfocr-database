caption: 'Mechanisms of action of emerging therapies. Drugs affecting mitochondrial
  biogenesis act on the PGC1α pathway. PGC1α is a master transcriptional coactivator
  of several transcription factors including PPARα,δ,γ, NRF1,2, ERR and TFAM. PGC1α
  is activated by phosphorylation by AMPK and deacetylation by NAD+‐dependent sirtuin,
  and is also controlled by mTOR. Drugs acting on these pathways include AICAR which
  activates AMPK, resveratrol which activates sirtuin, NAD+ modulators and PARP1 inhibitors
  which increase NAD+ levels, rapamycin and ABI009 which act on mTORC1, bezafibrate
  which activates PPARα, REN001 which activates PPARδ, glitazones which activate PPARγ
  and omaveloxolone which activates NRF2. Gene therapy vectors for example, AAVs transduce
  target cells by first being endocytosed at the plasma membrane. The viral genome
  is released in the nucleus where it forms an episome and is transcribed by target
  cell transcriptional machinery. mRNAs are translated in the cytosol. The nascent
  protein contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence which enables entry into mitochondria
  by interacting with the TOM22/TIM23 complex. Nucleoside based trial drugs are currently
  only applicable to one subtype of MDDS, namely thymidine kinase 2 deficiency. Several
  candidate therapies act on pathways related to the production of ROS, such as superoxide
  and hydrogen peroxide. Their intermediates have important cellular signalling functions,
  but also contribute to disease pathophysiology and cell death in mitochondrial disease.
  Levels of ROS are controlled by the glutathione and peroxidoredoxin/thioredoxin
  pathways. EPI743 and idebenone are both CoQ analogues which are thought to affect
  glutathione levels and Sonlicromanol acts on the peroxidoredoxin/thioredoxin pathway.
