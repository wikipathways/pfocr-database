caption: Biosynthesis, transport, and roles of the coenzyme thiamine diphosphate in
  the model plant Arabidopsis. TDP biosynthesis (black) and its roles in the plant
  cell (blue dashed arrows, coenzyme activity) are displayed, with currently uncharacterized
  aspects of the pathways shown in gray. TMP is generated from the condensation of
  HMP-PP and HET-P, catalyzed via TH1 in the chloroplast. HET-P is synthesized by
  THI1 and a NUDIX hydrolase using NAD+, glycine, and a sulfur atom from the THI1
  backbone, which renders this protein inactive as a catalyst for this reaction after
  one cycle (*). HMP-PP is formed from aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) by THIC
  and the phosphorylation activity of TH1. To generate the coenzyme form, TDP, TMP
  is first dephosphorylated to thiamine catalyzed by TH2/PALE1 in the cytosol (or
  mitochondrion) or uncharacterized phosphatases (in the chloroplast or cytosol) before
  phosphorylation to TDP by TPK in the cytosol. TDP has many roles in the cell, including
  in a negative feedback loop whereby TDP regulates thiamine biosynthesis through
  THIC gene expression in the nucleus via a riboswitch. TDP may be transported from
  the cytosol into the plastid via the nucleotide cation symporter 1 (NCS1), and into
  the mitochondrion by thiamine phosphate carriers (TPC1 and TPC2), whereas other
  thiamine vitamer transporters have not yet been characterized, particularly at the
  chloroplast envelope (gray). Enzymes requiring TDP as a coenzyme (dashed arrows)
  take key positions in central metabolism; in the chloroplast, TDP is involved in
  carbon assimilation, acting as a coenzyme for the Calvin cycle enzyme transketolase
  (TK) and for the TDP-dependent enzymes 2-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS)
  and acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) for isoprenoid and branched-chain amino acid
  biosynthesis, respectively. Another TDP-dependent enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH), is involved in lipid biosynthesis in the chloroplast. In the cytosol, TDP-dependent
  enzymes include TK in the pentose phosphate pathway, important for generating NADPH
  and pentoses, and also pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) involved in anaerobic respiration/fermentation.
  In the mitochondrion, the TDP-dependent enzyme PDH is involved in feeding carbon
  into the TCA cycle, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH) is a key enzyme that
  modulates flux through the TCA cycle, affecting the redox, energy, and nitrogen
  balance of the cell. Branched-chain oxy-acid dehydrogenase (BCOADH) is a mitochondrial
  TDP-dependent enzyme complex that is involved in branched-chain amino acid catabolism.
