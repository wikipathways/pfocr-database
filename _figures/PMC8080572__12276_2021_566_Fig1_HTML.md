caption: a Simplified schematic illustration of the VEGF family ligands VEGF-A, -B,
  -C, and -D interacting with their receptors VEGR-1, -2 and -3 to drive lymphangiogenesis
  and angiogenesis. Neuropilin receptors (NRP1 and NRP2) enhance VEGF signaling by
  acting as coreceptors for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. b Angiogenesis, the growth of new
  blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is regulated mainly by the VEGF signaling
  pathway. Growth factors in the VEGF family, such as VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and
  PlGF, as well as other factors, such as the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family,
  angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), and MMPs, are important for the sprouting of new vessels.
  The newly formed blood vessels are initially leaky but over time undergo maturation
  characterized by deposition of BM pericyte and mural cell coverage, regulated by
  pathways such as PDGF-B signaling via PDGFR-B and ANG-1 signaling via Tie2, and
  TGF-β. Mature blood vessels are maintained in a functional state by factors such
  as VEGF-B. Under pathological conditions, such as in the tumor microenvironment,
  these processes are dysregulated, leading to poorly developed vessels that leak
  fluid and form a disorganized vascular network.
