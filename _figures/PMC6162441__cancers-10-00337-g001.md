caption: Oxidative phosphorylation. Aerobic glycolysis metabolizes glucose to lactic
  acid. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) occurs in mitochondria and leads to efficient
  generation of ATP. OXPHOS is an active pathway in tumors and cancer stem cells.
  Several inhibitors or the various subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport
  complexes can serve as candidates for tumor therapy. Prominent drug candidates for
  HGSOC are shown. CytC, Cytochrome C, ETC, Electron Transport Chain, LDH, Lactate
  Dehydrogenase, Q, unbiquinone, QH2, Ubiquinol, TCA, Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle, FADH2,
  Flavine Adenine Dinucleotide, NADH, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide.
