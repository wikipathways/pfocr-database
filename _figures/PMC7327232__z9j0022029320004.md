caption: Membrane receptors on parietal and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells and
  intracellular signaling pathways that regulate gastric acid secretion. Stimulatory
  pathways are indicated in green, and inhibitory pathways are indicated with red
  lines. The parietal cell expresses G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for acid
  secretagogues, including the muscarinic receptor (M3) for acetylcholine, the gastrin
  receptor (CCK2), and the histamine receptor (H2). M3 and CCK2 receptors are coupled
  to G protein Gq that activates phospholipase C (PLC), which leads to intracellular
  Ca2+ release to potentiate acid secretion. Binding of histamine to the H2 receptor
  activates adenylate cyclase (AC) to generate cAMP through Gs signal, which potently
  stimulates H+-K+-ATPase (H/K) activity via cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).
  Histamine release from ECL cells is stimulated by a variety of receptors, including
  CCK2, PAC1, EP4, and the motilin receptors. Several receptors for inhibitors of
  gastric acid secretion are present on parietal cells including GLP-1R, NTS2, IP,
  EP3, CRF2, EGFR, and SST2 receptors. The inhibitory G protein (Gi) suppresses AC
  activities to inhibit cAMP-mediated secretory pathways. Additionally, nitric oxide
  (NO) inhibits acid secretion through the cGMP pathway. Angiotensin-like peptide
  receptor (APJ), activated by parietal cell-derived apelin, exerts both inhibitory
  and stimulatory effects. The H3 histamine receptor, expressed on ECL cells, contributes
  to negative feedback for histamine release.
