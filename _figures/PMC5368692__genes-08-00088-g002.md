caption: 'MYC-dependent metabolic reprograming in immunity As schematically shown
  here, MYC regulates immune cell metabolic reprogramming in different contexts. Colony-stimulating
  factor-1 (CSF-1) induces MYC expression and engages glycolysis and glutaminolysis
  that are required for driving macrophage proliferation. Maturation of DCs relies
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and is associated with Interferon (IFN) mediated
  MYCL upregulation. MYC is a component of the T cell receptor (TCR) mediated transcriptional
  network in T cells and coordinately controls glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) and glutaminolysis to support proliferation and differentiation following
  T cell activation. Upon BCR stimulation, upregulated MYC drives glycolysis, glutaminolysis
  and OXPHOS to support B cell growth and proliferation. MΦ: Macrophages; DC: Dendritic
  cells; BCR: B cell receptor.'
