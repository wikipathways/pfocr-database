caption: The pathogenesis of mononuclear phagocyte system in glomerulus, tubulointerstitium,
  and blood with IgAN. The deposition of Gd-IgA1 and relative immune complex stimulate
  mesangial cells via Fc receptor; therefore, mesangial cells secrete cytokines, which
  can induce macrophage infiltration and immune cell activation in glomeruli and stimulate
  themselves. IL-1, TNF-α, and MIF activated NF-κB pathway and affected cell growth,
  apoptosis, and inflammatory response. The deposition of Gd-IgA1 immune complexes
  and cytokines release of mesangial cells stimulate the macrophages to activate;
  hence, macrophages secrete IL-1, IFN-γ, α-SMA, etc., which can lead to mesangial
  proliferation, extracellular matrix protein, par mesangial destructive lesions with
  segmental lesions, endocapillary proliferative lesions, crescent formation, and
  macroscopic hematuria. The macrophages mediated Hb uptake and induced anti-inflammatory
  pathways by HO-1 synthesis participating in the destruction of the integrity of
  podocytes and through the mesangio-podocytic-tubular crosstalk; the kidney tubules
  are damaged via various cytokines and chemokines. In tubulointerstitium, the IgA1
  immune complexes and Hb can stimulate PTECs to release ROS, MCP-1, IL-1, etc., which
  prompt macrophages to infiltrate tubulointerstitium and secrete cytokines, which
  can facilitate tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubule atrophy, proteinuria, and angiogenesis,
  causing renal function loss. In blood, the monocytes were divided into various subclasses
  including non-classical monocytes (CD14−CD16++), classical monocytes (CD14+CD16−),
  and medial monocytes (CD14+CD16+). Monocytes can release various cytokines in blood,
  which can contribute to renal injury in IgAN.
