caption: A model for the signaling pathways controlling  light-dependent potentiation
  and gamete expulsion in fucoid algae. The  top part of the figure shows a diagrammatic
  section through a  receptacle illustrating the general organization of tissues and  extracellular
  matrix (ECM) in receptacles of P.  compressa. The black blocks on the left of the
  model indicate  those parts of the pathway involved in potentiation and gamete  expulsion,
  respectively. The brackets on the right indicate the  probable sites within the
  receptacle for the events indicated.  Stimulation of pathway components is shown
  by open arrows, and  inhibitors by blocked lines. The photosynthesis-dependent pathway  activates
  under low inorganic carbon (IC) conditions.  Potentiation is prevented by increasing
  [IC] and also by blocking  PSII electron transport with DCMU ().  Potentiation under
  red light (RL) or white light (WL) is blocked in  blue light (BL), independently
  of photosynthetic rate. Protein Tyr  kinase (PTK) activity is required during potentiation.
  Unconfirmed  components of the pathway are shown by a “?,” and possible  pathways
  are shown by broken arrows. Potentiation ultimately  results in movements of K+
  and anions, and the  extracellular matrix provides the osmomechanical forces necessary
  to  cause gamete release from conceptacles. PS, Photosynthesis.
