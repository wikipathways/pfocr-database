caption: The underlying mechanisms of neuroinflammatory mechanisms in the spinal cord
  tissues after DSCI. In the DSCI microenvironment, microglia/macrophages were activated
  and polarized into proinflammatory M1 phenotype and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype.
  The TLR4 pathway is activated after DSCI and promotes inflammatory response. On
  the one hand, TLR4 phosphorylates IκBα through the IKKs, rendering the NF-κB complex
  dimer (mostly p65/p50 dimers) free to translocate to the nucleus. On the other hand,
  the MAPK pathway, including P38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK, is phosphorylated by TLR4 during
  the inflammatory response, thereby activating activator protein (AP)-1. Nuclear
  NF-κB and AP-1 promote transcription of proinflammatory genes such as TNF-α, IL-1β,
  and IL-6 to exacerbate the neuroinflammatory reaction.
