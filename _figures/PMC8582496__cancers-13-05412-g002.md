caption: Canonical TGF-β/BMP signaling network in endothelial cells. TGF-β1 binds
  to the transforming growth factor-β receptor type II (TβRII) that phosphorylates
  the type I receptor (TβRI). In endothelial cells, TGF-β1 induces Smad2/3 phosphorylation
  through TβRI activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) and is potentiated by S-Endoglin
  (S-ENG) (right part of the scheme). On the other hand, TGF-β1 induces Smad1/5/8
  phosphorylation through TβRI activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1)—only in the presence
  of ALK5—and is potentiated by L-Endoglin (L-ENG) (left part). BMP9, the high affinity
  ligand for ALK1, transduces signals through ALK1 and bone morphogenetic protein
  receptor II (BMPRII). BMP9 binds to this receptor complex and activates the Smad1/5/8
  signaling pathway, which regulates the balance between quiescent or activated endothelium
  depending on the cellular context. L-ENG is part of this receptor complex and potentiates
  BMP9-induced effects (middle part). Created with BioRender.com, accessed on 17 October
