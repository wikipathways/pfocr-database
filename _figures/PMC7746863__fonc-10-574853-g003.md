  The dot size represents the log rank test p-value. (C) After filtering the genes
  in primarily enriched pathway terms, the hub gene PPI network was generated. The
  size of the font represents the node degree, and the color of the dots represents
  the closeness-centrality. (D) The network of KEGG pathways was identified using
  the MetaScape database. The sizes of the dots represent the enrichment score.
