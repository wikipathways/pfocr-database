caption: Hijacking of cellular signaling cascades blocks the bactericidal activities
  of phagocytes. Elevation of cAMP concentration in the cytosol of CR3-expressing
  myeloid phagocytes activates a wealth of signaling cascades that converge towards
  ablation of bactericidal activities of phagocytes, such as oxidative burst and phagocytic
  uptake and killing of opsonized bacteria. By an as-yet unknown mechanism, CyaA/cAMP
  signaling inhibits the activity of the Syk kinase and blocks, thereby, CR3 signaling
  triggered by binding of iC3b-opsonized bacteria to the open (extended) CR3 receptor
  []. In parallel, cAMP activates the protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange protein
  directly activated by cAMP (Epac) signaling pathways, interfering with numerous
  physiological signaling processes (see parallel in this issue the in-depth review
  of CyaA-triggered signaling by Novak et al.). In particular, PKA mediates by an
  as yet undefined mechanism the activation of the Src homology domain 2 containing
  protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP) 1 []. This provokes inhibition of ERK1/2 and
  together with Epac-mediated inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) inhibits the assembly
  of the NADPH oxidase, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative
  burst of neutrophils and macrophages [,]. In macrophages, the activation of SHP-1
  yields dephosphorylation of the c-Fos subunit of the transcription factor AP-1 and
  blocks expression of TLR-inducible NO synthase (iNOS), which enables the internalized
  non-opsonized B. pertussis bacteria to evade NO-mediated intracellular killing [,].
  Lastly, activation of SHP-1, inhibition of the pro-survival kinase Akt/PKB and inhibition
  of ERK1/2 act together to abrogate degradation of BimEL. Enhanced BimEL levels then
  activate Bax and trigger apoptosis of macrophages through the mitochondrial pathway
  [].
