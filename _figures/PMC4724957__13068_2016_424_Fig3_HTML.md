caption: Metabolic pathway map of Parachlorella kessleri. The metabolic network was
  reconstructed based on KEGG pathway analysis. Transcriptome analysis under ±sulfur
  conditions is shown near the pathway as a heat map. The left heat map shows RPKM
  values. The right heat map shows fold changes in transcript levels relative to 2-day-old
  TAP culture. If the enzyme is constructed from several subunits, the transcript
  levels are indicated for each subunit within the heat map, as shown in a small separate
  box. Color legends are shown at the bottom right of the map. Gene abbreviations
  are as in Additional file
