caption: BAs promote gastric intestinal metaplasia by upregulating CDX2 and MUC2 expression
  via the FXR/nuclear factor-κB signalling pathway. BAs enter the cell by active transport
  or by diffusion and induce the upregulation and nuclear location of p50/p65 expression.
  Nuclear p50 binds to the CDX2 promoter and promotes CDX2 transactivation. The BA-induced
  increase in FXR expression enhances the binding of p50 to the CDX2 promoter. The
  CDX2 protein then binds to the MUC2 promoter and increases MUC2 transactivation.
  ASBT, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter; BA, bile acid; CDX2, caudal-related
  homeobox transcription factor 2; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; MUC2, mucin 2.
