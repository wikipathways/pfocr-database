caption: Innate immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2Recognition by PRRs triggers a signaling
  cascade that culminates in the transcription and subsequent generation of interferons.
  SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to antagonize these pathways at virtually all stages, indicated
  by red blunt end arrows. Red solid arrows indicate hyperactivated signal cascade
  by SARS-CoV-2. Black solid arrows indicated pathway connection.
