caption: Targeted therapeutic approaches for NF-κB inhibition. NF-κB can induce the
  transcription of various inflammatory and oxidative molecules to facilitate islet
  graft rejection. The NF-κB pathway can be triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokine
  signaling, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)-, danger associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs)-, or reactive oxygen species (ROS)-initiated toll-like receptor
  (TLR)-dependent signals. TLR-signaling activates the MyD88-dependent or MyD88-independent
  signaling pathways, which results in IKK phosphorylation, IκB-α degradation in the
  proteasome, and NF-κB (p50/p65) nuclear translocation. Small molecule inhibitors
  like TJ-M2010-6 can prevent MyD88 activation and IκB-α degradation (A). Resveratrol
  inhibits the phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear localization of the NF-κB p65
  subunit to prevent transcription (B). Signaling from cytokines like interleukin
  1 beta (IL-1β) have been targeted through the use of monoclonal antibodies including
  anti-IL-1 canakinumab (C), which blocks binding of IL-1β to its receptor, and the
  use of IL-1R antagonist anakinra to block signaling through the receptor (D). The
  IKK complex is a target for NF-κB inhibition. Specifically, inhibition of IKKβ and
  NEMO complex formation by withaferin A can prevent the phosphorylation and release
  of IκB-α (E).
