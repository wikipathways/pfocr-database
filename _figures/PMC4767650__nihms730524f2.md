caption: The intrinsic cell death pathway is initiated by an intracellular death signal.
  This signal results in the oligomerization and translocation of Bax and Bak into
  the outer membrane of the mitochondria. This triggers mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization (MOMP) and the release of cytochrome c and IAP binding proteins.
  Cytochrome c forms the apoptosome with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9, which results in
  cell death. The IAP binding proteins, such as Smac, bind to XIAP and antagonize
  the caspase-binding function of XIAP. The extrinsic cell death pathway is receptor-mediated
  and results in the formation of the death inducing signaling complex (DISC). In
  certain cells, the DISC can directly activate downstream caspases, leading to cell
  death. However, in most cells, the DISC, through its caspase-8 component, cleaves
  Bid to form tBid, leading to Bax/Bak oligomerization, MOMP, apoptosome formation,
  and subsequent cell death.
