caption: Inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase by N-BP prevents the biosynthesis
  of isoprenoid lipids required for normal protein prenylation (step 1). Lack of prenylation
  leads to enhanced inflammasome activation and increased IL-1β release in response
  to bacterial endotoxin, boosting the initial inflammatory response and pathogen
  clearance. Lack of isoprenoid biosynthesis may also hinder the propagation of intracellular
  pathogens that depend on the host cells' mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of FPP synthase
  by N-BP causes the accumulation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP)/dimethylallyl diphosphate
  (DMAPP) phosphoantigens (step 2) capable of triggering activation and proliferation
  of human Vγ9VδT cells with antimicrobial activity. Inhibition of FPP synthase by
  N-BP may also mimic the endogenous antiviral effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC),
  one of the routes by which IFN signalling suppresses the flux through the mevalonate
  pathway.
