caption: SRM-based quantification of a protein network in three prostate cancer cell
  lines, DU145, LNCaP and PC-3, at four time points post-treatment with docetaxel
  and in untreated controls in comparison to mRNA abundance changes. The microarray-derived
  functional network was visualized with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The structure
  of the network is based on the IPA Core Analysis, STRING and Pathway Commons derived
  direct interactions and indirect relationships. Each heatmap visualizes the log2
  abundance change of treated versus control cells for each time in each cell line
  at the transcript (mRNA) and protein (SRM) level. The signal represents the mean
  result from two technical replicates at the transcript level and three SRM analyses
  per sample. See also  and .
