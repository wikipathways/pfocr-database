caption: A model for the role lamins A/C play in repair of DNA DSBs by HR. In the
  cell, lamins A/C bind to RAD51 to promote its stability and protect it from proteasome-mediated
  degradation. After formation of DNA DSBs, RAD51 is speculated to undergo post-translational
  modification and be released from lamins A/C which enables it to mobilize to sites
  of damage and enhance HR. Lamins A/C are involved in HR where they play an important
  role in transcriptional regulation and increased expression of BRCA1 and RAD51,
  both key proteins essential in this repair pathway. In addition, increased expression
  of BRCA1 promotes the removal of 53BP1 in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle leading
  to decreased NHEJ. This model is based on studies and models proposed by a number
  of investigators.,,,,, (A color version of this figure is available in the online
  journal.)
