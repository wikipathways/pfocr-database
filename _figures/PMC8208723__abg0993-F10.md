caption: DSBs induce IPT3 and IPT5 in shoots and CYP735A2 and LOG7 in roots through
  the ATM-SOG1 pathway. Around the transition zone, conversion from iP- to trans-zeatin–type
  cytokinins and the final activation step of cytokinin biosynthesis are enhanced,
  resulting in an increase of active cytokinins. Elevated cytokinin signaling up-regulates
  SHY2 and suppresses PIN1, PIN3, and PIN4 expression, thereby inhibiting downward
  auxin flow and reducing the auxin level in the meristematic zone. This leads to
  G2 arrest of dividing cells and stem cell death. Increased cytokinin signaling also
  up-regulates CCS52A1 around the boundary between the meristematic zone and the transition
  zone and promotes degradation of mitotic cyclins, triggering an early onset of endoreplication.
  The combinatorial effect of G2 arrest and an early transition from cell division
  to endoreplication causes meristem size reduction. TZ, transition zone; MZ, meristematic
  zone.
