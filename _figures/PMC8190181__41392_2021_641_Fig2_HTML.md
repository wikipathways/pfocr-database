caption: TGF-β signaling pathway-mediated crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells.
  The canonical TGF-β signaling pathways consist of TGF-β/Activin/Nodal-Smads pathway
  and bone morphogenetic protein/growth differentiation factor/Müllerian-inhibiting
  substance (BMP/GDF/MIS)-Smads pathway. Noncanonical pathways represent those that
  activate TGF-βR, but induce no-Smads pathway. Within tumor microenvironment (TME),
  a large number of TGF-β protein secreted by cancer cells mediated the transformation
  of NFs into CAFs supporting cancer progression by activation TGF-β signaling pathway,
  particularly canonical pathway. Activated CAFs can be orchestrated by TME to maintain
  their status and promote their proliferation and migration. In turn, these adaptations
  would also be contributed to the formation of tumor-promoting TME. CAF-secreted
  factors regulated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling to accelerate cancer invasion
  and metastasis indirectly. On the other hand, most factors derived from CAFs can
  directly mediate intricate regulation on the cancer cells. Most proteins, such as
  ECM proteins, GDF, TGF-β, IL-11, and CXCL12, could activate the pathway of cancer
  cells to exert biological functions, including promoting cancer growth, migration,
  invasion, and metastasis, through receptor–ligand binding. Genetic information would
  also transfer from CAFs into cancer cells by extracellular vehicles. CAF-derived
  exosomal miR-93 and miR-423 would be endocytosed by cancer cells and then promoted
  cancer chemoresistance and radioresistance. FOXA1 forkhead box protein A1, MMP2
