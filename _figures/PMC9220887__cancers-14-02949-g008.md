caption: Putative mechanism for synergistic cytotoxicity between CB-5083 and mifepristone.
  Treatment with VCP inhibitor-CB-5083 activates the activating transcription factor
  6 (ATF6) branch and the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)
  branch. Activation of ATF6 can result in the induction of glucose-regulated protein
  78 (Grp78). Induction of Grp78 is considered a pro-survival response. Similarly,
  PERK activation can ultimately induce CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous
  protein (CHOP). Enhanced expression of CHOP can be a pro-apoptotic response. Mifepristone
  treatment inhibits the ATF6 branch and enhances CHOP expression through the activation
  of the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase pathway. The combination of these two
  effects could result in the enhanced cytotoxicity seen with CB-5083 and mifepristone
  combination.
