caption: The different effects of FXR on macrophages and mast cells in an inflammatory
  response. (A) When bile acid metabolism is abnormal, macrophages are induced to
  the M1 type, which can promote inflammation and inhibit the regulation of FXR on
  NLRP3 inflammasome and MCP-1. However, in a normal bile acid metabolism, macrophages
  are polarized into the M2 type, which can inhibit inflammation and promote the regulation
  of FXR on NLRP3 inflammasome and MCP-1. (B) When bile acid metabolism is dysregulated,
  the infiltration of liver mast cells increases along with the increased release
  of histamine, which can promote the activity of FXR in liver mast cells. This leads
  to the activation of intestinal FXR/FGF15 signal under the action of enterohepatic
  circulation, and the infiltration of intestinal mast cells also increases. Activated
  FXR promotes the P38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, causing MCs to release more NGF,
  a mediator that can damage tight junctions in the gut, leading to a breakdown of
  the intestinal barrier and increased inflammatory response.
