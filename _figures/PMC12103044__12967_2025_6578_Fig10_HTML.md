caption: Examples of eExo for promoting chronic wound healing. A The co-incubation
  of hUCSC-exo and miR-181c endows eExo with elevated level of miR-181c. MiR-181c
  can interact with TLR4 mRNA, alleviating TLR4 signaling pathway and downstream NF-κB
  signaling pathway in macrophages, subsequently reducing burn-induced inflammation.[97]
  B The utilization of electroporation encapsulates miR-31-5p mimics into milk-derived
  exosomes (mEXO-31). MiR-31-5p can interact with HIFIAN mRNA and decrease the expression
  of HIFIAN protein, displaying pro-angiogenic activity.[158] C eExo derived from
  long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19-transfected MSC can suppress apoptosis and inflammation
  and stimulate the diabetic wound healing process in vivo via the lncRNA H19/miR-152-3p/PTEN
  axis.[172] D EXPLOR system is applied to produce eNOS-enriched UCSC-derived exosomes.
  As results, eNOS-enriched eExo can enhance cellular antioxidant capacity, neovascularization,
  and matrix remodeling while alleviating apoptosis and inflammation via multipathway
  activation, ultimately accelerating wound closure and preventing skin scarring.[177]
