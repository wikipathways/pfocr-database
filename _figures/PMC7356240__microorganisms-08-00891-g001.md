caption: 'Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) mediates immune response crosstalk
  in dengue pathogenesis. (A) Dengue virus (DENV) infection induces MIF expression
  and secretion in epithelial cells. MIF facilitates dengue virus (DENV) replication
  through stimulating autophagy. (B): a. DENV infection enhances vascular permeability
  by disrupting the distribution of the endothelial tight junction protein zonula
  occludens-1 (ZO-1) through MIF-activated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase-extracellular signal–regulated kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (PI3K/MEK-ERK/JNK) signaling pathways; DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) causes
  disarray of the endothelial tight junction through MIF-induced autophagy, b. DENV
  NS1-induced MIF secretion triggers the release of heparanase 1 (HPA-1) and metalloproteinase
  9 (MMP-9), enhancing glycocalyx shedding from endothelial cells. (C): a. DENV infection
  stimulates thrombomodulin (TM) expression in monocytes through upregulation of the
  MIF signaling pathway, which disrupts the function of coagulation factors, b. DENV/DENV
  NS1 stimulates neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation in activated neutrophils,
  c. MIF regulates the interaction of leukocytes and activated platelets in DENV infection,
  which promotes the release of more inflammatory cytokines and permeability-enhancing
  factors.'
