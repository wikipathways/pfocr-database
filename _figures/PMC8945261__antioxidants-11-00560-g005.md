caption: Schematic representation of the metabolic pathway used by P. fluorescens
  to combat sulfur starvation. The dicarboxylic acid is regenerated into KG by SSADH
  and KGDC. The enzymes ICL and FRD contribute to the succinate pool of succinate
  while GDC and GABAT maintain SSA homeostasis. ICL = isocitrate lyase, FRD = fumarate
  reductase, SSADH = succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, SDH = succinate dehydrogenase,
  KGDC = α-ketoglutarate decarboxylase, GABAT = GABA transaminase, GDC = glutamate
  decarboxylase, GDH = glutamate dehydrogenase, KG = α- ketoglutarate, SSA = succinate
  semialdehyde.  = Cycle producing KG from glutamate,  = Regeneration of KG from succinate,
  the product of ROS detoxification.
