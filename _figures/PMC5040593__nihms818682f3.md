caption: Four pathways for double-stranded break (DSB) repair.Nascent DSBs are first
  recognized by ATM and the MRN complex that initiate a series of DNA damage response
  events that aim at arresting cell cycle and recruiting DSB repair proteins. The
  C-NHEJ pathway is triggered by direct binding of Ku70/80 protein to DSB ends, followed
  by the recruitment of DNA-PKcs, Artemis, DNA ligase 4, XRCC4, and XLF. For cells
  in the S and G2 phase, DSBs can undergo limited end resection, followed by an extended
  end resection that leads to primarily HR repair but sometimes SSA repair. HR repair
  requires a core factor, RAD51, and several cofactors, including RAD51 paralogues,
  BRCA2, and nucleostemin (NS). Alternatively, the exposed 3′ ends of DSBs may be
  directly ligated by an Alt-NHEJ mechanism that is initiated by PARP1 and followed
  through by WRN, DNA ligase 3/XRCC1, and DNA ligase1. See text for more abbreviations.
