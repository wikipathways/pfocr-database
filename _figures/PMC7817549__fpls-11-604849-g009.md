caption: 'Simplified representation of KEGG flavonoid pathway. Enzymes identified
  in protein modules are highlighted in red according to their response within each
  genotype and protein-module assessed. Resistant-R3 and susceptible-S4 genotypes
  are indicated with square and circle shapes, respectively. Protein modules were
  represented by their module colors. e.c. numbers correspond to: e.c. 5.5.1.6—chalcone-flavanone
  isomerase; e.c. 1.14.20.6—flavonol synthase; e.c. 2.3.1.74—chalcone synthase; e.c.
  2.3.1.133—shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase. Enzymes and related precursors
  and products, which are not present in “R” and “S” protein modules, were removed.'
