caption: 'Molecular pathways and effectors susceptible to the proposed treatments
  with salicylic acid and 2,6-dichloro-isonicotinic acid. (I) SA upregulates PAL activity
  at three stages: PAL mRNA accumulation, PAL protein synthesis and phenolic compound
  accumulation. PAL involvement in synthesis of endogenous SA could accelerate the
  treatment effects. SA could also induce JA synthesis via a non-canonical pathway.
  (II) SA activation of SOD, GR and GST as well as its effect on downregulation of
  AO could alleviate oxidative stress associated with tobamovirus infections. (III)
  SA induced PAL could have a major effect on the phenylpropanoid pathway associated
  with ROI scavenging, thereby reducing oxidative stress, as well as instigation of
  systemic acquired resistance. Co-treatments with 2,6-dichloro-isonicotinic acid
  and SA, which additively activate systemic acquired resistance against tobamoviruses,
  could strengthen the SA effects. SA salicylic acid, PAL phenylalanine ammonia lyase,
  JA jasmonic acid, SOD superoxide dismutase, GR glutathione reductase, GST glutathione
