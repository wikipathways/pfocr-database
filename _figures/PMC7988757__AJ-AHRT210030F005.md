caption: 'Targets for future study: putative mechanisms by which mechanistic target
  of the rapamycin (mTOR) influences the development of the pulmonary vasculature
  and peripheral airways. mTORC1 influences elongation and branching of the conducting
  airways in the fetal lung and, through its interaction with the hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF1α) signaling pathway, temporally and spatially unifies the airway branching
  morphogenesis program to pulmonary vascular development. 1) airway branching is
  induced by the mesoderm-derived fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10) binding to
  a tyrosine kinase receptor, FGFR2b, expressed in cells at the leading end of endodermal
  airway tube and ahead of prospective airway branches. Reduced FGFR2b activity stabilizes
  and inactivates sprouty 2 (Spry2). Spry2 inactivation, in turn, suppresses airway
  elongation and stimulates branching epithelial growth through the repression of
  mTORC1 activity and enhanced ERK1/2 activity, the latter of which enhances angular
  cell division. 2) conversely, enhanced FGFR2b activity within airway epithelial
  cells promotes tubular outgrowth toward the FGF-10 signal by increasing epithelial
  mTORC1 activity and, therefore, proliferative growth. 3) vasculogenesis in the fetal
  lung is initiated through the activation of a mTORC1-HIF1α complex and, in turn,
  increased vascular endothelial factor A (VEGFA) transcription and secretion from
  advancing airway epithelial cells (, ). FGF-10 is expressed in the mesenchyme ahead
  of nascent airway buds and diffuses towards the airway epithelium. FGF-10 induces
  autophosphorylation and signaling to Spry2 whose activation induces tuberin (TSC2)
  clearance enabling Rheb to bind GTP and activate mTORC1. HIF1α is regulated through
  the FGF-10-Spry2-mTORC1 signaling axis by a direct interaction involving the putative
  mTOR signaling (TOS) motif located within the N-terminus of HIF1α ().'
