caption: 'Receptor and metabolic pathways determining FASIS. (A) Receptor component
  of stimulation is emphasized. (B) Metabolic component is emphasized. When present
  in islets capillaries, for example, in incoming chylomicrons, FAs are cleaved by
  lipoprotein lipase (ATGL being the most specific β-cell isoform) and may either
  (A) act via receptor pathways to stimulate the GPR40 metabotropic receptor (), in
  parallel with the second product of the cleavage, MAG, which signals via GPR119.
  Alternatively, (B) the metabolic pathway begins by FA import into the cell by the
  CD36 transporter and by ACSL conversion to acyl-CoAs. As for (A), the activation
  of both receptors leads to CaV-mediated action potential spikes and concomitant
  pulsatile insulin secretion. GPR40 acts via the Gαq/11, thus activating PLC, which
  leads to IP3 and DAG release (for DAG downstream pathway, see @). IP3 activates
  additional Ca2+ efflux from the ER via the IP3R, which is initiated either by the
  preceding CaV opening () or by PLC-TRPC-induced Ca2+ efflux from the ER (). The
  most prominent pathway downstream of DAG involves the PKC-mediated phosphorylation
  of TRPM4 and TRPM5 to activate them. As a result, together with TRPM2, activated
  by Ca2+ and H2O2, these channels strengthen the necessary shift to −50 mV depolarization
  at the 100% closed KATP ensemble. The KATP closure is ensured by the metabolic component
  of FASIS (B). The two components are mutually interrelated since the canonical GPR119
  signaling and the biased GPR40 signaling leads to the cAMP-mediated activation of
  the PKA and EPAC2 pathways (, , ). PKA phosphorylates the CaVβ2 subunit to activate
  it, phosphorylates KATP (see legend of ) and inhibits Kv channels, which prolongs
  the already more intensive Ca2+ influx (). Snapin, which allows IGV docking to the
  plasma membrane, is also PKA-phosphorylated, enabling initiation of the snapin SNARE
  complex with a lipid-anchored protein, the SNAP-25 (). The EPAC2 pathway is based
  on its guanine nucleotide exchange activity. This induces further TRPM2 activation
  (), regulates KATP () plus priming of the interaction of Rim2a with Munc13-1, required
  for the syntaxin 1 interaction of IGV [which activates IGV exocytosis ()] and, finally,
  the activation of RyR- mediated Ca2+ efflux from the ER (). FAs imported by CD36
  are converted to acyl-CoAs by AcylCoA-synthetase (ACSL), whereas CAT1 converts acyl-CoAs
  to acyl-carnitines (). The carnitine carrier (SLC25A20) imports acylcarnitines into
  the matrix, exchanging them for carnitine. The matrix CAT2 converts acyl carnitines
  to acyl-CoAs, which is followed by FA β-oxidation (see also ). As described in the  section,
  all the benefits of activation also occur for mitochondrial metabolism, that is,
  activations upon GSIS and its receptor-mediated amplification (cf. ). Also, similar
  redox signaling due to the increased superoxide formation upon FA β-oxidation occurs
  during the metabolic branch of FASIS, as with BCKA-stimulated insulin secretion
  (cf. ). Elevated ATP from OXPHOS fortified by FA β-oxidation and elevated cytosolic
  H2O2 due to the increased H2O2-release from the matrix close the KATP channel (possibly
  also TRPM2), as they do upon GSIS. Overactivation of GPR40: pathways (A, B) are
  also interconnected because of the intramitochondrial redox signaling [elevated
  matrix superoxide/H2O2 due to FA β-oxidation () directly activates mitochondrial
  phospholipase iPLA2γ/PNPLA8 (, , )]. The phospholipase iPLA2γ cleaves both saturated
  and unsaturated FAs from the phospholipids of mitochondrial membranes. The cleaved
  free FAs diffuse up to the plasma membrane, where they activate GPR40 (). FASIS
  in iPLA2γ-knockout mice or its isolated islets yields ∼30% insulin in the first
  fast phase of insulin secretion compared with wt mice (Holendová et al., unpublished
  data). This supports the existence of such an acute mechanism in vivo. Overactivation
  of GPR119: FASIS in the presence of high [glucose] (which by itself would stimulate
  GSIS) also involves the so-called glycerol/FA cycle combining simultaneous lipogenesis
  and lipolysis, as suggested by Prentki et al. (). Enzymes involved in this cycle
  are described in the legend of . An important intermediate of the glycerol/FA cycle
  is 1,2-DAG, which initiates PKC signaling (and TRPM4,5 activation) and activates
  Munc13-1 to facilitate IGV exocytosis. Moreover, created MAGs (* indicates its diffusion
  toward GPR119) can diffuse to the plasma membrane and overactivate the GPR119 receptor
