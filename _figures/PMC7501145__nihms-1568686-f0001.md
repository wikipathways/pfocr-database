caption: Model of APC transporter regulation (see  for descriptions of the various
  proteins). A) Cell surface expression of APC transporters is regulated by the metabolism
  of the cell. AMPK is activated by low energy levels which increases APC transporter
  downregulation by regulating eisosomes and ART adaptors. Furthermore, high nutrient
  levels (e.g. amino acids) cause APC transporter degradation by stabilizing the inward-open
  conformation of the corresponding transporter. Glucose transporters (MFS transporters)
  are not proton driven and are regulated by AMPK in opposite way compared to the
  APC transporters (low energy levels stabilize these transporters). B) Stress conditions
  such as heat-shock, hypoosmotic shock, high pH or the presence of hydrophilic compounds
  increase fluidity of the plasma membrane, which results in the disassembly of the
  eisosome membrane domain (eisosome flattening). As a result of high membrane fluidity,
  APC transporters are highly active (even in absence of substrate), resulting in
  efficient ubiquitination and degradation of these transporters. In addition, eisosome
  flattening activates the TORC2-mediated stress response pathway.
