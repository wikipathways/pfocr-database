caption: Pathogenetic view of WD. (A) Absorbed copper binds to albumin for transport
  via portal blood to hepatocytes, where it enters through the plasma membrane-localized
  copper transporter (CTR1). Within the cell it is immediately deposited bound to
  MT. The so-called antioxidant protein 1 (ATOX1) serves as chaperone for delivery
  to the TGN, where ATP7B transports copper into the lumen for binding to apo-ceruloplasmin
  (Apo-CP) which as copper-loaded ceruloplasmin (Cu-CP) is excreted to blood (main
  copper bound protein in blood). A second vesicular pathway directs copper from the
  TGN to bile, also mediated by ATP7B. (B) In WD ATP7B is lacking prohibiting TGN
  directed transfer of copper to ceruloplasmin and bile. Consequently, copper is intermediately
  accumulated in the stimulated MT pool, from where it is deposited in lysosomes.
  (C) In the destructive phase the copper-loading capacity of lysosomes is exceeded.
  They burst and release there acidic, free copper-loaded content to cytosol which
  results in cellular damage and finally cell death. This causes the release of cellular
  free copper to blood. It is bound loosely to albumin and delivered to other organs,
  particularly to the brain. There cellular damage occurs via free radical injury.
