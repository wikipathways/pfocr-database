caption: Two major signaling pathways activated by HBV and HCV in hepatocarcinogenesis.
  Cytosolic β-catenin is normally phosphorylated by a complex of adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC), Axin, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β(GSK3β) and then degraded by the
  proteasome (dotted lines). Increased Wnt expression by HCV core protein activates
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway. GSK3β, APC, Axin complex is dissociated by Dishevelled and
  this results in the accumulation of cytosolic and nuclear β-catenin, which interacts
  with T-cell factor (TCF) and lymphoid enhancer binding protein (Lef), leading to
  the expression of target genes that stimulate liver cell proliferation. (A) HBx
  protein inactivates GSK3β via Src. This inactivation eventually results in the accumulation
  of nuclear β-catenin and increases the expression of genes involved in liver cell
  proliferation. (B) HCV NS5a protein interacts with p85. This interaction leads to
  the activation of Akt. Activated Akt phosphorylates Bad and decreases apoptosis
  of liver cells. At the same time, Akt phosphorylates GSK3β, thereby preventing proteasomal
  degradation of β-catenin. (C) HBx protein increases the cytosolic calcium level,
  leading to activation of the Ras-Raf-ERK and Ras-MEKK-JNK cascades. AP-1, activator
  protein-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1;
  JNK, jun, N-terminal kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. (Modified from
