  metabolic molecule between uninfected and infected children with the rotavirus P[8]
  strain associated with HBGA combined secretor/Le(a+b+). Solid black arrows represent
  molecular interaction. The dotted black arrows indicate indirect link of metabolites
  with metabolic pathway. Red lines represent metabolites associated with amino acid
  metabolism (highlited in blue) and lipid metabolism (highlited in light pink)
