caption: 'Disease and biological function analysis of the differentially expressed
  metabolites and proteins using IPA. IPA (QIAGEN Redwood City, CA, USA, http://www.qiagen.com/ingenuity)
  was used for the integrated analysis of metabolite and protein data. The color of
  each node (metabolites or proteins) indicates a change in the expression: red (upregulated)
  and green (downregulated). The edges indicate the predicted relationship between
  nodes and biological function: orange representing activation, blue representing
  inhibition, gray representing effect not predicted. The cogwheel and blue cross
  shapes represent each biological function: orange representing activation, and blue
  representing inhibition. IPA, ingenuity pathway analysis; GLU, clusterin; FN1, fibronectin
