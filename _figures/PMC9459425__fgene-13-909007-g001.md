caption: 'Representative diagram of cold responsive signaling pathway in plants. Plants
  sense cold/freezing signals through membrane receptor (RLK and LRR-RLK) and membrane
  rigidification. Cold sensing activates calcium channels (CNGC/GRL) that lead to
  increase Ca2+ in cytoplasm, which in turn activates of Ca2+ related protein likases
  (CaM, CML, CDPKs, and CBLs) and downstream signaling including MAPK signaling. These
  signaling cascades finally interacts with ICE1 and controls expression of CBFs/COR
  genes. COR genes encode proteins required for the biosynthesis of osmoprotectants,
  cryoprotectants, protein kinases, lipid, hormone, and stress-responsive proteins
  that are directly involved in cold tolerance. In addition, COR gene-dependent responses
  involve expression of diverse cold-induced transcription factors, which regulates
  CBFs expression in either positive or negative manner. The cold/freezing stress
  and increased Ca2+ activates the NADPH to generate more ROS. ROS and Ca2+ regulate
  each other’s concentration, and this cross talk controls the expression of defense
  gene in the nucleus. Cold/freezing stress also triggers NO synthesis that is essential
  for cold acclimation response through CBF dependent manner. In another cold signaling
