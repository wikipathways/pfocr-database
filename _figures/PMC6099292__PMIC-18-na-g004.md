caption: Lysosomal and endocytic pathways are enriched with upregulated proteins or
  protein ubiquitylation in PC9/GR cells. A) The lysosomal pathway was significantly
  overpresented with upregulated proteins. B) Lysosomal and endocytosis pathways were
  significantly overpresented with upregulated protein ubiquitylation in PC9/GR cells.
  Proteins with upregulated (red), downregulated (dark green), or similar (light green)
  expression or ubiquitylation (red) in PC9/GR cells are shown.
