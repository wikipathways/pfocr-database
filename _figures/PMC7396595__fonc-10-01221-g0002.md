caption: (A) In the absence of co-stimulation, typically in a T lymphocyte that has
  not been exposed to antigen yet (naive T cell), GSK3β is constitutively active and
  phosphorylates NFAT2. Phosphorylated NFAT2 exits the nucleus and does not induce
  expression of target genes. Additionally, GSK3β phosphorylates CBLB, an inhibitor
  of TCR. Phosphorylated CBLB is protected from degradation. (B) In the presence of
  co-stimulation, typically when an APC presents a peptide to a CD4+ T cell, the second
  signal initiated by CD28 activates the PI3K/AKT pathway which phosphorylates and
  inactivates GSK3β. In these conditions, NFAT2 is not phosphorylated, enters the
  nucleus and induces transcription of genes like TBX21 and IL2 which promote T cell
  activation and proliferation. Also, CBLB is degraded in a de-phosphorylated state
  and no longer inhibits TCR. Finally, the GTPase GIMAP5 can independently inhibit
  GSK3β. (C) PD-L1 is phosphorylated by GSK3β and marked for degradation in the proteasome
  of cancer cells. (D) Summary of GSK3β inhibitor effects in the tumor immune microenvironment
  highlighting both immunogenic and immunosuppressive possibilities. Created with
  BioRender.
