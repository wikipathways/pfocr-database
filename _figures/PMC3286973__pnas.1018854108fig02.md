caption: Cell-line subtypes have unique SuperPathway network features. In all panels,
  each node represents a pathway “concept” corresponding to a protein (circle), a
  multimeric complex (hexagon), or an abstract cellular process (square). Node sizes
  are drawn in proportion to the DA score; larger nodes correspond to concepts more
  correlated with a particular subtype than with all other subtypes. Color indicates
  whether the concept is correlated positively (red) or negatively (blue) with the
  subtype of interest. Lines represent interactions, including protein–protein interactions
  (dashed lines) and transcriptional interactions (solid lines). Interactions are
  included if they connect concepts whose absolute level of DA is higher than the
  mean absolute level. Labels on some nodes are omitted for clarity. (A) An ERK1/2
  subnet preferentially activated in basal breast cancer cell lines. (B) A MYC/MAX
  network activated in claudin-low cell lines. (C) A FOXA1/FOXA2 network up-regulated
  in the luminal subtype. (D) A CTNNB1 subnet down-regulated in the ERBB2AMP subtype.
