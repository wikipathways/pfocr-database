caption: Activation of sphingolipid signaling by FTY720 during wound healing after
  palatal injury. Representative graph of the sphingolipid signaling pathway. Pathway
  analysis of RNA sequencing from palate mucosa treated immediately after injury with
  or without FTY720 scaffolds revealed that the sphingolipid signaling pathway (KEGG
  Database-map04071) was activated by the FTY720 local delivery. In the graph, the
  genes annotated in the orange box indicate that they were upregulated and the genes
  in the blue box were downregulated by FTY720
