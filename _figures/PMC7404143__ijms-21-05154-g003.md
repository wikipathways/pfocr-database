caption: Endothelial cell NRP2-mediated signalling pathways. (a) NRP2 may positively
  regulate EndoMT by directly binding to TGFβ1 and complexing with TGFBR1 []. (b)
  NRP2 interacts with VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 to promote migration and survival induced
  by VEGF-A and VEGF-C []. NRP2 has also been found to interact with VEGF-D []. The
  sprouting response of lymphatic ECs to VEGF-C is mediated by NRP2 complexing with
  VEGFR-3 []. (c) VEGF/NRP2 signalling facilitates α6β1 integrin engagement with ECM
  components. Signalling through this integrin activates a FAK/ERK driven signalling
  resulting in EC migration, sprouting and lymphangiogenesis [] (d) NRP2 complexes
  with Plexins to drive SEMA3 driven R-Ras signalling leading to loss of EC-ECM/VSMC
  adhesion which leads to increased vascular permeability [,]. NRP2/Sema3F/Plexin
  A1 inhibits PI-3K and mTORC signalling attenuating EC proliferation and survival
  []. The NRP2/SEMA3/Plexin complexes are implicated in downregulating angiogenesis
  and lymphangiogenesis, while promoting vascular permeability [,,,,,,]. (e) NRP2
  binding to ANGPTL4 drives the activation of the RhoA/ROCK signalling pathway to
  facilitate breakdown of EC-EC junctions and thus increase permeability [].
