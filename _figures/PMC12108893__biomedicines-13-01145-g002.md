caption: During the process of glucose metabolism reprogramming in urothelial carcinoma
  (UC), the oxygen-dependent hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and the oxygen-independent
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway drive the metabolic reprogramming in UC by regulating
  the activity of rate-limiting enzymes or transporters. Glucose is absorbed by cells
  through glucose transporters (GLUT) 1 and 3. The glycolysis process begins with
  hexokinase (HK) phosphorylating glucose to form glucose-6-phosphate, thereby preventing
  glucose from diffusing out of the cell. Glucose-6-phosphate can be dehydrogenated
  by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) to enter the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP), producing pentoses such as ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis, as
  well as the NADPH required for reduction processes like lipid biosynthesis. If glucose-6-phosphate
  is not oxidized by G6PD, it will be isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucose
  isomerase (PGI). Subsequently, phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the phosphorylation
  of fructose-6-phosphate to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, irreversibly directing
  glucose-derived metabolites towards the glycolysis pathway, towards phosphoenolpyruvate.
  At the end of the glycolysis pathway, pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the dephosphorylation
  of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to produce pyruvate. Pyruvate is then metabolized into
  lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Lactate is transported out of the cell by
  monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1 and 4, resulting in an increase in extracellular
  lactate concentration and acidification of the tumor microenvironment. Additionally,
  pyruvate can also be metabolized into acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which participates
  in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, producing ATP and intermediate
  metabolites that are essential for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis
