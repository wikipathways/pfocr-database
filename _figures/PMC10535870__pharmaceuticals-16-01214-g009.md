caption: The mechanisms by which topiramate protected against cadmium-induced cognitive
  deficits. Herein, topiramate ameliorated cadmium-evoked memory and learning deficits
  by dampening hippocampal neurotoxic signals, including Aβ42 and p-tau and counteracting
  the neurtranmitter aberrations. These events were mediated by (A) activation of
  the hippocampal SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 cascade and attenuation of neuronal pro-oxidative
  events. (B) AMPK/mTOR pathway stimulation with an enhancement of the autophagy response.
  (C) Dampening of hippocampal apoptotic cell death. In the figure, solid arrows represent
  activation, whereas blunt arrows represent inhibition.
