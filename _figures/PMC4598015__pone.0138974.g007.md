caption: 'The most differentially expressed signaling-related proteins were integrated
  and marked in red (up-regulated) or green (down-regulated). The blue region in the
  middle represented the cross-talk pathway shared by both the salt and drought responses.
  The calcium-bind EF-hand family protein, which acted as a Ca2+ sensor sensing Ca2+
  ion concentration in the cytoplasm, and ZKT protein, which may act as a molecular
  adaptor that was regulated by phosphorylation and modulated the ROS pathway, were
  overlapping signaling proteins in the salt and drought responses. Differential signal
  receptors, small G protein, 14-3-3 pathway members, kinases and phosphatases were
  identified in the salt and drought responses, indicating differences in signal perception
  and transduction occurred in the early stage of the salt and drought responses.
