caption: LIF signaling. LIF signaling occurs through a receptor complex of gp130 and
  LIFR. Under resting conditions, both receptor chains are constitutively associated
  with inactivated JAK1 molecules. Upon LIF stimulation, LIF binds to LIFR and gp130
  and initiates signal transduction by transactivation of the gp130-bound and LIFR-bound
  JAK1 molecules. JAK1 then phosphorylates five tyrosine molecules on each receptor
  chain, which create the docking sites for the transcription factors STAT3 and SHP-2,
  leading to activation of JAK/STAT3, MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. The docking
  site also recruits transcription factor SOCS3, which is a predominant negative pathway
  that inhibits JAK-STAT3 activation. By controlling cellular differentiation, survival
  and self-renewal, these pathways collectively contribute to specific physiological
  and immunological processes such as tissue homeostasis, hematopoiesis, pregnancy,
  bone remodeling, neuromuscular system, inflammatory conditions, and cancer ( and
  ).
