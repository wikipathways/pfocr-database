caption: 'Hypothetical model of the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway involved in
  the defence mechanism of the SCN HG type 0. Metabolites are represented by boxes,
  with red boxes indicating up‐regulated metabolites and green boxes indicating down‐regulated
  metabolites after SCN stress. Differentially expressed genes are marked in red font,
  and their expression changes following SCN stress are illustrated in a heat map.
  The right column of the heat map displays gene expression levels in SCN‐treated
  soybean roots, while the left column shows gene expression levels in untreated soybean
  roots. The colour bar at the bottom left corresponds to the relative expression
  levels of each gene in the heatmap. The proteins encoded by the differentially expressed
  genes in red are as follows: PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase), C4H (cinnamate‐4‐hydroxylase),
  CYP73A (trans‐cinnamate 4‐monooxygenase), CHS (chalcone synthase), CHI (chalcone
  isomerase), F3H (flavanone‐3‐hydroxylase), FLS (flavonol synthase), DFR (bifunctional
  dihydroflavonol 4‐reductase), ANS (anthocyanidin synthase), LAR (leucoanthocyanidin
  reductase), HIDH (2‐hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase), IF7GT (isoflavone 7‐O‐glucosyltransferase)
  and IF7MAT (isoflavone 7‐O‐glucoside‐6″‐O‐malonyltransferase)'
