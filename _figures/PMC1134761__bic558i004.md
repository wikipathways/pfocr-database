caption: The proteolysis of securin at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition liberates
  separase, which together with the other components of the FEAR pathway, triggers
  the partial release of Cdc14 from the RENT complex in early anaphase. Cdc14 activates
  the Cdc15 kinase (component of the MEN pathway) at the SPB, while Cdc5 inactivates
  Bfa1 of the Tem1 GAP complex, contributing to Tem1 activation. Moreover, the translocation
  of the daughter SPB into the bud brings the Tem1 GTPase in contact with Lte1, its
  putative exchange factor, which is also believed to lead to Tem1 activation. The
  PAK-like kinases Cla4 and Ste20 also contribute to full Tem1 activation by promoting
  the localization of Lte1 to the cortex. The result is the activation of MEN signalling
  and the initiation of a positive-feedback loop causing further release of Cdc14
  from the nucleolus. Activation of MEN signalling and the concomitant release of
  Cdc14 in late anaphase is essential for activation of APCHct1 (APC/C activated by
  Hct1) and the commencement of the second phase of Clb proteolysis (the first phase
  of Clb proteolysis occurs as cells enter anaphase and is triggered by APCCdc20),
  leading to mitotic exit, and also cytokinesis. By triggering the degradation of
  FEAR proteins Spo12 and Cdc5, by dephosphorylating and promoting the GAP activity
  of Bfa1 and by causing induction of the Amn1 protein, Cdc14 itself turns on the
  switch that down-regulates MEN signalling and eventually leads to the re-sequestration
  of Cdc14 in the nucleolus. The main targets of regulation by the SCP are highlighted
  in the Figure.
