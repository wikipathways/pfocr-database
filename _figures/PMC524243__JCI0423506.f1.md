caption: 'Simplified model of insulin signaling. Insulin binding to the extracellular
  domain of the insulin receptor elicits a conformational change, which in turn leads
  to receptor autophosphorylation (P) and tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular
  protein substrates. Two main branching pathways are activated by insulin: (a) One
  is the MAPK signaling cascade, in which the Grb2/Sos pathway leads to activation
  of Ras signaling, affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis. In view of their mitogenic
  nature, these can be characterized as “growth signal” effects. (b) The other is
  the IRS pathway, which leads to activation of kinases dependent upon the heterodimeric
  (p85/p110) PI3K, such as Akt, also referred to as protein kinase B (PKB); Akt modulates
  enzyme activities that, besides affecting NO generation and apoptosis, control glucose,
  lipid, and protein metabolism. This PI3K-branching pathway is termed the “metabolic
  signal.” PI(, )P2, phosphoinositide 4,5 di-phosphate; PI(, , )P3, phosphoinositide
  3,4,5 tri-phosphate; PDK1 phosphoinositide–dependent kinase–1; MEK, MAPK kinase.'
