caption: Hypothetical model for the aggravation of autoimmune response in Pdmx-associated
  and spontaneous NT1.The immune response in NT1 is highly heterogenic with different
  pathways affected during the disease progression. We favor the idea that the lifelong
  risk for NT1 or for disease aggravation in pre-disposed individuals is increased
  following inflammatory triggers upon breaching of the blood–brain barrier (BBB)
  and with activation of preexisting auto-reactive antibodies (Ab) and cells reaching
  brain. Consequently, an immune response to A/H1N1 (and subsequent molecular mimicry)
  or a generalized stimulation of the immune system mediated by the Pdmx vaccine as
  AS03-adjuvanted vaccine can act as the inflammatory trigger (; ; ). The inflammation
  triggers include i) infections (examples of pathogens are shown), ii) genetic factors,
  or iii) chronic inflammation (). The polyclonal Ab response from peripheral tissue
  may initiate disease by concentrating antigens in the brain to presentation-competent
  cells (). Recent data show further that peripherally produced human anti-CNS reactive
  antibodies are capable of opsonizing human CNS antigens (). The entry of immune
  cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages, microglia and mast cells) cause neuroinflammation
  with the release of cytokines that damage neurons including HCRT+ neurons involved
  in sleep/wake regulation. Production of auto-reactive antibodies as a secondary
  response to cell death of HCRT-or other brain-resident cells can occur via antigen
  presenting cells. Prostaglandins are part of the inflammatory response in the brain
  acting via specific receptors. In particular, DP1 is produced by astrocytes, oligodendrocytes,
  neurons, microglia and meningeal cells (; ; ). PGD2 signaling is known to prevent
  excessive inflammasome activation and may act as an anti-inflammatory pathway in
  the brain. Additionally, in brain residing mast cells, DP1 activity promotes maturation
  and histamine release (). The latter is of particular interest given that histamine
  levels in the CSF of NT1-diseased are reduced (). Thus, our findings suggest that
  the anti-DP1 immune response, whether causal or sequel, can interfere with PGD2
  signaling in the brain. The results provide also evidence that the dysfunctional
  DP1 network can be a target for diagnosis and intervention of NT1, a conclusion
  that warrants further investigations.
