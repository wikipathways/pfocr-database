caption: The two cells represented here can be identified as a tumor cell and the
  stromal counterpart or vice versa. The energy demand of the tumor cell aimed at
  supporting the high proliferative standard that induces a proportional increase
  in the glyco-lytic pathway. The increased glycolysis results in an increased production
  of lactate and aldehydes such as glioxal and methylglioxal. These two aldehydes
  bind, by Maillards reaction, to the free radicals of the macromolecules, protein
  and non-protein present in the intracellular microenviroment resulting in adducts
  of Methylglyoxal, or advanced gly-cated adduct AGEs. These molecules gain extracellular
  space and bind to their receptors, RAGE. RAGE's expression is induced by the presence
  of the AGEs. RAGE activation results in the activation of downstream signaling pathways
  responsible for the release of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. S-100 proteins
  DAMP and PAMP and HMBG in response to specific conditions share analogous ability
  to induce and bind RAGE.
