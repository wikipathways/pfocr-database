caption: Schematic diagram of ionic versus signaling pathways for cardiotonic steroid
  effects. In the classic pathway (shown on the left), CTS binds and inhibits the
  NKA, which in turn is accompanied by changes in cytosolic [Na+]. The increase in
  cytosolic [Na+] then reduces NCX activity and induces an increase in cytosolic [Ca2+].
  High cytosolic [Ca2+] mediates muscle contraction (inotropy) or activates a variety
  of signaling pathways. It is unclear whether the effects of CTS on heart rate (bradycardia)
  are also mediated via the ionic pathway. The signaling pathway (shown on the right
  hand side) occurs in the caveolar domain and involves the physical interaction with
  Src. When the CTS binds the NKA, SRC gets activated inducing further activation
  of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) through activation of its mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase (MEK).
