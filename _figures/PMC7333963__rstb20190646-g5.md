caption: Putative FA biosynthetic pathway for red drum. Arrows show level of activity
  for each step, based on findings for a closely related species, Nibe croaker [].
  FA in boldface type are those deemed useful trophic markers in red drum eggs, based
  on results from the current study. Desaturation reactions are denoted by Δn, where
  n indicates the carbon position at which a double bond is inserted. Elongation reactions
  are catalysed by enzymes encoded by genes shown in italics. (Online version in colour.)
