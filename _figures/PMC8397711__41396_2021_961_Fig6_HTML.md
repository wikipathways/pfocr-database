caption: 'In this model, central metabolisms including DNA degradation, EMP glycolysis,
  oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, hydrogen production, electron transport system,
  sulfur metabolism and one carbon metabolism are shown. All the above items are closely
  related to the energy production in X. coldseepsis zrk13. In detail, strain zrk13
  contains a complete set of genes related to DNA-degradation, which could catabolically
  exploit various sub-components of DNA, especially purine-based molecules. And further
  degradation into nucleotides and nucleosides by nucleases were required to facilitate
  the introduction of DNA sub-components into cells. Once imported into the cytoplasm,
  purine- and pyrimidine-deoxyribonucleosides were further broken down into different
  bases, whereby the respective bases may enter catabolic pathways. The metabolites
  of nucleosides catabolism were finally transformed into phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate
  (PRPP) and Ribose-1P, thus entering the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, which
  is closely related to EMP glycolysis pathway. Sulfide generated by sulfur reduction
  from thiosulfate works together with the L-serine to form acetate and L-cysteine,
  which eventually enter the pyruvate synthesis pathway. Furthermore, the formate
  produced in one carbon metabolism was converted into CO2/CO by formate dehydrogenase.
  Iron hydrogenases catalyze the reduction of protons to hydrogen for the energy production.
  A membrane-bound, Na+-transporting NADH: Ferredoxin oxidoreductase (RNF complex),
  the H+-transporting NADH: Quinone oxidoreductase (complex I) and F-type ATP synthase
  required for energy metabolism are present in strain zrk13 genome. Both complex
  I and the cytochrome bd oxidase interact with the quinone pool, which are associated
  with energy production.'
