caption: The antioxidant enzyme network is upregulated through the EGCG-induced Nrf2-ARE
  signaling pathway. This activation stimulates the transcription of several enzymatic
  antioxidants via the Nrf2 transcription factor. Keap1 is an Nrf2 cytosolic suppressor
  that prevents the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus. GSH is presumed to be associated
  with oxidized or some other active EGCG (EGCG*) forms, therefore, reducing cells'
  GSH amount might cause distraction of redox status with following stimulation of
  upregulation kinases. Comprising PI3K, PKC, and MAPKs, such as JNK and ERK lead
  to Nrf2 phosphorylation activation. Otherwise, Cysteine residues exist in Keap1
  and may interact directly with some reaction forms of EGCG (EGCG*), therefore upregulating
  Nrf2 separation. Similarly, auto-oxidation of the EGCG-generated ROS regulates the
  phosphatization of Nrf2 not only by stimulating induced kinases or oxidizing Keap1
  cysteine thiol. Mutual action can enable the Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Finally,
  Nrf2 forms a heterodimer with small Maf in the nucleus that binds to ARE or EpRE
  to regulate the antioxidant enzyme network. The figure is generated with BioRender.com
