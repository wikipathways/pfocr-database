caption: Regulation pathways of Arc transcription in BDNF- and Ca2+-mediated signaling.
  A). BDNF-mediated Arc expression is controlled through MAPK pathway and gated by
  intracellular calcium. Upon the activation of TrkB by BDNF, Ras-Raf-MAPK, PI3K,
  and PLC-γsignaling pathways are stimulated. It appeared that they are independent,
  no cross talk was identified among them in BDNF-stimulated neurons, and MAPK signaling
  is the sole regulator for Arc transcription. In addition, [Ca2+]i regulates Arc
  transcription in parallel to MAPK. Furthermore, CaM may regulate Arc transcription
  through Ras-Raf-MAPK, but is independent of [Ca2+]i and not through CaMKs. B) Ca2+-mediated
  Arc transcription requires MAPK, PI3K, extracellular Ca2+, intracellular Ca2+, CaM,
  and CaMK activity. It appeared that PI3K and CaMK regulated Arc transcription through
  ERK. Although a transient influx of extracellular Ca2+ is required for ERK activation,
  [Ca2+]i is not required for ERK activation. Even with the activation of ERK, chelation
  of [Ca2+]i blocks Arc up-regulation. This implicates that ERK and [Ca2+]i are also
  parallel pathways in KCl-stimulated neurons. “?” indicates that the mechanism is
  unknown.
