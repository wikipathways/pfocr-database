caption: Transmethylation cycle, methyltransferases, points of inhibition by chemical
  inhibitors, relationship to selenoprotein P, and gluconeogenic enzyme expression
  as well as downstream physiological effects. HCY is methylated to methionine (MET),
  which is subsequently adenylated to SAM. SAM serves as a universal methyl donor
  to multiple methyltransferases, e.g. PRMT. After loss of a methyl group, SAM is
  hydrolyzed to SAH by the action of AHCY. POA and ARS are direct inhibitors of AHCY,
  whereas MTA is an indirect inhibitor of methyltransferases via the polyamine pathway.
  SAH is a feedback inhibitor of SAM-dependent methyltransferases, such that inhibiting
  AHCY produces a rise in levels of SAH and inhibits, for example, PRMTs. PRMTs, including
  CARM1, methylate transcription factors (FOXO1A, HNF4α, and PPARGC1α) known to facilitate
  transcription of SEPP1, G6PC, and PCK1. These proteins have been implicated in insulin
  resistance and increased hepatic glucose output in type II diabetes.
