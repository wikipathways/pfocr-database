caption: VEGF signaling pathway in males (A) and females (B) exposed to SAMe during
  pregnancy. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in mice
  treated with SAMe administration. Ingenuity Pathway (IPA) Analysis identified the
  VEGF-a (vascular endothelial growth factor A) signaling pathway as being enriched.
  The network was generated through the use of IPA (Qiagen, Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com)
  on normalized mRNA values measured by Nanostring analysis. Nodes represent molecules
  in a pathway, while the biological relationship between nodes is represented by
  a line (edge). Edges are supported by at least one reference in the Ingenuity Knowledge
  Base. The brightness of color in a node indicates the degree of upregulation (red)
  or downregulation (green). Nodes are displayed using shapes that represent the functional
  class of a gene product (Circle = Other, Nested Circle = Group or Complex, Rhombus
  = Peptidase, Square = Cytokine, Triangle = Kinase, Vertical ellipse = Transmembrane
  receptor). Edges are marked with symbols to represent the relationship between nodes
  (Line only = Binding only, Flat line = inhibits, Solid arrow = Acts on, Solid arrow
  with flat line = inhibits and acts on, Open circle = leads to, Open arrow = translocates
  to).
