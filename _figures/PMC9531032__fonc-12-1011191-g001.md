caption: Metabolic fates of glutamine within the tumor cell. The amide nitrogen of
  glutamine can be utilized by enzymes in pyrimidine and purine nucleotide synthesis.
  Additionally, glutamine itself is utilized by glutamine-fructose amidotransferase
  1/2 (GFAT1/2) to begin the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). Glutamine-derived
  glutamate is utilized in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH) by the subsequent activities
  of GCL (glutamine-cysteine ligase) and GS (glutathione synthetase). Glutamine is
  converted to glutamate by the action of glutaminase (GLS) and can be used in the
  synthesis of alanine or converted to α-KG (alpha-ketoglutarate). Glutamate-derived
  α-KG can be used as a direct substate for epigenetic modifcation by histone demethylases,
  as anaplerotic replenishment of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) intermediates
  depleted by other biosynthetic reactions, or used for fatty acid synthesis via conversion
  to citrate in the process of reductive carboxylation (dashed arrows). Oxaloacetate
  (OAA) can additionally be used to synthesise aspartate and asparagine. Glucose-derived
  pyruvate (Pyr) and acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) continue to contribute to the TCA cycle under
  these anaplerotic conditions.
