caption: Outlook on primary cilia and Hedgehog signalling pathway []. In the absence
  of a Hh ligand, GLI is phosphorylated by PKA, GSK3β, and CK1, leading to GLI repressor
  formation and arrest of the pathway. When Hh ligands are present, Smoothened is
  phosphorylated, SUFU inhibition is removed, and the GLI activator induces targeted
  genes transcription.
