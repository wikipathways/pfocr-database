caption: Hsp72 is an important intracellular protein to inhibition of HMGB1 release
  and proinflammatory function in macrophages (). Hsp72 attenuates lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS)- or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced HMGB1 release partly through inhibiting
  chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent nuclear export pathway of HMGB1.
  Hsp72 also inhibits HMGB1-induced cytokine (i.e., TNF-α and interleukin [IL]-1β)
  expression and release potentially by inhibiting MAPKs and nuclear factor (NF)-κB
  activation. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,
