caption: Insulin signaling pathway and insulin insensitive. The inner part of insulin
  receptor (IR) reveals a tyrosine kinase activity and coupled with multifunctional
  docking proteins IRS-1 and IRS-2. The in turn signaling leads to an activation of
  the MAPK cascade involved in mitogenesis and the open status of a hexose transporter
  protein (GLUTs) which is located in the cell membrane and is the only channel for
  glucose entery into cells. The decreased serine/threonine phosphorylation of IR,
  inactivates hexokinase and glycogen synthase, as well as defects in the phosphorylation
  of glucose transporter protein (GLUT4) and genetic primary defect in mitochondrial
  fatty acid oxidation, leading to insulin resistance and an increase of triglyceride
  synthesis contribute to this insulin insensitivity. The action sites of hypoglycemia
  herbs are indicated with red arrows[].
