caption: Working model for the signal transduction pathways that regulate the expression
  of the Elip genes in Arabidopsis seedlings. Different light qualities are sensed
  by at least three different photoreceptors, PhyA, PhyB, and a novel blue-light receptor,
  to initiate a signal transduction cascade that abolishes the repressory action of
  the CSN, leading to the expression of both Elip1 and Elip2. The expression of Elip1
  is positively effected by HY5, whereas other transcription factors regulate Elip2.
  Heat shock stimulates the expression of Elip through an independent signaling pathway.
