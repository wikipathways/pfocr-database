caption: Inflammation, oxidation, and NO secretion have been demonstrated to play
  a critical role in cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial injury. IL-10 can activate
  STAT3 to inhibit the NF-kB signalling pathway, thereby attenuating cardiac hypertrophy.
  TNF-alpha is associated with the AKT and JNK pathways in enhancing NF-kB activation
  to augment cardiac hypertrophy. TNF-alpha can also upregulate ROI expression to
  enhance myocyte hypertrophy. Another study reported that eNOS upregulation can attenuate
  myocardial injury. In our study, we first found that DRLE can attenuate TNF-alpha
  secretion, which might reduce AKT, JNK, and NF-kB signalling pathways, thereby inhibiting
  cardiac hypertrophy. ROI expression might also be inhibited by DRLE through TNF-alpha
  stimulation. We assumed that the direct inhibition of ROI is a potential mechanism
  for inhibiting cardiac hypertrophy, because the antioxidative effect of DRLE has
  also been reported. Second, we cannot confirm whether DRLE enhances IL-10 expression,
  because serum IL-10 level was undetected in our experiment. Third, the NO serum
  level increased in our study, but we could not determine the origin of the NO, and
  we postulated that eNOS is a possible candidate. Finally, we found that DRLE can
  dilate the porcine coronary artery directly in vitro.
