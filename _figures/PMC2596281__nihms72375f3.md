caption: 'The proposed acylphosphate intermediate in the reactions catalyzed by PurD,
  PurK, PurT and PurP. Nu: for PurD is the amino group of PRA, for PurK, the 5-amino
  group of AIR, for PurT, the amino group of GAR and for PurP, the amino group of
  AICAR. R5P is ribose 5′-phosphate. The amide group formed in each reaction is indicated
  by a dashed box.'
