caption: The balance between p53 and AKT/mTOR determines the fate of the UV-irradiated
  cells. p53 and AKT/mTOR mutually inhibit each other in a tightly regulated cross
  talk, that influences cellular responses at different levels. UV-induced p53-dependent
  apoptosis can be inhibited by UV- or heat-activated AKT/mTOR pathway. Vice versa,
  UV-activated p53 can inhibit AKT/mTOR thereby counteracting its anti-apoptotic function
  but contributing to induction of autophagy. However, UV-induced autophagy counteracts
  UV-induced apoptosis at least to certain extends. Under slightly different physiological
  conditions, concomitant activation of p53 and AKT/mTOR can drive cells into senescence
  and thereby mediate an anti-tumor response. Thus, a very complex regulation of cell
  death and survival pathways exists, that controls malignant transformation of skin
  cells.
