caption: Combination treatments of adoptive NK cells with other Immunotherapies could
  improve outcomes. (A) Adoptive transfer of NK cells combined with checkpoint inhibitor
  blockade could increase overall NK cytotoxicity and cytokine production and help
  control tumor and activate the adaptive immune response. (B) NK cell therapy combined
  with oncolytic virotherapy (OV) could improve therapeutic efficacy. Depletion of
  endogenous NK cells would reduce the natural antiviral response and increase OV
  mediated tumor lysis, and adoptive transfer of NK cells would increase NK cell effector
  functions and enhance the antitumor response. (C) STING-dependent tumor rejection
  activated by cGAS expression from tumor cells () can be enhanced by combination
  therapy of STING agonists with NK cells. This would provide enhanced tumor lysis
  through further activation of the STING pathway, not only activating the innate
  immunity by stimulating expression of cytokines and Type I IFNs, but by increasing
  the presence of NK cell activating receptors ligands, which could enhance adoptive
  NK cell therapy antitumor responses.
