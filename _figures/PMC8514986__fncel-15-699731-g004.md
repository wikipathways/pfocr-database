caption: The concentration of intracellular Ca2+ is elevated by TSP4 via binding to
  Cavα2δ1 and activating the downstream PKC signaling pathway when nerve is injured.
  Once nerve is damaged, TSP4 first binds with the Cavα2δ1 and mediates Ca2+ influx,
  and then induces the phosphorylation of PKC. The p-PKC decreases the function of
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+-ATPase and inhibits Ca2+ entering into ER. Meanwhile,
  p-PKC activates IP3R and allows Ca2+ flowing out of ER. It results in the downregulation
  of ER Ca2+ concentration which induces the opening of store-operated calcium channel.
  These processes successfully cause the influx of Ca2+ and the upregulation of intracytoplasmic
  Ca2+. Finally, the intracellular Ca2+ further activates primary sensory neurons,
  which leads to the formation of peripheral sensitization.
