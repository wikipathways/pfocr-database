caption: 'Biosynthesis of glycerophospholipids. All GPLs consist of a glycerol backbone,
  which is esterified to two fatty acids in its first and second carbons and to phosphoric
  acid in its third carbon. Different head groups (X) are attached to the phosphate
  group to yield PA, PC, PE, PS, and PI. The most common GPLs: PC, PE, PS, and PI
  are derived from PA, which is synthesized in the ER. De novo biosynthesis of PC
  and PE via the Kennedy pathway occurs at the ER and requires DAG, which is derived
  from PA by PA phosphatase (PAP). DAG kinase (DGK) phosphorylates DAG back to PA.
  PI synthesis also requires PA, whereas PS synthesis is mediated by PSS1 and PSS2
  at the MAM fraction. Dashed arrows represent biosynthetic steps that take place
  at the mitochondria. Cho, choline; Etn, ethanolamine; G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate.'
