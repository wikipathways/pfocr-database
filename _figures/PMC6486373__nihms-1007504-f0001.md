caption: Components of bitter melon decrease levels of Cyclin B1 and Cyclin-D1 while
  elevating p21 levels, which induces cell cycle arrest. In addition, bitter melon
  components activate both the caspase-8 and caspase-9 pathways, in turn activating
  caspase-3 and PARP cleavage and inducing apoptosis. Apoptosis is also induced by
  activation of the MAPK pathway (phosphorylation of p38, JNK1, and ERK). Interestingly,
  accumulating evidence supports an increased autophagy in tumor cells exposed to
  some bitter melon compounds (eg., MCL and a cucurbitane-type triterpene) [, ]. However,
  since the relationships between apoptosis and autophagy are complicated, including
  a) autophagy limits apoptosis (cytoprotective autophagy), and b) autophagic cell
  death (which refers to cell death by autophagy) [], the role of autophagy induction
  by bitter melon compounds in the fate of tumor cells needs to be further elucidated.
