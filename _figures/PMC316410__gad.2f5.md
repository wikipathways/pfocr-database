caption: The extracytoplasmic stress response is controlled by partially overlapping
  pathways. The Cpx pathway controls the expression of several resident periplasmic
  folding proteins (DegP, PpiA, and DsbA) in response to overproduction of the outer
  membrane lipoprotein NlpE, and perhaps structural or physical alterations in the
  envelope induced by changes in pH or lipid composition. The alternate σ-factor σE
  controls the expression of degP, rpoH, rpoE, fkpA, and several other unidentified
  genes in response to the accumulation of misfolded OMP precursors in the periplasmic
  space. (See Discussion for further details).
