caption: The Notch receptor is translated as a full-length protein but it is cleaved
  in the trans-Golgi network into two subunits by furin-like convertases. After transport
  to the membrane, these subunits form the heterodimeric Notch receptor. The Notch
  signaling cascade is initiated upon binding of membrane-bound ligand (Jagged 1,2
  and DSL 1,3,4) to the Notch receptors. Upon ligand binding two sequential proteolytic
  events occur to liberate active Notch Intracel- lular (NIC). The first cleavage
  is mediated by a metalloprotease, TNF-a-converting enzyme (TACE). The final cleavage
  is mediated by a γ-secretase complex. Subsequently, NIC translocates to the nucleus
  and functions as a transcription factor to influence gene expression including HES,
  Hey and other targets.
