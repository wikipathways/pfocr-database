caption: IL-4 and IL-13 induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6. Activation of
  the type I receptor by IL-4 and the type II by IL-4 or IL-13 will induce the tyrosine
  phosphorylation of IRS2 with different efficiencies. The Grb2 site is restricted
  to the type I receptor. Activation of pathways downstream of IRS2, especially the
  PI3K pathway, have been shown to be critical for the STAT6-dependent transcription
  of arginase-1 and FIZZ1. Activation of STAT6-dependent genes is dependent on the
  recruitment of CREB-binding protein/p300 to the transcriptional complex. The mechanism
  by which the PI3K pathway modulates transcription of these genes is unclear.
