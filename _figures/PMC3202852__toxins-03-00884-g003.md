caption: Uncoupling of Gαi/o proteins from their cognate G protein-coupled receptor
  (GPCR). Activation of GPCRs leads to dissociation of heterotrimeric G protein complex
  into Gαi/o and βγ subunit. The exchange of GTP from GDP results in activation of
  the inhibitory G protein (Gαi/o), thereby inhibiting adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity.
  When the A-protomer of PTX penetrates into the host cells, the Gαi/o is ADP-ribosylated
  at cysteine residue resulting in inactivation of Gαi/o. The inhibitory effect of
  Gαi/o on AC activity results in the elevation of intracellular cAMP levels, leading
  to activation of the cAMP-mediated signaling pathway. This enhanced pathway by PTX
  is recognized as the Gi/o protein-dependent pathway.
