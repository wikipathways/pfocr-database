caption: Figure 1. Possible immunological functions of granzyme B-secreting B cells.
  B cell-derived granzyme B (GrB) in the context of interleukin-21 (IL-21) stimulation
  and B-cell receptor (BCR)-engagement may mediate the following functions. (A) The
  direct, specific and MHC-independent recognition of antigens may stimulate cytotoxic
  or B cells with antiviral properties, particularly during the early phases of infections.
  (B) The leakage of GrB in the cytoplasm may result in the apoptotic demise of autoreactive
  B cells. (C) B cells may acquire a regulatory phenotype, involving GrB expression,
  that results in suppressive effects on other immune cells.
