caption: A network of the top three canonical pathways (Phospholipase C Signaling,
  Role of NFAT in Regulation of the Immune Response, Gαq Signaling) and its associated
  differentially expressed genes was generated. Coloring is based on the expression
  values of the genes, down-regulation in green and, up-regulation in red. The direct
  and indirect relationships from the Ingenuity knowledge database are shown by solid
  and dashed lines, respectively. The arrow indicates specific directionality of interactions.
  GNAS was the only up-regulated gene common in the top three pathways. The canonical
  pathway is predominantly composed down-regulated genes; however, this is probably
  due to the fact that, although statistically significant, many of the up-regulated
  genes did not achieve the cutoff of 2-fold change.
