caption: Proposed molecular talking points between TLRs, Wnt, and nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB). The schematic summarizes the suggested interplaying molecular nodes between
  the different signaling pathways addressed in the present review. (A) According
  to the literature, TLRs can modulate the activity of Wnt signaling at different
  points. TLRs can prevent the activation of LRP6, supporting the function of the
  β-catenin destruction complex, thereby promoting the degradation of β-catenin and
  blocking the expression of Wnt target genes. In contrast, TLRs can lead, through
  PI3K and IKKε, to the activation of Akt, causing the inhibition of GSK3β. However,
  TLR signaling can also lead to NLK activation, which can interact with the Lef member
  of the TCF/Lef transcription factor. (B) Similarly, Wnt signaling, through its different
  pathways, can modulate the activity of the TLRs. The non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+pathway
  can induce, through TAK1, the activation of SOC1 and PIAS1, causing a reduced expression
  of TLR signal transducers, such as Myd88. Similarly, the non-canonical Wnt/PCP can
  interact through Rac1/PI3K/Akt with the IKK complex, modulating the activation of
  NF-κB. In the case of canonical Wnt signaling, direct modulation of the NF-κB through
  a Wnt-mediated RelA interaction has been demonstrated. Moreover, it has been suggested
  that β-catenin can block the interaction between NF-κB and CBP/P300, preventing
  the transcription of NF-κB-target genes. TLR, toll-like receptor; MyD88, myeloid
