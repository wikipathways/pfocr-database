caption: Bio-chemical pathway of UBE2D4 and its role in cancer progression. Ubiquitin
  proteasomal degradation process involves binding of ubiquitin with ubiquitin-activating
  enzyme (E1) in the presence of ATP to form a thio-ester bond. Activated ubiquitin
  is transferred to UBE2D4 enzyme maintaining thio-ester bond with the elimination
  of E1 enzyme. This reaction is followed by covalent attachment of UBE2D4 with an
  ubiquitin CHIP- ligase (E3) which results in polyubiquitination reaction and leads
  to cell cycle progression
