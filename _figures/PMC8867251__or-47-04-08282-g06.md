caption: Proposed mechanisms of VEGF inhibition in the TME and its effects on TAMs.
  VEGF inhibition in the TME did not affect the M2 polarization of macrophages. TAMs
  stimulated in a VEGF-depleted environment displayed reduced M2 characteristics,
  such as the secretion of VEGF and other cytokines including MMP-9 and reduced immune
  tolerance of cancer cells through PD-L1 in TAMs and cancer cells. This may be as
  VEGF depletion induces the suppression of VEGF signaling pathways, including the
  VEGFR2/Akt/mTOR pathway in macrophages. VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor;
  TME, tumor microenvironment; TAMs, tumor-associated macrophages; MMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase-9;
  PD-L1, programmed death-ligand 1.
