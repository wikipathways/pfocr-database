caption: Acupuncture can increase the expression of BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor) via PI3K/Akt (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase) and MEK/ERK1/2
  (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases) signaling pathway by activating the tropomyosin
  receptor kinase B (TrkB), a high affinity catalytic receptor for several neurotrophins
  that induce the activation of survival signaling pathway. This ultimately leads
  to the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response
  element-binding protein) that mediates transcription of BDNF gene expression leading
  to neuroprotection. In this article, we hypothesize that cyclophilin A (CypA) plays
  an important role in the activation of BDNF. On the contrary, BDNF may also be an
  important upstream factor in regulating CypA expression during acupuncture treatment.
  Thus, the exact mechanism between the effect of acupuncture and the expression of
  CypA is still unknown.
