caption: 'Gut microbiota-derived metabolites in MASLD pathogenesis under dysbiosis.
  Under gut microbiota dysbiosis, multiple microbial metabolites—including SCFAs,
  BAs, LPS, endogenous ethanol, choline, and amino acids—are dysregulated, collectively
  driving MASLD progression. SCFAs (acetate, propionate, butyrate): Attenuate hepatic
  steatosis by activating AMPK and GPR signaling while suppressing TLR4-mediated inflammation.
  Dysbiosis reduces SCFA production, exacerbating intestinal barrier dysfunction and
  hepatic lipid deposition. Secondary BAs: Inhibit hepatocyte steatosis via TGR5/FXR
  signaling activation, whereas dysmetabolism of primary Bas promotes barrier disruption.
  LPS: Triggers hepatocyte inflammation and fibrosis through TLR4/NF-κB pathway activation.
  Endogenous ethanol: Upregulates CYP2E1 to induce oxidative stress and acetaldehyde-mediated
  hepatotoxicity. Choline-TMA/TMAO axis: Microbial conversion of choline to trimethylamine
  (TMA) and subsequent hepatic oxidation to TMAO suppresses FXR signaling, aggravating
  steatosis. Amino acids: BCAAs promote lipotoxicity via dual regulation of adipocyte
  lipolysis and hepatic mTOR signaling; AHR-activating Kyn exacerbates steatosis,
  while gut microbiota-derived indole derivatives enhance barrier integrity and suppress
  inflammation. Abbreviations: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; GPR, G-protein-coupled
  receptor; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; TGR5, G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor
  1; FXR, Farnesoid X receptor; CYP2E1, cytochrome P450 2E1; TMA, trimethylamine;
  TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin. The figure was
