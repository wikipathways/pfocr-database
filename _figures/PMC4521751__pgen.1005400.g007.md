caption: A DNA double-strand break activates the DNA damage response leading to activation
  of P53. In Drosophila, transcription of the well-known pro-apoptotic genes hid and
  reaper is activated in one pathway downstream from P53, while transcription of the
  anti-apoptotic gene corp is activated in a second downstream pathway that constitutes
  a negative feedback loop on P53. These competing pathways are analogous to those
  found in vertebrates, where P53 promotes apoptosis by inducing a variety of pro-apoptotic
  genes in one pathway and the P53 negative regulator Mdm2 in a competing branch.
  Altering the activity of these competing pathways alters the life or death outcome
  initiated by the DNA damage signal.
