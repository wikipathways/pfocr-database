caption: Model was developed based on homology to other characterized enzymes. The
  activity of FucX has been experimentally verified as has the production of l-fuconic
  acid. Inner molecules trace the products formed by l-fucose catabolism and outer
  molecules are from d-arabinose catabolism. The letters underneath each enzyme name
  denote the mutant growth phenotype (G = mutant has a growth enhancement on l-fucose
  and d-arabinose, N = no growth enhancement as determined either in the present or
  previous study).
