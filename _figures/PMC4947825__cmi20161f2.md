caption: Interactions between coagulation and inflammation during IAV infection. (a)
  Airway and alveolar epithelial cells are the primary targets of IAV infection. IAV
  can directly infect ECs and/or indirectly induce EC activation and vascular hyperpermeability
  through PAMPs, DAMPs and inflammatory cytokines. (b) The activation of ECs induces
  a pro-thrombotic state by down-regulating the anticoagulant components (TM, AT,
  TFPI and ADPase), the expression of TF and vWF and the exposure of collagen to blood.
  Thrombin, FXa and FVIIa, produced by the coagulation cascade, augment the inflammatory
  response by activating platelets, endothelial cells, monocytes, neutrophils, NKT
  and T cells through PARs. (c) Platelets are activated by exposure to thrombin, TF,
  collagen and vWF. Then, the coagulation cascades and thrombi formation are initiated.
  (d) The downregulation of tight junction protein on ECs and apoptosis of ECs induced
  by inflammatory cytokines lead to vascular hyperpermeability, which results in leakage
  of plasma and blood cells into the bronchoalveoli (hemorrhage). Decompensated thrombocytopenia
  is another reason for hemorrhage during an IAV infection. (e) Activated platelets
  act as pro-inflammatory cells by releasing inflammatory cytokines and promoting
  the activation, transmigration and cytokine release of neutrophils, T, B and NK
  cells, DC and monocytes. Activated platelets also modulate EC function to promote
  an inflammatory response. (f) The cytokine storm of overactivated neutrophils, monocytes
  and lymphocytes (NK cell, NKT cell and T cell), as well as the overproduction of
  inflammatory cytokines by these cells, contributes to the high morbidity and mortality
  during IAV infection. AT, antithrombin; DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns;

  description: Interactions between coagulation and inflammation during IAV infection.
    (a) Airway and alveolar epithelial cells are the primary targets of IAV infection.
    IAV can directly infect ECs and/or indirectly induce EC activation and vascular
    hyperpermeability through PAMPs, DAMPs and inflammatory cytokines. (b) The activation
    of ECs induces a pro-thrombotic state by down-regulating the anticoagulant components
