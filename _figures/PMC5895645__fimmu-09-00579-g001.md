caption: Metabolic and vascular effects of insulin. Under physiologic conditions,
  the activated insulin receptor on endothelial cells leads to phosphorylation of
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) via activation of insulin receptor substrate
  (IRS) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (a). This results in vasodilation via NO production.
  This branch also regulates GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in muscle cells.
  The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway controls secretion of vasoconstrictive
  ET-1 in endothelial cells, and cell growth and mitogenesis in cells at large. Inflammation
  reduces NO production via blocking insulin receptor signaling at the level of the
  IRS-1 (b).
