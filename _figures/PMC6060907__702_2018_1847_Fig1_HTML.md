caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the main mechanisms implicated in the sensitization
  of D1R associated with LID. In PD, the loss of dopamine input to the striatum increases
  the expression of the Gαolf protein and adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5). This change
  enhances the ability of D1R, which are expressed in the striatal projection neurons
  of the direct pathway (dSPN), to stimulate the synthesis of cAMP, a primary mediator
  of dopamine transmission. The increases in Gαolf protein and AC5 are paralleled
  by reduced expression of the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6), which decreases
  D1R phosphorylation, β-arrestin binding and receptor internalization. Dopamine depletion
  is also accompanied by increased expression of β-arrestin, which may counteract
  D1R sensitization. However, this effect is reversed by administration of l-DOPA.
  In contrast, overexpression of AC5 and, at least in part, Gαolf protein, as well
  as downregulation of GRK6, persists in dSPN even following administration of l-DOPA.
  Importantly, treatment with l-DOPA increases the levels of the postsynaptic density
  95 (PSD-95) and dopamine D3 receptors (D3R). This further reinforces D1R-mediated
  transmission, leading to activation of the cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32, ERK and mTORC1 signaling
  cascades. The importance of these mechanisms is underscored by several studies,
  indicating that overexpression of GRK6 and β-arrestin, or downregulation of AC5
  and PSD-95, decrease dyskinesia. In line with these findings, and further supporting
  the crucial role played by receptor sensitization in LID, this condition is also
  reduced by overexpression of the regulator of G-protein signaling 9-2 (RGS9-2),
  or by combining the administration of l-DOPA with D3R antagonists
