caption: In the proximal nerve, retrograde signals and calcium influx signal neurons
  to injury activating a RAG program (see &). Within the nerve gap, the pro-inflammatory
  phase of injury involves leukocyte accumulation including platelets (P), neutrophils,
  macrophages (M), and inflammatory cytokines forming a clot to promote inflammation
  and a provisional ECM. This inflammation resolves as T-cells arrive in the nerve
  gap and promote pro-regenerative processes including IL-4 regulation and leukocyte
  modulation and recruitment. The pro-regenerative phase involves changes to macrophages
  from Type 2 (i.e. IL-4) cytokines leading to promotion of neovascularization, angiogenesis,
  ECM remodeling, and then recruitment of aligned Schwann cell (SC) channels within
  the gap. In the distal nerve, axons undergo Wallerian degeneration, where SCs dedifferentiate
  into a pro-inflammatory, phagocytic phenotype recruiting other phagocytic leukocytes.
  Following this inflammatory phase, these dedifferentiated SCs then align themselves
  into channels (Bands of Bungner) to facilitate axon growth from the proximal nerve.
