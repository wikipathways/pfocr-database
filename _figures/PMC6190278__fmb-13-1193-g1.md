caption: 'BCG training of human monocytes in vitro or by vaccination increases their
  surface marker expression and cytokine production in response to heterologous antigen
  stimulation [,]. In monocytes, these changes are regulated by metabolic shift from
  oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and histone modifications [], with increased
  frequency of permissive H3K4me3 and reduced presence of inhibitory H3K9me3 at the
  promoters of cytokine, receptor and metabolic pathway component encoding genes [,,].

  training and the right side – post-training. Enhanced cytokine production post-training
  is indicated by arrows. Heterologous microorganism – secondary, nonmycobacterial
