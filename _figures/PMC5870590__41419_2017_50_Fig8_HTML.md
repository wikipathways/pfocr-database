caption: TGF-β1 binds to its type II receptor and recruits type I receptor to form
  a receptor complex, which then phosphorylates and activates intracellular transducer
  protein Smad2. MiR-143-3p is upregulated upon TGF-β1 stimulation and interacts with
  the 3′-UTR of PNPO mRNA, leading to a downregulation of PNPO expression. Blocking
  type I receptor by SB-431542 abolishes the TGF-β action. PNPO is upregulated in
  epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown of PNPO by RNA interference results in
  the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion, the induction of apoptosis,
  the retard of tumour formation and a negative feedback loop with Smad2 phosphorylation.
  Dietary pyridoxine (PN) and pyridoxamine (PM) serve as the main source of pyridoxine
  5′-phosphate (PNP) and pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP). PNP and PMP are then converted
  to pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), an active form of vitamin B6, by the catalysing
  enzyme - pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase (PNPO). PLP is finally hydrolysed to pyridoxal
  (PL). Increased PLP inhibits PNPO expression and cell proliferation
