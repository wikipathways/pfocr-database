caption: Mentioned strategies in the above figure can be used by the immune cells
  to undergo reciprocity – (a) changes induced by Transcription factors and Epigenetic
  modifiers (EM) such as Histone modifying enzymes can govern silencing of important
  genes required for maintaining parasite eliminating phenotype, (b)Activators and
  repressors may bind to different genes and induce reciprocity, (c) non-coding RNAs
  can degrade mRNA derived from transcriptionally active genes, (d) Metabolic usage
  of nitrogen may change and can get directed toward different metabolic pathway in
  this case L-Arginine instead of undergoing citrulline pathway for NO production
  gets directed to ornithine cycle.
