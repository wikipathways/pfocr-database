caption: The scheme illustrates probable entrance points of the 13C-labelled carbon
  sources used in the present study into the mainframe biosynthesis pathways. The
  sterol biosynthesis pathway is defined by enzymes that catalyse the sterol structure,
  and the relevant enzymatic steps are shown associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.
  The ten enzymatic steps involved in conversion of lanosterol into ergosterol are
  shown by the solid arrows. Several reaction steps are repeated by four of these
  enzymes, sterol C4-methyl oxidase [1→2], sterol C4-decarboxylase [2→3], sterol C3-reductase
  [3→4] and 24-SMT [7→8,9,10], using different substrates. G3P, glucose 3-phosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxy acetonephosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Sq, squalene; SO, squalene
  oxide.
