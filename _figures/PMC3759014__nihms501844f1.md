caption: The main constituents of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway include the SHH
  ligand and the transmembrane proteins PTCH1 and SMO. In the absence of SHH, PTCH1
  interacts with SMO and suppresses SMO-mediated signaling. Binding of SHH to PTCH1,
  gain of function mutations of SMO, or inactivating mutations of PTCH1 inhibit PTCH1-mediated
  suppression allowing SMO to transduce a growth signal to the nucleus via the complex
  of glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) transcription factors. These factors
  activate a number of target genes that promote cell growth and proliferation.
