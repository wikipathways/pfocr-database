caption: Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2 regulates erythropoietin (EPO). Shown is
  an overview of EPO gene regulation by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)/HIF/prolyl-4-hydroxylase
  domain (PHD) oxygen-sensing pathway. Proteasomal degradation of HIF-2α by the VHL
  tumor suppressor (pVHL)-E3-ubiquitin ligase complex (shown are key components of
  this complex) requires hydroxylation by oxygen- and iron-dependent PHDs. Binding
  to hydroxylated HIF-α occurs at the β-domain of pVHL, which spans amino acid residues
  64–154. The C-terminal α-domain links the substrate recognition component pVHL to
  the E3 ubiquitin ligase via elongin C. In the absence of molecular oxygen, HIF-2α
  is not degraded and translocates to the nucleus where it forms a heterodimer with
  HIF-β, also known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT).
  HIF-2α/β heterodimers bind to the HIF consensus binding site 5′-RCGTG-3′ and increase
  EPO transcription in the presence of transcriptional coactivators, such as CREB-binding
  protein (CBP) and p300. Hypoxic induction of EPO in the liver is mediated by the
  liver-inducibility element located in the 3′-end of the EPO gene and in renal interstitial
  fibroblast-like cells by the 5′-kidney-inducibility element, which is located 6–14
  kb upstream of its transcription start site. Nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species,
  Krebs cycle metabolites succinate and fumarate, cobalt chloride (CoCl2), and iron
  chelators such as desferrioxamine inhibit HIF PHDs in the presence of oxygen, resulting
  in increased EPO transcription. EPO mRNA is encoded by 5 exons depicted by boxes.
  Coding sequences are shown in red. Nontranslated regions are shown in blue, and
  numbers indicate distance from the transcription start site in kb (not drawn to
  scale). Also shown are binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4 in the
  3′-liver-inducibility region. Fe2+, ferrous iron; NO, nitric oxide; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; ub, ubiquitin.
