caption: Neural pathway for habituation in response to odors. Flies tested in the
  olfactory-jump habituation receive an odor stimulus through the third antennal segment
  (A). Sensory neurons project via the antennal nerve (AN) to the antennal glomeruli
  (AG) (for a review of the olfactory system see ). The antennal glomeruli tract (AGT)
  projects from the AG, however, the specific neural tracts downstream of this are
  not well defined. The mushroom bodies (MB) are involved in olfactory learning and
  receive olfactory information via the AGT that projects to the calyx (C) (; ; ).
  The AGT sends dendrites into the lateral protocerebrum (LP). Further, cross-modal
  connections occur between the olfactory system and visual inputs, which may interact
  in the LP (). The olfactory jump response uses an alternate neural fiber (ANF) to
  the giant fiber (GF) for the neural pathway downstream of the central brain ().
  Chemical synapses between the ANF and interacting motor neurons (Mn) are indicated
  by opposing triangles. The TTMn project to the muscle affecting the mesothoracic
  legs, while the DLMn, DVMn and paMn are involved in different aspects of wing muscle
  depression and lift (). r = retina, CCp = central complex, CCn = cervical connective.
