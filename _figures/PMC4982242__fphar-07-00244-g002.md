caption: Activated canonical Wnt signaling pathway and the drug targeted components.
  (1) Signal transduction is activated upon binding of Wnt from outside the cell to
  Fzd and LRP 5/6 at the cell membrane. (2) Dvl and subsequently Axin, GSK3, CK1 are
  recruited to the cell membrane and thus inhibiting the formation of multiprotein
  destructive complex. (3) Accumulated cytoplasmic β-catenin is further translocated
  into nucleus. (4) Transcription of Wnt targeted genes is activated upon binding
  of nuclear β-catenin to TCF/LEF. (5) Wnt palmitoylation and secretion to outside
  of the cell is facilitated by PORCN in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). (A) OMP54F28
  and sFRP4 are antagonists for Wnt and Fzd interaction while DKK1 antagonizes Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling through binding to LRP 5/6. (B) LGK974, Wnt-C59, and ETC 159 are inhibitors
  for PORCN activities. (C) Curcumin acts as an inhibitor for nuclear translocation
  of cytoplasmic β-catenin. (D) PNU74654 functions as an inhibitor for interaction
  nuclear β-catenin with TCF/LEF.
