caption: 'The two faces of cGAS-STING signaling in cancer. (A) cGAS-STING acts as
  a tumor suppressor by initiating type I interferon signaling (STAT1 axis) and canonical
  NF-kB signaling. These signaling axes promote immune cell infiltration and cell
  death in tumors through modulation of transcription of pro-inflammatory and apoptosis
  signaling molecules. Conversely, it also triggers the other side of type I interferon
  signaling, the STAT3 axis, and the non-canonical NF-kB pathway to promote metastasis
  and tumor growth. (B) Other roles of cGAS-STING signaling: (1) a cell non-autonomous
  role in which cancer cells’ DNA is engulfed by antigen presenting cells (APC) leading
  to activation of cGAS-STING signaling and cGAMP production in APCs. cGAMP is secreted
  by the APCs further stimulating immune infiltration (upper panel). (2) Nuclear cGas
  can also act as an inhibitor of homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair (lower
  panel).'
