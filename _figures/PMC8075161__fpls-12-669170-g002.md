caption: Interactions between the circadian clock and leaf senescence. (A) Age information
  integrates with the circadian clock through TOC1, one of the core oscillators, resulting
  in the shortening of the circadian period with leaf senescence. Age-declined CCA1
  induced the expression of ORE1 and suppression of GLK2 along leaf aging. PRR9 in
  the morning loop directly activates ORE1, and indirectly suppress miRNA164, forming
  the feed-forward pathway. The evening complex (EC) negatively regulates jasmonate-induced
  leaf senescence by repressing the expression of MYC2. Inactivation of EC complex
  causes the activation of MYC2, which induces SAG29, ANAC019, ANAC055, and ANAC072,
  promoting leaf senescence. ELF3, a component of EC, negatively affects ORE1 expression
  by repressing PIF4/5. (B) FHY3/FAR1 is required for the light-induced expression
  of CCA1 and the role of FHY3/FAR1 in activating CCA1 expression is antagonistically
  regulated by TOC1 and PIF5. Under diurnal cycle conditions, the high levels of FHY3
  and FAR1 and low levels of PIF5 and TOC1 at the end of the evening contribute to
  the peak expression of the morning gene CCA1 before dawn. However, at aged leaves,
  FHY3 plays a role as a negative regulator of leaf senescence by suppressing WRKY28.
  Age-declined CCA1 expression might be due to PIF5, whose activity is increased at
  senescence conditions.
