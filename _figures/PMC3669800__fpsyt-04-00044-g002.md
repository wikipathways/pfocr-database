caption: Model by which the dynorphin/kappa system could counteract cocaine-induced
  dopamine release. Cocaine administration elevates dopamine levels. Binding of dopamine
  on the D1 receptor expressed by medium spiny neurons from the striatonigral pathway
  (direct pathway) activates the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway which leads to dynorphin (DYN)
  synthesis. Binding of DYN on kappa receptors (KOR) located on dopamine terminals
  exert an inhibitory effect on dopamine release.
