caption: The CSF-1R axis mediates the crosstalk between tumor microenvironment cells.
  In the TME, the CSF-1/IL-34-CSF-1R signaling pathway enables cell communication,
  influencing phenotypes and cytokine production. CAFs secrete high levels of CSF-1,
  promoting the differentiation and chemotaxis of MDSCs and the recruitment of monocytes
  into M2-like macrophages. TAMs acquire M2-like phenotypes in response to CSF-1 and
  IL-34 from tumor cells. In CRC, IL-34 enhances CAF marker expression, particularly
  α-SMA, vimentin, and FAP. CSF-1R activation in CAFs leads to the secretion of MIP2,
  which affects macrophage function. In renal carcinoma, CSF-1 can impair the development
  of CD34+ progenitors into mature DCs. In melanoma and NSCLC, CSF-1 and IL-6 contribute
  to a switch to pro-tumor phenotype DCs (DC3s), reducing their antigen-presenting
  ability and impairing T lymphocyte activation. CSF-1 and IL-34 from cancer cells
  recruit and enhance the immunosuppressive functions of MO-MDSCs, inducing the production
  of NO, Arg-1, and ROS. The CSF-1/CSF-1R axis also mediates M2-like TAM polarization
  and maintains CSCs, with CSCs also producing IL-34, thus influencing the TME. Created
