caption: Apoptosis pathways. Apoptosis pathways can be initiated by liga-tion of death
  receptors such as TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-Rs) by their respective ligands, e.g. TRAIL,
  followed by receptor trimerization, recruitment of adaptor molecules (FADD) and
  activation of caspase-8 (receptor pathway). The mitochondrial pathway is initiated
  by the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c or Smac from mitochondria
  in the cytosol. Apoptosis can be inhibited by Bcl-2 or by ‘inhibitor of apoptosis
  proteins’ (IAPs). Smac promotes apoptosis by neutralizing IAP-mediated inhibition
  of caspase-3 and -9. See text for more details.
