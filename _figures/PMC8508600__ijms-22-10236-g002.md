caption: Diagrams illustrating the pathophysiological changes in Kir4.1 channel functions.
  (A) Synapses under normal conditions. (B) Synapses in disease conditions. The functions
  of astrocytic Kir4.1 channels are inhibited, under pathophysiological conditions,
  by gene mutations, expressional suppression, or pharmacological treatments. Inhibition
  of Kir4.1 channels results in an elevation of extracellular K+ levels in synapses.
  Since Kir4.1 channels play a role in maintaining the resting membrane potential
  of astrocytes, Kir4.1 channel blockade causes a depolarization (excitation) of astrocytes,
  which in turn inhibits astrocytic glutamate uptake via EAAT2. Elevated levels of
  extracellular K+ and glutamate cause a hyperexcitation of neurons. Astrocyte excitation
  also promotes an increase in the expression of BDNF by activating the Res/ERK/CREB
  pathway, which may consequently contribute to epileptogenesis via enhancing neural
  connectivity, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis.

  description: Diagrams illustrating the pathophysiological changes in Kir4.1 channel
    functions. (A) Synapses under normal conditions. (B) Synapses in disease conditions.
    The functions of astrocytic Kir4.1 channels are inhibited, under pathophysiological
    conditions, by gene mutations, expressional suppression, or pharmacological treatments.
    Inhibition of Kir4.1 channels results in an elevation of extracellular K+ levels
    in synapses. Since Kir4.1 channels play a role in maintaining the resting membrane
    potential of astrocytes, Kir4.1 channel blockade causes a depolarization (excitation)
    of astrocytes, which in turn inhibits astrocytic glutamate uptake via EAAT2. Elevated
    levels of extracellular K+ and glutamate cause a hyperexcitation of neurons. Astrocyte
    excitation also promotes an increase in the expression of BDNF by activating the
    Res/ERK/CREB pathway, which may consequently contribute to epileptogenesis via
    enhancing neural connectivity, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis.
