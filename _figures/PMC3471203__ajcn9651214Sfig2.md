caption: 'A, B: Proposed metabolic pathway and chemical structures of lycopene found
  in human plasma and tissues. Cleavage of cis-lycopene by BCO2 may occur at either
  the 9,10 or 9′,10′ double bond to produce apo-10′-lycopenal, which can be oxidized
  to apo-10′-lycopenoic acid or reduced to apo-10′-lycopenol. Adapted with permission
