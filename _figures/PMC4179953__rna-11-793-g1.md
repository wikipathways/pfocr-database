caption: Figure 1. Proposed involvement of RNA processing factors in the accumulation
  and function of Pol IV- and Pol V-dependent lncRNAs in the RdDM pathway. Upper panel,
  Pol V occupancy in the chromatin requires the chromatin-remodeling complex DDR as
  well as SUVH2 and SUVH9 that are methyl-DNA binding proteins. Pol V lncRNAs may
  have triphosphates or caps at their 5′ ends and are devoid of 3′-end polyadenylation.
  AtRRP6L1 helps retain Pol V lncRNAs in the chromatin for a scaffold function. STA1
  and RDM16, two splicing factors that seem to function separately, affect the levels
  of Pol V lncRNAs via unclear mechanisms. Lower panel, Pol IV can be recruited to
  its target loci by physical interaction with SHH1 that binds methylated histone
  H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me). RDR2 associates with Pol IV and requires CLSY1 for synthesis
  of double-stranded RNAs using Pol IV-transcribed lncRNAs as templates. AtRRP6L1
  may help retain Pol IV lncRNAs in the Pol IV transcription complex to facilitate
  RDR2 transcription. Accumulation of Pol IV-dependent siRNAs is reduced to varying
  extents by mutations in pre-mRNA splicing factors, including STA1, ZOP1, SR45, MAC3A,
  MAC3B, MOS4, MOS12, and MOS14. The complementary pairing between scaffold lncRNAs
  and siRNAs leads to de novo DNA methylation in this canonical RdDM pathway.
