caption: (i) LLPS of the PKA regulatory subunit RIα is dynamically regulated by cAMP.
  Binding of cAMP to RIα induces a conformational change that releases the PKA catalytic
  (C) subunit from its interaction with the RIα inhibitory sequence (IS), exposing
  the disordered RIα linker region. (ii) RIα biomolecular condensates play a key role
  in compartmentalizing cAMP to ensure signaling specificity. RIα condensates dynamically
  sequester and trap cAMP, lowering cytosolic free cAMP concentrations, while PDEs
  catalytically degrade excess free cAMP into AMP. Combined, these two processes enable
  PDEs to establish cAMP-free nanodomains that set the boundaries of cAMP signaling
  compartments.
