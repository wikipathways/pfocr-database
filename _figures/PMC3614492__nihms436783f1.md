caption: The extracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is maintained by the coordinated actions
  of hormones, bone cells and balanced uptake and excretion of Ca2+ in intestine and
  kidney. The internal Ca2+ homeostasis is achieved through the exquisite choreography
  of the Ca2+signaling toolkits. Under resting conditions, cytosolic Ca2+ is maintained
  at submicromolar range by extruding Ca2+ outside of the plasma membrane via plasma
  membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), or by pumping Ca2+ back
  into internal stores through sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA)
  or secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase (SPCA). Upon extracellular stimulation, the free
  cytosolic Ca2+ rapidly increases by the entry of extracellular Ca2+ across the plasma
  membrane via Ca2+ channels, including voltage-operated channels (VOC), receptor-operated
  channels (ROC), transient receptor potential ion-channel (TRP) and store-operated
  channels (SOC), or by the release of Ca2+ from internal stores (e.g., endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex) through inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptors
  (IP3R) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) due to activation of membrane receptors (G
  protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinase [RTK]) and the subsequent
  synthesis of IP3. In mitochondria, Ca2+ can easily pass through outer mitochondrial
  membrane pores and cross the inner mitochondrial membrane through the membrane-embedded
  Ca2+ uniporter (MCU). Ca2+ exits mitochondria through the opening of a nonselective
  high-conductance channel permeability transition pore (PTP) in the inner mitochondrial
  membrane and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). The Ca2+ signals are delivered by affecting
  the activity of Ca2+ buffers, Ca2+ effectors and Ca2+-regulated enzymes. Ca2+-binding
  proteins have Ca2+ affinities that vary by 106-fold or more depending upon their
  locations and functions (left panel). Ca2+ can exert short-term effects by triggering
  neurotransmitter release within microseconds. The signals can also elicit “long-term”
  effects by modulating gene expression (right panel).
