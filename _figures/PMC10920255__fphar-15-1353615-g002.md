caption: Gut bacteria and their metabolites can reach blood vessels, exert local effects
  in joints, modify macrophage-mediated inflammation and influence GA pain through
  breaches in the intestinal barrier. (A) LPS activates TLR4 receptors on macrophage
  membranes and induces IL-1β secretion via the TLR4/NK-κB pathway, causing GA inflammation
  and pain; (B) SCFAs and LPS affect GA pain by activating or inhibiting the NLRP3
  pathway in macrophages, regulating IL-1β release; (C) P2X7R pathway activation following
  dysbiosis further regulates inflammatory signaling (e.g., the NLRP3 pathway), promoting
  mature IL-1β secretion and amplifying pain; (D) Complement activation by gut microbes
  may modulate GA pain by influencing metabolite levels and IL-1β secretion; (E) Gut
  microbiota may influence the NF-κB pathway by regulating ADPN expression in macrophages,
  affecting IL-1β maturation and secretion; (F) After MSU enters into macrophages
  via cytosolic mode, it promotes the conversion of Pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β through
  NLRP3/ASC/Caspase-1-mediated inflammatory events.(G) Anti-GA drugs could affect
  macrophage-mediated GA pain mechanisms by influencing gut microbiota and metabolite
  concentrations; (H) TCM modulates macrophage immunity and inflammation alleviating
  GA pain through gut microbes and metabolites; (I) FMT is likely to treat GA pain
  by affecting BUA levels and inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization via gut microbes;
  (J) Probiotics reduce GA pain by restoring the intestinal barrier and inhibiting
  NLRP3 in macrophages, reducing inflammatory factors like IL-1β secretion
