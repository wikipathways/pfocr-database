caption: Non-cycling mechanisms of oxidative stress induced by metals in ambient air
  particulate matter. Redox inert PM metal ions of Pb, Cr, Cd, Zn and As, as well
  as those of some redox active metals like V and Hg, can interact with cysteinyl
  thiols in glutathione (GSH) and regulatory proteins. Direct or H2O2-mediated inhibition
  of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) increases levels of reduced
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), while inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) allows unopposed
  basal kinase activity in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and downstream
  signaling through mitogen activating kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB)
  and phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K/Akt), leading to downstream signaling,
  inflammatory gene expression and activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX), a source of
  H2O2. Metal effects on mitochondrial proteins impairs electron flow, increasing
  the production of superoxide anion (O2.−) which is dismutated to H2O2 by superoxide
  dismutase (SOD). Dysregulation of Ca2+ transport increases its levels in the mitochondria
  and the cytosol, promoting the opening of the membrane permeability transition pore
  (MPTP) and the activation of NOX by kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC). Oxidative
  effects are potentiated by direct metal interaction with thiol-containing antioxidant
  enzymes glutathione reductase (GR), thioredoxin (Trx) and Trx-system proteins thioredoxin
  reductase (TrxR) and peroxiredoxin (Prx). Evidence is mounting for a pro-oxidant
  role of Prx in mediating intracellular reactions of H2O2. Binding to the metal sensing
  module in Keap1 leads to the activation of nuclear erythroid factor 2 kinase, hemeoxygenase-1
  expression and adaptation. Metal-induced activation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)
  can lead to apoptosis through the activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced
  channel (MAC). Activating processes are depicted by blue arrows, inhibitory effects
  are shown in red arrows.
