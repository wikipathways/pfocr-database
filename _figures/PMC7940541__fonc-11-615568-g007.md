caption: 'A schematic model: the mechanisms through which huaier extract inhibits
  the growth of prostate cancer. The effects of huaier extract in prostate cancer
  shown in this study are: (1) down-regulation the expression of AR-FL/AR-V7 both
  in mRNA and protein levels via targeting SMYD3 signal pathway and USP14 related
  ubiquitin–proteasome system; (2) reducing the nuclear translocation of AR-FL as
  well as the nuclear accumulation of AR-V7, which, in turn, inhibits their transcriptional
  activity as transcription factors to their target genes; (3) enhancing enzalutamide
  treatment.'
