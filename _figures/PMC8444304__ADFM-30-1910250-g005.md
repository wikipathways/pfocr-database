caption: 'The circuitry of the basal ganglia. The nigrostriatal pathway is the main
  neuronal pathway degenerated in Parkinson''s disease and is composed by midbrain
  substantia nigra (SN) dopamine neurons that project toward GABA medium spiny neurons
  in the striatum (STR). The nigrostriatal pathway is itself embedded in a broader
  circuitry: the basal ganglia. Within basal ganglia, each neuronal cluster can exert
  excitatory (with glutamate neurons), inhibitory (with GABAergic neurons), or modulatory
  (with dopamine neurons) action. SNc: substantia nigra pars compacta; SNr: substantia
  nigra pars reticulata; STN: subthalamic nucleus; GPe: globus pallidus external;
  and GPi: globus pallidus internal.'
