caption: Possible mechanism of intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW). Muscle
  atrophy is caused by an imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation. The
  ubiquitin–proteasome pathway and autophagy–lysosome system are activated during
  this period, leading to massive degradation of muscle proteins. ROS released after
  mitochondrial damage also induce proteolysis. The agrin-MuSK-Lrp4 signaling pathway
  is impaired during abnormal NMJ function, leading to muscle atrophy. Finally, inflammatory
  factors can cause axonal swelling in motor neurons, resulting in neurapraxia.
