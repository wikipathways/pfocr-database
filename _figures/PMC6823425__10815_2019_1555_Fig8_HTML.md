caption: A schematic diagram summarizing the possible molecular pathway regulated
  by FoxO transcription factors in arrested (FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 knock down) mouse
  preimplantation embryo development. Knockdown of FoxO transcription factors leads
  to upregulation of apoptosis (FASL and CLEAVED CASPASE 3) and cell cycle arrest
  (p53 and p21) in arrested preimplantation embryos. Moreover, there seems to be an
  autofeedback mechanism where FOXOs regulate SIRT1 protein expression. FoxO1 downregulation
  leads to decreased cytoplasmic expression of SIRT1 while FoxO3 and FoxO4 downregulations
  lead to increased nuclear expression of SIRT1. Green color represents increased
  expression, and red color represents decreased expression
