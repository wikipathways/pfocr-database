caption: A pathway representation of all the tryptophan related genes analyzed. The
  figure was created by Ingenuity Pathway Studio, by importing the frequency of differential
  expression along with the gene name. The genes were then mapped and the frequency
  of differential expression was overlaid on top of the respective gene. The numbers
  below each gene represent the number of datasets in which a t-test of the gene's
  expression level resulted in p ≥ 0.05. The intensity of the coloration is provided
  to show respectively the number of datasets in which differential expression occurred.
  Gene names are capitalized and small molecules are lower case.
