caption: Overview of miRNA Biogenesis. (A) Intergenic primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs)
  undergo co-transcriptional microprocessing via DGCR8/DROSHA to produce precursor
  miRNA (pre-miRNA). (B) In intronic miRNAs, microprocessing occurs during intron
  commitment for splicing and generally completes before the intron is spliced. (C)
  Mirtrons are a special class of intronic miRNAs whereby pre-miRNAs are derived directly
  from intron splicing and (D) lariat debranching by DBR1. (E) Canonical and mirtron
  pre-miRNAs join a common pathway of Exportin-5 mediated cytoplasmic export, after
  which (F) DICER cleavage produces a miRNA duplex. (G) miRNA duplexes are loaded
  onto Argonaute (Ago) proteins whereby strand selection occurs. (H) Retention of
  the miRNA guide strand by Ago is critical to the formation of the RNA induced silencing
  complex (RISC) which (I) targets protein-coding mRNAs promoting either transcript
  degradation or inhibiting translation. Pol II = RNA Polymerase II.
