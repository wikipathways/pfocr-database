caption: 'Three types of autophagy and cellular and molecular events in an autophagic
  pathway. (A) There are three types of autophagy. In macroautophagy, which is the
  main route of cellular degradation, an autophagosome (a double-layered membrane
  vesicle) is formed, which fuses with lysosomes to degrade the cellular constituents
  or pathogens. Microautophagy is characterized by the removal of cellular constituents
  via the budding of an autophagic body at the lysosomal membrane. In chaperone-mediated
  autophagy, a signaling motif that contains molecules is transported with the chaperone
  HSC70 via the LAMP-2A protein into lysosomes. (B) The autophagic pathway consists
  of three distinct stages. For process initiation, nucleation of the autophagic vesicle
  is needed. Atg6 (Beclin-1) and type III PI3-kinase are required for the initiation
  of isolation-membrane formation. Elongation and closure of the autophagosome membrane
  are regulated by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems: LC3 and Atg12 conjugation
  systems. The autophagosome fuses with lysosomes and subsequently matures into an
  autolysosome to degrade the materials present inside the cell.'
