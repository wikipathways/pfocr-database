caption: Known biosynthetic pathways to cysteine. (A) Pathway in enteric bacteria.
  The question marks indicate a step that is incompletely characterized but in which
  cysteine may be formed by hydrolysis or by reduction with glutathione, also generating
  sulfate or sulfite, respectively (). CoA, coenzyme A. (B) The transsulfuration pathway
  in animals. The first three reactions involve methyl group transfer via S-adenosylmethionine.
