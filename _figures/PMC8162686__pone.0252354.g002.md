caption: The schematic figure shows the combination of several metabolic pathways
  from glycolysis to lipogenesis (fatty acid synthesis and mevalonate pathway). Glucose-derived
  citrate is converted to acetyl-CoA by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), which is used as
  a precursor in fatty acid and the mevalonate synthesis pathways. This current study
  identified 1073 genes as the downstream genes of Peg3 from genome-wide scanning
  of ChIP-seq peaks. More than 30 pathways were examined to test if there were any
  overlapping genes between these pathways and the genes identified from ChIP-seq
  analysis using the Kegg pathway database (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/). Initial analysis
  identified several key genes critical for lipogenesis, including Acly, Idh1, Fasn,
  and Hmgcr.
