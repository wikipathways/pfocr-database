caption: Pathways of ceramide synthesis and degradation. Ceramide de novo synthesis
  from serine and palmitate is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase and contributes
  to around 30% of the total ceramide pool. This pathway is activated in hypoxia and
  inflammation and is inhibited by myriocin. The salvage pathway forms ceramides from
  sphingosine catalyzed by ceramide synthases (CerS1–CerS6) with tissue and ceramide
  species synthesis specificity. CerS1, CerS2, and CerS5 are all expressed in the
  myocardium, and CerS2 mediates synthesis of long‐chain ceramides C22–C24. This pathway
  can be inhibited by fumonisin. The sphingomyelin pathway is catalyzed by sphingomyelinase.
