caption: Factors of mitochondrial fitness. Nutrients such as glucose or fatty acids
  enable tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).
  During OXPHOS reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced and ROS-levels are massively
  increased, when the OXPHOS system is dysfunctional. Mitochondria are directly involved
  in the innate immune response and inflammation by RIG-1 like receptor (RLR) activated
  mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) system and the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing
  protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome interaction. Mitochondria can change their morphology
  by fusion or fission with functional implications, for example on mitochondrial
  localization, mitochondrial quality control or bioenergetics efficiency. They increase
  their numbers or density by mitochondrial biogenesis and control cell death and
  differentiation. An important alternative pathway to OXPHOS to generate energy in
  the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is glycolysis.
