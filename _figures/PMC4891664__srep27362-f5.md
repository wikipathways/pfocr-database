caption: IRE1s from yeast, Arabidopsis and human are divided in sensor, TMD, linker,
  kinase and RNase domains (upper panel). Upon sensing the unfolded settings (indicated
  by green circle) by sensor domains, IRE1s were activated to process their mRNA targets
  (lower panel). Blue box (lower panel) represents the functional conservation between
  bZIP60 and HAC1p, as reported. The red box in the lower panel indicates the divergence
  among HAC1, bZIP60 and XBP1, demonstrated by non-permission of heterogeneous processing/interactions
  and by the inability of XBP1 to replace HAC1p in yeast. Black boxes (upper panel)
  indicate conservation found in IRE1 orthologues, including the heterogeneous formation
  of IRE-mediated foci, the interaction of IRE1B with IRE1p and the same molecular
  mechanism underlying responses of cytosolic domains of IRE1s to specific inhibitors.
  Red circles labelled with P indicate the phosphorylation of IRE1 orthologues in
  their kinase domains (upper panel), and a red circle indicates the unconventional
  intron in bZIP60 U, which is omitted in HAC1 U and and XBP1 U (lower panel).
