caption: 'Metabolic activation of glutathione-conjugates to reactive thiols. Halogenated
  alkenes (X represents the alkene and Y a halogen molecule: fluorine, chlorine, or
  bromine) have been shown to be metabolized to nephrotoxins via this pathway (,,).
  The haloge-nated alkenes form glutathione-S-conjugates, which are cleaved to cysteinyl-glycine-conjugates
  by GGT. Aminodipeptidase cleaves the cysteinyl-glycine-conjugates to cysteine-conjugates.
  Cysteine-S-con-jugate beta-lyase catalyzes the production of unstable reactive thiols,
  which are toxic. We propose that cisplatin is metabolized through this same pathway.
  In the proposed pathway, Y would represent one of the chlorines in cisplatin and
  X would represent the remainder of the cisplatin molecule. In the proposed pathway,
  the sulfur of the gluta-thione molecule binds to the platinum displacing the chlorine.'
