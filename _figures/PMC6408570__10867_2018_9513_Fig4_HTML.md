caption: Schematic illustration of the Notch–Delta–Jagged signaling pathway. The trans-activation
  occurs when the receptor (Notch) of the receiver cell interacts with the ligand
  of the sender cell (Delta or Jagged) or with external ligands in a soluble form
  (Dext or Jext). The released signal NICD activates the expression of Notch and Jagged
  and inhibits the expression of Delta. The cis-inhibition occurs between the receptor
  and ligand in the same cell and leads to the degradation of both proteins
