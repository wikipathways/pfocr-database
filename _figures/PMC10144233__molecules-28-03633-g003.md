caption: The three known pathways for the heme b biosynthesis. In the protoporphyrin-dependent
  (PPD) and coproporphyrin-dependent (CPD) pathways, the four methyl groups of heme
  b are the result of the stepwise decarboxylation of the acetate side chains of uroporphyrinogen
  III (UPG III), with four methyl groups produced at the C2, C7, C12, and C18 positions.
  The SHD pathway involves the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methylation
  of the C2 and C7 positions of the tetrapyrrole backbone.
