caption: The target gene regulatory network, NF-κB/RelA:P50. The most common NF-κB
  in the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway is a heterodimer that is composed of RelA
  and P50. RelA and P50 also can form homodimers and regulate gene expression. The
  regulatory relationships of NF-κB/RelA:P50 were obtained from the TRANFAC database
  and the MetaCore™ analytical suite, which both are knowledge bases, and the data
  were collected from manually curated peer-reviewed literature. Based on these databases,
  we filtered out some target genes of NF-κB/RelA:P50 that expressed insignificantly
  in the LPS-induced gene profiles. The regulatory network of NF-κB/RelA:P50 finally
  consisted of 54 total target genes with 77 transcription regulatory interactions.
