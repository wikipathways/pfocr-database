caption: Metabolic pathways for the production of fatty acids and derived compounds.
  Enzymes and arrows are shown in green, if the pathway to which they belong departs
  from the wild-type fatty acid metabolism. The end products are shown in gray boxes.
  Appropriate deletions or homologous overexpressions within the wild-type pathway
  are not highlighted in this figure. For details, the reader is referred to the text.
