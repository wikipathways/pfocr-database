caption: Model of cofilin regulating actin dynamics and initiating HSV-1 entry. During
  early infection, the virus induces cofilin inactivation and F-actin polymerization
  via the EGFR-PI3K-Erk1/2-ROCK-LIMK signaling pathway, which may promote receptor
  clustering and initiate the entry process. Lipid rafts are clustered and serve as
  signaling platforms for EGFR-mediated cofilin inactivation. Subsequent viral penetration
  requires F-actin depolymerization through cofilin activation. Thus, the biphasic
  activation of cofilin represents specific cellular machinery usurped by HSV-1.
