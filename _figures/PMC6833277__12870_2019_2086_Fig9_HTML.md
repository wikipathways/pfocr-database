caption: A proposed salt-responsive regulatory mechanism of ICL that can shift energy
  metabolism from the TCA cycle to the glyoxylate cycle during salt stress. Salt stress
  in conjunction with CaM induces expression of aconitase, isocitrate lyase and malate
  synthase genes []. In the glyoxylate cycle, ICL generates one NADH from catalyzing
  malate to oxaloacetate and one FADH2 by catalyzing succinate to fumarate bypassing
  the two decarboxylation steps of the TCA cycle. Two steps of the glyoxylate cycle
  use the acetyl unit from acetyl-CoA, namely, conversion of glyoxylate to malate
  and the subsequent conversion of oxaloacetate to citrate. Under salt stress, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex are inhibited []. The respiratory
  metabolism was previously proposed to be shifted to the GABA shunt pathway to provide
  alternative carbon source []. Because the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is sensitive
  to salt stress, pyruvate might instead be fluxed to pyruvate carboxylase to generate
  oxaloacetate. Additionally, as 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is inhibited
  under salt stress, the disrupted TCA cycle could lead to metabolite flux into the
  glyoxylate cycle to bypass the salt-inhibited enzymes
