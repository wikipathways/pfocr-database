caption: 'Mechanisms of resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors. Inhibition of MAPK signaling
  by G12C inhibitors induces feedback reactivation of MAPK via multiple receptor tyrosine
  kinases, including FGFR1 and ERBB family members. While FGFR1 and ERBB3 reactivate
  the MAPK signaling pathway through adaptor protein SHP2, IGF1R leads to SHP2-independent
  activation of the PI3K signaling pathway. Additionally, activation of EGFR and Aurora
  kinase following KRAS G12C inhibitor treatment leads to protein synthesis and activation
  of KRAS G12C. The newly synthesized and activated G12C proteins are resistant to
  KRAS G12C inhibition due to their GTP-bound form. Furthermore, mutations in MAPK
  proteins can induce constitutive MAPK activation in the presence of KRAS G12C inhibitors.
  Activation of PI3K and MAPK leads to transcription of genes related to cell proliferation
  and survival (black arrow). Abbreviations: EGFR, Epidermal growth factor receptor;
  ERBB, Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase; FGFR1, Fibroblast growth factor receptor
  1; IGF1R, Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor; MAPK, Mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; SHP2, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2.'
