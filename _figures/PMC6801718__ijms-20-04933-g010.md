caption: Summary of data showing TGF-β1 recruitment of miR-143 and miR-145 to RISC
  to destabilize CFTR mRNA and impair the corrector/potentiator-mediated rescue of
  F508del-CFTR. miR-143 and miR-145 are transcriptionally regulated by the canonical
  Smad2/3 TGF-β1 signaling pathway. Modulating the total cellular miRNA levels is
  not sufficient to regulate expression of CFTR. Selective RISC recruitment of the
  experimentally validated CFTR inhibitors, miR-143 and miR-145, by TGF-β1 destabilizes
  CFTR mRNA, decreases CFTR protein translation, and impairs the corrector/potentiator-mediated
  rescue of CFTR protein and channel function in F508del HBE cells. Predicted CFTR
  inhibitor, miR-154 was upregulated but not recruited to RISC by TGF-β1, and thus
  it is not predicted to play a role in TGF-β1-induced degradation of CFTR mRNA. ER,
  endoplasmic reticulum; TβR-I, TGF-β receptor I; Ago2, Argonaute2; RISC, RNA-induced
  silencing complex.
