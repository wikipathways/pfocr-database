caption: 'Pathways involved in platelet hyperreactivity in DM patients and therapeutic
  targets. AGE: advanced glycation end products, RAGE: AGE receptors, PKA/B/C: protein
  kinase A/B/C, MAPK: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, TK: tyrosine kinase, NO:
  nitric oxide, GC: guanylate cyclase, PAR-1 TR: protease activated receptor; thrombin
  receptor, PI-3: phosphoinositol-3 kinase TRA: thrombin receptor antagonist, TPα:
  thromboxane receptor, TPRA: thromboxane receptor antagonist, and ASA: acetylsalicylic
  acid (aspirin). Increased levels of cAMP lead to platelet inhibition through cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase (PKA) which inhibits signaling though the mitogen-activated protein
  kinases pathway, receptor activation, thromboxane A2 formation, and activation of
  key enzymes such as protein kinase C. The prostaglandin, P2Y, P2X, TR, and TP are
  all seven transmembrane G-protein associated receptors. The TR and TP on the right
  present novel drug targets; their intracellular effectors are omitted for clarity.
  Antiplatelet drugs are shown in red.'
