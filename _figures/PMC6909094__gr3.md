caption: Schematic presentation of the ornithine pathway during L-proline synthesis
  which occurs in mitochondria and cytoplasm/chloroplast. Synthesis of L-proline occurs
  in the cytosol as well as in the chloroplast, while L-proline degradation is implemented
  in the mitochondrion.
papertitle: Regulation of L-proline biosynthesis, signal transduction, transport,
  accumulation and its vital role in plants during variable environmental conditions.
