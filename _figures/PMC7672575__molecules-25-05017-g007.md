caption: The potential antiviral mechanisms of action for honey contain caffeic acid,
  CAPE, galangin, and chrysin against SARS-CoV-2. Through an endosomal pathway, SARS-CoV-2
  enters the host cell upon binding its S protein to the cellular receptor ACE2. (A)
  The viral RNA is unveiled in the cytoplasm and the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins cleaved
  by the proteases (3CLpro and PLpro) to form nonstructural proteins (nsps) as helicase
  (for viral RNA synthesis) and the RNA replicase–transcriptase complex (RTC), which
  includes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (for virion assembly). RdRp is responsible
  for the replication of structural protein RNA. The nucleocapsids residing in the
  cytoplasm are assembled from genomic RNA, whereas the structural proteins S1, S2,
  E, and M are translated by ribosomes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and then
  released for preparation of virion assembly. The structural proteins then fuse with
  virion assembly to virus assembling, which is then transported through the Golgi
  apparatus to be released via exocytosis. (B) When honey containing caffeic acid
  (Caf), CAPE, galangin (Gal), and chrysin (ChR) is being consumed, those compounds
  could enter the infected cells and inhibit 3CLpro. This inhibition is based on the
  chemical interactions of these compounds with 3CLpro amino acid residues; (1) Caf
  with GLN-189, HIE-164 through hydrogen (H) bonding, and with HIE-41 through π–π
  stacking interaction. (2) CAPE with THR-24 and THR-26 through H-bonding, and with
  HIE-41 through π–π interaction. (3) Chr with SER-46, THR-24 and THR-26 through H-bonding,
  and with HIE41 through π–π interaction. (4) Gal with SER-46 and THR-24 through H-bonding,
  and with HIE-41 through π–π interaction. As a result, the process of pp1a and pp1ab
  polyprotein cleavage will fail to form nsps and RdRp, which means that protein replication
  cannot be completed and finally, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be stopped.
