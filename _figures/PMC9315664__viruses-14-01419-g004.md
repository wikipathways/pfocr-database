caption: Immune response and inflammatory reactions regulated by the interaction of
  PCV and host factors. PCV infection can not only activate the production of IFNs
  but also inhibit IFNs, forming complex crosstalks between host proteins and PCV2,
  leading to immunosuppression and persistent infection. During infection, the viral
  Cap inhibits ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of cellular C1QBP (gC1qR),
  thus enhancing the phagocytic activity through the PI3K pathway. The interaction
  of viral Cap and host C1QBP also promotes phosphorylation of cGAS via PI3K/Akt and
  PKCδ signal pathways, leading to the release of cGAMP, dimerization, and translocation
  of STING into the nucleus, and thus an enhancement of type I IFN production. Additionally,
  PCV2 activates RIG-1/MDA-5/MAVS/IRFs and MyD88-IKKα-IRFs pathways to enhance the
  type I IFN responses. On the contrary, HDAC6 mediates the ubiquitination of cGAS
  to degrade cGAS in autolysosomes. Furthermore, PCV blocks the nuclear translocation
  of p-IRF3 by destroying the interaction between KPNA and p-IRF3 and inactivating
  STING through the p38-MAPK pathway, thus inhibiting the induction of type I IFN.
  Moreover, PCV modulates inflammatory responses through PI3K/Akt, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB
  pathways to inhibit antiviral responses and the maturation of immune cells. Activation
  of the NF-κB pathway is critical for inflammatory reactions during PCV infection.
  The interaction between viral Cap and host C1QBP induces the activation of PI3K/Akt
  and p38 MAPK signals, thus enhancing the production of IL-10. In addition, PCV2
  induces IL-8, IL-1β, and IL-10 via the TLR/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover,
  the RGS16 interacts with viral ORF3 protein and participates in the nuclear transport
  of the ORF3. However, the interaction between virus ORF3 and RGS16 in the cytoplasm
  also causes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of RGS16, which further enhances
  nuclear entry of NF-κB through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and increases IL-6 and
  IL-8. On the contrary, PCV2 enhances the interaction of the SOCS3 and STAT3/TRAF2,
  resulting in the downregulation of secreted IL-6 and TNF-α signaling, further decreasing
  the maturation of MoDCs and antigen presentation by DCs. The PKR signaling pathway
  activates eIF2α to inhibit virus protein. However, the viral cap can interact with
  DNAJC7 to inhibit the activation of PKR.
