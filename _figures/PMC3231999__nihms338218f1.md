caption: In macrophages, P. gingivalis is recognized by the CD14/TLR2/TLR1 receptor
  complex ). This interaction activates inside-out signaling, propagated by Rac1,
  PI3K, and cytohesin-1 (Cyt-1), which induces the high-affinity conformation of CR3
  ,). CR3 then binds and internalizes P. gingivalis; this is a relatively safe portal
  of entry since CR3 is not linked to vigorous microbicidal mechanisms. The CR3-P.
  gingivalis interaction also leads to induction of ERK1/2 signaling. This in turn
  downregulates IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA expression ), possibly through suppression
  of a critical transcription factor (the interferon regulatory factors 1; IRF-1),
  required for IL-12 expression ). This suppressive effect is specific for IL-12 and
  does not affect induction of other proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6,
  and TNF-α). Inhibition of bioactive IL-12 by this mechanism results in impaired
  immune clearance of P. gingivalis in vivo ). Moreover, P. gingivalis uses its gingipains
  to attack C5 and release biologically active C5a ,). Upon C5aR binding, C5a stimulates
  Gαi-dependent intracellular Ca2+signaling which synergistically enhances the otherwise
  weak cAMP responses induced by TLR2/TLR1 activation alone. Maximal cAMP induction
  is achieved by the participation of another G protein-coupled receptor, the CXCR4,
  which interacts directly by P. gingivalis and coassociates with both TLR2 and C5aR
  in lipid rafts ,). The ensuing activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A
  (PKA) pathway inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and impairs the inducible
  nitrogen synthase (iNOS)-dependent killing of the pathogen in macrophages in vitro
  and in vivo ).
