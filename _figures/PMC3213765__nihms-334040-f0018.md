caption: The Notch signaling pathway. Notch signaling is mediated by two cells; one
  providing the transmembrane ligands Delta and Jagged, the other the single transmembrane
  receptor, Notch, that transmits the signals. Upon ligand binding, the intracellular
  domain (ICD) is clipped by the γ-secretase at the membrane, is translocated to the
  nucleus where it enters in a complex with other proteins, and induces transcription
  of specific targets including the basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors,
  Hes1 and Hes5.
