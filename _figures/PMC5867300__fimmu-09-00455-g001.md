caption: 'Immune modulatory signaling in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) induced by
  binding of interleukin-10 (IL-10) to the IL-10 receptor. Activation of the IL-10/Janus
  kinase 1 (JAK1)/tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) pathway in APCs results in the phosphorylation of STAT3 by the interleukin
  10 receptor (IL-10R) complex and the subsequent translocation of STAT3 homodimers
  into the nucleus. There STAT3 homodimers bind to STAT-binding elements and drive
  the expression of STAT-3-responsive genes such as suppressor of cytokine signaling
  3 (SOCS-3) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN): SOCS-3 efficiently inhibits mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAP kinase) activation, NFκB translocation into the nucleus, and
  the subsequent induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression, while the decoy protein
  IL-1RN suppresses pro-inflammatory signaling normally initiated by binding of IL-1β
  to its receptor. STAT3 activation also inhibits STAT6 activation and therefore the
  expression of IL-4/IL-13-responsive genes. By these events, IL-10 reduces the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha) and diminished
  expression of both major histocompatibility complex II and co-stimulatory molecules
  (CD80, CD83, CD86) on APCs. Black arrows: activation of the indicated signaling
  pathways, orange arrows: inhibition of the indicated signaling pathways, black dashed
  arrows: pathways normally induced by the indicated molecules that are inhibited
  in the presence of STAT3 activation. For more detailed information, see Section
  “.”'
