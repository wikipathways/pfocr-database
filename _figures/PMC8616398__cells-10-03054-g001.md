caption: 'A schematic view of intracellular and extracellular adenosinergic pathways
  in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor cells operate a canonical ATP/CD39/CD73
  pathway and non-canonical NAD+CD38/CD203 pathway. The canonical pathway involves
  sequential hydrolysis of ATP to ADP to AMP mediated by CD39 and CD73 to produce
  ADO. The non-canonical pathway involves the use of NAD+ as a substrate by CD38 to
  generate ADP-ribose, which is processed by CD203a to AMP and then by CD73 to ADO.
  Once generated, ADO is either metabolized to inosine by adenosine deaminase (cADA)
  or transported to the extracellular space by nucleoside transporters. Extracelular
  (e)ADO interacts with ADORs (type 1 purinergic (P1) receptors) broadly expressed
  on all cells in the TME, including tumor cells. ADO signals may be inhibitory or
  stimulatory, depending on the type of adenosine receptors (ADORs: A1, A2a, A2b,
  A3). Tumor cells produce and release extracellular vesicles called exosomes (TEX).
  These are released into extracellular space in large numbers and carry surface ectonucleotidases
  CD39/CD73. In the presence of ATP excess in the TME, TEX produce ADO. They also
  carry intraluminal ADO and deliver it to recipient cells upon uptake into cytosol.
  TEX also deliver biologically active CD39/CD73 to recipient cells, providing them
  with the enzymatic capability to metabolize ATP into ADO. TEX emerge as a major
  driver of ADO-mediated signaling in the TME.'
