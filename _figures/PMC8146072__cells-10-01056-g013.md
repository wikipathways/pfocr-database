caption: Regulation of apoptosis through metabolism in cancer. Apoptosis can be induced
  via intrinsic or extrinsic stress. Intrinsic stress results in the activation of
  pro-apoptotic proteins that then activate B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X
  protein (BAX) and Bcl-2-homologous antagonist killer (BAK) in the mitochondria to
  facilitate cytochrome c (cyt c) release via mitochondrial outer membrane polarization.
  Cytochrome c release results in the formation of the apoptosome, which leads to
  the activation of caspase 3 (Casp3) and caspase 7 (Casp7). Casp3 and Casp7 then
  induce apoptosis. Extrinsic stress results in the formation of the Death Inducing
  Signaling Complex (DISC), which can directly activate apoptosis or trigger intrinsic
  apoptosis via BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (BID) cleavage to truncated BID
  (tBID). Cancer avoids apoptosis through multiple metabolism-mediated mechanisms,
  including reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the upregulation of glycolysis
  and glucose uptake, inhibition of pro-apoptotic proteins via growth factor signaling,
  inhibition of cyt c release via upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  inhibition of BID cleavage via hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), and inhibition
  of effector caspases via the upregulation of ceramide metabolism. Akt; protein kinase

  protein 2, BCL-XL; Bcl-extra-large, MCL-1; myeloid-cell leukemia 1, NOXA; phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced
