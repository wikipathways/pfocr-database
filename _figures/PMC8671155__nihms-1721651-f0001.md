caption: In mammalian cells, repair of DNA double-strand breaks occur via non-homologous
  end joining during all cell cycle phases and, depending on the structure of the
  ends, can generate small deletions or insertions (green) at the junction. In S and
  G2 phases of the cell cycle, resection of 5′ strands is much more efficient than
  in G1 or G0 phase. Removal of the 5′ strand generates a long, single-stranded 3′
  end which is used for strand invasion into unbroken sister chromatids or homologous
  duplexes. One possible outcome is the formation of a double-Holliday junction and
  resolution as shown. Resection can also generate intermediates that are used in
  single-strand annealing, and resection-dependent DNA synthesis can also generate
  3′ single-stranded ends that are joined by synthesis-dependent strand annealing.
  In S phase, lesions in the DNA template can produce single-ended DNA breaks which
  can be resolved by sister chromatid-mediated strand switching or by strand invasion
  during break-induced replication from a homologous template as shown (right). Single-ended
  breaks can also produce misrepair events such as translocations, insertions, and
  genome rearrangements.
