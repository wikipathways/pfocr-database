caption: Schema showing the major roles of butyrate in inhibiting atherosclerosis
  of mice in this study. Butyrate treatment exerts multi‐faceted beneficial metabolic
  effects, such as remodelling gut microbiota, reducing hepatic steatosis, modulating
  lipid/glucose metabolism and, especially, improving RCT by up‐regulating ABCA1 through
  Sp1 pathway, all of which may eventually lead to ameliorating the development of
  atherosclerosis
