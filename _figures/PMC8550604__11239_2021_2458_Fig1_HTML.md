caption: Assembly of FXa with the TF-FVIIa complex and functions of nascent product
  related to coagulation and cell signaling. FX interacts with an extended interface
  created by exosites on TF and FVIIa, but does not dock into the activate site of
  FVIIa (shown in blue). This stable complex assembly allows for cleavage of the activation
  peptide bond in zymogen FX, but also for thethering of the nascent product FXa which
  is involved in regulation of TF function by TFPI, the activation of FVIII in the
  antihemophilic pathway and cell signaling through PARs. Details of the assembly
  interaction and active sites can be found in reference []
