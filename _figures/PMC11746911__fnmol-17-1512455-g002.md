caption: VEGF signaling pathway. Upon binding to its receptor VEGFR-2 on the surface
  of vascular endothelial cells, VEGF first activates Src kinase, which subsequently
  phosphorylates and activates Vav2. This activation facilitates the conversion of
  Rac from its GDP-bound inactive state to its GTP-bound active state. Activated Rac
  further activates PAK (p21-activated kinase). PAK, or alternatively the activated
  Src kinase, phosphorylates VE-cadherin (Vascular Endothelial Cadherin), allowing
  β-catenin to bind to its tail. This phosphorylation mediates VE-cadherin internalization,
  resulting in a “fenestration effect,” which contributes to the development of hydrocephalus.
  In addition, activated Src kinase can also mediate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway,
  initiating a series of downstream cascade reactions
