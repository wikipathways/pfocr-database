caption: Scheme for pathways of glucose metabolism. The scheme is based on enzyme
  activities, metabolites and molecular changes in BME26 cells after glucose treatments.
  The enzymes studied are presented inside blue spheres (HK, PK, GS, GSK3, PGM, GDE,
  PEPCK and GP). Arrows next to the enzymes (↓↑) represent the oscillations in enzymatic
  activity and transcriptional response. Small spheres next enzymes (○) indicate no
  variations in these enzymes or genes compared with the control. Dashed line involves
  several enzymes steps in the pathway, and solid lid represents one enzymatic step.
  The low-glucose (B) and high-glucose (C) are compared with the control (A).
