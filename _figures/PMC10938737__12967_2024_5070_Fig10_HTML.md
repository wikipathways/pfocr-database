caption: Diagram of the formative process and mechanism of action of CLPs-miR-103a-2-5p.
  CLPs-miR-103a-2-5p are synthesized by the thin-film hydration method. Firstly, cationic
  liposomes are synthesized by assembly with DOTAP, DSPC, cholesterol, and DSPE-PEG.
  Then, liposomes and miR-103a-2-5p are mixed by oscillation. MiR-103a-2-5p suppresses
  the expression of LILRB3, resulting in the promotion of AML cell apoptosis and T-cell
  antitumor immune responses. Meanwhile, miR-103a-2-5p downregulates Nrf2/HO-1 pathway
  activity, inhibiting intracellular GSH levels and promoting ROS production, thereby
  causing tumor cell apoptosis
