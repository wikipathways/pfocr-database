caption: Schematic illustrating the proposed mechanism by which the PERK pathway modulates
  autophagy during RACK1‐mediated neuroprotection after TBI. TBI upregulates RACK1,
  which interacts with PERK and activates the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 signaling pathway, thereby
  promoting autophagy induction by increasing the transcription of multiple autophagy‐related
  genes, including LC3, Atg5, and Beclin1. Thus, RACK1 upregulation alleviates neuronal
  apoptosis after TBI
