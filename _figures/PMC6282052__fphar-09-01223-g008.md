caption: Schematic figure for PTS-mediated signaling pathways. PTS induces anticancer
  effect through an arrest of the cell cycle at G1 phase and apoptosis via down-regulation
  of Mcl-1 and up-regulation of both Bak- and PUMA which induce mitochondrial dysfunction
  in CRPC cells. Furthermore, both Akt-dependent and -independent mTOR/p70S6K pathway
  are involved in PTS-mediated pathways. Disturbance of lipid raft and cholesterol
  contents may, at least partly, explain the dissociation and inactivation of Akt,
  mTOR, and p70S6K in CRPC cells.
