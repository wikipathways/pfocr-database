caption: The classical and alternative NF-κB signaling pathways are represented downstream
  of CD40 and BAFF-R. Arrows indicate activating steps, and bars indicate inhibitory
  steps. Negative regulators subject to loss-of-function mutations are in red, and
  positive regulators affected by gain-of-function mutations are in green. Either
  type of mutations lead to NF-κB constitutive activation through NIK stabilization.
  The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) blocks both classical and alternative
  NF-κB signaling, whereas the IKKβ-specific inhibitor MLN120B (MLN) only blocks the
  classical NF-κB pathway. See text for further details.
