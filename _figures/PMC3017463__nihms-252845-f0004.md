caption: 'Schematic illustartion of microglial (A) and astrocytic (B) events taking
  place in the spinal cord in neuropathic pain. A: In chronic neuropathic pain, under
  the influence of neuronal factors (such as CX3CL1, ATP or neuromediators), microglia
  undergoes changes in phenotype including an activation of p38 MAPK pathway. So-called
  activated microglia releases factors (such as cytokines) that in turn reinforce
  nociception by reducing the potency of GABAergic inhibition, sensitizing spinal
  neurons and activating astrocytes. B: An astrocytic activation also occurs (characterized
  by an activation of the intracellular JNK pathway) consequently to both neuronal
  releases of high amounts of neuromediators and microglial production of cytokines
  such as TNF-α. As a result of astrocyte reaction, a reduction of glutamate scavenging
  capacity together with an increase in GABA uptake reinforces pain signaling as well.
  Furthermore, reactive astrocyte release cytokines such as CCL2, participating in
  the loss of the GABAergic inhibition.'
