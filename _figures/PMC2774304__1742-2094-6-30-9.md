caption: Proposed model of estrogen's anti-inflammatory and pro-survival actions in
  the brain following severe burn injury. In this study, we propose that following
  severe burn injury, acute estrogen treatment increases the activity of the anti-apoptotic
  Akt signaling protein and decreases the activity of pro-apoptotic factors such as
  caspase-3. Additionally, estrogen decreases PARP cleavage and ultimately decrease
  the levels of apoptosis (Pathway 1). Following injury, estrogen increases the activity
  of ERK through a parallel pathway, and subsequently decreases the levels of inflammatory
  cytokines (Pathway 2).
