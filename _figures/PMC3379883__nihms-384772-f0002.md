caption: Leptin binding to LepRb mediates activation of the tyrosine kinase Janus
  kinase-2 (Jak2), resulting in phosphorylation of three tyrosine residues (Tyr985,
  Tyr1077, Tyr1138). Phosphorylation of Tyr985 recruits SHP-2, leading to the activation
  of the ERK pathway, and also binds to suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3),
  a negative regulator of LepRb signaling. Phosphorylation of Tyr1077 mediates signal
  transduction and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5). Phosphorylation of Tyr1138
  recruits and activates STAT3 and STAT5. Activation of STAT3 leads to increased SOCS-3
  expression which acts as a negative feedback inhibitor of leptin signaling, in part,
  by binding to Tyr985 of LepRb. In addition, hypothalamic inflammation is also induced
  during high-fat feeding and increases SOCS-3 expression. Similar to SOCS-3, protein
  tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)1B may also inhibit LepRb signaling via dephosphorylation
  of Jak2.
