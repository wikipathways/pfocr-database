caption: Schematic diagram depicting the conceivable cellular events by which MIOX
  disrupts mitochondrial integrity under HG ambience, which results in renal tubular
  cell injury. Under HG ambience, MIOX is upregulated in tubular cells, which then
  modulate mitochondrial dynamics through two conceivable pathways. (1) MIOX increases
  intracellular ROS generation through transcriptional mechanisms, which promote Drp1
  activation and mitochondrial translocation.,, (2) Upregulated MIOX reduces Pink1
  expression, which has a negative regulatory effect on Drp1 activity, such that Pink1
  inhibition would increase Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation. In this regard,
  Drp1 is activated and translocates to MOM through these possible MIOX-mediated pathways,
  where it interacts with Fis1, which would lead to mitochondrial fragmentation. Excessively
  fragmented mitochondria are depolarized and lose viability for the fusion process,
  but the surveillance of mitochondrial quality control allows these injured organelles
  to be recycled by mitophagy. However, under HG, both autophagy and mitophagy are
  suppressed, partly because of the activation of MIOX, which inhibited Pink1 and
  conceivably, prevented subsequent Parkin translocation into mitochondria, thus blocking
  the interaction between Parkin and Mfn2 on MOM that eventually resulted in a compromise
  in the process of mitophagy. As a result of insufficient autophagic removal of mitochondria,
  the accumulation of fragmented and damaged mitochondria triggered ROS overproduction
  as well as the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, by which the apoptogenic Bax translocates
  and inserts into mitochondria, whereas Cytochrome C is released into the cytosol,
  leading to apoptosis. Interestingly, pharmacologic inhibition of MIOX by d-glucarate
  restores mitochondrial quality control machinery by preventing mitochondrial damage
  and cell apoptosis, thereby attenuating hyperglycemia-induced tubular damage. Cyt.C,
  Cytochrome C.
