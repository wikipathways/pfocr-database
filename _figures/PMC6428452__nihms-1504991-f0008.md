caption: Signaling pathway for p38γ MAPK-promoted EMT. p38γ MAPK is activated by its
  upstream receptor kinases, such as ErbB2 and ErbB4 [, , ]. The activation of p38γ
  MAPK destabilizes GATA3 by ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation. Decreased
  levels of GATA3 causes the down-regulation of miR-200b, a negative regulator of
  Suz12. Suz12 is a promoter of EMT and CSC in breast cancer cells; therefore, down-regulation
  of miR-200b may promote EMT and CSC through the induction of Suz12. Alternatively,
  GATA3 may promote EMT and CSC through other miRNAs or unknown mechanisms (dotted
  lines)[–]. miR-200b could also promote EMT in breast cancer cells through mechanisms
  independent of Suz12 (dotted lines) [].
