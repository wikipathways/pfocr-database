caption: Putative microRNAs identified to regulate gene expression in the PGE2pathway.
  Arachidonic acid is liberated from phospholipids by phospholipase A2 and phospholipase
  C activity. Free arachidonic acid can then be converted into the intermediate PGH2
  by either isoform of the cyclooxygenase enzymes, COX-1, and COX-2. PGE synthases
  mPGES-1, mPGES-2, and cPGES can convert PGH2 into PGE2. PGE2 (green circles) can
  then act on the cell surface receptors EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 in both autocrine
  and paracrine pathways to facilitate cellular signaling. MicroRNA target prediction
  reveals that members of the miR-200 family, miR-143/145, miR-101, and miR-16-1/15a
  have been predicted to target multiple genes involved in the generation and action
  of PGE2. miRNAs shown in red have been predicted using microRNA. org and MicroCosm
  Targets algorithms. miRNAs shown in blue were predicted to bind the respective mRNA
  3′UTR using RNAhybrid using an MFE threshold of −20 kcal/mol. Functionally validated
  miRNAs are shown in black
