caption: The diagram represents the effects of Notch in the skeleton. CSL (Epstein-Barr
  virus latency C promoter binding factor 1, Suppressor of Hairless, and Lag1) indicates
  involvement of the canonical Notch signaling pathway. Notch suppresses chondrocyte
  proliferation and differentiation during the formation of the hyaline cartilage
  and inhibits hypertrophic differentiation. Notch inhibits osteoblast differentiation
  by interacting with β-catenin (β-Cat), Runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx-2),
  and Osterix (Osx). Notch suppresses osteoclastogenesis directly in mononuclear precursors
  and indirectly by inducing osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression and, as a consequence,
  suppresses bone remodeling. Notch signaling sustains hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal.
