caption: 'Hypergraph representation of the Boolean model for yeast glucose repression.
  A) Overall representation of the main glucose repression pathways, including the
  Snf1/Mig1 repression pathway and the Snf3/Rgt2 induction pathway. Note how the high
  degree of cross talk makes it impossible to distinguish between the two pathways.
  B) The GAL regulatory system. C) The MAL regulatory system. MALT is set to be active
  by default, since MalT is assumed to be present at a basal level. D) Subset of the
  network controlled by Sip4 and Cat8. Signaling proteins are represented with purple
  rectangles, while transcription factors are represented with red rectangles. Accordingly,
  a post-transcriptional regulatory association is represented with a purple line,
  while a transcriptional regulatory interaction is represented with a red line. Gene
  transcripts are represented with green rectangles, and sugar metabolites are depicted
  by blue ellipses. The description of the representation of logical relations between
  species is given in the legend of Figure 2. A note about the nomenclature in the
  hypergraph representation: genes are denoted in uppercase (e.g., MIG1), while protein
  names include the suffix ''p'' (e.g., Mig1p). In the main text, proteins are named
  similarly, but without the suffix (e.g., Mig1), and genes are in italic uppercase
  (e.g., MIG1)'
