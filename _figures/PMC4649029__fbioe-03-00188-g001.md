caption: 'The sucrose synthesis pathway under wild type and PGM mutant. The triose
  phosphate is imported from the chloroplast to synthesize sucrose in the cytosol.
  The total amount of triose phosphate in the chloroplast is a constant value. In
  the wide type, most triose phosphate is used to form the starch; in PGM mutant,
  the starch synthesis pathway is cut off, which results in a much higher triose phosphate
  flux into the cytosol; at the same time, the activity of invertase is increased.
  Both increases are shown in wider arrows in gray. The v1, v2, etc., are the reaction
  rates with simple mass action kinetics. Abbreviation: Pext, “external” phosphate
  in the chloroplast; TPext, “external” triose phosphate in the chloroplast; P, phosphate;
  TP, triose phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; UDP,
  uridine diphosphoglucose – glucose; SP, sucrose phosphate; SUC, sucrose; GLC, glucose;
  FRC, fructose.'
