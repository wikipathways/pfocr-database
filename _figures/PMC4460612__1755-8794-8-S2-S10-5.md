caption: Comparison of the number of the gene marker candidates between non-filtered
  and full-filtered method in Cell cycle pathway. (A) Cell cycle pathway mapped with
  non-filtered candidates. With no filtering method, too many genes are shown in the
  pathway which makes it difficult to find an appropriate gene marker. (B) Cell cycle
  pathway mapped with candidates filtered by DEG. Number of genes are greatly reduced
  than non-filtered method. However, difficulty exists in finding significant gene
  markers as the number of genes is still too great. (C) Cell cycle pathway mapped
  with full-filtered candidates. The number of genes was greatly reduced compared
  to non-filtered or DEG-only filtered candidates while keeping the genes reported
  by Yagi et al.(2013).
