caption: 'Stages and pathways involved in staphylococcal biofilm development. (A–C)
  During the attachment stage, an initial population of staphylococcal cells adhere
  onto a surface via (A) surface proteins, (B) teichoic acids and/or (C) eDNA released
  from cells, the latter due to cell lysis mediated by peptidoglycan hydrolases like
  AtlA/E and Sle1.(D–E) The maturation stage is mediated by intercellular adhesion,
  which allows the formation of multiple cell layers and the increase of the biofilm
  cell population. Intercellular adhesion is made via (D) a polysaccharide-dependent
  or (E) polysaccharide-independent pathway. The former involves homophilic or heterophilic
  protein-protein interactions by surface proteins (i) or amyloid fibers (ii). Certain
  surface proteins are processed by proteases to remove part of it, allowing the protein
  to polymerise into a fiber to reach a neighboring cell. The polysaccharide-dependent
  pathway is mediated by the icaADBC locus, which is responsible for the synthesis
  of β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminoglycan (PIA/PNAG - grey hexagons). Then, PNAG chains
  are translocated to the outside of the cells, probably by IcaC, and deacetylated
  (red hexagons) by IcaB. (F,G) During the dispersion stage, cells are released from
  the biofilm. It has been suggested that the nuclease Nuc (F) participates in the
  degradation of eDNA during this stage. In addition, the accessory gene regulatory
  (agr) system (G) also plays a role during dispersion (please see the main text for
  details). (H,I) Examples of how the expression of selected genes affects S. aureus
