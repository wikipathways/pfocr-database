caption: Accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles made up of tau (red) and amyloid
  plaques composed of amyloid-β (blue) coincides in the neocortical areas in the brain
  of Alzheimer’s disease subjects supporting amyloid-β dependent tau propagation across
  neocortical regions. Inter-neuronal spreading of tau (bottom) is enhanced in AD
  brains with both plaques and tangle build-up. Adapted with permission from ref.
