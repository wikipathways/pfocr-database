caption: The Hypothesized Role of NF-kappaB Pathway in the Regulation of the Immune
  Checkpoint Pathway. The downstream signal of receptor activation triggers the translocation
  of NF-kappaB into the nucleus, which then binds to the promoter region of the PD-L1
  gene (). In addition, the changes in the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment
  such as hypoxia and cell stress with surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
  TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma can also drive the NF-kappaB pathway to induce the expression
  of PD-L1 in cancer cells or TILs. While there is an association of HER2 expression
  with PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, the exact mechanisms that link the two together remain
  to be elucidated. However, it is likely that PD-L1 expression indicates epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) in cancers to protect mesenchymal cells and stem cells from immune
  attack. This hypothesized crosslink activity between HER and PD-L1 forms the basis
  of development of BsAb targeting both HER2 and PD-L1.
