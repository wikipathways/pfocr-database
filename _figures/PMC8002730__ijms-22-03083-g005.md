caption: The common and distinctive core signaling pathways between triple negative
  breast cancer (TNBC) and non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC). This figure
  summarizes the genetic and epigenetic progression mechanism of TNBC and non-TNBC.
  The core signaling pathways with the green background are the common core signaling
  pathways of TNBC and non-TNBC. The blue line indicates distinctive core signaling
  pathway of non-TNBC; the red line indicates distinctive core signaling pathway of
  TNBC; the black line indicates common core signaling pathway of TNBC and non-TNBC;
  the black arrow head of solid line means activation of cellular function; the black
  circle head of solid line means inhibition of cellular function; the red node indicates
  high expression of protein, receptor, TF, miRNA, and target gene; and the blue node
  indicates low expression of protein, receptor, TF, miRNA, and target gene.

    The core signaling pathways with the green background are the common core signaling
    pathways of TNBC and non-TNBC. The blue line indicates distinctive core signaling
    pathway of non-TNBC; the red line indicates distinctive core signaling pathway
    of TNBC; the black line indicates common core signaling pathway of TNBC and non-TNBC;
    the black arrow head of solid line means activation of cellular function; the
    black circle head of solid line means inhibition of cellular function; the red
    node indicates high expression of protein, receptor, TF, miRNA, and target gene;
    and the blue node indicates low expression of protein, receptor, TF, miRNA, and
