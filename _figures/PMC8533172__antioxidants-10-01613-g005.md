caption: Proposed pathway for the formation of GABA and hypoxanthine. (A) Conversion
  of L-glutamate into γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) by decarboxylation process. Obtained
  from []. (B) The pathway of intracellular ATP catabolism involved in the synthesis
  of hypoxanthine []. The numbers (1–7) represent various enzyme-catalyzed stages.
  The ATP is interconverted into ADP and then into AMP which is deaminated into IMP
  followed by dephosphorylation to produce inosine (Ino). Ino is converted into hypoxanthine.
  Alternatively, AMP may be dephosphorylated to adenosine (Ado) and then deaminated
  into inosine which forms hypoxanthine (hypo). IMP, Inosine 5’-monophosphate; GMP,
  Guanosine monophosphate; ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; ATP, Adenosine triphosphate.
