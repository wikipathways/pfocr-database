caption: Hippo signaling pathways during zebrafish cardiac development. (A) Cell junctional
  complexes (including Cadherin-5, Pecam-1, and Vegfr3/Flt4), stretch-induced ion
  channels Piezo1/2, or primary cilia act as mechanosensors within the endocardium
  (blue). Increased junctional forces within the endocardium are sensed by Cadherin-5,
  which triggers the nuclear localization of Yap1/Wwtr1 and causes endocardial cell
  proliferation. A compact wall architecture is organized within the myocardium (red).
  Tension heterogeneity upon myocardial proliferation induces actomyosin enrichment
  at their apical sides and causes the nuclear localization of Yap1. This triggers
  delamination of myocardial cells that seed the trabeculation layer. Neighboring
  myocardial cells activate Notch signaling, which inhibits actomyosin network contractility.
  Erbb2-mediated nuclear export of Wwtr1 causes myocardial cell lamination into the
  trabecular layer. (B) Within the outflow tract (OFT) valve, Piezo1 regulates Yap1
  nuclear localization within the endothelial (yellow) and smooth muscle cell layers
  (green). Within the endothelial layer, Piezo1 modulates expression of the mechanosensitive
  transcription factor klf2a. (C) During epicardial formation, Ift88 interacts with
  Yap1 within the cytoplasm and forms a complex with Amolt1 to regulate Yap1 activity.
  Within the nucleus a Yap1-Tead complex activates expression of bmp4, which restricts
  the growth of proepicardium (purple) and myocardium (red). (D) Biomechanical forces
  involve hemodynamics, biomechanical coupling, and tension heterogeneity acting within
  different tissue layers. These mechanical stimuli activate mechanosensitive Hippo
  pathway signaling.
