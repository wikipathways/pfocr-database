caption: 'A model for bladder cancer development and progression. Two pathways are
  defined according to distinctive bladder cancer subphenotypes: The first pathway
  is composed of low-grade non–muscle-invasive (Ta G1/Ta G2)—genomic stable—tumours;
  the second is composed of both high-grade non–muscle-invasive (Ta G3/T1 G2/G3) and
  muscle-invasive (tumour stage [T] ≥2)—genomic unstable—tumours. Mutations in FGFR3
  and PIK3CA have been shown to be associated with the first pathway, whereas alterations
  in the p53 and RB functional networks have been shown to be important for the second
  pathway. α, β1, and β2 refer to the genetic variants associated with low-grade non–muscle-invasive,
  high-grade non–muscle-invasive, and muscle-invasive tumours, respectively.G = histologic
  grade.'
