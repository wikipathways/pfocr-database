caption: 'Mechanism of heavy metal detoxification via phytochelatin (PC) and antioxidants.
  (A) Schematic diagram of the PC pathway. Ionized forms of heavy metals are in bold
  circles marked as ‘MET-ion’. PCs molecules are in bold circles marked as ‘PCs’.
  A double-lined arrow indicates import direction. A bold arrow indicates the PCs
  synthesis process. Enzymes are written in an italicized bold font. (B) Schematic
  diagram of heavy metal-induced antioxidant processes. ROS generation by heavy metal
  exposure activates Nrf2, which is a transcription factor for antioxidant response
  elements (AREs). Phytochemicals contribute to antioxidative process via stimulation
  of the Nrf2 pathway. Various antioxidants are activated and remove ROS. GSH, glutathione;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; NQO1, NAD(P)H: quinone
  acceptor oxidoreductase 1; HO-1, heme oxygenase 1.'
