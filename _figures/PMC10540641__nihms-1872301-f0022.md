  (b) TRAIL release (IV) triggered by enzymes in tumor microenvironment, followed
  by active targeting and cell internalization; endosomal escape (V) after enzymatic
  degradation of the HA shell and redox-mediated release of siHSP70 (VI) in intracellular
  space; RNAi (VII) and gene downregulation (VIII) resulting in apoptosis; enhanced
  TRAIL-induced cancer cell apoptosis (IX) and enhanced apoptosis induced by synergy
