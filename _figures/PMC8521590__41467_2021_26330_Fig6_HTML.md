caption: Correlation of morphinan production with copy number and expression of morphinan
  biosynthesis genes in three Papaver species. Copy numbers of morphinan biosynthesis
  pathway genes were shown in a line plot on left. Production levels of thebaine,
  codeine, and morphine were shown in bubble plots, and the detail numbers were shown
  in Supplementary Fig. . The total expression of all gene copies in the stem was
  shown in a line plot on right. N_exp normalized expression. Source data are provided
  as a Source Data file.
