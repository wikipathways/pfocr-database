caption: Inflammation promotes an aggressive phenotype of ER-positive tumors. Pregnancy,
  particularly mammary gland involution, and obesity are known breast cancer risk
  factors that can promote an inflammatory microenvironment locally within the breast.
  TAMs (M), adipocytes (A), and fibroblasts (F) within the tumor microenvironment
  produce both estrogens and cytokines that can activate ER and the NF-κB pathway,
  respectively, in breast cancer cells. ER and NF-κB can repress or enhance each other's
  activity at particular genes to promote an aggressive phenotype of ER-positive breast
  cancer with endocrine therapy resistance, chemoresistance, and increased cell survival
  and proliferation.
