caption: This schematic diagram summarizes the main events which have been established
  by data in this study. H/R is a stimulus for mitochondrial dependent activation
  of apoptosis which invloves ROS production and cytochrome c release. This intrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis involves caspase-3 activation which leads to DNA fragmentation.
  Another hallmark of apoptosis is the exposure of phosphatidylserine (normally located
  only on inner membrane) to external surface of plasma membrane. Globular adiponectin,
  via binding to AdipoR1 and recruiting APPL1 leads to signaling events which enhance
  anti-oxidant potential in the cells. This is at least in part responsible for reducing
  ROS production in response to H/R and attenuation of apoptosis.
