caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism by which IGU ameliorates BLM-induced
  pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mice. IGU ameliorates BLM-induced pulmonary
  inflammation in mice by blocking the TLR4/NFκB pathway and inhibiting macrophage
  activation as well as M1 macrophage polarization, thereby reducing PF caused by
  the polarization of M2 macrophages and EMT in the advanced stage of the disease

  by regulating macrophage polarization through inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB pathway
