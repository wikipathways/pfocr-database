caption: Model for PoRal2 roles during surface signaling transduction and appressorium
  formation in P. oryzae. PoRal2 interacts with Smo1, Scd1, and Mst50 to regulate
  the activation of the Mst11-Mst7-Pmk1 MAPK pathway by Ras2, thereby controlling
  the appressorium formation and invasive growth process.
