caption: Figure 1. Interactions between microbial pathogens and IL-10-JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway elements. Recent studies (reference shown in parentheses) have shown C.
  burnetii, M. avium, S. agalactiae and other Gram-negative pathogens induce IL-10
  synthesis in contrast to protozoa such as L. major and commensal L. rhamnosus that
  inhibit its production. STAT3, normally recruited and phosphorylated at the IL-10
  receptor complex, are directly engaged by pathogens including S. enteria and T.
  gondii. Viruses such as HIV also affect STAT3 directly, or indirectly by producing
  homologs that compete with IL-10 for receptor complex docking sites, as shown for
  CMV. Nuclear translocation of active STAT3 for contact with STAT binding elements
  is a potential pathway element for pathogen-driven effects that has not yet been
  described. SOCS1 and SOCS3, induced as a result of IL-10 signaling through MAPK
  and AKT/PKB, suppress LPS/TLR4/CD14-induced IL-10, IL-6 biological activity from
  gp130 receptors, MHC class II, and STAT1-induced mediators including NO, TNF-α and
  IFN-γ. Microbes such as L. major hijack this element within the pathway to abrogate
  suppressive effects of SOCS toward active STAT3 as a mechanism of interfering with
  antimicrobial responses in macrophages.
