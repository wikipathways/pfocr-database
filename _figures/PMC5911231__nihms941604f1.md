caption: Expression of glycolytic-pathway genes depends on the co-activator function
  of CDK8-Mediator, which transmits transcription-stimulatory signals from hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1A (HIF1A), bound at its response element (RE), to the promoter-bound, Pol
  II-containing pre-initiation complex (PIC). This pathway of transcriptional activation
  is normally triggered by hypoxia but becomes constitutively active in cancer cells,
  potentially sensitizing them to small-molecule inhibition of CDK8, the only known
  enzymatic function within the CDK8-Mediator complex.
