caption: The oxygen sensing pathway of HIF1α. HIF is the master regulator of the cellular
  hypoxic response. Under normoxic conditions, HIF1α is hydroxylated in an oxygen
  dependent manner and tagged for degradation by VHL complexes. In low oxygen environments,
  HIF1α is stabilized due to the lack of oxygen, translocate to the nucleus and forms
  a heterodimer with HIF1β and other cofactors to activate transcription of hypoxia
  inducible genes. Viruses that are able to stabilize HIF1a under atmospheric conditions
  by inhibiting PHD or VHL interactions are shown in the top panel
