caption: '(A                                             and B) Outline of pro- and
  anti-aging processes that are controlled                                             by
  the TOR and/or cAMP/PKA signaling pathways and are modulated by LCA in                                             yeast
  cells grown under non-CR (A) or CR (B) conditions.                                             Activation
  arrows and inhibition bars denote pro-aging (displayed in green                                             color)
  or anti-aging (displayed in red color) processes. Under both non-CR                                             and
  CR conditions, LCA targets housekeeping longevity assurance processes                                             listed
  in (C). Under non-CR conditions only, LCA also targets the                                             adaptable
  cAMP/PKA pathway. By activating PKA-dependent phosphorylation of                                             the
  cytosolic pool of the key nutrient-sensory protein kinase Rim15p, LCA                                             causes
  the inactivation of Rim15p. The resulting reduction of the                                             phosphorylation
  status of several Rim15p target proteins in the cytosol                                             lowers
  their pro-aging efficacy. Abbreviations: CR, caloric restriction;                                             PM,
