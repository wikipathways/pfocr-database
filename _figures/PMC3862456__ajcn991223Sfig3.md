caption: Neutral AA transporters and activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. This
  diagram shows the relation between neutral AA transport, intracellular AA concentration,
  and the mTORC1 growth signaling pathway in nonepithelial mammalian cells (see text
  for further details). A sequential relation between primary, secondary, and tertiary
  active transport systems (denoted as “I,” “II,” and “III,” respectively) contributes
  substantially to transport of LNAAs across cell membranes. Energy input is provided
  through ATP hydrolysis by the Na+/K+ pump (primary active transport). Note the operation
  of symport (cotransport) and antiport (exchange) mechanisms for AAs in series downstream
  of the Na+/ K+ pump. In epithelial cells, broad-scope neutral AA transporters provide
  both SNAAs and LNAAs coupled to ion fluxes by secondary active transport, lessening
  the requirement for step III. AA (principally LNAA) concentration and/or flux within
  intracellular compartments promotes recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomes where it
  is activated by interactions with Rag and Rheb GTPases. Such activation of mTORC1,
  downstream of nutrient (AA) and growth factor (insulin) signals, stimulates protein
  synthesis and ribosome biogenesis by effector mechanisms as indicated. Both cytosolic
  and lysosomal AA sensors have been reported (see sections in text entitled “Plasma
  membrane AA transporters and cytosolic AA sensing upstream of mTORC1” and “AA transporters
  and lysosomal AA sensing upstream of mTORC1”). Remarkably little is known about
  the transporter or transporters mediating neutral AA uptake into lysosomes, although

  description: Neutral AA transporters and activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway.
    This diagram shows the relation between neutral AA transport, intracellular AA

    contributes substantially to transport of LNAAs across cell membranes. Energy
    input is provided through ATP hydrolysis by the Na+/K+ pump (primary active transport).

    for AAs in series downstream of the Na+/ K+ pump. In epithelial cells, broad-scope
    neutral AA transporters provide both SNAAs and LNAAs coupled to ion fluxes by
