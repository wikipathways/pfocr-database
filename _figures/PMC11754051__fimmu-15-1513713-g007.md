caption: Phosphorylated CASK enters nucleus and forms a complex to facilitate CRM1-mediated
  Ifna mRNP export during H5N1 infection When the H5N1 virus infects macrophages,
  PKR senses the 5’ tri-phosphate group of the viral genomic RNA, activating a signaling
  pathway that induces the expression of IFN-α. PKR activity is crucial for the transcriptional
  activation of Ifna, as treatment with a PKR inhibitor suppresses both CASK and IFN-α
  expression. During H5N1 infection, the expression and activity of HCK are upregulated,
  positively correlating with CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of CASK at S395. The S395-phosphorylated
  CASK translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with STIP1, CCT4, and
  TNK1, as confirmed by IP-LC-MS/MS analysis. This CASK complex is recruited to the
  Ifna promoters through CCT4’s interaction with IRF7. Additionally, the complex associates
  with nascent Ifna mRNA via secondary interactions with HNRNPs and facilitates CRM1
  recruitment to the transcript, enabling CRM1-mediated nuclear export. This Ifna
  mRNA-coupled CASK complex may counteract the competitive binding of influenza vRNP
  to CRM1, thereby supporting efficient nuclear export of Ifna mRNA
