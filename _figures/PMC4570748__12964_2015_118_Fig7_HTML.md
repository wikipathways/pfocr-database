caption: Redox control of the cellular energy metabolism. In cancer cells the shift
  of the metabolism into anaerobic glycolysis is mainly mediated by the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  AKT activates mTOR, which subsequently activates HIF1α resulting in an induction
  of GLUT1, enzymes of the glycolysis and the mitochondrial PDK, which inhibits the
  pyruvate flux into the TCA. The AMPK is able to block this mechanism by inhibition
  of mTOR to conserve energy. Cancer cells exhibit high ROS (H2O2) levels leading
  to an inhibition of the AMPK and of PTPs, which can inactivate AKT. Even through
  high H2O2 levels DSBs could occur leading to the activation of ATM accompanied with
  cell cycle arrest. The interaction of ATM and AMPK might enhance the DNA damage
  response. In addition H2O2 might inactivate the PKM2 leading to an altered flux
  of glucose in the pentose phosphate pathway for the generation of reductions equivalents
  to detoxify ROS. PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid.
