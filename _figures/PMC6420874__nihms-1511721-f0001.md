caption: Cancer-specific peptides released from damaged cancer cells facilitate antigen
  uptake and presentation by dendritic cells. Radiation also decreases an anti-phagocytosis
  signal (CD47) and increases a pro-phagocytosis signal (calreticulin) to enhance
  calreticulin-LRP/CD91-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages, thereby increasing antigen
  presentation and priming of T cells. Upregulation of MHC-I expression on tumor cells
  after irradiation increases recognition of cancer cells by T cells. After radiation,
  damaged DNA is released from nucleus to cytosol, which triggers the cGAS-STING pathway
  to activate interferon gene transcription. Several proteins (such as TGF-β and HMGB1)
  secreted by cancer cells also modulate the immune microenvironment.
