caption: Suppression of BCR signaling is detrimental to growth and sensitizes B-ALL
  to dex. The effects of gene knockdown on growth (A) and dex sensitivity (B) are
  overlaid on components of the BCR pathway. Genes are present when included in the
  screen, and shaded when the effect of knockdown is significant (Mann-Whitney, P
  ≤ .05). Dashed lines indicate repression of PIK3CD and IL7R expression by dex (diagrams
  based on Ingenuity pathways, and other literature,).
