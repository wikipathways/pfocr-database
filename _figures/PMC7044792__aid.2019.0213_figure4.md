caption: HIV-1 and necroptosis. Necroptosis pathway is started by interaction between
  TNF/TNFR1, leading to RIPK3 activation by RIPK1. Active RIPK-3 catalyzes the phosphorylation
  of MLKL, resulting in MLKL oligomers, which insert themselves in the plasma membrane,
  forming an ion channel and triggering plasma membrane permeabilization. The ionic
  dysregulation promotes the formation of the inflammasome, which leads to activation
  of caspase-1 and consequent secretion of mature IL-β1, IL-18, and DAMPs. The final
  products are inflammatory response and necrotic cell morphology with cell swelling,
  diffuse fragmentation, and membrane integrity loss. The HIV-1 Tat protein leads
  to increased TNFα production and necroptosis stimulation. MLKL, mixed-lineage kinase
  domain-like pseudokinase; IL, interleukin; DAMP, damage-associated molecular pattern;
  Tat, transactivator of transcription.
