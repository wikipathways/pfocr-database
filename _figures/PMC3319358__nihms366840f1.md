caption: Dietary TAG are solubilized in bile salt micelles and lipolysed in the intestinal
  lumen to free fatty acid and monoacylglycerol (MAG) that are taken up by enterocytes
  involving diffusion and protein meditated uptake, transported to the ER by carrier
  proteins and used for the synthesis of TAG by MAG pathway (red line, red). In this
  pathway, MAG and free fatty acids are first converted to DAG by monoacylglycerol:acylCoA
  acyltransferase (MGAT) enzymes. DAG is then converted to TAG by diacylglyerol:acylcoA
  acyltarnsfrease 1 and 2 (DGAT1 and DGAT2). TAG are also synthesized from glucose
  by the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway. In this pathway, GPAT3/GPAT4 catalyze the esterification
  of glycerol-3-phosphate to form lysophosphatidic acid. 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate
  acyltransferases (AGPAT1-5; also called LPAAT) esterify lysophosphatidic acid to
  form phosphatidate. Three isoforms of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAPase,
  also known as lipins 1–3), hydrolyze the phosphate to form diacylglycerol (DAG).
  DAG is then converted to TAG by DGATs as in the MAG pathway.
