caption: (i). PV decreases peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activity
  by competition with PPARγ for binding to PPARγ response elements (PPRE) as heterodimers
  with PPARγ or the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Repressed transcriptional activity
  of PPARγ leads to increase cancer cell proliferation and decrease apoptosis in thyroids
  of ThrbPV/PV mice. (ii) PV activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling
  pathway by physical interaction with the regulatory subunit of PI3K (p85α). Over-activation
  of PI3K-Akt signaling increases proliferation and migration of cancer cells and
  decreases apoptosis via the downstream pathways as shown. (iii) PV activates integrin-Src-focal
  adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling cascade. PV interacts with integrin and activates
  phosphorylation of Src and FAK. Activated Src-FAK signaling pathway induces epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) and activation of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) to increase cell
  migration, invasion and distant metastasis. Activated Src also potentiates mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to increase cell proliferation and EMT. (iv) PV
  inhibits proteasomal degradation of the pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG)
  and β-catenin. PV binds to PTTG and prevents its degradation by proteasome, resulting
  in accumulation of PTTG. Elevated PTTG impedes mitotic progression, leading to chromosomal
  aberrations. Elevated PTTG, via transcription activation of its target genes, increases
  cell proliferation and augments angiogenesis. PV also increases the stability of
  β-catenin via direct protein-protein interaction, thereby inhibiting protesomal
  degradation of β-catenin. Elevated β-catenin protein levels increase transcription
  activation of its downstream target genes that affect cell proliferation and migration.
