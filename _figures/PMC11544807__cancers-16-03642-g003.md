caption: 'Mechanism of action of FDA-approved tumor-agnostic therapy. This figure
  summarizes the basic mechanism of action regarding the FDA-approved tumor-agnostic
  therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitor—PD-1 inhibitors: PD-1 is a receptor expressed
  on T cells, and its ligand, PD-L1, is expressed on cancer cells. When PD-1 binds
  to PD-L1, it suppresses the activity of cytotoxic T cells, allowing tumor cells
  to evade immune detection and proliferate unchecked. PD-1 inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab
  and dostarlimab, block this interaction, restoring T-cell activity and enhancing
  the immune system’s ability to detect and destroy cancer cells. Antibody-drug conjugate
  (ADC): Trastuzumab deruxtecan consists of a monoclonal antibody, a cytotoxic payload,
  and a linker. Upon binding to the HER2 receptor on the cancer cell surface, the
  ADC is internalized through endocytosis. Inside the cell, the endosome fuses with
  a lysosome, where the complex is degraded, releasing the cytotoxic drug. This payload
  damages the tumor’s DNA, effectively inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing
  cancer cell death. BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination: Dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor)
  combined with trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) targets the MAPK signaling pathway, a
  critical cascade of phosphorylation events involving RAS, BRAF, MEK, and ERK proteins.
  This pathway regulates cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. In cancers
  with BRAF V600E mutations, abnormal activation of this pathway leads to uncontrolled
  tumor cell growth. By blocking the mutant BRAF protein and inhibiting MEK downstream,
  this combination therapy effectively disrupts hyperproliferation and prevents paradoxical
  activation of the MAPK pathway. NTRK fusion inhibitors and RET fusion inhibitors:
  Gene fusions involving the NTRK and RET genes lead to the production of constitutively
  active receptor tyrosine kinases, which continuously signal even in the absence
  of normal regulatory inputs. These aberrantly activated receptors stimulate key
  proliferative and survival pathways, including the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, driving
  oncogenic signaling that promotes tumor growth, survival, and metastasis. Targeted
  therapies, such as NTRK inhibitors (e.g., larotrectinib and entrectinib) and RET
  inhibitors (e.g., selpercatinib and pralsetinib), block these fusion-driven tyrosine
  kinases, effectively halting tumor progression by disrupting these essential growth
  signals. Created by BioRender. Thein, K. (2024) BioRender.com/i35k906 (accessed
