caption: ROCK inhibitors such as DJ4 may reduce the phosphorylation of downstream
  targets such as MLC2 and MYPT1. Blocking ROCK-related pathways can potentially have
  therapeutic benefits by restoring proliferation and apoptotic cascades that may
  be improperly signaling due to malignant transformations arising from cancer.
