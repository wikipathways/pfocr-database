caption: Model of mechanisms underlying FOXO1 regulation of lung-specific NKX2.1-activated
  genes via PI-3K/AKT-dependent phosphorylation. In AT2 and AT2-like cells in the
  presence of KGF, the PI-3K/AKT pathway is activated, leading to downstream phosphorylation
  of FOXO1 and subsequent cytoplasmic extrusion and degradation. The absence of nuclear
  FOXO1 allows active NKX2.1 to remain at the SFTPC and SFTPB promoters, increasing
  the expression of these AT2 cell-specific target genes. During the transition from
  AT2 to AT1-like cells (AT1.5 intermediate cells), or in the absence of KGF, the
  PI-3K/AKT pathway becomes inactivated. This in turn prevents the phosphorylation
  of FOXO1, allowing it to remain in the nucleus and interact with and pull NKX2.1
  from its target promoters. This process is completed in differentiated AT1-like
  cells, where NKX2.1 removal from target genes by FOXO1 leads to the inhibition of
  gene expression. The figure was created with BioRender (BioRender Academic License
