caption: 'Mechanisms of copper-induced cell death. a Copper induces apoptosis primarily
  through the induction of ROS, DNA damage, and proteasome inhibition. Additionally,
  Copper induces TP53-dependent apoptosis by activating the transcription of TP53
  target genes, while also triggering TP53-independent apoptosis through the inhibition
  of ribosomal synthesis and the induction of nucleolar stress. b Copper promotes
  pyroptosis by inducing ROS production and ER stress, resulting in NLRP3 inflammasome
  formation and membrane pore creation via GSDMD activation. c Copper toxicity activates
  the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway through oxidative stress, resulting in the phosphorylation
  and oligomerization of RIPK3 and MLKL, thereby triggering necroptosis. d Copper
  induces intracellular ROS through Fenton-like reactions and mitochondrial damage,
  leading to lipid peroxidation. It also binds to and induces the oligomerization
  of GPX4, promoting its autophagic degradation via the receptor TAXIBP1. e Copper
  initiates autophagy by activating AMPK, inhibiting mTOR, or directly binding to
  ULK1/2 kinases. Copper-mediated upregulation of autophagic genes and activation
  of the transcription factor TFEB contribute to the formation of autophagosomes and
  autolysosomes, which further promoting autophagy-dependent cell death. Created by
