caption: 'Genomics-based metabolic model of dissimilatory phosphite oxidation coupled
  to CO2 reduction in Ca. Phosphitivorax anaerolimi Phox-21. Dotted lines denote putative
  mechanisms based on physiological and genomic observations that have yet to be confirmed
  by direct biochemical evidence. Dissimilatory phosphite oxidation proteins: PtdC,
  phosphite transporter; PtdF, nucleoside-diphosphate-sugar epimerase; PtdH, radical
  SAM superfamily enzyme; PtdI, hypothetical protein; PtxD, phosphite dehydrogenase.
  Ion motive force and reducing equivalents proteins: ATPase, ATP synthase complex;
  NfnAB, NAD-dependent ferredoxin:NADP oxidoreductase; Rnf, sodium-translocating ferredoxin:NAD
  oxidoreductase complex. Inorganic carbon assimilation (reductive glycine pathway)
  proteins: FdhAB, NADP-dependent formate dehydrogenase; Fhs, formate:THF ligase;
  FolD, methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase/methylene-THF dehydrogenase; GCV, glycine cleavage
  system (GcvH, lipoate-binding protein; GcvP, glycine dehydrogenase; GcvT, aminomethyltransferase;
  Lpd, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase); GlyA, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; SdaA,
  serine deaminase.'
