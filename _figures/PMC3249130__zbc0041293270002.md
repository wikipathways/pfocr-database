caption: Metabolic network topology showing the distribution of fluxes in the central
  metabolism of M. extorquens AM1 during growth on acetate. Net fluxes obtained from
  13C labeling experiments are given in mmol·g−1 [CDW]·h−1, including standard deviation;
  exchange fluxes are given in parentheses. The arrows represent direction of fluxes;
  biomass exit fluxes are labeled in red. The dotted lines indicate an unidentifiable
  flux. OAA, oxaloacetate; 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; 2/3-PG, 2/3-phosphoglycerate; DHAP,
  dihydroxyacetone-phosphate; GAP, glycerinaldehyd-3-phosphate; C2-E/C3-E, C2/C3 fragments
  bound to holoenzyme.
