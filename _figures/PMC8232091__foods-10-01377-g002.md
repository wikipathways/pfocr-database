caption: Scheme of the primary and secondary metabolic pathway and relative metabolite
  contents of traditional and industrial doenjang. The metabolic pathway was adopted
  from the KEGG database. The Y-axis of the graph represents peak areas of respective
  metabolites. Color of metabolite names represents comparatively abundant metabolites
  in traditional (red) and industrial (blue) doenjang.
