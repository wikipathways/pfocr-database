caption: FAM3A is a novel target for treating diabetes and NAFLD. FAM3A is a new mitochondrial
  protein that enhances ATP production and release in pancreatic β cells and hepatocytes.
  In physiological condition, FAM3A-ATP-P2R signaling pathway plays important roles
  in controlling PDX-1 and insulin expressions in pancreatic β cells, and suppressing
  gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis independent of insulin in liver. Under diabetic
  condition, inhibition of FAM3A-ATP-P2R signaling pathway causes pancreatic β dysfunctions,
  and increases hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. Clearly, activating FAM3A-ATP-P2R
  signaling pathway represents a novel strategy for treating T2DM and NAFLD. Akt,
  protein kinase B; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; FFAs, free fatty acids; NAFLD, non-alcoholic
  fatty liver disease. P2R, purinergic P2 receptors (ATP, ADP and UTP as ligands);
  PDX-1, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1.
