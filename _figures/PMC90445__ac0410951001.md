caption: Biosynthesis of ergosterol as characterized in yeast. The pathway shows the
  major intermediates (bold characters) and enzymes by their yeast designations (ERG1,
  squalene epoxidase; ERG7, oxidosqualene cyclase; ERG11, C14-demethylase). Drug classes
  that act on selected sites in the pathway are shown in italics.
