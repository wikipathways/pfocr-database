caption: In the tumor microenvironment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, endothelial cells
  exhibit activation of both NF-κB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways in response to
  "tumor cell-derived signals". This activation triggers phosphorylation and nuclear
  translocation of P65 and STAT3 in endothelial cells, resulting in the upregulation
  of PD-L1 expression. The interaction between upregulated PD-L1 and PD-1 on circulating
  T cells within the vasculature initiates immunosuppressive signaling, consequently
  impairing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This cascade of events ultimately facilitates
  immune evasion and tumor progression
