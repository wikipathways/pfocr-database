caption: 'Changes in NO signaling cascade with aging and the loss of estrogens. 1,
  NO is synthesized in the endothelium by eNOS using l-arginine as a substrate, where
  it then diffuses into the VSM. 2, Within the VSM, NO binds to sGC, which consists
  of two subunits, α and β. sGC catalyzes the conversion GTP to cyclic GMP. Cyclic
  GMP has multiple effects, which include: activation of phosphodiesterases (PDE),
  activation of cyclic GMP dependant ion channels. 3, Activation of cyclic GMP dependant
  protein kinase G (PKG). VASP is then phosphorylated at serine 239 by PKG. VASP is
  an established biochemical endpoint in the NO/cyclic GMP pathway in VSM, and is
  an index of defects in NO signaling and/or endothelial dysfunction. Aging combined
  with ovariectomy depressed sGC α1 and β1 expression, resulting in decreased phosphorylation
  of VASP, and consequently decreased relaxation in response to NO. E2 replacement
  blocked these changes. NC, No change; P, phosphorylation; PDE5, phosphodiesterose-5.'
