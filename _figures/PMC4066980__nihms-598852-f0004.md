caption: Model for Id1 regulation of melanocyte growth and melanoma development. Normal
  epidermal melanocytes reside at the basement membrane and are slowly proliferating.
  They possess a wild-type p16/INK4a gene without significant p16/INK4a expression,
  and wild-type BRAF kinase. Melanocytes within benign nevi frequently possess mutant
  BRAF kinase which promotes cellular growth; however, cellular growth arrest (senescence)
  is achieved through an intact p16/INK4a gene and upregulated expression in nevomelanocytes
  with associated cell cycle inhibition. Dysplastic nevi possess partial loss of p16/INK4a
  expression/function (genetic or epigenetic loss through mutational changes in the
  gene encoding p16/INK4a or methylation of the p16 promoter) in conjunction with
  BRAF mutations leading to a proliferative lesion with eventual growth arrest induced
  by either residual functional p16/INK4a or p53 and associated effectors. Radial
  growth phase (RGP) melanomas possess mutant BRAF and associated proliferative changes
  in conjunction more extensive loss of p16/INK4a expression via genetic/epigenetic
  changes and additional reversible loss through promoter repression by Id1. Additional
  cell cycling achieved through loss of p16/INK4a function promotes further genetic
  changes and results in radial growth lesions (p53 pathway is likely to be involved
  here despite wildtype p53 expression in these tumors). Since Id1 regulation of p16/INK4a
  is transcriptional and not associated with distinctive genetic events, this stage
  may be functionally reversible through targeted disruption of Id1 function. Vertical
  growth phase tumors possess even more extensive loss of functional p16/INK4a through
  genetic/epigenetic silencing. Id1 expression is lost since p16/INK4a silencing is
  now propogated via genetic/epigenetic changes and Id1 functions would therefore
  be redundant. BRAF activity remains high in these tumors and proliferation induced
  by active BRAF kinase promotes additional genetic changes that promote tumor invasion
  into the dermis. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available
