caption: The pathway of “aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling”-initiated smoking-related
  cancer. Arrows show event flow. –m represents hypomethylation, and +m represents
  hypermethylation. The plot was generated using Microsoft PowerPoint. Under normal
  circumstances, toxic substances from cigarette smoke, including PAHs, nitrosamines,
  and aromatic amines, could enter the bloodstream through the alveolar capillary
  system and be taken up by pulmonary cells. Toxic chemicals such as the PAHs bind
  to transcription factor AhR, which results from the dissociation of AhR and an associated
  chaperone protein (Chap) complex. After translocating to the nucleus, PAHs and AhR
  dissociate, and AhR is dimerized with ARNT, which is produced from the AhRR–ARNT
  complex. The resulting complex binds to the XRE in the promoter of CYP1A1 to enhance
  the expression of CYP1A1. The CYP1A1 then metabolizes PAHs into hydrophilic intermediates
  such as B[a]-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), which can be detoxified through
  the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family of enzymes or, in an alternative manner,
  form DNA adducts. Under abnormal circumstances, CYP1A1 is -m or AhRR has altered
  methylation (−m or +m) that may extraordinarily enhance the expression of CYP1A1,
  which could induce more DNA adduct formation that results in miscoding of the DNA
  sequence. Under long-term smoking exposure, the DNA sequence suffers persistent
  miscoding that triggers epigenetic changes in many critical cancer genes, such as
  NOTCH1, ATK3, DUSP4, SMAD6, and SMARCA4.
