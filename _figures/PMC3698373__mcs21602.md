caption: Schematic illustration of the hormonal pathways activated by SLs in response
  to different Pi growth conditions. Under sufficient Pi, the SL pathway, via MAX2,
  is suggested to act mainly through the ethylene pathway (). This response is suggested
  to be mediated by ethylene-insensitive (EIN) and ethylene-resistant (ETR) proteins
  (; ). Auxin synthesis, transport (including PIN Formed protein (PIN) expression)
  and signalling are positively affected by ethylene signalling (, and references
  therein). In addition, SLs have been suggested to dampen auxin transport (). Hence,
  the auxin pathway may be activated either by the ethylene pathway or directly by
  SLs, to regulate root development for sufficient-Pi growth conditions. However,
  under conditions of Pi depletion, during the first few hours of seedling development,
  the SL pathway, through MAX2, is suggested to activate mainly the TIR1-dependent
  auxin signalling pathway (), thereby regulating root development to suit those growth
  conditions.
