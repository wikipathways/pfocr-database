caption: 'The intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of ceramide-assisted apoptosis is largely
  regulated by caspases and Bcl-2 family members. Crosstalk between signaling members
  is designated by arrows. Loss of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP)
  subsequently leads to the release of proapoptotic proteins: cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing
  factor (AIF), and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC)–direct
  inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP)-binding protein with low PI (DIABLO). GSK3β,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3β; HRK, harakiri; JNK, JUN N-terminal kinase; PKC, protein
  kinase C; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; TXNIP, thioredoxin interacting protein.'
