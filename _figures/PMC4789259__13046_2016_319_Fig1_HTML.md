caption: Schematic representation of canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway. The miRNA
  biogenesis is a multistep process. miRNA genes are transcribed by polymerase II
  or III resulting in primary precursors (pri-miRNAs). Second, pri-miRNAs are cleaved
  into pre-miRNA by the Microprocessor complex (Drosha-DGCR8) in the nucleus and then
  transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5-Ran-GTP. Drosha/DGCR8
  is subjected to complex regulation by positive and negative factors, represented
  on the figure. In the cytoplasm, Dicer1, TRBP and Paz protein cleave and digest
  the pre-miRNA to produce a mature duplex miRNA. The functional strand of the mature
  miRNA is loaded together with AGO-2 proteins into the RISC. The mature miRNA silences
  target mRNAs through mRNA cleavage or translational repression
