caption: 'A simple illustration of TGF-β signalling pathways in lung (myo)fibroblasts
  leading to the increased expression of profibrotic genes in these cell types. In
  the extracellular matrix (top), IL-1β, a proinflammatory cytokine triggers the integrin
  αvβ8-mediated conversion of latent TGF-β1 protein to its active form. On the cell
  membrane, activated form of TGF-β1 homodimers (green star) bind to transmembrane
  and dimeric TGF-β receptor type II (TβRII) and leads to the recruitment of dimeric
  TGF-β receptor type I (TβRI) inducing the formation of a heterotetrameric receptor
  complex. Subsequently, this ligand binding triggers the phosphorylation and activation
  of TβRI by TβRII (small curved brown arrows). On the cytoplasmic side, the activated
  TβRI then binds and phosphorylates SMAD2 and SMAD3, also known as receptor regulated
  SMADs (R-SMADs), to drive the TGF-β canonical signalling pathway. These two SMADs
  get transported into the nucleus as a complex with SMAD4 (curved green arrow), where
  they interact with other transcription factors to upregulate the expression of various
  profibrotic genes, including ACTA2, CCN2, COL1A1, COL1A2 and FN1 in the fibroblasts
  and myofibroblasts of lung. The inhibitory SMADs, namely SMAD6/7, bind with TβRI
  to prevent recruitment and phosphorylation of the R-SMADs, which dampen TGF-β signalling
  thereby blocking the transcription of genes encoding profibrotic factors. In addition,
  the activated TGF-β1 ligand bound to its receptors can signal through various non-canonical
  pathways, including ones involving MAPKs (ERK, JNK, p38), PI3K/AKT, c-ABL, JAK2/STAT3,
  SMURF1/2 and ROCKs. Some of these mediatory signalling cascades can act either directly
