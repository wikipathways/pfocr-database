caption: Figure 1. (A) Interactions between endocytic and autophagic pathways. The
  endosomal system allows the sorting of membrane lipids and proteins to the lysosome
  for degradation. The degradation of membrane proteins which is triggered by ubiquitylation
  and the subsequent delivery of cargoes to the intralumenal vesicles (ILV) of a late
  endosomal compartment, called multi-vesicular body (MVB), required the ESCRT machinery.
  Ultimately, ILVs are degraded after fusion with the lysosome. Induction of the autophagic
  degradative pathway drives the expansion of a small flat membrane bag, named the
  phagophore, which sequesters cytoplasmic cargoes. After completion and closure,
  a double-membrane autophagosome is formed, which then fuses with the lysosome to
  forme an autolysosome. Alternatively, autophagosomes can fuse with early endosomes
  and MVBs to generate amphisomes containing both cytoplasmic cargo and endocytosed
  materials which finally fuse with lysosomes. (B-C). Main models to explain the increase
  of autophagosomes in ESCRT mutants. (B) The inactivation of ESCRT machinery leads
  to the accumulation of autophagosomes because the endosomes are abnormal. A blockage
  (red bar) of autophagosome-lysosome fusion is then responsible for the increase
  of autophagosomes but the autophagic degradation is inhibited. (C) The inactivation
  of ESCRT machinery promotes the induction of a functional autophagic flux (green
  arrow) in response to homeostasis defect. A defect in signaling or in the “feeding
  status” due to the presence of abnormal endosomes alters cell homeostasis. To correct
  this imbalance, the cell generates a signal which triggers a functional autophagic
  flux increase. Note that these two models are not mutually exclusive.
