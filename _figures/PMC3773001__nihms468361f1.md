caption: Proposed TAM biosynthetic pathway in S. sp. 17944, featuring the TAM hybrid
  PKS-NRPS and the TamI P-450 oxygenase as the key oxidative tailoring enzyme, that
  accounts for the formation of all TAM congeners isolated to date. TAMs 1–8 were
  isolated from S. sp. 17944 wild-type, while TAMs 9–13 were from S. sp. 307-9 and
  S. sp. SCSIO 1666 wild-type or mutant strains.
