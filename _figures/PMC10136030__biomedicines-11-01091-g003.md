caption: TERT is involved in major signaling pathways and participates in regulation
  of gene expression. There are several positive feedback loops that are formed due
  to mutual stimulation between TERT expression level and products of target genes
  of Wnt/β-catenin, c-Myc and NF-κB signaling pathways. TERT in complex with BRG1
  binds to the promoter regions of the Wnt/β-catenin target genes and participates
  in their regulation. Further, telomerase can modulate the expression of the NF-κB
  signaling pathway, forming the TERT–NF-kB subunit p65 complex. This leads to an
  increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, including Bcl-2, which is able
  to induce telomerase transcription and increase its functional activity. NF-κB is
  also able to negatively regulate the stability of p53 via E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2.
  Activation of p53 leads to an increase in the level of transcription of pro-apoptotic
  proteins and a decrease in the level of telomerase. Furthermore, stable signaling
  through Wnt/β-catenin pathway leads to the accumulation of active p53, which can
  contribute to β-catenin degradation. The positive regulators of TERT include NF-κB
  itself, β-catenin in complex with transcription factor 4 (TCF4) and Kruppel-like
  factor 4 (Klf4), and c-Myc. Altogether, increased signaling of NF-κB pathway and
  elevated TERT levels promote cell survival by upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes,
  whereas p53 activation promotes apoptosis through activation of pro-apoptotic genes.
