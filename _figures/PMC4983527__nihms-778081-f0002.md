caption: A. CyaA binds to the bent form of the CR3 receptor. A portion of the C-terminal
  hemolysin domain of CyaA then inserts into the plasma membrane, enabling translocation
  of the N-terminal catalytic adenylate cyclase (AC) domain. This transport event
  appears to require only calcium and a negative membrane potential. In the cytosol,
  AC converts ATP to cAMP in a reaction that depends on calmodulin (CaM). cAMP triggers
  a signaling cascade that inhibits CR3’s normal signal transduction pathway, which
  is activated when CR3’s natural ligand binds to CR3 in the extended conformation.
  Because normal CR3 signaling promotes phagocytosis and innate immunity, CyaA is
  thought to cripple the host defense response in this manner. B. Through its C-terminal
  receptor-binding HC-C domain, BoNT interacts with its host receptors, including
  the lipid receptor ganglioside and protein receptor SV2. Receptor-mediated endocytosis
  targets BoNT into endosomes (synaptic vesicles) in presynaptic nerve terminals.
  The low pH in this environment induces a toxin conformational change such that the
  HN domain is inserted into the synaptic vesicle membrane. Membrane-inserted HC acts
  as a channel, translocating the metalloprotease L chain into the cytosol, which
  remains associated with the H chain via a disulfide bond. The thioredoxin reductase-thioredoxin
  (TrxR-Trx) system present on the cytosolic side of the synaptic membrane reduces
  the BoNT disulfide bond, releasing the catalytic L chain into the cytosol. L chain
  cleaves cytosolic SNARE proteins to impair release of acetylcholine from the nerve
  terminals, leading to paralysis that characterizes botulism. C. Via its receptor-binding
  B (CTB) subunit, cholera toxin binds to ganglioside receptor on the surface of intestinal
  epithelial cells. This triggers endocytosis, driving the holotoxin to the ER. In
  the ER, the holotoxin targets to the ERAD membrane machinery (whose central component
  includes Hrd1, one of a few ER-resident E3 ubiquitin ligases) by the actions of
  the BiP chaperone and co-chaperone (ERdj5 and Grp170/Sil1) complex. An unidentified
  reductase reduces the disulfide bond in the catalytic A (CTA) subunit generating
  CTA1, which is in turn unfolded by PDI. Unfolded CTA1 retro-translocates into the
  cytosol by crossing the ERAD membrane channel postulated to be Hrd1. Although CTA1
  is not ubiquitinated, an intact ubiquitination-deubiquitination cycle catalyzed
  by Hrd1 and the YOD1 deubiquitinase is required. In the cytosol, CTA1 activates
  a signaling cascade, leading to water secretion across epithelial cells that results
  in diarrhea.
