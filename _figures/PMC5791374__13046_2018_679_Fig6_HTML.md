caption: miR-181 targets CTDSPL, which modulates the cell cycle effector E2F1. Schematic
  representation of the pathway modulated by miR-181 in UM cells progressing through
  the cell cycle. miR-181 overexpression in UM cells induces progression through the
  G1/S transition and promotes S-phase entry. Thus, miR-181 induces cell cycle progression
  by repressing the downstream target CTDSPL, which in turn results in the phosphorylation
  of RB and an accumulation of the downstream cell cycle effector E2F1

  tumor suppressor in uveal melanoma.
