caption: Aerobic glycolysis stimulation by activated canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway.
  Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is required to take up enough glucose
  to cell survival. PI3K/Akt pathway is stimulated to maintain a sufficient ATP production
  through the metabolism of glucose. Glucose is transformed into pyruvate into the
  mitochondria for the oxidative phosphorylation process. However, during WNT activation,
  WNT signal transduction results in activation of c-Myc, lactate dehydrogenase A
  (LDH-A), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1).
  The WNT target genes cooperate to divert glycolytically derived pyruvate into lactate
  which is expelled out the cell by MCT-1. Moreover, c-Myc induces glutamine uptake
  and glutaminolysis to support mitochondrial integrity and aspartate production.
  Accumulation of cytosolic lactate involves several pathways such as nucleotide synthesis,
  lipid synthesis and cell division.
