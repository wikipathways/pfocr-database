caption: Germline ablation modulates a series of pro-longevity transcription factors
  and clearance mechanisms that extends healthspan. Removal of the germline, but not
  of somatic gonad, promotes healthspan and longevity in C. elegans. The ablation
  of the germline promotes longevity by triggering an active signaling network involving
  the nuclear localization and activation of FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. DAF-16
  is negatively regulated by the daf-2/insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling
  (IIS) pathway and, when active, regulates downstream genes that activate the proteasome,
  increase stress resistance and ultimately extend lifespan. The induction of a number
  of these genes is dependent on TCER-1 and the ankyrin repeat- containing protein
  KRI-1. Germline loss also causes TOR (target of rapamycin) downregulation, which
  in turn stimulates pha-4, the worm FOXA forkhead transcription factor ortholog,
  and daf-16 expression. Furthermore, activation through somatic gonad signaling of
  cytochrome P450 DAF-9, and of the steroid hormone receptor DAF-12 is necessary for
  the nuclear localization of DAF-16 and activation of stress resistance responses.
