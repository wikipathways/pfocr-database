caption: CircRNAs mediate tumor survival and apoptosis by UPR. Circ_002117 induced
  ER stress by upregulating GRP78, IRE1, eIF2α, and CHOP, subsequently resulting in
  the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. CircCDR1as induces ER stress by upregulating
  eIF2α under hypoxia conditions, increasing OSCC cell survival. Moreover, circCDR1as
  promoted hypoxia-induced autophagy in OSCC cells by sponging miR-671-5p. CircRNA_101036
  induced the UPR pro-apoptosis pathway by increasing CHOP protein, which induces
  apoptosis
