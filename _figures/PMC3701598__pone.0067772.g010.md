caption: (1) In the present study, proteins identified are mainly involved in biological
  functions of energy and metabolic pathways, cell growth and maintenance, signal
  transduction and protein metabolism. We hypothesize that the selected six proteins
  are associated with structural constituents of the cytoskeleton, catalytic activity,
  molecular chaperones, and heat shock proteins (HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90) which were
  all found expressed in many cell types. (2) Alpha-tubulin, and TCP-1α were expressed
  with higher expression levels in both rES than in fibroblasts. It is likely that
  these proteins may play an active role in cell proliferation and/or as regulative
  proteins for the cytoskeleton rES cells. (3) Peroxiredoxin 1 functions to serve
  as reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxifiers to protect cytoplasm from internal
  and external environmental stresses. (4) HSP60 may bind some pluripotency proteins
  (e.g. Oct4 and Nanog) or genes (c-myc and Stat3) that are associated with stress
  tolerance and/or maintenance of stemness in ES cells. (5) On the other hand, HSP90
  hydrolyzes ATP and forms a stable complex with HSP70 and HSP70/HSP90/organizing
  protein (HOP), which is a 60 kDa co-chaperone that binds and regulates the activity
  of chaperones related to the LIF/STAT signaling pathway. It has also been reported
  that HOP down-regulates soluble phosphotyrosine, leading to an extranuclear accumulation
  of STAT3 in LIF/STAT pathway, which ultimately reduced Nanog mRNA levels and lost
  the ability of ES cells to form embryoid bodies. (6) Some other molecules, such
  as peroxiredoxin 2, cytoplasmic linker 2 and cofilin-1, are actively expressed in
  rabbit ES cells. Peroxiredoxin 2 may play an antioxidant protective role in ES cells.
  Cytoplasmic linker 2 has been reported as a microtubule plus-end tracking protein
  that maintains microtubule dynamics by nucleation of non-centrosomal microtubules
  originated from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Cofilin-1 is a membrane receptor
  for estrogen to regulate the mobility of ES cells. The corresponding groups (, ,
  , ) of the mentioned proteins were also listed.
