caption: 'Schematic diagram of the proposed mechanism of TX''s neuroprotection against
  Mn toxicity by upregulating REST expression via Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CAD neurons.
  TX activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via ER-α, while Mn inhibits this
  pathway by dysregulating Wnt3a and Dkk-1. TX and Mn modulate GSK3β function by differentially
  phosphorylating GSK3β at S9 and/or Y216, leading to alteration of β-catenin levels
  in the cytosol and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. β-catenin forms a complex
  with TCF/LEF in the nucleus, which binds to WRE on the REST promoter, inducing REST
  transcription. These findings suggest that TX exerts neuroprotective effects against
  Mn toxicity by increasing REST via the ER-α/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Red:
  Mn-induced effects; blue: TX-induced effects'
