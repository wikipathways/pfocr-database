caption: Steps in the generation of Th17 cells. The activation of naive T cells in
  the presence of TGF-β and IL-6 initiates the Th17 differentiation pathway. Th17
  cells produce IL-21, which further amplifies Th17 generation in an autocrine manner.
  IL-21 also induces the IL-23R on differentiated Th17 cells to make them responsive
  to IL-23 signaling. IL-23 stabilizes the Th17 phenotype by secreting IL-17A, IL-17F
  and IL-22 and helping Th17 cells to acquire effector functions. STAT-3 plays an
  important role in Th17 differentiation, amplification and stabilization as IL-6,
  IL-21 and IL-23 signals through STAT-3.
