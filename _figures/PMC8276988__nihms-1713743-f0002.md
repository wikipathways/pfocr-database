caption: 'Crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis leading to the release of ATP.
  Continued ER stress induced by chemotherapeutic agents lead to cell death by either
  autophagy or apoptosis. There is a mutual inhibition mechanism between apoptosis
  and autophagy. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway can be activated by the release of
  CHOP due to continued ER stress which activates Bax to induce mitochondrial outer
  membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and downstream activation of caspase-9. caspase-9
  in turn activates effector caspase-3 which brings about apoptosis []. However, it
  has also been found that caspase mediated cleaving of ATG4D helps promote autophagy
  []. The release of ATP in the extracellular space is dependent upon PANX1, which
  when cleaved by caspase-3 forms channels that help in the release of ATP []. Though
  the release of ATP is dependent on caspase-3 activation, the accumulation of ATP
  and its transport to the plasma membrane is mediated by the autophagic machinery
  []. ER stress induced phosphorylation of Beclin1 by DAPK and association of Beclin1
  complex together with ATG5, ATG12, ATG16L and LC3 II help in the formation of autophagosome
  []. ATP is found to co-localise with these autophagic proteins inside the autophagosome.
  Fusion of autophagosome with lysosome leads to the formation of autolysosome [].
