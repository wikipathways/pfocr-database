caption: Metabolic pathways for the synthesis of free fatty acids, fatty acid derivatives,
  and triacylglycerols. Reactions that influence the FA profile of acyl-CoAs (blue),
  free fatty acids and derivatives (orange), and triacylglycerols and phospholipids
  (green) are labeled. Multiple reaction steps are denoted by dashed lines. Enzyme/gene
  abbreviations and precursor pathways are marked in bold. The turnover of acyl groups
  from acylated proteins and sphingolipids is not shown. Desaturases, elongases, acyltransferases,
  and lipases are ER or lipid body-associated (enzyme localization is not visualized
  for these enzymes). PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  ACS, acetyl-CoA synthase; ACL, ATP-citrate lyase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FASI
  fatty acid synthase type I; FASII, fatty acid synthase type II; TE, thioesterase;
  mFAS, mammalian fatty acid synthase; FASI-TE, fatty acid synthase type I with integrated
  thioesterase; FAD, fatty acid desaturases; ELO, fatty acid elongases (and auxiliary
  enzymes); ASAT, Acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferase; FAA, acyl-CoA synthetase; DE, derivatizing
  enzymes; SEH, sterol ester hydrolase; TGL, triacylglycerol lipases; PL, phospholipid
  lipases; GPAT, glycerol- 3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPAAT, lysophosphatidic acid
  acyltransferase; PAP, phosphatidic acid phosphatase; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase;
  CDS, CDP-diglyceride synthetase; PDAT, phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase
