caption: Cytokines, chemokines and signaling pathways influence both LSCs and MSCs.
  Abundant cytokines and chemokines are released by both LSCs and leukemic MSCs, which
  are mainly involved with the changes in inflammatory factors, proliferation and
  differentiation-associated cytokines, hematopoietic homeostasis-related chemokines,
  etc. They involve changes in multiple signaling pathways, such as the newfound VCAM1-VLA4-PGF/NF-κB,
  Gas6-AXL/p-AKT/β-catenin, MIF-PKCβ/IL-8, etc. Meanwhile, WNT/beta-catenin, Notch/Jagged,
  and other pathways are also disordered in leukemic niche. The integrin, considered
  to be widely expressed in both LSCs and MSCs, is involved in a series of classical
  pathways. The classic signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation and stemness
  such as MEK/ERK, JAK/STAST3, PI3K/AKT, etc., are not described in the figure, but
  they induce many changes in both types of cells.
