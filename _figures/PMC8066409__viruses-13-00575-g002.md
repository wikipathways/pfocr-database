caption: The non-transcriptional activation of IRF3 by RIPA causes cell death. IRF3
  can be activated by RNA or DNA virus infection, which triggers RIG-I or cGAS signaling
  pathways. The RIG-I activation by RNA or DNA viruses can recruit a complex by TBK1/TRAF2/TRAF6,
  which allows the binding of IRF3 to LUBAC. The LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitination
  of IRF3 leads to its translocation to the mitochondria and interaction with BAX.
  Mitochondrial translocation of IRF3/BAX complex leads to cytochrome C release that
  activates the apoptotic caspases, leading to apoptotic cell death. This pathway
  has been named ‘RIPA’, which can also be triggered by ethanol, CCL4, and free fatty
  acids, which activate the PRR signaling pathways.
