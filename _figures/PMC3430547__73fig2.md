caption: The Ras/PKA and Gpa2 pathways. The Ras/PKA pathway plays a central role in
  regulating growth vs. quiescence in response to the quality and quantity of the
  available carbon source, primarily by stimulating mass accumulation and inhibiting
  the stress response. The major input proceeds through Ras, likely in response to
  glucose-stimulated intracellular acidification, with minor input through the G-protein
  coupled receptor, Gpr1. Sch9 also mediates the cell growth response to glucose but
  the indicated link is only speculative. Red dots signify phosphorylation.
