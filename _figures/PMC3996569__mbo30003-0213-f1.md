caption: Pathway of lipid synthesis in Bacillus subtilis. Elongation of fatty acids
  (FA) is catalyzed by the type II fatty acid synthase (FASII) via a repeated cycle
  of condensation, reduction, dehydration, and a second reduction of carbon–carbon
  bonds, giving rise to acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) with two additional methylene
  groups at the end of each cycle. Generation of malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACC) is required to start the cycle of chain elongation by the complex. Phospholipid
  synthesis (shaded) initiates by the action of PlsX which converts acyl-ACPs to acyl-PO4.
  Then PlsY transfers the acyl moiety to the 1 position of glycerol-3-P (G3P) to form
  acyl-G3P. Acylation of the two position to form phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) is catalyzed
  by PlsC. Fungal toxin cerulenin inhibits the elongation condensing enzyme FabF,
  precluding not only FA but also phospholipid synthesis. The last step of the elongation
  cycle, catalyzed by enoyl-ACP reductases (FabI and FabL) is inhibited by triclosan.
  Expression of the genes coding for enzymes surrounded by ellipses is repressed by
  FapR, whose activity is, in turn, antagonized by malonyl-CoA.
