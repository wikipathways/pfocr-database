caption: 'Metabolic rewiring in melanoma engages more carbon than just glucose. Metabolic
  pathway map of melanoma highlighting major cellular carbon sources. Glucose (red)
  is mainly converted to lactate. A fraction of the glycolytic flux is diverted into
  serine and alanine. Glutamine (blue) is the major precursor of tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle metabolites. Oxoglutarate formed from glutamine traverses the TCA cycle
  in the conventional forward direction (clockwise, light blue arrow, oxidative glutaminolysis).
  Carbon from glutamine also runs in reverse (counterclockwise, blue arrow, reductive
  carboxylation), providing a route for incorporation of carbon from glutamine into
  fatty acids (for experimental measurement see ). Arginine (green) is a potential
  precursor for proline via ornithine and pyrroline-5-carboxylate (p5c) (green arrows).
  However, in melanoma, arginine cannot be synthesized via the urea cycle due to a
  lack of expression of arginosuccinate synthetase. Enzymes mentioned in the text
  are mapped on the metabolic pathway map of melanoma: PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase;
  LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase;
  GPT, glutamate pyruvic transaminase; GLS, glutaminase; PYCR, pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  reductase.'
