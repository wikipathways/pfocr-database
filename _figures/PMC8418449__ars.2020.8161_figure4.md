caption: Cellular metabolic pathway involved in redox homeostasis. The major metabolic
  pathways that regulate redox homeostasis in ECs are as shown. Parts of metabolic
  pathways that take place in immune cells (e.g., those involving itaconate) are also
  included. Metabolic pathways that regulate redox homeostasis are limited to those
  involved in the production of NADPH and GSH (shown in green) and that regulate eNOS
  activity (shown in red). The ECs primarily utilize glycolysis (shaded in green)
  to obtain ATP. During this process, ECs generate pyruvate and lactate from glucose,
  thereby contributing to four additional pathways. The first of these, known as the
  PPP (shaded in yellow), includes both oxPPP and non-oxPPP pathways that contribute
  to antioxidant defense and nucleotide synthesis, respectively. Second, 1C metabolism
  (shaded in gray) contributes to protein and nucleotide methylation. Third, the hexosamine
  pathway (shaded in blue) uses F6P to promote protein glycosylation and synthesis
  of the luminal glycocalyx. Finally, after glycolysis, pyruvate can enter the mitochondria
  where it is converted to acetyl-CoA and can then enter the TCA cycle (shown in purple).
  NADPH is essential not only for antioxidant defense pathways, including the PRX/TRX
  and GPX/GSH systems that mitigate ROS-related cellular damage, but it is also necessary
  for the generation of NO• (a cofactor for NOS) and O2•− (a cofactor of the NOX enzymes).
  The major metabolic pathways that generate NADPH include oxPPP, ME1, 1C metabolism,
  IDH1/2, glutamine metabolism, and CPT1-mediated FAO. De novo synthesis of the antioxidant,
  GSH (shown in green) involves CySS import into the cell via the CySS/glutamate transporter
  (xCT), cysteine generated from methionine via the transsulfuration pathway, and
  glutamine metabolism. Cysteine is also involved in the synthesis of the gaseous
  transmitter, H2S. The primary metabolic pathways contributing to coupled and uncoupled
  eNOS include the ornithine cycle (shaded in pink), the mevalonate pathway (shaded
  in pale blue), and 1C metabolism (via BH4). Lastly, itaconate synthesized from aconitate
  in activated macrophages via the actions of IRG1 inhibits the activity of SDH. This
  inhibits ROS generation by RET at complex I. CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1;
  CySS, cystine; EC, endothelial cell; eNOS, endothelial NOS; FAO, fatty acid oxidation;
  H2S, hydrogen sulfide; IRG1, immune-responsive gene 1; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;
  oxPPP, oxidative PPP; xCT, the cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11. Color images
  are available online.
