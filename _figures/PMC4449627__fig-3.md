caption: Nonoxidative pathways in diabetic cardiomyopathy and proposed effects of
  exercise training. Hyperglycemia and reduced shunting of carbons from glycolysis
  into glucose oxidation may lead to the induction of nonoxidative glucose pathways,
  including the polyol, hexosamine biosynthetic (HBP), protein kinase C (PKC), and
  advanced glycation end-products (AGE) pathway in the diabetic heart. Increased plasma
  levels of AGEs can also bind to AGE receptors (RAGEs), which together with PKC and
  oxidative stress are known activators of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Increased NF-κB
  activity together with these pathways may mediate adverse effects in the diabetic
  heart due to impaired myocardial reductive capacity, formation of AGEs, and sustained
  O-GlcNAcylation of proteins. Exercise training may, through improved glucose homeostasis
  and increased myocardial glucose oxidation, reverse the induction of several nonoxidative
  glucose pathways in the diabetic heart. In addition, exercise can increase plasma
  levels of the soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE), which may work as a scavenger for AGEs
  and therefore reduce the intracellular effects of AGE/RAGE signaling. See “” section
  for references.
