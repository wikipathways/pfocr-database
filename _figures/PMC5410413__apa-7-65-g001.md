caption: . Physiology and metabolism of vitamin D. Upon exposure to ultraviolet B
  radiation (UVB, wavelengths of 290–315 nm), 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) transforms
  into vitamin D3, which enters the circulation and binds vitamin D-binding protein
  (VDBP). In the classic vitamin D3 pathway, vitamin D3 then undergoes hydroxylation
  in the 25-position by vitamin D-25-hydroxylase (25-OHase) in the liver to form 25(OH)D3
  and in the 1-position by 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-alpha-hydroxylase (1α-OHase) in the
  kidney (functioning as an endocrine gland) to form 1,25(OH)2D3. In the nonclassic
  vitamin D3 pathway, other cells that also possess the 1α-OHase protein produce 1,25(OH)2D3.
  1,25(OH)2D3 enters target cells from the circulation and binds to vitamin D receptor
  (VDR) in the cytoplasm. After binding, they enter the nucleus and heterodimerize
  with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). The 1,25(OH)2D3-RXR-VDR complex then binds to
  vitamin D response elements located on the DNA and initiates biological responses
  through regulation of gene transcription and activation of a variety of signal transduction
  pathways. PTH, parathyroid hormone.
