  phagocyte system blockade. Adapted with permission from . Copyright Year 2021, Elsevier.
  B) The effects of DOX@Exos-PH20-FA on TME regulation programs indicate that this
  leads to increased uptake of DDS by tumors and a shift in the immune microenvironment
  from immunosuppression to immune support for cancer treatment. Adapted with permission

  to enact the Caspase-3 pathway through chemotherapy-hyperthermia in commitment to
  glioma cell apoptosis, which implies cancer development is smothered. Adapted with
