caption: Key components of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS consists of endocannabinoids,
  endocannabinoid receptors, and anabolic and catabolic enzymes of the endocannabinoids.
  N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and N-arachidonoylethanolamine (2-AG) represent
  two major endocannabinoids in the human body. N-arachidonoylethanolamine is synthesized
  from phospholipids by several pathways, the major pathway involving the anabolic
  enzyme N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PDL). N-arachidonoylethanolamine
  is mainly degraded to arachidonic acid and ethanolamine by fatty acid amide hydrolase
  (FAAH). The synthesis of 2-AG involves a signaling pathway starting from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) and triacylglycerol (TAG) and is mediated by diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL)-α
  and DAGLβ. N-arachidonoylethanolamine is mainly degraded to arachidonic acid and
  glycerol by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-AG
  exert diverse physiological actions through cannabinoid receptors including cannabinoid
  receptor 1 (CB1R), cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R), transient receptor potential channels
  (TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, TRPV4, TRPM8, and TRPA1), orphan G protein-coupled receptors
  [GPCRs] (GPR18, GPR55, and GPR119), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
  (PPARα and PPARγ). ECB endocannabinoid, TRP transient receptor potential
