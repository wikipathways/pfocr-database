caption: (A) HR-deficient cancers require MMEJ to repair DSBs. Inhibition of POLQ
  results in synthetic lethality in HR-deficient cancers. (B) POLQ deficiency is synthetically
  lethal with ATR inhibition. Inhibition of the ATR-CHK1-WEE1 signaling cascade leading
  to replication stress in combination with POLQ inhibition would result in synthetic
  lethality. (C) PARP inhibition results in DSBs which can be repaired by MMEJ. Inhibition
  of both PARP and POLQ (MMEJ) induces synthetic lethality.
