caption: Viral dsRNAs and 5′-triphosphate-bearing, poly-U rich viral RNAs are recognized
  by the RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2) that are constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm
  and that initiate MAVS-dependent signaling leading to activation of IRF3/7 and NF-κB,
  and ultimately, synthesis of type I and III IFNs and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines.
  Viral dsRNAs can also be sensed by TLR3 in late endosomes and trigger a TRIF-dependent
  pathway activating innate immune responses. Both the RIG-I and TLR3 pathways are
  capable of sensing HCV infection in hepatocytes. Viral ssRNAs can be sensed by TLR7
  or TLR8 in endosomes and activate MyD88-dependent innate immune responses. TLR7
  operates exclusively in pDCs and mainly results in IRF7 activation and subsequent
  induction of IFN-α and IFN-λs, while TLR8 operates in mDCs and mainly leads to expression
  of NF-κB-dependent cytokines. pDCs use the TLR7 pathway to sense co-cultured HCV-infected
  hepatocytes, resulting in IFN-α production.
