caption: In healthy individuals, APP is transcribed in the endoplasmatic reticulum
  (ER, grey), modified in the golgi network (Golgi, grey) and then shuttled to the
  cell surface through the secretory pathway (SecP, grey). The cell takes up APP through
  endocytosis (End, light blue). From here, APP can either be degraded via autophagy
  (Aut, yellow) and the lysosomes (Lys, dark blue) or APP can be recycled via the
  recycling endosomes (R-End, light blue) and enter the cycle again. In AD brains
  and Becn1 deficient cells BECN1 deficiency impairs both induction of autophagy (through
  the complex with PIK3C3) and autophagosomal degradation (potentially through a complex
  with an unknown binding partner). APP containing vesicles (endosomes, autophagosomes,
  and others) build up inside the cell. APP is increasingly cleaved by secretases
  and large amounts of APP-CTF and Aβ are being released, causing neurotoxic events.
  The disruption of autophagosomal degradation includes an increasing accumulation
  of autophagosomes. This accumulation can further inhibit autophagy and BECN1 expression
  (red arrow), worsening the reduction in APP turnover and degradation.
