caption: MEP increases phospho-activation of Src and Pyk2 by day 2 of treatment. These
  kinases are known to mediate synaptic localization of NMDARs by phosphorylation
  of their C-terminal regulatory domains, which occludes internalization by clathrin/AP2-mediated
  endocytosis. Increased expression of NMDAR subunits in combination with PSD-95 ()
  results in enhanced synaptically-localized receptor complex. Synaptic NMDAR activity
  increases neuronal antioxidant defenses in the form of upregulating Prx2 and resultant
  neuroprotection. This pathway can be circumvented by D3T, which lends support to
  the speculation that naturally occurring phytochemicals in combination with extrasynaptic
  NMDAR blockers may act synergistically to combat redox stress-related neurodegenerative
  processes.
