caption: Summary of known actions of activated ras-p21 in cells, beginning (top, left)
  when a growth factor binds to its cell receptor. This results in activation of intracytoplasmic
  tyrosine kinase (TK) activity on the receptor that binds to the adapter grb-2 protein
  that concurrently binds to and activates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor
  (GNEF), SOS. This, in turn, induces ras-p21 to exchange GDP for GTP, resulting in
  its activation. ras-p21 is bound to the inner cell membrane by a covalent farnesyl
  moiety attachment in thioether linkage to Cys 186. In its GTP-bound form ras-p21
  binds to a number of other target proteins. One of these is GAP (GTPase activating
  protein) that induces GTPase activity in ras-p21 resulting in hydrolysis of GTP
  to GDP cycling ras-p21 into the inactive state. Both GAP and SOS may also be involved
  as a target in ras signaling, hence the question mark below the GAP box. Activated
  ras-p21 also binds to and activates raf (top middle of the figure), a 74 kDa Ser/Thr
  kinase protein that, in turn, activates the kinase cascade in which it activates
  MEK that finally activates ERK (MAP-2K in the figure) that is involved in cytoskeletal
  rearrangements in the cytosol and which shuttles into the nucleus where it activates
  the nuclear transcription factor, fos, that forms a heterodimeric complex with the
  nuclear transcription factor, jun. The latter protein is activated by another kinase,
  jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), that occurs on a separate pathway called the stress-activated
  protein (SAP) pathway. As explained in the text, oncogenic ras-p21 directly activates
  JNK/jun that circumvents the normal, regulated wild-type ras-p21-activated pathways
  (right side of the figure). ras-p21 also interacts directly with phosphoinositol-3-hydroxy
  kinase (PI3K, left side of the figure) and induces activation of phospholipase C
  (PLC); both of these proteins cause increases in the second messenger molecule,
  inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG); the former induces calcium
  mobilization while the latter induces activation of protein kinase C (PKC) that
  is especially critical to the oncogenic ras-p21 pathway. In the nucleus, the fos-jun
  complex, also called AP1, induces transcription of many pro-mitogenic proteins including
  cyclins and possible the nuclear skeletal proteins called nuclear matrix proteins
  (NMP’s); other nuclear proteins, like myc, also transcriptionally active, are also
  often activated in this process. Anti-oncogene proteins, such as p53, also become
  activated. This protein blocks transcription of pro-mitotic proteins and induces
  apoptosis in transformed cells.
