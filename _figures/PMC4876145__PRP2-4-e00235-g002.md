caption: Pharmacodynamic profile of Mdivi‐1. Mdivi‐1 confers cytoprotection by employing
  a Drp1‐dependent inhibition of Bax/Bak‐mediated apoptosis, activating the RISK pathway,
  upregulating mitochondrial large conductance Ca2+and voltage activated K+ (Mito‐BK)
  channel as well as reducing ROS. Its cytotoxic effect is exerted independent of
  Drp1 and through activation of Noxa‐mediated apoptosis. Mdivi‐1 also exerts an inhibitory
  effect on hyperproliferative cells by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest and impairs
  mitosis. Bak, Bcl2‐antagonist/killer 1; Bax, Bcl2‐associated X protein; DNA, deoxyribonucleic
  acid; Drp1, dynamin‐related protein 1; G2/M, second gap/mitosis; Mito‐BK, mitochondrial
  big potassium channel; RISK, reperfusion injury salvation kinase; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species.
