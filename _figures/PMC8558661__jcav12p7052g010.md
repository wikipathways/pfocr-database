caption: Schematic diagram characterizing the anticancer mechanism underlying the
  effects of H. zeylanica-E2 treatment in GC cells. H. zeylanica-E2 may increase GC
  apoptosis, autophagy, and cell cycle arrest, but may suppress GC migration. Apoptosis
  and autophagy are regulated by endogenous apoptosis-associated proteins (Bcl-2,
  Bax, caspase 3/7, and cleaved PARP), and autophagy-associated proteins (ATG7, ATG5,
  LC3-I, and LC3-II). Cell cycle arrest may occur in G0/G1 and G2/M. All of these
  anticancer effects may be partly ascribed to TNF-α activation of the proinflammatory
  COX-2 pathway. Taken together, these anticancer effects suggest that H. zeylanica-E2
  has potential as a chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of GC.
