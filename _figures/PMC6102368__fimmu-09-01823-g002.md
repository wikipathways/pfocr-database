caption: The interplay between IL-6 and Notch affects the anticancer immune response.
  1. The overexpression of Notch ligands, Jagged1 and Jagged2 by tumor cells promotes
  the activation of the Notch signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME), boosting
  IL-6 secretion by the same cancer cells and by the neighboring stromal cells ().
  2. On the other hand, IL-6 increases the expression of Jagged1 and Notch3 in tumor
  cells (). 3. High IL-6 levels in the TME promote tumor cells growth, resistance
  to therapy, osteoclastogenesis, and contributes to the development of an immunosuppressive
  niche. Indeed, the activation of IL-6R on immune cells causes the polarization of
  M2 macrophages. 4. The differentiation of CD4+ T cells into interleukin 4 (IL-4)-producing
  Th2 cells. 5. The increased differentiation of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells. 6. The
  development of interleukin 10 (IL-10)-producing regulatory DCs (). 7. An alternative
  source of IL-6 is represented by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs
  support tumor stem cell maintenance by a combined action of IL-6 and nitric oxide
  (NO). Indeed, MDSCs, through the release of IL-6, promotes the phosphorylation of
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) essential for maintenance
  of cancer cell stemness, and by producing NO indirectly activates the Notch pathway.
  Notch activation, in turn, causes prolonged STAT3 activation ().
