caption: 'Pathway of sulfate assimilation/cysteine biosynthesis in enterics versus
  pseudomonads. Intermediates of cysteine biosynthesis are shown in bold. Gene products
  with relevant enzymatic activities (CysDN, CysC, etc.) are given below or beside
  the respective steps in boxes. Abbreviations: APS, adenosine phosphosulfate; PAPS,
  phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate; OAS, O-acetylserine. The negative allosteric regulation
  of CysE activity by intracellular cysteine, and the requirement for N-acetylserine
  (a product of spontaneous rearrangement of OAS) to induce sulfate assimilatory gene
  expression (via CysB), affords coordination between serine activation and sulfate
  activation/reduction activities in response to metabolic demand for cysteine ().'
