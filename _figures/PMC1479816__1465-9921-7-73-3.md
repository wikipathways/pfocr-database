caption: Pathways involved in mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation induced
  by G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). G protein coupled muscarinic receptors activate
  signaling cascades resulting in p42/p44 MAP kinase (MAPK), Rho-kinase and phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K) activity. In addition, the signaling output of receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs) is enhanced. Activation of the PI3K pathway appears to be particularly important
  in mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation. With Akt and mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) as signaling intermediates, PI3K activates p70S6K, which is
  involved in ribosome mediated protein translation. p42/p44 MAPK, activated by the
  sequential activation of Ras, Raf and MEK, also activates p70S6K and plays an important
  role in the induction of transcription factors involved in cell cycle progression.
  Rho-kinase activated transcription factors also play a central role in smooth muscle
  specific gene transcription, ultimately mediating the accumulation of contractile
  and contraction regulatory proteins. See the text for further detail.
