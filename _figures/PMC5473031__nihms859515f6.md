caption: Desensitization of nAChRs during gestational nicotine/SS-exposure affects
  HIF-1α levels increasing apoptosis and decreasing angiogenesis in the lung. The
  expression of pro-apoptotic miRs (miR-16 and miR-221) is significantly elevated
  in gestationally SS-exposed. Gestational SS-exposure decreases miR-130a that targets
  the anti-angiogenic factor GAX and the proapoptotic factor RUNX3 (both GAX and RUNX3
  are increased in F1 and F2 lungs). Red arrows indicate established responses with
  upward arrows indicating significant increase and downward arrows indicating significant
  decrease in the indicated response. Components in the pathway that are without the
  arrows predict the indicated response but remain hitherto unproven.
