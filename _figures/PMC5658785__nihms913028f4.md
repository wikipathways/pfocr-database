caption: 'Various secreted soluble factors from tumor cell stimulate microglia and
  astrocyte activation. The tumor-derived soluble factors bind toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) on microglia that induces p-38 MAPK activation, resulting in up-regulation
  of matrix-metalloproteases (MMPs) and membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP).
  Microglia-released MMPs then cause extracellular matrix (ECM) digestion that promotes
  tumor invasion and macrophages/T cells infiltration. In addition, secreted transforming
  growth factor (TGF-β) from microglial cells triggers the release of pro-MMP2 from
  tumor cells which is cleaved into active form MMP2 by microglia-released MT1-MMP.
  Microglia-secreted vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) enhances angiogenesis.
  S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) induces receptor for advanced glycation end
  products (RAGE) activation on microglial cells that induces production of anti-inflammatory
  cytokines, leading to immune suppression. The metastatic tumor cell induces production
  of cytokines and chemokines in activated microglia via activation of Wnt signal.
  Upregulating Wnt signaling in microglia promotes tumor colonization and metastasis.
  Tumor cells induce astrocyte activation by production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β).
  Activated astrocytes release TGF-β, Jagged and other factors, which promotes tumor
  growth and mediates cancer stem cells self-renewal. Neuron-released neurotransmitter
  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) promotes tumor progression. The interaction of tumor
  and resident cells induces multiple pathway activation that creates favorable microenvironment
  for tumor growth. BBB: blood–brain barrier, EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor,
  HER: human epidermal growth factor receptor, IL: interleukin, JAG: jagged, MMP:
  matrix metalloproteinase, TGF: transforming growth factor, VEGF: vascular endothelial
  growth factor.'
