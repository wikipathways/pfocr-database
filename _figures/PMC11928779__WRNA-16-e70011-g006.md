caption: One carbon (1C) metabolism. The diagram outlines the folate cycle, methionine
  cycle, and transsulfuration pathway. Folic acid is converted to THF, supporting
  purine and pyrimidine synthesis, while MTHFR facilitates methyl‐THF production for
  methionine recycling, where SAM is synthesized, supporting the RNA methylation reaction.
  Homocysteine supports glutathione and redox balance, with cysteine and taurine synthesis
  supporting tRNA modifications. The pathway was constructed with information partially
  from Sanderson et al. (2019). Red star highlights metabolites discussed in the manuscript.
