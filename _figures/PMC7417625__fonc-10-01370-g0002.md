caption: MALAT1 and miR-200c regulate expression of each other through the sponging
  mechanism. Liang et al. have reported down-regulation of MALAT1 and up-regulation
  of miR-200c in patients with endometriosis (). MALAT1 increase expression of NF-κB
  which in turn binds with PGE-2 to enhance its expression (). PGE-2 activates BCL2/BAX
  through interaction with EP2/EP4 receptor and suppresses intrinsic apoptotic pathway
  (). PGE2 also activates cell proliferation through EP2/EP3 (). In addition, PGE-2
  suppresses MMP2, CD36 and annexin A2 in macrophages, thus inhibits phagocytic activity
  of macrophages. These effects facilitate implantation and growth of endometrial
  tissue in the peritoneum (). PGE-2 influences angiogenic activity and cell cycle
  progression through increasing expression of VEGF and inhibiting PTEN, respectively
  (). MALAT1 can enhance MMP9 levels. MMP9 increases production of the truncated isoform
  of Steroid receptor coactivator-1. MALAT1 also increases transcription of ZEB1/ZEB2,
  therefore induces mesenchymal cell phenotype which is accompanied by enhancement
  of cell migration ().
