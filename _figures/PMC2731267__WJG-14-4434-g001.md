caption: Some putative molecular mechanisms that underlie the antineoplastic activity
  of mesalazine. Mesalazine inhibits COX-2, thereby blocking synthesis of PGH2, an
  intermediate that is metabolized into various prostaglandins, including PGE2. PGE2
  binds to its cell surface cognate receptors (EP1-4) and sustains various functions
  of tumor cells, including proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and invasion. These
  are mediated through the transactivation of EGFR or activation of other intracellular
  pathways. The antineoplastic effects of mesalazine rely also on its ability to inhibit
  Wnt/β-catenin, through inactivation of PP2A (and downstream down-regulation of β-catenin),
  and EGFR pathways. Moreover, mesalazine activates PPAR-γ, thus leading to inactivation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and down-regulation of COX-2.
