caption: Biosynthetic pathways of carotenoids and ketocarotenoids in Chlamydomonas
  reinhardtii. In the lower right corner is the numbering of ß-ionone ring as well
  as positions where hydroxylation and ketolation reactions take place. In order to
  direct cell’s resources towards biosynthesis of highly valuable canthaxanthin and
  astaxanthin, we identified two competing side pathways—the α-carotene biosynthesis
  and xanthophylls cycle—that need to be eliminated. These pathways are highlighted
  in coloured boxes.
