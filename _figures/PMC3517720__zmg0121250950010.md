caption: Cartoon of estrogen regulation of breast cancer cell metabolism. In HG conditions,
  E2 activates AKT to enhance glycolysis while suppressing the mitochondrial metabolic
  pathways (TCA cycle and oxphos). Under LG conditions, E2 stimulates PDH activity
  via AMPK phosphorylation of serine 19 and inhibition of the activity of PDK 4 that
  inactivates PDH. This involves both ERα and ERβ. As a result, pyruvate is metabolized
  to acetyl coenzyme A, leading to the activation of the TCA cycle and oxphos. In
  this way, estrogen rescues the loss of viability of the breast cancer cells that
  results from decreased glycolysis due to low glucose substrate.
