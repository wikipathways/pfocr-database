caption: Functional alterations of mitochondria in breast cancer cells. Glucose carbon,
  which is mainly used for lactate production, is directed away from the TCA cycle
  and fatty acid (FA) synthesis. In this context, glutamine carbon feeds the TCA cycle
  and contributes to FA synthesis through the reductive pathway. The reductive carboxylation
  is supported by a disturbance in the redox ratio of mitochondria due to the aberrant
  function of the ETC, which decreases the NAD+/NADH ratio. This ratio is dissipated
  in part through the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADH to NADPH, which in
  turn may drive the NADPH-dependent reductive carboxylation of glutamine by isocitrate
  dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2. All these processes are further enhanced during
  hypoxia. Moreover, cells with ETC dysfunction use pyruvate, which is formed during
  glycolysis, to produce aspartate, which is important for cell proliferation and
  survival.
