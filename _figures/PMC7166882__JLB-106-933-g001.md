caption: Dual effects of IDO activity in the host. In response to the presence of
  a pathogen, activated T cells secrete IFN‐γ, which stimulates the expression of
  IDO in DCs and Mϕs through the JAK/STAT pathway. IDO activity reduces the amount
  of Trp available to the cell, with a subsequent increase in Kyn. The reduction of
  Trp protects the host from both, the pathogen and uncontrolled immune responses.
  However, the decrease in Trp and increase in Kyn prevents the activation and effector
  functions of T cells, which could benefit the pathogen
