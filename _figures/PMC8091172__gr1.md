caption: Predicted metabolic pathways of HMF and furfural in Cupriavidus and Pseudomonas
  species converged toward FA as central intermediate. The diagram of reconstructed
  pathways has been adapted and integrated from previous reports , , . FA conversion
  into α-ketoglutaric acid is accomplished by hmfABCDE-encoded enzymes constituting
  the lower pathway. HMFCA and FFCA dehydrogenase activities would be encoded by psfG
  and psfA genes, respectively. HmfH, HMF/furfural oxidoreductase; HmfFG, FDCA decarboxylase;
  HmfD, furoyl-CoA synthetase; HmfABC, furoyl-CoA dehydrogenase; HmfE, 2-oxoglutaryl-CoA
  hydrolase. HMF, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural; HMFCA, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic
  acid; FFCA, 5-formylfuran carboxylic acid; FDCA, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid; FA,
  furoic acid.
