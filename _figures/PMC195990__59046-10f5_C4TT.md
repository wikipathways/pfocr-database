caption: A model of Hip1's role in lung branching morphogenesis. During lung branching
  morphogenesis, the two primary buds initially elongate and later bulge to generate
  the secondary buds. Localized Fgf10 (green) expression in the distal mesenchyme
  induces primary bud formation. The mechanisms by which Fgf10 expression is initiated
  and localized are not clear. Shh (blue) is expressed in the epithelium and is up-regulated
  at the distal tips of the primary buds. In this model, in the wild-type lung, secondary
  bud formation is also induced by localized Fgf10 expression in the mesenchyme corresponding
  to the future sites of secondary bud formation. It is likely that similar mechanisms
  (indicated by a question mark in the diagram) are used to localize Fgf10 to these
  sites. Epithelial expression of Hh may help restrict Fgf10 expression to the sites
  of secondary bud formation by inhibiting Fgf10 expression. The Hh pathway transcriptionally
  activates Hip1 (gray) and Ptch1 (not shown), antagonists of Hh signaling, to down-regulate
  the Hh pathway at the sites of bud formation. As a result, the signals that activate
  Fgf10 expression overcome the mild inhibition (broken line), if any, by Hh signaling.
  In contrast, in the interbud regions, the Hh pathway effectively inhibits Fgf10
  expression. In the Hip1 mutant lung, there is a uniform up-regulation of the Hh
  pathway along the entire epithelium due to the absence of negative regulation by
  Hip1. Consequently, high levels of Hh inhibit Fgf10 expression and disrupt secondary
  bud formation. Thus, Hip1's negative regulation of the Hh pathway is necessary to
  ensure proper secondary bud formation.
