caption: Proposed side activity of PanB. PanB initiates normal carbon transfer to
  α-ketoisovalerate to form the initial adduct which then subsequently undergoes aberrant
  hydrolytic attack to cleave the glutaminyl-p-ABA group from the pterin system. The
  resulting adduct can cleave by path A which generates 2-dehydropantoate and H4-HMPterin.
  In path B, hydrolytic cleavage releases unchanged α-ketoisovalerate and produces
  the bis-hydroxymethyl intermediate that spontaneously decomposes to formaldehyde
  and H4-HMPterin. Subsequent redox steps would convert the H4-HMPterin to H2-HMPterin
  for re-entry into the biosynthetic pathway.
