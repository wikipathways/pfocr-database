caption: Amino acids biosynthesis in phototrophic and non-phototrophic bacteria. Biosynthesis
  of amino acids directly and indirectly employing pyruvate and oxaloacetate (OAA)
  as precursors is shown. The pathways for isoleucine and lysine biosynthesis are
  shown in blue and red, respectively. Phototrophic bacteria have not yet been known
  to synthesize lysine via the α-aminoadipate pathway.
