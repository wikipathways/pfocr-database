caption: The role of the Hippo pathway in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis. In
  normal cells, YAP/TAZ are phosphorylated and localized in the cytoplasm, leading
  to their inactivation. However, in many pathological situations, YAP/TAZ localize
  to the nucleus, and up-regulate their target genes to remodel the ECM. This action
  leads to tissue fibrosis. (a) In respiratory epithelial cells, binding YAP/TAZ with
  TTF-1 synergistically activates the expression of target genes, including SP-C,
  CTGF, and PAI-1. Also, active fibroblasts promote matrix synthesis via YAP/TAZ that
  are critical to the induction of profibrotic genes, such as CTGF and PAI-1, in the
  development of lung fibrosis. (b) NPHP4, by interacting with LATS1/2, promotes YAP/TAZ
  transcriptional activity. In contrast, NPHP9, another NPH proteins (NPHPs), directly
  interacts with YAP/TAZ and induces its nuclear localization to regulate a subset
  of target genes involved in renal fibrosis. (c) YAP/TAZ-mediated Indian hedgehog
  (Ihh) gene induction, which increases transcriptional reprogramming by modulating
  profibrotic gene expression in HSCs. In response to Ihh and TGF-β, HSCs transdifferentiate
  into the ECM-producing myofibroblasts. (d) YAP/TAZ are mainly localized with the
  nucleus, resulting in the profibrotic gene expression in dermal fibrolasts. See
  text for further details. The red spheres indicate the phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ
  by kinase.
