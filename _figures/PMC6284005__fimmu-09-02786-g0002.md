caption: Model, how mTORC1 signaling controls epidermal homeostasis and contributes
  to psoriasis. In healthy, basal keratinocytes, mTORC1 signaling pathway is active
  and controls proliferation while blocking differentiation. When cells leave the
  proliferative, basal compartment, mTORC1 is switched off and differentiation is
  enabled. Under inflammatory conditions, such as in psoriasis, mTORC1 is permanently
  activated, which leads to massive proliferation in the basal layer and disturbed
  keratinocyte differentiation in suprabasal layers, resulting in the phenotypic changes
  typical of psoriasis.
