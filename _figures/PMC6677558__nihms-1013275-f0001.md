caption: Model of the regulation of light-mediated AS. Light regulates AS widely via
  three primary types of sensory photoreceptor pathways (phytochromes, cryptochromes
  and ZTL/LKP2/FKF1) or retrograde signals from chloroplast. Splicing factors, such
  as RS31, SR30, SR34a, RRC1 and SKIP, are involved in light-mediated AS regulation,
  whereas these splicing factors are also under the regulation of AS. Intriguingly,
  AS of PHYA, CRY2, ZTL and other genes involved in light signaling pathways, such
  as COP1, HYH, CCA1 and TOC1, might form a feedback loop in response to light. Solid
  arrow illustrates genes involved in light signaling pathway to regulate AS. Thick
  broken arrow represents weak indirect evidence that genes involved in light signaling
  pathway to regulate AS. Dash arrow indicates genes that are under the regulation
  of AS. Light-mediated AS has function on dominant negative regulation, different
  subcellular localization or taking part in NMD pathway.
