caption: Schematic diagram of apoptosis pathway. The extrinsic pathway starts with
  covalent bonds of death receptors and ligands, which activate caspase-8 and caspase-3
  sequentially to lead to apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway passes through p53 and
  mitochondria to the apoptosome, which is a combination of APAF 1 and caspase-9 and
  leads to the cell death. This process is upregulated by the pro-apoptotic proteins
  such as Bax, Bak, Bid and downregulated by anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2,
  Bcl-xL. Caspase-9 was regulated by shikonin, and caspase-3 was controlled by shikonin,
  phyllanthin, arabinoxylan, Galla Rhois, atractylon, and psoralidin. Bax was upregulated
  by phyllanthin, atractylon, and psoralidin, and p53 was controlled by phyllanthin
  and arabinoxylan. Moreover, Bcl-2 was downregulated by bear bile powder, dieckol,
  phyllanthin, arabinoxylan, Galla Rhois, atractylon, psoralidin, ursolic acid, and
  coenzyme Q10. The mechanisms of natural products affecting the apoptosis pathway
  were indicated. The upregulations of the molecules were marked with a green arrow
  and the downregulations with a red arrow.
