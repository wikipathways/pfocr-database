caption: Proposed mechanisms of the reduced activation of G3139 in RIT-INPs. The recognition
  of G3139 by TLR9 mainly in late endosomes activates NF-κB pathway due to the CpG
  motifs in the G3139 sequence, thereby up-regulating its downstream target antiapoptotic
  proteins and inducing cytokine release. We present a new strategy of using INPs
  to control endosomal compartmentalization of ONs using the preserved signaling from
  antibodies on INPs. The early endosomal retention of liposomal nanoparticles and
  the cross-linking effect of rituximab lead to the reduced activation of G3139 in
  RIT-INPs, thus enhancing their gene-silencing effects in leukemic cells in vitro
  and in vivo.
