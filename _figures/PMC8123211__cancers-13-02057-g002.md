caption: The association of PARPs with tumor cell invasion. Tumor cell invasion begins
  with EMT, a phenotypic transformation of the tumor cells. PARPs can have opposing
  effects on EMT. The Hippo pathway suppresses metastasis initiation by regulating
  the transcription factor, YAP, through the AMOT protein family members. TNKS1 and
  TNKS2 inactivate the AMOT proteins in a manner similar to their effect on AXIN,
  allowing the accumulation, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional engagement
  of YAP. PARP-1 interacts with HOXB7, another EMT-promoting transcription factor,
  and reduces its transcriptional activity. PARylation of Smad proteins by PARP-1
  and -2 hinders TGF-β signaling. The PARPs are also involved in restructuring the
  ECM, which is necessary for the growth and dissociation of a tumor. Upregulation
  of PARP-1 has been connected to the transcriptional induction of MMP2 and 9 and
  the downregulation of TIMP. These effects are probably achieved through the stimulation
  of NF-κB transcription factors. PARP-1 is involved at multiple levels in the positive
  regulation of SNAIL1, one of the most important transcription factors driving dedifferentiation
  associated with EMT.
