caption: 'Pharmacology of rapid-acting antidepressants in corticomesolimbic brain
  circuits. Preclinical data suggest that ketamine and other rapid-acting antidepressants
  potentiate excitatory synapses in mood-relevant brain regions, potentially reversing
  disease-induced deficits. New treatments may potentiate these connections while
  leaving synapses primarily involved in other brain functions unaltered. (a) The
  principle ketamine metabolic pathway occurs in the liver, resulting first in demethylation
  of ketamine to norketamine, followed by metabolism to the HNKs. The most prominent
  HNK metabolites are (2R,6R)- and (2S,6S)-HNK. (b) Rapid-acting antidepressants potentiate
  glutamatergic synapses. Ketamine, acting as an NMDAR antagonist, may act by preferentially
  blocking NMDARs localized to GABAergic interneurons, resulting in disinhibition
  of glutamatergic neurons and an increase in these neurons’ evoked release of glutamate.
  Ketamine may also act by inhibiting synaptic NMDARs that are activated by spontaneously
  released glutamate or via inhibition of extrasynaptic NMDARs. Alternatively (or
  in addition), ketamine conversion to (2R,6R; 2S,6S)-HNK may result in actions on
  glutamatergic neurons to promote glutamate release and AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated
  excitation. All hypotheses converge on synaptic processes that strengthen excitatory
  synapses, activate cellular plasticity cascades, increase activity of AMPARs, and
  increase connectivity within circuits previously weakened by the pathophysiology
  underlying depression. Alternative approaches that may have the same net effect
  include inhibition of GABAα5Rs, resulting in disinhibition of glutamatergic neurons;
  inhibition of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (not shown), resulting in inhibition
  of GABAergic neurons and disinhibition of glutamatergic neurons; inhibition of mGluR2s,
  resulting in increased probability of glutamate release; and direct activation of
  synaptic AMPARs and NMDARs (via AMPAkines or NMDAR modulators such as GLYX-13).
