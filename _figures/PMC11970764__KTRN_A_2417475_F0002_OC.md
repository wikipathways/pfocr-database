caption: The oxygen dependent regulatory pathway of HIF-1α subunits. During hypoxia,
  HIF-α subunits are imported into the nucleus where they dimerise with HIF-1β and
  recruit transcriptional co-activators. This active transcription complex then transcribes
  genes that enable cells to adapt to HMEs. During normoxia, HIF-α stability is controlled
  by several oxygen-dependent proteins. PHDs hydroxylate HIF-α subunits on specific
  proline residues, which are recognised by the VHL E3 ligase. The VHL poly-ubiquitinates
  the HIF-α subunits, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. ARD-1 aids in this
  process by acetylating a specific lysine on the α-subunits, stabilising their interaction
  with the VHL E3 ligase. FIH-1 is involved in a separate inactivation pathway whereby
  it hydroxylates a specific asparagine residue on the C-TAD domain, preventing the
  interaction of CBP and p300 co-factors
