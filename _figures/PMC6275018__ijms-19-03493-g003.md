caption: Representative model of leptin-induced EMT signaling. In the absence of leptin,
  the transcription factors Twist, Snail, Slug, and β-catenin are phosphorylated at
  specific residues by cytosolic kinases, leading these TFs to their degradation through
  the proteasomal pathway. When leptin binds to the ObRb receptor, signaling cascades
  are activated to promote the phosphorylation of EMT-related TFs and induce their
  translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they regulate the expression
  of EMT-regulators genes.
