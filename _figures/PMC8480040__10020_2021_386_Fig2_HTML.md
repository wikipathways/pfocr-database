caption: Mechanism of H19 regulating osteogenic differentiation. (1) H19 Promotes
  osteoblast differentiation via the TGF-β1/Smad3/HDAC signaling pathway by deriving
  miR-675. (2) H19 regulates the Notch signaling pathway by regulating downstream
  miRNA expression ligands to promote the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs induced
  by BMP9 (3) H19 is the miRNA sponge of miR141 and miR22, which antagonizes the negative
  regulatory effects of two miRNAs on the Wnt/βcatenin pathway. (4) H19 targets DKK4
  to halt its inhibitory effect on the Wnt signaling pathway and osteogenic function.
  (5) miR-138 sponge reduces the expression of PTK2 gene by competitively binding
  with H19, promotes FAK expression, and induces osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.
  (6) H19 promotes the proliferation of osteoblasts by inhibiting the expression of
  p53. (7) The combination of H19 and Foxc2 synergistically promotes the osteogenic
  differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
