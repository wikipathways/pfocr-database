caption: Overview of CREB3L3 regulation and activation. Transcription of Creb3l3 is
  upregulated by fasting through glucocorticoid receptor. Fasting or HFD treatment
  may also modulate activation of CREB3L3. Insulin induces phosphorylation of CREB3L3
  precursor and prevents its cleavage by activating PI3K pathway. Responding to multiple
  metabolic signals, CREB3L3 initiates target genes involved in glucose and lipid
  metabolism.
