caption: Indirect pathway for photosynthetic H2 production. The thylakoid reactions
  (light reactions) use light energy to oxidize H2O and generate ATP and NADPH (a).
  The carbon fixation reactions (Calvin–Benson cycle) use ATP and NADPH to fix CO2
  and generate triose phosphates (G3P) (b). G3P can be stored as starch or transported
  to the cytosol and undergo glycolysis to yield ATP, NADH, and pyruvate (c). Pyruvate
  and NADH are used for light-independent and light-dependent (PSII-independent) H2
  production, respectively (a). Pyruvate can also drive respiration in the mitochondrion
  for ATP synthesis (c). Dotted arrows indicate electron transfer
