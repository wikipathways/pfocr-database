caption: The synthesis and metabolism of l-arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA),
  and l-citrulline. l-arginine has multiple metabolic fates, including metabolism
  by NOS, arginase, and other enzymes. ADMA can compete with l-arginine to reduce
  the synthesis of NO. Both ADMA and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) come from methylated
  l-arginine by protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT). ADMA can be transported
  to other organs or excreted into the urine. Unlike SDMA, only ADMA can be metabolized
  by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH)-1 and -2. Alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase
  2 (AGXT2) can metabolize ADMA as well as SDMA. l-citrulline can be generated by
  NOS, DDAHs, and ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCT). l-citrulline can be used to
  make l-arginine via the argininosuccinate (AS) pathway. ADMA can uncouple NOS to
  produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can induce PRMT and inhibit DDAH activity,
  leading to an increase in ADMA.
