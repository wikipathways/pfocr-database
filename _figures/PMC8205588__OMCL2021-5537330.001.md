caption: 'The main cellular pathways related to ferroptosis and potential targets
  for its manipulation (induction or inhibition). The main regulatory pathway of ferroptosis
  involves the cysteine-GSH-GPX4-lipid peroxide axis. Cysteine is transported into
  the cell via xCT in its oxidized form (cystine). One of the main roles of cysteine
  is the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), a process in which the key-limiting step
  is catalysed by glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL). GSH serves as a cofactor of glutathione
  peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which reduces lipid peroxides to their alcohol form. Alternatively,
  lipid peroxides can be reduced by ubiquinol residing in the membrane compartments
  of the cell. In this way, produced ubiquinone is reduced back to its alcohol form
  by the action of ferroptosis-suppressor protein 1 (FSP1). The central event in the
  lipid peroxide production pathway is the Fenton reaction, a reaction between Fe2+
  and H2O2. The iron is imported into the cell as an iron-loaded transferrin-transferrin
  receptor 1 (TFR1) complex via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the endosome (an
  acidic environment), free Fe3+ is converted to Fe2+ by the transmembrane metalloreductase
  STEAP3 and released into the cytoplasm via the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1).
  Red arrows represent potential activators of ferroptosis: (i) inhibitors of xCT
  (erastin, sulfasalazine), (ii) the inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis and GCL (buthionine
  sulfoximine (BSO)), and (iii) the inhibitor of GPX (Ras-selective lethal 3 (RSL3)).
  Green arrows represent potential ferroptosis inhibitors: (i) alternative source
  of cysteine (N-acetylcysteine (NAC)) and (ii) lipid peroxide scavengers (vitamin
  E, ferrostatin-1). This figure was created using Servier Medical Art templates,
