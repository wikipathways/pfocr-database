caption: A diagram showing the relationship among ischemia, branched-chain amino acids,
  odd-chain fatty acids, and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase metabolism. The inhibitory sites
  of methylmalonic acid on succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in the Kreb’s cycle and the
  electron transport chain are also pictured. Methylmalonic acid and malonate are
  found in brain, inhibit SDH, and can produce brain lesions at high concentrations.
  3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) is an exogenous toxin that inhibits SDH and also produces
  brain lesions. Adashed line is used between ischemia and odd-chain fatty acids to
  indicate a likely but unproven pathway.
