caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of miR‐370‐3p‐containing EVs released
  from breast cancer cells in breast cancer. Highly metastatic breast cancer cell‐derived
  EVs transfer miR‐370‐3p from breast cancer cells to fibroblasts. The transferred
  miR‐370‐ 3p targets CYLD and activates the NF‐ κB signaling pathway, thus stimulating
  the expression of IL‐6, IL‐8, and IL‐1β, promoting the stemness, migration, invasion,
  and EMT of breast cancer cells. Reproduced with permission.81 Copyright 2021, Federation
