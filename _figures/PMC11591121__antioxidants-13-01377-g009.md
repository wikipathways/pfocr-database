caption: 'A mechanism map for linking the microbiota and the metabolites involved
  in the metabolic pathway of enrichment. Abbreviations: BW = body weight; NEFAs =
  non-esterified fatty acids; ROS = reactive oxygen species; G = glucose; CAT = catalase;
  GPx = glutathione peroxidase; IL-1β = interleukin-1β; IL-6 = interleukin-6; TNF-α
  = tumor necrosis factor-alpha; 5-HT = 5-hydroxytryptamine; f5-HK = formyl-5-hydroxykynurenine;
  Butyryl-CoA = butyryl coenzyme A; Acetyl-CoA = acetyl coenzyme A; Trp = tryptophan;
  Val = valine; Leu = leucine; Ile = isoleucine; Phe = phenylalanine; Tyr = tyrosine;
  TCA cycle = tricarboxylic acid cycle. “+” indicates a positive correlation between
  microorganisms and metabolites or other substances, and “−” indicates a negative
  correlation. The blue boxes represent enriched differential metabolic pathways in
  E2 (high dietary energy) vs. E1 (low dietary energy). “  ” represents a positive
  increase, “  ” represents a negative increase, and “  ” represents a negative decrease'
