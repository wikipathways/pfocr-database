caption: 'Role of Central Carbon Metabolism in Promoting Antibiotic Tolerance. Hypoxic
  stress, cholesterol metabolism, glycerol assimilation, low pH, and shunting of the
  TCA cycle via the glyoxylate shunt can each impact antibiotic tolerance of Mtb.
  Hypoxia: Exposure of Mtb to hypoxia leads to decreased levels of phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) and an accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG), both of which lead to an increase
  in drug tolerance. Cholesterol: Cholesterol is catabolized to acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA,
  pyruvate, and propionyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA is detoxified through multiple pathways,
  including assimilation into branched chain lipids, conversion to succinyl-CoA through
  a vitamin B12-dependent pathway, or through the methylcitrate cycle (MCC) in which
  methylisocitrate (2-MIC) is an intermediate. Supplementation with cholesterol, propionate,
  or 2-MIC promotes antibiotic tolerance, and mutant strains that accumulate elevated
  levels of propionyl-CoA or 2-MIC are more tolerant to antibiotics. Glycerol Assimilation:
  Glycerol is assimilated into glycolysis and gluconeogenesis through phosphorylation
  by GlpK. Loss of glycerol catabolism leads to increased drug tolerance, suggesting
  that glycerol assimilation antagonizes antibiotic tolerance. Furthermore, Mtb in
  low pH is unable to efficiently catabolize glycerol, likely due to defects in glycolysis,
  resulting in increased antibiotic tolerance. Glyoxylate Shunt Activity: Mutants
  that lack the glyoxylate shunt are more sensitive to antibiotics, suggesting that
  rerouting carbon through the glyoxylate shunt promotes antibiotic tolerance.'
