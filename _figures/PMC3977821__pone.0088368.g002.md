caption: For exclusive use of the ED pathway for glucose catabolism, the contribution
  of PEP carboxylase resulted in low 13C-enrichment of oxaloacetate (deduced from
  aspartate), whereas the 13C accumulated in pyruvate (alanine), which creates an
  excess of its single-labeled (M1) mass isotopomer (green region). In contrast, the
  action of pyruvate carboxylase reduced and increased the levels of pyruvate and
  oxaloacetate (orange region), respectively. This allowed for discrimination between
  these enzymes according to the combined labeling of the two molecules. Prior to
  inspection, the 13C-labelling data were corrected for the contribution of natural
  isotopes .
