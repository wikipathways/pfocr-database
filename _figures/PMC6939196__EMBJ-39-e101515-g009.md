caption: When the auxin level is low, the IAA33 protein is degraded by a 26S proteasome‐dependent
  mechanism, which leads to a low level of IAA33 protein, and most of the ARFs are
  inhibited by IAA5 and other canonical AUX/IAA proteins. When the auxin level increases,
  auxin induces the phosphorylation activity of MPK14, which then phosphorylated IAA33
  to lead to accumulation of IAA33; meanwhile, canonical AUX/IAA proteins are degraded
  through 26S proteasome‐dependent pathway. The interaction of IAA5 with repressor
  ARFs is competed by increased IAA33 proteins; meanwhile, activator ARFs were also
  de‐repressed because of the degradation of canonical AUX/IAA proteins. Therefore,
  the overall auxin effect on auxin‐mediated gene expression is the combinatorial
  result of multiple levels of regulation. The pink ARFs mean repressor ARFs, and
  brown ARFs represent activator ARFs. The blue IAAs represent canonical AUX/IAA proteins.
