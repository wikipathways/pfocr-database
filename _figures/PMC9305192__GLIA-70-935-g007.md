caption: Translational relevance assessment of gene expression changes at 13 and 90 dpi
  after striatal injection of α‐syn PFFs. The PD map (https://pdmap.uni.lu/minerva/)
  was used to extract pathways from human databases (first 4 columns) and from the
  DEG datasets of this study (two last columns). The percentages in each row give
  the proportion of genes in each pathway that were found as DEGs in each dataset
  that were mapped. There were strong similarities between human PD gene expression
  changes and those found in the α‐syn seeding/spreading model. See main text for
  details
