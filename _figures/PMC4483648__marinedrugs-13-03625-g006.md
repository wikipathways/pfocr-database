caption: Proposed pathway of the major role of RAF1 in LSA-induced PCC. In red are
  the phosphorylation sites induced in response to LSA exposure. Annotations are derived
  from the Kohn molecular interaction map (MIM) conventions []. Nodes at intercepting
  lines are the post-translationally modified proteins. Open arrowhead indicates activation;
  open circles indicate phosphorylations, and short bars inhibition.
