caption: Glucose metabolism in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). High level
  of glycolysis exists in MDSCs in tumor microenvironment (TME), which contributes
  to the accumulation of MDSCs in tumor hosts and the play of immunosuppressive activity.
  As an important product of glycolysis, lactate plays an important role in the TME,
  which can stimulate the immunosuppressive properties of MDSCs. The non-metabolizable
  analogue of glucose, 2-deoxyd-glucose (2-DG), inhibits the production of lactate.
  Oxamate inhibits LDHA directly and thus inhibits the production of lactate. Pyruvate
  was catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to produce acetyl-CoA and enter the
  Krebs cycle. However, in most cancers, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is activated
  and leads to selective inhibition of PDH, resulting in pyruvate being unable to
  enter the TCA cycle and continuing along the glycolytic pathway to eventually convert
  to lactate. Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) is an effective inhibitor of PDK, which can
  promote pyruvate into the TCA cycle and thus reduce the lactate level. Rotenone
  directly inhibited PDH to reduce the production of acetyl-CoA, which indirectly
  promoted the production of lactate. The glycolytic pathway of MDSCs is regulated
  by HIF-1α and enhances the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs through HIF-1α. AMPK
  activation can inhibit HIF-1α.
