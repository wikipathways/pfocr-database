caption: 'cAMP is a universal second messenger. cAMP is generated by transmembrane
  adenylate cyclases (tmACs) linked to and activated by G-protein coupled (GPC) receptors.
  These tmACs stimulate cAMP-signaling in response to extracellular factors. The soluble
  AC (sAC) is modulated by calcium and bicarbonate, and mediates cAMP-signaling in
  response to intracellular signals. Localized cAMP synthesis by the different ACs
  as well as the rapid hydrolysis of cAMP by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) support the
  cAMP microdomain model of action. Accordingly, cAMP triggers downstream events in
  a discrete localized manner, via its two targets: cAMP-dependent protein kinases
  (PKAs) and Exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac). Specific A-kinase anchoring
  proteins (AKAPs) form complex “transduceosomes” by reversibly binding GPC receptors,
  ACs, PDEs, PKAs, Epacs, and other molecules, such as mRNAs of several nuclear-encoded
  mitochondrial proteins. AKAPs provide for efficient and regulated spatiotemporal
  subcellular compartmentalization of cAMP signaling. Targeting the various steps
  within the cAMP-signaling pathway (blue boxes) with specific drugs (yellow boxes),
  will provide a means for regulating protein turnover by the UPP (green boxes), by
  manipulating levels and phosphorylation of its components, such as the ubB gene,
  shuttling factors (p62/sqstm1 and p97), E3 ligases (CHIP, atrogin-1, MuRF-1), and
  subunits of the 26S proteasome. Development of new, more specific and efficient
  agents to modulate cAMP-signaling will have a critical beneficial impact on human
  disease conditions linked to deregulated protein degradation by the UPP.'
