caption: An illustration of the mechanism GTPs adopt to prevent photocarcinogenesis
  via targeting miR-29s-mediated DNA hypermethylation. Exposure to UVB radiation diminishes
  the expression levels of miR-29s and leads to activation of DNMTs and promotes DNA
  hypermethylation, resulting in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and contributing
  to tumor growth. GTPs treatment blocks the UVB-induced damage and restores the expression
  of miR-29s to stop DNA hypermethylation through inhibition of DNMTs. As a parallel
  mechanism, GTPs treatment activates TET enzymes and converts existing 5mC into 5-hmC
  followed by 5fC and 5caC to promote DNA demethylation, which leads to growth inhibition
  by reactivation of silenced tumor suppressors. Red arrows indicate the UVB radiation-regulated
  pathway while green arrows show the GTPs-regulated pathway. DNMT, DNA methyltransferases;
  TET, ten-eleven-translocation; TDG, thymine DNA glycosylase. Parts of the figure
