caption: Functional SNPs in the amino acid biosynthesis pathway of P. trichocarpa
  in three representative genotypes.Distribution of SNPs in three representative genotypes
  which have a low (RGR = 0.04), average (RGR = 7.25), and high (RGR = 42.08) growth
  rate. Metabolite names are shown in blue, gene IDs in black and corresponding enzymes
  in orange. Activating SNPs are marked in green and inactivating SNPs in red, below
  the gene that they feature in. The net fold‐change in flux (increase/decrease) through
  a reaction due to SNPs is given next to it, with a flux increase shown in green
  with an upward arrow and a flux decrease shown in red with a downward arrow. AK,
  aspartate kinase; ASA dehydrogenase, aspartate‐semialdehyde dehydrogenase; dapA,
  4‐hydroxy‐tetrahydrodipicolinate synthase; DAP‐decarboxylase, diaminopimelate decarboxylase;
  HSD, homoserine dehydrogenase; ll‐DAP‐AT, ll‐diaminopimelate aminotransferase.
