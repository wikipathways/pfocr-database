caption: (A) In canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, binding of Wnts (‘Wnt on’) to a receptor
  complex composed of Fzd and LRP family members inhibits the APC/GSK-3β destruction
  complex and blockade of β-catenin (β-cat) by GSK-3β. β-cat then accumulates in the
  cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus where it regulates target gene expression
  with TCF/LEF family of transcription factors. In the absence of Wnt ligand (‘Wnt
  off’), β-cat is targeted for proteolytic degradation by the APC/GSK-3β destruction
  complex. The proteins Norrin and R-spondin (Rspo) are unrelated to Wnt and act as
  Wnt agonists, whereas Dkk1, Wif, and sFRPs act as antagonists. (B) In noncanonical
  Wnt/Ca2+pathway, the binding of Wnts promotes Fzd-mediated activation of G proteins,
  leading to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and consequent activation
  of Ca2+-dependent effector molecules. Several Ca2+-sensitive targets, i.e. PKC,
  CamKII, and calcineurin, have been identified downstream of the Wnt/Ca2+pathway.
  Targets of the Wnt/Ca2+pathway appear to interact with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  at multiple points. Additionally, Fzd receptors in association with Kny, Ror2, or
  Ryk receptors can activate JNK, promoting target gene expression through AP-1. In
  noncanonical Wnt/PCP pathway, the binding of Wnts activates RhoA/B, Cdc42, or Rac1.
  Dvl activates Rac1, which can activate JNK to signal through the NFAT pathway.
