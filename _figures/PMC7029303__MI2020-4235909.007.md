caption: The inflammatory response through the HIF-1α signaling pathway. The inflammatory
  cytokine IL-6 and other inflammatory signals bind with the receptors expressed on
  the immune cells (monocytes, etc.) to activate the downstream signals. In our study,
  the proteins HIF-1α and STAT3 were activated to induce inflammatory response in
  the early phase of sepsis. While, in the late phase of sepsis, the immune checkpoint
  protein PD-L1 expressed on the monocyte membrane was upregulated to generate immunosuppression.
