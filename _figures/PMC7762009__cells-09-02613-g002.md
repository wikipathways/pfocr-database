caption: The balance between H19 and let-7 expression controls the reprogramming of
  non-CSCs into CSCs. (A) Under hypoxic conditions HIF-1α expression is enhanced.
  Combined with the sponging of let-7 by H19, this leads to the enhanced expression
  of PDK1, which will in turn promote glycogenesis and expression of stemness phenotype
  []. (B) In breast and lung cancers, H19 enhances the expression of the reprogramming
  factor LIN28 through the sponging of let-7 and miR-196b respectively [,]. (C) In
  breast cancer, the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway increases miR-146a production,
  which in turn promotes let-7 expression and so, the inhibition of reprogramming
  factors [,].
