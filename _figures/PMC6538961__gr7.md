caption: A Model for cFLIPs-Dependent Lethal Ileitis(A) The complex IIb spontaneously
  forms in IECs overexpressing cFLIPs. As cFLIPs blocks activation of caspase 8, the
  complex IIb evolves into the necrosome, resulting in oligomerization of MLKL and
  subsequent membrane permeabilization.(B) Necroptotic cells of IECs release DAMPs
  that subsequently activate nearby macrophages or dendritic cells, resulting in IL-1β
  production. In addition to the release of DAMPs, IECs in response to IL-1β produce
  CCL20 that recruits CCR6-positive ILC3s into IECs. Recruited IEC3s are activated
  by IL-1β and release IL-22 that acts on IECs, resulting in upregulation of Reg3b,
  Reg3g, Duox2, and Duoxa2. Importantly, aberrantly activated ILC3s induce apoptosis
  of IECs possibly through upregulation of several ROS-producing enzymes. Apoptotic
  IECs might enhance inflammation and further activate ILC3s. Thus blockade of the
  necroptotic pathway and depletion of ILC3s or Il22 suppress lethal ileitis.
