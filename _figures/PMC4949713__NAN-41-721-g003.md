caption: WNT/β‐catenin signalling pathway. (A) In the absence of WNT ligands, β‐catenin
  is trapped in a destruction complex formed by Axin, APC and GSK3β and phosphorylated
  in specific residues encoded by exon 3 of CTNNB1. This results in rapid degradation
  of β‐catenin and, consequentially, the repression of target genes brought about
  by the interaction of TCF/LEF1 with co‐repressors [e.g. groucho (Gro)/TLE family
  members]. (B) Binding of WNT ligands to the Frizzled (FZD) receptors and ist co‐receptors
  LRP leads to the activation of dishevelled (DVL) and recruitment to the cytoplasmic
  membrane of both DVL and Axin. This causes the dysruption of the destruction complex,
  releasing β‐catenin, which cannot be efficiently phosphorylated or degraded. The
  stabilisation of β‐catenin results in increased cytoplasmic protein levels and eventually
  nuclear translocation, where its interaction with TCF/LEF1 factors mediates the
  expression of target genes oft he pathway. (C) Expression of a stable form of β‐catenin
  lacking the amino acids encoded by exon 3 of CTNNB1 (small red circle in BCAT) results
  in protein stabilisation as mutant β‐catenin cannot be properly phosphorylated or
  degraded. This causes the activation of the WNT/β‐catenin pathway in a cell‐autonomous
  manner in the absence of WNT ligands. (Figure courtesy of Dr C. L. Andoniadou.)
