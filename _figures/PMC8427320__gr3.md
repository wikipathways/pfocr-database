caption: Proposed mechanisms behind the anticancer activities of CO released from
  CO-RMs. The anticancer actions of CO-RMs is mainly associated with the inhibition
  of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion and metastasis as well as the
  induction of apoptosis. As mitochondria and NADPH oxidase, which are known the major
  sources of intracellular ROS, have been implicated as the targets of CO action,
  ROS seem likely to play important roles in the signaling pathways by which CO-RMs
  exert their actions. While CO may downregulate the ROS generation to inhibit different
  pro-tumorigenic pathways, CO at higher concentrations can increase the levels of
  ROS to induce the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway. Thus, CO-RMs can take
  advantages of both sides of ROS to provide therapeutic benefits in specific scenario.
  Moreover, CO-RMs may also act as promising candidates that target the cancer metabolic
  reprogramming by eliciting anti-Warburg effect.
