caption: 'RAS Network: cross-links in hypertrophy. The cardiac hypertrophic response
  implicates signal transduction pathways initiated by ligand-stimulated membrane-bound
  receptors (RTKs, GPCRs) and biomechanical stress sensors (integrins). Various signaling
  effectors interact with the RAS/MEK/MAPK pathway. GPCR receptors activate RAS proteins
  through EPAC, induce release of internal Ca2+ stores and elicit pathological hypertrophy
  through calcineurin/NFAT. GPCRs also act through ERK activation. GSK3 kinase negatively
  regulates NFAT and, in turn, is inactivated by the PI3K-AKT pathway stimulated by
  RAS. Stimuli acting on integrins prompt cardiac hypertrophy through FAK activation
  and considerable cross-talk with RTK-mediated signaling. In addition, PAK regulates
  RAF1 activity. All these pathways converge on the modulation of transcriptional
  factors (MEF2, JUN and GATA4), which induce the expression of genes of the hypertrophic
  program.'
