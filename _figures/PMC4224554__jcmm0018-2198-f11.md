caption: Proposed pathway of the antioxidative effects of AST through the mitochondrion-mediated
  signalling pathway of apoptosis. H2O2 or BLM induces ROS formation, which results
  in DNA damage and leads to apoptosis. AST decreases ROS formation and blocks H2O2-
  or BLM-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the translocation of Bad and Bax to the mitochondria
  and that of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL to the cytosol. This phenomenon decreases the expression
  of Puma and increases the expression of MMP, subsequently inhibiting the release
  of pro-apoptosis molecules causing caspase activation, which leads to apoptosis.
