caption: TNFR1 is activated either by mTNF-α or sTNF-α and recruits TRADD, RIPK1,
  TRAF2 and cIAP1/2, forming Complex I. cIAP1/2 ubiquitinates RIPK1 creating a platform
  for the recruitment of TAB2/3 and TAK1 which, in turn, activate JNK, AP-1 and p38
  resulting in cell survival and activates NIK, which triggers NF-kB activation promoting
  inflammation. When RIPK1 is deubiquitinated, cell death is triggered either through
  apoptosis, which is activated by the formation of the FADD/pro-caspase 8 complex,
  or through necroptosis, which is induced by the interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3.
  TNFR2 is activated by mTNF-α and recruits TRAF2 and cIAP1/2 and, in this way, activates
  the noncanonical NF-kB pathway and cell proliferation. TNFR2 also activates Etk/Bmx,
  which, by forming a complex with VEGFR2, activates the PI3K/Akt/STAT5 axis
