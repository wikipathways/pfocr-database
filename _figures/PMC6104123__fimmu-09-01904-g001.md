caption: 'TGF-β induces CD103 expression in tumor-specific T cells and participates
  in integrin bidirectional signaling. Left: TGF-β controls CD103 expression in tumor
  antigen (Ag)-specific T cells upon interaction of T-cell receptor (TCR) with specific
  tumor peptide–major histocompatibility complex class I complexes, via a Smad-dependent
  pathway. TGF-β binds to TGFBR at the surface of CD8+ T lymphocytes and leads to
  recruitment and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 and their subsequent nuclear
  translocation. Transcription factors NFAT-1, translocated into the nucleus upon
  TCR engagement, and Smad2/3 bind to promoter and enhancer elements of the ITGAE
  gene, which encodes the CD103 (αE) subunit, and activates CD103 expression (). Right:
  TGF-β participates in CD103 intracellular signaling via a non-Smad-dependent pathway.
  Interaction of TGF-β with TGFBR on CD8+CD103+ TRM cells induces recruitment and
  phosphorylation of integrin-linked kinase (ILK). Phosphorylated (P)-ILK interacts
  with the CD103 subunit intracellular domain, resulting in phosphorylation of protein
  kinase B/AKT and initiating integrin inside-out signaling leading to activation
  of CD103 (). CD103-E-cadherin tight adhesion initiates an outside-in signal by promoting
  phosphorylation of paxillin (Pax) and Pyk2, and subsequent binding of phosphorylated-paxillin
  to the αE subunit tail where a phosphorylatable Ser (S) in the ES1163IRKAQL motif
  plays an important role (). Adhesive interaction of E-cadherin with CD103 also triggers
  activation of PI3K/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phospholipase
  C/PKC pathways (), providing intracellular signals that promote CD8+ TRM effector
  functions, including actin cytoskeleton reorganization, T-cell spreading and migration,
  cytokine release and polarized exocytosis of cytotoxic granules leading to target
  cell destruction.'
