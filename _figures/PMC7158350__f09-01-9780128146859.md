caption: Roles of DEAD/DEAH box helicases in innate immune signaling pathways. Note
  that the signaling pathways have been simplified to place the focus on DEAD/DEAH-box
  proteins and their immediate interaction with other proteins. For that reason, many
  signaling proteins were omitted and some differences between different pathways
  were not considered. MyD88 signaling utilizes a very distinctive pathway that is
  not shown in the figure. Instead, MyD88 was connected to other pathways because
  it also results in activation of IRF7 and NF-κB.
