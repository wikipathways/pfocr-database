caption: Schematic of signaling pathways of TLRs. Most TLRs with the exception of
  TLR3 initiate a MyD88-dependent pathway as shown in the left part. With the cooperation
  of Mal/TIRAP, TLR4 induces the MyD88–IRAK4 complex to recruit IRAK1 and IRAK2, which
  then interact with and induces K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6 and TAK1/TAB2/TAB3
  complexes. Activated TAK1 subsequently induce phosphorylation and activation of
  MAPKs and the IKK complex consisting of IKKα, IKKβ and K63-polyubiquitinated NEMO,
  finally promoting activation of AP-1 and NF-κB, and production of proinflammatory
  cytokines. TLR7 and TLR9 induces MyD88 activation to recruit signaling complex formed
  by IRAK4, TRAF6 and TRAF3, which induces phosphorylation and activation of IRF7
  and production of type I IFN. Meanwhile, TLR3 and internalized TLR4 activate TRIF-dependent
  signaling as shown in the right part. TRAM is needed for the interaction between
  TLR4 and TRIF. TRIF recruits TRAF6 and RIP1, which induces downstream activation
  MAP kinases and NF-κB, similar to the MyD88-dependent pathway. TRIF also activates
  that TRAF3/TBK1/IKKɛ axis to promote IRF3-dependent expression of type I IFN.
