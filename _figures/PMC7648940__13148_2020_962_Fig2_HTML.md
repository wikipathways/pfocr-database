caption: HDACis affect signalling pathways and oncogenes in PTCL. HDACI-mediated c-FLIP
  downregulation was related to NF-Κb members P50 inactivation via interrupting p50
  interaction with c-FLIP. HDACIs inactivated P50 through inhibiting HDAC1.Romidepsin、chidamide
  downregulates (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) pathway by decreasing the phosphorylation of the p85
  regulatory subunit of PI3K, which correlates with the observed decrease in the phosphorylation
  status of AKT. Histone acetyltransferase p300–mediated Stat3 acetylation on Lys685,STAT3
  acetylation mediates the STAT3–DNMT1 interaction to regulate tumour suppressor gene
  promoter methylation. Acetylated STAT3 mediates epigenetic tumour suppressor gene
  (TSG) silencing, SHP-1. Notch3 intracellular domain (N3IC) is acetylated and deacetylated
  at lysines 1692 and 1731 by p300 and HDAC1, this modification reduces Notch3 protein
  stability. HDACi trichostatin (TSA) promotes N3IC acetylation ,leading to N3IC proteasomal
  degradation and downregulating N3IC-triggered signalling. downstream of the pathway
  pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes are affected
