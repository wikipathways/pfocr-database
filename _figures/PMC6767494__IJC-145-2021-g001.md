caption: Management of cancer by fecal microbiota transplant. FMT represents a potential
  therapeutic strategy for cancer by reconstruction of intestinal microbiota, amelioration
  of bile acid metabolism and modulation of immunotherapy efficacy. Various factors
  such as host genetics, diet, antibiotics and stress could lead to alterations of
  gut microbiota, named as gut dysbiosis. Microbial dysbiosis and special bacteria
  in the gut are capable of affecting cancer development and progression via activating
  tumorigenic pathway, inducing inflammation and damaging host DNA. Special bacterial
  products, such as FadA toxin from Fusobacterium nucleatum, CagA protein from Helicobacter
  pylori, AvrA protein from S. enterica Typhi, and BFT from Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides
  fragilis can promote the separation of β‐catenin from E‐cadherin, which can trigger
  β‐catenin activation and contribute to tumorigenesis. The beneficial component in
  bacterial metabolites, such as SCFAs, is also decreased in microbial dysbiosis.
  Intestinal dysbiosis may be conducive to bacterial translocation, exerting pro‐inflammatory
  effects, which is mediated by MAMPs that activate TLRs in macrophages and dendritic
  cells. TLR signaling promotes the expression of the pro‐inflammatory factors, including
  IL‐23, TNF and IL‐1, thereby promoting carcinogenesis. Several microbial metabolites
  can directly or indirectly damage host DNA, fueling carcinogenesis. Special microbial
  toxins (CDT and colibactin) could directly induce DNA damage. Furthermore, gut bacteria
  also damage DNA indirectly via polyamines, DCA, ROS, RNS and H2S. FMT, fecal microbiota
