caption: The mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) are areas of close interaction
  between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The MAMs are the sites
  at which mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) and the NOD-, LRR- and
  pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome localize and they serve as a Ca2+
  store to maintain mitochondrial calcium concentrations. MAVS interacts with retinoic
  acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) that have sensed viral RNA.
  The MAVS–RLR complex is then able to initiate signalling to induce expression of
  cytokines and theoretically promote increased glycolytic flux to support dendritic
  cell (DC) activation and type I interferon (IFN) responses (indicated by the dashed
  arrows). MAVS–RLR signalling is dependent on active mitochondria with a high mitochondrial
  membrane potential (Δψm) and reciprocally serves to promote mitochondrial expansion.
  NLRP3 is sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are produced by the electron
  transport chain (ETC) and also senses ATP-driven decreases in intracellular potassium
  concentrations. Once activated, NLRP3 activates caspase 1, which is able to cleave
  and thereby activate the pro-forms of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. Increased
  ROS production can be promoted by Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1), TLR2 and TLR4 signalling
  through the activation of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6),
  which relocates to the mitochondria. There, in conjunction with evolutionarily conserved
  signalling intermediate in Toll pathway (ECSIT), TRAF6 promotes ROS production by
  the ETC. IKKε, inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase subunit-ε; IRF, IFN-regulatory
