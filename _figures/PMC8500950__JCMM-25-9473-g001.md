caption: 'Smoking increases oral mucosa susceptibility to Candida albicans infection
  via the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, which in turn negatively regulates the NLRP3
  inflammasome: a proposed model in oral epithelial cells. In response to oxidative
  stress generated by smoking, Nrf2 is phosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus
  allowing the activation of the expression/activity of its target antioxidant proteins,
  including NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone‐1 (NQO‐1), haem‐oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1) and superoxide
  dismutase (SOD). Importantly, although some studies have described the role of ROS
  and NQO‐1 in regulating the interaction between Nrf2 and NLRP3, the specific molecular
  mechanism of this antagonistic relationship remains unclear'
