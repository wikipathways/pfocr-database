caption: Role of IL-1 cytokine family members in the immunological history of the
  hepatocarcinoma. (A) IL-1β cytokine and trained immunity in initiation of hepatocarcinoma
  transformation. Trained immunity induced by metabolic syndrome or HFD/NAFLD leads
  to low-grade inflammation linked to IL-1β and other cytokine (as TNF-α) production.
  These cytokines induce hepatic fibrosis, exposing hepatocytes to moderate hypoxia.
  HIF-1α accumulation up-regulates IL-1β secretion in TAM/KC. Locally produced IL-1β
  induces or enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells. At that time,
  iNKT cells and CD8 T-cells maintain the immunosurveillance of the HCC. (B) IL-37
  driven-suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocytes and transformed hepatocytes
  produce IL-37, a cytokine with several cell targets. IL-37 suppresses hepatocellular
  carcinoma growth by converting pSmad3 signaling from JNK/pSmad3L/c-Myc oncogenic
  signaling into pSmad3C/P21 tumor-suppressive signaling. IL-37 inhibits the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway, inducing autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. IL-37 recruits cytotoxic
  anti-tumoral NK cells harboring the terminal differentiation marker CD57. At that
  time, IL-33 neosynthesis by hepatocarcinoma cells and hepatocytes could maintain
  the immunosurveillance by maintaining iNKT1 cell and T CD8 T-cell activation. (C)
  Immunosurveillance failure at the end-stage HCC. Sustained IL-33 production by tumoral
  cells can recruit Treg lymphocytes and promote development of iNKT2 CD4(+) cells,
  both leading to anti-tumoral immunosurveillance failure. Areg, Amphiregulin; EMT,
  epithelial-mesenchymal transition; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; KC, Kupffer cells;
  TAM, tumor-associated macrophages; bounded arrows, presumably yes.
