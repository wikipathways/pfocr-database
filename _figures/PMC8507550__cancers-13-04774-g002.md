caption: Schematic representation of the Hedgehog pathway and its functions in CCA.
  The HH signaling regulates growth, survival, stemness, and invasiveness in cholangiocarcinoma
  cells. HH pathway antagonists used in CCA preclinical studies are acting at the
  level of SHH (5E1 anti-SHH antibody), SMO (vismodegib, cyclopamine, BMS-833923),
  and the GLI (GANT61). They have been tested alone or in combination with other targeted
  molecules (U0126) or with chemotherapeutic drugs (gemcitabine, cisplatin) in vitro
  and in vivo. Proteins that are illustrated as HH downstream targets have been demonstrated
  to be modulated directly by transcriptional binding of GLI (DR4, PLK2) or as a final
  effect of the pharmacological inhibition of the HH cascade in CCA cells.
