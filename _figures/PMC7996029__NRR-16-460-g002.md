caption: 'Potential mechanisms of cAMP elevation on neuronal regeneration: promoting
  growth and overcoming inhibition.The effect of elevated cAMP activity on axonal
  regeneration was previously hypothesised to occur in two phases; a transcription-independent
  phase, which covers the first 7 days of regeneration post-spinal cord injury, and
  a transcription-dependent phase that takes over after 7 days post-injury (Batty
  et al., 2017). The transcription-independent phase is thought to be regulated by
  PKA, acting through inhibition of Rho GTPase (Bandtlow, 2003). Rho/ROCK signaling
  was found to mediate the inhibitory effects on axonal growth of extracellular matrix
  proteins such as CSPGs and heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs), and inhibition
  of the Rho/ROCK pathway was reported to improve axonal regeneration (McKerracher
  and Higuchi, 2006). Of note, Rho/ROCK signaling is also inhibited by Epac (Boomkamp
  et al., 2014). The transcription-dependent phase is conceived to be mediated by
  cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), activated beforehand by PKA, which
  enhances transcription of arginase I (ArgI), interleukin-6 (IL-6), metallothionein
  (MT-I/II) and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) (Siddiq and Hannila,
  2015). However, Epac/Rap1 activates the B-raf/ERK pathway (Vossler et al., 1997)
  that also results in phosphorylation of CREB (Grewal et al., 2000) and transcription
  of ArgI as well as other polyamines that support axonal growth. Moreover, as Epac/Rap1
  also activates Akt, it can potentially trigger the Akt/mTOR pathway, which was found
  to induce disinhibition of axonal growth, initiation of regeneration and maintenance
  of a regenerative state in retinal ganglion cells after inflammatory stimulation
  (Leibinger et al., 2012). AMP: Adenosine monophosphate; cAMP: cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate;
  CNGC: cyclic nucleotide gated channel; Epac: exchange protein directly activated
  by cAMP; ERK: extracellular signal-related kinase; LAR: leukocyte common antigen-related
  phosphatase; LINGO 1: immunoglobin-like domain-containing protein 1; MAIs: myelin
  associated inhibitors; MEK: MAP kinase/ERK kinase; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin;
  NgR: Nogo receptor; PKA: protein kinase A; PTPσ: transmembrane protein tyrosine
  phosphatase; Rap1: Ras-proximate-1; ROCK: Rho-associated kinase.'
