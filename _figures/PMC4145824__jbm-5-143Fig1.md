caption: 'Inhibitory effects of pacritinib in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3)
  and Janus kinase (JAK)—signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway.Notes:
  (a) The FLT3 receptor is composed of five extracellularimmunoglobulin-like domains,
  a transmembrane domain (TM), a juxtamembrane domain (JM) and a tyrosine-kinase domain
  consisting of 2 domains that are connected by a tyrosine-kinase insert. FLT3 with
  internal tandem duplication (ITD) or mutation (MUT) is activated independently of
  ligands at the cell surface. FLT3-ITD mutations, as well as TKD mutations, result
  in the constitutive activation of FLT3 kinase and its downstream proliferative signaling
  pathways, including the RAS/MAPK kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK) pathway and PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, and in contrast to wild-type FLT3
  signaling, FLT3-ITD potently activates the STAT5 pathway inducing expression of
  genes that are important for cell growth. Pacritinb inhibits FLT3, FLT3-ITD and
  FLT3D835Y mutant blocking the downstream effects of this pathway. (b) The Janus
  kinase (JAK)—signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is
  also depicted. The JAK2 receptor is activated by a signal from cytokines or growth
  factors. Activation of JAK2 leads to phosphorylation of STAT proteins, allowing
  for dimerization of the STAT, which then migrate into the cytoplasm and translocate
  into the nucleus, allowing for transcription of their target genes. Pacritinib inhibits
  JAK2, both wild type and mutant forms blocking this pathway as well.'
