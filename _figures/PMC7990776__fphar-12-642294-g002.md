caption: 'BRD4 in innate immunity. BRD4 can sense and orchestrate different PRR-mediated
  innate immunity through transcriptional regulation. First, upon pathogen infection
  (e.g., bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses), BRD4 regulates the activation of
  different TLR-mediated NF-κB pathways through promoting the phosphorylation of RELA
  at Ser276 and its acetylation at Lys310. In addition, BRD4 recruits CycT1 and CDK9
  (also known as P-TEFb) to the promoters of target genes which can phosphorylate
  RNA pol II at serine 2 and 5, thereby initiating gene transcriptional machinery.
  Second, BRD4 can promote or inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome pathway
  through transcriptional regulation of NRLP3 and CASP1 in a RELA-dependent manner.
  BRD4-mediated NLRP3 expression in innate immunity is context dependent. Third, cytoplasmic
  DNA derived from viruses and dead cells activates CGAS and produces endogenous cyclic
  dinucleotide cGAMP, which further binds to STING1 located in the endoplasmic reticulum,
  then induces the dimerization and translocation of STING1 from the ER to the perinuclear
  region. During trafficking, STING1 recruits and activates TBK1, stimulates the phosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation of IRF3, and to a lesser extent NFKB1, which leads to
  the production of type 1 IFN and other inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF and IL6).;
