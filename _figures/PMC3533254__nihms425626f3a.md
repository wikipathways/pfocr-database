caption: 'A. Factors affecting absorption and distribution of drugs. B. Components
  of the blood–brain barrier. Diagram of a cerebral capillary enclosed in astrocyte
  end-feet. Characteristics of the blood–brain barrier are indicated: (1) tight junctions
  that seal the pathway between the capillary (endothelial) cells; ii) the lipid nature
  of the cell membranes of the capillary wall that makes them a barrier to water-soluble
  molecules; (3i), (4) and (5) represent some of the carriers and ion channels; (6)
  the ‘enzymatic barrier’ that removes molecules from the blood; and vii) the efflux
  pumps that extrude fat-soluble molecules that have crossed into the cells. From
