caption: Induction of nuclear factor-activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) in osteoclasts.
  Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) induces the
  NFATc1 gene via the NF-κB and c-Fos signaling pathway. Cooperation between RANKL
  and the costimulatory signals for receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) synergistically
  activates phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and calcium signaling, which are critical for
  NFATc1 induction and activation. Activation of calcium signaling leads to the recruitment
  of NFATc1 to its own promoter for the robust induction of NFATc1. In contrast, RANKL
  downregulates anti-osteoclastogenic genes such as interferon regulatory factor 8
  (IRF8), V-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B (MafB), inhibitors
  of differentiation (Ids) and LIM homeobox 2 (Lhx2), which inhibit NFATc1 expression
  mediated by RANKL. RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) ligand;

    Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) induces the
