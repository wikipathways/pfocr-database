caption: Proteins are translocated directly from the ribosome into the ER and protein
  folding takes place with the help of specific chaperones. If folding is correct,
  the proteins follow their path to the Golgi complex and the secretory pathway. If
  misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen, the UPR can be triggered and signals
  will be sent to the nucleus and apoptosis could be induced through CHOP. All the
  proteins represented in the cartoon are significantly upregulated by doxycycline
  treatment.
