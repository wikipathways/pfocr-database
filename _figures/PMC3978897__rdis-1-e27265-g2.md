caption: Figure 2. Metabolic crosstalk between the mouse brain, adipose tissue, and
  liver. Pathway members in red represent biomolecules circulating in the blood and
  members in blue represent circulating hormones. Loss of insulin sensitivity increases
  lipolysis in adipose tissue, resulting in the breakdown of stored triglycerides
  to glycerol and free fatty acids and the release of adipokine signaling molecules,
  which act on the brain. The increased circulating pool of free fatty acids is taken
  into the liver, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA and then converted either to
  triglycerides (stored in lipid droplets) or cholesterol, which is released into
  the blood. Meanwhile, circulating glucose is taken up by the brain for energy. Glucose
  absorbed by the brain can also be converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters into the
  cholesterol pathway and is eventually converted to HMG-CoA, squalene, and finally,
  cholesterol.
