caption: Canonical and non-canonical activation of NLRP3. NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin
  domain-containing 3) needs additional cofactors for the processing of interleukin-1β
  (IL-1β). MyD88/IRAK1/IRAK4 or TRIF activates TRAF6, which, in turn, catalyze the
  formation of a K63-linked polyubiquitin chain on TRAF6, itself. The polyubiquitin
  chain acts as a scaffold, recruiting TAK1 and its binding proteins, which, in turn,
  leads to IKK-α/β activation. Activated IKKα/β specifically phosphorylates IkBα,
  resulting in IkBα degradation and NF-kB translocation into the nucleus. TRIF can
  also recruit TRAF3 to activate TBK1 and IKKi. TBK1/IKKi directly phosphorylates
  IRF3/7 to activate type IFN I signaling pathway. Various molecules positively (green
  arrow) or negatively (red blunt arrow) regulate TLR-induced signaling pathways.
  TAK1 (transforming growth factor 1 activating kinase) restrains both NLRP3 priming
  and activation. TAK1 activity restricts NLRP3 priming by limiting spontaneous activation
  of receptor protein kinase 1 (RIP1). MyD88- myeloid differentiation primary response
