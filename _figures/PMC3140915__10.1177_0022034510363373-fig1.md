caption: 'Simplified schematic of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (Left) In the
  absence of a WNT ligand, cytoplasmic β-catenin is associated with APC and Axin,
  phosphorylated by GSK3β and CKI, and polyubiquitinated by the βTRCP complex, targeting
  it for proteosomal degradation; under these conditions, LEF/TCF transcription factors
  in the nucleus associate with transcriptional co-repressors, such as Groucho, and
  the transcription of Wnt target genes is repressed. (Right) In the presence of a
  WNT ligand, phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin are inhibited, allowing
  it to accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate into the nucleus. Nuclear β-catenin
  interacts with LEF/TCF family transcription factors and several other transcriptional
  co-activators to initiate transcription of target genes. Abbreviations: FZD, Frizzled;
  LRP, low-density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein; APC, adenomatous polyposis
  coli; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; CKI, casein kinase I; DSH, Disheveled; LEF/TCF,
  Lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor.'
