caption: There are three major possible mechanisms of ALI complicated by AAD. (1)
  AngII could trigger overexpression of MCP-1 in PMVECs by activating NF-κB signaling
  pathway. MCP-1 plays a great role in the recruitment of macrophages in lung tissues,
  and MMP-9 derived from macrophages could induce the degradation of extracellular
  matrix and vascular basilar membrane; (2) AngII could induce the apoptosis of PMVECs
  through activating the caspase-3, up-regulating the expression of Bax and down-regulating
  the expression of Bcl-2; (3) AngII could trigger endothelial barrier injury, which
  may be related to the dephosphorylation of Y685-VE-cadherin and the endothelial
  skeletal rearrangement. AngII angiotensin II, MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1,
