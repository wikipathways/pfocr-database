caption: 'Role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cancer. Tumors frequently
  encounter extrinsic stresses that compromise protein folding in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), including hypoxia, glucose deprivation, lactic acidosis, oxidative
  stress, and inadequate amino acid supplies. Moreover, intrinsic stresses, such as
  oncogene activation, changes in chromosomal number, and increased glycolysis, can
  all lead to an upregulation in protein translation and additional demands on the
  secretory pathway. Furthermore, genomic instability and somatic mutations in client
  proteins of the secretory pathway can cripple their folding and lead to ER stress.
  In response to an accumulation of ER misfolded proteins, the UPR is initiated by
  three transmembrane ER proteins: inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α; also known
  as ERN1), PRK-like ER kinase (PERK; also known as EIF2AK3), and activating transcription
  factor (ATF) 6α. At low levels of ER stress, the bifunctional IRE1α kinase/RNase
  dimerizes/tetramerizes to cleave a nonconventional intron from XBP1 mRNA, which
  upon religation encodes the XBP1s transcription that upregulates ER protein-folding
  and quality control components to promote adaptation. However, if hyperactivated
  by sustained ER stress, IRE1α oligomerizes, and its relaxed RNase activity endonucleolytically
  degrades many mRNAs, a process called regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD), at
  the ER membrane to cause cell death. PERK signaling downregulates Cap-dependent
  protein translation through phosphorylation of eIF2α, while upregulating the expression
  of the ATF4. In the presence of misfolded proteins, ATF6α translocates to the Golgi
  and is cleaved by the site 1 and site 2 proteases to release the p50 ATF6(N) transcription
  factor into the cytoplasm before migrating to the nucleus. Together with XBP1s,
  ATF6(N) increases transcription of targets that expand ER size and increase its
  protein-folding capacity, as well as that of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD)
  pathway. The combined outputs of the UPR can influence tumor growth at many levels,
  including cell survival, angiogenesis, inflammation, antigen presentation, invasion,
  and metastasis. [Adapted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature Immunology
