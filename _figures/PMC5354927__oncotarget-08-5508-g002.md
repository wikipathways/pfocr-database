caption: A. GR mistakenly recognizes GAS5 as its DNA target, leading to GR sink. B.
  As a molecular sponge, GAS5 inhibits miR21 mediated mRNA degradation of some tumor
  suppressors. C. XIST indirectly recruits HDAC3, stopping its disturbing PHLPP1 transcription.
  PHLPP1 functions to dephosphorylate pAKT. D. XIST, derived from the X inactivation
  center (XIC) at one of two X chromosomes, spreads along the X chromosome and eventually
  silences it. In cancer-related inflammation, lncRNA NKILA could be repressed by
  miR-103/107 so that it fails to cover the phosphorylation site of IkB. Thus IkBa
  is phosphorylated and degraded, which activate NF-kB pathway.
