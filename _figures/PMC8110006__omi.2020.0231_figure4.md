caption: Possible competition mechanism between WIF1 and CRNDE to inhibit or activate
  WNT2 and WNT3. With the upregulation of HOTAIR and its inability to silence WIF1,
  there may be a mutation in the WIF1 promoter that prevents the recognition of WIF1
  by HOTAIR, which is observed in this dataset. That would subsequently cause an upregulation
  of WIF1, which would inhibit its targets, WNT2 and WNT3. WNT2 and WNT3 and its associated
  lncRNA CRNDE are upregulated. There may be a competition between WIF1, CRNDE, and
  SFRP4. CRNDE is known to positively regulate WNT2 and WNT3 and negatively regulate
  SFRP4. SFRP4 is known to inhibit WNT2 and WNT3. With the upregulation of HOTAIR,
  WIF1, WNT2, WNT3, CRNDE, and SFRP4, and the Wnt pathway, CRNDE may be competing
  with WIF1 to positively regulate WNT2 and WNT3 and the SNP in SFRP4 may be the reason
  that CRNDE is preventing the inhibition action of SFRP4 and subsequently the Wnt
  pathway. The x's indicates this gene contains an SNP found in IGV. WIF1—WIF1-S1
  (rs7301320); SFRP4—SFRP4-M1 (rs1802073), SFRP4-3 (rs1052981), SFRP4-S1 (rs1132553),
  SFRP4-S2 (rs1132552). CRNDE, colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed; SFRP4,
  secreted frizzled-related protein 4.
