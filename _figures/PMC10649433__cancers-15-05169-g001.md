caption: 'The estrogen receptor: signaling, treatment, and resistance. Androgens are
  the starting point of the estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathway, quickly converted
  to estrogens by aromatase. This conversion is the target of aromatase inhibitors
  (AIs), which prevent the synthesis of estrogen. In absence of AIs, estrogens bind
  to the receptor, activating the recruitment of coactivators. Selective estrogen
  receptor downregulators (SERDs) block the binding of estrogen to the receptor, while
  selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) block the coactivator recruitment.
  Those three endocrine therapies (ETs) effectively block the ER-driven transcription.
  However, in cases of mutations on the ESR1 gene, which codes for ERs, estrogens,
  SERMs, and SERDs are unable to bind to the receptor. The activating mutations change
  the receptor to an apo conformation and allow ligand-independent transcription.
  Novel therapies were developed to respond to ESR1-driven ET resistance. Complete
  estrogen receptor antagonists (CERANs) bind to the receptor in place of estrogen
  and lead to its degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) after DNA binding,
  while proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) induce degradation by UPS before
  DNA binding. Finally, selective estrogen receptor covalent antagonists (SERCAs)
  block the transcription by covalently binding to the specific ESR1 residue C530.'
