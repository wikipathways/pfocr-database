caption: 'The potential role of red blood cell dynamics and iron homeostasis in the
  clinical presentation of COVID-19. The figure shows two potential pathways through
  which iron metabolism may be involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Pathway
  1: the virus inflicts hypoxia via direct deleterious effects on the respiratory
  system, altering the inflammatory response leading to anemia. Pathway 2: the innate
  immune system may aim to decrease the bioavailability of iron in order to prevent
  an expanding viral load in the acute-phase of the infection. This leads to the activation
  of hepcidin, sequestration of iron within cells, increased levels of ferritin and
  decreased hemoglobin, culminating in hypoxia'
