caption: 'Metabolic scheme of ectoine, glutamate and proline synthesis and catabolism
  inferred from the Nitrosopumilus genomes. Enzymes for each pathway are represented
  as oval shapes and color-coded according to their occurrence in all species (white
  font), or only in RSA3 and AR2 (yellow font). Gray dashed arrows highlight pathways
  that are absent in all Nitrosopumilus species. AAT, aspartate aminotransferase;
  ADH, aspartate dehydrogenase; AOAT, acetylornithine aminotransferase; AsK, aspartate
  kinase; AsADH, aspartyl-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase;
  GS, glutamine synthetase; γ-GK, acetylyglutamate kinase; γ-GPR, N-acetyl-γ-glutamyl
  phosphate reductase; EctA, L-2,4-diaminobutyrate acetyltransferase; EctB, L-2,4-diaminobutyrate
  transaminase; EctC, ectoine synthase; EctD, ectoine hydrolase; DoeA, ectoine hydrolase;
  DoeB, Nα-acetly-L-2,4-diaminobutyrate deacetylase; P5CDH, 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  dehydrogenase; PRODH, proline dehydrogenase. Other enzymes shown are for pyruvate
  (de)carboxylation, the Tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate
  (3-HP/4-HB) cycle including: An/tase, aconitase; CS, citrate synthase; F/arase,
  Fumarase; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; PPK, phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) kinase; PCK, PEP carboxykinase; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  SCS, succinyl-CoA synthetase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase.'
