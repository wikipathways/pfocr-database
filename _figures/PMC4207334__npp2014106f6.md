caption: Hypothetical scheme of cGMP- and cAMP-mediated pathways in hippocampal memory
  consolidation processes. Calcium (Ca2+) influx through NMDA receptors activates
  calmodulin (CaM), which in an early phase mediates the activation of nitric oxide
  synthase and subsequent nitric oxide (NO). The latter binds to soluble guanylate
  cyclase (GC), which upon binding stimulates the conversion of guanosine triphosphate
  (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP then hydrolyzes protein kinase
  G (PKG). As a consequence of a persistent intracellular presence of Ca2+, adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) will eventually be triggered to convert adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  into cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Consequently, cAMP will stimulate protein kinase
  A (PKA) presumably to enhance cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated
  transcription and in that manner promote protein synthesis. Our data show that upregulation
  of the cGMP-PKG pathway in an early consolidation phase requires cAMP-mediated signaling
  in a later phase of consolidation. How this mechanistically takes place is not clear.
  It could be argued that cGMP and/or PKG lower the stimulation threshold for Ca2+
  signals from other sources then through influx via the NMDA receptor, and therefore
  could enhance postsynaptic cAMP signaling.
