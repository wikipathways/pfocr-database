caption: Proposed models on the inhibitory role of miR‐1‐3p/miR‐206 in HGF‐induced
  gefitinib resistance. As depicted in the model, miR‐1‐3p/miR‐206 overcome HGF‐induced
  gefitinib resistance by targeting c‐Met‐Akt/Erk pathway and epithelial‐mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) in lung cancer with EGFR activating mutation

  lung cancer cells through inhibition of c‐Met signalling and EMT .
