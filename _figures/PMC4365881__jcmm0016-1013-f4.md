caption: 'Extracellular regulation of satellite cell fate. Extracellular signalling
  pathways that participate in the regulation of satellite cell fate and are associated
  with positive regulation of Pax7 expression/function are depicted in green. Signalling
  pathways exhibiting negative regulation of Pax7 expression/function are depicted
  in orange. Molecules that function in the same pathway (e.g. Syndecan-3 and Notch;
  Wnt and β-catenin) or leading to equivalent downstream effects in muscle progenitors
  (such as Syndecan-4 and p38), are depicted in common boxes. Signalling pathways
  that affect satellite cell fate but have no clearly defined effects on Pax7 expression/function
  are not depicted. Dotted lines indicate effects on satellite cell fate that are
  currently less defined or controversial. Extracellular signalling can direct the
  transition from one status to another (black arrows), or can stabilize a specific
  status (coloured cells). Green cells: uncommitted progenitor (i.e. recently activated
  and/or quiescent satellite cells); green/yellow cells: self-renewing satellite cells;
  yellow/orange cells: proliferating, MyoD+ muscle precursors (i.e. adult myoblasts);
  red cells: myogenin+, differentiating myocytes; pink multi-nucleated cell: myofibre.'
