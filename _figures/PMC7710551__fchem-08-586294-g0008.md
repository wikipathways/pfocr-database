caption: 'Mechanism of action of phase 3 anti-TB drugs. The figure depicts the mechanism
  of action of five phase 3 drugs inside the bacillus cytoplasm: bedaquiline, pretomanid,
  delamanid, rifapentine, and linezolid. Bedaquiline depletes the intracellular energy
  storage by inhibiting the mycobacterial ATP synthetase which, in turn, results in
  a reduction of ATP production. Linezolid acts by binding to 23S RNA in the ribosome
  50S subunit, inhibiting translation. Rifapentine binds to the RNA polymerase, preventing
  it from binding to the DNA and shutting down bacterial transcription. Pretomanid
  and delamanid are pro-drugs that are converted into their bioactive forms by deazaflavin
  dependent nitroreductase (ddn), which is thought to be a membrane protein. Pretomanid
  or delamanid active intermediates that are formed during the reaction are able to
  bind to undefined targets of the mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway, inhibiting the
  formation of mycolic acids, which are crucial for the mycobacterial cell wall.'
