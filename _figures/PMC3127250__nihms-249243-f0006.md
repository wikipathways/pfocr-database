caption: A. Particular stress stimuli (e.g. oxidative damage, hypoxia or anoxia, nutrient
  starvation, ER stress) can elicit different responses that cooperate to achieve
  optimal cellular repair and adaptation. A diverse range of stressors activate interconnected
  cytoprotective mechanisms able to modulate autophagy at different levels, such as
  transcriptional reprogramming, protein modifications (phosphorylation, acetylation,
  etc.) or cell cycle modulation. B. Autophagy inhibition and stress. Autophagy impairment
  leads to the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles, which in turn can
  elicit cellular stress. Moreover, disabled autophagy can increase the abundance
  of p62, resulting in an enhanced activity of NF-κB, which leads to enhanced inflammation.
  By contrast, p62 accumulation leads to the activation of Nrf2 transcription factor
  and in a consequent increase in the expression of stress response enzymes. C. Mutual
  exclusion between autophagy and apoptosis. Autophagy, as a cytoprotective pathway,
  eliminates potential sources of pro-apoptotic stimuli such as damaged mitochondria,
  thereby setting a higher threshold against apoptosis induction. By contrast, the
  apoptosis-associated activation of proteases such as calpain and caspase-3 may destroy
  autophagy-specific factors (Atg4D, Beclin 1 or Atg5), thereby suppressing autophagy.
