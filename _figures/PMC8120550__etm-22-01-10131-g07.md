caption: Potential pathway regulated by ING3. (A) GeneMANIA analysis revealed interaction
  between ING3 and a core protein of the NF-κB pathway, while Kyoto Encyclopedia of
  Genes and Genomes pathway analysis demonstrated that ING3 may regulate the NF-κB
  pathway. (B) The NF-κB pathway is involved in the RAS signaling pathway. (C) The
  NF-κB pathway is involved in transcriptional misregulation in cancer. ING3, inhibitor
  of growth 3.
