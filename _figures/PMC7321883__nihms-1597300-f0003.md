caption: 'Schematic diagram showing the intimate relationship between the classical
  homeostatic (light blue) and the hedonic (pink/red) neural systems controlling appetite,
  energy balance, and body weight. The classical homeostatic system (integrative energy
  sensor and response allocator) in the brainstem and hypothalamus is capable of sensing
  the internal milieu through circulating (broken light blue lines) and neural (solid
  light blue lines) signals and control energy intake and expenditure subconsciously
  (dark blue lines). The hedonic system senses signals from the environment, calculates
  emotional valence and reward value of potential goal objects through learning and
  memory, and can influence energy intake and expenditure through both conscious voluntary
  (red arrows) and unconscious (purple arrows) actions. Known interacting pathways
  are numbered, with blue numbers/pathways representing bottom-up modulation and red
  numbers/pathways representing top-down modulation. Bottom-up modulation: Circulating
  interoceptive signals have been shown to modulate external sensory inputs, various
  cortical areas, and other areas involved in learning and memory (pathway 1), as
  well as reward processing areas (pathway 2). Interoceptive signals mainly carried
  by vagal afferents reach vast cortical and subcortical areas, including the insular
  cortex (pathway 3). In addition, interoceptive information processed in the hypothalamus
  and brainstem reaches thalamus, hippocampus, and the reward system (pathways 3,
  4, and 5). Specifically, there are orexin projections from the LH to the paraventricular
  nucleus of the hypothalamus and in turn to the nucleus accumbens (pathway 3), and
  to the ventral tegmental area (pathway 5). Top-down modulation: Taste, olfactory,
  and visual information can directly reach parts of the hypothalamus (pathway 6).
  Amygdala to lateral hypothalamic pathways mediate conditioned food intake (pathway
  7). The hypothalamus receives massive inputs from many cortical and subcortical
  areas (pathway 8). The LH receives direct GABA-ergic input from the ventral striatum
  (pathway 9). Subconscious motor actions including autonomic nervous system outflow
  can originate from the striatum, the central amygdala (emotional motor system),
  and certain cortical areas, some of them passing through the periaqueductal gray
  (Pathways 10 and 11). Finally conscious willful motor actions can affect both food
  intake, food choice, and energy expenditure. Abbreviations: PAG, periaqueductal
  gray; VTA, ventral tegmental area; Vent. Pall, ventral pallidum; vmPFC, ventromedial
  prefrontal cortex.'
