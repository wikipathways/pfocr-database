caption: Diagram of traditional NF-κB pathway and the constitutively activated feed-forward
  signaling circuit in CRPC. A constitutively activated feed-forward circuit, composed
  of IkBα/NF-κB(p65), miR-196b-3p, Meis2, and PPP3CC, formed during and required for
  CRPC development. Constitutive activation of this circuit is independent of traditional
  IKKβ/NF-κB pathways, suggesting that targeting this circuitcould be important for
  CRPC treatment.
