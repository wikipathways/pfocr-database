caption: Auxin and cytokinins regulate the meristem size and axillary bud outgrowth.
  (A) Scanning electron microscope image of 1–2 mm maize inflorescence meristem with
  suppressed bract primordia and developing axillary meristem. (B) Genes associated
  with the auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signal pathway, regulating the inflorescence
  branching in maize. Genes indicated in blue color are involved in the coordination
  between auxin-cytokinins signal. (C) The expression domain of key genes in (B).
  (D) Genes associated with the cytokinins biosynthesis, transport, and signal pathway,
  regulating the inflorescence branching in rice. Genes indicated in blue color represent
  maize genes or those coordinating the auxin-cytokinins signal. In the green frame,
  a higher ratio of cytokinins/auxin leads to large panicles with more branches in
  rice. Genes mentioned above are also listed in Supplementary .
