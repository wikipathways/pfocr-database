caption: Pathophysiology of acquired aplastic anemia (AA). Apoptotic and/or infected
  hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can release unmodified or chemically
  and/or genetically modified antigens (self-Ags) that are phagocyted by macrophages
  (Mφs) and presented to antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs). These cells process
  and present Ags to naïve CD4+ T cells, that differentiate toward T helper (Th) 1
  phenotype under interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and
  interferon-gamma (IFNγ), mainly through STAT and HIF-1α signaling pathway activation.
  DCs via Ag presentation to T-cell receptor (TCR) and Th1 cells sustain effector
  cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL) activation through STATs, HIF-1α, and mTORC1/2
  signaling. Activated CTLs induce growth inhibition and apoptosis of HSPCs by directly
  killing cells via granzyme B and perforin release, and by paracrine inhibitory effects
  of TNF-α, IFNγ, Fas ligand (Fas-L), activation of inducible nitric oxide (NO, *)
  synthase, and NO release, they also exert cytotoxicity near cells. HSPC growth inhibition
  is also caused by a decoy receptor function of IFNγ, that binds to growth factors
  (GFs), such as thrombopoietin, and interferes with their binding to surface receptors.
  Persistent Ag stimulation induces Th17 differentiation of naïve T cells under IL-6,
  IL-21, and IL-23 stimulation. Th17 cells also reduce T regulatory cell (Treg) function
  and numbers because IL-17 and IFNγ augment HIF-1α stabilization which blocks the
  master transcription factor FOXP3 of Treg. Parts of the figure were drawn by using
