caption: Outlines of the AhR signaling pathway. a) Inactive AhR is cytosolic and forms
  a complex together with chaperone proteins HSP90, Src, AIP, and p23. Binding between
  AhR and its ligand translocates the activated ligand-AhR complex into the nucleus,
  where it dissociates from its chaperone proteins. The complex heterodimerizes with
  AhR Nuclear Translocator (ARNT) and binds to Xenobiotic-Responsive Elements (XRE)
  in the promoter regions of target genes [173], enabling modulation of target gene
  expression by inducing mRNA transcription. Some target genes include CYP1A1, CYP1A2,
  CYP1B1, NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), glutathione s-transferase (GST),
  UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), and aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AhRR).
  AhRR suppresses AhR activity through binding with ARNT and XRE [174-176]. b) Following
  exposure to a highly carcinogenic ligand, like 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
  (TCDD), intracellular calcium concentrations increase, sourced extracellularly and
  from the endoplasmic reticulum [173]. TCDD induces functional activation of tyrosine
  kinase Src which is released from the AhR complex [177], altering cellular adhesion
  properties in the process by activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [177]. Calcium
  influx activates protein kinase C (PKCα) which phosphorylates phospholipase A2 (cPLA2),
  stimulating the production of arachidonic acid [173]. Src activation also activates
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), ERK-1 and –2, allowing the transcription
  of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) which utilizes arachidonic acid to produce prostaglandins,
  ultimately modifying pathophysiological process like inflammation [173,178]. (Created
