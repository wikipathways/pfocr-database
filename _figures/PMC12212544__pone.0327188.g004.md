caption: Schematic of sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway. Metabolites are indicated
  in italics, enzymes indicated in bold, and C. elegans enzyme names are indicated
  in purple [58]. Presence of enzymes from humans, C. elegans, yeast (Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae), and N. parisii was determined with BLAST, using a threshold E‐value
  of greater than 10−5 [59]. The presence of the enzyme is indicated by a colored
  circle corresponding to the legend at the left
