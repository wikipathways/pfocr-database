caption: Activation of the seven transmembrane β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) on adipocytes
  by norepinephrine (NE), leads to Gs-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC)
  to increase intracellular levels of cyclic-AMP (cAMP). cAMP activates protein kinase
  A (PKA) to phosphorylate (P) PLIN1, which release ABHD5 to fully activate PNPLA2
  TAG hydrolase activity and release a fatty acid (FA). PKA also phosphorylates HSL
  to promote its translocation to PLIN1 and increase its DAG hydrolase activity to
  release a FA and produce MAG. MAG is hydrolyzed by MGL to release a final FA and
  glycerol. Lipolysis can also be stimulated by natriuretic peptide (NP) which signals
  through the NP receptor-A (NPR-A) to increase guanylyl cyclase (GC)/cyclic-GMP (cGMP)
  and activation of protein kinase G (PKG). PKG can also phosphorylate HSL and PLIN1.
  Insulin, the main anti-lipolytic hormone (red lines), signals through the insulin
  receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1/2) to increase activity
  of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and levels of PIP3. PIP3 activates the kinase
  AKT, which through currently unknown mechanisms (?), activates phosphodiesterase
  3B (PDE3B) to hydrolyze cAMP to AMP. ABHD15, an AKT phosphorylation substrate, is
  required for the anti-lipolytic action of insulin and can bind to and stabilize
  PDE3B. Dotted line indicates movement of proteins, while the dashed red line notes
  currently unclear pathway of regulation.
