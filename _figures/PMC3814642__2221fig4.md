caption: Model for RAS-directed silencing of TSGs. (Top) RAS signaling through the
  MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways results in increased levels of ZFP354B, which binds to
  the TSG promoter and initiates recruitment of other cofactors (which may or may
  not bind directly to ZFP354B). Recruitment of DNMT1 leads to methylation of the
  promoter and silencing of TSG expression. (Bottom) The RAS-directed signaling pathway
  can be targeted through pharmacological inhibition of MAPK or PI3K/AKT, which leads
  to reduced levels of ZFP354B. In the absence of ZFP354B binding, association of
  other cofactors with the promoter cannot be maintained, and, in conjunction with
  rapid DNA demethylation, the TSG is re-expressed.
