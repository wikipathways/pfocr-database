caption: Emodin might stop mast cells from getting activated by FceRI. The activation
  of Syk, a receptor-proximal tyrosine kinase, happens when FceRI comes into contact
  with the right antigen. A protein called NTAL, which acts as an adaptor, helps Syk
  control how the PI3K pathway works. This is important because it allows NF-кB to
  make COX-2 and other proinflammatory cytokines. Syk also phosphorylates LAT, which
  leads to the formation of a macromolecular signaling complex that allows for a wide
  range of downstream signalings, like PLC1 and Grb2. Activated PLC1 is important
  for Ca2+ responses and activation of PKCs, which are important for degranulation
  and the movement of cPLA2α and 5-LO to the perinuclear membrane and the direction
  of cPLA2α and 5-LO to the perinuclear membrane. The Grb2-mediated pathway is important
  for cPLA2α to be activated properly, leading to eicosanoid hormones [].
