caption: The biogenesis of exosomes depends on two pathways ESCRT dependent and ESCRT-independent.
  (A) The formation of exosomes begins with the inward budding of the plasma membrane,
  leading to the formation of early endosomes. Subsequently, the ESCRT complex (ESCRT
  0, I, II, III) facilitates the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These
  MVBs either fuse with lysosomes for degradation (by autophagosomes) or translocate
  to the plasma membrane, where the SNARE complex aids their fusion, releasing the
  exosomes into the extracellular space. In ESCRT-independent mechanism RAB31 present
  on late endosomes that interact to EGFR, EGFR phosphorylate RAB31 viva tyrosine
  phosphorylation. Active RAB31 bind with Flotillin (FLOTs), now these complexes allow
  to formation of ILVs. Additionally, RAB31 recruit TBC1D2B that binds with protein
  RAB7 and prevents MVEs from fusing with lysosomes. (B) Biogenesis of apoptotic bodies
  begins with cytoskeletal reorganization and plasma membrane blebbing that regulated
  by ROCK1 and MLCK proteins. Caspase-3 triggers ROCK1, which then modifies myosin
  II, leading strong contractions of the cytoskeleton, and formation of membrane blebs.
  Further aspase-3 kinase cleaves PAK2 and add fatty acid to it, thereby increasing
  its activity, that help in cell membrane movement and controls cell shape. Moreover,
  activates JNK pathways, for the proper release of apoptotic EVs
