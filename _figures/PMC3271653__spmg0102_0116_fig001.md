caption: 'Testosterone signaling pathways. (1) The classical testosterone signaling
  pathway. Testosterone diffuses through the plasma membrane and binds with the AR.
  The AR undergoes an alteration in conformation allowing it to be released from heat
  shock proteins in the cytoplasm. AR then is able to translocate to the nucleus where
  it binds to specific DNA sequences called androgen response elements (AREs). AR
  binding to an ARE allows the recruitment of co-activator and co-repressor proteins
  that alter the expression of genes to alter cellular function. (2) The non-classical
  kinase activation pathway: testosterone interacts with the classical AR that then
  is able to recruit and activate Src, which causes the activation of the EGF receptor
  via an intracellular pathway. The EGF receptor then activates the MAP kinase cascade
  most likely through Ras resulting in the sequential activation of RAF and MEK and
  then ERK that activates p90Rsk-kinase, which is known to phosphorylate CREB on serine
  133. As a result, CREB-regulated genes such as lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) and
  early growth response 1 (Egr1) and CREB can be induced by testosterone. (3) The
  non-classical Ca2+ influx pathway: Testosterone interacts with a receptor in the
  plasma membrane that has characteristics of a Gq coupled G-protein coupled receptor
  (GPCR). Phospholipase C (PLC) is activated to cleave PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. Lower
  concentrations of PIP2 inhibit K+ATP channels causing membrane depolarization and
  Ca2+ entry via L-type Ca2+ channels.'
