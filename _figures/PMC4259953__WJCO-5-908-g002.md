caption: 'Activation of protease-activated receptors is a major mechanism of tissue
  factor-coagulation factor VIIa signaling in breast cancer cells. The proteolytic
  activities of the TF-fVIIa binary complex [potentially (designated as dotted line)
  ternary complex with fXa] cleave the N-terminal end of PARs. PARs are then activated
  via intra-molecular binding between the newly created N-terminus and an extracellular
  loop region of the receptors. Activation of these G-protein-coupled receptors subsequently
  activates downstream signaling cascades. A number of studies have indicated that
  PAR2 is crucial for activation of a TF-fVII-driven signaling cascade in breast cancer
  cells. The role of TF-fVII on PAR1 signaling in breast cancer cells is less evident.
