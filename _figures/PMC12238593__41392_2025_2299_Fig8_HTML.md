caption: Major challenges and future therapeutic prospects in glioblastoma treatment.
  Key aspects, such as glioma stem cells (GSCs), therapy resistance, the blood‒brain
  barrier (BBB), metabolic reprogramming, and immune adaptation, are highlighted.
  1. The glioblastoma (GBM) tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes to therapy resistance
  and disease progression. GSCs exhibit self-renewal capacity and plasticity, driving
  tumor recurrence and treatment failure. The proneural-to-mesenchymal transition
  underscores the heterogeneity of GBM, further complicating treatment strategies.
  2. Therapy resistance mechanisms, including genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications,
  and adaptive survival pathways, are key obstacles to effective treatment. These
  mechanisms enable GBM cells to evade chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies.
  3. This study highlights the challenges of overcoming the BBB, which restricts drug
  penetration and limits the efficacy of systemic therapies. Prospects involve strategies
  such as engineered EV-mediated drug delivery, efflux pump inhibitors, and modified
  pericytes and astrocytes to increase therapeutic access to the tumor site. 4. Metabolic
  reprogramming involves altered ATP production, lipid metabolism, and glycolysis,
  which provide energy for rapid tumor growth. Targeting metabolic vulnerabilities
  through the use of mitochondrial inhibitors, glycolysis modulators, and lipid metabolism
  disruptors is an emerging therapeutic approach. 5. In GBM, tumor-associated macrophages
  (TAMs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex) contribute
  to an immunosuppressive environment. Immunotherapy strategies, including checkpoint
  inhibitors, dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines, and the reprogramming of macrophage
  phenotypes (M2 to M1), aim to restore antitumor immunity and improve therapeutic
  responses. This schematic underscores the multifaceted nature of GBM pathophysiology
  and emphasizes the need for multimodal approaches integrating targeted therapy,
  immunotherapy, metabolic intervention, and BBB-modulating strategies to increase
  treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes
