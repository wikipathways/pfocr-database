caption: Host genes with reproducible microbiome associations across cohorts. Network
  analysis of host signaling and metabolic pathways enriched for association with
  microbial taxa (FDR <0.25, Matthew’s correlation test). The visualization of gene-gene
  interaction network for the subset of 49 genes with significantly conserved directionalities
  of association with the microbiome is supported by several types of gene-gene connection
  []. This enrichment analysis identified enriched functional networks in innate immune
  response, inflammatory response, and the JAK-STAT pathway, all of which play roles
  in immune response to pathogen infection [].
