caption: 'Mstn/Act-A cell signaling. Mstn/Act-A bind to ActRIIB/A on the plasma membrane,
  which leads to activation by phosphorylation of type-1 ALK 2, 4, 5, or 7. This in
  turn induces phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 and the involvement of SMAD4 into
  a SMAD complex that translocates into the nucleus and elicits transcription of gene
  targets. SMAD7 inhibits SMAD pathway. Mstn and Act-A block AKT phosphorylation and
  consequently, dephosphorylated FOXO can enter the nucleus and promote the transcription
  and expression of atrophy specific genes. Mstn and Act-A can also signal through
  MAPK activation and WNT inhibition. The binding to the receptor is controlled by
  Mstn–Act-A propeptides and by circulating antagonists. Lastly, the ActRII/ActRIB
  receptor complex is inhibited by Cripto, a small GPI-anchored signaling protein.
  Inflammatory milieu contributes to Mstn and Act-A expression through NF-kB. Abbreviations:
  Act-A = activin A, ActRIIB/A = activin receptor type IIB, IIA; ALK = type-1 activin
  receptor serine kinase2, 4, 5, or 7; Mstn = myostatin; ERK = extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases; FOXO = forkhead box transcription factor; FSTL = follistatin; GPI = glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked
