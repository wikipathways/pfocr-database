caption: gli2a transcription is directly or indirectly repressed by Rest. When Rest
  activity is attenuated, more Gli2a protein is produced. Depending on the level of
  Shh, Gli2a is processed to activator or repressor forms. An alternate model where
  Rest regulates nuclear transport of GliA and GliR is also consistent with our data.
