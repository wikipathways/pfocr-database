caption: Proposed actions of CSE derived H2S under normal conditions and in the setting
  of cardiovascular disease. H2S is a potent regulator of cellular redox status that
  limits oxidative stress thereby preserving eNOS function and promoting nitric oxide
  (NO) production. Diminished endogenous H2S results in profound oxidative stress,
  reduced BH4 levels and dysfunctional eNOS (i.e., eNOS uncoupling). Reduced nitric
  oxide levels exacerbate cardiovascular pathology.
