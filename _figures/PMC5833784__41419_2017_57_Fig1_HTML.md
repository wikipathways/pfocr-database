caption: Peroxidation of membrane lipids, predominantly phosphatidylinositole and
  phosphotidylethanolamine, represents the point of no return during ferroptosis that
  results in loss of NADPH abundance and synchronized regulated necrosis (SRN) in
  sensitive organs, such as the renal tubular compartment or the myocardium. Lipoxygenases
  (ALOX) mediate lipid peroxidation, predominantly and specifically of PIP2 and phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE). The constitutively active function of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a selenoenzyme
  that requires glutathione (GSH) to function, prevents lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis
  may be triggered by inhibition of system Xc-minus, a cys/glu-antiporter in the plasma
  membrane by a lethal compound referred to as erastin. Inhibition of system Xc-minus
  functionally inhibits the activation of the GSH-synthase (GSSG), resulting in GSH
  depletion, dysfunction of GPX4 and ferroptosis. RSL3 induces ferroptosis directly
  by inhibition of GPX4, and certain nanoparticles are capable of inducing ALOX activation
  in vitro. Before lipid peroxidation occurs, it may be prevented by the ferrostatins
  liproxstatin, ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), and the novel compounds
  16–86, XJB-5-131 and JP4-039. The latter carries intrinsic anti-necroptotic activity
  beyond its function as a ferrostatin. Ferroptosis accounts for the majority of tubular
  cell loss during acute kidney injury because of its mechanism of SRN that shuts
  down an entire functional unit, but ferroptosis may be triggered by any cell death
  that occurs in cells of the functional syncytium because of the preterminal loss
  of NADPH that occurs in all cell death pathways
