caption: TCR activation and IL-2 signaling results in c-Myc expression, which coordinates
  the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. This
  process is accompanied by an increased flux of glucose and glutamine into the cell,
  resulting in elevated levels of UDP-GlcNAc, the end product of the hexamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP). O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) covalently links GlcNAc sugars to proteins.
  Under nutrient-rich conditions, O-GlcNAcylation of Thr-58 in c-Myc outcompetes phosphorylation
  at the same residue, thereby preventing its degradation. Stable c-Myc expression
  is required for maintenance of aerobic glycolysis and proliferation upon T-cell
  activation. G, O-GlcNAcylation; P, phosphorylation.
