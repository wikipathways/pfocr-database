caption: Bile acids are the end products of cholesterol catabolism. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
  (CYP7A1) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the bile acid synthetic pathway.
  Primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are endogenous
  ligands of FXR. In the liver, FXR induces SHP, which inhibits Cyp7A1 gene transcription.
  In the intestine, FXR induces fibroblast growth factors 1 (FGF15), which is secreted
  to blood circulation to activate a hepatic FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) to activate mainly
  the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway to inhibit CYP7A1 and sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) gene
  transcription. FXR is known to stimulate energy metabolism by inducing ApoCII and
  inhibiting ApoCIII to activate lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which hydrolyzes triglycerides
  carried by VLDL and chylomicrons in peripheral tissues. FXR also induces peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and
  clearance. FXR regulates lipoprotein metabolism by inducing VLDL receptor (VLDLR)
  and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), and inhibiting ApoB1 and microsomal triglyceride
  transport protein (MTTP) to inhibit VLDL secretion. FXR also has anti-inflammatory
  function by inhibiting NFκB-mediated inflammatory cytokine production in hepatocytes
  and enterocytes. FXR-independent pathways also are involved in regulation of bile
  acid synthesis and liver metabolism. A secondary bile acid-activated G protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR), TGR5, is expressed in hepatic endothelium cells and Kupffer cells,
  but not hepatocytes. TGR5 may regulate lipid metabolism by indirect mechanisms.
  In brown adipose tissues, TGR5/cAMP signaling may stimulate energy metabolism by
  inducing a type 2 deiodinase, which activates T4 to T3. In the intestine, TGR5 signaling
  protects barrier function and inflammation in the intestine, and may indirectly
  protect hepatocyte against inflammation. Conjugated bile acids, taurocholic acid
  (TCA) selectively activates a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) in hepatocytes.
  Extracellular signal activates sphingosine kinase 1(SphK1), which is translocated
  to plasma membrane to phosphorylate sphingosine to S1P. S1P activates membrane S1PRs
  by paracrine/autocrine mechanism. Growth factors (epidermal growth factor, FGFR4,
  etc.) and phorbol esters activate protein kinase C (PKC), which activates ERK1/2
  of the mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway to phosphorylate SphK2. SphK2 is
  translocated to the nucleus to bind to histone deacetylase 1/2 (HDAC1/2). S1P signaling
  activates ERK1/2, and AKT in insulin receptor signaling pathway. Nuclear SphK2 generated
  S1P has been shown to bind to chromatin and inhibits HDAC1/2. Inhibition of HDAC1/2
  results in activation of histone acetylases, which stimulate expression of steroid
  response element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), which induces all genes in lipogenesis
  (fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, etc.), and CYP7A1 in bile acid synthesis.
  On the other hand, the FXR/SHP pathway inhibits SREBP-1c and CYP7A1 gene transcription
  by recruiting HDAC1/2, histone methytransferase G9a, and histone lysine-specific
  demethylase LSD-1 to inhibit lipogenesis and bile acid synthesis. These positive
  and negative regulations modulate hepatic lipid homeostasis.
