caption: Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Cholesterol is the predominant sterol in
  vertebrates, and in eukaryotes, the mevalonate pathway is the main synthesis pathway
  for cholesterol. Acetyl CoA and acetoacetyl CoA are converted via the isoprenoids
  (e.g., FPP and GGPP) to squalene. Three of the key enzymes in this pathway are HMGCR,
  FDPS, and FDFT1. The importance of cholesterol to a variety of cellular processes
  means that cholesterol concentration within the cell is tightly regulated. Consequently,
  cholesterol synthesis is closely linked to cholesterol uptake via receptors such
  as the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and export from the cell via transporters
  such as the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1).
