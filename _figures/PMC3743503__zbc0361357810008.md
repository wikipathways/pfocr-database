caption: GeneGo pathway map translation regulation of eIF2 activity. Part of the GeneGo
  pathway map for translation regulation of eIF2 activity is represented in the diagram.
  Molecules are represented by node icons. Different shaped node icons represent different
  families of proteins. Edges between nodes represent an inhibitory interaction (red),
  an activating interaction (green), or an unknown interaction (gray). The flow of
  the pathway is represented by the directionality of the arrows. The shapes in the
  center of the arrows describe the nature of the interaction (e.g. phosphorylation,
  binding, etc.). This pathway was significantly enriched for the kinases identified
  to significantly decrease (−) total tau (p value = 1.494e−6). The table below the
  pathway diagram describes whether total or phospho-tau are increased (+) or decreased
  (−) in the kinome screen. eIF2AK1, eIF2AK3, and eIF2AK2 (PKR) are all involved in
  phosphorylation of and inhibition of eIF2S1. MAPK1 as part of the ERK complex is
  involved in regulating the dephosphorylation of eIF2S1 via protein phosphatase 1
  (PP1). GSK3α and -β are involved in phosphorylation of and inhibition of eIF2B5.
  EGFR, EGF receptor. SOS, son of sevenless guanine nucleotide exchange factor; CS,
  complex subunit; GR, group relation; B, binding; T, transformation.
