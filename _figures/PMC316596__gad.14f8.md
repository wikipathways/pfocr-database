caption: Model for SON-1 function. SON-1 and a POP-1-like protein antagonistically
  regulate gene expression in Wnt-responding cells. The POP-1-like activity inhibits
  gene transcription, whereas SON-1 facilitates gene transcription. SON-1 might facilitate
  gene transcription after the inhibitory effect of the POP-1-like activity is relieved
  on activation of the Wnt pathway. SON-1 could change the chromatin conformation
  in favor of gene expression. Alternatively, SON-1 could interact with other transcription
  factors to help stimulate gene expression. (POP-1) A POP-1-like protein; (TF) transcription
  factor.
