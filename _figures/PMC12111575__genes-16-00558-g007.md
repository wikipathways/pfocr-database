caption: Enzyme gene expression of polysaccharide biosynthesis in different organs
  of B. striata. The black names represent intermediate products in the polysaccharide
  synthesis pathway, the red names represent key enzymes in the polysaccharide synthesis
  pathway. Leaf, root, and tuber represent corresponding samples, the numbers on the
  left represent corresponding enzyme gene IDs, and the blue to red colors represent
  gene expression levels from low to high
