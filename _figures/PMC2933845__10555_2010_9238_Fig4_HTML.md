caption: Genistein inhibits critical pathways in cancer invasion. Our group has demonstrated
  that genistein can specifically target MEK4. This inhibition results in inactivation
  of the MEK4 pathway, decreased MMP-2 production, and decreased cell invasion. Genistein
  also activates Smad1, which is activated by the endoglin signaling pathway, and
  causes decreased cell invasion. Additionally, genistein inhibits FAK activation,
  resulting in increased cell adhesion. At this time, it is unclear whether the activation
  of Smad1 and FAK are due to genistein’s inhibition of MEK4 or via a different signaling
  mechanism
