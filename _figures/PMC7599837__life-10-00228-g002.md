caption: Stages of miRNA formation and tumor growth resulting from reduced expression
  of PTEN. (1) In the nucleus, the miRNA gene is transcribed by RNA Polymerase II
  (RNA Pol. II), and the resulting product is primary miRNA (pri-miRNA). (2) The pri-miRNA
  is then modified into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) by Drosha. (3) Dicer then trims
  the pre-miRNA into shorter (21-23bp), double-stranded miRNA in the cytoplasm. (4)
  One of the strands is fixed to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). (5) When
  the fixed miRNA strand in the RISC binds to a perfectly complementary mRNA strand,
  degradation of mRNA occurs, thereby suppressing the expression of target mRNA. (6)
  The binding of miR-21 to PTEN results in reduced expression of PTEN. (7) The decrease
  in PTEN activates the PI3K/AKT pathway instead of suppressing it. (8) Constant activation
  of AKT occurs, leading to cell survival.
