caption: TREM2 signaling pathway (by Figdraw). TREM-2 orchestrates the activation
  of signaling cascades within myeloid cells through the engagement of DAP12, DAP10,
  and an array of other receptors upon the detection of ligands. Notably, DAP12 is
  endowed with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), facilitating
  downstream signaling, whereas DAP10 is devoid of such a motif. The formation of
  heterodimers between TREM-2 and either DAP12 or DAP10 catalyzes the phosphorylation
  of adaptor proteins, thereby igniting a cascade of downstream pathways subsequent
  to ligand binding. (a) In the intricate signaling network of TREM-2/DAP12, the Src
  kinase activates DAP12, which in turn recruits the Sos1/2 and GRB2 junction proteins,
  leading to the inhibition of the RAS/MEK/ERK (or MAPK) pathway, a process that curtails
  the release of proinflammatory cytokines. (b) TREM-2 further establishes a complex
  with DAP12 or DAP10, engaging in crosslinking with receptors such as CSF1R, which
  modulates TREM-2/DAP12 signaling through the phosphorylation of DAP12/ITAM by Src
  kinase. This interaction recruits spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), setting in motion
  downstream signaling pathways that involve guanine nucleotide exchange factors Vav2/3,
  Pyk2, and PI3K, with the assistance of DAP10. (c) Conversely, the interplay between
  DAP12 and DOK3 facilitates the recruitment of SHIP1, an inositol phosphatase characterized
  by a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which catalyzes the conversion of PIP3 to PIP2.
  This pivotal process governs the involvement and activation of intracellular signaling
  proteins associated with the membrane through PIP3. (d) The regulatory mechanisms
  of transcription are mediated by β-catenin and mTORC1. The activation of AKT and
  mTORC2 by PIP2/3 underpins metabolic homeostasis, while the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway
  modulates proinflammatory gene expression, with Ca2+ modulation facilitating actin
  remodeling. (e) TREM2 plays a crucial role in the dual responses of immune cells—both
  pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory—triggered by TLR4. In the nascent stages
  of bacterial infection, various antigenic substances can directly activate the TLR4
  receptor, instigating the NF-κB signaling pathway that augments the expression of
  inflammatory factors. Concurrently, the TREM2-DAP12-SYK pathway activates the IKK
  complex, promoting the degradation of IκBα and enabling NF-κB to translocate into
  the nucleus, thereby driving the inflammatory response. Upon activation, TREM2 recruits
  SHP-1, a protein that dephosphorylates critical molecules within the NF-κB pathway,
  such as IKKβ and p65, thereby obstructing their nuclear translocation. This mechanism
  effectively inhibits the excessive activation of NF-κB instigated by TLR4, leading
  to a reduction in the release of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IL-6.
  Furthermore, it curtails glycolysis in macrophages via the AKT/mTOR pathway, diminishing
  the production of pro-inflammatory factors reliant on NF-κB
