caption: 'Schematic diagram of m(6)A biological functions. As the most common RNA
  modification, m(6)A is involved in a variety of normal physiological and disease
  pathological processes: ① Transcriptor zinc finger protein 217 (ZFP217) can reduce
  the binding of METTL3 to other RNAs by interacting with METTL3, thereby reducing
  m(6)A modification of the mRNA of key stem cell regulatory factors including Nanog,
  Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. This promotes their translation and increases protein levels,
  ultimately promoting and maintaining embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency and
  somatic cell reprogramming. ② METTL3-mediated m(6)A modification of intracellular
  transcripts can recruit Pol κ to DNA damage sites caused by UV, thereby accelerating
  DNA damage repair to promote cell survival. ③ METTL3-mediated m(6)A modification
  can regulate the selective splicing of spermatogenesis-related transcription factor
  SOHLH1 mRNA, which increases its protein expression and up-regulates Kit protein
  expression, ultimately activating spermatogonia differentiation and spermatogenesis-related
  signal transduction. ④ The increase in intracellular ROS mediated by loss of expression
  of the circadian clock determinant Bmal1 can increase PPAR-α mRNA m(6)A through
  METTL3-YTHDF2, promoting its degradation and reducing protein expression, ultimately
  damaging liver lipid metabolism and leading to lipid accumulation. ⑤ METTL3 can
  promote the translation and stability of nephronectin (NPNT) mRNA by increasing
  NPNT mRNA m(6)A, thereby up-regulating NPNT protein levels. Elevated NPNT can further
  increase the number of muscle cells, expand the diameter of myotubes, and delay
  skeletal muscle atrophy and myotube aging, thereby maintaining the stability of
  muscle tissue and conferring skeletal muscle resistance to degeneration caused by
  aging. ⑥ High expression of METTL3 promotes m(6)A modification of Cyclin D1 (CCND1)
  mRNA. YTHDF3 recognizes and binds to the m(6)A modification site of CCND1 mRNA,
  recruiting cytoplasmic 1 like protein (PABPC1L) and eIF4G2 to promote its translation.
  This increases its protein level, ultimately promoting hematopoietic stem cell remodeling,
  differentiation, and self-renewal. ⑦ METTL3 overexpression can increase suppressor
  of cytokine signaling 2(SOCS2) mRNA m(6)A, induce its degradation, and inhibit protein
  expression in a YTHDF2-dependent manner. This promotes proliferation, migration,
  and colony formation in liver cancer cells, thereby accelerating the progression
  of liver cancer. ⑧ METTL3 overexpression can promote BHLHE41 mRNA m(6)A and translation
  in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, thereby up-regulating expression of the basic
  helix-loop-helix family member e41 (Bhlhe41) and inducing CXCL1 transcription, expression,
  and secretion. Increased CXCL1 then recruits MDSC and inhibits anti-tumor immune
  responses of CD8( +) T cells and NK cells. ⑨ The increased expression of METTL3
  in hepatocytes can promote the stability of fatty acid synthase (Fasn) mRNA m(6)A
  and up-regulate its protein level. This enhances fatty acid metabolism and reduces
  insulin sensitivity, ultimately contributing to obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D).
  ⑩ Increased expression of METTL3 in cardiomyocytes can promote m(6)A- and YTHDF2-dependent
  degradation of FGF16 mRNA, down-regulate its protein expression, and ultimately
  inhibit cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation, which is detrimental to
  myocardial injury repair and heart regeneration. ⑪ Insufficient expression of METTL
  3 in naive T cells can reduce the levels of m(6)A in mRNAs including SOCS1, SOCS3,
  and CISH. It also delays their decay, increases their protein levels, which inhibits
  IL-7-mediated JAK-STAT5 activation. This ultimately impairs T cell proliferation
  and differentiation and disrupts T cell homeostasis. ⑫ During embryonic development,
  METTL3-mediated zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and m(6)A enrichment of murine ERV-like
  (MERVL, 2-cell stage transposon), VIRMA-mediated maternal transposon (MTA), and
  MERVL m(6)A are increased, promoting the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) process.
  As a result, the oocyte completes cell fate transition and ultimately maintains
  normal development of the preimplantation embryo. ⑬ After the fetus is born, the
  high expression of FTO in its brain tissue can maintain the m(6)A modification of
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and up-regulate its protein expression.
  This activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, ultimately promoting the proliferation
  of neural stem cells, neuronal differentiation, and maintenance of normal brain
  development and intellectual development. ⑭ FTO can induce m(6)A in the mRNA of
  key autophagy regulators such as ATG5 and ATG7, increasing their mRNA stability
  and protein expression and ultimately promoting autophagy and adipogenesis. ⑮ Overexpression
  of FTO in lung cancer tissue can enhance the removal of m(6)A from ABCC10 mRNA,
  thereby promoting its stability and protein expression. This ultimately accelerates
  cell growth and enhances gefitinib resistance. ⑯ Overexpressed YTHDF1 in breast
  cancer tissues recognizes and binds to m(6)A-labeled FoxM1 mRNA and promotes its
  translation. Elevated FoxM1 then promotes cell proliferation, EMT, metastasis, and
  invasion, ultimately leading to cancer progression'
