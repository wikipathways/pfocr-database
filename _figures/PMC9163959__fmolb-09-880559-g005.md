caption: Analysis of hepatic lipid catabolism with alkyne FA tracers. Using alkyne
  long-chain (LC) and medium-chain (MC) FAs, their different handling in the catabolic
  pathway of primary mouse hepatocytes was studied. Upon uptake, both FAs follow the
  pathway (left) with FA activation to an acyl-CoA, conversion to the corresponding
  acyl-CAR, transport into mitochondria, and regeneration of the acyl-CoA inside the
  mitochondria. These steps are governed by acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS), carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), carnitine-acylcarnitine-translocase (CACT), and CPT2,
  respectively. When triacsin C or teglicar inhibit the cytosolic steps, only MCFAs
  can enter the mitochondria in the unesterified form, before activation by a mitochondrial
  ACS (that appears unaffected by triacsin C). In the mitochondrial matrix, these
  preparatory steps are followed by the actual β-oxidation cycle. This sequence of
  enzymatic reactions does not proceed completely successively for a single FA molecule
  but rather generates a pool of intermediates that is sufficiently long-lived to
  be accessible for CPT2 or carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) to generate shortened
  acyl-CARs that are released from the mitochondria to the cytosol (right). There,
  they undergo transesterification, forming acyl-CoA for various metabolic pathways,
  including secretion from cells. Of note, facilitated by an unidentified transporter,
  hepatocytes also secrete the shortened acyl-CARs. These metabolites may also fulfill
  a signaling function as they carry information about the metabolic status of this
  major β-oxidizing tissue, ref. ().
