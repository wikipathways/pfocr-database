caption: ATPase cycle for MutLα. The extended state corresponds to MutLα with no nucleotide
  bound (apo). The binding of the first ATP condenses one “arm” (probably Mlh1), forming
  the one-armed state; the binding of a second ATP condenses the other arm (Pms2),
  forming the condensed state (or the semi-condensed state, which is related to the
  condensed state by a conformational rearrangement of the protein). The hydrolysis
  and release of both bound adenine nucleotides, either sequentially (following the
  one-armed pathway) or at the same time (following the semi-condensed pathway), returns
  the protein to the extended conformation.
