caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of inflammation/anti-inflammation
  in DD kidneys. After an injury, such as hypoxia or ischemia, ATP is released and
  the production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α is induced. Via the NF-κB pathway,
  TNF-α stimulates A2AR expression although the formation and uptake of extracellular
  adenosine are restricted. Thus, the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway could be initiated
  and promote anti-inflammatory immune responses, e.g., through the induction of IL-10
  and the switch to the M2 macrophage phenotype (CD163). If injury or inflammation
  persists, this can lead to the generation of TGF-β1, which may mediate the onset
  of fibrosis.
