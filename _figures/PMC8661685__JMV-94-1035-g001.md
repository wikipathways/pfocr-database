caption: Schematic diagram of SARS‐CoV‐2 replication in the cell showcasing S, N,
  ORF3a, RdRp, NSP3, and 5′‐UTR based epistatic interactions. The replication cycle
  starts with the ACE2 receptor binding of the spike glycoprotein (S) as cornered
  at the top‐left and finishes with the exocytosis at the top‐right. The viruses which
  do not carry G‐, GH‐ and/or GR‐featured mutations in the S, N, ORF3a, RdRp, NSP3,
  and 5′‐UTR are denoted as the wild‐type where mutants contain those. The red and
  green color icons throughout the diagram, such as proteins, genome, and virion,
  represent the wild and mutant types, respectively. For a generalized virion, we
  used the blue color. Although this theme does not show the co‐infection of both
  types, which might occur on rare occasions, we showed the comparative epistatic
  effects side‐by‐side fashion during the whole replication cycle, making it easy
  to grasp. Related figure(s) for each protein are shown in the enclosed box. We used
  the “question” mark in a pathway and an explanatory box to mean the uncertainty
  or unknown effects of any mutant proteins/RNA structure. ACE2, angiotensin‐converting
  enzyme 2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC‐endoplasmic; RdRp, RNA dependent RNA
  polymerase; NSP14‐proof‐reading enzyme of SARS‐CoV‐2; SARS‐CoV‐2; severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2; 5′‐UTR, 5′‐untranslated region
