caption: Schematic diagram of auxin fluxes and potential sites of auxin perception
  in the plant cell. The pH at the outer side of the PM is maintained at approximately
  5.5 by the H+-ATPase activity of the PM (orange). As a consequence, a proportion
  of auxin (IAA) molecules in the apoplast remain protonated and can enter the cell
  via diffusion (wavy arrows). Auxin also enters cells through the action of specific
  uptake carriers of the AUX/LAX family (red). In the relatively higher pH of the
  cytoplasm, auxin molecules are deprotonated. The resulting ions cannot pass across
  the PM by diffusion and, instead, must be transported by efflux carriers including
  the PIN auxin transporters (green) and the MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE/P-GLYCOPROTEIN ABCB
  transporters (light blue). The coordinated polar localization of the auxin-efflux
  carriers from the long PIN subfamily at the PM determines the directionality of
  the auxin flow within the tissue. The long PIN proteins undergo constitutive endocytic
  recycling, which allows dynamic changes of PIN polarity by a transcytotic mechanism.
  PIN5, a member of the short PIN subfamily, is found at the membranes of the ER and
  leads to compartmentalization of auxin into the lumen of the ER. A number of auxin
  metabolic enzymes are also found in the lumen of the ER, and auxin metabolic profiling
  suggests that auxin entering the ER through PIN5-mediated transport rapidly undergoes
  metabolic conversion. The presumptive auxin receptor ABP1 (blue) is present both
  in the ER and in the apoplast. The receptor for the transcriptional auxin response
  pathway, TIR1 (light blue), is found in the nucleus. The different localizations
  of the long and short subfamilies of PIN efflux carriers, together with the spatial
  separation of the auxin receptors and localization of metabolic enzymes, implies
  that auxin signaling and metabolism, as well as auxin molecules themselves, are
  compartmentalized within the plant cell. Adapted from .
