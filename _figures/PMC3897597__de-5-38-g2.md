caption: Figure 2. Schematic illustration of the theory suggesting that Ptch regulates
  Smo by removing oxysterols. Activation of the Hedgehog (Hh)-signaling pathway due
  to deficiency in the Hh receptor Patched1 (Ptch) is the crucial molecular defect
  that causes the formation of BCCs in human skin. Ptch1 possesses a sterol sensing
  domain (SSD), which is important for suppression of the activity of Smoothened (Smo),
  the signal transduction partner of Ptch. A current theory suggests that Ptch regulates
  Smo by removing oxysterols from Smo. Ptch acts like a sterol pump and removes oxysterols
  that have been created by 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. Upon binding of a Hh protein
  or a mutation in the SSD of Ptch the pump is turned off allowing oxysterols to accumulate
  around Smo. This accumulation of sterols allows Smo to become active via GLI signaling
  or to remain on the cell membrane for a longer period of time.
