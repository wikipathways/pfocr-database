caption: 'Network analysis of proteome datasets in M1 polarized (vs. M0) Mφ. Integrated
  nuclear proteome of polarized and control Mφ was developed as described in Materials
  and Methods, and protein spots that were differentially abundant or posttranslationally
  modified in M1 Mφ (fold change: ≥|1.5|, p value ≤ 0.05) were identified by mass
  spectrometry. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the differential proteome datasets presented  Table
  was performed to develop the networks. Shown are changes in abundance (a, c), RoR
  values indicating S-nitrosylation (b), and phosphorylation (d) of protein spots
  linked to disease and function networks in M1 vs. M0 Mφ. In the networks, the intensity
  of pink/red and green colors shows the extent of increase and decrease in protein
  abundance, RoR values, or phosphorylation levels, respectively, in M1 (vs. M0) Mφ.
  Brownish orange node/lines and blue node/lines show predicted activation and inhibition,
  respectively, of a pathway. Gray and yellow lines are used when putative effect
  is not completely understood. Note that several molecules that are predicted to
  be associated with change in cytoskeletal organization and cell movement were changed
  in abundance as well as S-nitrosylation, and molecules predicted to be associated
  with endocytosis/phagocytosis and cell death/cell survival were significantly changed
  in abundance and phosphorylation.'
