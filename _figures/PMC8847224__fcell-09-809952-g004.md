caption: A systematic schematic of protective agents against drug-induced toxicity
  via modulating the mutual interference between Nrf2 and NF-κB pathways. The protective
  candidates improve the antioxidant capacity by activating the Nrf2 pathway and inhibiting
  the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response, thereby antagonizing the drug-induced
  organ toxicity. Specifically, on the one hand, the protective agents directly or
  indirectly activate the Nrf2 signaling, then prevent IκBα degradation, or increase
  HO-1 expression to inhibit NF-κB activation, thereby increasing antioxidant defense
  ability to resist drug-induced toxicity. On the other hand, the protective agents
  may inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB which activating by drug-induced
  toxicity to increase the activation of the Nrf2 pathway by increasing ARE gene transcription
  and Free CBP, and reducing the recruitment of HDAC3 to the ARE region.
