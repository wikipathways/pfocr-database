caption: PD1/PD-L1 signaling Interaction of APC, tumor or other cells-expressing PD-L1
  (PD-L2) with PD-1 leads to phosphorylation of PD-1 cytoplasmic domain containing
  two motifs - ITIM-pY223 (white band in PD-1 cytoplasmic domain) and ITSM-pY248 (red
  band in PD-1 cytoplasmic domain), of which ITSM is crucial for activation of SHP2
  phosphatase. SHP2 inhibits two pathways involved in the regulation of T cell differentiation,
  proliferation, and activation. The first pathway is antigen-dependent and is activated
  by MHC-peptide-TCR/CD4/8 interaction where SHP2 suppress Lck and ZAP70 kinases signaling
  through PLCγ to three pathways MAPK/ERK/AP-1, PIP3/IP3/Calcineurin/NFATc, and PIP3/DAG/PKCΘ/NF-κB.
  The second pathway, PI3K/Akt, is antigen-independent, and here SHP-2 suppresses
  PIP2 phosphorylation. In tumor cells, PD-L1 expression positively correlates with
  the activity of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, where SHP-2 is its positive regulator.
  SHP-2 binds to autophosphorylated growth factor receptors, Grb2-associated binder
  proteins, and signal regulatory protein α that are tyrosine-phosphorylated. Mutations
  in SHP-2 and other proteins in this signaling pathway, found in many different cancers,
  are connected with increased MAPK/ERK activity resulting in increased PD-L1 expression
  and thus tumor cell-controlled suppression of surrounding immune cells within TME
  and finally, they support tumorigenesis. Membrane-bound PD-L1 can be modified by
  HDAC-2 and transferred into the nucleus, where promotes transcription of genes involved
  in antigen presentation, NF-κB signaling, immune checkpoints, inflammation, proper
  chromatid segregation and pyroptosis
