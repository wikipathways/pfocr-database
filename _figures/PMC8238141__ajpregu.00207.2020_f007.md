caption: Regulators of mitochondrial and metabolic maturation of iPSC-CMs identified
  by proteomics and IPA. Human iPSCs from cardiac and dermal fibroblasts were differentiated
  into cardiac myocytes (cFCMs and dFCMs, respectively). On day 0, the cells were
  treated with inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) and Wnt signaling.
  From days 7 to 9, cells were cultured with insulin. After day 17, cells were maintained
  in glucose-free iCell medium with pyruvate and glutamine. During a time course of
  differentiation at days 12–115, LC-MS/MS of enriched mitochondrial proteins combined
  with IPA predicted the activation of OXPHOS, TCA cycle, FAO, and BCAA catabolic
  pathways. IPA predicted the activation of the genes/proteins, PPARGC1A, INSR, RB1,
  and LONP1, and the downregulation of RICTOR, KDM5, and MAP4K4. cFCM, cardiac fibroblasts;
  dFCM, dermal fibroblasts; IPA, ingenuity pathway analysis; iPSCs, induced pluripotent
  stem cell.
