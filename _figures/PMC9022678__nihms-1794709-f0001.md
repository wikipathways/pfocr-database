caption: Effects of tamoxifen and MerCreMer on cardiac function, phenotype and transcriptome.
  Tamoxifen inducible MerCreMer expression did not cause changes in cardiac function
  and histology in mice at four weeks of age. Nonetheless, small, but transient changes
  in cardiac transcriptome in response to tamoxifen and MerCreMer expression were
  observed. (A) Tamoxifen was injected at 14 days to Myh6-MerCreMer mice. Wild-type
  mice lacking Myh6-MerCreMer were used as controls. (B) Cardiac function was assessed
  by echocardiography at four weeks of age prior to the sacrifice of mice. Hearts
  were harvested to determine cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis and DNA damage. Cardiac
  transcriptome profile was also assessed in the hearts of these mice. (C) Modest,
  but transient increases in interferon response and TP53 pathway were observed.
