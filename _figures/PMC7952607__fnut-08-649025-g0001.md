caption: The role of linoleic acid against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) infection.
  (A) Malnutrition is associated with VL and in malnourished individuals as well as
  VL patients, low levels of linoleic acid (LA) are observed (, ). Malnutrition leads
  to a relative increase in anti-inflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) compared to
  pro-inflammatory leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (11). Higher levels of PGE2 with lower levels
  of LTB4 create an immunosuppressive environment (upregulated Th2 response) in the
  host, which leads to the advancement of VL infection. (B) Linoleic acid plays a
  dual way protective role against Leishmania donovani infection (i) by inhibiting
  the release of Leishmania donovani derived microvesicles (LdMv) from promastigote
  form of the parasite () and (ii) by promoting the protective Th-1 type pro-inflammatory
  (via the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway and suppressing the Th-2 type anti-inflammatory
  immune response (). LA, linoleic acid; LTB4, leukotriene B4; AA, arachidonic acid;
  5-LO, 5-lipoxygenase; Mϕ, macrophage; VL, visceral leishmaniasis; PGE2, prostaglandin
  E2; PGES, prostaglandin E2 synthases; LdMv, Leishmania donovani derived microvesicles.
