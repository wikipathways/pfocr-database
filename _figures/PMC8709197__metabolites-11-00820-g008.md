caption: 'Changes in metabolism of terpenes and polyamines in response to salt stress
  and Si-biostimulant treatment. (A) A simplified representation of two main terpenes’
  biosynthesis pathways: mevalonate pathway, which takes place in the cytosol (green)
  and the mitochondria (brown), and the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP)
  pathway which occurs in the plasmid (blue). (B) The relative abundance of the measured
  terpenes across non-stressed controls (dark blue), salt stressed (light blue) and
  Si treated plants (red) is presented as pie charts of the molecular network cluster
  of terpenes and derivatives (see ). (C) An outline of polyamine synthesis pathways
  and corresponding graphs showing levels of spermidine and spermine across stressed
  controls (T1), salt stressed (T2) and Si treated plants (T3 and T5) at all time
  points. Abbreviations: DMADP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; MEP pathway, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  4-phosphate pathway; IDP, isopentenyl diphosphate; FDP, farnesyl diphosphate; GDP,
  geranyl diphosphate; GGDP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate.'
