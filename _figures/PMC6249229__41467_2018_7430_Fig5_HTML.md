caption: 13C metabolic flux analysis and RNASeq explain the overflow metabolism. Glycolysis
  and fermentation correlate with pathway gene upregulation in the CRA1 overexpression
  strain. Absolute specific flux rates per carbon atom (C-mmol g−1h −1) of control,
  CRA1 overexpression and Δcra1 strains are given from top to bottom. For reversible
  fluxes, only net fluxes are shown. Gene names of the corresponding reactions are
  colored green for transcriptionally upregulated, and black for unregulated genes
  in the CRA1 overexpression strain compared to the control. The insert table displays
  the respective log2 fold changes and adjusted p-values. NA means data did not meet
  filter criteria for p-value calculation (see Methods). Mean values of triplicate
  experiments for the control, overexpression and knock-out K. phaffii strains are
  presented. ± represents the standard deviation. Values of each reaction refer to
  the total number of carbon atoms involved in this reaction. For clarity of the figure,
  fluxes to CO2 are not shown
