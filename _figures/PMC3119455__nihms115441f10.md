caption: 'Effects of ROS, exemplified here by H2O2, on the genesis and survival of
  both osteoblasts and osteoclasts are depicted in black, and as shown require the
  same signaling cascades and factors, i.e. ERKs, NF-κB, and osteoclastogenic cytokines
  like Rankl, Tnf, and interleukin (IL) 6, used by estrogens to regulate the birth
  and death of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, albeit in the exactly opposite manner
  (, ). Like most other cell types, bone cells attempt to counteract the adverse effects
  of ROS by several defense mechanisms (depicted in blue). Such mechanisms include
  the up-regulation of ROS scavenging enzymes (superoxide dismutases and catalases)
  as well as DNA-damage repair genes by Forkhead transcription factors (FoxO; see
  accompanying article, Almeida et al. ()). Additionally, enzymes like glutathione
  peroxidase use glutathione to reduce ROS to alcohols. Glutathione reductase is a
  key partner in this cycle because it converts the disulfide (GSSG) back into glutathione
  (GSH). The pro-apoptotic effects of H2O2 on osteoblasts (and probably their mesenchymal
  stem cell progenitors) are associated with phosphorylation of p53 and p66shc. ROS
  decreases osteoblastogenesis by at least two mechanisms: 1) antagonism of Wnt signaling
  by diversion of β-catenin from Tcf- to FoxO-mediated transcription (see accompanying
  article, Almeida et al. ()); and 2) direct and sustained activation of ERKs and
  NF-κB (). ROS inhibit osteoclast apoptosis and stimulate osteoclastogenesis by increasing
  RANKL production in cells of the stromal/osteoblastic lineage () as well as an ERK/NF-κB/Tnf/interleukin
  6-mediated mechanism().E2 or DHT antagonizes the effects of ROS via several mechanisms(depicted
  in red): (a) up-regulation of GSR(and thioredoxin reductase activity (, ); (b) attenuation
  of p66shc phosphorylation via a Src- and ERK-dependent pathway; and (c) down-regulation
  of the production of osteoclastogenic cytokines like TNF and interleukin 6 via attenuation
  of NF-κB. In addition, E2 or DHT antagonizes the effects of ROS by attenuating osteoblast
  apoptosis and stimulating osteoclast apoptosis via a transient and sustained ERK
  activation, respectively; and by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, through a sustained
  ERK activation (). For the interplay between ROS and estrogens on osteoblastogenesis,
  see “Discussion.”'
