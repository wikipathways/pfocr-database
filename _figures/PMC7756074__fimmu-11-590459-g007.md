caption: The proposed model of the non-genomic actions of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3
  (1,25 D) in the lungs infected with SARS-CoV-2. The 1,25 D is a biologically active
  form of vitamin D that blocks the TNF induced NFkB1 activation. The 1,25 D binds
  with VDR and enhances the interaction between VDR-IKKβ, which prevents phosphorylation
  of IKKβ and formation of active IKK. Therefore, the degradation of IkB is blocked,
  resulting in preventing the translocation of NFkB1 to the nucleus. Consequently,
  the transcription and expression of NFkB1 target genes responsible for the cytokine
  storm are suppressed. In addition, 1,25 D enhances the IFN-α induced Jak-STAT signaling
  pathway. IFN-α activates the JAK1 and TYK2 signaling, which subsequently phosphorylate
  and activate the downstream targets STAT1 and STAT2. The 1,25 D binds with VDR and
  induces the dissociation between VDR-STAT1; thus, STAT1 is available for phosphorylation
  and formation of active TF complex ISGF3. The translocation of ISGF3 to the nucleus
  activates the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which provide
  antiviral activity and reduce the SARS-CoV-2 load in cells. The figure was adapted
