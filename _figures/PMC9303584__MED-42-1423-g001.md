caption: The molecular pathways in skin cancers. Objects highlighted in blue color
  symbolize RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, also known as the mitogen‐activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The oncogenes outlined in the green have been identified
  as the most common oncogenes with somatic mutations in skin cancer, especially melanoma.
  Presented pathways and steps, connected by arrows showing interdependencies, represent
  complex signaling pathways leading to cell proliferation or apoptosis [Color figure
