caption: IgD binds to IgDR, which may be upregulated by Lck activity by binding to
  Lck and phosphorylating the Tyr394 site of Lck. Phosphorylated-Lck activates ZAP70
  kinase and phosphorylates the Tyr319 site of ZAP70, further stimulating the activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway. IgD-Fc-Ig can competitively bind to IgDR, inhibit
  the expression of Lck and ZAP70, and inhibit the activation of the NF-ĸB signaling
  pathway even further, thereby regulating the abnormal proliferation, differentiation,
  and activation of T cells.
