caption: The adenosine deaminase (ADA) metabolism. ADA is an enzyme of the purine
  salvage pathway, which catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine
  into inosine and 2′-deoxyinosine, respectively. Most adenosine derives from endogenous
  breakdown of ATP and degradation of RNA, or is taken up exogenously by ubiquitously
  expressed nucleoside transporters. Unlike adenosine, 2′-deoxyadenosine is formed
  by DNA degradation is predominantly catabolized by ADA. Further conversion of inosine
  nucleoside leads to hypoxanthine, which can either enter a non-reversible pathway
  to uric acid or salvaged back into other mononucleosides. In the absence of ADA,
  the presence of these alternative “bypass” pathways results in normal concentrations
  of the catabolic products of the enzyme reaction in patients with ADA-SCID. Conversely,
  the levels of ADA substrates, adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine, are not only found
  in increased amounts in extracellular body fluids, but they also “spill over” into
  additional pathways normally only minimally utilized, thus contributing to the pathogenic
  mechanisms of the disease.
