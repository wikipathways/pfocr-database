caption: Basal ganglia modifications in ASD. Basal ganglia network is shown to be
  deeply affected in ASD models. The main alterations are found at 4 points of interest
  (A,B,C,D). Striatal local inhibition mediated by PV interneurons. (A) is altered
  in some ASD models like Shank1−/− and Shank3B−/− mice [], VPA mice [] or Cntnap2−/−
  mice []. Responsible of feed-forward inhibition, alteration of these interneurons
  may lead to altered MSNs’ functionality. Interestingly, corticostriatal pathway
  (B) is widely described as altered in ASD models. For instance, in Ngln−/− mice,
  Ngln3−/− mice, Shank3−/− mice [] or Shank2−/− rats [], alterations of the glutamatergic
  transmission onto MSNs are reported. Thus, alterations of plasticity were also highlighted
  in Shank3e4-22−/− mice []. However, the dichotomy between direct and indirect pathway
  allows to highlight some pathway-specific alteration. On the one hand, some alterations
  were found to be specific of the indirect pathway (C), like an increase of DRD2
  expression in the striatum, leading to a dopaminergic imbalance in favor of the
  indirect pathway [,]. On the other hand, some alterations were found to be specific
  to the direct pathway (D) as alteration of synaptic transmission has been highlighted
  in DRD1 MSNs but not DRD2 in NL3-cKO mice []. Thus, in Nlgn1−/− mice, the AMPA/NMDA
  ratio was found to be reduced specifically in direct pathway MSNs [], leading to
  an altered response.
