caption: Model for complement system activation and regulation. The complement system
  is a vital component of the innate immune response and can become activated via
  one of three pathways – the classical pathway (CP), the lectin pathway (LP), or
  the alternative pathway (AP). The CP is activated when a circulating C1 complex
  recognizes and binds the Fc region of an antigen-antibody complex. This interaction
  activates proteases within the C1 complex to cleave C4 into C4a and C4b fragments,
  and C2 into C2a and C2b fragments. C4b can covalently bind to nearby surfaces, and
  C2b can bind to the surface-bound C4b to form C4b2b, a C3 convertase. The LP is
  activated when a circulating mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolin complex recognizes
  and binds pathogen-specific sugar residues. This interaction activates proteases
  within the MBL complex to cleave C4 into C4a and C4b fragments, and C2 into C2a
  and C2b fragments, once again forming C4b2b, the C3 convertase common to both the
  CP and the LP activation pathways. The AP is unique in that it does not require
  the presence of specific microbial or “danger” signals to become activated. Instead,
  the AP maintains a low level of constitutive activation. Successful AP activation
  occurs when activating surfaces are unregulated, as healthy host cells are protected
  from complement-deposition by binding regulatory proteins. AP constitutive activation
  involves spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 into C3a and the C3b-like molecule C3(H2O)
  in a process called “tick-over”. Factor B binds to C3(H2O), and cleavage of the
  bound Factor B by Factor D produces C3(H2O)Bb, the soluble C3 convertase of the
  AP. All C3 convertases cleave C3 into C3a and C3b fragments, and C3b can covalently
  bind to nearby surfaces. Factor B can bind to surface-bound C3b molecules and be
  cleaved by Factor D to form C3bBb, the membrane-bound C3 convertase of the AP. This
  convertase can be bound by properdin to dramatically increase the half-life of this
  enzyme. Because Factor B can bind to C3b originating from any activation pathway,
  any C3b bound to a receptive surface will be amplified via this AP pathway. The
  composition of this C3 convertase allows for an efficient cycle of C3b generation
  and C3 convertase formation that can substantially amplify the complement response
  irrespective of which pathway initiated the response. The terminal complement cascade
  is common to all activation pathways and leads to the formation of the membrane
  attack complex (MAC). In large numbers, MACs can disrupt target cell membranes and
  cause cell death via osmotic lysis and/or loss of membrane integrity. Given the
  potent pro-inflammatory immune response produced by complement activation, this
  system must be tightly regulated to prevent unintentional damage to healthy host
  cells. Regulatory proteins that dampen complement activation and propagation are
  displayed in red, and regulators that enhance complement are shown in green.
