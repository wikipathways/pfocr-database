caption: 'In the amyloidogenic pathway, the ectodomain shedding of the full length
  APP (flAPP) by BACE yields the immediate GSEC substrate, APPC99. GSEC endopeptidase
  cleavage of APPC99 generates APP intracellular domain (AICD50‐99 or AICD49‐99) and
  a “de novo” generated Aβ substrate (Aβ48 or Aβ49, respectively). While the AICDs
  are released, the Aβ48 and Aβ49 are subjected to subsequent GSEC proteolysis (carboxypeptidase‐like
  γ‐cleavages).GSEC structure with co‐purifying helical peptide (PDB: 5FN3) is presented.
  PSEN1 is shown in light brown, PEN‐2 in dark brown, APH1A in gold, NCT in green,
  and the co‐purifying helical peptide in red. The topology of the helical peptide
  (putative GSEC substrate) is indicated by the amino and carboxyl terminal groups.
  The interface between the N‐terminal part of the helical peptide, the NCT ectodomain
  and PSEN1 is magnified, and NCT side chains are shown.'
