caption: Metabolic overview of the Acetobacterium genus. Major metabolic pathways
  have been biochemically and genetically verified in Acetobacterium woodii, and predicted
  metabolisms are based upon the presence of each operon and similarity of predicted
  amino acid sequences. Pathways and accessory components framed in blue are encoded
  by all sequenced Acetobacterium strains. Pathways denoted in red are found in only
  a subset of Acetobacterium strains. Metabolic pathways denoted in green (e.g., glycine
  betaine, caffeate, and 2,3-butanediol) are linked to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway.
