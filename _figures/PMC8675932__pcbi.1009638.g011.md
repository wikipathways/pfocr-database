caption: (A) In presence of Retinoid Acid (RA) the RAR/RXR complex recruits Nuclear
  CoActivators (NCOA), activating the transcription of the downstream gene. (B) In
  absence of RA the RAR/RXR complex recruits Nuclear CoRepressors (NCOR) instead,
  blocking the transcription of the downstream gene. (C) Protein-protein interactions
  among the genes involved in the RAR/RXR pathway, common interactions with other
  genes are not shown for clarity. Genes colored in the same way are WGD copies of
  a common ancestral gene.
