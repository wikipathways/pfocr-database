caption: Dysregulation of TGF-β/BMP signaling in CCM. Mutant CCM release the inhibition
  of MEEK3/ERK pathway, which trigger the expression of KLF2/4. KLF2/4 subsequently
  suppress the expression of endothelial markers and induce the expression of EndMT-related
  molecules. KLF4 could also transcriptionally upregulate BMP6 to active TGF-β/BMP
  cascades in ECs. Besides, activation of TLR4 associated with CD14 by Gram-negative
  bacteria and lipopolysaccharide injection could increase the expression of Klf2/4
  and promote CCM formation.
