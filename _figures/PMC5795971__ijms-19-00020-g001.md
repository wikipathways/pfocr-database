caption: 'Model of neuronal CaMKII-PP1 signaling. (1) CaMKII-PP1 signaling in PSDs:
  CaMKII is simultaneously bound by Ca2+/CaM following a Ca2+ stimulus. In this condition,
  one subunit acts as a substrate for the other, resulting in Thr286 phosphorylation.
  Once that subunit is phosphorylated, subsequent phosphorylation within the holoenzyme
  is more likely to occur, as Ca2+ levels required for the second phosphorylation
  are lower than those required for the initial phosphorylation (sustained activity).
  Thus, CaMKII remains active, even when basal Ca2+ levels are re-established, until
  it is dephosphorylated by PP1. CaMKII activity is sustained if the number of phosphorylated
  subunits exceeds a threshold and the phosphorylation rate exceeds the dephosphorylation
  rate. (2) Role of CaMKII/PP1 signaling in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport: Under basal
  conditions, CaMKIIδ3 is autonomously active in part due to spontaneous neuronal
  activity. Cytoplasmic CaMKIIδ3 is autophosphorylated, and D2R-mediated PP1 activation
  mediates CaMKIIδ3 dephosphorylation at Ser332. For example, stimulation with a dopamine
  D2R agonist increases PP1 activity by inactivating the cAMP/PKA/inhibitor 1 (I-1)
  pathway, and in turn PP1 dephosphorylates CaMKIIδ3 at Ser332 in the cytoplasm, enabling
  its nuclear translocation. Thereafter, nuclear CaMKII3 phosphorylates transcription
  factors, including MeCP2 and CREB, increasing BDNF expression. Depolarization causes
  Ca2+ entry into neurons through NMDA receptors or voltage-dependent calcium channels
  and promotes CaMKIIδ3 autophosphorylation at Thr287 and Ser332 in the cytosol. Conversely,
  nuclear CaMKI or CaMKIV activity may promote CaMKIIδ3 nuclear export via Ser332
  phosphorylation.'
