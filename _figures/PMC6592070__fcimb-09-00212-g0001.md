caption: The cAMP/PKA pathway in S. cerevisiae is dually activated by glucose via
  one mechanism involving glycolysis and the Ras-cAMP pathway proteins, and a second
  pathway of glucose sensing via the G-protein coupled receptor Gpr1. Glycolysis generates
  fructose-1,6-bis-phosphate which activates the Ras nucleotide exchange factor Cdc25
  which in turn activates the GTPases Ras1 and Ras2. These proteins are inactivated
  by the GAPs Ira1 and Ira2. GTP-bound Ras1 and Ras2 promote cAMP production via activation
  of the adenylyl cyclase Cyr1. Gpr1 senses external glucose and acts via the GTPase
  Gpa2 to stimulate adenylyl cyclase Cyr1 to produce cAMP. Elevated cAMP promotes
  the dissociation of the catalytic (Tpk1, 2, 3) and regulatory (Bcy1) subunits of
  PKA leading to activation of PKA and downstream signaling. The phosphodiesterases
  Pde1 and Pde2 control intracellular cAMP levels by degradation. The subcellular
  distribution of Bcy1 is regulated by Yak1-dependent phosphorylation and oligomerization
  of D/D domains of Bcy1 results in a tetrameric structure of allowing interactions
  with putative AKAPs (i.e., Hsp60, Ira2, and Zds1). Transceptor proteins mediate
  PKA activation independent of changes in cAMP levels in response to ammonium (NH4+),
  amino acids (a.a.), phosphate (PO43−), sulfate (SO42−), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn).
