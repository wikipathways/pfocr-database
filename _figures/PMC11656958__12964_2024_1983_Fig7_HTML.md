caption: Schematic diagram depicting that STING exerts antiviral innate immune response
  by activating pentose phosphate pathway. DNA virus infection activates the PPP in
  host cells, thereby initiating STING-mediated antiviral immune response. STING interacts
  with TKT, a key enzyme in the non-oxidative branch of the PPP, and reduces its ubiquitination
  via the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3A, stabilizing TKT and upregulating PPP
