caption: Immunogenic effects of radiation therapy. Radiation can augment anti-tumour
  immunity in several ways. Damage and death of cancer cells leads to release of tumour
  neoantigens and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as calreticulin,
  high motility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, and ATP which activate dendritic cells
  (DCs) to prime and stimulate CD8+ T cells responsible for cancer cell detection
  and elimination. Moreover, radiation can increase the expression and alter the array
  of peptides presented on major histocompatibility (MHC) class I proteins, which
  CD8+ T cells use to identify transformed cells. Radiation-induced DNA damage can
  activate the cGAS-STING pathway leading to type I interferon production which enhances
  CD8+ T cell activity. Beyond local effects, radiation may induce systemic anti-tumour
  immunity if tumour-specific CD8+ T cells migrate to metastatic lesions; regression
  of distant tumour cells outside the radiation field is known as the abscopal effect.
