caption: Schematic illustration of generic biosynthetic pathways of PMLA in microorganisms.
  Using glucose as carbon source, it is converted into phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate
  by glycolysis, both finally producing malate in the cytoplasm via the reductive
  pathway. In parallel, pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria, is oxidized
  and decarboxylated to form acetyl-CoA, and then joins the TCA cycle. After acetyl-CoA
  condenses with oxaloacetate to form citric acid, it undergoes a series of enzymatic
  reactions to produce malate via the oxidative pathway. Alternatively, a shortcut,
  the glyoxylate shunt, utilizing glyoxylate as an intermediate can bypass the TCA
  cycle to produce malates. Malates produced inside mitochondria are transported to
  the cytoplasm through a dicarboxylate transporter, where PMLA synthetase finally
  polymerizes them into PMLA
