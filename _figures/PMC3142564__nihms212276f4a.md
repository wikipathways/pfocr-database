caption: Figure 4a. Differential functions of p110α and p110β isoforms. p110α is the
  major effector downstream of RTKs and p110β is an effector for both RTKs and GPCRs.
  Their differential roles in many biological functions are indicated. Many of these
  roles are associated with cancer (solid lines). An association between chronic inflammation
  and cancer has been indicated (dashed line). RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; GPCR,
  G-protein coupled receptor.Figure 4b. Schematic of PI3K isoform-selective inhibition
  in the treatment of cancers featuring specific oncogenic lesions. Recent studies
  point to p110β as a primary target for PTEN-deficient cancers. However, in the case
  oncogenic lesions such as RTK amplification or mutation, Ras mutation, or activating
  PIK3CA mutations, the PI3K signaling largely depends on p110α, perhaps even in the
  absence of PTEN. RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor;
  PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue. PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate;
  PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate.
