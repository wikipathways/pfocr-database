caption: 'Tumor-associated neutrophil oncogenic mechanisms. TANs can promote tumor
  progression through many mechanisms, including inducing tumorigenesis, proliferation,
  and recurrence; enhancing tumor invasion and metastasis; and fostering angiogenesis.
  a Tumorigenesis, proliferation, and recurrence. TANs can expel NETs, wherein NE
  and MMP-9 can degrade laminin, activate α3β1 integrin signaling, or directly release
  oxylipins to awaken dormant cancer cells. The release of ROS, NO, and MPO by N2
  TANs can induce DNA damage. The S100A8/A9 protein secreted by TANs can promote the
  release of MPO and oxylipins; therefore, tumor progression can be inhibited by targeting
  S100A8/A9. NE derived from TANs mediates the degradation of IRS-1 in the endosomes
  of tumor cells and promotes tumor proliferation by regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. b Tumor invasion and metastasis. TANs promote tumor cell proliferation
  and distant metastasis through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. N2 TANs can enhance
  distant metastasis and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells through the IL-10/c-Met/STAT3
  signaling pathway, thereby promoting the polarization of TANs toward the N2 phenotype.
  FAM3C released by TANs promotes EMT through the JNK-ZEB1/Snail signaling pathway.
  The secretion of MMP-9, VEGFA, IL-12, and TNF-α in TANs can also promote LMNs and
  premetastatic niches. Tumor cells promote the expression of β2-integrin in neutrophils
  by secreting IL-8, which, in turn, binds to ICAM-1 and promotes the transendothelial
  migration of CTCs. One of the therapeutic directions is to target pathways that
  promote tumor metastasis via TANs. c Angiogenesis. TANs produce NETs and factors
  such as VEGF, NE, and MMP-9, accompanied by the hydrolysis of Tsp-1 by NE, to drive
  tumor angiogenesis. (Abbreviations: NE neutrophils elastase, NETs neutrophil extracellular
  traps, MMP matrix metalloproteinase, MPO myeloperoxidase, LNM lymph node metastasis,
