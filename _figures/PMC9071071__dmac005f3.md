caption: Epigenetic mechanisms of early programming of reproductive function. The
  upper panel shows the proposed roles of PcG and TrxG regulatory factors on the E1
  for regulation of the pubertal transition. Activity of Kiss1 promoter is defined
  by the balance between PcG and TrxG regulatory components. A predominance of PcG
  elements during the juvenile period down-regulates Kiss1 expression, while removal
  of PcG factors EDD and CBX7 during pubertal transition, together with recruitment
  of TrxG elements at the Kiss1 promoter, changes the chromatin landscape into a permissive
  configuration, leading to increased Kiss1 transcription and puberty onset. The middle
  panel is a schematic of the epigenetic mechanisms for metabolic modulation of Kiss1
  expression at puberty. Early postnatal overnutrition causes a premature eviction
  of the repressors, SIRT1 and EED, from the Kiss1 promoter. Conversely, early undernutrition
  is linked to persistence of SIRT1 and EED at the Kiss1 promoter, thereby causing
  suppression of Kiss1 expression. In the lower left panel, the proposed mechanism
  for the effects of EDCs, such as bisphenol A, on reproductive function is depicted.
  Besides transcriptional control via binding to sex steroid receptors, such as ER,
  early exposures to EDCs can also alter DNMT expression and the activity of histone
  acetyltransferases in the hypothalamus, and evoke changes in the subcellular location
  of Tet2, involved in the initiation of DNA demethylation, which modify histone tail
  methylation. EDCs can also affect hypothalamic expression of Kiss1 and ERα, via
  modulation of PcG members, EED and CBX-7. Finally, in the lower right panel, the
  proposed regulation by neonatal exposures to androgens or estrogens of the miRNA
  pathway, Lin28/Lin28B, as putative modulator of puberty, is depicted. CBX-7, chromobox
  protein homolog 7; DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; E1, kiss1 promoter; EDCs, endocrine
