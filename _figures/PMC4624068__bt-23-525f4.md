caption: 'Proposed mechanism of Vit C-mediated increase in ceramide production in
  human keratinocyte (KC). Vit C supplementation increases epidermal ceramide production
  by three pathways: i) increased de novo ceramide synthesis pathway due to activations
  of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) and ceramide synthase (CerS); ii) sphingomyelin
  (SM) hydrolysis via substrate regulation of constitutively expressed sphingomyelinases
  (SMases); iii) increased sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) hydrolysis by sphingosine-1-phosphate
  phosphatase (SPPase) to produce sphingosine (SO), followed by ceramide synthesis
  by CerS.'
