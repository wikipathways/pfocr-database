caption: (A) Schematic representation of methionine uptake and utilization by nucleic
  acids and proteins under pathologic and physiologic conditions. Various enzymes
  governing the process are provided. (B) Chromosomal location of various enzymes
  involved in methionine regulation is shown in red. (C) Heat map provides the disease
  associations with genes that are mapped in methionine pathway.
