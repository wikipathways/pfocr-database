caption: Wnt/β-catenin pathway and associated ncRNAs. When the Wnt signaling pathway
  is not effectively inhibited by Dickkopf (DKK) or Wnt inhibitory protein (WIF),
  which interact with lipoprotein receptor-related 5/6 (LRP5/6) to disrupt LRP5/6
  and Frizzled (FZD) receptor dimers, Wnt proteins are able to bind to their FZD receptors,
  leading to dimerization of FZD and LRP5/6 receptors. The formation of FZD/LRP heterodimers
  induces a conformational change in the receptors, leading to the binding of the
  cytoplasmic portion of FZD to disheveled (DVL) and phosphorylation of the LRP5/6
  tail by GSK3. This phosphorylation event facilitates the recruitment of the scaffold
  protein Axin. DVL serves as a platform for enhanced interaction between Axin and
  the LRP5/6 tail. The interaction between Axin, LRP5/6, and DVL disrupts the Destructive
  Complex (DC), releasing β-catenin. Subsequently, β-catenin translocates into the
  nucleus, where it displaces corepressor Groucho/transducin with TCF/LEF to form
  a complex that mediates gene expression. The destruction complex (DC), composed
  of Axin, adenomatous polyposis (APC), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and casein
  kinase 1ɑ (CK1ɑ), functions to maintain β-catenin in an inactive state through phosphorylation
  by CK1ɑ, facilitating GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin. Subsequent phosphorylation
  of β-catenin leads to recruitment of β-transducin repeat containing protein (β-Trcp),
  an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes ubiquitination of β-catenin for degradation.
  The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is also regulated by various ncRNAs
