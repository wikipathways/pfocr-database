caption: RPL26 is one of the main ufmylation substrates. This ufmylation event tunes
  ER ribosome turnover and controls biogenesis of secreted proteins. In addition,
  deficiency in ufmylation feeds back to alter the expression of transcripts of extracellular
  matrix components. The mechanisms behind this regulation are unknown but could result
  in further imbalance in ER protein load because collagen proteins are the most abundant
  ER cargo. Another way for ufmylation to control ER stress would be through the targeting
  of transcription factors involved in ER proteostasis. Indeed ufmylation events at
  the nucleus are possible following the relocalization of UFL1. The remodeling of
  chromatin by ufmylation to alter transcriptional programs also appears as an exciting
  possibility. Histone ufmylation has been connected to the DNA damage response but
  it is likely that other functions are related to this type of regulation. Lastly,
  ufmylation components such as UFBP1 promote ER expansion and reorganization, which
  could be involved in the collapse and cell death observed in cells with high secretory
  activity and deficient for ufmylation components.
