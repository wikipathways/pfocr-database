caption: 'Schematic representation of the lactate metabolism pathway of broiler muscle
  affected with wooden breast (WB) myopathy (B) compared to normal breast muscle (A).
  Glucose is transported to the cell cytosol by the glucose transporter (Glut), and
  then is converted to pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis. Under normoxic conditions
  (Figure ), pyruvate enters the mitochondria and produces 38 ATPs per oxidized glucose
  molecule, including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), and oxidative
  phosphorylation. In WB muscle, oxygen delivery is limited (hypoxia, Figure ). The
  activity of TCA cycle is decreased and the pyruvate switches to the fermentation
  pathway, resulting in the production of lactate by the action of lactate dehydrogenase
  A (LDHA). The lactate can be re-oxidized to pyruvate by LDHB activity, or it can
  be transported out of the cell by the monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4). On the
  other hand, MCT1 uptakes the lactate from the circulatory system into cells. Hatched
  arrows denote the possible fates for lactate in WB cells. In this model, increased
  levels of LDHB and MCT4 are the principal proteins that regulate lactate concentrations
  in the WB cells (Figure ). Glut: glucose transporter. LDH: Lactate dehydrogenase.
  MCT: Monocarboxylate transporter. TCA: tricarboxylic acid.'
