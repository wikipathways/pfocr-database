caption: Endocytosis of Hxt6 induced by distinct signals. (A) Hxt6 degradation induced
  by glucose addition to cells grown on glucose limiting conditions is controlled
  by the Snf1/AMPK pathway. In glucose-limiting conditions, Hxt6 and Rod1/Art4 are
  inactive. Glucose addition triggers PP1 phosphatase (Glc7/Reg1) activation, resulting
  in Snf1 dephosphorylation and the release of Rod1 from 14 to 3-3 proteins. Rod1
  is then continuously ubiquitylated by Rsp5 , , but Ubp2 and Ubp15 lead to Rod1 deubiquitylation,
  preventing its subsequent proteasomal degradation . Rod1-Rsp5 complexes promote
  the transporter ubiquitylation and its subsequently degradation in the vacuole ,
  . (B) Hxt6 internalization in response to prolonged growth in glucose starvation
  conditions. During prolonged growth in glucose starvation conditions (e.g., growth
  in lactic acid, 0.5%, w/v, pH 5.0, for 24 h), Snf1 kinase is active and inhibits
  Mig1/Mig2 repressors by phosphorylation, preventing them from binding to CRS2 promoter
  and resulting in CRS2 derepression. The increase in CRS2 transcription elevates
  Crs2 protein levels and the consequent formation of Rsp5-Crs2 complexes. This ultimately
  leads to Hxt6 ubiquitylation and degradation through the MVB pathway. In contrast,
  upon a pulse of glucose (2%, w/v), PP1 phosphatase (Glc7/Reg1) dephosphorylates
  and inactivates Snf1, which can no longer phospho-inhibit Mig1/Mig2, resulting in
  CRS2 repression. At the posttranslational level, Crs2 protein is inactivated by
  phosphorylation, possibly by PKA kinase, leading to its association with 14–3-3
  proteins and its deubiquitylation . Ub, ubiquitylation; P, phosphorylation; PM,
  plasma membrane. Dashed lines represent predicted regulation and signals (+) and
  (-) represent activation and inhibition, respectively.
