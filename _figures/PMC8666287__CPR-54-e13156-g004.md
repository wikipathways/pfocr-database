caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the mechanism of osteoblast‐induced regulation
  of cholesterol synthesis in chondrocytes. The red lines point to the Notch1 signalling
  pathway elucidated in the current study, and the red dotted lines indicate potential
  mechanisms that were not assessed in the present study. Osteoblasts inhibited ncstn
  expression in chondrocytes and reduced its binding to Notch receptors, resulting
  in a decrease in the expression of hey1 downstream of the Notch signalling pathway.
  Finally, cholesterol metabolism in chondrocytes was inhibited. ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  hey1, Hes‐related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1; ncstn, nicastrin
