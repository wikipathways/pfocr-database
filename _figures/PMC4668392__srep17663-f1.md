caption: Cytokine receptors, especially receptors for IL-6 family cytokines, are the
  most well-known traditional activators of STAT3. Receptor tyrosine kinases, non-Receptor
  tyrosine kinases and some serine kinases can also regulate the STAT3 activity. Recently,
  studies found that GPCRs and TLRs are involved in the regulation of STAT3. Cadherin
  engagement accompanied with the high level of Rac1/Cdc42 also dramatically regulates
  STAT3 through activating the NF-κB signal pathway. SOCS inhibits STAT3 signaling
  via blockade of upstream signaling through interactions with gp130 and JAK family
  members. Various miRNAs either restrict or enhance STAT3 signaling. PTPases dephosphorylate
  STAT3 and prevents dimer formation. PIAS proteins directly compete with STAT3 for
  either binding opportunities with the activating receptor or for dimerization and
  translocation into the nucleus.
