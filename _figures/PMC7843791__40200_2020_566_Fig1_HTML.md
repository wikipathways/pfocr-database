caption: 'Reappraisal of Glucose Metabolism in Cytoplasm; Effect of Insulin Action.
  a The Current Model of Intermediary Metabolism: Glucose is first oxidised in the
  cytoplasm to pyruvate. In the presence of O2 pyruvate enters the mitochondria to
  be oxidised to CO2. In the absence of O2 pyruvate is reduced to lactate to regenerate
  NAD+ required for the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3phosphate (GA3P) to increase
  the flux of glucose oxidation to produce energy in times of intense cellular activity.
  b Insulin Activates the Inorganic Phosphate (Pi) Dependent Fluxes of Hexose Phosphates
  During Biosynthesis: During proliferation, cells utilise the glycogen hydrolysis
  for increasing the flux to glucose 6-phosphae (G6P) to produce pentose sugars and
  NADPH to maintain the redox homeostasis. Insulin induced Pi uptake activates the
  glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and produces the glucose 1-phosphae (G1P), which is
  the branch point between glycogen synthase (GS) and GP. Insulin inhibits GSK3β by
  activating the PI3K- Akt pathway and which increases flux of G1P to G6P, which is
  metabolised either in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) or converted to Fructose
  1 phosphate (Fr-1P) in the canonical glycolysis. A bifunctional enzyme, the Fructose2,6
  bisphosphate kinase2 (PFK2)/ Fructose2,6 bisphosphate phosphatase (PFK2/FBP2) phosphorylates
  the accumulating Fr6P and produces the Fr2,6 bis phosphate (Fr2,6BP). Fr2,6BP activates
  Fructose1,6 bisphosphate kinase1 (PFK1), which phosphorylates the Fr6P to produce
  Fr 1,6 bisphosphate (Fr1,6 BP). Fr1,6 BP has a feedforward effect on the pyruvate
  kinase (PK) and increases the activity of PK. In proliferative cells tyrosine kinases
  and ROS convert the PK to an enzymatically inactive form PKM2. The PPP has two branches,
  the oxidative (oxPPP) and the non-oxidative PPP. G6P is oxidised in oxPPP to produce
  the 5carbon ribulose -5 phosphate (RuP), NADPH and Co2, RuP is converted to ribose
  phosphate, Fr6P and the GA3P by a complex network of enzymes in non-oxidative PPP.
  The transaldolase and transketolase family of enzymes produce two Fr6P and three
  GA3P. Fr1,6 BP is hydrolysed to GA3P and the dihydroxy acetone phosphate (DHAP);
  the triose isomerase interconverts the two triosephosphates to increase the flux
  of GA3P. The tumour suppressor p53 produces the TP53 induced glycolysis and apoptosis
  regulator (TIGAR), which inhibits the kinase activity of PFK2/FBP2 and reduces the
  flux of carbons in glycolysis and increase the reverse flux of triose phosphates
  into the non-oxidative PPP. Glutamine/ glucosamine activates a parallel hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP). The inhibition of the PFK2/FBP2 reduces the flux of
  Fr6P to Fr1,6BP (see Fig. ), which activates the glycosylation of several membrane
  proteins and the transcription factors to activate the nutrient transporters and
  the transcription factors (see Fig. )'
