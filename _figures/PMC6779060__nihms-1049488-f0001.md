caption: Schematic diagram depicting the mechanisms involved in the induction of SSc-associated
  tissue fibrosis by cellular senescence and ROS-mediated oxidative stress and in
  the establishment of an autocrine/paracrine vicious cycle responsible for the progression
  and persistence of the fibrotic process. 1. Release of TGF-β from the latent TGF-β
  binding protein, followed by its activation and binding to cognate TGF-β receptors.
  2. Stimulation of transcription of the NOX4 gene leading to increased NOX4 and to
  increased ROS production. 3. Elevated ROS levels induce oxidative stress in the
  target cells as well as phenotypic changes in fibroblasts and endothelial cells
  causing their conversion into activated myofibroblasts. 4. Oxidative stress induces
  morphological and functional changes of cellular senescence. 5. Senescent cells
  express the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). 6–9.The components
  of the SASP induce phenotypic changes in fibroblasts (6), endothelial cells (7)
  and monocytes (8). The monocytes become activated M2 profibrotic macrophages that
  further increase the fibrotic process (9). 10. The activated macrophages produce
  and secrete TGF-β and interferons and various interferon-related molecules. The
  secreted TGF-β and interferon related products close the vicious cycle and allow
  establishment of an autocrine/paracrine pathway that is responsible for the initiation,
  and progression of tissue fibrosis in SSc.
