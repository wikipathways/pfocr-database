caption: Schematic representation of the common signal-transduction pathways leading
  to pathogen-induced systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and rhizosphere-mediated
  induced systemic resistance (ISR) inspired by [] for Arabidopsis thaliana but applicable
  to plants in general. Crosstalk between the two pathways occurs through the activation
  of NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1 (NPR1). Non-pathogenic plant-associated
  microbes, usually from the rhizosphere, can trigger the SAR pathway as well as ISR.
  In the rhizosphere-mediated ISR pathway, components from the jasmonic acid (JA)
  and ethylene (ET) responses act in sequence to activate a systemic resistance response
  (orange arrows). Pathogenic agents could activate the pathogen-induced SAR, through
  the activation of NPR1 (blue arrows), leading to the expression of PATHOGENESIS-RELATED
  genes (PRs) (black arrow). NPR1 also mediates crosstalk between the SA signaling
  pathway.
