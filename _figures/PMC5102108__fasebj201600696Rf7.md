caption: Hypothetical model of macrophage-to-Huh7 cell transmission of TLR3-induced
  anti-HCV activity by exosomes. In the presence of poly I:C (1), the TLR3 pathway
  is activated in macrophages (2), leading to the induction of multiple cellular factors,
  including antiviral miRNAs (3). After exporting out of the nucleus (4), miRNAs were
  selectively incorporated into exosomes, which are contained in the multivesicular
  body (5). The multivesicular body then fuses with the plasma membrane, leading to
  secretion of exosomes into the extracellular space (6). Exosomes subsequently bind
  to plasma membrane and enter into a Huh7 cell (7). Recruited exosomes release antiviral
  miRNAs into the cytosol of Huh7 cell (8), where they either activate cellular anti-HCV
  response or directly target HCV gene expression (9, 10). ISG, IFN-stimulated genes;
  miR-RISC, miR-RNA induced silencing complex.
