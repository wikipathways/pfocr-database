caption: Fundamental metabolic differences in mitotic and non-mitotic cells. To support
  the demands of proliferation, dividing cells take up more glucose and amino acids
  such as glutamine, which provide the carbon and nitrogen sources for catabolic processes
  and biosynthetic reactions. The pentose phosphate pathway (light green) regenerates
  NADPH, which provides reducing power to biosynthesis and to combat oxidative stress,
  and branches into nucleotide biosynthetic and NAD(P)+ synthesis pathways. The hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (light blue) produces UDP-Glc(Gal)NAc, which is important for
  glycosylation reactions that regulate protein folding and for O-GlcNAcylation. Although
  the glycerol backbone of phospholipids is synthesized via the glycolytic precursor
  dihydroxacetone phosphate (DHAP) via the glycerolipid synthesis pathway (brown),
  the fatty acyl chains can be synthesized via carbon engendered in the Krebs cycle.
  The serine biosynthesis pathway (yellow) is also important for serine and glycine
  synthesis and the formation of methyl donors such as methylene tetrahydrofolate
  and for NADPH regeneration. Figure adapted from ref.
