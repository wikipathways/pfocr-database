caption: Systemic and renal iron homeostasis. Dietary iron is absorbed at the apical
  membrane of enterocytes, Fe3+ is converted to Fe2+ by DCYTB or other metal reductases
  and transported into the cytoplasm by DMT1. Heme is transported via HCP1 and/or
  HRG1, and then catabolized by HO1 to release Fe2+. Cytosolic iron is exported into
  the blood by FPN1 which is located at the basolateral membrane of enterocytes. The
  majority of circulating iron (>90%) is recycled in macrophages, by engulfing senescent
  red blood cells. Circulating iron binds to the carrier protein TF. The liver senses
  fluctuations in iron and inflammation, thereby synthesizes and secretes hepcidin
  to induce internalization and degradation of FPN1. BMP/SMAD and IL6/STAT3 signaling
  pathway are 2 of the major pathways maintaining hepcidin transcription. Hypoxia
  stimulates the kidneys to produce EPO, which enables iron utilization for erythropoiesis
  in the bone marrow. The hormone ERFE is produced by erythropoietic progenitor cells
  to inhibit hepcidin synthesis. Proximal and distal tubule epithelial cells reabsorb
  TBI via TFR1 from the tubular lumen, NTBI is transported into the cytosol by DMT1,
  zinc transporter ZIP8 and/or ZIP14. Proximal tubule epithelial cells also take up
  heme and TBI through the megalin/cubilin complex. NGALR locates on distal tubule
  epithelial cells utilize to bind NGAL as a form of NTBI. HO1 is expressed in proximal
  tubule epithelial cells driven by HIF1α, to catabolize heme. Proximal tubule epithelial
  cells expressed FPN1 is more suggested to localize at the basolateral membrane,
  while some studies showed the apical localization of FPN1. Image was created with
