caption: Cellular mechanisms of CAR-T-cell therapy triggering CRS. IL-6 trans-signaling
  promoted the expansion and antitumor activity of CAR-T cells via the GP130/STAT3
  pathway, while apoptosis and pyroptosis were found in tumor cells after CAR-T-cell
  therapy; monocytes, endogenous T cells, endothelial cells, and granulocyte were
  all activated
