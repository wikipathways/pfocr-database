caption: Simplified illustration of the effects of IIS and TOR pathway components
  on physiological, developmental and behavioral traits in the pollen hoarding syndrome.
  Components of both pathways have been identified as positional candidate genes influencing
  different aspects of worker phenotype (traits in italics). Experimental tests have
  confirmed (traits in bold) or excluded (traits struck through) a direct relationship
  between a few of the candidate genes and the traits.
