caption: Glycolysis pathway. Glucose is converted to pyruvate through sequential enzymatic
  reactions occurring in the cytosol. Intermediates of this process can be further
  metabolised to yield precursors for synthesis of nucleic acids, lipids and amino
  acids, which are critically required for T‐cell clonal expansion. Pyruvate can be
  either oxidized in the mitochondria to drive the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle;
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and ATP generation, or reduced to lactate and
  excreted. The latter is favoured in proliferating T cells to maintain high rates
  of glycolysis and precursor molecule generation.
