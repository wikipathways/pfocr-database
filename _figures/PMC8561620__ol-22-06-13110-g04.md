caption: Proposed model for Wnt/β-catenin signaling and HMGA2 interactions. Wnt activates
  canonical β-catenin signaling, which upregulates HMGA2 expression and self-renewal
  by induction of cell cycle proliferation. Transfection with siRNA-Wnt and siRNA-β-catenin
  decrease HMGA2 expression. HMGA2 regulates several genes that are closely associated
  with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by directly binding to their promoters, thereby activating
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Transfection with siRNA-HMGA2 decreases the expression
  levels of β-catenin, CDK4 and cyclin D1. Black dashed arrows and red blocking bars
  represent a possible mechanism of HMGA2 action and/or loss of β-catenin transcriptional
  activity. HMGA2, high mobility group AT-hook 2; si, small interfering; CDK4, cyclin-dependent
