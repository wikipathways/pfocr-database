caption: Model depicting the role of the Hog1 SAPK in the regulation of gene expression
  in C. albicans. Deletion of HOG1 has effects on both basal and stress-induced gene
  expression. Notably, hyphal-specific genes and stress-related genes are deregulated
  in hog1 cells under basal conditions (A). In response to stress, Hog1 plays a central
  role in the regulation of osmotic- and heavy metal stress-induced gene expression,
  but a less significant role in the regulation of oxidative stress genes (B). Instead,
  other pathways, such as the Cap1 pathway, play key roles in the regulation of oxidative
  stress genes (see text). Hence, the Hog1 SAPK pathway functions in parallel with
  other pathways, to regulate the core stress response (CSR) in C. albicans.
