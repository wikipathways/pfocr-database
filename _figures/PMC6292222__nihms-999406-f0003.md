caption: T cells experience progressive changes in their phenotypes following antigenic
  stimulation. Depending on the strength and duration of the signals that they encounter
  during activation, they are launched on a pathway of proliferation and differentiation.
  T cells must be able to fully differentiate if they are to have antitumour efficacy.
  However, experimental evidence indicates that for adoptive transfer, T cell differentiation
  is inversely correlated with antitumour efficacy. The process of T cell differentiation
  results in the loss of proliferative and self-renewal capacity. For CD8+ T cells,
  T memory stem (TSCM) cells are more effective against tumours than central memory
  T (TCM) cells, which are more effective than effector memory T (TEM) cells. APC,
  antigen-presenting cell; CCR7, CC-chemokine receptor 7; IL-2Rβ, IL-2 receptor β-chain;
