caption: (A) Diagram depicting the interplay between some of the cell metabolic pathways
  with some of the fundamental protein post-translational modification reactions known
  to modulate protein functions. DNA methylation is also included, since DNA methylation
  and protein methylation share the same methyl donor substrates and also the metabolites
  needed for demethylation. Intermediate metabolites that affect the rate of these
  reactions are in red. This diagram is not meant to be comprehensive, as many other
  metabolites can affect the rate of these reactions; however, the metabolites highlighted
  here are some of the best understood, and a comprehensive listing of all other metabolites
  is beyond the scope of this review. Stoichiometry of ATP and NADH production per
  molecule of glucose is omitted for simplicity. Uptake of acetate from the extracellular
  space is omitted for simplicity as well, but it is noteworthy that an endogenous
  pyruvate by keto acid dehydrogenases (such as PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase). B-Ox,
  β-oxidation pathway; HBP, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway; PPP, pentode phosphate
  pathway; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; SAM, S-adenosyl
  methionine; UDP-GLcNAc, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine.(B) A simplified
  generalized schematic of glycolysis upregulation by growth factor signaling, focusing
  on the intracellular connections between some of the major players controlling cellular
  metabolism, such as AKT, AMPK, ERK, mTOR, PI3K, and RAS kinases and FOXO1/3a, MYC,
  and HIF1α transcription factors. Glucose metabolism is profoundly affected by AKT,
  mTORC1, and AMPK signaling cascades, which involve the phosphorylation activation/inhibition
  of many enzymes and transcription factors, which then shape the cell metabolic landscape
  of a cell; here only major regulatory proteins were included for simplicity.
