caption: Graphic illustrating the roles of 8 genes implicated in the present study
  in lithium-sensitive signaling pathways. Green lines denote enzymatic transformations
  or cofactor activations, red lines confirmed inhibitory actions, blue lines protein
  interactions of unknown nature from Lim et al (54) or hypothetical interactions.
  All colored genes contain at least one replicated SNP based on individual genotyping
  (teal) or pooled (yellow) data. G-protein coupled receptors (such as GPC51) activate
  the phosphatidyl inositol signaling pathway via G-protein (G) activation of phospholipase
  C (PLC, such as PLCG2). PLC cleaves PIP2 into IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG
  is metabolized by DAG kinases (such as DGKH). DAG is a necessary cofactor for activation
  of most protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. PKC cross-talks via disheveled (Dvl) with
  the Wnt/B-catenin signaling pathway. Dvl is activated by Wnt receptors (such as
  FZD2) and directly inhibited by nucleoredoxin (NXN) by binding the PDZ domain. A2BP1
  also binds Dvl. Dvl inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3B), which itself
  inhibits β-catenin. β-catenin is activitated by whirlin (DFNB31) via the Usher protein
  complex. Since it also contains PDZ domains, DFNB31 may also bind nucleoredoxin
  and Dvl. In the nucleus, β-catenin modulates the activity of TCF/LEF transcription
  factors (such as TCF7L1), which ultimately effects the expression of a large number
  of target genes. Lithium (Li+) lowers intracellular myo-inositol levels, reducing
  production of PIP2, and increases β–catenin signaling through inhibition of GSK3B.
