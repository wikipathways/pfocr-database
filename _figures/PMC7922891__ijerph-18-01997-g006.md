caption: Graphical summary of human skin fibroblast profiling of SS patients. The
  Ingenuity Pathways Analysis showed that deficiency of TWIST2 activity impacts connective
  tissue, importantly in its destruction, degeneration and damage repair. Includes
  all entities with p < 0.05 and z score ≥ 2 for diseases, functions and upstream
  regulators. Orange entities repre-sent activated nodes with z score ≥ 2, while blue
  entities represent inhibited nodes with z score ≤ −2. Ellipses represent transmembrane
  receptors, diamonds = enzymes, squares = cytokines or growth factors, rectangles
  = G-protein coupled receptors, octagons = function, crosses = disease, squeezed
  rectangle = canonical pathway and circles = other.
