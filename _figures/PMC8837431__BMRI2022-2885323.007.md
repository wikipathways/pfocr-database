caption: 'Protein regulation in T/B cell receptor signaling pathways. Core enrichment
  genes analyzed by GSEA were enriched in four signaling pathways including PI3K/Akt,
  NFκB, MAPK, and Calcium signaling pathways. TCR and BCR regulate their respective
  functional modules through these four pathways. TCR: T cell receptor; BCR: B cell
  receptor.'
