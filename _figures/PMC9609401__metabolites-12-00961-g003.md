caption: One-carbon enzymes are modified post-translationally. Enzymes involved in
  the one carbon metabolism pathway undergo a variety of post-translational modifications
  (PTMs), including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitylation.
  Several modifications (MTHFR phosphorylation and MTHFD1 methylation) affect protein
  activity and efficiency, thereby altering one carbon metabolic flux. Since identifying
  many other PTMs with proteomic screens, the biological effects of several other
  PTMs remain undefined. Note that the illustrated modifications only represent a
  selection of identified PTMs. Y, tyrosine; K, lysine; S, serine; R, arginine; T,
  threonine. P, phosphorylation; Ac, acetylation; Me, methylation; U, ubiquitylation.
