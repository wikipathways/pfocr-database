caption: Model of FADD-DD–induced apoptosis signaling in normal prostate epithelial
  cells. FADD-DD works through unidentified effectors to activate caspase 9 through
  a mitochondrial caspase activation pathway that is Bcl-xL sensitive. This leads
  to the activation of effector caspases, which cause cell death that is associated
  with membrane blebbing and cellular fragmentation. In addition, a serine protease
  pathway is activated that can be inhibited by AEBSF but not by Bcl-xL, which causes
  cell death that is associated with cell rounding and detachment. This pathway is
  not activated in prostate cancer cells because these cells possess defects in effector
  molecules that mediate the death domain signal.
