caption: The first seven enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, from hexokinase to phosphoglycerate
  kinase, are sequestered in peroxisome-related organelles called glycosomes. Glucose,
  taken up by the trypanosome from the blood, enters the glycosomes and is converted
  stepwise via glucose 6-phosphate (glc-6-P), fructose 6-phosphate (fru-6-P), fructose
  1,6-bisphosphate (fru-1,6-BP), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G-3-P) and glycerate
  1,3-bisphosphate (G-1,3-BP), which is the precursor of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA)
  that exits the organelles. The last three steps occur in the cytosol with the conversion
  of 3-PGA to 2-PGA, the precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) which is converted
  to pyruvate. Inside glycosomes, the use of ATP by hexokinase and PFK, and its formation
  by phosphoglycerate kinase are balanced. Net ATP synthesis by pyruvate kinase occurs
  in the cytosol. NADH formed inside the glycosomes by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase is re-oxidised by a glycosomal NADH-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, an electron shuttle involving glycerol 3-phosphate (glyc-3-P) and
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), and a mitochondrial FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate
  oxidase system not coupled to ATP synthesis. The trypanosomes can also take up glycerol,
  to be converted into pyruvate with a net ATP synthesis of 1 ATP/glycerol, or be
  used in gluconeogenesis to form glucose 6-phosphate.
