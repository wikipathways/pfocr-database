caption: Canonical NF-κB activation by TCR/CD28 and HTLV1 Tax. Canonical NF-κB activation
  by the T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 costimulatory molecule involves transient
  assembly of an intermediate signaling complex composed of Carma1, Bcl10, and Malt1.
  This so-called CBM complex is also associated with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
  (E2) Ubc13/Uev1 and a yet-to-be characterized E3 ubiquitin ligase. Within this signaling
  complex, Bcl10 and probably also Malt1 are conjugated with K63-linked ubiquitin
  chains that function as a platform to recruit the IKK and Tak1 complexes for their
  activation. Tax forms a stable complex with IKK and Tak1 and thereby persistently
  activates these kinases and NF-κB. This viral pathway involves K63 type of ubiquitination
  of Tax, although how ubiquitination regulates the Tax-specific NF-κB signaling is
  less clear. Ubiquitination, and possibly Pin1-mediated isomerization, of Tax may
  facilitate the binding of Tax to NEMO. It is also possible that Tax ubiquitination
  facilitates its binding by the Tak1 complex via the ubiquitin-association function
  of Tab2.
