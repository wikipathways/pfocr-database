caption: The underlying mechanism responsible for the beneficial effect of incretins
  in Alzheimer’s disease. Incretin receptor activation may include stabilization of
  the outer mitochondrial membrane, prevention of cytochrome c (CytC) efflux into
  the cytoplasm, and reduction of apoptosis and oxidative stress through activation
  of cAMP and other kinases. Together with ATP, the cAMP-dependent, protein kinase
  A (PKA) signaling pathway can regulate cytochrome c oxidase (COXIV) activity and
  mitochondrial function []. It can also activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
  leading to increased glucose uptake by the cells in an insulin-independent manner.
  By increasing aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH), which enters the citric acid cycle (TCA) to produce ATP. In
  this way, incretins shift the cell metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation and
  increased ROS production to aerobic glycolysis, leading to a neuroprotective effect.
