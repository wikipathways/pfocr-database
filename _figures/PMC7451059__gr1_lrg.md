caption: 'a) Rhinovirus, as an RNA virus (RV), post-transcriptionally modulates the
  host cell metabolism. Infection with this virus induces anabolic reprogramming of
  the host cell metabolism by 1) Inducing PI3K-mediated trafficking of GLUT1-containing
  vesicles to the host cell membrane thereby increasing glucose uptake. Also, overexpression
  of GLUT1 has been found to result in increased PPP intermediates 2) Upregulating
  both glycolysis and glycogenolysis which provides TCA cycle intermediates required
  for anabolic lipogenesis 3) Activating the PPP which results in enhanced levels
  of nucleotide that support viral replication. RV: rhinovirus; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; GLUT: glucose transporter; TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle. b) Schematic
  overview representing metabolic targets of some DNA viruses. Various DNA viruses
  activate particular anabolic metabolic programs following infecting the host cells,
  to finally support viral replication and virion maturation. Dashed arrows show a
  virus induced activation of the respective metabolic pathway or a transcription
  factor activation. TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle; α-KG: α-ketoglutarate; SREBP:
  sterol regulatory element-binding protein; ChREBP: carbohydrate-response element-binding
  protein; GLUT: glucose transporter; HCMV: human cytomegalovirus; HSV-1: herpes simplex
  virus-1; KSHV: Kaposi''s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; VACV: vaccinia virus.'
