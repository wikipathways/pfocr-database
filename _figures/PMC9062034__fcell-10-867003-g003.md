caption: 'NIBAN1 in the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy: (A) Apoptosis: In renal
  cell lines, NIBAN1 silencing increases stress-induced apoptosis of the ER and promotes
  the expression of caspase 8, caspase 9, Bip, and Chop. On the other hand, overexpression
  of NIBAN1 reduces both stress-induced apoptosis and the expression of caspase 8
  and caspase 9, suggesting that NIBAN1 may be involved in the regulation of apoptosis
  via caspase-dependent pathway. Modified figure from . (B) Under nutritional restriction,
  in normal thyroid cell line, NIBAN1 expression is increased, together with LC3B-II,
  an autophagy marker, inhibiting the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, and increasing cell
  death. On the other hand, with NIBAN1 silencing, in thyroid cancer cell line, the
  autophagic flux is increased, suggesting that NIBAN1 can inhibit autophagy in these
  models, avoiding programmed cell death. Modified figure from .'
