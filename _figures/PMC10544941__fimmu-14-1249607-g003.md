caption: SARS-CoV-2 proteins interfere with RIG-1/MDA5 and NF-kβ pathway. (A) Accumulation
  of viral RNA induces the RIG-1/MDA pathway. This accumulation can be reduced by
  nsp15 endoribonuclease activity. After its accumulation, RIG-1/MDA5 recognize viral
  RNA, this step is inhibited by Nsp5, M and N. After viral RNA recognition, RIG-1/MDA5
  stabilizes MAVS that subsequently activates TRAF 2/5/6. MAVS can be stabilized by
  sumoylation catalyzed by Nsp5 promoting expression of inflammatory cytokines. TRAF
  2/5/6 phosphorylates IKKϵ and TBK1, this phosphorylation can be inhibited by Nsp13.
  IKKϵ and TBK1 phosphorylation promotes IRF3 phosphorylation that in turn is translocated
  to the nucleus to activate IFN-I expression. Phosphorylation of IRF3 is inhibited
  by ORF6 and IRF3 translocation is interrupted by Nsp13 and ORF6. Additionally, Nsp3plpro
  cleave ISGylation from IRF3. (B) TRAF 2/5/6 also phosphorylates the IKK complex
  directly or through activation of TAK1. It was shown that Orf7a or Nsp6 interact
  with TAK1 promoting its interaction with NEMO, this TAK1-NEMO complex promotes phosphorylation
  of the Ikβ-p50-reIA complex that finally promotes NF-kβ translocation to the nucleus
  and subsequent activation of NF-kβ target proteins. Thus, nsp6 and orf7a has the
  ability to stimulate the production of NF-kβ target proteins. On the other hand,
  nsp13 inhibits the phosphorylation of the Ikβ-p50-reIA reducing the production of
  NF-kβ target proteins.

  description: SARS-CoV-2 proteins interfere with RIG-1/MDA5 and NF-kβ pathway. (A)
    Accumulation of viral RNA induces the RIG-1/MDA pathway. This accumulation can
    be reduced by nsp15 endoribonuclease activity. After its accumulation, RIG-1/MDA5
    recognize viral RNA, this step is inhibited by Nsp5, M and N. After viral RNA
    recognition, RIG-1/MDA5 stabilizes MAVS that subsequently activates TRAF 2/5/6.
    MAVS can be stabilized by sumoylation catalyzed by Nsp5 promoting expression of
    inflammatory cytokines. TRAF 2/5/6 phosphorylates IKKϵ and TBK1, this phosphorylation
    can be inhibited by Nsp13. IKKϵ and TBK1 phosphorylation promotes IRF3 phosphorylation
    that in turn is translocated to the nucleus to activate IFN-I expression. Phosphorylation
    of IRF3 is inhibited by ORF6 and IRF3 translocation is interrupted by Nsp13 and

    phosphorylates the IKK complex directly or through activation of TAK1. It was
    shown that Orf7a or Nsp6 interact with TAK1 promoting its interaction with NEMO,
    this TAK1-NEMO complex promotes phosphorylation of the Ikβ-p50-reIA complex that
    finally promotes NF-kβ translocation to the nucleus and subsequent activation
    of NF-kβ target proteins. Thus, nsp6 and orf7a has the ability to stimulate the
