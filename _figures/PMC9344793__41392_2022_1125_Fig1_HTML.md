caption: The pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis. In cholesterol biosynthesis, all
  the carbon atoms are derived from acetyl-CoA. The biosynthesis of cholesterol can
  be divided into four stages. (I) Synthesis of mevalonate (MVA). Two molecules of
  acetyl-CoA are reversely catalyzed by thiolase to form acetoacetyl-CoA. Acetoacetyl-CoA
  and acetyl-CoA are catalyzed to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
  by HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS). Finally, the HMG-CoA is catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase
  (HMGCR) to convert to MVA, a step that requires two molecules of NADPH and H+ and
  determines the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis. (II) Production of isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). MVA is sequentially
  phosphorylated twice by mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase to produce
  5-pyrophosphate mevalonate, which is further decarboxylated by 5-pyrophosphatemevalonate
  decarboxylase to produce isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). IPP is converted to dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate (DMAPP) catalyzed by isopentanoyl pyrophosphate isomerase, and DMAPP
  is used together with IPP as the starting materials for the third step of cholesterol
  synthesis. (III) Synthesis of squalene. IPP and DMAPP are condensed by farnesyl
  transferase to form geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), followed by a second condensation
  reaction between GPP and IPP to form farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and finally two
  molecules of FPP are condensed by squalene synthase to form squalene. (IV) Squalene
  cyclizes to form lanosterol and subsequently to synthesize cholesterol. Squalene
  forms a closed loop catalyzed by squalene monooxygenase and 2,3-oxidosqualene lanosterol
  cyclase to form lanosterol. Lanosterol is converted into cholesterol in more than
  twenty steps totally
