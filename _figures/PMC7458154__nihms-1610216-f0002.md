caption: (A) Human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells display
  a highly glycolytic phenotype that is critical for maintenance of the stem cellphenotype.
  Differentiation to some cell lineages involves the downregulation of glycolysis
  and upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation. Activation of stem cell genes is
  maintained at the level of epigenetic regulation, exerted by chromatin acetylation.
  Histone acetylation is dependent on glycolysis-mediated accumulation of acetyl-CoA
  (Ac-CoA). While active chromatin is here represented by nucleosomes decorated by
  acetyl groups (i.e., H3K9ac), repressed chromatin is decorated by methyl groups
  (H3K9me3, H3K27me3; although other methylated histone marks label active chromatin,
  H3K4me1, H3K4me3).(B) Neuromesodermal cells give rise to neural progenitor and paraxial
  mesodermal cells. Mesodermal cell fate is dependent on upregulation of glycolysis,
  which drives intracellular alkalization (via monocarboxylate acid extruders, MCT)
  and promotes β-CATENIN acetylation. Activation of WNT/β-CATENIN signaling pathway
  in conjunction with glycolysis-mediated acetylation of β-CATENIN at lysine 49 (green
  circle labeled Ac) is necessary for the expression of mesodermal β-CATENIN target
  genes and the acquisition of paraxial mesodermal identity.(C) Maintenance of endothelial
  identity is controlled by active fatty acid oxidation, whereas downregulation of
  fatty acid oxidation is necessary for endothelial tomesenchymal transition (EdMT).
  High levels of fatty acid oxidation are critical to keep high levels of acetyl-CoA
  and promote the acetylation of the TGFβ signaling pathway inhibitor SMAD7 (green
  circles labeled Ac). Acetylation of SMAD7 stabilize the protein by blocking its
  poly-ubiquitination (gray circles labeled Ub) and its eventual proteasomal degradation.
  TGFb signaling pathway (via activated SMAD2), including bringing SMAD7 levels down,
  is necessary for the activation of EdMT genes and the acquisition of a mesenchymal
  identity.
