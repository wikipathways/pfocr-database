caption: 'Polyacetylenic compounds derived from unsaturated fatty acids in various
  plant species. Their biosynthesis originates with unsaturated fatty acids (oleic
  acid and linoleic acid), depicted in the top box, which undergo a series of enzymatic
  modifications. The process begins with dehydrogenation, leading to the formation
  of stearolic acid, followed by β-oxidation to produce crepenynic acid and further
  dehydrogenation to yield highly modified acetylenic lipids. Tariric acid, derived
  through α-oxidation, represents an alternative entry point into the pathway. Solid
  arrows indicate well-established enzymatic steps, while dashed arrows denote hypothetical
  or less-characterized transformations based on comparative metabolic studies. The
  diagram illustrates the diversity of polyacetylenic compounds across plant species,
  with chemical structures and common names provided for each compound. Key intermediates
  and end products include: arcitinone A (edible burdock), thiarrubine A (daisy),
  panaxydol (ginseng), capillarin (tarragon), ponticaepoxide (endive, chicory), wyerone
  (broad bean), anacyclin (Echinacea), carthamoside A (safflower), tonghaosu (chamomile)
  and falcarindiol (tomato, carrot, ginseng). Each compound is associated with its
  primary plant source, highlighting species-specific metabolic specialization. The
  structure of falcarindiol, a prominent C17-polyacetylene, is emphasized at the bottom,
  reflecting its significance in carrot and related species [21]'
