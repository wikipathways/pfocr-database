caption: Ceramide and sphingosine-1-phospate metabolism and signaling in CNS. Ceramide
  (Cer) is generated from serine and palmitoyl Coenzyme A (de novo pathway) and through
  the acylation of sphingosine (Sph) (salvage pathway) at the endoplasmic reticulum.
  Cer is a substrate for sphingomyelin (SM) and glycosphingolipids synthesis at the
  Golgi apparatus. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is synthesized via phosphorylation
  of sphingosine (Sph). S1P can be dephosphorylated back to Sph and then reacylated
  to Cer, or it can be degraded to hexadecenal and ethanolamine-1-phosphate (ethanolamine-1P).
  Many of the biological effects of S1P are mediated via specific receptors, designated
  S1PR.
