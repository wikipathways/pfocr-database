caption: The mammalian biogenic polyamines and metabolic pathways. The polyamines
  putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (A) are synthesized from the ornithine precursor
  via a series of enzymatic reactions (B) that elongate the structure of the polyamine
  and add amino groups. Amino groups are protonated at physiological pH and comprise
  the aliphatic properties of the polyamines. The biogenic polyamines are highlighted
  in purple. Anabolic enzymes that promote the synthesis of polyamines are displayed
  in green, while catabolic enzymes are displayed in orange. Pharmaceuticals targeting
  the polyamine pathway are highlighted in red. AZIN1, antizyme inhibitor; MTA, 5'-methylthioadenosine;
  DHPS, deoxyhypusine synthase; SMO, spermine oxidase.
