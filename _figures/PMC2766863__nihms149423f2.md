caption: B cell receptor (BCR) signals are initiated by SRC family kinases such as
  LYN, which phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs)
  on the BCR signalling complex (Igα and Igβ). Phosphorylation of SYK then initiates
  multiple interacting downstream pathways (for simplicity, not all pathways and components
  are shown). These include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which culminates
  in the activation of AKT1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and the
  activation of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), which has multiple downstream effects.
  Among these effects are the induction of phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) activity, which
  mediates hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to
  produce inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), and the activation
  of protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ), which in turn leads to activation of the canonical
  nuclear factor-κB1 (NF-κB1; also known as p50) pathway through the BCL-10–MALT1–CARMA1
  complex. These mediators have multiple downstream effects, including the upregulation
  of p100 transcription but not p100 processing. By contrast, the B cell-activating
  factor receptor (BAFFR) preferentially activates the non-canonical NF-κB2 (also
  known as p52) pathway by inhibiting interactions between tumour necrosis factor
  receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF3 that otherwise would mediate the
  degradation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). The resulting NIK accumulation leads
  to increased processing of p100 and the generation of NF-κB2–ReLB heterodimers,
  which translocate to the nucleus where they upregulate the transcription of anti-apoptotic
  genes. However, BAFFR signals do not generate additional p100 and they can rapidly
  exhaust cellular stores of p100. So, only continued signalling through both receptors
  yields sustained anti-apoptotic gene expression and supports B cell survival. BCL-10,
  B cell lymphoma 10; BLNK, B cell linker; CARMA1, also known as CARD11 (caspase recruitment
