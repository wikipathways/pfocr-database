caption: A. Interstrand crosslinking (ICL) occurs.B. FA nuclear core complex (FACC)
  is a large, multi-subunit, E3 ubiquitin ligase (enzymatic activity provided by FANCL).
  FACC is recruited to the site of ICL detected by stalled replication fork. FANCM
  activates ATR via phosphorylation. ATR functions downstream to phosphorylate FANCI
  in the ID complex. Many models propose BRCA1 associates with the initial FACC to
  assist with CMG helicase removal, allowing the replication fork to approach the
  ICL site more closely.C. FACC recruits the phosphorylated FA ID complex (FANCI and
  FANCD2), and the FACC monoubiquitinates the FA ID complex.D. Nucleolytic “unhooking”
  of the ICL occurs through recruitment of downstream nucleases FAN1 (no mutations
  currently identified in FA patients), and multi-subunit FANCP(SLX4)/FANCQ(XPF).
  FAN1 binds mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2. FNACP(SLX4) contains ubiquitin binding sites
  and potentially interacts with FANCD2 as well. The role behind association of multiple
  nucleases, and their individual significance in nucleolytic processing, is unclear.E.
  Translesion synthesis (TLS) is performed by TLS-specific polymerases that are recruited
  to the nuclear foci. Multiple TLS polymerases have been implicated, including REV1
  and POLζ. No mutations in TLS-specfic polymerases have been identified in FA patients
  to our knowledge (1).F. Homologous recombination repair occurs through the recruitment
  of many repair factors. These include the FANCN(PALB2)/FANCD1(BRCA2)/FANCO(RAD51C)
  complex and FANCS(BRCA1)/FANCJ(BRIP1) which functions as a helicase and inhibitor
  of non-homologous end joining.G. DNA has been successfully repaired by components
  in the FA pathway.
