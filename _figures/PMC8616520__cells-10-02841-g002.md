caption: 'Iron is relevant for beta-cell function and preservation. Beta-cell iron
  homeostasis is under the control of the iron regulatory proteins (IRPs). Fe-S-cluster
  proteins are necessary for the correct processing and synthesis of insulin. The
  Fe-S cluster enzyme CDKAL1 is responsible for the adenosine methylthiolation in
  the tRNA for lysine, a modification required for the pro-insulin translational fidelity
  in pancreatic beta-cells. CDKAL1 is under the control of IRP2 (1). Iron is also
  essential for the metabolic coupling of insulin release: obligatory steps of the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are mediated by iron-dependent enzymes, and Fe-S
  cluster proteins are part of the respiratory chain complexes, allowing the synthesis
  of ATP (2). As a co-factor of the prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylase (PHD), iron
  controls the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α factor, influencing
  beta-cell response to hypoxia (3). Iron is also necessary to control inflammation,
  as PHD hydroxylates and inactivates the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKKb), an important
  upstream regulator of nuclear factor (NF)-kB (NF-kB) pathway, the major pro-inflammatory
  pathway in beta-cells (4).'
