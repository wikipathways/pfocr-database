caption: Mechanisms of targeting the CD47–SIRPα pathway in cancer.Therapeutic targeting
  of the CD47–SIRPα pathway can cause elimination of cancer cells through multiple
  mechanisms. Firstly, inhibition of the CD47–SIRPα interaction with a blocking anti-CD47
  antibody, a blocking anti-SIRPα antibody, or a recombinant SIRPα protein (depicted
  here as a bivalent Fc-fusion protein) leads to phagocytic uptake of tumor cells
  by macrophages. Secondly, an anti-CD47 antibody can eliminate tumor cells through
  traditional antibody Fc-dependent mechanisms including natural killer cell-mediated
  ADCC and CDC. Thirdly, anti-CD47 antibody may directly stimulate apoptosis of tumor
  cells through a caspase-independent mechanism. Fourthly, anti-CD47 antibody may
  enable phagocytic uptake of tumor cells by dendritic cells and subsequent antigen
  presentation to CD4 and CD8 T cells, thereby stimulating an antitumor adaptive immune
  response.ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; CDC, complement-dependent
  cytotoxicity; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NK, natural killer; SIRPα, signal-regulating
  protein alpha. Reprinted from Chao et al., with permission from Elsevier.
