caption: Regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by proteolysis. (A) Degradation of the
  yeast mitofusin Fzo1 can occur along two independent pathways. Constitutive turnover
  is dependent on the F-box protein Mdm30. Fzo1 turnover induced by cell cycle arrest
  (in the presence of α-factor) is mediated by UPS but does not require Mdm30. (B)
  Alternative topogenesis of Mgm1. Proteolytic conversion of L-Mgm1 to S-Mgm1 by the
  rhomboid protease Pcp1 depends on the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), matrix
  ATP, and the mitochondrial import motor (PAM). (C) Model for the processing of OPA1
  in mammalian mitochondria. After processing of newly imported OPA1 by MPP, long
  and short isoforms of OPA1 are generated by constitutive (left pathway) and inducible
  (right pathway) cleavage at sites 2 and site 1, respectively. m- and i-AAA proteases
  and PARL have been linked to OPA1 processing, but the exact proteolytic pathways
  remained speculative.
