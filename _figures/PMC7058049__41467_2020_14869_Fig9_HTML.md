caption: In detail, for biological function description, tumor-derived ITGBL1-enriched
  EVs convert primary fibroblasts to CAFs via binding to TNFAIP3 and activating the
  NF-κB signaling pathway. The ITGBL1-activated CAFs promote CRC stemness, aggressiveness,
  and EMT by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8. CAFs manipulated the
  TME to support metastatic tumor growth. For the molecular mechanism of ITGBL1 secretion,
  in primary CRC, the transcription of ITGBL1 was regulated by RUNX2, and the secretion
  of ITGBL1-loaded EVs was elevated by RUNX2 through the ceramide-dependent EVs secretion
  pathways mediated by nSMase2.
