caption: Nobiletin activates metabolic pathways in primary L cells in HFD-fed mice.
  Network analysis comparing pathway enrichment between transcriptomes of primary
  L cells isolated from (a) control (CON)- and high-fat diet (HFD) fed-, as well as
  (b) HFD and HFD + nobiletin (NOB) Gcg-Venus mice at ZT14. Orange dots indicate pathways
  enriched to the control (a) and HFD (b) conditions; blue dots indicate pathways
  enriched to the HFD (a) and HFD + NOB (b) treatments, with the size of the dot indicating
  the number of genes contained in the pathway. n = 3.
