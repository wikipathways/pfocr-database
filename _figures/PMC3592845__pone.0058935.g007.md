caption: Upon Helicobacter infection, CD11b+CD11c−Slfn-4− myeloid cells migrate from
  the bone marrow to the stomach in response to Shh ligand secretion from parietal
  cells. Prolonged exposure of these cells to the inflamed gastric environment induced
  by H. felis (∼6 months) induces a phenotypic shift into CD11b+CD11c+ myeloid cells,
  which express the marker Slfn-4. Gli1 expression in myeloid cells is necessary for
  this shift. Myeloid cell-derived IL-1β triggers the IL-6/pSTAT-3 pathway in epithelial
  mucous cells leading to mucous neck cell proliferation at the expense of parietal
  and chief cells (gland atrophy) and metaplasia (SPEM).
