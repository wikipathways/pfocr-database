caption: 'NO/peroxynitrite and HOCl signal interact with aquaporins. (A): Catalase
  protects towards ROS/RNS signaling. Superoxide anions generated by NOX1 are the
  basis for HOCl signaling (#1), as they lead to the formation of H2O2, and also for
  NO/peroxynitrite signaling (#2), as they are reaction partners for NO. HOCl signaling
  requires the presence of POD (#3), whereas NO/peroxynitrite signaling is determined
  by NOS-derived NO (#4). Membrane-associated catalase prevents HOCl signaling through
  decomposition of H2O2 (#5–7). As a consequence of H2O2 decomposition, the influx
  of H2O2 through aquaporins is minimal (#8). Catalase also prevents NO/peroxynitrite
  signaling, as it oxidizes NO (#9) in a two-step reaction that requires compound
  I of catalase, and as it decomposes peroxnitrite (#10). (B): Consequences of catalase
  inhibition. The inhibition of catalase (#1) reactivates HOCl signaling (#2–4), but
  the resultant lipid peroxidation (LPO) first remains without effects as it is efficiently
  repaired by GSH/GPx (#5), as long as the influx of H2O2 through aquaporins (#6,
  7) has not achieved glutathione depletion. Inhibition of catalase abrogates oxidation
  of NO and decomposition of peroxynitrite and therefore reactivates NO/peroxynitrite
  signaling (#8–11). The resultant lipid peroxidation is blocked by GSH/GPx as well
  (#12). (C) Final steps. As a consequence of catalase inhibition (#1), H2O2 influx
  through aquaporins (#2) finally leads to the depletion of GSH (#3) and renders the
  complex GPx/GSH nonfunctional. Therefore, HOCl signaling (#4–6) and NO/peroxynitrite
  signaling (#8–11) are no longer counteracted by GPX/GSG and induce the mitochondrial
  pathway of apoptosis (#7, #10). Importantly, NO/peroxynitrite signaling and HOCl
  signaling act sequentially, but not in concert, due to complex consumption reactions
  between NO and H2O2 [].'
