caption: Summary of the potential pathways and mechanisms of genes associated with
  wrinkling and sagging-related phenotypes. (i) BCAR3 and (ii) MYO16 promote actin
  polymerisation through distinct signalling pathways, leading to collagen production—a
  key factor in wrinkle reduction; (iii) PRDM16 inhibits the TGF-β signalling pathway,
  which activates collagen synthesis, leading to reduced wrinkling and sagging; (iv)
  RORA modulates pineal gland function, promoting melatonin production, which reduces
  reactive oxygen species and contributes to wrinkle reduction; and (v) SPTLC1 is
  involved in sphingolipid metabolism, generating a metabolite that stimulate collagen
  synthesis
