caption: A Visual representation of oxidative stress-induced PP2A-B55α binding to
  PME-1 and subsequent PP2A-C demethylation and inactivation in the nucleus (created
  with BioRender.com). B Model of the PP2A-B55α-inactivating function of PME-1 that
  subsequently controls activation of the MAPKAPK2-RIPK1 pathway and induction of
  RIPK1-dependent cell death (necroptosis) (created with BioRender.com).
