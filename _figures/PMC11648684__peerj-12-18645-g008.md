caption: Apoptosis includes extrinsic, intrinsic, and perforin/granzyme pathways mediated
  by T cells, all three of which ultimately intersect on the same executive pathway.
  METTL3 and FTO directly regulate the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins BAK and
  BAX, and anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 and BCL-XL, as well as caspases3, etc. METTL3,
  FTO, and YTHDF3, IGF2BP2 can also affect apoptosis by regulating the expression
  of certain genes. Created with BioRender.com
