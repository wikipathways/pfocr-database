caption: The carbon metabolism pathway shows the changes in Gynura bicolor leaves
  in response to Fe deficiency. Heatmaps show the different accumulations of metabolites.
  (LoF, the old leaves of the control group; LoN, the old leaves of the test group;
  LnF, the new leaves of the control group; LnN, the new leaves of the test group.).
