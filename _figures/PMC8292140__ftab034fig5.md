caption: 'Major components of central energy metabolism and NADPH regeneration in
  C. burnetii in comparison to other parasitic bacteria. Steps are indicated by black
  (canonical) or blue (C. burnetii) arrows. The broken blue line indicates a step
  for which the reaction mechanism in C. burnetii is uncertain. Red indicates reaction
  performed by G6PD and resulting NADPH in Cb+G6PD. NADPH from relevant reactions
  are highlighted in green. Intermediates related to major pathways are color coded:
  glycolysis/EMP and gluconeogenesis (black); ED pathway (green); PPP (orange); and
  TCA cycle (purple). Some intermediates relate to more than one pathway (dual coloring).
  Gray indicates components not related to a specific pathway. BCE indicates the bacterial
  cell envelope. oxPPP and non-oxPPP show separation between the two branches of the
  PPP. The reaction substrate(s) and product(s) for SdrA have not been determined.
  PntAB is coupled with the proton motive force. G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (zwf); 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (edd); KDPG ald., 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate
  aldolase (eda); PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pckA); PntAB, pyridine
  nucleotide transhydrogenase (pntA/pntB); IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd); and
  SdrA, short-chain dehydrogenase reductase A (sdrA). Boxes indicate reactions not
  directly related to the central metabolic network. PS, periplasmic space; IM, inner
