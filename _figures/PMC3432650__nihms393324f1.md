caption: (a) Model for Lin28-mediated control of let-7 biogenesis. (left) In the absence
  of Lin28 family members, let-7 miRNAs are processed through the canonical miRNA
  biogenesis pathway. Transcribed by RNA polymerase II, pri-let-7 is cleaved by the
  microprocessor complex of DGCR8 and Drosha, yielding pre-let-7, which is exported
  to the cytoplasm. Pre-let-7 is then cleaved by Dicer, resulting in a mature let-7
  duplex, which is asymmetrically loaded into one of several Argonaute proteins within
  the RNA-induced Silencing Complex (RISC). RISC-mediated repression of target mRNAs
  can occur through translational inhibition and deadenylation, or, if the miRNA shares
  perfect sequence complementarity with its target, mRNA cleavage. (right) Expression
  of Lin28A in the cytoplasm blocks let-7 processing by Dicer through direct RNA-protein
  interactions with the terminal loop of pre-let-7 and recruits the terminal uridyl
  transferase (TUTase) Zcchc11/TUT4 to catalyze the addition of 3′ oligouridine tail,
  marking pre-let-7 for degradation by unknown nucleases. Lin28B is primarily expressed
  in the nucleolus and binds to pri-let-7, thereby blocking the activity of the microprocessor
  complex through an unknown TUTase-independent mechanism. (b) Domains of Lin28A and
  Lin28B proteins. Lin28A and Lin28B share significant protein sequence identity and
  are composed of several common domains including a Cold Shock Domain (CSD, blue)
  and CCHC zinc fingers (green). Lin28B contains both a nuclear localization signal
  (NLS) and a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS), explaining its nucleolar localization.
  (c) Molecular basis for Lin28 interaction with pre-let-7. A cartoon representation
  of Lin28A binding to the terminal loop of a generic pre-let-7 miRNA based on high-resolution
  crystal structures. The CSD (blue) is inserted into the terminal loop, while the
  CCHC zinc fingers (green) dimerize around a conserved sequence motif (GGAG) proximal
  to the Dicer cleavage site. Binding of the zinc fingers partially unwinds the RNA
  duplex of pre-let-7, perhaps explaining the resistance of Lin28-bound pre-let-7
  to Dicer cleavage. Figure reproduced from [].
