caption: Proposed role of ER calcium underlying early disruptions in synaptic homeostasis
  at the CA3–CA1 synapse in AD. At presynaptic CA3 terminals, RyR-evoked CICR can
  trigger spontaneous release of neurotransmitter vesicles. During high-frequency
  activity, CICR can be evoked by voltage-gated calcium influx to increase the residual
  calcium levels and release probability. In AD, increased RyR expression greatly
  increases CICR. Increased CICR can alter neurotransmitter vesicle cycling and result
  in depletion of vesicles from the readily releasable pool as well as the reserve
  pool. This can initially be remedied by increasing neurotransmitter synthesis and
  vesicle cycling. Unfortunately, such adaptive mechanisms have the potential to cause
  metabolic and oxidative stress that may result in apoptosis and synapse loss. At
  postsynaptic CA1 terminals, NMDAR-mediated calcium signal is amplified by RyR-mediated
  CICR in dendritic spines, and this phenomenon is required for the induction of synaptic
  plasticity. In a separate but parallel plasticity pathway, the mGluR–PLC pathway
  generates IP3, activating IP3R. Activation of IP3Rs supports regenerative calcium
  waves, which may also be involved in plasticity and gene expression. RyR calcium
  also activates SK channels, which modulate neuronal excitability by hyperpolarizing
  the membrane and by setting the frequency of action potential firing. In AD, increased
  RyR-evoked calcium release increases SK channel activity and can thus affect membrane
  potential and synaptic plasticity dynamics. Increased SK channel currents decrease
  neuronal excitability and increase the threshold for induction of synaptic plasticity
  and thus hinder plasticity. In the AD brains, ER calcium is serving an aberrant
  role in synaptic transmission and plasticity and is upregulating these presynaptic
  and postsynaptic calcium-dependent events that alter synaptic homeostasis. SC input,
  Schaffer collateral input; VGCC, voltage-gated calcium channel.
