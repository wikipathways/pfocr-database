caption: 'Proposed mechanism underlying the differential effects of N-containing zoledronate
  and non-N-containing MPMBP, on the inflammatory responses. The hypothesis is based
  on the experimental findings in the present study and published reports. We hypothesized
  that persistent inflammation leading to tissue damage might be caused by the signaling
  pathway as follows: (a) the LPS-stimulated production of O2− by neutrophils; (b)
  peroxynitrite, which was produced from superoxide anions and NO, freely passes through
  the cell membrane; and (c) nitration of the tyrosine residue of IκB, which was reported
  to be a candidate for nitration target [,,]; (d) translocation of activated NF-κB
  into the nucleus and thereby, (e) upregulation of COX-2 and iNOS mRNA expression,
  which, in turn, increases the production of (f) PGE2 and (g) NO. This pathway from
  (a) to (g) is a vicious cycle that leads to persistent inflammation.'
