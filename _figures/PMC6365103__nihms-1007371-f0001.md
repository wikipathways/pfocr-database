caption: Copper distribution pathways in a generalized mammalian cell. CTR1 accepts
  cooper from the extracellular copper carriers and transfers copper into cytosol;
  changes in copper levels induce reversible trafficking between the plasma membrane
  and intracellular vesicles. CTR2 is predominantly intracellular but can be found
  at the plasma membrane. Entering copper is either binds directly or is retrieved
  from CTR1/CTR2 by copper chaperones that have multiple functions; CCS distributes
  copper to SOD1 in cytosol and mitochondria, while Atox1 transfers copper to the
  secretory pathway and nucleus. An ensemble of proteins regulates copper delivery
  to cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) in mitochindria. Cu-ATPases transport copper to the
  secretory pathways for incorporation into cuproenzumes and mediate copper excretion
  by sequestering excess copper in vesicles. The trafficking of Cu-ATPases between
  these two locations is associated with phosphorylation by a kinase (indicated by
  stars), which increases in response to copper elevation.
