caption: The AMPK signaling pathway. Upregulated genes are marked with red borders
  and downregulated genes with green borders. Non-differentially expressed genes are
  marked with black borders. (A) The AMPK signaling pathway when HMGR gene was overexpressed;
  (B) the AMPK signaling pathway when HMGR gene was interfered.
papertitle: HMGR overexpression and interference affect the expression of steroidogenic
  genes and cholesterol content in bovine intramuscular adipocytes.
