caption: Panel 1 shows the decreased expression of the leptin receptor in non-cancer
  stem cells. Panel 2 shows the activation of the leptin receptor signaling pathway
  upon introduction of LepR into non-cancer stem cells. Ligand binding to the pre-dimerized
  extracellular domain of LepRb initiates the phosphorylation and activation of the
  constitutively associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase. Activated JAK2 leads to the phosphorylation
  of the three tyrosine residues, Y985, Y1077 and Y1138, on the cytoplasmic region
  of LEPR. Y985 plays a complex role in LepRb signaling, as it not only serves as
  a docking site for the inhibitory SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) protein
  that is induced by STAT3 activation but also binds SHP-2 (src homology domain protein
  tyrosine phosphatase 2), an upstream activator of the ERK cascade. Y1138 recruits
  STAT3 for phosphorylation by JAK2, which leads to STAT3 nuclear translocation. Nuclear
  localization of STAT3 increases the transcription of its target genes, including
  the stem cell transcription factors NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4.
