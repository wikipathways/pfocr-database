caption: 'The intricate bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota and
  the host immune system. Regarding the innate immune system, the gut microbiota modulates
  innate immunity through several molecular and cellular mechanisms: Akkermansia muciniphila
  can influence the secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) by intestinal epithelial
  cells. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
  and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), are activated by microbial-derived ligands. These
  interactions initiate inflammatory responses by upregulating immune gene transcription.
  Bacteroides fragilis engages TLR1/TLR2 heterodimers and Dectin-1, stimulating the
  PI3K signaling pathway and promoting anti-inflammatory gene expression. NLRs, including
  NLRP6 inflammasome, are activated by microbial metabolites, such as taurine, histamine,
  and spermine, leading to IL-18 production and AMP secretion, thus shaping intestinal
  microbiota composition. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from Bacteroides stimulate
  IL-10 production by dendritic cells (DCs) and enhance macrophage phagocytic activity.
  Natural killer (NK) cells express RORγt and IL-22 in response to commensal microbiota-derived
  cues. Concerning the adaptive immune system, the adaptive immune compartment is
  also tightly regulated by gut microbiota-derived signals: Foxp3⁺ regulatory T-cells
  (Tregs) promote B-cell maturation and secretory IgA (sIgA) production, contributing
  to microbiota homeostasis and immune tolerance. CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)
  and Tc17 cells are activated by microbial metabolites, such as butyrate, which inhibits
  histone deacetylases (HDACs), thereby enhancing IFN-γ and granzyme B expression.
  T helper 17 (Th17) cells are induced by the adhesion of segmented filamentous bacteria
  (SFB) to intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), contributing to mucosal immunity. T
  follicular helper (Tfh) cells, modulated by microbiota, are essential for plasma
  cell and memory B-cell differentiation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regulate
  both the size and suppressive function of the Treg pool, linking microbial metabolism
  to immune modulation. This diagram underscores the dynamic crosstalk between host
  immunity and microbial ecology, essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis.
