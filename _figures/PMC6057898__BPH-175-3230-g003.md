caption: 'Interplay between melatonin and clock genes in joint during OA. Among pro‐inflammatory
  factors implicated in OA, IL‐1β accounts for disrupted expression of various clock
  genes. The role of BMAL1 is dominant in maintaining chondrocyte homeostasis in OA.
  Here, high levels of IL‐1β in the OA joint disturb the expression of most clock
  genes, leading to the suppression/reduction of BMAL‐1 expression, of which the loss
  of Sirt1 expression is central. Loss of BMAL due to inhibition of Sirt1 or via other
  pathways (up‐regulation of REV‐ERB‐α) can lead to the activation of MMPs, hence
  promote joint degradation. Melatonin is implicated in clock gene expression at least
  via two ways: (1) direct inhibitory actions on the release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines
  (TNF‐α, IL‐ 1β, IL‐8); and (2) blockade of NFkB signalling, which leads to the inhibition
  of matrix degrading enzymes (MMPs and Adamts4). Notably, circadian gene expression
  of Sirt1 is a prerequisite for BMAL activation and for the anti‐inflammatory effects
  of melatonin in the OA joints. Both melatonin and BMAL exploit a common pathway
  (TGF‐β signalling) to enhance matrix synthesis by articular chondrocytes.'
