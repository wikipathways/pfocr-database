caption: Adipocytokines mediate pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis by different signaling
  mechanisms. a. Adiponectin secreted from adipose tissue binds to its receptor (AdipoR)
  to activate AKT, MAPK and AMPK pathways, which block the apoptosis of pancreatic
  cancer cells. b. Similarly, leptin binding to its receptor (OBR) results in activation
  of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, which leads to matrix metalloproteinase-13 activation
  and eventual pancreatic cancer metastasis. In addition, OBR also regulates its own
  expression through hypoxia inducible factor-1, resulting in cancer cell survival
  via an unknown mechanism. Moreover, leptin also triggers Notch receptor signaling,
  which results in activation of its downstream molecules (survivin and Hey2), thereby
  increasing cancer cell proliferation.
