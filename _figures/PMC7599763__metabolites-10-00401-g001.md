caption: 'The acylsugar biosynthetic pathway in S. pennellii. Enzymes including acyl
  CoA synthetase (ACS), enoyl CoA hydratase (ECH), and isopropylmalate synthase 3
  (IPMS3) contribute to production of the acyl CoA pool. Acylsugar acyltransferases
  (ASATs) constitute the core acylsugar pathway and transfer acyl chains from acyl
  CoA molecules to a sucrose core. ASFF1 and ASHs catalyze acylsugar turnover or degradation
  by hydrolyzing the fructose moiety of the sugar core and acyl chains, respectively.
  Acylsugar nomenclature is as follows: the first letter indicates the sugar core
  (“S” for sucrose, “G” for glucose); the number before the colon indicates the number
  of acyl chains; the number after the colon indicates the sum of carbons in all acyl
  chains; the numbers in parentheses indicate the number of carbons in individual
  acyl chains. ACS—acyl CoA synthetase; ASAT—acylsucrose acyltransferase; ASFF—acylsucrose
  fructofuranosidase; ASH—acylsugar hydrolase; CoA—coenzyme A; ECH—enoyl CoA hydratase;
  IPMS—isopropyl malate synthase.'
