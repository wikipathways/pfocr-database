caption: IL-15–PI3K–AKT-mTOR signaling for NK cell development. IL-15 complex interacts
  with its receptor IL-15Rβ/γc on NK cells to trigger PI3K/AKT pathway autophosphorylation
  and activation and subsequent activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 and mTORC2
  differentially promote NK cell development in a cooperative and non-redundant manner
  primarily by divergent induction of corresponding transcription factor Eomes and
  T-bet. Eomes binds to the il2rb promoter and drives CD122 expression to maintain
  IL-15 responsiveness, generating a positive feedback loop to amplify the IL-15 signaling.
  Despite the negative regulation of T-bet expression by FoxO1, several transcription
  factors, including GATA3, TOX2, and ETS-1, promote T-bet expression. However, the
  activation of mTOR signaling is tightly modulated by cooperation of TSC1 and PTEN.
