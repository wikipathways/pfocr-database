caption: Schematic illustration of pathway alterations involved in the development
  of low-grade serous carcinoma. The cardinal molecular genetic changes include somatic
  mutations in KRAS, BRFA and occasionally ERRB2 (encoding Her2/Neu) and PIK3CA. The
  mutated gene products constitutively activate the signaling pathways that regulate
  cellular proliferation and survival and promote tumor initiation and progression
  through several mechanisms including up regulation of glucose transporter-1. The
  size of the boxes containing specific genes reflects the relative frequency of the
  mutation and the thickness of the arrows indicates the relative contribution of
  the pathway alterations to tumor development.
