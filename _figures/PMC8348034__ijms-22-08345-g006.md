caption: Maternal tabagism model of negative consequences on amniotic cells by the
  induction of RAGE-dependent sterile inflammation and gelatinase activity. Sterile
  inflammation is a key phenomenon of FM weakening, not only in physiological rupture,
  but also in pPROM. Exposure to tobacco during pregnancy is a well-known risk factor
  of pPROM. We demonstrated here that CSC induces an in vitro HMGB1 release by the
  amnion, a well-known danger signal. Then, this alarmin, a major ligand of RAGE,
  can induce a pro-inflammatory response (NF-κB activation and cytokine production)
  through the RAGE pathway in amniotic epithelial cells, which suggests the essential
  role of RAGE in FM rupture and pPROM. smart.servier.com was used to create the figure.

  description: Maternal tabagism model of negative consequences on amniotic cells
    by the induction of RAGE-dependent sterile inflammation and gelatinase activity.
    Sterile inflammation is a key phenomenon of FM weakening, not only in physiological
    rupture, but also in pPROM. Exposure to tobacco during pregnancy is a well-known
    risk factor of pPROM. We demonstrated here that CSC induces an in vitro HMGB1
    release by the amnion, a well-known danger signal. Then, this alarmin, a major
    ligand of RAGE, can induce a pro-inflammatory response (NF-κB activation and cytokine
    production) through the RAGE pathway in amniotic epithelial cells, which suggests
    the essential role of RAGE in FM rupture and pPROM. smart.servier.com was used
