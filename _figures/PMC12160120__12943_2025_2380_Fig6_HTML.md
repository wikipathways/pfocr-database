caption: 'Interactions and regulatory mechanisms between the cGAS-STING pathway and
  other components within the TIME. The interaction between the cGAS-STING pathway
  and IL-6 forms an immunosuppressive network: STING activation promotes IL-6 expression
  via the NF-κB-STAT3 axis. IL-6 subsequently enhances tumor cell survival, PD-L1
  upregulation, and therapeutic resistance, while concurrently inhibiting the anti-tumor
  effects mediated by the IRF3/IFN-β pathway, thus acting as an “immune brake”. Furthermore,
  cGAS-STING signaling, mediated by IFN-I, regulates the spatiotemporal expression
  of CXCL9/10, reshaping the immune microenvironment to enhance T cell infiltration
  and effector functions. Targeted interventions within this network (such as combining
  STING agonists with IL-6 inhibitors or PD-1 blockade) can overcome immunosuppression
  and synergistically enhance anti-tumor efficacy. The diagram integrates key nodes,
  including costimulatory factors and immune checkpoints, illustrating the translational
  significance of IL-6 and IFN-I functioning respectively as bidirectional switches
  for “immune suppression” and “immune activation”'
