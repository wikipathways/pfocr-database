caption: NOS3 pathway. This shows all genes from our dataset (except SNCA) known to
  interact with ALDH1A1. In blue represent genes that are downregulated and in yellow
  genes that are upregulated. Line in purple represent binding between two molecules
  and an arrow with a positive sign represent a positive regulation.
