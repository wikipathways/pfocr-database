caption: A. Cartoon showing the organization of docked vesicles around bands of active
  zone material (AZM) observed by electron tomography (). The diagram shows “primary”
  vesicles (gray) enclosed between the bands of AZM and “secondary” vesicles observed
  at the periphery of AZM. Most likely, primary vesicles would have higher release
  probabilities being in the immediate vicinity of Ca2+ channel clusters.B. A hypothetical
  model proposing that upon interacting with AZM, a vesicle can be either docked as
  “primary”, or as “secondary”, or fused with the plasma membrane releasing neurotransmitter.
  Rab3a promotes vesicle targeting to AZM and docking. Synapsin II positively regulates
  the pathway that diverts the vesicles from other pathways to become docked as “secondary”.
