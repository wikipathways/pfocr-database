caption: The ERK MAPK signaling pathway. Kinases mediating ERK MAPK signaling are
  sequentially activated by phosphorylation. ERK1/2 are terminal kinases in MAPK signaling
  that can translocate to the nucleus to regulate transcription programs mediating
  growth/migration/differentiation. Aberrant activation of ERK signaling through RAS
  and RAF mutations is observed in >30% of human cancers and extensive drug discovery
  efforts have been directed towards this pathway for targeted cancer therapies. However,
  reactivation of ERK signaling with RAF and MEK inhibitors has prompted interest
  in targeting ERK1/2 directly. Percentages reflect the TCGA provisional data sets
  accessed via cBioPortal (; http://www.cbioportal.org/).
