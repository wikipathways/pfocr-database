caption: Overview of the effects of IONPs on macrophage polarization. The IONPs can
  interact with cell surface receptors such as TLRs (1), leading to activation of
  the MAPK signaling pathway. Once internalized by macrophages, the IONPs are enclosed
  within endolysosomes where they are biodegraded. Consequently, atomic iron is released
  into the cytoplasm, where it engages the Fenton reaction and produces ROS (2). As
  a result, transcriptional reprogramming is triggered, such as that involving NF-κB
  (e.g., cytokines, chemokines) and NRF2 target genes (e.g., iron metabolism). NRF2,
  nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2; PIR, Pirin; FPN1, ferroportin-1; FTH1,
  ferritin heavy chain; FTL, ferritin light chain; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinases; MAF, musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma.
