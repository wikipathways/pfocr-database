caption: Model depicting how chronic exposure to SAg could elicit an autoimmune disease.
  Chronic colonization with SAg-producing S. aureus strains occurs in many individuals.
  Under suitable conditions, such colonizing strains will produce one or more SAg,
  which will be absorbed and bind to HLA class II molecules on B cells as well as
  other APC. This leads to activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of diverse antigen
  specificities, including the self-reactive clones that are present in most individuals,
  as long as they express appropriate TCR Vβ family preferred by those SAg. Self-reactive
  T clones present among this population will undergo further rounds of activation
  when they encounter their cognate self-antigens presented in a classical manner
  by the professional APC, amplifying autoimmunity. As SAg can directly signal through
  MHC class II molecules on professional APC, they could induce IL-1 and IL-12 production,
  thereby skewing towards the pro-inflammatory Th1-type pathway. Self-reactive B cells
  presenting SAg would get signals through their BCR as well as receive costimulatory
  signals through CD40-CD40L, B7-CD28 pathways from the CD4+ T cells recognizing the
  SAg. Such B cells would proliferate, differentiate to plasma cells and secrete autoantibodies.
  Non-self reactive B cells presenting SAg would fail to undergo such activation and
  differentiation into plasma cells, as they would not receive signaling through their
  BCR. Several bacterial (such as qualitative and quantitative nature of the SAg produced,
  chronicity of colonization etc.,), host (genetic and non-genetic factors, such as
  providing conducive milieu to the colonizing strains to elaborate SAg) and other
  environmental factors may determine the overall outcome.
