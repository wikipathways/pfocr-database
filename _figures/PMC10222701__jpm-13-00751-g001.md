caption: 'Diagram demonstrating CmPn/CmP signaling network (largest square) where
  the CSC (CCM signaling complex, CSC square) couples both classic nPR (classic PRG
  action) and non-classic mPR (non-classic PRG action) signaling to exert their influence
  on the performance of vascular ECs. Multiple small circles within CCM2 indicates
  its essential role with binding status with both CCM1 and CCM3, through its multiple
  alternative spliced isoforms. Dual-directional arrows indicate bi-directional effects;
  bold green arrows indicate eventual effects of the CmPn/CmP signaling network on
  vascular angiogenesis, including neovascularization and dynamic regulation of the
  blood vessel barrier. Within the green frame of the CmPn/CmP signaling network,
  dark-blue arrows and frames are major components of the network, while light-blue
  circles are downstream cellular events modulated by the network. Plus symbol (+)
  indicates positive impact while minus symbol (−) for negative effect. Within the
  CSC, light-brown circles represent key components: CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3. The signaling
  pathway colored in red is important for BBB integrity. As mentioned in the article,
  this signaling network also affects the preservation of the blood–brain barrier
  (BBB) and neurovascular unit (NVU), both of which are essential for maintaining
  BBB integrity.'
