caption: The IFN-1 > BID > ROS pathway connects DNA damage with hyper-proliferation
  and malfunction of haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Loss of ATM, loss
  of ATM-mediated BID phosphorylation and/or DNA damage all result in mitochondrial
  accumulation of full-length BID and toxic ROS production. How nuclear DNA damage
  may trigger an IFN-1 response is currently unknown, but innate immune signaling
  via the cytoplasmic DNA recognition machinery involving cyclic GMP-AMP-Synthase
  (cGAS), stimulator of IFN-1 signaling (STING) and interferon response factor 3 (IRF3)
  seems a good bet. The mechanistic link between IFN-1 signaling and BID mobilization
  has not yet been explored and thus remains entirely obscure.
