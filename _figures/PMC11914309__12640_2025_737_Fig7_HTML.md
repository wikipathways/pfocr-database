caption: Differentially expressed genes in Chemokine Signaling Pathway (rno04062)
  using transcriptomic data at 168 h after TMT administration. Upregulated genes (Q-value < 0.05,
  Log₂ fold change > 0.58) are marked with blue and an upward-pointing triangle (▲)
  next to the gene name, while downregulated genes (Q-value < 0.05, Log₂ fold change < −0.58)
  are marked with red and a downward-pointing triangle (▼) next to the gene name.
  Genes with no significant change are shown with an unfilled (white) box. Shading
  intensity represents the magnitude of log₂ fold change, with darker shading indicating
  larger expression changes. Chemokine signaling plays a key role in neuroinflammation,
  which is a hallmark of TMT-induced neurotoxicity
