caption: Activation of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway in vaginal epithelial cells
  by Candida pathogens. C. albicans infection on vaginal epithelial cells manifests
  by a modest yeast-to-hyphal transition within the first 2 hours, when the EGFR-ERK1/2
  signaling pathway (small red arrow) is moderately activated. At a later stage of
  stimulation (4 to 10 hours), after the formation of a greater number of hyphae,
  the EGFR-p38 signaling pathway (thick red arrow) is strongly activated. Activated
  EGFR-p38 and-ERK1/2 signaling pathways lead to an increased phosphorylation of c-Fos
  and p65 and an increased secretion of cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CCL20).
  In particular, the EGFR-p38 signaling pathway also moderates epithelial damage induced
  by C. albicans. While non-albicans Candida (NAC) spp. infections of vaginal epithelial
  cells rarely produce hyphae, they activate a strong phosphorylation of ERK1/2, c-fos
  and p65 and a subsequent secretion of cytokines. Although not strongly activated,
  the p38 pathway still has some effect in the moderation of epithelial damage.
