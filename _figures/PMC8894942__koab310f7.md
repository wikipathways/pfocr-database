caption: Biological roles of plant exosome cofactors. (Upper left) The RNA helicase
  MTR4 and the exoribonuclease RRP6L2 are predominantly located in nucleoli and contribute
  to ribosome biogenesis by processing and degrading pre-rRNAs and rRNA processing
  by-products. Efficient ribosome biogenesis is essential for plant growth and development,
  and its impairment triggers a ribosome stress response pathway () that leads to
  defects in vein pattern formation, leaf morphology, and reduced rosette size. (Upper
  right) The RNA Helicase HEN2, part of the nucleoplasmic NEXT complex and likely
  also a component of a PAXT-like connection, plays a central role in RNA surveillance,
  that is, the elimination of diverse types of non-rRNAs including mRNAs and lncRNAs
  in the nucleus. HEN2 is involved in flower development and perhaps in pathogen immunity
  and preventing an auto-immune phenotype via mechanisms that are not yet understood.
  (Lower parts) RNA degradation by cytosolic exosome complexes is assisted by the
  evolutionarily conserved Ski-complex consisting of the RNA helicase SKI2, SKI3,
  and two SKI8 subunits. Other cytoplasmic exosome cofactors are SKI7, the plant-specific
  protein RIPR, and RST1, a homolog of human FOCAD. Cytosolic exosomes degrade mRNAs
  and are particularly important for NSD. In Arabidopsis, the exosome-mediated degradation
  of CER3 mRNA prevents the production of CER3-derived siRNAs and the posttranscriptional
  silencing of CER3 expression. Silencing of CER3 mRNA results in strongly reduced
  levels of the very-long-chain aldehyde decarbonylase CER3, which is required for
  the normal deposition of cuticular waxes.
