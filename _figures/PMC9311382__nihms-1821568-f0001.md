caption: Gut microbiota dysbiosis-associated signaling pathways in muscle wasting
  and heart failure. Signaling pathways involved in skeletal muscle protein synthesis
  include androgen/testosterone, insulin and growth factors related pathways. Testosterone
  binds to its androgen receptor (AR) then together enter to nucleus to activate its
  downstream genes associated with muscle protein synthesis. It can also directly
  or indirectly influence mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways to control protein synthesis. IGF-1 and insulin elicit
  their protein sythesis function by binding to their receptors on cell membrane.
  Signaling pathways invovled in skeletal muscle wasting/atrophy include myostein-mediated
  transformation growth factor β signaling pathway, inflammation-assocaited signaling
  pathways. The ceullar mechamis asscoaited with skeletal muscle wasting/atrophy include
  the UPS proteiolsys pathway, autophage-lysome (ALP) and apopotsis. Dysregulation
  of mitochondria can trigger UPS, ALP and apoptosis leading muscle wasting/astrophy.
  Some gut microbial metabolites (GMM) and pathogens have anti-inflammation effect,
  such Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and Urolithin A (UroA) and thus prevent muscle
  degredation. A variety of GMM and pathogens can trigger myostatin-mediated SMAD2/3
  signaling pathway and inflammatory signaling pathways. One potential GMM that causes
  muscle wasting in the elderly have not been evulatued is TMAO. Background color
  in pink indicates cellular events and signaling pathways associated with muscle
  wasting, and background color in blue indicates those related to chronic heart failure.
  Please see the text for detail description. Please note that several signaling pathways
  such as MAPK, mTOR and SMAD2/3 are also involved in heart failure. However, the
  ligands trigger these signaling pathways leading to heart failure are different
  from those activate the pathways in muscle wasting. (Created with BioRender).
