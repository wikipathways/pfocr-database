caption: Pathway for prostaglandin synthesis. Arachidonic acid is found in membrane
  phospholipids in resting cells and is released as a free fatty acid by the action
  of phospholipase(s). It then can be a substrate for a variety of enzymes that catalyze
  the addition of oxygen, resulting in multiple products with diverse physiological
  actions. The free arachidonic acid itself has a variety of effects on intracellular
  signaling and can be recycled back to phospholipids. Cyclooxygenases –1 and –2 are
  the targets for NSAIDs and the specific COX-2 inhibitors.
