caption: Evolving signaling and transcriptional networks during cardiac differentiation
  and regeneration. A differentiation trajectory, focused on the transitions occurring
  between the cardiac progenitor and mature cardiomyocyte stages, is shown from left
  to right. Cardiac progenitors, immature cardiomyocytes and mature cardiomyocytes
  all express cardiogenic transcription factors (TFs) that promote cardiac differentiation
  transitions and maintain the expression of cardiac differentiation products. Signaling
  pathway-dependent TFs are also active in the nucleus of differentiating progenitors
  and can facilitate, or counteract, the activity of the cardiogenic TFs. Examples
  of signal-dependent transcriptional regulation active during cardiomyocyte differentiation
  are shown. Early cardiac progenitors experience high levels of Wnt and Hippo signaling,
  and their TFs β-catenin and YAP facilitate the activation of pro-proliferation genes,
  a hallmark of the progenitor state. As cardiac progenitors begin to differentiate,
  β-catenin is inhibited by BMP signaling SMAD TFs and YAP is phosphorylated and shuttled
  out of the nucleus, resulting in the de-activation of proliferation genes and the
  preponderance of pro-differentiation gene expression. Re-activation of the Hippo
  pathway in terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes can increase their proliferation
  rate, thereby promoting cardiac regeneration after injury. BMP, Bone Morphogenetic
  Protein; YAP, Yes Associated Protein; TEAD, TEA Domain.
