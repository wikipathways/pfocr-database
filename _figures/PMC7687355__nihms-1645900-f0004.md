caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of microarray data showing predicted activation
  of VEGF signaling at 48 hr (vs 0 hr) after (A) APAP 300 and (B) PHX, based on downstream
  gene expression profile. Positive z-score (absolute z-score > 2 considered as significant)
  represents predicted activation of upstream regulator based on expression profile
  of downstream genes. p-values signifies extent of overlap between set of downstream
  target genes of a upstream regulator in dataset compared to all known downstream
  target genes of that upstream regulator in the reference genome. (red shapes: upregulated
  genes; green shapes: downregulated genes with intensity of color reflecting extent
  of upregulation or downregulation; orange center shape: predicted activation)'
