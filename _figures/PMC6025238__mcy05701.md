caption: 'Simplified representation of fruit primary metabolism. Major primary pathways
  and compounds involved in fruit growth and quality are represented. Sucrose and
  amino acids represent the major imported pools. Sucrose is first metabolized via
  sugar metabolism, which produces starch and precursors of cell wall components,
  and the major antioxidant ascorbate. A large fraction of sucrose and/or hexoses
  is stored in the vacuole. Hexose phosphates, which are intermediates of sucrose
  metabolism, are degraded via glycolysis to release energy and yield precursors of
  the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism. Alternatively, hexose phosphates are metabolized
  via the pentose phosphate pathway, which yields precursors of nucleotides and specialized
  metabolites. The TCA cycle coupled to respiration releases energy and provides precursors
  for amino acid synthesis. Imported amino acids, of which glutamine, glutamate, aspartate
  and asparagine are often the dominant forms, provide nitrogen and carbon skeletons
  for the synthesis of further amino acids. The major compounds that mainly influence
  fruit quality are in bold. Abbreviations: P, phosphate; UDP, uridine diphosphate;
  acetyl-CoA, acetyl-coenzyme A.'
