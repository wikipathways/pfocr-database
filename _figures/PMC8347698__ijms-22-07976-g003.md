caption: Overview of potential SGLT2i targets relevant for ion homeostasis in the
  heart. SGLT2i directly reduces (via inhibition of Late INa, NHE1 and potentially
  SGLT1) intracellular Na+ accumulation in the failing heart. Decreased [Na+]i in
  turn improves mitochondrial function (see ) and thus may contribute to the decrease
  in mitochondrial ROS formation observed with SGLT2i treatment. Reduction of oxidative
  stress attenuates oxidative CaMKII activation, which, together with decreased [Na+]i,
  improves cellular Ca2+ handling and leads to improved diastolic and systolic function.
  Moreover, both restoration of Ca2+ homeostasis and CaMKII inhibition are antiarrhythmic.
  Downward-pointing arrows denote reduction or inhibition of a signaling pathway.
  Upward-pointing arrows denote stimulation or enhancement of a pathway. NHE1, Na+/H+
  exchanger 1; SGLT1, sodium-glucose co-transporter 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  CaMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; [Na+]i, cytosolic Na+ concentration.
