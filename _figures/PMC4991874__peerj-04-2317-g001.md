caption: Cellular stresses (i.e., hyperoxia, increase in Tb) activate Akt, which inhibits
  Foxo translocation to the nucleus through phosphorylation on several residues for
  Foxo1 and 3a. In the nucleus, Foxo3a phosphorylation at Ser-318, 321 by CK1 results
  in nuclear exclusion. Therefore, all Foxo1 and 3a phosphorylation sites are inhibitory.
  This signaling pathway, along with MyoG, is involved in E3 ubiquitin ligase (MAFbx
  and MuRF1) regulation which result in physiological outcomes such as muscle remodelling
  and protein degradation/atrophy in skeletal and heart muscle.
