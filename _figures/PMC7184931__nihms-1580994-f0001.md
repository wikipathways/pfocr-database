caption: This schematic diagram shows the metabolic pathways controlling activation
  and lineage specification in the immune system. Depicts how various metabolic pathways
  regulate the surface receptors, and intracellular transducers in immune cells. Electron
  transport chain blockage results in elevated mitochondrial transmembrane potential
  (Δᴪm) or mitochondrial hyperpolarization, and diminished mitophagy contributes to
  accumulation of oxidative stress-generating mitochondria and depletion of ATP and
  glutathione. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by electron transfer to
  O2 at complex I. These metabolic changes underlie the activation of mTORC1, which
  promotes glycolysis in CD4+ T cells, further enhancing accumulation of mitochondria
  in necrosis prone, pro inflammatory double negative (DN) T cells and depleting Treg
  cells. The direction of signaling is indicated by arrow (red = increase, blue =
  decrease). Drugs that affect metabolism are shown in green. IL 6 = interleukin-6,
