caption: 'PSMA-dependent regulation of signal transduction in prostate cancer: In
  the canonical (A) pathway, a stable complex comprised of IGF-1R, RACK1 and β1-integrin
  activate FAK by phosphorylation at tyrosine925 leading to the activation of the
  GRB2-ERK1/2 pathway resulting in proliferation, growth and migration of tumor cells.
  When PSMA is present, such as in our wild-type (B) model, it physically associates
  with RACK1 and signaling between β1-integin and IGF-1R is disrupted, resulting in
  activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway instead of the canonical GRB2-ERK 1/2 pathway.
  In the absence of PSMA, such as in our PSMAKO (C.), the complex of IGF-R1, RACK1,
  β1-integrin is allowed to form and activates the GRB2-ERK1/2 pathway resulting in
  delayed proliferation, growth and survival and therefore smaller tumors. Key: Prostate
  Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA); type I insulin growth factor receptor (IGF-1R);
  receptor for activated C kinases (RACK1); focal adhesion kinase (FAK); growth factor
  receptor–bound protein 2 (GRB2); extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2
  (ERK1/2); phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K); protein kinase B (AKT); insulin
  receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). PSMAKO refers to PSMA knockout in mouse prostate and
  prostate cancer cell lines.'
