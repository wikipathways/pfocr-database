caption: 'Traces of stress granules in signaling pathways. Under natural conditions,
  stress granules are assembled and disassembled under an equilibrium. KRAS causes
  up-regulation of 15d-PGJ2 directly or through COX-2. On one side of the pathway,
  15d-PGJ2 interacts with RALGDS and RAF to form SGs. 15d-PGJ2, on the other hand,
  targets eIF4A, destroys its connection to eIF4G, stops the translation process,
  and leads to the formation of SGs. Knocking down survivin is associated with an
  increase in the number of SGs and activation of autophagy. SyK phosphorylation by
  Grb7 localizes SyK in the structure of SGs and activates autophagy. Localization
  of RAPTOR in the SGs structure by up-regulation of astrin leads to an increase in
  the production of SGs. On the other hand, inhibition of mTORC1 inhibits phosphorylation
  of 4E-BP and the formation of eIF4F complex and causes the formation of SGs. 15d-PGJ2:
  15-Deoxy-delta (12,14)-prostaglandin J (2), KD-survivin: knocking Down-Survivin.
