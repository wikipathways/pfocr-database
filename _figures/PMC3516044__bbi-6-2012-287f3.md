caption: 'Changes in the Plasmodium falciparum redox flux network after MB drug action.Notes:
  Results incorporating the transcription data and experimental mRNA expression data
  nine hours after incubation with methylene blue are shown. External metabolites
  are shown as red triangles, internal metabolites as green balls (see above). Enzyme
  names are written in brown boxes. Thicker arrows represent a stronger pathway flux.
  With methylene blue there is a shift in redox protection including glutathione reductase.
  Fluxes change according to utilization of the different pathways in the actual experiment
  and as a result of MB drug action (thinner and thicker arrows). To avoid cluttering
  of the picture, some connections to external metabolites are not shown. For full
  detail on all enzymes, substrates and fluxes calculated see Additional files.'
