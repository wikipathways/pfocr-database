caption: Shows the benefits of Warburg and molecular signaling. Glycolysis and the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are directly controlled at a number of stages by
  the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which is significantly dysregulated in glioblastoma.
  By encouraging increases in glucose transport and hexokinase activity (HK2), AKT
  may facilitate aerobic glycolysis. ACL-dependent conversion of citrate to cytosolic
  acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis may also be encouraged by increased AKT activity.
  Increased glycolysis may encourage nucleotide synthesis and provide equivalents
  for REDOX that can reduce NADH. Glycolysis may be slowed down by inactive PKM2 by
  shifting intermediate metabolites to anabolic pathways. Pyruvate production may
  be switched from lactate to lactate instead of pyruvate if HIF1a is stabilized by
  mTORC1. Biorender was used to construct the figure
