caption: An overview of the salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathways. Pathogen secretion
  of the phytotoxin coronatine indirectly promotes MYC2 activation of NAC genes, which
  inhibit SA accumulation through the down‐regulation of isochorismate synthase 1
  (ICS1) expression. Indirect activation of BENZOIC ACID/SALICYLIC ACID CARBOXYL METHYLTRANSFERASE
  1 (BSMT1) expression by NAC genes may also result in BSMT1‐mediated conversion of
  SA into methyl salicylate (MeSA). Pathogens may also indirectly promote abscisic
  acid (ABA) accumulation to inhibit SA production through ICS1. Pathogen detection
  elicits SA biosynthesis via PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4) and ENHANCED DISEASE
  SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) interactions with ICS1 and EDS5, whereas pathogens may activate
  other antagonistic phytohormone pathways via effectors. The accumulation of SA results
  in changes in the cellular redox potential and facilitates thioredoxin (TRX)‐mediated
  NON‐EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS‐RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) deoligomerization; conversely,
  NPR1 re‐oligomerization requires S‐nitrosothiol (SNO), a nitric oxide donor. A recent
  study has indicated that NPR3 and NPR4 act as SA receptors and regulate NPR1 functions.
  NPR1 and TGAs directly regulate PATHOGENESIS‐RELATED 1 (PR1) expression, which results
  in PR1 protein production and secretion into the apoplast, where it exerts its antimicrobial
  activity on the proliferating pathogens. NPR1 also positively regulates TBF1 expression
  and, in turn, TBF1 promotes SA‐dependent BiP2 expression. The resulting BiP2 protein
  binds to Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) regulatory proteins, such as IRE1, to prevent
  activation of the UPR in the absence of biotic stress. IRE1, an endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER)‐bound, transmembrane protein with kinase/endonuclease activity, orchestrates
  the coordinated expression of UPR genes following SA or pathogen treatment. Examples
  of inhibitory effects between jasmonic acid (JA) and SA pathways include the indirect
  negative regulation of the JA pathway by SA, such as indirect inhibition of CORONATINE‐INSENSITIVE
  1 (COI1) by cytosolic NPR1, and JA interaction with COI1, which indirectly inhibits
  the SA pathway. In addition, JA signalling proteins MITOGEN‐ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE
  4 (MPK4) and SUPPRESSOR OF SA INSENSITIVITY 2 (SSI2) indirectly regulate SA‐mediated
  defence. Yellow boxes indicate proteins. Red boxes indicate phytohormones. Solid
  lines indicate direct causation/interaction. Dotted lines indicate indirect causation/interaction.
