caption: Thyroid hormone stimulates cholesterol formation (mostly as VLDL) from its
  precursors and acetyl-CoA. Thyroid hormone increases the expression of Hmgcr and
  Fdps to promote hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Thyroid hormone also strongly induces
  the gene and protein expression of apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1), scavenger receptor
  class B member 1 (SRB1) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2),
  which then increase LDL receptor (LDLR) levels to increase cholesterol efflux from
  peripheral tissues to HDL through the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. Thyroid
  hormone increases HDL metabolism by stimulating cholesteryl ester transfer protein
  (CETP) activity. Thyroid hormone also increases expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
  (CYP7A1), which converts cholesterol into bile acids in the reverse cholesterol
  transport pathway. Thyroid hormone promotes the excretion of bile acids by directly
  increasing ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 5/8 (Abcg5/Abcg8) transporter
  gene transcription. Additionally, thyroid hormone induces miR181d expression, which
  then decreases the expression of caudal-type homeobox protein 2 (CDX2) transcription
  factor and the Soat2 gene to inhibit cholesterol ester formation. ↑/↓ shows increase
  or decrease in thyroid hormone action, respectively. FFA, free fatty acid.
