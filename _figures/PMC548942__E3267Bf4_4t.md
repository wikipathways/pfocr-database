caption: Model for the physiological role of Frat. (A) Current model of canonical
  Wnt-signal transduction. See text for details. (B) Several models could explain
  the observation that Frat is not critically required for canonical Wnt signaling
  in mammals. (Left) Frat might be induced under specific conditions or it might feed
  into the canonical Wnt pathway from a parallel route independent from upstream Wnt
  signals. (Right) Alternatively, Frat might be involved in any of the numerous other
  GSK3-dependent cellular activities, such as the NFκB and NFAT signaling pathways.
