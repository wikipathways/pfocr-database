caption: CdtB induced double strand breaks and activation of the ataxia-teleangiectasia
  mutated (ATM) signalling network. ATM is recruited and fully activated to the site
  of double-strand break (DSB) by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex. Adjacent to
  the site of damage, ATM phosphorylates the histone H2AX (γH2AX) which in turn promotes
  chromatin remodeling and ATM retention at the site of damage. ATM phosphorylates
  and activates the downstream effector checkpoint kinases 1 (CHK1) and 2 (CHK2).
  CHK1 activation induces the accumulation and stabilization of p53 which transcriptionally
  activates the target gene p21. CHK2 phosphorylates and inhibits the cell division
  cycle 25 (CDC25), leading to the downstream hyperphosphorylation and inactivation
  of the cyclin dependent cell division cycle 2 (CDC2) kinase. The checkpoints modulation,
  mediated by ATM, induces cell cycle arrest either in the G1 or G2 phases of the
  cell cycle to allow the DNA damage repair, alternatively, when the damage cannot
  be repaired, this response drives the cell to apoptosis or cellular senescence.
  The ATM signaling in the cytosol activates the Ras homolog gene family, member A
  (RhoA). This process results in the activation of the RhoA/Rho-associated, coiled-coil
  containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK) axis which modulates the organization of the
  actin cytoskeleton, and in the activation of the p38-mediated cell survival pathway.
