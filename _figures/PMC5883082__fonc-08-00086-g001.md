caption: Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) mediated intracellular signaling events
  during T cell activation. (1) Upon T cell activation, the extracellular receptors
  PD-1, CD28, and the T cell receptor (TCR) complex (including CD4 or CD8) bind their
  ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2, CD80 or CD86, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
  class I or II, respectively. This brings all the receptors into close proximity
  with each other at the immunological synapse and allows them to interact with each
  other. (2) The Src kinase Lck (P56Lck), which is bound to the intracellular tail
  of CD4 and CD8, can now phosphorylate the tyrosine residues on the intracellular
  tails of PD-1 and CD28 as well as the CD3ζ chain of the TCR/CD3 complex. (3a) Phosphorylation
  of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) motif on the intracellular
  tail of PD-1 allows recruitment of the Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase
  2 (SHP-2), resulting in the activation of SHP-2 phosphatase activity. SHP-1 may
  also bind PD-1 but to a lesser extent than SHP-2. (3b) Simultaneously, the phosphorylated
  tail of CD28 is now able to recruit PI-3K and Grb2 among other signaling molecules.
  (4) Through close proximity at the immunological synapse, PD-1-associated SHP-2
  can dephosphorylate the cytoplasmic tail of CD28, and to a lesser extent that of
  the CD3ζ chain, therefore preventing the recruitment of further downstream signaling
  molecules associated with these molecules. SHP-2 may also dephosphorylate PD-1,
  causing auto-regulation of this inhibitory pathway. (5) CD28 provides critical signals
  alongside TCR stimulation, and the abrogated binding of PI3K and Grb2 to this receptor
  therefore leads to decreased signaling in pathways important for IL-2 production,
  survival, proliferation, and certain effector functions. In the absence of its ligands,
  PD-1 is not recruited to the immune synapse and can therefore not interfere with
  activation signaling. (6) The inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 primarily restricts CD28
  signaling indirectly by reducing the availability of CD80 and CD86, to which it
  binds with a much higher affinity than the co-stimulatory receptor CD28. Sources
