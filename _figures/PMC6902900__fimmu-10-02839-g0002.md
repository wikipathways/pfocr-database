caption: Overview of cellular metabolism in T cells. The first step of glycolysis
  is the conversion of glucose into glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinases (HK) or glucokinase
  (GCK). During glycolysis, glucose can be shuttled away toward the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), or stay in glycolysis resulting in its conversion into pyruvate.
  Pyruvate can either be converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), using
  the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) produced during glycolysis, or it can
  be converted into acetyl-CoA and enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The TCA
  cycle can also be fueled by acetyl-CoA produced during FAO and α-ketoglutarate following
  glutaminolysis. Subsequently, the TCA cycle fuels OXPHOS and FAS. NADH and reduced
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) are produced during the conversion
  of various metabolites and play an important role in proton homeostasis and ROS
  production via the NADP+ complex and glutathione metabolism. Although all these
  metabolic pathways are interlinked, cells can regulate their isolated activity and
  compensate for alterations in the different pathways. The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway
  plays a role in metabolic regulation through various routes. Glycolysis is stimulated
  via Akt and HIF-1α while fatty acid synthesis and amino acid synthesis are impacted
  by and impact mTORC1. The PI3K-Akt pathway also modulates FOXP3 expression, which
  itself impact metabolism via Myc and Akt signaling. OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  FAO, fatty acid oxidation; FAS, fatty acid synthesis.
