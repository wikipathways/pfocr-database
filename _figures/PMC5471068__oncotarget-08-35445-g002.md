caption: 1) E/R regulates the phosphorylation of STAT3 via activation of RAC1, resulting
  in the transcriptional induction of MYC. 2) E/R can bind to a principal TGF-β signaling
  target, Smad3, which has an inhibitory impact on the response to TGF-β signaling.
  3) E/R can upregulate MDM2 promoter activity; MDM2 functions as a crucial negative
  regulator of p53, repressing its activity. 4) E/R activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  and interferes with proliferation, cell adhesion and DNA damage response. Activation
  of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling also promotes the phosphorylation of MDM2 and its localization
  in the nucleus where it binds to p53. 5) E/R can directly bind the EPOR promoter
  and increase cell survival through activation of the JAK2-STAT5 pathway and upregulation
  of antiapoptotic BCL-XL. EPOR is also one of the upstream signaling components of
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade. All these signal pathways facilitate the E/R
  pre-leukemic state.
