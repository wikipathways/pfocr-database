caption: Potential “Ca. Atribacteria” physiology based on metagenomes and transcriptomes.
  The figure is based on the known interlinking of energy metabolism pathways for
  (homo)acetogenic bacteria () and BMC metabolic functions (), as well as the function
  of the FstZ ring and divisome (). Colored dots correspond to the successive enzymatic
  steps (as listed in ), e.g., fermentation corresponds to glycolysis (11 dots) and
  lactate fermentation (3 dots). Actively expressed genes encoding the divisome complex
  (i.e., FtsAEKQWZ) are indicated at the top right. nPPP, nonoxidative pentose phosphate
  pathway; SLP, substrate-level phosphorylation; DERA, 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate
  aldolase; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; FBEB, flavin-based
  electron bifurcation; FHL, formate hydrogen lyase; WLP, Wood-Ljungdahl pathway.
