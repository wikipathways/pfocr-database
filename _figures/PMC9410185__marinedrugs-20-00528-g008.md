caption: 'Schematic representation of the major mechanisms of action of brentuximab
  and polatuzumab: (A) binding of the ADC to the cell surface antigen (CD30/CD79b);
  (B) internalization of the ADC–cell surface antigen complex into the cell; (C) transportation
  of the ADC to the lysosome; (D) release of MMAE by lysosomal enzyme hydrolysis and
  the inhibition of tubule polymerization, resulting in apoptosis and cell death.
  The elimination of MMAE is mostly through CYP3A4/5 metabolic pathway and excretion
  via bile and feces. The half-life of MMAE is much shorter (~2.5 h) than that of
  the MMAE–antibody conjugate, which is 2.5–3 days [].'
