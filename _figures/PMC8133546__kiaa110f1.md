caption: Central role of acyl-CoAs in cell metabolism. A, In this simplified scheme,
  acyl-CoAs are initially generated from FAs synthesized de novo by the action of
  specific ACSs. B, Acyl-CoAs can be esterified to the sn-1 and sn-2 position of G3P,
  thus generating phosphatidic acid, which serves as a substrate for DAG and other
  membrane glycerolipids. Some specific acyl-CoAs, such as 18:3-CoA, can be further
  elongated and transferred to specific glycerolipids for additional desaturations
  (dashed lines), thus producing very-long chain polyunsaturated FAs (VLC-PUFAs).
  C, Acyl-CoAs can be esterified to the sn-3 position of DAG to form TAG. D, Furthermore,
  acyl-CoAs can be used for the synthesis of a variety of other acyl-molecules, such
  as sphingolipids, acylated proteins, sterol esters, and signaling molecules. E,
  In this scheme, FAs hydrolyzed from membrane glycerolipids or TAG can re-enter the
  pool of acyl-CoAs by the action of other specific ACSs. F, Eventually, acyl-CoAs
  can be degraded via the beta-oxidation pathway occurring in mitochondria and/or
  peroxisomes. Adapted from .
