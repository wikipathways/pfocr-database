caption: Progenitor cells undergo myogenic commitment to produce myoblasts. TWEAK
  decreases self-renewal of progenitor cells and increases their progression in myogenic
  lineage resulting in formation of more myoblasts. Elevated levels of TWEAK inhibit
  differentiation of myoblasts. Whereas high amounts of TWEAK inhibits, low levels
  of TWEAK promote myoblast fusion. Upon injury and in disease conditions, TWEAK attenuates
  regeneration of damaged myofibers. Specific proteins expressed at various stages
  of myogenesis are shown in bottom boxes.
