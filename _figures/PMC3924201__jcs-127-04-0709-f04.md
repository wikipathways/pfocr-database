caption: 'Two mechanisms for growth-factor-mediated regulation of the Hippo pathway:
  activation of Ras-MAPK signaling and activation of PI3K-PDK1 signaling. (Left panel,
  Hippo pathway on) In confluent cells in the absence of growth factors, PDK1 forms
  a complex with Hippo pathway components (Lats, Mst and Sav1) and the Hippo pathway
  is active. Mst phosphorylates Mob and Lats, which then phosphorylate YAP. YAP is
  then excluded from the nucleus and cell growth is arrested. (Right panel, Hippo
  pathway off) Activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway by EGF signaling phosphorylates
  Ajuba, which binds to and inhibits the activity of the Sav�–Wts complex, leading
  to dephosphorylation of Yorkie, its accumulation in the nucleus and increased cell
  proliferation. Growth factors (EGF, LPA or serum) can also activate PI3K and recruit
  PDK1 to the membrane, resulting in the dissociation of the PDK1–Hippo complex. As
  a result, the regulation of Lats by Mst is prevented, which eventually leads to
  nuclear accumulation of YAP and cell proliferation. Figure was modified with permission
