caption: 'Upstream mediators of TXNIP signaling. Possible signaling mechanisms by
  which TXNIP launches abnormal signaling resulting in disease symptoms may include
  the following. In glucose metabolism, the elevation in glucose uptake correlates
  with an increase in mRNA expression of Glut1, which is supported by TXNIP regulation;
  the blue line indicates the modulation of glucose metabolism via inhibition of its
  breakdown and uptake; TLR4 action mediated by MyD88 activates the NF-κB pathway,
  where it interacts with the main intermediaries of inflammation in a TXNIP/NLRP3-associated
  manner and alleviates pyroptosis; upregulated oxidative stress and multiple upstream
  intermediaries upregulate ROS, which further elevates TXNIP expression, thereby
  disrupting the interaction of TXN and ASK1. Hence, liberated ASK1 upon interaction
  with caspase 3 leads to generic apoptosis; the ERS-mediated TXNIP-associated inflammasome
  pathway drives apoptosis and inflammation with an eventual release of cytokines
  (IL-1β and IL-18). Inflammatory-pathway upstream inducers include ROS, glucose,
  and ERS. ERS: endoplasmic-reticulum stress; PERK: protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase;
  IRE1α: inositol-requiring enzyme 1α; eIF-2α: eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  2α; TLR4: toll-like receptor 4; TXN: thioredoxin; TXNR: thioredoxin reductase; TXNIP:
