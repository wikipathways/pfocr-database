caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in muscle atrophy during cachexia. This schematic
  diagram illustrates the major signaling pathways involved in muscle atrophy. Cytokines,
  such as IL-6, activate the NF-κB and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, leading to increased
  protein degradation through transcription of genes encoding ubiquitin ligases, including
  MuRF1 and MAFbx. JAK/STAT signaling also induces apoptosis-associated caspase activation.
  Furthermore, binding of myostatin and activin A to ACTRIIB leads to the activation
  of SMAD 2/3 and downstream FOXO signaling. At the same time, SMAD 2/3 suppresses
  activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is also involved in FOXO
  signaling. In addition, the binding of IGF-1 and insulin to their respective receptors,
  IGF-1R and IR, activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn stimulates
  protein synthesis. In this schematic diagram, the activated signaling pathways are
  indicated in red and the decreased signaling pathways are shown in blue. ACTRIIB:
  Activin type IIB receptor; AKT: Protein kinase B; FOXO: Forkhead box O; IGF-1: Insulin-like
  growth factor-1; IGF-1R: Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor; IL: Interleukin;
  IR: Insulin receptor; JAK/STAT: Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
  transcription; MAFbx: Muscle atrophy F-box; mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin;
  MuRF1: Muscle RING-finger protein-1; NF-κB: Nuclear factor-kappaB; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; SMAD: Smad family member'
