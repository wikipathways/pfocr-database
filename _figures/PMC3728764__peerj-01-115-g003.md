caption: As the role of MCC remains unknown, dashed lines indicate potential scenarios
  for its intermediates originating from central metabolic pathways or from external
  sources. Modules common to all three organisms indicated in red. Modules not shared
  by all three organisms are shown in black. See  for details. MDH, methanol dehydrogenase;
  MADH, methylamine dehydrogenase; NMGP, N-methylglutamate pathway; H4MPT, tetrahydromethanopterin-linked
  pathway for formaldehyde oxidation; RuMP, ribolemonophosphate pathway; FDH1,2, formate
  dehydrogenase enzymes; GndA,B, 6-phosphagluconate dehydrogenase enzymes; MCC, methylcitric
  acid cycle.
