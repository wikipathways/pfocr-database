caption: Metabolic pathway schematic overview. Schematic overview of metabolic pathways
  highlighting the TCA cycle in respect to glutamate, putrescine and GABA synthesis.
  Metabolites and enzymes are color-coded in accordance to compound classes and enzymes
  in the network (Figure , (Supplementary Figure ). Adobe Illustrators was used to
  generate graphical output.
