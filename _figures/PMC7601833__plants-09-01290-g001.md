caption: Model illustrating some of the molecular mechanisms that underlie root gravitropism
  in flowering plants. (A) An Arabidopsis thaliana root tip is positioned horizontally
  (gravistimulated). Auxin flow along the root tip is indicated with yellow bars whose
  widths represent flow intensity. In roots, auxin is transported from the shoot through
  the vasculature into the root tip where it is redistributed laterally to peripheral
  tissues and transported back to the elongation zone (EZ). The gravity vector (g)
  is represented by a red arrow. (B) Upon gravistimulation, amyloplasts sediment within
  the columella cells of the root cap, triggering a signal transduction pathway that
  leads to LZY protein association with the plasma membrane where it recruits RLD
  regulators of vesicular trafficking. RLD then directs PIN3 (and possibly PIN7) transcytosis
  toward the lower membrane, resulting in preferential downward transport of auxin
  and lateral auxin gradient formation across the cap []. (C,D) The auxin gradient
  generated across the cap upon gravistimulation is transported to the elongation
  zone where it promotes differential cell elongation between opposite sides and downward
  curvature. (C) Epidermal cells on the lower side of the root elongation zone (EZ)
  are exposed to high auxin levels, which promote PIN2 retention at the plasma membrane
  through a pathway that involves uncharacterized receptors. Increased auxin levels
  also activate CNGC14 ion channels, leading to increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels and
  activation of a H+/OH- antiporter. This pathway leads to an increase in apoplastic
  pH responsible for wall-polymer crosslinking and inhibition of cell elongation [].
  The plasma membrane associated auxin receptors (labeled IAA-R) involved in these
  processes remain poorly characterized. (D) In the upper half of the root, transporting
  cells are exposed to lower auxin levels, resulting in a decreased retention of PIN2
  within the plasma membrane and lower auxin transport potential on this side of the
  root. Furthermore, decreased auxin levels lead to the activation of H+ pumps, resulting
  in an acidification of the apoplast. Decreased apoplastic pH leads to the activation
  of expansin and XTH enzymes responsible for increased elongation. The combination
  of decreased expansion on the lower side and increased elongation on the upper half
  results in downward root curvature at the distal side of the elongation zone. The
  molecular players are represented by symbols whose identity is revealed in the legend
  on the right of the figure. Yellow arrows indicate auxin transport. Dotted arrows
  represent signal transduction pathways. Blue arrows represent endo- and exocytosis.
  Question marks identify molecules or steps within pathways that are not well characterized.
  The various steps represented in this model are described and discussed in the text
  with appropriate references. Contribution of canonical nuclear SCFTIR-dependent
  expression regulation to the pathways described here is not represented in this
  figure. This figure was inspired from [,,].
