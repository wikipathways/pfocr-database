caption: Proposed model illustrating the function and mechanism of lipid metabolism
  in AKI. Elevated lipid accumulation occurs in the renal tubules of AKI patients.
  UCP1 can eliminate abnormally accumulated lipids through lipid browning. UCP1-induced
  lipid removal activates AMPK/ULK1 pathway-mediated autophagy, thereby reducing the
  inflammatory response and apoptosis of tubule cells, ultimately recovering kidney
  function. LD, lipid droplets.

  acute kidney injury by promoting the AMPK/ULK1/autophagy pathway.
