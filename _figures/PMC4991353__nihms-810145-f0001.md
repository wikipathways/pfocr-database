caption: Wnt5a signals to inactivate Orai1. (1) Upon activation of phospholipase C
  (PLC)-coupled plasma membrane receptors (such as a Gαq/11 coupled GPCR), phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is hydrolyzed to diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (InsP3). (2) InsP3 binds InsP3 receptors leading to Ca2+ release from the ER and
  (3) extrusion from the cell by the plasma membrane ATPase (PMCA). (4) As luminal
  ER Ca2+ concentration falls, Ca2+ dissociates from the EF-hands of STIM1 leading
  it to oligomerize and cluster at ER-PM junctions where it can gate Orai1 channels
  and facilitate store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and (5) reuptake of Ca2+ into
  the ER via the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump. In melanoma
  cells, (6) Wnt5a activates the co-receptors Frizzled (Fzd) and receptor tyrosine
  kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2), part of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway,
  leading to the generation of DAG and InsP3. DAG activates PKC, which is known to
  phosphorylate Orai1 (7), leading to channel inactivation. Invasive melanoma cells
  with high levels of Wnt5a therefore have attenuated SOCE.
