caption: Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. A proposed mechanism for the antioxidant property
  of squalene (SQ), where SQ stimulates the total and phosphorylated Nrf2. The stimulation
  of Nrf2, therefore, activates the transcription of antioxidant or detoxifying enzyme,
  which then causes a reduction in myocardial injury. (1) During normal conditions
  in the cytoplasm, Nrf2 resides as an inactive complex, with its repressor, Keap1.
  (2) Upon activation by oxidative stress (LPS stimulation), an oxidation of Keap1
  cysteine residues or phosphorylation of Nrf2 serine (Ser) 40 may occur with respect
  to protein kinase C (PKC), which subsequently causes the release of Nrf2. (3) Nrf2
  is then translocated into the nucleus and (4) dimerized with a small transcription
  factor, sMaf, forming a heterodimer. It then (5) binds to the antioxidant response
  element (ARE) genes. ARE is responsible for the regulation of antioxidant or detoxifying
  enzyme transcription. This figure is modified from Vomhof-DeKrey and Picklo, 2012
