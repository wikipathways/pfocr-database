caption: Model of the YjeE/YeaZ/YgjD essential signal transduction network. Although
  preferentially associated with YgjD, YeaZ engages in partner switching in response
  to an undefined signal, binding with YjeE instead, and free YgjD can then accumulate
  within the cell. ATP binding or hydrolysis by YjeE is thought to reverse the partner
  switch, allowing YeaZ to form a complex with YgjD, which is then subjected to proteolysis.
  The RstB histidine kinase phosphorylates its cognate response regulator RstA, thus
  activating the expression of a specific set of genes whose identity is still unknown.
  It remains to be determined whether YgjD is in fact activated through proteolysis
  or simply degraded, where it acts in the cell or within the RstB/RstA pathway to
  control essential functions, and how RstA overexpression is able to compensate for
  the absence of YjeE, YeaZ, or YgjD.
