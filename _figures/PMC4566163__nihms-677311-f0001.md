caption: (a) Schematic of contrasting DNA labeling strategies. The most common approach
  to tracking DNA synthesis is by accessing the nucleotide salvage pathway with labeled
  thymidine (e.g. 15N-thymidine, 3H-thymidine) or halogenated nucleotide analogues
  (e.g. bromodeoxyuridine-BrdU). In contrast, D-water is incorporated by de novo nucleotide
  synthesis. (b) During cell division, rapid DNA synthesis coincides with complete
  replication of the genome, which should lead to rapid D incorporation, exceeding
  incorporation by maintenance biosynthetic pathways (e.g. protein turnover). During
  chase, D contained in protein will be diluted by ongoing turnover, whereas signal
  contained in genomic DNA remains relatively stable until the next cell division.
