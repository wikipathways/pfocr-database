caption: Transcriptional regulatory networks of abiotic stress signals. Signal transduction
  pathways in drought, heat and cold-stress responses are either ABA-dependent or
  ABA independent. In the ABA-dependent pathway, ABRE functions as a main ABA-responsive
  element. MYB2 and MYC2 function in ABA-inducible gene expression of the RD22 gene.
  MYC2 also functions in JA-inducible gene expression. The RD26 NAC transcription
  factor is involved in ABA and JA-responsive gene expression in stress responses.
  DRE is mainly involved in the regulation of genes not only by drought and salt but
  also by cold stress. DREB1/CBFs are involved in cold-responsive gene expression.
  DREB2s are important transcription factors in dehydration and high salinity stress-responsive
  gene expression. Another ABA-independent pathway is controlled by drought and salt,
  but not by cold.
