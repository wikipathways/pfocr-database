caption: Development of thrombotic microangiopathy with loss of normal complement
  regulatory factor function. Loss of alternative complement pathway regulation caused
  by loss of function of factors H and I, membrane co-factor protein or thrombomodulin
  results in complement activation directed against endothelial cells. a Mutated complement
  factor H cannot bind to cell surface C3b to stop alternative complement pathway
  attack. b Mutated complement factor I cannot cleave C3b. c Mutated membrane co-factor
  protein cannot work with factor I to degrade C3b. d Mutated thrombomodulin cannot
  bind C3b and accelerate factor I-medicated inactivation of C3b. It cannot activate
  thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), which inactivates anaphylatoxins
  C3a and C5a. It also cannot bind thrombin. With the loss of these regulatory functions
  of each of these factors C3b is not inactivated and progression of the complement
  cascade ensues. C3b then binds with Bb and then further C3b bind to this complex,
  which forms C5 convertase. This cleaves C5 to C5b and the resulting cascade results
  in formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). C3a and C5a act as anaphylatoxins,
  which attract neutrophils to the cells under complement attack. Activating mutations
  of factor B and C3b also result in progression of the complement pathway. The result
  of any of these mutations is endothelial cell damage, causing exposure of the subendothelial
  matrix. This results in a prothrombotic state with fibrin deposition and release
  of von Willebrand factor, which attracts platelets to the site. Platelets will aggregate.
  The result is a full complement attack and thrombus formation. Partial or complete
  vessel occlusion will result. This will produce platelet consumption and red cell
  damage and TMA is the result
