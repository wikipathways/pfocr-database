caption: A model describing the copper transport system and its association with AD.
  Cu+ is taken up into brain cells by CTR1. DMT1 is involved in Cu2+ uptake. Accumulated
  Cu is sequestered into specific cellular locations by different Cu chaperones, such
  as CCS, COX17, and ATOX1. ATOX1 is suggested to transfer Cu+ to ATP7A and ATP7B,
  which help to import Cu+ into synaptic vesicles for release and/or directly mediate
  Cu export. Excessive intracellular Cu+ may activate the Fenton reaction to increase
  oxidative stress. Furthermore, Cu2+ is involved in the expression of the MMP responsible
  for the degradation of Aβ by activating the GSK3β pathway, which also contributes
  to tau hyper-phosphorylation. In the synaptic cleft, Cu binds to Aβ and facilitates
  the formation of senile plaques. CTR1, copper transporter 1; ATP7A, copper-transporting
  P-type ATPase; CCS, copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase; COX17, cytochrome
  oxidase enzyme complex; ATOX1, antioxidant protein-1; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases;
  GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β.
