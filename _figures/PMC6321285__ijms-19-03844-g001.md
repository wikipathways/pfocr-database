caption: HGF/c-MET signaling. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is mainly produced and
  secreted by mesenchymal cells as an inactive precursor, pro-HGF. Cleavage of pro-HGF
  to active HGF, followed by its binding to c-MET on epithelial cells, results in
  the dimerization of two c-MET molecules, and structural changes in a multi-substrate
  docking site. Recruitment of GRB2 to this site induces the autophosphorylation and
  binding of various transducers. Son of Sevenless (SOS) can recruit RAS-GTP to the
  membrane and active RAS-GTP can trigger the MAPK/ERK pathway. The autophosphorylated
  residue of c-MET acts also as a docking site for PI3K, which activates the AKT/mTOR
  pathway. Pathway activation drives transcriptional programs that mediate a plethora
  of cell phenotypes, including these participating in morphogenesis, proliferation,
  survival, motility, and invasiveness. The MET-triggered MAPK/ERK pathway is primarily
  involved in cell proliferation, whereas PI3K recruitment is required for the survival
  and induction of cell motility and invasion. RAC1-PAK signaling contributes to activities
  in other pathways.
