caption: Mechanisms of estrogen hormone actionEstrogens mediate their responses through
  estrogen receptors (ERs) via multiple methods. Ligand activated ERs are influenced
  by coregulators (activators and/or repressors), which affect ER activity. Activated
  ERs can respond genomically or non-genomically. Non-genomic responses may be mediated
  by G-protein linked 30 (GPR30), ER-α-36, or by other putative ERs. Genomic responses
  occur by classical and non-classical pathways. The classical ER pathway involves
  ERs directly binding to estrogen response elements (ERE), whereas non-classical
  methods involve ERs binding to various transcription factors (TF), which in turn
  bind to various transcription factor response elements (TFRE) such as AP-1 and SP-1.
  Alternatively, ERs may be phosphorylated and directly bind EREs. The classical pathway
  involves ligand activation of ER-α and/or ER-β and a chief regulatory aspect involves
  dimerization. Three potential dimers can be generated (α/α, β/β, α/β), each with
  profound differences in specificity of gene transcription. * phosphorylated ER may
  be ligand independent and bound to ERE. **non-genomic responses are typically rapid
  but ultimately lead to genomic responses.
