caption: 'Schematic of the retinoic acid signalling pathway during development. Maternal
  diet-derived retinol/ in blood/yolk sac/yolk of embryo bound to retinol binding
  protein 4 (RBP4) enter cellular cytoplasm via binding to membrane bound RBP/RA complex
  receptor STRA6 (Stimulated by Retinoic Acid 6). Retinol is then bound to cellular
  retinol binding protein (CRBP) and reversibly oxidised to the intermediate form
  retinaldehyde (also known as retinal) by alcohol dehydrogenase and retinol dehydrogenase
  (particularly RDH10) enzymes. The reverse reaction, retinaldehyde to retinol is
  catalysed by the dehydrogenase/reductase 3 (DHRS3) enzyme. Retinaldehyde can also
  be generated from β-carotene by β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase (BCO). Retinaldehyde
  is then irreversibly converted to retinoic acid (RA) by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase
  (RALDH) enzymes, particularly RALDH2. RA can then undergo three different processes:
  (1.) RA bound to cellular retinoic acid binding proteins which shuttle RA to the
  nucleus. Hetero-dimerised RAR-RXR complexes (retinoic acid receptor-retinoid-X-receptor)
  are bound to conserved retinoic acid responsive elements (RARE) within the promotors
  of target genes. Most frequently, in the absence of RA co-repressor complexes (e.g.
  NCoR/SMRT) are bound to the RAR-RXRs, preventing transcription. Upon RA binding,
  the receptors undergo a conformational change, releasing co-repressor complexes
  and recruiting co-activator proteins (e.g. SWI/SNF, pCIP/p300, PolII) as replacements,
  thus triggering transcription activation of target genes. (2.) RA produced in one
  cells can also signal in a paracrine fashion to neighbouring cells, mediating non-cell
  autonomous effects. (3.) If Cytochrome P450 subfamily 26 (CYP26) enzymes are present
  in the cell, RA is hydroxylised in the cytoplasm to more polar metabolites with
  less biological activity, which are further processed by UDP-gluconyl transferases
  and eventually eliminated from the cell. Adapted from Niederreither and Dolle 2008
