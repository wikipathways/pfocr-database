caption: Prominent changes upon ageing in the central carbon metabolism. a The glucose
  metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle of HPCs are depicted, with arrows
  representing unidirectional reactions and strokes representing bidirectional reactions.
  The gene names of the respective enzymes are written in capital letters and the
  colour codes for changes upon ageing, as described in the legend. A star indicates
  that the particular protein was not covered for quantification. Apart from the main
  glycolytic pathway, glycogen breakdown as well as a part of the pentose phosphate
  pathway is shown. b Measurements of relative amounts of phosphorylated metabolites
  relevant to the preparatory phase of the glycolytic pathway and the pentose phosphate
  pathway. The age of the respective donor (x-axis) is plotted against the relative
  amount of metabolites (y-axis) after normalizing for the cumulative amount of the
  given metabolites detected in each donor. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient
  is indicated as rho. c Similar to a, the scheme depicts the effects of ageing on
  a specific set of enzymes involved in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty
  acids. d Volcano plots of all proteins quantified in the respective cell populations.
  The dashed lines indicate p values of 0.1 and 0.05. Proteins represented in a and
  c are colour coded according to the legend. All other proteins are coloured grey.
  a–d The p values (p) are based on Spearman's correlation analyses
