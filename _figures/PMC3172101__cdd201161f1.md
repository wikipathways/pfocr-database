caption: New additions to the Hippo pathway in flies (a) and man (b). In white are
  components of the Hippo pathway familiar to attendees of the first Hippo workshop
  in 2009. In blue are new components reported at the second Hippo workshop in 2010,
  discussed in this report. Notable are the large number of components that function
  upstream of the core kinase cassette, including a number of junction-associated
  proteins (Amot, Aspp, Ajuba/Jub, ZO-2, Willin/FRMD6, α-catenin, Crumbs). Also notable
  are new kinases (Src, Abl, JNK) that modulate YAP/Yki signaling, as well as new
  transcriptional regulators (Wbp2, Wrn). In light blue are components introduced
  at the last meeting, but whose functions were further elucidated at the 2010 meeting
  (Kibra, RASSF). The diagrams are not complete, but highlight the new information
  shared at the latest meeting
