caption: The RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathway is represented with gene expression
  (log2 fold-change) values overlaid at all post-infection time points; shown from
  left to right are the 2, 6, 24 and 48 hpi time points, respectively. The colour
  intensity corresponds to the level of upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue)
  in the M. bovis-infected versus the control non-infected alveolar macrophages. Genes
  coloured in grey were not significantly DE and genes coloured in white were filtered
  out due to low expression.
