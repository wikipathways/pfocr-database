caption: A schematic representation of the IFN-γ receptor-mediated intracellular signalling
  pathways and its defective function within patients with heterozygous dominant negative
  IFN-γR1 deficiency. The truncated R1 chain paired with the wild-type R1 chain is
  able to bind the IFN-γ homodimer but is incapable of inducing signalling. Furthermore,
  unlike receptors comprising paired wild-type IFN-γR1 chains, these abnormal receptor
  complexes do not recycle following ligand binding, resulting in their accumulation
  at the cell surface.
