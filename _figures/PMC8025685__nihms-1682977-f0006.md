caption: The distinction between direct and opportunity costs associated with synthesizing
  monomeric building blocks. These costs are only evaluated at the point where a precursor
  molecule is first exploited in the biosynthetic pathway, as any earlier processing
  (and either gain or loss of energy) would occur regardless of the downstream modes
  of precursor utilization. The direct cost represents the basic biochemical expenditures
  involved in producing the monomeric building block, which must be taken out of the
  cell’s total energy budget. When a precursor molecule has been utilized, the opportunity
  cost represents the degree to which this loss robs the cell of energy that could
  be used in other processes. The cost of an entire trait further entails costs of
  processing, assembling, and maintaining the structure derived from the underlying
  monomeric components.
