caption: Schematic model for the regulation of stability of platelet aggregation in
  response to thrombin. PAR1 stimulation by thrombin induces transient Ca2+ and PKC
  signals, which are responsible for eliciting initial but reversible platelet aggregation.
  During platelet activation, ADP is released from platelets and then acts on the
  P2Y12 receptor to activate PI3K, which turns to recruit PDK-1 and contributes to
  maintenance of PKC activation. These events help to stabilize and maintain PAR1-mediated
  platelet aggregation. In addition, PAR4 stimulation by thrombin induces slow but
  prolonged Ca2+ and PKC signals, which are independent of the P2Y12/PI3K pathway,
  and thus provides additional support for maintaining irreversible platelet aggregation
  in response to thrombin. PAR, proteinase-activated receptor; PDK-1, phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase-1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C.
