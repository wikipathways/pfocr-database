caption: JCV T-antigen is downregulated by glucose deprivation in an AMPK-dependent
  manner. During periods of glucose deprivation, T-antigen inhibits AMPK phosphorylation,
  which prevents the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent cytotoxicity.
  Additionally, T-antigen relieves AMPK-mediated cyclin B1 and cyclin A inhibition,
  leading to decreased G1 arrest. Glucose deprivation induces both enhanced glycolytic
  flux to maintain high levels of ATP production as well as enhanced pentose phosphate
  pathway activation to supply reducing equivalents in the form of reduced nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to counteract ROS production produced by
  glycolysis. T-antigen upregulates transaldolase-1 (TALDO1) expression to shift intermediates
  from the pentose phosphate pathway towards glycolysis to enhance ATP production
  and also prevents hexokinase 2 (HK2) upregulation during glucose deprivation. (HK2,
  hexokinase; G6PDH, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6-PGDH, 6-phoshogluconate
  dehydrogenase; TKTL, transketolase; PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;
  2-DG, 2-deoxyglucose; 6-AN, 6-aminonicotinamide; OT, oxythiamine).
