caption: 'Detailed part of flavonoid metabolic subnetwork showing the subset of nodes
  or metabolites that constitute the process. The enzyme name, unigene names and expression
  patterns of each step are placed next to it. The square represents the difference
  multiple of ZZ_1 and HX_1 expression (log2 (HX_1 / ZZ_1)), the circle represents
  the FPKM value of ZZ_1, and the depth of color indicates the level of expression
  and difference. PAL: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; 4CL: 4-coumarate CoA ligase; C4H:
  trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase; HCT: shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase; CHS:
  chalcone synthase; CHI: chalcone isomerase; F3H: flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H:
  flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H: flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase; FLS: flavonol synthase;
  DFR: dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS: anthocyanidin synthase; GT: anthocyanidin
  5,3-O-glucosyltransferase; ANR: anthocyanidin reductase; UFGT: anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase;
