caption: 'Cross-metathesis between v and 1a via symmetrical metallacyclobutane iv′
  (pathway on the right, in black) is more likely than one entailing the intermediacy
  of complex iv″ (pathway on the left, in red). This is as a result of greater steric
  pressure between the Ca substituent and the sizeable aryloxide ligand [see: Nguyen,
  T. T., Koh, M. J., Shen, X., Romiti, F., Schrock, R. R. & Hoveyda, A. H. Science
  352, 569–575 (2016)]. Cycloreversion of iv′ would then re-generate v and afford
  1a (nonproductive process).'
