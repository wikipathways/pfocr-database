caption: Process of carbamylation. Carbamylation occurs through two primary pathways
  that converge due to the spontaneous reactivity of isocyanate with lysine residues
  and the N-termini of nascent polypeptides. The first and predominant pathway is
  the spontaneous dissociation of urea to cyanate and ammonia. The second pathway
  is the conversion of thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide to cyanate under the action
  of myeloperoxidase. Once cyanate is formed, it is converted into isocyanate, and
  the spontaneous and irreversible process of carbamylation commences. MPO, myeloperoxidase.
