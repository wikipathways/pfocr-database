caption: Bacterial effectors that target and manipulate the innate immune and inflammatory
  pathways. Upon LPS stimulation, the TLR4 dimer associates with MD2 and forms a complex
  with CD14 to signal through the cytoplasmic tails of TLR4. Stimulated TLR4 binds
  MyD88 and Mal (also TIRAP), which recruits IRAK1/4, TRAF6, and TRICA1 to stimulate
  inflammatory cell survival pathways (MAPK and NF-κB). Bacterial effector proteins
  inhibit this process in many different ways. MprF, from Staphylococcus aureus, repels
  cationic defensin peptides electrostatically. ClpX proteolytically degrades defensin
  molecules. The M1 protein binds and sequesters the AMP LL-37. YopK shields the Type
  III translocon from being recognized by host intracellular sensors. Tir, while functioning
  to maintain intimate contact between A/E pathogens and host, also utilizes ITIM-like
  motifs to downregulate TLR signaling. OspF possesses phosphothreonine lyase activity,
  which potently downregulates the MAPK cascade through covalent modification. OspI
  prevents TRAF6 auto-polyubiquitinylation to reduce NF-κB signaling. YopJ is an acetyl
  transferase that targets the MAPK pathway and also has activity against TAK1. LF
  cleaves the amino terminus of MAPKK1/2. AvrA inhibits the JNK pathway through acetyltransferase
  activity toward MAPKKs. IpaH9.8 targets the NEMO complex for proteasomal degradation.
  OspG binds to ubiquitinylated E2 enzymes to prevent the eventual ubiquitinylation
  of IκBα. NleC is a protease that degrades the p65 subunit of NF-κB. NleE modifies
  TAB2 and TAB3 to regulate NF-κB signaling.
