caption: The TNFR1-driven pathway is depicted here, though the regulatory mechanisms
  shown generally apply to Fas, TRAIL receptor, and TLR-driven necroptosis. TNFR1
  ligation triggers formation Complex I, which includes RIPK1 and cIAP1/2. Phosphorylation
  and ubiquitination events within this complex lead to canonical NF-kB activation.
  RIPK1 deubiquitination leads to its egress from complex I and formation of secondary
  complexes in the cytosol. The necrosome is among these. In the necrosome, RIPK1
  interacts with RIPK3 via the RHIM domain (green) shared by both proteins. This interaction
  promotes reciprocal phosphorylation and RHIM-driven oligomerization. However, RIPK1
  can also interact with a complex containing caspase-8 and FLIP, which suppresses
  necrosome formation. Caspase-8/FLIP are recruited via their death effector domains
  (DEDs, in orange) to the adapter FADD, which interacts with RIPK1 via its death
  domain (DD, red). The necrosome is also inhibited by the IAPs (both cIAP1/2 and
  XIAP) via their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, though the molecular details of this
  regulation are not fully understood. Necrosome assembly promotes phosphorylation
  and activation of the pseudokinase MLKL, which translocates to and disrupts cellular
  membranes. This leads to cellular swelling and necroptosis.
