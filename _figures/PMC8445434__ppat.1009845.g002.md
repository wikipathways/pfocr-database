caption: A summary of the distribution of plastids, photosynthesis, and plastid genomes
  is plotted on the tree (the Chromera plastid genome is shown linear, and the dinoflagellate
  plastid genomes are fragmented into many small chromosomes). The presence of 4 genes
  involved in chlorophyll synthesis (acsF, chlL, chlN, and chlB) on the corallicolid
  plastid genome are shown in dark green on a simplified plastid map. The putative
  function of these enzymes in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway is presented. All
  other enzymes in this pathway (chlM, chlG, and dvr) are ancestrally plastid-targeted
  proteins that are encoded by nuclear genes (so their presence in corallicolids remains
  to be tested as genomic data are not yet available). DPOR, dark-operative protochlorophyllide
  reductase; RNAP, RNA polymerase.
