caption: 'Schematic representation of the four ErbB receptors. The extracellular region
  of the ErbB receptors EGFR1, ErbB2 (HER2), ErbB3 (HER3) and ErbB4 (HER4) comprises
  four domains (I–IV). Domains I and III are closely related in sequence, as are domains
  II and IV. EGFR1 is regulated by peptide ligands, including epidermal growth factor
  (EGF), transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), epigen (EP), heparin binding EGF-like
  growth factor (HB-EGF), betacellulin (BTC) and amphiregulin AR). Activation of the
  ErbB receptors leads to dimerization, auto- and transphosphorylation of specific
  tyrosine residues at the C-terminus, recruitment of several intracellular signaling
  proteins, and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling pathways. (1) The
  RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway: after receptor activation, the complex formed by growth
  factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and son of sevenless (SOS) binds directly
  or through association of adapter protein Shc2 to specific tyrosine residues on
  the receptor. This leads to conformational change in SOS, which can recruit and
  activate Ras. Ras activates Raf, which further activates extracellular regulated
  kinases (ERK) mediated through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) MEK1/2.
  (2) The JAK–STAT pathway: the binding of SRC induces when JAKs is recruited through
  the activation of ErbB receptors. This leads to STAT phosphorylation, which is finally
  translocated to the nucleus and induce the transcription of specific genes. (3)
  The PLCγ–PKC-CAMK cascade: PLCγ stimulate the production of DAG and IP3 through
  the activation of PIP2. The binding of DAG and IP3 to the endoplasmic reticulum
  leads to calcium release and this activate both CaMK and PKC. (4) The PIL3-AKT-mTOR
  signaling cascade: PI3K phosphorylate the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2 ) and this leads to the activation of Akt. This signal transfers to intracellular
  targets such as caspase 9, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), PTEN and SH2 domain-containing
  inositol 5′-phosphatase (SHP).'
