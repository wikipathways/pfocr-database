caption: The EGFR pathway in Drosophila. Three membrane-anchored ligands—Spitz (SPI),
  Gurken (GRK), and Keren (KRN)—are retained in the ER, and are processed following
  trafficking by the chaperone protein Star, which is dedicated to these molecules,
  to the Rab4/14 compartment in the secretory pathway. In this compartment, the ligands
  encounter Rhomboid proteins, seven-transmembrane-span intramembrane serine proteases,
  which cleave the ligand precursors within the transmembrane domain, to release the
  active, secreted form. Rhomboids also reside in the ER cleave and inactivate Star,
  thus attenuating the level of ligand precursor that is trafficked to the Rab4/14
  compartment. Within the receiving cells, the ligands encounter the EGF receptor,
  which on dimerization triggers the canonical SOS/Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway. The cardinal
  transcriptional output of the pathway is mediated by the ETS protein Pointed (PNT).
  In addition, the ETS protein YAN provides a constitutive repressor, which competes
  for Pointed binding sites, and can be removed from the nucleus and degraded upon
  phosphorylation by ERK. Several negative regulators keep the pathway in check. Especially
  important is a group of inducible repressive elements, which constitute a negative-feedback
  loop. Argos is a secreted molecule, which sequesters the ligand SPI, whereas Sprouty
  and Kekkon1 attenuate signaling within the receiving cell.
