caption: Pathway map for “LRRK2 and immune function in Parkinson’s disease”. Significant
  up-regulation of genes was denoted as up-pointing bars colored in red, and significant
  down-regulation of genes was denoted as down-pointing bars colored in blue. The
  length of the colored bar was proportional to the fold change of the gene in the
  meta-analysis
