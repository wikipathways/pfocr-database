caption: KEGG Map Display of Biosynthetic Cluster Genes. An experimentally verified
  biosynthetic cluster from NCBI with Genbank ID X58833 has 6 genes (Fig. 9 (i)).
  The KEGG Map shows the genes in this cluster only partially covers the Actinorhodin
  pathway. The boxes colored in magenta in the pathway map are linked to genes of
  this cluster, while the boxes colored in purple are genes in the same genome but
  not in the cluster (Fig. 9 (ii)). By adding 5 additional upstream and downstream
  genes, a new cluster will be able to cover the entire pathway (Fig. 9 (iii))
