caption: 'The biogenesis of an miRNA is a stepwise process that includes (i) transcription
  of a primary transcript (pri-miRNA), (ii) nuclear cropping to produce the pre-miRNA,
  (iii) export to the cytoplasm, and (iv) cytoplasmic cropping to a ds miRNA precursor.
  miRNA genes are generally transcribed into long, 5′-capped, and 3′-polyadenylated
  transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and subjected to a primary
  processing step by a nuclear enzyme of the RNase III family, Drosha in the microprocessor
  complex. The primary processing products, hairpin-loop RNAs known as precursor-miRNAs
  (pre-miRNAs) are recognized by the Exportin-5 (Xpo5)/Ran-GTP transporter and exported
  to the cytoplasm, where an another enzyme of the RNase III family, Dicer, catalyzes
  the secondary processing to produce miRNA/miRNA* duplexes. Dicer, TRBP, and Argonaute
  (Ago) proteins mediate the processing of pre-miRNAs and the assembly of the RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC) in humans. In most cases, one strand of each duplex remains
  on the Ago protein as the mature miRNA; the other strand (miRNA*) is degraded. Ago
  associates with Dicer in both the cropping and RISC assembly steps. Every molecule
  that plays a role in miRNA biogenesis and RISC assembly can be regulated in response
  to environmental changes or physiological stimuli. Mutations and dysregulation of
  the expression of miRNA pathway molecules can contribute to human cancer. 5′ cap:
  5′-7-Methylguanosine cap; poly(A): polyadenylation; TRBP: transactivation-responsive
  RNA-binding protein; CDS: coding sequence, UTR: untranslated region;'
