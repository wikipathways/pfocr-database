caption: Heparanase-2 prevents inflammation by stabilizing membrane bound heparan
  sulfate from heparanse-1 degradation. (A) In quiescent endothelium, the endothelial
  glycocalyx (eGC), here exemplarily represented by the glycosaminoglycan heparan
  sulfate (HS) and the proteoglycan syndecan-1, is a complex layer on top of the endothelial
  surface. Excess heparanase-2 (Hpa-2) stabilizes membrane bound HS and only low concentrations
  of Heparanase-1 (Hpa-1) are found within the circulation (a broad surrogate of its
  local concentration). (B) In septic endothelium, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binds
  to the receptor cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) and is via lymphocyte antigen
  96, MD2, transferred to toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, which is then activated. Downstream
  of TLR4 the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB is activated which leads to
  production and release of cytokines, e.g. interleukin (IL)-6. Consequentially, the
  HS specific glucuronidase Hpa-1 is activated and degrades eGC by cleaving membrane
  bound HS chains. Shed HS fragments circulate and stimulate themselves TLR-4 in turn
  leading to a vicious cycle of inflammation. Unburied adhesion receptors and disruption
  of the endothelial cleft lead to endothelial mediated accelerated inflammation and
  leakage. Hpa-1 up-regulates the expression and activity of the coagulation initiator-
  tissue factor (TF) and at the time interacts with the tissue factor pathway inhibitor
  (TFPI) on the cell surface membrane of endothelial cells, leading to dissociation
  of TFPI and therefore resulting in increased cell surface coagulation activity.
  Additionally, loss of HS chains enables increased platelet aggregation and mediates
  loss of antithrombin-III activity. Free circulating HS fragments trigger production
  of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in (septic) cardiomyopathy.
  At the same time they competitively inhibit brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
  leading to cognitive dysfunction. Hpa-2 prevents membrane bound HS from being shed
  by Hpa-1. Therefore, LPS cannot be transferred from CD14 to TLR-4 and downstream
  signaling is inhibited. Circulating HS fragments are likely to be antagonized by
  Hpa-2 as well. As an acquired deficiency of Hpa-2 is found in sepsis, these protective
  functions are most likely critically diminished.
