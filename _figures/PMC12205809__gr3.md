  breast cancer women or animal model/senescence cells, as depicted in the illustration.
  (A) Schematic diagram of legumain (Lgmn−/− mice) deletion mediating the inhibition
  of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) pro-tumor effects and promoting tumor senescence.
  TAM-derived legumain suppresses signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1 (STAT1) signaling in an autocrine manner. Deletion of legumain led to the sustained
  activation of STAT1 signaling, stimulating inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
  expression and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and thus
  contributing to the increased expression and secretion of IL-1β and promoting tumor
  senescence. The regulatory effect of legumain secretion on STAT1 inhibition via
  interaction with integrin αvβ3 in TAMs. (B) In aged patients, IL-6 is up-regulated,
  which recruits bone marrow cells and plays a role in the survival of tumor cells.
  These processes can be inhibited by tocilizumab/STING/interferon (IFN)/STAT1 pathways.
  IL-6 can stimulate the expression of lysine-specific demethylase 2A (KDM2A) in normal
  fibroblasts, transforming them into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Up-regulation
  of KDM2A in these cells induces senescence in fibroblasts, which is dependent on
  p53, and enhances the release of IL-6. Inducing senescence in CAFs up-regulates
  programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which reduces the natural killer (NK) cells
  to target the tumor microenvironment (TME). The up-regulation of IL-6 induces chemoresistance
  and metastasis progression in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) through the Wnt-5
  pathway. (C) In both in vitro and an animal model of breast cancer, the up-regulation
  of IL-8/C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) induces senescent of breast cancer,
  inflammation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stemness via the Janus
  kinase 2 (JAK2) and STAT3 pathways. The red color up arrow symbol (↑) represents
  up-regulation, while the down arrow symbol (↓) represents down-regulation
