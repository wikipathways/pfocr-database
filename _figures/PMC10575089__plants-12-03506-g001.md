caption: Zeaxanthin metabolic pathway in plants. Enzymatic reactions are represented
  by arrows. The dashed arrow represents several enzymatic reactions. Enzymes are
  indicated in blue text. GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; PSY, phytoene synthase;
  PDS, phytoene desaturase; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase; CRTISO, carotenoid isomerase;
  ζ-carotene isomerase; LCYE, lycopene ε-cyclase; LCYB, lycopene β-cyclase; β-OHase,
  β-carotene hydroxylase; ε-OHase, ε-carotene hydroxylase; ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase;
  VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase; NXS, neoxanthin synthase; CCD, carotenoid cleavage
  dioxygenase; NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase; and ABA, abscisic acid.
