caption: Regulatory network generated by triple-gene mutual interaction (TGMI) (A)
  and sparse partial least squares (SPLS) (B) for the Arabidopsis thaliana flavanone,
  flavonol and anthocyannin biosynthesis pathway using the microarray data generated
  from hypocotyledonous stem tissues. The green nodes represent pathway genes. All
  other nodes are the top 50 transcription factors that have the highest connectivity
  to pathway genes regardless of their colors. The light coral nodes represent positive
  known TFs of flavanone, flavonol and anthocyannin biosynthesis pathway while the
  red edges are to show the connections of a true positive known pathway regulator
  with pathway genes.
