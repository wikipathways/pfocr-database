caption: Combined metabolomics–transcriptomics identification of pathways affected
  by MPP+. Transcriptomics and metabolomics data of the 24 h treatment sample with
  5 μM MPP+ were used for pathway mapping. Enzymes (corresponding mRNA) and metabolites
  that were upregulated are displayed in red. Blue font indicates decreased levels.
  ATF4 targets are encircled in orange (SLC7A11 has been identified by RNAseq only,
  the other target genes were identified on both transcriptomics platforms). Underlying
  biological processes affected by the indicated changes are displayed in green. CBS,
  cystathionine-β-synthase; CTH, cystathionase; DHFR, dihydrofolatereductase; dTMP,
  deoxythymidine monophosphate; dUMP, deoxyuridine monophosphate; GSH, glutathione;
  MTHFD2, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase;
  PSAT1, phosphoserine aminotransferase 1; PSPH, phosphoserine phosphatase; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; SHMT2, serine hydroxymethyl-transferase; TYMS, thymidylate synthetase.
  M2 citric acid and M2 fumaric acid are downregulated mass isotopomers representing
  the relative downregulation of glucose oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle
