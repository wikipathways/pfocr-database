caption: Innate immunity triggers mobilization of HSPCs. a Pro-mobilizing agents (e.g.,
  G-CSF or AMD3100) activate innate immunity cells (granulocytes, monocytes, and dendritic
  cells) in the BM microenvironment to release danger-associated molecular pattern
  molecules (DAMPs), including extracellular ATP; proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes
  and ROS. b ATP released from innate immunity cells activates in autocrine/paracrine
  manner the Nlrp3 inflammasome after binding to P2X7 and P2X4 receptors. This event
  leads to caspase-1 activation and release from the innate immunity cells of active
  forms of IL-1β and IL-18, which, together with other DAMPs (e.g., HMGB1 and S100A9),
  amplify the mobilization process. Proteolytic enzymes and the lipolytic enzyme PLC-β2
  disrupt the SDF-1–CXCR and VCAM-1–VLA4 anchoring mechanisms for HSPCs in BM niches
  and the structure of lipid rafts, respectively. In parallel on the surface of cells
  in the BM microenvironment, released ROS exposes neoepitope antigens, which, after
  the binding of IgM naturally occurring antibodies, activate the MBL pathway of ComC
  activation. c These innate immune responses amplified by purinergic signaling potentiate
  a mutual interaction between cells and crucial pathways involved in the mobilization
  process and are negatively regulated/controlled at Nlrp3 inflammasome level and
  ComC activation by extracellular adenosine (a degradation product of ATP) and the
  intracellular anti-inflammatory enzyme HO-1. d HSPCs are released from BM niches
  by a steep gradient of S1P in PB. e Also shown in this scheme, by releasing LPS,
  Gram-negative bacteria in the gut positively prime in innate immunity cells the
  Nlrp3 inflammasome complex in an LPS–TLR4-dependent manner, and increase synthesis
  of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
