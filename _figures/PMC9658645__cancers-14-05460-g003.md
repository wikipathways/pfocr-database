caption: 'Role of TAMs and MDSCs in metastasis: 1. Tumor growth and invasion. 1.a.
  TAMs produce MMPs (MMP1/2/3/7/9) and cathepsin. 1.b. Chemokines such as acidic and
  rich in cysteine (SPARC), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18), αvβ5 integrins,
  phosphatidylinositol transfer protein 3 (PITPNM3), epidermal growth factor (EGF),
  EGF receptor (EGFR), colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), and CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R)
  allow the interaction between tumor cells, thus facilitating the invasion step [].1.c.
  MDSCs facilitate the invasion step by producing MMPs and TGF-beta []. 2. Intravasation.
  2.a. TAMs and MDSCs release VEGF-A [,]. 3. Extravasation. 3.a. Metastasis-associated
  macrophages (MAMs) accumulate at the metastatic site and also release VEGF-A. 3.b.
  The CCL2-CCR2 signaling pathway activates the CCL3-CCR1 signaling pathway in MAMs,
  leading to their accumulation in the metastatic site and thus attracting more tumor
  cells and prolonging the process of seeding. 4. Seeding []. 5. The metastatic niche
  in the lungs is induced by MDSCs through the production of CXCL-17 which recruits
  more MDSCs in the lungs, leading to an increase in the levels of platelet-derived
  growth factor-beta (PDGF-beta) that will induce angiogenesis, thus creating favorable
  conditions for metastatic cells [].'
