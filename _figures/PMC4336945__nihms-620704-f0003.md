caption: The physiologic skin pigmentation response (tanning) begins with exposure
  to UV radiation, which causes DNA damage and thus upregulates p53, leading to POMC
  transcription in keratinocytes. POMC is enzymatically cleaved to produce αMSH, which
  binds to MC1R on melanocytes. This triggers the rest of the tanning response, ultimately
  resulting in transcription of MITF and its targets, which include the pigmentation
  enzymes tyrosinase, DCT, and TYRP1. Melanin is produced in melanosomes and transported
  to keratinocytes, where they form protective caps over the keratinocyte nuclei.
  Synthesis of both types of melanins (bottom) begins with the amino acid tyrosine.
  Tyrosinase catalyzes the rate-limiting step for both eumelanin and pheomelanin.
  Eumelanin synthesis additionally requires the enzymes DCT and TYRP1, while pheomelanin
  additionally requires the amino acid cysteine.
