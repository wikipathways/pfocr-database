caption: Schematic illustration of this study. The “lotus-type” topography on PEEK
  was fabricated within a short time by controlling the agitation speed of sulfonation.
  The minimal dimension (SP450) showed greater potential in reducing calcium influx
  through PIEZO1 to modulate nonactivated macrophage polarization to an anti-inflammatory
  M2 phenotype, inducing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and suppressing
  osteoclastic differentiation of macrophages through the inhibition of NF-κB signaling
  pathway by down-regulating TGF-β2. The favorable local immune environment eventually
  facilitates new bone formation and osseointegration
