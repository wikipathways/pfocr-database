caption: Summary of hGMPK's role in the cell. A, hGMPK is positioned at the junction
  of the de novo nucleotide synthesis and salvage pathways. The enzymes IMPDH () and
  GMPS () are biomolecular targets for inhibition and are part of the de novo nucleotide
  synthesis pathway. B, schematic of the hGMPK reaction cycle following a random sequential
  mechanism (, ).
