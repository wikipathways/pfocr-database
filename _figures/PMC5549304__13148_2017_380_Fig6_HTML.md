caption: H3K79 methylation pathway and potential therapeutic targets. Histone acetylation
  is recognized and bound by BET bromodomain proteins (e.g., BRD4) which induced the
  protein complex RNF20/RNF40/WAC activation and H2BK120 ubiquitination. DOT1L which
  activity is stimulated by H2BK120ub1 further methylates H3K79. BRD4 and DOT1L can
  be inhibited by PFI-1 and EPZ5676/SGC0946, respectively
papertitle: Tri-methylation of H3K79 is decreased in TGF-Î²1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition in lung cancer.
