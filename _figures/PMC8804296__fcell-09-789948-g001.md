caption: 'The relationship between pyroptosis and osteoarthritis (OA). Pyroptosis:
  DAMPs and TLRs can interact to exacerbate the inflammatory response. TLRs initiate
  a signaling cascade leading to cell activation, increased release of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathway, and production of associated inflammatory
  factors (including TNF, IL-12, IL-6, IL-8 and pro-IL-1β) that in turn activate a
  strong inflammatory response. The inflammatory response promotes the increased release
  of IL-1β and IL-18 on the cartilage surface exacerbating cartilage damage and also
  enhancing pyroptosis signaling. The NLRP3 inflammasome can activate caspase-1 which
  further activates GSDMD to undergo shearing to form the N-terminal end. The N-terminal
  end of GSDMD leads to cell membrane perforation and ultimately induces pyroptosis.
  Caspases-4/5/11 are also able to activate GSDMD and can induce pyroptosis.'
