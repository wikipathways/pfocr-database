caption: Simplified presentation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling
  in endocrine-resistant breast cancer. The PI3K/AKT pathway is activated by various
  receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)
  is an important downstream effector of PIK3/AKT. Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway promotes cell growth and proliferation. The estrogen receptor (ER) is a
  transcription factor that is activated by estrogen binding and that regulates various
  genes involved in tumor formation. Accumulation and binding of cyclin D to the cyclin-dependent
  kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 leads to cell cycle progression. Drugs to overcome endocrine
  resistance are displayed in red.
