caption: 'Macrophage lipid metabolism disorder and thrombosis. Macrophages phagocytose
  accumulated LDL and modified LDL (such as oxLDL) through multiple cell membrane
  scavenger receptors such as LOX1, SR-A and CD36. In the lysosome, cholesterol ester
  (CE) in LDL particles is degraded to free cholesterol (FC) and free fatty acids
  by lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), FC is re-esterified
  by acetyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), which contributes
  to CE accumulation and lipid droplet formation. CE is hydrolyzed by neutral cholesterol
  ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH1) to release FC, and is further transported to the outside
  of the cell through cholesterol efflux transporters, ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-B1, thereby
  maintaining cholesterol metabolism homeostasis. Under pathological conditions (such
  as AS), excessive accumulation of FC induces the formation of cholesterol crystals
  in the lysosome, which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, induces ER stress, and
  ultimately leads to the formation of foam cells. OxLDL can also activate the NF-κB
  signaling pathway through the CD36–TLR4/TLR6 trimer. Foam cells secrete macrophage
  chemotaxis retention factors (including netrin 1 and its receptor UNC5B, cadherins
  and semaphorin 3E), pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF) and
  chemokines (such as CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL1) amplify the inflammatory response. Over
  time, foam cells undergo apoptosis. When these apoptotic cells cannot be effectively
  cleared by macrophages in advanced disease (defective erythrocytosis), secondary
  necrosis will result. Further development will promote the formation of necrotic
  cores. At the same time, the living macrophages in the late plaque secrete cytokines,
  proteases and procoagulant thrombosis factors, as well as VSMCs death and protease
  degradation of the extracellular matrix. These effects weaken the stability of the
  fibrous cap (easy to rupture). The rupture leads to exposure of the thrombogenic
  substances in these lesions, which eventually causes platelet aggregation and thrombosis,
  resulting in MACE events. ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; ABCG1, ATP-binding
