caption: Potential therapeutics identified as strongly inhibited upstream regulators
  in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Methylprednisolone succinate is predicted to directly
  counteract multiple upregulated inflammatory regulators including NF-kB, STAT2,
  IRF9, and JUN via NR3C1 (a). Simvastatin is predicted to indirectly inhibit multiple
  inflammatory regulators including NF-kB, STAT1, STAT3, Smad, and JUN (b). Darker
  color demonstrates greater magnitude of pathway activation or inhibition
