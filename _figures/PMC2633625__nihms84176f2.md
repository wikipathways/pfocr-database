caption: Each TLR recognizes a different microbial component. TLR2 forms a heterodimer
  with TLR1 or TLR6 to recognize tri- and di-acyl lipopeptides, respectively. TLR4
  recognizes LPS and TLR5 recognizes flagellin. These TLRs are located on the cell
  membrane and become internalized into phagosomes after interaction with their ligands.
  In contrast, TLR3 recognizes viral dsRNA, TLR7 and TLR8 recognize viral ssRNA, and
  TLR9 recognizes hypomethylated DNA (CpG motifs) of both bacteria and viruses and
  are located in intracellular membranes of endosomes and lysosomes. TLRs utilize
  MyD88 and TRIF adapters to initiate signaling. All TLRs except TLR3 can signal via
  MyD88. TLR2 and TLR4 also require the presence of TIRAP. MyD88 initiates a signaling
  cascade that eventually results in activation of NF-κB (and other pathways) to promote
  transcription of immunomodulatory genes. In contrast, TLR3 and TLR4 can also signal
  via TRIF in a MyD88-independent pathway. The TRIF pathway is critical in activating
  IRF3 (and IRF7), which promotes production of type I interferon (i.e. IFNα and IFNβ)
  and anti-viral immune responses.
