caption: Schematic representation of PTH1R-mediated anti-inflammatory effects through
  Gq and β-arrestin-1 pathways. PTH1R is expressed in the Leydig cells of testis and
  the epithelial cells of the cauda of the epididymis. LPS or MuV infection in the
  testis and epididymis induces acute inflammatory responses as evidenced by the morphologic
  injury, increased cell apoptosis, and aberrant production of inflammatory factors
  such as TNF-α, IL6, MCP1, and CXCL10. Activation of PTH1R by ABL, an FDA-approved
  drug for postmenopausal osteoporosis, effectively alleviates MuV- or LPS-induced
  inflammation in the testis and epididymis mainly through combined Gαq-PLC-PKC and
  β-arrestin-1 signaling–dependent mechanisms. The Gs-cAMP pathway partially contributes
  to this anti-inflammatory process. AC, adenylyl cyclase; PLC, phospholipase C; PKC,
  protein kinase C; RO-318220, a specific PKC inhibitor; and YM-254890, a specific
  Gαq inhibitor.
