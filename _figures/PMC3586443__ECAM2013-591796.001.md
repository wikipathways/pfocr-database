caption: 'The role of transient receptor potential vallinoid 1 (TRPV1) in early-phase
  response in allergic rhinitis. Nerve growth factor (NGF) activates tyrosine kinase
  A (TrkA) receptor which in turn increases production and release of substance P
  (SP). Activation of TrkA receptor also initiates signalling via the PI3K/PIP3 pathway
  to increase expression and sensitivity of transient receptor potential vallinoid
  (TRPV1) receptor. TRPV1 receptor increases production and release of proinflammatory
  neuropeptides SP and CGRP which act synergistically to promote degranulation of
  primed mast cells. Histamine released by mast cells activates Histamine 1 receptor
  (H1R) producing signalling via the phospholipase A2/lipoxygenase pathway to activate
  TRPV1, triggering early-phase allergic inflammatory response. NGF: nerve growth
  factor, TRPV1: transient receptor potential vallinoid 1, TrkA: tyrosine kinase A
  receptor, H1R: histamine 1 receptor, SP: substance P, CGRP: calcitonin gene-related
  peptide, PI3K/PIP3: phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/phosphatidylinositol phosphate
  3 pathway, PLA2/LO: phospholipase A2/lipoxygenase pathway.'
