caption: Multiple pathways connect plant oxygen signaling to the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN
  (TOR) kinase. Under hypoxic conditions, degradation of ERF-VII transcription factors
  by the PRT6 N-degron pathway (N-deg) is uncoupled. Accumulation of ERF-VII leads
  to an increase in starch catabolism that, depending on context, may lead to increased
  glucose (Glc) and/or decline in trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P). Glc directly regulates
  the TOR kinase in apical meristems and positively regulates cell division by other
  pathways. The decline in T6P, meanwhile, would de-repress SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE
  1 (SnRK1), which in turn negatively regulates the TOR kinase, both directly and
  indirectly, by promoting abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. A decline in T6P levels
  and an increase in SnRK1 activity have been shown in hypoxic conditions. ABA and
  TOR, meanwhile have a reciprocal antagonistic relationship. Among the transcriptional
  targets of ERF-VIIs under hypoxia are HYPOXIA RESPONSIVE UNIVERSAL STRESS RESPONSIVE
  PROTEIN 1 (HRU1) and RBOHD. Several RBOH genes are induced under hypoxia. HRU1 can
  enhance the activity of RBOHD directly and indirectly via ROH OF PLANT 2 (ROP2),
  and also positively regulates TRX-h. RBOH generates H2O2, which—depending on context—may
  trigger cell division or cell death. ROP2 directly regulates TOR kinase, providing
  a point of convergence between oxygen, ROS, and energy signaling. In addition, SnRK1
  is regulated by redox status, while the relationship to ABA may depend on the physiological
  context (∼). Finally, ERF-VII may regulate TOR kinase by other pathways yet to be
  characterized (?). Dashed arrows indicate indirect relationships.
