caption: 'Schematic of neuregulin-ERBB4 signaling showing the roles of the products
  of the selected genes. The γ-secretase multiprotein complex is constructed from
  the products of the genes: PSEN1, PSEN2, APH1A, APH1B, PSENEN and NCSTN. The cleavage
  of NRG3 by BACE1 is hypothesized and has not been shown experimentally.'
