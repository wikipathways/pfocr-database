caption: The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The PI3K-Akt pathway is involved in some
  crucial cellular processes including protein synthesis and cell proliferation and
  survival. The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated by factors that initiate the PI3K signaling
  pathway via intermediate molecules (IRS), playing an important regulatory role in
  many cellular survival pathways. The pathway can be activated by a variety of signals,
  including growth factors (GF), LPS, and insulin (INS), targeting several downstream
  molecules. This activation is able to modulate cell activities, including cell proliferation,
  glucose metabolism, cell survival, cell cycle, protein synthesis, and neuronal morphology
  and plasticity.
