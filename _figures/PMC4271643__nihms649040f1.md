caption: The retrograde response signaling pathway. This schematic view summarizes
  the core elements of the retrograde response. Stress, whether metabolic or osmotic,
  triggers the pathway, 27 and nutrients modulate the response through TORC1. Rtg2
  sequesters Mks1 when a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential signals mitochondrial
  dysfunction. This prevents the Mks1-Bmh1/2 complex from inhibiting the partial dephosphorylation
  of Rtg3 in the Rtg1-Rtg3 heterodimer. Partial dephosphorylation results in the translocation
  of this transcription factor from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it activates
  retrograde response target genes, resulting in an increase in longevity. The Hog1
  protein kinase, in response to hyperosmotic shock, facilitates this translocation,
  as well. Hog1 is also required for chromatin binding of Rtg1-Rtg3 and the transactivation
  of retrograde response target genes. TORC1 responds to nutrient availability by
  inhibiting retrograde signaling both upstream and downstream of Rtg2. The core retrograde
  response depicted here cross-talks with several other signaling pathways (see text).
  Notably, sphingolipid signaling interacts with the retrograde response modulating
  the effects of TORC1 on autophagy. A key target of ceramide signaling is the PP2A,
  Sit4, one of the mediators of TORC1 signaling. These interactions have important
  implications for cellular quality control. The retrograde response also impacts
  the mutual interaction of mitochondria and the vacuole, with consequences for yeast
  longevity.
