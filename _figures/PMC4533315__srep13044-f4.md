caption: (A) Running-sum statistic is calculated by walking down the edge list, and
  the maximum deviation from zero of the statistic is used as edge enrichment score
  of the pathway. (B) Core subset of edges are extracted and mapped to the pathway
  graph. (C) Downregulation of ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling pathway in Reactome, and the
  biological relationships which correspond to the core edges are annotated with blue.
