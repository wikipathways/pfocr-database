caption: Working model describing the regulation of the CYP81D11 promoter in response
  to -Ile and . The model aims to illustrate that  and  use different but interdependent
  signaling pathways to influence promoter activity and that COI1 can influence the
  promoter through a yet unknown mechanism that is distinct from the well-established
  -Ile-regulated mechanism merging on the G-boxes. It does not represent stoichiometric
  ratios between the interacting regulatory proteins. A, Under conditions of increased
  -Ile levels, COI1 accelerates the degradation of JAZ proteins, thus allowing MYC2
  to activate the promoter. MYC2 stringently requires the presence of TGA transcription
  factors at the as-1-like element, as documented by the representation of the as-1-like
  sequence and the G-boxes as one functional unit on the DNA (shown in yellow). Activation
  of the  pathway is indicated in red. B, Under conditions of increased  levels, the
  TGA/SCL14 complex is activated. Deletion of the G-boxes, mutation in MYC2, expression
  of a dominant negative JAZ protein, and impaired -Ile biosynthesis reduce -induced
  promoter activity by a factor of 3. Since the -induced pathway is still functional
  in the absence of the G-boxes, the as-1-like sequence and the G-boxes are drawn
  as two separate entities (shown in yellow). In addition, COI1 influences the promoter
  even in the absence of its ligand. It remains to be elucidated which proteins are
  targeted by this COI1 activity, whether this mechanism involves protein degradation,
  and which trans-factors are involved. Activation of the chemically induced pathway
  is shown in red.
