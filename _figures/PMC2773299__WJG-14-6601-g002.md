caption: 'Schematic representations of the activated RAS-MAPK, RASSF1A/NORE1A, and
  Dab2IP/ASK1 pathways, iNOS signalling, and FOXM1-related pathways involved in the
  dysregulation of cell growth and apoptosis in HCC. Active Ha-RAS (GTP-RAS) triggers
  the MAPK pathway leading to activation of ERK1/2. Active ERK can down-regulate DUSP1
  by phosphorylation at ser296 allowing the formation of the SKP2/CSK1/DUSP1 complex,
  which facilitates DUSP1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In addition,
  ERK may further contribute to DUSP1 proteolysis via induction of its target FOXM1,
  leading to transcriptional activation of SKP2 and CKS1. These mechanisms result
  in decreased inhibition of ERK by DUSP1 (blunt arrow). Moreover, FOXM1 favors the
  growth of neoplastic cells by targeting genes involved in G2 ← M transition, genomic
  instability, angiogenesis, NF-κB activation, and anti-apoptosis. iNOS activates
  IKK that allows proteasomal degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor, IkB-α. This results
  in NF-κB activation. iNOS also activates Ha-RAS, thus triggering the MAPK pathway
  leading to activation of ERK1/2. NF-κB activation by ERK may occur through AURORA-A
  (AURKA) which inhibits IkB-α. NF-κB activates various antiapoptotic genes (XIAP,
  cIAP1, BCL-xL) and inhibits the proapoptotic gene JNK. The inhibition of RAS activation
  by DAB2IP leads to the activation of ASK1, whereas active RAS favors the formation
  of the RASSF1-NORE1A complex. Both the ASK1 and RASSF1-NORE1A complexes trigger
  pro-apoptotic pathways. ASK1: Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; BCL-Xl: BCL2-related
