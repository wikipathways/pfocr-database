caption: Neural activity in MK-801 and MK-801+EE treated group. EE can promote the
  expression of BDNF and improve the signaling function of BDNF-TrkB. EE can rescue
  the blocking effect of MK-801 on NMDAR in interneurons, promote the expression of
  NMDAR subunits, PSD-95, and GAD 67, and promote GABA neurotransmitter synthesis.
  EE has a neurorepair effect, which can increase the number of PV+ and SST+ GABAergic
  neurons and increase the output of inhibitory signals. EE can rescues the regulation
  of glutamate by astrocytes, increase the number of GFAP positive cells and decrease
  the number of S100B positive cells. EE can activate Wnt/β signaling pathway in oligodendrocytes
  and promote myelin synthesis.
