caption: 'Amino acid biosynthesis in the E. coli iJO1366 model. (A) Schematic representation
  of carbon sources with closely related amino acids. Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis in
  green; TCA cycle in blue and Pentose Phosphate Pathway in purple. (B) Totoro results
  explaining the accumulation of valine (Val) and alanine (Ala) in the pyruvate (Pyr)
  pulse; accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) from the glucose (Glc) pulse and accumulation
  of threonine (Thr) from the succinate (Succ) pulse. For simplicity reasons, side
  compounds and cofactors were excluded from the figure. Dashed arrows indicate several
  reactions from the shikimate and chorismate pathways. Abbreviations for reaction
  names are as follows: VALTA, valine transaminase; VPAMTr, valine-pyruvate aminotransferase;
  CHORM, chorismate mutase; PPNDH, prephenate dehydratase; PHETA1, phenylalanine transaminase;
  ASPTA, aspartate transaminase; ASPK, aspartate kinase; ASAD, aspartate-semialdehyde
  dehydrogenase; HSDy, homoserine dehydrogenase; HSK, homoserine kinase; THRS, threonine
  synthase; THRD_L, L-threonine deaminase.'
