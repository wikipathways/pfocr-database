caption: 'Cytoplasmic/traditional and nuclear modes of the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway. The EGFR signalling pathway exerts its biological
  effects via two major modes of actions, namely, cytoplasmic/traditional (A) and
  nuclear (B) modes. (A) The cytoplasmic EGFR pathway is consisted of four major modules:
  PLC-γ-CaMK/PKC, Ras-Raf-MAPK, PI-3K-Akt-GSK and signal transducer and activator
  of transcriptions (STATs). Activation of these signalling modules often leads to
  tumorigenesis, tumour proliferation, metastasis, chemoresistance and radioresistance.
  (B) The nuclear EGFR pathway can be initiated by ligand binding and exposure to
  vitamin D, radiation, cisplatin, heat and H2O2. Following nuclear translocalization,
  nuclear EGFR interacts with DNA-binding transcription factors, E2F1 and STAT3, and
  activates expression of B-Myb and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), respectively.
  Nuclear EGFR also upregulates cyclin D1 gene expression. Increased expression of
  cyclin D1 and B-Myb contributes to accelerated G1/S cell cycle progression and,
  on the other hand, elevated iNOS is associated with tumour proliferation and metastasis.
  Upon DNA damage and oxidative/heat stress, EGFR enters the cell nucleus and interacts
  with DNA-PK, leading to DNA repair and radioresistance. Reprinted from Lo and Hung
