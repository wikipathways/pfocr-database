caption: The left panel depicts sterol activated SCAP (SREBP Cleavage Activating Protein)
  mediated transport of SREBP (Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein) from ER
  (endoplasmic reticulum) to the Golgi Apparatus where two site specific proteases
  S1P (site-1-protease) and S2P (site-2-protease) stimulate the release of N-terminal
  bHLH domain from the membrane. The bHLH domain upon being directed to the nucleus
  bind to the sterol response element (SRE) upstream of the target genes thereby stimulating
  transcription of genes involved in sterol biosynthesis. Abundance of sterol moieties
  inhibits this process. The right panel shows the role of isoforms SREBP-2 and SREBP-1c
  in regulating the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway and cholesterologenesis respectively
  when expressed at normal cellular levels. Expression at levels higher than normal
  allows both the isoforms to govern activation of all the enzymes involved in both
  fatty acid biosynthesis as well as in synthesis of cholesterol. Glycerol-3-Phosphate
  Acyltransferase (GPAT); 7-Dehydrocholesterol Reductase (DHCR).
