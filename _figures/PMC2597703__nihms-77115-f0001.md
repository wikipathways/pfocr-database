caption: 'In general, cytokine binding to a cognate receptor results in activation
  of the JAK/STAT pathway and induction of Socs gene transcription in a STAT-dependent
  manner. The SOCS proteins then inhibit signalling either by direct inhibition of
  JAK kinase activity (SOCS1: S1), SH2-recruitment to the receptor cytoplasmic domain,
  followed by inhibition of JAK activity (SOCS3: S3), or by competition with STAT-SH2
  domains for specific receptor phosphotyrosine residues (CIS, SOCS2). An additional
  level of regulation is provided by an E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex bound to the SOCS
  box motif, which ubiquitinates the associated proteins targeting them for proteasomal
  degradation (inset).'
