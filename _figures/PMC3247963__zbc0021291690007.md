caption: A model illustrating that early and late ISGs induction is regulated by multiple
  STAT1 posttranslational modifications. 1, the canonical JAK-STAT signaling is activated
  following type I IFN binding to its receptor, which results in STAT1 Tyr-701 phosphorylation,
  ISGF3 formation, and its nuclear translocation. ISGF3 binding to the ISRE element
  induces transcription of ISGs. 2, chromatin-bound STAT1 can be phosphorylated by
  MAPK at residue Ser-727, which induces its sumoylation. 3 and 4, nuclear STAT1 is
  also acetylated by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) CREB-binding protein (CBP), resulting
  in recruitment of TCP1, which catalyzes STAT1 tyrosine dephosphorylation. Sumoylated-acetylated
  STAT1 cycles back to the cytoplasm, and both modifications render STAT1 unable to
  be further tyrosine-phosphorylated. 5 and 6, type I IFN signaling and unknown IFN-stimulated
  factor(s) activate IKKϵ phosphorylation of STAT1 Ser-708. 7, STAT1 molecules phosphorylated
  at Ser-708 can enter the nucleus and induce expression of a specific ISG subset.
  pY, tyrosine phosphorylation; pS, serine phosphorylation; Ac, acetylation; Su, sumoylation.
