caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of FST and AHSG. (A) IPA investigated the
  molecular pathways of FST involved in NAFLD and NASH. All identified pathways of
  FST were screened individually. Representative canonical pathways of FST are associated
  with other related genes and molecules of NAFLD and NASH. Functional relationships
  of these genes, molecules and FST are depicted using straight lines with arrows.
  FST is functionally related to 1. FXR/RXR signaling; 2. Hepatic fibrosis signaling;
  3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus signaling; 4. PPARα/RXRα signaling; 5. AMPK signaling
  and 6. NFκB signaling (Right). (B) IPA investigated the molecular pathways of AHSG
  involved in NAFLD and NASH. All identified pathways of AHSG were screened individually
  (left). Representative canonical pathways of AHSG are associated with other related
  genes and molecules of NAFLD and NASH. Functional relationships of these genes and
  AHSG are depicted using straight lines with arrows. AHSG is functionally related
  to 1. FXR/RXR signaling; 2. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus signaling; 3. Hepatic stellate
  cell activation signaling; 4. NF-κB signaling; 5. LXR/RXR signaling; 6. PPARα/RXRα
  signaling and 7. PXR/RXR signaling (Right). Solid lines show direct regulation while
  dotted lines depict indirect interactions. PPARGC1A, Peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha.
