caption: Proposed model for the integration of primary afferent, mast cell and sympathetic
  systems in supporting CRPS-related nociception. Previous reports describe the participation
  of primary afferent signaling and mast cell activation in supporting mediator production
  and, ultimately, nociceptor activation in this model. The results of our present
  experiments define a third β2AR/IL-6-mediated sympathetic signaling pathway. Thus
  pain and sensitization in CRPS may be the result of several converging pathways.
  The balance of contributions from these pathways may explain clinical differences
  between patients both in terms of the manifestations of the syndrome as well as
  differences in sensitivities to treatment approaches.
