caption: Regulation of intestinal homeostasis by microenvironment. (A) The intestinal
  microenvironment comprises stromal cells and gut microbiota. Stromal cells include
  mesenchymal and immune cells. The mesenchymal cells encompassing fibroblasts, myofibroblasts,
  pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. Paneth cells and crypt
  myofibroblasts secrete wingless‐related integration site (WNT) and epidermal growth
  factor (EGF) ligands, which are essential for the growth and maintenance of intestinal
  stem cells (ISCs). Villus fibroblasts contribute to epithelial differentiation by
  secreting bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligands and the EGF family ligand neuregulin
  1 (NRG1). Upon intestinal injury, fibroblasts upregulate the secretion of R‐spondin3
  to promote tissue repair. MAP3K2‐regulated intestinal stromal cells (MRISC) are
  located at the base of colonic crypts. These cells enhance WNT signaling through
  the upregulation of R‐spondin1. Ptgs2 + fibroblasts secrete prostaglandin E2, which
  activates the Yes‐associated protein (YAP) pathway and stimulates epithelial regeneration.
  After radiation‐induced damage, macrophages accumulate at the injury site, releasing
  transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) to facilitate tissue repair. Innate lymphocyte
  types 3 (ILC3s) activate postinjury and secrete interleukin‐22 (IL‐22) to further
  support the regenerative process. Smooth muscle cells contribute to intestinal repair
  by secreting BMP antagonists and matrix metallopeptidase 17 (MMP17), which together
  enhance YAP signaling. (B) Lactobacillus reuteri produces lactic acid, which activates
  G‐protein‐coupled receptor 81 (GPR81) receptors on stromal cells, leading to the
  upregulation of Wnt2 and Wnt3a expression. This activation enhances the WNT/β‐catenin
  signaling pathway, thereby promoting ISC self‐renewal and organoid proliferation.
  Furthermore, Lactobacillus reuteri stimulates lamina propria lymphocytes to secrete
  IL‐22, which activates the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  pathway and accelerates proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells. Additionally,
  Lactobacillus reuteri promotes oxytocin secretion through proinsulin signaling mechanisms.
  Bacteroides fragilis produces 3‐phenylpropionic acid derivatives, which contribute
  to the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity by activating the aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AhR) signaling pathway. Clostridium bifermentans enhances lipid absorption
  by upregulating diacylglycerol O‐acyltransferase 2 (Dgat2) expression, thereby increasing
  oleic acid uptake and regulating lipid metabolism
