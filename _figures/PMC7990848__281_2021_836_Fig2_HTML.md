caption: a Beyond TNF and IL-17A other cytokines are indirectly involved in the axis.
  For example, IL-1, IL-6 and TGF-beta can prime IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 production
  and genetic polymorphisms in IL-1 an IL-6 are linked to AS. Independently of the
  impact on IL-17 pathway biology these cytokines can also directly impact on stromal
  and MSC biology. b The balance between immune activation in response to mechanical
  stress. Overactivation of the immune system in response to mechanical damage can
  lead to excessive repair as seen in SpA (red). Conversely blocking the immune system
  when excessive mechanical stress induced injury can be detrimental to the repair
  process or may render repair ineffective
