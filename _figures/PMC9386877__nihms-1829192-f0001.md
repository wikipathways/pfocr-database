caption: 'Signal transduction and neurotransmission of tastes. a Taste coding in taste
  buds. Each taste quality is generally sensed by dedicated taste cells: sweet, bitter,
  umami, sour, and sodium cells. Whereas sour taste cells are designated as type III
  cells, sweet, bitter, and umami taste cells are considered together as type II cells
  because they share a common signaling cascade. Note that high-salt taste relies
  on bitter and sour cells. b Sour transduction in type III cells involves OTOP1 and
  Kir2.1 as the H+ sensor and signal amplifier channels, respectively, and employs
  conventional vesicular synapses for neurotransmission. c Among type II cells, sweet,
  umami, and bitter cells differ in the types of taste receptors but share a similar
  signaling pathway, where the activation of TRPM5 channels generates a depolarization
  to trigger action potential firing. Sodium taste transduction is initiated by Na+
  influx through ENaC, which induces a supra-threshold depolarization for action potential
  generation. Both type II cells and sodium taste cells employ the channel synapse
  involving CALHM1/3 channels as the conduit for action potential-dependent neurotransmitter
  release. OTOP1, Otopetrin1; Kir2.1, inward rectifier K+ channel; ΔpH, intracellular
