caption: 'Role of α-ketoglutarate and its receptor, OXGR1, in the regulation of renal
  Na+ transport. α-ketoglutarate (αKG) is freely filtered by the glomerulus. During
  alkalosis, Na+ reabsorption in the proximal segment is reduced and the reabsorption
  of αKG is blunted, increasing its concentration in the lumen. This high level of
  αKG delivered to the distal tubule may activate its receptor in the B-intercalated
  cells. The signalling pathway triggered by this activation is still unknown but
  activates the Pds/NDBCE system, leading to an increased Na+ reabsorption. In case
  of acidosis, the filtered pool of αKG is reabsorbed by the proximal tubule, decreasing
  its luminal concentration and blunting the activation of OXGR1 in the CD. In this
  case, the reabsorption of Na+ in the distal nephron is not stimulated. CD: Collecting
  duct; NDBCE: Na+-driven bicarbonate/Cl- exchanger; OXGR1: 2-oxoglutarate receptor
  1; αKG: α-ketoglutarate.'
