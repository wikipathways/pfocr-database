caption: 'Schematic overview of proteotoxic ER stress signaling by the UPR. Three
  branches of the UPR sense proteotoxic stress in the ER to control adaptive transcriptional
  and non-transcriptional responses: ATF6, IRE1 (IRE1α in mammals/ ScIRE1 in S. cerevisiae)
  and PERK. (Left panel): Intermolecular disulfide bonds stabilize inactive homo-oligomers
  of ATF6 thereby limiting the pool of ATF6 that can be activated. In the absence
  of ER stress, ATF6 interacts with its negative regulator BiP. Notably, various regions
  of the ER-luminal domain of ATF6 contribute to BiP binding, but only a membrane-proximal
  binding region is indicated here for simplicity. Current models suggest a dissociation
  of BiP from ATF6 upon ER stress. The unmasking of Golgi localization signals allows
  for packaging of ATF6 into COPII vesicles for a transport to the Golgi apparatus.
  Processing by the site-1-protease and site-2-protease releases a transcriptionally
  active fragment (ATF6p50) for regulating UPR target genes in the nucleus. (Middle
  panel): Inactive monomers of IRE1α/ScIre1 associate with BiP/Kar2p via various interaction
  sites. Proteotoxic ER stress causes a dimerization of IRE1α/ScIre1, the release
  of BiP/Kar2p, and the formation of higher oligomeric assemblies of IRE1α/ScIre1.
  The enforced proximity of the cytosolic effector domains enables a trans-autophosphorylation
  of the cytosolic kinase domain and activation of the RNase domain. Oligomers of
  IRE1α and ScIre1 cleave the mRNA of unspliced XBP1 and uninduced HAC1, respectively,
  as the committed step for unconventional splicing. Translation of the spliced mRNA
  yields an active transcription factor XBP1/HAC1 upregulating hundreds of UPR target
  genes in the nucleus. Oligomers of the mammalian IRE1α oligomers can reduce the
  load of the ER with unfolded proteins via the regulated IRE1α-dependent mRNA Decay
  (RIDD). (Right panel): Proteotoxic ER stress causes a dissociation of BiP from PERK
  and facilitates the formation of PERK dimers and oligomers. Trans-autophosphorylation
  activates PERK’s cytosolic kinase domain, which then phosphorylates the eukaryotic
  initiation 2α (eIF2α). This causes a global attenuation of translation, but also
  selectively promotes the production of the transcription factor ATF4. ATF4 controls
  both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signals.'
