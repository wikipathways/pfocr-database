caption: The family of surface-receptor tyrosine kinases encoded by EGFR consists
  of four members that form homodimers or heterodimers after ligand binding. Dimerization
  results in the activation of tyrosine kinases, which is followed by stimulation
  of three major signaling pathways, eventually leading to the activation of five
  of the six hallmarks of cancer (with the exception of limitless replication). The
  classic mutations of the EGFR kinase domain result in ligand-independent activation
  of the pathway. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib and gefitinib, interfere
  with the kinase activity of the gene and prevent downstream signaling. Activation
  of EGFR signaling also leads to an autocrine loop resulting from the formation and
  release of ligands. The ligands require release from their membrane-bound precursor
  forms by the activity of sheddase proteins. Only nodal points in the pathway are
  displayed, indicating targets of therapies in current clinical use or in trials
  (red arrows). Akt denotes protein kinase B, PI3K phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,
  PTEN phosphatase and tensin homologue, MAPK mitogen- activated protein kinase, mTOR
  mammalian target of rapamycin, P phosphorylation, STAT signal transducer and activator
  of transcription, and TGF-α transforming growth factor α.
