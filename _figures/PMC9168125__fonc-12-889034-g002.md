caption: Possible mechanism of galectin-3 in lymphoma. Insulin-like growth factor
  I receptor (IGFIR) triggers the involvement of at least two signaling pathways,
  namely the MAPK/ERK and JNK pathways, leads to paraptosis. Both pharmacological
  inhibition of MAPK and downregulation of MEK-2 by RNAi, as well as downregulation
  of JNK1 by antisense oligo transfection, inhibites paraptosis. Among them, caspase-9
  is a direct target of MAPK, and the phosphorylation of ERK-2 to Thr125 inhibits
  the pro-apoptotic activity of caspase-9. Galectin-3 inhibits IGFIR in combination
  with Alix/AIP1, thereby modulating paraptosis. The combination of galectin-3 and
  CD95 stimulates the activation of caspase-8 and interferes with the apoptotic signaling
  pathway from caspase-8 to mitochondria, and it can also combine with Bcl-2 to stimulate
  Bax and interfere with the apoptosis signaling pathway of mitochondrial Apaf-1.
  Galectin-3 can also inhibit apoptosis through PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway.
  The combination of galectin-3 with NK cells may have the effect of suppressing immune
  attack, and the combination with fibronectin and laminin can promote tumorigenesis
  in lymphoma.
