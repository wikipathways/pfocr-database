caption: Zinc finger proteins (ZNF) associated with protective effects against ischemic
  insults. KLF2 and KLF11 maintain the function of blood brain barrier (BBB) by regulating
  the occludin in the vascular endothelial cells. KLF11 and MCPIP-1 reduce the level
  of inflammatory factors by negatively regulating NF-κB pathway, thus protecting
  BBB. MZFI promotes TJs synthesis by increasing the mRNA and protein expression levels
  of its potential binding site CLDND1, and regulates vascular permeability.
