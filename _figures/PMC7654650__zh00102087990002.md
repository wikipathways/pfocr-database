caption: Illustration of basal stem cells and their putative differentiated progeny
  in the human lung. 1) Basal cells (BC) self-renew and are capable of giving rise
  to all cell types present on the surface airway epithelium through an intermediate
  BC precursor. 2) A subset of these BCs that display intracellular Notch commit to
  a secretory cell lineage while low-level c-myb expression in the same population
  will differentiate to preciliated and multiciliated cells (MCCs) subsequently. Other
  identified pathways that induce this lineage relationship include signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/IL-6 or inhibitory miR-449. 3) club-like
  cells (CCs) share a common pathway with BCs when differentiating into MCCs but can
  also renew the MCCs through a goblet cell (GC) intermediate. Alveolar type II and
  bronchiolar cells are additional contributions from CCs. 4) If BCs are ablated,
  club-like cells (CCs) have been demonstrated to dedifferentiate to renew BCs. 5)
  BCs can also give rise to self-renewing neuroendocrine cells as well as brush cells
  and ionocytes. KRT, cytokeratin; ASCL1, achaete-scute homolog 1; CGRP, calcitonin
