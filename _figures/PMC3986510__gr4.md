caption: Diagram demonstrating sites of interference by various small molecule agents
  or genetic ablation of enzymes engaged in ceramide and sphingolipid synthesis pathway.
  The shown pharmacological/genetic interferences lead to improved insulin action
  in several preclinical animal models of diabetes. Myriocin and partial ablation
  of SPT1 leads to marked decrease of ceramide content in metabolically active tissues
  with resulting improvement of whole body insulin sensitivity. The glycosphingolipid
  synthesis inhibitors, ANP-DMN and Genz-123346 markedly decrease formation of several
  complex sphingolipids and improve whole body glucose tolerance. Similar effects
  are seen in GM3 synthase KO mice.
