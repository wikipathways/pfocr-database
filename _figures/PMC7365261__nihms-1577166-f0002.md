caption: '(a) Schematic DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathways: NHEJ and HR.
  (b) PARP recruits base excision repair (BER) enzymes to SSB loci. PARP inhibitors
  reduce SSB BER. Cells with reduced SSB repair result in DSB. (c) JQ1-mediated inhibition
  of BET protein (BRD2/3/4) activity inhibits expression of DSB repair proteins Ku80
  and RAD51. Decreased DSB DNA repair sensitizes cells to PARP inhibitors. Multiple
  ongoing preclinical studies focus on the hypothesis that simultaneous inhibition
  of the expression or activity of enzymes that contribute to NHEJ, HR, and BER have
  complementary anti-tumor efficacy. Black font = normal pathway. Red font = effect
  of JQ1. Blue font = effect of PARPi. (Abbreviations: NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining;
  HR, homologous recombination; DSB, double-strand break; SSB, single-strand break;
  ac, acetylation).'
