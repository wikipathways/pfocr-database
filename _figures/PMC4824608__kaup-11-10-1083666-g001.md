caption: The various possible mechanisms of Ca2+-ITPR-mediated control of autophagy.
  Constitutive ITPR-mediated Ca2+ release into mitochondria inhibits a proximal step
  in the autophagy pathway by fueling mitochondrial energetics and ATP production
  and limiting AMPK activity. The ER Ca2+-leak channel TMBIM6 can impede ATP production
  by lowering the steady-state ER Ca2+ concentration and thus reduce the amount of
  Ca2+ available for transfer into the mitochondria. ITPRs can also function as scaffolding
  molecules, thereby suppressing autophagy independently of their Ca2+-release activity
  by promoting the interaction of BCL2 with BECN1 and thus preventing the formation
  of the active class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex. ITPR-mediated
  Ca2+ release can also be enhanced by BECN1 and TMBIM6 and dampened by TGM2, thereby
  influencing omegasome formation (possibly through PtdIns3K activation) and autophagosome
  maturation/trafficking. ITPR-mediated Ca2+ release can also influence the lysosomal
  Ca2+ concentration and lysosomal Ca2+ release through TPCNs, likely influencing
  lysosomal fusion events, or through MCOLN1, influencing autophagic and lysosomal
  gene transcription through a pathway involving PPP3/calcineurin and TFEB. TPCNs
  reciprocally also influence ITPRs via a Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release mechanism. Autophagosome
  synthesis, maturation and fusion are also affected by Ca2+-mobilizing agents such
  as thapsigargin (that inhibits the ER Ca2+ pump ATP2A) and Ca2+ ionophores that
  increase the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt). IP3 production and the subsequent
  IP3-mediated Ca2+ release can also be regulated by a feedback loop involving calpain
  activation by L-type Ca2+ channel-mediated Ca2+ entry or the activation of P2RY
  (purinergic receptor, G-protein coupled). The black circles represent Ca2+ ions,
  with thick black arrows indicating the direction of the Ca2+ fluxes. Green arrows
  indicate stimulatory effects, red lines inhibitory ones.
