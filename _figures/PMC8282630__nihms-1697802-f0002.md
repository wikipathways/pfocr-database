caption: 'a) Specifically, dopamine binding at D1 versus D2 receptors respectively
  increases and decreases striatal neuron excitability to cortical drive. Phasic reward
  prediction error signaling thus shapes synapses at D1- versus D2-receptor expressing
  neurons to reflect the benefits versus the costs of actions, respectively. In turn,
  high dopamine release can also instantaneously amplify benefit versus cost information
  encoded in cortico-striatal synaptic weights at the time of choice. Adapted from
  []. b) Midbrain dopamine projections shape the learning and performance of cognitive
  and motor actions in a conserved, hierarchically-structured, cortico-striatal architecture
  for action selection [,,]. Dopamine projections to the prefrontal cortex modulate
  the stability of recurrent working memory representations. Abstract, higher-level
  goal representations in more rostral cortex bias increasingly concrete, lower-level
  representations, including specific cognitive and motor actions, in more caudal
  cortex. At the highest level of abstraction, this could include selection of effortful
  cognitive tasks themselves. Working memory contents are also determined by gating
  policies in the striatum, where dopamine both trains policies and alters their expression,
  by modulating sensitivity to afferent cortical projections. A reciprocal, cortico-striatal
  circuit is replicated across the dorsal frontal cortex and dorsal striatum, thus
  constituting a spiraling, dopamine-modulated pathway for hierarchical action selection.
  Abbreviations: DS – dorsal striatum, VS – ventral striatum, VTA – ventral tegmental
  area, SNc – substantia nigra pars compacta, 1PFC – lateral prefrontal cortex, ACC
  – anterior cingulate cortex, DA – dopamine.'
