caption: ErbB4 agonists and antagonists stimulate the formation of EGFR–ErbB4 heterodimers
  that possess distinct conformations. Thus ErbB4 agonists and antagonists stimulate
  ErbB4 tyrosine phosphorylation on distinct sets of tyrosine residues. (A) This could
  result in differences in ErbB4 coupling to the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. (B)
  This could result in differences in ErbB4 coupling to the transcriptional co-regulator
  YAP. (C) This could result in differences in ErbB4 degradation and turnover.
