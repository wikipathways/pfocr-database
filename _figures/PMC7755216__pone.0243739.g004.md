caption: A) The colored circles represent the aromatic compound degradation routes
  available in the complete second stage of lignin degradation (assimilatory metabolism).
  The peripheral and central pathways of lignin degradation via β-ketoadipate pathways
  (via catechol and protocatechuate branches) are highlighted by pink (top) and orange
  (bottom) lines, respectively. The pentagons represent the central metabolite precursors
  for deconstruction of ring structures and carbon utilization by cells via acetyl-CoA,
  pyruvate, and succinate formation. Red triangles represent peripheral intermediates,
  and gray pentagons represent the central intermediate of lignin degradation. The
  activities represented in each box are identified according to the color code presented
  on the right side and based on their respective EC numbers and the name of the genes
  potentially associated with each metabolic pathway. B) Circular genomic representation
  and position of the genes present in the lignin fragment degradation model of K.variicola
  P1CD1.
