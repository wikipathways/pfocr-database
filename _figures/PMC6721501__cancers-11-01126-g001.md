caption: Figure depicts canonical hedgehog signaling pathway. In absence of hedgehog
  ligands, sonic hedgehog (SHH), Indian hedgehog (IHH) and desert hedgehog (DHH) bind
  to Patched (PTCH) protein, which inhibits Smoothened (SMO) and its downstream signaling
  events. Binding of Hh ligands to PTCH inhibits the PTCH, leading to the dis-inhibition
  of SMO, which then inhibits suppressor of fused (SUFU), thereby leading to release
  and nuclear translocation of glioma-associated oncogene (GLI)1/2 proteins and transcriptional
  upregulation of various GLI target genes. GLI3 is a transcriptional repressor, that
  when associated with SUFU in a trimolecular complex with GSK3b, undergoes further
  processing to generate repressor GLI. Activation of SMO leads to dissociation of
  SUFU/GLI3/GSK3b complex. Inhibitors of the pathway, including vismodegib, cyclopamine,
  itraconazole, GANT58 and GANT61 and the sites of inhibition are indicated.
