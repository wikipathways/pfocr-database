caption: WTA is sequentially synthesized by a series of Tar enzymes on a bactoprenyl
  phosphate carrier on the inner leaflet of the cell membrane and eventually transported
  to the outer leaflet where it is cross-linked to peptidoglycan. See inset for details.
  Non-essential early steps in WTA biosynthesis are shown as green arrows, late stage
  conditionally essential steps are shown as purple arrows. Note, MnaA is highlighted
  by a dashed bidirectional green arrow, highlighting its novel functional role as
  an epimerase that interconverts UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-ManNAc, thus providing substrates
  for TarO and TarA, respectively. L638 is a Staphylococcal-specific TarG inhibitor
  []. Schematic has been adapted from [].
