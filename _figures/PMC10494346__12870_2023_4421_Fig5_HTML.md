caption: Comparative analysis of the co-expression networks of SL signaling pathway
  target proteins SMXL6/7–1/7–2 in G. hirsutum and G. arboreum. Proteins encoded by
  homologous gene pairs in the two species are connected by red dashed lines. Yellow
  indicates key proteins. The key proteins in G. hirsutum are Gh_A10G2131 (GhSMXL6),
  Gh_A05G0731 (GhSMXL7-1), and Gh_A05G2628 (GhSMXL7-2), while the key proteins in
  G. arboreum are Cotton_A_15848 (GaSMXL6), Cotton_A_12945 (GaSMXL7-1), and Cotton_A_31484
  (GaSMXL7-2), which are noted in red font. Green indicates target proteins, which
  interact with SMXL6/7–1/7–2. Solid pink lines connect up-regulated proteins, and
  solid blue lines connect down-regulated proteins
