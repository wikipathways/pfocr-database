caption: Schematic Representation of the Roles Played by ADS2 in  and  Biosynthesis
  in Arabidopsis Leaves.The glycerol backbones with the typical carbon length of FAs
  in the sn-1 and sn-2 positions are indicated to illustrate the main molecular species
  derived from each pathway. The head groups are always at the glycerol sn-3 position.
  The MGD1-DGD1 pathway represents the plastid pathway and contributes to the bulk
  of galactolipid synthesis at the inner envelope membranes of chloroplasts. These
  galactolipids are assumed to transport and integrate into the thylakoid. The alternative
  MGD2/3-DGD2 pathway (extraplastidic pathway) synthesizes galactolipid at the outer
  envelope membranes using precursor derived from the  pathway, and these galactolipids
  are assumed to be transported out and integrated into extraplastidic membrane through
  unresolved mechanisms. -derived  was assumed to integrate into multiple subcellular
  membranes. Reactions that are blocked in ads2 mutants are indicated. The arrow illustrates
  how the ads2 mutation affects carbon flux into different pathways of lipid biosynthesis.
  The upward-pointing arrow represents higher lipid content, and the downward-pointing
  arrow represents lower lipid content in ads2 mutant plants compared with the wild
  type. Dashed arrows represent reactions that have not been experimentally confirmed
  yet. DAG, diacylglycerol; CDP, cytidine-5′-diphosphate.
