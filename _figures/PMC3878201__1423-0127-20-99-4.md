caption: 'miR-34a mediates paclitaxel resistance via both direct and indirect mechanisms.
  (a) Schematic representation of direct and indirect mechanisms underlying miR-34a-mediated
  paclitaxel resistance. Direct pathway: miR-34a inhibit proliferation of paclitaxel-resistant
  PC3PR cells by directly suppressing the cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and CDK6.
  Indirect pathway: miR-34a can enhance apoptosis by indirectly reducing expression
  of the anti-apoptotic gens (SIRT1 & BCL2) via modulating HuR []. (b) Indirect mechanism
  of miR-200c/-205-mediated EMT and resistance to apoptosis. Key signals that lead
  to EMT trigger expression of a variety of transcriptional repressors, including
  ZEB1, ZEB2/SIP1, Snail, and Twist. These repressors are the intracellular mediators
  of EMT by binding to E-box elements of genes, such as CDH1, that encode for the
  adhesion protein E-cadherin. After binding, they recruit histone deacetylases and
  other corepressors to facilitate transcriptional repression of E-cadherin. Reduced
  cellular E-cadherin expression subsequently will lead to loss of cell-cell adhesion
  and a series of other events, eventually leading to an invasive mesenchymal and
  drug resistance phenotype [].'
