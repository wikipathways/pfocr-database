caption: A proposed model of our study is shown. Normalization of the inappropriate
  relation between epithelium and mesenchyme is achieved by Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1)
  secretion from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) stimulated by TGF-β1 in the microenvironment
  of pulmonary fibrosis. ER stress and oxidative stress generated by various types
  of stress led to excessive TGF-β1 synthesis in AECs. TGF-β1 promoted the secretion
  of large amounts of STC1 by MSCs via PI3/AKT/mTOR pathway. STC1 derived from MSCs
  reduced oxidative stress, ER stress and TGF-β1 synthesis in AECs under the function
  of UCP2, which shifts mitochondrial respiration into aerobic glycolysis. This is
  one of the negative feedback pathways for the protection against fibrosis in cooperation
  with AECs and MSCs.
