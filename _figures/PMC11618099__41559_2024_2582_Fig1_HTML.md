caption: a, Schematic showing that genotype and environment both influence phenotype.
  Phenotype and environment determine an organism’s relative fitness. The grey dotted
  line connecting fitness to genotype reflects reproduction and potential evolutionary
  changes in allele frequencies from one generation to the next. b, Allelic variation
  for a gene’s promoter (arrowheads indicate transcription start site) is shown under
  genotype, leading to variation in the gene’s expression (curvy lines represent differences
  in RNA abundance in budding yeast cells), shown under phenotype, and variation in
  the abundance of different yeast genotypes due to differences in expression, shown
  under fitness. Hypothetical differences in RNA abundance and relative fitness between
  two environments (A and B) are also shown. c,d, A case where the alternate allele
  has no expression plasticity but environment-specific fitness effects (c) and a
  case where expression plasticity of the alternate allele results in the same fitness
  in both environments (d). Considering the wild-type and alternate alleles together,
  c shows a genotype-by-environment interaction for fitness but not expression (Extended
  Data Fig. 1a,b), and d shows a genotype-by-environment interaction for expression
  but not fitness (Extended Data Fig. 1c,e). Solid lines show the relationship between
  expression of a focal gene and fitness in two environments (green, environment A;
  purple, environment B). Black dot indicates expression and fitness of a ‘wild-type’
  promoter allele, with both values defined as 1. Green and purple dots indicate expression
  and fitness of the same alternative promoter allele in environment A (green) and
  environment B (purple), with expression and fitness defined relative to the wild-type
  allele. The green and purple dotted arrows highlight the effects of genetic differences
  between the wild-type and alternative promoter alleles on gene expression and fitness
  in each environment. e, Abbreviated metabolic pathway illustrating how the carbon
  sources used in this study (glucose, galactose, glycerol and ethanol) relate to
  the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway. TDH3p catalyses the interconversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (GAP) to 1,3-biphosphoglycerate (1,3BPG), as shown by the double-headed black arrow.
  Grey arrows highlight other metabolic steps; multiple grey arrows indicate reactions
  catalysed by two or more enzymes. Fit., fitness; Exp., expression; G6P, glucose
