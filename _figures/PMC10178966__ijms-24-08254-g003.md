caption: The potential biotargets associated with the CI−AKI. CM-induced apoptosis
  can be regulated by miRNAs (miRNA 21, miRNA 30-e-5p), and BH3, which can be through
  Bcl2 family (Bak and Bax), to regulate the caspase 3-mediated apoptosis in CI−AKI,
  suggesting that they may be potential targets. CM-induced inflammation can be regulated
  by Nod-like receptor pyrin containing 3 (Nlrp3) inflammasome activated caspase−1
  then divide the IL−1β and IL−18 to activate inflammatory response. Brush border
  enzyme dipeptidase-1 (DPEP−1) is closely related to tubular reabsorption of contrast
  and plays an important role in CI−AKI. TLR4 has a high level of expression in contrast-induced
  injuries, and the activation of TLR4 can induce the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF−κB
  signaling pathway. CM-induced ROS can be regulated by Tet2 and NADPH oxidases (NOXs),
  vascular NOXs to regulate ROS generation during cellular oxidation, and by epigenetic
  mechanisms. For example, Tet2 signaling can specifically recruit the histone deacetylases
  2 (Hdac2) to inhibit IL−6 transcription during cellular oxidation. In addition,
  nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) can regulate Sirt3/SOD2 in contrast-induced
  oxidative stress. HDAC9 promote the expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein
  (TXNIP), thus increasing susceptibility to CI−AKI
