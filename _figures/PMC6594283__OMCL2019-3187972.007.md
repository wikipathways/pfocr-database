caption: Possible signaling transduction pathways induced by SIRT7 in LPS-treated
  DCMECs. SIRT7 may attenuate LPS-induced upregulation of TLR4, TAB1, and p-TAK1,
  deactivate the NF-κB pathway, and downregulate inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6,
  and TNF-α), ROS, and NO. Subsequently, SIRT7 suppresses apoptosis-related gene expression.
  As a result, SIRT7 may inhibit the proinflammatory response and initiation of apoptosis
  in LPS-treated DCMECs.
