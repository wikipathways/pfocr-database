caption: At homeostasis (centre panel), multiple regulatory mechanisms — compartmentalization,
  ligand availability, receptor expression and signal transduction — function collectively
  to limit the responses of nucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors (NA-sensing TLRs)
  to self-nucleic acids, while preserving responses to microbial nucleic acids. All
  NA-sensing TLRs require the transmembrane protein UNC93B1 to exit the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), where they are translated, and traffic via the classical secretory
  pathway to endosomes. To reach an endosome, TLR9 must first traffic to the plasma
  membrane, where it is internalized by adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2)-mediated
  endocytosis. UNC93B1 also mediates regulatory functions after exit from the ER.
  For example, TLR3 and TLR9 are released from UNC93B1 in the endosome, whereas TLR7
  remains associated. This subjects TLR7 to additional regulation through binding
  of syntenin-1 to UNC93B1, which leads to sorting of the UNC93B1–TLR7 complex to
  multivesicular bodies and termination of signalling. The fate of UNC93B1–TLR13 complexes
  in endosomes is currently not known. The distinct stoichiometry of dimeric UNC93B1–TLR7
  complexes, compared with monomeric UNC93B1–TLR3 complexes, is also depicted. Breakdown
  of these regulatory mechanisms has been linked to the induction of autoimmunity
  and/or autoinflammation. For each category of regulatory mechanism, representative
  examples of how that regulation can break down are indicated. Detailed discussions
  of additional examples are provided in the main text. a | Compartmentalization.
  Mislocalization or defective compartmentalization of mutant TLR9 enables recognition
  of extracellular self-DNA. b | Ligand availability. Association of self-DNA and
  self-RNA with the antimicrobial peptide LL37 promotes their uptake into endosomes
  and reduces degradation by nucleases. Loss of the membrane-anchored 5′ exonucleases
  phospholipase D3 (PLD3) and PLD4 or of the nucleoside exporter SLC29A3 increases
  the availability of self-nucleic acids within endosomes and triggers activation
  of TLR9 or TLR7, respectively. c | Receptor expression. Overexpression of TLR7 increases
  the number of receptors in endosomes, which enables responses to otherwise non-stimulatory
  levels of self-RNA. d | Signal transduction. Loss of syntenin-1 binding to mutant
  UNC93B1 disrupts the sorting of UNC93B1–TLR7 complexes into multivesicular bodies,
  which is required to restrict TLR7 responses to self-RNA. Positive regulators of
  NA-sensing TLRs, such as TASL and TREML4, can enhance downstream signalling. ssDNA,
  single-stranded DNA; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA.
