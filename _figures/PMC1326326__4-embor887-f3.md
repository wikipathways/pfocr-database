caption: Proposed regulation of Cdc25A at the G1 and intra-S-phase checkpoints. (A)
  Cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) or ultraviolet light (UV) respond by activating
  kinases of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein family. ATM and ATM-related
  (ATR) phosphorylate and activate the checkpoint kinases Chk2 and Chk1, respectively.
  Activated checkpoint kinases phosphorylate Cdc25A on Ser 123, accelerating its degradation
  through the ubiquitin (Ub)–proteasome pathway. Inactivation of Cdc25A results in
  the sustained phosphorylation and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2),
  thus leading to G1 arrest. (B) A unified view of how Cdc25A degradation brings about
  G1 arrest and an S-phase delay (blue bars) by inhibiting both early- and late-firing
  origins of replication (grey arrows). Cdc25A, cell-division cycle 25A; Cyc, cyclin.
