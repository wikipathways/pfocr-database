caption: 'Viral proteins and small molecule compounds may inhibit signaling in synergy
  to promote viral replication, and improve elicited inflammation, ICD and antitumor
  immune responses. We use RAS, IFN and dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) pathways
  as an example. Most viruses replicate poorly in cells that produce active PKR. In
  response to viral infection, PKR activates the transcription factor NF-κB by inducing
  degradation of IκBβ. NF-κB activates transcription of proinflammatory genes that
  induce an immune response against viruses. RAS activation by EGFR, v-Erb2, or platelet-derived
  growth-factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling inhibits PKR activity. RAS activation therefore
  allows viral oncolytic activity in cancer cells. PKR activity is also activated
  by interferon (IFN)-α/β signaling through the IFN receptor (IFNR). Tumor cells with
  defects in this signaling pathway allow a higher degree of viral replication than
  normal cells. Several viral proteins and RNAs (adenoviral VA RNA128, VV’s E3L and
  K3L, the hepatitis CE2 protein and influenza virus NS1 protein) inhibit PKR. Interfering
  with the different steps of signaling pathways using different classes of compounds
  have resulted in increased viral replication and subsequent efficacy. PKR shuts
  off protein synthesis by phosphorylating eIF2α. The protein phosphatase-1α is activated
  by the protein ICP34.5, which is expressed by HSV-1. ICP34.5 dephosphorylates eIF2α
  to allow protein synthesis to continue. An HSV1 strain that expresses a mutant form
  of ICP34.5 can therefore only replicate in cells with inactive PKR. Targeting this
  process by means of different small molecule inhibitors increased OV spread and
  efficacy. Note: Viral genes are shown in red, small molecule inhibitors are shown
  in green, whereas cellular proteins are shown in blue'
