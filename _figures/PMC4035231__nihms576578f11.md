caption: 'The schematic shows two possible signaling pathways that can be triggered
  by nerve growth factor (NGF) binding. (1) The first pathway includes the Tyrosine
  Kinase Isoform A (TrkA). TrkA stimulation leads to the activation of Phospholipase
  Cγ (PLCγ) which cleaves Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol
  1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (not shown). IP3 binds and activates
  the IP3-receptor (IP3-R) on the endoplasmic reticulum (an intracellular calcium
  store) allowing Ca+2 release. Released Ca+2 activates Calmodulin (not shown), which
  in turn stimulates Calcineurin (Caln). Caln dephosphorylates the Nuclear Factor
  of Activated T-Cells (NFAT) promoting its translocation into the nucleus where NFAT
  activates gene expression. In addition, TrkA stimulation results in the phosphorylation
  of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2). Phosphorylated Erk1/2
  translocate into the nucleus where they phosphorylate the transcription factors:
  ELK1 and c-Myc. The phosphorylated transcription factors then promote gene expression.
  In our experiments a TrkA receptor inhibitor GW441756 (GW), did not affect the expression
  of TRPC1 and TRPC6 channels, suggesting that the channel’s expression is independent
  of this pathway. (2) The second pathway involves the neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR.
  p75NTR activates the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKK2).
  IKK2 phosphorylates the inhibitor of the nuclear factor kappa-B (IκB). The phosphorylation
  of IκB promotes its dissociation from the NF-κB dimer. The phosphorylated IκB is
  ubiquitinated whereas the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) translocates into the nucleus
  and up-regulates gene expression. We demonstrated that BMS-345541 and IMD-0354,
  two different IKK2 inhibitors, prevented the NGF-induced up-regulation of TRPC1
  and TRPC6 expression. Contrary, the constitutive active mutant of IKK2, IKK2Ca,
  up-regulated the expression of TRPC1 and TRPC6, which supports the hypothesis that
  TRPC1 and TRPC6 expression is regulated via the p75NTR-IKK2pathway but not the TrkA
  pathway. (3) The up-regulation of TRPC1 positively regulates neurite outgrowth,
  whereas TRPC6 up-regulation negatively regulates neurite outgrowth which is in agreement
  with previous reports indicating the role of TRPC6 in synaptogenesis ().'
