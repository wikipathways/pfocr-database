caption: AII amacrine cells participate in multiple signaling pathways. (A) In the
  classical pathway, AIIs receive excitatory ON input from rod bipolar cells (RB)
  and make sign-conserving electrical synapses to ON cone bipolar cells (On CB, green
  arrow) and sign-inverting inhibitory (glycinergic) synapses to OFF cone bipolars
  (Off CB, red arrow). (B) During photopic (daytime) vision, cone-driven ON cone bipolars
  signal through gap junctions to (green arrow) AIIs, which make direct glycinergic
  connections to OFF RGCs (off G, red arrow). See [,–]. (C) AIIs driven by ON cone
  bipolars also inhibit OFF cone bipolars, allowing the ON pathway to rectify the
  OFF pathway [].
