caption: MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in PH. a MAPK signaling pathway and
  targeted therapy in PH. MAPK pathway is activated by cytokines and other stimuli,
  leading to the upregulation of cell cycle proteins and subsequently promoting proliferation.
  The ERK pathway inhibits cell apoptosis, while the p38 pathway promotes cell apoptosis.
  Activated p38 signaling contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and also affects
  inflammation by inducing the secretion of inflammatory factors. ASK1 activates p38
  and JNK, thereby stimulating PAF activation, migration, and proliferation. Paeoniflorin,
  and 3PO alleviate PH by inhibiting ERK and its related pathways, paeoniflorin by
  inhibiting p38 and its related pathways, and GS-444217 alleviate PH by inhibiting
  ASK1/JNK/p38 axis. PASMC pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell, PAEC pulmonary artery
  endothelial cell, PAF pulmonary artery fibroblast, Δψm mitochondrial membrane potential,

  sphingosine kinase 1, Caspase cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase, miR microRNA,
  3PO 3-(4-(trifluoromethyl phenyl)-1H-pyrazole. b PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and
  targeted therapy in PH. CTRP9 downregulation reduces PI3K/Akt in PAECs, causing
  apoptosis, inflammation (ET-1, MMP-2), and dysfunction. In late PH, miR-371b-5p/PTEN
  downregulation activates PI3K/Akt, promoting proliferation and oxidative stress
  (eNOS/NO) in PAECs. BMP4-induced activation of BMPR2/PI3K/Akt in PASMCs activates
  PI3K/Akt in PASMCs. PI3K/Akt activation in PH drives inflammation (NF-κB) and proliferation
  (Smad1/5/8, FOXO3a, Cyclin A) in PAECs and PASMCs. Inhibitors like Nobiletin and
  Resveratrol mitigate PH, while agent like Genistein counteract early PH. PI3K phosphoinositide
