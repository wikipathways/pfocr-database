caption: Role of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) in the pathogenesis of coronavirus
  disease 2019 and the inflammatory response. ACE2-mediated cardiovascular protection
  is lost following endocytosis of the enzyme along with severe acute respiratory
  syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) viral particles. Ang II (angiotensin II) levels
  elevate with increased activity of angiotensin 1 receptors (AT1R) at the cost of
  ACE2/Ang 1–7 driven pathways leading to adverse fibrosis, hypertrophy, increased
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), vasoconstriction, and gut dysbiosis. ADAM17 (a disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase 17)-mediated proteolytic cleavage of ACE2 is upregulated by
  endocytosed SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Activation of the AT1R by elevated Ang II
  levels also further increases ADAM17 activity. ADAM17 correspondingly also cleaves
  its primary substrate releasing soluble TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α) into the
  extracellular region where it has auto- and paracrine functionality. TNF-α activation
  of its tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) represents a third pathway elevating
  ADAM17 activity. TNF-α along with systemic cytokines released due to SARS-CoV-2
  infection and in conjunction with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension
  can lead to a cytokine storm. TMPRSS2 indicates transmembrane protease serine 2.
