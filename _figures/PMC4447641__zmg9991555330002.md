caption: 12-LO pathway in the β-cell. The figure depicts the pathways activated by
  12-LO in the islet β-cell in response to elevated glucose levels, saturated free
  fatty acids, or proinflammatory cytokines. Activation of 12-LO leads to the production
  of proinflammatory lipid intermediates (12-HPETE and 12-HETE), which subsequent
  trigger inflammatory pathways mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38-MAPK,
  and NOX. 12-HETE also prevents the translocation of Nrf2. Collectively, these pathways
  lead to increased ROS, oxidative stress, ER stress, and ultimately β-cell dysfunction
  and death. FFAR, free fatty acid receptor; PLA, phospholipase A; PGE2, prostaglandin
  E2; MCP1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1.
