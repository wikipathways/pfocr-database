caption: Upregulation of HER3 and resistance to anti-HER2 therapies. The kinase dead
  HER3 receptor, but not EGFR or HER2, can couple directly to p85, the regulatory
  subunit to PI3K. HER2/HER3 heterodimers are the most potent signaling complexes
  of the HER receptor network. Upon inhibition of HER2 and PI3K (as with lapatinib
  in figure), tumor cells upregulate expression of the HER3 protein. Other tyrosine
  kinases such as MET, FGFR2, Src, and EGFR present in HER2+ cancer cells can then
  phosphorylate tyrosines in the C-terminus of HER3 which, in turn, couples to p85
  to partially maintain PI3K active and thus limiting the anti-tumor effect of HER2
  inhibitors. Alternatively, the cell can use other receptor networks, i.e., IGF-IR
  to activate the PI3K/Akt survival pathway.
