caption: Canonical mitophagy pathway. Damaged mitochondria signal the need for removal
  by retaining PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane, which recruits cytosolic
  Parkin and p62. Parkin ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane proteins, allowing
  p62 recruitment and direct binding to LC3II. LC3II is an essential component of
  the autophagosome double-membrane and regulates its elongation and curvature. LC3II
  is formed following cleavage of the C-terminal by Atg4, and LC3I is subsequently
  conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by Atg7, Atg3, and the Atg5-Atg12-Atg16
  complex. Elongation of the autophagosomal membrane occurs around the mitochondria
  until it is fully engulfed. The autophagosome is then trafficked to the lysosome,
  where the outer autophagosomal membrane fuses with the lysosome. Internal components,
  including the mitochondria, are degraded and recycled by lysosomal hydrolases (cathepsin
  B, D, L). Mitophagy may assist the cell in reducing stress (protective mitophagy
  resulting in cell survival) or in inducing cell death (lethal mitophagy). Created
