caption: The SREBP pathway. When cells are depleted of sterols and fatty acids, SREBPs
  are transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, in which they are first cleaved
  by the Golgi-localized Site-1 Protease (S1P). S1P cleaves SREBPs in the luminal
  loop between the two membrane-spanning sequences. Once the two halves of the SREBP
  are separated, a second Golgi protease, Site-2 Protease (S2P), cleaves the NH2-terminal
  bHLH-Zip domain of SREBPs at a site located three residues within the membrane-spanning
  region. After the second cleavage, the NH2-terminal domain is released from the
  membrane and enters the nucleus, in which it activates genes controlling lipid synthesis.
