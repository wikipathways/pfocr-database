caption: 'GPCR signaling overview. GPCRs constitute a large family of transmembrane
  proteins that transduce extracellular stimuli to initiate intracellular signaling
  responses through an interaction of their intracellular domains with heterotrimeric
  G proteins. In GPCR signal transduction, binding of an agonist to the receptor induces
  a conformational change and activation of the GPCR. Exchange of GTP with GDP on
  the Gα subunit of the G protein then occurs, triggering dissociation of the Gα subunit
  from the Gβγ dimer and receptor. Free Gα and Gβγ then activate different signaling
  cascades and effector proteins. Gαs activates the cAMP-dependent pathway by stimulating
  the production of cAMP from ATP through direct activation of AC; cAMP then acts
  as a second messenger that activates PKA and other effectors, such as Epac and cyclic
  nucleotide-gated channels. Gαi inhibits the activity of AC and the production of
  cAMP. Gα12/13 is involved in RhoA activation through RhoGEF. Gαq stimulates its
  effector enzyme PLC, which then cleaves PIP2 into two second messengers, IP3 and
  DAG. IP3 mobilizes the release of ER-stored Ca2+ into the cytosol, whereas DAG activates
  PKC. Gβγ can act independently on effectors as well, including ion channels in the
  plasma membrane and PLC. Figure modified from  with permission from Nature Publishing
