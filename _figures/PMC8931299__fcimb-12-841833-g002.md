caption: The reaction catalyzed by ATCase and feedback regulation mechanism in de
  novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, and inhibitors against ATCase. (A) Aspartate
  Transcarbamoylase (ATCase) combines L-aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate into carbamoyl
  aspartate through an enzyme stabilized transition state and inhibition feedback
  by CTP. The ATC inhibitor PALA closely resembles this transition state intermediate.
  CTP (a product of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway) provides feedback inhibition
  of ATC activity. (B) Structures of PALA analogues as E. coli ATCase inhibitors.
  (C) Structures of T-state inhibitors against E. coli ATCase that prevent the allosteric
  transition. (D) Structures of allosteric inhibitors of huATCase ( ).
