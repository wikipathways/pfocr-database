caption: 'Roles of DUBs in the p53 pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  pathway in HNSCC. p53 signaling pathway: When stimulated by cellular stress or DNA
  damage, a sequence of phosphorylation events activates p53. USP7 is a key regulator
  of the p53 pathway, which deubiquitinates MDM2, increasing the intracellular level
  of MDM2, which in turn downregulates p53. NF-κB signaling pathway: In the canonical
  pathway, the IKK complex is activated and induces phosphorylation of IKK-β; subsequently,
  IKK-β phosphorylates IkB-α, causing its ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S
  proteome. Next, the p65/p50 dimer is released and enters the nucleus to turn on
  the downstream target genes. Mechanistically, CYLD can interfere with the NF-kB
  signaling pathway through deubiquitination of TRAF2 or Bcl-3, while USP4 represses
  NF-κB activation by interacting and deubiquitinating with RIP1. RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  pathway: When extracellular signals stimulate the cell, RAS recruits the RAF kinase
  for activation, and then RAF continues to activate downstream MEK and ERK, and eventually
  delivers cell proliferation and differentiation signals to the nucleus. USP28 deubiquitinates
  FBWX7, and increases ubiquitination and degradation of B-RAF, thereby enhancing
  the stability of RAF family members. DUBs, deubiquitinating enzymes; NF-κB, nuclear
