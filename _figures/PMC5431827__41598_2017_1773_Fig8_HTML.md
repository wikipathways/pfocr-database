caption: A proposed mechanism by which HBV hijacks IFN/JAK/STAT pathway via activating
  SOCS2 to facilitate immune evasion and viral infection. During hepatitis B virus
  (HBV) infection, the extracellular viral protein (hepatitis B e antigen, HBeAg)
  activates the cellular factor (suppressor of cytokine signaling 2, SOCS2) expression
  through regulating the extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling. Activated
  SOCS2 subsequently hijacks the IFN/JAK/STAT pathway to reduce tyrosine kinase 2
  (TYK2) stability and phosphorylation, downregulate interferon-α/β receptor 1 (IFN-α/βR1,
  IFNAR1) and interferon-λ1 receptor (cytokine receptor family 2 member 4, CRF2-4
  or IL-10Rβ) production, attenuate signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1 (STAT1) phosphorylation and nucleus translocation, and finally block IFN-stimulated
  genes (ISGs) expression, which results in the facilitation of HBV immune evasion,
  persistent infection, and possible pathogenesis.
