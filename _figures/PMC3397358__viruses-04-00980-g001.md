caption: Viral genes and the activation of apoptosis. Extrinsic signals from receptors
  (e.g., Fas ligand) culminate in the activation of caspase 8, which activates the
  effector caspase 3 while intrinsic signaling requires the participation of the mitochondria
  in releasing cytochrome c (shown as circles labeled “C”) to activate caspase 9 for
  the downstream activation of caspase 3. Key proteins in the intrinsic apoptosis
  signaling pathway are p53, both pro-apoptotic (e.g., Bax, Bak) and anti-apoptotic
  proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) from the Bcl-2 family. Viral genes (see yellow boxes),
  which act at multiple points along the different signaling pathways, target both
  the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways and enhances the pro-apoptotic
  effect brought upon by virus infection. Anti-apoptotic proteins (black oval) listed
  are key anti-apoptotic members from the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Other pathways
  triggered by coronavirus infections, such as ER stress and DNA damage response,
  activate apoptotic signaling pathways as well.
