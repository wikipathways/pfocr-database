caption: Mitochondrial dynamics in common and rare neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial
  fission is orchestrated by DRP1, which mutations have been linked to autosomal dominant
  encephalopathy and neonatal lethality caused by defective mitochondrial and peroxisomal
  fission. Mutations in REEP1 are associated with autosomal dominant Spastic Paraplegia
  Type 31 (SPG31) due to hyperphosphorylation of DRP1 causing increased mitochondrial
  fission. In contrast, SACSIN mutations lead to autosomal recessive Spastic Ataxia
  of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) underlying reduced DRP1 recruitment to mitochondrial
  membranes and decreased fission. PD, HD and AD associated proteins LRKK2, mHTT and
  Aβ, respectively, have been reported to directly interact with DRP1 stimulating
  mitochondrial fission. Mitochondrial fusion is regulated by the OMM protein MFN2
  and the inner mitochondrial membrane protein OPA1, whose mutations cause autosomal
  dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and Optic atrophy (DOA), respectively.
  αSyn interacts with TOM20 which is accompanied with a lower mitochondrial fusion
  rate. Specific removal of mitochondria through mitophagy in neurons is controlled
  by PINK1 and Parkin, mutations of both being related to early juvenile recessive
  PD. PINK1 signalizes depolarized mitochondria by inducing recruitment of Parkin
  and starting a signaling cascade to remove defective mitochondria through autophagosome-lysosome
  degradation. Other receptors linked to recessive forms of ALS are the mitophagy
  specific adaptor protein OPTN and the general autophagy adaptor p62. CMT-related
  GDAP1 mediates contacts between mitochondria and lysosomes and is hence thought
  to be involved in mitochondrial removal as well. A higher specialized pathway to
  eliminate mitochondrial fragments is known to pursue the mitochondrial-derived vesicles
  (MDVs) trail, where VPS35, linked to dominant forms of PD, triggers the force to
  generate vesicles which eventually fuse with lysosomes.
