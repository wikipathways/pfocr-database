caption: 'Mechanisms of immune-checkpoint signaling. (A) Mechanism of the CTLA-4 signaling
  pathway. Upon TCR engagement, intracellular vesicles containing CTLA-4 relocate
  to the immune synapse. Lck and ZAP-70 phosphorylate the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA-4,
  disrupting its intracellular transport by interfering with the interaction of AP-2.
  CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activation by activating PP2A, which inhibits Akt signaling.
  (B) Mechanism of the PD-1 signaling pathway. PD-1 is phosphorylated at tyrosine
  residues within ITIM and ITSM on its cytoplasmic tail following TCR stimulation.
  Subsequently, it recruits phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, which further dephosphorylate
  proximal signaling molecules downstream of TCR and CD28. PD-1 exerts its inhibitory
  effect on T-cell activation by activating PI3K via SHP-2, which inhibits Akt signaling.

  protein 2; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif; ITSM, immunoreceptor
