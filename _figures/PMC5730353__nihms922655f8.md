caption: Schematic of putative pathway of sodium channel contribution to intracellular
  Ca2+ levels and downstream pathways. Depolarization of glial membrane leads to activation
  of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) allowing influx of Na+. Increased [Na+]i
  induces reverse operation of the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), contributing to
  the level of [Ca2+]i. Ca2+signaling initiates downstream effects on cellular functions.
  Blockade of sodium channels with tetrodotoxin (TTX) and reverse operation of NCX
  with KB-R7943 attenuates [Ca2+]i levels. [Modified from ].
