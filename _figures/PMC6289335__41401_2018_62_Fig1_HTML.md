caption: Schematic diagram of the molecular actions of CTLA-4 and PD-1 on inhibiting
  T cell function. TCR binds to the antigen peptide presented by HLA class I and class
  II molecules to initiate cellular signaling. CD80 and CD86 expressed on antigen-presenting
  cells interact with CD28 on T cells, inducing the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR
  pathway, which co-operates with the TCR signaling to activate the downstream Ras/MEK/Erk
  pathway for the full activation of T cells. a Once TCR signaling is initiated, intracellular
  CTLA-4 translocates to the cell surface and competes with CD28 for binding to CD80
  and CD86; phosphorylated CTLA-4 also recruits and activates phosphatases PP2A and
  SHP-2, which dephosphorylates PTEN and subsequently inactivates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.
  b TCR signaling induces the upregulation of PD-1. The interaction of PD-1 with its
  ligands leads to the phosphorylation of PD-1, which recruits and activates SHP-2.
  Similar to the scenario for CTLA-4, PTEN is activated, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  is inhibited. In addition, the activation of PD-1 impairs the activity of the Ras/MEK/Erk
  pathway
