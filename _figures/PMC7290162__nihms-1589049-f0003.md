caption: SoNosP is a master regulator of the multicomponent S. oneidensis c-di-GMP
  signaling network. We hypothesize that the NosP/NahK signaling pathway inhibits
  the H-NOX/HnoK signaling pathway, which not only leads to a change in phosphate
  flux to the three response regulators (HnoB, HnoC, and HnoD) but also ultimately
  results in a change in the intracellular levels of c-di-GMP and therefore biofilm
  formation in S. oneidensis via the modulation of HnoB phosphodiesterase activity.
