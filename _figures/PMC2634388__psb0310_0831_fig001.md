caption: 'Chitin signaling pathway vs. flagellin-and EF-Tu-mediated pathways. Increasing
  evidence suggests these pathways share a common, downstream pathway to mediate plant
  innate immunity against different pathogens, although the initial stages are different,
  as partially reflected by different receptors. Blue circle: LysM motif, Yellow column:
  leucine-rich repeats; Red oval: kinase domain.'
