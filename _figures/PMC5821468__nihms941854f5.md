caption: 'Main intracellular pathways involving key signalling molecules activated
  upon binding of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to G-CSF receptor
  (G-CSFR). Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2 (JAK-2), which is hyperactivated in myeloid
  cells of patients with severe congenital neutropenia, leads to phosphorylation and
  activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and
  STAT5A, promoting proliferation of haematopoietic stem cells over granulocytic differentiation;
  sustained activation of STAT5A has been shown in patients with severe congenital
  neutropenia. Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (SHP-2) is another
  component of G-CSF signal transduction; SHP-2 induces dephosphorylation and, thereby,
  activation of tyrosine-protein kinase Lyn, which in turn in association with another
  tyrosine kinase Syk phosphorylates and activates haematopoietic lineage cell-specific
  protein (HCLS1), inducing myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic cells ,,,. Substantially
  increased levels of SHP-2 have been observed in neutrophils from patients with severe
  congenital neutropenia. In addition, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1)
  a transcription factor member of the Wnt signalling pathway, is severely diminished
  in myeloid progenitors of patients with severe congenital neutropenia. LEF-1 activates
  the granulocyte-specific transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha
  (C/EBPα) and its target genes cyclin D1 and c-MYC, as well as anti-apoptotic factor
  baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5 (survivin). Expression of all these
  proteins is severely diminished in myeloid cells of patients with severe congenital
  neutropenia, along with reduced activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K),
  serine/threonine-protein kinases (Akt), HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) and
  haematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein (HCLS1),. As a consequence G-CSF therapy
  activates NAMPT and by this the compensatory emergency granulopoiesis pathway: NAMPT
  converts nicotinamide (NA) into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), activating
  NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases, sirtuins (SIRTs), which in turn activate C/EBPβ.
  Upregulated pathways are shown in red, downregulated in blue.'
