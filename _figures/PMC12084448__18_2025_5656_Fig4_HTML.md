caption: Metabolomics study in NENs. (A) The flow chart of metabolomics is shown in
  the upper left panel. (B) NENs cause metabolic alterations and environmental factors
  can in turn affect the progression of NENs by affecting metabolism. (C) In addition
  to providing energy for tumor cells, metabolism can also cause epigenetic changes
  through metabolites and affect signaling pathways, thereby regulating tumor progression.
  (D) MMA, a serum metabolite, up-regulates the expression of INHBA through transcription
  factor FOXA2, which affects the downstream signaling pathways and regulates the
  progression of NENs
