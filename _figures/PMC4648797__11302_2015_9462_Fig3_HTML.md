caption: Model for leukotoxin from Aggregatibacter (LtxA)-induced haemolysis. 1 Interaction
  between LtxA and the erythrocyte membrane leads to an influx of ions and increase
  in [Ca2+]i. 2 The increase in [Ca2+]i stimulates a Ca2+-activated K+ efflux mediated
  by the Ca2+-activated K+ channel, KCa3.1. K+–Cl− co-transporters (KCCs) contribute
  to the K+ efflux. Initially, the K+ efflux exceeds the influx of ions leading to
  osmotically obliged H2O efflux and volume reduction. ATP is released from the cell
  through a yet unknown pathway and activates P2X receptors on the erythrocyte membrane,
  which is required for the full haemolytic effect of LtxA. In addition, activation
  of pannexin channels is also necessary for LtxA-induced haemolysis. 3 Later, the
  influx of ions exceeds the efflux of K+ resulting in osmotically obliged H2O influx
  and cell swelling. Finally, the erythrocyte lyses. (Reproduced from [] with permission
