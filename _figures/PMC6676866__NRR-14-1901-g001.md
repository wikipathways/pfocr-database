caption: 'Putative actions responsible for the beneficial effects of glucagon like
  peptide 2 (GLP-2) in the neurodegeneration.Exogenous GLP-2 is able to reduce the
  expression of markers of inflammation and stress, the glia activation and the apoptosis
  in the brains of high fat diet mice. Intracerebroventricular infusion of GLP-2 increases
  glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity by activating GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R)
  and intracellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling pathways
  in proopiomelanocortin expressing neurons. In cultured hippocampal neurons, GLP-2R
  activation acutely and dose-dependently stimulates de novo synthesis of protein
  by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. GLP-2R over-expression improves the
  impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) and it
  increases the neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, neuronal activity, and density
  of dendritic spines and mushroom spines in hippocampal neurons. p-ERK: Phosphorylated
  extracellular regulated protein kinases; Hsp60: heat shock protein 60; iNOS: inducible
  nitric oxide synthase; IL: interleukin; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α; NFkB: nuclear
  factor-kappa B; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
