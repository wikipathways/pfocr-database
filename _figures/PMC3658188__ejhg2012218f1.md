caption: A workflow diagram of the FPPP method. In the first step, the disease gene
  set and biological pathway 1 were translated into an FPD and an FPP1 using the functional
  profiling translation. Then, to quantify the association between an FPD and an FPP1,
  the semantic similarity measurement was conducted to calculate their concordance
  score. Finally, for each disease, the concordance scores of 186 biological pathways
  were calculated and prioritised to infer risk pathways. A workflow diagram of an
  example of how the concordance score between DCM genes and DCM pathway is calculated
  is shown in .
