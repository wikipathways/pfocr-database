caption: 'Effect of autophagy modulation on HIV-1 infection. Cell scheme summarizing
  the autophagy modulatory effect on HIV-1 viral life cycle (early steps: viral entry
  and infection; late steps: viral replication). (A) This panel shows that chemical
  inhibitors of autophagy and associated factors could activate (factors indicated
  in green boxes) or prevent (factors indicated in pink boxes) early HIV- 1 infection
  (left), or promote viral replication (right). (B) This panel shows the effect of
  mutants of autophagy associated factors, or specific RNAi or CRISPR/Cas editing
  acting on autophagy-associated genes in HIV-1 early infection or viral replication.
  Autophagic factors that activate HIV-1 infection or replication are indicated in
  green boxes, whereas factors inhibiting HIV-1 are indicated in pink boxes. Arrow
  colors represent the reported positive (green) and negative (red) effects on the
  different steps of the viral life cycle, with dotted arrows signaling the HIV-1
  activation pathway. This figure supports the information summarized in . Cell schemes
  were created with BioRender.com.'
