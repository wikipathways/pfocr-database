caption: The remaining network illustrates the regulatory relationship between TFs
  and their target genes in antibiotic resistance pathway. Circles indicate TF proteins,
  and squares indicate target genes. Red arrows show the binding sites located in
  the putative promoters of the target genes, establishing the regulatory relationship.
  To save space, ‘PA’ is removed in the names of all TFs and their target genes.
