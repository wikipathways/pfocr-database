caption: 'Schematic of MAPK signalling in the context of wild type BRAF and mutant
  BRAFV600E. (A) In cells expressing wild type BRAF, ligand-induced activation of
  RTKs enhances RAS-GTP activity resulting in the dimerization and activation of RAF
  family members. This binding serves to phosphorylate MEK1/2, which then phosphorylates
  ERK, resulting in ERK-mediated transcription. (B) Hyper-activation of the pathway
  in melanoma can occur through oncogenic mutations in NRAS, BRAF, MEK1, ERK, or the
  loss of function mutations in NF1, FBW7, and USP28. Class I BRAF mutations (V600E)
  function as monomers to engage the MEK/ERK signal cascade. Mutation statistics were
  extrapolated from cBioPortal []. SHC, SHC adaptor protein 1; GRB2, growth factor
  receptor bound protein 2; SOS, son of sevenless; RAS, RAS proto-oncogene; NF1, neurofibromatosis
  1; FBW7, F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7; USP28, Ubiquitin specific protease
  28; TF, transcription factors; MAPK: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase; BRAF: v-raf
  murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B; RTK: receptor tyrosine kinase; RAF: proto
  oncogene; MEK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-related
  kinase.'
