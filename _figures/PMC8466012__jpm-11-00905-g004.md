caption: 'Outline of the cellular oxidative metabolism under normoxia. In O2 abundance,
  glucose catabolism to pyruvate is active. Next, pyruvate is transported to mitochondria
  to fuel the TCA cycle. The rate-limiting enzyme, PDH complex, is dephosphorylated
  and active. Glucose carbons form acetyl-CoA, and, as citrate, are transported to
  the cytoplasm for FA biosynthesis. ATP is produced mainly via OxPhos, with the generation
  of ROS. The continuous degradation of the HIF1α protein occurs under high oxygen
  levels. OxPhos favors spontaneous differentiation of PSCs. Abbreviations: AMP—adenosine
  monohosphate; AMPK—adenosine 5’-monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ATP—adenosine
  triphosphate; ETC—electron transport chain; FA—fatty acids; GLUTs—glucose transporters;
  HIF1α—hypoxia inducible factor 1α; NADPH—nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate;
  OXPHOS—oxidative phosphorylation; PDH—pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDK1/4—pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase 1/4; PPP—pentose phosphate pathway; ROS—reactive oxygen species; TCA—tricarboxylic
  acid.'
