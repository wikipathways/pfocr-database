caption: Cross-talk between cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
  in the regulation of miRNA expression. In the tumour microenvironment, the cross-talk
  between the carcinoma cells and CAFs yields soluble factors inducing downregulation
  of endothelial cell-specific miRNAs, such as miR-126, with resulting induction of
  proliferation, angiogenesis and malignancy. Restoration of miR-126 inhibits the
  IRS-AKT pathway, thus initiating a metabolic programme leading to high autophagic
  flux and HIF1α stabilisation, plus angiogenesis inhibition incompatible with tumour
  progression.
