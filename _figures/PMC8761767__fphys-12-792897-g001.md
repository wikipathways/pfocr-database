caption: 'The interleukin-33 (IL-33)/suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) pathway.
  Activation of the IL-33/ST2 pathway: IL-33 binds to a receptor complex composed
  of ST2L and interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RACP) on the cell membrane.
  The interaction between the C-terminal domain of this receptor complex promotes
  the recruitment of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), IL-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1 (IRAK1), IRAK4, and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor
  6 (TRAF6), thus leading to the activation of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), and P38 pathways. The activation of these pathways facilitates the
  gene expression of chemokines and growth factors. The inhibition of the IL-33/ST2
  pathway: soluble ST2 (sST2) acts as a decoy receptor for IL-33 to block the binding
  of IL-33 to the receptor. single immunoglobulin IL1-related receptor (SIGIRR) can
  destroy ST2L/IL1RAcP heterodimers.'
