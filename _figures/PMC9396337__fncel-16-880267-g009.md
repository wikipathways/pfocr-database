caption: A proposed working model depicting neurochemical, neurobiological, and behavioral
  changes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their reversal or protection by EA
  after the insult. TBI induces overexpression of certain HDAC isoforms, notably HDAC1
  and HDAC3. The cell survival BDNF-associated Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway is also
  downregulated after TBI; this could be directly mediated by the brain injury or
  indirectly mediated through overexpressed HDACs. Either the overexpression of HDACs
  or aberrant BDNF-associated Akt-GSK-3β signaling may lead to activation of microglia
  and astrocytes as well as increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α
  and IL-6. Either of these aberrant neurochemical events may also trigger overexpression
  of the proapoptotic factor Bax to induce neuronal apoptosis. The end result is marked
  deficits in motor and sensory behavioral performance as well as impaired learning
  and memory. EA treatment at the acupoints normalizes these neurobiological events
  and robustly facilitates behavioral recovery.
