caption: Schematic molecular model of the relationship between cellular growth of
  EGFR-mutant lung tumors and the link to phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and
  activation of AKT, a kinase known to promote cell survival and migration. TKIs,
  such as gefitinib or osimertinib, block this pathway at the level of the EGFR receptor,
  stagnating cell growth and inducing apoptosis. When NRP2b is present, GSK3β is recruited
  to phosphorylate and degrade NRP2a-recruited PTEN, leading to enhanced AKT activation
  with promotion of survival and metastasis. This effect is predicted to enhance the
  effect of residual EGFR activity remaining in the presence of EGFR inhibitors. When
  NRP2b is absent, NRP2a-recruited PTEN is stabilized, opposing PI3,4,5P3 production
  by PI3K and thereby inhibiting AKT, survival, and metastatic spread, thus enhancing
  the effect of EGFR TKI.
