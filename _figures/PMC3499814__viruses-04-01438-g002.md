caption: The RIG-I signaling pathway and inhibition by influenza A viruses (Figure
  adapted from []). By-products of viral replication are 5'-triphosphates ssRNA and
  dsRNA which can bind to the RIG-1 receptor, leading to conformational changes, causing
  exposure of the CARDS which are ubiqutinated by TRIM25. Subsequently, RIG-1 associates
  with MAVS and thereby starts a signaling cascade leading to activation of transcription
  factors IRF3, NF-κB and ATF-2/JunC, resulting in the transcription of IFN-β mRNA.
  Indicated in red are sites at which the influenza A virus interferes with this pathway,
  as explained in the text.
