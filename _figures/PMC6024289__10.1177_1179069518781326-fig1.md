caption: Serotonin (5-HT) disinhibits the ASH nociceptive neurons by modulating Ca++-dependent
  negative feedback. The aversive odorant 1-octanol activates an olfactory signal
  transduction pathway, which culminates in the activation of OSM-9/OCR-2 transient
  receptor potential (TRP) channels, and depolarizing inward currents (sensory stimulation,
  green). Depolarization activates EGL-19 L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs),
  and the resulting Ca++ influx activates the SLO-1 Ca++-activated K+ channel, leading
  to hyperpolarizing outward currents (Ca++-dependent negative feedback, red). This
  Ca++ influx was also a major contributor to the 1-octanol–dependent Ca++ signals
  recorded in Ca++ imaging experiments., In parallel, 5-HT signaling, through the
  Gαq-coupled receptor SER-5, leads to the release of intracellular Ca++ (via the
  IP3 receptor), which activates the CaN orthologue TAX-6 to dephosphorylate and inhibit
  EGL-19 (5-HT modulation, blue), thereby decreasing 1-octanol–dependent Ca++ influx,
  reducing SLO-1–mediated negative feedback, and potentiating 1-octanol–evoked depolarization.,
