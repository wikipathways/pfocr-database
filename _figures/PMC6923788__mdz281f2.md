caption: Proposed model of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-estrogen receptor
  (ER) crosstalk. Estrogen activates nuclear ER known as the genomic pathway and membrane
  ER known as the non-genomic pathway. Membrane ER can associate with growth factor
  signaling components including PI3K. Activation of PI3K pathway activates its main
  effector AKT. After activation, AKT goes to the nucleus where it encounters nuclear
  substrate such as the H3K4 mono-and di-menthyltransferase KMT2D, an important regulator
  of nuclear ER. AKT phosphorylates KMT2D at S1331 to attenuate KMT2D function, inducing
  a loss of binding of KMT2D to ER target genes and a suppression of ER-dependent
  transcription (genomic pathway). Upon PI3Kα inhibition, AKT is no longer active
  and cannot phosphorylate KMT2D. KMT2D induces mono- and dimethylation of H3K4, is
  recruited to ER target loci and activates ER-dependent transcription (AKT-dependent
  mechanism). A target gene of ER is the PI3K effector SGK1. Upon PI3Kα inhibition,
  ER upregulates SGK1 transcription. Elevated SGK1, in turn, directly phosphorylates
  KMT2D at S1331, attenuating its function and subsequent ER activity as a negative
  repression feedback loop (SGK-dependent mechanism). ER-dependent increase of SGK1
  upon PI3Kα inhibition in transient and may only be active few hours after PI3K pathway
  inhibition, while the overall ER-response can be sustained.
