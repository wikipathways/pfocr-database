caption: Summary schematic of sustained shear stimulus flow-mediated vasodilation
  (SS-FMD) compared with reactive hyperemia flow-mediated vasodilation (RH-FMD). The
  results from cell culture and isolated vessel studies suggest that transient and
  sustained shear stress are differentially transduced by the endothelium. Transient
  increases in shear stress are thought to activate endothelial nitric oxide (NO)
  synthase (eNOS) and produce NO via a Ca2+-dependent pathway, whereas sustained increases
  in shear stress activate eNOS in a distinct, Ca2+-independent pathway (, ). Hypothetically
  extrapolated to in vivo conduit artery studies, RH-FMD is depicted as reflecting
  primary recruitment of the Ca2+-dependent eNOS activation pathway. SS-FMD is depicted
  as initially eliciting Ca2+-dependent eNOS activation (if the initial increase in
  shear is abrupt); however, the prolonged stimulus is identified as relying to a
  greater extent on Ca2+-independent eNOS activation. There is evidence for involvement
  of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors, namely epoxyeicosatrienoic acids
  (EETs), in both RH-FMD and SS-FMD (, ). Reactive oxygen species appear to contribute
  to SS-FMD (), and H2O2 may be the responsible signaling molecule. There is emerging
  evidence that endothelin-1 (ET-1) binding to endothelial ET-1 type B (ETB) receptors
  contributes to SS-FMD by facilitating ET-1 uptake; when ET-1 binds to ET type A
  (ETA) receptors, vasoconstriction is promoted (). Distinct RH-FMD versus SS-FMD
  pathways may be differentially affected by certain interventions and cardiovascular
  risk factors [smoking, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), hypercholesterolemia, high-fat
  meal, and acute mental stress], thereby providing a theoretical basis for the disparate
  findings of SS-FMD and RH-FMD. There is a need to incorporate both SS-FMD and RH-FMD
  in future studies to further understand the mechanistic and functional distinctions
  of SS-FMD and RH-FMD in the context of endothelial function.
