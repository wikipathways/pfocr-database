caption: TREM2 regulates microglial cholesterol metabolism and participates in the
  response to myelin damage. The activation of the TREM2-DAP12 signaling pathway may
  promote microglial cholesterol efflux and reduces intracellular cholesterol to be
  stored as CE, possibly by activating PLCγ2. The effluent cholesterol might be carried
  by APOE-containing lipoproteins. Besides, TREM2 mediates the microglial response
  to myelin damage, leading to increased phagocytosis of myelin debris and thus may
  promote remyelination.
