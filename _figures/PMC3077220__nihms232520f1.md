caption: 'Molecular chaperone GRP78 is normally bound to the three stress sensors:
  PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. Its dissociation during ER stress triggers dimerization or
  cleavage of the sensors, which unleashes a cascade of molecular signaling events
  as indicated by solid arrows. Dashed arrows indicate potential cross talks between
  different pathways. The components analyzed in the present study are shown in boldface.'
