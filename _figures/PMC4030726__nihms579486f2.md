caption: 'Schematic representation of signaling pathways modulated by PKD1 in cancer.
  The deregulated expression of PKD1 results in the development of cancer. The schematic
  representation shows the pathways that activate PKD1, and the various downstream
  pathways and functions modulated by this kinase (maroon ovals). The activation of
  various membrane receptors, such as GPCR and other growth factor receptors (GR),
  leads to the activation of PKD1 by the PLC-PKC pathway through the formation of
  DAG. DAG modulates PKD1 function by binding and quickly recruiting it to the cell
  membrane for activation by PKCs. PKD1 can also be activated by the Golgi Gβγ-PKCε
  in the Golgi apparatus, by proteolytic cleavage by caspase 3, by oxidative stress
  resulting in PKD1 activation on mitochondrial surface through the action of SRC-Abl
  kinase and PKCδ, by UVB ray-activated SRC kinase, and by a PKC-independent self-activation
  mechanism. Activated PKD1 is rapidly translocated from the membrane to the cytoplasm
  and eventually to the nucleus, where it regulates downstream pathways. Activated
  PKD1 also regulates the process of vesicle trafficking from the Golgi to the membrane,
  which eventually controls cell surface proteins that are involved in cell adhesion,
  cell polarity, and motility. Depending on the cell type, PKD1 functions as either
  a tumor suppressor or an oncogene within the cell. A, tumor suppressor functions
  of PKD1. PKD1 has been shown to inhibit cancer in the prostate, breast, and GI tract.
  PKD1 inhibits tumorigenesis by enhancing cell adhesion and inhibiting the function
  of proteins involved in cell migration, cell invasion, cell proliferation, and EMT.
  PKD1 phosphorylates E-cadherin and β-catenin, thereby enhancing cell-cell adhesion.
  PKD1 helps to maintain cellular polarity by phosphorylating Par-1 polarity–associated
  kinase and thus enhancing its cytoplasmic sequestration by 14-3-3 protein. Activated
  PKD1 also helps to establish cell polarity by positively regulating the TGN carriers
  to the basolateral membrane. Activated PKD1 can also inhibit the transcriptional
  activity of β-catenin and AR, resulting in reduced cell proliferation. It also inhibits
  EMT by regulating the activity of snail transcription factor. PKD1 negatively regulates
  cell invasion by influencing the levels of MMPs through the modulation of HDACs.
  It also negatively regulates actin remodeling and thus cell motility through the
  phosphorylation of SSH-1L and cortactin. B, prooncogenic role of PKD1. The upregulation
  of PKD1 has been linked to the development of pancreatic and skin cancer, and it
  may also be involved in prostate cancer (although this notion is controversial).
  Some of the pathways that are modulated by PKD1 and may result in a prooncogenic
  role are as follows: Activated PKD1 enhances cell survival and proliferation by
  enhancing DNA synthesis and upregulating the function of Erk1/2 protein in the MAPK
  pathway, leading to the accumulation of c-Fos. Activated PKD1 decreases apoptosis
  by suppressing the function of the JNK pathway, resulting in decreased c-Jun levels.
  Under oxidative stress conditions, PKD1 enhances cell survival through activation
  of the NFkB pathway. PKD1 expression contributes to oncogenesis by enhancing angiogenesis
  by regulating the activity of HDAC5 and HDAC7.'
