caption: Schematic representation of mechanisms of innate and acquired resistance
  to immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs). Interferon (IFN)-γ signals via the type
  2 IFN (IFN-2) receptor which relies on Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) phosphorylation
  to initiate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) dimerization
  and transcriptional alterations on nuclear translocation. Similarly WNT phosphorylation
  cascades initiate alterations in β-catenin signalling. Alterations in this pathway
  or mutations in JAK1/2 lead to transcriptional modification of proteins which may
  result in, for example, impaired major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
  folding, or programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) upregulation. Alternatively,
  epigenetic modification may alter regulatory protein function. Impaired MHC class
  I folding impairs T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of mutation-associated neoantigens
  (MANAs) or fewer tumour mutations and their associated MANAs or less heterogeneity,
  a greater degree of which would normally induce cytotoxic T-cell binding, and the
  initiation of an effective antitumour response. In addition, an increased infiltration
  of regulatory T-cell (T-reg) and anti-inflammatory tumour-associated macrophages
  (TAMs) within the tumour microenvironment (TME) limit the induction of an adequate
  immune response.
