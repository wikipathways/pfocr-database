caption: Transcription factor PxGATAd serves as a positive regulatory factor by binding
  with different GATA-like CREs to regulate transcription from the PxmALP promoter
  region from Cry1Ac susceptible and resistant strains, PxGATAd is trans-regulated
  by the upstream activated MAPK signaling pathway. In the Cry1Ac susceptible strain,
  a large fragment insertion (represented by a red box) was detected. In the resistant
  strain, a cis-acting element mutation generated by a six-nucleotide insertion near
  the CRE5 element negatively affects the binding of PxGATAd to CRE5, repressing the
  transcription of PxmALP. Therefore, both cis-acting element mutation and trans-regulatory
  factors are involved in regulating transcription of PxmALP, thus mediating Cry1Ac
  resistance in P. xylostella.
