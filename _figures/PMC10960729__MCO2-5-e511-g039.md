caption: Signal transduction mechanism of cGAS–STING. The cytoplasmic dsDNA is sensed
  by cGAS, which is activated to form a dimer, assembling a higher‐order oligomer
  of cGAS:dsDNA (2n:2) with dsDNA. Subsequently, cGAS catalyzes GTP and ATP to generate
  2′,3′‐cGAMP, which binds to STING in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), inducing allosteric
  and rotation of STING to further form higher‐order oligomers. Oligomerized STING
  is transported from ER to Golgi by COPII and ERGIC vesicles to recruit multiple
  TBK1 molecules. Then, adjacent TBK1 molecules phosphorylate each other and cause
  phosphorylation of adjacent STING to form a platform for IRF3 recruitment. TBK1
  binding to STING leads to the phosphorylation of IRF3, which then forms an IRF3
  dimer and enters the nucleus to induce the transcription of IFN‐I. The binding of
  IFN‐I to its receptor further activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and induces
  the transcription of ISG. TBK1 also leads to the phosphorylation and degradation
  of IκB, and the released NFκB (p65/p50) enters the nucleus to induce the transcription
  of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, dsDNA induces autophagosome formation
  and phosphorylation of p62 by activated TBK1 to promote its binding to STING and
  guide STING into autophagosomes for degradation. COPII, cytoplasmic coat protein
  complex II; ERGIC, ER‐Golgi intermediate compartment; IFN‐I, type I interferon;

  description: Signal transduction mechanism of cGAS–STING. The cytoplasmic dsDNA
