caption: Proteostatic regulation of Smo and Ptc.(A) In the absence of Hh, Ptc promotes
  the ubiquitination of Smo mediated by Smurf, internalization and degradation of
  Smo. Krz promotes Smo internalization in parallel to Smo ubiquitination. (B) In
  the presence of Hh, Smo is phosphorylated and SUMOylated, forming dimers/oligomers,
  dissociating from Smurf, and translocates to cell surface. Smurf associates with
  and ubiquitinates Ptc, leading to its internalization and degradation.
