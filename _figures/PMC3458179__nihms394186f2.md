caption: NAD+ is the primary neurotransmitter mediating purinergic inhibitory regulation
  of colon motility (, ). ADP-ribose (ADPR), a metabolite of NAD+, could also be a
  factor in inhibitory neurotransmission, either as a neurotransmitter or a metabolite
  of extracellular NAD+ (). NAD+ is stored in and released from neural vesicles in
  nerve varicosities into the neuro-effector junction (NEJ) upon action potential
  firings (APs). NAD+ binds to postjunctional P2Y1 receptors (, ) on PDGFRα+ cells
  () and mediate activation of phospholipase (PLC), formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3), release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (i.e., sarcoplasmic reticulum,
  SR) and activation of small-conductance K+ channels (SK3). Hyperpolarization transients
  (i.e., inhibitory junction potentials, IJPs) conduct to smooth muscle cells (SMC)
  via gap junctions (GJ) between PDGFRα+ cells and SMC (). IJPs reduce excitability
  and cause muscle relaxation. NAD+ is rapidly degraded to ADPR by CD38 and/or an
  unknown metabolic pathway (). ADPR is further degraded to adenosine 5′-monophosphate
  (AMP) and adenosine (ADO) by well-known pathways (not shown). ADPR also binds to
  postjunctional P2Y1 receptors and produces responses identical to NAD+ (). ATP is
  also released in colonic muscles upon electrical field stimulation, but it appears
  to originate primarily from non-neuronal sources. ATP is quickly degraded to adenosine
  5′-diphosphate (ADP), AMP, and ADO. ADO can activate P1 G-protein-coupled receptors
  on SMC membrane. ATP and ADP may participate in the post-junctional responses mediated
  by P2Y1 receptors (dotted arrows), but data shown in  suggest that ATP also binds
  to additional P2Y receptors (P2YRs) expressed by SMCs and possibly other cell types.
  Purine binding to P2YRs in SMCs activates SK channels and non-selective cation channels
  (NSCC). With cells at physiological gradients and potentials, the dominant responses
  of SMCs to ATP and NAD+ are activation of inward current (). Thus, it is unlikely
  that IJPs due to transduction of the purinergic neurotransmitter signal could be
  mediated by SMCs.
