caption: Cranial neural crest cells treated with JAG1-dynabeads with or without DAPT,
  a NOTCH canonical pathway inhibitor, showed activation of the JAK2-STAT5 pathway.
  Red and Green solid arrows indicate non-canonical and canonical NOTCH targets of
  JAG1, respectively, downstream of JAK2-STAT5 (Prl2c2, Id1, Rhou). Light green arrows
  indicate non-canonical NOTCH targets and yellow arrows indicate canonical NOTCH
  targets. Dotted arrows indicate targets that may or may not be activated by STAT5.
  Navy blue arrows indicate targets that can induce phosphorylation of STAT5. Pathways
  activated non-canonically downstream of JAG1 revealed by pathway analyses are indicated
  by light blue arrows. Greater the arrow thickness higher the gene expression levels.
  All these events lead to JAG1-induced CNC cell osteoblast commitment and thereafter
  bone formation by intramembranous ossification.
