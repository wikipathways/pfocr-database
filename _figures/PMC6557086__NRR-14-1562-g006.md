caption: A proposed model for the metabolic effects of L-norvaline in the 3×Tg-AD
  mouse brain.The treatment leads to reduced quantities of Aβ fibrils and prefibrillar
  oligomers (Aβo), which is caused by a decline in the levels of amyloid precursor
  protein (APP) but not beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1). L-Norvaline treatment reduces microglial
  density and shifts their phenotype from activated to resting, which, in turn, decreases
  the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), reduces synaptic pruning and increases
  spine density. L-Norvaline is a substrate of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase
  (BCAT), which produces glutamate as the main product. The overproduction of glutamate
  leads to an increase in the expression levels of vesicular glutamate transporter
  1 and 3 (VGLUT-1 and VGLUT-3, respectively), synaptophysin (SYP), synaptotagmins
  (SYTs). TNFα activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. L-Norvaline
  also reduces the levels of RAC-alpha protein-serine/threonine kinase (Akt1) and
  inhibits ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1). Nerve growth factor (NGF) binding
  to high affinity nerve growth factor receptor (TrkA) (which shows increased levels
  of expression in the L-Norvaline treated mice) causes the phosphorylation of TrkA
  and activation of multiple preventing apoptosis signaling pathways. Glial cell-derived
  neurotrophic factor (GDNF) binds to a multi-component receptor (GDNFRα1 and RET),
  which induces cell survival mechanisms. The levels of RET are escalated in the L-norvaline
  treated mice. Additionally, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), (which is elevated
  by the treatment as well) serves as a second signaling receptor for GDNF. L-Norvaline
  increases the levels of sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2), which leads to an escalation
  of the neuroprotective factor sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) levels. Finally, L-norvaline
  increases the levels of superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] (SOD), and phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase regulatory subunit alpha (PIK3R1). Red arrows represent elevated levels,
  and blue arrows designate reduced levels compared to the vehicle-treated controls.
