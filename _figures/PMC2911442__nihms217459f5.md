caption: WRN participates in the regulation of PCNA mono-ubiquitination and subsequent
  TLS through interaction with PCNA. WRN is phosphorylated by ATM/NBS1 in response
  to DNA damage and this phosphorylation leads to a degradation of WRN. PCNA is released
  from WRN complex following WRN degradation and then could be mono-ubiquitinated
  by Rad18/Rad6. Mono-ubiquitination of PCNA activates translesion DNA synthesis.
