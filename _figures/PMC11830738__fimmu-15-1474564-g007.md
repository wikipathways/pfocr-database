caption: The interaction between malignant T cell and CAFs with SOX4-related mechanisms
  in the process. (A) Malignant T cells in MF induce the activation and formation
  of CAFs, which, in turn, modulating cancer progression. (B) Activation of SOX4 expression
  in malignant T cells. IL-6 generated by CAFs, activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway
  in malignant T cells, positively regulated the transcription of SOX4, further activating
  the PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog signaling pathway, hence promoting
  tumorigenesis. (C) Activation of SOX4 expression in CAFs. TGF-β generated by malignant
  cells activates the TGF-β signaling in NFs or epithelial cells, leading to the phosphorylation
  of SMAD2/3, which promotes SOX4 expression after translocating to the nucleus. By
  interacting with β-catenin and ERG, SOX4 induces the expression of EZH2, which might
  directly regulate TWIST1 and modulating the EMT procession, reprograming other cells
  into CAFs. The SOX4–EZH2 axis also modifies the promoter region of tumor-suppressor
  microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-31, miR-212/132, and miR-129-2. By repressing
  the transcription of these miRNAs, SOX4 involved in the inhibition of cell proliferation
  and migration
