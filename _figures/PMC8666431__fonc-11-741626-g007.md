caption: 'The landscape of major altered genes and significantly altered pathways
  in OSCC. The NFκB signaling (A) and calcium signaling pathways (B) were identified
  by IPA canonical pathway analysis. Pill illustrations show FDA approved drugs which
  are targeting receptor tyrosine kinase families and PIK3CA. Genes were assigned
  to each pathway and represented with their mutation frequencies (orange font: top
  200 frequently mutated genes [≥8%] which were imported into the IPA analysis; gray
  font: genes with <8% mutation frequencies which were not included in IPA analysis).'
