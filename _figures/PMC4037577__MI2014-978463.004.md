caption: Signaling pathway of SFRP5, a decoy for WNT signaling pathway, which further
  activates β-catenin and then JNK. Activated JNK promotes proinflammatory cytokines
  TNFα, IL-6, and MCP-1. Under obese state, the production of SFRP5 was reduced and
  thus the decoying effect was weak, which is translated into the increased proinflammation
  and insulin resistance.
