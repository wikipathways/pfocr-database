caption: Cholinergic signaling via nAChRs and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs)
  regulates striatal function. (A) Diagrammatic representation of the primary striatal
  neurotransmitter systems. Cholinergic interneurons are the primary source of striatal
  acetylcholine (ACh) and regulate its function via pre-and post-synaptic nAChRs and
  muscarinic receptors. Acetylcholine regulates the activity of direct and indirect
  GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) by acting at α4β2* nAChRs, as well as M1 and/or
  M4 muscarinic receptors. In addition, acetylcholine modulates striatal dopamine
  (DA) release via an interaction at α6β2* and α4β2* nAChRs along with M2 and/or M4
  muscarinic receptors on nigrostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic (5-HT) terminals,
  which further regulates the output of direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Likewise,
  acetylcholine can modulate GABAergic interneuron activity via α7 and α4β2* nAChRs,
  as well as M2 muscarinic receptors. Acetylcholine can further control striatal function
  via α7 nAChRs and M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors located on the excitatory glutamatergic
  (GLU) inputs arising from the cortex. (B) Molecular signaling modulated by nAChRs.
  Stimulation of nAChRs increases intracellular Ca2+ which promotes activation of
  PKA and CAMKII to initiate ERK1/2 cascade activity. nAChR signaling can also occur
  via Ca2+ -independent mechanisms thru the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. (C) Molecular signaling
  via mAChRs. These receptors are coupled to G proteins. M2 and M4 receptors couple
  preferentially to Gi/0, whereas M1, M3 and M5 receptors mainly couple to Gq/11.
  Upon stimulation, M2 and M4 receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, leading
  to a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels and PKA activity to ultimately regulate
  ERK1/2 activity. M1, M3, and M5 receptors activate PKC by means of upstream PLC
  activation and increase in IP3 and Ca2+ levels. PKC activity leads to the activation
  of the MAP kinase cascade and ERK1/2.
