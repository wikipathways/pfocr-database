caption: 'AGO4-dependent smRNA-mediated regulation of jasmonate signaling during the
  interaction of N. attenuata with the hemibiotrophic F. brachygibbosum pathogen.
  An AGO4-dependent miRNA-target network of JA-pathway genes was constructed. Red,
  green, and gray represent upregulation, downregulation, and no-regulation, respectively,
  in irAGO4 compared to wild type. Genes (ovals) represent the hubs whereas miRNAs
  (rectangles) represent the nodes. Black arrows indicate regulation of genes in different
  layers of JA signaling. Gene involved in JA biosynthesis are connected with empty
  arrows, whereas genes participating in JA-Ile conjugation are connected with shaded/filled
  arrows. miRNAs with black borders indicate those miRNAs target at least three genes
  in the pathway, whereas miRNAs with blue borders indicate miRNAs targeting two genes.
  Light blue, peach, and gray-shaded regions of the network indicate three layers:
  JA biosynthesis, JA-Ile biosynthesis, and JAZ signaling. Gene sequences were obtained
  from NCBI (accession numbers are provided in Supplemental Table S5), whereas miRNA
  sequences were from this study (; Supplemental Table S2). miRNA target predictions
  were made using the server psRNATarget as described in the literature (; , ). The
  network was constructed with the help of the program platform Cytoscape 3.6.1.'
