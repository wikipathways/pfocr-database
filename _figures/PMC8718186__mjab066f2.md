caption: The cGAS‒STING pathway in metabolic and kidney diseases. HFD, MCD diet, or
  alcohol induces the activation of the cGAS‒STING pathway in metabolic tissues such
  as adipose tissue and the liver. In adipose tissue, activated cGAS‒STING pathway
  promotes inflammation and suppresses thermogenesis, resulting in obesity and insulin
  resistance in mice. In the liver, cGAS‒STING activation is associated with the development
  of ALD, NAFL, and NASH. In the kidney, activated cGAS‒STING pathway contributes
  to both AKI and CKD.
