caption: (A) Yap1 and Sln1 signalling in response to oxidative stress via H2O2. The
  two pathways were added to Boolean signalling network. Trx1/2 exhibits cross-talk
  to Msn2/4, a component that is also part of the nutrient sensing pathway PKA. The
  figure is made with Cell Designer []. (B) ROS/RNS reactions that were added to the
  enzyme-constrained FBA model. The cell is exposed to oxidative stress as a consequence
  of electron leakage in the electron transport chain (ETC). (C) Schematic view of
  one time step in the multi-scale model. The enzyme-constrained FBA fluxes based
  on the current fraction of intact and damaged proteins determine the input states
  of the Boolean signalling layer. A set of Boolean rules alter the states of the
  signalling proteins, that eventually induce gene ex-/repression via a transcriptional
  layer, leading to constraints in individual enzyme usages. Solving the regulated
  enzyme-constrained FBA gives rise to a growth rate as well as a metabolic damage
  formation rate, that feed into the ODE model of growth and damage accumulation that
  is then solved for one time step. If the cell has accumulated enough biomass, the
  cell divides in an instantaneous event. Iterating the model over time-steps until
  the model becomes infeasible corresponds to a lifespan simulation.
