caption: Chemoattractant stimulation promotes the F-actin-dependent recruitment of
  the Sca1 complex to the plasma membrane and the subsequent activation of the RasC-TORC2-PKB/PKBR1
  pathway at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells. This signaling pathway controls
  cAMP production and leads to modulation of the F-actin cytoskeleton, thereby regulating
  signal relay and cell motility, respectively. The RasG-PI3K pathway appears to regulate
  F-actin, ACA (via CRAC), and PKB independently of the RasC-TORC2 pathway, and other
  regulators and/or Ras proteins control TORC2 activity in addition to RasC. It is
  also possible that RasC has other effectors. TORC2 and PKB/PKBR1 regulate RasC activity
  in a negative feedback fashion that involves regulation of the Sca1 complex’s localization
  through phosphorylation of Sca1. PP2A seems to be necessary for the function of
  the Sca1 complex, possibly for the dynamic regulation of the complex by phosphorylation.
