caption: Proposed mechanisms underlying enteroendocrine secretion in response to T2R
  agonists. Binding of ligands to bitter taste receptors (BTRs) triggers a signaling
  cascade involving the dissociation of the G-protein gustducin into Gα and Gβγ subunits,
  activation of phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2), production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and
  inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate (IP3), and opening of the transient receptor potential
  ion channel M5 (TRPM5), thereby leading to the release of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i),
  Na+ influx, cellular depolarization and the secretion of neurotransmitters. DAG
  and [Ca2+]i also activate the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. In addition, increases
  in intracellular Gα subunit activate phosphodiesterase.
