caption: Summary of metabolic reprogramming and increased glycolysis in circulating
  leukocytes during critical illness. (1) Reduced entry into the oxidative phosphorylation.
  (2) diverting pyruvate away from oxidative phosphorylation. (3) Reduced activity
  in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. (4) Increased substrate supply to the pentose phosphate
  pathway. (5) Increased NADPH production. (6) Reduced biosynthesis. PKM2 pyruvate
  kinase 2, NADPH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, NADH nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide G-6-P glucose-6-phosphate
