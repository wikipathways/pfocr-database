caption: High glucose induces the expression of IL-1β, the upstream activator of NF-κB
  pathway and, hence, increases p-IKK/IKK in CCA cells. The activated IKK phosphorylates
  IκB resulting in the release and translocation of NF-κB transcription factor to
  the nucleus. The NF-κB activation results in the transcription of its downstream
  target including IL-1β which acts as positive feedback for the pathway stimulation
  and IL-6 which act as a signaling cytokine in a crosstalk with STAT3 pathway. Both
  NF-κB and STAT3 orchestrate and contribute to the effect of high glucose-induced
  aggressiveness of CCA. (Dash lines represent the mechanisms proven in other reports.)
