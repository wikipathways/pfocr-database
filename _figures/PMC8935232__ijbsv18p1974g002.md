caption: Schematic mechanism representation of cytolytic functions in NK cells. a)
  NK cells kill MM cells through perforin and granzymes release, death receptors activation
  and ADCC. The perforin and granzymes induce apoptotic cell death by different pathways,
  such as caspases-3/7 activation, cytochrome C release from mitochondria and IL-1β
  regulation by caspase-1. Another mechanism involves activating death receptors of
  TNFR superfamily expressed on target cells, which binds procaspase-8 after activation
  of their ligands on NK cells, allowing its activation and triggering apoptotic pathways.
  ADCC is another pathway to kill the target cells, especially when patients receive
  specific mAbs treatment. b) The cytotoxicity is dependent on the expression of activating
  and inhibitory receptors on NK cell membrane. They are engaged by specific ligands
  on target cells. The inhibitory ligands HLA-I are widely expressed on most healthy
  cells and the he inhibitory signal predominate the response in a healthy cell with
  a low quantity of activating ligands, blocking cell lysis. However, MM cells often
  downregulate HLA-I and allow effector NK cells to be activated by ITAMs in their
  cytoplasmic domains, resulting in the production of cytokines, granzyme B, and perforins
  and leading to tumor cell killing. Also, a strong capacity of ADCC is able to overcome
  these inhibitory signals.
