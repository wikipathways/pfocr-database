caption: Overview of the cholesterol synthesis pathway. The cholesterol synthesis
  pathway uses acetyl-CoA and generates isoprenoid intermediates and cholesterol.
  Sequential molecules and key enzymes are described in a schematic diagram. HMGCS1,
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1; HMGCR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase; MVK, mevalonate Kinase; PMVK, phosphomevalonate kinase; MVD, mevalonate
  diphosphate decarboxylase; IDI1, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase 1; FPPS,
  farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase; GGPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; SQS,
  squalene synthase; SQE, squalene epoxidase; LSS, lanosterol synthase; CYP51, lanosterol
  14alpha-demethylase; DHCR7, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase; DHCR24, 24-dehydrocholesterol
  reductase. Green letters indicate enzymes and orange letters indicate protein modification.
