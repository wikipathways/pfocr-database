caption: The network “Hereditary Disorder, Neurological Disease, Lipid Metabolism”
  was the most significantly altered network between socially defeated group (n =
  9) and control group (n = 8), with a score of 26. The network includes 10 out of
  the 25 metabolites uploaded on the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis reference database.
  These metabolites are functionally related and have a role in the same network centred
  on NF-κB, MAPK and AKT signaling cascade. Red indicates metabolites that were upregulated,
  while green indicates metabolites that were downregulated, in the social defeat
  group compared with the control group.
