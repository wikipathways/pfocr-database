caption: Insulin resistance in LMC metabolism, inflammation, and contractility. In
  the normal physiologic condition, insulin stimulates glucose uptake via GLUT4 translocation
  downstream of activated PI3K/Akt signaling. The cellular energy required for LMC
  contractility is produced via glycolysis and mitochondria that maintain proper lymphatic
  vessel contraction with lymphatic vascular tone. However, insulin resistance inhibits
  the PI3K/Akt pathway and impairs GLUT4 translocation to the cellular membrane. Therefore,
  less glucose is transported into the LMCs. Insulin resistance further impairs glycolysis
  and mitochondrial function, thus reducing bioenergy (i.e., ATP). Impaired LMC metabolism
  and increased MLC20 phosphorylation by insulin resistance decreases lymphatic contraction.
  On the other hand, insulin resistance selectively activates the ERK/p38MAPK/JNK
  pathway, consequently activating proinflammatory signaling.
