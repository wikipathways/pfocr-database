caption: Omics analysis of the regulatory mechanism after salt stress in soybean.
  The first part is the key DEGs identified in transcriptomics, the second part is
  the key DEPs identified in proteomics, the third part is the DEMs identified in
  metabolomics, and the fourth part is the significant changes identified in the KEGG
  metabolic pathway identified by the three omics
