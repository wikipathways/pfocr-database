caption: In the osteoblastic niche near the bone surface several stromal cells as
  well as HSC-derived cells regulate HSC function. Scf, CXCL12, and several other
  secreted factors from stromal cells, in addition to direct interactions via CAMs
  promote HSC quiescence. Wnt effectors PTPN13 and β-catenin and signals from adipocytes
  and megakaryotes including leptin and FGF-1, respectively, may promote HSC differentiation
  and expansion. In the vascular niche there is controversy over the roles of arteriolar
  and sinusoidal zones, with evidence supporting the association of both with the
  quiescent HSC niche. Endothelial cells, sympathetic nerves, Schwann cells, macrophages,
  LepR+ cells, and Nestinhigh NG2+ stromal cells all play a role in regulating HSC
  function via multiple mechanisms including Scf and CXCL12 secretion, catecholaminergic
  signaling, TGFβ, and the Notch pathway.
