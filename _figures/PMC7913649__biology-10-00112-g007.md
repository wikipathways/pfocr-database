caption: Summary graph. High PPC inhibited phenoloxidase production and melanization
  of hemolymph in silkworm; high PPC induced granulocytes to phagocytize free tissue
  fragments in hemolymph, such as dissociated fat body cells; high PPC activated the
  Toll pathway and Imd pathway in NF-κB signaling, and promoted the large expression
  of AMPs genes.
