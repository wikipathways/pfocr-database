caption: SSA exhibits protective effects across multiple organs, including the alleviation
  of inflammatory responses, preservation of organ function, reduction of oxidative
  stress, and improvement of metabolic processes. It mitigates rhinitis, brain edema,
  and inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. In cardiac protection,
  SSA acts through the suppression of TGF-β/Smad and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. For pulmonary
  inflammation, it reduces symptoms by inhibiting the NF-κB/Nrf2 signaling pathway.
  In liver inflammation, SSA similarly alleviates symptoms via NF-κB inhibition. It
  protects the pancreas by reducing oxidative stress and improving lipid metabolism,
  thereby minimizing pancreatic damage. In cases of renal dysfunction, SSA decreases
  inflammatory factors such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10. It also alleviates endometrial
  inflammation by suppressing inflammatory cytokines and reduces colitis symptoms
  through its antioxidant properties and inhibition of TNF-α and IL-1β
