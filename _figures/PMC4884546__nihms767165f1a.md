caption: Depicted is the initial recognition event in the formation of an immunological
  synapse between T cells and TAA-expressing target cells, mediated by T cell redirecting
  BsAb. (A) Main interactions in the recognition event involving na誰ve T cells. A
  T cell redirecting BsAb (anti-TAA/anti-CD3) binds to CD3 on T cells and to TAA expressed
  on the cell surface of target cells, leading to immunological synapse formation.
  This results in activation of polyclonal T cells in a non-MHC-restricted fashion
  in the presence of appropriate costimulatory signaling. The costimulatory signal
  is transmitted upon binding of costimulatory receptors (CD28, OX-40, 4-1BB etc)
  to their cognate ligands (B7-1, B7-2, OX-40, 4-1BBL etc). Antibodies (anti-CD28,
  anti-4-1BB etc) may also facilitate activation of T cells by triggering costimulatory
  receptors. The two signals transmitted through CD3 and costimulatory receptors facilitate
  activation of T cells with their subsequent degranulation and release of perforin
  and granzyme, leading to target cell apoptosis. In addition to costimulatory receptors
  T cells also express inhibitory receptors (CTLA4, PD-1, etc), which when bound to
  their ligands (B7-1, B7-2, PD-L1, etc) on target cells inhibit activation of T cells.
  Non-activating antibodies, which bind to either coinhibitory receptors (anti-CTLA4,
  anti-PD-1) or to their cognate ligands (anti-PD-L1), can block inhibitory signaling
  on T cells. (B) Main interactions in the recognition event leading to the formation
  of an immunological synapse involving antigen-experienced (memory) T cells. The
  immunological synapse formed via memory T cells is similar to that of na誰ve T cells
  except that the former cells have already been activated previously and only require
  stimulation via the CD3 signaling pathway to elicit a cytotoxic response. Effector
  memory cells are major contributors to the anti-tumor activity exhibited by BiTE
  antibodies.
