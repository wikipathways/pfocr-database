caption: 'The regulatory role of posttranslational modifications in the activation
  of RIPK1. RIPK1 possesses a structured hierarchy: an N-terminal kinase domain (KD),
  an intermediate domain (ID), and a carboxyl-terminal Death Domain (DD). The KD,
  pivotal for RIPK1’s function, achieves self-activation through self-phosphorylation.
  Interestingly, Caspase cleavage at D324 severs the connection between KD and DD,
  effectively thwarting RIPK1 activation. In its activation journey, RIPK1 undergoes
  self-phosphorylation at sites like S14, S15, and S166. Yet, phosphorylation at particular
  kinase domain sites, such as S25, S189, S321, and S320 by regulators like IKKs,
  TBK1, TAK1, and MK2, serves as a countermeasure, inhibiting its kinase activity
  and stalling necroptosis. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, pellino 1 (PELI1), plays a special
  role: it ubiquitinates K115 within the KD of an activated RIPK1, which aids in the
  assembly of complex IIb, thereby promoting necroptosis. Moreover, the interaction
  of RHIM motifs present within the ID of RIPK1 and RIPK3 acts as a conduit for necroptotic
  and inflammatory signaling. But, it’s not all pro-necroptosis; the ubiquitination
  of multiple sites in RIPK1’s ID aids in the transmission of the NF-κB signal, acting
  as a necroptosis deterrent. Here, K377 stands out, serving as a nexus point for
  E3 ubiquitin ligases like IAP1, IAP2, and parkin. Once ubiquitinated, K377 becomes
  an anchor, attracting activators such as TAB1/2 and NEMO of TAK1. This recruitment
  ultimately leads to a cascade activation of TAK1, IKK, and MK2. These entities,
  once activated, reciprocate by exerting inhibitory phosphorylation on RIPK1. In
  the realm of DD, RIPK1 interacts to form homologous dimers with partners like TNFR1,
  TRADD, and FADD, which act as triggers for KD activation. CYLD, brought into play
  by the LUBAC, serves dual purposes: it facilitates necrotic body formation by stripping
  K63 and M1 ubiquitin chains, and paradoxically, impedes the NF-κB signaling, enhancing
  necroptosis. Meanwhile, A20 is versatile. As a K63 ubiquitinase, it escalates necroptosis
  by firing up RIPK1 and RIPK3. Yet, it’s also a proficient ubiquitin ligase, marking
  RIPK1 for proteasomal disposal and thus modulating RIPK1-driven necroptosis. The
  narrative doesn’t end here; PELI1, OPTN, Parkin, and ABIN-1 each play their parts,
  influencing the NF-κB signaling pathway and subsequently the fate of RIPK1-mediated
  cell death. Created in BioRender.com. Shi, Z. (2025) https://BioRender.com/l77i832'
