caption: A model illustrating quercetin protects PDLCs against OS via activation of
  the NRF2 signaling pathway. The ability of proliferate and osteogenic differentiation
  in PDLCs are impaired under OS. In addition, increased ROS can also damage the DNA
  double strands and induce cellular senescence through the p53/p21 signaling pathway.
  Moreover, quercetin protects PDLCs against OS, through increasing the expression
  and nuclear localization of NRF2, which combines with antioxidant response element
  (ARE) to promote the expression of antioxidant enzymes or substances such as HO-1,NQO-1,
  GPx3, CAT and SOD.
