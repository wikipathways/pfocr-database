caption: 'FAK signaling pathways in cancer. Integrins, cytokine receptors (CR), growth
  factor receptors (GFR), and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are cell-surface
  transmembrane receptors that relay extracellular signals to FAK. FAK activation
  triggers subsequent signaling cascades in various cell processes: survival signaling,
  growth, angiogenesis, migration, and invasion. In cancers, FAK is overexpressed
  and activated and it is likely that the FAK signaling pathway is deregulated in
  cancer cells. FAK functions in both kinase-dependent and -independent manners. Kinase-inhibited
  FAK goes to the nucleus and potentially regulates gene expression to affect cancer
  progression.'
