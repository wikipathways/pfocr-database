caption: Regulatory mechanism underlying hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis
  and cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) in the development of sepsis. In
  the pathogenesis of sepsis, the HPA axis is activated via the vagus nerve or the
  humoral pathway, and the hypothalamus and pituitary gland release corticotropin-releasing
  hormone (CRH) as well as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Then, it can augment
  the production of glucocorticoids (GCs) released by adrenal cortical cells and inhibit
  excessive inflammation, which may alleviate the sepsis-induced CNS inflammation.
  However, severe sepsis can result in damage to the HPA axis and the abnormal induction
  of GC, thereby contributing to immunosuppression and intractable inflammation of
  the CNS. Of note, the constant brain damage aggravates the abnormality of the HPA
  axis and forms a vicious cycle under septic exposure. In addition, the activated
  splenic nerve can release norepinephrine (NP), which binds to the adrenaline receptor
  (ADR) on immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages
  to produce ACh. ACh binds to α7 nAChR on the inflammatory cells and suppresses the
  inflammatory response in the spleen. Nevertheless, the persistent activation of
  the vagus nerve may lead to the development of host immune suppression following
  septic insults.
