caption: Dynamically asserted instances of interactions. Rectangles are owl classes
  corresponding to intension. Circles are owl instances corresponding to molecular
  events and attribute. Detected drug interactions were hypothetically asserted as
  owl instances (dotted circles) along with hasSubprocess properties (dotted and dashed
  edges).
