caption: Glucose is taken up into the cell by glucose transporters (GLUT) and phosphorylated
  by hexokinases HK1 and HK2. Glucose 6-phosphate (P) and its downstream intermediates
  can either be converted to pyruvate or fuel biosynthesis through the hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), via glycerol 3-P production
  or via serine biosynthesis pathways. Hexosamine has a key role in glycosylation.
  The PPP provides ribose 5-P for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH. Glycerol 3-P provides
  the backbone for lipid synthesis. Serine biosynthesis has a key part in amino acid
  metabolism and nucleotide metabolism through control of one-carbon (1C) metabolism
  (see Fig. ). Pyruvate can either enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as acetyl-CoA
  through the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase, be
  converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and exported through the monocarboxylate
  transporter (MCT) or be converted to alanine via glutamic–pyruvic transaminase (GPT).
  Inhibitors (blue) and activators (purple) of key enzymes (red) or transporters (white)
  are shown. In addition to producing energy by contributing reducing equivalents
  to the electron transport chain, the TCA cycle is an important source of aspartate
  for nucleotide metabolism (see Fig. ). The conversion of pyruvate to lactate has
  a key role in maintaining cellular NAD+ to NADH ratios. aKG, α-ketoglutarate; OAA,
