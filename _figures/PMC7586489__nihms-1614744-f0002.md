caption: BER of an abasic site in the CAG repeats is initiated by APE1 incision, leaving
  an ssDNA break. This subsequently leads to the formation of CAG repeat hairpins
  and a multi-nucleotide gap on the damaged or the template strand. Pol β performs
  multi-nucleotide gap-filling synthesis to fill the gap on the damaged strand. FEN1
  use its alternate flap cleavage activity to process the 5’-end of a short flap attached
  to the CAG hairpin, leaving a ligatable nicked hairpin that is sealed by LIG I resulting
  in CAG repeat expansion (the pathway on the left) (). In a scenario where a hairpin
  forms on the template strand, pol β skips over the template hairpin and displaces
  the downstream repeat into a flap that is cleaved by FEN1 causing repeat deletion
  (the pathway on the right) (). The BER cofactor, PCNA can interact with LIG I to
  stimulate ligation across a small template hairpin (the pathway on the right), thereby
  promoting repeat deletions ().
