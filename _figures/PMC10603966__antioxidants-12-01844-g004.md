caption: 'Graphical representation of the proposed model. (1) During hypoxia, adenosine
  release inhibits glutamatergic transmission via its A1 receptors. (2) Uptake of
  non-excitatory amino acids by glial cells (via transporters such as those of the
  N-system and ASCT2) leads to an increase in cell volume. The activation of volume-regulated
  anion channels (VRAC) releases excitotoxins (such as glutamate, aspartate, and D-serine)
  into the already reduced extracellular space. This glutamate is in addition to glutamate
  released by other pathways during ischemia (synaptic glutamate, reversal of its
  transporters, etc.). (3) Glutamate and D-serine released into the reduced interstitial
  space leads to a progressive increase in their extracellular concentration and the
  activation of NMDA receptors, triggering excitotoxicity phenomena that result in
  increased cell volume and dendritic beading. Glu: glutamate, Gln: glutamine, D-Ser:
  D-serine, AA: other amino acids. Image designed with BioRender.com.'
