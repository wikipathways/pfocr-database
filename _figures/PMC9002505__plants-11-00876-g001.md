caption: 'Heterotrimeric G protein signaling in plant drought and salinity stress
  (Created with BioRender.com on 17/03/2022). Gα deficiency inhibits Ca2+ channel
  activation and ROS production due to disruption of ABA signaling. Gα acts downstream
  of S1P to regulate stomatal closure by modulating inward K+ channels and slow anion
  channels. PA and PLDα1 interact with Gα to mediate ABA inhibition of stomatal opening.
  Binding of PA to Rboh at the N-terminal cytoplasmic region results in the production
  of ROS. Stomatal regulation by the RALF-FER pathway is associated with Gβ. Gα participates
  in ExtCaM-induced stomatal closure of guard cells by regulating NO synthesis, and
  NO synthesis is dependent on H2O2 produced by NADPH oxidases through the action
  of the nitrate reductase Nia1. BR induces the expression of ACS5 and ACS9 to initiate
  ethylene synthesis, which signals through Gα to synthesize H2O2 and before the nitric
  synthase NOA1 induces the production of NO. Several groups have proven the involvement
  of Gα in salt stress although the results are contradictory with positive as well
  as negative roles being proposed for this subunit. Gβ regulates the combination
  of osmotic and ionic stresses during salt stress by increasing levels of proteins
  involved in ROS detoxification and osmoprotectant compounds. SphK: sphingosine kinase;
  RALF1: rapid alkalinization factor 1; FER: receptor-like kinase FERONIA; S1P: sphingosine-1-phosphate;
