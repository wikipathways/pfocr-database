caption: The expression of SNL1 and SNL2 increases gradually during embryo development
  and seed maturation causing a decrease in acetylation level of ABA hydrolysis genes
  (CYP707A1 and CYP707A2) and some ethylene pathway genes (ACO1 and ACO4). This promotes
  ABA signalling and represses ethylene signalling leading to the establishment of
  seed dormancy. During imbibition of after-ripened seeds, the expression of SNL1
  and SNL2 declines, causing an increase in acetylation levels of auxin pathway genes
  (for example, AUX1). Subsequent activation of their transcription leads to increased
  auxin levels and signalling, followed by enhanced cell division promoting seed germination.
