caption: 'CD138 molecular structure and role in the microenvironment. (A) Schematic
  representation of the molecular structure of CD138. Details on each domain are provided
  in the text. (B) CD138 has various roles in the MM microenvironment: (I) it interacts
  with various extracellular matrix, proteins such as laminin and fibronectin, and
  promotes adhesion and migration. (II) It acts as a co-receptor in various interactions,
  stabilizes multicomplex formation between GF receptor and α4β1 integrin, and activates
  pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. (III) Its extracellular domain
  can be cleaved by proteases and released in the extracellular environment, (IV)
  also acting as a co-receptor on other cells and activating paracrine signaling.
  (V) With the transmembrane domain, CD138 activates various factors, including those
  involved in exosome biogenesis. (VI) On endothelial cells, it facilitates the interaction
  between VEGF and VEGFR2, leading to activation of the angiogenic signaling pathway.'
