caption: 'After radiation exposure, excessive production of ROS in cells leads to
  oxidative stress and inflammation, resulting in cell damage. DNA damage in the nucleus
  and mitochondria can aggravate cell damage by activating cGAS-STING signal pathway.
  Cellular DNA damage response can participate in the occurrence and development of
  RILI by regulating the expression of specific miRNA and inducing cell senescence.
  DDR: DNA damage response; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; SASP: senescence-associated
  secretory phenotype; EVs: extracellular vesicles.'
