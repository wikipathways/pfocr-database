caption: 'Hypoxia signalling pathway: (A) Under normoxic conditions HIF-α is hydroxylated
  by prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs), allowing the interaction between HIF-α
  and the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). Consequently, pVHL will recruit an E3
  ubiquitin ligase complex that will target HIF-α for proteasomal degradation. (B)
  Under hypoxic conditions however, the hydroxylation reaction does not take place
  and HIF-α is now free to translocate into the nucleus and associate with HIF-1β
  and coactivator p300/CBP, forming a heterodimeric transcription complex. Binding
  of this HIF-α/β complex to hypoxia response elements (HREs) will result in the upregulation
  of HIF target genes, regulating various cellular processes such as angiogenesis
  (VEGF and ANG-1/2), invasiveness (Vimentin), metabolism (CA9 and GLUT-1/3) and immunity
  (TGF-β and PD-L1).'
