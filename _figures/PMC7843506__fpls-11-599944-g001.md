caption: Proposed model for CBL10 function. CBL10 functions as a crucial regulator
  in Na+ homeostasis under salt stress conditions, interacting with CIPK24 (SOS2)
  and CIPK8, and activating SOS1 pathway at plasma membrane for Na+ extrusion to apoplast
  and may be interacting with vacuolar H+ pumps (AVP1, VHA) facilitating Na+ sequestration
  into the vacuole. CBL10 also plays a key role in Ca2+ homeostasis, which in turn
  hints at this Ca2+ -sensor protein as a key master regulator of stress signaling
  in plants, involved in generation and fine tuning of Ca2+ signatures in the cytoplasm,
  through the coordination of different Ca2+ channels at different cellular localizations,
  such as plasma membrane (AtANN4) and probably tonoplast (TPC1), as well as in the
  cross-talk between Ca2+ and ROS, through regulation of RBOHs activity, for a rapid
  long-distance transmission of signals. CBL10 seems also to be involved in mobilizing
  Ca2+ stored in vacuole toward demanding tissues to compensate for Ca2+ deficiency
  caused by salinity and thus allowing development of the meristem and reproductive
  organs. Finally, functions of CBL10 in root have been associated with K+ uptake
  by negative regulation of AKT1 channel. Green arrows indicate activation by phosphorylation;
  red line indicates repression by direct interaction; gray arrows indicate activation
  by Ca2+, and question mark indicates hypothesized signaling processes that have
  not been verified yet.
