caption: Key signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of CCM. CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 encode
  proteins that form the CCM protein complex, which plays a critical role in vascular
  stability. The complex's upstream regulation is influenced by the interaction with
  LPS through binding to TLR4 and CD14. In familial CCM, loss‐of‐function mutations
  in the CCM gene deregulate the inhibitory effect on downstream RhoA, which in turn
  activates the RhoA–ROCK signaling pathway and promotes cell migration, deletion
  of intercellular junctions, and stress fiber formation. Moreover, loss‐of‐function
  mutations in the CCM genes or somatic gain‐of‐function mutations in the MAP3K3 gene
  activate the MAP3K3–KLF2/4 signaling pathway, which drives EndMT, angiogenesis,
  and oxidative stress. In addition, somatic gain‐of‐function mutations in PIK3CA
  lead to activation of the PI3K–AKT signaling pathway, resulting in abnormal cell
  proliferation, increased inflammation, and impaired autophagy
