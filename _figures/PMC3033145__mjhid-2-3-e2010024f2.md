caption: Anticoagulant properties of endothelial cells. Heparan-sulphate (HS) is expressed
  on the endothelial surface and accelerates the interaction between antithrombin
  (AT) and its target enzymes, among which factor Xa and thrombin (IIa). Thrombomodulin
  (TM) and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) are also membrane proteins and are
  involved in protein C (PC) activation. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and
  protein S (PS) are released into blood. TFPI, after combining with factor Xa, binds
  to and neutralizes the TF/VIIa complex on cell surfaces. Protein S is the cofactor
  of activated protein C (APC) which degrades factors Va and VIIIa. Micro-organisms
  and inflammatory mediators down-regulate the anticoagulant properties of the endothelium
  in different ways (see text).
