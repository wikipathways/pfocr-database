caption: Possible mechanisms for neuroprotective function of exercise and differences
  between sexes. DDIT4, a gene which is associated with promotion of neuroal atrophy
  and blocks mTOR signaling pathway to neural plasticity, was down-regulated through
  exercise, more so in men than in women (in luteal phase). Conversely, KMO, a pivotal
  enzyme of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, associated with induction
  of depression, was down-regulated in women only. Growth factors VEGFA, IGF1R, and
  IGF2R were also induced by exercise with minor differences between sexes. Finally,
  FGD4 mRNA, a myelination inducing gene, was significantly enhanced by exercise in
  both sexes with men showing more pronounced regulation. Overall, the observed gene
  expression regulations may be interpretable as neuroprotective effects of exercise
