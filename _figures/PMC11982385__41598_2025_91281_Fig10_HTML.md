caption: Schematic diagram of phenylalanine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, glycine,
  serine and threonine metabolism, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), alanine, aspartate and
  glutamate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway,
  and their relevant differential metabolite alterations during DKD occuration. The
  upregulated metabolites in the DKD group were labeled with red and downregulated
  metabolites in the DKD group with blue
