caption: Metabolites, metabolic pathways and related metabolic genes that work in
  autophagy. mTORC is an important negative regulator of autophagy, and many factors
  promote autophagy by inhibiting mTORC. Rasfonin regulates autophagy both through
  AKT and mTORC. Amino acid deprivation inhibits mTORC through p27, its combination
  with LAMTOR in turn accelerates autophagy. Hexokinase II can inhibit mTORC, thus
  promoting autophagy. AMPK can also inhibit mTORC under the regulation of lncRNA
  DRAIC. Under low energy state stimulation of AMPK can promote autophagy. The STK11/LKB1-AMPK
  axis also exerts a pro-autophagic effect by affecting AMPK. Glucose deprivation
  promotes nuclear translocation of GAPDH and binding to SITR1 via AMPK, which in
  turn promotes autophagy. The red boxes represent negative regulators and the green
  boxes represent positive regulators
