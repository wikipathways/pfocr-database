caption: The cyclic GAMP synthase (cGAS) binds cytosolic DNA derived from the nucleus,
  mitochondria and pathogens such as viruses and bacteria to produce cGAMP from ATP
  and GTP. Cells also harbor DNases such as TREX1 and others which eliminate cytosolic
  DNAs to prevent activation of cGAS-STING as part of a homeostatic mechanism. cGAMP
  initiates the signaling cascade by binding to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident
  adaptor protein STING, which translocates to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment
  (ERGIC) and to the Golgi apparatus, where it binds the TANK binding kinase (TBK1),
  which phosphorylates the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). IRF3 translocates
  to the nucleus and transcribes interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). TBK1 also activates
  inhibitor of nuclear factor β kinase (IKK), which in turn phosphorylates IκBα, which
  relieves inhibition of NF-κB (comprising the p65 and p50 subunits). NF-κB moves
  into the nucleus and transcribes its target genes. Together, the cytokines and interferons
  produced mount an immune response against the pathogenic entity.
