caption: The proposed paracrine and juxtracrine actions of the oviductal cells-derived
  extracellular vesicles (OC-EVs) on the oocyte, sperms, embryos, and the oviduct
  cells. OC-EVs can mediate cargo transfer to the cells, such as the MAPK/ERK pathway,
  actin, and cofilin, for oocyte maturation and meiosis. Metabolic enzymes such as
  protein kinase (PK) and GAPDH can affect sperm metabolism as well. Moreover, some
  other proteins such as HSP90 and endoplasmic reticulum-related proteins can affect
  early preimplantation embryo development.
