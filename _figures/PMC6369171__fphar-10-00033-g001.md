caption: 'Schematic representation of Nrf2 signaling in homeostasis and a deregulated
  environment. (A) Oxidative molecules (e.g., ROS and RNS) produced by cellular respiration
  or neurotransmission activate the protective antioxidant pathway by dissociation
  of the Nrf2/KEAP1 complex. When dissociated from the cytosolic protein KEAP1, Nrf2
  translocates to the cell nucleus, triggering the expression of several homeostatic
  genes with the ARE sequence in their promoters, including GPx, SOD, HO-1, GST, and
  CAT. When inactivated, Nrf2 is sequestered by KEAP1 and targeted for ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation. (B) Altered homeostasis promotes excessive ROS/RNS
  production that can activate glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) that release
  proinflammatory and danger molecules patterns, which disrupts neuronal communication
  and the nature of glial activities. Green arrows represent activation and truncated
  red lines, inhibition (abbreviations: ACh, acetylcoline; DA, dopamine; CAT, catalase;
  Glu, glutamate; GPx, Glutathione Peroxidase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HO-1,
  heme oxigenase 1; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  SOD, superoxide dismutase; Ub, ubiquitin; ATP, adenosine triphosphate).'
