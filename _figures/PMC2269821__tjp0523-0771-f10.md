caption: Illumination of the centre receptive field of an AII cell produces an on-centre
  responses via the rod → rod bipolar cell → AII amacrine cell pathway (large circle).
  Illumination of the surround receptive field produces an off-surround response by
  the pathway rod → rod bipolar cell → S1 amacrine cell (small circle) which carries
  the signal centrally and feeds back via a GABAergic inhibitory (sign inverting)
  synapse to central rod bipolar cell axon terminals (large circle). Activation of
  this ‘surround-generating’ circuit shunts the signal in the rod bipolar cell axon
  terminal thereby reducing the glutamate release onto AII cells and producing the
  hyperpolarizing off-response. An alternative, but less likely, pathway for surround
  inhibition may be from unidentified amacrine cells (?) which provide direct inhibitory
  inputs onto AII amacrine cell dendrites. Asterisks, gap junctions; filled arrowheads,
  sign-conserving synapse; open arrowheads, sign-inverting synapse; AII, AII amacrine
  cell; RB, rod bipolar cell; S1, S1 amacrine cell; ON, on-centre.
