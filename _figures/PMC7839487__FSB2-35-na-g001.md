caption: Intermediate filaments cross talk with different signaling pathways. A, The
  Notch signaling pathway is activated when a Notch ligand on a contacting cell binds
  to the Notch receptor. This initiates trans‐endocytosis of the ligand‐receptor complex
  and generates a pulling force, leading to proteolytic processing of the Notch receptor
  and release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates to the nucleus
  and interacts with the transcriptional regulator CSL (CBF‐1, Suppressor of Hairless,
  Lag1) activating transcription of target genes. B, Wnt signaling is activated as
  soluble Wnt molecules bind to the Frizzled and LRP receptors. Frizzled recruits
  Dishevelled and inhibits the formation of degradation complex consisting of GSK‐3β,
  CK1, APC, and Axin, allowing β‐Catenin to translocate to the nucleus and bind TCF/LEF
  initiating transcription of target genes. In the absence of a Wnt signal, GSK‐3β,
  CK1, APC, and Axin forms a degradation complex that phosphorylates β‐Catenin. This
  phosphorylation targets β‐Catenin for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
  C, TGFβ initiates assembly of a tetrameric receptor complex (two copies of both
  TGFβRI and TGFβRII) at the cell membrane, followed by receptor phosphorylation and
  activation of the receptor kinase domain. Thereby the TGFβ receptor complex further
  phosphorylates Smad proteins, which subsequently form dimers and recruit Smad4.
  The formed Smad complex is transferred into the nucleus to control the transcription
  of target genes. D, The Hippo signaling pathway is made up of a kinase cascade where
  MST1/2 kinases (denoted Hippo in Drosophila melanogaster) and SAV1 form a complex
  to phosphorylate and activate LATS. LATS forms a complex with MOB1 to further phosphorylate
  and inhibit the function of the transcriptional activator YAP/TAZ (eg, through degradation
  or interaction with other proteins such as 14‐3‐3). Non‐phosphorylated YAP/TAZ enters
  the nucleus and binds TEAD transcription factors initiating expression of target
  genes. E, Overview of the interaction between signaling pathways and intermediate
