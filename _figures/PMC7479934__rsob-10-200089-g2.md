caption: Protein translocation. (a) Diagram depicting post-translational translocation
  into the ER. The polypeptide chain is fully synthesized and dissociated from the
  ribosome but kept in a partially folded state by cytosolic chaperones (not shown
  to scale). The nascent chain interacts with the membrane bound Sec61-62-63 complex
  which facilitates its translocation into ER lumen. The driving force for polypeptide
  insertion comes from BiP. Initially, BiP is attached to Sec63. As the polypeptide
  chain translocates through the channel, BiP binds to the nascent chain causing its
  release from Sec63. This serves to increase its entropy as it moves away from the
  constraints of the membrane. (b) Protein translocation into the mitochondrial matrix.
  A simplified diagram illustrating the pre-sequence pathway for protein insertion
  in the matrix. Newly synthesized polypeptides attach to cytosolic chaperones that
  interact firstly with the TOM translocase complex and subsequently with TIM23 complex.
  Integral membrane proteins usually engage a different translocase complex within
  the inner membrane (TIM22) (not shown). Also, TIM23 complex can transfer proteins
  laterally into the membrane depending on certain cues within the polypeptide sequence.
  The PAM motor helps drive the pre-sequence polypeptide into the matrix by entropic
  pulling of the nascent chain by mtHsp70. The key PAM components, mtHsp70 (yellow),
  Tim44 (pink) and Pam18 (light brown) are shown connected to the channel forming
  components Tim17-Tim23 (green - blue).
