caption: 'The effect by targeting inhibition of USP14 on anti-tumor immune response:
  A Inhibit inflammatory response to infection by suppressing CXCL12-mediated CXCL4
  de-ubiquitination, reduce CBP abundance and attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated
  TNF‐α and IL‐6 release. B Reverse immune tolerance through decreasing IDO1 protein
  levels and kynurenine (KYN)/ tryptophan (TRP) ratio, and sensitize tumor cells to
  anti-PD1 therapy by upregulating PD-1 expression and increasing CD8 + T cells infiltration.
  C. Delay tumor growth, enhance survival of tumor cells, and sensitize tumor cells
  to TNFα-mediated cell death, as well as radiation-induced cell death by inhibiting
  NFκB activity and preventing IκBα degradation, which is a critical inhibitor of
  the canonical NFκB pathway. D Suppress M2-type macrophages polarization by inhibiting
  SIRT1/PGC1-a-mediated fatty acid oxidation in macrophages'
