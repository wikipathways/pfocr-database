caption: Networks generated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the expression signature.
  A network is a graphical representation of the molecular relationships between genes
  and gene products. Genes or gene products are represented as nodes, and the biological
  relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line). Red and green nodes
  represent genes positively and negatively correlated genes with the phenotypic categories
  in the signature, respectively. Solid lines represent protein–protein interactions;
  dashed lines represent regulatory relationships. All lines are supported by at least
  one reference from the literature, from a textbook, or from canonical information
  stored in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base.
