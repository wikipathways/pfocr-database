caption: A) In renal disease, very high levels of FGF23 are produced by bone cells,
  resulting in blood levels of FGF23 that can be up to 1,000 times greater than normal.
  The mechanism by which these very high levels are produced is not known. A “renal”
  factor possibly exists, which may or may not be produced by the kidney, and which
  contributes to the high levels produce in renal disease. B) In a rodent model, there
  is a single report that at the very high levels seen in renal failure, FGF23 has
  been shown to act directly on cardiac myocytes by binding to FGFR4 in a Klotho-independent
  manner via the phospholipase C/calcineurin pathway. C) FGF23 production by bone
  cells probably occurs under the stimulation of hyperphosphatemia and the administration
  of 1,25-D that is common in patients with renal failure. However, this alone is
  not enough to account for the changes that are seen, as FGF23 begins to rise even
  before blood phosphorus levels rise. There is even a period during which blood phosphorus
  levels decrease below baseline as FGF23 rises, suggesting that high phosphorus alone
  is not necessary the primary stimulus. All of this suggests there is physiology
  involved in the regulation of FGF23 that is unique to renal disease, termed here
  as a “renal factor.” D) It appears that virtually all the FGF23 seen in the circulation
  in renal failure is intact FGF23, suggesting that there is little if any processing
  of intact FGF23 to the C- or N-terminal products. Processing may be inhibited by
  hyperphosphatemia or an as yet unidentified renal factor pathway.
