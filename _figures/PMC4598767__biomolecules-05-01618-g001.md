caption: TLR Signaling and NF-κB activation. Stimulation of TLRs trigger the association
  of The Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1)-receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adaptor molecule
  MyD88 which mediates the TLR-signaling pathway leading to the activation of the
  IKK complex, which consists of IKK-α, IKK-β and IKK-ɣ (also known as IKK1, IKK2
  and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) essential modulator, NEMO, respectively). This pathway
  is used by TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7 and TLR9 and degradation of the phosphorylated
  IκB by the ubiquitin proteasome system allows the translocation of NF-κB to the
  nucleus where it activates the expression of cytokine genes (Il6, Tnf, etc.). Another
  TIR-domain-containing adaptor, TRIF, is essential for the MyD88-independent pathway.
  The non-typical IKKs IKK-ε and TBK1 mediate phosphorylation of IRF3/7 downstream
  of TRIF. This phosphorylated IRF3/7 translocates into the nucleus to induce expression
  of type I IFN and IFN inducible genes (Ifnb, Cxcl10, etc.).
