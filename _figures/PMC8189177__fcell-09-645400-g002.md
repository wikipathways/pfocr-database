caption: The role of FGF10-FGFR2B signaling in lipofibroblast (LIF)-AT2 mediated alveolar
  repair and fibrosis development/resolution. (A). During embryonic lung development,
  a subset of FGF10-expressing cells in the lung mesenchyme gives rise to LIFs, which
  are considered to be essential components of AT2 stem cell niches. AT2 cells and
  neighboring LIFs interact reciprocally via paracrine signaling pathways, such as
  the PPAR-γ pathway, in coordinating normal development, homeostasis, and regeneration/repair
  of the distal lung. Apart from other reserve stem cell populations for the alveolar
  epithelium, AT2 cells are important progenitors during repair after lung injury
  and during normal lung homeostasis. (B) The origins of activated myofibroblasts
  (MYF) in fibrotic lungs remain speculative; however, FGF10-expressing LIFs have
  been implicated as a novel source of the activated myofibroblasts. Following bleomycin-induced
  injury, lipofibroblasts are thought to transdifferentiate into activated myofibroblasts,
  from which a subpopulation reverts to a quiescent phenotype characteristic of the
  pre-existing LIFs during fibrosis resolution.
