caption: The S-Locus Genes of Crucifers, Receptor–Ligand Interactions, and Signal
  Transduction in the SI Response.(A) Arrangement of SI genes in the Brassica S8 haplotype
  and structures of their protein products. Arrows above the genes indicate the 5′→3′
  orientations of the genes. The extracellular S domains are shown in red, and the
  kinase domain of SRK is shown in yellow. White bars in the S domains represent 12
  conserved Cys residues, and circles indicate glycosylation sites. Black and gray
  boxes represent the signal sequences in SRK/SLG and SCR, respectively. The blue
  box represents the SRK transmembrane domain.(B) A model of signal perception and
  response in the SI response. Molecules that have been shown conclusively to function
  in SI are shown as closed shapes. SRK is shown spanning the plasma membrane (orange
  bar) of the stigmatic epidermal cell, with its kinase (red circle) in the cytoplasm
  and its ectodomain (red crescent) extending into the cell wall (stippled area).
  SLG and eSRK are shown as crescents in the papillar cell wall. SCR molecules are
  shown as dimeric molecules in the papillar cell wall, to which they are transferred
  from the pollen coat of pollen. “Self” SCR (green circles) interacts with the SRK
  ectodomain and triggers a signaling cascade, whereas “nonself” SCR (purple triangles)
  does not. ARC1 is shown by a gray box, with red bars indicating arm repeats and
  a yellow bar indicating the U box. Phosphorylation is indicated by “P” enclosed
  by a circle. Less-well-defined associations are indicated by a question mark and
  patterned shape. Thioredoxins (THX) are shown by stippled turquoise boxes that are
  associated with the SRK kinase domain only in the absence of ligand, although the
  mode of its interaction with SRK activation is not understood. An inhibitor of SI
  (stippled blue polygon) is drawn as a possible target for ubiquitination. The possible
  involvement of additional SRK substrates is shown by a brown striped half-circle
  associated with the activated SRK kinase domain. The black arrows and question marks
  indicate unknown components of the SI signal transduction pathway, which is likely
  to terminate with the modification of the papillar cell membrane or wall at the
  site of contact with self pollen.(C) Mutations that lead to loss of the SI response
  in stigmas. The diagram shows mutations in SRK, ARC1, and SLG and their consequences.eSRK,
  soluble form of the SRK ectodomain; SCR, S-locus Cys-rich protein; SLG, S-locus
  glycoprotein; SRK, S-locus receptor protein kinase.
