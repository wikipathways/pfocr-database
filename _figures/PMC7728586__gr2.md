caption: . H2S inhibits insulin secretion and regulates apoptosis of islet β cells.
  H2S inhibits insulin secretion from islet β cells through stimulating of KATP channels,
  inactivating VDCC and suppressing glucose metabolism. H2S promotes islet β cell
  apoptosis through phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and subsequent enhances ER stress.
  H2S inhibits islet β cell apoptosis through reducing thioredoxin binding protein-2
  expression, inhibiting reactive oxygen species production and activating Akt signaling
  pathway. + indicates increase, − indicates inhibition.
