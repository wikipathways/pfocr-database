caption: 'Mechanism of immunostimulation within shrimp body: the PAMP located on immunostimulants
  (IM) is recognized by PRP located on the hemocyte. This pattern recognition between
  IM and hemocyte activates the cascade of cellular signals that brings the shrimp’s
  body into a state of elevated immune response. When a pathogen enters shrimp’s body
  in such a state of aggravated immune response, then the PAMP of pathogen gets recognized
  by PRP of hemocyte, to cause phagocytosis, encapsulation, melanization, and nodule
  formation of the pathogen. All these immunological responses altogether eventually
  kill and decompose the pathogen'
