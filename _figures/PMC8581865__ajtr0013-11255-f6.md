caption: Hippo signaling pathway. The Hippo/YAP pathway was mainly mediated by the
  phosphorylation levels of multiple key proteins. As shown in the figure above, when
  the Hippo pathway is “OFF”, the translocation of non-phosphorylated YAP binds to
  the transcription factor TEADs1-4 to form a transcription complex, which activates
  the target genes including Pik3cb, promoting cell proliferation and differentiation.
  When the Hippo pathway is “ON”, MST1/2 (mammalian sterile20-like kinase 1/2) is
  initially phosphorylated, which activates LATS1/2 and MOB1 (mps one binder kinaseactivator-like1),
  and further promotes YAP phosphorylation. Finally, the phosphorylated YAP is modified
  by ubiquitination and degraded in the cytoplasms.
