caption: A model for E2-ERβ action. ERβ is localized at the perimemebrane/cytoplasm,
  but is primarily located in the nucleus. The binding of 17β-estradiol (E2), as the
  main circulating estrogen hormone, to ERβ induces conformational changes in the
  receptor that facilitate protein-protein interactions. The perimembrane/cytoplasmic
  E2-ERβ complex interacts with effector proteins (EP) to initiate signal transduction
  cascades that result in the activation of various kinases (K). Kinases then modulate
  the activities of transcription factors (TF) bound to cognate response elements
  (RE) to mediate transcription. Upon binding to E2 the nuclear ERβ interacts with
  estrogen responsive elements (EREs) on DNA, and recruits co-regulatory proteins
  to alter the expression of the estrogen responsive genes (the ERE-dependent E2-ERβ
  signaling pathway). The nuclear E2-ERβ also regulates the expression of the responsive
  gene transcription by functional interactions with transcription factors bound to
  cognate response elements (the ERE-independent E2-ERβ signaling pathway). Activated
  kinases could also influence the activity of the E2-ERβ complex through post-translational
  modifications of the complex or associated co-regulatory proteins. The expression
  of the responsive genes results in the cellular responses.
