caption: Mechanism of the redox cycle and the redox-relay of typical 2-Cys Prdxs (shown
  family members are the cytosolic human Prdx1 and Prdx2). Prdx scavenges H2O2through
  the formation of a sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) on the peroxidatic cysteine (CysP) with
  the subsequent formation of a disulfide bond between CysPand the resolving cysteine
  (CysR) []. Prdx is recycled via the thioredoxin pathway (Trx-TrxR-NADPH) []. Via
  a redox-relay, oxidative equivalents can be transferred to a binding partner in
  a process that, depending on the partner, may involve an additional scaffold protein.
