caption: AMPK regulates several physiological processes through phosphorylation of
  transcription factors and co-activators. It shares substrates with its AMPK family
  related kinases to negatively regulate gluconeogenesis in the liver by phosphorylation
  and inhibition of the CRCT2 and Class IIa HDACs. These phosphorylation events induce
  binding to 14-3-3 scaffold proteins and sequestration of these transcription regulators
  into the cytoplasm. AMPK also regulates transcription factors via inducing their
  degradation (Cry1), preventing their proteolytic activation and translocation to
  nucleus (Srebp1), and by disrupting protein-protein (p300) or protein-DNA interactions
  (Arebp, HNF4a). AMPK has also been shown to directly control phosphorylation of
  Histone 2B on Serine 36 as well as indirectly controlling SIRT1 activity via increasing
  NAD+ levels.
