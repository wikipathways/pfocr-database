caption: The process of GSDMD in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. High sugar environments,
  toxic substances, uric acid, and fatty acids act as risk factors, transmitting information
  to the cell nucleus, activating the NFκB signaling pathway to increase the expression
  of NLRP3, Pro-IL1β, and Pro-IL-18, while also activating mitochondria to release
  ROS and NO. TLR can recognize LPS, transmit signals to NLRP3, and activate GSDMD
  and cytokines. Activated cytokines, GSDMD, ROS, and NO together activate the inflammatory
  cascade reaction
