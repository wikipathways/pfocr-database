caption: The yeast pheromone responsive pathway and generation of the yeast heterologous
  expression system. The pheromone receptor, Ste2 or Ste3, activates the Gα protein
  Gpa1 by converting GDP-bound to GTP-bound and promoting the release of the Gβγ subunits
  (Ste4 and Ste18) from the heterotrimeric G protein complex. Ste4 in turn activates
  PAK kinase Ste20, and MAP kinase cascade including MAPKKK (Ste11), MAPKK (Ste7),
  and MAPK (Fus3). The activation of transcription factor Ste12 by Fus3 promotes mating.
  To generate a yeast heterologous system for Cpr2 using this signaling pathway, the
  pheromone receptor Ste3 is deleted to eliminate signal interference by endogenous
  receptor. The RGS protein Sst2 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Far1 are
  deleted to optimize the signal readout. The promoter of the pheromone inducible
  gene FUS1 is fused with a reporter gene, such as lacZ or HIS3 to quantitatively
  measure the pheromone response signal. In the Cpr2 study, the lacZ gene was used.
