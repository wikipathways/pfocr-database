caption: Proposed model of regulation of pro-apoptotic signaling pathway by miR-128.
  Our data shows that activation of p53, FOXO3A and PUMA and inhibition of SIRT1 and
  IGFBP5 may be responsible for miR-128-induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells. In a transcription-dependent
  and -independent manner, PUMA activates Bak, which may be the downstream molecule
  that is indirectly activated by miR-128 and causes induction of apoptosis. †indicates
  these have been shown in the previous study
