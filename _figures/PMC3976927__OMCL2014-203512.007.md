caption: 'Proposal of the status of the L-arginine/NO pathway in the haemolytic-uraemic
  syndrome (HUS) in childhood. The enzyme NOS converts L-arginine into L-citrulline
  (not shown) and NO which plays multiple physiological roles. NO autooxidizes to
  nitrite. In red blood cells, NO is oxidized to nitrate. Nitrite and nitrate are
  excreted in the urine. By far the major part of L-arginine participates in the urea
  cycle and is utilized in protein synthesis. PRMT methylate L-arginine in proteins
  and methylated proteins are hydrolyzed to the soluble L-arginine derivates SDMA,
  LMMA, and ADMA. LMMA and ADMA act as inhibitors of NOS, thus controlling NO synthesis.
  ADMA is hydrolyzed by DDAH to L-citrulline (not shown) and DMA which is excreted
  in the urine. The status of the L-arginine/NO pathway can be described satisfactorily
  by measuring nitrite, nitrate, ADMA, L-arginine, and DMA in plasma or serum and
  urine. In HUS, NO and ADMA biosynthesis is diminished, whereas DDAH activity is
  not altered. Oxidative stress is elevated, haemolysis is increased, which releases
  Hb that in turn elevates oxidative stress, thus finally establishing a vicious circle.
  Minus means diminished; plus means increased. Abbreviations used in this Figure:
  ADMA: asymmetric dimethylarginine; DDAH: dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase;
  DMA: dimethylamine; LMMA: monomethyl arginine; NOS: nitric oxide synthase; PRMT:
  protein arginine methyl transferase; SDMA: symmetric dimethylarginine.'
