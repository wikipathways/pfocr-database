caption: 'Circadian regulation of GC release. Light input from the retina entrains
  SCN master circadian clock, which in turn can time GC release through input to preautonomic
  or CRH-containing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and two distinct
  regulatory branches: one regulatory pathway dependent on ACTH release and the other
  through an autonomic multisynaptic pathway. Autonomic multisynaptic input to the
  adrenal either modulates adrenal sensitivity to ACTH (A) or GC synthesis/release
  directly (B).'
