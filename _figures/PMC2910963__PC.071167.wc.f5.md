  these pathways are labeled with colors, indicating the fold change (log2) of their
  transcript levels under S deprivation relative to nutrient-replete conditions for
  wild-type cells based on RNA-seq data (color code is given in the figure). The proteins
  encoded by each of the genes represented in the pathway diagram are given in . Dashed

  altered expression in snrk2.1 mutant relative to wild-type cells upon S deprivation.
