caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of GPI in the ER of P. falciparum. The diagram
  is reproduced and modified with kind permission from Kinoshita and Inoue (). In
  step 1, N-acetylglucosamine is added to PI, and the following steps involve deacetylation,
  lipidation of the inositol ring, and addition of mannoses. An EtNP on the third
  mannose enables the linkage of the completed GPI anchor to protein. There is some
  evidence that steps 8 and 9 can occur in the reverse order. Gene names are given
  in italics. (Reprinted from reference  with permission of the publisher.)
