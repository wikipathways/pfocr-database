caption: Crosstalk between different PRRs in antifungal immunity. Dectin-2 and MCL
  can form heterodimers and amplify proinflammatory cytokine production upon Candida
  infection. Dectin-1 and dectin-2 can synergize to induce the NLRP3 inflammasome
  against Histoplasma capsulatum challenge. In addition, dectin-1 and CR3 can collaboratively
  trigger proinflammatory cytokine production against histoplasmosis. Fonsecaea pedrosoi
  activates the Mincle signaling pathway but requires costimulation with TLR ligands
  to induce protective immunity. Mincle can also antagonize dectin-1 signaling upon
  recognition of F. pedrosoi. Finally, dectin-1 and TLR2 interact in the recognition
  and phagocytosis of zymosan particles leading to proinflammatory cytokine production.
  Activatory signals are in blue, inhibitory signals are in red.
