caption: Metabolism affects tumor immune escape, and the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint
  regulates metabolic pathways. Glucose and glutamine metabolism upregulate the expression
  of PD-L1 in tumor cells via the EGFR/ERK/C-Jun pathway. Inhibition of glutamine
  use in tumor cells increases PD-L1 expression by reducing the levels of GSH, inhibiting
  the SERCA activation, and increasing cytosolic Ca2+ levels and CaMKII phosphorylation,
  which further activates the downstream NF-κB signalling pathway. Targeting glutamine
  metabolism can inhibit the production of immune cells negatively affecting the immune
  response (IMCs, MDSCs and Treg cells) and upregulate the function of Teff cells,
  thereby enhancing the antitumor immune response. Activation of the PD-L1/PD-1 signalling
  pathway promotes aerobic glycolysis (i.e., the Warburg effect) in tumor cells, inhibits
  glucose metabolism in Teff cells by stimulating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling pathway,
  and produces synergistic inhibition of the antitumor response.
