caption: Signaling pathways that drive differentiation when trypanosomes enter the
  tsetse midgut. Citrate-cis aconitate (CCA) is transported by cell membrane PAD proteins
  (a), this being favored under cold shock conditions. CCA inhibits the activity of
  the differentiation inhibitor, TbPTP1 (b) a tyrosine phosphatase whose activity
  is normally enhanced by its substrate, TbPIP39. When TbPTP1 is inhibited, TbPIP39
  becomes phosphorylated and more active (c). TbPIP39 can relocate to the glycosome
  (though this is not dependent upon its phosphorylation) whereupon it acts on unidentified
  substrates to promote differentiation (d). The same signaling pathway is stimulated
  by exposure of stumpy forms to mild acid conditions (pH 5.5 for 2 h) (e), which
  also generates phosphorylated TbPIP39. Exposure of stumpy forms to proteases at
  the cell surface (f) also stimulates differentiation, but this does not involve
  TbPTP1 or TbPIP39 and operates through an uncharacterized pathway (g) that may or
  may not involve the glycosome. It is also not necessary for differentiation in the
  midgut of tsetse. A reduction of environmental glucose (h) has also been suggested
  to initiate differentiation, but reducing medium glucose 20-fold, or using the transport
  inhibitor phloretin, does not cause the differentiation of stumpy forms to procyclic
  forms.
