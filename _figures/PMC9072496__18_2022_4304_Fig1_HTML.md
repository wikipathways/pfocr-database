caption: Schematic outline of cybrid cell model generation. The creation of cybrid
  cells involves the collection of cells devoid of nuclear DNA either by enucleation
  of the mitochondria donor cells (cytoplasts) or by the collection of platelets from
  blood. Cells providing the nuclear genome for the resulting cybrids are obtained
  by ridding cells of mtDNA through chemical (e.g., Ethidium Bromide) or genetic (e.g.,
  mitochondria-targeted restriction enzymes or base excision repair pathway enzymes)
  means. Selection of resulting mtDNA-depleted Rho0 cells can be performed based on
  their auxotrophy for uridine and pyruvate. Finally, cybrid cells are created by
  polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated cytoplasmic fusion of mitochondria-donor cytoplasts
  or platelets with nuclear-donor Rho0 cells and positively selected against uridine
  and pyruvate auxotrophy
