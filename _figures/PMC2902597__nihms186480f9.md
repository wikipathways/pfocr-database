caption: 1). PEI/DNA complexes internalize into cells utilizing actin-dependent pathway.
  2). The endosomes containing PEI/DNA complexes travel inside the cytoplasm along
  the microtubules and reach the perinuclear space where the DNA is released through
  an unknown mechanism. 3). An alternative mechanism may involve direct release of
  PEI/DNA complex from endosomal/lysosomal compartments, followed by the transport
  of the complex through the cytoplasm and to the nucleus. 4). The DNA import to the
  nucleus can be enhanced by activating cellular signaling by Pluronic® block copolymers.
  In this case Pluronics® bind with the cell membranes and activate phosphorylation
  of IκB by an IκB-kinase (not shown). The phosphorylated IκB dissociates from its
  complex with NFκB. The released active NFκB enhances transport of DNA into nucleus
  in a promoter-dependent fashion.
