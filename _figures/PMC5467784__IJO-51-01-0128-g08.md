caption: 'Genes associated to tumorigenesis and/or cancer progression found differentially
  methylated in HA22T/VGH sorafenib treated cells. The genes are grouped based on
  their role: apoptosis (A), invasion (B) and angiogenesis (C) as well as genes belonging
  to several signaling pathways such as JAK-STAT (D), RAF/MEK/ERK (E), PI3K/AKT (F),
  JNK (G) and NF-κB (H). Generally, we found a trend where oncogenes were hypermethylated
  and TSG were hypometh-ylated after sorafenib treatment. In light blue and red are
  reported genes found hypomethylated or hypermethylated, respectively. Genes known
  to be TSG are underlined while genes known to be oncogenes are not underlined. Green
  and red lines indicate the activation or inhibition of a gene product or a signaling
  pathway, respectively.'
