caption: a | The figure depicts the three modes of IL-6 signalling and the biological
  outcomes associated with each that may be relevant to COVID-19. The biological significance
  of IL-6 trans-presentation requires further evaluation. b | Drugs targeting the
  IL-6 pathway can bind to IL-6 to stop interactions with IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) or
  gp130, target IL-6R to block IL-6 binding or target the IL-6–soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R)
  complex to inhibit trans-signalling.
