caption: The RB1/E2F pathway is disrupted in the vast majority of SCLCs through RB1
  inactivation or E2F copy number gains. The model illustrated summarizes the different
  activities of E2F factors that have been described in cancer and the particular
  role of EZH2 that we have discovered in SCLC (circled). Besides activation of the
  usual cell cycle factors required for cell cycle progression, such as cyclins A
  and E; p107; dihydrofolate reductase; thymidine kinase; thymidylate synthetase;
  PCNA; or DNA polymerase α; E2F over-activation can also lead to inhibition of the
  cell cycle in specific scenarios through induction of p21 and activation of apoptosis.
  EZH2 plays an essential role in SCLC by favoring the oncogenic processes of the
  RB1/E2F pathway in SCLC. Specifically, EZH2 negatively regulates the expression
  of the pro-apoptotic factors, Puma and Bad, as well as the cell cycle inhibitor,
  p21, thereby promoting SCLC tumorigenicity. Given its functions in SCLC biology,
  our findings suggest EZH2 is a promising therapeutic target for this cancer type.
