caption: Flow chart summarising the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, together with
  the structures and sites of action of the Tu 2208 and Ro 48-8071 inhibitors employed
  in this study. Black arrows indicate an irreversible step, broken arrows indicate
  that one or more intermediate steps have been omitted for clarity. Solid arrows
  with an overlying open X indicate the site of each inhibitor’s action. Standard
  symbols are used to indicate reversible steps.
