caption: The role of cyclin–CDK complexes and the cyclin D–CDK4/6–p16–Rb pathway in
  the cell cycleThe cell cycle is regulated by cyclins and checkpoints, with different
  cyclins (and cyclin–CDK combinations) and checkpoints acting at phase transition
  of the cell cycle. At the G1–S cell cycle checkpoint, mutiple mitogenic pathways
  including ER and PI3K/AKT/mTOR promote the synthesis of cyclin D, which associates
  with and activates CDK4/6. Activated CDK4/6 phosphorylates the Rb protein to disrupt
  its sequestering interaction with E2F, releasing its transcription effect and allowing
  the expression of genes necessary for cell cycle progression, including cyclin E.
  Cyclin E associates with CDK2, which further phosphorylates Rb, resulting in progression
  of the cell cycle past the restriction point and irreversible S phase entry. Additional
  cyclin–CDK complexes act at further cell cycle checkpoints; cyclin A–CDK2 enables
  the S–G2 transition, and cyclin A–CDK1 and cyclin B–CDK1 facilitate the onset and
  progression of mitosis, respectively (). Selective inhibitors of CDK4/6, such as
  ribociclib, act directly on the cyclin D–CDK4/6–p16–Rb pathway to block cell cycle
  progression. The pathway may also be impacted by inhibitors of other pathways acting
  upstream of CDK4/6, providing a rationale for dual inhibition.CDK, cyclin-dependent
  kinase; ER, estrogen receptor; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2; IGF1R,
  insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RTK,
  receptor tyrosine kinase.
