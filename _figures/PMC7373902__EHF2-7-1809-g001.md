caption: Markov model. Patients move between health states on the basis of transition
  probabilities assuming 30 day cycles. Patients can enter the model in the well state
  or with signs or symptoms of rejection. During each cycle, patients can either (i)
  remain well; (ii) experience asymptomatic rejection, if following a pathway of routine
  GEPs or EMBs; (iii) experience symptomatic acute rejection; or (iv) die. Patients
  with rejection detected within 90 days of a prior rejection episode were assumed
  to enter the model with signs or symptoms of rejection. ACR, acute cellular rejection;
  AMR, antibody‐mediated rejection; EMB, endomyocardial biopsy; GEP, gene expression
  profile; S/Sx, signs and symptoms.
