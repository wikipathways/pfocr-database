caption: Activation of the complement system in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
  Streptococcal relationships with the complement system related to the pathogenesis
  of APSGN. Streptococcal interactions with the complement pathways are activating
  (arrows) and suppressing (“evasins” to protect bacterial virulence shown in interrupted
  lines with end blocks). Secreted evasins suppress the activation of several elements
  of the classic complement pathway, whereas surface-bound evasins block the action
  of complement on the bacterial surface by several means. The lectin complement pathway
  is initiated by interaction of polysaccharide ligands in the bacterial surface with
  pattern recognition molecules (MBL, ficolins, and collectins) that react with mannose-binding
  lectin–associated serine proteases (MASPs) and subsequently activates C4 and then
  C2 to form C4b2a (classic pathway C3 convertase). Generation of antifactor B autoantibodies
  may result from neoepitopes resulting from the interaction of the Streptococcus
  with the alternative complement pathway or from conformational epitopes shared between
  factor B and Streptococcus. Antifactor B autoantibodies play a major role in the
  activation of the alternative complement pathway in APSGN because stabilizes C3bBb
  (alternative pathway convertase) and maintains the amplification loop (circle) that
  regenerates C3 from the cleaved active C3b fragment. Consumption of C3 and increase
  in terminal complement components are a consequence of C3bBb activity. Complement
  activation is critical for the nephritogenic inflammatory reactivity of the streptococcal
  antigen-antibody complexes deposited in the glomerulus. C3(H2O), hydrolized C3;
