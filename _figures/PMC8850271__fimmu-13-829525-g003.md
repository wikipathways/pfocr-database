caption: Cell type-specific effects of BAs on immune cell populations relevant to
  IBD. Mixtures of PBAs (CA/UDCA, CDCA/UDCA or CA/CDA/UDCA) or SBAs (DCA/LCA/3-oxoCA/3-oxoLCA/7-oxoCA/7-oxoCDCA/12-oxoCA/12-oxoDCA
  or LCA/3-oxo-LCA) have been found to stimulate RORγt+ FOXP3+ Treg cells by acting
  on the VDR in mice (N.B. In mice, UDCA is considered to be a PBA). IsoalloLCA can
  stimulate the differentiation of FOXP3+ Treg cells through an epigenetic pathway.
  3-oxoLCA and isoLCA inhibit the differentiation of Th17 T cells by acting on the
  RORγt receptor, whilst LCA inhibits Th1 T cell differentiation through a VDR-dependent
  mechanism. IsoDCA induces an anti-inflammatory profile in DCs by acting on the FXR,
  which leads to the promotion of RORγt+ FOXP3+ Treg cells. Similarly, LCA induces
  an anti-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages by activating TGR5. Purple text -
  SBAs, Green text - PBAs, Blue arrows - stimulatory interactions, Red arrow - inhibitory
  interaction, Black arrow - anti-inflammatory effect. PBAs, primary bile acids; SBAs,
