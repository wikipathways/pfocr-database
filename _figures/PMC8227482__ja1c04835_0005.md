caption: Proposed reaction mechanism as calculated with B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(2d,2p) in
  acetonitrile treated as the implicit solvent (see Section 6 in the Supporting Information
  for details). Relative Gibbs free energies at 298 K are given in kcal/mol, whereas
  the energies of the respective sulfilimines A, 19, and 32 are arbitrarily set to
  zero. The energetically most favorable pathway for 1,3-diene 5a to pyrrole 9a is
  highlighted in black. For comparison, the influences of sterics (blue, 19 → 20)
  and electronics (red, 32 → 24) were investigated.
