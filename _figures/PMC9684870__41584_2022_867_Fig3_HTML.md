caption: a, The N-glycome of the synovial fibroblast is rich in high-mannose and short
  di-antennary glycans with differential terminal sialylation in both health and disease
  states. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), TNF stimulates the downregulation of β-galactoside
  α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6Gal1), resulting in reduction of surface sialylation
  and a molecular switch to a more pro-inflammatory synovial fibroblast phenotype.
  Desialylated synovial fibroblast surface glycans may interact with galectin-3 (Gal-3),
  inducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CCL2), which in turn
  upregulate TNF expression and thus the desialylation of the synovial fibroblast
  surface (in a vicious cycle). b, Abnormal glomerulus tissue glycosylation in systemic
  lupus erythematosus. Accumulation of mannose N-glycans is the result of a deficient
  complex-N-glycosylation pathway characterized by downregulation of expression of
  α-mannosidase II (α-Man II) and promotion of O-mannosylation by upregulation of
  expression of protein O-mannosyl-transferase 1 (POMT1). Mannose-enriched N-glycans
  are typically found on the surface of pathogens and can therefore trigger activation
  of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by mannose glycan-binding receptors such as dendritic
  cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN),
  ultimately leading to a loss of self-tolerance. GlcNAcT, N-acetylglucosamine transferase.
