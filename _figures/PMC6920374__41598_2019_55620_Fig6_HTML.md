caption: The role of Wnt signaling in hiPSC-CM differentiation. Wnt signaling is required
  to reduce pluripotency, limit endodermal specification (SOX17, FOXA2), and promote
  mesendodermal (Bry, EOMES) commitment in differentiating hiPSCs; however, excessive
  Wnt activation directs the cells toward the paraxial/presomitic mesoderm lineage
  (CDX1, CDX2, PAX1). The Gi(I/M)Wi protocol enables researchers to balance these
  antagonistic effects of Wnt activity for maximum cardiac mesodermal specification
  and hiPSC-CM yield by adjusting the CHIR initiation and maintenance doses for different
  hiPSC lines (e.g., hciPSCs or hdiPSCs) and culture systems (e.g., monolayer or suspension),
  or to incorporate other factors such as insulin, which increases cell survival and
  proliferation but partially limits Wnt activity.
