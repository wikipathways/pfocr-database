caption: One‐carbon metabolism links the folate cycle with the methionine cycle. In
  this pathway, the methyl group (one‐carbon unit) of serine (Ser) is transferred
  to metabolites in the folate and then methionine cycles. S‐adenosylmethionine (SAM)
  functions as a universal methyl donor for methylation of proteins and nucleotides
  (denoted as X). The anti–cancer drugs 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) and methotrexate (MTX)
  block folate metabolism. DHF, dihydrofolic acid; HCY, homocysteine; SAH, S‐adenosyl‐homocysteine;
