caption: Disorders of GSL and ganglioside degradation. Inherited diseases (violet)
  caused by genetic defects of individual hydrolases/proteins (green) in the GSL and
  ganglioside degradation pathway. Increased levels of lysosphingolipids occur in
  the GSL LSDs, e.g., glucosylsphingosine in Gaucher disease, Lyso-Gb3 in Fabry disease,
  and galactosylsphingosine in Krabbe disease. Variant AB is GM2 activator deficiency
  disease. Tay-Sach disease, Sandhoff disease, and Variant AB are GM2 gangliosidosis.
  Abbreviations are listed in  legend.
