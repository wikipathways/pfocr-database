caption: HBV interaction with the ER-associated degradation pathway. HBV activates
  expression of EDEMs, which promote degradation of wild-type, assembly-competent
  HBV surface proteins, reducing the production of subviral and viral particles (A).
  Silencing of endogenous EDEM1 in HBV replicating cells induces accumulation of folding-competent
  envelope proteins and increases secretion of subviral and viral particles (B).
