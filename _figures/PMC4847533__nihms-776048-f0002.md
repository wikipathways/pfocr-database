caption: Moco biosynthesis and the formation of cPMP. (A) Moco biosynthetic pathway.
  The symbols on GTP and cPMP indicate the origin of the carbon and nitrogen atoms
  in cPMP, as determined by isotope labeling studies. cPMP may also be in a hydrate
  form in solution. (B) Structure of the previously proposed MoaC substrate, pyranopterin
  triphosphate. (C) Current working hypothesis for the MoaC-catalyzed conversion of
  3′,8-cH2GTP to cPMP. The proposed structural candidates for intermediate X are shown.
  (D) Uncleavable analogue of 3′,8-cH2GTP (3′,8-cH2GMP[CH2]PP).
