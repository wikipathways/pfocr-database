caption: The lipid synthesis and metabolism pathway in T. pseudonana during N depletion
  compared to N replete conditions (ND vs. NR). The serial number represent the related
  enzyme and the negative number indicate the down-expressed fold change of the genes
  (The opposite is up-expressed). The Inside the parentheses is the protein fold change.
  There are serval genes in one enzyme.
