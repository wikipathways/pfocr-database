caption: 'The healthy or asymptomatic gut, vagina, and bladder microbiome is stable
  across individuals conditions. These microbiota protect their host-associated niche
  from foreign pathogens by controlling abiotic factors and outcompeting potentially
  invasive microbiota. Microbial dysbiosis and an adverse environment disrupts host
  homeostasis through various mechanisms such as: poor hygiene, metabolic changes
  (menopause, metabolic diseases, etc.), exposure to environmental metals or antibiotics,
  and consumption of food-borne pathogens. This allows for microbiota to transit between
  the perianal-urogenital pathway and in turn shapes other microbial communities towards
  dysbiosis and predisposes individuals to UTI pathophysiology.'
