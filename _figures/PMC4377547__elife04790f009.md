caption: 'Intestinal barrier dysfunction may play an important role in promoting death
  following TBI (indicated in red). TBI induces additional physiological changes (indicated
  in black) that do not cause death but may contribute to other outcomes such as neurodegeneration.
  Bacteria-independent and bacteria-dependent pathways that activate the innate immune
  response are indicated by ‘ind.’ and ‘dep.’, respectively.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04790.019'
