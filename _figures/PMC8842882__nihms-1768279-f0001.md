caption: (A) Signaling networks regulate metabolic state to tune T cell fate decisions.
  Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively)
  orchestrate signaling to induce anabolic metabolism in T cells. Mechanistically,
  mTORC1 activity regulates these programs, in part, by upregulating transcriptional
  programs mediated by MYC, sterol regulatory binding element proteins (SREBPs), and
  hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Additional transcriptional networks regulated
  by NFAT, BATF, and IRF4 are also crucial to support certain anabolic processes.
  In contrast, AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activation promotes fatty acid
  oxidation (FAO), a catabolic program. The metabolic programs are shown in grey boxes
  and their impacts on the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of conventional
  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are shown. (B) The interplay between the major metabolic pathways
  involved in T cell fate decisions are depicted. Key selective nutrients are shown
  in red. Note that serine can be de novo synthesized or acquired from extracellular
  sources. PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; Tcm, central memory T cell; Tem, effector
  memory T cell; Th, CD4+ T helper; Trm, tissue-resident T cell.
