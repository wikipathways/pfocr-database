caption: Roles of REG3A in cancer. REG3A has dual roles in cancer research, which
  is unlike in non-cancer cells. For one side, REG3A was high expressed in many cancer
  tissues and cell lines and promoted cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion
  through activating JAK/STAT3, AKT or ERK signaling pathways. The overexpressed REG3A
  could be regulated by LncRNA, inflammatory environment, or Wnt pathway. For another,
  REG3A had low levels in part of tumor tissues. And this expression suppression may
  be related to DNA methylation. Cells showed growth inhibition, cell cycle arrested
  and enhanced chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity when REG3A was overexpression.
  Therefore, REG3A acted as a tumorigenesis or anti-tumor factor in different tumors
