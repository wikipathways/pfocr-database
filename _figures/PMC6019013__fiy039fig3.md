caption: '(A–C) Model for plastid reduction. (A) Photosynthetic plastid with its (5)
  plastome and an intact photosynthesis machinery including the structural requirements
  for it: (1) light reaction, (2) oxidative & reductive pentose phosphate cycle, (3)
  thylakoids with (4) ferredoxin as well as additional plastid located pathways are
  expressed: (6) sulfateassimilation, (7) nitrogenassimilation via the GS/GOGAT way
  and subsequent protoporphyrin and chlorophyll-a synthesis, the synthesis of β-carotene
  via the isoprenoidsynthesis in the MEP pathway, the xanthophyll-cycle and the synthesis
  of aromatic amino acids via the shikimate pathway. The nitrogenassimilation has
  a cytosolic alternative, the glutamate dehydrogenase way and the isoprenoidsynthesis
  via the MEP pathway has as cytosolic alternative the mevalonate pathway. (B) Plastid
  in an early stage of reduction with its (5) plastome. Photosynthesis is reduced
  so that only the (2) oxidative and not the reductive pentose phosphate cycle is
  expressed, (3) thylakoids are present with a (4) ferredoxin/FNR redox system. Among
  the additional pathways that are expressed in the plastid are the (6) sulfateassimilation
  and the shikimate pathway for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids, whereby tryptophan
  is no longer synthesized. The β-carotene synthesis is now expressed via the cytosolic
  mevalonate pathway, the synthesis of chlorophyll-a and the plastid located nitrogenassimilation
  are no longer express like the xanthophyll-cycle. However, the protoporphyrin synthesis
  via the cytosolic nitrogen assimilation is expressed in the plastid. (C) Plastid
  in an advanced stage of reduction with its (5) plastome. The (3) thylakoids are
  lost and all additional biosynthesis except the biosynthesis of protoporphyrin are
  no longer expressed.'
