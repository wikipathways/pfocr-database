caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed triggering receptor expressed
  on the myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) signaling pathway involved in downstream inflammatory
  machinery, which contributes to acute ischemic neuronal cell death. Acute ischemic
  stroke may cause ischemic brain cell death, which is influenced by the amount of
  human S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B). Acute ischemic insult is a danger
  signal, which activates soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) from the shedding of membrane TREM-1
  in activated glial cells, promoting an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines
  in cerebrospinal fluid and leakage to serum from disrupted BBB. TNF-α: tumor necrosis
  α, IL-1α: interleukin 1α, IL-1β: interleukin 1β IL-6: interleukin 6, IL-8: interleukin
  8, IFN-γ: interferon-γ, MCP-1: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, MMPs, matrix
  metalloproteinases.'
