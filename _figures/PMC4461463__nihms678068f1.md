caption: 'Scheme for arginase catabolism of L-arginine to L-ornithine/urea or L-citrulline/NO,
  production of polyamines and anabolism and catabolism of proline. Also shown are
  the pathway for synthesis of L-arginine from L-glutamine, the reversible pathway
  between L-ornithine and L-glutamine, and the recycling of L-citrulline into L-arginine.
  Abbreviations: ASL, aminosuccinate lyase; ASS, aminosuccinate synthase; NOS, nitric
  oxide synthase; OAT; ornithine aminotransferase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; OTC,
  ornithine transcarbamylase. Arginase (bottom, left) is the final enzyme in the urea
  cycle within the liver, which restarts the cycle through the synthesis of L-citrulline
  from carbamoyl-phosphate (1) and L-ornithine (2) by OTC (center). It should be noted
  that that these reactions do not all occur within any given cell. In particular,
  the urea cycle is independent of the other reactions; i.e., L-arginine produced
  within the urea cycle is not a substrate for NOS and L-ornithine produced within
  the urea cycle is not a substrate for OAT or ODC'
