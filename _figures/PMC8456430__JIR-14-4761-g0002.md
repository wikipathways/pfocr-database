caption: Apoptosis mechanism in Alzheimer’s disease. Extracellular Aβ proteins and
  inflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-α, IL-1β) can cause neuronal apoptosis through membrane
  receptors. The interruption of intracellular homeostasis induces apoptosis via intrinsic
  pathway as evidenced by oxidative stress and the hyperphosphorylated aggregates
  of microtubule-associated protein Tau in neurofibrillary tangles. The release of
  cytochrome c leads to apoptosome formation, which results in caspase activation
  and subsequent apoptosis. Pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins block the mitochondrial pathway
  of apoptosis. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces apoptosis by initiating
  calcium-signaling and caspase activation. Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs)
  regulate apoptosis by binding and inhibiting caspases. Mitochondrial Smac/Diablo
  and Omi/HtrA2 can bind to IAPs to facilitate caspase activation and apoptosis.
