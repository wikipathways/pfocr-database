caption: Reelin signaling pathway in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). During healthy conditions,
  Reelin signaling prevents abnormal tau phosphorylation, modulates amyloid precursor
  protein (APP) processing and enhances NMDA and AMPA receptors functions. Reelin
  binds to its receptors very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein
  E receptor 2 (ApoER2). This binding activates the adaptor protein Disabled-1 (Dab1)
  through phosphorylation, which initiates downstream pathways, including activation
  of phosphatydilinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), involved
  in synaptic plasticity, cytoskeletal stability and neuronal maintenance, among others.3
  Reelin is involved in the downregulation of tau phosphorylation via reduction of
  Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) activity. However, alterations in Reelin
  expression during AD results in the reduced activation of its downstream signaling,
  leading to excessive tau phosphorylation, microtubule destabilization and formation
  of NFTs. Moreover, Reelin can interact with APP and promote its non-amyloidogenic
  processing. Thus, altered Reelin signaling leads to decreased inhibition of amyloidogenic
  APP processing, contributing to increased Aβ production and Aβ plaque accumulation.3
  Finally, Reelin signaling can activate Src/Fyn kinases, leading to the inhibition
  of striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP), which in turn prevents
  NMDA receptor endocytosis. In fact, during AD, activation of STEP by Aβ leads to
  internalization of NMDA receptors.3 Hence, impaired Reelin signaling causes the
  dysregulation of NMDA receptor activity, leading to the weakening of synaptic strength
  and reduced trafficking of AMPA receptors. Additionally, Aβ can also bind NMDA receptors,
  leading to its overstimulation and excessive release of Ca2+, which causes the endocytosis
  of both AMPA and NMDA receptors.3 Figure created with BioRender.com
