caption: Gene and pathway interaction networks obtained after functional enrichment
  analysis using ClueGO, a Cytoscape plug-in. The red nodes are the hub genes; remaining
  genes are presented in violet color. The same color code was used for pathway nodes
  and their corresponding edges to highlight the cross talk between the pathways.
  All the represented pathways here are highly significant following a Benjamini-Hochberg
  correction. Pathway enrichment analysis and visualization was performed in Cytoscape
  version 3.0.2.
