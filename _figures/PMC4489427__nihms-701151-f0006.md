caption: Integrated analysis of alterations in key pathways in nccRCC subtypes. Shown
  are mutated genes and their mutational frequencies in the indicated RCC subtypes
  for MET signaling and metabolism pathways. Mutated genes in the pathway are shown
  inside a curved-edge rectangle. Bars on top of the curved-edge rectangle indicate
  mutations that are known or predicted to be activating, and bars on the bottom edge
  of the curved-edge rectangle indicate mutations known or predicted to be inactivating.
  The length of each bar is proportional to the frequency of the mutations observed
  by subtype in this study or the TCGA study (for ccRCC; ref. ). An asterisk indicates
  genes with known RCC risk alleles. Enclosed in pink curved-edge rectangles are genes
  involved in fusions identified in this study.
