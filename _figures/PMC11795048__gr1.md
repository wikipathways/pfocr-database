caption: 'Design and application of A@HAP NPs in cancer therapy. (A) Schematic representation
  of A@HAP NPs. (B) Mechanism of action for A@HAP NPs: Upon administration, A@HAP
  NPs circulate and accumulate within the tumor site. P induces ICD effects, while
  A modulates the STAT3 signaling pathway at the tumor microenvironment, leading to
  a robust anti-tumor immune response and synergistic induction of apoptosis'
