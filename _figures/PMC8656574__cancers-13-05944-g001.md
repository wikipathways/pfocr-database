caption: 'Long non-coding RNA in OSCC beginning from identification to characterization
  of their functions and relevant mechanisms. The first step is to acquire samples
  of primary tumor and normal tissues from OSCC patients, and then RNA sequencing
  is applied to screen dysregulated lncRNAs. Furthermore, a series oncogenic and tumor-suppressor
  functions in tumor biological behaviors such as cell cycle, metastasis, angiogenesis,
  apoptosis, and drug resistance were identified in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically,
  lncRNAs regulate OSCC biological behaviors via the following aspects: (a) Epigenetic
  regulation. For example, FALEC can recruit polycomb complex EZH2 to specific genomic
  loci, where they methylate H3K27me3 to induce chromatin compaction and affect transcriptional
  activity. (b) Transcription regulation. For example, NKILA interacts with transcription
  factors NF-κB to block the action of transcription factors, thus repressing Twist
  expression. (c) Signaling pathway regulation. LEF1-AS1 interacts with LATS1 protein
  to inhibit the Hippo signaling pathway, resulting in attenuation of YAP1 phosphorylation
  (d) ceRNA mechanism/miRNA sponge. For example, H19, acting as a molecular sponge,
  competitively binds to miR-138, thereby upregulating the level of miR-138 target
  gene. (e) mRNA stability. For example, CEBPA-AS1 binding to CEBPA mRNA enhances
  its stability, leading to a gain of target transcripts expression.'
