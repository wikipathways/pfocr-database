caption: Regulation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) by glucose, fatty acid, and ketone
  body metabolism. (A) Regulation of the small intestine by key genes and metabolites
  involved in glucose metabolism. Paneth cells produce lactate through anaerobic glycolysis
  to fuel the ISCs and promote ISC self‐renewal. (B) Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase
  (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) are essential enzymes in the pathway of fatty
  acid synthesis, responsible for producing long‐chain fats and their derivatives.
  Carnitine palmitoyl‐transferase1 alpha (CPT1A) is involved in the transport of fatty
  acids into mitochondria. A portion of the acetyl‐CoA produced from fatty acid oxidation
  is redirected to the liver, where it contributes to ketone body metabolism. In the
  presence of HMG‐CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2), beta‐hydroxybutyrate (β‐OHB) is generated
  to promote ISC self‐renewal. HNF4, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4; PPAR, peroxisome
  proliferator‐activated receptor; PRDM16, PR/SET domain 16
