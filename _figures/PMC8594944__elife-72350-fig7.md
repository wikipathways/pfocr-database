caption: (A) In wild-type females, Akh mRNA transcripts and APC activity are lower
  compared with wild-type males, leading to lower AkhR signaling. Given that AkhR
  signaling stimulates fat breakdown, lower AkhR signaling in females contributes
  to higher female fat storage. (B) In females lacking functional tra, Akh mRNA transcripts
  are higher compared with wild-type females, leading to higher AkhR signaling. Higher
  AkhR signaling in tra mutant females contributes to lower tra mutant female fat
  storage. (C) In wild-type males, Akh mRNA transcripts and APC activity are higher
  compared with wild-type females, leading to higher AkhR signaling. Higher AkhR signaling
  in males contributes to lower male fat storage.
