caption: 'Schematic overview of signaling pathways activated by cardioprotective adaptations
  and of mitochondrially associated and/or localized kinases and their effects on
  mitochondrial function. The figure summarizes the main cardioprotective signaling
  pathways. Released or generated extracellular molecules (gray dots) act on sarcolemmal
  receptors or act receptor-independently, and subsequent downstream cytosolic signaling
  cascades are activated: the NO/PKG, RISK, and SAFE pathways, as well as other kinases
  not associated with the indicated pathways. Pathways/kinases displayed in gray are
  not included in the present review. The kinases within the mitochondrion in the
  lower part of the figure are shown according to their influence on mitochondrial
  function in cardioprotective interventions, not according to their localization
  within the organelles. Created with BioRender.com. Abbreviations: I, II, II, IV,
  V (ATP synthase) indicate respiratory chain complexes; ADP: adenosine diphosphate;
  AKT: protein kinase B; AMPK: adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ATP:

  signal-regulated kinase; GSK3β: glycogen synthase kinase 3β; HK II: hexokinase II;
  JNK: C-Jun N-terminal kinase; KATP: ATP-dependent potassium channel; MPTP: mitochondrial
