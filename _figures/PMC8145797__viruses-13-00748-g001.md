caption: Innate immune signaling in insect and mosquito systems. The innate immune
  system is heavily conserved across species and involves various signaling pathways
  induced in response to viral nucleic acids (RNAi) or detection of upstream antiviral
  effectors (JAK/STAT, Toll, IMD). (A) The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway functions
  to detect cytosolic dsRNA or DNA that is indicative of viral infection. (B) The
  JAK/STAT pathway, which is conserved between mosquito and human species, induces
  transcription of downstream antiviral effector genes. (C) The Toll pathway functions
  to respond to Gram-positive bacterial and fungal infection and is present in the
  form of TLR in mammals. (D) The IMD pathway is activated during Gram-negative bacterial
  infection and is similar to the TNF/NF-kB pathway. Adapted from “Blank Pathway (Linear)”,
