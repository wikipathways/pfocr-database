caption: 'Three pathways with the highest scores in Query 1. For conciseness, a common
  reaction in S. cerevisiae and E. coli is drawn only once in each building block.
  The solid-headed arrow indicates the reactions exist in both species, constituting
  an "i-i-i-i" pathway. a. Z(P) = 41. Involved KEGG maps include: glycolysis/gluconeogenesis;
  pentose phosphate pathway; starch and sucrose metabolism; phenylalanine, tyrosine
  and tryptophan biosynthesis. b. Z(P) = 40. Involved KEGG maps include: pentose phosphate
  pathway; glycolysis/gluconeogenesis; starch and sucrose metabolism; glutathione
  metabolism. c. Z(P) = 39. Involved KEGG maps include: starch and sucrose metabolism;
  glycolysis/gluconeogenesis; galactose metabolism; streptomycin biosynthesis; pentose
  phosphate pathway.'
