caption: Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) derived from the diet and/or adipose tissue
  lipolysis enter the circulation and influence several tissues through activity upon
  resident cells expressing Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4. TLR pathway activation
  via the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) induces proinflammatory cytokines
  [e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and IL-6, chemokines, and adhesion molecules,
  which may promote inappropriate macrophage recruitment to tissues, including the
  arterial subintima and adipose tissue. Intercellular communications also modify
  the obesity phenotype itself in part through activity upon the hypothalamus and
  lead to steatohepatitis, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance.
