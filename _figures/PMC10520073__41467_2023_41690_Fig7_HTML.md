caption: Firstly, we leveraged ABC model to establish genome-wide regulatory maps
  genes across 20 cancer types by integrating large-scale multi-omics data including
  chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq or DNase-seq), histone modifications (H3K27ac
  ChIP-seq), and chromatin interaction (Hi-C). We further characterized the functional
  characteristics of ABC variants based on genomic distribution, functional annotation
  and GWAS enrichment. Meanwhile, pathway analysis, mutation landscape, immune infiltration
  and drug response were integrated to the effects of ABC genes in tumorigenesis and
  clinical application. Mechanistically, we systematically screened ABC variants associated
  with CRC risk in 17,789 cases and 19,951 controls using GWAS chip data and independently
  validated in a large-scale population consisting of 6024 cases and 10,022 controls.
  We identified an ABC regulatory variant rs4810856 that is significantly associated
  with an increased risk of CRC (OR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.05–1.16, P = 4.02×10-5). Mechanistically,
  the ABC variant acted as an allele-specific enhancer mediated by TF ZEB1 to distally
  facilitate expression of PREX1, CSE1L and STAU1, which synergistically activated
  p-AKT signaling to drive CRC cell proliferation. The graph was created with BioRender.com.
