caption: A. Molecular Regulation of GR Activity of the GR is regulated at multiple
  levels. Glucocorticoids (CORT), the ligand for the GR, promote nuclear translocation
  activity of the GR (a.). Co-chaperones of the GR such as FKBP5 (b.) and FKBP4 (c.)
  impair or promote GR nuclear translocation respectively. The GR is phosphorylated
  (d.) at multiple sites which may increase or decrease GR activity, and furthermore,
  the phosphorylation status of GR may alter the transcriptional profile, providing
  fine-tuning of the genes GR up or down-regulates. Ubiquitination (e.) promotes degradation
  of the GR, reducing GR activity. Expression of GRβ (f.) may decrease activity of
  the GR, and increased efflux of the ligand CORT from the cell due to increased p-glycoprotein
  activity (g.) may also decrease activity of GR. Altered transcription of Nr3c1 (h.)
  may also impact GR expression and activity.B. Molecular Regulation of NFκB. The
  canonical and non-canonical NFκB pathways reside in the cytoplasm, tethered by the
  inhibitor protein IκBα/p100/p105. Following TAK1-mediated activation by TNF, IL-1,
  and Toll-like receptor transduction pathways, the canonical IKK complex phosphorylates
  IκBα, thus releasing the p65-p50 heterodimer to translocate to the nucleus. In the
  non-canonical pathway, following activation by lymphotoxin-β receptor or CD40 ligand
  signaling, IKKα phosphorylates p100/p105, thus triggering their cleavage into p52/p50.
  The newly freed p52/p50-RelB complex then translocates into the nucleus. The NFκB
  complex may be subject to further post-translational modifications including phosphorylation
  and acetylation prior to binding to the κREs.
