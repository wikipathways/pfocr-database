caption: Effects of BRAF inhibitors on melanoma and immune cells. Melanoma tumor cells
  with a BRAFV600E mutation experience a decrease in oncogenic mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling when treated with a BRAF inhibitor, evidenced by
  phosphorylation of ERK (pERK). (A) In lymphocytes, the exposure to a BRAF inhibitor
  instead leads to a paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway and increased phosphorylated
  ERK (pERK). (B) BRAF inhibitor therapy in melanoma cells has been reported to increase
  melanoma antigen expression and T-cell recognition directly or indirectly. (C) Chronic
  exposure to BRAF inhibitors has been shown to upregulate the surface expression
  of the immune checkpoint ligand (PD-L1) of programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). (D)
  The tumor microenvironment (macrophages, tumor-associated fibroblasts [TAFs]) can
  be modulated by BRAF inhibitors to enhance the immune response. IL, interleukin;
  PD-1, programmed death receptor-1; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor cell; MEKi,
  MEK inhibitor; TCR, T-cell receptor; TIL, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte; TNF-α,
  tumor necrosis factor alpha; Tyr, tyrosinase; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth
  factor.
