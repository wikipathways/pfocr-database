caption: FoxO proteins employ multiple signal transduction pathways that affect cell
  proliferation, survival and immune system function. Post-translational modification
  of FoxO proteins involves pathways associated with phosphorylation, acetylation
  and ubiquitylation. The serine-threonine kinase protein kinase B (Akt) can prevent
  cellular apoptosis through the phosphorylation of FoxO proteins. Post-translational
  phosphorylation (p) of FoxO proteins will maintain FoxO transcription factors in
  the cytoplasm by association with 14-3-3 proteins and prevent the transcription
  of pro-apoptotic target genes. During FoxO protein activation, FoxOs can prevent
  inflammatory cell activation through the inhibition of nuclear factor-κB (NFκB).
  FoxO proteins can lead to apoptotic death pathways that involve mitochondrial (Mito)
  release of cytochrome c (Cyto c) and caspase activation through a Fas-mediated ligand
  (Fas L) death pathway, tumor-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL),
  BH3-only proteins Noxa and Bim, or p53. Cell cycle inhibition that blocks tumor
  growth through FoxO protein activation can rely upon c-myc, p27 and NFκB. FoxO proteins
  may influence inflammatory cell activation through phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization
  on cells.
