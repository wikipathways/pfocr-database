caption: 'Communication between the gut microbiota and other organs. (A) The gut microbiota
  and the brain engage in bidirectional communication through various metabolites
  (SCFAs, 5‐HT, GABA, dopamine), endocrine pathways (HPA axis), and immune pathways.
  (B) Microbiota dysbiosis or microbial metabolites are emerging as potential regulators
  of placenta‐related prenatal diseases. Certain beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium
  can promote placental morphogenesis and microbiota metabolites like SCFAs can prevent
  placental growth restriction and promote placental angiogenesis. However, excessive
  LPS cause fetal growth restriction through the gut–placenta axis. (C) The liver
  secretes BAs into the intestine via the biliary system, where they are reabsorbed.
  BAs metabolism in the gut–liver axis is primarily regulated by FXR, with secondary
  BAs promoting FXR expression. In turn, it inhibits BAs production and influx, facilitates
  BAs efflux, to alleviates excessive BA accumulation in the liver. However, gut microbiota
  dysbiosis can lead to systemic microbial translocation into the hepatic portal circulation.
  Increased LPS activates the NF‐κB signaling pathway to exacerbate the progression
  of liver diseases. Abbreviations: FGF15/19, fibroblast growth factor15/19; FGFR4,
  fibroblast growth factor receptor4; CYP7A1, cholesterol 7‐alpha hydroxylase; NF‐κB,
  nuclear factor‐κB. (D) The crosstalk within the gut–lung axis is closely linked
  to the circulatory and lymphatic systems. Beneficial microbiota produce metabolites
  such as SCFAs can enhance the activation of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), forming
  a natural protective barrier. Conversely, dysbiosis‐induced increases in LPS trigger
  the NF‐κB signaling pathway, leading to inflammatory infiltration and lung function
  impairment. (E) Microbiota dysbiosis induce excessive arachidonic acid and reduce
  SCFAs wl promote the development of skin diseases. And the reduction of beneficial
  microbes such as Bacteroides exacerbates proinflammatory responses (created in BioRender.
