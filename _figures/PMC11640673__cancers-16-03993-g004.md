caption: Targeted therapies, new lines of chemotherapies and cancer innate immunity.
  (A) Targeted therapies in the context of RAS-driven cancers, aim for instance at
  targeting directly the mutated RAS oncogene or the broad RAS signaling pathway.
  AMG510 binds to KRASG12C mutation. TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) such as EGFRi
  or HER2i are also under development to block RAS signaling. This figure has been
  created with Biorender.com. (B) Advances in new therapeutics are aimed at increasing
  the DNA replication stress and at promoting inflammatory signaling. Genomic instability
  and inflammation being connected, it has been reported that the benefit brought
  by replication stress-inducers (ATRi or PARPi) is mediated through the cGAS-STING
  pathway and anti-cancer immunity. Questions marks (in red) highlight here that the
  molecular mechanism that leads to cytosolic DNA and micronuclei formation upon such
  treatments, and which activates cGAS is not yet understood. STING agonists are new
  molecules that can promote STING signaling and subsequent anti-cancer immunity.
  These new lines of therapies show promising results in combination (indicated by
  +/-) with conventional chemotherapies (platinum-based DNA damaging agents) or with
  immune-checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1). See main text for details
