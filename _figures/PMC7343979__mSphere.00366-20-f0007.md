caption: Model of Sho1 glycolysis-mediated signaling through glycolysis and Ras1-cAMP
  in microcolony formation. The model places Sho1, a transmembrane adaptor protein,
  as the most upstream element of the signaling pathway that interacts with enzymes
  of the glycolysis pathway and TCA cycle before the signal is translated to downstream
  targets such as Ras1 and Cyr1 and C. albicans microcolonies are formed. Either the
  SH3 domain of the Sho1 protein interacts with phosphofructose kinase 1 (Pfk1) or
  its TM domain interacts with fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 1 (Fba1), phosphoglycerate
  kinase 1 (Pgk1), and pyruvate kinase (CDC19) in mediating the signaling response.
