caption: 'Lipoprotein metabolism dysregulation in lysosomal acid lipase deficiency
  a) The liver secretes VLDL, which is lipolyzed in the periphery by LPL and HL to
  generate LDL. LDL is taken up via the LDLR and is trafficked to the lysosome for
  degradation. LAL hydrolyzes the cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in LDL to FFA
  and FC. FC prevents SREBP pathway activation, thereby decreasing de novo cholesterol
  biosynthesis. FC also activates the LXR pathway to increase ABCA1 expression. ABCA1
  effluxes FC to an APOA1 acceptor. The FC is esterified by LCAT to form the cholesteryl
  ester in HDL b) In LALD, inability to hydrolyze LDL cholesteryl ester and triglyceride
  impairs FFA and FC generation. Decreased FC generation results in increased SREBP
  pathway activation, which increases de novo cholesterol biosynthesis. Decreased
  FC also decreases LXR pathway activation, which decreases ABCA1 expression and impairs
  HDL formation. Accumulation of the FC and FFAs in the lysosome causes hepatic, adrenal,
  and intestinal toxicity. Abbreviations: APOA1: Apolipoprotein A1; ABCA1: ATP-binding
  cassette transporter-1; FC: Free cholesterol; FFA: Free fatty acid; HL: Hepatic
  lipase; HDL-C: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LCAT: Lecithin-cholesterol
  acyltransferase; LPL: Lipoprotein lipase; LXR: Liver X receptor; LDL: Low-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol; LDLR: Low-density lipoprotein receptor; LAL: Lysosomal
  acid lipase; LALD: Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency; SREBP: Sterol regulatory element-binding
