caption: ROS derived from mitochondria reduce NO bioavailability, impair NO-mediated
  signalling and induce the activation of inflammatory signalling, such as NFκB and
  p38 MAPK pathways. Shear stress attenuates ROS generation and increases NO bioavailability
  via the ERK5 pathway. Shear stress represses TGF-β1-induced inflammatory activation
  by suppressing p38 MAPK and NFκB signalling which act downstream of TAK1, in a manner
  independent of ERK5, redox poise and ALK5 kinase activity. Shear stress may attenuate
  the canonical ALK5/SMAD pathway via the upregulation of inhibitory SMADs, i.e. SMAD6
  and SMAD7.
