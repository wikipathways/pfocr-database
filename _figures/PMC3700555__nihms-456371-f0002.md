caption: A model demonstrating how protein synthesis rates are mediated during mitochondrial
  stress. Conditions including inhibition of a mitochondrial protease required for
  respiratory chain quality control and mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis [, ], respiratory
  chain or ATP synthase impairment [] as well as paraquat treatment [] result in phosphorylation
  of the translation initiation factor eIF2α by the kinase GCN2. The subsequent decrease
  in protein synthesis potentially reduces the burden on the protein folding and respiratory
  chain complex assembly machinery, thus protecting the protein-folding environment.
  In addition to reducing global protein synthesis, phosphorylated eIF2α promotes
  the translation and thus activation of the transcription factor Gcn4p in yeast and
  Atf4 in mammals, both of which are also protective during mitochondrial stress [,
  , ]. It is currently unclear how GCN2 becomes activated or senses mitochondrial
  dysfunction. But, because GCN2 is known to respond to amino acid deprivation and
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and both occur during mitochondrial dysfunction multiple
  possibilities exist.
