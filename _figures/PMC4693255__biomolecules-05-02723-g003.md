caption: 'The NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathway. (A) TNF-α is one of the most potent
  activators of NF-κB. TNF-α binds to the TNF-α receptor and activates the IKK kinase
  complex, which consists of three subunits: IKKα, β and Nemo (IKKγ). IKK phosphorylates
  (red circles) the inhibitory protein IκBα and targets this protein for Ub mediated
  degradation. The liberated NF-κB dimer translocates into the nucleus, undergoes
  additional post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (red circle)
  and/or acetylation (yellow circle), and binds to κB elements in the promoters of
  target genes to regulate their expression; (B) Factors such as IL-6 signals through
  the JAK/STAT3 pathway. The IL6 receptor (gp130) activates intracellular JAK kinases,
  predominantly JAK2, which phosphorylate STAT3. Once phosphorylated, STAT3 molecules
  dimerize, translocate to the nucleus and bind to STAT response elements in the promoters
  of target genes. STAT3 signaling is tightly regulated by several inhibitory molecules,
  including suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins.'
