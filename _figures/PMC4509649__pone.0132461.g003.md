caption: Molecular pathways were predicted according to the Genoscope and KEGG databases.
  The squares correspond to protein abundance (nitrogen limitation versus control)
  and the circles correspond to mRNA expression (nitrogen limitation versus control).
  The data presented here were taken from four biologically independent replicates.
