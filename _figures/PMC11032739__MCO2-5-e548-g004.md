caption: 'Scientific hypothesis: when lung cancer cells undergo DNA damage after radiation
  exposure and emit certain signals, RNA‐binding motif protein 17 (RBM17) may sense
  these signals, translocate into the nucleus, facilitate the entry of Musashi2 (MSI2),
  and subsequently interact with ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3‐related kinase
  (ATR), activating ATR along with checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and other downstream
  molecules. This activation promotes the DNA damage response pathway, facilitating
  DNA damage repair. When DNA damage repair is completed, MSI2 and RBM17 receive certain
  signals, dissociate from ATR, and exit the nucleus to return to the initial state'
