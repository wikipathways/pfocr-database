caption: 'Gene regulatory network (GRN) inferred for members from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) pathway. Red-colored edges: interactions predicted for carcinogenic
  group; Blue-colored edges: interactions predicted for drug-induced liver injury
  (DILI) group. Cluster in the upper section indicate starting nodes, while clusters
  in the lower section are comprised of target genes specific to each chemical group.'
