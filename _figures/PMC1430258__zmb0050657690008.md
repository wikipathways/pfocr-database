caption: Model for PR chaperoning showing a transient association of GCUNC-45 during
  the progression from the intermediate to the mature complex. FKBP52, and possibly
  other cochaperones that bind hsp90 through TPR domains, may displace GCUNC-45 from
  PR complexes as a response to specific signals.
