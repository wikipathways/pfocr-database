caption: 'Molecular network of up- and down-regulated features in the tomato organs
  in response to T. absoluta herbivory. The molecular network was obtained using Compound
  Discoverer 3.3 and was visualized with Cytoscape 3.9.1 following the procedure described
  at https://github.com/Florent-1/Molecular-Networks-from-Compound-Discoverer-to-Cytoscape
  (accessed on 10 April 2022). The pie chart in each node represent the relative abundance
  of the feature in T.absoluta treated (grey) vs. control (white). These abundances
  are presented in priority in InfLat 4 days of herbivory, identified by a dark green
  circle surrounding the node. When the feature is not affected in InfL, the relative
  abundance is represented for the most impacted organ, with the following nomenclature:
  Light green, InfL at 7 days; purple: St at 4 days; pink, St at 7 days; dark blue,
  LowL at 4 days; light blue, LowL at 7 days; red, R at 4 days; orange, R at 7 days.
  The structures of some formally identified nodes are surrounded in blue, and those
  of putative compounds are surrounded in yellow.'
