caption: Occasionally, cells are exposed to various environmental conditions that
  result in a disruption of ER function and buildup of unfolded proteins. The ER stress
  response, or unfolded protein response, is the cell’s reaction to such insults.
  For a non-lytic virus, cell survival is essential for viral replication. It is possible
  that viral proteins may attempt to curb their own stimulation of such a host response,
  inducing one arm of the ER stress response while simultaneously suppressing another.
  E6 and E7 induce XBP-1, but are able to suppress COX-2. E5 alone in keratinocytes
  is able to suppress IRE1a, XBP-1, and COX-2. Together, E5, E6, and E7 exhibit an
  additive effect on COX-2 suppression.
