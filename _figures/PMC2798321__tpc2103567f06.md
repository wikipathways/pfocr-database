caption: Summary of the Effects of Nitrate, LBD37, 38, or 39, and PAP1 Overexpression
  on the Anthocyanin Biosynthesis Pathway.Anthocyanin-specific pathway steps in flavonoid
  metabolism are shown in a yellow background. Regulatory genes that were found to
  be considerably misexpressed in LBD OXs are shown in the yellow shaded box to the
  left. Black, blue, and purple circles mark the pathway steps/genes affected by NO3−,
  LBD37 OX, or PAP1 OX, respectively. Red arrows indicate repression and green arrows
  induction. The size of the circles gives an indication of the strength of the changes.
  Contents of cyanidin derivatives are low in N/NO3−-fed wild-type plants and N-limited
  LBD37, LBD38, and LBD39 OX lines and accumulate in N/NO3−-fed lbd37, lbd38, and
  lbd39 mutants and PAP1OXs (; ). Major quercetin- and kaempferol-glycosides were
  unchanged. PAL, phenylalanine ammonium lyase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; 4CL,
  4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; FLS, flavonol synthase; FGT, flavonol
  glycosyltransferase; BAN, anthocyanidin reductase BANYULS; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase;
  AGT, anthocyanin glycosyltransferase; AAT, anthocyanin acyltransferase. Pathways
  are depicted according to .
