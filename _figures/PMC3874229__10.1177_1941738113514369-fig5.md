caption: Crosstalk between chondrocyte and synoviocyte. Activation of signaling pathway
  either by mechanical injury or subinflammation produces cytokines, chemokines, and
  proteolytic enzymes that shift the homeostasis into a catabolic state. The expression
  of several matrix-degrading enzymes (metalloproteinase 1 [MMP-1], MMP-2, MMP-3,
  MMP-9, MMP-13) is increased and causes cartilage breakdown. Apoptosis seems to be
  mediated by proinflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species. Aged chondrocytes
  have an insufficient response to growth factor and hence fail to restore the cartilage.
  The degradation pathway stays on, and continuation of matrix degradation leads to
  the development of osteoarthritis.
