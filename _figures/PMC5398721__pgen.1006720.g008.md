caption: Schematic diagram depicting that Wnt and Netrin pathways orthogonally regulate
  PLM neurite branching. Secreted Wnt glycoproteins CWN-1, EGL-20 and CWN-2 are marked
  in orange and purple, respectively, which form discrete graded distribution along
  the anterior-posterior axis to regulate the stereotyped PLM branching pattern. It
  should be noted that, although shown to be distributed in a directional concentration
  gradient here, genetic experiments in this work suggest that EGL-20 functions somewhat
  independent of its expression patterns. UNC-6/Netrin acts through the DCC receptor
  UNC-40 to promote F-actin nucleation within a narrow zone along the anterior-posterior
  axis that is defined by the repulsive Wnt signaling at both ends. UNC-6, which is
  distributed in a concentration gradient that is high in the ventral, then promotes
  branch extension towards the ventral side.
