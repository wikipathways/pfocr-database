caption: Gal-1- and Gal-3 pathways promoting EMT in fibrosis. (a) Gal-1 promotes lung
  and sub-retinal fibrosis involving activation of a FAK/TGFR-β/Smad pathway, which
  in turn induces Gal-1 expression as positive feedback and is counteracted by Gal-1
  inhibitor OTX008. This pathway most likely includes activation of β1-integrins upstream
  FAK. Intracellular Gal-1 interacts with FAK1 suggesting an additional intracellular
  unknown role. Indeed, TGFR-β/Smad can be directly stimulated by TGF-β with similar
  effects. In retinal epithelial cells Gal-1 activates VEGFR2-ERK to promote subretinal
  fibrosis (b) or can enhance the EMT phenotype induced by TGF-β/Smad signaling (c).
  (d) Gal-1 expression is enhanced in a cellular model of diabetic retinopathy promoting
  EMT-associated fibrosis through an unknown mechanism, which can be blocked by OTX008.
  Gal-3 interacts with TGF-βR contributing to the TGF-β1-induced EMT involved in lung
  and renal fibrosis. The pathway includes β-catenin and can be blocked by Gal-3 inhibitors
  TD139 (e) and MCP (f)
