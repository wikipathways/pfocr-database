caption: Model for MAP kinase pathway regulation of gene expression and development.
  (A) The cAMP-signaling pathway may regulate the mak-2-related MAP kinase pathway
  to control aerial development or the two pathways may act independently. (B) Conidiophore
  development is repressed by the cAMP pathway directly or by its effect on the MAK-2
  pathway. On the basis of microarray and enhanced conidiation of the mutants, MAK-2
  exerts a stronger effect than PP-1 and MAK-2 may act through PP-1 and another (?)
  factor to repress conidiation. (C) Protoperithecial development and ascospore lethality
  depend on the MAK-2 pathway and is independent of cAMP signaling.
