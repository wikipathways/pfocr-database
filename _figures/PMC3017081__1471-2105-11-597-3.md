caption: Crosstalk between interleukin signalling pathways. Protein interaction sub-network
  containing the proteins annotated for 7 different Interleukin (IL)-related pathways
  from the BioCarta database (each colour represent a pathway, proteins annotated
  for multiple pathways display more than one colour). Proteins added by our method
  are highlighted by surrounding circles and coloured according to the pathway(s)
  they were added to (they appear mostly within peripheral clusters or as links between
  process members). They were not annotated for any of the IL-related pathways before
  applying the extension procedure, and the original pathway members did not become
  members in further IL-related pathways. Therefore, to simplify interpretation and
  provide a compact data representation, the node colours are only used to visualise
  the pathway memberships after the application of the extension procedure.
