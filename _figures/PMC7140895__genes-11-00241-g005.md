caption: The expression of genes in biosynthesis pathway of catechins, theanine, and
  caffeine under N, P, and K starvation. (a) The expression of genes in the catechins,
  biosynthetic pathway. CHS, CHI, F3H, F3′H, F3′5′H, DFR, FLS, ANS, LAR, and ANR indicate
  genes encoding chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase, flavonoid
  3′-hydroxylase, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, flavonol
  synthase, anthocyanidin synthase, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, and anthocyanidin
  reductase, respectively. (b) The expression of genes in the l-theanine biosynthetic
  pathway. GS, GOGAT, GDH, TS, AIDA, and ALT represent glutamine synthetase, glutamate
  synthetase, glutamate dehydrogenase, l-theanine synthetase l-arginine decarboxylase,
  and alanine transaminase, respectively. (c) The expression of genes in the caffeine
  biosynthetic pathway. 7-NMT, MXMT, TCS, SAMS and SAH indicate xanthosine methyltransferase,
  theobromine synthase (7-methylxanthine methyltransferase), caffeine synthase (3,7-dimethylxanthine
  methyltransferase). S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, and S-adenosylhomocysteine,
  respectively. * refers to the differentially expressed genes among these macronutrient
  nutrient starvation.
