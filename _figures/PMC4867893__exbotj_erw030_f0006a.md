caption: (A) Summary of metabolite abundance and 13C incorporation from the Calvin-Benson
  cycle to amino acids and sugars. Bar graphs show metabolite abundance in wild-type
  (blue) and mmdh1 (red) samples after 2h treatment under high or low CO2 conditions.
  The opacity (darkness of shading) indicates the degree of 13C incorporation. (B)
