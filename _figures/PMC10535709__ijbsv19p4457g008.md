caption: Study flowchart. MKL-1, functioning as a transcription factor, promoted the
  transcription of SLC3A2 and SLC7A11, the pivotal proteins of System Xc-. This led
  to an increase in the intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH), which in turn protected
  cancer cells from ferroptotic stress. Expression of MKL-1 was found to be suppressed
  by miR-149-5p, which also contributed to the process of ferroptosis in gastric cancer
  cells via this pathway. A further enhancement in the therapeutic effect of ferroptosis
  inducers on gastric cancer cells was achieved by constructing exosomes that overexpressed
  miR-149-5p and simultaneously transfected MKL-1 siRNA.
