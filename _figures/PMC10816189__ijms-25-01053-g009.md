caption: Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, with Zhuansihao serving as the control
  and 071113 as the experimental group. Three main precursor molecules of the lignin
  polymer are p-coumaroyl-CoA, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol. Among these,
  coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol have higher content levels in the dwarf 071113
  variety compared to the high-stalk Zhuansihao variety. Additionally, two key enzyme
  encoding genes, namely Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (4.3.1.24) and Peroxidase (1.11.1.7),
  show up-regulation in the dwarf 071113 variety compared to the high-stalk Zhuansihao
  variety
