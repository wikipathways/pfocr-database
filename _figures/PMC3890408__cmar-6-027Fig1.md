caption: 'Pathways regulating proliferation, survival, and cell death in BL.Notes:
  BL is associated with chromosomal translocations that deregulate expression of the
  proto-oncogene c-MYC. Specifically, c-MYC increases cell size and cell proliferation
  in part through transcriptional induction of numerous genes including cyclin D,
  cyclin-dependent kinases, and E2F, which release cells from the G1/S cell cycle
  checkpoint regulated by RB/e2F. The capacity to regulate a vast array of cellular
  genes and drive cell proliferation is tempered by the induction of oncogene-induced
  apoptosis and senescence mediated by the ARF/p53 tumor suppressor pathway and “intrinsic”
  apoptosis. Intrinsic, or mitochondrial, apoptosis is regulated by pro-apoptotic
  BH3-only members of the BCL-2 family (for example, BIM and PUMA). These proteins
  activate the mitochondrial membrane proteins BAX and BAK to induce the release of
  cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm and activation of the caspase
  cascade. At each point the effect of c-MYC can be regulated by cross-talk with other
  signaling pathways including the pro-proliferative, prosurvival PI3K/AKT pathway.
  The net outcome of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis versus proliferation and survival
  of B-cells carrying translocated c-MYC determines disease progression and lymphomagenesis.Abbreviations:
  PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; CDK4, cyclin-dependent kinase 4; HDM2, human double
