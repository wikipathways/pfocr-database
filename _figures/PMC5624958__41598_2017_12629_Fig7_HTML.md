caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed mechanism by which OCA may modulate the
  IL-6/Jak-2/STAT3 signalling pathway in HCC cells. FXR deficiency leads to activation
  of STAT3 pathway by increasing IL-1β which subsequently increases IL-6 levels. IL-6
  then binds to IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) leading to Jak-2 phosphorylation via glycoprotein
  130 (gp130) consequently activating STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 homodimers are
  then formed and translocated to the nucleus leading to the activation of many downstream
  target genes responsible for hepatic carcinogenesis such as SOCS3, the FXR target
  gene and the feedback inhibitor of STAT3.
