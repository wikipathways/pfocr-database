caption: Visualization of GO terms and DETs connected to the development of HFs in
  sheep. (A) Gene network diagram of biological process (BP) terms during HF morphogenesis
  in sheep. Red indicates joint effects across multiple BP terms, whereas blue indicates
  effects in a single BP term. The transcript numbers corresponding to the genes are
  listed in Supplementary Table S8. (B) Network visualization of Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and their associated genes during HF morphogenesis
  in sheep. (C) Occurrence of signaling pathways, including Wnt, Notch, PPAR, estrogen,
  metabolic pathway, cAMP, PI3K-Akt, necroptosis, and vascular smooth muscle contraction,
  during sheep wool follicle morphogenesis. GO and KEGG functional enrichment analyses
  on pathways potentially related to sheep HF growth and development at various phases.
  The visual network diagram is displayed in Supplementary Figure S1
