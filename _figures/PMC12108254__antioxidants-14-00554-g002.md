  the molecular cascades underlying its biological functions. Each signaling pathway
  was schematized and simplified to improve clarity and readability. Interactions
  between different pathways are highlighted using a color-coding system (e.g., AMPK
  activates NRF2 in pathway 1, and NRF2 activation continues in pathway 5). The numbering
  of the pathways corresponds to the paragraphs in Section 3. Arrows at the right-hand
  side of proteins and pathways indicate if their expression is increased (↑) or decreased
  (↓) by irisin. The figure was created using the image bank of Servier Medical Art
