caption: 'Retinoid regulation of early lung development. a At the onset of lung development,
  mesodermal RA signaling suppresses Dkk1 to allow induction of Wnt pathway and inhibits
  Tgf-beta signaling to de-repress Fgf10 expression. Thus, RA coordinately controls
  proper Fgf10 levels to activate Fgf signaling to the foregut endoderm and form the
  lung primordium. RA regulation of Tgf-beta effects in endoderm has also been suggested.
  b During airway formation, mesodermal (mesenchymal) RA signaling restricts SM gene
  expression (Acta2, Myh11, Tagln) in distal lung, preventing ectopic and excessive
  SM differentiation while airways are branching. RA may potentially inhibit a key
  activator of SM transcription or induce a transcriptional repressor to control SM
  gene expression (diagram: myocardin, serum response factor, CArG DNA binding sites
  at SM gene promoters). Modified from Chen et al. [, ]'
