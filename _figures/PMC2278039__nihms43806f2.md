caption: FIP200 functions to regulate diverse cellular processes, including cell proliferation,
  cell spreading, cell migration, cell growth and cell survival. FIP200 suppresses
  cell proliferation by regulation of p53-p21, Cyclin D1, Rb1 and FAK pathways; FIP200
  negatively regulates cell spreading and migration by its inhibition of FAK function;
  FIP200 promotes mTOR activation and cell growth through its interaction with TSC1-TSC2
  complex; FIP200 positively regulates cell survival by its inhibition of Pyk2 activity
  and regulation of TNFα-JNK signaling cascade (see text for details).
