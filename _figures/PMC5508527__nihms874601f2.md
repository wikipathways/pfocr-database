caption: During the early phase response, the Akt/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)/hypoxia
  inducible factor-1 (HIF-1α) pathway drives the induction of aerobic glycolysis by
  increasing the expression of glycolytic enzymes including lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH), the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
  (PDHK). PKM2 slows the conversion of PEP to pyruvate, so forces entry of glycolysis
  intermediates into the pentose phosphate pathway, whereas PHDK inhibits conversion
  of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A so blocks entry into the Krebs cycle and decreases
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Excess pyruvate is converted to lactate by LDH.
  During the adaptive catabolic phase, liver kinase B1 (LKB1), AMP activated protein
  kinase (AMPK), sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) are likely the key regulators
  that switch metabolism from aerobic glycolysis back to OXPHOS. Activation of AMPK
  leads to activation of Sirt1, which in turn activates Sirt6. Sirt6 blocks the effects
  of HIF-1α, thus ‘turning off’ aerobic glycolysis, whereas sirt1 and AMPK activate
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1-α (PGC-1α), which together
  with carnitin palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1), stimulates fatty acid oxidation to
  reconstitute mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. PGC-1α and the activation of mitophagy
  by AMPK and sirt1 further promote the coordination of cellular and mitochondrial
  DNA transcription to trigger biogenesis. ACC, acetyl co-enzyme A carboxylase; AMP,
  adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant
  molecule 1; NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized); NADH, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide (reduced); TH17, type 17 T helper; TNF, tumour necrosis factor;
  Treg, regulatory T cell.

  description: During the early phase response, the Akt/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)/hypoxia

    Activation of AMPK leads to activation of Sirt1, which in turn activates Sirt6.
