caption: Proposed model for m6A-induced ripening in tomato and strawberry fruits.
  a In climacteric tomato, SlALKBH2, an m6A demethylase, demethylates the m6A modifications
  on SlDML2 mRNA, which encodes a DNA demethylase gene required for tomato fruit ripening.
  SlDML2 can in turn regulate SLALKBH2 expression though DNA 5mC demethylation. b
  In non-climacteric strawberry fruit, m6A methyltransferases MTA and MTB target NCED5,
  ABAR, and AREB1 in the ABA biosynthesis or signaling pathway, enhancing mRNA stability
  of NCED5 and AREB1 as well as translation of ABAR; therefore, enhanced ABA biosynthesis
  and signaling positively regulate the ripening of strawberry fruit.
