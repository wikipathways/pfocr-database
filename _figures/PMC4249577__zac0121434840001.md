caption: Pantothenate/coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway of M. tuberculosis. The boxes
  represent proteins that catalyze the respective reactions depicted by arrows. The
  series of reactions from pyruvate to pantoate are abbreviated by a triple arrow.
  The H37Rv genes that encode the proteins are shown in italics. Metabolites that
  were found to antagonize the antitubercular activity of PZA are shown in boldface.
