caption: Schematic representation of the effects of IL-10 on OxPCs-induced OS-mediated
  lipid metabolic responses and cardiac dysfunction under stress conditions. Oxidation
  of phospholipids generates OxPCs and POVPC. Prolonged exposure to these stresses
  leads POVPC to further synthesize PAzPC and SAzPC, fragmented OxPCs compounds which
  upregulate oxidized LDL receptor (LOX-1). In vitro experiments using isolated adult
  rat cardiomyocytes treated with POVPC promoted oxidative stress (OS) in mutually
  supported manner. On the other hand, ex-vivo ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) experiments
  also suggest an increase in OxPCs along with alterations in lipid metabolic responses.
  Data suggest that increased PAzPC in the isolated cardiomyocytes or in I/R hearts
  may have interacted with LOX-1 to trigger cardiomyocyte-specific lipid metabolic
  responses and promoted lipid uptake. Co-localization study of troponin 1c and Cyt
  c suggest that increased SREBP1c activation is associated with their increase. It
  is known that SREBP 1c regulates TGF-β signaling pathway. We have earlier shown
  that I/R promoted TGF-β receptor II activation which in this study appears to be
  upregulated through LOX-1 mediated SREBP 1c activation. On the other hand, LOX-1
  activation by PAzPC and/or SAzPC may promote inflammation/innate responses through
  TLR2 activation. Role of PCSK9 is largely known to regulate lipid homeostasis. Increased
  PCSK9 by IL-10 may prevent LOX-1 induced changes in metabolic and inflammatory responses.
  Both PAzPC and SAzPC were greatly reduced by IL-10. Heatmap studies indicated PAzPC
  to be cardiomyocyte specific in isolated cell study as well as in whole heart whereas,
  SAzPC, also a fragmented OxPC is a non-cardiomyocyte specific response. SAzPC was
  also significantly modulated by IL-10 in the I/R injured heart suggesting that SAzPC
  may provide a cumulative effect together with PAzPC during injury promoted lipid
  uptake, inflammation, cell death and IL-10 prevents these deleterious effects.
