caption: (A) uPA upon binding with uPAR activates secretion of angiogenin. Angiogenin
  secreted by cancer cells and endothelial cells binds to a unknown endothelial receptor,
  forming an actin angiogenin complex and is translocated to the nucleus by a microtubule
  lysosomal independent pathway. Angiogenin is then transported to the nucleus where
  it interacts with fibrillarin in semi-confluent endothelial cells and activates
  45S rRNA ribosome gene synthesis. uPA interaction with uPAR also activates Ang-1
  in endothelial cells and this secreted Ang-1 by endothelial cells phosphorylates
  Tie-2 receptor and activates FKHR in the GRB2/Akt/BAD pathway. In panel B, in shRNA-transfected
  cells, as uPA and uPAR interaction is negligible, ANG secreted by endothelial cells
  is not translocated to the nucleus, 45S rRNA synthesis is inhibited, and ribonucleolytic
  activity of ANG is significantly retarded. Ang-1 induced Tie-2 phosphorylation,
  Forkhead in Rhabdosarcoma (FKHR) activation and the GRB2/AKT/ERK/BAD pathway was
  significantly retarded in shRNA-transfected endothelial cells.
