caption: Model of sublethal bifenthrin exposure on the mating and laying of female
  C. punctiferalis. Exposure to sublethal bifenthrin led to decreased sex pheromone
  production and mating efficiency by influencing the enzyme activities and metabolism
  product involving sex pheromone biosynthesis. Furthermore, sublethal bifenthrin
  exposure suppresses the JH signaling pathway by reducing the expression level of
  the Met and Kr-h1, resulting to developmental delays in ovarian maturation, reduced
  ovary size, and a significant decrease in egg production and hatchability
