caption: This report used four complementary materials and workflows to elucidate
  rivastigmine activity. a Interrelations of APP pathway metabolites and biomarkers
  (some are studied herein). Briefly, hAPP serves as substrate for several enzymes.
  Among these are the ADAM proteins, which begin as their proADAM protein counterparts,
  which are cleaved by Furin. hAPP is also cleaved by BACE1. The cleavages of hAPP
  produce the protein/peptide products sAPPα, sAPPβ, CTFα, and CTFβ. The total of
  sAPPα and sAPPβ, along with minor cleavage products, produce sAPPt. Cleavage of
  CTFα and CTFβ by γ-secretase complex produces P3 from CTFα, Aβ40 and Aβ42 from CTFβ,
  and AICD50 from both CTFα and CTFβ. In addition, the CTG assay assesses overall
  cell culture health. b Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell cultures were neuronally
  differentiated with NGF and then treated with Rivatigmine and TAPI, alone and in
  combination in media. Conditioned media (CM) was collected and cells were harvested
  and lysed. Lysate was used to assess cell culture health by CTG, while CM was assayed
  for protein and peptide levels by western blot (WB) and ELISA. c Primary human brain
  (PHB) cultures were grown according to protocols developed in our laboratory. PHB
  cultures were treated with rivastigmine and TAPI, alone and in combination. CM was
  collected and cells harvested and lysed. Culture health was assessed by CTG, and
  both lysates and CM were used in western blots and ELISA. d Female 3 × Tg mice were
  grown to 6 months and injected IP with rivastigmine or saline. Hippocampus was harvested
  and lysed to use in western blots and ELISA. e Donated human autopsy brain tissue
  was collected from patients who had AD without drug treatment, AD with rivastigmine
  treatment, and non-AD subjects. Tissues were lysed and levels of peptides and proteins
  assayed by ELISA.
