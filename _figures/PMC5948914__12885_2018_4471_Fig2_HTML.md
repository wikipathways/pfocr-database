caption: Schematic diagram of gemcitabine pharmacologic pathway. Key genes that are
  directly involved in the gemcitabine pharmacologic pathway are shown. Genes in blue
  have been studied or tested with NSCLC patient samples previously in other publications.
  Other genes are found from our pathway-based approach. Nine membrane transporters
  that are included in this study are also shown in this diagram i.e. ABCC10, ABCC5,
  ABCG2, SLC28A1, SLC28A2, SLC28A3, SLC29A1, SLC29A2 and SLC29A3. The six SNPs which
  belong to six genes (in red box) were selected as final candidate SNPs in our study
papertitle: Discovering novel SNPs that are correlated with patient outcome in a Singaporean
  cancer patient cohort treated with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.
