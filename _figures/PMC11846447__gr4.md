caption: 'Schematic representation of muscle protein regulation through the mTOR pathway.Abbreviations:
  4E-BP1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1; Akt(PKB), protein kinase
  B; BFR, Blood Flow Restriction; ES, Electrical Stimulation; FT, fast-twitch muscle
  fibers; GH, Growth Hormone; IGF-1, Insulin-like growth factor-1; mTOR, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin; mTORC1, mTOR Complex 1; mTORC2, mTOR Complex 2; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; S6K, ribosomal protein S6 Kinase.Mechanical tension and metabolic stress
  induced by blood flow restriction training leads to activation of PI3K, which in
  turn activates Akt; Akt further directly activates mTORC1 through phosphorylation
  and inhibition of TSC2. mTORC1 activation marks the initiation of protein synthesis
  because mTORC1 phosphorylates its downstream effector molecules 4E-BP1 and S6K1.
  4E-BP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 initiates translation initiation; S6K1 activates
  ribosomal protein S6 after phosphorylation by mTORC1. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1
  by mTORC1 initiates translation initiation; after S6K1 is phosphorylated by mTORC1,
  S6K1 activates ribosomal protein S6, which increases the translation efficiency
  of mRNA and promotes protein synthesis. Electrical stimulation also promotes muscle
  protein synthesis via the AKT/mTOR pathway, and also inhibits the FoxO transcription
  factor by reducing its nuclear translocation, thereby inhibiting the activity of
  the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which reduces the expression of genes related
  to protein hydrolysis and inhibits protein catabolism'
