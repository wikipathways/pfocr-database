caption: A concise summary of the implicated molecular mechanisms that mediated the
  ameliorative effects of camel milk in cyclosporine‐induced nephrotoxicity in rats.
  The present study reveals that camel milk attenuates cyclosporine‐induced nephrotoxicity
  through (a) Suppression of renal oxidative stress, as demonstrated by lowering MDA
  and the pro‐oxidant NOX‐1. The curtailing of the oxidative stress resulted in the
  restoration of Nrf2/HO‐1 pathway that was otherwise upregulated as a compensatory
  mechanism in response to the cyclosporine insult. (b) Augmentation of the antioxidant
  machinery, as evidenced by increasing the levels of GSH, GPx, and SOD. (c) Activation
  of the upstream AKT/eNOS/NO pathway, as evidenced by upregulated expression of PI3K,
  p‐AKT(Ser473)/total AKT, and p‐eNOS (Ser1177)/total eNOS ratios and increased levels
  of the vasodilator NO. (d) Suppression of the oxidative stress and activation of
  the AKT/eNOS/NO pathway, at least in part, converged for the dampening of renal
  cellular apoptosis, as proven with lowered caspase‐3 cleavage/activity and downregulated
  expression of the pro‐apoptotic Bax, with upregulation of the proliferation signal
  PCNA. The solid arrow (activation); blunt arrow (inhibition)
