caption: 'Relationships between pro-inflammatory cytokines and bone signaling pathways
  affecting osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis.Several signaling pathways mediate
  osteoblast differentiation, with the TGF-β, BMP, FGF, IGF-1, Wnt, and NF-κB pathways
  being among the most important (left). TGF-β and BMP signaling regulate osteoblast-specific
  gene expression through multiple SMAD proteins. FGF and IGF-1 can regulate osteoblast
  differentiation via downstream pathways such as PI3K-AKT and MAPK. Wnt binds to
  receptors, causing β-catenin to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus, where
  it causes transcription of target genes. Osteoblast differentiation is inhibited
  by NF-κB signaling with inhibition of SMAD protein activity. The signaling pathways
  ultimately lead to the regulation of important transcription factors such as RUNX
  2, OSX and others, which are essential for the production of specific proteins and
  osteoblast differentiation. M-CSF, RANKL-RANK, and NF-κB are important molecules
  and signaling pathways in osteoclastogenesis (right). M-CSF-induced activation results
  in enhanced osteoclast precursor proliferation and survival through the MAPK and
  PI3K-AKT pathways. Binding of RANKL to RANK leads to the recruitment of TRAF6 proteins
  that transduce the signal to downstream targets such as NF-κB or MAPKs. RANKL also
  activates the PI3K-AKT pathway through TRAF6. In addition, RANKL signaling induces
  NFATc1, a major transcription factor for osteoclast terminal differentiation, which
  regulates several osteoclast-specific genes, including TRAP or CatK. Pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and CRP are involved in the pathogenesis of
  chronic inflammation, a key feature of DM and associated complications (top). TNF-α
  and IL-1β act through several pathways including the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs.
  IL-6 signals via JAK–STAT pathway. CRP can interact with cell surface receptors
  and initiate various intracellular signaling cascades. The pro-inflammatory cytokines
  mentioned above interfere with signaling pathways of osteoblasts and osteoclasts,
  thereby influencing their development and functions. Additionally, they also up-regulate
  DKK-1 and SOST, which inhibit Wnt signaling pathway. IL-1β is able to inhibit OPG
  production. Flavonols, such as quercetin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol, are able
  to inhibit the expression and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce their
  negative impact. Blunt red arrows indicate an inhibitory effect, sharp green arrows
  designate a stimulatory effect. The most common signal transduction is indicated
  by gray arrows. Green arrows upwards mean increased - stimulated production of molecules,
  red arrows downwards mean reduced - inhibited production of molecules. AKT: protein
