caption: Anti-autophagic and anti-apoptotic pathway activated in human DCs by P. gingivalis
  and its fimbria proteins. Targeting the receptor DC-SIGN on human DCs by P. gingivalis
  Mfa1 fimbria results in the activation of Akt, which phosphorylates and inactivates
  FOXO1 resulting in anti-apoptotic DCs phenotype, thereby extending the lifespan
  of host DCs. The activation of Akt results also in activation of Akt/mTOR signaling
  axis, which inhibits antimicrobial autophagic machinery in human DCs, resulting
  in survival of intracellular P. gingivalis.
