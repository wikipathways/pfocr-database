caption: Tracing the flow of 13C carbon from [1-13C] /[1,6-13C] Glc through primary
  metabolic pathway for the formation of functional groups present in limonoids. (a)
  tiglate group present in azadirachtin and salannin is traced through isoleucine
  biosynthetic pathways. (b) isovalerate group present in salannolacetate is traced
  through leucine biosynthetic pathway
papertitle: Tracing the biosynthetic origin of limonoids and their functional groups
  through stable isotope labeling and inhibition in neem tree (Azadirachta indica)
  cell suspension.
