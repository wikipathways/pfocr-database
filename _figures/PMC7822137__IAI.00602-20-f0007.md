caption: A proposed model of PrtR involved in transitions between acute and chronic
  infections. PrtR-mediated T3SS and pyocin regulation was reported in a previous
  study (). In response to environmental signals, the expression of PrtR was repressed,
  and thus levels of LadS, GacA and GacS, and RsmY and RsmZ are elevated, which in
  turn antagonize the activity of RsmA, resulting in a shift toward the biofilm-associated
  phenotype. We also find that PrtR interacts with SiaD and thus regulates intracellular
  c-di-GMP levels. PrtR involved in biofilm formation is dependent on SiaD and c-di-GMP
  concentrations. The regulatory pathways identified in the present study are represented
  by red lines.
