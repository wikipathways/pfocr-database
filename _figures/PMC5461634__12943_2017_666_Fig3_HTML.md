caption: Sub-network of cell cycle pathway regulated by C1orf132 and TMPO-AS1. a The
  triangles represent lncRNAs. The circles represent the cell cycle pathway genes.
  Nodes with red and green color represent that the genes or lncRNAs were up-regulated
  and down-regulated in high-risk LUAD patients compared with low-risk LUAD patients.
  The gray circles represent the genes that directly interact with differentially
  expressed genes in the cell cycle pathway, which are marked by gray lines. The orange
  lines represent the significantly co-expressed relationships between lncRNAs and
  differentially expressed genes. b Expression correlation between C1orf132 and CCND3.
  c Expression correlation between C1orf132 and RBL2. The P values were calculated
  using Pearson Correlation test in (b) and (c)
