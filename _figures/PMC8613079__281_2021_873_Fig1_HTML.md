caption: Pathways of complement activation. A The classical and lectin pathways are
  activated by the PRRs, C1Q and MBL/ficolins respectively, which recognise PAMPs
  and DAMPS such as bound antibodies, dead cells and foreign or altered carbohydrates.
  PRR-associated proteases cleave C2 and C4, which form the C3 convertase, and subsequently
  cleave C3 into C3b and the anaphylatoxin C3a. C3b itself associates with C4bC2b
  to form the C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 into the potent anaphylatoxin C5a, and
  C5b. C5b then associates with complement components 6-9. Poly-C9 forms a membrane-breaching
  pore that can directly lyse gram-negative bacteria. B The alternative pathway is
  initiated by spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 to C3H2O, to which FB can bind. Subsequent
  conformational changes allow serum protease FD cleave FB to Bb, and C3H2OBb is the
  initial alternative pathway C3 convertase. FB also forms a convertase with subsequent
  C3b products, causing amplification unless regulated by FH. Incorporation of C3b
  into the C3 convertase allows cleavage of C5, ultimately leading to MAC formation.
  The alternative pathway is also involved in amplification of the classical and lectin
  pathways. Previously, C2b was referred to as C2a (). For further details, see text
