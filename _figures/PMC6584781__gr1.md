caption: Signaling pathways that converge on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) activation and formation of plexiform-like lesions in pulmonary arterial
  hypertension (PAH). In both hypoxia (Hx) and monocrotaline (MCT) animal models and
  in human disease, p38 MAPK signaling through IL-6 provides a link between vascular
  remodeling and inflammation. IL-6 activates STAT3 in a process dependent on serine
  phosphorylation by p38 kinase and tyrosine phosphorylation by Src. STAT3 activation
  in both human and experimental models of PAH accounts for the modulation of the
  expression of several proteins implicated in PAH pathogenesis. Protein components
  of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway have been implicated
  as potential biomarkers in experimental models and human PAH; however, the signaling
  pathways involved are not clear. Interestingly, in cancer cells, a link between
  VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and p38 kinase has been reported.,  VEGF, acting through its
  receptor, activates p38 MAPK; and induces expression of erythroblast transformation–specific
  1 (ETS1), an important trans regulator of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) genes, including
  MMP9. During hypoxia, activation of p38 MAPK signaling is likely to prevent prolyl
  hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) from hydroxylating proline residues of hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF), leading to its activation. Finally, intersectin (ITSN) deficiency
  and the Epsin15-homology domain fragment of ITSN (EHITSN) expression trigger a pathogenic
  p38 MAPK/Elk1 signaling pathway, leading to plexiform lesion formation in severe
  PAH. As EHITSN localizes to the nucleus, a direct effect on transcription factors
  cannot be ruled out. GrB, granzyme B; Su-Hx-Nx, a model in which, after a single
  injection of Sugen5416 and 3 weeks of hypobaric Hx, the rats were returned to normoxia
  for 10 to 11 weeks; Tg, transgenic; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.
