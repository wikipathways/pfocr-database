caption: Pathways of Oxidative Stress in DR. Retinal hyperglycemia triggers multiple
  mechanisms that culminate in oxidative stress, as described from left to right in
  the figure. Dysregulated autophagy disrupts retinal antioxidant mechanisms, leading
  to an imbalance between the production of ROS and antioxidant activity. Hyperglycemia
  further enhances ROS production and affects various metabolic pathways in the retina,
  including the polyol pathway, hexosamine pathway, formation of advanced glycation
  end products (AGEs), and the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. These pathways promote
  oxidative stress, and elevated levels of ROS, in turn, further activating these
  pathways, creating a detrimental cycle of oxidative stress in DR. Additionally,
  hyperglycemia contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress, which perpetuate oxidative stress in the retina. The high levels of
  oxidative stress result in increased lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis
  of retinal cells, which are characteristic features of DR.
