caption: Therapeutic mechanism of salvianolic acid B diagram (salvianolic acid B may
  inhibit melanin synthesis by increasing the activity of SOD and GSH-Px, reducing
  the production of ROS, modulating the MAPK signaling pathway to reduce the activity
  of ERK, JNK, or p38, and down-regulating the expression of MITF, or modulating the
  NF-kB signaling pathway to down-regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  such as TNF-α, to regulate inflammatory responses, which may inhibit the activity
  of melanocytes and decrease the melanin synthesis)
