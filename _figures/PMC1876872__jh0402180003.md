caption: The HBV life cycle. Entry of the HBV virion into the cell is a poorly defined
  process that is presumably receptor-mediated and leads to uncoating and transport
  of the capsid to the nucleus, where evidence suggests disassembly occurs, releasing
  the open circular viral genome into the nucleus where the second strand is completed
  and the ends of each strand are ligated. This leads to the production of a covalently
  closed circular DNA (cccDNA) molecule, which is the transcriptional template of
  the virus. Pol II-driven transcription results in production of the 4 viral RNAs
  that are thought to be actively transported out of the nucleus via shared sequences
  at the 3′ end of the transcripts that apparently interact with cellular RNA export
  proteins. Once in the cytoplasm, the transcripts are translated into the corresponding
  proteins as shown. The precore protein contains a leader sequence that transports
  it into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is further processed and eventually
  secreted as HBeAg. The envelope proteins traverse the ER membrane as integral membrane
  proteins as shown. The core and polymerase proteins assemble around the pregenomic
  RNA (pRNA) to form HBV RNA-containing capsids within which the RNA is reverse transcribed
  to produce the first strand viral DNA that serves as the template for second strand
  DNA synthesis. While the RNA-containing capsid is maturing into a DNA-containing
  capsid it migrates bidirectionally within the cytoplasm. One pathway terminates
  at the ER membrane where it interacts with the envelope proteins which trigger an
  internal budding reaction resulting in the formation of virions that are transported
  out of the cell by the default secretory pathway. The second pathway transports
  the maturing capsid to the the nucleus to amplify the pool of cccDNA.
