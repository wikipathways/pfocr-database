caption: Possible mechanisms involved in the association between blood KP metabolites
  and Aβ in high NAL participants. Elevated blood kynurenine (KYN), anthranilic (AA),
  and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) concentrations in individuals with high neocortical
  amyloid-β load (NAL) [] potentially have increased KYN, AA, and 3-HK concentrations
  in the brain, given that blood KYN, AA, and 3-HK concentrations account for ~ 60%
  of the brain pools of these metabolites, given their permeability to the blood-brain
  barrier []. This increase in the kynurenine pathway (KP) intermediate substrates
  could result in increased microglial activation which in turn can result in the
  secretion of inflammatory signalling molecules, which further trigger amyloid-β
  generation and immune responses, resulting in a vicious cycle. Further, immune responses
  such as interferon-γ activate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase result in increased tryptophan
  degradation and increased KP metabolites
