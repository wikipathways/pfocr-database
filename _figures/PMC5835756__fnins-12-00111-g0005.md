caption: Proposed role of PERK signaling pathway in SBI after ICH. The PERK signaling
  pathway is activated by ICH, resulting in increased p-eIF2α and ATF4 protein levels.
  The consequent activation of the ER stress response induces neuronal apoptosis,
  which is blocked by application of the PERK inhibitor GSK2606414. On the contrary,
  activation of PERK downstream signaling pathway by salubrinal promotes apoptosis
  and reduces neuronal survival by blocking eIF2α dephosphorylation.
