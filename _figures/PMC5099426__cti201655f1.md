caption: IDO/TDO-based HCC development and progression following persistent HCV infection.
  Persistent HCV infection leads to chronic inflammation, which recruits immune cells
  expressing IDO such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MΦ) to the liver.
  This increases the levels of IDO in the liver, which along with TDO participates
  in the catabolism of Trp into metabolites such as Kyn, kynurenic acid and xanthurenic
  acid that can activate AhR signalling. Elevated levels of AhR ligands, in particular
  Kyn, engage with AhR on naive CD4+ T cells present in the liver. AhR signalling
  possibly coupled with signalling from cytokines such as transforming growth factor
  (TGF)-β leads to differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells to Tregs that can suppress
  immune responses that can prevent formation of HCC. We hypothesize that this immune
  suppression pathway leads to the establishment of HCC. HCC also express AhR, which
  following activation contributes to HCC progression. Furthermore, DC also express
  AhR and activation of this receptor on DC is known to increase IDO expression, which
  can also contribute to immune suppression using the illustrated pathway. The yellow
  arrows indicate up/downregulation of metabolites or a process. Furthermore, red
  arrows indicate catabolic enzymatic reaction of Trp, which leads to elevated AhR
  signalling, and the black arrows are now exclusively present to indicate the direction
  of the flow of the diagram.
