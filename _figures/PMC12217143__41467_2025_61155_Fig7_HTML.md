caption: FASII pathway generates short FA chains, C14:0. From Amiar et al. 14, we
  know that apicoplast FAs can be esterified on a G3P backbone by ATS1 to form LPA,
  which exit the apicoplast to reach the ER via an unknown pathway. This exported
  LPA serves for phospholipids synthesis and FAs are elongated by the three ER elongases
  ELO A/B/C. This study suggests the role of TgFLP12 as an FFA exporter that allows
  the exit of FA C14:0/C16:0 from the apicoplast to ER to be elongated/desaturated
  and incorporate in bulk PL or storage lipids preventing toxic accumulation and disruption
  of the apicoplast. G3P = glycerol-3-phosphate; FASII = fatty acid synthesis pathway
  type II; FFA = free fatty acid; ATS1 = acyltransferase 1; LPA = lysophosphatidic
  acid; ELO = elongases
