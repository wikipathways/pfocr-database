caption: Insulin can inhibit Foxo1 transcriptional activity through Irs1/2→PI3K→Akt
  pathway to phosphorylate Foxo1. As a transcription factor, Foxo1 can activate one
  set of genes including Ppargc1a, Pck1, G6pc, and Igfbp1 and directly or indirectly
  suppress another set of genes including Ghr, Igf1, Onecut1, and Gck. Through regulation
  of Ghr gene expression, Foxo1 also influences expression of growth hormone-regulated
  genes including Igf1, Igfals and Onecut1. Moreover, in response to insulin and growth
  hormone signals, Onecut1 can impact on nutrient metabolism through activation of
  Foxa2 and Gck gene expression and suppression of Pck1 gene expression. Fonts in
  bold indicate protein molecules and fonts in italic indicate mRNA molecules. Arrows
  indicate activation and blunted lines represent inhibition. Solid lines or arrows
  indicate reported links in the literature and dotted lines or arrows indicate implicated
  links from this current study.
