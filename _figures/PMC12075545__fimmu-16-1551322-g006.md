caption: IFN-γ-mediated suppression of ANGPT2-Tie2 in endothelial cells facilitates
  tumor vascular normalization during immunotherapy. Diagrammatic representation of
  the mechanism by which PD-L1 blockade therapy modulates IFN-γ to influence the tumor
  vasculature in ECs through the ANGPT2-Tie2 signaling pathway. IFN-γ motivates the
  JAK1/2-STAT1 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the expression of ANGPT2 and
  Tie2. Following this process, phosphorylated STAT1 binds to the promoter regions
  of the TEK and ANGPT2 genes, thereby suppressing their gene expression. Furthermore,
  IFN-γ phosphorylates FOXO1 through activating the PI3K-AKT pathway, thereby reducing
  the nuclear activation of FOXO1 on the ANGPT2 gene. Consequently, the synthesis
  of the Tie2 and ANGPT2 proteins is diminished, contributing to the suppression of
  the ANGPT2-Tie2 signaling pathway. This effect subsequently suppresses the migration,
  proliferation, and tube formation of ECs, ultimately contributing to the suppression
  of tumor angiogenesis and vascular destabilization
