caption: Immune response model for trans-sialidase (TS)-based vaccines. In the immunization
  of mice with vaccines based on recombinant TS, exogenous antigens are usually processed
  and presented by antigen presenting cells (APC) via MHC class II, recognized by
  CD4 T cells. This pathway will stimulate B cells to produce and secrete TS-specific
  antibodies (Humoral response). Certain types of APC such as dendritic cells can
  process and present exogenous antigens via MHC class I, recognized by CD8 T cells,
  a process known as cross-priming. Both TS-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells can differentiate
  into cells with cytotoxic activity capable of killing Trypanosoma cruzi-infected
  cells as macrophage (Effector response). In addition, a group of specific-TS CD4
  T cells (Foxp3) known as regulatory T cells are responsible for controlling the
  pro-inflammatory response in the host (Regulatory response). The immunization of
  animals with vaccines based on TS has reduced parasitemia, tissue damage and consequently
  the mortality rate.
