caption: Schematic model of the inhibitory ability of tubercidin against PRRSV. Tubercidin
  blocked three steps of viral life cycle, including binding, replication, and release,
  and decreased the nsp2 expression to inhibit PRRSV replication. Additionally, tubercidin
  could promote the activation of RIG-I/NF-κB signaling pathway and increase the expression
  of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines, leading to PRRSV inhibition
