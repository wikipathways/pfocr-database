caption: 'A simplified scheme for the regulation of cardiac selective autophagy in
  HFD-induced metabolic cardiomyopathy. ER-phagy, mitophagy, and ferritinophagy are
  implicated in the development HFD-induced metabolic cardiomyopathy. The PINK1/Parkin
  ubiquitin-mediated mitophagy pathway, which involves factors such as H19, ACC2,
  BRD4, SQSTM1, Nampt, and SERP2, is inhibited, and the alternative Ulk1-Rab9-dependent
  mitophagy pathway is activated. Panels a and b, respectively, are cited from [37,109],
  and depict the changes in autophagy regulated by the ULK/Rab9 and Atg7/LC3 pathways
  during the HFD intervention. ER stress, as evidenced by a significant increase in
  the protein levels of PERK, IRE1α, ATF6α and CHOP, was activated in the diabetic
  rat heart. Although the effect has not been demonstrated in rodent models, HG treatment
  has been shown to enhance ER-phagy (upregulation of Sec62 and RTN3 and downregulation
  of FAM134B) in H9c2 cells. This finding is corroborated by the upregulation of Sec62
  and RTN3, as well as the downregulation of FAM134B. HFD significantly increases
  ferritinophagy by activating the STAT3/NCOA4/FTH1 axis, which promotes ferroptosis
  due to iron overload. Solid lines represent proven mechanisms, dotted lines represent
  unknown mechanisms. Targeted agents enclosed in yellow oval boxes are connected
  to therapeutic targets by blue lines. (↓: stimulatory modification, ⫰: inhibitory
