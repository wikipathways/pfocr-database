caption: Proposed GPR40 and PPARγ integrated signal transduction pathway in human
  endothelial cells. In the classical PPARγ signaling pathway, RGZ binds directly
  to PPARγ, inducing a conformational change that results in its dissociation from
  co-repressors (not depicted), such as nuclear co-repressor and histone deacetylases,
  and the recruitment of co-activators, including PGC1α and EP300. However, as shown
  here, RGZ and other PPARγ ligands also bind to and activate GPR40 on the cell surface,
  resulting in p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which in turn phosphorylates and thereby
  activates both PGC1α and EP300. As noted, PGC1α deacetylation by SIRT1 is also essential
  for its activation. Phosphorylation releases PGC1α from its repressor p160MBP and
  leads to a conformational change, permitting PGC1α to dock with PPARγ and recruit
  newly activated EP300. EP300 is a histone acetyltransferase that remodels local
  chromatin and enhances gene transcription. The activated PPARγ complex thus heterodimerizes
  with retinoid X receptor, which binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements
  in accessible promoters, inducing the transcription of target genes.
