caption: Various mechanisms of adverse immune activation by COVID-19 vaccines. The
  viral S protein, either as mRNA or recombinant, adenovector-DNA, is endocytosed
  through Toll-like receptors (TLR) present on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These
  endosomes trigger intracellular signaling pathways that result in the activation
  of Interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7) and nuclear factor k B (NFkB) networks.
  Activated IRF7 and NFkB upregulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6
  and TNFα. Alternatively, the viral components can escape from the endosome and trigger
  the cGAS signaling pathway, which activates STING/IRF3 network that ultimately results
  in the upregulation of proinflammatory type I interferons (IFN) response. Finally,
  the viral nucleic acids are translated into peptides and presented by the APC to
  activate T cells through the T cell receptor (TcR). Activation of naïve T cells
  results in the production of cytokines. Exposure to IL-4 skews the naïve T cells
  to an anti-inflammatory, Th2-type T cells that produce IL-3, IL-5, and IL-9, all
  of which can activate mast cells to elicit an allergic/anaphylactic reaction. In
  contrast, exposure to IL-12 and IFNγ polarizes the naïve T cells into Th1-type cells,
  which contributes to the proinflammatory response. Apart from the viral-derived
  molecules, vaccine adjuvants, such as CpG, can be recognized by TLR on the APC,
  with further activation of the NFkB pathway, leading to the production of inflammatory
  response. The viral nucleic acids also form a complex with platelet factor-4 (PF4)
  produced by the blood platelets. This complex activates Ag-specific B cells to produce
  anti-DNA/PF4 complex IgG, which binds with the FCγRIIa receptor on the platelets
  and activates these cells to form aggregates, leading to vaccine-induced thrombotic
  thrombocytopenia (VITT). Thus, both APCs and platelets play divergent roles in mounting
  immune dysregulation upon exposure to viral antigens and/or adjuvants. Image created
