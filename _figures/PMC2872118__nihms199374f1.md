caption: a, Native catalytic cycle. The SAT domain in PksA selects a hexanoyl starter
  unit. The MAT domain loads the free ACP with malonyl units. After seven successive
  condensation events with malonyl-ACP catalysed in KS, the linear ACP-bound polyketide
  6 is cyclized (C4–C9 and C2–C11 cyclization events) and aromatized in the product
  template (PT) domain to give the bicyclic intermediate 7. The TE catalyses C-C cyclization
  to release anthrone (1), which undergoes oxidation to the anthraquinone norsolorinic
  acid (2), to initiate the complex biosynthetic pathway to aflatoxin B1 (3). Asterisks
  denote the C and O nucleophiles involved in on-path and off-path cyclizations, respectively.
  b, In the absence of TE, the PT product 7 undergoes spontaneous O-C cyclization
  to norpyrone (4). The PT monodomain structure was solved with intermediate/product
  mimic 5 (HC8). c, Conversions from 6 to 7 via intermediates 8, 9 and 10.
