caption: The global molecular associations of the high-fat responsive genes are functionally
  characterized and divided into networks based on the functions and/or diseases that
  are most significant to the network objects (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis). Depicted
  is the result of merging the network 1 (Immune Response, Tissue Development, Skeletal
  and Muscular System Development and Function), network 2 (Cellular Development,
  Connective Tissue Development and Function, Lipid Metabolism) and network 4 (Hepatic
  System Disease, Liver Steatosis, Cancer). The overrepresented “Function and disease”
  (Fx) categories “immune response” and “hepatic steatosis” are overlaid onto resulting
  network, showing which genes (nodes) are directly involved in these processes. The
  interactions between nodes that are directly connected to both processes are highlighted
  in pink. Color coding of the nodes corresponds to the direction of gene expression
  changes at day 3 in HFBT vs. chow diet comparison (upregulated genes are shown in
  red and downregulated in green).
