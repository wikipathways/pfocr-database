caption: RIPK signaling. TNFR1 recruits RIPK1, TRADD, TRAF2, and cIAP1/2. cIAP1/2
  initiates the ubiquitination process on complex I. The K63 Ub chain of RIPK1 links
  molecules in the large TNF complex I. The TAK1 complex phosphorylates IKKβ to induce
  NF-κB activation. When NF-κB, the complex of cIAP1/2, or LUBAC, TAK1, or TBK1 is
  inhibited, membrane-bound complex I is dissociated and complex II is formed. If
  NF-κB is inhibited, TRADD, FADD and caspase-8 form complex IIa, inducing RIPK1-independent
  apoptosis. When inhibition of cIAP1/2, TAK1, TBK1, or LUBAC occurs, RIPK1, FADD,
  caspase-8, and c-FLIPL form complex IIb, inducing RIPK1-dependent apoptosis. Procaspase-8/cFLIPL
  heterodimers prevent necroptosis. Upon caspase-8 inhibition, complex IIb initiates
  RIPK1- and RIPK3-dependent necroptosis. Activated RIPK1 heterodimerizes with RIPK3
  and RIPK3 phosphorylates MLKL, thereby driving the polymerization of RIPK1, RIPK3
  and MLKL. This RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL complex is called a “necrosome.” In macrophages/microglia,
  LPS or poly(I:C) is recognized by TLR4 and mediates the interaction between TRIF
  and RIPK3. In the presence of caspase inhibitor, the TRIF/RIPK3 complex induces
  ROS accumulation, and subsequently triggers necroptosis independent of NF-κB activation.
  TLR4 also recruits MyD88 and cIAPs to activate the NF-κB pathway, thereby inducing
  pro-inflammatory cytokines. TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TNFR1, TNFα receptor
