caption: Major metabolic pathways (the Wood Ljungdahl pathway, the TCA cycle, the
  pyruvate metabolism) and carbon transition identified in P7 strain. The cells were
  grown in basal medium containing Na13HCO3 with syngas (Test 3, Table ). Cells were
  harvested at day 6 and subjected to proteinogenic amino acids labelling analysis.
  Re-citrate synthase (marked as brown), pyruvate carboxylase (marked as blue), fumarate
  hydratase (Marked as green), and malate dehydrogenase (marked as red, malate → pyruvate + CO2)
  were annotated as the key enzymes for the TCA pathway. Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway
  (EMP); phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP); ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P).
