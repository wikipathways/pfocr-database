caption: Mechano-transduction pathways regulating YAP/TAZ activity. This schematic
  shows how mechanical signals—such as ECM stiffness, mechanical stretch, and shear
  stress—modulate YAP/TAZ activity via Hippo-dependent and independent pathways. The
  Hippo pathway’s core kinases, MST1/2 and LATS1/2, respond to mechanical cues to
  regulate YAP/TAZ phosphorylation and localization. Alternatively, these mechanical
  stimuli can bypass the kinase cascade, influencing YAP/TAZ localization through
  cytoplasmic and nuclear actin dynamics
