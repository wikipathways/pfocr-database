caption: 'The regulation of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway in malignant pleural mesothelioma
  (MPM) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hippo kinase, including NF2 and LATS1/LATS2,
  phosphorylate yes-associated protein (YAP) in the cytoplasm and lead to the degradation
  of YAP. In MPM, genetic mutations with loss of function in NF2, LATS1/LATS2, SAV1
  and RASSF frequently occur, which leads to the degradation of YAP in the cytoplasm.
  Therefore, more YAP proteins translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription
  of downstream genes by forming complexes with transcriptional enhancer factors (TEAD),
  and promote tumorigenesis of MPM. In some NSCLC cells with high potential for drug
  resistance and metastasis, YAP expression increases at the protein level in the
  cytoplasm, and more YAP proteins translocate into the nucleus, which activates downstream
  genes including CTGF, cyr61 or other EGF expression genes, and then form autocrine
  loops to activate oncogenic pathways, such as MAPK signaling, which would inhibit
  the Hippo kinase. Therefore, the formation of these autocrine loops enhances YAP
  signaling, which promotes tumor cell proliferation, drug resistance and metastasis
  in NSCLC. Abbreviations: NF2, neurofibromatosis 2; LATS1, large tumor suppressor
  homolog 1; MST1, mammalian sterile-20 like kinase 1; SAV1, protein salvador homolog
  1; RASSF, Ras-association domain family.'
