caption: A model depicting a novel mechanism by which cetuximab induces autophagy.
  Activation of EGFR/class I PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by EGF suppresses autophagy
  whereas inhibition of the pathway by cetuximab induces autophagy. Cetuximab downregulates
  HIF-1α, and subsequently decreases Bcl-2, which releases beclin 1 from its association
  with Bcl-2 to form complex with class III PI3K/hVps34 (directed with a dashed line);
  the latter complex thereby promotes autophagy. The arrow lines indicate the direction
  of pathways. The ⊥ symbolizes an inhibitory function by an agent or a molecule.
  The question mark implies additional mechanisms not explored in current study, by
  which HIF-1α may suppress autophagy.
