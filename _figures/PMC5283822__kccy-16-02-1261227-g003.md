caption: Ubiquitylation events during TC-NER. CSB is ubiquitylated by the CSA-CUL4
  E3 ligase causing its p97-mediated segregation and proteasomal degradation. This
  process is counteracted by the UVSSA-USP7 complex that catalyzes the deubiquitylation
  of CSB. Removal of CSB is an important step handing over the damage site for damage
  verification. The RBP1 subunit of RNA Pol II undergoes K63-linked ubiquitylation,
  which is brought about by a two-step reaction involving NEDD4 and the Elongin E3
  ligase complex. Ubiquitylated Polymerase is extracted from chromatin by the INO80
  and p97 segregase complexes comitting it to proteasomal degradation. This is presumably
  counteracted by the UVSSA-USP7 complex. Green spheres depict K63-linked ubiquitylation,
  red spheres indicate K48-linked ubiquitylation.
