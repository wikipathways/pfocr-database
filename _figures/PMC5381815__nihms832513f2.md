caption: Type I IFN signaling leads to an IFNAR/STAT1 dependent induction of the TAM
  receptor AXL. Once engaged, the TAM receptor signaling pathway co-opts IFNAR and
  STAT1 to induce expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3, which suppress the type I IFN cascade
  and foster tolerogenic function of DCs (left). In the absence of TAM signaling,
  the induction of SOCS proteins is impaired. Enhanced production of type I IFNs is
  expected to promote cross-presentation of tumor antigens and upregulation of costimulatory
  molecules (right).
