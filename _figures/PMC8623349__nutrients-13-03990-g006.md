caption: Canonical pathway representing “Unfolded protein response” obtained with
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) from the analysis of data set modulated by HT.
  Genes which expression was significantly modulated by HT are depicted together with
  others involved in the cascade (but not significantly modulated, depicted in gray).
  Complex or groups of genes are surrounded by a double line. Up-regulated genes are
  depicted in red.
