caption: 'Enzymatic and non-enzymatic synthesis of H2S. The enzymatic synthesis of
  H2S by CSE, CBS, 3-MST and DAO as well as the non-enzymatic pathway catalysed by
  Fe3+ and PLP are presented. Please note that H2S is also formed by CBS and CSE through
  other steps of the transulfuration pathway []: This is a modification of Fig. 1C
  from Beck and Pfeilschifter []. CAT, cysteine aminotransferase; DAO, D-amino acid
  oxidase; 3-MP, 3-mercaptopyruvate; 3-MST, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase;
  CBS, cystathionine-β-synthase; CSE, cystathionine-γ-lyase; and PLP, pyridoxal phosphate.'
