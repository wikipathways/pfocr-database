caption: The putative agar biosynthetic pathway was modified from Lee et al. Each
  square and round box represents an unigene from G. changii (GC) and G. salicornia
  (GS), respectively. Yellow and white rectangles indicate transcripts that are found
  to be present or absent in the transcriptomes of both Gracilaria species, respectively,
  whereas grey rectangle indicates transcripts that are present in G. changii only.
  Dotted lines indicate enzymatic reaction encoded by unknown gene(s) from a gene
  family. All expression values are based on the biological averaging of pooled samples
  from three individual plants. FBPA, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase; FBA, fructose-1,6-
