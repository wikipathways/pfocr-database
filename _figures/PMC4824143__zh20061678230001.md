caption: 'Smad and non-Smad transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling pathways.
  A: TGF-β1 activation occurs with the release from latent TGF-β binding protein (LTBP)
  complex by proteases. TGF-β1 signaling is initiated upon binding of active TGF-β1
  with TGF-β receptor type II (TβRII) and forming the TβRI-TβRII heteromeric complex,
  leading to phosphorylation of Smad2/3, oligomerization with Smad4, and subsequent
  nuclear translocation to regulate the transcription of ECM genes. Smad7 serves as
  a negative regulator of TGF-β1 signaling. TGF-β1 also activates Smad-independent
  signaling such as the MAPK, mediated by the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, and TGF-β-activated
  kinase 1 (TAK1), mediated by the TAK1-TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) pathway. TGF-β1-induced
  TAK1 activation leads to signaling via MKK4-JNK and MKK3-p38 pathways and activation
  of transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1) and activating transcription
  factor 2 (ATF-2), respectively, and activation of NF-κB to mediate profibrotic responses.'
