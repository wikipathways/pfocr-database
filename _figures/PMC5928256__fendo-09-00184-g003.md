caption: Peripheral metabolic regulation by kisspeptin. An overview of kisspeptin
  regulatory pathways is discussed in this review. Red lines indicate putative suppressive
  effects. Green lines indicate putative stimulatory effects. Solid lines indicate
  that specific experimental evidence is provided to support the pathway. Dashed lines
  indicate a speculative pathway based on the available evidence. KP indicates targets
  for which pharmacological roles for kisspeptin have been proposed. Figure of brain
  adapted from Dreamstime.com.
