caption: The glycolytic pathway in normal and KSHV-infected and -transformed cells.
  A The glycolysis is tightly linked to the oxygen level in normal cells. Under normoxia,
  the glucose is metabolized to pyruvate that fuels the TCA cycle and is coupled with
  oxidative phosphorylation to generate copious ATP. Under hypoxia, the glucose is
  metabolized to pyruvate, which is converted to lactate. B KSHV-encoded miRNA cluster
  and vGPCR induce the aerobic glycolysis in short-term KSHV-infected endothelial
  cells by upregulating HIF1α and inhibiting mitochondria. C KSHV-encoded miRNA cluster
  and vFLIP suppress the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation by NF-κB-mediated
  downregulation of GLUT1 and GLUT3
