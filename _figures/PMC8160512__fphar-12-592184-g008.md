caption: 'Schematic figure about the model on the regulation of HE4 expression in
  CF via CFTR and pro-inflammatory signaling. There is an increased basal expression
  of HE4 with cytokines (e.g., IL-6) in lung epithelial cells of CF that is caused
  by CFTR dysfunction and external pro-inflammatory stimuli, e.g., TNF-α via the NF-κB
  pathway (A) Blocking the effect of TNF-α by BAY 11-7082 or using CFTR modulators
  (LUM/IVA or TEZ/IVA) can effectively reduce pro-inflammatory response in CFBE cells
  by suppressing the NF-κB pathway with a still unknown mechanism (dotted line) that
  prevents IL-6 and HE4 overexpression (B) Abbreviations: CFBE cell: cystic fibrosis
  bronchial epithelial cell, CFTR: cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator,
  TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor alpha, HE4: human epididymis protein 4, IL-6: interleukin-6,
  NF-κB: nuclear factor-kappa B.'
