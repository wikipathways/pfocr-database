caption: Purine metabolism. The guanine nucleotides guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP),
  guanosine-5′-diphosphate (GDP) and guanosine-5′-monophosphate (GMP) are sequentially
  dephosphorylated by ecto-nucleotidases (i.e., Ecto-NTPDase and Ecto-5’-nucleotidase),
  thus generating guanosine. Guanosine is hydrolyzed by PNP generating the purine
  base guanine. By action of a guanine deaminase (GDA), guanine is converted into
  xanthine and subsequently to uric acid by the action of a xanthine oxidase. Adenine
  nucleotides are also hydrolyzed forming the nucleosides adenosine and inosine. The
  following nitrogenous bases, hypoxanthine, xanthine and uric acid, are formed intracellularly.
  Ecto-NTPDase, ecto-nucleotide diphosphohydrolase or apyrase; ADA, adenosine deaminase;
  AdoK, adenosine kinase; APRT, adenine phosphoribosyl transferase; HGPRT, hypoxanthine-guanine
  phosphoribosyl transferase; PNP, purine nucleoside phosphorylase. APRT and HGPRT
  are mainly involved in the intracellular salvage purines pathway.
