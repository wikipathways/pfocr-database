caption: Pathway circuitry dictates therapeutic response. (A) For tumours with defined
  genetic lesions, the ability to overcome a given targeted therapeutic lies in whether
  or not they need to acquire a secondary genetic mutation to overcome the effect
  of the drug on critical downstream biochemical effectors that are required for continued
  tumour cell growth, or whether they can simply upregulate existing alternative routes
  that lead to effectors already expressed in those cells. So, the drug places selection
  pressure to ramp up existing bypass routes. If there are no such routes to the critical
  downstream effectors, a specific mutation to upregulate those alternative routes
  or bypass the drug are required. In this example, a critical target for tumour cell
  growth and survival is the activation of eIF4E and HIF. Tumours with initiating
  mutations in RTKs, Ras or Raf have multiple routes to signal to eIF4E and HIF, so
  blocking mTOR with rapamycin does not inhibit these tumours. (B) In contrast, tumours
  with initiating lesions in PI(3)K or more direct regulators of mTOR (such as LKB1
  and TSC) do not have alternative routes to activate eIF4E and HIF. Hence these tumours
  show greater response to rapamycin. (C) Similarly, the expression and use of specific
  adaptor proteins that enhance certain arms of pathway signalling will dictate the
  therapeutic response. In the example shown, human lung tumours expressing epidermal‐growth‐factor
  receptor (EGFR) are targeted with anti‐EGFR drugs such as Iressa or Tarceva. In
  tumours expressing the ERBB3 heterodimerization partner, EGFR efficiently enhances
  PI(3)K activation through a number of PI(3)K‐binding sites in ERBB3. (D) In tumours
  that lack ERBB3, PI(3)K is still activated by a number of other routes, including
  adaptors such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Reprinted from []. Copyright©
