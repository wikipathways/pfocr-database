caption: NRG/Erb signaling in the control of peripheral myelination and axonal growth.
  BACE1 processed axonal NRG1-type III interacts with ErbB receptors (A), and promotes
  cell survival, proliferation and myelination by activating various signaling pathways,
  including mTOR via PI3K/Akt (B) and ERK1/2 via Ras/Raf (C). However, NRG1 type III
  cleavage by ADAM17 conveys inhibitory signals to the myelination program (D). In
  Schwann cells (SCs), axonal NRG type III (transmembrane) represses NRG type I (soluble)
  isoform expression via ERK1/2(E). Rapid axonal NRG1 release can be spatially regulated
  by neurotrophic factors [e.g., Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF), and glia cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)], that are released
  by SCs, and act via TrkA, TrkB or GFRα1/RET receptors, respectively, on axonal surfaces
  (F). Neurotrophins induce the coordinated efforts of PKCδ and cell surface proteases
  such as BACE1 and ADAM, which cleave a precursor form of axonal NRG1 to release
  its active soluble form (G). In addition, neurotrophins also activate the Shc/PI3K/Akt
  survival pathway and Shc/Ras/ERK1/2 differentiation pathways. Activation of ERK
  by neurotrophins can inhibit PDE4 (phosphodiesterase) activity, which leads to the
  antagonism of cyclic AMP hydrolysis (H). Elevating intracellular cyclic AMP is critical
  to overcoming axon growth inhibition by myelin-associated molecules, such as myelin-associated
  glycoprotein (MAG), which is present in non-compact myelin. NRG1/ErbB signaling
  is further regulated by the adaptor protein Erbin and ErbB2 spatial localization
  determinant protein, LINGO-1, a component of the MAI-Nogo receptor-signaling complex
  (I). Cyclic AMP can sustain NRG1 type I-mediated transient Akt phosphorylation via
  PKA dependent phosphorylation of the ErbB receptor, a mechanism that involves Rap1b-PP2A
  signaling (J). NRG1/ErbB signaling is dispensable for the myelination program in
  the CNS, and a detailed understanding of the NRG1/ErbB interaction network following
  the CNS injury is lacking.
