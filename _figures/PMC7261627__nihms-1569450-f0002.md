caption: 'A propensity for complexity: molecular signaling required for progesterone-dependent
  uterine receptivity and decidualization. (A) The progesterone-PGR-IHH-COUP-TFII
  signaling pathway, which spans the epithelial and stromal cellular compartments
  of the endometrium, controls ESR1 activity in the endometrial epithelium. Such ESR1
  control is required for epithelial differentiation and development of the receptive
  endometrium for embryo implantation. For clarity, other signals (i.e. Msx 1 and
  2), which are important for uterine receptivity, are not be included in this schematic.

  stromal cell decidualization during the periimplantation period. Adapted with permission
