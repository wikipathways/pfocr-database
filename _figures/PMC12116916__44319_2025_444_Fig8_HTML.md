caption: Building on existing knowledge of TLR4 signaling, the data presented here
  revise current understanding of TLR4 signaling. TLR4 endocytosis is initiated upon
  TLR4 ligand-driven TLR4 activation. In case of the TLR4 ligand LPS, GPI-anchored
  membrane-bound CD14 (mCD14) (Zanoni et al, 2011), or soluble CD14 (sCD14) with lower
  efficiency (Tsukamoto et al, 2018), are required to transfer LPS to TLR4. In contrast,
  the synthetic agonist 1Z105 activates TLR4 independent of CD14 (Rajaiah et al, 2015).
  TLR4 endocytosis is dependent on TLR4 TIR domain activity (Figs. 3 and 4), but does
  not require TLR signaling adaptors MAL, MyD88, TRAM, TRIF (Rajaiah et al, 2015;
  Zanoni et al, 2011) (Fig. 5; Appendix Figs. S2 and S7), or BCAP (Fig. 5). Instead,
  E1 and E2 ubiquitination enzyme activity, independent of ubiquitination events that
  regulate canonical TLR4 signaling pathways, are required for TLR4 endocytosis (Fig. 6).
  PLCγ2 and SYK activity contributes to TLR4 endocytosis (Chiang et al, 2012; Zanoni
  et al, 2011) (Fig. 7; Appendix Fig. S10), and TLR4 activity regulates cellular PLCγ2
  protein levels (Fig. EV3). Endocytosed TLR4 is directed towards degradation (Husebye
  et al, 2006) (Fig. 1). TLR4-MAL-MyD88 signaling activated at the cell surface (Latz
  et al, 2002) results in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kawai et al, 1999)
  among other cellular responses to exogenous and endogenous danger signals. CD14
  is required for activation of TLR4-MAL-MyD88 signaling at low but not high LPS concentrations
  (Zanoni et al, 2011) with both mCD14 and sCD14 able to promote surface TLR4 activation (Frey
  et al, 1992; Wright et al, 1990). In contrast, the small molecule 1Z105 activates
  TLR4 independent of CD14 (Hayashi et al, 2014). TLR4 endocytosis negatively regulates
  TLR4-MAL-MyD88 signaling, thereby curbing pro-inflammatory outputs of TLR4 activation
  (Husebye et al, 2006; Latz et al, 2002). TLR4-MAL-MyD88 and TLR4-TRAM-TRIF signaling
  occur in parallel, and the latter is not reliant on TLR4 surface expression or TLR4
  endocytosis (Figs. 1 and EV1). In the case of LPS, cellular uptake and trafficking
  requires mCD14 (Wright et al, 1990), but not sCD14 (Jacque et al, 2006; Tapping
  and Tobias, 1997), to deliver LPS to endosomes (Vasudevan et al, 2022). CD14 undergoes
  endocytosis with contributions by PLC and ubiquitination enzyme activity (Appendix
  Figs. S9 and S10), trafficking bound LPS into the cell (Kitchens and Munford, 1998;
  Kitchens et al, 1998) and transferring it to endosomal TLR4. This results in TLR4-TRAM-TRIF
  signaling and TBK1/IKKe activation that promotes type I IFN expression (Fig. 2).
  In addition, TRIF and RIPK1 promote prolonged NF-κB activation (Cusson-Hermance
  et al, 2005; Sato et al, 2003). As LPS is a cell-impermeable molecule (Guerville
  and Boudry, 2016), the requirement for mCD14 for TLR4-TRAM-TRIF signaling cannot
  be overridden by high LPS concentrations (Lloyd-Jones et al, 2008) or complexing
  with sCD14 (Saito et al, 2000). In contrast to LPS, 1Z105 does not require CD14
  endocytosis to be delivered to endosomal TLR4. Nevertheless, perturbation of 1Z105-induced
  Ifnb1 expression by endocytosis inhibitors (Fig. 2) and concomitant induction of
  LPS- and 1Z105-induced Ifnb1 expression (Appendix Fig. S5) suggests that 1Z105 is
  actively trafficked to endosomal compartments where it activates TLR4-TRAM-TRIF
  signaling

    Instead, E1 and E2 ubiquitination enzyme activity, independent of ubiquitination
    events that regulate canonical TLR4 signaling pathways, are required for TLR4
    endocytosis (Fig. 6). PLCγ2 and SYK activity contributes to TLR4 endocytosis (Chiang
