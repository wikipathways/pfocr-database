caption: Antiviral pathways can be stimulated by both RNA and dsDNA from receptor-mediated
  fusion events or endocytosis. These foreign nucleic acids interact with pattern
  recognition receptors, such as RIG-I like receptors (RLRs), or with cGAS (cyclic
  GMP-AMP synthase) which initiates the STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) antiviral
  response pathway. mtDNA acts as a ligand for many immune receptors so is capable
  of activating both cGAS and RLRs as well as the NLRP3 (nod-like receptor family
  pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome for the up-regulation of cytokine release
  and a pro-inflammatory response.
