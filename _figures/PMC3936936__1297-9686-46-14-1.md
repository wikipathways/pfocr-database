caption: Network of interactions between products of candidate genes from the QTL
  regions. The candidate genes were identified as (A) involved in the pathway of immune
  response to infectious diseases, (B) involved in the coagulation pathway, and (C)
  candidate genes from the two QTL regions on chromosome GGA21 that was detected by
  multi-QTL screening; the network illustrates molecular interactions between the
  products of the candidate genes selected from the QTL regions; relations were determined
  using information contained in the IPA relationships database; the color code indicates
  the genes that are contained in a given QTL region; the white color indicates gene
  products that were added in the IPA analysis because of their interaction with the
  target gene products.
