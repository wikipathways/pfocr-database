caption: All transcripts from ligands through transcription factors (except LimK)
  depicted in the model exhibited a statistically significant increase in conditioned
  media at 24 or 48 hours compared to the level at the beginning of the study. None
  were significantly increased in unconditioned media. The boxes contain proteins
  significantly elevated in the conditioned media which could act as ligands for the
  specified pathways---nomenclature provided in . Transcripts associated with the
  GPCR (G-Protein-Coupled Receptor) pathway and the process of cytokinesis are depicted.
  Transcripts associated with the RTK (Receptor Tyrosine kinase) pathway are also
  shown including transcription factors (FOS, FOSL1, JUNB, JUND and MYCN) associated
  with cyclin activation and proliferation. A separate pathway associated with cardiomyocyte
  differentiation exhibited significant elevation of transcription factors AP2a, MEF2D,
  STAT1 and 3. Transcripts associated with cytokine activation of the JAK-STAT pathway
  included multiple JAKs and elevation of STAT3 and STAT1 associated with cell cycle
  progression. The microarray intensity data representing nomenclature of all transcripts
  associated with these signal transduction pathways are provided in .
