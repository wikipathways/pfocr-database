caption: Model showing the responses of Arabidopsis to strong iron scavengers. A,
  Early events. Iron scavengers (EDDHA or siderophore) chelate iron in the surrounding
  tissue of the leaf and trigger an iron deficiency signal. This iron deficiency signal
  will be relayed by a signaling cascade, which potentially involves dephosphorylations
  and leads to the up-regulation of bHLH100 and bHLH101 in leaves and IRT1 and FRO2
  in roots. B, Late events. Activation of IRT1 expression results in the uptake of
  iron and zinc at the root level, which is indicated by the thick orange arrow. This
  metal uptake is likely to cause a cellular stress in the treated leaves. The most
  important immunity and iron homeostasis markers are indicated. NON EXPRESSOR of
  PR1 is a protein involved in the SA signal transduction pathway shown to be required
  for PR1 activation by siderophores (). Dotted arrows indicate that the activation
  is not direct. Genes up-regulated are surrounded by a colored box. Green and orange
  boxes refer to events occurring in leaves and roots, respectively. [See online article
  for color version of this figure.]
