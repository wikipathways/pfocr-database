caption: Schematic overview of ethylene biosynthesis and the canonical signaling pathway.
  Ethylene acts as an inverse agonist, inhibiting its receptors. This inhibition leads
  to a reduction in CTR1 activity, which allows the set of reactions downstream to
  occur, culminating in ethylene responses. The different pathways are separated by
  a dashed line. Inhibition steps are marked with an inhibitory arrow (red). Based
  on the signaling models of Wang et al. [] and Binder [].
