caption: 'By simultaneously inhibiting CBS activity and inhibiting GOT1, a key enzyme
  of the malate/aspartate shuttle, AOAA acts as an inducer of ‘synthetic lethality’
  in cancer cells. CBS-derived H2S supports mitochondrial electron transport and cancer
  cell bioenergetics by donating electrons at complex II. By inhibiting CBS, AOAA
  suppresses this bioenergetic pathway. The malate-aspartate shuttle translocates
  electrons that are produced in glycolysis across the semipermeable inner membrane
  of the mitochondrion in order to support oxidative phosphorylation. These electrons
  enter the electron transport chain at complex I. The shuttle system is required
  because the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NADH (a primary reducing
  equivalent of the electron transport chain). In humans, the cytoplasmic enzyme (GOT1)
  is one of the key enzymes in the malate shuttle: it functions to catalyse the interconversion
  of aspartate and α-ketoglutarate to oxaloacetate and glutamate using pyridoxal phosphate
  as a cofactor. By inhibiting GOT1, AOAA reduces the transfer of electron donors
  to the mitochondria, thereby suppressing cancer cell bioenergetics. By the simultaneous
  inhibition of CBS and GOT1, AOAA interferes with two key pathways of cancer cell
  mitochondrial function.'
