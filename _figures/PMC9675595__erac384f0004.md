caption: The role of organelles in jasmonate signaling. The term jasmonate comprises
  JA and JA-Ile as well as several precursors and catabolic derivatives some of which
  also possess bioactivity. Jasmonate biosynthesis is initiated in chloroplasts by
  oxidation of C18:3 (octadecanoid pathway) and C16:3 (hexadecanoid pathway) fatty
  acids derived from galactolipids, which are converted in several steps to the first
  committed precursor, OPDA. The MDGD/DGDG ratio, but also conjugation of OPDA to
  GSH or esterification to galactolipids (arabidopsides), affects OPDA homeostasis.
  Biosynthesis of JA continues in peroxisomes by β-oxidation of OPC-8:0 and OPC-6:0.
  A minor, less well described bypass pathway of JA formation involves tnOPDA and
  4,5-ddh-JA. JA-Ile, the most bioactive of the jasmonates, is finally synthesized
  in the cytosol from JA and isoleucine, the latter being derived from methionine
  also made in chloroplasts. Ultimately, JA-Ile exerts its action in the nucleus by
  promoting the formation of SCFCOI1–JAZ co-receptor complexes and thus releasing
  JAZ-dependent gene suppression. 4,5ddh-JA, 4,5-didehydro-jasmonate; 10,11-EHT, 10,11(S)-epoxy-hexadecatrienoic
