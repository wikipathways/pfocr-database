caption: Proton transfer pathways and the catalytic reaction cycle for O2 reduction.
  (A) The D and K pathways are indicated with black and blue solid lines, respectively,
  where CuA (green), heme a (yellow), CuB (light green), heme a3 (cyan), Mg2+ (magenta),
  and H2O (red spheres) are shown. D pathway protons are directed to the catalytic
  site for O2 reduction (dashed black line) or to be pumped (dashed red line). (B)
  The oxidized catalytic site (O) is reduced with two electrons and two protons from
  the K pathway to form (R). Dioxygen binds to heme a3 (A), then the O-O bond is broken
  forming the peroxy intermediate (Pm). Transfer of an electron and a D pathway proton
  results in formation of the ferryl intermediate (F). An additional electron is transferred,
  along with net proton uptake through the D pathway, which re-forms O. Proton pumping
  (HP+) via the D pathway occurs from Pm→F, F→O (), and possibly from O→R (, ). Tyr-288
  is represented by YOH.
