caption: Fatty acid metabolism in pluripotency regulation. Appropriate cellular levels
  of lipids safeguard pluripotency. (A) De novo synthesis of fatty acids, initiated
  by the enzyme acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase alpha (ACC1), promotes pluripotency
  maintenance and acquisition by enhancing mitochondrial fission. This conserved pathway
  is antagonized by ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation of the acetylated mitochondrial
  fission mediator FIS1. (B) In human PSCs, exogenous lipid deficiency induces intracellular
  lipogenesis which ultimately inhibits endogenous ERK and promotes pluripotency
