caption: 'Suggested hypothetical model of regulation of the plant response to small
  fungal VCs by vascular and root tip GPT2 and PGI1 expression. According to this
  model, the response of plants to small fungal VCs involves mechanisms wherein signaling
  of both rapid thiol redox activation of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells of leaves
  (, ) and enhanced glycolytic or PPP activity in vascular tissues of roots play important
  roles. Thiol redox activation of photosynthesis promoted by small VCs increases
  the production of photosynthates (mainly sucrose), which are transported to vascular
  tissues and root tip cells and metabolized to G6P in the cytosol. This compound
  enters the plastid through the GPT transporters to fuel the plastid-localized glycolysis
  or PPP, where PGI1 participates in the metabolization of G6P. GAP produced by the
  PPP or glycolysis enters the MEP pathway to fuel the production of tZ, which is
  transported to mesophyll cells, where it initiates a cascade of reactions, leading
  to changes in the expression of photosynthesis-related proteins. This process guarantees
  a sustained high rate of photosynthesis and accelerated growth. According to this
  hypothetical model, VC-promoted starch overaccumulation in both WT and pgi1-2 leaves
  could be a consequence of the stimulation of metabolic flux through noncanonical
  starch biosynthetic pathway(s) (highlighted in double dashed lines) that bypass
  PGI1 through the transport of cytosolic hexoses (e.g. G6P and/or ADPglucose) into
  the chloroplasts. pPGM: plastidial phosphoglucomutase; AGP: ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase;
  SS: starch synthase; TPT: triose-P transporter.'
