caption: The balance between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS)
  can direct the inflammatory response towards pro- or anti-inflammatory outcomes.
  Whereas activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (part of parasympathetic
  branch of the ANS) dampens inflammation, stimulation of the adrenergic pathways
  leads to amplification of the inflammatory response. a. In the adrenergic pro-inflammatory
  pathway, high concentrations of circulating catecholamines amplify the initial inflammatory
  response, particularly in the early phase of sepsis. Sources for catecholamine production
  and release are the adrenal medulla, sympathetic neurons and leukocytes (phagocytic
  cells and lymphocytes). Catecholamines exert their immunomodulatory effects through
  α- and β-adrenergic receptors that are expressed by various cell types, resulting
  in the increased release of pro-inflammatory mediators. b. By contrast, the activation
  of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in sepsis attenuates the inflammatory
  response. These effects are mediated through engagement of α7-nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptors (α7nAChRs). Acetylcholine is released following vagus-nerve stimulation,
  resulting in inhibition of the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory mediators
  such as high-mobility group box 1 protein and tumour-necrosis factor.
