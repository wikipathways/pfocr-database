caption: Model for enhancing tumor growth due to the Hippo pathway being interrupted
  by LATS2 O-GlcNAcylation. The O-GlcNAcylation at LATS2 Thr436 by OGT interrupts
  the interaction with MOB1. Therefore, phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif (HM)
  and activation loop (AL) essential for LATS2 activity decreases. Activated YAP and
  TAZ increase in response to LATS2 inactivation, which enhances transcription of
  CTGF, CYR61, NF2, and LATS2. However, even if the transcription rates of NF2 and
  LATS2 increase, the negative feedback loop would not effectively work by LATS2 O-GlcNAcylation
  in cancer cells. Consequently, O-GlcNAcylation at LATS2 Thr436 disrupts the Hippo
  pathway, possibly enhancing tumor growth.
