caption: ISC lineages of mammalian intestine and Drosophila midgut, and the common
  pathways that control them. Apart from the Wnt/Wg and STAT pathways that are necessary
  for ISC division, additional similarities between the mammalian and Drosophila midgut
  ISCs have been noted. For example, midgut ISCs divide when the InR pathway is activated
  (i.e. following drug exposure) and in the presence of PVF growth factors (during
  aging); the analogous INSR and PDGF pathways, respectively, control mouse ISC homeostasis.
  In addition, ISCs are controlled by the Notch pathway; however, Notch activates
  ISC proliferation in mammals but causes them to differentiate in Drosophila midgut.
  Nevertheless, Notch signaling is similarly required for the specification of enterocyte
  (EC) versus secretory (Sec) fate during the commitment of TA cells and enteroblasts
  (EBs). Wnt/Wg, which is needed for determination of secretory cell fate differentiation
  in mammals, is apparently not crucial for similarly specifying cell fate in the
  fly midgut.
