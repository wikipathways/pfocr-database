caption: TSPYL5-mediated signaling pathway, which regulates the expression of ALDH1,
  CD44, and PTEN, enforces cancer stemness in a positive feedback manner. It is initiated
  by AKT-dependent phosphorylation of TSPYL5, followed by suppression of PTEN expression
  and consequent activation of AKT. TSPYL5 is a critical component of the CSC-associated
  loop signaling pathway. On the other hand, TSPYL5-depleted cells by promoter methylation
  or protein degradation are hard to maintain cancer stemness, resulting in high sensitivity
  to radio- or chemotherapy. Therefore, the strategies for TSPYL5 depletion, which
  can disrupt the self-renewal program of CSCs, can be novel methods for cancer treatment.
