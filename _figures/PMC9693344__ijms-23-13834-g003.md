caption: Regulatory pathways of apoptosis induced by isothiocyanates in hepatocellular
  carcinoma cells. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) mainly induce three apoptotic pathways in
  HCC. (i) ITCs trigger a series of mitochondria-related apoptotic responses, including
  decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, increase of Bax expression and decrease
  of Bcl-2 expression, ultimately promoting the enhancement of mitochondrial outer
  membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which further causes the release of cytochrome
  C and promotes the production of ROS that causes DNA damage. (ii) ITCs induce endoplasmic
  reticulum stress (ESR)-related apoptosis pathway. As for this pathway, PERK and
  IRE1 are separated from molecular chaperones such as Bip/GRP78 due to the interaction
  between the unfolded/misfolded protein and molecular chaperones, and activated by
  autophosphorylation, promoting the production of elF-2α and expression of XBP1.
  Elf-2α and XBP1 further upregulate the levels of apoptosis signaling molecule CHOP/GADD153.
  Besides, ATF6 is also stimulated to transfer into the nucleus and promotes the transcription
  and expression of CHOP/GADD153. Moreover, a large amount of Ca2+ is released to
  enter the cytoplasm and activate calpain and caspase-12. (iii) ITCs induce apoptosis
  process mediated by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Fas/Fas ligand
  (FasL). ITCs inhibit keratin 8 and keratin 18 (K8/18), leading to the binding of
  FasL homotrimer (FADD, Daxx, and FAD-1) complex with Fas, which initiates Fas-FasL-mediated
  apoptosis of external death receptor pathway. In addition, ITCs induce TRAIL binding
  to DR4 and DR5, activating caspase-3 and mitochondria-dependent pathways to facilitate
  apoptosis. Red, blue, light green, dark green, pink, orange, gray, and reddish ellipses
  represent ITCs, Bcl-2/Bax, p53, ATF6, CHOP/GADD15, Bip, XPB1, and eIF-2α, respectively,
  while red hollow circle represents ROS.
