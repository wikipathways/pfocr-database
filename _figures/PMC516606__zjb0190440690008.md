caption: 'Regulatory interactions involved in hapA transcription regulation. The hapA
  gene is transcribed in response to two concurrent environmental signals: high cell
  density and nutrient limitation. Nutrient limitation leads to entry of bacteria
  into the stationary phase, with enhanced transcription of rpoS and high levels of
  σS. At high cell density in the stationary phase, HapR is expressed and, in combination
  with an unidentified factor (X) and σS, activates the transcription of hapA. Glucose
  represses hapA transcription by inducing cells to resume exponential growth, blocking
  the pathway to accumulation of σS. The cAMP-CRP complex enhances the transcription
  of hapA by positively influencing the transcription of rpoS and hapR. CRP could
  increase HapR levels by acting on luxO or hapR. HapR represses the expression of
  AphA, required for the production of CT and TCP. In the absence of AphA, pva, encoding
  penicillin V amidase, is expressed.'
