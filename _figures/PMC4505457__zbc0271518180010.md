caption: Model for DAXX-mediated induction of tumorigenesis. A, synopsis of experimental
  results outlines the effect of DAXX on subcutaneous tumor growth, emphasizing key
  autophagy effectors in the process. Green arrow, increased gene expression; red
  arrow, decreased gene expression. B, a mechanistic model of DAXX function in cancer.
  The dashed arrow on the left summarizes the overall effect of DAXX on tumorigenesis,
  whereas mechanistic details are depicted with solid lines. DAXX suppresses expression
  of DAPKs () and ULK1 (this investigation). ULK1 is the most upstream element in
  the autophagy pathway, without which phosphorylation-dependent activation of DAPK3
  and Beclin1 and, ultimately, autophagy cannot proceed. DAXX may affect several components
  of the autophagy machinery simultaneously or sequentially, with the end result being
  increased tumorigenesis.
