caption: (a) In the absence of a signal, the destruction complex (APC–Axin–GSK-3–CK1)
  binds and phosphorylates non-cadherin-associated β-catenin, targeting it for destruction
  by the proteasome. Within the nucleus, TCF/Lef1 DNA-binding proteins are bound by
  transcriptional repressors (TLE/Groucho). (b) The binding of Wnt ligand to its Frizzled
  receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptor induces a change in conformation that results in
  phosphorylation of the co-receptor, which creates a high-affinity binding site for
  Axin, causing disruption of the destruction complex. This allows β-catenin to accumulate,
  associate with the TCF/Lef1 proteins, dislodging the TLE repressors and hence promoting
  transcriptional activation of a program of genes including those encoding c-Myc
  and Axin2. The latter protein feeds back to inhibit the pathway by promoting assembly
  of more destruction complexes.
