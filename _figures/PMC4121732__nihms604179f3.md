caption: Most FcγRs have a common α chain that contains an extracellular region with
  varying numbers of the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain. FcγRIIa has only a single
  α chain. FcγRI and FcγRIIIa are coupled to additional receptor subunits (two γ chains)
  that are involved in downstream signaling. The signaling pathways initiated by the
  engagement of different activating FcγRs usually begin with tyrosine phosporylation
  of the conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in the cytoplasmic
  tail of the receptors or their associated subunits by kinases in the Src family.
  The subsequent recruitment of Syk-family kinases in turn permits interaction with
  other signaling proteins, such as PI3K, Src, and Ras, and further activates downstream
  signaling pathways that lead to specific biological functions. The activation of
  NFκB or the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway is critical for cytokine/chemokine production whereas
  the PI3K-Akt pathway is important for microglial phagocytosis. In contrast to the
  ITAM-mediated activation of microglia, the engagement of inhibitory FcγRIIb triggers
  immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) activation through its cytoplasmic
  domain, resulting in the recruitment of phosphatases such as SHIP and SHP1. This
  attenuates the signaling cascades engaged by activating FcRs and diminishes downstream
  biological effects by acting in counterpoint to ITAM.
