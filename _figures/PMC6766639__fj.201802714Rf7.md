caption: Mechanism underlying the IT-mediated delayed onset of T2DM. Undigested food
  passing through the intestine may trigger the release of chemokines, which reach
  the liver via portal circulation, thereby attenuating TGF-β1 signaling. The resulting
  increased hepatic bile acid levels and cholesterol biosynthesis as well as lowered
  CL biosynthesis may hamper mitochondrial FAO to sustain high-energy processes such
  as gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis.
