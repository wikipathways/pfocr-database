caption: Apoptotic signaling through the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand (TRAIL) pathway. Binding of TRAIL to TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAILR1 or D4) or
  TRAILR2/DR5 results in receptor oligomerization and recruitment of FAS-associated
  protein with death domain (FADD) and caspase 8 to form a functional death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC). Upon DISC formation, caspase 8 is cleaved and activated,
  which in turn can cleave and activate caspase 3 and the BH3-only protein BID. Active,
  cleaved BID (tBID) can bind to pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak, resulting in mitochondrial
  membrane permeabilization and release of mitochondrial proteins cytochrome c and
  DIABLO. Cytochrome c, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1), and caspase
  9 combine with ATP to form a functional apoptosome that results in cleavage and
  activation of caspase 9, which can then cleave caspase 3. DIABLO suppresses the
  caspase-inhibitory activities of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Caspase 3 can
  cleave a large number of intracellular targets, resulting in the morphological and
  biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis. Caspase 3 can also cleave and activate caspase
  8, thereby amplifying the apoptotic signal. Reprinted with permission from ref .
