caption: 'Abiotic and biotic stress-induced changes in morphological and physiological
  features are restored or partially restored by increasing endogenous GABA and GABA
  shunt activity. Depending upon the nature of the abiotic stress, the entry of pyruvate
  into the tricarboxylic acid cycle via pyruvate dehydrogenase, the catabolism of
  2−oxoglutarate and succinate via 2−oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase,
  respectively, and activity of cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondrial electron transport
  chain may be restricted, thereby limiting the generation of molecules associated
  with energy transfer (NADH, FADH and ATP). These limitations are to some extent
  overcome by increasing the levels of endogenous GABA, by either GAD overexpression
  or application of exogenous GABA. The elevated endogenous GABA increases flux through
  the shunt, which in turn, increases the level and/or entry of succinate into the
  non−cyclic tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial electron transport chain, and
  accordingly, ATP generation. The elevated GABA also modifies the activity of stress-induced
  pathways involving enzymatic and non−enzymatic antioxidants, N assimilation, secondary
  products, and phytohormones (NO; ethylene and ABA are not shown) by uncharacterized
  mechanisms. The activity of phytopathogens is directly inhibited by accumulated
  GABA. Symbols: X, biochemical reaction potentially inhibited by stress; white filled
  arrows, increasing or decreasing activity of pathway(s) affected by GABA; black
  filled arrow, increasing level of metabolite affected by stress. Abbreviations:
  ALMT, aluminum−activated malate transporter; Cyt Ox, cytochrome oxidase; NADK, NAD
  kinase; OPPP, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  SAM, S−adenosylmethionine; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; TCAC, tricarboxylic acid
  cycle; TH, transhydrogenase; see  legend for the remaining abbreviations.'
