caption: 'The complement cascade and complement targeting therapies. Activation of
  the complement cascade occurs through three unique pathways: (i) classical, (ii)
  lectin or mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and (iii) alternative. Classical and lectin
  activation through C1q binding to antigen-bound antibodies on the cell surface or
  MBL binding to bacterial carbohydrate motifs. Respectively, leads to cleavage of
  C4 and C2 generating the C3 convertase (C4bC2b). In the alternative pathway, complement
  activation occurs spontaneously through hydrolysis of C3 which binds factor B split
  product (Bb) to form the C3 convertase (C3bBb). Both C3 convertases cleave C3 yielding
  C3a and C3b products, the latter of which continues to amplify the cascade. Regulation
  of this amplification through Factor H and CD46, both in conjunction with Factor
  I, leads to inactivation of C3b as iC3b. C3b can further bind with C3 Convertases
  yielding C5 convertases (C4b2bC3b and C3bBbC3b) which cleaves C5 to C5a and C5b.
  The decay accelerating factor (DAF) competitively inhibits C3 and C5 convertase
  activity by facilitating disassociation of the assembled enzymes. C3a and C5a split
  products are signaling molecules which bind the g protein coupled receptors C3aR
  and C5Ar, respectively. C5b binds to C6-9 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC)
  which promotes cell injury through pore formation in the cell membrane. This step
  is inherently regulated by CD59. Further regulation of this pathway through complement-targeted
  therapeutics (red boxes) include C1-INH, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), eculizumab,
  and C3aR and C5aR inhibitors.'
