caption: Analysis of the correlation network between KEGG Leve3 and carcass quality,
  rumen fermentation (A), and the top 20 microbial genera (B). The square in the figure
  represents the pathway, while the circle represents the genus or environmental indicator.
  Their size and color depth (green to purple) represent the degree of the relevant
  objects in the legend on the right. The purple and green nodes represent their centrality.
  The lines connected to nodes indicate significant correlations between species,
  and the thickness of the lines indicates the strength of the correlation. (|r| >
  0.5, p < 0.05), gold and silver represent positive and negative correlations, respectively
