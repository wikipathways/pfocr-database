caption: The illustration of the JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways implicated
  in the protective effect of SM on kidneys injured by DN. SM stimulated the JAK2/STAT3
  pathway, subsequently stimulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade, which resulted
  in elevated Bcl-2 levels and reduced Bax, IL-6, TNF-α, and cleaved caspase-3, so
  inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation
