caption: Canonical signaling pathways activated by the EP receptors for PGE2. EP1
  activates phospholipase C (PLC), resulting in the production of 1,2-diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC)
  while IP3 mobilizes Ca2+. EP2 activates adenylate cyclase (AC) which results in
  elevated cAMP synthesis and protein kinase A (PKA) activation. EP3 negatively regulates
  AC and thus cAMP levels are reduced. EP4 activates both the AC/cAMP pathway and
  the PI3K/AKT pathway. The activation of these signaling pathways by the EP receptors
  in skin results in biological changes that are associated with the promotion and
  progression of NMSC
