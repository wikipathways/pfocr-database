caption: BasE binds 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid 8 and ATP then catalyzes their condensation
  to form an intermediate acyl-adenylate 9 that remains tightly bound. In a second
  half reaction, BasE catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group (blue) onto a nucleophilic
  sulfur atom of the aryl carrier domain of BasF to provide the acylated complex 10
  with the release of AMP. Further steps are catalyzed by BasD, BasA and BasB, incorporating
  threonine and N-hydroxyhistamine to yield pre-acinetobactin 11. This molecule undergoes
  a facile rearrangement to the isoxazolidinone isomer of acinetobactin 1 that is
  likely promoted via an internal hydrogen bond with the oxazoline nitrogen atom in
  conjunction with the proximal imidazole moiety that serves to deprotonate the N-hydroxyamide
  functional group.
