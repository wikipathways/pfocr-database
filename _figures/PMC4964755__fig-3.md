caption: Glucose metabolism in presence of oxygen and with low oxygen. Glucose metabolism
  is primarily via glycolysis leading to pyruvate formation and further metabolism
  in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle within the mitochondria. Alternative paths
  include metabolism via the pentose phosphate shunt pathway and aldose reductase
  pathway. With hypoxic conditions there is enhanced pyruvate to lactate glycolysis
  and reduced pyruvate uptake into the mitochondria. With an elevation in intracellular
  glucose and a hypoxic or pseudohypoxic reduction in Ox-Phos activity, there could
  be a backup of TCA cycle metabolites leading to enhanced citrate conversion to lipid
  synthesis, αKG leading to amino acid synthesis, and malate leading to nucleotide
  synthesis. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the web
