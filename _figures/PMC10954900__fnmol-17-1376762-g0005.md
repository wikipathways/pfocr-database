caption: Signaling crosstalks among dopamine, muscarine, and serotonin. (A) D1Rs and
  M4Rs are coexpressed in striatonigral neurons. Activation of D1Rs increases the
  concentration of cAMP and the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2, while activation
  of M4Rs is likely to cause a decrease in cAMP production. The cAMP-evoked PKA and
  its downstream signaling molecules constitute the “reward signaling cascade” because
  PKA–Rap1–ERK signaling comprehensively regulates cellular responses including membrane
  excitability, synaptic plasticity, and gene regulation, thereby modulating reward
  behavior. (B) D2Rs and M1Rs are coexpressed in striatopallidal neurons. Acetylcholine
  enhances the closure of KCNQ2 via Gq-coupled signaling. D2Rs suppress the activity
  of the PKA–Rap1–ERK signaling pathway. (C) D1Rs cooperate with serotonin receptor
  subtypes, such as 5-HT4Rs and 5-HT6Rs, to activate intracellular signaling. A phosphorylation
  study of DARPP-32 revealed that the synergetic effect between D1Rs and 5HT4/6Rs
  contributes to the phosphorylation of DARPP-32
