caption: Working model for ARF6-GTP-induced signaling during cyst development. Increased
  ARF6-GTP levels lead to enhanced PLD activation, and potentially, the recruitment
  of nm23H1, to facilitate growth factor internalization into signaling endosomes.
  Signaling endosomes serve as platforms for constitutive receptor signaling. PA enrichment
  on these vesicular compartments could be important for recruitment of downstream
  signaling molecules. The type of signaling response elicited is probably dependent
  on the cell type. In MDCK cysts, elevated ARF6-GTP leads to activation of the ERK
  signaling pathway.
