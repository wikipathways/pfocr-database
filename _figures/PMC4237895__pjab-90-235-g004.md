caption: Molecular mechanisms of eCB-LTD. Excitatory synaptic inputs activate group
  I mGluR, which facilitates 2-AG synthesis through PLCβ-DGLα pathway. This mGluR-driven
  2-AG synthesis is enhanced by concomitant Ca2+ elevation, which is not necessary
  for eCB-LTD induction at some synapses. Activation of presynaptic CB1R by 2-AG inhibits
  adenylyl cyclase (AC), decreases cAMP levels and reduces PKA activity. Presynaptic
  activity causes Ca2+ elevation, which activates a phosphatase, calcineurin (CaN).
  In concert with reduced PKA activity, calcineurin facilitates dephosphorylation
  of target proteins (X), and induces persistent suppression of transmitter release
  through RIM1α-dependent and/or -independent processes. (Reproduced from Ohno-Shosaku
  et al., 2012)).
