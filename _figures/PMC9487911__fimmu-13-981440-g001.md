caption: 'Eicosanoids synthesis cascade. PLA2 produces AA from membrane phospholipids.
  Thereafter, there are two main pathways for AA metabolism: 1) COX pathway - the
  enzymes COX-1 and 2 convert AA to PGH2 which is converted by different isozymes
  to various prostaglandins and thromboxanes; and, 2) 5-LOX pathway - the enzyme 5-LOX
  (together with the enzyme FLAP) converts AA to LTA4, which is then converted to
  various leukotrienes. Medications that influence the synthesis/activity of mediators/enzymes
  are marked in red. Arrow indicates “production/induction”; solid line indicates
  inhibition/locking; dashed line indicates indirect inhibition. AA, arachidonic acid;
  COX, cyclooxygenase; FLAP, five lipoxygenase activating protein; LOX, lipoxygenase;
  LT, leukotriene; NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; PG, prostaglandin;
  PL, phospholipase; TX, thromboxane.'
