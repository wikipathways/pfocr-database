caption: DExD/H-box helicases regulate the TLR signaling pathway. TLRs located at
  the plasma membrane and endosomes recognize nucleic acids like dsRNA, ssRNA, and
  DNA to transduce signals through MyD88 and TRIF and then drive the activation of
  NF-κΒ to induce IFN-I production. DExD/H-box helicases play regulatory roles in
  the TLR-mediated signaling pathways. The green/T-shaped arrow indicates the interaction
  between DExD/H-box helicases and adaptors and promotes/inhibits signaling. MyD88,
  Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing
  adaptor protein inducing IFN-β; TRAF, TNF-receptor-associated factor; IKK, IκB kinase;
  NEMO, IKKγ, an IKK regulatory subunit; TRAM, TRIF-related adaptor molecule; IκBα,
  nuclear factor-kappa B inhibitor alpha; P, phosphate; ISRE, IFN-stimulated response
