caption: USPs and TGF-β signaling pathway. The TGF-β signaling pathway is activated
  via the binding of TGF-β ligands to TGF-β type II receptors (TβRII). After the binding
  of TβRII, TβRI is recruited to form a functional heterologous complex and is activated
  as TβRI kinase by TβRII, which transphosphorylases the glutamine synthetase domain
  of TβRI. Activated TβRI phosphorylates and activates Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3).
  Activated Smad2/3 interacts with Smad4 to produce an activation complex, which then
  translocate into nucleus to control the transcription of target genes. Smad7, an
  I-Smad, blocks the phosphorylation and activation of Smad2/3 by competing with the
  binding to TβRI. Smad7 also binds to Smurf2 to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase, causing
  the degradation of receptors. Smurf1 and ALK5 function as competitive with Smurf2
  and enhance the turnover of receptors. In addition, TRAF6 and TAK1 facilitate the
  activation of p38 /MAPK and JNK, resulting in the control of cell growth and proliferation.
  Different USPs mediate deubiquitinations in the process of TGF-β canonical and noncanonical
  pathways. TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta; TβRI/II, TGF-β type I/II receptors;
  SMAD2/3/4, small mothers against decapentaplegic 2/3/4; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor
