caption: 'Autophagy regulation by glycolysis. A: The HK II protein contains a TOS
  motif, which allows it to inhibit mTOR by binding to it through this specific motif.
  As a result, it triggers the process of autophagy within the cell. B, C, D: During
  periods of starvation, AMPK is induced, which in turn stimulates the phosphorylation
  of two key glycolysis enzymes, PFKFB3 and GAPDH, and simultaneously promotes autophagy.
  E, F: GAPDH is known to form complexes with Rheb and has been found to inhibit the
  activity of mTOR; when mTOR is inhibited, it leads to the promotion of autophagy.
  G, H: PKM2 plays a role in promoting the JAK/STAT3 pathway and inhibiting the mTOR
  pathway, which ultimately leads to the promotion of autophagy. I: LDH is involved
  in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate while releasing protons as a byproduct.
  The released protons contribute to the acidification of autophagosomes, leading
  to an increase in acidity, which in turn promotes the process of autophagy. PGI:
  phosphoglucose isomerase, PGK: phosphoglycerate kinase, PGM: phosphoglycerate mutase,
  TOS: TOR signaling motif, HK II: Hexokinase 2, PFK-P3: phosphofructokinase, GAPDH:
  Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, PKM2: pyruvate kinase M2, LDH: lactate
  dehydrogenase, AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase, mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin,
  Rheb: Ras homolog enriched in brain, STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription
  proteins, JAK: Janus kinase'
