caption: 'Canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. The canonical Wnt pathway
  is activated by the binding of a Wnt ligands to a frizzled (FZD) family receptor
  and co-receptor LRP5 or LRP6, which recruits disheveled (Dvl), consequently inactivating
  the destruction complex composed of APC, GSK3β, and axin. This inactivation prevents
  β-catenin from proteasomal degradation and allows for the accumulation of β-catenin,
  which then enters the nucleus. There, it binds to transcription factor TCF or LEF
  and initiates the transcription of target genes. Tankyrases (TNKSs) also promote
  signaling by targeting axin for degradation. Moreover, when R-spondin binds to LGR4
  or LGR5, RNF43, and ZNRF3, it is not capable of targeting FZD family receptors for
  degradation and enhances Wnt signaling. There are various inhibitors of the Wnt
  signaling pathway, particularly those targeting Wnt ligands, Dvl, TNKS, β-catenin,
  and PORCN, which are highlighted in red; bars indicate the inhibitory effect. In
  the absence of Wnt ligands, the destruction complex becomes active and starts the
  proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. Proteins RNF43 and ZNRF3 also inhibit the
  binding of FZD and target it for degradation. The noncanonical Wnt–PCP pathway is
  triggered by Wnt ligands that increase the heterodimerization of a receptor-like
  tyrosine kinase (RYK) and tyrosine kinase–like orphan receptor (ROR). The binding
  to the receptor activates the Dvl protein and downstream signaling, for instance,
  DAAM activates GTPases Rho and ROCK, whereas the activation of c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) by Rac is independent of DAAM. They collectively regulate cell polarity
  and migration and have also been implicated in cancer. The Wnt–Ca2+pathway is activated
  by ligand Wnt, which raises the intracellular Ca2+ levels and generates inositol
  1,4,5-triphosphate-3 (IP3). The Ca2+ levels increase and switch on downstream Ca2+-dependent
  enzymes such as calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), calcineurin, and protein
  kinase C (PKC). As a consequence, CaMKII and PKC phosphorylate nuclear factor of
  activated T cells (NFAT) and activate the expression of target genes. Protein symbols
  and abbreviations: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli protein; AP-1, activator protein
  1; DKK1, dickkopf related protein 1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GSK3β, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β; LEF1, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1; LRP, lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein; LGR4/5, Leucine-rich-repeat–containing G protein–coupled receptor 4 or
