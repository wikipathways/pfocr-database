caption: Activation of NF-κB via the canonical pathway and putative sites for redox-regulation.
  TAK1, activated by IL-1R, TNFR, or TLR signaling, phosphorylates IKKβ in the IKK
  complex (see ). IKKβ phosphorylates IκB at serines (Ser) 32 and 36 leading to the
  ubiquitination and degradation of IκB. Deliberated p65/p50 becomes phosphorylated
  by protein kinase A, catalytic subunit (PKAc) at Ser276 in p65, and is translocated
  into the nucleus. There it binds together with the coactivators CBP and p300 to
  the NF-κB responsive element in the promoters of target genes. For binding to DNA,
  cysteine 62 in p50, which can be oxidized to a sulfenic acid forming a mixed disulfide
  with GSH in the cytosol, has to be reduced in the nucleus by the Trx/TrxR or Grx
  system or by the base excision repair enzyme apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox
  factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1).
