caption: TRIM-mediated regulation of innate immune signaling pathways. TRIM proteins
  play a dual role in antiviral immune signaling pathways indicated by black arrows.
  They could positively or negatively regulate antiviral immune signaling pathways,
  indicated by green arrows or red lines, respectively. Also, some TRAM proteins can
  act as common pathogen PRRs, or as cytosolic Fc receptors (such as TRIM21) to recognize
  non-enveloped viruses bound by immunoglobulin (Ig). DDX41, DEAD-box helicase 41;
