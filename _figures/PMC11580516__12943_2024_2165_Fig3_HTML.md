caption: Key Mechanisms of Metabolic and Immune Modulation in the Tumor Microenvironment.
  A Nerve cells secrete norepinephrine, activating β-adrenergic receptors and triggering
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This enhances glucose metabolism and lactate production,
  with mTOR and HIF-1α upregulation intensifying inflammation and metabolic dysfunction,
  contributing to drug resistance. B In the tumor vascular niche, endothelial cells
  under hypoxic conditions regulate angiogenesis via VEGFR2, FGFR, and other receptor-mediated
  pathways. This involves glycolysis, degradation of the basement membrane, endothelial
  progenitor cell migration, and the formation of abnormal blood vessels, promoting
  tumor vascularization and resistance to therapy. C Bacterial metabolism, particularly
  lactate production and microenvironment acidification, modulates the activity of
  tumor-associated immune cells, such as TAMs, DCs, and T cells. This induces cytokine
  release and inflammatory responses, further enhancing tumor cell resistance
