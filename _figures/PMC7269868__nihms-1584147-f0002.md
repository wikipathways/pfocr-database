caption: On the left are shown the steps involved in generating the Glc3Man3GlcNAc2-PP-Dol
  precursor (only limited steps outside of the ER are shown, dashed arrow) that is
  added to the nascent polypeptide following translation by the ribosome and entry
  into the ER. The enzymes catalyzing each of the glycan modification steps are shown.
  The process for generating the dolichol phosphate-linked mannose (Dol-Man) glycans
  that are added to grow the oligosaccharide, is shown bottom left, outside the ER.
  Phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2) catalyzes the isomerization of mannose 6 phosphate (−6-P)
  to mannose 1-phosphate (−1-P). Mannose 1-phosphate is a precursor to GDP-mannose
  necessary for the synthesis of dolichol-P-oligosaccharides. The nascent polypeptide
  is imported into the ER through the SEC61 translocon, that also includes SEC62 and
  SEC63. The oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) transfers the Glc3Man3GlcNAc2 onto the
  peptide, with the chaperone proteins binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and ERdj3
  (encoded by DNAJB11) in attendance. The oligosaccharide structure is further processed
  by glycosidase I (GI) and GII, that consists of α (encoded by GANAB) and β (encoded
  by PRKCSH) subunits. The glycoprotein then enters into the calnexin/calreticulin
  (CNX/CRT) cycle for protein folding. Alternate action of GII and UDP-Glc:glycoprotein
  glucosyltransferase (UGGT) remove and add the α1,3-linked glucose residue, with
  the residue required to bind the calnexin and calreticulin chaperones, until the
  protein is correctly folded or fails to fold. When the protein is correctly folded
  it is exported to the Golgi. If folding ultimately fails, the protein is de-mannosylated
  and becomes a substrate for the ER associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. BiP and
  ERdj3 can bind misfolded proteins. Enzymes and other proteins associated with cystic
  disease are shown in red.
