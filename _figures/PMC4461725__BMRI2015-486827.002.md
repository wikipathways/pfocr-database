caption: Schematics of mechanical force activation of mechanosensitive proteins. (a)
  Cadherins. Cadherins consist of two distinct trans-binding conformations, a strand-swap
  dimer (forming slip bonds, i.e., force accelerates dissociation), and an X-dimer
  (forming catch bonds, i.e., force impedes dissociation). Upon mechanical force application,
  trans-interacting cadherins switch their X-dimeric conformations to the strand-swap
  dimer, converting catch bonds to slip bonds. (b) Integrins. Two signaling pathways
  exist for integrins. In the inside-out signaling pathway, intercellular proteins
  (e.g., talin and/or kindlin) transduce mechanical forces across the membrane, unbending
  integrins and exposing ligand-binding sites. In the outside-in signaling pathway,
  integrin's ligand (e.g., fibronectin) binding to integrin's headpiece induces local
  conformational changes. Mechanical force can further activate integrin's to a long-lived
  state by downward moving α7 helix in either αA and/or βA domain, swinging out hybrid
  domain and separating α and β tails. Such activation can lead to recruiting the
  talin and/or kindlin to reorganize cytoskeleton. (c) Mechanosensitive ion channels.
  Mechanical force activates mechanosensitive ion channels through deforming cell
  membrane (i.e., the bilayer mechanism) and tethering the channels (e.g., the single-tether
  model and the dual-tether model). (d) Talin. Mechanical stretching of talins exposes
  latent binding sites for vinculins, converting the mechanical effect into biochemical
  signals.

  description: Schematics of mechanical force activation of mechanosensitive proteins.
    (a) Cadherins. Cadherins consist of two distinct trans-binding conformations,
    a strand-swap dimer (forming slip bonds, i.e., force accelerates dissociation),
    and an X-dimer (forming catch bonds, i.e., force impedes dissociation). Upon mechanical
    force application, trans-interacting cadherins switch their X-dimeric conformations
    to the strand-swap dimer, converting catch bonds to slip bonds. (b) Integrins.
    Two signaling pathways exist for integrins. In the inside-out signaling pathway,
    intercellular proteins (e.g., talin and/or kindlin) transduce mechanical forces
    across the membrane, unbending integrins and exposing ligand-binding sites. In
    the outside-in signaling pathway, integrin's ligand (e.g., fibronectin) binding
    to integrin's headpiece induces local conformational changes. Mechanical force
    can further activate integrin's to a long-lived state by downward moving α7 helix
    in either αA and/or βA domain, swinging out hybrid domain and separating α and
    β tails. Such activation can lead to recruiting the talin and/or kindlin to reorganize
    cytoskeleton. (c) Mechanosensitive ion channels. Mechanical force activates mechanosensitive
    ion channels through deforming cell membrane (i.e., the bilayer mechanism) and
    tethering the channels (e.g., the single-tether model and the dual-tether model).
    (d) Talin. Mechanical stretching of talins exposes latent binding sites for vinculins,
