caption: Proposed action mechanisms of glutamine in intestinal cells. Glutamine maintains
  intestinal tissue integrity via promoting enterocyte proliferation, activation of
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (ERK1/2, JNK1/2), optimizing the actions
  of growth factors (epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I,
  transforming growth factor (TGF)-α), and inducing expression of tight-junction proteins
  (claudin-1, claudin-4, occludin, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3). Pro-inflammatory
  signaling pathways such as the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and signal transducers
  and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways are inhibited by glutamine. Glutamine
  suppresses extensive apoptosis by participating in the synthesis of glutathione
  (GSH) and by regulating heat shock factor (HSF)-1-mediated expression of heat shock
  proteins (HSPs). Glutamine ameliorates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and promotes
  autophagy by inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, thus
  protecting intestinal cells from stressful conditions. T bars mean inhibition while
  arrows represent stimulation.
