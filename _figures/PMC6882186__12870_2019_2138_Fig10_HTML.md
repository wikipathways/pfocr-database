caption: Proposed pathways for polysaccharide biosynthesis in Dendrobium moniliforme.
  Activated monosaccharide units, marked in red with purple background; key enzymes,
  marked in purple with green background. Bolded text with red background indicates
  key intermediates, various blocks represent the logarithms of FPKM values for different
  samples (stem, root and leaf from left to right). The real line arrows represent
  the identified enzymatic reactions, and the dashed line arrows represent multiple
  enzymatic reactions by multiple steps
