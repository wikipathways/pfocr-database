caption: The folate cycle and related enzymes (gray circled). SHMT1, MTHFR, and MTR
  constitute a cytoplasmic cyclic pathway that is linked to methionine (Met) synthesis
  from homocysteine (Hcy) at the MTR reaction. Mitochondrial 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  (5,10-methyleneTHF) synthesized by SHMT2 contributes to cytoplasmic THF production
  via sequential MTHFD-mediated enzymatic reactions including provision of formate
  to the cytoplasm. AdoMet, AdoHcy, and DMG represent S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine,
  and dimethylglycine, respectively
