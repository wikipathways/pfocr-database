caption: Activation of NLRs, non‐canonical and canonical inflammasomes. Structure
  and activating ligands of canonical NLRP3, NLRC4, NLRP1 (human NLRP1 inflammasome
  contains PYD, mouse NLRP1 does not), NLRP6 and AIM2 inflammasomes, as well as non‐canonical
  NLRP3 inflammasome, and NLRC3 and NLRX1, which are non‐inflammasome forming NLRs.
  Human and mouse NLRs and AIM2 get activated in response to distinct ligands. Double‐stranded
  RNA (dsRNA) is an activator of human NLRP1 while anthrax lethal toxin activates
  murine NLRP1B. NLRC4 inflammasome gets activated by T3SS/T4SS indirectly by detecting
  flagellin, or directly by detecting the T3SS rod protein. Mouse NAIP5 and 6 detect
  flagellin, mouse NAIP 1 and 2 as well as human NAIP respond to proteins of type
  III secretion systems (T3SS). Upon ligand binding, NAIP and NLRC4 assemble into
  an oligomerized inflammasome. Among several bacterial ligands of AIM2, Francisella
  tularensis and Listeria monocytogenes act as activators of mouse AIM2 inflammasome.
  DNA and RNA viruses are ligands to mostly human AIM2 inflammasome. Canonical activation
  of inflammasomes results in oligomerization of ASC into speck complexes, recruiting
  pro‐caspase 1 leading to self‐cleavage and activation of caspase 1. Caspase 1 cleaves
  pro‐IL‐1β (produced by NFκB‐induced upregulation) and pro‐IL‐18, as well as GSDMD
  cleavage. The N‐terminal fragment of GSDMD forms pores on the cell membrane and
  enables secretion of IL‐1β and IL‐18, with subsequent pyroptosis. Non‐canonical
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation occurs via human caspase 4 and 5 or murine caspase
  11. Sensing of intracellular LPS by pro‐caspase 11 leads to caspase 11 activation
  and subsequent GSDMD cleavage, as well as K+ efflux promoting the activation of
  NLRP3‐ASC‐caspase 1 pathway
