caption: Monogenic SAIDs with chronic elevation of serum IL-18 and the relevant inflammasomes.
  NLRC4-AID is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the NLRC4 gene and is characterized
  by a high incidence of macrophage activation syndrome. The chronic nature of IL-18
  elevation observed in XIAP deficiency primarily depends on the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  whereas an inflammasome-independent pathway may in part have a role in mature IL-18
  overproduction. Pyrin inflammasome is associated with IL-18-mediated autoinflammation
  in actin remodeling defects such as CDC42 C-terminal disease, PSTPIP1-associated
  inflammatory diseases (PAID), and WDR1 deficiency. Pyrin may serve as a sensor for
  actin-cytoskeleton dynamics. NLRP3 involvement is also observed in several subtypes
  of PAID such as PAPA syndrome and PAMI syndrome. SAIDs, systemic autoinflammatory
  diseases; CDC42, cell division cycle 42; IL, interleukin; NLRC4-AID, NLR family
  caspase activation and recruitment domain-containing protein 4-associated autoinflammatory
  disease; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; PAMI, PSTPIP1-associated myeloid-related
  proteinemia inflammatory; PAPA, pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum,
  and acne; PSTPIP1, proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1; WDR1,
  WD repeat-containing domain 1; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis.
