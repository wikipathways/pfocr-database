caption: Activated T cells in response to self-antigen activate B lymphocytes and
  macrophages (Mf). Abatacept is a fusion protein that binds to CD80 and CD86 receptors
  on APC to inhibit T cell activation. Activated T cells act as a crucial upstream
  regulatory process to induce immunological responses of B cells through increased
  production of autoantibodies and rheumatoid factors (RF), and abatacept also suppresses
  downstream B cell activation. Mff activation is also suppressed by abatacept as
  a result of T cell suppression. Rituximab is a targeted B cell therapy that acts
  by depleting CD20+ B cells. Various anti-TNF therapies (infliximab, adalimumab and
  etanercept), anti-IL6R (toclizumab) and anti-IL-1 (anakinra) act by neutralizing
  pro-inflammatory cytokines release by activated Mf. Downstream regulation represents
  final common pathway of joint destruction executed by osteoclasts (bone destruction)
  and chondrocytes (by secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs). Black arrows-increased
  secretion and red lines-inhibition/neutralization.
