caption: (a) Inactivity of the enzyme antiquitin coded by the ALDH7A1 gene leads to
  (b) accumulation of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde (α-AASA) and its cyclic counterpart
  piperideine-6-carboxylic acid (P6C). (c) P6C can react spontaneously with several
  β-ketoacids or β-diacids, resulting in the formation of a range of P6C-derived biomarkers
  (1–4), several of which are identified here. Orange arrows indicate metabolites
  found at elevated levels in PDE.
