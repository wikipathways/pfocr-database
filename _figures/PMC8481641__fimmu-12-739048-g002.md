caption: 'Hypothetical model for how decreased SIRPs CD47 signaling may lead to a
  pro-inflammatory phenotype in leukocytes: (A) In antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
  such as dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes/macrophages, signal regulatory protein
  alpha (SIRPα) and CD47 are co-expressed, whereby SIRPα can bind CD47 expressed on
  other cell types (e.g., leukocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells) in trans
  or possibly via in cis interactions, thus activating the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) on its cytoplasmic tail (, , , , ). CD47 is activated
  by either thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1), SIRPα, or SIRPγ, where it is hypothesized that
  inhibitory G protein (Gi) binding inhibits inflammasome activation, pro-inflammatory
  cytokine expression, proliferation, and phagocytosis (, ). These processes may be
  augmented if SIRPα and/or CD47 expression are decreased. (B) SIRPγ and CD47 are
  co-expressed in T and natural killer (NK) cells (–, ). CD47 ligation is hypothesized
  to inhibit T and NK cell activation via inhibition of unknown downstream elements
  of the zeta chain of T cell receptor-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) activation,
  inhibition phosphorylation of the mitogen-associated protein kinase (MEK), and inhibition
  of phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) (, –). BCL2
  interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) is a mediator of apoptosis that may be upregulated
  by activation of CD47 (, , ). Decrease expression of CD47 and/or SIRPγ could potentially
  augment T cells and NK cells in a way that results in a more activated phenotype
  and increase proliferation in these immune cells. (C) Other examples of the effect
  of SIRPγ:CD47 signaling in T cells. Upregulation of CD47 signaling is hypothesized
  to increase T cell transmigration; however, it is not known for sure if this increase
  in transmigration alters activation of the T cell (, ). CD47 ligation is also hypothesized
  to help maintain the naivety of T cells, and, once activated, promotes these T cells
  to differentiate to a more central memory phenotype (–). If loss of SIRPγ:CD47 signaling
  occurs in T cells, it is hypothesized that this will contribute towards the differentiation
  to more effector and effector memory phenotypes along with a loss of transmigration.
