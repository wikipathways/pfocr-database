caption: Three models of how IRE1α might sense ER stress. Currently, three models
  of IRE1α activation by unfolded proteins are being discussed. (A) The ‘competition’
  or ‘chaperone inhibition’ model attributes a more passive role to the UPR transducer
  IRE1α and suggests that BiP acts as the true sensor of ER stress. The chaperone
  BiP associates dynamically with IRE1α molecules in the absence of stress and counteracts
  the intrinsic tendency of IRE1α to dimerize/oligomerize. Upon ER stress BiP associates
  with unfolded/misfolded proteins, thereby dissociating from IRE1α and enabling its
  dimerization and activation. (B) The ‘allosteric’ model suggests that BiP’s nucleotide
  binding domain (NBD) associates with IRE1α to sterically block its dimerization/oligomerization.
  The accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER is sensed
  by BiP’s substrate binding domain (SBD). The binding of unfolded proteins to the
  open SBD induces a conformational change in BiP and the dissociation from IRE1α.
  (C) The ‘direct’ model suggests a direct binding of unfolded/misfolded proteins
  to the ER-luminal domain of IRE1α. Unfolded proteins are thought to bind to peptide-binding
  pockets across the dimer interface of IRE1α’s ER-luminal domain. Unfolded proteins
  stabilize dimeric and oligomeric assemblies of IRE1α, and therefore serve as activating
  ligands triggering the UPR.
