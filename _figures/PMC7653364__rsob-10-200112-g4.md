caption: Dysregulation of A-to-I RNA editing promotes cancer progression. ADAR1 upregulation
  leads to elevated editing within targets, e.g. AZIN1, DHFR, GLI1 and FAK. The increase
  in A-to-I editing of these targets contributes to cancer development and progression
  via different cellular pathways. AZIN1 editing increases polyamine biosynthesis
  resulting in increased cell proliferation. Editing of the 3′-UTR of DHFR increases
  the stability of the mRNA and hence causes resistance to anti-folates. Edited GLI1
  upregulates the Hedgehog pathway and therefore enables cells to self-renew. Edited
  FAK mRNA degrades slowly causing a build-up of FAK which results in increased cell
  migration and invasion. Downregulation of ADAR1 editing decreases the editing of
  GABRA3. Unedited GABRA3 promotes cancer cell invasion and metastasis through upregulation
  of the Akt pathway. A decrease in ADAR2 editing activity affects targets such as
  IGFBP7 and miR-221, -222, -21. Unedited IGFBP7 mRNA is highly unstable and results
  in inhibition of senescence. Hypoediting of miR-221, -222, -21 leads to an increase
  in their maturation resulting in faster cells cycling. Red mark indicates A-to-I
  editing, while blue dot indicates an unedited site.
