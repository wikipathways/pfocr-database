caption: 'Representative scheme of the 15 genes shared by the selected pathways using
  pathway enrichment analysis. Our model shows the mechanisms that converge to activate
  NFATC2 and other targets such as PIK3CG that are shared by the action of different
  stimuli. Some factors in the tumor microenvironment (COL6A2, COL6A3, COL12A1, COL14A1,
  chemokines, cytokines, etc.) can promote crosstalk between NFATC2 and PIK3CG and
  can promote crosstalk between receptor types (ITGB7, ITGAL, PTPRC, chemokine R)
  that induce the activation of signals (ITPR3, PIK3CG, PIK3R2, VAV1, RAC2) that have
  downstream pro-inflammatory and non-pro-inflammatory effects: production of PTGS2,
  cytokines, and chemokines and activation of T and B cells'
