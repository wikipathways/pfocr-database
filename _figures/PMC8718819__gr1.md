caption: Role of Rho GTPases in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritisRho GTPases
  in the active (GTP-bound) states activate various downstream pathways involved in
  rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. For osteoarthritis, Cdc42 increases the
  expression of TNC and PRG4 in chondrocytes through MRTF-A and YAP/TAZ, which are
  chondroprotective cartilage. In contrast, Cdc42 activates PAK to induce JAK/STAT3
  activation and articular degeneration. Cdc42 and Rac1 activate JNK and further induce
  MMP-9 expression, which is responsible for collagen degradation. MMP3/13 are also
  regulated by Rac1 by p38 MAPK and Akt/NF-κB signaling. RhoA/ROCK activation also
  induces cartilage degradation. COX2 and NOS2 activated by Rac1 lead to inflammation.
  For rheumatoid arthritis, both Cdc42 and Rac1 enhance angiogenesis and platelet
  microparticle formation. Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA upregulate MMP-2/9, F-actin, and
  FAK expression to increase FLS migration. Rac1 induces PAK and JNK activation to
  increase the migration of FLSs. Rac1 also promotes the production of TNF-α, IFN-γ,
  and IL-17 by T cells. Rac1 and RhoA enhance the anti-apoptotic effects of FLSs via
  the PI3K/Akt pathway. RhoA/ROCK induces NF-κB activation and IL-23 production in
  macrophages. Purple, orange, and green arrows indicate molecules mediated by Cdc42,
  Rac1, and RhoA, respectively. Green boxes indicate common pathogenetic pathways
  shared by rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The left panel demonstrates the
  mechanisms of four major types of Rho GTPase inhibitors. Spatial regulation inhibitors
  target the posttranslational modifications of Rho GTPases. GEF interaction inhibitors
