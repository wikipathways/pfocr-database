caption: 'Summary of various metabolic pathways involving p21. A schematic showing
  p21’s central role in multiple biological pathways. In the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade,
  activation triggers p21 to bind with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), exerting inhibitory
  control over the cell cycle. Metabolic stress, including low glucose levels, influences
  p21 modulation, ultimately leading to the upregulation of both p53 and p21, resulting
  in cell cycle arrest. p21 actively participates in anti-oncogenic pathways by binding
  with PCNA for DNA repair. The diagram illustrates p21 and p53’s interplay, with
  p53 sensing oncogenic processes and p21 acting as a cycle progression switch. The
  RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway was observed in mice embryonic stem cells [165]. The AMPK
  pathway was observed in human embryonic kidney cells [156]. The p53/TIGAR pathway
  was observed in various human tumor cells including breast, lung, and bone tumor
  (osteosarcoma) cells [146]. The p53/RRAD pathway was observed in human lung cancer
  cells [147]. The p53/GLUT pathway was observed in human bone tumor (osteosarcoma)
  cells [150]. The p53/G6PD pathway was observed in human lung cancer cells [151].
