caption: The effect of Aβ on selected components of microglia–neuron dialogue in AD.
  In this figure, the effect of Aβ on neurons and microglia is demonstrated. Aβ peptides
  evoke the release of glutamate and ATP from neurons, which activates neuronal NMDA
  and other receptors and in microglial cells exerts a significant effect on purinergic
  receptors. Aβ-activated microglia change tryptophan metabolism toward the kynurenine
  (KYN) pathway, which leads to an increase in the level of KYN and other molecules
  affecting glutamatergic signaling, such as quinolinic acid (QUIN), which may evoke
  excitotoxicity. Microglia concomitantly release neurotrophic factors, among them
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), leading to stimulation of tropomyosin
  receptor kinase B (TrkB) and release of chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1).
  The proper function of microglia is dependent on the TREM2 (triggering receptor
  expressed on myeloid cells 2) receptor, which is engaged in the clearance of Aβ
  and other pathological proteins, but also in the elimination of neurons and synapses,
  and in the suppression of neuroinflammation. TREM2 is also responsible for the switch
  of microglia phenotype to disease-associated state (disease-associated microglia,
  DAM).
