caption: The role of SRC kinase during megakaryopoiesis. During megakaryocyte (MK)
  maturation, MK migrate from the osteoblastic to the vascular niche by interacting
  with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The mature MK use podosomes to migrate
  from the osteoblastic to the vascular niche and through the vascular wall, to extend
  proplatelets and finally release platelets into the blood circulation. Opposite
  to its role in platelets, the integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling pathway is not
  active in maturating MK. SRC can activate the actin-binding protein cortactin (CTTN)
  during MK maturation.
