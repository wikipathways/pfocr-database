caption: Effect of SP_2854 deletion on primary metabolism in S. pogona. This regulatory
  network is based on the analysis of differentially expressed proteins and metabolites
  associated with glucose transport, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and
  the TCA cycle. Reactions are reported according to KEGG metabolic pathway databases.
  A triangle represents a change in protein abundance, and an arrow represents a change
  in metabolite abundance
