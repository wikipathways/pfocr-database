caption: Co-expression network for the PP group based on lncRNA key regulators. The
  co-expression networks based on the lncRNA key regulators found connections with
  478 mRNA in the PP group. These mRNA were identified as being involved in fat-cell
  differentiation, in utero embryonic development, the transforming growth factor
  beta (TGF-β) receptor signaling pathway, the semaphorin–plexin signaling pathway,
  and skeletal muscle tissue development processes
