caption: The P. aeruginosa virulence regulatory network. The pathogenic potential
  of P. aeruginosa is dictated by multiple virulence systems that are regulated transcriptionally,
  post-transcriptionally and post-translationally. The central mechanism for P. aeruginosa
  virulence regulation is QS, which controls expression of many virulence factors
  in a population density-dependent manner. Key activators of this system are LasR,
  RhlR, MvfR, VqsR, the cAMP receptor protein Vfr and the stationary phase σ factor
  RpoS. Las system repressors include RsaL, the H-NS protein MvaT, the σ factor RpoN
  and the sRNA-binding protein RsmA, whereas others like QscR repress both the Las
  and Rhl systems. Other regulators such as AmpR affect QS genes by an unknown mechanism.
  QS plays a role in regulating critical pathogenic mechanisms, including biofilm
  formation, secretion systems, production of numerous virulence factors, efflux pumps,
  antibiotic resistance and motility. Acute P. aeruginosa infections can lead to chronic
  infections in response to largely unidentified signals. A key regulatory pathway
  that controls this lifestyle switch is the RetS–LadS–GacSA–RsmA pathway. RetS and
  LadS are hybrid sensor proteins that, in response to external signals, either activate
  or repress the GacSA TCS. The GacA regulator then activates transcription of two
  rgRNAs, rgRsmZ and rgRsmY that sequester and inhibit activity of the sRNA-binding
  protein, RsmA. RsmA is a key activator/repressor that post-transcriptionally regulates
  numerous acute and chronic infection phenotypes, including multiple QS-regulated
  virulence factors, biofilm formation, Type 2, Type 3 and Type 6 secretion systems
  and motility. Another major phenotypic change associated with the switch from acute
  to chronic phases of infection is the formation of biofilm. This is associated with
  extensive changes in transcription. Three key TCS involved in activating biofilm
  formation are BfiSR, MifR and BfmSR. Cyclic-di-GMP is another major player influencing
  this process, whose levels are controlled by diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases.
  QS and the cup genes enhance biofilms, whereas regulators like AmpR repress it.
  An important component of P. aeruginosa biofilms are extracellular polysaccharides,
  such as alginate, Pel and Psl. Alginate production is under the control of the master
  regulator ECF AlgT/U, whose activity is regulated transcriptionally by AmpR, post-translationally
  by MucA and MucB and by regulated intermembrane proteolysis involving MucP, AlgW,
  ClpXP and others. AlgT/U activates the alginate biosynthetic operon through AlgR,
  AlgB and AmrZ. In addition, biofilm formation is also affected by iron concentration,
  a process governed by the master repressor of iron uptake, Fur. Fur controls uptake
  of iron by regulating the σ factor PvdS, thereby modulating sidephore levels. Fur
  also modulates transcription of two key regulatory RNAs, asPrrF1 and asPrrF2. These
  two sRNAs are involved not only in regulating iron-uptake-related genes but also
  enzymes of the trichloroacetic acid cycle and genes involved in anthranilate synthesis.
  Anthralinate, a precursor for synthesis of PQS, is a key regulatory molecule of
  the PQS signalling system in P. aeruginosa, which is involved in expression of QS-regulated
  virulence factors. Details on the individual interactions and the appropriate references
  can be found in the text. Some of the interactions labelled as indirect are regulated
  by unknown mechanisms and warrant further investigation. In the figure, some regulators
  and phenotypes have been mentioned more than once.
