  could interact with RAGE, leading to the activation of MAP kinases and NF̃κB signaling.
  Depending of the status of Smad4 in the cells, S100A8/A9 has been shown to activate
  differentially AKT, NF-κB and the mTOR signaling pathway. S100A9 may form a heterocomplex
  with TGF-β, resulting in modulating the TGF-β signaling pathway. S100A9 could also
  promote tumor growth through the engagement of TLR4, as demonstrated in prostate
  tumors.
