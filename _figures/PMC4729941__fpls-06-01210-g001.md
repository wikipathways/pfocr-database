caption: '14-3-3 proteins during stomatal movements. (A) Stomatal opening: the perception
  of blue light by phototropins PHOT1 and PHOT2 leads to their autophosphorylation
  and subsequent 14-3-3 binding. In Arabidopsis, the 14-3-3λ isoform is required for
  PHOT2-mediated stomatal opening. Blue light stimulates the plasma membrane H+-ATPase
  by phosphorylation at its C-terminus end and subsequent 14-3-3 binding. The fungal
  toxin FC stabilizes the 14-3-3/H+-ATPase interaction leading to constant activation
  of the proton pump and thus irreversible stomatal opening. Activation of H+-ATPases
  leads to hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane and uptake of K+ via inward-rectifying
  K+ channels (Kin) including K+ channel A. thaliana 1 and 2 (KAT1, KAT2) and Arabidopsis
  K+ transporter 1 (AKT1). KAT1 is activated by 14-3-3 binding. K+ influx induces
  inward water movement leading to guard cell swelling and stomatal opening. At the
  tonoplast, a Cl- channel providing a pathway for anion uptake into the vacuole is
  activated by the calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK) CPK1, whose activity might
  be directly stimulated by 14-3-3s. (B) Stomatal closing: ABA induces activation
  of protein kinase open stomata 1 (OST1) as well as CPKs. Among the CPKs involved
  in guard cell ABA signaling, CPK21 could bind to 14-3-3 proteins and CPK3 might
  be stabilized by its interaction with 14-3-3s. OST1 and CPKs can activate the guard
  cell plasma membrane S-type anion channel SLAC1 (slow anion channel-associated 1)
  by phosphorylation. SLAC1 homolog 3 (SLAH3), another guard cell S-type anion channel,
  is also activated by CPK3. Activation of anion channels leads to plasma membrane
  depolarization and activation of the guard cell outward-rectifying K+ (GORK) channel
  which is a putative 14-3-3 client protein. The efflux of ions leads to water loss
  and guard cell shrinkage, thus closure of the stomatal pore. During stomatal closure,
  K+ release from vacuoles occurs via vacuolar K+-selective (VK) channels, slow vacuolar
  (SV) channels and fast vacuolar (FV) channels. The tandem-pore K+ channel 1 (TPK1)
  represents the guard cell VK channel which might be activated by 14-3-3 binding
  to a N-terminal site phosphorylated by CPK3. In contrast, SV channels, represented
  by the two-pore channel 1 (TPC1) in Arabidopsis, might be inactivated by 14-3-3
  binding. Stomatal closure induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
  or ABA involves plasma membrane respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs) which
  are targets of OST1. RBOHs are NADPH oxidases producing reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) in the apoplast and might be activated by interaction with 14-3-3 proteins.
  The Pseudomonas syringae effector HopM1 could suppress PAMP-triggered ROS production
  and stomatal closure by destabilization of 14-3-3 proteins. Pink lines show 14-3-3
  regulation on target proteins. Arrowheads designate activation, bars indicate inhibition.
  Dashed lines denote more than one step, solid lines show direct interaction. Question
  marks denote signaling events that require further investigation in guard cells.
  The P in the yellow-colored disks indicates a phosphorylated protein. See the text
  for details.'
