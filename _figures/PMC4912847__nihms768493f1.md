caption: The pathway of miRNA synthesis and its function (top). In the nucleus, miRNAs
  are transcribed from DNA forming a primary transcript, pri-miRNA. The RNase III
  enzyme DROSHA cleaves pri-miRNA to produce a precursor, pre-miRNA that is transported
  to the cytoplasm through a nuclear export protein Exportin-5. In the cytoplasm,
  pre-miRNAs are cleaved by DICER to form a miRNA duplex. In general, only one strand
  of the miRNA duplex is used as the mature miRNA while the other strand is degraded
  because of less stability. Mature miRNA binds to the 3′UTR of target mRNA and is
  loaded into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). As a result, this complex inhibits
  the process of mRNA translation or enhances mRNA degradation leading to translational
  suppression.Contents of exosomes (bottom). Typical exosomes contain various cargoes
  including pre-miRNAs, mature miRNAs, and mRNAs as well as membrane marker proteins,
  endosome-associated (MVB-derived) proteins, and heat shock proteins (chaperones).
