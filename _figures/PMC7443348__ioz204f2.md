caption: Normal 5-HT signaling in the placenta and effects of SSRI on this signaling
  pathway. (A) In normal TB cells, 5-HT binds to SERT and is translocated into the
  cell, whereupon its actions are terminated. (B) In TB cells exposed to SSRI, this
  pharmaceutical agent competitively binds to SERT, which prevents 5-HT from binding
  to this protein. Consequently, an increase in extracellular concentrations of 5-HT
  are available to bind to 5HT(2A)R and other similar receptors residing within the
  plasma membrane that may mediate 5-HT signaling pathways.
