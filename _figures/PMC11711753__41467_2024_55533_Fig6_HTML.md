caption: A Edited screenshot from PTMNavigator showing an excerpt from the pathway
  diagram “Regulation of Actin Cytoskeleton – WP51” and the modified peptides regulated
  in the Refametinib (left) and Mirdametinib (right) decryptM experiments. All regulations
  are downregulations. B Pathway graph of the Refametinib dataset generated by PHONEMeS.
  The kinases with decreased activity (determined by RoKAI + KSEA) were used as perturbation
  targets in the PHONEMeS input. C Proposed manual extension to the diagram “WP51”,
  created using the “Editing Mode” within PTMNavigator. For illustrative purposes,
  nodes and edges added by hand are shown in green. Source data for (A, B) are provided
  as a Source Data file
