caption: VEGF and TNF signaling in retinal vascular disease. Increased expression
  of angiogenic and inflammatory factors (such as VEGF and TNFα) are associated with
  retinal vascular diseases. (1) The binding of VEGF to VEGFR2 in complex with αvβ3
  integrin stimulates the autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 and the activation of downstream
  cellular processes. (2) These processes include the induction of migration and proliferation
  important for angiogenesis and the reorganization of diffuse actin into stress fibers
  and the internalization of cell–cell adhesion proteins that result in increased
  permeability. (3) VEGFR2 signaling also stimulates the release of Ang2 from Weibel-Palade
  bodies, which then competes with Ang1 to bind to Tie2 and reduce the associated
  signaling pathways related to vascular stability and anti-permeability. (4) With
  respect to inflammatory signaling, the binding of TNFα to the TNFR also stimulates
  the release of Ang2 from Weibel-Palade bodies (5) and reduces the activation of
  Tie2. This not only reduces the vessel stabilizing pathways mentioned above but
  also blocks the anti-inflammatory activity of the Tie2 receptor as well. (6) The
  activation of the TNFR pathway by TNFα also stimulates the relocation of NF-κB to
  the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor to induce the expression
  of numerous inflammation-associated genes. (7) Among other functions, the initiation
  of inflammation stimulates increased permeability within blood vessels
