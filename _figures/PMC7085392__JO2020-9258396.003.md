caption: Activation of Akt after joining to PIP3 by its PH domain. PDK1 and PDK2,
  present in mTORC2, phosphorylate Akt, which will activate and inhibit a series of
  genes, transcription factors, and proteins, represented in red, such as the TSC
  complex, which will eventually activate mTORC1, resulting in a series of cellular
  responses. We have remarked in green the components which are stimulated or overactive
  in these cells. This figure also shows the main therapies developed to focus on
  this pathway.
