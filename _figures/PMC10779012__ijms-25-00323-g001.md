caption: 'Metabolism of cholesterol within an ovarian cancer cell. (a) De novo cholesterol
  biosynthesis starts with acetyl-coenzyme A (ACoA) and is then synthesized in more
  than 20 enzymatic steps, while 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR),
  farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1), and squalene epoxidase (SQLE)
  act as rate-limiting enzymes. (b) Cholesterol uptake is mediated by the ligation
  of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to its receptor (LDLR), which is followed by endocytosis
  of LDL. This uptake creates high cholesterol accumulation, leading to intracellular
  lipo-toxicity and suppressing sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2)
  transcription factor activity, thereby restricting the expression of enzymes involved
  in cholesterol synthesis and LDLR-mediated cholesterol uptake. (c) Excess cholesterol
  is converted into cholesterol esters (CE) by acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase
  1 (ACAT1), also known as sterol-O-Acyl transferase 1 (SOAT1) enzyme, is then stored
  in lipid droplets. (d) Excess cholesterol is also converted to oxysterol through
  multiple enzymatic or non-enzymatic processes, which then activates liver X receptor
  (LXR)-retinoid X receptor (RXR) signaling and results in gene expression of ATP-binding
  cassette (ABC) subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) and ABC subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1),
  which promote the (e) cholesterol efflux pathway. The cholesterol exported by ABCA1
  is transported by lipid-free apolipoprotein A-1 (APOA1), producing immature high-density
  lipoprotein (HDL) that is converted into mature HDL by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase
  (LCAT) in the plasma. The cholesterol exported by ABCG1 can directly become mature
  HDL, which can be consumed by liver cells or steroidogenic cells (e.g., ovarian
  cells) by binding to HDL receptor-scavenger receptor type B1 (SR-B1), activating
  downstream pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation, growth, and migration.
