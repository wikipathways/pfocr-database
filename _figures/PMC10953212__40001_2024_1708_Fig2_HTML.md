caption: Schematic representation of the glucose–insulin signaling pathway. Binding
  of insulin to its receptor (IR) stimulates activation of downstream PI3K/Akt cascade.
  Activation of Akt by insulin results in glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis through
  GSK3 and FoxO1, respectively. ENPP1 interacts with Insulin receptor and inhibits
  its kinase activity. The GCK phosphorylates glucose in the hepatocyte to G6P and
  allows glucose to enter the cell. During glycolysis which is regulated by GCKR through
  inhibiting GCK, pyruvate is generated and transported to the mitochondria where
  it is decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA leading to de novo lipogenesis. The activity
  of SREBP1c is upregulated by insulin signaling, whereas ChREBP has been identified
  as a glucose-activated transcription factor, both of which contribute to de novo
  lipogenesis and fatty acid synthesis. During DNL, the ACC enzyme converts acetyl-CoA
  to malonyl-CoA, and then the FASN enzyme produces SFAs. Additionally, SCD1 transforms
  SFAs into MUFA, which is used as a substrate for the production of fatty acids.
