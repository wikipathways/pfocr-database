caption: 'Oxygen-dependent regulatory pathway of HIF-1α. (1) The oxygen-dependent
  regulatory pathway of HIF-1α encompasses two mechanisms: Under normal oxygen levels,
  the stability of HIF-1α is controlled by intracellular prolyl hydroxylase (PHD),
  which modifies specific proline residues on HIF-1α through hydroxylation when oxygen
  levels are sufficient. The VHL protein (Von Hippel–Lindau protein) is also involved
  in oxygen-dependent regulation, leading to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation
  of HIF-1α. However, under hypoxic conditions or reduced oxygen levels, decreased
  PHD activity diminishes the degradation of HIF-1α, resulting in increased protein
  stability and the capacity to enter the nucleus and activate HIF-1α-dependent gene
  transcription. (2) Factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH) protein is another crucial oxygen-dependent
  regulatory protein. Under normoxic conditions, FIH restricts the transcriptional
  activity of HIF-1α by hydroxylating aspartic acid residues on HIF-1α, thereby impeding
  its binding to the transcriptional cofactor p300/CBP. Conversely, under hypoxic
  conditions, decreased activity of FIH allows HIF-1α to enhance its transcriptional
  activity by binding to p300/CBP. EIF4E, HIF-1α, HIF-1β, and the coactivators p300/CBP
  form a complex to activate downstream target genes as part of the hypoxia response.
  Under low oxygen conditions, HIF-1α stability is enhanced, enabling it to translocate
  to the cell nucleus, where it dimerizes with HIF-1β to form the HIF-1 complex. This
  complex binds to hypoxia response elements in the promoter regions of target genes.
  Concurrently, p300/CBP coactivators interact with the HIF-1 complex, enhancing its
  transcriptional activity. EIF4E, a key post-transcriptional regulatory factor, interacts
  with the HIF-1/p300/CBP complex, modulating the translation of specific mRNAs, and
  resulting in enhanced protein synthesis. This collective action serves to activate
  downstream target genes involved in the cellular response to low oxygen levels and
  related biological processes'
