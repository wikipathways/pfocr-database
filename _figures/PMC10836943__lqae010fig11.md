caption: Potential antibacterial targets were identified with mergem in Fluxer by
  comparing GEMs of three gram-negative pathogens, including Acinetobacter baumanii,
  Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The resulting common pathways
  included shikimate and riboflavin (insets), which hence are good candidates as antimicrobial
  targets
