caption: Schematic representation showing phagosomal rupture-mediated phagosomal escape
  of MAB-R in infected murine macrophage, leading to Type I INF production via the
  cGAS-STING-IRF3 axis. Live M. abscessus (MAB-R and -S) move into macrophage cells
  by phagocytosis. However, different life styles within macrophages were found between
  MAB-R and MAB-S strains. MAB-S strains remain silent in the phagosome and cannot
  lead to phagosomal rupture mediated escape to cytosol. So, MAB-S strains also cannot
  activate Type 1 IFN production via the cGAS-STING-IRF3 pathway. However, MAB-R can
  replicate in the phagosome (1) and cause phagosomal rupture (2). MAB-R can escape
  to the cytosol (3), which produce Type I IFN (IFNβ) via the cGAS-STING-IRF3 pathway
  (4). Furthermore, MAB-R can move to adjacent cells by Type I IFN receptor-dependent
  cell-to-cell spreading. ESX-4 locus, which has been recently reported to be related
  to phagosomal rupture (), may contribute into replication in phagosome (1), phagosome
  rupture (2), and escape into cytosol of MAB-R (3). Finally, secreted IFN-β by MAB-R
  infections could also contribute into bacteria proliferation by interfering with
  IFN-γ signaling pathway ().
