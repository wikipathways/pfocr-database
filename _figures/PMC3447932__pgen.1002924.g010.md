caption: (A) During early eye development, Mitf is expressed in optic neuroepithelial
  cells (MitfONC) in response to upstream activators. Vsx2 expression is activated
  in the newly specified retinal domain by upstream activators, which leads to repression
  of Mitf in RPCs (MitfRPC) and suppression of the pigmentation program. (B) In orJ
  mice, Mitf persists in RPCs because the VSX2 protein is absent, which increases
  the probability that pigmentation will occur. (C) In R200Q mice, VSX2[R200Q] protein
  is present but unable to bind DNA, allowing Mitf to persist in RPCs, increasing
  the probability of pigmentation. (D) In R227W mice, VSX2[R227W] protein is present
  and may still suppress the pathway that leads to pigmentation in orJ and R200Q RPCs,
  but its interaction with Mitf combined with its weak DNA binding activity engages
  a novel positive feedback loop that activates a robust pigmentation program. Our
  genetic data place Otx1 downstream of p27 and D-Mitf, but the mechanism causing
  its elevated expression is not clear.
