caption: Underground metabolism circumvents metabolic defects. A) An underground pathway
  for PLP synthesis in a ΔpdxB E. coli strain []. 3-Phosphohydroxypyruvate (3PHP)
  from serine biosynthesis is converted to 4-hydroxythreonine (4HT) and 4-phosphohydroxythreonine
  (4PHT). Purple arrows indicate steps catalyzed by promiscuous enzymes. B) Two underground
  pathways for the synthesis of β-alanine in a ΔpanD strain []. One pathway alters
  flux through the uracil synthesis and degradation pathways (blue box). The other
  pathway re-routes aspartate semialdehyde, an intermediate in amino acid synthesis
  (orange box). Thick arrows indicate increased flux due to a mutation in a repressor.
  Red asterisks and dashed arrows indicate mutations that decrease enzyme activity.
  Purple arrows indicate steps catalyzed by promiscuous enzymes, and the purple asterisk
  indicates a mutation that increased a catalytically promiscuous activity.
