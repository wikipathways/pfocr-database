caption: Proposed model for interaction between cesium response and sulphur-mediated
  alleviation. The genes denoted in italics are the ones whose expression was investigated
  in this study. The transcripts and the metabolites indicated in red and blue were
  shown in this study or the previous study () to be increased or decreased, respectively,
  in response to cesium. The metabolites in green boxes are the ones with an ability
  to alleviate cesium-induced aerial chlorosis. The pathway in grey was proposed not
  to be involved.
