caption: BMP signalling pathway. BMP binds to BMPR-I and BMPR-II to form a signall-transducing
  complex. BMPR-II phosphorylates the GS domain of BMPR-I. Subsequently, BMPR-I phosphorylates
  signal transduction proteins Smad 1, 5 or 8 (R-Smads). The phosphorylation of R-Smads
  is inhibited and modulated by inhibitory Smad 6 and 7 (I-Smads). R-Smads interact
  with Smad 4 (Co-Smad) to form a complex. The R-Smads/Co-Smad complex enters the
  nucleus and activates the transcription of BMP-response genes. HSPGs are found in
  the extracellular matrix or bound to the cell membrane. HSPGs are composed of HS
  chains attached to a protein core. HSPGs can bind and sequester BMPs
