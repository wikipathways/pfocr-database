caption: 'Pathogenic mechanisms of radiation-induced oral mucositis (RIOM). Amplification
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines occurs mainly through
  the following three steps: (1) activating the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pro-inflammatory
  pathway, stimulating target gene expression, and producing a large number of inflammatory
  cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and
  IL-6, which activate the ceramide pathway, thereby producing large amounts of sphingomyelinase
  and ceramide synthase and eventually causing more tissue damage and cell apoptosis;
  (2) fibronectin breakdown, which stimulates macrophages leading to activation of
  matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); (3) impaired mitochondria produce more ROS, which
  activates NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome
  pathway. NLRP3 activates caspase-1, which produces IL-1β and leads to apoptosis.'
