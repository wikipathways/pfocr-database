caption: Both images were created using IPA. The left image shows ANXA7, p53, and
  PTEN connections to the network that involves FOXO3A and putative FOXO3A-phosphorylating
  kinases; the phosphorylation involving relationships are highlighted (yellow edges).
  The right image shows a schematic pathway that was created using PI3K/Akt canonical
  pathway as a template and was enriched by putative ANXA7 and SGK1 connections; FOXO3A
  and the FOXO3A-phosphorylating SGK1 and Akt are highlighted in yellow.
