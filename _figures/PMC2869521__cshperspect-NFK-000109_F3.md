caption: Constitutive NF-κB pathway activation in multiple myeloma. (A) Genetic abnormalities
  that activate NF-κB in multiple myeloma. Gray boxes highlight recurrent genetic
  aberrations in multiple myeloma involving NF-κB pathway components. The kinase NIK
  is tethered to the ubiquitin ligases c-IAP1 and/c-IAP2 (c-IAP1/2) by TRAF2 and TRAF3,
  leading to rapid turnover of NIK protein because of c-IAP1/2-catalyzed K46-linked
  polyubiquitination. On recruitment to a subset of TNF receptor-family proteins—notably
  CD40, TACI, and lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTBR)—TRAF2 ubiquitin ligase activity is
  induced, leading to K63-linked polyubiquitination of c-IAP1/2. The K46-linked ubiquitin
  ligase activity of c-IAP1/2 is directed toward TRAF3, leading to its proteasomal
  degradation. NIK is liberated and stabilized in the process. NIK overexpression
  stimulates both the classical and alternative NF-κB pathways. The deubiquitinase
  CYLD negative regulates this signaling pathway by removing K63-linked polyubiquitin
  chains from IKKγ. (B) Model of NF-κB activation during the genesis of multiple myeloma.
  Normal plasma cells receive signals from BAFF and APRIL, two TNF family ligands
  in the bone marrow microenvironment. Their receptors, TACI and BCMA, are highly
  expressed in multiple myeloma and signal to NF-κB through both the classical and
  alternative NF-κB pathways. Initial transformation is often caused by oncogenic
  translocations, but the myeloma cell may still remain dependent on the bone marrow
  microenvironment to receive prosurvival NF-κB signals. Myeloma cells that acquire
  mutations that cause constitutive NF-κB pathway activation are selected because
  they allow the malignant cells to survive and proliferate without being limited
  by the bone marrow microenvironment.
