caption: Therapeutic targeting of the ribotoxic stress response (RSR) during Shiga
  toxicity. Depurinated ribosomes are detected by PKR and Hck complexes to initiate
  the RSR. Signaling cascades involving ZAK and MAP kinases result in the upregulation
  of inflammatory transcripts and cytokine secretion depending on the intoxicated
  cell type. Kinase inhibitors targeting the RSR pathway or inhibitors of secreted
  cytokine activity could modulate Shiga toxicity through reduction of inflammatory
  cytokine-driven components of disease progression.
