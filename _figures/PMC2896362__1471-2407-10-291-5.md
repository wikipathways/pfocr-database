caption: Differentially expressed proteins for SKBR3 cell line were analyzed using
  a manually curated structured network tool (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis). A) Network
  ID 1 (p-value < 10-42) with function associated with cellular development, B) Network
  ID 2 (p-value < 10-27) with function associated with cell cycle. White nodes are
  proteins identified by IPA, grey nodes are proteins identified by IPA and 2-DE,
  blue node is identified by IPA and validated by immunoblotting, and red node is
  identified by IPA and 2-DE, and confirmed by immunoblotting.
