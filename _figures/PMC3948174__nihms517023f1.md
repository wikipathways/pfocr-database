caption: 'Regulation of G protein-mediated signaling by RGS2 in the heart. Inhibitory
  effects of RGS2 on G protein-mediated signaling are indicated in red. Opposing regulation
  of adenylate cyclase by Gs (stimulatory) and Gi/o (inhibitory), and Gq/11-mediated
  activation of phospholipase Cβ are depicted to the left and middle, respectively.
  G protein-coupled receptors are shaded in blue, G proteins in pink, and effector
  enzymes in yellow. Endogenous neurotransmitters and peptide hormones are indicated
  above their respective receptors in black font, while additional experimentally
  used receptor agonists are in gray font. All 2nd messengers and downstream protein
  kinases are depicted in open boxes. Generation of cGMP via soluble or particulate
  guanylate cyclases (sGC and pGC, respectively) is shown to the right. Blue arrows
  indicate upregulation of RGS2 expression (in response to enhanced signaling via
  the adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C β pathways) or enhanced functionality
  (via cGMP-mediated phosphorylation). In contrast to acute stimulation of the Gq/11-PLCβ
  signaling pathway, chronically enhanced Gq/11-mediated signaling leads to RGS2 downregulation
  (green dashed arrow). See text for details on RGS2 as signal integrator between
  the Gs/Gi/o and the Gq/11signaling pathways as well as the non-GPCR cGMP signaling
  pathway. Abbreviations: Ach, acetylcholine; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; Ang
