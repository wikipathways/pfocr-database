caption: IR and IGF family signaling pathway. Upon the binding of the ligand, the
  activated receptor will undergo autophosphorylation and in turn will phosphorylate
  IRS and SHC. Activated IRS will recruit GRB to the phosphorylated form of SHC adaptor
  protein. The SHC-GRB complex will induce RAS and turn on the MAPK/ERK pathway, inducing
  cell proliferation and survival. Phospho-IRS will also stimulate the PI3 kinase
  to phosphorylate AKT thus initiating its downstream effectors such as mTOR, promoting
  translation, proliferation, and cell survival. Generally, activated AKT will have
  an inhibitory effect on TSC2, allowing Rheb-GDP to be converted to its GTP-bound
  state, thereby activating mTOR and its downstream signaling molecules to promote
  cellular translation. Three different potential targeted therapies are underway
  of investigation in ovarian cancer, including IGF-IR antibodies, IGF-IR kinase inhibitors,
  and AMPK activators such as metformin.
