caption: Viruses can co-opt functions that are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) to achieve the four crucial later steps in infection — replication, assembly,
  morphogenesis and egress. a | Genome replication. During this process, the replication
  proteins of numerous viruses rearrange the ER membrane to generate membranous structures
  with different morphologies and terminologies, such as invaginated vesicles (for
  dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV)) and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs;
  for hepatitis C virus (HCV), poliovirus and enterovirus 71 (EV71)). These replication
  sites act to increase the local concentrations of viral and host components that
  are essential for RNA replication, and enable different steps of the replication
  process to be coordinated efficiently. b | Assembly. Virus assembly can be tightly
  coupled to, and coordinated with, genome replication, as exemplified in HCV. To
  initiate the assembly of viral progeny, a lipid droplet recruits viral core proteins
  to its surface and delivers them to the site of assembly. In one model of HCV virion
  assembly, core proteins capture the newly replicated positive-sense RNA ((+)RNA)
  that extrudes from the neighbouring DMV, forming the nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsid
  may then bud into the lumen of the ER, generating a newly assembled enveloped virus
  particle that contains the structural glycoproteins E1 and E2. c | Morphogenesis.
  Morphogenesis of the assembled HCV particle continues in the ER, with the acquisition
  of lipoproteins on its surface to generate the mature ‘lipoviral’ HCV particle that
  is poised to exit the host cell. For rotavirus, ER-dependent morphogenesis is initiated
  when its membrane protein non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) induces calcium release
  from the ER. This triggers a signalling cascade that delivers the structural proteins
  VP4 and VP7, with assistance from NSP4, to the ER membrane assembly site. The VP4–NSP4–VP7
  complex recruits the double-layer particle (DLP) and deforms the membrane to form
  a transient enveloped intermediate in the lumen of the ER. Following the removal
  of the ER-derived lipid bilayer, VP7 correctly assembles on the surface of the mature
  infectious triple-layer particle (TLP), with the simultaneous release of NSP4. The
  morphologically matured virion then exits the host cell through lysis or secretion.
  d | Egress. The final step of infection is egress of the mature virion. Viruses
  that mature in the ER co-opt the ER-dependent secretory pathway to access the extracellular
  milieu. Examples of using this strategy can be found in egress of the mature HCV,
  rotavirus and parvovirus particles. Additionally, the ER could also have specific
  components, such as the KDEL receptor in the case of DENV, that are hijacked to
  promote exit. COPII, coat protein complex II.
