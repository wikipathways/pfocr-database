caption: Schematic diagram of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway.
  TGF-β signaling is initiated by the binding of TGF-β to its receptors, transforming
  growth factor-β receptor I (TGF-β RI) and transforming growth factor-β receptor
  II (TGF-β RII), and receptor tyrosine kinase activation which then phosphorylates
  Smad2/3. Activated Smad2/3 regulates gene expression of Smad4 and other transcription
  factors (TF). Feedback regulation is mediated by Smad6/7, which interferes the binding
  of Smad2/3 to TGF-β receptors and inhibits transcription. Both Smad6 and Smad7 are
  in turn induced by TGF-β and regulated by Smad ubiquitin regulatory factors (Smurfs).
  Synthetic inhibitors inactivate the TGF-β pathway by inhibition of receptor enzymatic
  activity.
