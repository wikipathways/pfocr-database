caption: Schematic overview of PRRs involved in the sensing of viral infections in
  IECs. All TLRs share a common structure and signal through adaptor proteins. The
  elicited signaling pathway depends on the combination of TLRs and PAMPs. TLR2 and
  4 recognize viruses at the cell surface, while TLR3 recognizes double-stranded (ds)RNA
  and TLR7 and 8 recognize single-stranded (ss)RNA, and TLR9 recognizes DNA with Unmethylated
  cytosine–guanine dinucleotide (CpG) motifs in the endosomes. Although it is not
  fully understood why, TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 may occur both in the cell membrane and
  intracellularly []. TLRs may, in addition to apical and endosomal, include basolateral
  and basal cell membrane expression. All TLRs, except TLR3, utilize myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88) as an adapter to recruit the signaling pathways leading to the
  activation of the transcription factors NF-kB, and in some cases interferon regulatory
  factor (IRF) 7, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type
  I IFN. TLR3, on the other hand, utilizes the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein
  inducing interferon β (TRIF) to activate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-kB) and IRF3 and can trigger the induction of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and type I interferon β. The cytosolic receptors retinoic acid-inducible
  gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) detect viral-mediated
  dsRNA or ssRNA structures, respectively. They signal through the adaptor protein
  mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), eventually activating NF-kB or IRF3. NLRs
  are cytosolic PRR sensors that upon the recognition of PAMPs or DAMPs oligomerize
  into large macromolecular scaffolds called inflammasomes, which promote the maturation
  and secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. Illustration created by MDH using
