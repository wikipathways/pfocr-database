caption: Hypothetical model illustrating the molecular basis of insulin-induced metabolic
  stress in patients with poorly controlled T2D in which both blood glucose and FFA
  levels are persistently elevated. Depicted here is a cell in which (A) IR protects
  from nutrient overload and metabolic stress by limiting glucose flux into the cell
  and (B) the IR protection is overridden by a high dose of exogenous insulin therapy,
  which promotes excess glucose uptake and glucolipotoxicity. Excess glucose supply
  to the mitochondria results in reducing equivalent overload of the electron transfer
  chain and enhanced production of ATP and ROS, resulting in oxidative damage. The
  resulting increased ATP/AMP ratio inhibits AMPK, which has the effect of decreasing
  FFA oxidation (limiting nutrient detoxification) favoring fat deposition. Enhanced
  glucose uptake can also result in excessive glycogen deposition and increased activities
  of the toxic polyol, hexosamine, and AGE formation pathways. Glucose that is metabolized
  via the anaplerosis pathway can also increase cytosolic acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) and malonyl-CoA
  (MalCoA). AcCoA and MalCoA are then available for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis,
  increasing the lipid load on the cell. MalCoA also inhibits fatty acyl-CoA (FACoA)
  entry into the mitochondria such that FACoA is more available for synthesis of complex
  lipids, including glycerolipids (phospholipids, diacylglycerols, and triglycerides)
  and ceramides. This can result in endoplasmic reticulum stress and the accumulation
  of lipid droplets (steatosis). Increased ROS production, toxic lipid accumulation,
  and reduced AMPK activity are factors that also activate the inflammasome contributing
  to cardiac injury. The overall effect is nutrient overload and metabolic stress
  causing cell dysfunction or death and cardiac inflammation. CD36, free fatty acid
  transporter; DAG, diacylglycerols; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ETC, electron transport
