caption: Regulation of proliferation and survival pathways by protein kinases activation
  in response to UV radiation. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) family and
  Phosphoinositide 3-Kinases (PI-3K) signaling activation as an outcome of Epidermal
  Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activation and/or increase in intracellular Reactive
  Oxygen Species (ROS) levels resulting from UV radiation. MAPK and PI-3K pathways
  can regulate each other in response to UV radiation; however extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), p38K and c-Jun NH2-Terminal Kinases (JNK) activate specific transcription
  factors, which regulate the expression of genes participating in proliferation or
  cell survival. PI-3K activates AKT, which leads to induction or repression of cell
  survival and apoptosis. UV radiation is also able to activate protein kinases to
  regulate protein translation through ERK pathway activation.
