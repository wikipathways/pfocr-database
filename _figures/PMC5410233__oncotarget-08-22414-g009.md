caption: Salinomycin (SAL) and gefitinib (GEF) acted together to enhance production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
  and lysosomal membrane potential (LMP). The ROS production induced by GEF and SAL
  contributed loss of LMP and MMP. SAL and GEF cooperated to trigger LMP and cytoplasmic
  release of cathepsin B and D. And then, cytoplasmic cathepsin B and D contributed
  to the loss of MMP and caspase-independent cell death. Moreover, cytoplasmic cathepsin
  B and D enhanced cyto-c (cytochrome c) translocation into the cytosol and induced
  subsequently caspase-3 dependent cell apoptosis. Additionally, the two drugs cooperated
  to trigger mitochondrial permeability, which contributed to the loss of LMP.
