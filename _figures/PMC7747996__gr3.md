  catalyzes CO2 and O2 fixation. The product of CO2 fixation is the 3PGA that enters
  in the CBC and can be directed to starch biosynthesis and/or sugars in the cytosol
  (black arrows). In addition, the oxygenation drives the production of 2PGA, which
  is metabolized in the C2 photorespiratory pathway (blue arrows). Recently, three
  new synthetic photorespiratory bypasses have been proposed to improve the carbon
  assimilation and reduce photorespiration losses in C3 plants. See details in pink
  circles: (1) glycolate is diverted into glycerate within the chloroplast, shifting
  the release of CO2 from mitochondria to chloroplasts, and reducing ammonia release
  (dashed light-green arrows) (for details see ); (2) peroxisomal pathway, catalyzed
  by two Escherichia coli enzymes, converts glyoxylate into hydroxypyruvate and CO2
  in a two-step process (brown) (for details see ); (3) lastly, bypass 3 is considered
  a non-real bypass since the glycolate is completely oxidized into CO2 inside chloroplasts
  by both newly introduced and native enzymes (dashed red arrows) (for details see
  , ). In parallel, overexpression of GDC (gray oval) in Arabidopsis increased net
  carbon assimilation. Besides this, RuBisCO activity is also limited by RuBP regeneration,
  which involves two main enzymes, SBPase and FBPA (yellow oval). The combination
  of SBPase and FBPA overexpression results in cumulative positive effects on leaf
  area and biomass accumulation (). Recent studies have shown that BSD2 (red star)
  chaperone is crucial for cyanobacterial RuBisCO assembly into functional enzyme
  in tobacco (). Therefore, all these changes are considered important checkpoint
  targets to optimize and improve the photosynthetic efficiency. 3PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate;
