caption: 'Activation of the coagulation cascade and endogenous anticoagulants. Pathogens
  in the lungs are recognised by pattern recognition receptors that initiate a pro-inflammatory
  response and expression of tissue factor (TF) allowing factor VIIa to come in to
  contact with TF. TF-VIIa activates factor X that binds to TF-VIIa to form a ternary
  complex that converts prothrombin to thromobin (factor IIa). Factor Va binds to
  the ternary complex to form the prothrombinase complex and to platelets and factor
  Xa to form the major prothrombinase complex that generates the large amounts of
  thrombin necessary for fibrin clot formation. Thrombin also increases expression
  of thrombomodulin on endothelial cells and activates proteinase-activated receptor-1
  (PAR1), the major thrombin receptor. Activation of PAR1 by thrombin leads to downstream
  signalling that is pro-inflammatory and leads to disruption of the alveolar barrier
  (brown). Activation of PAR1 by activated protein C (APC) leads to signalling that
  has barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects (blue). TFPI: tissue factor
