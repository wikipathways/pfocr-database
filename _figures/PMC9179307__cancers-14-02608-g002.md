caption: Vitamin C is a multifunctional natural nutrient that exhibits dose-dependent
  effects. Vitamin C (VitC) at the physiological dose (μM) is known to exhibit antioxidant
  properties. However, it functions as a prooxidant at the pharmacological dose (mM)
  achieved by intravenous administration. VitC also enhances a range of intracellular
  enzymatic reactions by serving as a cofactor of monooxygenases (e.g., dopamine β
  hydroxylase) and Fe (II)- and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent dioxygenases (e.g.,
  HIF, TET, JHDMs, P-3-H, and P-4-H). Possible anticancer mechanisms include triggering
  oxidative damage, regulating epigenetics, blunting adaptive responses to hypoxia,
  and synthesizing collagen and neurotransmitters. AFR, ascorbate free radical; DHA,
  dehydroascorbic acid; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; GSH, glutathione; GSSG, glutathione
