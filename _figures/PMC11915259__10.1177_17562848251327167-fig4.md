caption: 'Bidirectional lines of communication between the microbiota, gut, and brain
  primarily involve neural, endocrine, and immune pathways. When gut microbes are
  out of balance, a wide range of microbial products including metabolites, neurotransmitters,
  and cytokines, including 5-HT, SCAF, and GABA, enter the brain through the bloodstream.
  The unidirectional and bidirectional movement of metabolites in the gut and brain
  or distal organs in direct press constitutes a co-metabolic interaction.Source:
