caption: 'Possible effects of glyphosate treatment of glyphosate-senstive plants on
  shikimic acid pathway metabolites considered to be important in defense. Products
  of the shikimic acid pathway involved in plant defenses are outlined by boxes. Metabolites
  and metabolic groups in red have been demonstrated or are hypothesized to be reduced
  in GS plants after glyphosate treatment. Of these, only isoflavonoid phytoalexins
  from bean and soybean and lignin deposition in bean have been examined for effects
  of glyphosate (and only in GS plants). Those in black are expected to increase after
  glyphosate treatment. Protocatechuic acid has been demonstrated to increase in GS
  plant tissue after glyphosate treatment. **EPSPS: 5-enolpyruvylshikimic acid-3-phosphate
  synthase, the site of glyphosate action.'
