caption: Signaling pathways for epi activation of secretion. The β1- and β2-adrenergic
  receptors (β1-AdrR, β2-AdrR) and Y2-neuropeptide receptor (Y2-NpR) are shown interacting
  with transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmAC) and sAC. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) limit
  buildup of the cAMP, leading to activation of secretion. cAMP from other ACs in
  the cell also is shown leading to PKA activation as well as to Epac activation of
  Rap1 and Rap2. Activated Rap2 may enter the signaling pathway for K+ secretion,
  or possibly that for Cl− secretion. cAMP production via the sAC-dependent pathway
  would be maximally HCO3− sensitive, since the physiological intracellular HCO3−
  concentration is near the EC50 for sAC (, ). Only with severe hypercapnia would
  CO2 rise sufficiently to stimulate a large increase in cAMP production via the tmAC
  pathway ().
