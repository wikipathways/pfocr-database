caption: Outline of the microRNA biogenesis pathway in humans, and how plants utilise
  RdRPs to amplify these. The miRNA gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and typically
  capped and polyadenylated. This primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) contains the hairpin structure
  that is recognised and cleaved by Drosha, as part of the Microprocessor complex.
  The stem loop is then further trimmed by Dicer forming the pre-miRNA. In the canonical
  miRNA pathway, a single strand of the small RNA duplex is loaded into an Argonaute
  protein (Ago), which leads to repression of target transcripts. In plants, a dsRNA
  precursor is cleaved by Dicer into small dsRNA (green box). There exist multiple
  amplification pathways; broadly, an RdRP can synthesise a complementary strand by
  elongating a small RNA bound to its target RNA. Plant Dicer proteins can then cleave
  this newly generated dsRNA. to produce many secondary siRNAs that can repress target
  transcripts via Ago, or begin another cycle of small RNA amplification
