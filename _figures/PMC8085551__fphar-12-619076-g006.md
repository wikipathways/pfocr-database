caption: Overview of metabolic pathway analysis. After treatment with AEGE, the concentration
  or expression of metabolites and genes (blue background and italic) were changed
  (“↑” means upregulated; “↓” means downregulated; purple arrow represents the ratio
  of IR to sham groups; red arrow represents the ratio of AEGE to IR groups). Dashed
  arrow indicates multiple steps in the pathway.
