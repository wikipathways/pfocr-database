caption: Hepatic lipid metabolic pathway during pregnancy. Pregnancy leads to insulin
  resistance and downregulation of insulin receptor (INSR), and increases in transport
  of fatty acids (FAs) from plasma and adipose tissue, triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol
  that are transported by high-density lipoproteins (HDL) particles to the liver.
  Carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) is involved in triglyceride
  synthesis from FAs and glycerol, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
  alpha (PPARα) and PPARγ regulate the β-oxidation of FA to release ATP through tricarboxylic
  acid cycle. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and angiopoietin like
  4 (ANGPTL4) modulate VLDL assembly by apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and TG, which result
  in an increase in VLDL release from the liver. In addition, cytochrome P450 family
  7 subfamily A member 1 (CYP7A1) converts cholesterol to bile acids that are released
  from the liver to improve the digestion and absorption of lipids. Moreover, some
  free FAs are oxidized as ketone bodies that are released from the liver
