caption: Schematic representation of post-induction repression of IFN-β expression
  by YY1 in TLR3 signaling pathway. TLR3 is engaged by a dsRNA ligand (e.g. poly(I:C))
  promoting activation of the TRIF/TBK1/inducible IκB kinase pathway leading to the
  binding of IRF3 and IRF7 to the PRD I/III domain of the IFN-β promoter. This results
  in increased transcriptional activation of the IFN-β gene. TLR3 is a poor activator
  of the classical NF-κB pathway and especially p65 but can strongly stimulate the
  nuclear translocation of the Rel subunits RelB and c-Rel followed by induction of
  YY1. The latter translocates to the nucleus in response to TLR3 signaling, where
  it displaces IRF7 from the IFN-β promoter resulting in post-induction repression
  of IFN-β expression.
