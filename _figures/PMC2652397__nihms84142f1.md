caption: 'Keap1 is a key regulator of the Nrf2 signaling pathway and serves as a molecular
  switch to turn on and off the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response. (i) The switch
  is in off position: under basal conditions, Keap1, functioning as an E3 ubiquitin
  ligase, constantly targets Nrf2 for ubiquitination and degradation. As a consequence,
  there are minimal levels of Nrf2. (ii) The switch is turned on: oxidative stress
  or chemopreventive compounds inhibit activity of the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ubiquitin
  ligase, resulting in increased levels of Nrf2 and activation of its downstream target
  genes. (iii) The switch is turned off again: Upon recovery of cellular redox homeostasis,
  Keap1 travels into the nucleus to remove Nrf2 from the ARE. The Nrf2-Keap1 complex
  is then transported out of the nucleus by the NES in Keap1. In the cytosol, the
  Nrf2-Keap1 complex associates with the Cul3-Rbx1 core ubiquitin machinery, leading
  to degradation of Nrf2. For clarity, the constitutive cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling
  of Nrf2, Keap1, and the complex is omitted.'
