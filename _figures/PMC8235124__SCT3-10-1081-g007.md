caption: Proposed model of GlcSph‐mediated lysosomal dysfunction in nGD neurons. Mutant
  GCase causes the accumulation of GlcCer, which is converted to GlcSph via an alternate
  metabolic pathway by acid ceramidase (ASAH1) in the lysosome. The excess GlcSph,
  which is water‐soluble, exits the lysosome into the cytoplasm and activates the
  mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) leading to lysosomal depletion and autophagy block. Inhibitors
  of GlcCer synthase, ASAH1, and mTOR are able to suppress mTOR hyperactivation and
  rescue the ALP in mutant neurons. ALP, autophagy lysosomal pathway; GCase, β‐glucocerebrosidase;
