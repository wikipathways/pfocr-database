caption: Mechanism of action of ALK inhibitors. ALK activates various signaling pathways
  involved in cell proliferation and survival, including the PI3K pathway, the RAS/MEK
  pathway and the JAK/STAT pathway. ALK inhibitors have similar mechanisms of action
  by binding to the ATP-binding site and blocking activation of ALK. Crizotinib was
  the first ALK inhibitor approved by the FDA but, unfortunately, resistance to Crizotinib
  commonly occurs due to mutations the ALK gene. Therefore, Ceritinib, Alectinib,
  Brigatinib and Lorlatinib were developed, and can be used for patients who are not
  responding to Crizotinib
