caption: AAE influence on HuH7 metabolome. Schematic cartoon depicting some of the
  metabolic reactions positively (green boxes) or negatively (red boxes) affected
  by AAE in HuH7 cells. Red and green arrowheads indicate reactions halted or stimulated
  by AAE, respectively. Orange and green dots indicate metabolites whose intracellular
  levels resulted to be decreased or increased by treatment with AAE, respectively.

  lipids; plasma membrane lipids; GSH, reduced glutathione; Leu, leucine; Trp, tryptophan;
  Thr, threonine; Cys, cysteine; Gly, glycine; Lys, lysine; His, histidine; Pro, proline;
