caption: '(A) Complexity of the molecular pathways governing the function of the cyclin-dependent
  kinases (CDKs) through the cell-division cycle. (B) Key mechanisms of CDK7 and CDK7
  inhibition in ER+ breast cancer cells. The cell-division cycle starts depending
  on the tangled interplay of CDK4 and CDK6 complexes, which involve D-type cyclins
  and the release of E2F transcription factors by pRb phosphorylation. They regulate
  the transcription of genes that play a key role in S-phase advance. S-phase progression
  is then regulated by the cooperation of CDK2-cyclin E/cyclin A complexes. CDK function
  arrangement is promoted by CDKis, particularly in addressing CDK4/6 or CDK2. Progression
  from the G2 phase to the M phase is governed by the collaborating A and B cyclins
  along with CDK1. CDK: cyclin-dependent kinase; p: protein; Rb: retinoblastoma; P:
  phosphorylation; CDK7i: cyclin-dependent kinase 7 inhibition; E2F: early region
  2 binding factor; TP53: tumor protein p53. Also, see the text'
