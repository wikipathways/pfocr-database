caption: Proposed model for the targeting of NRAS-mutant melanoma by ERβ ligands.
  In NRAS-mutant melanoma cells (BLM), ERβ agonists trigger genomic effects at the
  nuclear level by modulating the expression of cell cycle-related proteins and by
  reversing the global hypomethylation status of these cells. Moreover, it is hypothesized
  that activated ERβ might also exert non-genomic effects, by interfering with the
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, as previously described for different cancer cell lines
  expressing this receptor.
