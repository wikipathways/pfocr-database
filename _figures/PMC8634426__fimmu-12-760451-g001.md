caption: 'Carcinogenic induction caused by CDT. Binding of CdtA and CdtC to lipid
  rafts facilitates the entry of CdtB and CdtC. In the cytoplasm, CdtB dissociates
  with CdtC and translocates into the nucleus alone. As a DNase, CdtB damages the
  host DNA and immediately triggers the activation of ATM, which is involved in the
  formation of monomer and biochemical modifications including phosphorylation and
  acetylation. (1) Activated ATM targets H2AX, phosphorylated on Ser139 (γH2AX), and
  initiates the cascade of DDR signaling pathway. (2) To allow for DNA repair, with
  the co-signaling of MRN complex, ATM also activates CHK2 and p53 to stall cell cycle
  progression. (3) When the DNA damage is too devastating, the cells are prone to
  undergo apoptosis. However, the cells with misrepaired DNA can continue cycling,
  thereby accumulating mutations to cause genomic instability. Activated ATM also
  causes dephosphorylation of Net1, which is activated and translocated to the cytoplasm.
  Net1 switches the inactive GDP-bound form to the active GTP-bound form of RhoA.
  The downstream region of RhoA mainly diverges into two pathways: (4) one activates
  p38 MAPK and further promotes cell survival and proliferation, and (5) the other
  activates ROCK and induces the formation of actin stress fibers. In addition, stress
  fibers are often anchored on the focal adhesion complex constituting integrin, of
  which the inside-out activation signal can be transduced by ATM. Together, these
  cellular responses triggered by CDT are related to the acquisition of cancer hallmarks.'
