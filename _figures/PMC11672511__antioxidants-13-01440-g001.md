caption: 'Activation of the cGAS–STING signaling pathway by cytosolic mtDNA. Mitochondrial
  oxidative stress favors the release of mtDNA. In the cytosol, mtDNA is recognized
  by cGAS, which then assembles into dimers and catalyzes the synthesis of cGAMP from
  ATP and GTP. cGAMP initiates the signaling cascade by binding to the ER-associated
  adaptor protein STING, which translocates to the Golgi apparatus, where it recruits
  and activates TBK1. TBK1 phosphorylates IRF3, which, in turn, targets the nucleus
  and transcribes interferon-stimulated genes. TBK1 can also relieve the inhibition
  of NF-κB, triggering the transcription of gene-encoding proinflammatory cytokines
  [72]. Abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; cGAMP, cyclic 2′,3′-cyclic guanosine
