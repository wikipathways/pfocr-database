caption: Schematic of mortality deconvolution and insulin/IGF‐1 signaling (IIS) pathway
  in Caenorhabditis elegans. (a) Representative Nomarski images of P and p corpses
  of worms fed RFP‐expressing E. coli. P corpses are characterized by the widespread
  RFP signal in the pharyngeal tissue, while p corpses contain either limited RFP
  foci or only signal in the grinder lumen. Scale bar 40 μm. (b) Schematic of mortality
  deconvolution for a typical wild‐type C. elegans lifespan assay. The black survival
  curve represents survival of all animals in the population, red and blue curves
  represent that of the P and p death subpopulation, respectively. (c) Simplified
  schematic of the IIS pathway in C. elegans. Under optimal conditions, insulin‐like
  peptides activate the DAF‐2 insulin/IGF‐1 receptor and its downstream kinase AGE‐1/PI3 K,
  which converts PIP2 to PIP3, an activity antagonized by DAF‐18/PTEN. Through a cascade
  of phosphorylation increased PIP3 level leads to phosphorylation and cytosolic sequestration
  of DAF‐16/FOXO. When IIS is inhibited, DAF‐16 enters the nucleus where it alters
  expression of genes involved in dauer formation, longevity, and innate immunity
