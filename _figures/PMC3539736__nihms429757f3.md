caption: Antigen encounter triggers clonal expansion of naïve CD4 T cells that is
  mainly dependent on p110δ. Depending on the immune microenvironment (cytokines,
  etc.), primed CD4 T cells differentiate into different CD4 T cell subsets (Th1,
  Th2, Th17, Tfh, and iTregs). TORC2-dependent AKT activation promotes Th1 differentiation
  through TORC1 and NFκB, and TORC2-dependent PKCθ activation promotes Th2 differentiation.
  PDK-1 also triggers NFκB activation through a complex with PKCθ. AKT increases Th17
  differentiation through TORC1 and HIF-1α activation. Already established CCR6+ human
  memory Th17 cell function (IL-17/IL-22 secretion) also depends on PI3K/AKT activity
  via modulation of FOXO and its target genes including KLF2. ICOS stimulation triggers
  Tfh differentiation through a p110δ-dependent pathway, with a speculative role for
  p110α binding to ICOS. The total PI3K output acts as a rheostat (gray circle) with
  decreased PI3K/AKT activity favoring iTreg induction. Isoforms other than p110δ
  including p110α probably suppress iTreg induction in this context. PI3K/AKT blockade
  results in the induction of FOXO-mediated FoxP3 expression and low TORC1 activity
  leads to decreased metabolic activity via S6K and HIF-1α. Established FoxP3+ Tregs
  also depend on p110δ activity for proper suppressive function such as IL-10 secretion.
  Due to space constraints, the nucleus is not depicted where all of the genes are
  regulated.
