caption: 'Schematic illustration of the mechanisms that lead to cell survival in MEN2A
  associated RET mutations that activate PI3K/Akt signaling: apoptosis suppression
  and enhanced cell cycle progression. RET mutations cause sustained signal transduction
  and up-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which then stimulates the expression
  of antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2. In addition, production of p21CIP1/WAF1
  and p27KIP1, two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, is decreased, while cyclin
  D1 generation increases. These changes in p21CIP1/WAF1, p27KIP1, and cyclin D1 enhance
  cell cycle progression, likely at the S-phase. Adapted from Drosten M, Hilken G,
  Böckmann M, Rödicker F, Mise N, Cranston AN, et al. Role of MEN2A-derived RET in
