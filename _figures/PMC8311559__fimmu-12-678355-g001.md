caption: Th17/Treg balance regulated by the cytokine microenvironment and cellular
  metabolic signaling pathways. Naïve CD4+ T cells may differentiate into T helper
  cells (proinflammatory Th17 or anti-inflammatory Treg cells) according to specific
  cytokine profiles. Th17 cell differentiation can be induced by IL-6, IL-21, IL-23,
  IL-1β, and TGF-β. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23 activate
  STAT3 to induce RORC gene expression and stimulate T cells towards Th17 cell differentiation.
  RORγt promotes the expression of specific genes (e.g., CCR6, CD161, IL17a, IL17f,
  and IL23r) to maintain the phenotype and function of Th17 cells. mTOR is activated
  by PI3K/Akt signaling after T cell receptor activation and co-stimulation along
  with naïve T cells. mTOR stimulates HIF-1 to support glycolysis and is indispensable
  for driving the Th17 phenotype. Additionally, the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway
  has been shown to regulate Th17 cell differentiation and function. The reverse is
  true for Treg cell differentiation. IL-2 and TGF-β promote Treg cell differentiation
  during the development of Treg cells, for which Foxp3 is indispensable. AMPK inhibits
  mTOR activity and promotes Foxp3-induced OXPHOS and FAO, which allow Treg cells
  to produce ATP and to generate energy. TGF-β is a developmental factor shared by
  Th17 and Treg cells and its function is dependent on the coexisting cytokines. Th17,
