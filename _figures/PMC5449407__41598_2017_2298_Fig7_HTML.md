caption: SAR signaling in maize inflorescence based on DEG analysis. (A) Maize female
  inflorescence cell showing the predicted location of DEGs between SAR+ and SAR−
  plants. Fold change values of each gene are in Supplementary Table . (B) Hormone
  signaling crosstalk in systemic female inflorescence inoculated with C. graminicola.
  SA-dependent signaling pathway involves changes in redox environment, leading NON-EXPRESSOR
  OF PR1 (NPR1) to move from cytoplasm to the nucleus. NPR1 can interact with ZmbZIP
  TF, which induces transcription of PR proteins. Other positive regulators in SA
  signaling pathway are ZmWRKY, ZmNAC, ZmHSF and ZmHMG responsible for the priming
  effect induction. Chromatin modifications seem to be happening due to a decrease
  in gene expression of ZmHMG TF related to disassembly of nucleosome and by decrease
  in gene expression of histones. Signaling pathways dependent on auxin and ABA are
  not involved in SAR activation in inflorescences. JA/ET-dependent signaling pathways
  appear to contribute to systemic defense against C. graminicola.
