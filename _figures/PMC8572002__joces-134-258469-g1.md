caption: Glycolysis and related pathways. In the upstream glycolysis reactions, glucose
  is phosphorylated, isomerized to F6P, and phosphorylated once more, generating F16BP
  through the action of hexokinase (HXK), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) and phosphofructokinase
  (PFK), respectively. The reverse reaction of PFK is catalyzed by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
  (FBPase; not depicted). Next, F16BP is cleaved by aldolase (ALDO) into dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP). DHAP can interconvert with
  GAP through triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) activity, thus generating two equivalents
  of GAP per molecule of glucose. In an NAD+-dependent reaction, glyceraldehyde phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GAPDH) converts GAP into 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (13BPG). Phosphoglycerate
  kinase (PGK) generates ATP when converting 13BPG into 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG),
  which is then converted into 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) by phosphoglycerate mutase.
  Enolase (ENO) converts 2PG into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the substrate of the
  final glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase (PYK) which generates ATP and pyruvate.
  The reverse of this reaction is catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK;
  not depicted). At multiple steps, metabolites can enter other pathways beginning
  with glucose phosphate, which can be directed into glycogen biosynthesis or the
  pentose phosphate pathway by phosphoglucomutase (PGM) or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PDH), respectively. Downstream, 3PG can be directed into serine biogenesis. Pyruvate
  from glycolysis is either converted into ethanol (yeast) or lactic acid (metazoans)
  by fermentation in the cytoplasm or enters the TCA cycle in the mitochondria generating
  additional ATP. Glycolysis enzymes are indicated in green ovals and enzymes of related
  pathways appear in blue ovals.
