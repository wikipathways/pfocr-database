caption: 'The clock and atherogenesis. Atherosclerosis is triggered by small dense
  low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and ApoC-III-rich remnant particles that accumulate
  in regions where the blow flow is disturbed. Low shear stress usually induces a
  mechanic stress, promoting endothelial dysfunction characterized by an increase
  in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, secretion of cytokines, including monocyte
  chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), production of adhesion molecules, including vascular
  cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1),
  and increased permeability to LDL and immune cells. Immune cells, such as neutrophils,
  monocyte-derived macrophages, T cells, etc., are then recruited to the subendothelial
  space. Infiltrated LDL are oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by
  endothelial cells (ECs) and macrophages. Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) are preferentially
  taken up by macrophages through the scavenger receptor CD36 for cholesterol recycling
  through the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). In this pathway, ATP-binding cassette
  ABCA1 and ABCG1 mediate the efflux of cholesterol from the macrophage to ApoA1 and
  preβ-high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Cholesterol is transported back to the liver
  by HDL, where it is recycled in other lipoproteins or used as substrate in the biliary
  acid biosynthetic pathway. When RCT is insufficient and macrophages overwhelmed
  by massive cholesterol uptake, macrophages eventually become foam cells, where the
  accumulation of lipids leads to necrosis and apoptosis, thus forming the necrotic
  core. In addition to cholesterol metabolism, macrophages also produce cytokines,
  such as NLRP3 inflammasome-processed IL-18 and IL-1β interleukins, which, together
  with IL-12, activate the T cell-dependent production of interferon (IFN) γ, among
  others. IFNγ stimulates the proliferation and the migration of smooth muscle cells
  (SMC) toward the necrotic core in order to stabilize it by secreting fibers, including
  collagen, thus forming the fibrous cap. Each process or molecule that is regulated
  by one or several clock components is represented by a clock. Green arrow: induction.'
