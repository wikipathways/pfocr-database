caption: Estrogen synthesis begins with conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone
  in mitochondria. Through a series of steps, pregnenolone is converted into androstenedione,
  which is converted into testosterone and estrone (E1). Testosterone is then converted
  into 17β-estradiol (E2) through the action of aromatase (CYP19A). As also shown,
  CYP19A can be inhibited by various aromatase inhibitors for research purposes and
  for therapies. Chemical structures were generated from the ChemSpider webpage (http://www.chemspider.com).
