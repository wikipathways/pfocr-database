caption: 'The SP pathway for Ae. aegypti was reconstructed for the first time in this
  study. This SP metabolic pathway (modified from Hannun et al., 2008 []) is shown
  overlaid with box plots with SPs that exhibited significantly altered levels during
  infection. Features that were detected but unchanged in abundance upon DENV infection
  are listed in the grey boxes. The abundance of metabolites detected in DENV-infected
  samples is shown in red and uninfected samples in black. Individual sample pools
  are represented by circles and squares and technical replicates are dots with the
  same symbol. Asterisks (*) indicates significantly different levels of abundance
  between DENV-infected and uninfected samples (|log2 fold change| ≥ 1, p < 0.05).
  The enzymes predicted to catalyze the reactions in the SP pathway and their VectorBase
  accession numbers (AAELXXXXXX) according to AaegEL5 assembly and as annotated in
  the KEGG pathway are given in blue text. Where enzymes are not given it indicates
  an absence of annotation for Ae. aegypti of names via the KEGG database and VectorBase.
