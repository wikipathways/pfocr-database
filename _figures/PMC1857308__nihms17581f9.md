caption: 'PMP22 is a hydrophobic tetraspan proteasome substrate. Proteasome inhibition
  (a) in SCs results in the formation of small aggregates containing PMP22 and ubiquitin
  (Ub) (b). Such aggregates are transported along the microtubules to the centrosome,
  forming a central inclusion termed aggresome (c). Aggresomes sequester mTOR, and
  associate with autophagosomes and autolysosomes (d). The activation of the autophagic
  pathway (e) upon proteasome inhibition and aggresome formation is a protective response
  of the cell to prevent the accumulation of proteasome substrates. Two mechanisms
  account for this effect: the clearance of the aggresome (e’) and the removal of
  small aggregates (e’’), thus hindering the formation of the final inclusion. Moreover,
  aggregates recruit heat shock proteins (HSPs) that likely add to this protective
  response (f).'
