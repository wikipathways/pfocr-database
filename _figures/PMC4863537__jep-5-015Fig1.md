caption: 'Imatinib seems to work in systemic sclerosis patients through the inhibition
  of the TGF-β and PDGF signaling pathway via c-Abl and directly by blocking PDGFR,
  which results in a decrease of gene transcription and consequently in a decrease
  in collagen production.Abbreviations: c-Abl, c-Abelson; ECM, extracellular matrix
  proteins; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor
  receptor; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; TGF-βR, transforming growth factor-β
  receptor.'
