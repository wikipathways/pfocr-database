  A, Evaluation of expressed repertoire of GALNTs in HEK293 cells assessed by RNAseq
  analysis (top) and enzyme protein expression by ICC with mAbs (below). B, Depiction
  of the biosynthetic pathway of core1 O-glycosylation and the genes targeted for
  generation of isogenic HEK293SC and HEK293WT with KO of GALNT1, T2, T3, T7, T10,
  or T11. C, Depiction of the quantitative glycoproteomics workflow using dimethyl
  labeling. Trypsin digests from total cell lysates of paired isogenic HEK293SC and
  HEK293SCΔT were labeled with “light” (L) and “medium” (M) isotopes, respectively,
  mixed and GalNAc-glycopeptides enriched on a long VVA column, and Labeled glycopeptides
  were analyzed by nLC-MS/MS.
