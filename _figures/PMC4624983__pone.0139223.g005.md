caption: These changes lead to compromised health in Acropora millepora (reduction
  in symbiont cells, decreased photosynthesis and respiration and reduced calcification).
  The schematic depicts an endodermal cell which contains the Symbiodinium cell. Cellular
  events depicted here, especially acid base regulation at the cell membrane are also
  likely to occur in other cell types which do not contain symbiont cells. Exposure
  to increased temperature and seawater carbonate chemistry leads to changes in acid
  base regulation and ion transport at the cell membrane both in coral host and in
  the symbiont cell. Despite regulatory changes at the cell membrane cellular homeostasis
  may not be reached and acidosis may occur. The result may be an increase in reactive
  oxygen species due to a disruption (*) in the symbiont cell (S) and /or in the coral
  host mitochondrion (M), which may also produce reactive nitrogen species. In addition
  DNA damage may increase and not equal repair mechanisms in the cell nucleus (N)
  and / or M and S, which can lead to cell cycle arrest and /or cell death. Oxidative
  stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, due to mis-folded protein accumulation
  and increased ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, may also lead to cell cycle arrest
  and eventually cell death, in addition to affecting cell calcium homeostasis/signaling,
  which in turn may lead to modifications in the extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal
  interactions and cell signaling. Oxidative stress can also affect immunity and /or
  cell death through the NF-κB pathway. In addition to the disruption in both S and
  M leading to suppression of metabolism, the coral circadian clock can also be influenced
  by oxidative stress and/or change in cell metabolism and in turn affect coral host
  metabolic pathways, which in this case is metabolic depression. Black arrows indicate
  up regulation and white arrows indicate down regulation.
