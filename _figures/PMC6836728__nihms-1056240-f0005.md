caption: Activated cell-surface NPRA is internalized and sorted at the early endosome.
  The fate of the receptor, with the recycling endosome, has important consequences
  for biological responses, although the degradative pathway is via multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs)/lysosome. Typical pathways to the nucleus and mitochondria have been
  proposed to favor survival, but the transport mechanisms have not yet been established.
  Conversely, ligand-activated ANP-NPRA complexes recycle back on plasma membranes
  for re-endocytosis.
