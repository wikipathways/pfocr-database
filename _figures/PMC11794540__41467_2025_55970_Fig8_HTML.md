caption: Endothelial AGGF1 deficiency ameliorates pathological angiogenesis in an
  OIR model. Mechanistically, AGGF1 expression in HRMECs is regulated by retinal hypoxia
  caused by pathological changes. Our study also suggests an action model through
  which AGGF1 promotes angiogenesis by activating the cell cycle via the AGGF1/TNFSF12/FN14
  signalling pathway. Thus, we speculate that targeting the AGGF1/TNFSF12/FN14 signalling
  pathway could provide a therapy for the treatment of ischaemic retinopathy
