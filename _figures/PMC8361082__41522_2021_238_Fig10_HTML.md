caption: High environmental levels of CO2 drive biofilm formation via the Ras1-Cyr1-PKA
  pathway in the same way as previously shown for hyphal morphogenesis in planktonic
  cells. This is accompanied by an increase in iron-scavenging capability by biofilm-associated
  cells. Our data are consistent with a CO2-mediated activation of PKA via Cyr1 resulting
  in increased abundance and activity of Sef1 in an Ssn3-dependent manner (this process
  may also involve the inhibition of Sfu1). Subsequent increased expression of iron
  uptake genes thus enables more effective scavenging of environmental iron.
