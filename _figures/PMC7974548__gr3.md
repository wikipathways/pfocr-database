caption: Overview of mechanisms of cardiotoxicityAbnormalities in action potential
  duration or conduction velocity are associated with a direct block of ionic currents
  or inhibition of their trafficking from nucleus to cell membrane. Multiple pathways
  can trigger apoptosis, including VEGFR or EGFR inhibition (cardiomyocyte survival),
  PDGF inhibition (compensatory stress response), DR-induced TNF signaling activation,
  mitochondrial damage, or elevated ROS levels. α-Adr, VEGFR signaling, or eNOS inhibition
  affects calcium cycling. AMPK signaling inhibition affects both the mitochondrial
  fusion-fission cycle and the production of ATP. Serotonin-induced activation of
  the TGF-β pathway is primarily linked to cardiac fibrosis induction. IKr, rapid
  delayed rectifier current; INa, inward sodium current; INaL, late inward sodium
  current; ICaL, L-type calcium current; α-Adr, alpha-adrenergic receptor; VEGFR,
  vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
  DRs, death receptors; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; 5-HT2β, 5-hydroxytryptamine
  receptor (serotonin receptor 2B); TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TGF-β, transforming
  growth factor beta; ROS, reactive oxygen species; CaMKII, calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate.
