caption: Pictured above is an 80S pathway that has been supported by studies examining
  the requirements for the formation of different intermediates of the pathway and
  some kinetic analyses. Limitations on the accuracy of this pathway are discussed
  in the text. A key feature to note is that steps 7 and 8 are the primary sites of
  global regulation of protein synthesis. In theory, regulation at step 7 should reduce
  expression of all mRNAs equally while regulation at step 8 should drive mRNA competition
  such that less efficient mRNAs are affected much more than highly competitive mRNAs.
