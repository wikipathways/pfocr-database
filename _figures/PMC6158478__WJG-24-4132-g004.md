caption: 'Autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid signaling axis regulates adipose tissue
  development and glucose homeostasis in obesity. In adipose tissue, especially in
  mature adipocytes, the elevated expression of AXT leads to production of LPA and
  then induced proliferation of preadipocytes via LPA1 through Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.
  On the other hand, LPA inhibits differentiation of white and brown preadipocytes,
  which is mediated by LPA1via the Rho-ROCK pathway. Short-term insulin treatment
  increases ATX secretion in adipocytes via PI3K/Akt-mTOR pathway, whereas long-term
  insulin treatment reduces ATX activity. LPA produced by ATX in obesity has a tonic
  inhibitory effect on glucose homeostasis through inhibition of insulin secretion
  in isolated pancreas islets, increase of glucose transport in myocyte and adipocytes
  via GLUT4 translocation in a PI3K dependent manner, and elevation of glycogenolysis
  in hepatocytes. ROCK: Rho-associated kinase; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;
  MEK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase;
  Akt: Protein kinase B; mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin; GLUT4: Glucose transporter
  type 4.'
