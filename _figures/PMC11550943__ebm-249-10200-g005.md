caption: 'Mechanisms responsible for glutamine and fructose metabolism to stimulate
  the growth of both normal and malignant tissues in humans and animals. Glutamine
  is degraded via multiple pathways to generate glutamate, aspartate, alanine, ornithine,
  citrulline, arginine, glucosamine, and CO2, purines, and pyrimidines. Ornithine
  and arginine are substrates for the synthesis of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine,
  and spermine), whereas nitric oxide (NO) is formed from arginine oxidation. Glutamate
  is required for the production of glutathione as the most abundant low-molecular-weight
  antioxidant. Amino sugars (which deriving the carbohydrate moiety from fructose-6-phosphate,
  a product of fructose) are required for the generation of glycoproteins as essential
  components of membranes, cytoplasm, and the extracellular matrix. Purine and pyrimidine
  nucleotides are precursors of DNAs and RNAs that are necessary for protein synthesis.
  Furthermore, both glutamine and fructose activate the mTOR cell signaling pathway
  to stimulate protein synthesis and inhibit protein degradation, leading to protein
  accretion in cells. NO (a major vasodilator to promote blood flow and nutrient supply),
  polyamines, protein accretion, and redox balance are crucial for angiogenesis and
  the growth of both normal and malignant tissues in humans and animals. Abbreviations:
  F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; GlcN-6-P, N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate; mTOR, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin. The enzymes that catalyze the indicated reactions are: (1)
  phosphate-activated glutaminase; (2) glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase;
  (3) glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase, phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase,
  UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase, and UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase; (4) a series of enzymes
  for purine and pyrimidine syntheses; (5) glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase; (6)
  glutamate-pyruvate transaminase; (7) pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase and ornithine
  aminotransferase; (8) ornithine carbamoyltransferase; (9) ornithine decarboxylase;

  (12) arginine decarboxylase; (13) agmatinase; (14) spermidine synthase; (15) spermine

  glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and thioltransferase); (19) a
  series of enzymes for incorporation of amino sugars into proteins; (20) aldose reductase
  and sorbitol dehydrogenase; (21) fructokinase and hexokinase; and (22) a series
