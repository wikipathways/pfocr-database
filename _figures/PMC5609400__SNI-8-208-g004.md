caption: Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a major transcriptional regulator
  whose levels increase in hypoxia, leading to flipping the “angiogenic switch” on.
  (Left) Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)
  enzymes and the VHL-mediated ubiquitin proteasome pathway rapidly degrades HIF-1α,
  maintaining low levels of intracellular HIF-1α. (Right) Under hypoxic conditions,
  the PHD enzymes, which require oxygen as a substrate, are unable to hydroxylate
  HIF-1α's proline residue thus leading to escape from the degradation pathway and
  increased levels intracellular HIF-1α. Accumulation of HIF-1α leads to formation
  of a heterodimer with HIF-1β before translocating to the nucleus to serve as a potent
  activator of pro-angiogenic gene expression
