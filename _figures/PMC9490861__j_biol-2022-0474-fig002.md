caption: 'Mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Description: Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway is important for osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. In the presence of
  LPS, histone acetyltransferase GCN5 can inhibit this pathway through the acetylation
  regulation of DDK1. TAZ, which is necessary for LPS-induced osteogenesis, is a downstream
  component of this signal pathway. Interference with it by ShRNA or under the influence
  of phospholipase notum can inhibit Wnt/β-catenin pathway-mediated osteogenic differentiation
  of PDLSCs, and LiCl could reverse the effect of Notum).'
