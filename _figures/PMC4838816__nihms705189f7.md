caption: Sfrp2 binds and inhibits Wnt6 signaling through the canonical pathway leading
  to cell cycle arrest. This inhibition of canonical pathway activates JNK and non–canonical/PCP
  downstream pathways which in turn induce expression of cardiac transcription factors
  priming CPC for differentiation. Sfrp2 binding to Wnt6 could further facilitate
  binding and activation of non-canonical Wnt signaling (grey font and arrows).
