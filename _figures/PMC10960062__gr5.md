caption: Construction of activating and inhibiting condensed networks in ob/ob mice
  at ad libitum feeding(A) Activating condensed network containing activating regulations,
  differentially expressed or phosphorylated molecules connecting with activating
  regulations, and activated metabolic pathways in ob/ob mice.(B) Inhibiting condensed
  network containing inhibiting regulations, differentially expressed or phosphorylated
  molecules connecting with inhibiting regulations, and inhibited metabolic pathways
  in ob/ob mice. Metabolic pathways were shown in white ovals. Dashed boxes enclose
  metabolic pathways belonging to lipid, nucleotide, amino acid, and carbohydrate
  metabolism. The size of node and width of edge indicate the number of differentially
  expressed or phosphorylated molecules and differential regulations. Red, increased
  molecules or activating regulations in ob/ob mice; blue, decreased molecules or
  inhibiting regulations in ob/ob mice; magenta, the DPPs contain both increased and
  decreased phosphorylation sites in ob/ob mice
