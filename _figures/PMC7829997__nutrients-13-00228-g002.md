caption: 'Dysregulation of fecal tryptophan metabolic pathway in AD patients. (a–c)
  Comparison of detected tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway, serotonin
  pathway, and indole derivatives among AD, aMCI, and HC groups. (d) There are three
  major tryptophan metabolism pathways: ① Kynurenine pathway mainly occurs in the
  liver or extrahepatic organs; ② Although neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine
  [5-HT]) can be synthesized in the brain, 90% of the body’s 5-HT is produced in the
  gut; ③ Tryptophan was directly transformed into indole and its derivatives in the
  gut controlled by gut microbiota, and many of the indole derivatives are potential
  AhR ligands. The detected tryptophan metabolites in the current study were marked
  with a white color and underlined. Note: Data are given as median with range. p
  values were determined by one-way ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis test. * p < 0.05; ** p
  < 0.01; *** p < 0.001. Abbreviations: Trp, tryptophan; IDO1, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
