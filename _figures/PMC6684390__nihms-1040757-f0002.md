caption: 'Pathways of ceramides synthesis. The schematic diagram depicts the pathways
  of ceramide metabolism. Cellular ceramide can be produced via several pathways:
  (1) by a de novo biosynthesis from precursor palmitate which is metabolized to dihydroceramides
  prior to formation of ceramides; (2) through the sphyngomyelin hydrolysis pathway;
  (3) through the “salvage pathway” consisting in the breakdown of more complex sphingolipids;
  ceramides are degraded by ceramidase leading to the production of sphingosine. The
  arrows indicate the increasing/decreasing (arrow up/arrow down) response to walnut
  consumption'
