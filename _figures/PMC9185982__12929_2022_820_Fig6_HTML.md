caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of SRF signal transduction. Multiple signaling pathways
  exhibit an effect on SRF transcriptional activation. TCF-mediated activation is
  mediated by a mitogen stimulus through the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, which leads to
  the activation of SRF-mediated cell proliferation- and differentiation-related genes.
  In calcium signaling, NFAT is dephosphorylated by the phosphatase Calcineurin, which
  facilitates NFAT nuclear localization, suggesting firm binding of MyocD-SRF, which
  mediates transcriptional activation. Additionally, calcium signaling activates Ca2+/calmodulin
  protein kinase, which further activates histone acetyltransferases, thereby facilitating
  MYOCD-SRF activation; this interaction is inhibited by multiple other factors, such
  as KLF4, HOP, and HDAC4, with the nuclear localization of HDAC4 inhibiting SRF-mediated
  transcription. Homeobox protein (HOP) has been known to inhibit the myocardin-SRF
  interaction, inhibiting transcriptional inactivation. Reports have also shown that
  Elk1 (a member of the Ets family of transcription factors) competes with MYOCD to
  competitively bind to SRF, affecting SRF-induced transcription. In addition, multiple
  receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), focal adhesions, receptor
  tyrosine kinases, and TGF-β, influence SRF transcription via the RhoA-Actin-MRTF
  signaling cascade. Smad3 activation via TGF-β signaling inhibits MRTF nuclear translocation
  and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of MRTF via the Smad3 and GSK3β axes. Multiple
  other molecules, such as dysbindin, myozap, and Rnd1, have been known to affect
  SRF signaling via the Rho-A-MRTF-SRF axis. MRTF in its active form is transported
  from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to induce SRF activation. Monomeric G-actin binds
  and inactivates MRTF, which is retained in the cytoplasm in the inactive actin-bound
  state. Thus, actin treadmilling controls MRTF-mediated SRF transcriptional activity.
  Furthermore, STARS can activate MRTF-SRF by controlling G- to -F actin polymerization.
