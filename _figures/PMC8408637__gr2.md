caption: Signaling pathway of receptor-ligand interactions integrate intrinsic and
  environmental signals governing SPCH and stomatal development. The MAPKKK YDA, MKK4/5,
  MKK7/9, and MPK3/6 signaling cascade is employed to repress stomatal production.
  TMM is associated with the ER family receptor kinases at the cytoplasm. Stomata
  cell divisions are regulated upstream by EPF1/2 processed by SDD1. The binding of
  EPF1/2 ligand by the ERf/TMM/SERK receptor complex and activation (including the
  antagonistic STOMAGEN that competes with EPF for the binding sites of the ERf/TMM/SERK
  complex) stimulates upstream of MAPK signaling cascade YDA and thereby activates
  MKK4/5 and MKK7/9, and then MPK3/6. This MAPK cascade interacts with SPCH, MUTE
  and FAMA. In the brassinosteroids (BR) signaling pathway, an intermediate signaling
  receptor GSK3-like kinase, BIN2, is activated by the BRI1-BAK1 complex, which negatively
  regulates YDA and SPCH. BIN2 suppresses SPCH by directly phosphorylating or indirectly
  through YDA or MKK4/5. The influence of light is observed to regulate the stomatal
  quantity through the ubiquitin E3 ligase COP1. Solid lines indicate established
  biochemical interactions and dashed lines reveal indirect interactions. BAK1, BRI1ASSOCIATED
  RECEPTOR KINASE 1; BRI1, BR INSENSITIVE 1; BSU1f, family of BRI1-SUPPRESSOR 1. Blocked
