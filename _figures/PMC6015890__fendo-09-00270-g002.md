caption: Control mechanisms for territorial aggression in birds in spring. There are
  three major components to control mechanisms. First, the regulation of hormone secretion
  from the hypothalamo–pituitary–gonad axis (left part of the figure), transport of
  hormones such as testosterone in the blood (lines in red), and the mechanisms associated
  with action of the hormone in the target cell, in this case a neuron in the brain
  (central part of the figure). The net result is regulation of territorial aggression
  by neural networks (right-hand part of the figure). This three-part system of control
  of hormone secretion, transport, and effects on target organs is an important concept
  because it offers many points of potential regulation. The secretion component on
  the left summarizes how sensory information, in this case social, in transduced
  through neurotransmitter, e.g., glutamate (NMDA), and neuroendocrine secretions
  such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and gonadotropin-inhibiting hormone
  (GnIH) into release of gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating
  hormone (not shown) from the anterior pituitary into the blood. LH travels to the
  gonad where it acts on cells that express steroidogenic enzymes to stimulate secretion
  of the sex steroid hormone testosterone (T) that is in turn released into the blood.
  Local actions of T in the testis include regulation of spermatogenesis, but it is
  also released into the blood in many avian species during breeding. Among many actions
  of T are effects on territorial aggression, and negative feedback on neuroendocrine
  and pituitary secretions (red lines). In birds, T circulates bound weakly to corticosteroid-binding
  globulin before entering target neurons involved in the expression of territorial
  aggression (center of figure). Once T has entered a target neuron, it has four potential
  fates. First, it can bind directly to the androgen receptor (AR), a member of the
  type 1 genomic receptors that become gene transcription factors once they are bound
  to T. Second, T can be converted to estradiol (E2) by the enzyme aromatase. E2 can
  then bind to either estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) or estrogen receptor beta (ERβ)
  both of which are genomic receptors that regulate gene transcription, but different
  genes from those regulated by AR. Third, T can be converted to 5α-dihydrotestosterone
  that also binds to AR and cannot be aromatized thus enhancing the AR gene transcription
  pathway. Fourth, T can be converted to 5β-dihydrotestosterone that binds to no known
  receptors and also cannot be aromatized indicating a deactivation shunt. The possibility
  of a rapid acting membrane receptor (non-genomic) should also be considered. A complex
  system of co-repressors and co-activators of genomic steroid receptor action are
  also known. Furthermore, it is now known that many neurons in vertebrate brains
  express all the enzymes required to synthesize T and E2 de novo from cholesterol
  or from circulating inert steroid hormone precursors such as dehydroepiandrosterone,
  androstenedione, and progesterone. The end result is regulatory action on neural
  networks that regulate expression of territorial aggression. Several neurotransmitters
  and neuromodulators such as arginine vasotocin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),
  and serotonin as also involved at this level. Evidence suggests that the basic secretory,
  transport, and action mechanisms are conserved across vertebrates. However, it is
  also clear that there are very many points at which the expression of territorial
  aggression may be affected indicating almost limitless combinations of possible
  regulatory mechanisms. From Wingfield (), courtesy of the American Ornithologist’s
