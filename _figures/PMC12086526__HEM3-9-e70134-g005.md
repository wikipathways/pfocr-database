caption: Metabolism regulates energy homeostasis, cell growth, differentiation programs,
  redox state, and signaling events. Schematic overview of several key functions of
  cellular metabolism. Catabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and
  oxidative phosphorylation, regenerate ATP to maintain energy homeostasis. In parallel,
  intermediates of these processes serve as precursors for anabolic activity. For
  instance, citrate fuels lipid synthesis, while cholesterol is generated from acetyl‐CoA.
  The pentose‐phosphate pathway is a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis, which
  yields precursors for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis. Metabolites, including
  TCA intermediates and S‐adenosyl‐methionine, affect cell fate by serving as direct
  substrates for epigenetic modifications (methylation, acetylation) or by affecting
  the activity of epigenetically active enzymes. ROS are physiological byproducts
  of cell metabolism and contribute to physiological processes, such as cell adaptation
  and immune responses. However, excessive amounts of ROS can be damaging to lipids,
  proteins, and DNA, making complex redox regulation central to cell survival during
  oxidative stress. Lipids and polar metabolites affect cell function by altering
  the activity of signaling cascades. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CoA, coenzyme A;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic acid
