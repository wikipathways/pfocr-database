caption: A) miRNAs are generated from pre-miRNAs by Dicer, giving rise to a duplex
  containing the mature miRNA and a partially complementary strand, referred to as
  miRNA*. AntimiRs are single stranded, antisense oligonucleotides designed to inhibit
  miRNA function. The perfect sequence complementarity allows the antisense oligonucleotide
  to bind to the miRNA and interfere with miRNA function (indicated in red). Although
  the exact mechanism of action remains undefined, this approach has been proven to
  be efficacious in vivo in preventing repression by the miRNA. One class of antimiR,
  the antagomir, is conjugated to cholesterol to facilitate cellular uptake (1). Other
  approaches use the oligonucleotides employing the locked nucleic acid (LNA) phosphorothioate
  chemistry (2) or the widely employed 2′-O-methoxyethyl phosphorothioate (MOE) modification
  (3). miR mimics are short double stranded oligonucleotides in which one strand is
  identical to the mature miRNA sequence (guide strand) and a complimentary or partially
  complementary stand is complexed with the mature miRNA sequence (passenger strand).
  The double stranded structure is required for efficient recognition and loading
  of the guide strand into the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) complex, after
  which it can function like the endogenous miRNA to increase the level of the miRNA
  of interest and more potently block targeted gene expression (indicated in green).
  B) In addition to tools available to directly target a miRNA or reduce miRNA levels,
  there are several potential approaches to target a miRNA pathway. One way of interfering
  with miRNA function is by scavenging away the miRNA and thereby preventing it from
  binding its mRNA targets, called sponging. In this technique, a series of either
  perfectly or imperfectly paired binding sites for a specific miRNA are introduced
  into an expression cassette in the 3′ untranslated region of a reporter gene. The
  multiplexed binding sites serve as competitive inhibitors and occupy the specific
  native miRNA-programmed RISC complexes in the cell. The association of a miRNA with
  a specific mRNA target can also be perturbed using an occupier, an oligonucleotide
  with perfect complementarity to the miRNA target sequence in the 3′ UTR of the mRNA,
  which thereby masks the binding site and prevents association with the miRNA. A
  theoretical advantage of this approach is its specificity. Since a miRNA has multiple
  targets, directly inhibiting a miRNA will influence all downstream targets, which
  may increase the probability of off-targets effects, while target occupation can
  modulate the interaction of a miRNA with one specific target. A third approach to
  inhibit miR function involves so-called erasers, in which expression of a tandem
  repeat of a perfect complementary sequence of the target miR inhibits endogenous
  miRNA. Although ‘sponging’, ‘masking’ and ‘erasing’ provide interesting opportunities
  to interfere with miRNA function, to date no studies have been published that prove
  their in vivo efficacy.
