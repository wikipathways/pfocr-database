caption: 'Midsagittal diagram of the mammalian (laboratory rat) brain showing brain
  circuitry involved in mediating drug-induced reward, drug-seeking behavior, drug-taking
  behavior, drug craving, and relapse to drug-seeking behavior. Sites at which various
  addictive drugs act to enhance brain reward substrates are indicated. The principal
  circuit mediating drug-induced reward is the dopamine (DA) circuit originating in
  the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projecting to the nucleus accumbens (Acb).
  The principal circuit mediating drug-induced stimulus-response and stimulus-reward
  learning involves the VTA, Acb, prefrontal cortex (FCX), and amygdala (AMYG). The
  principal circuit mediating drug-triggered relapse to drug-seeking behavior involves
  the Acb. Two principal circuits mediate stress-triggered relapse to drug-seeking
  behavior: one involving the lateral tegmental noradrenergic cell groups (LAT-TEG)
  and their projections to the hypothalamus (HYPOTHAL), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
  (BNST), Acb, and AMYG and one involving corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) cell
  groups in the AMYG and their projections to the BNST. The principal circuitry mediating
  cue-triggered relapse to drug-seeking behavior involves glutamatergic cell groups
  in the AMYG and hippocampus (HIPP) and their projections to the VTA-Acb DA pathway.
