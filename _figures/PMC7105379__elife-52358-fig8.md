caption: Biochemical interactions between TRIM32 and glycolytic enzymes such as Ald
  or Pglym cooperate in maintaining glycolytic activity for the synthesis of macromolecules
  required for cell growth. Loss of TRIM32 results in reduced levels of glycolytic
  enzymes, reduced glycolytic pathway intermediates, and compromises cell growth.
