caption: Mesolimbic dopamine signaling during reward seeking and following chronic
  cannabinoid exposure. (A) Exposure to reward-related stimuli promotes (1) burst
  firing of dopamine neurons driven by ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) binding.
  Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and group 1 metabotropic
  glutamate receptor (mGluR1/5) binding promotes the enzymatic synthesis of 2-AG from
  diacylglycerol (DAG). Retrograde 2-AG release disinhibits dopamine neurons via CB1
  receptor binding to presynaptic GABAA receptors. (2) Burst firing elicits phasic
  dopamine release in the NAc onto indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) and
  direct pathway MSNs (dMSNs). D2 receptor binding inhibits iMSNs via Gi/o inhibition
  of cAMP/PKA pathway. (3) 2-AG and anandamide (AEA) mobilization in the NAc is also
  mediated by mGluR1/5 and VGCCs (not shown). D2 receptor binding supports eCB mobilization
  by inhibiting adenosine A2A receptor inhibition of eCB release (not shown; Lerner
  et al., 2010). CB1 receptor binding on presynaptic glutamate terminals suppresses
  iMSN excitatory drive to further inhibit indirect pathway function and avoidance
  behavior. (3) Phasic dopamine release binds Gs-coupled D1 receptors to activate
  the cAMP/PKA pathway and depolarize dMSNs. Work showing eCB-LTD is preferential
  to iMSNs () permits excitatory drive onto dMSNs to support direct pathway function
  and reward seeking. (B) Following chronic, high dose cannabinoid exposure, (1) dopamine
  neurons become inhibited due to CB1 receptor desensitization on presynaptic GABA
  terminals, and LTD at glutamate synapses. (2) Reduced dopamine release decreases
  D1-mediated activation of dMSNs and reduces direct pathway activation of reward
  seeking. (3) CB1 desensitization reduces eCB-LTD and enhances excitatory drive onto
  iMSNs, increasing indirect pathway function and avoidance behavior.
