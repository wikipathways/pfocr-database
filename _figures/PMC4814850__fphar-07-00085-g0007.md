caption: Schematic diagram of the disturbed metabolic pathway related to ANIT and
  rhubarb treatment. The pink and light blue boxes indicate metabolites significantly
  higher and lower in the model group than in the control group, respectively. The
  boxes bordered in red and blue represent metabolites that are significantly higher
  and lower in the Rhu4 group than in control group, respectively. Lox in the figure
  stands for lipoxygenase.
