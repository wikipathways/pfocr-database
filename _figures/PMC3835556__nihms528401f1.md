caption: 'Regulation of Hsp genes by HSF and FOXO. Three signaling pathways (HSF,
  IIS and JNK) converge upon the transcription factors FOXO and HSF to activate expression
  of Hsp genes. (i) FOXO and HSF transcription factors reside in the nucleus, bound
  to the promoter of an Hsp gene, where they activate expression of Hsps and other
  genes and promote stress resistance and longevity. ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species;
  shown in red) can activate the JNK stress-response pathway (and other factors) that
  in turn activate the FOXO transcription factor and facilitate its translocation
  into the nucleus. (ii) IIS acts to negatively regulate the activity of FOXO. The
  insulin-like receptor (InR in Drosophila; Daf2 in C. elegans) is activated by binding
  of insulin-like ligands (not shown). The InR initiates a signal transduction cascade
  involving the Insulin Receptor Substrate (called IRS in mammals and CHICO in Drosophila),
  PI3K (AGE1 in C. elegans) and the serine/threonine protein kinase AKT. AKT phosphorylates
  FOXO, which results in FOXO remaining sequestered in the cytoplasm. In this way,
  active signaling through the IIS pathway negatively regulates FOXO, Hsp expression,
  and lifespan. (iii) Although Hsps are abundant in cells, there appears to be very
  little excess, as partial reductions in specific Hsps using RNAi tends to have profound
  effects. Hsps that are “available” for binding to a client, such as a newly denatured
  protein, become so by dissociating from other clients. For example, the denaturation
  of cytosolic proteins by ROS or heat (iv) reveals hydrophobic amino acid residues
  that bind and sequester Hsps (Hsps indicated as black ovals). The Hsps are titrated
  away from other clients, including HSF. Dissociation of the Hsps from HSF monomers
  allows HSF to convert to the active trimeric form, translocate to the nucleus, and
  activate the expression of Hsp genes. The resultant high-level expression of the
  Hsp genes produces sufficient Hsp protein to again bind to and inactivate HSF (v),
  thereby providing a negative feedback to terminate the response. The Hsps bind to
  a wide variety of clients, including inhibitory interactions with the tumor-suppressor
  (and senescence-regulatory protein) p53. In this way, stresses such as heat or oxidative
  stress that cause the denaturation of proteins can coordinately affect a variety
  of pathways by sequestering the Hsps away from their networks of clients. HSF, heat
  shock factor; IIS, insulin/IGF1-like signaling pathway; InR, insulin receptor; PI3K,
  phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (AGE1 in C. elegans); AKT, serine/threonine protein
  kinase; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase.Key: Solid arrowheads indicate activation. T-bars
