caption: ERK shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm regulates myogenesis. This
  model demonstrates that FGF-ERK signaling cascade acts to block the premature differentiation
  of myogenesis in the embryo. This pathway leads to the phosphorylation of ERK by
  MEK and its translocation to the nucleus where it promotes cell cycle progression
  (and can inhibit muscle differentiation). Inhibition of ERK nuclear translocation
  leads to robust myogenic differentiation in muscle progenitors and in muscle satellite
  cells.
