caption: Schematic overview of sodium uptake into tomato roots and transport into
  leaves. Na+ ions enter tomato root cells primarily through NSCC pathway. Na+ entering
  the cell is sensed by a yet undetermined sensory mechanism. Subsequently, Ca2+,
  ROS, and hormone (not shown) signaling pathways are activated. Ca2+ induces ROS
  production by RBOHs and ROS induces Ca2+ import. As one part of the Ca2+-signaling
  pathway, CIPKs, CBLs, and CDPKs become active and alter the global transcriptional
  profile in the nucleus. MAPKs activated by Ca2+-ROS- signaling pathway also transduce
  downstream gene transcription in the nucleus. These early signaling pathways result
  in activation of detoxification mechanisms. Cytosolic Ca2+ ions activate SOS3. SOS2
  regulates ATPase, NHX2 and NHX4, increasing Na+/H+ and K+/H+ anti-transport activity
  in root vacuole and endosome. The kinase activity of SOS2 is negatively regulated
  by 14-3-3 proteins, and the inhibition on SOS2 is released by the Ca2+-mediated
  binding of PKS5 with 14-3-3. SOS1 activated by SOS2-SOS3 heterologous kinase complex
  is responsible for extruding Na+ out the root and partitioning Na+ in organs. J3
  inhibits PKS5 kinase activity, activating the activity of PM H+-ATPases and generating
  a proton gradient required for Na+ transport of SOS1. CBL10-SOS2 complex triggers
  the separation of Na+ into leaf vacuole and the transport of Na+ ions from leaves
  to xylem, activates the tonoplast targets TPC1 and AVP1, maintaining an appropriate
  Na+/Ca2+ ratio and V-ATPase, and promotes the proton gradient necessary to energize
  the Ca2+ transport toward the vacuole through CAX1. HKT1;2 is involved in xylem
  Na+ unloading and Na+ uploading into the phloem, thus promoting Na+ recirculation
  from shoots to roots, which can be additionally regulated by HKT1;1 in roots. HAK20

    in activation of detoxification mechanisms. Cytosolic Ca2+ ions activate SOS3.
    SOS2 regulates ATPase, NHX2 and NHX4, increasing Na+/H+ and K+/H+ anti-transport
