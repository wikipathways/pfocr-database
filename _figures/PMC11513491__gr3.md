caption: Schematic illustration proposed for the probable role of PI3K axis in AML
  cells. Through aberrant over-expression of SNHG7 activation, subsequently leads
  to over activation PI3K signaling pathway in AML cells. Upon BGL3 downregulation
  and this defective loop may be responsible for providing a chance for AML cells
  to proliferate more strongly
