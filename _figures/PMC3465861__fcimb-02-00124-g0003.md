caption: Host cell surface binding and internalization of CDT. CDT binds to a cell
  surface determinant, and in some cases, is affected by perturbations in lipid rafts.
  Following internalization by clathrin-coated pits to the endosomes, CDT is trafficked
  in a retrograde fashion to the Golgi-apparatus, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
  From the ER, CdtB localizes to the nucleus by a yet unconfirmed route directly,
  or through the cytoplasm. Experimental techniques used to identify the pathway employed
  by CDT to trafficking inside the cell, are represented next to the organelles involved.
