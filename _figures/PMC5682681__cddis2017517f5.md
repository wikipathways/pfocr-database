caption: Summary of observations on neuronal damage by two different strains of Zika
  virus. hNSCs infected with PRVABC59 induced activation of the p53-p21 signaling
  axis, driving cells toward cell cycle arrest, whereas MR766-infected hNSCs were
  driven by apoptotic pathway. These cells infected with both Zika virus strains followed
  by incubation in astrocyte differentiating medium displayed cell death
papertitle: Zika virus infection dysregulates human neural stem cell growth and inhibits
  differentiation into neuroprogenitor cells.
