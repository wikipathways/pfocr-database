caption: Interaction mapping of overlapping proteome changes in astrocytes treated
  with GBM a -stem and b -diff EVs. Genes corresponding to differentially abundant
  proteins were mapped using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Proteins with significantly
  higher or lower levels in astrocytes have red and green symbols, respectively. Networks
  are annotated with significantly associated biological and canonical pathways (see
  legends for symbols and p values). IPA generated networks converged on significant
  upstream regulator molecules with predicted activations (orange) or inhibition (blue)
