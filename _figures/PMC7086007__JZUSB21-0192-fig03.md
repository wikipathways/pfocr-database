caption: NLR signaling pathways in diabetic nephropathyThe NLRP3 inflammasome can
  be activated by the ROS/TXNIP/NADPH oxidase signaling pathway and extracellular
  ATP, and inhibited by IL-22. Activated NLRP3 can cause excessive amounts of inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. NOD1/2 can activate MAPKs and NF-κB, and NLRC4
  and NLRC5 can also activate NF-κB. In addition, NLPC4 and NLRC5 affect the JNK and
  TGF-β/Smad pathways, respectively. NLR, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
  (NOD)-like receptor; NLRP3, NLR protein 3; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TXNIP,
  thioredoxin-interacting protein; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; IL, interleukin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; NLRC, NLR family caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing
