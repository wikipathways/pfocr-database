caption: Aberrant activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in papillary thyroid tumor
  cells. In normal follicular cells, binding of proliferation signal molecules to
  membrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as RET and NTRK1 leads to receptor
  phosphorylation and activation of the downstream effector RAS. The phosphorylation
  cascade in the downstream effectors leads to the translocation of ERK to the nucleus
  to affect genes involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and
  survival. In PTC, fusion genes such as RET/PTCs and TRK-T1 and mutated genes such
  as BRAFV600E and RAS constitutively activate MAPK signaling, thereby leading to
  the development of carcinogenesis.
