caption: If ER stress is irremediable, IRE1α becomes hyperactivated and undergoes
  homo-oligomerization. Under sustained oligomerization, IRE1α’s RNase endonucleolytically
  degrades hundreds of ER-localized mRNAs containing an N-terminal signal sequence,
  which depletes ER cargo and protein-folding components to further worsen ER stress.
  Moreover, when hyperactivated, IRE1α’s RNase directly cleaves select microRNAs that
  normally repress pro-apoptotic targets. In addition to signaling through RNA substrates,
  IRE1α oligomerization has been shown to induce activation or upregulation of a number
  of pro-inflammatory proteins. Finally, sustained IRE1α oligomerization serves as
  an activation platform for ASK1 and its downstream target JNK. Phosphorylation by
  JNK has been reported to both activate pro-apoptotic BIM and inhibit anti-apoptotic
  BCL-2. While a temporary pause in protein translation due to eIF2α phosphorylation
  can be beneficial for cells under ER stress, a protracted block in translation from
  sustained PERK signaling is incompatible with survival. Moreover, high levels of
  CHOP/GADD153 transcription factor can inhibit the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2
  to hasten cell death and upregulate pro-apoptotic BIM to trigger activation of the
  mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway.
