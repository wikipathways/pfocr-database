caption: Overview of mevalonate pathway and coronavirus infection. (A) Cholesterol
  metabolizing enzymes and metabolites act against viral infectivity. Red type represents
  cholesterol metabolizing enzymes or corresponding natural products which may be
  used as drug targets or directly to exert antiviral effects. (a) HMG-CoA reductase
  regulates cholesterol biosynthesis and is targeted by statins. (b, c, d) The sterol
  metabolic network participates in interferon (IFN) antiviral responses. (e, f) SARS-CoV-2
  propagation in cultured cells is inhibited by various cholesterol molecules and
  semi-synthetic oxysterols. The detailed steps of the cholesterol synthesis pathway
  can be found in (–). (B) Cholesterol metabolism reprogramming and antiviral responses
  after viral infection. (a) Cholesterol promotes pathological syncytial formation
  during SARS-COV-2 infection. (b) Serum TC, TG, and non-esterified polyunsaturated
  fatty acid levels are remodeled in COVID-19 patients. (c, d) SARS-CoV-2 infection
  increases glucose entry into the TCA cycle via increased pyruvate carboxylase expression
  and reduced oxidative glutamine metabolism, while maintaining reductive carboxylation.
  (f) SREBP-dependent lipidomic reprogramming is a broad-spectrum antiviral target,
  AM580 strongly inhibits coronavirus replication by interacting with SREBP-2. (e,
  h, g, i, j) COVID-19-activated SREBP-2 disturbs cholesterol biosynthesis, leading
  to a cytokine storm. Importantly, SREBP-2 activity is regulated by crosstalk between
  cholesterol consumption and NF-κB expression via several inflammatory response processes
  induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Red arrows represent upregulation and blue arrows
  represent downregulation. Acetyl-CoA, Acetyl-Coenzyme A; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
