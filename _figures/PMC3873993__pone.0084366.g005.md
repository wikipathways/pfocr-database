caption: (A) The evolution from normal pancreatic duct epithelial cell to tumor cell
  line. The pathway alterations found in the analyses of the genomic and expression
  arrays between each transition are listed above the arrows. The red and blue alterations
  represent gains or upregulation, and losses or downregulation, respectively. (B)
  The pathways that were altered in the pancreatic duct cell carcinogenesis model.
  Yellow and purple corresponds to changes seen in the TβR and TβR-KRAS cell lines,
  respectively.
