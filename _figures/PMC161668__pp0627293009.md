caption: Model of the two-component signal transduction pathways in Arabidopsis. The
  cytokinin signal is perceived by multiple His protein kinases at the plasma membrane.
  Upon perception of the cytokinin signal, His protein kinases initiate a signaling
  cascade via the phosphorelay that results in the nuclear translocation of AHPs ().
  Activated AHPs may interact with sequestered ARRs or ARR complexes, transfer the
  phosphate to the receiver domain of its cognate B-type ARR, releasing these activation-type
  ARRs from putative repressors in the nucleus. The dephosphorylated AHP shuttles
  back to the cytosol, where it can be rephosphorylated. The liberated ARRs bind to
  multiple cis elements in the promoter of target genes. The activation of the repressor-type
  ARRs as primary cytokinin response genes provides a negative feedback mechanism.
  In addition to the CTR1 signaling pathway, additional ethylene signaling pathways
  could be mediated by two-component components (). Red light and cytokinin signaling
  is converged at ARR4. ARR4 stabilizes the active form of PHYB by inhibiting dark
  reversion (). Stress and Glc may also modulate two-component signaling (; F. Rolland
  and J. Sheen, unpublished data). RD, Response domain; BD, DNA binding domain; AD,
