caption: Graphical illustration of MC degranulation triggered by Spike/RBD proteins.
  The interaction between spike/RBD proteins and cellular receptors initiates the
  activation of src kinase, which subsequently stimulates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
  This, in turn, leads to an accumulation of intracellular calcium ions. The elevated
  calcium levels facilitate microtubule-dependent granule transport, ultimately promoting
  MC degranulation
