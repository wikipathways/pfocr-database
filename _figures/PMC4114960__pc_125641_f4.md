caption: Viral-Induced Rewiring of Host Metabolism Leads to an Increase in Fatty Acid
  Biosynthesis.(A) Integrated metabolic map of significantly enriched biological pathways
  in host gene cluster 3. Genes associated with cluster 3 are marked in dark red.
  Inserted heat maps present normalized intensities (mean, n = 3) of specific metabolites
  in noninfected E. huxleyi cells and cells infected by the lytic or nonlytic virus
  at 4, 24, 32, and 48 . Dark-red bar indicates inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis
  by C75. Fold-change values of changes in metabolite concentration relative to the
  control are presented as Supplemental Data Set 4. Metabolites marked by an asterisk
  were detected in nonphosphorylated form and a minus sign indicates the absence of
  a metabolite at a specific time point. Dashed lines refer to connections via a known
  metabolic pathway. Green, low metabolite concentration; yellow, high metabolite
  concentration. For abbreviations of enzyme names, see Supplemental Data Set 12.(B)
  Gene expression pattern of host cluster 3. The average of the expression normalized
  values is presented as thick black line.(C) The effect of inhibition of fatty acid
  biosynthesis by various concentrations of C75 on extracellular virus abundance at
  72  relative to viruses released from infected cells without the addition of the
  inhibitor (percentage of control) (mean ± sd, n = 3), and the percentage of viable
  cells at 24  as measured by flow cytometry (mean ± 3·sd, n = 3). FA, fatty acid;
  P, phosphate; RPM, reads per million.
