caption: TLR-induced microbial resistance. Detection of microbial PAMPs, endogenous
  DAMPs or synthetic ligands by lung epithelial TLRs results in receptor-specific
  recruitment of the TIR adaptors MyD88, Mal, TRIF and/or TRAM. TRIF-dependent signalling
  from TLR3 and TLR4 activates TRAF3 signalling via TANK and TBK1-IKK complex, as
  well as RIP1-TAK1-dependent activation of the canonical IKK complex. Together, these
  TRIF-dependent pathways promote transcription of inflammatory mediators, type I
  interferons and antimicrobial effectors via IRF3, IRF7 and NF-κB translocation to
  the nucleus. MyD88-dependent signalling from TLR 4, 2/1, 2/6, 5, 7, 8 and 9 proceeds
  by IRAK activation. All of the MyD88-utilizing TLRs can activate IRAK4 signalling
  (with or without IRAK2), leading to activation of IRAK1-TRAF6. In turn, TRAF6 activates
  the TAK1-TAB1/2 complex, which promotes IKK and MAPKK signalling. NF-κB, JNK and
  p38 signalling then results in transcription of inflammatory and antimicrobial genes.
  Direct MyD88-dependent IRAK1 activation by TLR 7, 8 and 9 also results in activation
  of TRAF3-IRF7 and TRAF6-IRF1-dependent transcription of inflammatory and antimicrobial
  genes. Chemokines are secreted basolaterally to recruit leucocytes to participate
  in defence of the lungs. Microbicidal effectors are directed apically, such as antimicrobial
  polypeptides and oxidases that generate ROS. Further, the epithelium utilizes TLR-dependent,
  non-transcriptionally regulated events to kill pathogens, such as p38-dependent
  activation of oxidases. (DAMPs, danger-associated molecular patterns; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; IKK, IκB kinase; IRAK, Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; IRF,
  interferon regulatory factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases pathway; Mal, MyD88-adapter-like,
