  metabolites derived from products of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway and
  the Krebs cycle. The final compounds include flavonols (colorless pigments), anthocyanins
  (pink and red pigments), and condensed tannins (brown pigments). The characterized
  enzymes are shown in boldface. The various mutants identified are noted adjacent
  to the step they affect, with putative regulatory loci given in parentheses. ban,
