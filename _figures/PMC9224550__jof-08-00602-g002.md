caption: A schematic model of the early phase interaction between Metarhizium spp.
  and locusts. The regulatory mechanisms of appressorial formation and the early phase
  immune response are depicted. The regulatory pathway of appressorial formation only
  represents the main signaling pathway, including Ca2+/CaM, cAMP/PKA, and MAPKs.
  The processes of LD synthesis and degradation are also shown in the model. The dotted
  arrows represent indirect actions to promote another component. The solid arrows
  or T indicate direct promotion or restraint to another component. DAG, diacylglycerol;
  TAG, triacylglycerol; LD, lipid droplet; GAG, galactosaminogalactan and the biosynthesis
  genes cluster; WB, woronin body; SP, serine protease; PPO, prophenoloxidase.
