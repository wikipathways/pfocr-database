caption: Metabolic model for 4T1 and 67NR cells. (A) Extracellular 1-13C-Glc (carbons
  C1-6 shown as spheres; 13C-labeled carbon in black) in the medium is taken up by
  the cells via GLUT transporters. Glucose is then metabolized through the glycolytic
  pathway, labeling 50% of the de novo pools of myo-inositol (C2, C4), DHAP (C1),
  and glycerol-3-phosphate (C1), which could be detected in the cell perfusion system
  experiments (). Pyruvate (C3 labeling) can be further metabolized in the cytosol
  to lactate (C3 labeling), regenerating the NAD+ consumed during glycolysis, or to
  alanine (C3 labeling) by transamination of glutamate with pyruvate. Alternatively,
  pyruvate can be channeled to the mitochondria and converted to acetyl-CoA (C2 labeling)
  via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle and condenses
  with OAA (initial unlabeled pool) to produce citrate, which then transfers its label
  to α-ketoglutarate (C4). The exchange between α-ketoglutarate (fast turnover) and
  glutamate (C4 labeling) makes the latter a marker of TCA cycle activity. The C4
  label of α-ketoglutarate is then transferred to succinate C2 (or C3; not distinguishable)
  and then to OAA C2 (C3). Because succinate C2 (C3) accumulates in 67NR cells, it
  is likely that their TCA cycle is restricted at the level of SDH, leading to lower
  flux to OAA (green arrows; higher flux expected in 4T1 cells, displayed by red arrows).
  After this first turn of the TCA cycle, a significant part of the intermediates
  has been removed for biosynthetic purposes; the remaining OAA can be used for the
  second turn — reactions indicated by the dotted gray arrows and the resulting molecules
  by the gray spheres (13C label, gray; unlabeled, white). In this case, the resulting
  labeling pattern of glutamate is more complex and generates an additional 1:1 pool
  of C2 and C3 labeling (highlighted by short gray arrows). (B) Besides PDH, an alternative
  way for pyruvate to enter the TCA cycle is through pyruvate carboxylase (PC). This
  anaplerotic pathway becomes more important when glutamine is not sufficiently available
  to cells or they cannot use it to regenerate OAA. In this case, the first turn of
  the TCA cycle will generate a 1:1 labeling of glutamate in positions C4 and C2 (indicated
  by short gray arrows).
