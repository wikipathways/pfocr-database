caption: The network view was built by combining genetic associations with a GGM network
  created from metabolite concentrations. A. Each node represents either a set of
  metabolites belonging to the same pathway (circular nodes) or a genetic locus (diamond-shaped
  nodes). An edge between a pathway and a locus was drawn if at least one metabolite
  showed a genome-wide significant association with the locus. A line between two
  pathway nodes was drawn if there was at least one connection in the underlying metabolite
  GGM network between two metabolites of the respective pathways (see ). Node color
  keys are the same as in . Numbers within metabolite loci indicate pathway name as
  detailed in the legend. Numbers associated with each pathway name indicate the number
  of metabolites contained within each pathway node. B. Example of a network with
  full-detail resolution. The network is provided in digital form for interactive
  viewing at the supporting online website (see ). The fully annotated network is
  also available for download in Cytoscape format from the same website.
