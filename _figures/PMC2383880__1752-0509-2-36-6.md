caption: Follow through of signalling pathways stimulated by IFNG (6a) and FASLG (6b).
  The signalling events following the input signals of IFNG and FASLG have been highlighted
  on the entire map in lilac and orange, respectively. The nodes activated or directly
  affected by FASLG or IFN-gamma binding to their receptors are coloured and the interaction
  edges and gates are also highlighted. Nodes and edges not directly downstream of
  the FASLG or IFNG signalling are shown in grey. This figure demonstrates inputs
  into the pathway can clearly be followed to the expected outcome events. In the
  case of IFNG-input, gene transcription is the resulting event, and in the case of
  FASLG, apoptosis. Furthermore these examples clearly depict the interactions of
  the pathway can be followed logically and do not result in unexpected crosstalk.
