caption: Model for action of GNA-3 in N. crassa. Control of adenylyl cyclase protein
  levels by GNA-3 and GTP-dependent stimulation by GNA-1 results in regulation of
  intracellular cAMP levels. Binding of cAMP to PKA results in dissociation of the
  MCB (regulatory) and PKA-C (catalytic) subunits. Activated PKA-C positively regulates
  aerial hypha formation and apical extension of basal hyphae and negatively regulates
  aerial and submerged conidiation and glucose-regulated gene expression. GNA-3 also
  regulates ascospore production through a cAMP-independent pathway. RCO-3 has previously
  been shown to negatively influence submerged conidiation and glucose-regulated gene
  expression (). A Gβ protein, GNB-1, has been identified in N. crassa, and its function
  is currently being investigated (Q. Yang, S. I. Poole, and K. A. Borkovich, unpublished
  data). Gray arrows indicate steps that may involve intermediate components. Question
  marks indicate unknown ligands for GPCRs coupled to GNA-1 and GNA-3.
