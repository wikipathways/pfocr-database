caption: PI3K/AKT pathway is an intracellular signal transduction pathway that promotes
  cell growth and proliferation in response to extracellular signals. The binding
  of the ligands such as growth factors to the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) induces
  dimerization of two RTK monomers, which consequently leads to activation of the
  intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and auto-phosphorylation by each monomer. The
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), once activated through direct stimulation
  of the regulatory subunit bound to the activated receptor, converts phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3
  binds the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) at the plasma membrane.
  PDK1 in turn phosphorylates and activates AKT protein. Once activated, AKT via phosphorylation
  regulates activation or suppression of several proteins involved in cell growth
  and proliferation. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is the main downregulation
  protein that can convert PIP3 into PIP2. Although AKT activation promotes BRCA1
  expression through phosphorylation, BRCA1 can downregulate AKT activation by different
  mechanisms, among which are the activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which
  dephosphorylates AKT.
