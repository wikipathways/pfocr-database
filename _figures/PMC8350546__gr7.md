caption: Gene network for cell cycle regulation during male germ cell developmentSchematic
  drawing of the model proposed in this and previous studies. In the absence of NANOS2,
  DAZL, and STRA8 are upregulated and both mitotic and meiotic pathways are promoted.
  Dazl was identified as the direct target of NANOS2 and DAZL may increase RA responsiveness.
  The forced expression of DAZL promotes both mitotic and meiotic pathways (). Double
  KO of NANOS2 and STRA8 represses only the meiotic pathway not the mitotic pathway
  (). Our dKO study revealed that Dazl is not the sole target of NANOS2 responsible
  for cell cycle regulation. NANOS2 also downregulates mTORC1 activity via the suppression
  of its activator(s), Rheb, Amp32b. This results in the downregulation of CyclinD1
  and activates RB1, which suppresses E2F function. As an independent pathway, NANOS2
  may also suppress Ptma.
