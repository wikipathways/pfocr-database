caption: An amalgamated and simplified depiction of relevant C1 metabolic pathways,
  namely the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle, the xylulose monophosphate (XuMP)
  cycle, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, the serine cycle, reductive acetyl-CoA
  (Wood-Ljungdahl) cycle, and the reductive glycine pathway. Intracycle reactions
  and conversion of metabolites by glycolysis is not shown. Emphasis is placed on
  precursors for isoprenoid and central carbon metabolism, namely G3P, acetyl-CoA,
  and pyruvate. For clarity, only the enzymes involved in the initial C1 assimilation
  are listed. For simplicity, FALDH is the depicted enzyme for conversion of formaldehyde
  to formate and the canonical methanogenic reactions are omitted. 1,3BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglyceric
  acid; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate; DAS, dihydroxyacetone synthase; DHA, dihydroxyacetone;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; F6BP, fructose 6-bisphosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate;
  FALDH, formaldehyde dehydrogenase; FDH, formate dehydrogenase; FTL, formate-THF
  ligase; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; H6P, hexulose
  6-phosphate; HPS, hexulose-6-phosphate synthase; MDH, methanol dehydrogenase; MMO,
  methane monooxygenase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PGA, 3-phosphoglyceric acid; Ru5P,
  ribulose 5-phosphate; RuBisCO, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase;
  RuBP, ribulose bisphosphate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; Xu5P, xylulose 5-phosphate.
