caption: 'Schematic diagram for the molecular basis of DACT1α as a tumor suppressor
  gene in gastric cancer. Ectopic expression of DACT1α suppressed gastric cancer cell
  growth was associated with several biological effects: 1) Suppression of PDGFB and
  VEGFA contributed to dampened cell proliferation and angiogenesis. 3) DACT1α mediated
  cell spreading adhesion, migration and invasion inhibition were associated with
  the suppression of ITGA1, ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGB3, MCAM, MMP9 and PLAU.'
