caption: Possible biosynthetic pathways for sesame lignans, sesamin and sesamolin.
  The pathway map was constructed based on KEGG pathway map (see http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00940).
  Numbers correspond to individual reactions and serve to identify the respective
  enzyme in Additional file . Candidate gene found in the present sesame seed ESTs
  dataset was shown as green.
