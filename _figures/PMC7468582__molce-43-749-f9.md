caption: When the artery is exposed to stimuli (e.g., external force, hypo­xia, or
  inflammation), cytokines that activate the JAK2/STAT3 pathway are released. Activated
  STAT3 translocates to the nucleus, where it directly increases the trans­criptional
  activity and subse­quent expression of WDR1. Ele­vated levels of WDR1 enhance the
  proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle cell phenotype
  conversion and the enhancement of migration and proliferation capacities are key
  factors that promote the formation of vascular intima.
