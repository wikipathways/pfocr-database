  differential metabolites. Orange letters represent enzymes in metabolic pathways.
  A rectangle with a particular color represented the relative content of each metabolite.

  were represented with red and blue, respectively. CHS: chalcone synthase C2; CHI:

  CYP75B3: flavonoid 3′-monooxygenase; F3H: flavanone 3-dioxygenase; FNSI: flavone
  synthase I; FNSII: flavone synthase II; FLS: flavonol synthase; FOM: flavone 3′-O-methyltransferase;
