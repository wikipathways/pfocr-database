caption: Overview of the NF-κB activation pathways and the impact of S-glutathionylation.
  A) Schematic representation of activation of classical (top) and alternative (bottom)
  NF-κB activation pathways, and outcomes. The classical pathway is activated by diverse
  ligands, such as LPS, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFα), Interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β),
  among many others, which results in the activation of Inhibitory kappa B kinase
  beta (IKKβ) which in turn mediates degradation of IκBα, resulting in the nuclear
  translocation and activation of RelA/p50 NF-kB subunits. The alternative NF-κB pathway
  is activated by distinct subsets of ligands, such as B cell Activating Factor (BAFF),
  CD40 ligand (CD40L) etc. which result in NF-κB Inducing Kinase (NIK) dependent activation
  of I kappa B kinase alpha (IKKα) which phosphorylates p100, and resultant proteolytic
  processing to p52. RelB/p52 dimeric complexes then are translocated to the nucleus,
  to activate transcription of unique sets of genes. Note that this schematic is an
  oversimplification, as additional regulatory post-translational modifications, and
  chromatin remodeling events occur to enable transcriptional activation of genes.
  Cross talk between classical and alternative NF-κB pathways also occurs, and is
  not illustrated here. B) Impact of H2O2 of IKKβ and NF-κB signaling. Stimulation
  of cells with LPS or TNFα leads to activation of IKKβ, and downstream NF-κB signaling.
  In the presence of H2O2 (100–200 μM) or following overexpression of NOX1, IKKβ is
  inhibited via S-glutathionylation (-SSG) of Cys179. Overexpression of glutaredoxin-1
  (Grx1) reverses S-glutathionylation of IKKβ (-SH), and permits NF-κB signaling in
  the presence of H2O2. This schematic is a summary of previously published data [].
