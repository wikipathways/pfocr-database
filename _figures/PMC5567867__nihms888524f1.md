caption: Major steps in the HR pathway in budding yeast. After DSB formation, the
  break is recognized by the MRX (Mre11, Rad50, Xrs2) complex along with the cofactor
  Sae2 to initiate initial 5′ resection. Then, Sgs1, Dna2 and Exo1 (not shown) cooperate
  to catalyze more extensive resection, revealing 3′ ssDNA tracts, which are bound
  by the single-strand binding protein RPA. Proteins involved in checkpoint signaling
  bind to RPA, such as the 9-1-1 complex and the ATR homolog Mec1 and its DNA binding
  partner Ddc2. Rad52, a recombination mediator, catalyzes the exchange of RPA for
  the recombinase Rad51, which forms filaments on ssDNA. These filaments invade dsDNA
  sequences to find homology, and form a D-Loop structure. Later, the second end can
  be captured to form double Holliday junctions, which can be resolved following repair
  to yield both crossover and non-crossover products.
