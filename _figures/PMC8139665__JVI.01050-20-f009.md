caption: Model for how ZIKV-mediated activation of TLR3 might suppress the IFN response.
  (A) In the infected cell, ZIKV RNA is sensed by RIG-I-like receptors and TLR3. The
  RIG-I/MDA5 signaling pathway leads to the production of interferons (IFNs) and,
  via NF-κB, inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-10 and IL-6. (B) IFNs activate Jak/STAT1
  signaling, which turns on the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), while IL-6
  and IL-10 trigger a signaling cascade resulting in phosphorylation of STAT3 and
  transcription of STAT3-regulated genes, including SOCS3. (C) SOCS3 inhibits phosphorylation
  of STAT1 (as suggested in reference ), thus causing a downregulation of the ISG
  response. For reasons of simplicity, in this model we only show factors of relevance
  to this study. The flavivirus virion image was obtained from Protein Data Bank in
  Europe (PDBE), and the figure was created using modified Smart Servier Medical Art
  images, which are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.
