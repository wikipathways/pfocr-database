caption: A proposed model for the target and the mode of action of BML-190 in C. neoformans.
  cAMP from the cAMP/PKA pathway is important for chitosan regulation. The pathway
  can be induced by BML-190 acting through the G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr4. By
  analogy of BML-190 in the mammalian system, it is likely that it binds to Gpr4.
  The induction by BML-190 within this pathway also requires Gpa1, Cac1, and Pka1.
  Not shown are the potential interactions and cross talk with other signaling pathways,
  such as the cell integrity/PKC1/MPK1 pathway (). Pathway illustration adapted from
  the work of Kronstad et al. ().
