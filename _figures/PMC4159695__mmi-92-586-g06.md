caption: Model for multiple pathways of DSF perception and signal transduction in
  Xanthomonas campestris. DSF perception and signal transduction involving the sensor
  RpfC and response regulator RpfG act to co‐ordinately regulate the expression of
  a sub‐set of genes that include engXCA, prtA and manA, which encode extracellular
  enzymes. DSF and RpfC also regulate expression of a number of genes including XC_1766
  (encoding a transcriptional regulator) independently of RpfG, suggesting further
  signalling outputs from RpfC. The second DSF‐dependent sensor RpfS (XC_2579) regulates
  genes including XC_0107 (encoding a hypothetical protein) in a pathway that is independent
  of RpfC and RpfG. Not depicted in the current model is the sub‐set of genes co‐regulated
  by RpfC and RpfS (XC_2579). How these genes are directly regulated is currently
  under investigation.
