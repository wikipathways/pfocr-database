caption: 'Regulation of KChIP2 expression at the transcriptional level in cardiomyocytes.
  Positive regulation of KCNIP2 transcription includes: (1) members of the Krüppel-like
  factor family (KLF4 and KLF15) and (2) CREB directly binding to the promoter regions
  of the KCNIP2 gene. Negative regulation of KCNIP2 transcription includes: (1) Activation
  of TNFR, α-AR, and β-AR increases NF-κB activity and thus exerts an inhibitory effect
  on the KCNIP2 promoter. (2) Two branches of the MAPK signaling pathway are involved
  in the downregulation of KChIP2 expression: Activation of PKC phosphorylates and
  activates MEK, which in turn activates ERK. JNK can be phosphorylated and activated
  by phenylephrine (PE). Both ERK and JNK can reduce KCNIP2 mRNA levels by activating
  associated transcription factors. (3) The Ca2+-activated phosphatase calcineurin
  dephosphorylates NFAT, which then translocates to the nucleus to repress KCNIP2
  transcription. (4) The Notch1 receptor is cleaved by γ-secretase to generate NICD
  following receptor–ligand interaction. NICD then translocates to the nucleus and
  interacts with transcriptional regulators to inhibit KCNIP2 expression. CREB: cAMP
  response element-binding protein; TNFR: tumor necrosis factor receptor; α-AR: α-adrenergic
  receptor; β-AR: β-adrenergic receptor; Pro: propranolol; NF-κB: nuclear factor κB;
  IκB: NF-κB inhibitor; IKK: IκB kinase; PKC: protein kinase C; MEK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase; ERK: extracellular regulated protein kinase; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; TF: Transcription factor; NFAT: nuclear factor of activated T cells; NICD:
  intracellular domain of the Notch receptor.'
