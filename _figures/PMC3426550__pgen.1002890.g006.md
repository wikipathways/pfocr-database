caption: Cross-talk between the different pathways is illustrated by the central role
  of PI synthesis and DAG production/utilization. The arrangement of the steps in
  the Kennedy and CDP-DAG pathways for the synthesis of PC is modified from Carman
  and Han . The role of the ERMES complex in transporting PS from the ER to the mitochondria
  for conversion to PE and its return to the ER  is represented by a red box. Genes
  encoding all four components of the complex (MDM10, MDM12, MDM34 and MMM1) exhibited
  alleviating interactions when both SCS3 and YFT2 were deleted (; the alleviating
  interaction between MDM10 and the SCS3 YFT2 double deletion was identified with
  relaxed criteria, 38 pixel size difference, p = 0.006, ε = 0.18). The synthesis
  of PE and PC from lysoPE and lyso PC is omitted for clarity. The steps in the synthesis
  of inositol phosphates are modified from York . The pathway for the synthesis of
  complex sphingolipids is modified from Dickson . Steps involving genes that interact
  genetically with SCS3 and/or YFT2 show the gene name above three boxes which indicate
  the relative strength and sign of the interactions. Aggravating (green) and alleviating
  (red) interactions are ordered from left to right for the scs3 Δ, yft2 Δ and scs3
  Δ yft2 Δ strains using the values in . A colorbar shows the intensity of the interactions.
