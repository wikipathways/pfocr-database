caption: Multiple event model for B-cell lymphomagenesis. The BCR pathway as depicted
  in . Antigenic drive is considered as an initiating event (green). Mutations within
  the CD79B part of the BCR that increase the response to antigenic drive (blue).
  Activating mutations (red) and loss of function mutations (yellow) in downstream
  signal transduction components may confer antigen independent pro-survival signaling
  and are considered tertiary events. Please see text and - for details on which events
  are implicated in which types of B-cell malignancies.
