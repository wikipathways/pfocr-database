caption: Overview of the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway and DLL-4/Notch signaling pathway
  in endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) exists
  in 3 subtypes, including VEGFR-1 (encoded by FLT-1), -2 (encoded by FLK-1), and
  -3 (encoded by FLT-4), which can be activated by different vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) family ligands, and a soluble form of VEGFR-1 (sVEGFR-1) can
  be used as a potent antiangiogenic factor to sequester VEGF-A. Among all the ligands,
  the ligand VEGF-A is a major regulator of the activation of VEGFR-2 autophosphorylation.
  Downstream signaling is triggered by phosphorylated VEGFR, such as the phospholipase-Cγ
  (PLCγ) and PI3K-AKT pathways, determining cell proliferation and migration, tubule
  formation, and vascular permeability. In addition, VEGFR-2- and -3-mediated signals
  also induce the expression of delta-like ligand 4 (DLL-4) in endothelial cells to
  activate Notch signal transduction on adjacent endothelial cells. The activation
  of Notch signaling upregulates the expression of VEGFR-1 and sVEGFR-1 and downregulates
  the expression of VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), repressing the function
  of VEGFR-2, inhibiting the tip cell phenotype and inducing the stalk cell phenotype.
  The downregulation of Nrp1 relieves its inhibition on Smad2/3 and can promote the
  differentiation of endothelial cells into stalk cells. Additionally, Notch signaling
  also affects the expression of Jagged-1 in the stalk cell, which can compete with
  DLL-4 for binding to the Notch receptor and inhibit Notch signaling in tip cells.
