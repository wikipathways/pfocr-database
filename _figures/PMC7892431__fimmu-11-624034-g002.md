caption: Viral manipulation of DNA-sensing and directly antiviral signaling pathways.
  (A) Foreign DNA sensing is mediated by cGAS, IFI16 and AIM2 in the cytoplasmic compartment.
  cGAS activation leads to the production of cGAMP, which acts as a second messenger
  to induce STING activation. cGAMP binding to STING induces its dimerization and
  K63 ubiquitination by TRIM25 and TRIM56. This leads STING to interact with TBK1
  and transduce these signals via IRF3 or MAVS in order to produce type I IFNs. Moreover,
  STING can also be activated by IFI16. AIM2 sensing of cytosolic DNA results in its
  interaction with ASC, leading to the cleavage of caspase 1, the secretion of IL-1β
  and the induction of pyroptotic cell death. Foreign DNA sensing is mediated by TLR9
  in the endosomal compartment. These signals are transduced by intermediary of MYD88
  and IRF3/7 in order to produce type I IFNs, and to the expression of other genes
  such as IL-1β and NLRP3 via the NF-κB pathway. HBV has been described to impair
  DNA-sensing pathways via HBV pol-mediated alteration of K67-linked ubiquitination
  of STING, HBx-mediated degradation of AIM2 and the decrease of TLR9 expression.
  Similarly, HCV affects DNA sensing by altering TBK1/STING and MAVS/STING interaction
  via its viral protein NS4B. (B) Directly antiviral pathways are mediated by the
  action of PKR, ADAR, and OAS. PKR activation leads to the inhibition of mRNA translation
  via interference with EIF2A. HCV has been described to exploit PKR activity as a
  means to alter the translation of ISGs. OAS proteins lead to the activation of RNase
  L and the induction of RNA degradation. ADAR proteins mediate A-to-I editing, leading
  to the alteration of RNA structure, localization and coding capability.
