caption: Schematic of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways in the prefrontal
  cortex. Dark blue represents RNA changes at 24 hours, purple represents RNA changes
  at 0 hour, black dots indicate that polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid-induced mRNA
  was decreased with Amlexanox, checkered hatching represents protein increases at
  0 and 24 hours while diagonal hatching represents protein increases at 24 hours.
  Gray represents no change, and white indicates that the pathway component was not
  measured in this study. Light blue means that expression was too low to measure
  in this study [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
