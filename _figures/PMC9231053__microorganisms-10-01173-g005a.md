caption: Relative quantification of mRNA of wildtype and no.7 in SD and in SD/YNBG
  under aerobic conditions. Shown data are the relative mRNA levels normalized by
  the level of RDN18 as a housekeeping gene and by level of each gene of wildtype
  and no.7 under different media (SD and YNBG) at the exponential phase. The relative
  mRNA levels of wildtype in SD, no.7 in SD, and no.7 in YNBG are shown as blue, orange,
  and gray bars, respectively. Error bars indicate the SD of six replicate experiments
  (n = 6). The metabolic map is divided into three parts mainly including the (a)
  glucose–glycerol pathway, (b) pyruvate-ethanol pathway, and (c) TCA cycle. The same-colored
  star marks in same figures mean transcription levels of the same enzymes; same-colored
  circles marks in (a,b) mean transcription levels of the same enzymes, especially
  ALDs and ADHs.
