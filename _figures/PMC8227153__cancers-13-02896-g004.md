caption: 'Schematic presentation of the overexpressed genes and the antiviral pathways
  activated by Rintatolimod. Rintatolimod (Ampligen; dsPoly (I: C12U)) enters the
  cells and targets the TLR3 in the endosome to start a cascade of actions. A—Stimulation
  of TLR3, which activates TICAM1 and TRIF3 that are involved in innate immunity against
  pathogens. Activation of TICAM1 and MyD88 mediate NF-kB expression that subsequently
  activates transcription factors such as IRF1 and IRF7. Interferon Regulatory Factors
  activate STAT1, 2, and 3 that stimulate the innate and acquired immune responses,
  mediate cellular responses to interleukin, and regulate inflammatory responses to
  infection. B—Activation of STAT1 and 2 upregulate the expression of OAS3, which
  induces the synthesis of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate (2–5 A) from ATP upon binding of dsRNA.
  2–5 A activates RNase L, causing endonucleolytic cleavage of viral ssRNAs and blocking
  virus replication. C—TLR3 activation induces the expression of members of the IFIT
  family. The upregulation of IFIT1 and IFIT2 result in restriction of ssRNA virus
  replication in the cytosol. In addition, the IFIT family restricts virus replication
  through an alternation of protein synthesis and the ability of an antiviral protein
  to bind viral RNA directly. D—Activation of STAT 1, 2, and 3 activate the expression
  of interferon stimulatory genes (ISGs) like ISG15, which induces the antiviral state
  in the cytosol. ISG15 acts on ssRNA and directly degrades viral RNA. Treatment with
  Rintatolimod increased the expression of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, which recognize interferon
  and activate JAK/STAT signaling pathways. E—Activation of STAT signaling pathways
  leads to the production of various cytokines, which results in the activation of
  the adaptive immune system. The pathway image was created with biorender.com.'
