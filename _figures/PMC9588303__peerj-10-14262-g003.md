caption: Structural genes with an available expression profile are underlined in light
  blue. The heatmap represents the expression of corresponding structural genes in
  SR and SG, and blue to red in the heatmap indicates the expression levels of structural
  genes (FPKM value) ranging from low to high. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H,
  cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI,
  chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase;
  F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthetase; UFGT, UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase;
  LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase. Gray dotted line,
  three types of leucoanthocyanidin as the substrate of LAR; green dotted line, three
  types of anthocyanidin as the substrate of ANR; red dotted line, three types of
  anthocyanin as the product of UFGT.
