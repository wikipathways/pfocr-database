caption: A schematic illustration of the reconstructed CoA-dependent 1-butanol pathway
  in engineered Y. lipolytica strains. Enzymes involved in the CoA-dependent 1-butanol
  pathway in C. acetobutylicum are shown in parentheses. Homologous enzymes found
  in Y. lipolytica are shown in red. To construct a complete 1-butanol pathway in
  Y. lipolytica, two heterologous genes, ETR1 (from S. cerevisiae) and EutE (from
  E. coli), were introduced (shown in blue). The endogenous 1-butanol pathway enzymes
  that were overexpressed include YlACT1, YlACT2, YlHBD and YlCRT (red). YlGPD and
  YlMDH (red) were overexpressed for NADH regeneration in the engineered Y. lipolytica
  strains
