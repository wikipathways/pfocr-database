caption: Hypoxia pathway proteins–a regulatory network. Under normoxic conditions,
  PHDs 1–3 can preferentially hydroxylate HIF1α or 2α, which leads to their VHL-mediated
  degradation. FIH preferentially hydroxylates HIF1α rather than HIF2α, preventing
  necessary interaction with co-factors [,]. Additionally, LIMD1, a scaffold protein
  that helps assemble the complex with VHL [,] and numerous other regulators of PHD
  expression/activity have been described (green box—Normoxia [,,,,,,]). During hypoxia-associated
  events, including inflammation or tumor growth, HIF1 is activated (green box—Hypoxia),
  on the other hand, HIF1 supports the transcription of PHD, LIMD1, and Nitric Oxide
  synthase (NOS), which in turn inhibit HIF1 activity. HIF2 can induce the expression
  of Arginase 1, which competes with NOS for the same substrate, thus reducing NO
  production efficiency and reducing HIF1 inactivation as well [,,,,,]. HIF1α-AS2
  promotes HIF1 transcription only in the first few hours after hypoxia induction
  but subsequently inhibits HIF1 activity; in contrast, HIF1α-AS2 continues to promote
  HIF2 expression even after several hours of hypoxia [,].
