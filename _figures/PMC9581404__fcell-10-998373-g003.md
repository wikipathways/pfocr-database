caption: Proposed interaction of adherens junction proteins and Kaiso in the Wnt signaling
  pathway and epithelial barrier stability. (A) In the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin
  and p120ctn bind E-cadherin at the membrane, providing stability to E-cadherin at
  the plasma membrane. Cytosolic β-catenin is phosphorylated and targeted for degradation
  by the destruction complex. In the nucleus, Kaiso binds to the promoter region of
  target genes β-catenin (CTNNB1), E-cadherin (CDH1), Siamois and matrilysin (mmp7)
  repressing their transcription. Kaiso also binds to β-catenin, preventing its interaction
  with TCF/LEF. (B) Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway inactivates
  the destruction complex, resulting in cytosolic accumulation and nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin. Wnt signaling also triggers CK1, a component of the destruction complex,
  to phosphorylate p120ctn. Phosphorylated p120ctn then dissociates from E-cadherin
  and translocates to the nucleus where it relieves Kaiso-mediated regulation of genes.
  Reduced E-cadherin-associated p120ctn at the plasma membrane results in increased
  E-cadherin degradation, leading to defective cell adhesion and increased permeability
  in the epithelial barrier. Given that nuclear p120ctn blocks Kaiso’s DNA binding
  domain, we propose that this Wnt signal may be a potential mechanism by which p120ctn
  attenuates Kaiso-mediated regulation of its target genes promoter. Additionally,
  this may be a potential mechanism by which Wnt signaling promotes the association
  between β-catenin and TCF/LEF, alleviating Kaiso’s inhibition of this heterodimer
  formation, and thus activating Wnt target genes.
