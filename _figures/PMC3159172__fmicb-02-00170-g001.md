caption: Schematic representation of selected steps in the intracellular lifestyle
  of B. pseudomallei. B. pseudomallei can be internalized by either phagocytic or
  non-phagocytic cells. In non-phagocytic cells PilA and the adhesins BoaA and BoaB
  are critical for uptake. For the internalization step in non-phagocytic cells the
  Bsa T3SS structural proteins BipD (translocator), BsaQ (structural component), and
  BopE (effector) are required. The IrlRS two-component signal transduction system
  is predicted to regulate the expression of other key gene(s) involved in internalization.
  For internalization in phagocytic cells the Bsa T3SS putative effector BopA and
  the alternate sigma factor RpoS play minor roles. The Bsa T3SS structural proteins
  BsaZ, BsaQ, and BsaU, the translocator protein BipD and the putative effector BopA
  are critical for membrane disruption and escape from the endocytic vesicle. Once
  in the cytoplasm B. pseudomallei can replicate and move by actin-based motility
  in a BimA-dependent fashion. B. pseudomallei LPS only weakly stimulates IFN secretion,
  which results in reduced iNOS expression and NO production. Furthermore, B. pseudomallei
  induces expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and cytokine-inducible
  Src homology 2-containing (CIS) proteins which inhibit the Janus kinases – signal
  transducers and activators of transcription (JAK–STAT) signaling pathway and concomitant
  iNOS activation. Purine (PurM, PurN), histidine (HisF), and para-aminobenzoate (PabB)
  biosynthetic pathways are important for intracellular replication and survival,
  while the B. pseudomallei T6SS-1 Hcp protein, the alternate sigma factor RpoS, and
  the Bsa T3SS protein BipB are involved in stimulating cell-to-cell fusion and the
  formation of MNGC. NOD2 refers to nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
  protein 2. Green arrows are used to indicate progression of time. Red T-bar arrows
  indicate inhibitory interactions. Secretion system components are color coded with
  effectors in purple, translocators in black, and structural components in red.
