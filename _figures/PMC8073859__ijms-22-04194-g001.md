caption: 'EV in physiological and pathological processes. (A) EV and coagulation:
  EV enriched in phosphatidylserine (PS) and tissue factor (TF) can promote the activation
  of the coagulation cascade as well as platelet aggregation. (B) EV and endothelial
  activation: EV can modulate vasodilatation and vasoconstriction by activating endothelial
  cells, releasing cytokines, reducing nitric oxide (NO) production and increasing
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. (C) EV and angiogenesis: EV can modulate
  angiogenesis by increasing ROS production, downregulating the VEGF pathway, modulating
  the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells and matrix degradation. This
