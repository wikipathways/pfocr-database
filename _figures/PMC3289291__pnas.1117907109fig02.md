caption: Functional characterization of the alternative photosynthetic pathways involved
  in ATP/NADPH balancing and photoenergy dissipation. The LEF pathway (PSII, PQ pool,
  CytBF, PSI, and FNR), the ATPase, and the Calvin cycle are shown in green. The final
  products from LEF and photophosphorylation [reduced ferrodoxin (Fdrd), NADPH, and
  ATP] are shown in blue. The high and low light-yield pathways and their electron
  donors are shown with red and yellow boxes, respectively. Furthermore, the alternative
  pathways were color-coded based as shown based on their contribution to the ATP/NADPH
  ratio, the mechanism of dissipation, and by dependence on O2 availability.
