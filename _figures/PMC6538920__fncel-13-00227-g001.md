caption: 'Wnt signaling pathways. (A) Canonical Wnt/ß-catenin pathway OFF: In the
  absence of Wnt binding to Frizzled (Fz) receptors and LRP5/6 co-receptors, ß-catenin
  interacts with the destruction complex (CK1, GSK3β, Axin1 and APC), resulting in
  its phosphorylation by Gsk3ß and CK1 and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome.
  (B) Canonical Wnt/ß-catenin pathway ON: When a Wnt ligand binds to LRP5/6 and Fz
  receptors, the scaffold protein Disheveled (Dvl) recruits Axin1 and the kinases
  CK1 and GSK3ß to the membrane, disrupting the destruction complex and impairing
  ß-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. ß-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm
  and subsequently translocates to the nucleus, where it acts as an activator of TCF/LEF-mediated
  transcription of Wnt target genes. (C) The Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway: The
  PCP does not require LRP5/6 and is ß-catenin-independent. When Wnts bind to Fz receptors,
  Dvl is activated, resulting in increased activation of ROCK and JNK through the
  small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, respectively. Changes in ROCK activity induce actin
  remodeling, and JNK activation can promote gene transcription via Jun phosphorylation.
  The palmitate group in Wnt ligands is indicated as a yellow tail. CK1, casein kinase
  1; GSK3ß, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; Axin1, axis inhibition protein 1; APC, adenomatous
  polyposis coli; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphocyte-enhancer-binding factor; Rock,
  Rho associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1; RhoA, RAS homolog gene-family
  member A; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase.'
