caption: Schematic illustration of the key metabolic pathways. Glucose enters the
  cell via glucose transporters and enters the glycolytic pathway. Hexokinase 2 (HK2)
  converts glucose into glucose 6‐phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Glycolysis generates
  pyruvate from glucose with the help of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). This process generates
  energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate is then either converted
  to lactate and secreted out of the cell or decarboxylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase
  and converted to acetyl CoA, which enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The
  TCA cycle generates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), flavin adenine dinucleotide
  (FADH2) to feed into the electron transport chain (ETC), which produces 36 molecules
  of ATP. Glycolysis also feeds into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to produce
  ribose, NADPH and amino acids. Amino acid metabolism can also feed into the TCA
  cycle to drive ATP production by the ETC. TCA intermediate citrate drives fatty
  acid synthesis while fatty acid oxidation drives TCA cycle further by generating
  acetyl CoA.
