caption: 'Known relationships between the candidate genes. Candidate genes are shown
  in red if they have only output connections. The ratio of input and output connections
  determines how thin they are. Completely white genes have only input connections.
  The network of candidate genes was expanded by fetching genes 1 step downstream.
  The downstream genes are shown in gray. Nodes that share all their connections and
  properties were combined in order to reduce the complexity of the graph. The joint
  nodes are labeled with group# and the participating entities are as follows: group1
  = ACTB, ACTG1; group2 = cell–cell adhesion, phosphorylation; group3 = cellular protein
  metabolic process, lipid storage, lipid transport, lipoprotein metabolic process,
  low-density lipoprotein particle receptor biosynthetic process, macrophage derived
  foam cell differentiation; group4 = cysteine-type endopeptidase activity, interleukin-12
  production, macrophage activation, T cell mediated immune response to tumor cell;
  group5 = DYNC1H1, DYNC1I1, DYNC1I2, DYNC1LI1, DYNC1LI2, DYNC2H1; group6 = epidermal
  growth factor receptor signaling pathway, nerve growth factor receptor signaling
  pathway; group7 = innate immune response, interferon-alpha production, interleukin-10
  production; group8 = interferon-gamma production, interleukin-6 production; group9
  = LAMA1, LAMA2, LAMA3, LAMA4, LAMA5, LAMB2, LAMB3, LAMB4, LAMC2, LAMC3; group10
  = osteoblast proliferation, phagocytosis; group11 = RP11-631M21.2, TUBB1, TUBB2A,
  TUBB2B, TUBB3, TUBB4, TUBB4Q, TUBB6; group12 = TUBB, TUBB2C. Green and blue borders
  refer to up and down regulated genes, respectively. Light gray is used to emphasize
  stably expressed genes. Known regulations are shown with bold borders whereas the
  predictions are kept thin. (For interpretation of the references to color in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)'
