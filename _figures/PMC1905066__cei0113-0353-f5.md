caption: Diagrammatic sketch of the effects of CRP and mannan-binding lectin (MBL)
  on complement activation, indicating the classical pathway (thin solid line), alternative
  pathway (dotted line) and lectin pathway (heavy solid line); arrows other than the
  directional indicators from CRP indicate enzymatic cleavages. CRP activates the
  classical pathway via C1q, but inhibits the alternative pathway by enhancing the
  interaction between H and C3b, displacing B from C3b and increasing inactivation
  of C3b by I. This latter effect predominates during complement activation by both
  MBL and CRP, and hence CRP inhibits C-dependent lysis initiated by MBL via the lectin
  pathway. It is not yet clear whether a divalent cation (e.g. Mg2+) is required for
  interactions of MBL with the MASP-1 and MASP-2 (M1 and M2).
