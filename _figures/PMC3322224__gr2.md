caption: cAMP Signaling CascadeLigand binding (represented in this example by PTH,
  but other ligands and receptors can stimulate cAMP synthesis), activates Gs-α and
  stimulates cAMP synthesis by adenylate cyclase. The binding of cAMP by PRKAR1A,
  the cAMP-dependent regulatory subunit, leads to the dissociation and activation
  of PKA and the subsequent phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding (CREB),
  nuclear translocation, and expression of downstream genes. PDE4D phosphodiesterase
  activity modulates cAMP levels. Mutations (indicated by asterisks) in the genes
  encoding these three components of the pathway result in a spectrum of clinically
  related disorders— acrodysostosis for mutations in PDE4D or PRKAR1A or Albright
  hereditary osteodystrophy for mutations in GNAS, the gene encoding Gs-α.
