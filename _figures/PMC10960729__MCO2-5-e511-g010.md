caption: Activation of cGAS–STING signaling pathway in autoimmune diseases, neurological
  diseases, and visceral inflammations. Mutations in nucleases such as TREX1 (Three‐prime repair exonuclease),
  DNaseII (Deoxyribonuclease II), and RNaseH2 (Ribonuclease H2) lead to accumulation
  and exposure of self‐DNA in the cytoplasm, resulting in autoimmune diseases such
  as AGS (Aicardi‐Goutières syndrome), SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), FLE (familial
  lupus erythematosus), and RVCL (retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy)
  (bottom left). Similarly, the activation of cGAS–STING signaling pathway in different
  causes leads to neurological diseases (top left), such as AGS, amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), ataxia‐telangiectasia (A‐T), Alzheimer's
  disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and visceral
  inflammations (right), such as inflammation in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, and
  intestinal tract. ALD, alcoholic liver disease; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary
  disease; NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; PF, pulmonary fibrosis
