caption: Brown adipocyte regulation by exogenous agents. Thyroid hormones act on thermogenesis
  through interaction with their Thyroid receptors (TR) and the G-protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR). TRα promotes an increase in adrenergic signaling while TRβ acts
  to stimulate uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). β3 receptor (β3-AR) is expressed constitutively
  on the surface of the adipocyte and acts to regulate the transcription and activation
  of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis, brown adipocyte differentiation, and
  lipid storage. This receptor can be activated through cold, which is the main mechanism
  for activating browning, agonist drugs, or diet. Chronic exposure to cold and food
  intake, such as curcumin and fish oil, promotes thermogenesis by releasing catecholamines
  from the central nervous system (CNS) that bind to β-AR, thus initiating a signaling
  cascade. An increase in the concentration of cAMP is elicited which consequently
  leads to the enhanced activity of protein kinase A (PKA) which promotes the cAMP-response
  element-binding protein (CREB). This pathway is related to the transcription of
  thermogenic genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ),
  Type II iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), Peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and Cell death-inducing
  DNA fragmentation factor-like effector A (CIDEA). The other dietary components can
  participate in the induction of browning through the modulation of the gut microbiota
  promoting the increase of the expression of thermogenic genes. The release of growth
  factor 21 (FGF21) is mediated by the practice of physical exercises and physiological
  changes. FGF21 will interact with its FGFR receptor and that activation induces
  a self-phosphorylation of the FGFR that mediates the activation of pathways related
  to increased expression of UCP1
