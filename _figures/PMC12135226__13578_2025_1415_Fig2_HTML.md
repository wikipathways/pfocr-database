caption: 'Regulation of lactylation. A: GLUT3 overexpression significantly decreased
  levels of LDHA, L-lactic acid, H3 K9, H3 K18, and H3 K56. When the glycolysis pathway
  is over-activated and too much lactic acid is produced, the activity of the upstream
  enzyme ALDOA will be inhibited by lactylation, inhibiting glycolysis. NUSAP1 up-regulated
  LDHA promoted lactylation and inhibited the protein degradation of NUSAP1. HIF-1α
  lactate modifies HIF-1α protein, while HIF-1α promotes glucose uptake and glycolysis.
  B: EP300 inhibited histone lactylation and down-regulated YTHDF2 expression. CBP
  inhibits lactylation at MRE11 K673. p300/CBP promotes the lactylation of HMGB1.
  Histone deacetylase SIRT2 inhibits the lactylation of METTL16. SIRT3 inhibits the
  lactylation of cyclin CCNE2. SIRT6 acts as a cancer suppressor by regulating lactate
  production'
