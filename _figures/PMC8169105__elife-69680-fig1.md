caption: The enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (orange) is dispersed throughout the membrane
  of the endoplasmic reticulum (brown) in the presence of ample glucose (left), but
  it moves to a contact site between the cell nucleus and a lysosome-like organelle
  called the vacuole (green) in response to glucose deprivation (center). This nucleus-vacuole
  junction depends on two tether proteins, Vac8 (blue) and Nvj1 (red). The partitioning
  of HMG-CoA reductase to the contact site results in increased flux through the mevalonate
  pathway (right), and growth advantages once glucose becomes available again.
