caption: Hypothetical pathway related to the disease pathogenesis process. The hypothetical
  pathway may include down‐regulated RB1 and TP53 and up‐regulated MYC, which together
  repress the activation of CDKN1A. This further prevents cell cycle arrest and apoptosis,
  in turns driving COPD towards SQCC. Meanwhile, the down‐regulated RB1 hardly promotes
  cell cycle progress
