caption: Type-17 cells (i.e., αβ T-cells, γδ T-cells, ILCs) produce IL-17A and IL-17F
  homodimers as well as an IL-17AF heterodimer. The relative signaling activity of
  these cytokines is IL-17A>IL-17AF>IL-17F. These cytokines signal through a heterodimeric
  receptor of IL-17RA and IL-17RC. Biologics targeting this pathway [and others targeting
  IL-12p40 or IL-23p19 upstream of Th17 development (not depicted)] are in clinical
  use. Inborn errors of IL-17 immunity (IL-17RA, IL-17RC, ACT1/TRAF3IP2, IL-17F) result
  in CMC. Other CMC-manifesting monogenic diseases include AD-HIES due to dominant-negative
  mutations in STAT3, gain-of-function mutations in STAT1, and inherited deficiencies
  in JNK1, DOCK8, ZNF341, CARD9, IL-12βR1, IL-12p40, and RORC. These patients manifest
  varying degrees of decreased peripheral blood Th17 cells and/or impaired secretion
  of type-17 cytokines by peripheral blood T-cells. Signaling by IL-17 on responsive
  (primarily non-hematopoietic) cells mediates immunity to mucosal candidiasis through
  induction of antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil-recruiting cytokines and chemokines.
  IL-22, which is also produced by type-17 cells (i.e., αβ T-cells, γδ T-cells, ILCs),
  binds to its heterodimeric receptor of IL-22R1 and IL-10RB and promotes regenerative
  signals to replenish the IL-17RA-expressing oral suprabasal epithelial layer. There
  are no inborn errors of IL-22 immunity underlying CMC, and patients with loss-of-function
  mutations in the IL-22 receptor subunit IL10RB, whose cells do not respond to IL-22,
  do not manifest CMC. ILCs, innate lymphoid cells; CMC, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis;
  AD-HIES, autosomal-dominant hyper-IgE syndrome; TRAF3IP2, TRAF3 interacting protein
  2; JNK1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1; CARD9, Caspase recruitment domain-containing
  protein 9; RORC, RAR related orphan receptor C; DOCK8, dedicator of cytokinesis
  8; ZNF341, zinc finger protein 341; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.
