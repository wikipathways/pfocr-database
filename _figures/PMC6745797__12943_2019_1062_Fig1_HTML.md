caption: 'A major hallmark of immunosuppression in the TME through diverse pathways
  in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. EGFR-mutant tumor cells may upregulate CD73, convert ATP to
  ADO, which binds with subtypes of ADO receptors, and upregulate expression of Tregs
  by bypassing ADO, mediating tumor cell metastasis and proliferation. Abundant ADO
  exerts immunosuppressive activity on a variety of immune cells. It promotes activation
  of Tregs and accumulation of MDSCs, further attenuating antitumor function in NK
  and DC activity, skews Mφ polarization toward M2 macrophages and inhibits the Teff-mediated
  antitumor response, mediating tumor immunity escape. EGFR-TKIs alter immune profiles
  through the following pathways: enhancing expression of MHC (Fig. ); promoting Foxp3
  degradation to attenuate the inhibitory function of Tregs; reducing infiltration
  of Tregs in the TME and inhibiting tumor growth; and enhancing Teff-mediated antitumor
  activity, reducing T cell apoptosis, inhibiting M2-like polarization of macrophages
  and increasing levels of IL-10 and CCL2. CCL2 binds to its receptor CCR2 to act
  as a chemokine ligand, playing a critical role in the migration of MDSCs to the
  TME. In addition, CCL2 can upregulate and activate the STAT3 pathway of MDSCs. STAT3
  further mediates the amplification and activation of MDSCs. MDSCs exert antitumor
  immunosuppressive actions, such as producing immunosuppressive molecules, inhibiting
  antitumor functions, inducing T cell apoptosis, and upregulating Tregs. However,
  EGFR-TKIs have a dynamic effect on the tumor immune microenvironment and modify
  the TME in several ways. AREG might regulate the efficiency of Treg-mediated immune
  modulation via the EGFR/GSK-3β/Foxp3 axis. GSK-3β-phosphorylated Foxp3 induces subsequent
  ubiquitination and degradation of Foxp3. Furthermore, loss of Foxp3 protein expression
  may be linked to impaired function of Tregs by affecting Foxp3 protein stability
  and its ability to bind to gene promoters. Exosomal PD-L1 suppresses T cell activity
  in draining lymph nodes (in mouse models). STAT3: signal transducer and transcriptional
