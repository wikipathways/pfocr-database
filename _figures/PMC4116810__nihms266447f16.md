caption: Expanding our scope from isolated alkenes to aromatic π-systems we discovered
  that LPdIVCl4 complex 7·Cl− produced aromatic and benzylic chlorination products
  and we found evidence for the interaction of LPdIVCl3+ intermediate B with aromatic
  substrates reminiscent of Pathway 3b for the chlorination of alkenes (). Chlorinations
  of aromatic substrates by 7·Cl− both on the ring as well in benzylic positions (if
  available) were possible with electron rich substrates (, entries 7,8,10,11) while
  xylene (entry 9) was inert even at 60 °C. This is consistent with an electrophilic
  delivery of Cl+ by B. In line with this is the observed regioselectivity in the
  chlorination of 4-methylanisole in its 2- and 4-position (entry 11) consistent with
  the reported reactivity of this substrate in electrophilic chlorinations., Equally,
  we propose that benzylic chlorinations in entries 6, 7, and 8 are a consequence
  of initial Cl+-delivery to the aromatic ring by B similar to the benzylic chlorination
  mechanism proposed Baciocchi and Illuminati for highly methylated arenes. For example,
  in the reaction of 7·Cl− with durene the initially formed intermediate B would electrophilically
  deliver Cl− to the α- and the β-position of the π-system to form F and G (). While
  F then produces the ring chlorination product, G undergoes a Baciocchi-Illuminati
  sequence including deprotonation and 1,5-Cl-shift from H to form the benzylic chlorination
  product. The observed biases for aromatic over benzylic chlorination products in
  entry 7 (aromatic/benzylic = 3.5:1) and entry 8 (aromatic/benzylic = 12:1) compare
  reasonably well with those found in previously reported electrophilic chlorinations
  of durene (aromatic/benzylic = 5.9:1) and mesitylene with quantitative aromatic
  substitution.
