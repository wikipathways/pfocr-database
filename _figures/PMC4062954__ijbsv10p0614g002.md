caption: Inactivation of the PTEN/FOXO1 pathway promotes aberrant activation of the
  AR in prostate cancer. Left, in PTEN positive PCa cells, AKT is inactivated and
  FOXO1 cannot be phosphorylated by AKT. As a result, the unphosphorylated FOXO1 remains
  in the nucleus and binds directly to the TAU5 domain of AR, thereby inhibiting androgen-dependent
  and independent activation of the AR. Right, in PTEN-inactivated PCa cells, activation
  of AKT leads to FOXO1 phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion, which permits the interaction
  of AR with coactivators including p160 family proteins such as p160 and p300, thereby
  favoring androgen-dependent and independent activation of the AR in PCa cells.
