caption: A schematic depicting the role of TLR4-NFkB-Caspase-11 signaling pathway
  in METH-induced astrocyte-related neuroinflammation. Briefly, TLR4 expression is
  increased following METH treatment. Increased TLR4 upregulates the expression of
  Myd88 and TRIF. The Myd88-dependent and Myd88-independent pathways upregulate the
  expression of transcription factor NF-κB. Then NF-κB elevates Caspase-11 expression,
  which mediates the inflammasome NLRP3 pathway by upregulating the expression of
  Caspase-1 and ASC. The increased NLRP3 inflammasomes induce the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines IL-1β and IL-18.
