caption: Signaling model of the IL6R-ADAR1-STAT3 interplay in multiple myeloma. (A)
  High levels of IL6 in multiple myeloma (MM) cells within the bone marrow microenvironment
  leads to persistent activation of the STAT3 pathway. Activated STAT3 (phosphorylated
  at Y705 by JAK) will drive the transcription of its target genes, including ADAR1-P150.
  P150 shuttles in and out of nucleus. Cytoplasmic P150 in turn regulates STAT3 activity
  in a positive feedback loop by forming a physical interaction with STAT3, resulting
  in protein stabilization of the latter. More STAT3 can therefore be translocated
  into the nucleus for its transcriptional function, leading to a cascade of oncogenicity
  deriving from the actions of its downstream targets. (B) 1q21 amplification leads
  to high expression of both IL6R and ADAR1. Cells with high expression of IL6R are
  highly sensitized to IL6 stimulation, leading to a constitutive activation of the
  STAT3 pathway. High expression of ADAR1-P150 mediates STAT3 activity in a feedback
  loop, as described in (A), causing hyperactivation of the STAT3 pathway. Convergence
  of mechanisms from concomitant high expression of both IL6R and ADAR1 culminates
  in enhanced survival of MM cell survival, potentially contributing to the poor disease
  prognosis in patients with 1q21 amplification.
