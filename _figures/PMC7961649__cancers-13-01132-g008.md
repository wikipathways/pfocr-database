caption: FASN enables HER2-driven breast cancer resistance to tamoxifen. The stimulatory
  effects of estradiol on FASN expression can be blunted by anti-estrogens in endocrine-responsive
  ER-positive/HER2- negative breast cancer cells (left). In ER positive/HER2- positive
  breast cancer cells, however, an AKT/MAPK-related constitutive hyperactivation of
  FASN expression becomes unaltered in response to estradiol and could be further
  enhanced by tamoxifen (right). FASN pro-survival signaling is co-opted by HER2 pathway
  activation to enable breast cancer resistance to tamoxifen. FASN inhibitors may
  be clinically relevant to countering resistance to tamoxifen in luminal B-like,
  ER+/HER2+ breast carcinomas. Created with BioRender.com and Mindthegraph.com.
