caption: 'GSL biosynthesis pathways. Left panel: ceramide (Cer) can be acylated (acyl-Cer),
  phosphorylated (Cer-1-phosphate), or conveyed to the TGN for the synthesis of sphingomyelin
  (SM). Alternatively, Cer is glycosylated for the synthesis of the GSL precursors,
  glucosylceramide (GlcCer) or galactosylceramide (GalCer) along the secretory pathway.
  GalCer is then processed for the production of sulfatides. Right panel: GlcCer is
  galactosylated to lactosylceramide (LacCer), which serves as a common precursor
  for the different GSL series: globo (red), ganglio (green), asialo (blue) and lacto
  (purple). Glycosphingolipid-synthetizing enzymes catalyzing the major synthetic
  reactions are shown in dark orange. Reproduced with permission from The Journal
