  In the endogenous pathway, Plasmodium can synthesize dihydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate
  de novo from dihydropteroate, pABA and glutamate moieties. Antifolate drugs (e.g.
  sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine) act by competitive binding to enzymes involved in this
  synthetic pathway. Thus DHPS is competitively inhibited by sulfadoxine and dapsone,
  whereas DHFR is competitively inhibited by pyrimethamine, proguanil and trimethoprim
  (red arrows). This antifolate activity results in inhibition of folate synthesis
  and, ultimately, reduced synthesis of thymidylate and parasite DNA. Ingested folic
  acid enters the circulation when ingested in high doses (dashed blue line). The
  parasite can access circulating folic acid and convert it through DHFR to dihydrofolate
  and tetrahydrofolate. By utilising the exogenous folic acid as a source of folates,
  the parasite can bypass the inhibition of the endogenous pathway and thus antagonise
  the activity of antifolate drugs. In theory, 5‐methyl‐THF is a methyl donor in the
  methionine cycle (lower cycle, with metabolites in green), resulting in the production
  of tetrahydrofolate and methionine (blue dotted lines). Recent evidence from an
  in vitro study suggests, however, that this pathway is not effectively utilised
  in Plasmodium, either because 5‐methyl‐THF monoglutamate from the erythrocytic pool
  cannot cross the membranes of the parasitophorous vacuole and the parasite (blue
  dotted line, with question mark) or because the parasite does not need methionine,
  because it derives this amino acid precursor of S‐adenosylmethionine from haemoglobin
