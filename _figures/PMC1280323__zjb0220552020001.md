caption: A model to explain how starvation for different nutrients regulates RpoS
  by different mechanisms. The rpoS mRNA is translated at low levels due to its 5′
  untranslated region forming a hairpin structure and occluding the Shine-Dalgarno
  sequence. Translation of the message is significantly enhanced in an Hfq-dependent
  manner in response to perceived phosphorus limitation, presumably by binding of
  a heretofore-uncharacterized small RNA. This causes significant increase in RpoS
  protein levels, though the protein is not as stable as it is under carbon starvation.
  Carbon starvation inhibits SprE (RssB)-mediated degradation of RpoS through the
  ClpXP protease. This leads to accumulation of highly stable RpoS protein. Nitrogen
  starvation shows only a modest increase in RpoS levels during starvation, so it
  is expected that its primary effect on RpoS regulation is at the level of activity,
  since RpoS plays an important role under nitrogen starvation. By influencing different
  elements of the pathway, each starvation signal activates RpoS regardless of the
  status—starvation level or excess—of the other nutrients. Thus, the signals act
  independently and do not interfere with each other.
