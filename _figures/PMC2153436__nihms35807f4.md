caption: Expression of genes contributing to the Immune Response (top) and Cell Cycle
  (bottom) GO processes at 4 wks of treatment (see  and 4) was visualized as networks
  using Pathway Studio software. Interactions among gene products include regulation
  (gray line) and induction of expression (blue line). Nodes shaded green are down-regulated
  and red nodes are up-regulated genes as compared to time/strain-matched control,
  and gray nodes are molecular mediators that were either not measured on the array
  or did not contribute to this GO analysis. No information regarding gene interactions
  was available using Pathway Studio for nodes that are not connected with arrows.
