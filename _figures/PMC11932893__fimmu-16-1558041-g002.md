caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of AMPK-regulated lipid metabolism. Lipid synthesis
  inhibition is achieved through three key pathways (1): Direct phosphorylation of
  ACC inhibits its activity, reducing the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA,
  thereby suppressing the key step of de novo fatty acid synthesis (2); Dual inhibition
  of SREBP transcription factors through direct phosphorylation and mTORC1-dependent
  mechanisms, where SREBP-1c mainly regulates fatty acid synthesis-related genes (acc,
  fasn), and SREBP-2 specifically regulates cholesterol synthesis-related genes (hmgcr,
  hmgcs, fdps, sqs) (3); AMPK-mediated mTORC1 activity inhibition works synergistically
  with direct SREBP phosphorylation to effectively block the transcriptional activation
  of lipid synthesis-related genes. Lipid catabolism is regulated through two major
  pathways. AMPK inhibits ACC to reduce malonyl-CoA levels, relieving its inhibition
  on CPT1 and promoting fatty acid transport into mitochondria for β-oxidation. Additionally,
  AMPK promotes lipid breakdown through regulation of lipophagy, specifically by (1):
  Direct phosphorylation of ULK1 to initiate autophagosome formation (2); Inhibition
  of mTORC1 through phosphorylation of TSC2 or Raptor, relieving its phosphorylation-mediated
  inhibition of ULK1 and enhancing AMPK-ULK1 interaction (3); Promotion of TFEB nuclear
  localization through the TXNIP-mTORC1-TFEB axis, enhancing the transcription of
  autophagy-related genes and fatty acid oxidation genes, while improving inflammation
  and promoting lysosomal biogenesis, thereby strengthening lipophagy-mediated lipid
  droplet degradation'
