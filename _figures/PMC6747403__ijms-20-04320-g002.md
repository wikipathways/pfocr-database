caption: Mechanisms of action of immunomodulating agents. (A) CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathway
  blockade. CTLA-4 blockade allows activation and proliferation of tumor-specific
  T cells and reduces Treg-mediated immunosuppression. PD-1 pathway blockade reestablishes
  the activity of quiescent tumor-specific T cells and stimulates T cell migration
  and proliferation. (B) To generate DC cancer vaccines, DCs are harvested from patients
  by leukapheresis, maturated ex vivo and, in some cases, loaded with tumor antigens
  before reinfusion into patients. At TME and lymph node levels, DCs present tumor
  antigens to tumor-specific T cells, resulting in T cell activation and expansion.
  (C) CAR T cells carry modularly constructed fusion receptors that recognize specific
  antigen on cancer cells; upon binding, the intracellular signaling domains induce
  signal transduction cascades stimulating antitumor T cell activities. CTLA-4, cytotoxic
  T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4; DC, dendritic cell; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; PD-1, programmed death 1; PD-L1, programmed death ligand 1; TCR, T-cell
  receptor; TAA, Tumor associated Antigen.
