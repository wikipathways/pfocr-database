caption: Potential islet GPCRs and their downstream signaling pathways. Both GPR40
  and GPR120 are activated by long-chain FAs (LC-FA) and couple to Gαq/11. GPR41 and
  GPR43 are activated by short-chain FAs (SC-FA). GPR41 couples to Gαi, whereas GPR43
  couples to both Gαq/11 and Gαi. GPR119 is activated by the long-chain FA derivatives
  oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and lysophophatidylcholine (LPC) and couples to Gαs. Activation
  of the Gαq/11pathway leads to stimulation of phospholipase C, generation of inositol-3-phosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), and mobilization of Ca++ from endoplasmic reticulum
  stores. This will contribute to the release of insulin granules either directly
  or partly through subsequent activation of protein kinase c (PKC). Activation of
  Gs stimulates adenylate cyclase (AC) and increases cAMP levels leading to an increase
  in insulin secretion. On the other hand, activation of Gαi proteins causes inhibition
  of AC and a decrease in cAMP levels.
