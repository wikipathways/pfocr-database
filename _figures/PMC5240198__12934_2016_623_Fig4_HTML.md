caption: Superpathway of methionine and SAM biosynthesis, with known transcriptional
  regulatory constraints indicated. Many genes involved in methionine biosynthesis
  and active, ATP-dependent uptake are part of the MetJ regulon and are thus subject
  to strong negative regulation (repression) by the eponymous ligand-responsive transcription
  factor MetJ (red) in presence of its cognate ligand SAM. Furthermore, the endogenous
  transcriptional activator of methionine synthase known as MetR (green) is repressed
  by MetJ:SAM, further attenuating methionine and SAM accumulation through de-activation
  of a critical node in the methionine biosynthetic pathway
