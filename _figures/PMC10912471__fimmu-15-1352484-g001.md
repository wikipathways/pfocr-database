caption: Schematic representation of Notch signaling pathway. The newly translated
  Notch receptor undergoes protein folding and glycosylation in endoplasmic reticulum.
  The cleavage of Notch receptor by furin-like protease at S1 occurs in the Golgi
  apparatus, leading to the biogenesis of mature Notch receptor. It is then transported
  to the cell membrane as a heterodimer. Notch ligands from signal-sending cells bind
  to the Notch receptor of signal-receiving cells. Endocytosis and membrane trafficking
  coordinate the availability of ligands and receptors on the cell surface. Ligand
  endocytosis may also produce mechanical force to induce structural changes in the
  bound Notch receptor. This conformational alteration exposes S2 in Notch for sequential
  cleavages by ADAM, generating a membrane-anchored Notch extracellular truncation
  fragment (NEXT). γ-Secretase cleaves the Notch transmembrane domain in NEXT at S3,
  finally releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the cell membrane.
  γ-Secretase-mediated cleavage can occur at the cell surface or in the endosome.
  NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds to RBPJ, MAML and other proteins to form
  a NTC that facilitates the transcription of many genes (e.g., HES and HEY). In the
  absence of NICD, RBPJ may associate with corepressor proteins to suppress target
  gene transcription. NICD binding may induce allosteric changes in RBPJ that causes
  displacement of transcriptional repressors. The transcriptional activator MAML recognizes
  the NICD/RBPJ interface, following which other coactivators are recruited to activate
  transcription of downstream target genes. Jag1/2, Jagged1/2; Dll1/3/4, Delta-like
