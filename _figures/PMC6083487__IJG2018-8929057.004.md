caption: Cyclins and cell cycle regulation is the top pathway downregulated by citalopram
  treatment. This figure represents the cyclins and cell cycle regulation pathway
  as the top signaling pathway downregulated with a significant p value (p value = 1.98E − 02)
  due to citalopram treatment. IPA identifies this pathway as it involves differentially
  methylated genes from our dataset like cyclin B, HDAC, and P2A that are upregulated
  (red) and cyclin D1 and Dp1 that are downregulated (green). The color intensity
  is proportional to the extremity of upregulation or downregulation.
