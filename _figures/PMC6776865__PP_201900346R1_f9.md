caption: Schematic model of phosphorylation-state–mediated NRT1.1 vesicle cycling
  and nitrate-dependent signal response for LR development. Blue solid arrows represent
  the direction of endocytosis and pink solid arrows represent the direction of secretion
  or recycling; Blue solid arrows over the PM represent more activity of NRT1.1 that
  moves down each branch through the indicated pathway. Arrowheads on the black lines
  represent activation and the vertical crossbars at the ends of lines represent inhibition.
  Dotted lines indicate attenuated responses in LN compared with HN. LN conditions
  (0.2 mm of NO3–). HN conditions (10 mm of NO3–).
