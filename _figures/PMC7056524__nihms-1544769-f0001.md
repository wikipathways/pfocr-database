caption: 'In normal B cells, Mir-15/16 target Bcl2. BAC and BAD can activate apoptosis.
  ROR1 is not expressed thus Wnt5a cannot activate the proliferation pathway (A).
  In leukemic cells, lack of miR-15/16 is the cause of Bcl2 overexpression that leads
  to apoptosis inhibition. ROR1 is expressed in the surface of leukemic cells thus
  wnt5a activates the proliferation pathway (B). Therapeutic implication of combined
  treatment with Venetoclax, that targets Bcl2 and Cirmtuzumab that binds to ROR1:
  the antiapoptotic pathway is initiated and the cell proliferation pathway is inhibited
  (C).'
