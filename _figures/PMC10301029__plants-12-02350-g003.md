caption: The EMT transition pathway. The initiation of endothelial to mesenchymal
  transition is required for the spread and invasion of cancer as well as angiogenesis,
  which is required for the growth of tumors. The EMT pathway can be activated by
  multiple receptor tyrosine kinases as well as through Wnt, integrin, and inflammation
  signals. The end result is the activation of what is known as EMT transcription
  factors (TFs), which lead to the transcription and expression of a multitude of
  genes that are involved in the EMT process
