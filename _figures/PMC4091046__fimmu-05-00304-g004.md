caption: Intervention in pathophysiological conditions by modulating the adenosine-A2AR
  pathway. Enhancement of the adenosine-mediated immunosuppression can be done by
  directly stimulating A2AR using agonists or by increasing adenosine levels using
  CD39/73 inducer or inhibitors of nucleoside transporter, adenosine deaminase, and
  adenosine kinase. This treatment should alleviate various inflammatory disorders.
  Conversely, weakened adenosine-dependent immunosuppression is expected to enhance
  anti-pathogen immune response. This modulation will be possible by inhibiting extracellular
  adenosine production (CD39/73 inhibitor), by enhancing adenosine degradation (adenosine
  deaminase), or by blocking adenosine binding to A2AR (antagonists).
