caption: Extrahepatic organ-specific networks associated with NAFLD. Adipose tissue
  produces adipokines that inhibit hepatic steatosis, inhibit hepatic inflammatory
  injury, and increase insulin sensitivity through “the hepatic-fatty axis”, “hepatic-fatty-cerebral
  axis”, and “hepatic-fatty-skeletal muscle axis”, which may be a form of feedback
  regulation. The brain receives metabolism-related signals from external organs (adipose
  tissue, gastrointestinal tract, etc.), to improve impaired NAFLD via food intake,
  energy expenditure, and biological clock pathways. The gastrointestinal tract influences
  extrahepatic organs such as the brain and pancreas to inhibit the development of
  NAFLD by releasing intestinal hormones with associated peptide metabolism, while
  gut microbes have a similar effect by altering short-chain fatty acids and bile
  acids. The endocrine pancreas improves insulin resistance and inhibits steatosis
  through the “hepatic-alpha-cell axis”, and “hepatic-β-cells axis”. Exercise-induced
  skeletal muscle production of myokines and metabolites promotes white fat burning
  in extrahepatic adipose tissue and inhibits intrahepatic lipogenesis, inhibiting
  the progression of NAFLD. Bone metabolism produces bone factors that affect hepatic
  steatosis, hepatitis, and liver fibrosis through the “liver-bone axis”, and with
  the change in bone density, the development of NAFLD will also be affected. SCN,
