caption: The role of TRIB2 in the physiological proliferation of granulosa cells,
  myoblasts, naive T cells, and thymocytes, and pathological proliferation of VSMCs.
  (A) HCG promotes granulosa cell proliferation by reducing the phosphorylation of
  ERK1/2 and p38MAPK by inhibiting TRIB2. (B) MiR-100-5p enhances myoblast proliferation
  by targeting TRIB2 and inhibits differentiation by the TRIB2/mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling
  pathway. (C) ThPOK and RUNX3 respectively upregulate and downregulate TRIB2 expression,
  with TRIB2 inhibiting AKT activity in CD4+T cells, while its absence promotes cell
  proliferation in CD8+T cells. (D) Knockout of TRIB2 increases the proliferation
  of developing thymocytes, and after the 5-FU intervention, the cells gradually regain
  and enhance their proliferative capacity over time. (E) PDGF-BB induces TRIB2 expression
  through the ROS/ERK/EGR1 signaling pathway, subsequently promoting VSMC proliferation.
