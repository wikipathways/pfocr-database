caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanisms underlying therapeutic effect of
  cajaninstilbene acid (CSA) against APAP-induced liver injury. APAP overdose causes
  accumulation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) predominantly via CYP2E1.
  Excess NAPQI depletes GSH, leading to the sustained activation of JNK-Sab-ROS loop
  and mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by a loss of efficiency in the electron
  transport chain (ETC) and reductions in the synthesis of ATP. This ultimately results
  into hepatocyte cell death, which triggers the innate immune system. To maintain
  intracellular homeostasis, a highly conserved stress-inducible metabolic protein
  Sestrin2 is activated to stimulate AMPK-mediated mitochondrial quality control and
  repress ROS. CSA upregulated Sestrin2/AMPK signaling pathway, leading to enhanced
  mitochondrial quality control, thereby protects against APAP-induced liver injury.
