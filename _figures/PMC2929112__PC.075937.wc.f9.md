caption: Model for Nitrogen Control of Virulence Functions in F. oxysporum through
  TOR and MeaB.The preferred nitrogen source ammonium represses virulence functions
  via Gln synthetase (GS), the protein kinase TOR, the bZIP protein MeaB, and the
  GATA factor AreA. Positive and negative regulators of virulence functions are indicated
  in green and red, respectively. Thick lines indicate results based on genetic or
  pharmacological evidence, and thin lines indicate results based on expression analysis.
  Dashed lines indicate interactions inferred from S. cerevisiae and A. nidulans.
  Ammonium depletion, MSX, or rapamycin leads to inactivation of TOR and/or MeaB,
  thus promoting virulence functions. TOR mediates repression of nitrogen catabolic
  genes and virulence functions both by MeaB-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
  AreA has a dual role as an activator of nitrogen catabolic genes and as a repressor
  of virulence functions. The MAPK Fmk1 and the downstream homeodomain transcription
  factor Ste12 are required for activation of virulence functions through a positive
  regulatory pathway. Ammonium represses Ste12 expression through MeaB and AreA. A
  possible role of the nitrogen repression pathway upstream of Fmk1 (dotted line)
  cannot be excluded.
