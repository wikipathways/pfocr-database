caption: 'Time course of labelled [U‐13C6] glucose (A), 13 C labelled lactate (B),
  13 C labelled succinate (C), 13 C labelled ethanol (D), 13 C labelled acetate (E),
  13 C labelled propionate (F), and 13 C labelled butyrate (G) in the CEF and OCP
  tests; and the metabolic pathways of labelled glucose 13C fermentation during the
  operative days (H): metabolic pathway day 0 and 1 (1‐H); metabolic pathway day 2
  (2‐H); metabolic pathway day 4 (3‐H); metabolic pathway day 7 (4‐H); metabolic pathway
  day 9 and 16 (5‐H); metabolic pathway day 11 until 14 (6‐H). (Numbers 1, 2, and
  3 represent the formate dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, and ethanol dehydrogenase;
  respectively). The concentration of labelled compounds refers to the sum of all
  isotopomers which have been detected. For each isotopomer the red and white circles
  refer to the labelled (13C) and non‐labelled (12C) carbon, respectively'
