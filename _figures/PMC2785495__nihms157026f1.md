caption: NHEJ repairs DSB through an error prone mechanism available at any point
  during the cell cycle. As opposed to HR, NHEJ is less likely to lead to gross chromosomal
  rearrangements. a.) UV and IR are known to induce hnRNP A2/B1 protein which has
  been proposed to inhibit DNA-PK (). b.) hnRNP C is phosphorylated by a complex of
  DNA-PK and Ku proteins when it is bound to RNA transcript; the effect on NHEJ is
  unknown (, ). c.) The canonical NHEJ pathway is shown repairing a DSB beginning
  with DNA-PK and Ku protein binding, followed by Rad50 homologue (Rad50), Nirbrin
  (Nbs1), and meiotic recombination 11 homologue (Mre11) recruitment, displaced by
  X-ray repair in Chinese hamster cells 4 protein (XRCC4) which recruits DNA-Ligase
  IV culminating in the rejoining of the broken DNA strands ()(, , ).
