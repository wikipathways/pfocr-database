caption: The Notch signaling pathway and its inhibitors. Notch signaling (left panel,
  separated by stapled line) is activated upon ligand (Delta or Jagged) binding to
  an adjacent Notch receptor on a neighboring cell. Upon activation, Notch receptors
  are cleaved, first by ADAM, in the NRR of the extracellular domain (S2 cleavage).
  The released extracellular domain (NECD) is then trans-endocytosed by the ligand-expressing
  cell. The second cleavage (S3 cleavage) is mediated by the γ-secretase (GS) complex,
  which releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into the cytoplasm, thus allowing
  its activation and nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, NICD binds to the transcription
  factor CSL family proteins and the Mastermind (MAM)-like transcriptional co-activator
  1. The assemble of this transcription activation complex on the recombination signal-binding
  protein for immunoglobulin kappa J (RBP-J) promoter region, leads to the expression
  of various downstream target genes. Two main Notch-interfering strategies (right
  panel) exists; monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the ligands and/or receptors
  (target-specific blockade) and GS inhibitors (GSI, pan-Notch blockade). While mAbs
  may block specific ligand-induced S2 cleavage and consecutively trans-endocytosis
  of NECD, GSI strategies will non-specifically block NICD release following all ligand-receptor
  interactions. The figure was made in BioRender (https://biorender.com).
