caption: Hypothesized model for actions of the cAMP-Epac-Rap1 signaling pathway at
  neuronal gap junctions. The c-terminus PDZ domain ligand of Cx36 within different
  connexon hexamers are shown associating with ZO-1 and AF6. Association of ZO-1 and
  AF6 with each other is envisioned to result in clustering of connexons and maintenance
  of gap junction plaque integrity. Upon cAMP activation of the guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor (GEF) Epac, which acts on Rap1, Rap1 may be targeted to AF6, where
  it may either further stabilize junctions or disrupt ZO-1/AF6 association, resulting
  in untethering of a portion of connexons within a gap junction plaque and internalization
  of these connexons. SynGAP is shown because it is a GTPase activating protein (GAP)
  for Rap1 and is known to associate with MUPP1 at other subcellular locations, but
  as yet, neither Rap1 nor SynGAP has been examined for its presence at neuronal gap
  junctions
