caption: Functions of p12 and p8. In the ER, p12 is proteolytically cleaved at the
  amino terminus to generate p8, which traffics to the cell surface through the secretory
  pathway. (1) In the ER, p12 mediates Ca2+ release, which enables (2) either calcineurin
  binding of NFAT and subsequent dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and upregulation
  of the IL-2 gene, or p12 binding to calcineurin and inhibition of NFAT activation.
  (3) Upon trafficking through the secretory pathway, p8 localizes at the immunological
  synapse where it interacts with LAT and inhibits proximal TCR signaling. (4) In
  the ER, p12 binds the immature heavy chains of the MHC-I and prevents their interactions
  with the β2-microglobulin, leading MHC-I degradation by the proteosome. (5) At the
  cell surface, p8 increases the clustering of LFA-1 and the formation of intracellular
  conduits and facilitates viral transmission to target cells.
