caption: Prolonged mechanical loading beyond physiological levels on tenocytes, increases
  the expression of IL-1β and CCL2. CCL2 attracts monocytes to loading site. Monocytes
  differentiate into M1 macrophages, which release TNF-α and IL-6. These pro-inflammatory
  cytokines activate downstream signaling pathways that result in tenocyte apoptosis.
  TNF-α binds and activates its receptor which activates TRAF leading to necrosis,
  and the Fas/FasL pathway which is known to upregulate the caspases 3, 8 and 9. IL-6
  binds its receptor and activates cytochrome C which leads to the formation of an
  apoptosome through activation of Apaf-1.
