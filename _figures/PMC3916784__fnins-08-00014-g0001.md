caption: Schematic model of the central autonomic thermoregulatory pathway and neurotransmitters
  regulating brown adipose tissue (BAT). Cool and warm cutaneous thermal sensory receptors
  excite primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia which relay thermal information
  to second-order thermal sensory neurons in the dorsal horn (DH). Cool and warm sensory
  neurons in DH release glutamate to activate third-order sensory neurons in the external
  lateral (LPBel) and dorsal (LPBd) subnuclei, respectively, of the lateral parabrachial
  nucleus. Thermal signals for involuntary thermoregulatory responses are transmitted
  from the LPB to the preoptic area (POA) which contains a population of BAT-regulating,
  GABAergic, warm-sensitive (W-S) neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPA) that project
  to inhibit glutamatergic, BAT sympathoexcitatory neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus
  and dorsal hypothalamic area (DMH-DA). In the median preoptic (MnPO) subnucleus,
  we postulate that GABAergic interneurons, activated by cool-activated neurons in
  LPBel, inhibit W-S neurons, while excitatory interneurons, excited by warm-activated
  neurons in LPBd, excite W-S neurons. Prostaglandin (PG) E2 binds to EP3 receptors
  to inhibit the activity of W-S neurons in the POA. The activity of BAT sympathoexcitatory
  neurons in the DMH-DA, determined by the balance of a glutamatergic excitation of
  unknown origin and a GABAergic inhibition from W-S POA neurons, excites BAT sympathetic
  premotor neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla, including the rostral raphe
  pallidus (rRPa) and parapyramidal area (PaPy), that project to BAT sympathetic preganglionic
  neurons (SPN) in the spinal intermediolateral nucleus (IML). Some BAT premotor neurons
  can release glutamate (GLU) to excite BAT SPNs and increase BAT sympathetic nerve
  activity, while others can release serotonin (5-HT) to interact with 5-HT1A receptors,
  potentially on inhibitory interneurons in the IML, to increase the BAT sympathetic
  outflow, and thermogenesis. Regions with modulatory inputs to the thermoregulatory
  pathway include the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) which exerts an inhibitory
  influence on BAT thermogenesis. Orexinergic neurons in the perifornical lateral
  hypothalamus (PeF-LH) project to the rRPa to increase the excitability of BAT sympathetic
  premotor neurons. Activation of neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) or in
  the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) produces an inhibition of BAT thermogenesis.
  Norepinephrine (NE) release from the rRPa terminals of VLM catecholaminergic neurons
  contributes to the VLM-evoked BAT sympathoinhibition via alpha 2 adrenergic receptors
  on BAT sympathetic premotor neurons. VGLUT3, vesicular glutamate transporter 3.
