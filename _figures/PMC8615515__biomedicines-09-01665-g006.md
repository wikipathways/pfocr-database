caption: 'Modulation of ATR/Chk1 cell signaling pathway by AOX1 antioxidant formulation
  in BEAS-2B cells. ATR is activated by carcinogen-induced DNA damage and phosphorylates
  Chk1. The activation of ATR/Chk1 also initiates the DNA repair mechanism through
  p53/BRCA1/γ-H2AX signaling, which improves the HR repair mechanism. Abbreviations:
  AOX1: antioxidant formulation-1, ATM: Ataxia telangiectasia mutated, ATR: ATM-Rad3-related,
  Chk: checkpoint kinases, BRCA1: breast cancer gene 1, HR: homologous recombination,
  p53: tumor suppressor, ?: further studies are needed.'
