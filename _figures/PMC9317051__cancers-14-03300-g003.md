caption: BCR::ABL1-dependent/independent pathways and drugs showing their targets
  for their BCR::ABL1-independent expression/activation to be used in combination
  with TKIs. Dark arrow indicates activation, dotted line indicates inhibition by
  inhibitor/s and encircled p indicates phosphorylation. The mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway (also known as rat sarcoma virus (RAS)/rapidly accelerated
  fibrosarcoma (RAF)/mitogen-activated kinase kinases (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK)), PhosphatidylInositol-3-Kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) and Janus Tyrosine Kinase (JAK), and signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) pathways are the major BCR::ABL1-downstream pathways responsible for BCR::ABL1-independent
  TKI resistance when re-activated by alternate routes. BCR::ABL1 can mediate the
  inhibition of the tumour-suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and activation
  of β-catenin to promote leukaemia, but this can also occur independently from BCR::ABL1.
  Leukaemic cells can also use JAK1/STAT3, Wnt signalling, the sonic hedgehog pathway,
  and the expression of the epigenetic modulator EZH2 to remain quiescent, which could
  contribute to resistance and relapse []. These pathways could be targeted by using
  inhibitors/activators that were developed for other diseases and could be repurposed
  for a combination treatment with TKIs to treat Ph+ leukaemias. Figure created in
