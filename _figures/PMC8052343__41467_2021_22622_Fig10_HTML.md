caption: An illustration of an embryo at ES 13 (left) and an enlargement of a dying
  PGC (right), featuring the molecular model of PGC death. Purple arrows indicate
  translocations from one cellular compartment to another, while black arrows indicate
  signaling. PGCs that remain in the midline experience high somatic Wunens (LPP)
  activity, which may induce LMP and the release of lysosomal hydrolases, including
  DNase II, CathB and CathL (See the Discussion for more details about a possible
  link between the Wunens and LMP). The release of CathB, L from the lysosomes might
  promote the initial release of AIF from the mitochondria as was reported (dashed
  arrow). AIF then, together with CypA, promotes the translocation of DNase II to
  the nucleus, presumably as a CypA-AIF-DNase II complex. In the nucleus, DNase II
  cleaves the DNA, leading to PARP-1 activation, which in turn generates PAR. PAR
  modifies proteins both in and outside the nucleus, activating the DDR and promoting
  massive release of AIF from the mitochondria, respectively. This positive feedback
  amplification loop between DNase II and PARP-1 (mediated by AIF and PAR, respectively),
  activates the ATR/Chk1 branch of the DDR (presumably to a critical threshold), ultimately
  leading to PGC death.
