caption: 'cAMP cascades and cAMP-dependent synaptic plasticity in the MF synapse.
  (A) Cascades of activation of cAMP, PKA, and Epac2 in the MF terminal. A train of
  action potentials arriving at the MF synapse triggers a calcium influx through voltage-dependent
  calcium channels and subsequent activation of CaM that activates cAMP synthesis
  by AC1. AC1 acts on PKA or Epac2 to up regulate synaptic transmission (dashed green
  arrows between vesicles). Application of FSK activates both AC1 and AC2 and elevates
  cAMP. AC2 is also activated by PKC following the activation by a G-coupled protein.
  Application of DCG-IV, an agonist to mGluR2/3, leads to inhibition of AC1. Green
  arrows: activation, red arrow: inhibition, blue arrows: application of pharmacological
  reagents. (B) Downstream PKA cascades and their relation to synaptic plasticity.
  PKA activity is dependent on the anchoring protein AKAP7, and is inhibited by the
  negative regulator PKAα. PKA, in turn, phosphorylates multiple proteins including
  synapsin, rabphilin, tomosyn-1, synaptotagmin12 (Syt12) and RIM1a. Of these, deletion
  of synapsin and rabphilin does not impair MF synaptic plasticity. Ablation of RAB3A,
  although not a direct PKA target, and RIM1a abolishes MF-LTP but does not affect
  STP and FSK-induced potentiation (FIP). Synaptotagmin-12 KO abolishes MF-LTP and
  impairs FSK-induced potentiation but do not affect STP, while deletion of tomosyn-1
  abolishes MF-LTP, impairs FSK-induced potentiation and also affects STP. Epac2 manipulation
  also abolishes LTP and impairs FSK-induced potentiation. STP- short-term potentiation,
  LTP- long-term potentiation, FIP- FSK-induced potentiation. Orange arrow represent
  PKA-independent pathway, Green arrows shades represent different pathways.'
