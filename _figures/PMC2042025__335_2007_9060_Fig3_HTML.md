caption: The Notch pathway is a frequent target of insertion. Members of the Notch
  signaling pathway were identified repeatedly as candidate oncogenes. Shaded boxes
  indicate genes with proximal insertions. Arrows represent direct or indirect effects
  that occur in one or more hematopoietic cell types. These associations are not necessarily
  occurring contemporaneously or in the same cell type
papertitle: Retroviral insertions in the VISION database identify molecular pathways
  in mouse lymphoid leukemia and lymphoma.
