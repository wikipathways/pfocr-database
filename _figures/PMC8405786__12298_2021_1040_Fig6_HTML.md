caption: Overview of predicted secondary metabolic pathway of putative AaTPSs based
  on mapping with the KEGG database and characterized TPS genes in Aquilaria plant
  species a. Representation of the possible involvement of predicted terpene synthases
  in the biosynthesis of terpenes in A. agallochum. b. Characterized terpene synthases
  in Aquilaria plant species to date. AaTPSa3 showed the highest sequence similarity
  of 98.30% to delta-guaiene synthase characterized from cultured cells of Aquilaria
  crassna
