caption: Schematic of the reticuline biosynthetic pathway engineered in E. coli. Reticuline
  is synthesized from simple carbon sources (i.e., glucose or sucrose) via the sequential
  action of enzymes dTH2, DODC, MAO, NCS, 6OMT, CNMT, and 4′OMT. As an efflux transporter
  of reticuline, AtDTX1 was introduced in this reticuline-producing E. coli strain.
