caption: This diagram shows the classic signaling pathway (mediated by the membrane-bound
  form of IL-6 receptor, mIL6R) which is believed to be the anti-inflammatory one
  and the trans-signaling pathway (mediated by the soluble form of IL-6 receptor,
  sIL6-R) which is believed to be the pro-inflammatory one. Tocilizumab inhibits both
  of them, SGP130Fc inhibits only the trans-signaling pathway.
