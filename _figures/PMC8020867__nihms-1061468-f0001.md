caption: Map of net odds () for reactions of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle. Values next to each reaction name indicate the net flux through the
  reaction, and two flux values are provided for each reaction. The first value (left)
  is the flux after maximum entropy optimization. The second value (right) is the
  flux after the same optimization but including regulation at PFK (by ATP) and PDHm
  (by acetyl-CoA). Reaction and metabolite abbreviations are derived from the BiGG
  database []; full common names are provided as  and . The metabolic pathway visualizations
  here and in  were created with Escher [].
