caption: Signaling pathway and inhibitors of inflammasomes. The priming of the inflammasome
  is initiated by the recognition of a PAMP or DAMP, which mediates the activation
  of NF-κB. The activation of NF-κB induces the production of NLRP3 and the generation
  of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. After deubiquitination and combination with mtDNA, NLRP3
  interacts with ASC and caspase-1, forming the inflammasome complex. The inflammasome
  is activated by the recognition of P2X7R, leading to the cleavage of caspase-1.
  Active caspase-1 then promotes the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, which is the key
  to inducing inflammasome-dependent inflammation. Inflammasome inhibitors target
  the upstream and downstream molecules in the inflammasome signaling pathway. Arrows
  denote an activating effect, and blunted lines denote targets inhibited by selective
  compounds
