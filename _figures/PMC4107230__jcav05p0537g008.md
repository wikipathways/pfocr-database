caption: Different mechanisms of signaling for EMT which might be induced by FGF10.
  FGF10 has a direct effect on its expression, followed by TGF-β up regulation. FGF10
  may have inducing effect on EMT through Ras/MAPK and AKT/Pi3K/mTOR pathways. Another
  finding has shown that WNT signaling activity though GSK3β phosphorylation leads
  to βCatenin (βCat) localization into the nucleus and Lef/TCF activation. Also GSK3β
  phosphorylation (inactivation) leads to stabilization of Smad 3 and sensitivity
  of cells to TGF-β which induces another way of EMT through TGF-β/Smad pathway.
