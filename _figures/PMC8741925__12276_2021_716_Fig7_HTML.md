caption: Mechanical stress dampens the CR, resulting in IDD through the Rho/ROCK pathway.
  Excessive mechanical loading on IVDs influenced the cytoskeleton of the NP cells
  and activated the Rho/Rock pathway, by which the CR of the NP cells was disrupted.
  This disruption affected the balanced synthesis and degradation of the ECM and resulted
  in the destruction of the NP cell structures, a decrease in the T2-weighted signal
  and a decline in DHI, leading to IDD.
