caption: (A) Two types of iron signals, tissue iron and circulating iron, can be sensed
  via distinct mechanisms to activate the bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-SMAD pathway
  and increase hepcidin production. Increases in tissue iron (via uptake of transferrin-bound
  iron [2Fe-Tf] and nontransferrin bound iron [NTBI]) are sensed by liver sinusoidal
  endothelial cells (LSEC), at least in part through increased mitochondrial reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), which activates nuclear factor erythroid–related factor 2
  (NRF2) to upregulate Bmp6 transcription. Bmp2 expression is also induced by tissue
  iron loading, albeit to a lesser extent, although the mechanism is unknown. Secreted
  BMP6 and BMP2 act together, most likely as a heterodimer (BMP2/6), to bind to BMP
  receptor complexes on the hepatocyte membrane containing 2 type I receptors (ALK3
  homodimers or ALK2/3 heterodimers), 2 type II receptors (ACVR2A and/or BMPR2), and
  co-receptor hemojuvelin (HJV). Neogenin (NEO) interacts with BMP/HJV receptor complex
  to facilitate complex formation and localization. The activated BMP/HJV receptor
  complex phosphorylates SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8 proteins (SMAD1/5/8), which bind
  to SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus to bind BMP response elements (BRE) in hepcidin
  (HAMP) promoter, thereby inducing transcription. Circulating 2Fe-Tf binds to transferrin
  receptor 2 (TFR2) and transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) on hepatocytes, thereby stabilizing
  TFR2, displacing HFE from TFR1, and favoring an interaction between HFE and TFR2,
  which enhance SMAD1/5/8 signaling and hepcidin production, possibly via a physical
  interaction with the HJV/BMP receptor complex. Inhibitory SMAD7 and SMAD6 are induced
  by iron-mediated BMP signaling as a negative feedback inhibitor to prevent excessive
  increases of SMAD1/5/8 signaling and hepcidin. (B) In iron deficiency, BMP2/6 ligand
  production is reduced, HFE is sequestered by TFR1, TFR2 is degraded, and TMPRSS6
  and furin cleave HJV from the membrane surface, thereby suppressing BMP-SMAD signaling
  and hepcidin production. Furin-cleaved soluble HJV (sHJV) may also inhibit this
  pathway by sequestering BMP ligands from activating the BMP receptor complex. FK506-Binding
  Protein 1A (FKBP12) interacting with ALK2 also plays an inhibitory role in BMP-SMAD
  signaling and hepcidin regulation.
