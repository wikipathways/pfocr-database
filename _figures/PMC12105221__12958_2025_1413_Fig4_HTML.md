caption: How BPA contributes to the development of endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial
  cancer and infertility through DNA methylation alterations [12, 100]. Intrauterine
  BPA exposure altered the global CpG methylation profile of the uterine epigenome
  and subsequent gene expression, preferentially affecting the expression of ER-binding
  genes (upregulating Tgfβ, Scd1, Ret and downregulating Fbln2, Muc1, and Lcn2). Here,
  ERα binding genes had lower levels of methylation than did all other genes. BPA
  up-regulated the expression of estrogen by activating the FGF and p-ERK1/2 signaling
  pathways. On the other hand, it also increased the methylation of the promoter CpG
  island of the progesterone target HAND2, via a mechanism associated with increased
  uterine expression of several methylation-related factors, including DNA methyltransferases
  Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b and methylated DNA binding protein Mbd2. Hypermethylation led to
  the silencing expression of HAND2, thereby down-regulated progesterone expression.
