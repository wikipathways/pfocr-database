caption: High levels of ID proteins inhibit transcriptional activation of the RAP1GAP
  gene by bHLH transcription factors in GICs. The balance of the RAP1-GTPase is shifted
  toward active RAP1-GTP that activates integrin signaling and anchorage of glioma
  cells to the tumor endothelium. Loss of ID activity derepresses bHLH-mediated activation
  of Rap1GAP expression, with inhibition of RAP1-GTPase and relative accumulation
  of RAP1 as RAP1-GDP. Loss of RAP1-GTP results in the release of GICs from the perivascular
  space, with ensuing loss of stem and tumor-initiating capacity.
