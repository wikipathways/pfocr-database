caption: Examples of stress regulators in E. coli. General stress response. (a) In
  response to oxidative stress, RpoS occurs in direct regulation by binding to RNA
  polymerase (RNAP) and recognizes the promoter thus allowing expression of katG and
  katE catalase and peroxidase expression. Likewise, in response to low pH, binding
  of RpoS to RNAP induces expression of the transcriptional regulator, gadX. (b) Under
  nutrient limitation, RpoS is indirectly regulated by the transcription factor DskA
  or by the alarmone ppGpp (orange circle) that leads to the augmentation of the anti-adaptor
  IraP and releases RpoS to activate stress gene expression. Nutrient stress. (c)
  Under nutrient deficient conditions, a mis-regulation of cAMP signaling for nutrient
  availability allows binding of cAMP to the cAMP Receptor Protein (CRP) which activates
  the protein and specific binding with target DNA sequences regulating the expression
  of genes involved in acid stress (gadX) or in oxidative stress (oxyR). (d) In nutrient
  deprivation, exogenous leucine (pink circle) influences the Lrp regulon and modulates
  Lrp directly. Presence of leucine concentrations represses the transcription of
  the ilvH promoter whereas in the absence of leucine, ilvH is directly activated
  by Lrp. Inversely, leucine releases Lrp to bind to the sdaA promoter and activates
  its expression. Oxidative stress. (e) In response to oxidative stress due to excess
  levels of prooxidants (H2O2, O2, OH), depending on whether the stress is mediated,
  bacteria respond by two regulatory systems, the peroxide regulon (OxyR) or the superoxide
  regulon (SoxR/S). OxyR activates genes involved in catalase and peroxidase expression
  (katE and katG). When oxidized, the sensor SoxR activates soxS transcription resulting
  in expression of superoxide dismutase (sodA and sodB). Envelope stress. (f) The
  two-component system consists of the inner membrane, the sensor histidine kinase
  (CpxA) and the cytoplasmic response regulator CpxR. Envelope stress conditions lead
  to phosphorylation of CpxA which transfers the phosphate group to CpxR. Phosphorylated
  CpxR-P functions as a transcriptional regulator which controls the expression of
  numerous genes including some virulence factors. Heat shock. (g) In a simple pathway,
  during temperature upshift (30 째C to 42 째C), the Heat Shock Response (HSR) is induced
  by the increase of RpoH levels, primarily due to an enhanced translation of rpoH
  mRNA and stabilization of the protein. The elevated temperature disturbs protein
  homeostasis and induces accumulation of misfolded proteins. Chaperones DnaK and
  GroEL/S which are proteins helping to activate or degrade RpoH and regulate heat
  shock gene transcription.
