caption: In single-celled beings, nutrients are utilized when available for proliferative
  metabolism and when nutrients are limiting cells undertake a fundamentally different,
  starvation metabolism. In animals, some cells are in an anabolic and proliferative
  state because of strong growth factor signaling and licensure to take up excess
  nutrients, while some cells are in a catabolic and quiescent state owing to survival
  signaling with limiting nutrient uptake. Each state has feed-forward and feedback
  self-reinforcement and inhibits the processes of the other side. Consequently, perturbation
  of a subcomponent of one state topples that state and results in a switch to the
  other sate. Therefore, cells tend to be in equilibrium in one or the other state.
  For a non-dividing cell such a macrophage, phenotypic switching into inflammatory
  and non-inflammatory behavior is driven by anabolic versus catabolic signaling,
  respectively. For regenerative paradigms such as lymphocytes or epithelial replacement,
  anabolism and catabolism drive differentiation and self-renewal, respectively. The
  metabolic states appear deterministic of the cell fates because of interdependency
  in their signaling pathways. For example, lymphocyte self-renewal is wired into
  the PI3K pathway because FoxO1 maintains expression of key cell identity genes.
  Conversely, IRF4 drives lymphocyte differentiation because it plays an obligatory
  role in aerobic glycolysis and the anabolic switch required for proliferation and
  differentiation. Blue hexagons represent nutrients and blue transmembrane brackets
  represent nutrient transporters.
