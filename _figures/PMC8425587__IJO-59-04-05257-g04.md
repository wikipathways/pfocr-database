caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of SQSTM1/p62 in regulating lung cancer. Nickel exposure
  may cause SQSTM1/p62 degradation through the mTOR/ULK1/Beclin1 pathway, and it upregulates
  p62 expression by stimulating the TNF/NF-κB/SQSTM1/p62 positive feedback loop. Additionally,
  when exposed to different drugs, such as cisplatin, arsenic, cadmium, isodeoxyelephantopin
  and TLR4, SQSTM1/p62 expression is observed to be increased in lung cancer cells,
  where it may directly interact with TRAF6, KEAP1, Beclin1 and ECSIT through its
  TB and KIR domains to form two distinct positive feedback loops: SQSTM1/p62/TRAF6/mTORC1/NF-κB
  and SQSTM1/p62/KEAP1/NRF2. These feedback loops promote the expression of SQSTM1/p62,
  HO-1 and BCL2/BCL-xL. Therefore, the end result of the combined effects of these
  positive feedback loops with SQSTM1/p62 at their core is the promotion of lung cancer
  cell proliferation, malignant transformation and chemoresistance. TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6; TB, TRAF6-binding domain; KIR, KEAP1-interacting region; ECSIT, evolutionarily
  conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathways; SQSTM1, sequestosome 1; ULK1,
  Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; KEAP1, Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1; HO-1, heme oxygenase 1.'
