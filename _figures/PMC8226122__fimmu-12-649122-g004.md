caption: Interplays among coagulation, fibrinolysis, complement pathways, and inflammation.
  FXIIa and plasmin activate C1r to initiate the classical pathway. In addition to
  kallikrein, FXIa, FXa, FIXa, thrombin, and plasmin cleave C3 and C5 to generate
  C3a and C5a. Importantly, kallikrein, thrombin, and plasmin are able to directly
  activate C3, and thrombin can generate C5a without the participation of C3. TAFIa
  is the only molecule that blocks C3a and C5a. MASP2 and MAC (not shown in the figure)
  cleave prothrombin into thrombin. C3a generates platelet procoagulant microparticles
  and induce platelet aggregation. C5a expresses tissue factor and PAI-1 on neutrophils
  and mast cells, respectively through C5aR, and inhibits the antithrombin-mediated
  anticoagulation pathway through the shedding of glycocalyx heparan sulfate. Complex
  formation between C4bBP and protein S impairs the functional property of protein
  S, a cofactor of protein C, resulting in a decrease in the conversion of protein
  C to activated protein C. C5a finally induces inflammation via inflammatory cells
  through C5aR and C5L2. These mutual actions of the serine protease network contribute
  to inflammation and thrombus formation at the site of infection, if the infection
  is sufficiently severe, disseminating to the systemic circulation, and DIC associated
  with SIRS ensues. C5aR, C5a receptor; C5L2, C5-like receptor2; C4bBP, C4b binding
  protein; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; MAC, membrane attack complex;
  MASP, mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease 2; PAI-1, plasminogen activator
  inhibitor-1; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SIRS,
  systemic inflammatory response syndrome; TAFIa, activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis
  inhibitor. Red arrows indicate activation and green lines with circle-head indicate
  inhibition.
