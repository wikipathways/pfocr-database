caption: Glucose metabolism in astrocytes. (A) Glucose is transported from the blood
  brain barrier (BBB) to astrocytes and neurons through glucose transporters (GLUTs)
  and phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). G6P enters different pathways,
  such as glycolysis, the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle, the pentose-phosphate
  pathway (PPP), and the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. (B) In the PPP, G6P catalyzes
  ribulose-5-phosphate (R5P), converting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADP) + to NADPH at the same time. Concurrently, R5P can also be converted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), the latter of which can isomerize back to G6P. (C)
  The astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttles provide energy for neuron activity. Lactate
  is transferred from astrocytes into neurons through monocarboxylic acid transporters
  (MCTs) and is converted to pyruvate to generate ATP in mitochondria. (D) The oxidative
  phosphorylation pathway in astrocytes converts G6P to pyruvate, which undergoes
  oxidative decarboxylation to form acetyl-CoA and then enters the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle to generate ATP in mitochondria. MPC1, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier
  1; HK, hexokinase; GP, glycogen phosphorylase; LDH1, lactate dehydrogenase 1.
