caption: Under physiological conditions, Cdc2 phosphorylates Ubc9 at a basal level.
  In cancer and conditions of increased oxidative stress (which occurs when hepatic
  SAMe level is reduced), expression of Ubc9 and Cdc2 is increased leading to higher
  phospho-Ubc9 level and increased Ubc9 stability, resulting in increased protein
  sumoylation. This pathway can be disrupted by SAMe or MTA treatment, which can inhibit
  Cdc2 at the mRNA level to lower Cdc2-mediated Ubc9 phosphorylation, resulting in
  reduced Ubc9 protein level and protein sumoylation.
