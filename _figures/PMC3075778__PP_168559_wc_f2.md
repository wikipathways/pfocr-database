caption: Rubisco-independent carbon assimilation. C4-glyoxalate (MOG) cycle—a model-developed
  hypothetical carbon fixation pathway. This pathway uses the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase (PEPCase) to fix atmospheric CO2 into oxaloacetate and the only output
  product of this cycle is glyoxalate. PPDK, Pyruvate phosphate dikinase; MDH, malate
  dehydrogenase. The arrows in blue are speculative routes for carbon that may be
  need to be engineered to maintain the MOG cycle in addition to linking with a partial
  C3cycle to provide the intermediates for biosynthesis of isoprenoids (G-3-P), shikimate
  (E-4-P), Suc (G-3-P), starch (Fru-6-P), and nucleotides (R-5-P). Adapted from .
