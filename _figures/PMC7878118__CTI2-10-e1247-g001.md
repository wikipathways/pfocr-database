caption: NLRP3 inflammasome signalling cascade. This cascade is separated into three
  stages, which are transcriptional priming, post‐translational modification, and
  activation. During the transcriptional priming stage, PAMPs or DAMPs bind to TLR
  or TNF induce the first signal, which subsequently initiates the NF‐ᴋB/MAPK signalling
  pathway that upregulates NLRP3, pro‐IL‐1β and pro‐IL‐18. In parallel, the first
  signal also triggers JNK‐mediated ASC phosphorylation and LUBAC‐mediated NLRP3 ubiquitination,
  which are essential for post‐translational modification of the NLRP3 receptor. The
  third activation stage is initiated when there is K+ efflux, mitochondrial stress
  or lysosomal damage occurs in the cytoplasm. These events generate another signal
  that activates the primed NLRP3 receptor, which then initiates NLRP3 inflammasome
  complex assembly. The inflammasome complex then promotes the conversion of inactive
  caspase‐1 to active caspase‐1, which then cleaves pro‐IL‐1β and pro‐IL‐18 into active
  IL‐1β and IL‐18. Both IL‐1β and IL‐18 then initiate inflammation. ASC, Apoptosis‐associated
