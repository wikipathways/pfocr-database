caption: Proposed differentiation pathway of ER+, PR+ breast cancers from ER−, PR−
  stem cells, and the reversal induced by progestins. Data in support of this pathway
  are reported in Refs. , , and . All cells are CD44+, CD24−/low (not shown). Tumors
  are also ER+, but PR, the targets of progestins, are mainly shown for simplicity.
  Without stimulating proliferation, both progesterone and MPA reactivate CK5 in ER+,
  PR+ cells within 24 h especially in young, germinal tumors. Restoration of steroid
  receptors to CK5+ stem-like cells does not require hormones. Mitogenic effects of
  estrogens occur in later stages of these pathways after cells have acquired ER and
  PR.
