caption: 'Cell-signaling pathways from the UPR to autophagy and ER stress-induced
  apoptosis. Conditions of ER stress where unfolded or misfolded proteins build up
  cause GRP78 to release three major ER stress sensors on the ER membrane: PERK, ATF6,
  and IRE1, which are then activated. Upon release from GRP78, IRE1 oligomerizes,
  autophosphorylates, and processes XBP1 mRNA to produce an active transcription factor,
  spliced XBP1 (sXBP1). sXBP1 activates stress-inducible genes involved in protein
  folding and protein degradation, including the genes ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like
  protein (EDEM), protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), and X box-binding protein 1
  (XBP1). Active ATF6 translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression of genes
  with ER response elements in their promoters, including CHOP and XBP1. Activated
  PERK dimerizes and autophosphorylates itself. Activated PERK phosphorylates and
  inactivates eIF2α, which suppresses global cap-dependent mRNA translation, but activates
  ATF4 translation. ATF4 translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription
  of genes for amino acid metabolism, redox reactions, CHOP, and GADD34. These responses
  reduce the unfolded protein load in the ER by reducing the global protein synthesis,
  by increasing the folding capacity of the ER and by removing misfolded proteins
  from the ER. Largely through the two pathways of the UPR, the PERK-eIF2α and IRE1-TRAF2-JNK
  pathways, ER stressors can induce autophagy (orange arrow). Activation of the PERK-eIF2α
  axis of the UPR pathways was shown to upregulate Atg12, convert LC3-I to LC3-II,
  and subsequently facilitate autophagosome formation. Activated IRE1α can recruit
  tumor-necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and apoptosis-signal
  regulating kinase (ASK1), subsequently activating JNK. Severe ER stress leads to
  activation of JNK that downregulates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 by phosphorylating
  Bcl-2 on the mitochondrial and ER membrane. JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2
  releases Beclin1 from its inhibitory interaction with Bcl-2 at ER membrane. Freed
  Beclin1 induces autophagy through the formation of hVPS34 complexes. The first step
  of autophagy (induction) is activated by ULK complex composed of ULK1, Atg13, FIP200,
  and Atg20. The nucleation step is mediated by a complex involving VPS34 (also known
  as PI3KCIII) with either Beclin1-Atg14L-VPS34-p150 or Beclin1-UVRAG-VPS34-p150.
  The elongation of the phagophore is mediated by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems
  that together promote the assembly of the Atg5-Atg12-Atg16L complex and the processing
  of LC3. The lipidated form of LC3-I (LC3-II) is attached to both faces of the phagophore
  membrane. ER stress can induce apoptosis through an intrinsic pathway involving
  cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase activation. Autophagy is also
  induced via JNK activation that releases Beclin1 from its inhibitory interaction
  with Bcl-2 at the level of ER, via Bcl-2 phosphorylation. UVRAG, UV radiation resistance
  associated gene protein; VPS, vacuolar protein sorting; ERAD, ER-associated degradation.
