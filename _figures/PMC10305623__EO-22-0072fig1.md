caption: An overview of the major androgen and 11-oxygenated androgen pathways in
  the testis, adrenal gland, prostate cancer (PC) and castration-resistance prostate
  cancer (CRPC). Steroidogenic enzymes that are differentially regulated in CRPC compared
  to PC are highlighted in blue (downregulation) and red (upregulation). An increased
  or decreased arrow size in the 11-oxygenated androgen pathway indicates if the reaction
  is known to be substantially more or less efficient compared to the classical androgen
  pathway. Enzymes or proteins known to be affected by clinically relevant gain-of-functions
  mutations are highlighted in purple. The inhibitory actions of frequently used treatments
  in CRPC are shown in orange. This figure was prepared using https://www.biorender.com/.
