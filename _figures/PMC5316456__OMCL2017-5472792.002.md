caption: Select alterations affecting amino acid metabolism in Alzheimer's disease
  brain. (a) Several pathogenic processes occurring in Alzheimer's disease brain.
  The bold arrow indicates that tryptophan metabolism in the kynurenine pathway may
  be increased relative to the serotonin pathway in AD, contributing to the lower
  tryptophan levels observed. (b) Select mechanisms through which the Alzheimer's
  disease brain attempts to maintain homeostasis when faced with decreased glucose
  catabolism and increased amino acid catabolism and ammonia levels.
