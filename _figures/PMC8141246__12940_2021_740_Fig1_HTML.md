caption: 'Novel biomarkers in the pathway between PFAS exposure and gestational diabetes
  mellitus (GDM) development. PFAS targets the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis,
  disrupting thyroid hormone homeostasis, which may contribute to GDM development.
  While the thyroid may be the main target for hormone disruption, PFAS can also exert
  toxicity to other tissues involved in this regulatory pathway. Abbreviations: FT3,
  free triiodothyronine; FT4, free thyroxine; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; HOMA-%β,
  homeostatic model assessments of β-cell function; HOMA-IR, homeostatic model of
  assessment of insulin resistance; T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing
  hormone; TSH, thyrotropin'
