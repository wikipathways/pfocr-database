caption: Mechanisms of action of eCIRP in hemorrhagic shock. Damaged vessels are unable
  to deliver blood to tissue due to hemorrhage. The loss of perfusion and resultant
  hypoxemia result in ischemic damage to cells. Due to hypoxemia, cellular metabolism
  shifts to anaerobic metabolism via glycolysis which leads to increasing lactate
  production. The accumulation of lactate creates an acidotic environment, causing
  further cell damage. The accumulation of these factors results in cell death by
  varying mechanisms including apoptosis, necrosis, and necroptosis. As a result of
  cell death, the cell membrane is disrupted, and intracellular CIRP is released into
  the extracellular space, becoming eCIRP, as shown in the top right. During the shock
  state, blood flow is shunted towards vital organs. eCIRP, now in systemic circulation,
  will also be shunted towards these organs, causing increased inflammation. eCIRP
  will bind to TLR4 and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM1) receptors
  on both tissue and circulating macrophages, demonstrated in the bottom left. As
  a result of this binding, the macrophage will release pro-inflammatory cytokines
  into circulation, worsening inflammation in the already ischemic tissues. A detailed
  image shown in the bottom right illustrates eCIRP acting on TLR4/MyD88 and inducing
  damage to the mitochondria, causing an increase in cytosolic DNA. This cytosolic
  DNA via the cGAS pathway activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) on the
  endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This results in an increase in pIRF, a transcription
  factor responsible for increasing expression of type I IFNs. The activation of this
  pathway increases the release of type I IFNs into the circulation. These pathways
  collectively lead to inflammation and injury in hemorrhagic shock
