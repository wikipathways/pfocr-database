caption: Schematics of the multiscale model used by Li et al. ρ is the nonproliferating
  cells ratio, β is the balancing factor that models extra variabilities such as logistic
  constraint. γ is the drug effect coefficient, [ERK] denotes the mean concentration
  level of ERK in cells. xi and xj are the gene expression (protein) levels, αi >
  0 and αj > 0 are the degradation and synthesis rates, respectively. ηdrug is the
  drug effects factor. The expected impact of Lapatinib is the suppression of the
  Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (RAF)/RAS pathway or reduces the concentration
  level of [ERK] and thus, the prevention of cancer cells from proliferation.
