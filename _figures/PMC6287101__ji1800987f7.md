caption: The overview of complement cascade activation and targets of inhibitors.
  As depicted in the complement cascade (blue dotted line frame), the classical and
  MBL pathway split the C3 into C3a and C3b by C3 convertase C4b2a, whereas the alternative
  pathway cleave C3 to C3a and C3b by another C3 convertase C3bBb, in which C3b can
  initiate an alternative pathway via amplification loop. The C5 convertase is formed
  by C3b binding to C3 convertase (C4b2a or C3bBb) and then catalyze C5 into C5a and
  C5b, the latter of which further triggers the formation of MAC by sequentially assembling
  C6, C7, C8, and multi-C9. The indicated complement regulatory proteins, including
  Crry, FH, CD55, CD46, and CD59, restrict complement activation at different stages.
  Notably, C5 can also be cleaved by other serine proteases such as thrombin in a
  C3-independent manner. The C3a and C5a are potent anaphylatoxins by interacting
  with their receptors C3aR or C5aR/C5L2, respectively. The complement activation
  contributes to the pathogenesis of renal IRI via the effectors of C3b, anaphylatoxins
  C3a/C5a, and MAC. Therefore, a deficiency of the complement components C3 (, , ),
  C5 (, ), C6 (), or FB (, ) alleviates renal IRI; in contrast, a deficiency of CD55,
  CD59, Crry, or FH (–, ), exacerbates renal IRI. In addition, the loss of C3aR and/or
  C5aR also protects mice from renal IRI (, ). However, the role of C5L2 is still
  controversial (, ). In this study, we further demonstrated that the deficiency of
  FB, C3, C4, C5, C5aR1, or C6 alleviates murine renal IRI, whereas the deficiency
  of C5aR2 fails to affect IRI determined by detecting complement activation, renal
  function, tubular epithelial apoptosis, and cytokine production (green dotted line
  frame). In addition, a targeted complement inhibitor CRIg/FH potently protects the
  kidney from IRI, probably via PI3K/AKT activation because a PI3K inhibitor duvelisib
  almost abrogates the renoprotective role of CRIg/FH. Therefore, this finding reveals
  the positive feedback between complement activation and renal IRI and further suggests
  the candidate drugs for IRI prevention/treatment, such as CRIg/FH and PI3K/AKT agonists.
