caption: Relationships between structural genes and corresponding metabolites of flavonoid
  synthesis in the flesh of SmMYB75 transgenic plants. (A) Heatmap of flavonoid synthesis
  pathways for the upregulated structural genes and DAMs in SmMYB75-OE flesh. The
  green and blue colors represent the downregulation of metabolite accumulation and
  gene expression, respectively. The dark red and magenta represent the accumulation
  and upregulation of gene expression, respectively. (B) Correlation analysis of SmMYB75
  expression and all DEGs. The content of all DAMs in WT and SmMYB75-OE eggplant flesh
  with correlation coefficients > 0.82 and p-values < 0.05, respectively. The size
  of the plots represents the number of connecting lines
