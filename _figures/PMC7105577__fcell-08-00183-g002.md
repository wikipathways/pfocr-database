caption: Crosstalk between major signaling pathways during nephron progenitor cell
  (NPC) differentiation. WNT9b, BMP7, and FGF2/9 are secreted by UB cells (green color).
  Stromal cells secret Decorin, SFRP1, Fat4, and TGFβ2 (orange color). High levels
  of WNT9b/β-catenin increase expression of the differentiation-specific genes (PAX8,
  C1qdc2, and WNT4) of nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). Fat4/Hippo signaling amplifies
  β-catenin activity. On the other hand, WNT signaling can be inhibited by SFRP1 and
  DKK1 to arrive appropriate number of nephrons in a definitive kidney. The BMP7/SMAD1/5
  signaling pathway promotes differentiation of NPCs. Decorin antagonizes BMP7/SMAD
  signaling in NPCs. BMP7 activates proliferation by the TAK1-JNK-JUN cascade. FOS
  activation is regulated by FGF9. AP1 (a dimeric transcription factor composed of
  Jun and FOS) acts as a point of collaboration between the BMP7 and FGF9 signaling
  pathways. AP-1 activates transcription of a variety of genes (MYC, BCL-2, and p53)
  related to the cell cycle and anti-apoptotic events; thereby, it regulates survival
  and proliferation of NPCs. The FGF/RAS-MAPK, FGF/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway promotes
  survival and proliferation of NPCs. After binding of Notch2 to Notch ligands, NICD
  is released into the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus where the complex
  decreases self-renewal specific gene expression and primes NPCs for differentiation.
  TGFβ2 is required for MET-related gene expression during NPCs differentiation. AKT,
