caption: Schematic drawing of the interaction between an activated T cell and a cancer
  cell. The cancer cell exploits the PD-1 pathway, reducing T cell activity. When
  blocking the PD-1 pathway with antibodies, the T cell becomes sufficiently activated
  to kill the cancer cell. As a response to increased T cell activation and inflammation,
  immune related adverse events (irAE) develop. These target different organs and
  resembles known autoimmune diseases present in the same organ. Created with BioRender.com.
