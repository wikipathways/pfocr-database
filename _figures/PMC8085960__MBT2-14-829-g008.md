caption: (A) Fatty acid chain elongation by the fatty acid synthesis pathway requires
  ATP input in the conversion of acetyl‐CoA into malonyl‐CoA and for the upgrade of
  NADH produced in glycolysis to NADPH required for fatty acid synthesis. B. The β‐oxidation
  pathway is chemically very similar. The acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase/Etf determine the
  direction of the cycle towards fatty acid breakdown. C. Reversal of the β‐oxidation
  pathway is possible by introducing an NADH‐dependent trans‐enoyl‐CoA reductase (red
  arrow) and results in a pathway that generates 1 ATP per chain elongation.
