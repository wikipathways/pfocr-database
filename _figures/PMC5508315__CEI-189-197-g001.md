caption: 'Mechanism of regulatory T cell (Treg) suppression. Contact‐independent:
  (a) anti‐inflammatory cytokine production. The secretion of anti‐inflammatory cytokines
  such as interleukin (IL)‐10, IL‐35 and transforming growth factor (TGF)‐ β has been
  linked with inhibition of T cell activation in vivo. (b) Exosomes: transfer of miRNA
  through extracellular vesicles of endosomal membranes can silence specific genes
  in T cells preventing cytokine production/proliferation. Contact‐dependent: modulation
  of antigen‐presenting cell (APC) maturation and function. The interaction of cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)‐4 on Tregs with its ligand CD80/86 on APCs, delivers
  a negative signal for T cell activation. CTLA‐4''s mechanism of action is varied,
  including: the capture of its APC expressed ligands and subsequent trans‐endocytosis
  and also the up‐regulation of indoleamine 2, 3‐dioxygenase (IDO) and the generation
  of kynurenines. Induction of apoptosis. Tregs have the capacity to induce apoptosis
  directly via granzyme A/B and perforin, inducible cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) early repressor (TRAIL), the Fas/Fas‐ligand pathway, the galectin‐9/T cell
  immunoglobulin and mucin domain‐3 (TIM‐3) pathway. Disruption of metabolic pathways.
  The ectoenzyme CD39, expressed on Tregs, result in the metabolism of adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), in turn producing the immunoregulatory purine,
  adenosine. Tregs have also been found to express high levels of intracellular cAMP.
  This is transferred to T effector cells through gap junctions, which leads to the
  up‐regulation of inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) and in turn the inhibition
  nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and IL‐2 transcription leading to apoptosis
  by IL‐2 deprivation. High expression of IL‐2 receptor alpha chain, CD25, depletes
  surrounding IL‐2. DC = dendritic cells.'
