caption: Innate IgA-inducing signaling pathways. Mucosal DCs induce IgA CSR and production
  by releasing BAFF, APRIL, and TGF-β on sensing microbial TLR ligands. Active TGF-κ
  originates from cleavage of a latency-associated peptide (LAP) by TLR-induced matrix
  metalloproteases. Engagement of TACI on B cells by BAFF and APRIL triggers association
  of the adaptor MyD88 to a TACI highly conserved domain that activates NF-κB through
  a pathway involving IL-1 receptor–associated kinase (IRAK) 1, IRAK-4, TGF-β activated
  kinase-1 (TAK1), and IκB kinase (IKK)-mediated degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kB
  (IkB). Additional NF-κB activation involves binding of TNF receptor–associated factor
  (TRAF) 2 to a TRAF-binding site (TBS) in the cytoplasmic domain of TACI. NF-κB initiates
  CSR by binding to κB motifs on the AID gene promoter. Engagement of TLRs by microbial
  ligands enhances IgA CSR and production through a Toll–IL-1 receptor domain (TIR)–dependent
  pathway that shares MyD88 with the TIR-independent pathway emanating from TACI.
  Further CSR-inducing signals are provided by TGF-β, which forms a heteromeric TGF
  receptor (TGF-βR) complex on B cells. TGF-β activates TGF-βR kinases that induce
  phosphorylation of receptor-regulated SMAD (R-SMAD) proteins. After forming homo-oligomeric
  and hetero-oligomeric complexes with a common-partner SMAD (Co-SMAD) protein, R-SMAD
  proteins translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to SMAD-binding elements (SBEs)
  on the Cαgene promoter. These Smad complexes further associate with constitutive
  and TGF-βR–induced cofactors, including Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3),
  which binds to RUNX-binding elements (RBEs); cyclic adenosine monophosphate response
  element–binding protein (CREB), which binds to a cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  response element (CRE); and Ets-like factor-1 (ELF-1), which binds to an Ets-binding
  site, to enhance CSR from Cμ to Cα.
