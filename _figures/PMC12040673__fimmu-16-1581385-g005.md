caption: Inhibitory effects of supersulfides on the TLR signaling pathway. Administration
  of NAC-S2 significantly improved the survival rate of mice subjected to lethal endotoxin
  shock. Mechanistically, TLR ligands, including zymosan A, polyinosinic-polycytidylic
  acid sodium salt (poly I:C), and LPS, are recognized by TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4, respectively.
  TLR activation induces the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α,
  IFN-β, and iNOS, through MyD88-dependent or TRIF-dependent signaling pathways. Supersulfide
  donors, such as NAC-S2, suppress the production of these inflammatory mediators
  by inhibiting the phosphorylation of signaling proteins. NaHS, sodium hydrosulfide
