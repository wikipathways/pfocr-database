caption: Overview of flux analysis using various SIL substrates. (a) Uniformly labeled
  glucose results in enrichment of lactate (M+3), TCA cycle intermediates (M+2), and
  PPP metabolites (M+5). (b) Use of [1, 2, 3–13C3]glucose generates M+3 lactate via
  glycolysis and M+2 lactate by the PPP and serves as a method for quantifying the
  modulation of glucose catabolism. (c) [13C5, 15N2]glutamine fully enriches TCA metabolites
  and is helpful for assessing GSH homeostasis. (d) Approaches using uniformly labeled
  aspartate and/or arginine allow for investigations of TCA cycle, purine nucleotides,
  and nitrogen metabolism. Strategic choices of substrates or combinations of substrates
  are dependent on pathways of interest downstream. GSH, glutathione; GSSG, glutathione
  disulfide; IMP, inosine monophosphat; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; SIL, stable
  isotope labelled; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
