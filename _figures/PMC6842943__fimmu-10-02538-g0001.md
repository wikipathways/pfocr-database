caption: Schematic illustration of NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and potential blockade
  sites of various pharmacological inhibitors. The signal 1 or the priming signal
  is mediated by pathogenic PAMPs from bacteria or virus, or sterile DAMPs resulting
  in NF-κB-dependent upregulation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β expression. The signal 2
  or activation signal mediated by numerous PAMP or DAMP stimulation, promotes the
  NLRP3 oligomerization, and recruitment of ASC and pro-caspase-1, leading to the
  activation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex. NLRP3 can be activated in response to
  extracellular ATP and K+ efflux through the ATP-gated P2X7 channel, in response
  to cathepsin B release from damaged lysosomes or in response to reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) released from damaged mitochondria. NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  results in active caspase-1, which cleaves the proforms of IL-1β and IL-18 into
  their mature forms. ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal
  caspase recruitment domain; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BHB, β-Hydroxybutyrate;
  CARD, caspase recruitment domain; DAMPS, danger or damage associated molecular patterns;
  IL, interleukin; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; MNS, methylenedioxy-β-nitrostyrene; NACHT,
  central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; Ori,
  oridonin; P2X7, P2X purinergic receptor 7; PAMPS, pathogen associated molecular
  patterns; PYD, pyrin domain; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLR, toll-like receptor;
  TR, tranilast.
