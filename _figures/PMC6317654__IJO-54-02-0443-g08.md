caption: miR-30e inhibits adhesion, migration, invasion and cell cycle progression
  of PCa cells via suppressing CHRM3 expression and activation of the MAPK signaling
  pathway. The miR-30e mimic inhibited the expression of the CHRM3 gene and inhibited
  the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, including the phosphorylation of ERK
  and JNK, and inhibited the activation of downstream c-fos and JUN, thereby inhibiting
  the adhesion, migration and invasion of PCa cells. CHRM3, M3 muscarinic acetylcholine
  receptor; PCa, prostate cancer; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N terminal kinase.
