caption: Schematic representation of pathways of type I interferon (IFN) induction
  and receptor signaling. Type I IFNs bind to receptors (IFNAR) on neighboring uninfected
  cells and activate JAK-STAT signaling pathways, which induce the expression of genes
  whose products interfere with viral replication. Type I IFNs also bind to receptors
  on infected cells and induce expression of genes whose products enhance the cell’s
  susceptibility to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated killing. The pathway targeted
  by feline coronavirus/feline peritonis virus (FeCoV/FIPV) is highlighted using .  FeCoV
  infection inhibited the type I IFN synthesis that results in an inhibition of the
  protein synthesis. Natural Killer (NK) cells are drastically depleted from the peripheral
  blood mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen in FIPV-infected cats. Moreover, NK showed
  less cytotoxic activity in FIP-infected cats. dsRNA, Double-stranded RNA; PKR, Double-stranded
