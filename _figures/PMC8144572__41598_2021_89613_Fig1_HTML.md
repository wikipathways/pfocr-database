caption: Signal transduction pathway in case of the two-component phototaxis system
  of Natronomonas pharaonis and domain architecture of membrane chemo- and photoreceptors
  of TCS. (A) Light activated sensory rhodopsin II (NpSRII) induces conformational
  and/or dynamical changes in the transducer (NpHtrII), which are converted by two
  HAMP domains and conveyed along the 200 Å long transducer to the tip region. Activated
  by the transducer histidine kinase CheA (bound to the adapter protein CheW) undergoes
  auto-phosphorylation and further transfers the phosphate group to the response regulators
  CheY or CheB. CheY affects the rotational bias of the flagellar motor, while the
  methylesterase CheB along with the methyltransferase CheR controls the adaptation
  mechanism. (B) Cartoon representations of the chemoreceptor dimer (Tar and Tsr in
  complex with kinases) from E. coli and of the photosensor dimer of the complex of
  the sensory rhodopsin II with its cognate transducer NpHtrII and kinases from N.
  pharaonis.
