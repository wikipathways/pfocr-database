caption: The cGAS-STING pathway in alcohol-related liver disease. Alcohol-induced
  ER stress and mtDNA release activate the STING pathway. STING facilitates IRF3 phosphorylation
  by TBK1, which results in the translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus, where it induces
  transcription of type I IFNs. A gap junction intracellular communication pathway
  between alcohol-exposed hepatocytes and the neighboring parenchyma also contributes
  to the IRF3 activation by cGAS. Activation of IRF3 could trigger hepatocyte apoptosis,
  type I IFN response and produce proinflammatory cytokines, leading to hepatic inflammation
  and injury.
