caption: 'Biosynthesis of Moco in plants. The pathway of Moco synthesis can be divided
  into four steps. The intermediates and the names of the Moco biosynthesis enzymes
  are given. Step 1: biosynthesis starts with conversion of GTP to cPMP in the mitochondria.
  The transporter ATM3 is involved in export of cPMP to the cytosol. Step 2: heterotetrameric
  MPT synthase, consisting of Cnx6 and Cnx7, inserts two sulphur atoms into cPMP and
  converts it to MPT. MPT synthase receives the sulphur from Cnx5 (MPT synthase sulphurase),
  with the primary sulphur donor of Cnx5 (X-S) being unknown. It is assumed that copper
  (Cu) is inserted directly after dithiolene formation. Step 3: MPT is adenylated
  by the Cnx1 G-domain of Mo insertase Cnx1, thus forming MPT-AMP. Step 4: MPT-AMP
  is transferred to the Cnx1 E-domain where Mo is inserted by replacing Cu, thus forming
  Moco which is finally allocated to Mo apo-enzymes. For better readability, the colours
  used for drawing the respective enzymes are the same in all figures and in .'
