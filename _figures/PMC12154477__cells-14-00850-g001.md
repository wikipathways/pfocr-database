caption: Commonly proposed biosynthetic pathway of rosmarinic acid (redrawn from Petersen
  et al., 2009 [24]) with structure of enzymes involved. PAL—phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; C4H—cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase; 4CL—4-coumaric acid CoA-ligase; TAT—tyrosine
  aminotransferase; HPPR—hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase; RAS—hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:hydroxyphenyllactate
  hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (rosmarinic acid synthase); 4C-pHPL 3H, 4C-pHPL 3′H—4-coumaroyl-4′-hydroxyphenyllactate
  3/3′-hydroxylases; Caf-pHPL 3′H—caffeoyl-4′-hydroxyphenyllactate 3′-hydroxylase;
  4C-DHPL 3H—4-coumaroyl-3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyllactate 3-hydroxylase. The abbreviations
  of the enzyme names in the rosmarinic acid biosynthetic pathway are marked in red,
  and those of the structural formulas are marked in green. The structures of the
  presented enzymes are downloaded from www.brenda-enzymes.org (accessed on 12 March
