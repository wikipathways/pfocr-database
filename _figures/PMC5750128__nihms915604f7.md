caption: Schematic drawing showing the effects of IGF-1 and ALC on prepubertal Kp
  synthesis and release. A) IGF-1 activates the IGF-1R/IRS-1 complex, which subsequently
  initiates critical phosphorylations within the Akt mediated pathway to mTOR; hence
  resulting in increased Kp synthesis and release. B) ALC blocks the activation of
  IGF-1R/IRS-1 complex by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRS-1resulting in the
  inhibition of key downstream phosphorylations within the Akt pathway to mTOR, thus
  suppressing Kp synthesis and release. IGF-1, Insulin-like growth factor 1; IGF-1R;
  insulin-like growth factor receptor 1; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate 1; Kp,
  kisspeptin; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; phosphorylated site, p; ras homologue
  enriched in brain, Rheb; TSC1, tuberous sclerosis complex 2.
