caption: Schematic showing the effect of Flii on TLR4 signalling and wound macrophage
  phenotypes. As the levels of Flii increase, signalling through the TLR4-NF-κB pathway
  is dampened, and there is a delay in the shift to M2 reparative macrophage phenotypes
  in the wound, which delays wound healing. (Created with BioRender.com, accessed
