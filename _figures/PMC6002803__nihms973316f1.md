caption: Activation of group I mGluR receptors results in the activation of mTORC1
  signaling, which increases protein synthesis. mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K1 and 4E-BP2.;
  phosphorylation of 4E-BP2 release eIF4E and results in the association of eIF4E
  with eIF4G to form of the active eIF4F (eIF4E-eIF4G-eIF4A) complex. eIF4F promotes
  the binding of mRNAs to ribosomes and recruits Mnk, which phosphorylates eIF4E,
  and eIF4B, which is phosphorylated by S6K1. The eIF4F complex and the poly(A) tail
  act synergistically together with MnK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF4E to stimulate
  cap-dependent translation initiation. Cap-dependent protein synthesis translates
  some mRNAs that encode for synaptic proteins located in the PSD. It is possible
  that mutation in genes encoding for proteins involved in the regulation of the mTORC1
  pathway results in aberrant synthesis synaptic proteins such as neuroligins, SHANK,
  SAPAP, etc. The altered synthesis of these proteins would generate changes in molecular,
  structural, and synaptic plasticity, ultimately leading to ASD pathophysiology.
  The protein products of genes associated with ASD are circled in red.
