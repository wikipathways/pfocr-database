caption: Impaired transcription and replication processes can occur, leading to DNA
  damage and genomic instability. (A) DNA damage can be a result of multiple factors,
  which could be of an endo or exogenous nature. (B) Repair of double-strand breaks
  (DSBs) is crucial to cell development and survival. DSBs are repaired without the
  need for a homologous template by the nonhomologous end-joining pathway. Consequently,
  an efficiently ligated DNA strand results in a heterogenous pool of antigen receptor
  genes needed for T and B cell development. Failure of the DSB repair mechanism activates
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which induces immunosuppressive cells known
  to promote cancer progression. Variable region (v), Constant region (c), Heavy chain
  (H), Light chain (L).
