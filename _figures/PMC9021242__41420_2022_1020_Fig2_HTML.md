caption: 'During epithelial damage, BSCs are activated and recruited to the site of
  lung injury. Surviving differentiated epithelial cells recruit integrin-linked kinases
  to adhesion sites with the injury, which result in degradation of Merlin, downregulation
  of the hippo pathway, and the secretion of Wnt7b. The Wnt7b induces ASMCs to release
  Fgf10, which binds to Fgfr2b on BSCs to mobilize and amplify stem/progenitor cell
  populations by inhibiting premature differentiation of BSCs, thereby promoting lung
  regeneration. In addition, S1P released by LMVECs promotes the proliferation and
  differentiation of AECIIs through the S1P-S1PR2-YAP signaling axis, thus regulating
  alveolar epithelial repair. Meanwhile, YAP promotes the germination and remodeling
  of neovascules through various angiogenesis factors such as Ang2, MMP2, VE-cadherin,
  α‐SMA, and PGC1α. Note: ALI acute lung injury; BSCs basal stem/progenitor cells,
  ASMCs airway smooth muscle cells, Fgf10 fibroblast growth factor 10, Fgfr2b fibroblast
  growth factor receptor 2, S1P sphingosine-1-phosphate, LMVECs lung microvascular
  endothelial cells, AECIIs type II alveolar epithelial cells, AECI type I alveolar
  epithelial cells, YAP Yes-associated protein, Ang2 Angiopoietin-2, MMP2 matrix metallopeptidase
  2, α‐SMA α-smooth muscle actin, PGC1α peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  γ coactivator 1α.'
