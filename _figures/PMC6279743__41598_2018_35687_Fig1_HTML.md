caption: ApoE4 and SirT1 pathways. ApoE4 exacerbates AD-related pathology by increasing
  β pathway processing of full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) and therefore
  Aβ production; and by decreasing astrocyte- and microglia-mediated Aβ clearance.
  ApoE4 expression is also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and lysosomal
  leakage in AD. A reduction of SirT1 as a result of ApoE4 expression may be a major
  contributor to the deleterious effects of ApoE4 because this can lead to a decrease
  in the FOXO3-mediated antioxidant response, PGC1α-mediated radical oxygen species
  (ROS) sequestration, and ADAM10 expression. Decreases in SirT1 also increase p53-mediated
  apoptosis, NFκB-mediated Aβ toxicity, and acetylation of tau; all of which exacerbate
  AD pathology.
