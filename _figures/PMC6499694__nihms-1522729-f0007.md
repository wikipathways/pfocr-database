caption: (A) Working model of how extracellular growth factor and TOP2β-mediated nuclear
  DNA damage signaling collaborate to sustain AKT-mTORC1 activation and maintain HSV-1
  latency. NGF-dependent activation of TrKA leads to sustained AKT Thr308 phosphorylation.
  This step is critical for AKT to be phosphorylated on Ser473 by DNA-PK. DNA-PK is
  then activated from transient DSBs generated by TOP2βcc intermediates acted on by
  TDP2, which can occur at promoters of early-response host genes during normal neuronal
  activity (). The MRN complex is critical for the processing of TOP2βcc for both
  DNA repair () and activation of DNA-PK (our study). We speculate that AKT undergoes
  continuous nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. AKT is likely phosphorylated on Thr308 at
  the plasma membrane by PDK1. This step is critical for initiating AKT nuclear translocation
  and phosphorylation by DNA-PK on Ser473, but negatively regulated by PHLPP1, leading
  to its nuclear export and activation of cytoplasmic AKT-mTORC1 canonical pathway.
  Continuous AKT-mTORC1 signaling is crucial for the maintenance of HSV-1 latency.
  Thus, sustained activation of the AKT-mTORC1 signaling axis in neurons requires
  consolidating two independent signals generated from potentially different cellular
  compartments (nuclear and plasma membrane/cytoplasm). During latency, histones at
  HSV-1 lytic promoters remain in a repressed state. Neuronal stress stimuli that
  trigger DLK/JIP3-mediated activation of JNK contribute to a histone methyl/phospho
  switch (), and subsequent replacement by euchromatin-associated marks (not pictured).
