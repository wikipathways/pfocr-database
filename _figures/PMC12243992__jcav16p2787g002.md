caption: Palmitoylation of EGFR, VEGFR, ER and GP130. A. Palmitoylation of the epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) results in a decreased association with the adaptor
  protein Grb2, which plays a pivotal role in mediating mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) signalling. Conversely, there is an increase in the association between
  palmitoylated EGFR and p85, the regulatory subunit crucial for the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway. Additionally, ras-related protein rab-27A (RAB27A)
  is posited to regulate zinc finger DHHC-type containing (ZDHHC)13, potentially influencing
  the palmitoylation process of EGFR. B. The stability of vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) is maintained through the actions of palmitoyltransferase
  ZDHHC3 and depalmitoylase acyl protein thioesterase (APT1), which serve as critical
  modulators. A deficiency in palmitoylation escalates the trafficking of VEGFR1 to
  lysosomes, leading to its degradation and affecting vascular morphogenesis. Furthermore,
  RAB27A is delineated as an upstream regulator in the palmitoylation process of VEGFR1.
  C. The palmitoylation of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) facilitates its association
  with the plasma membrane and its interaction with caveolin-1, a membrane protein,
  which is instrumental in triggering nongenomic activities, including the activation
  of various signalling pathways and promotion of cell proliferation. D. The localisation
  of ERβ at the plasma membrane and its interaction with caveolin-1 are contingent
  upon its palmitoylation. The ERβ-oestradiol (E2) complex's association with caveolin-1
  is pivotal for the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway,
  subsequently initiating a pro-apoptotic cascade that includes the activation of
  caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. E. Interleukin 11 (IL-11)
  activates JAK-STAT3 signalling via the IL-11 receptor alpha subunit/glycoprotein
  130 (GP130) receptors, subsequently enhance tumour metastasis. Palmitoylation of
  GP130 mediated its localisation on the membrane surface
