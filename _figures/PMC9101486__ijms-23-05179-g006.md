caption: 'Canonical NF-κB signalling pathway. NF-κB pathway regulates inflammatory
  responses, apoptosis, and cell growth. Extracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and bacterial metabolites (LPS) can activate the pathway through appropriate receptors
  (such as toll-like receptors, IL-1R, and TNFRSF1A) and by an accumulation of intracellular
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). These stress signals regulate the downstream IKK
  kinase complex. Activated IKKβ subunit phosphorylates IkB, which then is ubiquitinated
  and marked for degradation by proteases. This discharges NF-κB from the IkB-containing
  complex and uncovers the nuclear localisation signal (NLS). Then, NF-κB complex
  translocases to the nucleus, where it triggers the transcription of target genes
  that will produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and intracellular adhesion molecules
  [,,]. Intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule
  (VCAM1) facilitate the infiltration of leukocytes from the bloodstream into injured
  tissue during inflammation []. These adhesion molecules hold the leukocytes in close
  proximity to the endothelial cells to allow receptor/ligand interactions and facilitate
  leukocyte diapedesis between endothelial cells []. In the cochlea, ICAM-1 is expressed
  in the basal cells of the stria vascularis, type II and IV fibrocytes of the spiral
  ligament and endothelial cells of the spiral modiolar vein []. As a result, ICAM-1
  has a critical role in regulating the cochlear immune response by facilitating the
  extravasation of peripheral leukocytes into the cochlea during inflammation: ECM,
  extracellular matrix; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ICM, intracellular
  matrix; IRAK, Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; NO, nitric oxide; TRAF,
  TNF receptor-associated factor; TRADD (TNF-R1-associated death domain protein);
  TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β.'
