caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify biologically related networks
  from the subtype specific genes deregulated by subtype-specific copy number alterations
  (see Methods). The top resultant gene networks for each subtype are displayed. a)
  AC network #1 of genes related to HNF4 signaling. b) SqCC network #1 displaying
  potential interactions between multiple histone regulating genes for both a) and
  b), solid lines denote direct interactions while dotted lines represent indirect
  interactions between the genes. Network components highlighted in red are upregulated
  in the corresponding subtype whereas those highlighted green are downregulated.
  Those not highlighted are used by the software to display relationships. Additional
  information about the genes and their interactions can be found at www.ingenuity.com.
  or within the discussion. In this diagram molecules are represented as such; corkscrews
  represent enzymes, y-shaped molecules are transmembrane receptors, thimble-shaped
  molecules are transporters, kinases are triangular, and circular molecules encompass
  all other gene products.'
