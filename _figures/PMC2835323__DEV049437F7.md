caption: A schematic diagram depicting a pathway that connects polycystins and calcium
  signaling to HDAC5 and MEF2C-based transcription activation in the suppression of
  epithelial cyst formation. Fluid flow through lumens of renal tubules activates
  the polycystin 1 and 2 receptor-calcium channel complex. Downstream of the intracellular
  calcium rise, active PKC directly or indirectly causes phosphorylation of HDAC5
  and its export from the nucleus, enabling activation of MEF2C-regulated transcripts,
  which probably encode proteins that maintain the normal differentiated state of
  renal epithelial cells. The observed increase of HDAC5 and MEF2C transcript levels
  in our microarray analysis might be explained by feedback loops, depicted with dotted
  lines.
