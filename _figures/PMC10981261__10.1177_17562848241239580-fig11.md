caption: A schematic diagram depicts six metabolic pathways enriched in at least three
  sample types. Metabolites in black font exhibit significant differences between
  UC and control groups in previous metabolomics studies, while those in gray font
  have not been reported to exhibit such differences in prior metabolomics articles.
  The connecting lines between different pathways link the important metabolites between
  them.UC, ulcerative colitis
