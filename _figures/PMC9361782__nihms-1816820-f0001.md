caption: Retinoic acid signaling pathway. Upon entering the cell, retinol can either
  be converted to its storage form, retinyl esters, or undergo a two-step oxidation
  from retinaldehyde to retinoic acid. Retinoic acid is a ligand binding partner of
  the three retinoic acid receptors (RAR) isoforms RAR-α, -β, and -γ which, upon ligand
  binding, lead to changes in transcription and downstream gene expression. Arrows
  represent the different ways the retinoid metabolites can be reduced or oxidized
  by various enzymes catalysts
