caption: 'Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) form gap junctions with Interstitial cells of
  Cajal (ICC) and fibroblast‐like cells (FLCs), creating an electrical syncytium that
  together regulate SMC function. Intrinsic motor neurons, with cell bodies located
  in the myenteric plexus, innervate this syncytium. Information is sent by sensory
  neurons from the gut to the enteric ganglia, the CNS, and to autonomic ganglia (not
  shown) and extrinsic neurons transmit information from CNS to enteric ganglia. As
  described by Gallego D et al. (2016), during high frequencies neuronal action potentials,
  calcium entry to the neuron activates neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which
  converts L‐arginine (L‐arg) to NO. NO activates guanylyl cyclase (Gc) in FLCs which
  turns guanosine triphosphate into cyclic guanosine monophosphate, activating protein
  kinase G. The latter relaxes the cell via two mechanisms: potassium channel activation
  and myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) activation, which uncouples actin from
  myosin, the opposite from contraction due to myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activation.
  Subsequently, hyperpolarization is transmitted to smooth muscle cells through gap
  junctions. During low‐frequency neuronal action potentials Adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (βNAD) facilitate polarization through
  the inositol 1,4,5‐trisphosphate (IP3) pathway. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA),
  produced in response to oxidative stress and aging, reaches the gut through the
  circulation and is delivered to intrinsic neurons, via cationic amino acid transporter
  1/2 (CAT1/2) proteins. ADMA competes with L‐arg for entry into neurons, and once
  inside acts as an inhibitor of nNOS, disrupting the synthesis of NO. The reduced
  synthesis of NO impairs smooth muscle contraction via the ICC nitrergic pathway.
  ADMA is also taken up by enterocytes where it interferes with L‐arg metabolism and
  inhibits NO synthesis. NO is necessary for mucus production and solute transport,
  and impaired synthesis of NO disrupts this protective effect. Furthermore, in gastric
  and duodenal mucosa when NO is available it mediates the release of calcitonin gene‐related
  peptide (CGRP) from neurons, and this results in immediate dilation of submucosal
  arterioles facilitating the dilution and buffering of back‐diffused acid. Given
  that NOS inhibitors have been shown to abolish the reactive hyperemic response,
  it is likely that ADMA results in a marked increase in the susceptibility of the
  mucosa to damage. ADMA may also interfere with NO synthesis in enterocytes and neurons
  through availability of substrate L‐arg, which is supplied to these cells through
  diet, endogenous synthesis, and Endothelial or Glial cells. As outlined in Figure 
  this may result in a functional deficiency of intracellular L‐arg. In irritable
  bowel syndrome, there is an increase in the number and/or activation of mast cells
  and intraepithelial lymphocytes within the small and large intestines. ADMA‐mediated
  inhibition of NOS and a corresponding decrease in NO synthesis activates mast cells.
  Mast cells and neurons communicate bidirectionally. Activated mast cells release
  bioactive substances preformed in granules (i.e., histamine, serotonin, and enzymes)
  and cytokines de novo, which act on neuron receptors (e.g., Transient receptor potential
  cation channel subfamily V member 1 receptor [TRVPR], 5‐hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor
  [5HT3R], protease activated receptor 2 [PAR2], Histamine 1 receptor [H1R]), and
  result in visceral hypersensitivity and impaired smooth muscle contraction. Furthermore,
  histamine and mast cell tryptase are also known to stimulate chloride ion secretion
  via activating H1R and PAR2, which is expressed in both basolateral and apical membranes
  of enterocytes. Intrinsic and extrinsic neurons respond to a variety of stimuli
  and release a high number of neuropeptides, such as substance P (SP), vasoactive
  intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and CGRP, which in turn regulate the activation of
  mast cells. Mucosal mast cells also influence intestinal permeability, and mast
  cell‐derived tryptase has been identified as an important contributor in the disruption
  of the intestinal barrier. Mast cell tryptase cleaves PAR2 on colonocytes to increase
  paracellular permeability by acting on intercellular apical junction complex, which
  mainly consists of the tight junctions such as claudins and the adherens junction
  such as E‐cadherin. Activated mast cells also release proinflammatory mediators
  that further contribute to epithelial barrier disruption through recruitment of
  other immune cells (e.g., TNF‐α recruit neutrophils), while interleukins 3, 5, 13,
  and granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor recruit eosinophils and basophils.
  Although impaired NO synthesis leads to mast cell activation in the GI tract it
  is important to note that commensal bacteria and products, food antigens, allergens,
  toxins, and psychological distress also play key roles in regulating mast cell activation
  and secretion. Created with Biorender.com'
