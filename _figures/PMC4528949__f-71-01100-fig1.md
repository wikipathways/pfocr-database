caption: General degradation pathway of the pectin backbones of polygalacturonan (PGA)
  and rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) by bacterial enzymes to obtain monomers for metabolic
  processes. The PGA backbone is targeted at the 1–4 α-linkage between galacturonic
  acids (GalA) by pectate lyases and pectin lyases, which cleave the backbone until
  single and small polysaccharides remain. The reaction will leave a saturated and
  unsaturated GalA. The small polysaccharides containing terminal GalA are imported
  into the bacterium and then targeted by either UGL, URH or galacturonases to leave
  a saturated GalA and unsaturated GalA. The RG-I backbone is degraded in a similar
  fashion by RG lyases, leaving a saturated rhamnose (Rha) and a polysaccharide containing
  an unsaturated terminal GalA. The short-chain polysaccharides follow the same process
  as PGA polysaccharides, and once inside the cell are cleaved by URH, leaving a rhamnose
  and unsaturated GalA. In both instances the unsaturated GalA may spontaneously open
  to 4-­deoxy-l-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate. R– indicates polysaccharide side chains
  linked to both backbones. The backbones are also decorated with acetyl esters (ActEst)
  and methyl esters (MetEst).
