caption: Signal pathways and TFs involved in the regulation of fbp1 gene. (A) Schematic
  representation of glucose sensing and signal pathway. Presence of environmental
  glucose is sensed by the seven-transmembrane receptor Git3 coupled with trimeric
  G protein, Gpa2-Git5-Git11. Activated G protein further activates adenylate cyclase,
  Cyr1, which in turn catalyzes cAMP synthesis. Thus, the presence of environmental
  glucose is signaled as an inter-cellular cAMP concentration. The resultant cAMP
  binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA (Cgs1) and cAMP-bound Cgs1 is released from
  catalytic subunit of PKA (Pka1) to activate Pka1. Phosphorylation of TF Rst2 by
  Pka1 (Repressive phosphorylation) inhibits hyperphosphorylation of Rst2 by other
  kinase(s) and following transition of Rst2 to the nucleus. Loss of cAMP production
  by depleting glucose represses Pka1 activity by forming complex with the inhibitory
  subunit, Cgs1, resulting loss of repressive phosphorylation of Rst2 which in turn
  results in hyperphosphorylation of Rst2, and Rst2 is imported to the nucleus for
  transcription activation. (B) Glucose starvation stress activates MAPK pathway.
  This results in the phosphorylation of TF Atf1 and induces transcription activation
  of its target genes. (C) Schematic representation of fbp1 upstream regulatory sequence
  and the targeting TFs. The upstream activation sites 1 and 2 (UAS1 and UAS2) are
  binding sites for Atf1 and Rst2, respectively. The two TFs, Atf1 and Rst2, are regulated
  under MAPK and PKA pathways, respectively. Rst2 also targets the CT-rich sequence
  near the UAS1. CBF (CCAAT-binding factor) targets the sequence near the UAS2. UAS2
  is also a target site of Scr1 in glucose rich sequence. UAS2 is reciprocally occupied
  by Scr1 and Rst2 for the repression and activation of fbp1 gene depending on the
  environmental condition. Tup co-repressor locates at fbp1 upstream region across
  UAS1 to UAS2 in both repressive and depressive conditions to provide glucose specific
  regulation of fbp1 transcription induction.
