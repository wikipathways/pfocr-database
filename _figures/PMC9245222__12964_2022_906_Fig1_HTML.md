caption: Nrf2 pathway under homeostasis and stress conditions. Under unstressed situations,
  most of Nrf2 protein is ubiquitinated by Keap1-Cullin3 E3 ubiquitin ligase enzymes
  and subsequently degraded by the proteasomal machinery. Upon exposure to oxidative
  stresses, the interaction between Nrf2 and that complex is interrupted, which resulted
  in decreased Nrf2 degradation and increased its translocation into the nucleus where
  heterodimerized with the small MAF proteins
