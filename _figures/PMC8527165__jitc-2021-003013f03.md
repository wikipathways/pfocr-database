  description: Interactions within and between the immunosuppressive metabolite networks.
    The adenosine (ADO), kynurenine, (PGE2), (nor)epinephrine (NOR), and other immune
    checkpoint pathways interact and stimulate each other and may employ feedforward
    signaling/synthesis regimes. (1) Blockade of PD-1 or CTLA-4 appears to induce
    (IDO1) expression. (2) A2BAR signaling induces (IDO1) expression. (3, 4) CD39
    and CD73 can promote synthesis of (PGE2), and A2AAR or A2BAR signaling can induce
    expression of COX-2. (5) β-AR signaling upregulates (IDO1) expression. (6, 7)
    β2-AR signaling has been linked to the upregulation of COX-2 and cPGES. (8, 9,
    10) cPGES is a modulator of (AhR) activity, and COX-2 can influence expression
    of (TDO2) and (IDO1). (11, 12) (AhR) signaling can increase PD-1 expression and
    correlates with reduced efficacy of an αCTLA-4 antibody. (13) (AhR) signaling
    can promote expression of (CD39.) (14) (AhR) signaling can promote expression
    of COX-2. (15) EP2/4 signaling can increase PD-1 expression. (16) (PGE2) can induce
    expression of CD73.) (17, 18) β-adrenergic signaling correlates with diminished
