caption: Both endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids elicit their effects by binding
  to CB1Rs (, , , ). CB1Rs are seven-transmembrane-domain, G protein-coupled receptors
  located in the cell membrane (). CB1R signaling leads to inhibition of adenylate
  cyclase (AC) activity (, , ), N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (, , , ), N-type
  and P/Q-type calcium channels and D-type potassium channels (, ) and activate A-type
  and inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) (). CB1Rs also participate in
  the regulation of neurotransmitter release (, ) and inhibit synaptic transmission
  (, ). The actions on Ca2+ channels and AC are thought to be mediated by the G protein
  α subunits, while the βγ subunits activate GIRK and PI3K. The βγ complex further
  activates the p38/JNK/ERK1/2 pathways, followed by phosphorylation of several downstream
  targets, such as cPLA2, ELK-1, c-fos, c-Jun and CREB, leading to the expression
  of target genes such as krox-24 and BDNF (, ). PI3K mediates the AKT-induced inhibition
  of CREB activation (). Inhibition of AC and the subsequent decrease in cAMP reduces
  the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), resulting in reduced phosphorylation
  of K+ channels (, , ). Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation followed by inhibition of
  CaMKIV and CREB phosphorylation has also been found under certain conditions in
  vivo, leading to inhibition of Arc expression (, ). Stimulatory effects are shown
  by (→) arrows and inhibitory effects by (⊥) arrows.
