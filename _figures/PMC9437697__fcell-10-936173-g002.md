caption: Relationship between the endometrial miRNA expression and implantation. (A)
  Pro-implantation miRNA. The expression of the miRNA has a positive association with
  the implantation outcome. (B) Anti-implantation miRNA. The expression of the miRNA
  has a negative association with the implantation outcome. (C) Endometrial miRNAs
  lead to implantation failure through their effect on target mRNA in the endometrial
  tissue of RIF patients. The red circle represents miRNA, the green and purple circles
  represent mRNA, the orange circle represents hormones, the yellow circle represents
  the drug, the blue circle represents the signaling pathway, and the navy blue circle
  represents infection. The miRNA-mRNA network is based on Section 4in this article.
