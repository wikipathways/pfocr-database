caption: Proposed mechanisms through which genetic variants influence NAFLD and its
  comorbidities. (A) The PNPLA3 I148M variant is resistant to ubiquitination, resulting
  in increased levels of PNPLA3, which can bind and sequester the ATGL co-activator
  CGI-58 to inhibit lipolysis. (B) The PNPLA3 I148M variant has reduced activity to
  transfer PUFA acyl chains from TAG or DAG. As a result, there is an enrichment of
  PUFAs in TAGs and DAGs, which may explain the uncoupling of steatosis from insulin
  resistance (IR) in carriers of the mutant. C) The I148M SNP also has reduced retinal
  ester hydrolase activity, which may serve to promote HSC-mediated pro-inflammatory
  and pro-fibrogenic signaling compared to wild-type PNPLA3. (D) The rs176834314 variant
  of 17β-HSD13 has reduced retinol dehydrogenase activity that renders carriers more
  resistant to NASH through unknown mechanisms. (E) The rs641738 variant of MBOAT7
  leads to lower levels of the MBOAT7 protein, which has lysophosphatidylinositol
  acyltransferase activity. As a consequence, increased levels of lysophosphatidylinositol
  can promote TAG synthesis and cellular dysfunction, leading to NASH. (F) PLIN2 S251P
  potentially promotes steatosis through increased antagonism of ATGL. As PLIN2 regulates
  inflammation, it is speculated that this variant may enhance inflammatory signaling
  to promote NASH. (G) TM6SF2 resides in the ER where it is involved in the incorporation
  of PUFAs into TAG and phospholipids and VLDL secretion. The E267K variant reduces
  TM6SF2 protein levels and impairs PUFA enrichment and VLDL secretion. This variant
  increases NASH incidence but reduces CVD, likely as a result of reduced circulating
  cholesterol. Solid arrows represent enzymatic conversion or movement through the
  cell and dashed lines represent signaling. The line width represents flux through
  a given enzyme or pathway.
