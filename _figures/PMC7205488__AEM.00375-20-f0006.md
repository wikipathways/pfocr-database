caption: Pinoresinol catabolic pathway intermediates and cognate gene-enzyme systems.
  The enzyme names shown in blue either have significant amino acid identities with
  functionally characterized enzymes or are functionally validated (PinA and PinB;
  flavocytochrome) in this study. Enzymes shown in red are predicted to catalyze the
  reactions indicated. All genes/enzymes (except esterase and PcaG in the lower pathway)
  shown here are overexpressed in response to pinoresinol exposure. The upper (U)
  and lower (L) pathway steps are also indicated.

  Encoded by Translationally Coupled Genes within a Cluster of (+)-Pinoresinol-Coinduced
