caption: PRA key components-major hubs–main pathways network. Green diamonds represent
  each component (prototype/metabolite) in PRA; round pink nodes represent putative
  targets of PRA components; round red nodes represent known therapeutic targets for
  HP; round yellow nodes represent both putative targets of PRA components and known
  therapeutic targets for HP, and targets circled in blue represent those important
  hubs involved in the progression of PRA acting on HP; blue rectangles represent
  top 10 pathways from enrichment analysis of major targets, and blue rectangle circled
  in red represent the most significant pathway; edges represent interactions among
  PRA key components, putative targets, known therapeutic targets for the treatment
  of HP, and main pathways.
