caption: Schematic representation of Notch canonical and non-canonical pathway. Initiation
  of Notch signaling occurs on ligand binding to the receptor. There are five typical
  Notch ligands Delta like, 1, 3, and 4 and Jagged 1 and 2 with a Delta-Serrate-Lag
  2 (DSL) domain, while atypical ligands include DNER, F3/Contactin and NB-3 without
  a DSL domain and four Notch receptors Notch 1–4. Proteolytic cleavage by disintegrin
  and metalloproteases family proteases (MMP), and gamma-secretase releases active
  Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The biological process is mediated by Notch via
  canonical and noncanonical pathways. In the canonical Notch pathway, NICD translocates
  to the nucleus and binds to the transcription factor CSL. Mastermind co-activators
  activate the CSL-NICD complex leading to suppression of differentiation and maintenance
  of stemness by activating transcriptional targets HES1 and HEY1. HES1 increases
  the stemness-related genes in CRC cells and CSC surface markers CD133, ALDH1, and
  ABCG2. In noncanonical pathway, atypical ligand interacts with receptor promoting
  differentiation by formation of CSL-NICD-Deltex complex.,,.
