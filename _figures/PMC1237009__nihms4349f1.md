caption: NPC1L1, expressed at the apical surface of enterocytes, may be the transporter
  that selectively absorbs dietary cholesterol (C) from micelles in the lumen of the
  small intestine, a step that is blocked by the drug ezetimibe. We propose a model
  for NPC1L1 action, in which this transporter permits the uptake of cholesterol (and
  noncholesterol sterols) into vesicles that then move through a subapical endosomal
  sorting compartment (). Mutations in either of the transporters ABCG5 or ABCG8 cause
  the hyperabsorption of dietary plant sterols (PS) and other noncholesterol sterols
  from the small intestine, resulting in the human disease sitosterolemia (, ). The
  endosomal sorting compartment allows cholesterol to progress to the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), where it is esterified (CE) by ACAT-2 and then transferred to chylomicrons
  (pink) ready for secretion into the bloodstream; plant sterols are shunted through
  a pathway resulting in their transport back to the gut lumen via ABCG5 and ABCG8.
  Cholesterol that is synthesized de novo is also esterified by ACAT-2 and enters
  chylomicrons (). Mutations in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)
  result in the human disorder abetalipoproteinemia characterized by secretion of
  chylomicrons (). When bound to the protein disulfide isomerase, MTP transfers neutral
  lipids into newly formed chylomicrons in the ER, a necessary step in the pathway
  of lipid secretion. Mutations in the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Sar1,
  which is involved in trafficking of chylomicrons in the ER, causes chylomicron retention
  disease (). Although no human disease has been linked to ARF-1 (ADP-ribosylation
  factor 1), this GTPase appears to be important for lipoprotein secretion by regulating
  vesicle budding from the Golgi (). The parts played by SRB1 (scavenger receptor
  type B1), expressed on the apical and basolateral enterocyte surface, and ABCA1,
  expressed on the basolateral enterocyte surface, remain unclear. (TG, triglyceride;
  B48, apolipoprotein B48; HDL, high density lipoprotein.)
