caption: 'The hedgehog signaling pathway. (Top—Stage 1): to initiate hedgehog signaling,
  the secreting cell cleaves the Shh protein into two domains: N-Shh and C-Shh. N-Shh
  is then secreted into the extracellular domain. (Left—Stage 2): cells that have
  not yet been targeted by Shh exist in an “OFF State”. In this state, PTCH1 inhibits
  Smo, which allows SUFU to bind the Gli proteins, keeping them in an inactive state.
  Gli3 forms a repressor complex with GSK-3β, whilst Gli1 and Gli2 are marked for
  degradation. The repressor complex translocates to the nucleus, where it represses
  gene transcription. (Right—Stage 3): once the N-Shh has bound to the transmembrane
  protein PTCH1, cells transition into an “ON State”. In this state, PTCH1 no longer
  inhibits Smo, which in turn stops SUFU-mediated inactivation of the Gli proteins.
  This impedes the formation of the repressor complex and allows Gli1 and Gli2 to
  form an activation complex, which translocates to the nucleus and activates the
  transcription of target genes.'
