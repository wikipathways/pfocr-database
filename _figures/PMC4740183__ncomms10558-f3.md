caption: One route (green arrows) for the initial catabolism of choline is mediated
  by intestinal microbes and leads to the formation of trimethylamine (TMA). TMA is
  efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and subsequently oxidized by
  the liver to form trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) through reactions catalysed by one
  or more of the flavin monooxygenase (FMO) family of enzymes. Alternatively (red
  arrows), choline can be oxidized to betaine through reactions catalysed by choline
  dehydrogenase (CHDH) and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH7A1). Betaine (also
  known as trimethylglycine) is demethylated to form dimethylglycine via the betaine-homocysteine
  S-methyltransferase enzymes (BHMT, BHMT2). This reaction simultaneously converts
  homocysteine to methionine. Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH) subsequently demethylates
  dimethylglycine to form sarcosine, which is then converted to glycine by sarcosine
  dehydrogenase (SDH) after removal of the remaining methyl group. Glycine is metabolized
  by a group of enzymes known as the glycine cleavage complex (GCC), which is the
  major route in animals for glycine degradation and the formation of ammonia (NH3)
  and carbon dioxide (CO2). NH3 is converted to carbamoyl phosphate, which enters
  the urea cycle (blue arrows) through the rate-limiting reaction catalysed by carbamoyl-phosphate
  synthase 1 (CPS1), or can be converted back to glycine through the GCC. Carbamoyl
  phosphate is metabolized by ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) to form citrulline
  and subsequently argininosuccinate through a reaction catalysed by argininosuccinate
  synthetase (ASS). This is followed by the formation of L-arginine by arginosuccinate
  lyase (ASL). L-Arginine is used as a substrate for the production of nitric oxide
  or metabolized by arginase (ARG1) to form urea for excretion and ornithine for re-entry
  back into the cycle. Metabolites that were available for analysis are shown in black,
  whereas unmeasured metabolites are shown in grey.
