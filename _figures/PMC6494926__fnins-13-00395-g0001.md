caption: 'Granulin biogenesis, quality control at the ribosome during its synthesis,
  and molecular mechanism of FTLD associated with mutations in the signal peptide
  of the granulin precursor. (A) Schematic presentation of GRN, precursor protein
  structure, and known missense mutations in the signal peptide. Progranulin pre-mRNA
  transcript is synthesized in the nucleus from GRN gene in the chromosome 17. It
  has 13 exons with exons 2–13 containing protein coding region. After splicing, mRNA
  is exported to cytoplasm for translation. Progranulin precursor (63.5 kDa protein)
  consists of N-terminal cleavable signal peptide (green line with indicated position
  of the cleavage by the signal peptidase shown as purple scissors) and 7.5 repeats
  (green ovals): P (half-repeat, paragranulin), G (granulin 1), F (granulin 2), B
  (granulin 3), A (granulin 4), C (granulin 5), D (granulin 6), and E (granulin 7).
  Repeats are connected by linker sequences (light orange boxes). Proteases are shown
  as brown scissors. Signal peptide sequence presented with known missense mutations
  L (V5L), R (W7R), D (A9D), corresponding amino acid residues in the wild-type signal
  peptide are underlined. (B) PGRN protein trafficking and processing. During early
  translation step on the ribosome (purple hemispheres), N-terminal signal peptide
  of progranulin (green line) is recognized by Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) (shown
  in orange) and ribosome-nascent chain complex is targeted to ER for signal peptide
  cleavage (purple scissors), posttranslational modifications, and further processing
  and transport. Full length protein could be processed to 6 kDa granulins in lysosomes
  by cathepsins (brown scissors are symbols for all proteases involved in posttranslational
  processing) or secreted outside and undergo extracellular processing. Uptake of
  full-length protein is governed by endocytosis with the help of sortilin receptor
  (blue box) or through alternative PSAP (prosaposin)-dependent pathway with involvement
  of mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 1 (LRP1) (gray blue box). (C) Loss of interaction with targeting factor,
  SRP, activates RAPP pathway. During normal translational event, PGRN with N-terminal
  signal sequence is targeted to ER through interaction with SRP. Amino acid sequence
  of signal peptide and location of reported clinical mutations are shown on (A).
  When A9D or W7R mutations in signal peptide is detected or SRP is defective or lost,
  nascent chain is no longer targeted to ER by SRP. It leads to the RAPP pathway activation
  and degradation of the GRN mRNA.'
