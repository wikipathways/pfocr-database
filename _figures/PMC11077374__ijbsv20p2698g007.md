caption: The role of HIF in regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and autophagy
  in pancreatic cancer. CDK8, BNIP3 and VMP1 are the downstream factors of HIF-1α,
  which activate autophagy and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. HIF-1α binds to β-catenin
  and inhibits the transcriptional activity of β-catenin but up-regulates the activity
  of HIF-1α. As a β-catenin transcriptional chaperone, TCF4 can inhibit EGLN2 to positively
  regulate aerobic glycolysis, leading to up-regulation of HIF-1α. PGAM1 mainly exists
  in cytoplasm and cell membrane and interacts with HIF-1α to positively regulate
  each other, while up-regulated PGAM1 promotes EMT of pancreatic cancer cells by
  activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Different from HIF-1α, the transcriptional
  activity of HIF-2α is upregulated after binding to β-catenin. HIF-2α could regulate
  β-catenin and SMAD4 independently in different ways. There is a competitive relationship
  between the two pathways, and HIF-2α is more inclined to up-regulate β-catenin to
  activate the classical wnt signaling pathway in the early progression of pancreatic
  cancer
