caption: Summary of the cellular responses during proteasome inhibition. Several proteasome
  inhibitors have been described targeting 19S RP, 20S proteasome and immunoproteasome.
  In response to proteasome inhibition, several responses are activated specifically
  related with the 20S proteasome, including the Autophagic-Lysosomal Pathway (ALP),
  proteaphagy, the transcriptional upregulation of the autophagy Ub receptor p62/SQSTM1,
  and proteasome genes, by Nrf1 and Nrf1/Nrf2 transcription factors, respectively.
  The activation of the autophagy Ub receptor p62/SQSTM1 is dependent on specific
  post-translational modifications based on ubiquitylation. However, it is still unknown
  which responses could be activated under the inhibition of 19S RP or immunoproteasome.
