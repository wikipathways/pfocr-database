caption: 'Oxidative stress pathways. Summarized are the two main pathways of cell
  proliferation and survival subjected to reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation:
  MAPK (orange) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR (light blue). The shared Nrf2 pathway is highlighted
  in black, while ROS regulations/interactions are visualized in red. Positive regulations
  are pictured as dotted arrows, and negative regulations are pictured as dotted truncated
  arrows. High oxidative stress is one of the key aspects that in normal conditions
  leads to cell death. HCC cells can manage ROS overproduction by activating the MAPK
  and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. The last effectors of MAPK pathways are ERK1/2, JNK,
  and p38. ERK1/2 and JNK are upregulated and lead to the transcription of genes involved
  in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration, while p38 is related
  to apoptosis and in HCC cells is downregulated. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is upregulated
  in HCC cells leading to cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration.
  ROS can regulate PI3K and AKT activities by increasing their phosphorylation or
  by decreasing PTEN levels. Both MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways have a common effector
  which is Nrf2. Nrf2 is a transcription regulator which is maintained at low levels
  by the KEAP1 protein. In the presence of high ROS levels, KEAP1 dissociates from
  Nrf2, which by this dissociation becomes capable of reaching the nucleus. Once inside
  the nucleus, Nrf2 heterodimerizes with Maf. The Nrf2/Maf heterodimer binds the antioxidant-responsive
  elements for the transcription of genes involved in cancer cell survival and growth.
  Nrf2 is also able to activate genes related to oxidant homeostasis such as glutathione
  S-transferase (GST). Abbreviations: AKT = protein kinase-B; ECM = extracellular
