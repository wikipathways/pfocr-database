caption: Extended, context‐specific melatonin receptor signalling pathways. Depending
  on the cell type or the presence of cell stressors, melatonin can activate additional
  melatonin receptor‐dependent signalling cascades. These pathways have been reported
  mainly for MT1 receptors, but the participation of MT2 receptors cannot be excluded.
  Melatonin modulation of mitochondrial function is reported under oxidative stress
  condition and in neurodegenerative diseases. Proposed signalling pathways involve
  the regulation of the activity and/or translocation of Bcl2/Bax and SIRT proteins.
  Activation of JAK2, ERK and the Akt/FOXO1 complex are suggested to mediate melatonin‐induced
  cell survival and to modulate pluripotency/differentiation of stem cells, while
  melatonin‐induced inhibition of these pathways is reported in cancer cells. MT1‐dependent
  activation of SIRT1 might underlie melatonin anti‐inflammatory and anti‐oxidative
  effects through regulation of transcription factors like Nrf2, PGC1α and NF‐κB.
  MT1‐coupling to G16 protein occurs in haematopoietic cells and triggers the JNK
  pathway. In several cell types, including cancer cells, melatonin is reported to
  modulate the expression of different miRNAs. See text for details. SIRT, sirtuin.
