caption: Depicting the possible molecular mechansims by which MitoQ prevents alcoholic
  liver disease through modulating ALDH2 posttranslational modifications. After chronic
  alcohol abuse, oxidative and nitrosative stress were increased, which impaired mitochondrial
  ALDH2 activity via cysteine S-nitrosylation, tyrosine nitration and 4-HNE adducts
  formation. Acetaldehyde accumulated in the system result in ileal tight junction
  disruption and increased plasma endotoxin and subsequently inflammatory response
  in the liver. Excess acetaldehyde accumulation in the liver leads to enhanced lipotoxicity,
  ER stress and cell apoptosis pathway activation. MitoQ supplementation prevented
  alcohol-induced ALDH2 posttranslational modifications and accelerated acetaldehyde
  clearance, which against alcohol-induced pathogenesis at the gut-liver axis.
