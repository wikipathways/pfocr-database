caption: Summarization of the role of IDH1 mutants and 2-HG signaling in cellular
  pathway. IDH1 mutants inhibit its normal catalytic activity and acquire the ability
  to convert α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). 2-HG competitively
  inhibited multiple α-KG-dependent enzymes, including prolylhydroxylases (PHD) and
  histone demethylases.
