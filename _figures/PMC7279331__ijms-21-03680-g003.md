caption: Model of calmodulin and protein kinase C (PKC) modulating critical features
  of KRas-driven tumourigenesis. This hypothetical model is based on studies comparing
  the impact of pharmacological compounds modulating PKC or calmodulin activity in
  a variety of cell models expressing wild-type or oncogenic and constitutively active
  KRas (KRasG12V) containing Ser181-phosphomimetic or non-phosphorylatable mutants
  (see  for further details) [,,,,,]. (1) Ca2+/calmodulin binding to the polybasic
  region (PBR) within the hypervariable region (HVR) of KRas inhibits PKC-mediated
  Ser181 phosphorylation of KRas (P-Ser181) by sterical hindrance. Complex formation
  of calmodulin with (active) KRas-GTP may segregate KRas to membrane microdomains
  where KRas-GTP could be more susceptible to GTPase activating protein (GAP)-mediated
  KRas inactivation. This ensures KRas inactivation and termination of KRas-GTP-mediated
  activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) effector pathways. (2) Low Ca2+ levels
  disrupt KRas/calmodulin interaction and favor PKC-mediated Ser181 phosphorylation
  of KRas. (3) This allows a conformational change in P-Ser181 KRas and is followed
  by its segregation to distinct plasma membrane microdomains or endosomal membranes
  (omitted in this scheme), where interaction and activation of effectors like PI3K
  can occur. (4) Ser181 phosphorylation of oncogenic KRas (KRasG12V) triggers PI3K
  and Akt-dependent anti-apoptotic signals driven by B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl2) and
  mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) that promote survival and cell growth,
  respectively. (5) PI3K also activates Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rac1
  GEFs) that promote activation of Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) on plasma (or endosomal) membranes
  (dashed lines). The membrane location of phosphatidyl-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) and
  phospharidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) is indicated. (6) Alternatively,
  active KRas (KRas-GTP) can directly associate with a Rac1-GEF to activate Rac1.
  (7) Vice versa, active Rac1-GTP and its effector Pak1 have been suggested to facilitate
  Ser338 Raf1 phosphorylation and activation, which affects proliferation along the
  Raf1/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. (8) Rac1-GTP drives actin
  dynamics linked to cell migration. (9) These complex regulatory networks are highlighted
  by the requirement of Rac1 activity in KRas-driven cancers (see  for further details).
  Overall, Ser181 phosphorylation of oncogenic KRas is at the forefront of multiple
  signalling pathways that are fundamental to cellular events that drive tumour growth
  and metastasis. This can be counteracted by KRas/calmodulin complex formation, providing
  a potential tool to reduce signal output of oncogenic KRas.
