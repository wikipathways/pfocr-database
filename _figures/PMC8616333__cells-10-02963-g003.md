caption: 'Role of lysophospholipids in metabolic pathways. Cell injury leads to activation
  of cPLA2 and NF-kB pathway and transcriptional increase in sPLA2. Activation of
  sPLA2 and cPLA2 result in the release of ARA and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC).
  LPC is converted to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) via the extracellular autotaxin.
  LPA interacts with G-protein receptors to regulate cell metabolism. Abbreviations:
  4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells (NF-kB), reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitogen-activated protein kinases
  (MAPK).'
