caption: Global view of Pathway – Disease system (P-D) network; Bipartite graph representing
  the pathways as central nodes coloured and sized by their connectivity to peripheral
  nodes of disease system at organ level. Higher degree of connectivity is implied
  as big red node as compare to small green node with lower degree of connectivity
