caption: 'A model of caffeine, AR signaling pathway, AHR signaling pathways, and human
  circadian clock. (A) Caffeine alters intracellular cAMP levels through binding to
  adenosine receptors (A1, A2A, A2B and A3) and inhibiting phosphodiesterases. In
  addition, caffeine mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum through
  activation of the RyR channels. Increased cytosolic cAMP/Ca2+signaling culminates
  CREB activation acting in tandem with rhythmic transcriptional activation by CLOCK/BMAL1.
  CLOCK/BMAL1 binds to E-box elements in the PER promoter, where they act to stimulate
  PER transcription. (B) Inactive AHR complexes with HSP90, AIP, p23 and SRC in the
  cytosol. Upon agonist binding, AHR and some components of the chaperone complex
  translocate to the nucleus, where AHR forms a dimer with ARNT binding to the XRE
  to control gene expression (such as AHRR, CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1). (C) Activated
  AHR can physically interact with BMAL1, which exhibits high homology with ARNT,
  thereby reducing CLOCK-BMAL1 interactions and repressing PER transcription. In addition,
  activated AHR phosphorylates and activates JNK, which represses CRE-mediated transcriptional
  activity to suppress PER transcription (left). Rhythmic transcription of AHR is
  driven by CLOCK: BMAL1 at E-Box promoter elements. PER and CRY inhibit AHR transcript
  levels (right). Abbreviation: cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; RyR, ryanodine
  receptor; PDEs, phosphodiesterases; AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; AHRR, AHR repressor;
  ARNT, AHR nuclear translocator; XRE, xenobiotic response element; HSP90, 90 kDa
  heat shock protein; AIP, AHR-interacting protein. CLOCK, circadian locomotor output
  cycles kaput; BMAL1, brain and muscle ARNT-Like 1; CREB, cAMP response element-binding;
