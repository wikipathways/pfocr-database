  species derived from the eukaryotic pathway are shown in gray (sn-1/sn-2, C18/C18
  or C16/C18); glycerolipids originating from the prokaryotic pathway are in green
  (sn-1/sn-2, C18/C16). Blue arrows denote trends associated with increase in growth
  temperature, whereas the orange arrow indicates changes associated with decrease
  in growth temperature. Higher temperature suppresses the prokaryotic pathway and
  promotes lipid trafficking from the  to chloroplast.  moieties of C18/C18 and 16:0/C18
  derived from the  are differentially transported to the chloroplast for the biosynthesis
  of  and . Higher temperature induces the trafficking of  (16:0/C18), while lower
  temperature stimulates the channeling of  (C18/C18). FAD2, FAD5, and ACT1 are key
  genes influencing fatty acid flux sharing between the two glycerolipid pathways.
