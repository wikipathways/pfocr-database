caption: Simplified pathway of polyamine synthesis from ornithine is indicated by
  solid arrows and polyamine catabolism by broken arrows. ODC is regulated by OAZ
  whose translation is turned on by +1 ribosomal frame shifting at a high concentration
  of polyamines. OAZ is in turn regulated by AZIN, which is an ODC-like protein, but
  devoid of the enzyme activity.
