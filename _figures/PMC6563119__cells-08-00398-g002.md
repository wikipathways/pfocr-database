caption: Cellular components of the mammalian immune system. The mammalian immune
  system consists of two distinct parts, innate and adaptive immunity. Basophils,
  eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, and dendritic
  cells mediate the innate immunity. They provide the first line of defense against
  bacteria, viruses, and cancer. The adaptive immune system refers to an antigen-specific
  defense mechanism that takes several days to develop but provides long-lasting protection.
  The adaptive immune system includes B cell-mediated humoral immunity and T cell-mediated
  cellular immunity, both of which are directed towards the specific antigens. Macrophages
  and dendritic cells are unique subsets that have both innate and adaptive immune
  cell traits. As professional antigen-presenting cells, macrophages and dendritic
  cells are critical in the induction of adaptive immunity by presenting the antigens
  to antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes.
