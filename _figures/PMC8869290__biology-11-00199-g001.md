caption: Schematic representation of glycoprotein ERQC. First, mature G3M9GN2 glycan
  is attached to newly ribosome-synthesized polypeptide by the action of oligosaccharyltransferase
  (OST) complex. Subsequently, glucosidase I and II sequentially trim two glucose
  residues, yielding G1M9GN2 glycoproteins. This glycan structure is critical to protein
  folding of glycoproteins. Namely, calnexin (CNX) and its soluble homologue calreticulin
  (CRT) capture G1M9GN2 polypeptides by its lectin activity, and their complex with
  protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) accelerates protein folding of G1M9GN2 glycoproteins.
  Next, outermost glucose residues of G1M9GN2 glycoproteins are trimmed by glucosidase
  II, and folding states of resultant M9GN2 glycoproteins are checked by a folding
  sensor enzyme (UGGT1). Once UGGT1 determined folding intermediates, the enzyme re-transfers
  a single glucose residue to A-branch of M9GN2-glycoproteins. This regenerating G1M9GN2
  folding intermediate obtains a refolding opportunity by the CNX/CRT-PDIs complex.
  This cycle system, referred to as the CNX/CRT cycle, can maximize protein folding
  in the ER. After the sensing process, M9GN2 glycoproteins become substrate of mannosidases
  in the ER (EDEM1, EDEM2 and EDEM3). A major pathway in mammalian cells is mannose-trimming
  of M8BGN2 from M9GN2 by the action of EDEM2, and subsequent mannose-trimmings by
  EDEM3/EDEM1 generate M7AGN2 and further trimmed oligomannose-type glycan. On the
  other hand, whether M8AGN2 and M8CGN2-glycoproteins are generated in the ER is still
  under investigation. Although it is believed that the M8AGN2 and M8CGN2 are mainly
  generated by the action of Golgi mannosidases in vivo, based on the in vitro branch
  specificity of EDEMs [,], EDEM1 or EDEM3 may mediate the process. However, further
  evidence in vivo and in vitro is necessary. At least, results of total cellular
  glycan analysis of MAN1B1-CDG patient indicate that M8AGN2 exists and M6isoGN2 is
  accumulating in patients’ cells, though where these glycans are produced originally
  is unclear []. Collectively, based on in vitro ER lectins and enzymes specificity
  [,,], it is considered that M8BGN2 and M8AGN2 can act as secretion signal and degradation
  signal precursor, respectively. To consider this possibility in vivo, further evidence
  is necessary. 3D structures of CRT, glucosidase II and UGGT1 are visualized by Waals
  software. The PDB IDs of the structures are 5F0E for glucosidase II [], 6ENY for
  CRT [], and 5N2J for UGGT1 [].
