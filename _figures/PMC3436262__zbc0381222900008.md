caption: The occluded nucleotide conformation in the P-glycoprotein catalytic pathway.
  From Ref. . Each half-circle represents an NBD. The occluded nucleotide conformation
  occurs as a closed NBD dimer at step III, with the ATP that is tightly bound and
  committed to hydrolysis shown in boldface. Steps inhibited by mutations and covalent
  reagents or accelerated by drug are shown. NBD-Cl, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole;
  NEM, N-ethylmaleimide.
