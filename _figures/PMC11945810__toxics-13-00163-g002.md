caption: Illustration of cell crosstalk and molecular pathways of different chemicals
  in the liver microenvironment. Pollutants such as persistent organic pollutants
  (POPs) and microplastics, upon reaching the liver through inhalation or dietary
  intake, trigger complex cellular interactions. POPs upregulate lipid biosynthesis
  pathways such as SREBP-1c and PPAR-γ, disrupting lipid homeostasis, inhibiting fatty
  acid β-oxidation, and causing excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Pollutants
  also activate the AhR signaling pathway, leading to the overexpression of metabolic
  enzymes like CYP1A1, exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction and promoting ROS generation.
  The resulting oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage initiate hepatocyte apoptosis
  and the release of DAMPs, such as HMGB1 and extracellular ATP. These DAMPs subsequently
  activate immune cells, amplifying tissue damage. Through the activation of TLEs
  and NLRs in Kupffer cells, downstream signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK,
  are stimulated, enhancing pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Inflammatory mediators
  recruit peripheral immune cells such as monocytes and neutrophils to the liver,
  further aggravating tissue inflammation and hepatocyte injury. DAMPs released by
  damaged hepatocytes, in conjunction with pro-fibrotic cytokines secreted by activated
  Kupffer cells, synergistically induce the activation of hematopoietic stem cells,
  leading to excessive ECM protein production and activation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling
  cascade. This impedes hepatocyte regeneration and repair, exacerbating liver fibrosis.
  The interactions between hepatic parenchymal cells and immune cells drive inflammation,
  metabolic signaling networks, and immune stress responses
