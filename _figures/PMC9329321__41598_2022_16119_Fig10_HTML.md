caption: Mechanistic illustration of the effect of STVNa on FFA-induced NAFLD. STVNa
  increased SIRT1 expression, thus promoting lipid metabolism and inhibiting cellular
  ROS overload. In addition, STVNa reduced P62 expression, thereby inducing autophagy
  activation. Small lipid droplets are engulfed by LC3-II positive membranes, indicating
  that autophagy can degrade lipid droplets. Lipid cargoes are delivered to lysosomes
  for degradation by acid hydrolases. FFAs are transported into the cytosol and undergo
  mitochondrial β-oxidation for energy supply. These two mechanisms work together
  to reduce fat, thus improving NAFLD.
