caption: Pathway for CoQ biosynthesis in eukaryotes. Proteins involved in the biosynthetic
  pathway of CoQ are named as COQs (in capital letters). The isoprenyl tail proceeds
  from the mevalonate pathway and takes part in extramitochondrial membranes. COQ1
  is the last enzyme of the pathway and defines the numbers (n) of isoprene units
  in the polyprenyl tail which is 6 for S. cerevisiae, 8 for E. coli, 9 in C. elegans,
  and 10 in humans. The redox-active head of CoQ (pHB, para-hydroxybenzoate) is synthesized
  from tyrosine in the cytosol and linked to the polyprenylated tail by COQ2 in mitochondria.
  The rest of the proteins are located inside this organelle and are responsible for
  modifications in the redox-active head of CoQ. COQ6 and COQ7 are hydroxylases, COQ3
  and COQ5 are methylases, COQ4, COQ8, COQ9, and COQ10 are proteins with unknown function.
  DMQ (2-polyprenyl-3-methyl-6-metoxy-1,4-benzoquinol) is an intermediate compound
  of the biosynthetic pathway that is accumulated without the presence of an active
  COQ7 hydroxylase. CoQ is finally synthesized as ubiquinol (the reduced form of CoQ).
