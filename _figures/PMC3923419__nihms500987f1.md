caption: 'H2S biosynthesis and degradation, along with a comparison of pathways that
  contribute to protein S-sulfhydration and S-nitrosylation. The schematic depicts
  enzymatic pathways that are responsible for endogenous H2S production, formation
  of low-molecular-weight and proteinaceous persulfides and the mitochondrial pathway
  for persulfide degradation. Notably, in addition to endogenous mammalian enzymes,
  sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) of the colon are major contributors to H2S generation
  in vivo. Abbreviations: CSE, cystathionine γ-lyase; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase
  ; MST, mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase; SQR, sulfide quinone reductase; ETHE1,
  persulfide dioxygenase; TST, thiosulfate sulfur transferase (a.k.a. rhodanese).'
