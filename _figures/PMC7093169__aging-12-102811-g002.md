caption: The molecular mechanisms driving renal fibrosis are wide-ranging and complex,
  among which signaling pathways are very important. The common signaling pathways
  activated in adiponectin-mediated renal fibrosis are the AMPK and peroxisome proliferators-activated
  receptors (PPARs) pathway.
