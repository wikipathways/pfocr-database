caption: The proposed schematic representation of the immune response to MERS-CoV
  infection and how the invading virus is processed during an infection. (1) MERS-CoV
  infects macrophages through DPP4 binding, and then macrophages present MERS-CoV
  antigens to Th0 cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation,
  including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets
  (i.e., Th1, Th2, and Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune
  response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due to viral
  persistence has a negative effect on Th0, NK, and CD8 T cell activation by inhibiting
  IL12 and IFN-γ production. However, CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators,
  such as IFN-γ and granzyme, to clear MERS-CoV. It is still unclear whether long-term
  or short-term protective antibodies are produced during neutralizing antibody production
  against MERS-CoV. (2) Attachment of MERS-CoV to DPP4 on the host cell through S
  protein leads to the appearance of genomic RNA in the cytoplasm. An immune response
  to dsRNA can be partially generated during MERS-CoV replication. TLR-3 sensitized
  by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NF-κB activation via TRAF3
  and TRAF6, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs and proinflammatory
  cytokines. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of
  antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory
  proteins of MERS-CoV can interfere with TLR-3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of MERS-CoV
  during replication to prevent TLR-3 activation and evade the immune response. TLR-4
  might recognize S protein and lead to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines
  through the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. Virus-cell interactions lead to strong
  production of immune mediators. The secretion of large quantities of chemokines
  and cytokines (MCP-1, IL10, and CXCL10) is promoted in infected cells in response
  to MERS-CoV infection. These chemokines and cytokines in turn recruit lymphocytes
  and leukocytes to the site of infection. Red arrows refer to inhibitory effects.
  Black arrows refer to activating effects.
