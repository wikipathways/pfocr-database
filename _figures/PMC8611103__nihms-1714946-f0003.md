caption: 'Interactome changes as identified by epichaperomics following individual
  AD- and AD-relevant model stressor conditions via Venn diagram and Reactome pathway
  enrichment analyses. In the Venn diagram (center), each circle represents the number
  of proteins whose connectivity is significantly affected by each stressor. In the
  Reactome maps, generated in Cytoscape, each circle represents a function (i.e.,
  a protein pathway). The center Reactome map is a merged map depiction of all four
  individual stressor conditions (left- and right-side panels). If the circle is divided
  into blue, yellow, red and green segments, it means all four stressors (or stressors
  characteristic of each condition) mediate imbalances in the select pathway. An exclusively
  red circle indicates the pathway alteration is AD-specific. Key: human brains (sporadic
  late-onset AD vs NCI), iPSC-derived neurons (APP duplication vs WT), transgenic
  mouse brains (PS19 vs WT), and cellular models of human tau toxicity (N2a cells
  overexpressing human tau vs N2a cells with vector only). Figure adapted from [].'
