caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes unique to emerin-null
  cells during transition from day 1 to day 2 of differentiation. A, The Actin-Cytoskeleton
  signaling pathway was identified as a top canonical pathway in emerin-null cells.
  The network was generated through the use of IPA (Ingenuity Systems www.ingenuity.com)
  on normalized mRNA values. Nodes represent molecules in a pathway, while the biological
  relationship between nodes is represented by a line (edge). Edges are supported
  by at least one reference in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The intensity of color
  in a node indicates the degree of up- (red) or down- (green) regulation. Nodes are
  displayed using shapes that represent the functional class of a gene product (Circle
  = Other, Nested Circle = Group or Complex, Rhombus = Peptidase, Square = Cytokine,
  Triangle = Kinase, Vertical ellipse = Transmembrane receptor). Edges are marked
  with symbols to represent the relationship between nodes (Line only = Binding only,
  Flat line = inhibits, Solid arrow = Acts on, Solid arrow with flat line = inhibits
  and acts on, Open circle = leads to, Open arrow = translocates to). B, Biological
  Function Analysis with IPA on genes differentially expressed only in emerin-null
  cells during the transition from day 1 to day 2 of differentiation identified the
  activation of differentiation of muscle cells (p-value: <0.001; Z-score: 1.263).
  The figure represents genes that are associated with a particular biological function
  that are altered in the uploaded dataset. Genes that are up-regulated are displayed
  within red nodes and those down-regulated are displayed within green nodes. The
  intensity of the color in a node indicates the degree of up-(red) or down-(green)
  regulation. The shapes of the nodes reflect the functional class of each gene product:
  transcriptional regulator (horizontal ellipse), transmembrane receptor (vertical
  ellipse), enzyme (vertical rhombus), cytokine/growth factor (square), kinase (inverted
  triangle) and complex/group/other (circle). An orange line indicates predicted upregulation,
  whereas a blue line indicates predicted downregulation. A yellow line indicates
  expression being contradictory to the prediction. Gray line indicates that direction
  of change is not predicted. Solid or broken edges indicate direct or indirect relationship,
  respectively.'
