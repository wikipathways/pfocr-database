caption: Working model of chloroplast photorelocation movements. The photoreceptors
  phot1 and phot2 mediate the accumulation response under a low light condition through
  RPT2 and NCH1. RPT2 and NCH1 might regulate both JAC1-dependent and -independent
  (X) pathways. The signaling pathway by RPT2/NCH1 and JAC1 suppresses that of the
  avoidance response under a low light condition. Under the high light condition,
  the WEB1/PMI2 complex suppresses the signaling pathway for the accumulation response
  that is regulated by RPT2/NCH1 and JAC1 through an unknown mechanism, resulting
  in the efficient induction of the avoidance response mediated by phot2. Gray arrows
  indicate the suppressed signaling pathways. Black arrows indicate the activated
  signaling pathways.
