caption: The role of (Rspo)s in canonical Wnt signaling pathway and the general architecture
  of (Rspo)s. (a) Schematic diagram of Wnt and R-spondin signaling models. In absence
  of Wnt ligand, constitutively synthesized cytoplasmic β-catenin is destroyed by
  the β-catenin destruction complex causing no β-catenin complex formation with T-cell
  transcription factor (Tcf)/Lef transcription factors for an active transcriptional
  response. Canonical Wnt signaling is instigated by the binding of Wnt ligands to
  the frizzled/LRP receptor complex which in turn deactivates the β-catenin destruction
  complex increasing its concentration in cytoplasm. The Wnt-frizzled/LRP complex-induced
  cytoplasmic buildup of β-catenin leads to its import into the nucleus and binding
  to (Tcf)/Lef transcription factors initiating transcription of Wnt targeted genes.
  (Rspo)s also act in similar manner but induce this unique property of enhancing
  Wnt activity by binding to recently discovered seven transmembrane G protein coupled
  receptors, Lgr (4, 5, and 6). (b) Schematic diagram shows the general domain architecture
  of human (Rspo)s. The architecture shows (i) signal peptide at N terminal end, (ii)
  two cysteine-rich furin-like repeats/domains, (iii) a single thrombospondin domain,
  and (iv) a basic amino-acid-rich domain at C-terminal basic region.
