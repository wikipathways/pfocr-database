caption: 'Heart analysis. (A) Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network generated
  with STRING from DEGs in the heart. The network is composed of 482 nodes and connected
  with 754 edges (p-value of 1.0 e-16). The edges might be drawn in seven different
  colors indicating different type of evidence (Red line - fusion evidence; Green
  line - neighborhood evidence; Blue line - cooccurrence evidence; Purple line - experimental
  evidence; Yellow line - textmining evidence; Light blue line - database evidence;
  Black line - coexpression evidence). See also high resolution panel A in Supplementary
  information . (B) The graph shows the results of the pathway enrichment analyses
  for the DEGs obtained from the heart. The bars depict the negative logarithm of
  the false discovery rate (FDR). (C) Genes with the highest degree of connectivity
  obtained from the PPI network with Cytoscape. D.I–IV) Top modules obtained from
  the PPI network using Cytoscape’s plugin MCODE (Red nodes: Upregulated in hepta
  KO mice; Green nodes: Downregulated in heptaKO mice).'
