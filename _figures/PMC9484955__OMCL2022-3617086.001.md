caption: Mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated apoptosis and necroptosis. Oxidative stress
  injury is the main mechanism of decreased defense function caused by increased mitochondrial
  ROS generation and decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD/GSH/CAT.
  When myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, and other pathological changes occur, dysfunction
  in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation leads to mitochondrial respiratory chain
  damage, which directly or indirectly damages myocardial cells. Mitochondrial oxygen
  free radicals can regulate cellular signal transduction pathways, causing lipid
  peroxidation, protein function inhibition, and G protein-effector coupling dysregulation,
  resulting in heart failure. Additionally, the ROS can mediate apoptosis through
  the caspase pathway. It can inhibit cardiac diastolic and systolic function by modifying
  myocardial myofibrillar proteins through ROS oxidation, resulting in decreased cardiac
  function. ROS can also regulate the activity of NF-κB, thereby activating the signaling
  pathway that induces cardiac hypertrophy and the transcriptional expression of related
  genes. Mitochondria can also maintain calcium balance in the body by uptake and
  excretion of Ca2+. The concentration of mitochondrial Ca2+ plays substantial role
  in the generation of mitochondrial ATP, the permeability of ion channels, and the
  regulation of calcium signal transduction pathways. The number of mitochondria is
  reduced in exhausted cardiomyocytes, and the uptake capacity of the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum is reduced. Consequently, the cellular accumulation Ca2+ becomes excessive,
  which in turn affects the oxidative phosphorylation process, thereby reducing ATP
  synthesis and inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis through the caspase pathway. When
  calcium overload occurs, excessive cytoplasmic Ca2+ is taken up by the mitochondria,
  the mitochondrial membrane potential decreases, the osmotic transport channels are
  opened, ATP consumption increases, and myocardial injury occurs. Decreased calcium
  content in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiomyocytes leads to impaired calcium
  release and weakened myocardial contractility aggravating the degree of heart failure.
  Increased Ca2+ concentration will activate calcium ion-dependent protein kinases
  and phospholipases, degrade membrane phospholipids and structural proteins, and
  increase mitochondrial membrane permeability, causing mitochondrial deformation
  and swelling. This affects ATP synthesis and aggravates energy metabolism disorders.
