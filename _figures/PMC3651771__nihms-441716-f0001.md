caption: A. Mature forms (lacking their signal peptides) of mouse and human Sdc1 are
  shown depicting their extracellular, transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic (CYTO) domains
  along with the numbering of their amino acid sequences. The site in the extracellular
  domain of mouse Sdc1 that captures αvβ3/αvβ5 integrin and IGF1R is amino acids 92-119
  []. A highly homologous site (amino acids 93-120) exists in human. The amino acid
  sequence of SSTN derived from either human or mouse is shown, with nonconserved
  amino acids shown in gray (human sequence). B. Sdc1 ectodomain engages the αvβ3
  or αvβ5 integrin, providing a docking site for the IGF1R. IGF1R becomes activated
  when Sdc1 is clustered by ECM engagement, or upon its binding of IGF-1 []. Active
  IGF1R initiates an inside-out signaling pathway culminating in the activation of
  talin []. Combined signaling from the integrin and IGF1R drives the proliferation,
  survival and migration of tumor cells and activated endothelial cells that depend
  on this ternary receptor complex. Capture of the integrin and IGF1R by Sdc1 is competitively
  blocked by SSTN92-119. Treatment of cells with this peptide displaces the receptors
  from the syndecan and prevents IGF1R and integrin activation. Even addition of IGF1,
  which causes IGF1R activation as measured by Y1131 in its cytoplasmic domain, fails
  to activate the integrin in the presence of SSTN []. Thus, assembly of the receptors
  into the ternary receptor complex is essential for integrin activation by IGF1R
  and the combined signaling from this receptor complex.
