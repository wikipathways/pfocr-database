caption: Schematic layout depicting that NGF defends neuroblastoma against cell death
  triggered by Aβ25–35 via suppression of ROS–JNK/c‐Jun pathway activation through
  the Nrf2/HO‐1 pathway. NGF increases Nrf2 nuclear translocation and promotes expression
  of HO‐1. NGF decreases ROS concentration, which impairs the stimulation of the JNK/c‐Jun
  signaling pathway and results in a decrease in apoptosis.
