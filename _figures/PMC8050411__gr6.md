caption: Enriched canonical pathway of IFN transcriptomic pathway identified by IPA,
  showing gene expression and predicted relationships between molecules differentially
  regulated by 311 nm UVB 18 h after irradiation. 311 nm UVB DEG expression and molecular
  relationships between 311 nm UVB DEGs predicted by using IPA molecular activity
  predictor using our transcriptomic data of 795 (18 h) DEGs. Transcriptomic data
  associated with apoptosis was applied to the IFN signalling pathway to identify
  any interconnectivity between IFN signalling and apoptosis. Blue lines between DEGs
  represent predicted inhibition between genes and orange represent predicted activation
  between DEGs based on our transcriptomic data. Red symbols denote increased gene
  expression. Each symbol shape represents a different molecule type. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)
