caption: Panel A shows how donor MHC class I cross-dressing of a recipient APC might
  promote cooperation between CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ T effector cells by having
  self-MHC class II + donor peptide (indirect presentation) and donor MHC class I
  co-presented on the same APC (semi-direct presentation) (three cell cluster).Panel
  B shows how simultaneous presentation of intact donor MHC molecules (semi-direct
  pathway) and self-MHC class II bound to a donor peptide (indirect pathway) or a
  self-peptide on the same recipient APC can promote interaction between regulatory
  CD4+ Tregs and effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In this scenario, it is possible
  that Tregs can suppress effector T cells displaying the same self-MHC class II-peptide
  complex as recipient APCs (T-T interaction). In this setting, effector T cells are
  specific for donor MHC while Tregs are not donor specific but interact with self-MHC
  class II-peptide complexes on activated effector T cells.
