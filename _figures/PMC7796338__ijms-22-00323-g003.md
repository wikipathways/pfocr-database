caption: Carbohydrate and lipid moieties based post-translational modification. Carbohydrates
  based PTMs includes glycosylation and ADP ribosylation. Glycosylation plays a role
  in enhancing viral replication by increasing receptor binding, protein solubilization,
  virulence, and antigenicity of viral proteins. Glycosylation is also involved in
  the inhibition of viral replication. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binds to non-self
  glycoproteins such as viral proteins, activates the complement pathway, and inhibits
  viral replication. PARPs (Poly ADP ribose polymerases) mediated ADP ribosylation
  of viral proteins targets them for degradation, thus acting as anti-viral. The modification
  also works as pro-viral by targeting protein involved in the immune response during
  viral infection. Viruses also favors their growth by removing the ADP ribosylation,
  thereby favoring growth. Lipid molecules such as palmitoylation, myristoylation,
  and prenylation. The modifications favors viral replication by assisting in viral
  assembly. In contrast, these inhibit viral replication by triggering IFN response,
  bind to viral RNA, and inhibit viral replication or block membrane fusion.
