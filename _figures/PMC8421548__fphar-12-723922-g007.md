caption: Schematic diagram of the potential mechanism by which salidroside protects
  against IH-induced ROS overproduction and barrier disruption in the endothelium.
  Salidroside increased intracellular cAMP levels, which subsequently activated PKA
  in HUVECs. Activated cAMP/PKA suppressed IH-induced elevation of RhoA and ROCK,
  and thereafter inhibited ROS generation. In turn, reduced ROS production inhibited
  RhoA/ROCK expression, breaking the vicious cycle of ROS augmentation induced by
  IH in the endothelium. IH, intermittent hypoxia; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RhoA,
  ras homolog gene family member A; ROCK, Rho-associated protein kinase; PKA, protein
  kinase A.
