caption: Current representation of tobacco alkaloid biosynthetic pathway. Enzymes
  highlighted in pink or blue background are those whose corresponding genes were
  either down-regulated or up-regulated, respectively, in genotypes with nic1/nic2
  or myc2a alleles. Suppression or activation effects of nic1/nic2 or myc2a alleles
  are further represented by red or blue text, with corresponding up or down arrows
  indicating the direction of regulation for better illustration

  nearly isogenic tobacco lines possessing alternative allelic combinations at the
  Nic1, Nic2, and Myc2a loci
