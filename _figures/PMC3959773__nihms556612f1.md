caption: 'The mitochondrial respiratory chain. Electrons derived from cellular dehydrogenases
  in the Krebs cycle and in β-oxidation spirals are passed ‘horizontally’ along four
  protein complexes and two small carriers (the electron transport chain) that are
  embedded in the MIM. The electrons travel from complex I (an NADH dehydrogenase)
  and complex II (a succinate dehydrogenase) to CoQ10 (a small mobile electron carrier
  also known as ubiquinone), then to complex III (ubiquinone oxidoreductase), cytochrome
  c (another small mobile electron carrier) and complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase),
  ultimately producing water. Concomitant with this horizontal flow of electrons,
  ‘vertical’ vectorial transport of dehydrogenase-derived protons from the matrix
  across the MIM into the intermembrane space takes place. This process creates an
  electrochemical proton gradient across the MIM that is used to drive complex V (F0F1-ATP
  synthase), a rotary motor that converts ADP to ATP. Conventionally, the five complexes
  comprise the oxidative phosphorylation system. The biosynthetic pathway of CoQ10,
  beginning with acetyl-CoA, is shown on the right; mutated biosynthetic genes that
  cause deficiency are show in bold text. Abbreviations: ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator;
  CACT, carnitine–primary CoQ10 acylcarnitine translocator; CoA, coenzyme A; CoQ10,

  electron-transfer flavoprotein; ETF-DH, ETF-dehydrogenase; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide;
