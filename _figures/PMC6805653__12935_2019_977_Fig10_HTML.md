caption: The molecular mechanism of miR-129-5p regulation of ZIC2 expression and the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in PCa. In PCa, the expression of miR-129-5p was
  significantly decreased, while the expression of ZIC2 was significantly increased.
  miR-129-5p targeted ZIC2 and inhibited the expression of ZIC2. The up-regulated
  miR-129-5p could suppresses the expression of ZIC2, leading to reduced expression
  of Wnt, β-catenin, N-cadherin and vimentin with increase in E-cadherin expression.
  Eventually, up-regulated miR-129-5p significantly inhibited cell proliferation,
  migration, invasion and EMT while promoting PCa cell apoptosis

  role of microRNA-129-5p in epithelial–mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis of
  prostate cancer by targeting ZIC2.
