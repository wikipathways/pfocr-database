caption: 'Host cell glycolytic pathway hijacked by viruses: The process starts with
  the intake of glucose into the cell, metabolism to G-6-P (glucose-6-phosphate) and
  then to pyruvate. Pyruvate is converted into lactate via glycolysis, which is then
  secreted out of the cell or Acetyl CoA (AcCoA) which is taken up by TCA cycle. Different
  viruses confiscating the glycolysis steps are shown in green. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
