caption: Schematic representation of the glyoxalase pathway involved in MG detoxification
  and the effect of various reaction substrates on the regulation of the pathway.
  ↑ indicates positive signalling while ↓ indicates negative signalling of the GLYI
  and GLYII proteins. Different colours of arrows represents regulation by respective
  metabolites. The table on the right summarizes these regulations by respective substrates.
