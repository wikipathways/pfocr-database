caption: Model of antibody-induced intracellular signaling that leads to the host
  antiviral response. Because SINV buds from the plasma membrane, SINV E2 glycoprotein
  is present in high concentrations on the surface of infected neurons. Bivalent antibody
  binding of SINV E2 results in cross-linking of E2 molecules that induces rapid transient
  canonical NF-κB pathway activation. NF-κB induces expression of the IL-6 family
  cytokine LIF that, in turn, acts in a paracrine and/or autocrine manner to induce
  sustained, protective STAT3 pathway activation. Antibody cross-linking of E2 also
  results in the aggregation of surface LIFR that amplifies the effects of LIF binding
  in infected neurons.
