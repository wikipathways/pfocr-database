caption: Feed-forward regulation of ABA signaling mediated VP1 and ABI3. A,  Feed-forward
  regulation of ABA signaling mediated by VP1 is mediated by the  pathway proposed
  by Finkelstein and colleagues  (;  ). In  addition, ABA induces two negative regulators
  of ABA signaling, ABI1  and ABI2, enabling feedback regulation of ABA signaling  (;  ;  ).
  These  signaling pathways are shown with dotted lines. VP1 inhibits ABA induction
  of  the negative regulators, potentiating further enhancement of ABA sensitivity  (shown
  with bold line). B, Northern analysis of ABI1, ABI2,  and ABI5 gene expression in
  maturing siliques of wild type  (Col) and abi3-6. Total RNA samples were isolated
  from the  late stage of developing siliques. Fifteen micrograms of the total RNA
  was  hybridized with the indicated probes.
