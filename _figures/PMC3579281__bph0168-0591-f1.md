caption: Simplified overview of inflammation-orchestrated signal transduction that
  induces pro-tumourigenic responses in glioblastoma. GBM tissue and microenvironment
  contains high levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8. Binding of IL-6 and IL-8 to IL-6/gp130
  complex and GPCRs (CXCR1/2), respectively, leads to the activation (phosphorylation)
  of JAK2 that stimulates rapid, transient activation of STAT3 transcription factor.
  PI3K–Akt pathway is also a downstream target of CXCR1/2. IL-1β via its receptor
  IL-1R is a well-known p38 MAPK and JNK activating cytokine. Upon activation, p38
  MAPK and JNK induce the activation of key oncogenic transcription factors NFκB and
  AP-1 or post-transcriptional gene regulation. This includes p38 MAPK-dependent HuR-shuttling
  and Mnk1/2 activation, leading to the control of mRNA stability and protein translation.
  Via these mechanisms, inflammation-activated JAK2, p38 MAPK and JNK signalling pathways
  are linked to proliferation, invasiveness, angiogenesis, stemness and tumour growth
  in GBM pathophysiology. Furthermore, JAK2 and JNK2 are also activated by EGFR and
  constitutively active EGFRvIII. Persistent activation JAK2 and JNK2 pathways via
  these growth factor receptors possibly contributes to the inflammation-driven GBM
  progression.
