caption: Negative regulation and fine-tuning of VEGFR2-mediated signaling pathways.
  a VE-PTP regulates TIE2 and VEGFR2 dephosphorylation to balance angiogenic signaling
  and support vessel integrity. Activin A enhances VE-PTP expression and reduces VEGF-induced
  permeability, which may help control excessive vessel leakage in conditions such
  as diabetic retinopathy. b PTP1B regulates VEGFR2 signaling by binding to its cytoplasmic
  domain and dephosphorylating it, thereby acting as a negative regulator. c SHP1
  acts as a negative regulator of VEGFR2 by dephosphorylating key tyrosine residues
  (Y996, Y1059, and Y1175) essential for endothelial cell proliferation. d TSP-1 modulates
  VEGFR2 activity by binding to CD36 and recruiting SHP1, which dephosphorylates VEGFR2
  at Y1175. This action suppresses VEGF signaling and inhibits angiogenesis. e Notch
  signaling coordinates angiogenesis by balancing the roles of tip and stalk cells.
  Dll4 on tip cells activates Notch in stalk cells, reducing VEGFR expression and
  VEGF sensitivity to stabilize newly formed vessels. Fringe, a glycosyltransferase
  in stalk cells, enhances Dll4-Notch signaling, further reducing VEGFR levels and
  reinforcing stalk cell quiescence. Meanwhile, Jagged1 counteracts Dll4 by modulating
  Notch in stalk cells, allowing some cells to remain responsive to VEGF, supporting
  sprouting. This interplay ensures selective sprouting while maintaining vessel stability.
  Notably, the Notch-VEGFR3 pathway can also promote angiogenesis independently of
  VEGF-A/VEGFR2. VE-PTP vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase, VEGFR vascular
