caption: 'Regulation of autophagy and autophagy levels in different types of cells
  involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. (A) Regulation of autophagy in different
  states via two major signaling pathways: the inductive pathway mediated by Class-III
  PI3K-beclin1 signaling and the inhibitory pathway mediated by Class I PI3K-mTOR
  signaling. Some compounds, such as resveratrol, berberine, metformin, statins and
  geniposide, may activate autophagy by suppressing the mTOR signaling pathway. Damaged
  mitochondria are eliminated by mitophagy through the accumulation of PINK1/Parkin
  pathway and BNIP3/NIX pathway on the mitochondrial surface. With changes in mitochondrial
  membrane potential (Ψm), this process is coordinated with mitochondrial fusion and
  fission process. Ox-LDL inhibited PINK1/Parkin then impaired mitophagy and stains
  activate Parkin-dependent mitophagy. (B) Basal and mild adaptive autophagy suppresses
  oxidative stress and inflammation and increases cell survival and cellular homeostasis
  to protect against the progression of atherosclerotic plaques, while impaired and
  excessive autophagy activation leads to increased oxidative stress and inflammation,
  cell death, and apoptosis, further contributing to plaque instability and rupture.'
