caption: Alterations in glucose levels regulate AMPK activity in the ARC circuit.
  Inhibition by leptin of AMPK in presynaptic GABAergic axon terminals reduces GABA
  release onto POMC cells. In contrast, leptin receptor activation on POMC neurons
  stimulates the JAK2-PI3K-PLC pathway, resulting in opening of TRPC channels and
  probably IP3 receptors as well. Increased Ca2+ concentrations trigger the release
  of melanocortin and glutamate from glutamatergic POMC neurons. Short-term exposure
  to a high-fat diet up-regulates PI3K activity specifically in POMC neurons. Under
  these conditions, leptin no longer reduces GABA release from presynaptic GABAergic
  neurons. However, the JAK2-PI3K-PLC pathway by leptin in POMC neurons remains effectively
  transmitted, thereby enhancing GABAergic inhibitory tone to POMC neurons. This feedback
  inhibition of POMC neurons in animals on high-fat feeding may play a role in the
  regulation of overall energy balance.
