caption: Dynamic retention. Six steps account for the unique trafficking of Glut4
  compared with the constitutively cycling Tf receptor. *, three of these steps are
  highly insulin-regulated in adipocytes, increasing 10–30-fold with insulin. i, endocytosis;
  there are multiple pathways for endocytosis in both fibroblasts and adipocytes,
  the fast (Tf receptor) pathway, and a slower (Glut4) pathway. ii, degradation; differentiation
  induces the expression of proteins, including sortilin, that redirect Glut4 from
  lysosomal degradation pathways. iii, sorting; there are two pathways for constitutive
  recycling from sorting endosomes in both in fibroblasts and adipocytes, the fast
  (Tf receptor) pathway and a slower (Glut4) recycling pathway. *iv, sequestration;
  differentiation induces a second recycling pathway for Glut4 in basal adipocytes,
  a highly regulated non-cycling/very slowly cycling pathway through GSVs (GSVseq,
  sequestered GSVs). Unexpectedly, insulin increases the rate constant for transfer
  from sorting endosomes into GSVs. *v, release; the GSVs are rapidly mobilized in
  response to insulin (GSVrel, released GSVs), through a process regulated by AS160.
  Our data and modeling suggest that AS160 may also be required for formation of GSVs.
  *vi, tethering/docking/fusion; GSV exocytosis is regulated by a second, AS160-independent,
  Akt- and PI3K-dependent mechanism.
