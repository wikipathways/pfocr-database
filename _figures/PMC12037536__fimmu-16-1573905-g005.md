caption: The role of multiple cytokines and signaling pathways in psoriasis is highly
  significant. Cytokines secreted by immune cells bind to their corresponding receptors.
  For instance, the massive release of IL-23, IL-6, IL-9, IL-22, and IFN-γ activates
  the intracellular JAK-STAT signaling pathway, thereby triggering downstream inflammatory
  responses. Meanwhile, IL-17, members of the IL-1 family, and TNF-α amplify the inflammatory
  response by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. Under the combined influence
  of these inflammatory factors and signaling pathways, the inflammatory response
  in psoriasis continues to escalate, promoting the involvement of additional inflammatory
  cells (such as Th17 and DCs). This results in a multidimensional stimulation of
  keratinocytes, ultimately leading to further deterioration of the psoriasis condition
