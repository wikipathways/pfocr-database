caption: A proposed model depicting the possible mechanism of XIST on mediating cell
  proliferation, viability and apoptosis via generating a negative feedback regulation
  of NF‐κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. The recognition of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus
  aureus by Toll‐like receptors (TLRS) triggered the activation of NF‐κB signalling,
  thus stimulating the production of inflammatory genes such as TNF‐α, pro‐IL‐1β,
  IL‐6 and NLRP3 inflammasome. These inflammatory genes constituted an inflammatory
  microenviroment to modulate cell proliferation, viability and apoptosis. In turn,
  NF‐κB‐dependent XIST interacted with NF‐κB signal pathway and inhibited the overexpression
  of downstream inflammatory genes
