caption: '(A): A model for coordination of two ROP signaling pathways by localized
  extracellular auxin, which results from a PIN1-mediated positive feedback loop.(B):
  A model for auxin control of interdigitated growth through inter- and intra-cellular
  coordination of the ROP2 and ROP6 pathways. We surmise that the PC intergditated
  growth is controlled by an auxin-dependent self-organizing mechanism. In this mechanism,
  localized extracellular auxin, which is generated by self-activation via the auxin→ROP2→PIN1→auxin
  feedback loop and self-maintenance via the antagonizing ROP6 pathway, controls cell-cell
  coordination of lobing and indentating by activating the complementary ROP2 and
  ROP6 pathways in two adjacent cells, which are mutually exclusive within each cell
  to allow for the formation of alternating lobes and indentations (; ).'
