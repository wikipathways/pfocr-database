caption: Summary of the pharmacotherapeutic targets for the treatment of CF lung disease.
  Of all of the drug therapies in development that are designed to restore airway
  hydration and promote mucociliary clearance, the osmotic agents are by far the furthest
  ahead in the development pipeline. Since the airway epithelium is highly water permeable,
  addition of osmotic agents to the apical surface (1), either using hypertonic saline
  or mannitol, sets up an osmotic gradient that drives fluid to the apical surface.
  Small but significant clinical gains in FEV1 have been reported, but more importantly
  the frequency of exacerbations are significantly reduced while on this therapy.
  Phase III clinical trials for hypertonic saline have been completed and this therapy
  is now available in most CF clinics. In the early 1990s, it was found that apically
  applied P2Y2 receptor agonists (ATP/UTP) elicited a chloride secretory response
  in both normal and cystic fibrosis airways. The presence of this alternative Ca2+
  activated Cl− secretory pathway has been recognized as a potential pharmacotherapeutic
  target (2). Two leading drugs that target this pathway are the P2Y2 receptor analog
  Dunufosol (Inspire 37217) and (3) the Ca2+-raising agent Moli-1901 (Lantibio). Denufosol,
  by activating P2Y2 receptors, increases the rate of PIP2 hydrolysis, resulting in
  an increase in IP3 and release of Ca2+ from stores. Whilst the increase in free
  intracellular Ca2+ activates Cl− secretion through calcium activated chloride channels
  (CaCC), the drop in PIP2 levels, as a result of its hydrolysis, leads to a decrease
  in ENaC activity. The agent Moli-1901, a polycyclic peptide, is known to interact
  with phospholipids in the plasma and organellar membranes, and elevate intracellular
  Ca2+. This in turn leads to activation of CaCC.In addition, ENaC-mediated absorption
  is known to be dysregulated in CF due to the lack of CFTR-mediated inhibition of
  ENaC. Therefore, this channel has been targeted to reduce the abnormal absorption
  of Na+ in CF airways (4). The amiloride-analogs PS552/P680 (Parion Sciences, Parion/Gilead,
  respectively) are open channel blockers, whilst QAU145 (Novartis) inhibits the serine
  proteases (Channel Activating Proteins - CAP inhibitor) that activate ENaC under
  normal physiological conditions. The strategy of blocking absorption should result
  in a net secretory activity and improved airway hydration.For ΔF508 patients, the
  absence of CFTR protein in the membrane reduces secretion and allows absorption
  via ENaC to continue unregulated. Corrector drugs (5a) are designed to facilitate
  trafficking of ΔF508-CFTR to the apical membrane, where it is known that they have
  residual functional activity. If ΔF508-CFTR can be trafficked to the membrane, potentiator
  drugs (5b) have been designed to increase mutated CFTR function. In addition, some
  mutations in CF, namely G551D and R117H, represent mutated proteins that successfully
  traffick to the membrane but have limited functionality. The potentiator drug VX-770
  (Vertex) is currently in clinical trials, and aims to improve the function of G551D
  mutated CFTR in the airway epithelium. In vitro studies have already confirmed increased
  functionality of mutated protein using this compound but the clinical gains have
  yet to be evaluated.
