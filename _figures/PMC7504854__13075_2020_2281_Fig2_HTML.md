caption: Principle of the development of arthritis. Hereditary and environmental factors
  synergistically trigger protein mutation or modification. First, the protein mutation
  results in the activation of immune cells such as macrophages (Møs) and dendritic
  cells (DCs), leading to hypersensitivity of these cells to TNF, LPS, IL-1, and so
  on. Second, after modification, the specific peptide of the protein is recognized
  by DCs, and DCs can also submit abnormal protein fragments to T cells, resulting
  in the activation of immune cells. Then, NF-κB and MAPK are activated. As a consequence
  of the activated NF-κB pathway, inflammasomes tend to assemble, pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and autoantibodies are produced, and immune cells infiltrate. Thereafter,
  localization of the inflammatory response occurs, and arthritis is initiated
