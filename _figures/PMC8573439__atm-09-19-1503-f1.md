caption: Schematic illustration ferroptosis pathways. Regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis
  are divided into three categories. The first pathway regulates iron metabolism,
  including Iron metabolic pathway, ATG5-ATG7-NCOA4 pathway, and P62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway.
  Second, it is regulated by the GSH/GPX4 pathway, including P53 pathway, System Xc-/GPX4
  pathway, and Glutamine metabolic pathway. Third, it is associated with lipid metabolism,
  including Lipid metabolic pathway. In addition, Erastin acts on the mitochondria
  to induce ferroptosis. The FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H and BH4-DHFR pathways exist as independent
  parallel systems, which cooperates with GPX4 and glutathione to inhibit phospholipid
  peroxidation and ferroptosis. MVA, mevalonate; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; FSP1,
  ferroptosis suppressor protein 1; SAT1, spermine N1-acetyltransfersae 1; CDKN1A,
