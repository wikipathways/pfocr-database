caption: A schematic diagram illustrating the proposed mechanism of caveolin-1-mediated
  increase in invasion observed upon silencing FASN/ERα during hyperglycaemia-induced,
  matrix-specific EMT. Exposure to hyperglycaemia and fibronectin induces EMT and
  further enhances the Warburg effect by upregulating glucose uptake, lactate release
  and specific glycolytic enzymes and transporters. Inhibiting FASN/ERα signalling
  suppresses the glycolytic phenotype and promotes invasion via upregulation of caveolin-1
  in lipid rafts also enriched in cholesterol and various signalling proteins and
  receptors. Considering the direct involvement of caveolin-1 in mediating cellular
  cholesterol homeostasis this pro-invasive phenotype is potentially associated with
  a metabolic shift from glycolysis to cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.
