caption: Cells bind circulating insulin via the insulin receptor, which activates
  insulin receptor substrate (IRS). This in turn recruits association of the regulatory
  p85 and catalytic p110α subunits of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which becomes
  activated. Activated PI3K catalyses the addition of phosphate groups to the 3′-OH
  position in the inositol ring of phosphoinositides to generate phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) converts PIP3
  to hypophosphorylated isoforms. Binding of PIP3 to AKT stimulates its kinase activity,
  and two of its targets are glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and the transcription
  factor FOXO1, both of which are repressed by phosphorylation. Phosphorylated GSK3
  is blocked from inactivating glycogen synthase, resulting in synthesis of glycogen.
  Phosphorylated FOXO1 is blocked from transcribing genes encoding enzymes in the
  gluconeogenic pathway, resulting in dampening of gluconeogenesis. AKT additionally
  promotes glucose uptake by increasing the levels of glucose transporters at the
  cell membrane. Shown are the various microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate insulin signal
  transduction in cells and miRNAs that regulate glycogenesis and gluconeogenesis.
