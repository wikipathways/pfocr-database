caption: Contributions of O- and N-methyltransferases to BIA biosynthesis. A central
  pathway (dark blue) leads to the core 1-BIA intermediate (S)-reticuline (dashed
  rectangle) from which various branch pathways diverge, including those leading to
  aporphines (red), pavinans (purple), protoberberines (light blue), protopines (pink),
  benzo[c]phenanthridines (green), and pthalideisoquinolines (brown). The bisbenzylisoquinolines
  (gray) are typically produced by dimerization of various 1-BIA intermediates. The
  branch pathway to papaverine (yellow) is unusual in diverging from the central pathway
  prior to N-methylation. The 6OMT (norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase), 4′-OMT (3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine
  4′-O-methyltransferase), N7OMT (norreticuline 7-O-methyltransferase), 3′OMT (3′-O-methyltransferase),
  SOMT (scoulerine O-methyltransferase), 4′-AOMT (4′‐O‐desmethyl‐3‐O‐acetylpapaveroxine
  4′-O-methyltransferase), CNMT (coclaurine N-methyltransferase), RNMT (reticuline
  N-methyltransferase), PavNMT (pavine N-methyltransferase), and TNMT (tetrahydroprotoberberine
  N-methyltransferase) are drawn on branches representing their major or physiologically
  relevant activities. O- and N-methyl groups reportedly installed by the enzymes
  are circled in red and green, respectively. A detailed BIA biosynthetic pathway
  is available in .
