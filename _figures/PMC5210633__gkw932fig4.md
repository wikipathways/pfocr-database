  views of the jasmonic acid signaling pathway when compared to angiosperms maize
  (A) and tomato (B), lycopod Selaginella (C) and unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas

  boxes suggest that either a respective rice gene homolog was found (yellow color)
  or not (blue). The reaction associated with multiple rice genes may display both
  yellow and blue colors depending on the number of homolog matches which also corresponds
  to the proportion of the yellow or blue color. The inset showing Components for
  COI1 bound to JA-Ile suggests which of the rice genes have homologs mapped from
  the respective species.'
