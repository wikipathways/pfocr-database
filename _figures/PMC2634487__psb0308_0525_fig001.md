caption: Generic pathway for plant response to stress. The extracellular stress signal
  is first perceived by the membrane receptors and then activate large and complex
  signaling cascade intracellularly including the generation of secondary signal molecules.
  The stress signal can first activates phospholipase C (PLC), which hydrolyses PIP2
  to generate IP3 and DAG resulting in an increase in the level of Ca2+ ions in the
  cytosol, which is sensed by calcium sensor. The signal cascade results into the
  expression of multiple stress responsive genes, the products of which can provide
  the stress tolerance directly or indirectly. Overall, the stress response could
  be coordination action of many genes, which may cross-talk with each others.
