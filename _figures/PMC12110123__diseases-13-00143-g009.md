caption: Ginsenoside CK can enhance the expression of CD69, CD80, and CD86, stimulate
  the NF-κB and AP-1 inflammatory signaling pathway, and induce macrophages to secrete
  iNOS and TNF-α to enhance inflammatory response. Conversely, CK can also inhibit
  the expression of CD82 protein, reducing monocyte differentiation into macrophages
  to avoid excessive inflammatory responses
