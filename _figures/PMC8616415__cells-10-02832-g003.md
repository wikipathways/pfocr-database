caption: Tryptophan metabolic pathway and development and progression of CKD. Tryptophan
  is an essential amino acid that cannot be synthesized in the body. A minor fraction
  of tryptophan (<5%) is metabolized by the indole pathway to produce indoxyl sulfate.
  Most tryptophan (around 95%) is metabolized by the kynurenine pathway. Downstream
  metabolites of tryptophan, including indoxyl sulfate, kynurenic acid, picolinic
  acid, xanthurenic acid, quinolinic acid, and NAD, contribute to oxidative stress,
  inflammation, and immune response, which lead to the development and progression
  of CKD. CKD, chronic kidney disease; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
