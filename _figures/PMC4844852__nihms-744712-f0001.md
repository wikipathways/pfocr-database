caption: The AHR is a cytosolic receptor that is bound to a chaperone protein, ARA9.
  Ligands cross the cell membrane and bind to the AHR, causing it to shed ARA9 and
  migrate to the nucleus where it associates with ARNT. This heterodimer then binds
  to the dioxin response element (DRE) and becomes a transcription factor for the
  cytochrome P450 enzymes (including Cyp 1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp 1b1) and other metabolizing
  enzymes. Adapted with permission from (). Copyright 2008 American Chemical Society.
  AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor.
