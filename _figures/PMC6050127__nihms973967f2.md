caption: Schematic of the pathways linked to glycogen metabolism. Glycogen breakdown
  produces glucose-1-phosphate (via glycogenolysis) and glucose (via glycophagy and
  debranching enzyme activity). Both products enter into the glycolytic pathway giving
  rise to pyruvate which acts as a key precursor for the TCA cycle, fatty acid synthesis
  and gluconeogenesis. The interconversion of pyruvate to lactate and alanine further
  integrate the metabolism of the liver and muscle tissues. Additionally, fructose-6-phosphate
  generated in glycolysis can also shunt to the pentose phosphate pathway for nucleotide
  synthesis.
