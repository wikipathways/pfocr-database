caption: Tumor-derived double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which can be derived by genomic
  instability, activates AIM2 inflammasome and cGAS-STING signaling pathway. The AIM2
  receptor consists of an N-terminal PYD, which is responsible for the recruitment
  of the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD
  (caspase recruitment domain) (ASC), and a C-terminal HIN domain, which is responsible
  for the recognition of and binding with the DNA. After the recognition of dsDNA
  in the cytoplasm, AIM2 binds to ASC and protease caspase-1 and/or caspase-4 to form
  the AIM2 inflammasome intracellular multiprotein complex, leading to the release
  of active IL-1-like cytokines. Tumor-derived dsDNA can also be sensed by the cyclic
  GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Upon its activation, cGAS produces cyclic 2′3′GMP-AMP (2′3′cGAMP),
  which acts as a second messenger to activate stimulator of interferon genes (STING).
  STING activation leads to the recruitment of the interferon regulatory factor 3
  (IRF3), a transcription factor, which drives the expression of type I IFN
