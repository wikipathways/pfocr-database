caption: Under the guidance of SCF/c-kit signaling, mast cells migrate to and are
  activated in tumor microenvironment; the activated mast cells release a panel of
  factors, leading to CCL2 production and IL-17 upregulation in MDSCs; CCL2 signaling
  recruits more MDSCs, leading to more IL-17 production; IL-17 strengthens tumor inflammatory
  microenvironment, leading to the upregulation of IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, CCL17, CCL22,
  CD39 and CD73; IL-10 and IL-13 induce arginase 1 expression by MDSCs; CCL17 and
  CCL22 attract the migration of Treg cells; CD39 and CD73 enhance suppressor function
  of Treg cells; IL-9 produced by Treg cells maintains the survival of mast cells;
  MDSCs release active MMP9, through which soluble SCF is generated, thus further
  facilitating the migration and activation of mast cells.
