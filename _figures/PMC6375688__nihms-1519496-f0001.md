caption: 'Proteostasis regulation. Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen
  activates ER membrane-associated ATF6α, IRE1α, and PERK. Consequently, transcription
  factors p55 (cleaved ATF6α), sXBP-1, and ATF4 translocate to the nucleus and induce
  the transcription of several genes involved in: i) organelle biosynthesis; ii) processing
  of unfolded proteins, such as ER chaperones; iii) degradation of unfolded proteins
  through proteasome and autophagy; iv) antioxidant response. The phosphorylation
  of eIF2α by PERK also inhibits general protein translation to decrease the amount
  of proteins that follow the secretory pathway. This process is known as the Unfolded
  Protein Response (UPR). An excessive UPR can induce apoptosis through activation
  of caspase-4 and increased expression of CHOP protein. Moreover, proteins that are
  not repaired in the ER or degraded by the proteasome or dysfunctional organelles
  can be degraded by autophagy. In this process a double membrane is formed around
  proteins that need to be degraded forming an autophagosome that fuses with lysosomes
  to degrade its content.'
