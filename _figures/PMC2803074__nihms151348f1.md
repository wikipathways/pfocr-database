caption: 'Model of interactions between epigenetic agents in gene re-expression and
  tumor cell death. Tumor suppressor genes are silenced in transformed cells by multiple
  mechanisms, including aberrant methylation at promoter regions, mutations in nucleosome
  remodeling complex proteins, and diverse histone modifications, including acetylation,
  methylation, phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and glycosylation, among others. Inhibitors
  of DNMT such as 5-azacytine and 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine reverse gene methylation
  and promote re-expression. Analogously, HDAC inhibitors lead to histone acetylation,
  resulting in a more open chromatin structure, and enhanced gene expression. They
  can also block the actions of co-repressor complexes. Oligoamine analog inhibitors
  of histone demethylases i.e., LSD1 induce positive methylation marks on H3K4, accompanied
  by re-expression of Wnt pathway antagonist genes (SRFPs). Combined exposure of tumor
  cells with two agents that act at different levels of the epigenome (e.g., HDACIs
  and hypomethylating agents or hypomethylating agents and histone methyltransferase
  inhibitors) may be particularly effective in counteracting gene silencing and triggering
  transformed cell death. Abbreviations: DNMT: DNA methyltransferase; DNMTI (DNA methyltransferase
  inhibitor); 5-AC: 5-azacytidine; DAC: 5-aza 2’-deoxyazacytine; HDM: histone demethylase;
  HDMI: histone demethylase inhibitor; HMT: histone methyltransferase; HMTI: histone
  methyltransferase inhibitor; LSD1: flavin-dependent amine oxidase histone demethylase;
  SFRPs: secreted frizzled-related proteins; SWI/SNF complex: mating-type switching/sucrose
  non-fermenting complex.'
