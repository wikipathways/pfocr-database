caption: 'In response to growth factor binding to their receptors, the PI3K/Akt pathway
  is activated, leading to inhibition of GSK-3. GSK-3 negatively regulates a host
  of factors downstream of growth factor signaling, so the consequences of GSK-3 inhibition
  are activation of these factors including: 1) NF-AT-hypertrophy regulator, 2) glycogen
  synthase-glycogen synthesis regulator, 3) mTORC1-autophagy and metabolism regulator,
  4) D- and E-type cyclins-cell cycle regulator, 3) Myc-metabolism and proliferation
  regulator. An alternative mechanism to inhibit GSK-3 is mediated by p38. GSK-3β
  directly binds with SMAD-3 to negatively regulate the profibrotic TGF-β1 signaling.
  GSK-3 is well known to regulate the canonical Wnt signaling. Phosphorylation of
  β-catenin by GSK-3 leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin by the
  proteasome, preventing gene expression. In the absence of GSK-3, β-catenin is stabilized,
  and then translocates to the nucleus leading to gene expression. β-catenin regulates
  a host of processes from fibrosis to cardiac hypertrophy. GSK-3α regulates AMPK
  and mTOR, the master regulators of autophagy and metabolism. In the absence of GSK-3α,
  mTOR is dysregulated leading to impaired autophagy which accelerates the progression
  of aging. GSK-3α also regulates the β-adrenergic receptor responsiveness and cAMP
  production via unknown mechanisms. GSK-3α directly interacts and phosphorylates
  cyclin E1 in cardiomyocytes and its deletion promotes E2F-1 and cyclin E1 recruitment
  and induces the re-entry of adult cardiomyocytes into the cell cycle. (llustration
