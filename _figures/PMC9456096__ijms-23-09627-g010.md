caption: Schematic representation of the signal pathway induced by YfeA based on the
  above results. YfeA of G. parasuis triggers activation of TLR2 and TLR4, and subsequent
  recruitment of adaptors MyD88 and TIRAP, which in turn recruits and activates TRAF6
  and other downstream signal molecules. The process leads to IκB proteasomal degradation
  followed by nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 and phosphorylation of p38 and
  ERK1/2. The activation of NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling pathways induce transcription
  and translation of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and
  TNF-α.
