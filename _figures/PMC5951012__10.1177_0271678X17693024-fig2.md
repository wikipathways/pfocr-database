caption: 'Metabolic processes considered in astrocytes. The same metabolic reactions
  are considered in neurons. Nodes inside the dashed box present the pentose phosphate
  pathway, not considered in previous models of brain energy metabolism. In addition
  to the species already depicted in , the following species are shown: glucose 6-phosphate
  (G6P), fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP), phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP), pyruvic acid (PYR), creatine (Cr), phosphocreatine (PCr), 6-phospho gluconolactone
  (G6L), 6-phospho lactonate (P6G), ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P), ribose 5-phosphate
  (R5P), xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P), erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P), sedoheptulose 7-phosphate
  (S7P), adenosin triphosphate (ATP), adenosin diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate
  (AMP), NAD, NADH, NADP and NADPH. The notation follows the Systems Biology Graphical
  Notation (SBGN).'
