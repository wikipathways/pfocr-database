caption: Schematic overview of the 13R-MO synthesis pathway in S. cerevisiae. Heterologous
  genes are marked in purple, native MVA pathway genes are marked in orange, overexpressed
  genes are marked in red are, and ERG9 was downregulated as shown in kermesinus.
  The Bts1p and Erg20F96Cp fusion protein is indicated in green. Acetyl-CoA acetyl
  coenzyme A, HMG-CoA 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, tHMG1 truncated HMG-CoA reductase
  gene, IPP isopentenyl pyrophosphate, DMAPP dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, ERG20 farnesyl
  diphosphate synthetase gene, FPP farnesyl diphosphate synthetase, FOH farnesol,
