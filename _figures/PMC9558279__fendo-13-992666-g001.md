caption: Epigenetics of PTH and PTHrP signaling. The parathyroid hormone receptor
  (PTH1R) mediates the actions of two ligands, PTH and PTHrP, with independent roles
  in calcium homeostasis and bone developments, respectively. PTH1R main signaling
  pathway in response to PTH or PTHrP requires activation of the α subunit of the
  heterotrimeric stimulatory G-protein (Gsα). Gsα is encoded by GNAS, a complex locus
  that normally undergoes methylation on the maternal side (for normal expression
  of Gsα). In the proximal tubule, Gsα is almost exclusively derived from the maternal
  side during adult life. cAMP generation results in phosphaturic action (via downregulation
  of phosphate transporters Npta and Npt2c) and vitamin D activation. In the developing
  bone, downstream of Gsα, cAMP production activates PKA and inhibits SIK thereby
  exerting a control in MEF2c, which results in chondrocyte proliferation. PTH, parathyroid
  hormone; PTHrP, parathyroid hormone related peptide; PKA, protein kinase A; SIK,
  salt inducible kinase; HDAC, Histone deacetylase; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor.
