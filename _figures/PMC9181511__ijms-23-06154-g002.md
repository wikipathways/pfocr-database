  adipose tissue as a reservoir and as macrophages, inducing lipogenic metabolism
  that can accumulate lipids (foam macrophages). Furthermore, adipocytes regulate

  augmenting pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit cells similar
  to macrophages. Additionally, the synthesis of triacylglycerol and lipase is increased
  to dispose of free fatty acids. (D) Chlamydia ssp infection increases the unfolded

  in the adipocyte, reducing adiponectin and PPAR- γ, but also signal molecules that
  stimulate inflammation such as Toll-like receptors (TLR-2 and -9). Additionally,
  cultured adipocytes presented a higher activation of the MAPK pathway in cultured
  adipocytes. Cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ) and chemokines (CCL2-CCL8 and CCL12),
  as well as the levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10, were markedly elevated in the adipose
  tissue of acutely infected mice. (F) Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoites use the adipose
  tissue as reservoirs; the infection with T gondii can induce oxidative stress and
  the subsequent inflammatory response. In addition, several cytokines, such as IL-2,
  could affect the adipocyte tissue and alter their metabolism or promote cell proliferation
  and hypertrophy as well the presence of Interferon-gamma and adiponectin chemerin
  in the serum, thus encouraging the development of the metabolic syndrome.
