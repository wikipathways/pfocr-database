caption: KEGG pathways significantly associated with NPG. Pathways with a permutated
  p of <0.001 are presented (blue font). The individual genes within the associated
  pathways with gene-based permutated p values <0.001 are listed in black font and
  are contained in the ellipse corresponding to the pathway. Genes that are present
  in more than one pathway are indicated by overlapping ellipses. With the exception
  of FYN, the genes with significant association in the Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway
  are also included in the MAPK signaling pathway. Similarly, both of the significant
  genes in the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies pathway (BDH1, HMGCS1) are
  also found in the butanoate pathway. The significantly associated genes in the Hedgehog
  signaling pathway, the phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathway
  and the glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-heparan sulfate pathway did not overlap with
  any other pathway. NPG normal-pressure glaucoma; FYN tyrosine-protein kinase Fyn;
