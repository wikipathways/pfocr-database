caption: Model of the arrest of pollen-tube growth by self-S-RNase in Pyrus pyrifolia.
  PLC in pollen tube, located at pollen tube apices, cleaves PIP2 to IP3 and DAG (1,2-Diacylglycerol).
  Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate stimulates extracellular free-Ca2+ influx through Ca2+
  channels, maintaining the Ca2+ gradient. If the activity of the special apical tube
  PLC is blocked by self-S-RNase, the concentration of IP3 decreases at the apex.
  In addition to the inhibition of PLC activity, the expression of PLC gene was also
  inhibited by unknown factors. As a result, the activity of Ca2+ channels is suppressed,
  and extracellular free-Ca2+ influx decreases. Additionally, the high Ca2+ gradient
  at the tip cannot be generated and maintained (). Therefore, the pollen tube eventually
  stops growing.  concluded that the style rejected incompatible pollen through S-RNase
  degrading the RNA, which was shown to be essential for the SI response, but the
  procession is at the late stage after major cellular dismantling of incompatible
  pollen tubes. In this self-incompatible model, the PLC activity and expression in
  the non-compatible pollen tube coincide with the behavior of the PLC between plant
  and pathogen. Type T symbol represents inhibition of PLC enzyme activity. Broken
  and solid lines represent negative and positive regulatory activities, respectively.
