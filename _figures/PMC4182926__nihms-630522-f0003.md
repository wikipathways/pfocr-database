caption: Known Inputs into the Fog Signaling Pathway. The core Fog signaling pathway
  components are shown in the central gray oval. Transcription factors are in red
  ovals. Accessory proteins are in aqua circles. Yellow bars denote physical changes.
  Physical forces act on Twist, myosin, and actin to change their abundance and localization,
  though the mechanisms of these functions and whether they are direct are not entirely
  clear. Dorsal–ventral patterning sets up Twist and Snail expression. Twist induces
  transcription of fog and T48 in VF cells. Similarly, Snail is necessary for mist
  transcription in the VF. Apical–basal patterning organizes Fog and Mist subcellular
  organization. T48, a single pass transmembrane protein, helps to localize RhoGEF2
  apically in the VF. Gβ13f, Gγ1, and Ric8 are all required for Cta protein stability
  and function. Abl helps organize actin apically in contracting cells. All of these
  inputs, and likely more, help organize and activate Fog signaling in developmental
  time and space.
