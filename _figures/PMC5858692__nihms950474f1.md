caption: In this model, natively folded Aβ monomers preferentially form Aβ trimers
  under physiological conditions, whereas dimers are formed following the misfolding
  of Aβ monomers induced by aging, post-translational modification of the primary
  sequence of Aβ or a chaperone protein. Both Aβ assemblies constitute the pool of
  low molecular weight (LMW) or low-n oAβ from which two pathways emerge. The “Off”
  pathway does not lead to the formation of insoluble fibrillar amyloid and is characterized
  by its immunoreactivity to the conformation-specific oligomer antibody A11. By contrast,
  the “On” pathway promotes the formation of fibrillar Aβ and molecules involved in
  this pathway are immunopositive to the conformation-specific fibril antibody OC.
  Once a species of Aβ has entered one of these paths, it cannot effectuate a horizontal
  transfer into the opposite pathway but instead it must de disassembled back into
  a monomeric state. The thickness of arrows illustrates the favored direction of
  the putative equilibrium suggested by integrated experimental observations.
