caption: Simplified representation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2
  branch of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and its
  interaction with xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and nitric oxide (NO). The activation
  of cell membrane receptors (including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), receptors
  tyrosine kinase (RTK) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR)) by receptor-specific
  external stimuli (e.g. endothelin-1 for GPCR, epidermal growth factor for RTK) leads
  to the sequential activation of a series of intracellular messengers. Stress acts
  either directly or through a putative receptor. The first intracellular messengers
  that become activated are the small GTPases (SMG), including members of the Ras
  (mainly) and Rho/Rac/cdc42 subfamilies, which then activate the RAF family (A-RAF,
  B-RAF and C-RAF), which in turn activate MEK1/2. The final effectors are ERK1/2,
  which in turn stimulate hypertrophy by either phosphorylating transcription factors
  (TF) or by regulating ribosomal RNA transcription and protein translation. ERK1/2
  possibly translocates to the nucleus in order to activate TF. XOR activates ERK1/2
  and this could partly mediate its hypertrophic actions in the myocardium. The actions
  of NO on ERK1/2 pathway are a matter of debate. NO appears to act on Ras and both
  inhibitory and stimulating effects have been reported. These actions are possibly
  mediated through S-nitrosylation. The relative contribution of nitric oxide synthase
  1 (NOS1) and NOS3 on these NO-effects on ERK1/2 pathway is also uncertain.

  description: Simplified representation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases
    (ERK)1/2 branch of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway
    and its interaction with xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and nitric oxide (NO).
    The activation of cell membrane receptors (including G-protein coupled receptors
    (GPCR), receptors tyrosine kinase (RTK) and fibroblast growth factor receptors
    (FGFR)) by receptor-specific external stimuli (e.g. endothelin-1 for GPCR, epidermal
    growth factor for RTK) leads to the sequential activation of a series of intracellular
    messengers. Stress acts either directly or through a putative receptor. The first
    intracellular messengers that become activated are the small GTPases (SMG), including
    members of the Ras (mainly) and Rho/Rac/cdc42 subfamilies, which then activate
    the RAF family (A-RAF, B-RAF and C-RAF), which in turn activate MEK1/2. The final
    effectors are ERK1/2, which in turn stimulate hypertrophy by either phosphorylating
    transcription factors (TF) or by regulating ribosomal RNA transcription and protein
    translation. ERK1/2 possibly translocates to the nucleus in order to activate
    TF. XOR activates ERK1/2 and this could partly mediate its hypertrophic actions
    in the myocardium. The actions of NO on ERK1/2 pathway are a matter of debate.
    NO appears to act on Ras and both inhibitory and stimulating effects have been
    reported. These actions are possibly mediated through S-nitrosylation. The relative
    contribution of nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) and NOS3 on these NO-effects on
    ERK1/2 pathway is also uncertain.
