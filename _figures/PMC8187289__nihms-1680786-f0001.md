caption: (A) Mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. A sgRNA/tracrRNA-crRNA associates
  with the Cas9 endonuclease to form the Cas9-gRNA complex. The gRNA guides Cas9 to
  its target site of the genomic DNA by recognizing the protospacer-adjacent motif
  (PAM). When Cas9 binds to the correct dsDNA target, its HNH and RuvC nuclease domains
  cleave the DNA to yield either blunt or staggered ends. Genome editing is achieved
  during the repair of the resulting DSB, resulting in precise mutations, gene deletions,
  or sequence insertions. (B) Cas9 can be delivered in three forms. First, introducing
  Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and DNA templates directly through nanoparticles,
  electroporation, or microinjection. Second, delivering a plasmid DNA or viral vector
  for Cas9 and gRNA production in situ. Third, delivering separate gRNA together with
  mRNA for Cas9 protein expression inside the cell. With the exception of microinjection,
  during which Cas9 components can be directly injected into the nucleus, other delivery
  methods release Cas9 components into the cytosol. DNA sensing receptors in endosome
  or cytosol, including the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), melanoma 2 (AIM2) and cyclic
  GFP-AMP synthase-STING (cGAS-STING), drive cell immune responses to foreign DNA.
  mRNA can also be recognized by TLR7 and TLR8 in endosome causing mRNA degradation
  and type I interferon α (IFN-α)-mediated immune response. Cas9 in the cytosol can
  be directed into nucleus through nuclear localization sequence; how plasmid DNA,
  viral DNA and DNA templates enter the nucleus is unknown.
