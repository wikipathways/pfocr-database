caption: Schematic illustration shows the working model of NOTCH1 regulation of HER3
  protein. Functional NOTCH1 signaling suppresses the phosphorylation of AKT serine
  473, which inactivates the deubiquitinating enzyme USP8. Activated USP8 then deceases
  the polyubiquitination of HER3, preventing proteasomal degradation of HER3 protein
  (left). When loss of function of NOTCH1 occurs, phosphorylation of AKT is increased,
  and the activity of USP8 is subsequently down-regulated. Once the deubiquitination
  is suppressed, the poly-ubiquitinated HER3 protein is subject to proteasomal degradation
  (right).
