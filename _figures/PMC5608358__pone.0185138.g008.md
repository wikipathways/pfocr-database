caption: Similar to the gastrointestinal tract, FIV exhibits a tropism for oral tissues,
  providing a pathway for circulating virus to extravasate and infect resting T-lymphocytes
  (rT) and dendritic cells (DC). (A) As documented in the intestinal mucosa, infection
  and depletion of resting mucosal lymphocytes in the oral mucosa may cause inflammation,
  damage mucosal barriers, and subsequent translocation of oral microbes; resulting
  in lymphocyte activation and recruitment to oral mucosal tissues. (B) Mucosal injury
  initiates a chronic cycle of immune activation and provides a renewable source for
  target cell infection by recruiting susceptible cells to the site of injury. Peripheral
  FIV-infected cells traffic to oral lymphoid tissue via lymphatics (C) or direct
  migration to tonsils (D) resulting in antigen presentation, T-lymphocyte activation
  (aT), and infection of resident leukocytes, establishing a reservoir of persistent
  FIV replication in latently infected T-lymphocytes (iT) in oral lymphoid tissues.
  (E) FIV infected cells are likely shed from oral mucosal sites into saliva, resulting
  in the presence of salivary proviral DNA. Cells within oral lymphoid tissues have
  enhanced FIV replicative activity, resulting in a higher ratio of FIV viral RNA
  to proviral DNA than noted in the peripheral circulation. (F) FIV RNA in saliva
  may be achieved by direct release of virus particles from infected cells into saliva
  via the intimate association of tonsillar lymphoid tissue with the oral mucosa.
  (G) While FIV specific IgG responses are detected in saliva, anti-FIV IgA antibodies
  are not specifically enhanced, allowing FIV virus and infected cells to persist
  in saliva at high levels.
