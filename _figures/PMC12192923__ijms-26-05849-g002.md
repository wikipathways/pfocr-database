caption: The role of the cGAS-STING pathway in health and cancer therapy. Various
  stressors such as viral infection, anticancer therapies or radiation can lead to
  the accumulation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments in the cytosol. These
  fragments are sensed by cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), which catalyzes the production
  of cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP binds to and activates the adaptor protein STING
  (stimulator of interferon genes), triggering its phosphorylation. Activated STING
  recruits and activates TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which subsequently phosphorylates
  the transcription factor IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3). Phosphorylated IRF3
  translocates into the nucleus, where it induces the expression of type I interferons.
  These interferons play a critical role in promoting an immune response, contributing
  to antiviral defense and antitumor immunity. Figure produced using “BioRender.com
