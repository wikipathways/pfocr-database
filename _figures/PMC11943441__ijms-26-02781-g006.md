caption: Possible neuroprotective mechanisms of full-length osteopontin (FL-OPN) and
  osteopontin N-half (OPN N-half). Both FL-OPN and OPN N-half contain an Arg-Gly-Asp
  (RGD) sequence and bind to RGD-dependent integrins on the cell surface, inducing
  angiopoietin-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1),
  inhibiting nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to
  activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt signaling or upregulate autophagy-related
  proteins, and/or activating the integrin-linked kinase (ILK)–Rac-1 pathway, resulting
  in suppressing neuronal apoptosis, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and cerebral
  vasospasm. Thrombin cleavage of FL-OPN generates the OPN N-half, which exposes a
  Ser-Val-Val-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg (SVVYGLR)-containing motif sequence that activates the
  transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad signaling pathway to promote tissue regeneration
  and angiogenesis through binding to the TGF-β receptor or RGD-independent integrins,
  or enhances microglial motility and phagocytic activity through activation of the
  FAK, MAPK, and Akt signaling pathways. All mechanisms may act neuroprotectively,
  and the OPN N-half is thought to be more neuroprotective than FL-OPN because OPN
  N-half acts through both the RGD- and SVVYGLR-containing motif sequences
