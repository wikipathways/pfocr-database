caption: Chart explaining the possible mechanism of 20E counteracting insulin pathway
  to stop larval growth and determine body size. The 20E titer increased during metamorphosis
  in H. armigera (, ). INSR played roles to promote insect larval growth and 20E production
  to the critical titer by repressing FoxO nuclear localization during larval feeding
  stages (). The critical 20E titer upregulated PTEN expression to keep FoxO nucleus
  localization, which initiated PTP1B expression to dephosphorylate INSRβ () and repressed
  INSRβ expression (). The decrease in INSR levels and phosphorylation weakened its
  inhibition on FoxO nuclear localization. Thereby 20E counteracted insulin pathway,
  stopped growth, initiated metamorphosis (larval cells apoptosis and adult tissues
  proliferation), and accumulated hemolymph glucose levels for imaginal discs growth
  in ILPs reach condition. 5F, fifth instar feeding larvae (about fifth instar 0 h–36
  h); 5M, fifth instar molting larvae (about fifth instar 36 h–56 h); Adult, the whole
  body of adult; F, feeding; M, larval molting; MM, metamorphic molting; P, pupae;
  P 0–P 8, 0-day-old to 8-day-old pupae; sixth-6 h–sixth-120 h, time stages of sixth
  instar larvae.
