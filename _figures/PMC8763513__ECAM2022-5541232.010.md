caption: Schematic diagram of the molecular mechanism of compound 2 in treating against
  gout. LPS could induce upregulation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β through the activation
  of transcriptional factor NF-κB. MSU caused release of reactive oxygen species,
  resulting in the release of thioredoxin interaction protein (TXNIP) from thioredoxin
  (TRX) and subsequently to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Besides, activated caspase-1
  promoted IL-1β production by cleaving pro-IL-1β. Compound 2 inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway and induced autophagy activation, which attenuated ROS production and caused
  the activation of NLRP3 inflammation to be suppressed. In summary, compound 2 alleviated
  LPS plus MSU-induced gout inflammatory response by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation via PI3K-AKT-mTOR-dependent autophagy induction.
