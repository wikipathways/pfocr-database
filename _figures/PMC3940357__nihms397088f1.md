caption: A. Regulation of Wnt signaling pathway in normal cells. Beta-catenin is usually
  phosphorylated and degradated by a multiprotein complex composed of APC, GSK3, CK1
  and AXIN.B. Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Wnt ligands bind to the complex compromised
  of FZD/LRP/ROR/RYK, resulting in the constitutive stabilization of beta-catenin.
  The beta-catenin associates with TCF to activate target genes.C. Wnt/Ca2+pathway
  (non-canonical pathway). Wnt activates intracellular Ca2+signaling as well as Ca2+-dependent
  protein kinases such as PKC and CaMK II. TAK1 and NLK can interfere with TCF/beta-catenin
  signaling.D. Wnt/JNK pathway (non-canonical pathway). Receptor stimulation activates
  DVL, which in turn activates the Rho family of GTPases. Rho stimulates c-Jun expression
  through phosphorylation of c-Jun by ROCK.
