caption: 'General overview of the class I PI3K signaling pathway. The PH domain-containing
  proteins can be divided into 3 groups: kinases, adaptor proteins, and GAPs and GEFs.
  Although the role of kinases has been extensively studied, little attention has
  been paid to how adaptor proteins or GAPs and GEFs drive PI3K cell functions, especially
  in cancer. The PI3K effector AKT is a master kinase that activates or inhibits a
  plethora of proteins by phosphorylation; one of its targets is mTORC1. A variety
  of compounds have been developed to inhibit different nodes of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling axis, including PI3K inhibitors (subdivided based on their selectivity
  into pan-PI3K-mTOR inhibitors, pan-PI3K inhibitors, and isoform-specific inhibitors),
  AKT inhibitors (allosteric inhibitors and catalytic inhibitors), and mTOR inhibitors
  (allosteric inhibitors, commonly known as rapalogues, and mTOR catalytic inhibitors).'
