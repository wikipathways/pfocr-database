caption: Effector cytokines can stimulate transcription of proinflammatory signals
  through the Janus kinase–signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT)
  signalling pathway. Intracellular JAK and tyrosine kinase (TYK) proteins are activated
  when a ligand binds to its receptor which induces phosphorylation and activation,
  which in turn activate STAT proteins. The STAT proteins dimerize and translocate
  to the nucleus where they bind STAT-specific response elements in target gene promotors
  and regulate gene transcription; including proinflammatory signals. JAK inhibitors
  (e.g. baricitinib and tofacitinib) are able to abrogate signalling cascades from
  more than one effector cytokine pathway
