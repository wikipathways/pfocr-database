caption: Model of the role of MYB15 in cold stress signaling. Under normal conditions,
  ICE1 is ubiquitinated by HOS1 and degraded by the 26S-proteasome pathway, whereas
  MYB15 binds to an MYBRE on the promoters of CBF genes to inhibit their transcription.
  In response to cold stress, MYB15 is phosphorylated by cold-activated MPK6 and released
  from the CBF gene promoters. ICE1 is stabilized by SIZ1-mediated sumoylation and
  sumoylated ICE1 binds to an MYCRE on the CBF promoters, leading to their increased
  expression and increased freezing tolerance. CBFs, C-repeat binding factors (an
  AP2-type transcription factors); MYBRE, MYB transcription factor recognition element;
  MYCRE, MYC transcription factor recognition element; P, phosphorylation; S, sumoylation;
  U, ubiquitination.
