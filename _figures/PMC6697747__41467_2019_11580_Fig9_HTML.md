caption: A model for NRP1-WT and its splice variants signaling in CRC cell dissemination.
  a NRP1-WT associates with Met and β1-integrin receptors and resides on plasma membrane
  (PM) under basal conditions, and internalizes upon stimulation by HGF followed by
  rapid degradation, leading to a restricted period of signal generation. b NRP1-∆E4
  or NRP1-∆E5 renders Met and β1-integrin co-internalization and constitutively recycles
  back to the cell surface or the extracellular space under basal conditions. These
  events result in an increased accumulation of the NRP1 variants/Met/β1-integrin
  complexes on endosomes, which provides persistent endosomal signals to activate
  the FAK/p130Cas pathway for promoting cell migration, invasion and metastasis in
  CRC. These oncogenic activities of NRP1-∆E4 or NRP1-∆E5 are further enhanced by
  HGF stimulation
