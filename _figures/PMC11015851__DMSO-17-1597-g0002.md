caption: The molecular mechanisms by which MS affects tendon disease. For example,
  in the case of the rotator cuff tendon. (A) The high sugar microenvironment inhibits
  the proliferation and differentiation of TDSCs through the let-7b-5p/CFTR pathway,
  thereby contributing to the occurrence and development of poor tendon-bone healing
  in DM. (B) Tendon tissue exhibits a natural triple helical structure, and accumulated
  AGEs can crosslink with surrounding collagen, thereby affecting the biomechanical
  properties. (C) Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1 b induce the expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory mediators (COX-2, PGE2), degrading enzymes
  (MMPs), expression of angiogenesis (VEGF), inhibition of type I collagen expression,
  which may affect the biomechanics and mechanical properties of tendons and thus
  influence tendon repair.
