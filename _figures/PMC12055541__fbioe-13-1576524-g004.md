caption: 'Inflammatory Mechanisms Following SCI: In the acute injury phase: SCI directly
  causes vascular damage or severing, increasing the permeability of blood vessels.
  Additionally, neuron damage or severing occurs. After SCI, during the secondary
  injury phase, a series of inflammatory cascades occur. ① Immune Microenvironment
  Changes: Local immune microenvironment alterations lead to the release of ROS, which
  inhibit spinal cord repair. ② Myelin Sheath Disruption: SCI causes myelin sheath
  rupture, and the myelin basic protein generated in response to demyelination acts
  as an antigen, inducing T lymphocyte activation. ③ T Lymphocyte Adhesion: T lymphocytes
  use their cell adhesion molecules to adhere to endothelial cells. ④ Microglia Activation:
  Resident microglia are rapidly activated following SCI, releasing chemokines (e.g.,
  CXCL2, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α).
  Some of these inflammatory mediators create an inhibitory immune microenvironment
  that suppresses SCI repair. ⑤ Endothelial Cell Activation: The inflammatory response
  from microglia and T lymphocytes promotes endothelial cells to secrete P-selectin
  and E-selectin, increasing the permeability of the BSCB. ⑥ Lymphocyte Migration:
  Due to changes in vascular permeability and the presence of chemokines, lymphocytes
  are released from blood vessels and migrate to the injury site. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4),
  a pro-inflammatory leukotriene, and the NF-κB signaling pathway play a role in alleviating
  neutrophil infiltration, thus contributing to the inflammation in SCI. ⑦ Cell Adhesion
  Molecules (CAMs): CAMs are cell surface glycoproteins that facilitate cell-cell
  and cell-tissue interactions. They amplify inflammation and inhibit SCI repair.
  TNF and interleukins enhance CAM function via the NF-κB pathway. ⑧ TNF and Inflammatory
  Cascade: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) enhances NO activity and induces the chemotaxis
  of inflammatory cells, increasing BSCB permeability and promoting the release of
  inflammatory cells and mediators, which hinder SCI recovery. ⑨ Astrocyte Activation:
  Following SCI, astrocytes immediately secrete CSPG, which help form a gliotic scar
  that acts as a protective barrier, limiting the spread of necrotic and apoptotic
  cells. However, the persistent presence of CSPG for months hinders cell regeneration
  and neural repair following SCI (Created in https://BioRender.com)'
