caption: 'Schematic overview of the kynurenine metabolic pathway. The kynurenine metabolic
  pathway starts with the ingestion of TRP through diet. Via the uptake by large neutral
  amino acid transporters, TRP crosses the blood–brain barrier []. From here on, TRP
  is either used for protein synthesis, in the minor serotonergic metabolic pathway
  or for the formation of kynurenine and its metabolites. KYN can either be catalyzed
  to ANA, KYNA or 3-HK. In turn, 3-HK is then either catalyzed into XA or to 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid (3-HANA) and ACMS, an intermediate product which then results in spontaneous
  conversion to QUIN or metabolization to PA. Eventually, QUIN is metabolized to NA
  or NAD+. The kynurenine pathway leads to the formation of three neuroactive compounds:
  the neuroprotective KYNA (NMDA receptor antagonist) in astrocytes and the formation
  of neurotoxic compounds 3-HK, 3-HANA (both generate ROS) and QUIN (NMDA receptor
  agonist and generates ROS) in microglia [,]. Abbreviations: TRP = tryptophan, KYN
  = kynurenine, ANA = anthranilic acid, KYNA = kynurenic acid, 3-HK = 3-hydrokynurenine,
  XA = xanthurenic acid, 3-HANA = 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, ACMS = 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate
  6-semialdehyde, QUIN = quinolinic acid, PA = picolinic acid, NA = nicotinic acid,
  NAD+ = nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide, IDO = indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, TDO
  = tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, KYNU = kynureninase, KAT = kynurenine aminotransferase,
  KMO = kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, 3-HAO = 3-hydroxyanthranillic acid dioxygenase,

  phosporibosyltransferase, NMNAT = nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase,
