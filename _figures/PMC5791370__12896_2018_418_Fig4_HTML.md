caption: Proteomic analysis of the genes in Xllp08 and wild-type E. coli W3110. a
  Comparison of central carbon metabolism between wild-type W3110 and Xllp08. Two
  precursors (PEP and E4P) of the L-Phe synthesis were located in the EMP pathway
  and PP pathway respectively, the distribution of which would directly affect the
  L-Phe production and yield. The red data meant upregulation and green data meant
  downregulation. b The great disparity between two studied strains in the aromatic
  amino acid synthesis pathway. This figure showed comparion of enzymes in the L-Phe
  generating pathway between Xllp08 strain and wild-type E. coli W3110
