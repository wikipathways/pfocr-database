caption: Proposed model of the EPHB2 signaling cascade that regulates the synaptic
  plasticity through the phosphorylation of AKT under neuroinflammation-associated
  perturbation of glutamatergic transmission. LPS intervention influences the glutamatergic
  system, including decreased important enzymes of the glutamate metabolic pathway
  (Glul, Gad1, Gad2), and the elevated pivotal GluN2A receptor of glutamatergic synapse.
  Additionally, LPS elevates the expression of EPHB2, PSD-95 and phosphorylation of
  AKT (p-AKT) in the hypothalamus. EPHB2 may regulate neuroinflammation stress vulnerability
  by modulating synaptic plasticity via possibly facilitating GluN2A traffic, and
  then activating their specifically interacted protein, PSD-95. Next, the phosphorylation
  of AKT leads to the impairment of synaptic plasticity and ultimately depressive-like
  behavior. Molecular symbols with the up red arrow indicate upregulation, while those
  with the green arrow indicate downregulation in the LPS group compared with that
  in the CON. The solid black arrow lines show glutamatergic transmission interactions
  or synaptic plasticity regulation. The gray dotted arrow lines show regulation cited
  previously.
