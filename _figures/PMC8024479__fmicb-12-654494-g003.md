caption: The intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The intrinsic cell death pathway is activated
  by an intracellular death signal. (A) This signal results in the oligomerization
  and translocation of Bak and Bax into the outer membrane of the mitochondria. This
  triggers mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and the release of
  Cyt-c and IAP binding proteins. Cyt-c forms a complex with pro-caspase-9 and Apaf-1,
  leading to activation of caspase-9, then caspase-9 activates the executioner caspases
  (caspase-3, -6, and -7) and induces cell death. The IAP binding proteins, such as
  Diablo and HtrA2, enhance caspase activation through the neutralization of IAPs.
  (B) Under ER stress, three upstream signaling proteins, IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, are
  activated, thus leading to a cascade of activity that induces apoptosis. (b1) The
  prolonged activation of IRE1 can promote apoptosis. Phosphorylated IRE1 recruits
  TRAF2 and triggers a cascade of phosphorylation events, such as the activation of
  ASK1, which ultimately phosphorylates and activates JNK. Then, JNK phosphorylation
  activates pro-apoptotic genes and induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway.
  (b2) The homomultimerization and autophosphorylation of PERK leads to eIF-2α phosphorylation,
  which increases the translation of ATF4. Then, ATF4 upregulates the expression of
  CHOP, which promotes apoptosis. (b3) ATF6 migrates to the Golgi apparatus to undergo
  cleavage, first by S1P and then by S2P, cleaved ATF6 can also promote apoptosis
  via upregulation of CHOP.
