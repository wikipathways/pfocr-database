caption: The ubiquitination pathway. (1) Ubiquitin (Ub) is linked to a cysteine residue
  of a Ub-activating enzyme (E1) via a reaction that uses the energy derived from
  the hydrolysis of an ATP molecule. (2) Ub is transferred from E1 to the cysteine
  of a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2). (3) A complex is formed between E2–Ub and a Ub
  ligase (E3), which is able to bind a protein substrate. (4) Ub is transferred from
  E2 to a lysine residue of the protein substrate. Other Ub molecules can be added
  to the substrate–Ub complex with the same mechanism (steps 1–4). Finally, the polyubiquitinated
  substrate is recognized and degraded by the proteasome, whereas Ub is released and
  ready to start a new cycle.
