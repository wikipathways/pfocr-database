caption: Candidate proteins were uploaded into the Pathway Studio program after manually
  filtering for protein groups with 25–300 total spectra as described. Proteins in
  each group were analyzed for direct interactions and localization as determined
  by Pathway Studio. Binding partners (solid purple line), activating proteins (grey-blue
  line and arrowhead), inhibitory proteins (grey line and bar) are shown. Proposed
  interactions are indicated by dashed lines (-·-·-) and evidence-based interactions
  are indicated with solid lines (—). The plasma membrane and the organelles are illustrated
  to indicate protein localization. (A) Differentially abundant proteins in 67NR and
  in 4T1-MDSCs. Proteins increased (purple to red) or decreased (blue to purple) in
  4T1-MDSCs compared to 67NR-MDSCs. (B) Proteins exclusively detected in 4T1-MDSCs.
