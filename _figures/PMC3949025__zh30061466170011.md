caption: Scheme depicting the inhibition of smooth muscle contraction via CB1 receptors.
  CB1 receptor phosphorylation by GRK5 leads to recruitment of β-arrestin1/2 and activation
  of ERK1/2 and Src kinase. ERK1/2 phosphorylates RGS4 at Ser103/108 and increases
  its association with and activation of Gαq-GTPase, resulting in inhibition of the
  Gαq/PLC-β/IP3/Ca2+/MLCK pathway that mediates initial contraction. Activation of
  Src kinase stimulates 1) M-RIP:MYPT1 association enhancing the ability of MYPT1
  to activate MLC phosphatase, and 2) M-RIP:RhoA association, causing inhibition of
  Rho kinase and decreasing its ability to phosphorylate and inhibit MYPT1. Thus Src
  kinase acting via M-RIP enhanced MLCP activity, leading to inhibition of the Gα13/RhoA/Rho
  kinase/MYPT1/MLCP pathway that mediates sustained contraction.
