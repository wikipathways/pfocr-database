caption: Integration of tyrosine kinase signaling to both cAMP and MAPK 1,2 pathways,
  resulting in cell cycle arrest and the reduction of MAPK 1,2 triggered proliferation.
  A shows signaling pathways from receptor tyrosine kinase through MAPK 1,2 and cyclin
  D1 resulting in proliferation. In the presence of the endogenously expressed AC6,
  activation of the tyrosine kinase pathway leads to a transient inhibition of cAMP
  through an increase of intracellular Ca2+. As a result, PKA would be inhibited,
  not affecting the growth-factor mediated signal transmission through the Raf/MAPK
  1,2 pathway and the cell cycle. In B, the ectopic expression of AC2 could result
  in a PKC-mediated increase in cAMP. The resultant inhibition of signal transmission
  to MAPK 1,2 by inhibition of Raf and cyclin D1 can result in cell cycle arrest and
  in the reduction of the proliferative signal. For reasons of simplicity, PKC-regulation
  of Raf is omitted. RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; PLCγ, phospholipase C-γ.
