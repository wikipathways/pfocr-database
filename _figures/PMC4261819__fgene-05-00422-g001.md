caption: A network of noncoding RNAs negatively regulates NF-κB signaling. A key mediator
  of endothelial cell (EC) activation and vascular inflammation is the transcription
  factor, NF-κB. In non-stimulated cells, NF-κB subunits (e.g., p65/p50) are sequestered
  in the cytoplasm through their interaction with IκB. In response to inflammatory
  signaling, the IKK complex phosphorylates IκB, which is then ubiquitylated by β-TRC,
  leading to its degradation. This results in the release of NF-κB, allowing it to
  enter the nucleus and bind to its transcriptional targets, which include leukocyte
  adhesion molecules, chemokines, and cytokines. NF-κB-dependent microRNAs, such as
  miR-146a and miR-155 impinge on various stages of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and
  play critical roles in attenuating activation of this pathway. The microRNA targets
  that have been verified in ECs are shown as solid lines, and targets validated in
  other cell types are indicated with dashed lines. Flow dynamics play a crucial role
  in regulating EC activation. Laminar flow initiates an anti-inflammatory gene expression
  program that includes up-regulation of transcription factors such as KLF2 and KLF4
  that not only promote the expression of anti-inflammatory genes, but also compete
  with NF-κB for access to the transcriptional co-activator, p300. Laminar flow promotes
  the expression of miR-10a, which negatively regulates NF-κB activity in ECs by directly
  targeting TAK1 and β-TRC. In contrast, oscillatory flow induces - while laminar
  flow suppresses - the expression of miR-92a, which targets KLF2 and KLF4, leading
  to increased inflammation. MicroRNAs can be found at high levels within microvesicles
  (MVs) in the circulation. The effects of MVs on EC inflammatory pathways are not
  known, but may include regulation of signaling pathways or transfer of microRNAs
  to ECs. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) have recently been shown to regulate NF-κB
  signaling in other cells types, but their effects on EC inflammatory pathways are
  not yet known.

  description: A network of noncoding RNAs negatively regulates NF-κB signaling. A
    key mediator of endothelial cell (EC) activation and vascular inflammation is
    the transcription factor, NF-κB. In non-stimulated cells, NF-κB subunits (e.g.,

    In response to inflammatory signaling, the IKK complex phosphorylates IκB, which

    NF-κB-dependent microRNAs, such as miR-146a and miR-155 impinge on various stages

    of this pathway. The microRNA targets that have been verified in ECs are shown
