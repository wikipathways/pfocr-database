caption: Prx II is an essential component of JNK-dependent survival pathway in non-small
  cell lung cancers. Downregulation of ROS level in NSCLCs by overexpressed Prx II
  and thereby activation of MAP kinase cascade to induce phosphorylation of JNK and
  JNK/c-Jun survival pathway which is essential to repair DNA damages. Repaired DNA-damages
  protects NSCLC cells from DNA damage-induced cell death and induces cell survival
  and tumor proliferation.
