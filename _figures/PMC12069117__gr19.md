caption: Transmission of glutamates in a healthy brain. By activating the postsynaptic
  terminal glutamate receptors, glutamate released from presynaptic terminals has
  an effect. Multiple metabolic pathways, specifically CaMK, ERK, and CREB, which
  are in charge of anabolic activation and long-term potentiation (LTP) process activation,
  are promoted by the interaction among glutamate and the NMDA receptor. Excess glutamate
  is carried into astrocytes by the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) and converted
  to glutamine there by the glutamine synthase. Glutaminase then transforms glutamine
  into glutamate, which is then packaged into vesicles using certain transporters
  (VGlut). Vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut); excitatory amino acid transporter
  (EAAT); N-methyl-d-aspartate NR2A and NR2B subunits (NMDANR2A and NMDANR2B subunits);
  extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK); calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase II
  (CaMKII); phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding protein (pCREB); p38-mitogen
  activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK)162. Reprinted with the permission from Ref. 162.
