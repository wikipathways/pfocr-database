caption: Because thrombin cleaves PAR1 at Arg41 and APC cleaves PAR1 at Arg46, the
  tethered-ligand sequences generated by these proteases differ and accordingly result
  in activation of different signalling pathways, which has been labelled “biased
  agonism.” The agonist bias is thus directly related to the cleavage sites of the
  tethered-ligand and the new N-terminal sequence as represented by the TRAP peptide
  that exists after cleavage at Arg41 or the TR47 peptide that exists after cleavage
  at Arg46 []. The conformer subsets of PAR1 that are stabilised by different agonist
  can be different and have distinctly different properties because one conformer
  subset can prefer binding of G proteins, whereas another conformer subset can prefer
  signalling mediated by β-arrestin-2. TRAP and thrombin promote signalling via different
  G proteins while the dynamic conformational ensembles of PAR1 stabilised by APC’s
  action, and presumably TR47, preferentially promote signalling mediated by β-arrestin-2.
