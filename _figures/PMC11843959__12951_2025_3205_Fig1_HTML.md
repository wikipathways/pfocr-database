caption: Schematic illustration of the therapeutic system based on EVs used for the
  delivery of nucleic acid drugs targeting gene mutation sites for the precise treatment
  of CRC with the BRAFV600E mutation. siBRAFV600E was transfected into HEK293T cells
  via a lentiviral vector to stably produce EVs carrying siBRAFV600E. After treatment
  with these EVs- siBRAFV600E, the BRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway was inhibited in CRC
  cells. Subcutaneous xenograft tumor models and metastasis models of CRC cell lines
  were used to validate the therapeutic effects and toxicity of the EVs-siBRAFV600E.
  The efficacy of the EVs-siBRAFV600E was further confirmed via PDX models
