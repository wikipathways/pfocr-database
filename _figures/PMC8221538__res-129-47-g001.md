caption: Indirect effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the heart through
  macrophage-mediated inflammation. COVID-19 causes myocardial injury through either
  direct infection or indirect inflammation-mediated pathways. Using a coculture system
  of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and macrophages, Yang et al demonstrated macrophage-mediated
  cardiac damage by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).
  Tofacitinib and ranolazine are the 2 candidate drugs identified in this study that
  can alleviate this process by (1) inhibiting IL (interleukin)-6/TNF (tumor necrosis
  factor)-α production in macrophages (tofacitinib), (2) inhibiting JAK-STAT (JAK-signal
  transducer and activator of transcription) pathway in CMs (tofacitinib), or (3)
  inhibiting reactive oxidative species (ROS) production in CMs (ranolazine). Figure
