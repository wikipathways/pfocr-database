caption: O-GlcNAcylation regulates oxidative stress signaling pathways. Summary of
  selected connections among O-GlcNAcylation and major redox stress signaling pathways
  described in the text. OGT glycosylates PFK1 and G6PD, leading to the inhibition
  of glycolysis while promoting flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  O-GlcNAcylation of IKKβ and RelA/p65 enhances RelA/p65 transactivation activity.
  O-GlcNAcylation of p53 reduces its polyubiquitination via decreased interaction
  with MDM2. KEAP1 is likely constitutively O-GlcNAcylated to facilitate its interaction
  with CUL3 and subsequent NRF2 polyubiquitination. Upon KEAP1 deglycosylation, an
  NRF2-mediated antioxidant response is activated. OGT inhibition increases TCF11
  protein level and target gene expression, and Nrf1a O-GlcNAcylation, stimulated
  by hydrogen peroxide exposure, also promotes its transcriptional activation. OGT
  inhibition increases HIF-1α polyubiquitination by VHL, suppressing HIF-1α signaling,
  whereas OGT overexpression increases the expression of the HIF-1α target gene GLUT1.
  FoxO4 O-GlcNAcylation is enhanced upon hydrogen peroxide treatment and FoxO1 O-GlcNAcylation
  promotes expression of stress response genes. Please see text for details and references.
