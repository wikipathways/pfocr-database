caption: 'The KEGG analysis of selected DEGs and the resulting schematic overview
  of primary metabolic changes in S. rimosus M527-NAsr: the number behind DEG was
  the log2 (fold change) of transcription level, the dashed arrow indicated multi-step
  reactions, the downregulated pathway was highlighted in blue (fabG: 3-oxoacyl-ACP
  reductase FabG; RS20365: enoyl-CoA hydratase; RS20375: enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase
  family protein)'
