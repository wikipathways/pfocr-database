caption: Cellular and molecular components of bone marrow vascular niche in both healthy
  and leukemic scenarios. The illustration compares the functioning of the vascular
  niche under a normal context and during leukemogenesis. In a physiological scenario,
  HSCs acquire a proliferative profile and differentiated phenotype. PECAM-1 stabilizes
  the endothelial layer. EMCN, in turn, is a potential molecule related to angiogenesis.
  Another pathway associated with vessel morphogenesis is the VEGF/VEGFR. E-selectin
  acts as a promoter of HSCs proliferation. In the AML scenario, there are important
  axes that mediate the anchorage of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) to endothelial cells
  such as E-selectin/CD44 and VCAM-1/VLA-4. Signaling pathways such as VEGF/VEGFR
  and Notch/Dll4, in turn, are related to tumor angiogenesis. GM-CSF is a molecule
  with mitotic properties on LSCs, secreted by VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells.
  Cytokines, especially IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, secreted by LSCs promote the attachment
  of these cells to the endothelium.
