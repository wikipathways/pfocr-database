caption: 'Establishment and interactions in the (pre)metastatic niche. The lower portion
  describes the mechanism through which fibrinolytic factors are involved in the cancer
  cells: autophagy through the Kringle 5 fragment or plasminogen; anoikis due to cell
  detachment with activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through plasmin cleavage
  of the Fas ligand by plasmin; metastasis through pericellular plasmin activation
  via low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) or uPA receptor (uPAR),
  alone or in complex with other membrane molecules (such as integrins or galectins);
  the participation of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), including
  fibrinolytic factors like PAI-1 or PAI-2; the generation of fibrinolytic factor
  carrying exosomes that ensure the priming of the premetastatic niche in distant
  organs (such as the lung) with the establishment of the proteolytic niche. GRP78:
  glucose-regulated protein 78, LC3: microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain
  3B, MMP: matrix metalloproteinase, PAI-1: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, PAI-2:
  plasminogen activator inhibitor-2.'
