caption: 'Our alternative pathway. Different types of enzymatic reactions are shown
  in different colors: removal of NH2 from α-carbon (yellow), reduction of unsaturated
  α,β bond (pink), removal of the terminal NH2 (green), and oxidation of aldehyde
  to carboxylic acid (blue). The enzymatic reactions targeted in this study are encircled.
  The reaction numbers according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes are
  given for known reactions. The E.C. numbers according to the Braunschweig Enzyme
  Database are given for known enzymes. akg = alpha-ketoglutaric acid, Glu-L = L-
  glutamic acid.'
