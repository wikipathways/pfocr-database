caption: Proposed scheme for Lon suppression of osteoclast production. Titanium particles
  stimulate macrophages and other cells to release pro-inflammatory substances (such
  as IL-1β and TNF-α) which bind to the inflammatory receptors or increase osteoclast-related
  cytokines, such as RANKL. When RANKL binds to RANK, NF-κB and MAPKs (including P38,
  JNK and ERK) pathways are activated, following the nuclear translocation and auto-amplification
  of NFATc1. As a result, the osteoclast-relevant genes such as Ctsk, c-fos, Mmp9,
  Dcstamp, and Acp5 are upregulated. Our results demonstrate for the first time that
  Lon inhibited FTase to attenuate the activation of ERK pathways, subsequently resulted
  in decreasing of NFATc1 as well as its downstream gens. Acp5, acid phosphatase 5,
  tartrate resistant; AP-1, activator protein 1; c-fos, Proto-oncogene C-Fos; Ctsk,
  Cathepsin K; Dcstamp, dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein; FTase, farnesyltransferase;
  IL-1β, interleukin-1 beta; Lon, Lonafarnib; Mmp9, matrix metalloproteinase-9; NFATc1,
  nuclear factor of activated T cells 1; RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB
  ligand; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
