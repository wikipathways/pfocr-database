caption: VEGF-mediated metabolic reprogramming for angiogenesis and its involvement
  in BPD and associated comorbidities. VEGF upregulates the expression of glucose
  transporter 1 (Glut 1), PFKFB3, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), and FABP4,
  leading to increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, activation of the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), and lipid uptake and trafficking. This results in proliferation,
  migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells, which subsequently increases
  neovascularization. VEGF signal is reduced during the development of BPD and its
  associated pulmonary hypertension. It is altered in the brain as well, potentially
  leading to neurodevelopmental abnormalities.
