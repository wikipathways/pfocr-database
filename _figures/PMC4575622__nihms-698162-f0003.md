caption: Schematic depiction of ER stress signaling in sepsis, trauma and I/R injury.
  Abundant production of cytokines, hypoxia, ROS and calcium influx are the hallmark
  of these diseases. ER stress and UPR are initially an adoptive response and aim
  to protect the cells from these threats. If the stress is prolonged, or the adaptive
  response fails, sustained ER stress leads to activation of UPR and up regulation
  of inflammatory and proapoptotic signaling pathway via activation of CHOP and caspase-12.
  Upregualtion of CHOP and caspase-12 could lead to cell death and organ dysfunction.
