caption: 'Proposed model by which mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) derived soluble PD‐1
  ligands modulate the activation status and effector function of CD4+ T cells. Within
  this study we have demonstrated that MSCs can respond to pro‐inflammatory cytokines
  secreted by activated T cells. MSCs upregulate their secretion of both PD‐L1 and
  PD‐L2 in response to this stimulus. These ligands bind directly to the PD‐1 receptor
  on the surface of activated (CD25+) CD4+ T cells resulting in a downregulation of
  CD25 and the PD‐1 receptor, with repression of the AKT pathway. A decreased phosphorylation
  of AKT is seen at T308, leading to an upregulation of the transcription factor FOXO3.
  Decreased CD25 expression and IL‐2 secretion interferes with the positive auto‐
  and paracrine feedback loops maintaining the activated state of the T cell. These
  downstream effects ultimately culminate in a decrease in T cell activation and PD‐1
  cell surface expression, IL‐2 production, proliferation and survival. Abbreviations:
  IL‐2, interleukin‐2; sPD‐L1 and sPD‐L2, soluble programmed death ligands 1 and 2;
  TCR, T cell receptor.'
