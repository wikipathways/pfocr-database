caption: The immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting functions of TAMs and MDSCs in
  HCC. HCC TAMs and MDSCs suppress T cell effector functions through their expression
  of IDO, arginase, B7-H1 (PD-L1) and Galectin-9, induction and recruitment of regulatory
  T cells, as well as MDSC-mediated suppression of NK cells. TAMs promote HCC development
  and proliferation through TNFα and IL-6-activated NF-κB and C/EBPβ pathway. TAM-derived
  SDF-1α, VEGF and MMPs induce angiogenesis in HCC. HCC TAMs enhance CSCs through
  IL-6-activated STAT3 signaling. HCC TAMs are found at the invasive front of tumors
  and associated with invasion and metastasis. TAM-derived TGFβ induce EMT and enhance
  HCC metastasis. MMPs disrupt basement membrane and also facilitate tumor cell invasion.
  Surface markers used to identify HCC TAMs and MDSCs in mouse and human are listed
  in blue.
