caption: Role of MNK1 in viral mRNA translation. MAPK pathway is activated by binding
  of the ligands to their cognate receptors (RTKs/GPCRs). With the help of adaptor
  proteins (SOS/Grb2), activated receptors convert Ras-GDP to Ras-GTP. Further information
  in the pathway is conveyed by phosphorylation (activation) of a series of enzymes,
  namely Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 which leads to activation of MNK1. Alternatively,
  MNK1 may be acitivated by p38. Besides regulating cell proliferation, cell survival
  and immune response, activated MNK1 also regulates viral mRNA translation. Activated
  MNK1 leads to dissociation of 4EBP1-eIF4E complex, which results in release (mediated
  via mTORC1) and subsequently phosphorylation of eIF4E. Activated eIF4E is required
  for assembly of eIF4 F to initiate cap-dependent viral mRNA translation. Alternatively,
  MNK1 may modulate SRPK function by directly inhibiting mTORC2-Akt signaling which
  is prerequisite for cell survival during viral infection. Activated SRPK phosphorylates
  SRPs that bind with IRES in the viral genome to initiate cap-independent viral mRNA
  translation. Activated MNK1 also facilitates pre-mRNA and post-translational processing,
  mediated via hnRNPA1 and PSF respectively.
