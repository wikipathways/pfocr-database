caption: Autophagic cell death in lung tumor cells. The combination of pemetrexed
  and sorafenib as well as iron oxide alone can result in the inhibition of mTOR,
  leading to autophagic cell death. Alterations in cellular ATP levels due to mitochondrial
  depolarization have been shown to cause activation of AMPK, an established initiator
  of autophagy. Activation of p53 up regulates the ULK1/ULK2 pathway; not shown is
  that this may occur downstream of AMPK activation. Anacardic acid increases ER (endoplasmic
  reticulum) stress, which can further lead to an increase in Beclin-1 levels, a key
  regulator of autophagy. Loss of PTEN promotes activation of mTOR, which leads to
  inhibition of ULK1/ULK2 and interference with autophagy induction.
