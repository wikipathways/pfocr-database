caption: Flux map of central carbon metabolism for free-living R. leguminosarum Rlv3841,
  grown on succinate and NH4Cl. Net fluxes are expressed on a molar basis relative
  to succinate uptake. The thickness of each arrow is proportional to the net flux
  with the exception that fluxes representing <1% of succinate uptake are indicated
  by broken arrows. Biosynthetic outputs are shown in solid boxes, and metabolites
  treated as a single pool in the model are shown in dashed boxes. Flux identifiers,
  defined in Table S2 in the supplemental material, are shown in italics. The precise
  values for the deduced fluxes are presented in Table S4 in the supplemental material.
  Standard abbreviations are used for amino acids and metabolic intermediates, and
  PPP data represent the reversible nonoxidative steps of the pentose phosphate pathway.
