caption: A schematic of potential mechanisms for natural agent-induced adipose browning.
  Many natural bioactive compounds appear to induce UCP-1-mediated adipose browning
  via several signaling pathways known to promote UCP-1 transcription and mitochondrial
  oxidation in WAT. The signaling pathways involved in the up-regulation of UCP-1
  and its transcriptional regulators are shown. Some bioactive compounds appear to
  induce adipose browning by activating the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway directly or
  indirectly. Activation of AMPK can promote mitochondrial bioenergetics by turning
  on PGC-1α transcription, directly phosphorylating PGC-1α, or activating PGC-1α in
  a SIRT1-dependent manner. SIRT1 activates PGC-1α through deacetylation. The transcription
  coregulator PRDM16 can interact with PGC-1α and PPARα/γ to promote UCP-1 expression.
  Some bioactive compounds likely induce adipose browning by stimulating TRPM8, β3-AR
  receptor, or TGR5, which can lead to the activation of multiple PKA-dependent signaling
  pathways, including those through p38 MARP, CREB, and T3. Ac, acetylation; AC, adenylyl
  cyclase; AMPK, 5’ AMP-activated protein kinase; ArtC, artepillin C; ATF2, activating
  transcription factor 2; β3-AR, beta-3 adrenergic receptor; C3G, cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside;
  CREB, cAMP-response element binding protein; Dio2, iodothyronine deiodinase 2; EPI,
  (−)-epicatechin; LCA, lithocholic acid; P, phosphorylation; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ (PPARγ) co-activator-1α; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C;
