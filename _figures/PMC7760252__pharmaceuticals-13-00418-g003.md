caption: Overview of CDK4/6 and MAPK inhibitors. (a) FDA approved small-molecule inhibitors
  palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib bind to CDK4/6 and prevent phosphorylation
  of Rb (indicated by the star symbol), which can result in cell cycle arrest in the
  G1 phase, block of differentiation and survival. (b) Inhibitors of the ERK pathway
  blocking the prosurvival and proliferative effects of ERK signaling. (c) Inhibitors
  of p38 are controversial and can have opposing effects as p38 is a tumor suppressor
  but can also have tumor promoting effects at later stages of cancer development.
  “T-lines” indicate inhibition, arrows indicate activation and dashed arrows indicate
  translocation into the nucleus. The arrows at the bottom of each panel show major
  outcomes of the signaling networks.
