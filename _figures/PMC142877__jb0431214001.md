caption: Pathway of PG synthesis. In the cytoplasm of E. coli, eleven enzymes (MurA
  to MurG, MurI, MraY, Alr, and Ddl) catalyze the synthesis of the disaccharide-pentapeptide
  subunit of PG. Of these eleven enzymes, Chlamydia spp. encode nine; Alr and MurI
  (boxes shaded in gray) are missing (, ). MurC and Ddl (boxes with speckled gray)
  are encoded as a fused protein in Chlamydia spp. Antibiotics that inhibit cell wall
  synthesis are underlined, while gray-shaded bolts identify the enzymes targeted.
