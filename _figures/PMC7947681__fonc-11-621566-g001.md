caption: Synergy between arsenic trioxide (ATO) and bortezomib in the treatment of
  acute promyelocytic leukemia. 1. There is a significant contribution of microenvironment
  mediated resistance to ATO at relapse (). 2. This resistance is mediated predominantly
  by the NF-kB pathway (). 3. Preclinical studies show a synergistic effect of bortezomib
  and ATO in overcoming ATO resistance (). 4. With the combination of ATO and bortezomib,
  the PML-RARA oncoprotein is cleared through a p62-dependent autophagy pathway ().
  5. The mechanism of the synergy between ATO and bortezomib involved downregulation
  of the NF-kB pathway, increased unfolded protein response, and an increased generation
  of reactive oxygen species in the malignant cell (). 6. This work has been translated
  to a phase 2 clinical trial for relapsed APL wherein we have demonstrated that the
  combination of ATO, ATRA, and anthracycline with the addition of bortezomib is safe
  ().
