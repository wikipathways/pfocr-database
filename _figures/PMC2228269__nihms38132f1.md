caption: 'Mechanisms of cardiovascular dysfunction in diabetes: role of superoxide
  and peroxynitrite. Hyperglycemia induces increased superoxide anion (•O2−) production
  via activation of multiple pathways including xanthine and NAD(P)H oxidases, cyclooxygenase,
  uncoupled NOS, glucose autoxidation, the mitochondrial respiratory chain, polyol,
  and advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Superoxide activates AGEs, PKC, polyol
  (sorbitol), hexosamine and stress-signaling pathways, leading to increased expression
  of inflammatory cytokines, angiotensin II (Ang II), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and NAD(P)H
  oxidases, which in turn generate more superoxide via multiple mechanisms. Hyperglycemia-induced
  superoxide generation might also favour increased expression of NOSs through the
  activation of NF-κB, which increases the generation of NO. Superoxide anion quenches
  NO, thereby reducing the efficacy of a potent endothelium-derived vasodilator system.
  Superoxide can also be converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by superoxide dismutase
  (SOD) and interact with NO to form a reactive oxidant, peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which
  induces cell damage via lipid peroxidation, inactivation of enzymes and other proteins
  by oxidation and nitration, and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).
  Peroxynitrite also acts on mitochondria to decrease the membrane potential (Ψ) and
  trigger the release of proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c (Cyt c) and apoptosis-inducing
  factor (AIF). These factors mediate caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic
  death pathways. Peroxynitrite, in concert with other oxidants (e.g. H2O2), causes
  strand breaks in DNA, activating the nuclear enzyme PARP-1. Mild damage to DNA activates
  the DNA repair machinery. By contrast, once excessive oxidative- and nitrosative
  stress-induced DNA damage occurs, overactivated PARP-1 initiates an energy-consuming
  cycle by transferring ADP-ribose units (small red spheres) from NAD+ to nuclear
  proteins, resulting in rapid depletion of the intracellular NAD+ and ATP pools,
  slowing the rate of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, and eventually leading
  to cellular dysfunction and death. Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) degrades
  poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymers, generating free PAR polymer and ADP-ribose, which
  signals to the mitochondria to induce AIF release. PARP-1 activation also leads
  to the inhibition of cellular glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
  activity which, in turn, favours the activation of PKC, AGEs and the hexosamine
  pathway, leading to increased superoxide generation. PARP-1 also regulates the expression
  of a variety of inflammatory mediators, which might facilitate the progression of
  diabetic cardiovascular complications.'
