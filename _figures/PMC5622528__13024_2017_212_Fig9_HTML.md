caption: The hexokinases link DJ-1 to the PINK1/parkin pathway. a Normal signaling
  through the PI3K/AKT pathway. DJ-1 negatively regulates PTEN which promotes signal
  transduction to AKT. b PI3K/AKT signaling in the absence of DJ-1. Without negative
  regulation by DJ-1, PTEN inhibits signaling to AKT. c The effect of the loss of
  DJ-1 on PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β combined with the hallmarks of aging (e.g. deregulated nutrient
  sensing and mitochondrial dysfunction) leads to the buildup of HK1 in the cytosol
  and activation of the polyol pathway in the brains of aged rodents. d Promoting
  the dissociation of hexokinases from VDAC, inhibiting AKT, and decreasing hexokinase
  mRNA all inhibit parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria in immortalized
  cells. For details regarding HK1/2 shRNA and other AKT inhibitors aside from MK2206,
