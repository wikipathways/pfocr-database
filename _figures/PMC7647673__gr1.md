caption: The Classification and Biogenesis of tsRNAThere are more than 6 types of
  tsRNAs. Each type of tsRNA is processed from mature tRNA or pre-tRNA and has a distinct
  biogenesis pathway generated by different ribonucleases. All of the involved processing
  enzymes are indicated; the major processing enzyme is shown in blue. tRNA halves
  are primarily processed by angiogenin. The major processing enzyme for the tsRNAs
  derived from mature tRNAs is not well known.
