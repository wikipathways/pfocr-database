caption: a Schematic diagram of hair follicles during anagen. b An enlarged view of
  the DP area and the signaling pathways that occur in it. c The molecular mechanism
  of FGF5 signaling cascade occurs in DPC, which changes the wool and the active hair-follicle
  density. The FGF5 protein secreted by the outer root sheath cells binds to its receptor
  FGFR1, causing changes in related signals in DPCs. Among them, the expression levels
  of SRD5A1 and HSD17β2 were changed, and the process of testosterone to DHT was also
  regulated. DHT can bind to AR and further into the nucleus, which positively regulates
  the expression of genes such as DKK1. As an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway,
  DKK1 cascades the AR signaling pathway, and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  to regulate the growth and development of hair follicles. In addition, the Shh signaling
  pathway and IRS-related KRTs and C-MYC also participate in the whole process as
  part of the downstream of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
