caption: RsaC sRNA modulates oxidative stress response during Mn starvation. SodA
  is a Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase which is crucial to response to oxidative
  stress generated by aerobic respiration or by host defence cells (e.g. macrophages,
  neutrophils). In absence of Mn, RsaC is highly produced and negatively regulates
  sodA mRNA translation. It enables to spare Mn for essential Mn-containing proteins
  and avoids the synthesis of a non-functional enzyme. SodM, an alternative SOD enzyme
  using Fe as co-factor, replaces SodA to re-establish the ROS detoxification pathway.
  RsaC may indirectly activate SodM synthesis via the repression of the transcriptional
  regulator SarA. In addition, RsaC could have a broader role in oxidative stress
  response, notably through the regulation of Fe and Zn homeostasis (transport and
  storage) and NO. resistance.
