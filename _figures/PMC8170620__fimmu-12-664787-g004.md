caption: 1.A brief summary of circRNA and LncRNA regulation of signaling pathways
  during M. tuberculosis infection. Hsa_circ_101128 may be involved in the pathogenesis
  of active TB by negatively regulating let-7a and may be involved in the MAPK and
  PI3K-AKT pathways. Hsa_circ_001937 potential miRNA target is miR-26b, which participate
  in the inflammatory response by modulating the NF-κB pathway by targeting PTEN.
  CircAGFG1 can enhance autophagy is achieved by targeting miRNA1257 to regulate Notch
  signal in the macrophages infected by M. tuberculosis. 2.Models involving lncRNAs
  that target the host immune system of M. tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis infection
  leads to upregulation of lncRNA-CD244 in CD8+ T cells, which interacts with chromatin
  modifying enzyme EZH2, and lncRNA-CD244 acts as an epigenetic regulator of IFN-γ
  and TNF-α in CD8+ T cells and suppresses their expression to modulate the TB immune
  response of CD8+ T cells.  Direct stimulatory modification;  Direct inhibitory modification;  Tentative
  stimulatory modification;  Tentative inhibitory modification.
