caption: 'Nelfinavir-regulated signaling pathways which affect tumor cell biology
  or determine the effectiveness of antitumor therapy.Notes: (A) The human immunodeficiency
  virus protease inhibitor nelfinavir triggers both apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell-death
  in cancer cells. Still, nelfinavir also acts as an Akt inhibitor and induces an
  autophagic response that counteracts either mode of cell death. (B) Under normoxic
  and hypoxic conditions nelfinavir suppresses Sp1- and HIF-1α-mediated upregulation
  of VEGF, respectively. Both of these pathways are possibly blunted due to a nelfinavir-induced
  inhibition of Akt, which in turn positively controls Sp1 and HIF-1α. Nelfinavir
  also increases tumor oxygenation. The latter possibly accounts for the radiosensitizing
  effects of this drug. (C) In prostate cancer cells, the antiproliferative effects
  of nelfinavir are mechanistically associated with inhibition of the IL-6/STAT3 axis
  (either at the level of STAT3 phosphorylation triggered by IL-6 or at the level
  of STAT3 binding at deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] in the form of a dimer) and inhibition
  of the Akt pathway. Both of these molecular events eventually result in perturbed
  AR-mediated signaling, due to the fact that STAT3 and Akt serve as transcriptional
  coactivators for AR (shown as a blue dimer bound to DNA). Upward-pointing arrows
  symbolize upregulation, whereas downward-pointing arrows symbolize downregulation.
  The red “X” denotes perturbed pathway or process.Abbreviations: IL, interleukin;
  STAT, Signal transducer and activator of transcription; AR, androgen receptor; SP,
  specificity protein; ARE, androgen response element; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.'
