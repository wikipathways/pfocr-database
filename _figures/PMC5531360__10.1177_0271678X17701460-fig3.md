caption: Possible interactions between signaling molecules. (a) The interplay between
  these angiogenic factors is critical in understanding the molecular mechanism(s)
  of vascular repair. After trauma, active cells release angiogenic factors into the
  injured tissue. VEGF is the key inducer of angiogenesis, which activates PI3K and
  MAPK pathway leading to EC survival and proliferation. FGF2, Ang-1, and EPO are
  also up-regulated at distinct times after TBI and these factors signal through VEGF
  signaling, either by increasing expression of VEGF and/or initiating down-stream
  PI3K and MAPK pathways. Along with pro-angiogenic factors, anti-angiogenic factors,
  including vWF, have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis. Migratory processes are
  controlled by SDF-1α, which activates down-stream PLCγ and RhoA pathway. MMP-9,
  a target of the PI3K pathway, is pivotal for EC migration. (b) Angiogenic factors
  are released into the blood stream which can activate cells from bone marrow. Serum
  VEGF, EPO, and Ang-1 are elevated after TBI and have been associated with postnatal
  vasculogenesis. Similar to angiogenesis, vasculogenesis is mediated by the VEGF
  signaling pathway. VEGF causes activation of the PI3K pathway and leads to the up-regulation
  of NO and MMP-9. MMP-9 converts the Kit ligand to its active, soluble form (sKit).
  sKit is responsible for mobilizing EPCs from the bone marrow. Activated EPCs then
  migrate to sites of injury in a process known as chemotaxis. SDF-1α activates down-stream
  PLCγ and RhoA pathway to induce EPC migration.
