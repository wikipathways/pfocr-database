caption: Summarized metabolic features which were found only in Anaerolineae and Caldilineae
  (left side, blue and green arrows, respectively) or in SAR202 genomes (right side,
  red arrows). The central metabolic pathways (glycolysis, TCA cycle, purine, pyrimidine
  histidine biosynthesis) located in the middle of the figure are general features
  found in all genomes. Lines are dashed when pathways or transporter could not be
  annotated completely (single enzymes of the pathway or single genes from the transporter
  were missing) or could not be annotated in both genomes of one clade. Gray dashed
  arrows indicate that those transporters were not identified.
