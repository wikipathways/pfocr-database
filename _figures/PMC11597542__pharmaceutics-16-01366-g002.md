caption: TLR and RLR signaling pathways and LNP effects. (A) Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
  include TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9, which are located on the endosomal membrane, while
  other TLRs reside on the cell surface. Upon recognizing foreign antigens, TLRs initiate
  downstream signaling cascades, typically through the MyD88 adapter protein, except
  in the case of TLR3. This leads to the activation of transcription factors such
  as AP-1, NF-κB, CREB, c/EBP, and IRF3, which translocate to the nucleus to induce
  an innate immune response. The activation of these transcription factors stimulates
  the production of cytokines, chemokines, and type 1 interferons (IFNs). Endosomal
  TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 recognize RNA, and mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles
  (LNPs) can engage the MyD88 signaling pathway. (B) The retinoic acid-inducible gene
  I-like receptor (RLR) pathway is triggered when cytosolic RNA helicases, such as
  MDA5 and RIG-I, detect foreign RNA, or when STING proteins on the endoplasmic reticulum
  are activated. This pathway signals through the mitochondrial antiviral signaling
  protein (MAVS), leading to the activation of transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3,
  which induce cytokines and type 1 IFNs. LNPs can activate MDA5, enhancing the immune
  response by stimulating these pathways. Reprinted with permission from Ref. [36]
