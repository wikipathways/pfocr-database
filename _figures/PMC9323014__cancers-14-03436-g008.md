caption: The main factors and pathways contributing to microtubule stability and acetylation
  in bone metastasis are shown. The AMPK pathway positively regulates autophagy and
  α-tubulin N-acetyl transferase-1 (ATAT-1). Acetylation of α-tubulin is increased
  by ATAT-1 and can be reversed by HDAC6. Our results show that Runx2 promotes acetylation
  of α-tubulin and microtubule stability. We found that Runx2 inhibits HDAC6 interaction
  with α-tubulin resulting in increased acetylation and stability of microtubules
  and enhanced autophagy flux. Previous reports show that upregulation of the autophagy
  pathway supports tumor growth and bone metastasis.
