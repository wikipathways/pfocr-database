caption: Potential targets of miR-223, miR-98, miR-9, and miR-214 in JAK/STAT pathway.
  The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is a transducer of a wide variety of signals for
  development and homeostasis in animals from humans to flies. In mammals, this pathway
  is the main mechanism of signal transduction from growth factors and cytokines.
  Following the binding of a cytokine to a receptor, the JAK tyrosine kinase activates
  STAT. Upon the activation of STAT, it is dimerized and transferred to the nucleus,
  leading to the regulation of the transcription of target genes. The targets of the
  miR-223, miR-98, miR-9, and miR-214 in these pathway are shown using red arrows
  (KEGG PATHWAY database). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
