caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of the effect of C5b-9 on Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway and autophagy in glomerular epithelial cells. After the activation
  of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by C5b-9, GSK3 was weakened, thus might playing
  an indirect inhibitory effect on autophagy. However, C5b-9 also damaged Akt while
  activating the Canonical Wnt pathway in glomerular epithelial cells, leading to
  the activation of autophagy ultimately. C5b-9 group. C5b-9, complement 5b-9; GSK3,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3; AKT, protein kinase B; PKA, protein kinase A; +P, phosphorylation;
  β-cat, β-catenin.
