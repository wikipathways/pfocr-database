caption: 'Schematic of hypothetical mechanism for CPI-613–induced kidney injury. Under
  physiologic conditions, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is coupled with oxidative
  phosphorylation in the mitochondria to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from
  adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate. Most fuel molecules enter the
  TCA cycle as acetyl coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA); glutamine may also enter the TCA cycle
  by converting into α-ketoglutarate. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) form as a byproduct
  of mitochondrial cellular respiration. At low levels, mitochondrial ROS have physiological
  functions by regulating cellular proliferation and cellular survival in response
  to stress conditions. We hypothesize 2 synergistic mechanisms through which CPI-613
  can lead to kidney injury: increased ROS and ammonia (NH4+) production. Inhibition
  of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) by CPI-613 leads to excess ROS production,
  which in turn causes cellular damage by inducing nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage
  and promoting cell apoptosis. These effects are desirable within neoplastic cells,
  but are deleterious for the surviving nephrons. Furthermore, TCA cycle inhibition
  with CPI-613 may increase glutamine flux through the mitochondrial pathway and promotes
  ammoniagenesis. The process of ammoniagenesis occurs throughout most tubular epithelial
  cells from glutamine metabolism, which produces 2 NH4+ for each glutamine metabolized.
  Excess NH4+ production can lead to tubulointerstitial injury via alternative complement
  pathway activation and increased endothelin-1 levels in the kidneys. Increased NH4+
  levels within renal tubular epithelial cells may increase the susceptibility to
  ROS-mediated cellular damage, creating an amplification loop of cellular toxicity.
