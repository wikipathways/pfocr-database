caption: a, The classical pathway of starch synthesis (modified from a figure in ref.
  ) in which the substrate for starch synthesis, ADP-glucose (ADPG), is synthesized
  in the chloroplasts by ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase). b, The alternative
  pathway proposed by Baroja-Fernández et al. in which ADPG is primarily produced
  in the cytosol via sucrose synthase (SUS) and imported into the chloroplasts via
  a so far unknown transporter for starch synthesis. The model proposes that starch
  is turned over hydrolytically during the day producing glucose, which is phosphorylated
  by hexokinase (HXK) and converted back into ADPG via plastidial phosphoglucomutase
  (pPGM) and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase for resynthesis of starch. Fru6P, fructose
  6-phosphate; GBSS, granule-bound starch synthase; Glc1P, glucose 1-phosphate; Glc6P,
  glucose 6-phosphate; ISA1, isoamylase 1; ISA2, isoamylase 2; PGI, plastidial phosphoglucose
  isomerase; PGM, plastidial phosphoglucomutase; SBE2-SBE3, starch branching enzymes
  2–3; SPP, sucrose-phosphate phosphatase; SPS, sucrose-phosphate synthase; SSI-SSIV,
  soluble starch synthases 1–4; Suc6P, sucrose 6´-phosphate; TPT, triose-phosphate
  translocator.
