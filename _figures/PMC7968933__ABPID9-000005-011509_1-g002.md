caption: Mechanisms through which biological sex could affect BBB integrity. (a) Estrogen
  increases NO production. In the classic genomic pathway, estradiol (E2) binds to
  transmembrane estrogen receptors, which are then internalized and dimerize before
  binding to E2 response elements. The complex then regulates eNOS transcription and,
  thus, NO production. In the non-classic genomic pathway, E2 binds to either ER-associated
  GPCRs or GPR30, which triggers an intracellular signaling cascade including MAPK/ERK,
  PI3K, and cAMP. This then leads to increased eNOS transcription and NO production
  through co-factors such as SP-1, AP-1, and NF-κB. In the non-genomic pathway, E2
  binding to ER-associated GPCRs or GPR30 activates Akt, which phosphorylates eNOS
  at Ser1177 and enables NO production. (b) Increased MMP-9 and MMP-2 or decreased
  TIMP1 and TIMP2 could lead to collagen IV degradation in the BBB extracellular matrix
  and break down claudin-5, occludin, and ZO1 to decrease BBB integrity. (c), Estrogen
  may inhibit the RhoA/ROCK2 pathway to maintain BBB integrity. Inflammatory cytokines
  bind to CCR2, which activates RhoA/ROCK2 to inhibit MLCP. This leads to tight junction
  protein internalization and degradation as well as actin stress fiber formation,
  which contracts the cell and pulls apart the BBB. E2 binding inhibits RhoA/ROCK2
  to maintain the BBB. (d) In the presence of inflammatory cytokines, downstream GPCR
  signaling from E2 binding to ERs leads to ANXA1 phosphorylation, which stabilizes
  tight junction proteins and inhibits NF-κB to downregulate VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression
  on the plasma membrane. This then reduces the inflammatory response and leukocyte
  transmigration.
