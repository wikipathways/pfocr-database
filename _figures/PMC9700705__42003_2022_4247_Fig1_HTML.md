caption: a The classical pentose bisphosphate pathway identified in Thermococcus is
  predicted to be involved in the nucleoside degradation and/or the conversion of
  nucleosides to NMPs. The NMP shunt, composed of NMP phosphorylase, R15P isomerase,
  and Rubisco, degrades NMPs to 3-PGA. b The non-carboxylating pentose bisphosphate
  pathway proposed in this study is shown. Red arrows indicate reactions specific
  to the pathway identified in this study and absent in the classical pentose bisphosphate
  pathway. The locus tags encoding the enzymes whose recombinant proteins were examined
  in this study are shown. Locus tags with parenthesis are genes predicted to encode
  enzymes whose activities were detected in the cell-free extract from H. salinarum.
  Regarding VNG_6270G, both native and recombinant enzymes were investigated. NMP
  nucleoside-5’-monophosphate, R1P ribose-1-phosphate, R15P ribose-1,5-bisphosphate,
  RuBP ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, 3-PGA 3-phosphoglycerate, Ru1P ribulose-1-phosphate,
  DHAP dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
