caption: Schematic representation showing the effect of Uro A in a genetically engineered
  mouse model (GEMM) of PDAC. (A) Ptf1aCre/+; LSL-KrasG12D/+; Tgfbr2flox/flox (PKT)
  GEMM showing sustained pancreatic tumor growth, presence of immunosuppressive tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs), lack of CD3+T cells, and activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis
  within the microenvironment of a highly aggressive Ptf1aCre/+; LSL-KrasG12D/+; Tgfbr2flox/flox
  (PKT) genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of PDAC. (B) Treatment with Urolithin
  A (Uro A) intercedes its anti-tumor effects by targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR kinase pathways
  to overcome immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby reducing TAMs and
  increases CD3+T cells. PKT mice treated with Uro A displayed reduced tumor growth
  and marked improvement in overall survival compared to vehicle-treated mice. Figure
