caption: SSPCM-SRS-M is a simplified single-cell model of the abstract proto-cell
  growing on minimal medium. SSPCM-SRS-M includes all the main cell components required
  for self-reproduction—macromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, membrane lipids) and their
  monomers (nucleotides, amino acids, lipids). Localization of the components either
  in the cytoplasm or in the bilayer cell membrane is considered. An unspecified substrate
  is transported through the membrane by the membrane transporter and is converted
  to unspecified metabolic intermediates via a series of reactions of the central
  metabolic pathway PW1. Energy is synthesized by the electron transport chain (ETC)
  complex on the membrane. The unspecified metabolic intermediates are used to synthesize
  monomers—amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids—through four different biosynthetic
  pathways, PW2–PW5, consisting of sequentially arranged linear chains of reactions.
  Monomers and energy (ATP) are further utilized by polymerization processes (replication
  catalyzed by replisome complex, transcription catalyzed by RNA polymerase complex,
  translation catalyzed by ribosomes (consisting of rRNA and ribosomal protein complex
  (RPC)), and membrane lipid synthesis catalyzed by membrane lipid synthesis enzyme
  (LPE)). The stoichiometries of the energizing polymerization reactions are known.
