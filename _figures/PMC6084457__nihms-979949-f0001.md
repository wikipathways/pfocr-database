caption: 'Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) rely on glycolysis (indicated by orange
  background). HIF-1α both promotes glycolysis and prevents pyruvate oxidation by
  suppressing the PDH complex. The PI3K-AKT pathway promotes ROS production by repressing
  FOXO. Fatty acid oxidation (brown background) is required for HSC selfrenewal by
  controlling cell fate decisions. HSCs are dependent on dietary valine and vitamin
  A, and Gln is converted to Glu by glutaminase, which is partly under the control
  of MYC. Important contributions from BCAA metabolisms regulated by BCAT1 to myeloid
  leukemia have been suggested (green background). The intact mitochondrial function
  for HSC maintenance may include metabolism-driven epigenetic changes or code. Acetyl-CoA
  can be a source for histone acetylation, and IDHs are a family of enzymes catalyzing
  the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into αKG, which is a cofactor for dioxigenase
  enzymes, TET2 and JHDM. Vitamin C is a co-factor for the enzymatic activity of the
  TET family of DNA hydroxylases (blue background). Abbreviations: ΗIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible
