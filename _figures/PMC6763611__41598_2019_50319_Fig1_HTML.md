caption: 'Postulated chorismate dependency in P. falciparum. The shikimate pathway
  consists of seven enzymatic steps for production of chorismate, a branch point metabolite:
  DAHPS, 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase; DHQS, 3-dehydroquinate synthase; DHQ/SDHT,
  3-dehydroquinate dehydratase; DHQ/SDHG, shikimate 5-dehydrogenase; SK, shikimate
  kinase; EPSPS, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase; CS, chorismate synthase.
  Ubiquinone biosynthesis: CL, chorismate lyase; HBPPT, 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase;
  PPHBCL, 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase. Folate biosynthesis: ADCS,
  aminodeoxy chorismate synthase; ADCL, aminodeoxy chorismate lyase; HPPK-DHPS, bifunctional
  6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase/dihydropteroate synthase; DHFS,
  dihydrofolate synthase; DHFR-TS, bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase/thymidylate
  synthase. Both folate, that is converted to dihydrofolate, and pABA can be salvaged
  from the host.'
