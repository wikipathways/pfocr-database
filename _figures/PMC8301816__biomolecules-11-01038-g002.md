caption: A. Role of EPLIN in apical extrusion. Rab5 allows disruption of the connection
  between the cadherin–catenin complex and EPLIN, allowing EPLIN to interact with
  paxillin and plectin to recruit/activate Cav-1, PKA and Myosin II, and acetylate
  tubulin through paxillin’s regulation of HDAC6 activity. Hence, promoting apical
  elimination when Ras-transformed cells are surrounded by normal cells. B. EPLIN
  prospective pathways in epithelium. EPLIN stabilises AJs and actin dynamics by binding
  to the cadherin–catenin complex and actin directly. PDGF/EGF could induce phosphorylation
  of EPLIN via ERK signalling pathways and results in disorganisation of AJs and interruption
  of actin dynamics, which further upregulates expression/translocation of β-catenin
  and ZEB1, diminishes expression of E-cadherin leading to activation of the β-catenin/Wnt
  pathway and promotion of EMT, further impacting cellular functions. This phosphorylation
  of EPLIN can be counteracted by hCDC14A. DNp73 induces downregulation of EPLIN,
  which allows IGF1R to interact with its ligand, then phosphorylate AKT and STAT3,
  which increases expression of Slug and decreases expression of E-cadherin, to contribute
  to promotion of the EMT process. p53 mutation can lead to downregulation of EPLIN
  expression, which results in enhancement of cellular invasiveness. The downregulation
  of EPLIN has been reported to promote cellular functions, which may be attributed
  to phosphorylation of FAK/Src and activation of FAK/Src pathways. Icons were obtained
