caption: Proposed mechanisms underlying P2X7 current facilitation and macropore formation.
  P2X7 (blue) and TMEM16F (16F, orange) form functional complexes, in which both proteins
  are close to each other. In response to brief application of agonist (Ago, green
  spheres), cholesterol (hexagonal rings) maintains functional complex-embedded P2X7,
  and possibly “free” P2X7, in a low channel activity state (black arrows). Long or
  repeated agonist application transitions P2X7 channels from a low to high Po (enlarged
  green arrows), presumably through cholesterol dissociation (small lateral green
  arrows). Meanwhile, agonist binding to P2X7 activates at least two permeation components
  for large molecules, one that occurs directly through the P2X7 pore (component 1),
  and the other through functional coupling to TMEM16F (16F) (component 2). Note that
  the precise dye uptake pathway of component 2 (purple arrows) is unknown. Functional
  coupling with another TMEM16 subtype of unknown composition is also suggested. Membranes
  are represented as grey shadings. 9-AC (9-anthracene-carboxylic acid) is a non-selective
  TMEM16 inhibitor. See text for details.
