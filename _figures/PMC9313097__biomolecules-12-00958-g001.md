caption: Overview of the cAMP/PKA pathway in S. cerevisiae. Pathway activation occurs
  in response to glucose via the GPCR (Gpr1) and Ras-based systems. These systems
  collectively stimulate the adenylate cyclase Cyr1 which increases production of
  cAMP from ATP. PKA is the only known cAMP receptor in yeast, and upon binding the
  PKA regulatory subunit, cAMP promotes allosteric changes, which liberate the catalytic
  subunits from the PKA tetramer. This dissociation activates the C subunit kinase
  activity and enables phosphorylation of PKA targets.
