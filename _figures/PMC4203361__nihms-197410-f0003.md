caption: 'Glutamate is involved in early synapse formation and synapse stabilization.
  A: Synapse formation: after contact of filopodium and growth cone, cell adhesion
  molecules provide a bond between pre- and postsynaptic membranes. Prefabricated
  release packages accumulate and release glutamate, which stimulates the formation
  of the postsynaptic density (PSD). Synapse stabilization: pre- and postsynaptic
  activities need to be synchronized, i.e., the postsynaptic membrane needs to depolarize
  in response to presynaptic glutamate release. Initially, a coincidence of presynaptic
  glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarization is needed to promote an incorporation
  of AMPA/kainate receptors into the postsynaptic membrane, which will stabilize the
  synapse. A more active glutamate system has a higher likelihood of coincidental
  glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarization. B, C, D: Details of synapse stabilization.
  B: In the immature synapse, the postsynaptic site initially has only NMDA receptors.
  NMDA receptors are blocked by Mg + , which is removed by the activation of the receptor
  with glutamate and simultaneous depolarization of the cell membrane. In the mature
  synapse, activation of AMPA/kainate receptors depolarizes the neuron in response
  to glutamate release and provides the depolarization needed to remove the Mg + from
  NMDA receptors. This allows ion flux through the NMDA receptor. The developing synapse
  has no AMPA/kainate receptors, and an initial postsynaptic depolarization during
  presynaptic glutamate release is either coincidental or can be carried over from
  mature, neighboring synapses. C: A coincidence of presynaptic glutamate release
  and postsynaptic depolarization removes the Mg2 + block and opens NMDA receptors.
  D: The initial activation of NMDA receptors prompts the incorporation of AMPA/kainate
  receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. Subsequent glutamate release will trigger
  depolarization via AMPA/kainate receptors, which assist the opening of NMDA receptors.
  Activation of postsynaptic CaM kinase II by the NMDA signal transduction pathway
  is responsible for the incorporation of AMPA receptors ().'
