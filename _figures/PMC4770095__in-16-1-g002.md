caption: . Proposed phenotypes of type 2 DCs. Conventional DCs commonly express CD11c
  and MHC class II. Type 2 DCs exhibit the specialized surface markers CD301b, PDL2,
  and CD11b and several receptors for Th2 cell-related cytokines such as IL-4R, IL-13R,
  IL-25R, TSLPR, and T1/ST2 (IL-33R). Signaling through cytokine receptors upregulates
  the expression of PDL2 and CD301b. Additionally, the ERK and STAT5 pathway upregulates
  CD40, OX40L, and Jagged. Activation of the major transcription factors IRF4 and
  KLF4 inhibits IL-12 production and increases IL-10 secretion. FcεRIII displayed
  by type 2 DCs is responsible for inducing IgG1-related Th2 responses. Altogether,
  these factors trigger Th2 polarization.
