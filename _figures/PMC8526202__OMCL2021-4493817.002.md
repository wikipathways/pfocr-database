caption: 'Oxidative stress in sarcopenic obesity. In older people, oxidative stress
  (Os) favors sarcopenia and obesity through mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress, and imbalance in muscle mass control. Mitochondrial dysfunction
  in sarcopenia is induced by Os due to mitochondrial DNA damage and impaired mechanisms
  for repairing DNA ability, impaired capacity to remove dysfunctional mitochondria,
  decreased mitochondrial quantity and quality, and impaired capacity to generate
  ATP to activate the apoptotic pathways. ER stress and Os are caused by an increase
  in adipose tissue, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance, all of which are
  characteristics of obesity and aging. ER stress induces Os, favoring unfolded protein
  response (UPR) overactivation, imbalance in calcium homeostasis, increased protein
  aggregation, and decreased protein synthesis. Imbalance in muscle mass control occurs
  because Os increases the catabolic activity and decreases the anabolic pathway in
  muscle mass control. Os reduces protein synthesis due to the reduced activity in
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (Akt)/mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR). Os increases the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system
  (UPS) and activates muscle proteases such as caspases and calpains. Finally, due
  to Os, satellite cells'' quantity and regenerative function decline with age and
  obesity. Mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, and imbalance in the muscle mass
  control pathways induce lipotoxicity (Lptx), chronic inflammation, IR, and loss
  of muscle mass, affecting physical function and independence in sarcopenic obesity.
