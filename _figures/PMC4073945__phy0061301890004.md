caption: Working model of convergent pathways to long-lasting phrenic motor facilitation
  (pMF)The “Q” pathway (left; purple) is elicited by intermittent activation of Gq-coupled
  metabotropic receptors (e.g., 5-HT2 or α1), followed by PKC activation, new BDNF
  synthesis, TrkB activation, and activation of ERK MAP kinases (pERK; Ref. ). The
  mechanism whereby pERK elicits pMF remains unknown but may involve changes in respiratory
  motoneuron excitability and/or synaptic strength. The “S” pathway (right; green)
  is elicited by Gs-coupled metabotropic receptors (e.g., 5-HT7 and A2A), PKA activation,
  new synthesis of an immature TrkB isoform, and downstream signaling via Akt phosphorylation/activation
  (pAkt; Ref. ). The mechanism whereby pAkt elicits pMF remains unknown but may involve
  changes in respiratory motoneuron excitability and/or synaptic strength. Although
  important details distinguish them, the BDNF/TrkB system plays a critical role in
  both the Q and S pathways to pMF. Other hypoxia-sensitive growth/trophic factors
  elicit pMF via ERK- and Akt-dependent mechanisms, including VEGF (V pathway) and
  EPO (E pathway). The biological significance of diverse cellular cascades to pMF
  remains unclear, but they may impart adaptability as an animal copes with diverse
  stimuli that differ in (for example) severity, pattern, or cumulative duration ().
  Regardless, the existence of so many hypoxia-induced pathways gives many options
  as we attempt to devise repetitive AIH protocols for therapeutic benefit.
