caption: Cbl-b functions as central gate keeper of T-cell activation. T-cell stimulation
  via the TCR and the second costimulatory signal leads to the proximal activation
  of signaling pathway components. In the absence of costimulation, Cbl-b promotes
  antigen-specific T-cell tolerance. Thus, Cbl-b functions as negative regulator of
  the activation of T cells that can be, however, bypassed by CD28 stimulation. In
  the absence of Cbl-b, T cells are not dependent on a costimulatory signal and proliferative
  as well as cytokine response upon sole TCR-activation is comparable to WT T cell
  stimulated via the TCR and CD28. Note that the signaling cascades and interactions
  are simplified and do not show all molecules involved. For further details please
  refer to text. Flat-ended lines indicate inhibitory interactions. APC, antigen—presenting
  cell; U, Ubiquitin.
