caption: The bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of macrolide antibiotics result
  from inhibition of the 50S subunit of the 70S bacterial ribosome. Erythromycin is
  degraded in low pH environments, such as in the stomach, whereas clarithromycin
  and azithromycin are more acid stable, leading to increased bioavailability. Erythromycin
  and clarithromycin interact more extensively with drug transporters and metabolizing
  enzymes than does azithromycin due to different chemical properties. An interactive
  version of this pathway is available at PharmGKB [https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA166160731].
