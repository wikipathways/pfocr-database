caption: 'SIRS signaling: inflammatory pathways during shock and cytokine storm and
  the production of soluble cytokine receptor antagonists. Damaged tissue during the
  first hit releases pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which initially activate
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on immune system cells (antigen-presenting cells, T cells,
  B cells, regulatory T cells, etc.). These, in turn, promote the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, with the magnitude of this inflammatory response depending on both the
  extent of the first hit and the patient’s pre-existing comorbid state. Regardless
  of the scenario, the immune system initiates signaling pathways that involve the
  dimerization and activation of cytokine and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Through
  their intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, these receptors facilitate
  the formation of signaling platforms that enable the phosphorylation of MyD88. Once
  phosphorylated, MyD88 triggers the formation and activation of the IRAK4/IRAK1/IRAK2
  complex, which subsequently interacts with TRAF6. TRAF6, in turn, activates two
  critical pathways: (1) the IKKα/IKKβ/IKKγ complex, leading to NF-κB phosphorylation
  and activation, and (2) the MAPK signaling pathway, involving ASK1, TAK1, MEKK1,
  and MEKK3. Both pathways synergistically enhance the cellular response to stress,
  promoting pro-inflammatory activity, oxidative stress (ROS and RNS) in the endoplasmic
  reticulum and mitochondria, and the release of inflammatory mediators. While this
  response is initially necessary for damage containment and tissue repair, its persistence
  can lead to an excessive pro-inflammatory state. Depending on the cell type undergoing
  this adaptive process (endothelial cells, epithelial cells, immune cells, or damaged
  cells) and the duration of shock progression, the inflammatory response may become
  overwhelming, leading to a dominant SIRS state. This results in an excessive release
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, culminating in a cytokine storm, which, rather than
  being protective, exacerbates tissue damage and systemic inflammation. Graphical
  elements: Solid red arrows indicate the direct effect of ischemia/reperfusion injury
  and shock progression. Dashed red arrows represent the resulting intracellular oxidative
  damage. Black dashed arrows with triangular heads indicate signal transduction activation
  between receptors and intracellular mediators. Black dashed arrows with double heads
  represent cyclic organelle damage and feedback mechanisms. These arrows help visualize
  the direction and intensity of molecular events described above'
