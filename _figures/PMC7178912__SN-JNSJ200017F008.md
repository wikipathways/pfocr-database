caption: Summary of iLTP signaling pathway. Schematic summarizing the main signaling
  events and molecules that lead to the selective recruitment of α3-containing GABAARs
  into inhibitory synapses of cerebellar MLIs. HFS of parallel fibers from granule
  cells stimulates extrasynaptic NMDARs of MLIs and activates nNOS through the influx
  of external Ca2+. nNOS generates NO, which acts on guanylate cyclase (sGC) elevating
  cGMP which, in turn, stimulates PKG and NOX2. We speculate the production of superoxide
  by NOX2 leads to the activation of PKC and the recruitment of GABAARs via a GABARAP-dependent
  pathway. This signaling pathway selectively acts on α3-containing GABAARs and does
  not affect synapses containing α1-GABAARs.
