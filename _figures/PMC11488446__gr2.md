caption: Alterations in the WNT/PCP Signalling Pathway During the Progression of OA.
  The illustration demonstrates that during the advancement of OA, there's an increase
  in the expression of upstream WNT5a/b and WNT9a. This activity initiates a cascade
  upregulation effect, causing an upregulation in the WNT/PCP signalling pathway via
  key PCP and downstream effector proteins. Subsequently, this leads to an escalation
  in chondrocyte hypertrophy and a disruption in microtubule stability, leading to
  polarised cell division proliferation and chondrocyte clusters. The red colour on
  the right figure shows upregulation in the OA condition, and the blue colour shows
  downregulation in the OA condition. The figure was created with Biorender.com. (For
  interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred
  to the Web version of this article.)
