caption: 'a. Heparosan production pathway from Glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN6P) and
  Glucose 1-phosphate (Glc1P). The pathway involves the uptake of UDP-GlcNAc for the
  production of the cell wall peptidoglycans, whereas UDP-GlcUA is consumed in the
  synthesis of teichoic acid, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides. The
  panel also includes an extended metabolite biosensor (GlcNAc6p) for sensing UDP-GlcNAc.
  b. Heparosan polydispersity, where a beaker symbolizes the produced heparosan, with
  an explanation of the PDI formula provided. Additionally, two Mw distributions are
  depicted as examples: one with low PDI (dark blue curve), and another with high
  PDI (grey curve). The contrast between the distributions highlights the importance
  of achieving a low PDI for homogenous heparosan production. c. Control dynamic strategy
  applied to a generic metabolic pathway for converting precursors S1 and S2 into
  a target product through the action of enzyme E. S1 and S2 are also utilized for
  other cellular processes via enzymes E1 and E2, resulting in the generation of metabolites
  S3 and S4, respectively. Our strategy involves real-time sensing of precursors S1
  and S2 while modulating the production of the opposite enzymes E2 and E1 through
  negative feedback loops to maintain a predefined balance between the precursors.
  This can ensure optimal production of a product despite using the precursors in
  other cellular processes'
