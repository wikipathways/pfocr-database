caption: (A) After latent TGF-β being activated, it binds to the TGF-ΒRII and phosphorylates
  TGF-ΒRI, forming a tetrameric complex. Activation of TGF-ΒRI leads to the downstream
  signalling of TGF-β involving SMAD proteins called TGF-β-SMAD dependent signalling
  pathway or also known as canonical signalling pathway. The phosphorylated receptors
  cause SMAD2 and SMAD3 to phosphorylate and subsequently attach to SMAD4, which amplifies
  signalling. The heteromeric SMAD complex accumulates in the nucleus and serves as
  a transcription factor to activate the transcription of fibrotic genes such as collagen,
  fibronectin, and α-SMA. SMAD7 is a negative regulator of SMAD 2/3 and inhibits fibrosis.
  (B) PAI-1 is a member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily that binds to
  and inhibits the activity of uPA and tPA. tPA and uPA convert plasminogen into plasmin,
  which then activates the pro or latent MMPs into active form of MMPs that degrade
  ECM proteins. TR, resveratrol; ECM, extracellular matrix; TGF-β, transforming growth
  factor β; TGF-ΒRI, trans-membrane receptor type I; TGF-ΒRII, trans-membrane receptor
