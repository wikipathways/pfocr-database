caption: Schematic representation of the pathways that mediate the effects of NANOG
  on COL3 expression by senescent cells. NANOG restored COL3 expression by reactivating
  the TGF-β pathway through transcriptional control of several genes in that pathway.
  Also, NANOG directly bound to SMAD2/3 promoter and phosphorylated protein, which
  might further activate the TGF-β pathway and contribute to restoration of COL3 expression.
