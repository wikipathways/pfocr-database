caption: Schematic diagram of the pathway for the transduction of mechanical signals
  that regulate SmMHC expression and the interaction of this pathway with the IL-13-activated
  signaling pathway. The IPP complex (ILK/PINCH/α-parvin) localizes to integrin adhesion
  junctions and mediates the PI3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt. Activated Akt
  inhibits the translocation of serum response factor (SRF) to the nucleus (red bar)
  and prevents the expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SmMHC). Mechanical
  load imposed on the smooth muscle inhibits Akt activation (red bar) and promotes
  the nuclear localization of SRF and the expression of SmMHC. Activation of the IL-13
  receptor stimulates PI3-kinase and Akt activation, which inhibits SmMHC expression
  and opposes the effects of mechanical load.
