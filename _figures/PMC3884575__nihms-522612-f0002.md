caption: Schematic representation of complement-mediated effects on T cells and APCs.
  C3aR/C5aR signaling on both APC and T cells activates the AKT pathway by phosphorylation
  (among other pathways). AKT activation on the APC stimulates maturation, cytokine
  production, and B7 costimulatory molecule expression. AKT activation on the T cell
  directly promotes IFN-γ secretion, reduces susceptibility to apoptosis, and promotes
  cell proliferation and reduces iTreg generation and stability. In this manner, C3aR/C5aR
  stimulation directly and indirectly promotes T-cell maturation with an expanded
  effector repertoire. Modified with permission from Kwan et al.
