caption: In the methionine salvage pathway, 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) functions
  as a competitive inhibitor of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) that
  mediates methylation at arginine residues. Under normal conditions, cellular levels
  of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) are quantitatively significant than MTA. In contrast,
  due to its proximity to the tumor suppressor gene p16, deletion of MTAP occurs frequently
  in a variety of cancers. The loss of MTAP leads to accumulation of MTA that competes
  with SAM for the binding of PRMT5. Recent studies have suggested that targeting
  PRMT5 could be effective for cancers with deletion of MTAP.
