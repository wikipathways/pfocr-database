caption: S-glutathionylation as a regulator of the JNK and MAPK signaling pathways
  in cancer. This figure depicts several sites in the JNK pathway and in other signaling
  pathways in cancer cells where reversible S-glutathionylation may serve as a potential
  regulatory mechanism (e.g., Ras-SSG, MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1)-SSG, c-Jun-SSG,
  glutathione S-transferase (GSTpi-SSG).
