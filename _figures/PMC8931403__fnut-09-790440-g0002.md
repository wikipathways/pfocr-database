caption: The chemical composition of broad beans promotes induced T regulatory cells
  (iTregs) and improves microbiota dysbiosis. Broad beans are foods rich in flavonols,
  flavanols, isoflavones, chalcones, stilbenoids, jasmonates, alkaloids, and L-DOPA
  that structurally act as the ligands of the AhRL. Upon binding, the receptor is
  translocated into the nucleus affecting the gene expression of several cell types
  that include intestinal epithelial cells, dendritic cells (Dcell), and naïve T cells
  (nTcell). The expansion of iTregs can inhibit autoreactive effector T cells by cell
  contacts and the secretion of TGF-β, IL-10, granzyme, and perforin. In addition,
  broad beans restore dysbiosis and increase the production of short-chain fatty acids
  and microbiota components (LPS) to promote the expansion of Tregs mediated by the
  activation of the surface G protein (GPR) and toll-like receptors (TLR). Furthermore,
  according to our in silico screening, the epithelial and microbiome biotransformation
  of the evaluated phytochemicals present in broad beans leads to more AhR ligands.
  Overall, consumption of broad beans might benefit autoimmune patients beyond their
  nutritional value via the AhR pathway and bifidogenic effects.
