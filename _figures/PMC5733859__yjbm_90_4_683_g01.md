caption: The regulatory structure of the US, EU, and Japanese regulatory bodies as
  relevant to gene therapies. Unlike the FDA and MHLW, the EMA is not a completely
  centralized approval body – developers may pursue market approval also via the “national
  procedure” (single EU state application), “decentralized procedure” (concurrent
  application to multiple EU states) or “mutual recognition” (first via a single EU
  state, then centralized via the EMA). However, ATMPs including GTs are mandated
  to seek approval under the centralized EMA pathway, along with specific therapeutics
  of certain modalities and indications.
