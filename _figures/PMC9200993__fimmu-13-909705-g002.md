caption: Metabolic signaling in the regulation of Treg homeostasis and function. Extracellular
  and intracellular metabolites regulate Treg homeostasis and function in various
  non-lymphoid tissues. Reduced production of ATP activates LKB1 signaling pathway
  that promotes mitochondrial FAO and OXPHOS and mevalonate pathway producing GGPP,
  which enhances FOXP3 expression and Treg function. Uncontrolled production of mitochondrial
  ROS induces Treg apoptosis that facilitates tumor immunoevasion. Increased concentration
  of cellular NAD+ enhances function of the deacetylase SIRT1 that destabilizes FOXP3
  protein and compromises Treg function. Tregs take up microenvironmental LCFAs and
  SCFAs via different receptors. FABP5 binds to LCFAs and transfers them to mitochondria
  in Tregs. Inactivation of FABP5 activates cGAS-STING to promote expression of IL-10
  and type I interferons and Treg function. SCFAs suppress activity of HDACs and thereby
  maintain acetylated FOXP3 and enhance Treg stability. Vitamin D3 metabolite 1,25(OH)2VD3-receptor
  complex binds to VDRE region to enhance Foxp3 gene expression. Distinct amino acids
  differentially regulate activation of mTOR, which can augment glycolysis to suppress
  FOXP3 expression via Myc or evoke TFAM function to restrain methylation of CNS2.
  Activated Tregs elevate uptake of transferrin, which can be converted to reductive
  iron to facilitate the generation of lipid peroxides. GCLC catalyzes the synthesis
  of GSH crucial for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. It functions as a substrate
  for GPX4 to prevent the accumulation of lipid peroxides in Tregs and subsequent
  ferroptosis. Ferroptotic Tregs enhance production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-1β. GGPP, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate; ROS, reactive oxygen species;

  description: Metabolic signaling in the regulation of Treg homeostasis and function.
    Extracellular and intracellular metabolites regulate Treg homeostasis and function
    in various non-lymphoid tissues. Reduced production of ATP activates LKB1 signaling
    pathway that promotes mitochondrial FAO and OXPHOS and mevalonate pathway producing
    GGPP, which enhances FOXP3 expression and Treg function. Uncontrolled production
    of mitochondrial ROS induces Treg apoptosis that facilitates tumor immunoevasion.
    Increased concentration of cellular NAD+ enhances function of the deacetylase
    SIRT1 that destabilizes FOXP3 protein and compromises Treg function. Tregs take
    up microenvironmental LCFAs and SCFAs via different receptors. FABP5 binds to
    LCFAs and transfers them to mitochondria in Tregs. Inactivation of FABP5 activates
    cGAS-STING to promote expression of IL-10 and type I interferons and Treg function.
    SCFAs suppress activity of HDACs and thereby maintain acetylated FOXP3 and enhance
    Treg stability. Vitamin D3 metabolite 1,25(OH)2VD3-receptor complex binds to VDRE
