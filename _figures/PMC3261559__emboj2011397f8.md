caption: Model for the regulatory function of UBD-GEF proteins auto-ubiquitylation.
  A comparison is shown between models of yeast and of human GEF-containing Ub receptors
  of the endocytic pathway. The localization of human Rabex5 and of yeast Vps9 proteins
  is regulated by auto-ubiquitylation. Trans complexes with ubiquitylated transmembrane
  cargo are on the membrane of early endosomes. This trans interaction promotes the
  nucleotide exchange of the Rab5 protein family members that are anchored to the
  same membrane through a geranylgeranyl group. Auto-ubiquitylation of the GEF-containing
  Ub receptors blocks their UBDs in cis, and therefore sequesters them from the membrane.
  It is believed that a specific deubiquitylation enzyme (DUB) stimulates the cycle
  by reversing the ubiquitylation signal.
