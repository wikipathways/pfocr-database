caption: Activation of type I interferon response by viral nucleic acids and pattern
  recognition signaling pathways. Pattern recognition receptors located in the endosome
  (e.g., TLR3/7/8/9), the cell membrane (e.g., TLR4), or the cytoplasm (e.g., cGAS,
  RIG-I, MDA-5) detect viral nucleic acids to trigger a signaling pathway that results
  in type I interferon production from pDCs, macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts.
  cGAS, cGAMP synthase; ds, double-stranded; IFN, interferon; IKK, inhibitor of kappa
  B kinase; IRAK, interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase; IRF, interferon regulatory
  factor; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein; MDA-5, melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5; MyD88, myeloid-differentiation primary response protein 88; NF, nuclear
  factor; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cell; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; RIG-1,
  retinoic acid inducible gene-I; ss, single-stranded; STING, stimulator of interferon
  genes; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TBK1, TRAF family associated NF-κB activator (TANK)-binding
  kinase-1; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; TRIF, TIR domain-containing
  adaptor inducing interferon-β.
