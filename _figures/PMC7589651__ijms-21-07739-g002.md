caption: 'Schematic representation of APP intracellular maturation and its cleavage
  by secretases. (1) β-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes glycosylation in
  the Golgi apparatus and, then, translocates to cell membrane for secretase cleavage
  (2) The increase of APP glycosylation drives toward the non-amyloidogenic pathway.
  α-secretase cleaves APP within the β-Amyloid (Aβ) sequence producing the C-terminal
  fragment α (CTFα) and soluble N-terminal fragment α (sAPPα), which has neuroprotective
  properties. Afterwards, γ-secretase cleaves CTFα into N-terminal fragment (P3) and
  a soluble APP intracellular domain (AICD). (3) The pharmacological inhibition of
  APP glycosylation retains the protein in the Golgi apparatus preventing its transport
  to cell membrane. The reduction of the glycosylation process drives the amyloidogenic
  pathway. (4) In the amyloidogenic pathway, β-secretase cleaves APP producing soluble
  N-terminal fragment β (sAPPβ) and membrane bound C-terminal fragment β (CTFβ). Then,
  γ-secretase processes CTFβ into AICD and Aβ42, which forms extracellular Aβ plaques.
  (5) α-secretase is a member of ‘a disintegrin and metalloprotease’ (ADAM) family
  and, in particular, ADAM10 cleaves APP increasing the levels of sAPPα leading to
  neuroprotection. (6) The genetic deletion of ADAM10 suppresses the α-cleavage of
  APP, decreases in sAPPα levels and increases Aβ42 formation in ADAM10 knockout (KO)
  mice (Adam10−/−). (7) β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) contains N-glycans, which
  are further modified by a glycosyltransferases, namely β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase
  (GnT-III) that is encoded by the Mgat3 gene. In GnT-III WT mice (Mgat3+/+ mice),
  BACE1 localizes in early endosomes and is modified by GnT-III to bear bisecting
  GlcNAc generating Aβ42 elevation. (8) In contrast, in GnT-III knockout (KO) mice
  (Mgat−/− mice), BACE1 is relocated to late endosomes/lysosomes where BACE1 is degraded
  leading to a decrease of Aβ42 levels. (Red/green up arrows: Increase; Red/green
