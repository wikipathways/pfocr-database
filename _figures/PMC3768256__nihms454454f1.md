caption: A schematic diagram of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) pathway. Cells
  activate an ER self-protective survival mechanism called the unfolded protein response
  (UPR) when malfolded proteins accumulate in the lumen of the ER. Upon ERS, the ER
  chaperone protein, GRP78/BiP binds to unfolded proteins and dissociates from the
  UPR transducers, ATF6, Ire1 and PERK to activate the UPR. The adaptive ER survival
  UPR mechanism is required to attenuate protein translation, to induce transcription
  of ER chaperones such as GRP78/BiP, and to induce transcription of ER-associated
  degradation (ERAD) components to eliminate the unfolded proteins and restore ER
  folding capacity. If ER stress is severe enough, then ER mediated apoptosis signaling
  pathways may also be activated to induce GADD153/CHOP and to activate caspase-12.
  The binary switch between cellular survival and death may depend on the balance
  between ER survival (UPR) and ER apoptosis signaling. ER survival signaling molecules
  are highlighted in blue and ER apoptosis signaling molecules are highlighted in
  red.

  description: A schematic diagram of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) pathway.
    Cells activate an ER self-protective survival mechanism called the unfolded protein

    ERS, the ER chaperone protein, GRP78/BiP binds to unfolded proteins and dissociates

    ER survival UPR mechanism is required to attenuate protein translation, to induce

    apoptosis signaling pathways may also be activated to induce GADD153/CHOP and
    to activate caspase-12. The binary switch between cellular survival and death
