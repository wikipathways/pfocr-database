caption: 'sCD83 has strong modulatory capacities in the murine AIA model for RA. sCD83
  within the synovial cavities has four major striking effects on the pathogenesis
  of arthritis: (1) sCD83 induces both, the enzymatic and signaling activity of IDO
  in DCs as well as synovial fibroblasts. IDO leads to local tryptophan degradation
  and increased kynurenine levels, thereby (2) hampering the proliferation and differentiation
  of effector T helper cells and the subsequent reduction of proinflammatory cytokine
  levels. Furthermore, the increasing kynurenine to tryptophan ratio provides an anti-inflammatory
  environment and (3) promotes the differentiation of Tregs. This effect is further
  enhanced by TGFβ, a key cytokine of the non-canonical signaling pathway of IDO.
  The induction of TGFβ and Tregs, and the reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines
  within the knee joints, (4) hamper osteoclast formation and activity. Moreover,
  sCD83 has a direct inhibitory effect on the osteoclastogenesis.'
