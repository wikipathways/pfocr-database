caption: Molecular mechanisms of innate immune activation after SARS-CoV-2 infectionSARS-CoV-2
  enters host cells via interactions between the surface unit S1 of the S protein
  and host ACE2 and TMPRSS2, followed by endocytosis and viral genome release into
  the cytosol. Intermediate double-stranded RNA forms, present during viral replication,
  are recognised as PAMPs by various cytosolic host PRRs, including MDA5, LGP2, and
  NOD1. These PRRs signal through MAVS to activate a plethora of downstream components,
  in turn causing activation of IKKε and TBK1. These kinases phosphorylate IRF3, which
  dimerises and translocates to the nucleus where it activates various transcription
  factors (NF-κB, IRF3, IRF5) to induce transcription of genes encoding type I interferons.,
  ,  The host cell also has type I interferon receptors with extracellular domains
  that bind type I interferons, leading to a molecular cascade via the JAK–STAT pathway
  that culminates in the binding of the STAT1–STAT2–IRF9 heterodimer to the ISRE and
  the stimulation of ISGs, which exert various antiviral effects. SARS-CoV-2 can evade
  the antiviral effects of type I interferons by various molecular mechanisms. For
  example, nsp13 blocks phosphorylation of TBK1 and hence activation of IRF3, and
  various nsps and ORFs prevent phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, in turn preventing
  the formation of the interferon-stimulated gene factor (ie, the STAT1–STAT2 heterodimer
  bound to IRF9). ORF6 also binds importin and blocks nuclear translocation of both
  STAT1 and IRF3, downregulating expression of ISGs and production of interferons.
  ACE2=angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. IKKε=inhibitor of κ-B kinase ε. IRF=interferon
  regulatory factor. ISGs=interferon-stimulated genes. ISRE=interferon-stimulated
  regulatory element. JAK=Janus kinase. LGP2=laboratory of genetics and physiology
  2. MAVS=mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein. MDA5=melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5. NF-κB=nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells.
  NOD1=nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain containing 1. nsp=non-structural
  protein. ORF=open reading frame. P=phosphorylation. PAMPs=pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns. PRRs=pattern recognition receptors. S=spike. STAT=signal transducer and
  activator of transcription. TBK1=TANK-binding kinase 1. TMPRSS2=transmembrane protease
  serine 2.
