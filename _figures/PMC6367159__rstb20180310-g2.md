caption: Pattern-recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated activation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. In the chitin-triggered immune pathway, the chitin
  co-receptor CERK1 phosphorylates RLCK VII-4 members, which then phosphorylate the
  MAPK kinase kinases MAPKKK3/5 and MEKK1. This phosphorylation positively regulates
  the activation of two MAPKs, MPK3/6 and MPK4, respectively. The activated MPK3/6
  and MPK4 further phosphorylate MAPKKK5 and MEKK1, respectively, further enhancing
  their activity. Other PRRs such as FLS2 and EFR activate MAPK cascade likely by
  employing other RLCKs, whose identity remains to be defined. SERKs, SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS
  RECEPTOR KINASES; p, phosphorylation.
