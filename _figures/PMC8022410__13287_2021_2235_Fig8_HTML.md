caption: Schematic diagram depicts how ALPL deficiency impairs DPSC differentiation
  into odontoblasts and a therapeutic method. In Healthy DPSC, ALPL is essential for
  regulating canonical Wnt signal pathway activation, which increases the expression
  of odontoblast-associated gene, DSPP and DMP1, and subsequently promotes odontoblastic
  differentiation of DPSC. In HPP DPSC, ALPL deficiency caused by ALPL mutation, disrupted
  intracellular GSK3β to β-catenin signaling cascade, then impaired odontoblastic
  differentiation of DPSC. While LiCl treatment can rescue the impairment of odontoblastic
  differentiation of HPP DPSC through reactivating intracellular GSK3β to β-catenin
  signaling transduction
