caption: A schematic representation of the Ras signaling pathway. Gefitinib (1) and
  vemurafenib (2) block upstream and downstream of Ras, respectively. Resistance to
  both treatments is commonly observed through modification in Ras signaling. Therefore,
  drugging Ras directly could lead to better treatment outcomes.
