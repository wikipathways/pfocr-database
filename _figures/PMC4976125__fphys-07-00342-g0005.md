caption: ncRNAs as novel therapeutic strategies in cancer metabolism. Targeting cancer
  metabolism represents a novel resource to develop anti-cancer therapies. Now a days,
  there are different techniques developed to specifically modulate metabolic pathways,
  some of them are dedicated to silencing (LNA) or re-expressing (miRNA mimic) ncRNA
  transcripts (Phan et al., ). These systems can be delivered by intratumoral, intraperitoneal,
  and intravenous injections, through systemic adenovirus-associated virus (AAV),
  or in complexes with neutral lipid emulsions (Drakaki et al., ). In addition to
  these technologies, cholesterol-modified miRNAs (chol-anti-miRs) exhibit improved
  pharmacokinetics and antitumor efficacy. Human (1) The development of hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) in persons who are persistently infected with hepatitis C virus
  (HCV) is a growing problem. A phase II trial of the LNA anti-miR-122 is being carried
  out for treatment of HCV infection (Lindow and Kauppinen, ). Xenograft mouse models
  (2) chol-anti-miR-221 effectively suppresses liver tumor growth (Park et al., ).
  (3) Systemic administration of miR-124 suppresses liver cancer growth through suppression
  of the IL6/STAT3 inflammatory pathway (Hatziapostolou et al., ). (4) AAV delivery
  of miR-26a or miR-122 suppresses MYC-driven liver carcinogenesis without affecting
  normal hepatocytes (Kota et al., ; Hsu et al., ). (5) Neutral lipid emulsions (NLE)
  to deliver let-7 which targets RAS and MYC oncogenes, as well as miR-34, reduces
  tumor size in lung cancer (Trang et al., ). (6) miR-101 and miR-376b are miRNAs,
  which negatively regulate the autophagy pathway (Frankel et al., ; Korkmaz et al.,
  ). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-101 suppressed tumor development and efficiently
  reduced tumor size in liver cancer (Su et al., ). (7) Over-expression of miR-101
  can effectively reduce tamoxifen-induced autophagy and enhance the sensitivity of
  breast cancer cells to tamoxifen treatment (Frankel et al., ). (8) Recombinant lentivirus
  administration of miR-30a (inhibitor of autophagy by down-modulating BECN1), can
  enhance sensitivity to imatinib cytotoxicity in chronic myeloid leukemia, increasing
  tumor cell apoptosis (Yu et al., ). In vitro (cell line models). (9) Up-regulation
  of miR-125a in cervical cancer (CC) models sensitized to paclitaxel by down-regulating
  STAT3 (Fan et al., ). (10) Re-expression of miR-30a can sensitize tumor cells to
  cisplatin via mediating autophagy in HeLa, MCF-7 and HepG2 (Zou et al., ). (11)
