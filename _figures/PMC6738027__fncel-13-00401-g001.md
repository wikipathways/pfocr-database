caption: 'P2X7 activation induces cell death via different molecular pathways depending
  on the cell type. In mouse thymocytes, P2X7 stimulation induces P2X7-dependent pore
  formation and a calcium-independent cell lysis via the successive activation of
  a SRC family tyrosine kinase, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the mitogen-activated
  protein (MAP) kinase (ERK/2) module, and the proteasome (). In embryonic mouse NPCs,
  activation of P2X7 does not lead to pore formation but induces mitochondrial membrane
  depolarization leading to calcium-independent lysis of the cell (). High concentration
  of ATP induces P2X7-dependent pore formation in mouse adult NPCs and activation
  of caspase 3 leading to cell death (). P2X7 stimulation induces apoptosis in embryonic
  rat cortical neurons via activation of the signaling pathways JNK1, ERK and caspases
  8/9/3 (). In newborn mouse microglia, P2X7 stimulation induces dephosphorylation
  of AKT, ERK1/2 and cell death (). PI: Pharmacological inhibitors were used to specifically
  inhibit P2X7 or each down-stream enzyme of the pathway. Each of them were able to
  block P2X7-dependent cell death. KO: Cells from P2X7ko mice were used to analyze
  P2X7-dependent cell death pathway compared to cells from WT mice.'
