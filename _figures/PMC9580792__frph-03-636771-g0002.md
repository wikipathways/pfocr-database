caption: Mechanical force disrupts ovarian Hippo signaling pathway and promotes follicle
  growth. Mechanical signals incurred by ovarian fragmentation, incision, drilling,
  or wedge resection lead to actin polymerization that disrupted ovarian Hippo signaling,
  resulting in nuclear translocation of Yes-associated protein (YAP). Nuclear YAP
  interacted with transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) transcriptional
  factors to increase the expression of downstream biochemical signals (cystein-rich
  61, connective tissue growth factor, and nephroblastoma overexpressed [CCN] growth
  factors and BIRC apoptosis inhibitors), resulting in follicle growth. Ovarian damage–induced
  follicle growth started with mechanical stimulation but ended with local biochemical
  changes to promote follicle growth.
