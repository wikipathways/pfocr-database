caption: Host nucleic acid sensing pathways and targets of E6 and E7. A cartoon showing
  cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensors and their signaling cascades inducing type I IFN
  production and ISG expression that are targeted by E6 and E7 (left panel). A cartoon
  showing the effects of secreted IFNs on neighboring cells through activation of
  the JAK–STAT pathway leading to an antiviral state (right). HPV oncoproteins E6
  and E7 manipulate these pathways at different stages, damping the innate immune
  response and establishing a persistent infection. (Created with BioRender.com, 24
