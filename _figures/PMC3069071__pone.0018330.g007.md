caption: Schematic illustration of the interaction of Hedgehog and TRAIL signaling
  in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Death signaling upon TRAIL binding to DR4 normally
  is dependent on mitochondrial dysfunction (induced by Bid/Bim as well as Bak/Bax
  activation) to induce cholangiocarcinoma cell death (Type II pathway), a pathway
  blocked by elevated Mcl-1 protein levels in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Alternately,
  following DR4 ligation, robust caspase 3 activation can induce Type I death signaling,
  a pathway inhibited by XIAP expression under normal conditions. Inhibition of SMO
  expression or activity sensitizes cells to TRAIL via increasing DR4  and decreasing
  XIAP levels, thereby switching cells from Type II to Type I death receptor signaling
  and promoting apoptosis.
