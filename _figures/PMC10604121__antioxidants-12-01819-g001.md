caption: 'Mitochondrial morphology and oxidative phosphorylation: The outer (OMM)
  and inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) are separated by an intermembrane space (IM)
  into which hydrogen ion (H+) is pumped during electron transport. The mitochondrial
  matrix (MM) is within the IMM and contains mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In the mitochondrial
  cristae reside the four megacomplexes of the electron transport chain (complex I,
  II, III, and IV) and ATP synthase enzyme, where adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and
  inorganic phosphate (iP) bind to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate
  generated in the cytosol by glycolysis (metabolic pathway by oxidation of glucose
  for cellular energy) enters the mitochondria and generates cellular energy or remains
  in the cytosol, being converted to lactate-by-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme,
  if mitochondrial metabolism is inhibited. If pyruvate goes into mitochondria, it
  is converted to acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme,
  the main regulator of oxidative metabolism. PDH can be inhibited by the enzyme pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) or activated by increased mitochondrial calcium. Acetyl
  Co A generates energy through the Krebs cycle, and electron donors, such as Reduced
  Nicotin Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) and Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD), pass
  into the electron transport chain to reduce molecular oxygen. This electron flow
  generates the chemosmotic hydrogen ion gradient that supports the ATP synthesis
  process. In addition, the electron flow generates reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  such as superoxide anion (O2−), which are converted into hydrogen peroxide molecules
  (H2O2) by superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2).'
