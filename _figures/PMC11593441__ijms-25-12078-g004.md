caption: Signaling pathways regulating macrophage (Mφ) polarization. Distinct transcription
  factors and signaling pathways influence the polarization of M1 and M2 Mφs. The
  JAK/STAT, PI3K/Akt, JNK, Notch and TLR signaling pathways serve as primary examples
  of these regulatory mechanisms. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) binds to its receptor,
  interferon gamma receptor (IFNGR), leading to the polarization of Mφs toward the
  M1 phenotype by phosphorylating STAT1 and activating the JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway.
  This process also initiates the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes. The binding
  of interleukin 4 (IL-4) or IL-13 to their respective receptors results in the activation
  of STAT3 or STAT6, respectively; this promotes the transcription of anti-inflammatory
  cytokines that drive Mφs toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Additionally,
  upon interaction with its receptor, the Notch protein is activated and the Notch
  intracellular domain (NICD) is translocated to the nucleus. This event subsequently
  enhances the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and M1-related encoding genes
  like mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator (MAML) and CBF1/Su(H)/LAG-1 (CSL).
  There are no precise limits to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway’s ability to
  control M1 and M2 Mφs. IL-1 and IL-4 activate the JNK signaling pathway, which causes
  Mφ polarization toward the M1 and M2 phenotypes, respectively. The MyD88-independent
  pathway of the TLR4 signaling pathway mainly activates interferon regulatory factor
  3 (IRF3) to induce type I IFNs. DLL4, delta-like ligand 4; CRR2, C-C motif chemokine
