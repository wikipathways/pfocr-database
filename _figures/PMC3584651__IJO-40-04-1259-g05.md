caption: Schematic representation of RAS/PI3K/mTOR/STAT3 signaling. Constitutively
  active RAS can regulate the STAT3 pathway in dependent of the canonical PI3K/AKT
  pathway. In addition, RAS can directly activate mTOR via RSK-mediated phosphorylation
  of Raptor. mTOR as a kinase fully activates STAT3, which is essential for RAS oncogenic
  transformation. In RAS mutant cancer cells, therefore, despite suppression of PI3K
  by NVP-BKM120, the RAS signaling still enables to maintain oncogenic transformation
  through activation of the mTOR/STAT3 signaling. Combination of NVP-BKM120 and AG490
  may result in a synergistic effect on gastric cancer harboring KRAS mutation.
