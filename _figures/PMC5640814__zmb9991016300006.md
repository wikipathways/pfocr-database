caption: Schematic model for proposed TIE2 internalization pathways. Here we depict
  the model for TIE2 cellular trafficking. A previous internalization model of TIE2
  upon Ang1 stimulus described the localization of TIE2 to clathrin-coated pits and
  degradation. Following ionizing radiation and subsequent Ang1 upregulation, TIE2
  localizes to caveola structures and phosphorylates caveolin-1 at Tyr 14, regulating
  their nuclear trafficking. In the nucleus, TIE2 binds chromatin and DNA repair complexes,
  directly phosphorylating histone H4 at Tyr51, which is read by the ABL1 proto-oncogene.
  This pathway is involved in enhancing a nonhomologous end-joining mechanism resulting
  in radioresistance of cancer cells. The specific signals involved in the sorting
  of TIE2 toward clathrin-coated pits or caveola structures are not known. Shown are
  possible avenues for inhibition of the described process.
