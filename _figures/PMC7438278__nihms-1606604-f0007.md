caption: The main interrogations of this study marked with bold black font. Loss of
  function of Cops8/CSN is expected to suppress the CRLs shown in green font, which
  in turn disrupts the respective ubiquitination events and thereby blocks NFκB-mediated
  survival signaling and inhibits the apoptotic pathway via increasing BCL2 and hindering
  the activation of caspase 8 (Casp8), steering the death receptor triggered pathway
  to the RIPK1-RIPK3 mediated necroptosis. The pathways in the shaded zone are likely
  involved but not directly examined in Cops8 deficient mice. We hypothesize that
  TFNα comes from autocrinal or paracrinal routes from myocardium with cardiomyocyte-restricted
  Cops8 knockout. Dot line denotes a potential link not tested yet. Psm, proteasomal
  degradation.
