caption: Heterologous enzymes from Cupriavidus necator (CN) are shown in green text.
  The fermentative pathway for glycerol dissimilation is presented in a light green
  box and the respiratory pathway for glycerol dissimilation is presented in a yellow
  box. The activated Sleeping beauty mutase (Sbm) pathway is presented in a purple
  box. Red and blue arrows represent the route to the C2- and C3-fementative products,
  respectively. The C2-fermentative pathway is presented in a red box, while the C3-fermentative
  pathway is presented in a blue box. Relevant enzymes for production of various fermentative
  products as well as the enzymes of the respiratory and fermentative glycerol pathways
  and the Sbm pathway are in blue text. Disrupted metabolic pathways are indicated
  with a cross (X) symbol.
