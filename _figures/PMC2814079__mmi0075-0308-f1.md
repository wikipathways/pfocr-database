caption: A. A diagram illustrating the Tir Y454/451 and Y474/471 actin polymerization
  pathways used by EPEC E2348/69 and C. rodentium. The polyproline region (PPR) of
  Tir EPEC is reported () to recruit a number of protein tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate
  Y474 on adjacent Tir molecules and to maturate an Nck binding site, leading to activation
  of N-WASP and strong actin polymerization. Tir EPEC/CR can trigger inefficient actin
  polymerization via the NPY454/1-IRTKS/IRSp53 pathway. B. Schematic representation
  of the tirCR chromosomal mutagenesis strategy. The genetic organization of the map-tir-cesT
  locus in wild-type C. rodentium is shown in (i). Recombinant pGEMT plasmids, containing
  tirCR mutations were used as PCR templates and the amplified fragments, together
  with the lambda red recombinase, were used to introduce the mutations in tandem
  with an aphT kanamycin-resistance cassette into the endogenous tirCR locus. Distinct
  constructs were used to introduce 5′-specific mock (TirN-ctrl), TirP5A and Tir1−33stop
  mutations (ii) or 3′-specific mock (TirC-ctrl), TirY451A, TirY471A and TirY451A/Y471A
  mutations (iii).
