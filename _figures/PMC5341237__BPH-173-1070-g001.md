caption: Diagram showing key components of the IL‐6 signal transduction pathway that
  could account for lipogenic gene expression in hepatocytes. Signalling is initiated
  when IL‐6 binds to its receptor IL‐6R/gp130 activating (phosphorylating) JAKs which
  in turn phosphorylates Stat3. Activated Stat3 dissociates from receptor, dimerizes
  and translocates to the nucleus where it induces transcription of target genes as
  well as its own Stat3 and Socs3, whose protein is rapidly induced upon IL‐6 stimulation,
  thereby inhibiting IL‐6‐mediated signalling in a classic feedback loop. IL‐6 also
  stimulates the Acc, Fasn and Scd1 gene expression in hepatocytes. To investigate
  the involvement of Stat3 activation in the control of the expression of the lipogenic
  enzymes, we knockeddown STAT3 by use of siRNA. This should prevent the expression
  of Stat3 protein, and thereby interrupt the IL‐6‐mediated gene expression of lipogenic
  enzymes.
