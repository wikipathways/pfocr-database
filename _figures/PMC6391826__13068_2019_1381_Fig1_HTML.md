caption: 'Global map of central metabolic pathways in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 and
  the heterologous mevalonate-based pathway for isopentenol production. The mevalonate-based
  isopentenol biosynthesis pathway was described in []. Broken lines show intermediate
  pathways omitted in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The disrupted pathways
  in this work are shown in grey and indicated with a red “X”. Relevant reactions
  are represented by the genes encoding their corresponding enzymes. Reactions involved
  in isopentenol biosynthesis are displayed with red arrows. Abbreviations: atoB,
  acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; HMGS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
