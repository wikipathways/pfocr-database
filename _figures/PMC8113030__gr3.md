caption: 'Models for H2O2-dependent regulation of the insulin signalling cascade.
  (a) The binding of insulin to the insulin receptor (IR) leads to IR auto-phosphorylation,
  which generates ADP. This ADP can act as a negative feedback inhibitor of IR kinase
  activity. Binding of insulin to the IR also results in the activation of NOX enzymes
  and the formation of localised H2O2, which oxidises two redox-sensitive cysteine
  residues (Cys1245 and Cys1308) in the IR kinase domain, that interferes with the
  inhibitory effect of ADP, thereby prolonging IR signalling activity. (b) Active
  IR stimulates PI3K, a kinase that phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3. Enhanced PIP3 levels
  in the plasma membrane attract AKT and PDK1, bringing both enzymes in contact, and
  allowing PDK1 to phosphorylate AKT2 at Thr308. In parallel, mTORC2 phosphorylates
  AKT2 at Ser473, leading to full activation. This process is counteracted by phosphatases:
  PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3, whereas PTP1B dephosphorylates the IR and AKT2, thus
  terminating insulin signalling. Both phosphatases are susceptible to redox regulation
  and are inactive when oxidised. IR-mediated H2O2 leads to the formation of a disulphide
  between Cys77 and Cys124 in PTEN, whereas PTP1B undergoes sulfenamide formation
  and S-glutathionylation at Cys215. (c) AKT2 activity is also fine-tuned by redox
  mechanisms. Insulin-stimulated H2O2 generation leads to the formation of a disulphide
  located in the PH domain of AKT2 (Cys60-Cys77), which enhances its recruitment to
  the plasma membrane, and subsequent activation by phosphorylation. However, high
  levels of ROS lead to the formation of a second inhibitory disulphide (Cys297-Cys311)
  located in the kinase domain of AKT2, resulting in diminished activity.'
