caption: Biogenesis of sRNAs from bacterial UTRs. A 3′ UTR-derived small RNA can be
  either transcribed from its own promoter in the upstream coding sequence, or generated
  by internal processing of the associated mRNA. The common denominator is the shared
  use of the ρ-independent terminator of the mRNA. Hfq plays a seminal role in either
  pathway such that it facilitates the base pairing of the 3′ UTR-derived sRNA with
  trans-encoded target mRNA(s), but it may also participate in recruiting a nuclease
  (such as RNase E) to the 3′ end of the mRNA in the case of processing.
papertitle: An atlas of Hfq-bound transcripts reveals 3′ UTRs as a genomic reservoir
  of regulatory small RNAs.
