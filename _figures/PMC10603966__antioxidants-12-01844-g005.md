caption: Schematic view showing melatonin-mediated actions in stroke. In neuronal
  cells, glutamate (GLU) interacts with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR), boosting a high
  intracellular Ca2+ and NO• levels by activating nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which
  causes a reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) flux overflow within the cell.
  Subsequently, melatonin’s ability to easily diffuse allows it to enter neuronal
  cells, where it binds to calmodulin with high affinity inhibiting CaMKII (Ca2+/calmodulin
  dependent protein kinase-II), a major mediator of neuronal cell death involved in
  pathological glutamate signaling, thereby mitigating excitotoxicity damage. Furthermore,
  radicals are generated as a result of electron leakage from the inner mitochondrial
  membrane’s electron transport chain; the rogue electrons chemically convert adjacent
  oxygen molecules to produce the superoxide anion radical (O2•). This reactant either
  combines with nitric oxide to form the highly oxidizing peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−)
  or is immediately dismutated by superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) to hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2). Both the Fenton reaction and the kinetically sluggish Haber–Weiss reaction
  require a transition metal, such as ferrous iron (Fe2+), to convert H2O2 to the
  hydroxyl radical (•OH). The •OH damages molecules along with other oxidants, which
  promotes neuronal cell death. In this regard, melatonin acts as a direct radical
  scavenger (directly neutralizes •OH and the ONOO−), regulating RONS overload, as
  well as an indirect agent, boosting antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase
  (GPx) and SOD2, preserving mitochondrial homeostasis and, as a result, enhancing
  cellular energy efficiency. In addition, melatonin attenuates oxidative stress by
  stimulating Nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the principal transcription
  factor that regulates antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated expression of
  phase II detoxifying antioxidant enzymes. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered
  in the cytoplasm by an actin-binding (Kelch-like) protein (Keap1); on exposure of
  cells to oxidative stress, Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1, translocates into the nucleus,
  binds to ARE, and transactivates phase II detoxifying and antioxidant genes. Among
  the spectrum of antioxidant genes controlled by Nrf2 are catalase, SOD, hemoxigenase-1
  (HO-1), and GPx. Melatonin increases Nrf2 gene expression. Melatonin also functions
  as an anti-inflammatory. Thus, DAMPs, released from damaged or dying cells, promote
  pathological inflammatory response through toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). In this
  context, TNF-α acts by binding to its receptor TNFR (TNF receptor), which recruits
  TRADD (TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain). This protein binds to TRAF2 (TNF Receptor-Associated
  Factor-2) to phosphorylate and activate the IKK (I-KappaB-Alpha kinase complex).
  Then, the IKK complex phosphorylates IKBα, resulting in the translocation of NF-κβ
  (Nuclear Factor-κβ) to the nucleus where it targets many coding genes for mediators
  of inflammatory responses. Subsequently, in response to cytokine receptor stimulation
  STAT3 (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) following tyrosine and
  JAK2 (Janus-family tyrosine kinases) phosphorylation, dimerize and translocate to
  the nucleus. In addition, melatonin reverts these pro-inflammatory effects by inhibiting
  the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and NF-κβ translocation. Additionally, melatonin-mediated
  signaling through MT1 receptors promotes PI3K/Akt phosphorylation. Akt coactivator-1-α
  (PGC-1α) complex dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where estrogen-related
  receptor-α (ERRα) codes to sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) gene, upregulating the expression and
  activity of SOD2. In this regard, melatonin is able to activate the multifaceted
  regulator SIRT1, which enhances the stress response by repressing p53 and promoting
  DNA repair. Stimulation (blue colored) or inhibition (red colored) by melatonin
  are also shown.
