caption: Model of miR-3132’s proposed mechanism of action. miR-3132 induced TRAIL-dependent
  apoptosis could be attributed to its putative binding to TLR6. This binding results
  in upregulation of the type I interferon response in cancer cells, which in turn
  activate the JAK-STAT pathway. Subsequently, Stat1/Stat2 are responsible for the
  transcriptional upregulation of TRAIL and TRAIL-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells.
