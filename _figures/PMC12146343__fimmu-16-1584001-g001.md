caption: Mechanisms of gut microbiota involved in the development of AIH. Translocation
  of gut microbiota, alterations in microbial metabolism, and the destabilization
  of immune homeostasis play crucial roles in the development of AIH. Dysbiosis in
  the gut microbiome leads to changes in metabolic products and breaks tight junctions
  of the intestinal barrier. Gut microbiota migrates to the liver and exacerbates
  hepatic inflammation. Alterations in microbial metabolites stimulate ERK and mTOR,
  activating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which triggers the expression of inflammatory
  cytokines and enhances the response of immune cells. Changes in the gut microbiome
  and its metabolites disrupt the balance among immune cells such as Treg, Th17, Th1,
  Th2, TFH, and TFR. AIH, autoimmune hepatitis; ERK, extracellular regulated protein
  kinases; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; NF-kB, nuclear factor-kappa B; Treg,
  regulatory T; Th17, T helper 17; Th1, T helper 1; Th2, T helper 2; TFH, follicular
  helper T; TFR, follicular regulatory T; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; SCFAs, short-chain
  fatty acids; AHR, arylhydrocarbon receptor; BCAA, branched-chain amino acids; TLR4,
  toll-like receptor 4
