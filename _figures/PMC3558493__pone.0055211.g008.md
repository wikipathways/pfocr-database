caption: Our data show that ErbB2 controls microtubules via distinct, but complementary,
  signaling pathways. The Memo/RhoA and the PLCγ/cPKC pathways converge to control
  ACF7 localization at the leading edge, allowing microtubule capture. While PKCζ
  is also required downstream of PLCγ, its mode of action is still unknown. The PI3K/Akt
  pathway contributes to microtubule stability, at later stages, and involves the
  combined effect of the PAK/Stathmin pathway and repression of GSK3 activity. Microtubule
  capture and stabilization allow the chemotactic response to HRG.
