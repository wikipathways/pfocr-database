caption: Role of ILC3s in the response against gut pathogens. The expression of RORα
  in ILC3s leads to intestinal fibrosis in a Crohn’s disease model of S. Typhimurium.
  At the same time, an up-regulation of RUNX3 expression in ILC3s promotes the IL-12/STAT4/IFN-γ
  signaling pathway, which is also involved in the fight against this pathogen. Cytokines
  produced by ILC3s promote the NFkB and STAT3 pathway, both of which are involved
  in the production of lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs),
  inhibiting the growth of K. pneumoniae. The binding between LIGHT and its receptor
  HVEM in ILC3s promotes IFN-γ production which is involved in the defence against
  Y. enterocolitica. In the defence against C. difficile, acetate promotes the production
  of IL-1β in neutrophils via the FFAR2-NLRP3 inflammasome axis, activating ILC3s
  via IL-1R to produce IL-22.
