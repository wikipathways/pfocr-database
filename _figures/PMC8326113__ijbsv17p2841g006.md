caption: Schematic diagram representation of the mechanism of CXCL16 promoting tumorigenesis
  in GC. Cleaved by ADAM10, upregulation of CXCL16 resulted into accumulation of CXCL16
  outside the tumor cells. CXCL16 binding to its orphan receptor, CXCR6, activated
  the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis which led to the tumorigenesis in GC. And during this process
  Akt and MAPK signaling pathway were activated.
