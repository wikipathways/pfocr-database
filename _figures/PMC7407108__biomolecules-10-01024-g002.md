caption: The role of the Hippo pathway in heart regeneration and homeostasis. The
  Hippo pathway plays different roles in different cardiac cell types. When Hippo
  signaling is on (shown in red), it maintains heart homeostasis and inhibits CM apoptosis
  and activated CFs. After an injury, the damaged area in the heart consists of dead
  cardiomyocytes, activated cardiac fibroblasts, extracellular matrix (ECM), and immune
  cells including macrophages and T-regulatory (Treg) cells. When the heart is injured,
  the homeostasis of the heart is destroyed. Damage signals induce an immune response
  that activates resident macrophages, which release pro-inflammatory cytokines to
  induce inflammation and fibrosis. Resting cardiac fibroblasts induced into activated
  CFs and myofibroblasts, then activate CFs which promotes fibrosis in the damaged
  area. Cardiac fibroblasts activation also can be achieved through inhibition of
  the Hippo pathway. In cardiomyocytes, Yap activation induces cardiomyocytes to re-enter
  the cell cycle and proliferate when Hippo signaling is off (shown in green). YAP5SA
  overexpression promotes the generation of new cardiomyocytes and reorganizes chromatin
  accessibility to a proliferative fetal-like state. In epicardial cells, the Hippo
  pathway promotes the secretion of cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFNγ), which recruits
  T-regulatory (Treg) cells. Treg cells inhibit inflammation and fibrosis, promote
  cardiac repair and revascularization.

  description: The role of the Hippo pathway in heart regeneration and homeostasis.
    The Hippo pathway plays different roles in different cardiac cell types. When
    Hippo signaling is on (shown in red), it maintains heart homeostasis and inhibits
    CM apoptosis and activated CFs. After an injury, the damaged area in the heart
    consists of dead cardiomyocytes, activated cardiac fibroblasts, extracellular
    matrix (ECM), and immune cells including macrophages and T-regulatory (Treg) cells.
    When the heart is injured, the homeostasis of the heart is destroyed. Damage signals
    induce an immune response that activates resident macrophages, which release pro-inflammatory
    cytokines to induce inflammation and fibrosis. Resting cardiac fibroblasts induced
    into activated CFs and myofibroblasts, then activate CFs which promotes fibrosis
    in the damaged area. Cardiac fibroblasts activation also can be achieved through
    inhibition of the Hippo pathway. In cardiomyocytes, Yap activation induces cardiomyocytes
    to re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate when Hippo signaling is off (shown
    in green). YAP5SA overexpression promotes the generation of new cardiomyocytes
    and reorganizes chromatin accessibility to a proliferative fetal-like state. In
    epicardial cells, the Hippo pathway promotes the secretion of cytokines such as
