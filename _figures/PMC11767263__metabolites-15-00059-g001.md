caption: Exercise alleviates sarcopenia by regulating multiple signaling pathways.
  Resistance training prevents muscle fibrosis and atrophy via down-regulation of
  C1q-induced Wnt signaling or the PI3K-Akt-TSC signaling cascade to regulate mTORC1
  signaling through Rheb, which subsequently translocates to lysosomes. Aerobic exercise
  promotes an increase in the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio, subsequently activating
  the AMPK/PGC-1α signaling pathway to promote mitochondrial quality control. PGC-1α
  may activate other transcriptional partners including NRF-1/2 and ERR, which subsequently
  drive the downstream transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.
  PGC-1α could enhance the Beclin1 and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and decreases p62 to significantly
  increase mitophagy flux. The overexpression of PGC-1α also helps counteract age-related
  decline in mitochondrial fusion and fission biomarkers such as Mfn2 and Drp1. High-intensity
  interval static strength training upregulated PGC-1α expression in skeletal muscle,
  which facilitated the restoration of mitochondrial function. PGC-1α promotes the
  expression of FNDC5, leading to elevated circulating levels of irisin. Additionally,
  the increased irisin levels subsequently enhanced the expression of UCP1, thereby
  stimulating the conversion of white fat into brown fat. PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
