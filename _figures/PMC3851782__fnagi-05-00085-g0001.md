caption: Metabolic pathway of DNA methylation. HCY/SAM cycle ensures the continuous
  transport of methyl group from SAM to cytosine, providing the raw material of DNA
  methylation. Enzymes are shown in red while substrates and products are shown in
  black. Red line marks the step where the pathway can be blocked by deficiency of
  folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, and such block results in HCY accumulation and
  other biological effects.
