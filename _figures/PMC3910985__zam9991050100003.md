caption: Putative ABE fermentation pathway of C. botulinum ATCC 3502 and effect of
  inactivation of related components on cold tolerance. The genes putatively encoding
  the pathway components are inferred from homology to C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
  No homologues for C. acetobutylicum acetoacetate decarboxylase adc were discovered
  in the ATCC 3502 genome, suggesting inability of C. botulinum ATCC 3502 to produce
  acetone. Acidogenic reactions are presented with dashed, and solventogenic reactions
  with solid arrows. Bold arrows represent the central reactions of the pathway. The
  existence of reactions presented with red arrows is uncertain in C. botulinum ATCC
  3502 due to missing acetone production pathway genes. Insertional inactivation of
  genes crt, bcd, ctfA, and bdh (blue background) resulted in deteriorated growth
  at 17°C.
