caption: Pterostilbene (PTS) prevented ROS formation and reversed palmitic acid (PA)
  mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes
  coding for gluconeogenic enzymes and their transcription factors. PA mediated activation
  of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was also reversed by PTS, which in turn altered
  insulin signaling pathway by phosphorylating Akt and GSK3β. Triglyceride levels
  and expression of SREBP1c, CPT1 and PPARα were also found to be reduced in presence
  of PTS.
