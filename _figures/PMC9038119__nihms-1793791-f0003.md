caption: Schematic representation of tryptophan and NAD metabolism (A), BCAAs metabolism
  (B), and tyrosine metabolism (C). Underlined are metabolites and enzymes that were
  associated with lifespan extension. Red font color represents downregulation or
  depletion from food, while green font color represents overexpression or supplementation.
  Dashed line represents that multiple steps are involved. (A) Supplementation of
  tryptophan, as well as downregulation of the enzymes tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
  (TDO) and kynureninase (KYNU) was associated with lifespan increase. The Preiss-Handler
  and salvage pathways can synthesize NAD + from pyridine bases. Increased levels
  of nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide riboside (NR) and NAD+,
  as well as expression of nicotinamidase (NAMase) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAMPT) were associated with lifespan extension. (B) Branched-chain amino acids
  (BCAAs) are degraded through a series of reactions, resulting in succinyl-CoA (valine)
  or acetyl-CoA (leucine, isoleucine). Valine, leucine, and isoleucine supplementation
  was associated with lifespan extension in mice, yeast, and worms, while downregulation
  of the enzyme branched-chain amino acid transferase (BCAT) extended lifespan in
  worms. (C) The tyrosine degradation pathway converts tyrosine into fumarate and
  acetoacetate. Supplementation of tyrosine and downregulation of the tyrosine degradation
  enzymes tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD),
  and homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase (HGO) resulted in lifespan extension in flies.
