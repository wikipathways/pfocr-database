caption: HDR is a cellular pathway that can be exploited to modify genomic sequences
  via site-specific gene correction of mutations (green box) or insertion of a correct
  gene (orange box). Mutations in the β-globin locus cause SCD and/or β-thalassemia.
  Abnormal β-globin (βs phenotype) is caused by an A-to-T point mutation; therefore,
  site-specific correction of the mutation could revert the disease phenotype. The
  same holds true for some forms of CGD, where the presence of mutation hotspots in
  the CYBB and NFC1A genes make this disease amenable to site-specific correction
  through gene editing. β-globin loss (β0 phenotype) in β-thalassemia or absence of
  the common gamma chain of IL-2 receptor in SCID-X1 is caused by mutations scattered
  around the respective genes. Healthy phenotypes in β-thalassemia (red box) or SCID-X1
  (orange box) patients can be reconstituted via insertion of a correct gene in its
  own endogenous locus or in a ‘safe harbour’ genomic region.
