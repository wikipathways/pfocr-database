caption: Postulated mechanism of BLM-mediated ss and ds cleavage pathways. Pathway
  A requires O2 over and above the O2 required to generate activated BLM and leads
  to the generation of a gapped 3′-PG and 5′-P lesion and base-propenal. An intermediate
  in this pathway is essential for reactivation of BLM so that a second cleavage event
  leading to ds cleavage can occur without BLM dissociating from the DNA. Pathway
  B results in nucleic acid base release and a 4′-ketoabasic site lesion in intact
  DNA.
