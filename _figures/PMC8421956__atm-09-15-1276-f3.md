caption: Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) regeneration pathways. Successful axonal regeneration
  involves both RGC-intrinsic pathways and factors derived from surrounding cell types.
  Within RGCs, activation of the mTOR and STAT3 pathways both stimulate axonal regrowth.
  The mTOR pathway is inhibited by AKT, TSC1, and PTEN, and removal of any of those
  three genes stimulates pathway activation and regeneration. The STAT3 signaling
  pathway is partly activated by external factors, including the neurotrophins CNTF,
  LIF, and IGF-1, all secreted from cells near the RGCs (Müller glia, microglia, and
  monocyte-derived macrophages). Either application of these neurotrophins, removal
  of SOCS3 (a Stat3 inhibitor), or other methods of activating the Stat3 signaling
  pathway induces regeneration. Activated Stat3 localizes to both nucleus and mitochondria
  and is known to stimulate downstream gene expression changes in the nucleus. Also
  intrinsic to RGCs, a de-differentiation event occurs involving downregulation of
  differentiation genes (DGs) and upregulation of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs),
  involving diverse transcription factors which reprogram RGCs to a growth-capable
  state.
