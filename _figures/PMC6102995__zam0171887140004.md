caption: A proposed model showing the redirected carbon flux through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) in evolved strains of T. maritima for additional H2 production. The
  PPP is responsible for generation of glycolytic intermediates and reductants. A
  combination of the PPP and glycolytic pathway can lead to production of up to 8
  mol of H2/mol of Glc.
