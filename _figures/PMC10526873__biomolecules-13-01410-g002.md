caption: GPER-mediated relaxation of VSMCs. Activation of GPER increases intracellular
  Ca2+ levels through transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) isoforms, leading
  to the phosphorylation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMKKβ), AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK), and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIα), which
  in turn elevates the expression of eNOS through the activation of histone deacetylase
  5 (HDAC5) and the Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) signaling pathway. GPER also enhances
  the phosphorylation of EGFR by interacting with various proteins around the membrane,
  such as Src, which further induces the expression of eNOS through ERK5 and muscle
  cell enhancer 2 peptide C (MEF2C). GPER phosphorylates eNOS through the non-genomic
  Akt/ERK pathway, which in turn promotes NO production. NO produced in ECs stimulates
  sGC in VSMCs to produce cGMP, which in turn activates PKG. PKG cooperates with Akt/ERK-dependent
  PKA and Epac/Rap1 pathways to inhibit RhoA/Rho, thereby causing MLCP activation
  and Ca2+ channel opening, ultimately leading to VSMC relaxation. EC, endothelial
  cell; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell.
