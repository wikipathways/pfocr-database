caption: Chemotherapeutic drugs such as Doxorubicin and Docetaxel may also induce
  the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway which may contribute to emergence of drug resistant clones.
  The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway may regulate downstream transcription factors such as GATA-1
  which control the transcription of genes such as XRCC1 and ERCC1 which are involved
  in DNA repair and their aberrant expression may contribute to drug resistance. Treatment
  of drug resistant cells with MEK inhibitors, or combined treatments consisting of
  a chemotherapeutic drug and a MEK inhibitor, may be an effective approach to prevent
  drug resistance. Treatment of certain cancer initiating cells with Akt or mTOR inhibitors
  may prevent their reemergence. Various components of the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  pathway are implicated in drug resistance. Changes in Akt expression may occur to
  mutations at PI3K or PTEN. Furthermore, altered expression of microRNAs may be involved
  in decreasing PTEN expression which results in drug resistance. The roles of these
  various genetic changes in cancer initiating cells are beginning to become apparent.
  Chemotherapeutic drugs are indicated in irregular black elipses. Treatment of certain
  cancer initiating cells with Akt or mTOR inhibitors may prevent their reemergence.
  Signaling molecules promoting phosphorylation events are indicated in green. Stimulatory
  signaling events are indicted in green lines with a green arrow before the target
  of the phosphorylation. Small molecule inhibitors are indicated in red. Inhibitory
  phosphorylation events are indicated in red lines with a block on the end before
  the target of the inhibition. More tentative inhibitory phosphorylation events are
  indicated in dotted red lines with a block on the end before the target of the inhibition.
  Inhibitory signaling or proapoptotic molecules or inactivated molecules are indicated
  in yellow. A growth factor and a growth factor receptor are indicated in purple.
  Active transcription factors are indicated in purple diamonds. Inactivated transcription
  factors are indicated in yellow diamonds.
