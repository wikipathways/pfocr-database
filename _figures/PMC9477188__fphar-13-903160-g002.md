caption: Diagram of the mechanism of curcumin (CUR) in in vitro preclinical studies.
  Mechanism of CUR in psoriatic dermatitis. The cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 released
  by DCs stimulate Th1 cells to produce TNF-α and INF-γ, and stimulate Th17 cells
  to produce IL-22 and other cytokines. IL-17 and TNF-α induced KCs to produce pro-inflammatory
  factors, such as IL-6 and IL-8, causing massive accumulation of neutrophils and
  activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. IL-22 secreted by Th17 cells activates
  the JAK-STAT3 and MAPK signaling pathway. CUR inhibited IL-22 induced phosphorylation
  of STAT3, and reduces vascular proliferation by inhibiting VEGF. CUR reduced the
  secretion of inflammatory factors by inhibiting KCs and further blocks the activation
  of the NF-κB, JAK-STAT3 and MAPK signaling pathway. DCs, dendritic cells; KCs, keratinocytes;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; Th17, T helper 17; IL, interleukin; NF-κB,
  nuclear factor-κB; JAK-STAT3, (Janus tyrosine Kinase)-(Signal Transducer and Activator
  of Transcription).
