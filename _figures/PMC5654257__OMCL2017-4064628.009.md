caption: Schematic overview of the major findings on AmB mechanism of action in this
  study. Within 15 min, AmB caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and induced
  a yet to be elucidated event X, the latter leading to loss of proliferative capacity
  in yeast. These effects were independent of nitric oxide radicals, superoxide anion
  radicals, and membrane permeabilization. After 30 min, AmB induced the accumulation
  of superoxide radicals, which was associated with membrane permeabilization and
  loss of proliferative capacity in yeast, and was partially blocked by beneficial
  action of nitric oxide radicals. Interestingly, the combinatorial action of AmB
  and L-NAME induced a yet to be identified event Y within 15 min, which was independent
  of nitric oxide radicals, and enhanced the effect of event X, leading to enhanced
  loss of proliferative capacity in yeast.
