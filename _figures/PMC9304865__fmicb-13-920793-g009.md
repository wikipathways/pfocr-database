caption: Model of GrxD affects the production of 2,4-DAPG in Pseudomonas fluorescens
  3P24. The production of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG) was previously reported
  to be regulated by the Gac/Rsm signaling pathway and the transcriptional factor
  PhlF. In this study, the levels of RsmA/E and PhlF proteins were modulated by GrxD.
  In addition, GrxD could interact directly with an unknown transcriptional regulator,
  which may influence the expression of rsmA/E and phlF.
