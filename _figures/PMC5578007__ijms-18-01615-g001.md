caption: The canonical Notch signaling pathway. Mammal Notch family members are composed
  of four Notch transmembrane receptors (Notch-1, Notch-2, Notch-3 and Notch-4) and
  five typical transmembrane ligands (Delta-like 1, Delta-like 3 and Delta-like 4,
  Jagged-1 and Jagged-2). Notch receptors are synthesized as single-chain precursors
  and transported to the Golgi apparatus (Black arrow points to the Golgi apparatus).
  In the Golgi apparatus, the precursors are cleaved into an extracellular and a transmembrane
  subunit by furin and modified by glycosyltransferases Fringe. Then the matured proteins
  are transported and inserted into cell membrane (Black arrow points to the cell
  membrane). Interaction between Notch receptors and their ligands triggers the canonical
  Notch signaling pathway. The transmembrane Notch receptor is cleaved by a disintegrin
  and metalloproteinases (ADAM) to remove the extracellular subunit, and then, a multisubunit
  membrane protease γ-secretase catalyzes the second proteolytic cleavage that gives
  rise to the translocation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into the nucleus
  (Black arrow points to the nucleus). In the nucleus, NICD binds with a transcription
  factor (Black arrow in the nucleus), RBP-Jκ (also known as CSL for CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1),
  coactivator Mastermind-like (MAML) proteins, and forms an activated transcriptional
  complex. Then, the activated complex upregulates the expression of target genes
  (red arrow), such as hairy and enhancer of split (HES)-1, -5, -7 and HES-related
  repressor protein (HERP)-1 to -3. The deep blue pentagon represents coactivator
  MAML protein and the light blue hexagon represents transcriptional factor CSL. The
  orange arrows indicate cleavage sites; the arrow with dotted line in Golgi aparatus
  indicates protein glycosylation by Fringe and the arrow with dotted line between
  Notch ligand and receptor indicates the interaction of the two proteins.
