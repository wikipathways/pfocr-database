caption: Immune activating and suppressive effects of DNA double-strand break (DSB)
  signalling. DSBs created by damaging agents such as ionizing radiation activate
  a network of signalling pathways that balance the host immune response. If repaired
  using an error-prone pathway such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or alternative
  end joining, DSBs can result in somatic mutations that act as neoantigens. DNA damage
  can also activate the innate immune system via the STING pathway. DSB-mediated immune
  activation is balanced by concomitant inhibitory signalling, including upregulation
  of PD-L1 expression. Sato et al. show that DNA damage signalling via the checkpoint
  kinases ATM, ATR, and Chk1 drive PD-L1 expression on tumour cells via STAT1/STAT3/IRF3
  activation
