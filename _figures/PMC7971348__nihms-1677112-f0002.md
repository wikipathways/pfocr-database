caption: The polyubiquitin Ubi4 is cleaved to generate ubiquitin monomers. Ubiquitin
  is activated by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) in an ATP-dependent manner; transferred
  to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), such as the putative E2 Rad6; and subsequently
  covalently attached to substrate proteins by a ubiquitin ligase (E3). E3 is responsible
  for substrate selection and specificity. Addition of a single ubiquitin molecule
  to a substrate generates monoubiquitinated proteins, whereas multiple rounds of
  ubiquitination generate multi- or polyubiquitinated proteins. Polyubiquitinated
  proteins are preferentially targeted to the proteasome for degradation. The Skp1-Cullin-F-box
  (SCF) complex (consisting of the linker protein Skp1, scaffold protein Cdc53, and
  F-box protein) and the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) complex (including
  the coactivators Cdc20 and Cdh1) are important for proteasome-mediated turnover
  of proteins involved in the cell cycle and filamentation. UPP proteins and substrates
  with known roles in regulating C. albicans filamentation are indicated in bold.
