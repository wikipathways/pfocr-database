caption: Most enriched molecular networks showing interactions between the significant
  genes (according to SAM)—(a) FOSB, ERK, MAPK3, CYR61, and the RAS-genes; (b) DUSP1,
  ERK1/2, P38MAPK, DUSP9, and RASD1; (c) CYR61 and NFRκB. The gene identifiers and
  corresponding expression values were uploaded into in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
  Networks were then algorithmically generated based on their connectivity in Ingenuity's
  Knowledge Base. Molecules are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship
  between two nodes is represented as an edge (line). The intensity of the node colour
  indicates the degree of (red) up- or (green) downregulation. Nodes are displayed
  using various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product.
