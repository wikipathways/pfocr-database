caption: 'Four signal pathways contribute to stemness properties of cancer stem cells:
  Hedgehog, Notch/STAT3, NANOG, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Hedgehog pathway: PTCH1-induced
  inhibition of SMO is reversed by HH binding with PTCH1, leading to the release of
  the complex of GLI from microtubules, with GLI protein entering the nucleus to transcriptionally
  activate downstream target genes. Notch/STAT3 pathway: DLL binding-induced Notch
  activation causes several kinase proteins activation, further converting STAT3 to
  a transcriptional activator to initiate downstream gene expression. NANOG pathway:
  Ligand binding-induced NANOG activation causes several kinase proteins activation,
  further converting STAT3 to a transcriptional activator to initiate downstream gene
  expression. Wnt/β-catenin pathway: Wnt binds to its receptor, Frizzled to activate
  LRP protein. The activated LRP protein enhances the phosphorylation of the kinase
  (a component of the cytoplasmic complex that promotes phosphorylation of β-catenin
  and its degradation), which inhibits the kinase, further causing the accumulation
  of free and unphosphorylated β-catenin in the cytoplasm that is then translocated
  to the nucleus. In the nucleus, β-catenin binds to other transcriptional factors
  to promote downstream target gene expression.'
