caption: Production and metabolism of signaling sphingolipids. CER can be produced
  by an initial reaction via de novo synthesis pathway, which involves the decarboxylation
  of a serine residue and condensation with a fatty acyl-CoA that is catalyzed by
  SPT. It can also be produced by hydrolysis of SM through different SMases. Subsequent
  enzymatic reactions are catalyzed by 3-keto dihydrosphingosine reductase, CerS,
  and dihydro-CER desaturases (sphingolipid δ (4)-desaturase DES1 and sphingolipid
  δ(4)-desaturase/C4 monooxygenase DES2), which determine the production of CER or
  related precursors for the majority of many other active sphingolipids such as SPH
  and S1P. C1PP, ceramide-1-phosphate phosphatase; CDase, ceramidases; CER, ceramide;
  CK, ceramide kinase; CerS, ceramide synthase; DAG, diacylglycerol; GCase, glucocylceramidase;
