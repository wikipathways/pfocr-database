caption: '(A) Schematic in vivo biosynthetic pathway from 18:3n3 and 18:2n6 mediated
  by ELOVL4 and other ELOVL family proteins. Desaturase and elongation steps are consecutively
  performed by fatty acid desaturase-1 (FADS1 or Δ5 desaturase), fatty acid desaturase-2
  (FADS2 or Δ6 desaturase), and ELOVL1–5. Although some elongases are specific for
  a single step, others are nonspecific or multi-functional and act at several steps
  (e.g., human ELOVL5 and murine ELOVL2). A is an adapted reproduction from: . J.
