caption: MARV replication cycle. MARV attaches to the surface of target cells by binding
  to attachment factors (1); following endocytosis (2); glycoprotein subunit GP1 is
  cleaved by endosomal proteases (3) facilitating binding to Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1);
  the entry receptor (4); fusion is mediated in a pH-dependent manner by glycoprotein
  subunit GP2. Following release of viral nucleocapsid into the cytosol (5); transcription
  of the viral genome takes place (6); mRNA is subsequently translated by the host
  cell machinery (7); synthesis of GP takes place at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  and undergoes multiple post-translational modifications on its way through the classical
  secretory pathway (8); positive sense antigenomes are synthesized from the incoming
  viral genomes (9); these intermediate products then serve as templates to replicate
  new negative-sense genomes (10); after cleavage in the Golgi, GP is transported
  to multivesicular bodies (MVB) and to the cell membrane where budding takes place
  preferentially from filopodia (11); nucleocapsids and viral protein (VP) 24 are
  also recruited to sites of viral budding (12); which is mainly driven by VP40 (13);
