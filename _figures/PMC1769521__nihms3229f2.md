caption: 'Telomeric and nontelomeric signals induce senescence via tumor suppressor
  pathways in human and mouse cellsInduction of p21 and p16 by senescence-inducing
  signals results in inhibition of activity of CDK2 and CDK4/6. Downregulation of
  activity of these pRB kinases leads to pRB hypophosphorylation, which results in
  cell cycle arrest during senescence. Regulators of senescence pathways in human
  and mouse cells include PML, MDM2, ID1, Bmi-1, CBX7, and Seladin-1. In mouse cells,
  tumor suppressor ARF is negatively regulated by two potential oncogenes, TBX2 and
  Pokemon, and positively regulated by DMP-1.A: In human cells, telomeric and nontelomeric
  signals induce senescence primarily via the p53-p21-pRB pathway. Nontelomeric signals
  also induce the p16-pRB pathway of senescence in human cells.B: Mouse cells undergo
  senescence via the ARF-p53-p21-pRB pathway in response to nontelomeric signals.
  Mouse cells do not senesce by the telomeric signal-induced pathway of senescence.Solid
  lines indicate principal pathways of senescence, while dotted lines indicate auxiliary
  pathways that can modulate senescence. The red letters indicate tumor suppressors
  and growth inhibitors, while the green letters indicate oncogenes and growth promoters.'
