caption: Trop2 signaling. Trop2 contains a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, an extracellular
  domain, and an intracellular domain. Its cytoplasmic domain plays an important role
  in signaling and contains a PIP2 binding sequence. When PIP2 binds to Trop2, the
  intracellular domain of Trop2 can also be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC).
  This fosters PIP2 cleavage by phospholipase C and releases IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate)
  into the cytoplasm, leaving DAG (deacylglycerol) on the plasma membrane. The IP3
  generates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and enables more PKC activation
  for Trop2 phosphorylation and the promotion of the MAPK pathway [,]. As PKC and
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as ERK1/2 are recruited in this transmembrane
  calcium signal transduction, they contribute towards cancer cell growth via cell
  cycle regulations []. Trop2 is cleaved into two parts, an intra- and an extracellular
  domain, via regulated intramembrane proteolysis, which involves TNF-α converting
  enzyme (TACE), γ-secretase, presenilin 1 (PS-1), and presenilin 2 (PS-2) []. The
  intracellular domain is released into the nucleus while the extracellular domain
  is either released into the cytoplasm or lingers on the membrane. In the nucleus,
  β-catenin colocalizes with the Trop2 intracellular domain to upregulate Cyclin D1
  and c-myc, which fosters cell growth. The surge in c-myc has been associated towards
  PARP1 upregulation [], while the upregulation of Cyclin D1 is significant for cell
  growth enhancement, the increasing the expression of enzymes in Trop2 proteolysis
  (PS2 and TACE), and the inhibition of Numb, an inhibitor against the Trop2 proteolytic
  complex []. Trop2 is also responsible for fostering cell motility via β1 integrin-RACK1-FAK-Src
  signaling axis [,,]. Trop2 re-localizes β1 integrins from FAs to the leading edge
  and recruits RACK1 into the cell membrane, which prevents the α5β1 integrin complex
  from binding to fibronectin []. By forming a complex with β1 integrin and talin,
  Trop2 activates FAK to reduce cell adhesion and to promote motility [].
