caption: P. cembroides gene interaction network. Juvenile (orange circle) versus adult
  (purple circle) differentially expressed genes (via reference organism Arabidopsis
  thaliana) associated with cuticle and cell wall synthesis, development, and the
  phenylpropanoid pathway (grouped under dashed lines) collectively run through GeneMANIA.
  Related genes (gray circle) and co‐expression interactions (purple), genetic interactions
  (green), physical interactions (pink), predicted interactions (orange), shared protein
  domains (teal), and co‐localization interactions (blue) are represented. The fold
  change significance of the eight down‐regulated and 78 up‐regulated genes is depicted
  by the increased color saturation from the midpoint of zero to −9.32 and 9.32
