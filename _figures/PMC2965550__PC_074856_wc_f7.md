caption: IAA Biosynthesis Pathways in Arabidopsis Regulated by Cytokinin.Putative
  IAA biosynthesis pathways in Arabidopsis, with genes shown to be differentially
  regulated in the microarray and/or qPCR analysis indicated (up,red; down, blue).
  Genes and pathways that are more strongly upregulated are indicated with red arrows
  and a pink background, respectively. A dotted arrow indicates that there is more
  than one enzymatic step involved in the pathway.
