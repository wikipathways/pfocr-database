caption: 'The mechanisms of oxidative stress leading to adverse clinical outcomes
  during COVID-19 infection in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. In T1DM, hyperglycemia
  is a potent mediator of oxidative stress through four different pathways whose accumulative
  effect is the overproduction of superoxide, which leads to endothelial dysfunction
  and the subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The destroyed endothelial
  cells release pro-coagulant molecules and express adhesion molecules. Simultaneously,
  hyperglycemia through the activation of the PKC pathway increases the expression
  of adhesion molecules, contributing additionally to endothelial dysfunction, and
  this leads to platelet activation and aggregation. During COVID-19 infection, the
  binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) results in the increased
  production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn increases NO formation
  and leads to cytopathic hypoxia. Hypoxia via the formation of free radicals upregulates
  the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which promotes endothelial derangement
  and contributes to pro-coagulability. Additionally, the upregulation of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, in a vicious cycle, activate macrophages and neutrophils to produce more
  free radicals. Neutrophils have been recognized as pivotal mediators of severe COVID-19
  disease by triggering the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and maintaining
  the inflammatory state in the lungs. AGEs: advanced glycation end products; GSH:
  glutathione; NADPH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NF-kB: nuclear
  factor-kB; NLRP3: NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3; NO: nitric
  oxide; PKC: protein kinase C; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
