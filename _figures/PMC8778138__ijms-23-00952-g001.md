caption: Potential pathways affected by mtDNA mutations and associated with CVD. The
  mtDNA mutations lead to a decreased level of tRNAs and protein synthesis (including
  proteins involved in mitochondrial OXPHOS), and increased ROS production and, subsequently,
  mitochondrial oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. High ROS levels tend to cause
  more mutations in mtDNA during its replication. OXPHOS malfunction leads to lower
  ATP output and the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, thus changing
  the ATP/ADP ratio, interrupting normal ion traffic and stimulating glycolysis as
  an alternative ATP-generation pathway. An impaired Ca2+ metabolism can cause the
  accumulation of Ca2+ in the cytosol, with low concentrations in mitochondria and
  extracellular space, which may result in cell swelling and death. Red arrows represent
  decrease, blue – increase of a particular process/parameter.
