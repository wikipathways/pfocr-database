caption: N-assimilatory proline and putrescine pathways in the responses of tobacco
  to Psph. Results from individual metabolites are displayed around the assimilatory
  pathway of  and  in plants linking through to proline, polyamine, and GABA. Note
  the position of NR encoded by the nia gene and its role in N assimilation and NO
  generation. The pathways were adapted from the Plant Metabolic network (http://www.plantcyc.org/).
  Broken arrows indicate multiple steps. Metabolites were detected by GC-MS in -fed
  and -fed tobacco leaves following inoculation with Psph or mock inoculation with
  10mM MgCl2. Results are shown for glutamine (A), glutamate (B), ornithine (C), citrulline
  (D), proline (E), putrescine (F), GABA (G), and spermidine (H). Data are displayed
  as the percentage of relative intensity (% RI). Different letters denote groupings
  within which non-significant differences were observed but which were significantly
  different (P < 0.05) from all other groups.
