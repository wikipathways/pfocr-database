caption: Model for the UPR-induced HAdV infection boost by GCA. ER stress can be induced
  by abnormal ER-associated lipids, redox potential, glycosylation, or protein flux
  through the secretory pathway or by the depletion of calcium ions, for example,
  by the Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (). Cells sense ER stress by three major
  pathways, the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6), the PKR-like ER kinase
  (PERK), and the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1) pathways. Here we show that
  the small compound golgicide A (GCA), which blocks the guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor GBF-1 of Arf GTPases, implicated in ER-Golgi apparatus membrane transport,
  induces the IRE-1/X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) branch of the UPR (green arrows).
  GCA and, in some cases, the knockdown of GBF-1 by siRNA enhance infection of cancer
  cells with both replicating and nonreplicating HAdV of the C and B species. This
  requires the RNase activity of IRE-1 and leads to the splicing of the XBP-1 mRNA
  in the cytoplasm, yielding an mRNA which encodes the active XBP-1 transcription
  factor (also dubbed XBP-1s). XBP-1 splicing can be blocked by the IRE-1 RNase inhibitor
  4μ8C (). XBP-1s may enhance the transcription of both host and viral genes and thereby
  boost early and late viral gene expression, virus release from infected cells, and
  viral spreading. Besides the XBP-1 branch, IRE-1 also signals through regulated
  IRE-1-dependent decay (RIDD), generating double-stranded RNA (RNA*) and leading
  to the activation of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), the nuclear factor
  kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and downstream cytokines
  and chemokines, which may boost HAdV infection (, ). A third output from IRE-1 signaling
  is the degradation of microRNA 17 (miR17), an inhibitor of the apoptotic caspase
  2 (). If this pathway is triggered by GCA, it may enhance HAdV-induced cell killing.
  Green arrows, the GCA pathway activating the IRE-1/XBP-1 branch of the UPR and leading
  to HAdV infection boost, as shown in this work; green dotted arrow, possible activations
  downstream of GCA-induced UPR; blue dotted arrows, pathways relating to work previously
  published depicting two signaling branches downstream of IRE-1 that could contribute
  to the enhancement of HAdV infection or cancer cell killing.
