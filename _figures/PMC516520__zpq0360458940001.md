caption: 'Suggested pathways of starch synthesis in source leaves. (A) “Classic model”
  according to which the starch biosynthetic process takes place exclusively in the
  chloroplast, segregated from the sucrose biosynthetic process taking place in the
  cytosol. (B) The alternative model in which both sucrose and starch biosynthetic
  pathways are interconnected by means of the ADPG-synthesizing activity catalyzed
  by SuSy. In A, starch is shown to be the end product of a unidirectional pathway,
  whereas B shows starch as an intermediate component of a cyclic gluconeogenic pathway.
  The enzyme activities that are involved are numbered as follows: 1 and 1′, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
  aldolase; 2 and 2′, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase; 3, PPi:fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase;
  4 and 4′, phosphoglucoisomerase; 5 and 5′, phosphoglucomutase; 6, UGP; 7, SPS; 8,
  sucrose phosphate phosphatase; 9, AGP; 10, SS; 11, SP; 12, SuSy.'
papertitle: Most of ADP·glucose linked to starch biosynthesis occurs outside the chloroplast
  in source leaves.
