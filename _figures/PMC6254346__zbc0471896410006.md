caption: Model for AMOT function in Hippo signaling. A, when F-actin levels are high,
  AMOT is bound to F-actin and interacts poorly with its binding partners. B, when
  F-actin levels are reduced, AMOT becomes phosphorylated by LATS and is free to bind
  YAP, SAV-MST, and LATS. Assembly of this complex allows MST to phosphorylate LATS
  on the HM site. Both AMOT phosphorylation and LATS HM phosphorylation enhance AMOT-LATS
  binding. C, to become fully active, LATS must autophosphorylate on the AL site.
  HM phosphorylation enhances LATS autophosphorylation. In addition, we show that
  both MOB1 and AMOT enhance LATS-AL phosphorylation independent of any effects they
  have on HM phosphorylation. D, the ability of fully active LATS to phosphorylate
  YAP may be enhanced by formation of a LATS–AMOT–YAP complex. Note that the model
  is speculative and its purpose is to illustrate the primary steps involved in AMOT
  activation of Hippo signaling. The Hippo pathway is regulated at many other levels,
  which could be occurring at the same time but are not shown for simplicity. It is
  presently not clear whether complexes exist in cells as pictured, with all components
  simultaneously bound to each other.
