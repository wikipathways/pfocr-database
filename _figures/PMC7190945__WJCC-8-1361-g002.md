caption: 'Effects of VSL#3 on intestinal barrier function. VSL#3 acts on the four
  components of the intestinal barrier: The mechanical barrier, biological barrier,
  chemical barrier, and immune barrier. In terms of the mechanical barrier, VSL#3
  can increase occludin and zonula occludens-1 and decrease claudin-2 in order to
  improve tight junction protein function, and the effect is achieved by increasing
  the activity of T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase, which is able to decrease T-cell
  protein tyrosine phosphatase-dependent interferon-γ signaling and increase transepithelial
  electrical resistance[-]. VSL#3 can increase transepithelial electrical resistance
  by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase p42/44 and p38 pathway[]. In
  terms of the biological barrier, VSL#3 can increase the amount of intestinal commensal
  bacteria and decrease the amount of fungi[]. In terms of the chemical barrier, VSL#3
  can increase MUC2, MUC3 and MUC5AC gene expression to regulate mucus secretion[].
  In terms of the immune barrier, VSL#3 can inhibit the proinflammatory nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) pathway, such as inducing heat shock protein (HSP) and reducing monocyte
  chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). The action mechanism is via the early inhibition
  of proteasome by producing soluble factors[]. VSL#3 also up-regulates the peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) signaling pathway to antagonize the NF-κB
  pathway[]. An appropriate dose of VSL#3 can induce the maturation of dendrite cells
  (DC)[,], and VSL#3 can inhibit interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) in intestinal
  epithelial cells (IEC)[-] and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of
  chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL7, and CCL8) by inhibiting STAT-1 phosphorylation[].
  VSL#3 is also able to decrease interleukin (IL)-12 (p40) production induced by LPS[].
  Moreover, VSL#3 can induce IL-10 produced by DC and decrease the influx of innate
  immune cells (CD11b+) and adaptive immune cells (CD4+/CD8+)[,]. The down-regulation
  of the signaling pathway of Toll-like receptors (TLR) by VSL#3 also has benefits
  for the intestinal immune barrier[]. IEC: Intestinal epithelial cells; ZO-1: Zonula
