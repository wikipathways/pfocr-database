caption: 'PI3K/Akt pathway impairment is a key feature of IR and vascular dysfunction.
  Parallel and balanced insulin signaling between PI3K/Akt/eNOS and Ras/MAPK maintains
  normal vascular tone in healthy conditions. A variety of stimuli, including hyperglycemia,
  elevated FFA levels, cytokines, and others, increase production of ROS, RNS, and
  oxidative stress. These leads to activation of IKKbeta and other stress sensitive
  Ser/Thr kinases, which cause serine phosphorylation of IRS (at amino acid position
  307-a negative regulation) and PI3K/Akt inhibition (IR effect). While PI3K/Akt/eNOS
  signaling is impaired, the Ras/MAPK pathway is less affected or even enhanced due
  to hyperinsulinemia, leading to reduce NO production and enhance ET-1 secretion,
  resulting in impaired vascular function. AMPK counteract the stress induced IR by
  serine phosphorylation of eNOS (a positive regulation) and IRS (at amino acid position
  789-a positive regulation), which improves vascular function and IR. IR: insulin
  resistance, IRS: insulin receptor substrate, PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,
  eNOS: endothelial nitric oxide synthase, NO: nitric oxide, MAPK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, Erk1/2: extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2, ET-1: endothelin-1,
  FFA: free fatty acid, ROS: reactive oxygen species, RNS: reactive nitrogen species,
  TNF-alpha: tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IKKbeta: inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa
  B kinase beta subunit, Ser/Thr: Serine/Threonine, VSMCs: vascular smooth muscle
  cells, AMPK: 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase.'
