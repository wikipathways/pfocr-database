caption: 'Schematic model of TDEVs in regulating the functions of macrophage. TDEVs
  can modulate the cytokine secretion, phagocytosis, and migration of macrophages
  via various signaling pathways. For cytokine secretion (Blue): Palmitoylated proteins
  carried by gastric cancer-derived EVs bind with TLR2 on the surface of macrophages
  to further activate NF-κB signaling, leading to an elevated level of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines including IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and so on. Similarly, miRNAs in EVs secreted
  by lung cancer and breast cancer bind with TLR7/8 to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines
  secretion via the NF-κB pathway. However, HNSCC-derived EVs cargo TGF-β isoform
  inhibits NF-κB signaling to down-regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  For phagocytosis (Green): PtdSer in apoptotic tumor-derived EVs binds with receptors
  such as TIM-4 to promote the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. However,
  lncRNA TUC399 contained in HCC-derived EVs down-regulates the FcγR-mediated phagocytosis.
  For migration (Red): TDEVs from myeloma containing serglycin can augment macrophage
  migration, and SIPA1 in breast cancer-derived EVs induces elevated expression of
  myosin-9 in macrophages, which contributes to migration.'
