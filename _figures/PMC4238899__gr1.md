caption: Organisation and lineage control in the intestine. (a) H&E section of intestine
  showing crypt-to-villus axis. Expanded view of crypt shown alongside a schematic
  showing the location of the different functional zones. (b) Schematic of classical
  view of bHLH transcription factor-driven control of fate choice and differentiation
  in the intestine, and a simplified view of their regulation by Notch signalling.
  However, complex interaction between cells, potential oscillating expression of
  bHLHs, and a clear ability to move back up the hierarchy towards stemness, points
  strongly to a great deal of potential for plasticity, rather than cells following
  a linear pathway as depicted here.
