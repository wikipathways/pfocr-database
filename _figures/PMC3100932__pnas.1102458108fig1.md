caption: The HBP and chemical reporters of O-GlcNAc modification. (A) Glucose, glutamine,
  and acetyl-CoA are transformed by the metabolic enzymes of the HBP to UDP-GlcNAc,
  which can be used by OGT to modify protein substrates and reversed by OGA. Per-O-acetylated
  analogues (Ac4GlcNAz and Ac4GlcNAlk) are deacetylated by intracellular esterases,
  and then enter the GlcNAc salvage pathway. (B) GlcNAz and GlcNAlk bearing proteins
  can be covalently modified with detection tags using CuAAC.
