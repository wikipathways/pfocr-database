caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of p21 and miR-16 through the miR-449a in response
  to DNA damage in NSCLC. DNA double-strand break (DSB) can be caused by the radiomimetic
  chemicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS) or radiation, which triggers autophosphorylation
  of ATM at serine 1981 by initiating its kinase activity []. Downstream phosphorylation
  on the ATM pathway drives the activation of p53 in response to DNA damage. ATM directly
  induces Mdm2 phosphorylation, thereby reducing the activity of Mdm2 and resulting
  in strong induction of p53. Activated p53 induces Mdm2 which inhibits p53 by ubiquitination
  []. Within the model, based on the different phosphorylation events that p53 controls,
  it is described by two variables: p53-A and p53-K. p53-A represents p53 phosphorylated
  at serine 15 and serine 20 that induce p21 expression for the cell cycle arrest
  or senescence, whereas p53-K specifies further phosphorylation at serine 46 that
  modulates Bax and/or PUMA expression for the apoptosis (see [] for more information
  on p53-A/p53-K function). Activated ATM/p53 can induce miR-34a [,] and miR-16 [,]
  expression in DNA damage response. On the other hand, miR-449a induced through the
  DNA damage as suggested by Mao et al. []. HDAC1, lncRNA XIST and C-Myc are well-known
  inhibitors of p21 [,,] and miR-16 [,,]. Interestingly, HDAC1, lncRNA XIST, and C-Myc
  are directly targeted by the miR-449a [,,] and miR-34a [,,]. Consequently, miR-449a
  can regulate p21 expression and miR-16 activity through the suppression of HDAC1,
  lncRNA XIST, and C-Myc. Once p21 expression and/or miR-16 is activated, it can trigger
  senescence and/or apoptosis in NSCLC at the G1/S checkpoint. Arrowhead edge represents
  activation. Whereas, a hammer-head edge represents suppression, respectively. Detailed
  molecular mechanism of DNA damage of the model see our previous publish study []
  and also the latest reviewed article by Huang et al. [].'
