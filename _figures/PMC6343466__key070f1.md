  targets of SpA-related disease, including the skeleton, skin and gut, interact with
  diverse innate immune cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. Although SpA is immunologically
  heterogeneous, there is strong evidence for adaptive immune responses that could
  be due to autoantigens or to other antigens that breech tissue barriers. JAK: Janus
