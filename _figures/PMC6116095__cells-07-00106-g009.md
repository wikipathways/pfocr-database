caption: The unfolded protein response pathway in several yeast species. The accumulation
  of unfolded proteins in the ER leads to the activation of Ire1. In Sc., Kl., Ca.,
  and Cn., Ire1 splices the HAC1/HXL1 pre-mRNA leading to its translation. The synthesised
  bZIP factor (Hac1/Hxl1), regulates transcription of UPR-responsive genes. In Sp.,
  and Cg., Ire1 cleaves ER-localised mRNAs through the Regulated Ire-Dependent Decay
  (RIDD) pathway. In Sp., Ire1 also cleaves the BiP mRNA in the 3′ UTR region leading
  to its stabilization and translation. As described in the text, the unspliced HAC1
  RNA of Cg may induce transcription of UPR-responsive genes in S. cerevisiae (depicted
  by the dotted arrows), although there is no evidence that this process can actually
  occur in C. glabrata.
