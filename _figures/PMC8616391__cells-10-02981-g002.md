caption: 'Molecular interactions involved in the induction and regulation of ferroptosis.
  Decisive characteristics of ferroptosis resulting from phospholipid peroxidation
  (LOOH) are: (1) its dependence on iron, under the Fenton reaction (Fe2+ + H2O2 →
  Fe3+ + OH + OH−), which can be caused by: (i) the increased expression of key players
  for iron uptake, including iron-binding transferrin receptors (TfR1/TFRC), or even
  DMT1 or STEAP3 that directly bind iron; (ii) the degradation of ferritin (FTH/FTL
  complex), which is the iron-storage protein, involving ferritinophagy, an NCOA4-dependent
  autophagic process to release iron in the lysosome; (iii) lysosomal iron sequestration,
  as induced by Sal./AM5; and iv) the hepcidin-mediated inhibition of ferroportin
  expression, which is involved by the export of iron and thus promotes iron retention.
  (2) Disturbances in the GSH/GPX4 axis that ensures the redox balance; or in the
  same order, disturbances in the level of CoQ10 (a byproduct of the mevalonate pathway)
  with its FSP-1 reductase that were recently found to prevent the peroxidation of
  membrane lipids. ACSL4 and LPCAT3, which are involved in the esterification of PUFA
  in membrane phospholipids (PL-PUFA), are key actors in sensitivity to ferroptosis.
  NRF2, the master antioxidant regulator, is also able to prevent ferroptosis by activating
  the expression of a large number of genes encoding ferroptosis inhibitors including
  NQO1, HMOX1, FTH, GPX4, system Xc−/SLC7A11, the GCL/GSS enzymes involved in the
  GSH synthesis, and lastly MT1 G. Arrowhead or stop lines indicate promotion/activation
  or inhibition, respectively.'
