caption: Nutrient taste receptors signaling in enteroendrocrine cells. The detection
  of sugars molecules is mediated by TAS1R2–TAS1R3, umami sensing is achieved by TAS1R1–TAS1R3
  and bitter detection is mediated by the TAS2R family. When nutrients bind their
  receptors, the signaling pathway is activated, causing an increase of intracellular
  calcium that ultimately induces the release of hormones involved in the process
  of satiety and metabolic homeostasis []. Obesity seems to deregulate this pathway
  but the precise mechanism is still unknown []. TAS1, taste 1 receptor family; TAS2,
  taste 2 receptor family; GNAI1, guanine nucleotide-binding protein G; PLβ2, phosphatidylinositol
  phospholipase C; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; Ca2+, calcium 2+.
