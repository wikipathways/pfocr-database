caption: Multiple proferroptotic and antiferroptotic signals emanate from core cell
  cycle regulators. We provide evidence that p53 regulates ferroptosis independently
  of p21. E2F1 functions via p21-dependent and p21-independent mechanisms to suppress
  ferroptosis. Nutlin-3a inhibits ferroptosis in a p53-independent manner. Both CDKs
  and RB family modulate ferroptosis. It is possible that CDKs generate phosphorylated
  RB species to modulate ferroptosis. The classical cell cycle pathway linking these
  proteins is not shown but includes induction of p21 by p53, inhibition of CDKs by
  p21, phosphorylation of RB by CDKs, and release of E2F1. All of these regulatory
  linkages are expected to influence the ultimate ferroptotic outcome. CDKs, cyclin-dependent
  kinases; RB, retinoblastoma.
