caption: 'A model of abrin (ABR)-triggered apoptosis. ABR-induced apoptosis may occur
  through at least 3 pathways: first, inhibition of protein synthesis by its N-glycosidase
  activity; second, modulation of the function of mitochondria by specific interaction
  with antioxidant protein-1 (AOP-1); and third, interference with the transcription
  regulated by prohibitin (PHB). Repression of prohibitin attenuates ABR-triggered
  apoptosis via preventing the expression of BAX, cleaved-caspase 3, and cleaved-poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerase (PARP). Once PHB is upregulated by ABR through the JNK/SAPK signaling
  pathway, the expression of proapoptotic gene Bax is turned on through the nuclear
  translocation and p53 interaction of PHB, by which activates the caspase cascade,
  and finally, apoptosis occurs.'
