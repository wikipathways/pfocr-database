  model proposed by Mabel and Lowell Hokin in 1964. © Michell and BBA, 1975. Originally
  published in Biochim Biophys Acta, 415 (1975) 81-147.(B) An advanced version of
  the PI cycle model proposed by Robert Michell in 1975. The ideas that the PI cycle
  is an inter-organelle pathway and that cytosolic exchange proteins mediate PI/PA
  shuttling between the ER and the PM were incorporated into this model. © Michell

  The first model of SOCE proposed by James Putney in 1986. Ag, agonist; RA, receptor;
  PIP2, PI(4,5)P2; (1,4,5)IP3, IP3; RI, IP3R. © Putney and Cell Calcium, 1986. Originally
  published in Cell Calcium, 7 (1986) 1-12.(D) A revised model of SOCE proposed by
  James Putney in 1990. The dashed arrow indicates an unknown mechanism that links
  ER Ca2+ depletion to the opening of a Ca2+ channel at the PM. Ca2+ first enters
  the cytosol and is then pumped into the ER lumen to refill the ER Ca2+ store. R,
  receptor; GP; G-protein. © Putney and Cell Calcium, 1990. Originally published in
  Cell Calcium, 11 (1990) 611-624.
