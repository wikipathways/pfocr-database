caption: 'The left-right asymmetry pathway. (a) An 8.25-day mouse embryo showing asymmetric
  Nodal expression (in blue) at the node as well as in the left, but not the right,
  lateral plate, and asymmetric Cerl2 expression in purple. (b) A higher magnification
  of the node. The central pit of the node contains motile cilia (not shown) that
  drive a leftwards nodal flow (indicated by arrows). Surrounding the node are the
  node crown cells; these express Nodal (represented by blue dots) in an asymmetric
  fashion, with expression stronger on the left than on the right. An asymmetric calcium
  signal (represented by red stars) is also stronger on the left than the right. Downstream
  of nodal flow and asymmetric gene expression at the node, a ''leftness'' signal
  is communicated several cell diameters to the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM).
  Here it activates the Nodal signaling cascade, ultimately resulting in left-side-specific
  Pitx2 expression and asymmetric morphogenesis. The primary axes are shown: anterior-posterior
  (A-P); dorsal-ventral (D-V); left-right (L-R).'
