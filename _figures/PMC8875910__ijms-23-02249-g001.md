caption: 'Pattern recognition receptors on mast cells and signal transduction pathways.
  Plasma membrane of the mast cell is a platform for pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs), such as myeloid C-type lectin receptor (Dectin), Toll-like receptor (TLR),
  and macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle). Mincle/Dectin 3 (family member
  3), Dectin 2/3, Dectin-1, and TLR: 4/2, 4, 2/1, 2/6, 5, 3 were identified respectively
  as receptors for: alpha-mannose, alpha-mannan, beta-glucan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS);
  triacyl-, diacyl-lipopeptide, flagellin, and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In a stressed
  mast cell (e.g., viral, bacterial, and fungal infections), activation of PRRs triggers
  the cell signaling, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  degranulation. Mincle/Dectin3- and 2/3-dependent signaling activates tyrosine protein
  kinase Syk (known as spleen tyrosine kinase Syk) associated with protein kinase
  C (PKC) recruitment, resulting in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production
  and involvement of the following: c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (p38). Dectin 1 triggers the activity of a low-molecular-weight GDP/GTP-binding
  guanine triphosphatase (Ras); this, in turn, promotes a cascade of events leading
  to activation of proto-oncogene serine/threonine-kinase isoform Raf 1. Stimulation
  of the cell-surface receptors leads to activation of kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  nuclear factor of activated B cells (NF-kappa B) and rapid changes in gene expression.
  Intracellular signaling pathway involves tyrosine-protein kinase Lyn (Lyn) undergoing
  phosphorylation/activation and triggering a cascade of signaling events mediated
  by activation of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phospholipase C (PLC) that results
  in the generation of second messengers: diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate
  (IP3), as well as in Ca2+ mobilization. DAG interacts with PKC, hence activating
  its influence on transcription and cytokine generation. Moreover, activation of
  NF-kappa B occurs through the intracellular docking proteins: myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88) and Toll/Interleukin-1 (TIR)-containing adaptor inducing interferon-beta
  (TRIF). Thus, the signal is transduced through: MyD88, TIR-containing adaptor protein
  (TIRAP), and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM).'
