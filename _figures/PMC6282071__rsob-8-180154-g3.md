caption: Increased P2X4R expression after nerve injury via the actions of fibronectin
  in activated microglia. Fibronectin increases after nerve injury and binds to α5β1
  integrin on microglial cells, resulting in the activation of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3 K)-Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase-extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (MEK-ERK) signalling cascades through the action of the
  tyrosine kinase Lyn. Signalling through the PI3 K-Akt pathway induces the degradation
  of p53 via MDM2 and enhances P2X4R gene expression. Activated MEK-ERK signalling
  enhances eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) phosphorylation via
  activated MAPK-interacting protein kinase-1 (MNK1), which may lead to the enhancement
  of P2X4R translation. Thus, fibronectin enhances the expression of functional P2X4Rs
  (centre of this figure). The subcellular localization of P2X4R is restricted to
  lysosomes and is translocated into the cell membrane by stimulation. Fibronectin
  increases the release of CCL2 from activated microglia, and CCL2 stimulates the
  CC-chemokine receptor CCR2, resulting in the stimulation of P2X4R trafficking to
  the cell surface from lysosomes of microglia (upper side of the figure). Interferon
  8 (IRF8) expression is markedly enhanced in microglia after PNI. IRF8 binds directly
  to the promoter loci of IRF5 and activates IRF5 transcription, increasing IRF5.
  Fibronectin stimulates IRF5 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. IRF5
  induces de novo expression of P2X4R by binding directly to the promoter region of
  the p2rx4 gene.
