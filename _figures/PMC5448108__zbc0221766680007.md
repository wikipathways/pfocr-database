caption: A proposed model for the regulation and function of two Grp78 genes in JH-stimulated
  locust vitellogenesis. Grp78-1 is regulated by the JH-Met-Mcm4/7 pathway, whereas
  Grp78-2 is directly activated by the JH-receptor complex. The large amount of Grp78
  in the ER facilitates the folding of massively synthesized Vg and other proteins
  and maintains cell homeostasis. Loss of Grp78 function induces ER stress, which
  activates the Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD) of mRNA and Perk-eIF2α pathway. RIDD results
  in the degradation of Vg mRNA. The activated eIF2α inhibits protein translation,
  leading to reduced synthesis of Vg and other regulatory proteins that directly or
  indirectly regulate Vg synthesis. Consequently, Vg in the fat body and ovary are
  substantially reduced, and the oocyte maturation and egg production are blocked.
