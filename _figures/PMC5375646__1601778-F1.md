caption: Vertebrate estradiol synthesis from cholesterol is a multistep pathway involving
  side-chain cleavage of cholesterol to pregnenolone by the CYP11A enzyme (red), a
  complex suite of reactions from pregnenolone to testosterone (dotted arrow), and
  aromatization by the CYP19A enzyme (blue). CYP19A is already present in chordates
  (blue dot on tree), whereas CYP11A is vertebrate-specific (red dot on tree). Aromatization
  has been described in cnidarians, mollusks, and cephalochordates (blue ovals). In
  cephalochordates, CYP19A may catalyze the aromatization reaction, whereas in mollusks
  and cnidarians, this definitely has to be a different enzyme, possibly a paralogous
  CYP (blue dots on mollusk and cnidarian branches of the tree). Because there is
  no consistent evidence for side-chain cleavage activities in those organisms, the
  exact endogenous substrate of those aromatizing enzymes remains elusive. It could
  be a steroid (hence the dotted line from cholesterol) but different from the vertebrate
  ones (hence the incomplete molecule structures).
