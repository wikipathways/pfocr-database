caption: (a) A representation of a metabolic pathway as depicted in textbooks. (b)
  A representation using bipartite graphs. Examples of substrate–product networks
  based on chemical equations (c), based on chemical equations in which ubiquitous
  metabolites such as ATP and ADP are removed (d), and based on atomic traces (e).
  The solid and dashed lines represent the traces based on carbon and phosphorus atoms,
  respectively.
