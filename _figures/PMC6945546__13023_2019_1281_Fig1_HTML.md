caption: Mutated genes in HHT encode members of the BMP9/BMP10 signaling pathway.
  The cartoon depicts the BMP9/BMP10 signaling pathway in endothelial cells. After
  ligand binding to cell surface receptors, signal transduction proceeds through phosphorylation
  of the type 1 receptor ALK1, phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/9, translocation of the
  Smad complex to the nucleus and transcriptional effects on target genes, as indicated
  by blue arrows. The left part of the Figure lists the names of the genes that are
  mutated in HHT patients and the arrows point to their gene products. The frequency
  of the mutations is indicated in % between the parentheses
