caption: Components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. The canonical Wnt pathway
  is primarily dependent on the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. In the Wnt
  OFF state, the Wnt destruction complex is actively engaged in the phosphorylation
  and subsequent ubiquitination mediated degradation of β-catenin. This is achieved
  by sequestering β-catenin to the Wnt destruction complex, consisting of APC, AXIN
  (scaffold proteins), GSK3β, and CK1α (kinases). Upon phosphorylation by the kinases,
  β-catenin is ubiquitinated by βTrCP which is recruited to the destruction complex
  by YAP/TAZ. The DNA binding partner of β-catenin, TCF/LEF, is bound to the DNA in
  a repressive complex with Groucho/TLE. Wnt signaling is activated upon binding of
  Wnt ligand causing complex formation between LRP6 and frizzled which allows Disheveled
  to bind to LRP. This activated form of Disheveled is able to bind and recruit the
  Wnt destruction complex thereby disrupting the binding of βTrCP. The receptor bound
  Wnt destruction complex is ubiquitination incompetent, hence β-catenin can’t be
  targeted for proteasomal degradation, therefore leading to saturation of the destruction
  complex with phospho-β-catenin. The new pool of β-catenin is free to translocate
  into the nucleus and activate the transcription of Wnt responsive genes by binding
  the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors. In the same process, YAP/TAZ is unable
  to recruit β-TrCP to the destruction complex and escape degradation. YAP/TAZ translocates
  into the nucleus as well and binds to the TEAD family of transcription factors.
