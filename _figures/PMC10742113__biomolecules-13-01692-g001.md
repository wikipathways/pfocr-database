caption: Comparative signaling pathways mediated by adiponectin, leptin and resistin.
  Adiponectin, leptin, and resistin bind to their receptors AdipoR1/2, LepR, and CAP-1,
  respectively. Resistin also binds to TLR4. AdipoR1/2 recruits APPL1 and activates
  p38MAPK, AMPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, increasing (↑) glucose uptake and adipogenesis.
  Simultaneously, adiponectin decreases (↓) pro-inflammatory response and promotes
  vasoprotection (orange). The engagement of leptin with LepR leads to JAK2 activation,
  initiating STAT3 dimerization. JAK2/STAT3 induction correlates with SOCS3 production,
  which, in turn, mediates a negative feedback on JAK2/STAT3 signaling. Similar to
  AdipoR1/2, LepR can induce AMPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. In contrast to adiponectin,
  leptin causes a pro-inflammatory response along with oxidative stress. Moreover,
  leptin contributes to insulin resistance by stimulating JNK activity (green). Under
  resistin action, CAP-1 induces the production of cAMP by the adenylyl cyclase (AC)
  that activates PKA. Interconnected PKA/TLR4 signaling pathways converge to recruit
  NF-κB, leading to inflammation and insulin resistance (yellow)
