caption: 'Metabolite-dependent mechanisms that influence muscle fiber composition.
  (A) The mTORC1 signal transduction pathway is controlled by amino acid-, growth
  factor- and energy-dependent signaling mechanisms. Amino acid-dependent signaling
  through Sestrin, CASTOR, and SAMTOR, repress GATOR2-dependent inhibition of GATOR1
  GAP activity toward Rag GTP-binding proteins. Growth factor signaling through the
  phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K): AKT pathway inhibits the GAP activity of the
  tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) toward Rheb. These pathways lead to the stimulation
  of mTORC1 activity. Cellular energy status controls mTORC1 through a regulatory
  loop between the growth factor signaling pathway and the sensor of AMP called AMPK.
  Downstream targets of mTORC1 control protein translation and metabolic pathways
  that provide the substrates required for growth. (B) Ligand activation of nuclear
  hormone receptors (NHRs), including PPARδ and TRα, and form a heterodimer with retinoic
  acid receptor (RXR) that recruits coactivator proteins to the nuclear hormone response
  elements (NHRE) of the promoters of genes involved in mitochondrial gene expression
  and skeletal muscle fiber-type switching.'
