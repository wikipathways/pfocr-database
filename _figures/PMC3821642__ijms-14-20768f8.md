caption: A simplified summary of the signaling involved in response to TPA and leading
  to the process of EMT on HepG2 cells. This study highlights the formation of a complex
  network governed by ERK1/2 signaling pathway, converging on the coregulation of
  Snail and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and responsible for the onset and the progression
  of EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
