caption: 'Schematic representation of cDC1 DC development. In the bone marrow, HSC
  gives rise to the LMPP, which settles at the apex of all myeloid and lymphoid lineages
  and is separated from the MkE. GMDP derives from the LMPP and produces the MDP (expressing
  M-CSFR), which further differentiates into the CDP, capable of generating the main
  DC subsets: pDCs, cDC1 and cDC2. pDCs terminally differentiate in the bone marrow,
  whereas pre-cDC migrate through the blood to lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues,
  where they produce cDC1 and cDC2 subsets. Determining the differentiation pathway,
  Notch-dependent interactions of CDPs with stromal cells, in cooperation with GM-CSF,
  are crucial for the commitment to the cDC1 lineage, separating their pathway from
  pDCs. In peripheral tissues, the differentiation into CD141+ cDC1 is controlled
  by transcription factors, such as IRF8, Batf3 and Id2 (shown in blue). After engagement
  with the CD141+pathway, the existence of a two-staged differentiation process of
  cDC1 populations is proposed, in which XCR1-negative cDC1s under the influence of
  GM-CSF (shown in red) acquire the expression of XCR1, representing the shift between
  a pre-cross-presentation phase and a subsequential cross-presenting stage. cDC,
