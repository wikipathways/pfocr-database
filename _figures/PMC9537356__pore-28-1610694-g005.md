caption: Schematic presentation of cardiotixicity pathway of HER-2 inhibitors. Cardiomyocytes
  express HER-2/EGFR4 aspecially in hypoxic condition as well as neuregulin-1 (NRG1).
  In adult differentiated cardiocytes the RAS-RAF-MEK mitotic arm of this signaling
  pathway does not operational. Upon HER-2 inhibition PI3K/AKT/mTOR arm of the signaling
  pathway is blocked which activate mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Furthermore,
  since the SRC/FAK/MLCK arm of this signaling pathway is also blocked, regeneration
  of the actomyosin complex is also inhibited. CSK, cytoskeleton.
