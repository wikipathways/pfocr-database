caption: Schematic of mechanisms for the activation of PDE5A-cGMP-PKG signaling and
  the promotion of glycolysis by MSTN. MSTN activate the pathway via combining with
  ActRIIB, which then binds to the type I receptor to form a receptor complex. After
  the receptor complex is activated by the signal, SMAD2/SMAD3 is activated via phosphorylation.
  Then, SMAD2/SMAD3 will detach from receptor complex and bind to SMAD4. Then, the
  heteromeric complex enters the nucleus, binds to the promoter region, and alters
  transcription of PDE5A gene. The left one is the wild-type cattle and the right
  one is the MSTN mutant cattle. The MSTN mutant decreased SMAD2/3 expression, which
  led to transcription downregulation of PDE5A and thereby promoted the cGMP/PKG pathway,
  increased the phosphorylation level of PFK, and subsequently enhanced glycolysis.
  The red arrow indicates upregulation and the green arrow indicates downregulation.
