caption: Free fatty acids (FFAs) induce hepatocyte apoptosis. FFAs can modulate both
  the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of hepatocyte apoptosis. The saturated
  fatty acids, palmitic acid and stearic acid, lead to c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
  dependent activation of the proapoptotic protein Bax, which then leads to mitochondrial
  permeabilization with release of cytochrome c, activation of effector caspases,
  and apoptosis. Palmitic acid can also activate the lysosomal pathway of apoptosis,
  via Bax activation and Bax-dependent lysosomal permeabilization. Furthermore, palmitic
  acid and stearic acid activate protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) leading to activation
  of FoxO3a, and transcriptional activation of the proapoptotic protein Bim. The monounsaturated
  fatty acid, oleic acid, which is minimally toxic per se, imparts sensitivity to
  the death receptor mediated extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Fas and TRAIL-R2 expression
  is induced by oleic acid treatment. TRAIL-R2 expression is under the transcriptional
  control of JNK in oleic acid treated cells. This sensitizes fatty hepatocytes to
  circulating Fas or TRAIL.
