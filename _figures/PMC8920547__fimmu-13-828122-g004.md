caption: The hypothesis of pathophysiology in IgG4-RD. Naïve/memory B cells and/or
  dendritic cells would present antigen from possible triggers to CD4 positive T cells.
  The cycle of collaboration would be established between autoreactive T cells and
  B cells. The activated CD4 positive Th2 and regulatory T cells would produce inflammatory
  cytokines, resulting in activation of fibroblasts and inflammatory macrophages.
  Complement system, at least classical pathway, is possibly related to the differentiation
  to Treg from CD4 positive T cells through C5aR2. Treg may be associated with the
  production of sIL-2R. C, complement; CD4, cluster of differentiation 4; C5aR2; C5a
