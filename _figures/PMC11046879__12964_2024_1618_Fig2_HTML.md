caption: 'Illustrates the functions of PTEN in the cytoplasm and nucleus. A: Persistent
  activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and subsequent mTOR activation upon
  PTEN loss. This cascade, initiated by the phosphorylation of downstream effector
  proteins, contributes to processes such as protein and nucleotide synthesis. B:
  PTEN interacts with MVP in the nucleus in a Ca + dependent way and has a significant
  function in preserving genome stability while interacting with various proteins'
