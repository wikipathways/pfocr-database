caption: Binding of CTLA4Ig to CD80/CD86 expressed on an antigen presenting cell can
  prevent naïve T cell activation by preventing CD28 mediated costimulation (left
  panel). In addition, CTLA4Ig can suppress the proliferation of activated effector
  T cells (Teff) through a TGFβ and Treg dependent mechanism that is independent of
  CD28-costimulation (right panel). This pathway requires and is synergistic with
  macrophage derived NO.
