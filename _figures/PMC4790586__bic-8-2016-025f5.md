caption: Signaling cascades through Twist and their roles in carcinogenesis. The bHLH
  TF Twist1 induces EMT and escape to oncogenic hyperproliferation-induced fail-safe
  program, facilitating the intravasation of cancer cells in the systemic circulation
  and their dissemination to distant organs. It is overexpressed in a variety of cancers,
  including breast, lung, prostate, and gastric carcinomas. The nuclear protein Twist
  is activated by a variety of signal transduction pathways, including N-Myc, NF-κB,
  HIF1α, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), Ras, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, Akt,,, and Wnt signaling. Activated Twist, in turn, upregulates
  N-cadherin, fibronectin, and vimentin and downregulates E-cadherin and α/γ catenin,
  which are the hallmarks of EMT. EMT programs are orchestrated by a set of pleiotropically
  acting TFs—including Twist, Slug, Snail, ZEB1, ZEB2, FOXC2, and others—which organize
  entrance into a mesenchymal state by suppressing the expression of epithelial markers
  and inducing expression of other markers associated with the mesenchymal state.
  Twist plays an important role in some other physiological processes involved in
  metastasis, such as angiogenesis, invadopodia, extravasation, and chromosomal instability
  by activating matrix metalloproteinases, and inhibits tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases.
  Twist also protects cancer cells from apoptotic cell death through inactivation
  of the ARF-p53 pathway. In addition, Twist increases BC stem cells by transcriptional
  repression of CD24 to increase CD44-high and CD24-low cell population and confers
  chemotherapy resistance.
