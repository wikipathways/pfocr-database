caption: 'Model of platelet interactions with Staphylococcus aureus. Based upon recent
  evidence, the model illustrates how platelets may sense and respond via parallel
  pathways that promote anti-staphylococcal host defense. a On the cellular level,
  interactions with S. aureus evoke: (1) platelet activation via specific receptors;
  (2) liberation and processing of PMPs and PKs which exert direct microbicidal effects,
  and (3) secretion of adenosine nucleotides (ADP/ATP) triggering a recursive cascade
  for activation of adjacent platelets. Note that inhibitors of the purinergic pathway
  of activation preclude anti-staphylococcal responses. b On the molecular level,
  specific sense and response pathway components are illustrated. Purinergic agonists
  such as ADP are known stimulants of strong platelet activation. Thus, degradation
  of extracellular ADP by apyrase (APY) or the inhibition of P2X or P2Y12 adenosine
  nucleotide receptors by suramin (SUR; general P2 inhibitor), pyridoxal-5′-phosphonucleotide
  derivative (PND; high-affinity P2X1 inhibitor), or cangrelor (CNG; high-affinity
  P2Y12 inhibitor) specifically prevents platelet (PLT) sense and response activation
  for staphylocidal efficacy. In contrast, antagonism of the P2Y1, phospholipase C
  (PLC), thromboxane A2 (TXA2), or cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways, or inhibition of
  the CD41, CD42b, or CD62P platelet adhesin receptors do not impede the sense and
  response activation of platelets versus S. aureus. Thus, the antistaphylococcal
  efficacy of platelets involves a self-amplifying, recursive sense and response mechanism:
  (1) direct or indirect interactions of platelets and S. aureus (SA); (2) platelet
  activation, via autocrine or intercrine P2X1 or P2Y12 receptor-mediated signal transduction
  prompting granule mobilization; (3) degranulation and liberation of ADP/ATP from
  δ-granules; (4) deployment of direct antimicrobial effector molecules (PMPs and
  PKs) from α-granules; and (5) adenosine nucleotide-mediated activation of adjacent
  platelets, with the ensuing amplification of antimicrobial responses. Such interactions
  are likely influenced by platelet-to-S. aureus ratios. In this respect, staphylocidal
  efficacy appears to involve a threshold platelet ratio to generate and sustain an
  intercrine platelet cascade required to achieve PMP/PK concentrations for staphylocidal
  efficacy. Adapted from []'
