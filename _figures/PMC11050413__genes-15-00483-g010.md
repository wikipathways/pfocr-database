caption: The mechanistic map illustrates the role of NDUFA6-DT as a sponge for miR-455-3p
  in gliomas, disrupting its ability to suppress YWHAH/YWHAG expression. This influences
  the regulation of the PI3K-AKT and HIPPO signaling pathways and the cell cycle,
  subsequently affecting tumor cell survival and apoptosis. Reduced NDUFA6-DT expression
  in disease states correlates with elevated tumor cell survival and apoptosis
