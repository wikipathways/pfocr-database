caption: Model for the role of FtsN–FtsA interaction in the recruitment of the late-divisome
  proteins. FtsA links the PG synthesis machinery with the Z-ring through FtsEX or
  FtsN. This figure is adapted from a previous published model (). For simplicity,
  only some of the core division proteins are represented (Z represents FtsZ, and
  so forth). The black arrows symbolize the recruitment pathway and the green arrows
  indicate the activation of septal PG synthesis. The hierarchical dependencies of
  the recruitment of proteins or protein subcomplexes into the divisome are based
  on previous studies (see text). In the first step, ZipA (not depicted here) and
  FtsEX promote and stabilize FtsA monomers to expose the IC domain (not involved
  in self-interaction anymore) to interact with the late-division proteins (, , ,
  ). FtsN’s cytoplasmic (FtsNcyto) and essential (FtsNE) domains are colored red and
  yellow, respectively, and FtsNS represents the SPOR domain. (A) Divisome assembly
  in ΔftsEX. In all conditions that suppress the ΔftsEX deletion [which disrupts (red
  cross) the “normal” hierarchical recruitment pathway], the interaction between FtsA
  and FtsNcyto (red arrow) becomes essential. This interaction and the periplasmic
  interactions involving FtsNE back-recruit the late cell-division proteins to form
  a functional divisome and activate septal PG synthesis. (B) Suppression of ΔftsN
  requires overexpression of MalG–FtsN. When ftsN is deleted and complemented by MalG–FtsN,
  the recruitment of the divisome proteins follows the classic hierarchical pathway,
  which depends upon FtsEX. FtsNE activates septal PG synthesis (unless FtsQLB complex
  is already activated by a mutation in ftsB or ftsL). The loss of FtsN–FtsA interaction
  (red cross) leads to a less-efficient septal localization of the FtsNE domain which
  is compensated for by the overexpression of MalG–FtsN (double black arrows). (C)
  MalG–FtsN cannot rescue ΔftsEX ΔftsN. In the absence of both the FtsN–FtsA interaction
  and FtsEX the late cell-division proteins are not recruited to the Z-ring, so the
  divisome cannot mature and no septal PG synthesis occurs.
