caption: 'Piezo1 crosstalks with multiple signaling pathways to regulate tumor metastasis:
  (1) Extracellular matrix signal transduction: there is a positive feedback pathway
  between Piezo1 and matrix hardness, and also its activity is affected by environmental
  pH; (2) Integrin-mediated pathways: such as Integrin-Adhesion Spot, Classical Smad2/3
  Pathway, and Non-Smad2/3 pathway; (3) Cytoskeletal-related pathways: Causing changes
  in a series of actin skeleton-related effectors such as ERM, ROCK, and Rac1; (4)
  Hippo pathways: the LATS1/2-YAP axis and the Piezo1-Src-YAP axis; and (5) Ca2+-mediated
  pathways: elevated concentrations of Ca2+ caused upregulation of HIF-α and VEGF.
