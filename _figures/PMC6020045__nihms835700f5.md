caption: The contribution of B cells to the development of chronic GVHD has been recently
  underscored in several experimental systems. One pathway emphasizes interactions
  between donor-derived T cells and B cells in secondary lymphoid tissues, including
  the spleen peripheral lymph nodes. The generation of allo-/auto-reactive B cells
  and the dysregulated production of allo-/auto-antibodies initiates a cascade of
  events that involves activation of monocytes and macrophages along with endothelial
  and epithelial injury. The release of soluble factors including TGFβ and fibroblast
  stimulation characteristic of aberrant tissue repair results in collagen and matrix
  production and deposition culminating in target organ fibrosis and dysfunction.
