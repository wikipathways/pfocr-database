caption: Agonists, such as ACh, stimulate airway contraction by binding to their specific
  G-protein-coupled membrane receptors (e.g. m3AChR) in the plasma membrane (PM) to
  stimulate the dissociation of the G-protein α-sub-unit (Gqα). Gqα activates phospholipase
  C-β (PLCβ) to synthesize inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (InsP3) which, in turn, activates
  InsP3 receptors (InsP3R) to release Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The
  resulting high [Ca2+]i inactivates the InsP3R and the Ca2+ is pumped back into the
  SR by the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) resulting in a
  decrease in [Ca2+]i and re-activation of InsP3R. The cyclic Ca2+ release and Ca2+
  re-uptake into the SR result in cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations. Ca2+ entry through
  store operated Ca2+ channels (SOC) is necessary to replenish the SR Ca2+ store.
  Cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations activate (via calmodulin) myosin light chain kinase
  (MLCK) to phosphorylate regulatory myosin light chain (rMLC) and initiate SMC contraction.
  The simultaneous inactivation of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) by agonists,
  i.e. via G13α/RhoA/Rho-Kinase (ROK), enhances rMLC phosphorylation and SMC contraction.
  Exogenous H2S (generated from either Na2S or GYY-4137) diffuses through the PM and
  enters the SMC. Synthesis of endogenous H2S is catalysed by cystathionine γ-lyase
  (CSE) which can be inhibited by dl-propargylglycine (PPG) or β-cyanoalanine (BCA).
  H2S diffuses and enters the SR lumen where it deprotonates to form its Lewis base,
  hydrogen sulphide anion (HS−), which acts as nucleophile to reduce a disulphide
  bond and form a persulphide in a luminal domain of the InsP3R, decreasing its activity.
  Inhibition of the InsP3R leads to a decrease in Ca2+ release from the SR and decreases
  in the frequency and amplitude of the Ca2+ oscillations, and therefore in deactivation
  of MLCK, decrease in rMLC phosphorylation, and smooth muscle relaxation. Decreases
  in H2S concentration (e.g. decrease in H2S synthesis), reverse the InsP3R persulphidation
  to increase its activity, as well as the frequency and amplitude of the Ca2+ oscillations
  which stimulates rMLC phosphorylation and airway recontraction.
