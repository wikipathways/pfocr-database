caption: Metabolic pathways associated with cancer. Pathways involved in central carbon
  metabolism are presented. Metabolic enzymes that are often upregulated in cancer
  and serve as potential therapeutic targets are shown in purple. These metabolic
  pathways are involved in the synthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and
  redox homeostasis, needed for cell proliferation (shown in red boxes). 2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate;
  3PG, 3-phoshoglycerate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase

  fructose- 6-phosphate; FASN, fatty acid synthase; FH, fumarase; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;

  transporter type; HK2, hexokinase 2; I, complex I; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase;
