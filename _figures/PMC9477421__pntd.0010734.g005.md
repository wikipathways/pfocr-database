figtitle: Schematic diagram summarising the inferred functions of cofilin 1 (CFL1)
  and fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) that interact with a prokaryotically-expressed
  (non-glycosylated) recombinant form of the Toxocara canis mucin 1 protein (rTc-MUC-1)

- Toxocara canis

caption: FABP5 and CFL1 physically interact with rTc-MUC-1, and are inferred to positively
  regulate cellular processes. FABP5 transports fatty acid ligands to activate peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which then regulate the transcription of
  genes coding for malic enzyme 1 (ME1) and for ubiquitin C (UBC), participating in
  adipocytokine signalling pathway associated lipogenesis and ubiquitination, respectively.
  CFL interacts with actin gamma 1 (ACTG1), cyclase associated actin cytoskeleton
  regulatory protein 1 (CAP1), coronin actin binding protein 1A (CORO1A), heat shock
  protein 90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1), lymphocyte cytosolic protein
  1 (LCP1), ubiquitin-like modifier (NEDD8), PFN1, Ras homologue family member C (RHOC)
  and 14-3-3 protein zeta (YWHAZ), to positively regulate ME1-associated signal transduction
  in the adipocytokine signalling pathway.
