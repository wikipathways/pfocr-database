caption: NIK stabilization as a mechanism of non-canonical NF-κB signaling. (A) Under
  normal conditions, NIK is bound by TRAF3 and recruited to the cIAP1/2 ubiquitin
  ligase via TRAF3 dimerization with TRAF2. The T3-T2-cIAP E3 complex mediates constant
  ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NIK, thus preventing non-canonical
  NF-κB activation. (B) In response to receptor crosslinking, TRAFs and cIAP1/2 are
  recruited to the receptor, where cIAP1/2 ubiquitinates TRAF2 and TRAF3 and stimulates
  their degradation. ZFP91 mediates K63 ubiquitination of NIK, which may promote stability
  and catalytic activity of NIK. (C) Accumulated NIK activates IKKα, which in turn
  phosphorylates p100, leading to p100 processing. IKKα also phosphorylates NIK to
  promote NIK degradation, a feedback mechanism that may control the magnitude of
  NIK activation.

  description: NIK stabilization as a mechanism of non-canonical NF-κB signaling.
    (A) Under normal conditions, NIK is bound by TRAF3 and recruited to the cIAP1/2
    ubiquitin ligase via TRAF3 dimerization with TRAF2. The T3-T2-cIAP E3 complex
    mediates constant ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NIK, thus preventing

    and cIAP1/2 are recruited to the receptor, where cIAP1/2 ubiquitinates TRAF2 and
    TRAF3 and stimulates their degradation. ZFP91 mediates K63 ubiquitination of NIK,
    which may promote stability and catalytic activity of NIK. (C) Accumulated NIK
    activates IKKα, which in turn phosphorylates p100, leading to p100 processing.
    IKKα also phosphorylates NIK to promote NIK degradation, a feedback mechanism
    that may control the magnitude of NIK activation.
