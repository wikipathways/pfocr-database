caption: Inflammatory cascade initiated by cardiomyocytes in pressure overload (TAC)
  induced injury - the role of the cardiomyocyte as a major initiator of inflammation
  may be of paramount importance in the development of heart failure. During the acute
  phase (1–3 days post-TAC), cardiomyocytes express cytokines such as MCP1 and CXCL1
  in response to CaMKII-mediated NFkB activation. Likewise, the presence of cytosolic
  DNA may activate the cGAS/STING pathway to induce type I interferon expression [].
  Cardiomyocyte-generated chemokines and other cytokines may be released into the
  circulation to mediate, feedback in a juxtacrine or autocrine manner, recruitment
  of monocytes and neutrophils, and locally activate tissue resident macrophages and
  endothelial cells []. Bajpai et al. demonstrated that distinct subsets of tissue-resident
  cardiac macrophages are crucial in the extravasation of bone-marrow derived neutrophils
  and monocytes after injury [,]. At approximately seven days post-TAC, cardiomyocyte-specific
  inflammatory processes mediate a significant influx of CCR2+ monocyte-derived macrophages
  into the myocardium []. The progression to adverse remodeling and heart failure,
  characterized by excess fibrosis and hypertrophy, requires infiltration of CCR2+
  monocyte-derived macrophages, which replace the resident macrophage population;
  these results validate the widespread appreciation for the role of CCR2+ monocytes
  in TAC induced heart failure []. TAC-induced adverse remodeling and heart failure
  has also been shown by Wang et al. to require neutrophil infiltration, and neutrophil
  depletion reduces the absolute number of recruited monocytes []. Since infiltrated
  neutrophils appear earlier than recruited CCR2+ monocytes, it is possible that resident
  macrophages and infiltrated neutrophils synergistically recruit circulating CCR2+
  monocyte-derived macrophages; disruption of any of these processes prevents downstream
  responses that lead to adverse remodeling.
