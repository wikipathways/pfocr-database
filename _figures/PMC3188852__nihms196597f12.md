caption: With the success in the synthesis of the diol 12, selective protection of
  the C-16 axial hydroxymethyl group in preference to the equatorial hydroxymethyl
  group was achieved with dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ)-mediated oxidation. As
  illustrated in , following a process developed earlier in this laboratory, the diol
  12 was treated with DDQ in anhydrous THF to give the ether 34, which permitted further
  modification of the equatorial hydroxymethyl group. The hydroxymethyl group which
  remained was converted into the methyl ester 35 via the 2 steps detailed below.
  Various oxidative reagents (i.e., TPAP, Dess-Martin periodinate, and benzeneselenic
  anhydride) were employed to furnish the equatorial aldehyde 36; however, most of
  these efforts resulted in the decomposition of the starting material or cleavage
  of the C(6)–C(17)-oxygen bridge. Again, the conditions of the Corey-Kim oxidation
  could be employed successfully in this system; the monol 34 was converted into the
  equatorial aldehyde 35 in 90% yield. The aldehyde function of intermediate 35 was
  then oxidized to the methyl ester 36 with I2, and KOH in MeOH, following the work
  of Yamamoto et al.,, This illustrated atom economy at its best. After oxidative
  formation of the α-methyl ester 36 at C-16, the ether bond was reductively cleaved
  with TFA/Et3SiH in 85% yield to provide polyneuridine (8) [FTIR 3267 cm−1(OH), 1736
  cm−1(CO2Me)] (). As illustrated in , the spectral data of polyneuridine were in
  excellent agreement with the natural product., Furthermore, the important biogenetic
  intermediate, polyneuridine aldehyde (6) [FTIR 1731cm−1(CO2Me), 1707cm−1(CHO)] was
  then obtained by a second Corey-Kim oxidation (). Consequently, aldehyde 6 could
  be prepared from D-(+)-tryptophan methyl ester (14) in 13 reaction vessels in 14.1%
  overall yield. Reduction of polyneuridine aldehyde 6 with sodium borohydride returned
  polyneuridine 8, which confirmed the presence of the aldehyde moiety in 6. Finally,
  quarternization of the Nb nitrogen function in polyneuridine (8) with MeI provided
  the Nb-methiodide salt, macusine A (9) in 80% yield. This was the first total synthesis
  of these three alkaloids and was accomplished in stereospecific fashion.
