caption: Heme metabolism and HO-1 enzyme activity. HO-1 catalyze the rate-limiting
  step in heme metabolism. Heme is cleaved by HO-1 to yield equimolar quantities of
  iron, CO, and biliverdin. The regulatory actions of CO can be, at least in part
  mediated, by the activation of MAPK pathway. Biliverdin is converted to bilirubin
  by biliverdin reductase, this latter being also endowed with Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase
  activity through which regulates cell growth and metabolism. At low physiological
  concentrations, bilirubin behaves as a powerful antioxidant
