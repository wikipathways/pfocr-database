caption: Tg-AD rats at 11 mo of age exhibit AD pathology. We propose that manipulating
  PGD2 signaling through, for example, DP2 receptor antagonists such as TIMA, could
  prevent/mitigate AD pathology by several mechanisms. Further details are presented
  in the discussion, based on our current results with the Tg-AD rat model treated
  with TIMA, and studies published by others. Figure partially created with BioRender.com.Source
  data are available for this figure.
