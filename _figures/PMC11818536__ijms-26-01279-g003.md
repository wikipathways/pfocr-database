caption: Tumor suppression and promoting mechanisms of LACTB. LACTB exhibits dual
  roles in cancer biology, functioning as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending
  on the context and cancer type. As a tumor suppressor, LACTB expression influences
  mitochondrial structure and function, stabilizes p53 protein, activates cell death
  pathways such as ferroptosis, autophagy, and apoptosis, inhibits EMT, and suppresses
  the Hippo signaling pathway, thereby suppressing tumor progression. Conversely,
  in cancers such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and nasopharyngeal
  carcinoma, LACTB promotes tumorigenesis by destabilizing H3 histone proteins, facilitating
  cell cycle progression, and enhancing immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment.
  Additionally, post-translational modifications and mutations of LACTB contribute
  to its dual function, with succinylation at K284 promoting cancer progression through
  enhanced mitochondrial function, while the LACTBM5L+R469K mutant stabilizes the
  p53R156P protein and accelerates the degradation of wild-type p53, exerting tumor-suppressive
  effects. These findings highlight the complex, context-dependent roles of LACTB
  in cancer, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target. EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition. The red lines indicate the inhibitory effects on downstream signaling
  pathways, while the black arrows represent the promoting effects
