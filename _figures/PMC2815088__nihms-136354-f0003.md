caption: The enzymes involved in the synthesis and utilization of UDP-GlcNAc from
  nutrient precursors are shown. The role of O-GlcNAc cycling is emphasized, but UDP-GlcNAc
  is also the precursor for glycolipids, O-linked GalNAc and N-linked Glycoproteins
  in the endomembrane system as indicated by other on each side of the UDP-HexNAcs
  (see text). The mammalian enzymes are listed with the C. elegans homologs in italics.
  The nutrient-derived precursors glucose, glutamine, acetyl-CoA, UTP are integrated
  by the pathway and UDP-GlcNAc levels reflect the nutrient status. O-GlcNAc cycling
  is the terminal step in the hexosamine signaling pathway.
