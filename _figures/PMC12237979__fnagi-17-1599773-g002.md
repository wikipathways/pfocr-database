caption: Necroptotic pathways. In the classical necroptosis pathway, TNF-α binds to
  its receptor TNFR1 and then to TRADD, RIPK1, TRAF family proteins, cIAP1/2, and
  LUBAC to form complex I, which is critical for cell survival. In most cases, TRADD
  in complex I acts as an adaptor molecule that, once activated, recruits RIPK1 to
  TNFR1, cIAP1/2, and TRAF2/5 to promote complex I stabilization. TGF-β-activated
  kinase 1 is then activated to recruit IKK complexes. This leads to the activation
  of the NF-κB pathway, which promotes the production of inflammatory factors and
  cell survival. CYLD is recruited to complex I through its adaptor protein spermatogenesis-associated
  2, which in turn binds to LUBAC. The proximity of CYLD to its substrate depends
  on the ubiquitin-binding protein A20. Once CYLD mediates the deubiquitination of
  RIPK1, the stability of complex I decreases. RIPK1 dissociates from complex I on
  the plasma membrane and recruits Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), which
  then binds to pro-caspase-8 to form complex IIa. In complex IIa, the caspase-8 complex
  activates the caspase signaling pathway to induce apoptosis, thereby triggering
  cell death. When caspase-8 is inhibited, RIPK1 is autophosphorylated and binds to
  RIPK3 via the RIPK homotypic interaction motif to form complex IIb, and RIPK3 phosphorylation
  promotes MLKL phosphorylation. p-MLKL oligomerizes and translocates to the cell
  membrane, leading to the disruption of cell and organelle membranes and eventually
  to necrosis. The non-classical necroptotic pathway is complex and diverse. Double-stranded
  RNA molecules recognize and bind TLR3 and LPS recognizes and binds TLR4 and recruits
  phosphorylated RIPK1 and RIPK3 by binding TRIF, leading to programmed necrosis.
  ZBP1 recognizes and binds to Z-form RNA molecules released by virus-released nucleic
  acids in the cytoplasm, and simultaneously activates and phosphorylates RIPK3, which
  acquires kinase activity. Activated RIPK3 phosphorylates MLKL and induces necroptosis
