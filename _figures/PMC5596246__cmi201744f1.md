caption: Caspases in extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway
  is activated by ligand binding and the death receptor, which then recruits TRADD
  or FADD to form a DISC complex, resulting in the activation of initiator caspase-8
  or -10. These caspases then directly cleave and activate the effector caspases-3,
  -6 and -7, effectively executing cellular apoptosis. Alternatively, the intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway can be activated by intrinsic stimuli, including various cellular
  stressors, DNA damage and growth factor deprivation. Subsequently, the activation
  of BAK and BAX or the inactivation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members leads
  to MOMP and the release of mitochondrial factors, such as cytochrome c. Cytochrome
  c binding to APAF-1 is important for the activation and oligomerization of caspase-9
  to form the apoptosome. The activation of caspase-9 then initiates apoptosis by
  activating the effector caspases. FADD, FAS-associated death domain; TRADD, TNFR-associated
  death domain; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; caspases, cysteinyl aspartate
  proteinases; BAX, BCL-2-associated X protein; BAK, BCL-2 antagonist or killer; MOMP,
  mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization; APAF-1, apoptotic protease-activating
  factor 1.
