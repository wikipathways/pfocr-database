caption: (A) Schematic representation of retrotransposon/HERV life cycle; (B) Mechanism
  of FNC-triggered chain termination. The 3′-OH group of FNC is unlikely to be used
  by polymerases for elongation of proviral RNA synthesis.; (C) Representation of
  antitumor mehanisms of FNC through multiple molecular pathways. FNC promotes apoptosis
  by decreasing Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-3 which further regulates
  proteolytic cleavage of many key proteins such as PARP. FNC inhibits the adhesion,
  migration and invasion of Raji and JeKo-1 cell lines by up-regulating the expression
  of E-cadherin and GSK-3β proteins and down-regulating the expression of proteins
  such as β-catenin, VEGF, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has a
  crucial position in the development and promotion of a wide variety of cancers.
  Activated Wnt/β-catenin changing the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex expression is
  significantly coupled with the invasiveness of tumor cells. FNC is a cell cycle-nonspecific
  agent which causes G1/S or G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis. It
  inhibits cell cycle checkpoint activation (e.g., Cyclin-A binding to CDK2 permits
  cells to complete S phase and enter to M phase); (D) Graphic Abstract, depicts the
  possible mechanisms of FNC anticancer and antiviral activities.
