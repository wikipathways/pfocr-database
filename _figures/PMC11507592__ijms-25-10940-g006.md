caption: A model of PA signaling in plant cells induced by salt stress. Salt stress
  is detected at the cell membrane, activating the PLC and PLD signaling pathways.
  In the PLC pathway, PI is sequentially phosphorylated to form PIP and PIP2. Upon
  cleavage by PI-PLC, PIP2 is converted into DAG and IP3. DAG can then be transformed
  into PA in the presence of DGK, while IP3 diffuses into the cytoplasm and is further
  converted into IP6. IP6 plays a crucial role in the ABA signaling pathway, influencing
  the release of Ca2+ and subsequently modulating the expression of salt stress-responsive
  genes. In the PLD pathway, PA can be generated from the hydrolysis of PC by PLD
  or from the hydrolysis of both PC and PE by PLDα. Through the action of PAK, the
  resulting PA can induce the formation of DGPP, a signaling molecule in plant cells.
  Alternatively, MPK6 can bind to PA to activate SOS1 on the plasma membrane, facilitating
  the expulsion of Na+. MPK6 can also phosphorylate MAP65-1 bound to PA, enhancing
  microtubule polymerization in response to salt stress. Additionally, SnRK2.4 can
  promote salt tolerance in plants by binding to PA. PA, phosphatidic acid; PLC, phospholipase
