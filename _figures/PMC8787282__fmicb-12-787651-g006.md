caption: Cartoon depicting putative metabolism of GAL08 based on SAG analysis. Predicted
  metabolic components include an oxidative phosphorylation pathway, an incomplete
  denitrification pathway (absence of nirKS), acetate fermentation, fatty acid degradation,
  a small number of ABC transporters (shown in orange on the left of the figure),
  a PTS system for mannose, several major facilitator superfamily transporters, Sec-SRP
  plus TolC and Type II secretion systems, a TonB-dependent outer membrane transport
  system possibly acting in siderophore transport, and potential fermentation pathways.
  The symbol “?” and dashed lines both indicate a speculative metabolic component
  or product. A list of accession numbers for the genes shown is provided in . A list
  of amino acid auxotrophies is shown in .
