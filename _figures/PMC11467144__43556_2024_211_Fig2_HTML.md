caption: WNT signalling pathways in the intestinal crypt and potential therapeutic
  targets. Sustained activation of the WNT signaling pathway is dependent on the presence
  of R-spondin. R-spondin binds to LGR family receptors and also binds to RNF43-ZNRF3,
  which in turn stabilizes FZD expression. Upon binding to FZD and LRP5-LRP6, the
  WNT pathway is activated. This activation leads to the activation of the intracellular
  scrambling protein Dvl (Dishevelled), a crucial component in the WNT signaling cascade.
  Dvl inhibits the phosphorylation of β-Catenin by disrupting the complex composed
  of Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase 1 (CK1), and glycogen synthase
  3 (GSK3). Accumulated β-catenin then enters the nucleus and promotes transcription
  by binding to T-cell factor (TCF) and displacing Groucho. The potential targets
  and their mechanisms of action have been marked with pink boxes
