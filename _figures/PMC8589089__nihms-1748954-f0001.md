caption: The ubiquitin-proteasome system and SUMOylation pathway. A) The biochemical
  process of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. a) In an ATP-dependent manner, ubiquitin
  (Ub) is activated by E1 and covalently linked to the cysteines of E1 by a thioester
  bond; activated Ub is then transferred to an E2 conjugating enzyme to form a covalent
  complex through the same thioester bond; E3 ubiquitin ligase facilitates the transfer
  of the Ub to the lysine residues of the substrate or previously conjugated Ub. b)
  The ubiquitination of substrate proteins can be reversed by deubiquitination enzymes.
  B) The dynamic catalytic cycle of the SUMOylation pathway. In an ATP dependent manner,
  the heterodimeric E1 activating enzyme (SAE1 and SAE2) catalyzes the formation of
  thioester bond between glycine residue of SUMO and the cysteine residues of SAE2.
  The activated SUMO is then transferred to the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9. Finally,
  a SUMO E3 ligase catalyzes SUMO conjugation to the lysine residue of specific substrates.
  SUMOylation is also a reversible process where the modified proteins can be deSUMOylated
  by sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs)
