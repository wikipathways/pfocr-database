caption: 'CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches for modeling kidney disease. (A) CRISPR/Cas9-based
  genome editing. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing requires two components for sequence-specific
  DNA cleavage: a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeted to the genomic locus of interest
  and the RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease. In the presence of an sgRNA, the Cas9 endonuclease
  homes in on the target sequence and induces a double-stranded break (DSB) directly
  upstream of a protospacer-adjacent-motif (PAM) sequence. The DSB is repaired by
  cell-endogenous mechanisms, either the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed
  repair pathways (HDR). NHEJ does not require a donor template and creates insertion
  or deletion mutations that usually produce knockout phenotypes. The HDR pathway
  allows precise modifications of the genome in the presence of a donor template to
  generate knock-in phenotypes. (B) dCas9 systems for epigenetic editing. dCas9 can
  be fused to histone modifiers, such as the histone acetyltransferase p300, which
  specifically acetylates histones near the target DNA sequence, activating gene expression
  (), or the histone demethylase Lsd1 (). Additionally, dCas9 fusion systems can also
  modulate DNA methylation levels with DNMT3A or TET1 (). Acetyl groups are indicated
  as ''AC''; methyl groups are indicated as ‘me’.'
