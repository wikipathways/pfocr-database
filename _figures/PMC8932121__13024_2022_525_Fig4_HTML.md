caption: 'Overview of the STING pathway, the involvement of C9orf72 and its relation
  to C9 ALS/FTD. Cytosolic (mislocalized) TDP-43 species and/or DPR proteins cause
  mitochondrial damage and lead to the increased production and release of toxic ROS
  and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). cGAS, which is a cytosolic DNA sensor, binds the
  mtDNA and catalyzes the production of cGAMP which in turn results in stimulator
  of interferon genes (STING) protein dimerization. STING dimers are able to translocate
  to the Golgi, where they bind and activate TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1). This complex
  will then phosphorylate inhibitor of NF-κBα (IκBα) and interferon regulatory factor
  3 (IRF3) and cause both transcription factors to localize to the nucleus and promote
  the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. The active
  STING-TBK1 signalosome is involved in autophagosome formation, an initial step in
  the process of autophagy. Interestingly, STING is degraded itself by autophagy and
  thus has an elegant self-regulatory mechanism to control its levels and the activation
  of the STING-based immune response. Moreover, as C9orf72 is also involved in endolysosomal
  trafficking and autophagy, reduced levels of the C9orf72 protein may cause a delay
  or failure of STING degradation and a hyperactivation of the type I interferon response.
