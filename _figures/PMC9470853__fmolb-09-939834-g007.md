caption: Contribution of Cr-FAX1 and Cr-FAX5 for oil synthesis in Chlamydomonas. According
  to our working hypothesis, Cr-FAX1 with its 4 α-helical domains (green) integrates
  in an asymmetric fashion into the inner envelope (IE) membrane of chloroplasts.
  Most likely the N-terminus is in the stroma (str) and the C-terminus in the intermembrane
  space (ims). In comparison to proteolytic pattern of Ps-FAX1 in purified IE membrane
  vesicles from pea chloroplasts (JP and KP, unpublished results), Cr-FAX1 presumably
  orients with the N-terminus to the stroma and the C-terminus exposed to the ims.
  Upon proteolysis of this C-terminus of Ps-FAX1, intermediate bands can be detected
  by an antiserum directed against an N-terminal peptide stretch (JP and KP, unpublished
  results). Since the C-terminus of the structural model shown in  is almost completely
  protected by the lipid bilayer, the model of , which is adapted here, is more likely
  to lead to these intermediate band pattern. Cr-FAX5 (turquoise) in a similar fashion
  sits in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). De novo fatty acid synthesis
  (FAS) occurs in the chloroplast stroma and the acyl-ACP thioesterase 1 (FAT1) generates
  free fatty acids (FFA) for export mediated by FAX1. The transport mode for FAs across
  the outer envelope (OE) membrane still is unclear. Import of FFAs and/or acyl-CoA
  into the ER occurs via the ABC transporter ABCA2 and with the help of FAX5. If both
  proteins act together or represent different FA import routes remains to be elucidated.
  However, function of ABCA2 and FAX5, most likely contributes acyl chains for triacylglycerol
  (TAG) synthesis and assembly in the ER. As described in the text, we assume that
  FAT1, FAX1, FAX5 and LACS1 (long chain acyl CoA synthetase 1) function in the same
  transport pathway from chloroplast to the ER for fueling FAs into TAG oil synthesis.
