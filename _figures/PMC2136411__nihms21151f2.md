caption: 'Representative intracellular g-protein coupled signal transduction cascades.
  Subheading: Cell surface receptors, such as norepinephrine ß receptors, are coupled
  to stimulatory G (Gs) proteins. On transmitter binding, Gs activates adenylate cyclase
  (AC), catalyzing the formation of cyclic AMP from ATP ➀. Cyclic AMP is degraded
  to AMP by phosphodiesterases (PDE), which inactivate the cyclic AMP signal ➁. Cyclic
  AMP binds to the regulator subunits (R) of protein kinase A (PKA), resulting in
  a conformational change and the release of two catalytic subunits (C) ➂. The C subunits
  then are capable of phosphorylating serine and threonine residues on target polypeptides.
  One such protein is cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), a transcriptional
  factor ➃. Phosphorylation of CREB results in translocation of CREB-P to the nucleus
  and subsequent binding to CRE-containing gene promoter regions activating expression
  ➄. A parallel pathway, exemplified by the 5-HT2A transductional cascade, couples
  to Gq (another stimulatory G protein), activating phospholipase C (PLC) catalyzing
  the conversion of phosphotidylinositol (PI) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol
  triphosphate (IP3) ➅. IP3 mobilizes Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. DAG
  binds to protein kinase C resulting in phosphorylation of target proteins; these
  include both CREB and PKA ➆. The phosphorylation of PKA regulates the activity of
  the enzyme. Phosphorylated substrates are subsequently dephosphorylated by protein
  phosphatase 2A ➇. On dephosphorylation, CREB returns to the cytosol. Another regulator
  of PKA activity is protein kinase inhibitor (PKI); in the case of fibroblasts, this
  is the PKIγ isoform ➈. Both PKA and PKC can be glutathionylated, protecting them
  from oxidative degradation ➉. The activation loops of both enzymes are phosphorylated
  by phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)'
