caption: Metformin inhibits cancer invasion and migration by blocking EMT signaling
  pathway. Metformin suppress the process of EMT by driving down the expression of
  transcription factors such as SNAIL, TWIST, and ZEB. It can also regulate miRNAs
  in EMT signaling, including miR-200c and miR-381. In addition to the above mechanisms,
  metformin also inhibits EMT by antagonizing SMAD2 and/or SMAD3 combine with SMAD4
  to form trimeric SMAD complexes activated by TGFβ family proteins; or inhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling by regulating TGFβ family proteins. Metformin also inhibited tyrosine
  kinases receptors and the main downstream pathways are PI3K/AKT/NF-κB and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK
  MAPK signaling. Metformin also reduces STAT3 activation by inhibiting IL-6. ZEB,
  E-box-binding; TGFβ, transforming growth factor-β; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B;
  STAT3, transcription 3; IL-6, interleukin-6.
