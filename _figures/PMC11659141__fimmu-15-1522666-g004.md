caption: Complement and coagulation genes are differentially expressed in head kidney
  samples between A. salmonicida-resistant and A. salmonicida-susceptible families.
  (A) Heatmap and (B) reference KEGG pathways representing the DEGs between both families
  under naïve conditions and involved in the complement and coagulation cascades.
  (C) Heatmap and (D) KEGG reference pathway representing the DEGs between both families
  at 24 hpi and involved in the “complement and coagulation cascades”. In the KEGG
  pathways, green indicates higher expression, and red indicates lower expression
  in the resistant family compared to that in the susceptible family
