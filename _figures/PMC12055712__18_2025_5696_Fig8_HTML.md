caption: Model illustrating the regulatory role of Roraa in circadian rhythms and
  metabolism. This diagram depicts the interactions between the core circadian clock
  components (Bmal1 and Clock) and various downstream genes, including roraa, as well
  as their influence on metabolic pathways. Key regulatory elements, such as E-boxes,
  D-boxes, and ROREs, are highlighted, indicating their involvement in the transcriptional
  regulation of target genes. Roraa has been shown to directly influence the expression
  of per2 via the RORE, linking circadian control to metabolic processes. Additionally,
  the pathways affected by Roraa, including the PPAR signaling pathway and Ras signaling
  pathway, are illustrated, emphasizing its role in lipid metabolism and overall metabolic
  homeostasis
