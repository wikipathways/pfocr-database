caption: The cGAS/STING signaling pathway. cGAS consists of an N-terminal domain and
  a C-terminal domain that contains two lobes and a catalytic domain. The tumor cells
  are damaged under various stresses (the box on the right); the free self-DNA from
  the nucleus, mitochondria, and dying tumor cells bind to and activate cGAS, and
  catalyze the synthesis cGAMP. cGAMP binds to and changes the conformation of STING,
  and then STING transfers from ER to Golgi apparatus and is phosphorylated by adjacent
  activated TBK1. Subsequently, IRF3 and NFκB are phosphorylated by TBK1 and translocate
  into the nucleus to regulate IFN-I and inflammatory cytokine generation.
