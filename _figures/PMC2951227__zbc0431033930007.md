caption: Hypothetical model for Rad18-dependent activation of the FA pathway in response
  to bulky DNA adducts. Bulky DNA adducts cause uncoupling of replicative helicase
  (Mcm2–7) and DNA polymerase activities (step 1). The ensuing accumulation of replication
  protein A-coated ssDNA recruits the Rad18-pol η complex leading to PCNA mono-ubiquitylation
  (step 2). Potentially, mono-ubiquitinated PCNA might promote FA pathway activation
  via pol η-independent mechanisms (step 3, pathway depicted on left-hand side). Alternatively,
  engagement of pol η or other DNA TLS polymerases with mono-ubiquitinated PCNA might
  generate protein complexes and/or DNA structures that facilitate the recruitment
  of FA core complex members to sites of replication stalling, promoting FANCD2-FANCI
  ubiquitination (step 3, pathway depicted on right-hand side).
