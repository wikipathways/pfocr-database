caption: 'Schematic representation of structure, biosynthetic processing, and life
  cycle of 3 surfactant system components associated with interstitial lung disease
  in humans by the alveolar type 2 cell. Biosynthesis: along with phospholipids, surfactant
  protein (SP)-B, and SP-D, AT2 cells synthesize SP-C, SP-A, and ABCA3. SP-C: the
  human SFTPC gene is transcribed and translated to a 197-amino acid (21-kDa) proprotein
  (proSP-C21). ProSP-C21 is translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is sorted
  in the Golgi, and enters the regulated secretory pathway where it is processed by
  4 endoproteolytic cleavages of NH2 and COOH propeptide domains as it transits through
  small or sorting vesicles (SV), multivesicular bodies (MVB), and composite bodies
  (CB) to lamellar bodies (LB), the site of the final cleavage. Inset, left: topological
  representation of the bitopic proSP-C showing its type II orientation. The 4 domains
  of proSP-C include NH2-terminal targeting domain harboring lysine 6 ubiquitination
  site (yellow oval) and Nedd4-2 binding “PY” targeting motif (black rectangle); mature
  domain (depicted in blue) containing juxtamembrane palmitoylation sites (pink bars)
  and valine-rich α-helical transmembrane hydrophobic region; linker domain, site
  for the common I73T mutant variant (yellow pentagon); BRICHOS domain with the exon4
  deletion region (depicted in gray), and L188Q mutation (yellow triangle). Conserved
  cysteine residues (C121 and C189) form the primary disulfide-bond (gray bar). ABCA3:
  initially routed to post-Golgi sorting vesicles, ABCA3 is trafficked via the MVB/CB
  network to LBs and plasma membrane. ABCA3 undergoes a posttranslational proteolytic
  cleavage within the proximal NH2-terminal region at distal post-Golgi compartments.
  Inset, bottom right: predicted topological structure of the ABCA3 transporter. ABCA3
  comprises 12 putative membrane-spanning helices where the NH2- and COOH-terminal
  domains and the 2 ABC binding cassettes (ABC1 and ABC2) face the cytosol. The NH2
  targeting signal for Golgi exit (yellow region) and the 2 glycosylation sites within
  the first luminal loop (orange) are shown. ECD, extracellular domain. SP-A: the
  human SFTPA gene gives rise to multiple mRNA transcripts that assemble into an 18-mer
  native structure made up from 6 SP-A trimers. The assembled form of SP-A is secreted
  by both regulated and constitutive pathways. Posttranslational modifications of
  SP-A include signal peptide cleavage prior to entering the ER, hydroxylation of
  proline residues, and N-linked glycosylation. Inset, top right: structural representation
  of a native SP-A. The primary structure of SP-A protein consists of 4 domains: a
  short amino-terminal domain, a collagenous domain, a neck domain, and a carbohydrate
  recognition domain (CRD). Six of the SP-A trimers composed of 2 SP-A1 molecules
  (depicted in green) and 1 SP-A2 molecule (depicted in black) give rise to the mature
  SP-A 18-mer. A proline residue in the collagenous domain of SP-A primary structure
  provides a flexible kink that causes the trimers to bend outward in different directions,
  giving the native SP-A 18-mer a “flower bouquet” appearance. Secretion: surfactant
  phospholipid, processed SP-C, SP-B, and SP-A contained in the LB are released by
  regulated exocytosis; ABCA3 remains in the LB membrane and is recycled. A portion
  of SP-A and SP-D is secreted constitutively. Reuptake/degradation/recycling: SP-A,
  SP-C, together with other surfactant proteins and lipids, are taken up by AT2 cells
  via endocytosis and are either targeted to the lysosomes for degradation or recycled
  back to LBs via endosomes and MVBs.'
