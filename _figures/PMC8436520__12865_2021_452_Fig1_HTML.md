caption: The IL-12-IFN-γ cytokine pathways. The IFN-γ-IL-12 pathway is involved in
  the host response to infection with certain intracellular viral and bacterial pathogens
  such as Mycobacteria and Salmonella. Upon recognition of the pathogen (indicated
  in red), phagocytes (such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs)) secrete IL-12
  which bind to their receptors on T lymphocytes and NK cells, inducing the production
  of IFN-γ. IL-12 production is enhanced by a CD40-triggered, NEMO/NFκB-dependent
  pathway. The proteins encoded by genes that have been associated with MSMD are indicated
  in blue. Mutations in IFNGR1, IFNGR2, CYBB, STAT1, JAK1 and IRF8 impair the action
  of IFN-γ while mutations in IL12B, IL12RB1, IL12RB2, ISG15, IKBKG (NEMO) and IRF8
  impairs the function of IFN-γ.(Adapted from Bustamante et al. []). RORC, SPPL2A,
  L23R and their protein products are not indicated in this figure but have also been
  implicated in MSMD and IFN-γ-mediated immunity)
