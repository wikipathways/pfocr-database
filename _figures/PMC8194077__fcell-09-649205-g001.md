caption: 'Overview of the Notch signaling pathway. The Notch signaling pathway operates
  between four cell surface Notch receptors (Notch1-4) and four agonistic Notch ligands
  from the Jagged (Jag1, Jag2) and Delta-like families (Dll1, Dll4). Mechanisms of
  Notch activation and canonical signaling are depicted along the following steps:
  (1) A furin-like protease cleaves the Notch receptor into a transmembrane heterodimer
  during its transit to cell surface through the Golgi complex (S1 site); (2) Ligand-receptor
  binding generates a physical force onto the extracellular domain of the Notch receptor,
  allowing ADAM10-mediated proteolysis at the S2 site which is normally hidden within
  a “negative regulatory region” of the receptor; (3) ADAM10 generates a membrane-bound
  intermediate that becomes rapidly sensitive to intramembrane proteolysis by the
  γ-secretase complex (S3 site). As a result, intracellular Notch (ICN) is released
  into the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus. (4) ICN binds with the DNA-binding
  protein RBP-Jκ (also known as CSL); (5) ICN and RBP-Jκ recruit a member of the Mastermind-like
  (MAML) family of transcriptional coactivators via the N-terminal MAML alpha-helical
  domain; (6) In turn, MAML proteins recruit other transcriptional co-activators (CoA)
  and p300, respectively, to enhance transcription of Notch target genes.'
