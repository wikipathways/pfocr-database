caption: Gi/o protein-dependent and -independent effects of PTX. Following the binding
  of PTX to host cells, the A-protomer penetrates through the cell membrane. A-protomer
  is dissociated from B-oligomer and released into the cytoplasm. A-protomer then
  catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gαi/o that leads to uncoupling of Gαi/o from its
  cognate inhibitory GPCRs. The inhibitory effect of Gαi/o on AC activity is then
  halted, resulting in accumulation of cAMP. This action of PTX results in disruption
  of cellular function through cAMP-mediated signaling pathway (Gi/o protein-dependent
  effects). In a separate pathway, the B-oligomer binds to and interacts with several
  targeted proteins on the plasma membrane, leading to the induction of the biological
  responses that are independent of ADP-ribosylation of Gαi/o protein (Gi/o protein-independent
  effects).
