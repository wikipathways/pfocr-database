caption: (A) Diagram of the interactions of various events in the compiled network
  of 4 AOPs. Blue nodes are molecular initiating events, black nodes are key events,
  and yellow are adverse outcomes. Numbers represent the indices of the events in
  the AOPwiki. Information on each node is available at aopwiki.org/events/xxx, where
  xxx is the index in the node. (B) Diagram of the curated AOP network presented in
  panel A with indirect interactions removed and events with the same functional consequences
  collapsed into a single node. (C) Diagram of the quantitative model based on the
  curated AOP network presented in panel B. Highlighted in red are the nodes for which
  we have obtained data, with the dose/dose response relationships indicated by red
  arrows.
