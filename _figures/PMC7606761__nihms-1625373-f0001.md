caption: 'Therapeutics can target various steps in the APAP pathophysiology: APAP
  hepatotoxicity is initiated by formation of the reactive metabolite NAPQI by cytochrome
  P450 mediated activation in microsomes. Elevated NAPQI depletes hepatic glutathione
  stores and forms mitochondrial protein adducts resulting in enhanced superoxide
  release into the cytosol. This activates the MAP kinase JNK, which translocates
  to mitochondria and amplifies the mitochondrial oxidative and nitrosative stress.
  This ultimately activates the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) resulting
  in release of endonuclease G (EndoG) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) into the
  cytosol and their translocation to the nucleus. The resulting nuclear DNA fragmentation
  induces hepatocyte necrosis and release of damage associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPS). This initiates a reparative innate immune response by activating resident
  Kupffer cells, which release cytokines and chemokines to attract circulating neutrophils
  into the necrotic foci to remove dead cells and activate regeneration. Additional
  mechanisms of recovery include activation of the Nrf2 pathway resulting in its disengagement
  from its cytosolic partner Keap 1 followed by nuclear translocation and induction
  of genes such as those involved in replenishing hepatic GSH content. Stressed cells
  could also activate mitochondrial biogenesis to compensate for lost mitochondrial
  function and attempt to recover from the liver injury. Interventions can target
  various steps of this pathway, with 4-methylpyrazole inhibiting both cytochrome
  P450 mediated NAPQI formation as well as downstream JNK activation. Calmangafodipir
  is thought to function as a SOD mimetic to prevent mitochondrial oxidant stress,
  while activators of the A2B receptors enhance the innate immune response to accelerate
  recovery. Enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis by treatments such as SRT1720
  also facilitate this process of recovery after APAP-induced acute liver injury.
