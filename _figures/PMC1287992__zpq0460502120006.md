caption: Induction of cell death by NO-ASA. The spacer part of NO-ASA reacts with
  GSH, depleting cell GSH levels and thus generating oxidative stress, which activates
  the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Activation of caspase 3 cleaves β-catenin, leading
  to disruption of adherens junctions. NO-ASA also inhibits Wnt signaling; this effect
  is enhanced by caspase 3-induced cleavage of β-catenin. Changes in the expression
  of the many Wnt signaling-dependent genes, including cyclin D1, contribute to cell
  death. (Inset) Cell adherens junctions. Arrows, positive effect; T-shaped arrows,
  negative effect; dashed arrows, speculative effect.
