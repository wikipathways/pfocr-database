caption: 'Atypical antipsychotic (AAP) mechanisms (shown in green) on the prefrontal
  cortex alterations of neonatal ventral hippocampus lesioned animals (red arrowheads).The
  canonical mechanisms of atypical antipsychotics include the antagonism of D2 and
  5-HT2A receptors. Moreover, other mechanisms are implied in the effectiveness of
  these substances, such as antioxidant and neurotrophic effects, including the restoration
  of the Nrf2 pathway that promotes the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes, which attenuates
  oxidative/nitrosative stress (O/NS). Nitric oxide (NO) is necessary for dendritic
  spine maturation, but leads to O/NS at excessive levels. Microglia is the main NO
  source in the inflammatory response and also eliminates synapses via the complement
  system, the effect of APPs on this system is still unknown. There are neurotrophic
  effects of AAPs throughout the BDNF/TrkB pathway which improve NMDA function. Altogether,
  these mechanisms improve the prefrontal cortex function in rats with NHVL. 5-HT2A:
  5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A; BDNF/TrkB: brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin
  receptor kinase B; iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; NMDA: N-methyl D-aspartate
  glutamate receptor; nNOS: neural nitric oxide synthase; Nrf2: nuclear factor (erythroid-derived
  2)-like 2; PSD-95: postsynaptic density protein 95.'
