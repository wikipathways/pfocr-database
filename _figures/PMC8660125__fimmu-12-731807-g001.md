caption: (A) Graphical illustration of the induction of type III interferon gene expression
  upon rhinovirus infection. HRV enters the cell via ICAM-1 receptor, CDHR3 receptor
  or via clathrin-mediated LDLR endocytosis. Viral cytosolic and endosomal ssRNA and
  dsRNA can be detected by PRR and PRM such as RIG-1 or MDA-5 (cytosolic) or TLR3
  and TLR7/8 (endosomal), respectively. PRR and PRM induce downstream signaling cascades
  leading to recruitment of IRFs and NF-κB that promote type III interferon gene expression
  in the nucleus. (B) Graphical illustration of the signaling pathway after TLR 7
  and 8 activation by resiquimod (R848). TLR 7 and 8 are located in intracellular
  vesicles, where they bind ssRNA or substances that mimic their structure. After
  activation, the signal is transduced via Myeloid differentiation primary response
  88 (MyD88). Important mediators are TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 3 and
  6 as well as different interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase family members (IRAKs).
  Interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 3 and 7 and nuclear factor ‘kappa-light-chain-enhancer’
  of activated B-cells (NF-κB) are the key regulatory factors that influence the gene
  expression in the nucleus. As a result the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and type I interferons is enhanced.
