caption: 'HER2-mediated downstream signaling pathway. (1) HER2-mediated activation
  of MAPK signaling pathway. Upon homodimerization of HER2 receptors, these receptors
  are phosphorylated at different phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of HER2 provides
  binding sites for Grb-2 proteins which bind to SOS with GEF activity. SOS then activates
  RAS by replacing the GDP with GTP. The activated RAS phosphorylates Raf, and Raf
  phosphorylates MEK. Finally, ERK is phosphorylated and activated by MEK which enables
  this protein to enter the nucleus and activate the transcription of genes involved
  in various cellular processes. (2) HER2-mediated activation of PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway: upon the binding of HER3-specific ligands, such as heregulin (HRG) to HER3,
  the HER2-HER3 heterodimers are formed and HER2 phosphorylates HER3 at different
  tyrosine residues. The phosphorylated HER3 provides docking sites for p85 subunit
  of PI3K. The fully activated PI3K complex is generated by binding of p110 subunit
  of PI3K to p85 which is able to produce PIP3 via phosphorylating the PIP2. AKT binds
  to PIP3 and is phosphorylated by PDK1 and mTORC2. Phosphorylation of AKT at both
  threonine and serin phosphorylation sites significantly increases its catalytic
  activity which regulates the function of various proteins involved in several cellular
  processes. (3) HER2-mediated inhibition of PTEN activity: SRC binds to HER2 receptors
  and inhibits the activity of PTEN via mediating the phosphorylation of this enzyme.
  As a phosphatase, PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3 and therefore inhibits the binding
  of AKT to PIP3.'
