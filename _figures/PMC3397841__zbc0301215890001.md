caption: Allene oxide synthase and its relationship to the catalytic cycle of cytochrome
  P450s. A, cAOS catalyzes transformation of its natural substrate 8R-HPETE to an
  allene oxide, which can subsequently rearrange to a cyclopentenone. B, the circular
  route represents the conventional monooxygenase pathway, involving molecular oxygen
  and NADPH and leading to Compound I, which initiates reaction with substrate. The
  peroxide shunt pathway uses an oxygen donor, [O], to form Compound I and bypass
  the need for O2 and NADPH. In fatty acid peroxide-metabolizing enzymes (CYP 5, 8A,
  74, and cAOS), the ferric enzyme initiates reaction and forms Compound II directly.
  Por+· represents a radical cation on the heme porphyrin ring.
