caption: Regulated proteolysis regulates guidance receptor function. (a) Processive
  proteolysis of a prototypical type I transmembrane (TM) protein, such as Notch or
  APP. Upon ligand binding, cleavage by an ADAM10 in the juxta-membrane region causes
  release of an N-terminal fragment into the extracellular space (ectodomain) and
  generates a C-terminal fragment (CTF) with a small extracellular stub. A second,
  constitutive cleavage by the gamma-secretase complex within the plane of the plasma
  membrane releases the intracellular domain (ICD). In the case of Notch, the ICD
  translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates transcription. (b) Regulated proteolysis
  of DCC occurs by ADAM10-mediated creation of a CTF, followed by gamma-secretase-mediated
  intramembraneous cleavage releasing DCC ICD. This ICD is competent to translocate
  to the nucleus when fused to Gal4. The cleavage event by ADAM10 leads to attenuation
  of neuritogenesis in vitro. (c) Following ligand-receptor complex formation, ADAM10
  cleaves the ephrin-A5 ligand. This regulated proteolytic event leads to release
  from the initial cell-cell adhesion, allowing for growth cone retraction, and is
  necessary for the transduction of the EphA3 forward signal. (d) Processive cleavage
  in the ephrinB/ephB system indicates that the released ephrinB ICD may activate
  SRC-family kinases to contribute to reverse signaling. On the other hand, cleavage
  of the EphB2 receptor, in this case by matrix metalloproteases, is required for
  activation in vitro. (e) Kuzbanian appears to act positively in the Slit-Robo signaling
  pathway. On the basis of genetic observations and the abnormal presence of Robo
  protein on the commissural portions of axons in kuz mutants, we speculate that Kuz
  may cleave Robo to regulate receptor activity.
