caption: Schematic diagram on pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. In diabetic conditions,
  high glucose, activation of the polyol pathway, glomerular hyperfiltration, activation
  of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAA), increase of advanced glycation
  end-product (AGE), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of diacylglycerol
  (DAG)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway and an increase in Tgfb lead to abnormal cellular
  responses, such as overproduction of extracellular matrices and inflammation in
  the kidney. Diabetes also affects the production of nitric oxide (NO), Angpt2 and
  glycocalyx in the glomerular endothelial cells, and leads to endothelial injury.
  In podocytes, reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A expression increased
  mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and insulin resistance leads to
  podocyte dysfunction resulting in podocyte detachment and apoptosis. Furthermore,
  recent findings show that tubulointerstitial fibrosis also plays significant roles.
  These cell types are tightly connected together, and dysfunctions in one compartment
  can spread to other cell types.
