caption: The central role of ACE 2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity.
  Exposure to air pollutants like cigarette smoke and PM2.5 increases ACE2 expression
  (1) notably in upper and lower airway epithelial cells, providing more opportunities
  for SARS-CoV-2 binding []. SARS-CoV-2 fusion glycoproteins forming the spikes require
  cleaving by an endogenous protease like transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2)
  in order to optimally bind to its receptor ACE2 and be internalized for replication
  []. The decreased surface expression of ACE2 limits the amount of Angiotensin II
  that is cleaved by ACE2 into Ang1-7. This decrease in Ang1-7 signaling through its
  G couple receptor MAS in favor of the pro-inflammatory AngII/AT1R pathway likely
  contributes to COVID-19 disease pathogenesis
