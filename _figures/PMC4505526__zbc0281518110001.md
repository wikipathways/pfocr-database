caption: Sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. A, l-Ser and palmitoyl-CoA are condensed
  by SPT to form 3-keto-sphinganine, which is reduced to SA. Then, SA is N-acylated
  to form DHCer and desaturated to form Cer. In addition, Cer is converted to SO and
  subsequently phosphorylated to generate sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) by the degradative
  pathway. B, sphingoid bases generated by SPT, which uses not only l-Ser but also
  l-Ala or Gly as a substrate and synthesizes atypical doxSLs. Because of the lack
  of the C1 hydroxyl group, doxSLs can neither be converted to complex sphingolipids
  nor degraded by the degradative pathway.
