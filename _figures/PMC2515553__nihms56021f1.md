caption: Upon initiation of the IPC stimulus, endogenous triggers such as adenosine,
  opioids, and bradykinin are released. These endogenous agents bind to membrane receptors
  and when released in large enough quantities they achieve a threshold to activate
  intracellular signaling. Additional receptors, such as tyrosine kinase receptors
  (TKRs), may also be involved.Receptor activation results in receptor internalization
  via caveolin and βARK. This leads to the activation of multiple cellular pathways,
  including arachidonic acid metabolites (AA), ion channels, such as sKATP and connexin
  43 (Cx43), JAK/STAT, MAPK, tyrosine kinases such as Src and Lck, Bcl-2 family members
  such as Bcl-2 and Bax, and the PI3k pathway. The PI3k pathway is known to regulate
  PKCε, MDM2/p53, Akt, GSK3β, eNOS and the MPTP. Activation of these components leads
  to modulation of mitochondrial components such as Cx43, MPTP, mKATP and the electron
  transport chain (ETC), which modulate production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  Those components which are activated by IPC are represented by circles while the
  agents inactivated by IPC are in rectangles.
