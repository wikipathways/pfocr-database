caption: Mechanism of CAT inhibition of osteoclast differentiation. These include
  the regulatory mechanism between CAT initiating the RANKL/RANK signaling pathway
  through upstream signaling, the regulatory role between the Sirt 6/ERα/FasL signaling
  pathway and their downstream targets, inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, and
  intervening in the apoptosis process
