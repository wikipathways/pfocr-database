caption: A model for the regulation of the Hippo pathway by Vgll3 and Akap11. By binding
  to Tead transcription factors, our results suggest that Vgll3 induces expression
  of Arhgap6 (rho GTPase-activating protein 6) either directly or via other signaling
  partners. Arhgap6 inhibits RhoA (the Rho family GTPase) activity and thus causes
  actin fiber depolymerization, which further leads into Lats1/2 activation. Lats
  kinases phosphorylate the Yap/Taz complex excluding it from the nucleus and causing
  it to be degraded in the cytoplasm. In addition, PKA (protein kinase A) assisted
  by Akap11 stimulates Hippo signaling by both inducing and responding to actin depolymerization
  by activating Lats1/2 kinases either indirectly via RhoA inhibition or directly,
  respectively. Inactivation of Yap/Taz results in endothelial or epithelial cells
  to have growth arrest or apoptosis and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate
  into chondrocytes or adipocytes. Instead, when the Hippo pathway is inactivated
  by actin polymerization, Yap/Taz accumulates in the nucleus, binds Teads and induces
  gene transcription leading to cell growth, proliferation and migration, and osteocyte
  differentiation. Yap can regulate its own activation via negative feedback loop
  by upregulating at least Arhgap18 and Arghap29 which suppress RhoA activity. Based
