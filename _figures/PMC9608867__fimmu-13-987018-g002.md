caption: MicroRNA-regulated signaling pathway during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
  The Toll-like receptor (TLR)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway is activated by the
  combination of TLRs and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and impacts
  cytokine production. Abundant molecules such as TAK1 and IκB kinase (IKK) participate
  in this process. IκBα is degraded after the release of NF-κB from IKK. Overexpressed
  or downregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) target myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88),
  Toll-interleukin (IL)-1-resistance (TIR) domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β
  (TRIF), IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated
  factor (TRAF), NF-κB, suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT), and p53 to affect host immune cell response
  in tuberculosis. miR-27b is induced by NF-κB and triggers p53-dependent apoptosis
  by targeting Bcl-2 associated athanogene 2 (Bag2). ↑, upregulated; ↓, downregulated;
  ⟶, stimulate; ⟞, inhibit.
