caption: 'MHC class I antigen processing and presentation: Intracellular proteins
  are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Once tagged by ubiquitin, the
  target protein is degraded by the proteasome. The proteasome is a multimeric protein
  complex formed by the 20S catalytic core and 2 regulatory 19S particles at each
  end. Importantly, 3 of the β-subunits of the 20S core are replaced by the IFN-U
  inducible subunits, LMW protein-2, 7 and 10 (LMP2, LMP7 and LMP10), forming the
  immunoproteasome. This structure generates different antigenic peptides with high
  affinity for HLA I alleles. The immunogenic peptides are then transported into the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the transporter of antigen processing (TAP) 1/2 complex.
  With the assistance of chaperones (calnexin, tapasin, calreticulin, ERp57), the
  peptides are loaded onto the MHC class I heavy chain/β2 microglobulin complex. The
  trimeric complex then traverses through the Golgi apparatus and is incorporated
  into the cell membrane where the peptide can interact with CD8+ T cells. Defects
  anywhere along this pathway can lead to impaired presentation and CTL activation.'
