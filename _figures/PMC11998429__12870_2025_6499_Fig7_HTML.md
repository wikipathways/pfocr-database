caption: 'A: Co-expression network analysis of lncRNAs and their target genes in the
  starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. B-C: Co-expressed lncRNAs and their target
  genes involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. The upward arrow represents
  the positive regulation of DEGs by DELs, while the downward arrow represents the
  negative regulation of DEGs by DELs'
