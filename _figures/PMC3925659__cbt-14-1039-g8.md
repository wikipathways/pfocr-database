caption: 'Figure 8. MDA-7 promotes MDA-7 synthesis in Tumor A that when released into
  the vasculature can act upon distant tumor cells in Tumor B to induce more MDA-7
  that results in tumor cell death. MDA-7 as a single agent acts to suppress MCL-1
  levels and increase ROS levels that contributes to cell killing MDA-7 combined with
  HDAC inhibitors promotes: more ER stress signaling resulting in less MCL-1; more
  ROS, Ca2+, and ceramide production resulting in more mitochondrial dysfunction and
  death receptor activation; increased expression of CD95 and FAS-L resulting in more
  extrinsic pathway death signaling.'
