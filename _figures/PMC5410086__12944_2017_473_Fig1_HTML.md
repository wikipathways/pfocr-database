caption: Synthetic pathways of neutral lipids. Triglycerides (TG) are synthesized
  from one glycerol 3-phophate and three fatty acids. The monoglyceride (MG)-pathway
  is an alternative TG synthetic pathway in the small intestine, which is not detailed
  in this figure. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is formed from glycerol 3-phophate by the
  addition of two acyl chains, and it is subsequently dephosphorylated by lipin to
  form diglycerides (DG), to which diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) finally adds
  a third acyl chain to generate TG. Free cholesterol (FC) is synthesized de novo
  or from acetyl-CoA, or it is derived from extracellular lipoproteins. CE is formed
  by acylation of FC by acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). These neutral
  lipids are sources of LDs, and the TG and CE synthetic enzymes DGAT and ACAT are
  localized in the ER. Neutral lipids accumulate in LDs and they are hydrolyzed for
  ATP synthesis or steroid hormone synthesis in the mitochondria
