caption: a Method for the generation of Hoppe’s lithiated carbamate. b Method for
  the generation of α-lithiated hindered benzoate 6 with high e.r. from stannane 5.
  c Optimised protocol for iterative homologation of boronic esters. pin = pinacol.
  Carbenoid 2 was not suitable for iterative homologations whereas carbenoid 6 was
  suitable and the protocol for its successful use is shown in pane c. d Racemisation
  pathway for lithiated benzoate (S)-6 when an excess of stannane (R)-5 is present
  from the previous homologation. This example shows the ratio of products obtained
  from a mixture of lithiated benzoate (S)-6 (95%, 99.9:0.1 e.r.) and stannane (R)-5
  (5%, 99.9:0.1 e.r.) which leads to lithiated benzoate and stannane of lower e.r.
  (~95:5 e.r.).
