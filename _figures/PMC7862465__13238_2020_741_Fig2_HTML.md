caption: Glycosylation changes in TGF-β activation and SMAD-dependent pathway. (A)
  Activation of TGF-β. The mature TGF-β is noncovalently bound to the latency-associated
  peptide (LAP) and forms a latent TGF-β complex with the latent TGF-β-binding protein
  (LTBP). TGF-β can be released from the latent complex via cleavage of LAP by proteases
  digestion or integrin-dependent activation. The secreted TGF-β precursor contains
  N-linked complex type structures. (B) Canonical SMAD-dependent pathway. Receptor
  signaling starts with active TGF-β binding to the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII),
  a constitutively activated kinase, which phosphorylates the TGF-β type I (TβRI),
  both located in the plasma membrane. Then the actived TβRII/TβRI complex phosphorylates
  the SMAD2/3, which can form heteromeric complexes with SMAD4. These complexes translocate
  into nucleus where they can modulate the transcription of target genes. Both TβRII
  and TβRI can be N- and O-glycosylated. Oligomannosidic, branching structures and
  core fucosylation are important for the localization and function of receptors.
  In addition, Lewis antigens attached on TβRI are observed in cancer cells
