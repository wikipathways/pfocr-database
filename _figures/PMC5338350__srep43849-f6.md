caption: MMP1 which is secreted by MSCs binds to and cleaves the extracellular N terminus
  of PAR1 to release a tethered ligand. Upon binding to the second extracellular loop,
  the ligand activates intracellular G proteins (Gα12/13) across the membrane and
  initiates activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, including the translocation of Bax
  and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, resulting in apoptosis and growth
  suppression. Therefore, downregulation of MMP1 in MDS-MSCs leads to reduced apoptosis
  resulting in increased MDS cell proliferation.
