caption: Cysteine possible direct and indirect roles in ATP synthesis and in carbon
  metabolism reprogramming under hypoxia in ovarian cancer cells. (A) Under hypoxia,
  cysteine degradation could contribute directly to ATP production via not only H2S
  generation, but also via pyruvate and α-ketobutyrate that could further supply the
  TCA cycle, leading to increased ATP synthesis. Cysteine could also present an indirect
  role in ATP synthesis mediated by increasing GSH content under hypoxia, hence counteracting
  oxidative stress and thereby increasing cellular metabolism. Cystine can also be
  converted into cysteine persulfide (CysSSH) by CSE and CBS in the cytoplasm or by
  CSE, CBS and CARS2 in the mitochondria. (B) The axis cysteine-pyruvate-glucose is
  central in whole metabolic network of carbon. Cysteine degradation can originate
  pyruvate and glutamate. Pyruvate besides being a major supplier of tricarboxylic
  acids (TCA) cycle, it can be converted into valine, isoleucine, leucine, alanine,
  lactate, and acetate. Alanine can be a source of glucose through gluconeogenesis.
  Glycolysis produce intermediates to supply the TCA cycle (a hub for many precursors
  of organic compounds, such as threonine) and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  PPP intermediates can be converted into amino acids such as histidine and can be
  conjugated with glycolysis intermediates, originating tyrosine, phenylalanine and
  serine, which can be converted into glycine. PPP is also crucial in the nucleotide’s
  synthesis. Acetyl-CoA is a central organic compound in metabolism, when cysteine-derived
  it proves that cysteine is a valuable supplier of TCA cycle and amino acids and
  fatty acids syntheses. The increased concentration of these compounds under hypoxia,
  suggests that cysteine is pushing the metabolic flow in order to supply the main
  carbon metabolic pathways. The direct incorporation of cysteine into these compounds
  is possible, however, further studies are needed to clarify this. Based on information
  from www.bioinfo.org.cn.
