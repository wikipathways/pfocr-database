caption: 'Zn2+-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical and targetable early
  contributor to ischemic neuronal injury. During ischemia, Zn2+ accumulation in neurons
  reflects contributions from two primary sources: Zn2+ released from presynaptic
  vesicles that enters postsynaptic neurons (through Ca-AMPAR and voltage gated Ca2+
  channels [VGCC]), and Zn2+ released from MT-III (due to oxidative stress and acidosis)
  (1). This Zn2+ rapidly enters mitochondria through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter
  (MCU) (2). An early consequence of mitochondrial Zn2+ accumulation is acute reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) generation, which can further disrupt cytosolic Zn2+ buffering,
  resulting in more mitochondrial Zn2+ entry and consequent dysfunction, thereby initiating
  a feedforward Zn2+-ROS cycle. (3). In addition, Zn2+ can induce delayed activation
  of NOX, producing more ROS, and possibly further amplifying this Zn2+-ROS cycle
  (4). This protracted Zn2+ influx into mitochondria triggers mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore (mPTP) opening, leading to mitochondrial depolarization, swelling,
  and cytochrome C release (5). These Zn2+ effects on mitochondria (ROS generation
  and mPTP opening) can activate major downstream events, including direct oxidative
  damage to proteins and DNA (that can lead to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase [PARP]
  activation), activation of the apoptotic pathway via Caspase 3, and activation of
  p38 MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase, promoting the delayed insertionof Kv2.1
  K+ channels (6). Furthermore, cytosolic Zn2+, acting through incompletely defined
  mechanisms, can cause delayed insertion of Ca-AMPAR, further promoting delayed neurodegeneration
  (7). As these steps are temporally discrete, optimal therapeutic strategies will
  likely target a combination of them at different time points, as highlighted in
  timeline.'
