caption: Endogenous sources of ROS and overproduction-related consequences. The overproduction
  of superoxide anions and H2O2 by NOX enzymes and the subsequent increase in hydroxyl
  radical levels through Fenton and Haber–Weiss reactions lead to oxidation of lipids,
  proteins and DNA, and consequently promotes genomic instability, high mutation rate
  and carcinogenesis. Under these conditions, cell survival or cell death, respectively,
  depend on the activation of the PI3K or Ask-1 signaling pathways. High levels of
  ROS stimulate the Ask-1/JNK pathway, leading to cell death, while lower or transient
  levels of ROS may activate PI3K kinases and Ask-1/JNK inhibition, thus ensuring
  NF-κβ-mediated cell survival []. Inspired by [].
