caption: Schematic representation of the members of the Ang/Tie signaling pathway,
  their determining interactions in vascular diseases, and the drug candidates targeting
  each. Arrows in black demonstrate the vascular stabilizing effects induced by Ang1-induced
  Tie2 activation. Arrows in red demonstrate the destabilizing vascular effect, caused
  by Ang2 binding to Tie2 or VE-PTP interaction. Current pharmaceutical approaches
  include intracellular (razuprotafib) or extracellular (ARP-1536) VE-PTP inhibition,
  Ang2 blockade (faricimab, nesvacumab, ABTAA, LY3127804) and Tie2 activation (vasculotide,
  MAN-01, AV-001). Tie1 is also a mediator of the pathway, but not currently targeted
