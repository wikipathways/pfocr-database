caption: The DNA sensing pathway in mammals (left) and shrimp (right). The homologs
  of mammalian genes were found in shrimp, indicating that the signaling pathway is
  conserved from crustaceans to mammals. In mammals, dsDNA is recognized by DDX41,
  which induces IFN production [adapted from ref. ()]. In the present study, we showed
  that dsDNA released from a viral pathogen such as WSSV interacts with the cytosolic
  DNA sensor PmDDX41 to induce PmSTING, thereby promoting the translocation of PmIRF
  to the nucleus, resulting in the production of IFNs and antimicrobial peptides that
  eliminate the viral infection.
