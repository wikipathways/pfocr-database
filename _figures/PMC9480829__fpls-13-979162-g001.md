caption: 'Alternative pathways for the biosynthesis of strigolactones in cereals.
  (A) Biosynthetic pathway of strigolactones from all-trans-β –carotene (BCAR) to
  be catalyzed by D27 to produce 9-cis-β –carotene (CISB). Then CCD7 will catalyze
  CISB to obtain 9-cis-β –apo-10′-carotenal (CTNL), which will be further catalyzed
  to carlactone (CL) by CCD8. (B) Then we assume that MAX1 will catalyze CL to produce
  orobanchol-type (ORO) and strigol-type (STR). (C) CL is further catalyzed by MAX1
  to carlactonic acid (CLA). CLA is converted and distributed to 4-deoxyorobanchol
  (DO) by MAX1 and ORO and 5-deoxystrigol (5DS) by ABA. Then DO is further converted
  into orobanchol. The boxes represent metabolite concentration, and the arrows are
  enzyme reactions, where the substrate (beginning of the arrow) transforms into a
  product (end of the arrow). Solid arrows indicate experimentally confirmed enzymes
  involved in the catalysis. Dashed arrows indicate the maize enzyme with the highest
  homology to those catalyzing the reaction in other cereals. Model AB (AC) couples
  modules A and B (C). Parameters: influx of BCAR (k0), proportion of orobanchol-type
  (ω), turnover number (kcati), Michaelis-Menten’s constant (KMi) with respect to
  enzyme concentration i = D27, CCD7, CCD8, MAX1, ABA.'
