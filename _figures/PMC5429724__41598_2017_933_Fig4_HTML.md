caption: 'Intracellular levels of interleukins are related to circulating UCB and
  underlying molecular measures of heme catabolism. Figure 4 shows explanatory powers
  of parameters that are involved in the heme catabolic pathway for variation in inflammatory
  markers. Inflammation appears to be directly influenced by UCB on the one hand,
  and by HMOX/BLVRA genetic expressions on the other. As far as UCB was concerned,
  a further connection with markers of inflammation was found that was mainly established
  through the variables of body composition (BMI, BF). Variation in the unspecific
  inflammatory marker of CRP is merely explained by the demographic variable age as
  well as body composition. The interconnection of iron and UCB emphasizes a potential
  feedback-loop of UCB on heme catabolism. Stepwise linear regression analysis was
  performed to assess inter-variable dependence and explanatory power (%), based on
  corrected R2 values and a p-value of ≤0.05 (Supplementary Table ). CEffect valid
  for control subjects only. Abbreviations: UCB: unconjugated bilirubin; UGT1A1: UGT1A1
  genotype; IL-6/IL-1β: intracellular interleukins 6 and 1β; BLVRA expr.: genetic
  expression of biliverdin reductase; HMOX expr.: genetic expression of heme oxygenase;
  Hpt: haptoglobin; CRP: C-reactive protein; SAA: serum amyloid A.'
