caption: Pro-viral roles of autophagy during virus infection. Autophagy facilitates
  viral replication in six aspects. 1) Providing delivery vehicle. Viruses hijack
  host autophagy pathway to deliver viral particles to the replication sites. 2) Offering
  replication platform. Autophagosomes provide the scaffold and concentrate nutrients
  for viral replication, and protect the intermediates from immune detection. 3) Providing
  nutrients. Autophagy provides nutrients for viral replication. 4) Availing maturation
  and egress. Autophagy machinery facilitates in the late stage of viral lifecycle
  including capsid maturation, envelopment (if applicable), and egress. 5) Avoiding
  immune surveillance. Viruses modulate autophagy signaling by inhibiting MHC antigen
  presentation to avoid immune surveillance and create a favorable environment for
  viral survival. 6) Avoiding programmed cell death. Viruses have developed strategies
  to suppress autophagy and avoid programmed cell death. The background depicts key
  components of the autophagy pathway. The major roles played by autophagy are summarized
  in the middle, with the relevant components of each role listed close by.
