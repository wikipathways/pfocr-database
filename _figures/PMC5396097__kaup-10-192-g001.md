caption: Figure 1. Schematic diagram summarizing the regulation of autophagy in mammalian
  cells. Following stimulation by growth factors, such as IGF1, MTOR is activated,
  whereas this pathway is inhibited upon stress conditions, such as starvation. MTOR
  inhibition is required to activate the ULK complex, since MTOR is able to induce
  the phosphorylation of ATG13, leading to reduction of ULK1 activity. By sensing
  the activation of the ULK complex, the BECN1 complex is activated leading to the
  nucleation of a phagophore. By means of 2 ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, generating
  ATG12–ATG5 and LC3-II, the membrane is elongated to form a double-membraned vesicle,
  the autophagosome. Finally, the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome, forming an
  autolysosome, where the cargo is digested by lysosomal enzymes and the degraded
  material released into the cytoplasm for recycling by the cell.
