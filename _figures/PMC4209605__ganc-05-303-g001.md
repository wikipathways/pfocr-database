caption: Exposure of cells to active TGF-β leads to assembly of the tetrameric receptor
  complex, composed of two type I and two type II TGF-β receptor subunits (TGFBRI
  and TGFBRII). TGFBRII then phosphorylates TGFBRI, enabling it to activate downstream
  signaling pathways. In the canonical signaling pathway (left), TGFBRI phosphorylates
  receptor SMADs (SMAD2/3), which can then associate with SMAD4 and become translocated
  to the nucleus. The SMAD signaling complex can inhibit cell proliferation by inhibiting
  expression of MYC and increasing expression of p21CIP1 and p15INK4b. In the noncanonical
  signaling pathway (right), the activated TGF-β receptor complex regulates SMAD-independent
  pathways, including activation of Rho family members, and can stimulate cellular
  proliferation through activation of MAPK and PI3K/Akt. In triple negative breast
  cancer cell lines, expression of TMEPAI blocks canonical signaling through sequestration
  of SMAD4 and potentiates the noncanonical activation of PI3K/Akt by downregulating
  the PI3K inhibitor PTEN.
