caption: The BioPortal ontology repository. In the figure, the user is browsing the
  National Cancer Institute Thesaurus. A tree browser along the left-hand side of
  the screen allows the user to navigate the taxonomic hierarchy of the ontology.
  The visualization window on the right facilitates exploration of complex relationships—here,
  the pathway between the selected term (Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome) and its
  superclasses in the hierarchy. The menu bar above the visualization window allows
  the user to change the view to examine the details of the selected term, end-user
  notes regarding the term or its descendants, mappings between the term and related
  terms in other ontologies, or links between the selected term and the data sources
  referenced in the National Center for Biomedical Ontology Resource Index.
