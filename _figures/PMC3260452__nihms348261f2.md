caption: A simplified model of the leptin signaling pathway. Central insulin can bind
  to the same neurons as leptin and is an anorexigenic signal. The ligands leptin,
  POMC, CART, and BDNF, the receptors for leptin, melanocortins, and BDNF, and the
  enzyme PC1 have been found to have function-altering mutations associated with obesity
  in children. Mutations in the ligands and receptors for NPY, AGRP, CPE, and MCH
  have been found to cause excessive weight gain when mutated in rodents, but have
  not been as convincingly shown to be associated with human obesity. OB-Rb, the signal-transducing
  form of the leptin receptor; NPY, neuropeptide Y; AGRP, agouti-related protein;
  POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin; CART, cocaine-amphetamine related transcript; PC 1,
  prohormone convertase 1; CPE, carboxypeptidase E; MSH, melanocyte stimulating hormone;
  NPYR, neuropeptide Y receptor; MC3R, melanocortin 3 receptor; MC4R, melanocortin
  4 receptor; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; MCH, melanin concentrating hormone,
  GABA, gamma amino butyric acid; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
