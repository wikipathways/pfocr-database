caption: Crosstalk of NF-κB and ER stress. Three branches of UPR (IRE1α, PERK, and
  ATF6) of ER stress are able to intersect with NF-κB. Activated IRE1α recruits TRAF2,
  which activates JNK and then AP-1 or associates with IKK probably via NOD1/2 and
  RIP2. IRE1α is also linked with the RIDD/RIG-I/MAVS pathway and GSK3β to activate
  NF-κB. IRE1α oligomerization increases XBP-1 expression which might be associated
  with decreased NF-κB expression, but GSK3β activation inhibits IRE1α-dependent XBP-1
  splicing. PERK branch can induce NF-κB activation essentially by translation attenuation
  of the free IκBα mediated by phosphorylated eIF2α. Additionally, PERK-eIF2α could
  also contributes to inflammation via ATF4 or PI3K-Akt pathway. Both of NOD1 and
  Nrf2 could be activated by PERK and IRE1, but Nrf2 has both positive and negative
  effects on NF-κB, dependent on cellular circumstances. Through the ATF6 branch transient
  phosphorylation of Akt activates NF-κB, whereas ATF6 activation could inhibit Akt-GSK3β
  and enhance NF-κB signaling. Additionally, ER E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM13 ubiquitylates
  NEMO and prevents nuclear translocation of NF-κB. CHOP could be activated by all
  three branches of UPR, causing ROS-mediated ER stress and NF-κB inhibition or activation.
  ER stress-induced NLRP3 inflammasome is dependent on NF-κB and UPR activation. Signal
  1 of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is transcriptional upregulation of NLRP3 along
  with pro-IL-1β provided by NF-κB. Signal 2 is a posttranscriptional modification
  which can be provided by ROS. NF-κB controls the levels of ROS by regulating anti-oxidant
  and pro-oxidant genes, and ROS in turn inhibits or enhances the DNA binding activity
  of NF-κB itself, depending on modifications of NF-κB. ROS also regulates the IKK
  complex and phosphorylates IκBα. ROS produced by Nox4 transduces ER stress signals
  to the UPR to maintain homeostasis, whereas ROS produced by ERO1 or mitochondrial
  damage leads to cell death. ROS, NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome and the production of
  IL-1β and IL-18, in turn, trigger chronic ER stress.
