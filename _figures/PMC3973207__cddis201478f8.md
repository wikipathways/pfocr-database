caption: Schematic diagram showing differences in the thyroid cancer cell lines sensitive
  or resistant to apoptosis. (a) Lexatumumab induced dramatic apoptosis results in
  sensitive cell lines (TPC-1, HTh-7 and BCPAP) through activation of both intrinsic
  and extrinsic pathways. (b) 8505c cells show complete resistance to lexatumumab-induced
  apoptosis, but effective apoptosis can be triggered by removing the ‘block' to apoptosis
  by using addition of PLX4720 and LY294002, through re-activation of the intrinsic
  mitochondrial pathway
papertitle: Blocks to thyroid cancer cell apoptosis can be overcome by inhibition
  of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways.
