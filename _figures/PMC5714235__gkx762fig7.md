caption: 'Models of transcriptional regulation during zinc deficiency. (A) Diagram
  of an intestinal cell flanked by the intestinal lumen (above) and the pseudocoelom
  (below). Two dietary zinc-conditions are illustrated: deficiency (left) and excess
  (right). Zinc (black circles) enters the intestinal cell, and an undefined sensing
  mechanism causes activation of LZA element containing promoters. ZIPT proteins (blue)
  might localize to the plasma membrane or lysosome related organelles (LRO, green),
  but the subcellular localization has not been established. During zinc excess, the
  HIZR-1 nuclear receptor causes activation of HZA element containing promoters and
  the CDF-2 protein (red) localizes to the LRO where it functions to store zinc, and
  the TTM-1B protein (red) localizes to the plasma membrane where it functions to
  excrete zinc. (B) Two models of LZA element mediated transcriptional regulation.
  In the upper model, a proposed LZA element binding protein (blue box) is a transcriptional
  activator that interacts with the LZA element in response to zinc deficiency; this
  triggers assembly of a transcriptional activation complex including MDT-15 (green
  box). ELT-2 (yellow box) constitutively binds GATA elements and is permissive for
  intestinal cell expression. Stimulation is shown by an arrow and thick transcription
  start site. In the lower model, the LZA-element binding protein is a transcriptional
  repressor that interacts with the LZA element during zinc-replete conditions. Repression
  is shown by a bar and thin transcription start site; zinc deficiency abrogates the
  binding interaction, allowing assembly of a transcriptional activation complex.
  These two models are not mutually exclusive, since the LZA element binding protein
  might be converted from a repressor in zinc-replete conditions to an activator in
  zinc-deficient conditions.'
