caption: Simplified schematic of signaling pathways driving resistance to BRAF inhibitors.
  In BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cells (left), BRAF inhibition causes growth arrest
  and apoptosis by blocking the MAPK pathway. These BRAF-inhibitor (BRAFi-) sensitive
  cells are highly dependent on BRAF for MAPK activation and survival. Following chronic
  BRAF inhibition, resistant cells (right) evolve an array of compensatory mechanisms,
  including RAF isoform switching, activation of RTKs such as IGF-1R, and engagement
  of the PI3K pathway to promote cell survival. PTEN loss leads to activation of the
  PI3K pathway. Understanding the signaling networks that drive drug resistance will
  enable the development of rational drug combinations to target melanomas refractory
  to BRAF inhibitors. Also shown are inhibitors that can be used to block the compensatory
  pathways identified so far.
