caption: MiRNAs regulate the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. (a)  miR-146 b
  overexpression inhibits the proliferation and migration of VSMCs via  the downregulation
  of Bag 1 and matrix metalloproteinase-16 (MMP-16). (b) miR-637  inhibits proliferation
  and migration of VSMCs by regulating insulin-like growth  factor-2 (IGF2). (c) miR-141-3
  p inhibits proliferation and migration of VSMCs by  regulating the Keap1/Nrf 2/HO-1
  pathway. (d) Downregulation of miR-186-5p  inhibits the proliferation and migration
  of VSMCs. (e) SENCR influence the  proliferation and migration of VSMCs by regulating
  the miR-4731-5 p/forkhead box  O (FOXO) 3a pathway. (f) Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein
  A1 (hnRNPA1)  targets the regulation of IQ motif-containing guanosine triphosphate
  (GTP)ase  activating protein 1 (IQGAP 1) to reduce VSMC proliferation and migration
  via the  upregulation of miR-124 expression. (g) SNHG12 targets the  miR-199a-5p/HIF-1α
  axis to promote the proliferation and migration of  VSMCs. (h) Platelet-derived
  growth factor (PDGF)-BB induces miR-448 expression,  which in turn targets myocyte-specific
  enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), acting on VSMC  proliferation and migration. (i) H19
  inhibits miR-148b expression and thus  activates the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway
  to promote proliferation  and migration of VSMCs. (j) Circular mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (circMAPK  1) regulates miR-22-3p/Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 axis
  to promote the  proliferation and migration of VSMCs. Created by Figdraw
