caption: Part of Pancreatic cancer pathway adapted from KEGG showing the gene-gene
  interactions. → implies activation and ⊣ implies inhibition. The rectangles with
  solid line represent valid genes mapped to the pathway. They are referred to by
  the name of the genes. +p denotes phosphorylation. For example, PKB/Akt activates
  IKK through phosphorylation. IKK in turn activates NFkB. Thus, PKB/Akt indirectly
  activates NFkB. The rectangles with dotted lines are genetic sequence that do not
  have Entrez Gene ID and not mappable to pathway. We cannot yet associate them to
  some pathway. We denote them as unresolved genes. They are referred to by GenBank
  Accession numbers.
