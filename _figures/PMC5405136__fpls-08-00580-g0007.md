caption: Construction of regulatory network associated with genes up-regulated under
  WD. Using Rice Interaction Viewer and Cytoscape tools, we queried predicted protein–protein
  interaction network associated with functionally characterized genes, kinase, transcription
  factors, and transporters, and identified 10 functionally characterized genes (red
  lettering in large circle/nodes), 12 TFs (large brown circles/nodes), 4 kinases
  (large yellow circles/nodes), and 3 transporters (large sky-blue circles/nodes)
  in network. Furthermore, 32 elements (small circles) interact with upregulated genes
  under WD (large circles); 20 elements interacting with multiple upregulated genes
  are indicated by medium-sized nodes and thick lines. Detailed information about
  values in round brackets of nodes is presented in Table .
