caption: In the left panel, a normal meniscus without abnormal neovascularization
  was observed, exhibiting well-aligned fibers and optimal biomechanical properties.
  Most of the ATF4 protein in meniscal cells is degraded via the ubiquitination pathway,
  and there is no significant mTOR activation. The right panel shows that meniscal
  vessels introduce a significant amount of AGEs with increasing age or glucose levels,
  which promotes neoangiogenesis and osteogenic differentiation of meniscal cells.
  AGEs and RAGE activate the ATF4-mTOR positive feedback loop, where mTOR inhibits
  the degradation of ATF4 by decreasing its ubiquitination. Simultaneously, ATF4 activated
  mTOR by elevating arginine uptake, eventually leading to calcification of the meniscus
  and impairment of its biomechanical properties. The schematic was constructed using
