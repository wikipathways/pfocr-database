caption: Oxidative pathways of alcohol metabolism. Alcohol is metabolized mainly in
  the cytosol by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to produce acetaldehyde. At high levels
  of alcohol consumption, an enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum, cytochrome P450
  IIE1 (CYP2E1), becomes involved in metabolizing alcohol to acetaldehyde; this enzyme
  also is induced by chronic drinking. A catalase-mediated reaction in the peroxisomes
  is considered a minor metabolic pathway of alcohol metabolism. Acetaldehyde is further
  metabolized to acetate in the mitochondria. Alcohol metabolism results in the formation
  of NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and thus changes the redox state
  of hepatocytes (i.e., increases the ratio of NADH/NAD + ). Both alcohol metabolism
  by CYP2E1 and the re-oxidation of NADH via the electron transport chain in the mitochondria
  results in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). NAD + , nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide. (Reproduced with permission of Zakhari 2 ).
