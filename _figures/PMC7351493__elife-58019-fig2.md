caption: Gene families implicated in the pathway (propionyl-synthetases, fatty acid
  synthases FAS, elongases, desaturases, fatty acid reductases and decarbonylases)
  are depicted in blue boxes. The chemical structure of the two precursor molecules
  of the pathway (Acetyl-CoA and Propionyl-CoA) is shown, as well as the chemical
  structure of the product of each step of the pathway. Candidate genes for each step
  of the pathway, with enriched expression in An. gambiae oenocytes, are listed on
  the left. Genes with an asterisk are members of the Cyp4G16 correlation network
  (). *Note that the epicuticle forms a much thinner layer compared to the procuticle
  and that its thickness has been enlarged in the image to show the presence of the
  CHCs.
