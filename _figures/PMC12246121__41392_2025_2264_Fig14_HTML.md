caption: The role of PRR in ageing. a Stimulation of TLR5 by a flagellin-fused protein
  has been shown to effectively extend the lifespan and enhance the health span of
  mice of both genders. This effect is mediated by an increased surface expression
  of TLR5 and a subsequent elevation in IL-22 secretion. Additionally, aging diminishes
  TLR activation by agonists, leading to decreased production of inflammatory cytokines.
  b Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lacking IRF8 do not respond to CpG, an agonist
  of TLR9 in mice. In contrast, continuous CpG stimulation not only increases the
  number of wild-type HSCs but also reduces their ability to form bone marrow colonies
  in ageing mice. c Extracellular HMGB1 stimulates the release of inflammatory cytokines
  through the TLR2/4 and NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby enhancing the production
  of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Blocking TLR2 and TLR4
  can alleviate cellular aging and mitigate age-related diseases. d Inhibiting IFN-I
  response mediated by cGAS activation mitigates aging-associated cognitive decline
  and dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) models. This figure is created
