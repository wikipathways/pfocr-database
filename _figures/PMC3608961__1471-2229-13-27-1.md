caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathway from L-Phe to diarylheptanoids and gingerol-related
  compounds in ginger and turmeric. Enzymes are as follows: PAL = phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; C4H = cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL = 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CST = p-coumaroyl
  shikimate transferase; C3´H = p-coumaroyl 5-O-shikimate 3´-hydroxylase; OMT = O-methyltransferase;
  CCOMT = caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; SAMS = S-adenosylmethionine synthetase;
  SAHC = S-adenosylhomocysteine. All conversions have been demonstrated in other species,
  except for those catalyzed by the polyketide synthases, the reductases, and the
  hydroxylases and OMTs that would convert bisdemethoxycurcumin via demethoxycurcumin
  to curcumin (indicated by dashed arrows). The polyketide synthases indicated represent
  two distinct classes that work in tandem: diketide synthases and curcuminoid/gingerol
  synthases. Different combinations of these two classes appear to be responsible
  for production of different compounds in these plants. The large red X and the solid
  arrows associated with the DKS1 + CURS reactions indicate that formation of curcumin
  has been demonstrated to proceed directly from feruloyl-CoA, and not through the
  orthodiol intermediate B. Compounds A and B, therefore, are not likely to be intermediates
  in the pathway to curcumin but instead are likely to be products of a different
  pair of PKS enzymes.'
