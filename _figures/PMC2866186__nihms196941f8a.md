caption: Proposed PLP-dependent catalytic mechanism of ORF34. (A) Mechanism for ALA
  synthesis. In the substrate-free state, PLP is bound by enzyme (internal aldimine).
  The incoming glycine induces transaldimination, leading to the PLP=Gly adduct (external
  aldimine). The electrophilic substrate succinyl-CoA is attacked by the PLP-activated
  glycine, leading to C-C bond formation with the release of CoASH. Decarboxylation
  and reprotonation result in formation of the PLP=ALA adduct that is finally released
  to regenerate the internal aldimine. (B) Mechanism for C5N synthesis. ALA-CoA induces
  transaldimination, yielding the ALA-CoA=PLP complex. The thioester carbonyl in ALA-CoA
  is then attacked by the PLP-activated ALA moiety intramolecularly, leading to C-C
  bond formation with the release of CoASH. The PLP=C5N complex is finally released
  to regenerate internal aldimine. (C) Three-dimensional structural model of the ORF34
  active site. The structure was modeled on the R. capsulatus ALAS using the online
  program HHpred, and the substrates were docked using the software GOLD.
