caption: 'Symbiosis mechanism between fungi and plants. (A) Fungi secrete bioactive
  signals such as Mycorrhizal factor (Myc factor) and plants secrete signaling factors
  such as strigolactone (SLs), flavonoids, which activate the common symbiotic signaling
  pathway (CSSP) in the host plant. (B) Hyphae infects plant cells. (C) Nutrient exchange
  between plants and fungi and related genes（TcAMT2: ammonium transporter; TcGS1:
  glutamine synthetase; TcAAT: amino acid transporter; GID1: gibberellin receptor;
  SvAMT1: ammonium transporter; tps: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; NuBP: nucleotide-binding
  protein; DELLA, GA20ox: genes about the biosynthesis of gibberellin; CCaMK: calcium-and
  calmodulin-dependent protein kinase)'
