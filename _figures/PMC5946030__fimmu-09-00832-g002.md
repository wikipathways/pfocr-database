caption: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mediates a pro-inflammatory response by interacting
  with TLR9, cytosolic inflammasomes, and type I interferon response. Tissue injury
  or cellular damage can cause mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in oxidative damage
  with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mtDNA
  oxidation. Oxidized mtDNA will be released into the cytosol and then to the extracellular
  milieu by various mechanisms including the transport in mitochondrial derived vesicles
  (MVDs) or through mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPT). The whole damaged
  mitochondria can also be recycled through the mitophagy process. In the plasma,
  mtDNA activates TLR9-mediated signaling pathway in circulating neutrophils resulting
  in increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and adhesion molecules. Cytosolic mtDNA can also engage
  and activate the NOD, leucine-rich repeats, and pyrin domain-containing protein
  3 (NLRP3) inflammasome or absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome and trigger a pro-inflammatory
  response in cells primed with first signal in inflammasome activation through the
  nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway. Finally, cytosolic mtDNA can also be recognized
  by and engage the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). Once activated cGAS triggers conformational
  changes of the endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein stimulator of interferon genes
  (STING), which engages TANK-binding kinase 1 to activate interferon regulatory factor
  3 (IRF3) and/or IRF7 to stimulate transcription of type I interferons (IFNs) genes.
