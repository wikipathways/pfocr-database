caption: Plausible lipstatin biosynthetic pathway in S. toxytricini. Octanoic acid
  may be activated by LstC (an acyl-CoA synthetase homologue), the acyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACCase) complex (), and ACP borrowed from primary metabolism. Two FabH homologues,
  LstA and LstB, may conduct Claisen condensation between 3-hydroxytetradeca-5,8-dienoyl-CoA
  and hexylmalonyl-ACP, affording the 22-carbon α-branched fatty acid backbone (compound
  6) (). LstE (NRPS) and LstF (a formyltransferase homologue) are responsible for
  the attachments of leucine and formyl groups. LstD (a 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase
  homologue) is involved in the reduction of the 3-keto group of compound 7. The β-lactone
  ring may be formed spontaneously by attack of the 3-hydroxy group on the carbonyl
  of the ACP-tether acyl intermediate, in analogy with the ebelactone biosynthesis
  pathway (). SCoA, CoA thioester; C#, condensation-like domain; A, adenylation domain;
  T, thiolation domain or PCP domain. Compound 4 is accumulated by both the ΔlstE
  and ΔlstF::aadA mutants. Compound 5 is accumulated by the ΔlstD mutant (see the
  text for more explanation).
