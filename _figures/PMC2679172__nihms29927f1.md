caption: The killing of E. hitolytica trophozoites by macrophages is mainly mediated
  by nitric oxide, derived from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO could
  inhibit amebic cysteine proteinases (CP) and alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH2), the
  critical enzymes conferring virulence of E. histolytica. The arginase activity was
  detected in E. histolytica, which putatively converts L-arginine into L-ornithine,
  in turn limiting NO production by macrophage NOS. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an
  immunoregulatory molecule produced by cyclooxygenase (COX) in ameba or ameba-exposed
  macrophages. By activating cAMP-PKA pathway, PGE2 suppress macrophage effector functions
  by inhibiting PKC-mediated MHC-II expression and TNF-α production, while favoring
  IL-10 production. Monocyte Locomotion Inhibitory Factor (MLIF) produced by ameba
  may suppress macrophage functions in a manner similar to PGE2. Amebic lipophosphoglycan
  (LPG) might downregulate TLR2 expression on macrophages, thus control the effector
  mechanisms triggered through TLR2 signaling.
