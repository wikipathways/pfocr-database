caption: The classical pathway (solid gray arrow) involves the conversion of C21 precursors
  (pregnenolone and progesterone) to the C19 adrenal androgens DHEA and androstenedione
  (AED) by the hydroxylase and lyase activity of CYP17A1. Adrenal androgens present
  in the circulation (including the sulfated form of DHEA, DHEA-S), enter the prostate
  gland and may be converted to testosterone through a cascade of enzymatic steps
  modulated by the HSD3B, HSD17B and AKR1C enzymes. Testosterone is subsequently reduced
  to the potent androgen DHT by members of the SRD5A family. The ‘backdoor’ pathway
  to DHT formation (short gray arrows) involves the enzymatic conversion of C21 precursors
  by SRD5A and the reductive 3a-HSD activity of AKR1C family members, with the subsequent
  metabolism to C19 androgens via the CYP17A lyase activity, followed by conversion
  to DHT through interactions with HSD17B3 and an oxidative 3a-HSD enzyme.
