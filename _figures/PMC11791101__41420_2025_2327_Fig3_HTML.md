caption: 'A Paracrine Signaling: Stroma cells release HH ligands (SHH, IHH, DHH),
  which bind to the Ptch1 receptor on the cancer cell. This binding inhibits Ptch1,
  allowing Smo to become active. Active Smo leads to the activation of Gli transcription
  factors (Gli-A), which then translocate into the nucleus to promote the transcription
  of target genes. B Reverse Paracrine Signaling: Cancer cells release HH ligands
  (SHH, IHH, DHH), which bind to the Ptch1 receptor on the stroma cell. This binding
  inhibits Ptch1, allowing Smo to become active in the stroma cell. Active Smo then
  leads to the activation of Gli transcription factors (Gli-A), which then translocate
  into the nucleus to promote the transcription of target genes. Created with BioRender.com'
