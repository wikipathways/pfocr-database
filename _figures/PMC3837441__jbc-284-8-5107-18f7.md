caption: Model for the Cdc42-dependent regulation of neural differentiation in P19
  cells. RA induces the expression of members of the FGF and Delta families of ligands,
  as well as possibly additional proteins (X), resulting in the activation of Cdc42.
  This gives rise to the activation of mTOR and the up-regulation of the expression
  levels of Hes5 and Pax6 (see details in text).
