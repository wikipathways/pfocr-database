caption: Deregulation of MCU and MCUR1-involved mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in tumorigenesis
  and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Scheme of key actors involved in the
  retrograde signalling pathway from mitochondria to nucleus that promote HCC tumorigenesis.
  The increase in MCU-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ results in the overproduction of
  mitochondrial ROS. This, in turn, inhibits NAD+/SIRT3/SOD2 pathway and stimulates
  the activation of ROS/JNK pathway that promotes HCC migration and invasion. Overexpression
  of MCRU1 exhibits the same effect on ROS production but inactivates P53 via ROS/Akt/MDM2
  pathway, promoting HCC proliferation and evading apoptosis (a cell death mechanism)
  by modifying transcriptional profiles of BAX, Bcl-2, p21, cyclin D1, and cyclin
  E. The activation of Snail-related EMT and ROS/Nrf2/Notch signalling pathway was
  also observed in MCUR1 overexpressed HCC, thus inducing metastasis by transcriptionally
  upregulating N-cadherin and vimentin, and downregulating ZO-1 and E-cadherin. Figure
