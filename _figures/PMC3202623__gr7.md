caption: The Potential Roles of Fumarate as an OncometaboliteThe KEAP1 protein is
  part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which under normal physiological conditions targets
  NRF2 for polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation (). Critical cysteine residues
  in KEAP1 are modified by fumarate via succination. We propose that succination impairs
  the ability of KEAP1 to negatively regulate NRF2, thus facilitating transcription
  of genes that contain an ARE () in the promoter region.
