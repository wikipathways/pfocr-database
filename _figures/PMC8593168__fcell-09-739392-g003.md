caption: The role of lactate metabolism in ferroptosis within the TME. Lactic acid
  is mainly derived from tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the
  tumor microenvironment. High concentration of lactic acid forms an acidic environment
  with pH 5.5–6.6 in the TME. Cancer cells secrete lactic acid to nourish Treg cells
  to protect the tumor from immune attack. Lactic acid can also induce the formation
  of mono-unsaturated fatty acids through the HCAR1/MCT1-SREBP1-SCD1 pathway, which
  contributes to the resistance of liver cancer cells to ferroptosis induced by oxidative
  stress. HCAR1, hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1; MCT1, monocarboxylate transporter-1;
  SREBP1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1.
