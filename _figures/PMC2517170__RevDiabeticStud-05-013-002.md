caption: 'Ceramide, a second messenger in the sphngomyelin signaling pathway, is generated
  during hydrolysis of sphigomyelin or de novo synthesis from serine and palmitoyl-CoA.
  Ceramide might be deacylated to form sphingosine and fatty acid, phosphorylated
  to form C1P or glycosylated to form glucosylceramide. SPT: serine palmitoyltransferase.
  C1P: ceramide-1-phosphate. S1p: sphingosine-1-phos-phate.'
