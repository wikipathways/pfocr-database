caption: Sevoflurane modulating microglia and peripheral factors involved in neuroinflammation.
  Sevoflurane induced Tau transfer from the neurons to the microglia, thereby activating
  it to produce neurotoxic inflammatory molecules and cytokines, such as IL-1β and
  TNF-α; later, Tau can be phagocytized and secreted extracellularly and transmitted
  into the neuron again; sevoflurane induced microglia polarized into M1 activation
  via the NF-κB signaling pathway and inhibited its M2 activation by mediating SOCS1,
  SOCS3, and STAT6; sevoflurane induced macrophage inflammation, as shown by IL-1α,
  IL-1β, MIP-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α increases; sevoflurane flattened the endothelial
  cell luminal surface and enlarged its perivascular spaces; and cytokines (IL-1β,
  IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-6) induced depression and redistribution of BBB adherens junction
  proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and vinculin); sevoflurane increased RAGE and decreased
  IRP-1 expressions; sevoflurane decreased intestinal microbiome abundance and diversity.
