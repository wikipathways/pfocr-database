caption: Schematic model for IBDV internalization and establishment of the endosome-associated
  replication niche. Employing the cellular receptor complex composed by Hsp90 and
  α4β1 integrin (, ), IBDV particles hijack the macropinocytic pathway from the host
  cells to be internalized () and then traffic to early endocytic structures in a
  Rab5-dependent manner. There the particles profit from the endosomal acidification
  and the subsequent low Ca2+ concentration to promote the uncoating of viral capsid
  and the exposure of one of the capsid-associated peptides, PEP46, which is able
  to deform biological membranes, leading to the formation of pores on the endosomal
  membrane (). Our proposed model shows that after internalization, while disassembled
  viral capsids of IBDV internalized particles reach late endocytic compartments for
  degradation, IBDV RNPs would be extruded from the pierced endosomes and associate
  with membrane phosphoinositides on the cytosolic face of naive early endosomes,
  through the VP3 PATCH 2 region, assembling patches all along the endosome membrane.
  Afterwards, the RNPs, associated with the endosomal compartments, traffic along
  the microtubules to reach the perinuclear region, establishing physical contact
  with the Golgi complex, where the viral replication occurs ().
