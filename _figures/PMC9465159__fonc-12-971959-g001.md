caption: Druggable targets of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway currently tested
  in clinical trials. Radiotherapy induces DNA damage and cell death. Nucleic acid
  sensing pathways detect cytoplasmic DNA and RNA to stimulate downstream pathways.
  Cytoplasmic DNA activates the Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) to produce cyclic GMP–AMP
  (cGAMP) that activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, leading
  to type I interferon (IFN) production. Radiotherapy-induced type I interferon (IFN)
  can induce RNA sensor activation through RNA polymerase III conversion of DNA to
  double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), radiotherapy-induced small non-coding RNA (sncRNA)
  or STAT1-induced dsRNA synthesis from endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs). These
  activate (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), melanoma differentiation-associated protein
  5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), which also drives pro-inflammatory
  signalling through type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) can recognise damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of single-stranded
  RNA (ssRNA), dsRNA or unmethylated CpG DNA in intracellular compartments such as
  endosomes, to lead to activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPKs) and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). DNA damage repair
  mechanisms of single- (SSB) and double-strand breaks (DSB) are often upregulated
  by cancer cells to avoid cell cycle arrest or death. Inhibitors of DNA damage repair
  components, such as ataxia telangiectasia- mutated (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia
  and Rad3-related protein (ATR), DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit
  (DNA-PKcs), poly(ADP- ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and Wee1 (Wee1-like protein
  kinase) function to propel the cell through the cell cycle, despite the presence
  of unrepaired damage, leading to accumulation of cytosolic DNA. This leads to cross-talk
  with the nucleic acid sensing pathway via activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and
  dsRNA stress pathway via promotion of ERV expression. These two pathways, through
  positive and negative cross-talk, shape the radiotherapy-induced DDR response that
  feeds into anti-tumour immune effects, including recruitment of tumour-infiltrating
  CD8+ T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells and CD11b+ innate immune cells, such as
  macrophages and neutrophils. Maturation and activation of dendritic cells (DCs)
  is increased, including DC cross-presentation of tumour-associated antigens to naive
  T-cells, which can become activated leading to T-cell-mediated cytotoxic-killing
  of cancer cells. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive effects of myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-cells (Tregs) can be reversed and macrophages can
  be repolarised from M2 to an M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype. Chk, checkpoint kinase;
