caption: 'Schematic representation of the AET pathways associated with alternative
  electron carriers expressed in plants. Inactivation of the photosynthetic machinery
  caused by environmental constraints such as drought results in an overproduction
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decline of ferredoxin (Fd), the final acceptor
  of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which in turn negatively affects
  the reduction of thioredoxin (Trx) by Fd-Trx reductase (FTR). This system participates
  in the redox modulation of components of the Calvin–Benson cycle, starch biosynthesis,
  the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP), and other metabolic routes. Flavodoxin
  (Fld) compensates for the loss of stress-sensitive Fd and maintains electron flow
  to productive routes of the chloroplast, resulting in improved metabolic activity
  and plant development. In contrast to Fld, flavodi-iron (Flv) proteins act as electron
  sinks by capturing the excess of electrons and transferring them to oxygen to produce
  water without the formation of ROS. Cytochrome c6 (cyt c6) participates in the intersystem
  electron shuttle. Improved electron flow through photosynthesis and other redox
  pathways enables plants to maintain the energy balance via a higher provision of
  redox equivalents and to improve their overall metabolic response, allowing them
  to survive multiple stress conditions that exert oxidative damage. cyt b6f: cytochrome
