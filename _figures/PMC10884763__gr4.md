caption: Schematic diagram of WATME-specific immunotherapy for obesity-induced type
  2 diabetes (T2D). Inflammation in obese WATME plays a crucial role in the development
  of insulin resistance which leads to the development of obesity-induced T2D. These
  are mediated by the inflammatory signaling pathways, enzymes, and senescent cells.
  Several WATME-specific immunotherapies targeting those have been discovered. Some
  examples of these WATME-specific immunotherapies are Sulforaphane, Formononetin,
  SZ-A, coffee silver skin and husk
