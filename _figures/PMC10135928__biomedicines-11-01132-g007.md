caption: 'Lipid synthesis in adipocyte differentiation and functions. (A): The differentiation
  of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into adipocytes begins with the first stage of
  fate determination, in which the cell commits to an adipocyte fate. Subsequently,
  the early stage of differentiation is accompanied by morphological and functional
  alterations and requires a basal level of lipogenesis. Lipid synthesis is required
  for the hypertrophic growth of adipocytes and adipocyte functions but is dispensable
  in the maintenance of adipocyte identity. (B): The lipid synthesis pathway and adipocyte
  functions. Abbreviations: ACC1/2, acetyl CoA carboxylase1/2; AT, Adipose tissue;
  C/EBPα, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α; C/EBPβ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein
