caption: 'Schematic model depicting the different overlapping phases of KSHV entry
  and infection in endothelial (HMVEC-d) target cell. KSHV infection is initiated
  by binding to the cell surface proteoglycan heparan sulfate [HS; Stage 1: binding;
  inset electron microscopic, (EM) picture], followed by subsequent temporal associations
  with integrins (α3β1, αVβ3, αVβ5) and xCT molecules in the non-lipid raft (NLR)
  parts of the membranes. KSHV’s interactions with integrins activate FAK at tyrosine
  397, which creates a binding site for the SH2 domain containing Src family kinases,
  subsequently leading to the activation of PI3-K and Rho-GTPases (Stage 2: signal
  induction). These rapid overlapping host cell signal induction play roles in actin
  modulation, formation of endocytic vesicles, and virus entry and trafficking through
  the cytosol leading into a productive infection (Blue arrows). KSHV infection induces
  the phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the phosphorylated c-Cbl forms a complex with p85-PI3-K,
  leading into the interaction of c-Cbl with downstream molecules. c-Cbl mediates
  a rapid selective translocations of KSHV into the lipid rafts (LRs) along with the
  α3β1, αVβ3, and xCT receptors. KSHV-associated αVβ5 remains in the NLR parts of
  the membranes. Activated c-Cbl localizes with LRs, associates with myosin IIA and
  actin, and is rapidly recruited to membrane blebs. This also leads into c-Cbl mediated
  ubiquitination of actin and myosin. c-Cbl mediated monoubiquitination of translocated
  receptors is followed by productive macropinocytic entry. Myosin IIA interactions
  with actin may be providing the ATP-dependent force to generate actomyosin contraction,
  bleb retraction to form macropinosomes along with KSHV (Stage 3: internalization;
  inset EM picture). NLR associated KSHV bound αVβ5 and other receptors are polyubiquitinated
  and directed to a clathrin-dependant lysosomal non-productive pathway. RhoA activates
  Dia-2 aiding in formation and movement of endosomes through the cytoplasm. KSHV
  capsid is released from the endocytic vesicles by fusion of viral envelope with
  endosomal vesicles (Stage 3: internalization; inset EM picture). Released capsids
  are transported toward the nucleus utilizing a Rho-GTPase dependant pathway that
  involves acetylation of microtubules (MT; Stage 4: movement in cytoplasm). KSHV
  capsid disassembly at or near the nuclear pore results in the delivery of KSHV DNA
  into the infected cell nucleus (Stage 5: nuclear delivery) followed by viral and
  host gene expression (Stage 6) initiated by KSHV binding and entry induced ERK and
  NF-κB pathways. All these events demonstrate that KSHV has evolved to utilize its
  interactions with cellular receptors to manipulate host cell signaling and to induce
  an environment that is conducive for a productive infection.'
