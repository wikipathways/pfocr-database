caption: '(A) Schematic diagram of the ibrutinib-induced cardiotoxicities. Ibrutinib
  is associated with several cardiotoxicities: atrial arrhythmias, mainly atrial fibrillation;
  ventricular arrhythmias. Serious ventricular tachycardia may cause sudden death.
  Myocardial fibrosis and injury are also reported in the clinical trials and research
  studies. (B) Schematic diagram of the mechanism of ibrutinib-induced cardiotoxicity.
  Both on- and off- target effects are involved in the ibrutinib-induced cardiotoxicities.
  Ibrutinib present and atrial-specific pro-arrhythmic effect. Ion transient disturbance
  was noticed in the chamber-specific toxicity. Low inhibitory effect of ibrutinib
  on target kinase is considered be another on- target effect, but clear evidence
  is still needed to address the issue. PI3K- and CSK- related signaling pathway inhibition
  are linked to ibrutinib-induced cardiotoxicity in an off-target aspect. Macrophages
  are also hypothesized to participate in the cardiotoxicity. Created with BioRender.com.'
