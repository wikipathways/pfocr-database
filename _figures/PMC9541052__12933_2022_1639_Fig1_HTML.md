  mechanism. In normal condition, nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) secreted
  from endothelial cells inhibit platelets, keeping them inactive and preventing them
  from binding to the endothelial lining. Platelet coagulation factors are also inactivated
  by antithrombin III (ATIII), a protein bound to endothelial cells by a glycose immune
  glycan (heparin sulfate) and activated protein C (APC) in association with protein
  S. ATIII cleaves circulating clotting factors (F-II, F-IX, F-X) and inactivates
  them. Protein C is activated by thrombin (F-II) bound to thrombomodulin (TM) in
  the endothelial cells. APCs cleaves circulating clotting factors (F-V, F-VIII) and
  inactivate themB.Platelet activation and aggregation. In response to damage to endothelial
  cells, circulating platelets migrate to the site of injury and bind to a protein,
  Von Willebrand factor (vWF), produced by endothelial cells through another platelet-surface
  protein glycoprotein 1b (GP1b) that activates the platelets. Activated platelets
  release granules containing adenosine di-phosphate (ADP) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2)
  which bind to their respective receptors expressed in platelets, allowing more platelets
  to migrate and form clusters at the site of injury, a process called ‘platelet aggregation’
  through which ‘platelet-plaque’ is formed at the injury site. Platelet activation
  also allows the membrane translocation of CD40 ligand (CD40LG). The translocation
  of CD40LG seems to coincide with the release α-granule contents, including platelet-derived
  growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and platelet factor
  4 (PF4). The surface-expressed CD40LG is cleaved and shed from the platelet surface
  in a time-dependent manner as sCD40LG. Platelet-endothelial interactions also promote
  progressive plaque, and this interaction is facilitated by rolling and adhering
  of activated platelets to the endothelial cell surface. Rolling of platelets to
  endothelial cells is mediated by platelet P-selectin glycoprotein ligand − 1 (PSGL-1)
  binding to endothelial cell P-selectinC. Fibrinolytic system. The final step of
  the blood homeostasis system involves the natural breakdown of the blood clot (platelet-fibrin
  plaque). Endothelial cells express a protein tissue plasminogen activator (TPA),
  which converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin degrades the fibrin mesh in the platelet-fibrin
  plaque and releases fibrinogen and D-dimer. TPA is inhibited by an endothelial plasminogen
  activator inhibitor called plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).D. Cascade
  pathways of blood coagulation system. The platelet surfaces in the platelet-fibrin
  clot (shown separately with broken, red-dotted lines) contain the phosphatidyl serine
  groups which are negatively charged. Coagulation factor XII, secreted from the liver,
  binds to the negatively charged surface and this contact triggers a conformational
  change in the XII zymogen, inducing autoactivation (contact activation). The activation
  leads the cascade pathway activation of XI, IX, VIII (intrinsic pathway). Tissue
  damage activates coagulation factors III and VII (extrinsic pathway) and, finally,
  both pathways activate factor X (common pathway) which leads to the conversion of
  prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin converts fibrin polymer (insoluble) from fibrinogen
  monomers (soluble) and, with the help of XIII, fibrin finally forms a fibrin mesh
  to coagulate blood (with aggregated platelets at the site of injury)E. Comparison
  of % change of platelet activation-related proteins in type 2 diabetes. The table
  shows the % change of platelet activation-related proteins in response to mild and
  deep hypoglycemia in control subjects (C) and in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
