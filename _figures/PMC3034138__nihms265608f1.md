caption: Multivariate-modular approach for isoprenoid pathway optimization. To increase
  the flux through the upstream MEP pathway, we targeted reported enzymatic bottlenecks
  (dxs, idi, ispD, and ispF) (gray) for over-expression by an operon (dxs-idi-ispDF)
  (). To channel the overflow flux from the universal isoprenoid precursors, IPP and
  DMAPP, toward Taxol biosynthesis, we constructed a synthetic operon of downstream
  genes GGPP synthase (G) and taxadiene synthase (T) (). Both pathways were placed
  under the control of inducible promoters in order to control their relative gene
  expression. In the E. coli metabolic network, the MEP isoprenoid pathway is initiated
  by the condensation of the precursors glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate (G3P) and pyruvate
  (PYR) from glycolysis. The Taxol pathway bifurcation starts from the universal isoprenoid
  precursors IPP and DMAPP to form geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and then the taxadiene.
  The cyclic olefin taxadiene undergoes multiple rounds of stereospecific oxidations,
  acylations, and benzoylation to form the late intermediate Baccatin III and side
  chain assembly to, ultimately, form Taxol.
