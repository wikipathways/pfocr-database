caption: A model for persistent and injury- or degeneration-induced neurogenesis in
  the zebrafish central retina. In a wild type, uninjured retina, slowly dividing
  stem cells in the INL (orange), which are derived from a subset of neurogenic M端ller
  glia, give rise to committed rod progenitor cells that express Nr2e3 (green, pathway
  A). The INL progenitors migrate to the ONL where they are further amplified as rod
  progenitor cells (purple) and differentiate into mature rods (red). In response
  to rod photoreceptor degeneration alone, the rod progenitors of pathway A increase
  their proliferation in the absence of proliferation in the INL. In response to degeneration
  of the cone photoreceptors, damage to both rods and cones, or death of other inner
  retinal neurons, M端ller glia re-enter the cell cycle to produce neurogenic clusters
  (green, pathway B) in the INL that migrate to the correct laminar position and differentiate
  into multiple retinal cell types (red).
