caption: Cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways with special reference to aspirin
  exacerbated respiratory disease. Simplified pictogram of biosynthetic pathways of
  prostaglandin (PG) E2 and cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs). Arachidonic acid (AA)
  is metabolized by the cyclooxygenase (COX) or 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathways. COX
  enzymes generate PGH2 which through PGE2 synthase is converted into PGE2. PGE2 couples
  to four subtypes of G-protein-coupled membrane receptors denominated E-prostanoid
  (EP) receptors. The activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors generates cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP). This mediator negatively regulates the 5-LO pathway by activating
  protein kinase A (PKA). AA is also metabolized by the 5-LO pathway to generate leukotriene
  (LT) A4. LTA4 is subsequently metabolized by LTC4 synthase, which conjugates reduced
  glutathione into LTC4. LTC4 is metabolized into LTD4, which is then metabolized
  into LTE4. LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 are designated as CysLTs. CysLTs bind to CysLT1,
  CysLT2 and GPR17 receptors. In aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) the
  inhibition of COX pathway accounts for a reduced production of cAMP since the production
  of PGE2 is diminished. This is a simplified pictogram where some pathways and compounds
  generated are not mentioned.
