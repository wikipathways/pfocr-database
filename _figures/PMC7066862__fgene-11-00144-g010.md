caption: Export pathway for excess L-valine. The synthesis of L-alanine requires pyruvate
  and is catalyzed by the valine-pyruvate aminotransferase avtA. The predominant alanine
  racemase in the cell, dadX, is degradative and catalyzes the conversion of L-alanine
  to D-alanine. The respiratory-chain-associated dadA can further catabolite D-alanine
  to pyruvate which can enter the central metabolism, or in this case be used as substrate
  to further convert high concentrations of L-valine to L-alanine. alaE, an alanine-proton
  antiporter, facilitates the export of L-alanine out from the cytosol in exchange
  of a proton. ddlA/B, murD/F, and mtgA are all involved in biosynthesis of cell wall
  structural elements. PG, peptidoglycan; IM, inner membrane). Up-regulated genes
  in the pathway are represented in red.
