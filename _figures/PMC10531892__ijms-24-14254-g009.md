caption: 'Simplified diagram of methodology. Blood samples were collected from 45
  patients with breast cancer (BC): 30 were luminal A and 15 were triple-negative
  breast cancer patients (TNBC). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated
  from blood and stored at −80 °C for future use. Monocytes were extracted from PBMCs
  using a MojoSort monocyte isolation kit and then differentiated into tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs). Thymoquinone (TQ) stock solution was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide
  (DMSO) and was diluted with fresh culture media just before use. According to the
  literature, 20, 50, and 100 µM concentrations were prepared. PBMCs and TAMs were
  cultured with the aforementioned TQ concentrations for 24, 48, and 72 h. RNA isolation
  was conducted with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and then converted into cDNA in the
  thermocycler. Finally, RT-PCR was used to quantify calreticulin, NLRP3, PYCARD,
  caspase-1, and IL-1β. Relative Quantitation (RQ) values were calculated and plotted
  on the Y-axis against TQ concentrations. The cell culture supernatants were used
  to measure the secreted protein levels of IL-1β and sPD-L1 via ELISA. The expression
  and protein levels were compared to the DMSO control. All experiments were performed
  in triplicate and data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical
  analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism software version 9.1.1. The data
  were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple comparisons, and unpaired
  t-test.'
