caption: Biosynthetic pathway leading to the sex pheromone of Agrotis segetum, modified
  from []. It starts with carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, and then they
  are entered to a cycle of fatty acid synthesis and end up with common fatty acids
  stearate and palmitate. The ∆11 desaturase inserts a double bond in the acyl chain
  and then the unsaturated fatty acid is subjected to three rounds of chain-shortening
  by β-oxidation, forming three acyl-chains different by two carbon atoms. These acyl-chains
  are then reduced by fatty-acyl CoA reductase (FAR) to make fatty alcohols, which
  are then acetylated to acetate esters, the final A. segetum pheromones. Thick arrows
  represent steps are functionally assayed in heterologous systems
