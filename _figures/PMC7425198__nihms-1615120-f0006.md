caption: Proteins related to the classical secretory pathway with altered relative
  synthesis rates were clustered and displayed based on biological process or cellular
  compartment. Proteins in Group I (“immediate increase”), Group II (“intermediate
  increase”), and Group III (“delayed increase”) are colored in green, red, and yellow,
  respectively.
