caption: The mechanisms of Tregs in immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Anti-CTLA-4
  enhances the recovery of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling by blocking CTLA-4 on T
  cells, thereby boosting the activity of Teffs. It also reduces the competition for
  CD80/CD86 by Tregs, indirectly decreasing the expression of FoxP3 and the immunosuppressive
  function of Tregs; Anti-PD-1 disrupts the interaction between PD-1 on T cells and
  its ligand PD-L1 on tumor cells, restoring TCR/CD28 signaling and enhancing the
  function of effector T cells (Teff). This enhancement also involves affecting downstream
  pathways such as PI3K/RAS, thereby improving cell survival; Anti-TIGIT blocks TIGIT,
  thereby enhancing the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, and
  increasing cytokine secretion. It also restores the competitiveness of CD226, DNAM-1.
  This is achieved by inhibiting molecules that interact with TIGIT, such as SH2 domain-containing
  proteins (SHIP1), and intracellular T-cell signaling pathways like EPK and PI3K
