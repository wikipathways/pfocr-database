caption: Manipulation of neutrophil function by P. gingivalis. (A) Model of chemokine
  paralysis. Under homeostatic conditions, oral bacteria are kept at bay by steady
  recruitment of neutrophils following a gradient of IL-8 production by the gingival
  epithelium. P. gingivalis can manipulate the IL-8 gradient by secreting SerB, an
  enzyme that dephosphorylates the p65 subunit of NF-κB thereby inhibiting translocation
  into the nucleus and preventing IL-8 transcription. The result is chemokine paralysis
  that disrupts the recruitment of neutrophils into the junctional epithelium and
  control of the outgrowth of oral bacteria. (B) Model of Neutrophil subversion by
  P. gingivalis that leads to dysbiotic inflammation. Due to C5a ligand generation
  by Arg-specific gingipains coupled with potent TLR2 agonists (e.g., lipoproteins),
  P. gingivalis is able to co-activate C5aR and TLR2 resulting in Smurf1-dependent
  MyD88 degradation thus preventing an antimicrobial response. This signaling event
  also induces Mal- and PI3K-dependent inhibition of RhoA, thereby preventing phagocytosis
  while the same subversive pathway mediates inflammatory responses. In total, P.
  gingivalis can successfully decouple antimicrobial killing from a nutritionally
  favorable inflammatory response in neutrophils. This mechanism provides bystander
  support to neighboring bacteria.
