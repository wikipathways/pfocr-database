caption: A large number of non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling pathways have been described.
  Outlined is a vastly simplified schema highlighting some of the key players. (a)
  Frizzled-PCP pathway is enriched asymmetrically at cell boundaries. In Drosophila
  wings Frizzled (Fz), Dishevelled (Dvl) and Diego accumulate at the distal edge of
  each cells, and Van Gogh (Vang) and Prickle (Pk) accumulate on the proximal side
  of each cells. These complexes may be bridged by Flamingo-Flamingo (Fmi-Fmi) interactions
  across cells, as well as interactions between Fmi and Vang and Fmi and Fz and Fz
  and Vang. In addition there are mutually repressive interactions within the cell
  between distal and proximal complexes. Genetically RhoA has been placed downstream
  of the Frizzled-PCP complex. (b) Wnt5a functions primarily as a non-canonical Wnt
  ligand, acting through the tyrosine kinases Ror or Ryk. Activation of JNK, increases
  in intracellular calcium, leading to activation of NFAT and inhibition of canonical
  signaling are some of the alterations seen upon Wnt5a stimulation. (c) Non-canonical
  Wnts also may function through a subset of Frizzled that bias towards PCP signaling,
  such as Frizzled7. (d) Dachsous binding to Fat pathway regulates PCP, possibly via
  recruitment of Casein Kinase I (CKIε), which has been shown in different situations
  to inhibit or stimulate (not shown) PCP signaling. Fat also recruits the transcriptional
  co-repressor Atrophin, which suppresses transcription of the PCP effector gene four-jointed
  (Fj). (e) The atypical tyrosine kinase Ryk is another alternate Wnt receptor, which
  has been shown to function via Src in axon guidance.
