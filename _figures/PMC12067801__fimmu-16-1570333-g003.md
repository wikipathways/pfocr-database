caption: ANO1 in different tissues and its role in diseases. ANO1 is widely expressed
  across various tissues, and its dysfunction and dysregulation can impact multiple
  system functions, including the respiratory, circulatory, digestive, and nervous
  systems. Furthermore, it is closely associated with the onset and progression of
  tumors. (A) In secretory epithelia cells (e.g. airway epithelium cells, Intestinal
  epithelium), ANO1 and CFTR are localized to the apical membrane. Activation of ANO1
  facilitates the transepithelial secretion of Cl− and HCO3 − into the lumen. Adenosine
  Triphosphate (ATP) and other ligands activates G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),
  leading to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), which breaks down membrane phospholipid
  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3).
  IP3 induces Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, elevating intracellular
  Ca2+ levels and subsequently activating ANO1. In airway epithelial cells, activation
  of GPCRs stimulates adenylate cyclase (ADCY), which generates cAMP and subsequently
  activating the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). ANO1
  and CFTR work synergistically in Cl- secretion, with their interaction involving
  functional crosstalk mediated by Ca2+-sensitive adenylate cyclase 1 (ADCY1). (B)
  In smooth muscle cells, angiotensin II (AngII), serotonin (5-HT), and other ligands
  activate GPCRs, stimulating Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This leads
  to Cl− efflux through ANO1, resulting in membrane depolarization and facilitating
  Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs), ultimately inducing smooth
  muscle cell depolarization and contraction. Additionally, AngII can enhance ANO1
  expression on the membrane through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. (C) In neuronal
  cells, inflammatory mediators increase intracellular Ca2+, activating ANO1 and inducing
  Cl- efflux and neuronal depolarization, which contributes to neuropathic pain. The
  functional interaction between Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)
  and ANO1 also plays a role in nociception, as both TRPV1 and ANO1 can be activated
  by heat and capsaicin. (D) In tumor cells, ANO1 participates in various signaling
  pathways, including the EGFR, CaMKII, TGF-β, and NF-κB pathways, playing a critical
  role in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis
