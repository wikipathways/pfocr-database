caption: Proposed model for the effect of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) in the
  neuroinflammatory process.(A) Under homeostatic conditions, the blood-brain barrier
  (BBB) restricts the entry of circulating blood cells into the central nervous system
  (CNS) parenchyma. The low permeability to circulating blood substances and leukocytes
  and the basal concentration of anti-inflammatory mediators (such as transforming
  growth factor β (TGFβ)) in the CNS allow a resting-homeostatic state in CNS resident
  cells. (B) CNS neuroinflammation drives the activation of resident glial cells (such
  as microglia and astrocytes) and the secretion of inflammatory mediators (e.g.,
  monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1)) that promote the infiltration of peripheral
  leukocytes into the injured parenchyma. Endothelial cells increase the expression
  of surface adhesion molecules (e.g., vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)).
  Both, reactive astrocytes and activated endothelium, increase the permeability of
  the BBB. Circulating leukocytes adhere to the activated endothelium and infiltrate
  into the CNS, perpetuating the inflammatory response by a direct interaction with
  neurons and glial cells. During early inflammation, the activation of matrix metalloproteases
  releases TGFβ from the extracellular matrix, increasing the activation of the TGFβ
  pathway and counterbalancing the pro-inflammatory response. (C) Under inflammatory
  conditions, TUDCA treatment increases the activation of the TGFβ pathway and the
  expression of TGFβ3 in neurons, microglia and endothelial cells. The activation
  of TGFβ pathway drives the deactivation of glial cells and the endothelium, leading
  to an anti-inflammatory microenvironment with reduced expression of vascular adhesion
  molecules (e.g., VCAM-1) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., MCP-1), and therefore
  to a reduced BBB permeability and leukocyte infiltration.
