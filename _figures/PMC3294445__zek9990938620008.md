caption: V-ATPase is important in salt detoxification during hyperosmotic stress.
  The HOG MAPK signaling pathway and the V-ATPase act in parallel pathways to mitigate
  osmotic shock during salt stress. Activation of the HOG pathway leads to changes
  in gene expression that promote production of glycerol, an osmoprotectant. The HOG
  pathway also activates transporters at the plasma membrane, resulting in the extrusion
  of NaCl into the extracellular space. On the other hand, the V-ATPase becomes activated
  in response to salt stress, and higher activation of the enzyme is required for
  the activity of vacuolar cation transporters that recruit excess sodium ions into
  the vacuolar lumen.
