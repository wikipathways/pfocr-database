caption: Pathway of metabolic activation of aflatoxin B1 and disruption of the pathway
  by sulforaphane (SF). Aflatoxin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (Cyp450) oxidases
  to the 8,9-epoxide, which reacts with DNA to form DNA adducts with guanine residues.
  The guanine adducts are presumably the functional precursors to carcinogenesis and
  significant contributors to toxicity. SF induces glutathione transferases (GSTs)
  and epoxide hydrolases (EH) and downregulates certain Cyp450s. Each of these alterations
  in enzyme activities would affect the intracellular concentration of the epoxide,
  hence modulating the levels of DNA adducts.
