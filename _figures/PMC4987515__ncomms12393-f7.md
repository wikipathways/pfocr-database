caption: (a) In untreated Mtb the proton motive force (PMF) produced by the terminal
  oxidases is used by Complex V to produce ATP. AXP ratios allosterically regulate
  both glycolysis and the TCA cycle via feedback inhibition to maintain energy homeostasis.
  (b) In the presence of BDQ, Complex V and thus ATP production is inhibited. Although
  Complex V does not relieve the PMF, PMF is modulated by either intrinsic or extrinsic
  uncoupling, preventing back pressure. Without OXPHOS, ATP levels decline, relieving
  carbon catabolism and the TCA cycle of feedback inhibition. This increases production
  of reducing equivalents, which enter the ETC and increase OCR. As the feedback loop
  is broken by BDQ, this control system fails to regulate activity appropriately,
  and glycolysis and the TCA cycle accelerate to their maximum pace. (c) In the presence
  of Q203, Complex III is inhibited. Electrons reroute from the Complex III/IV pathway
  to the cytochrome bd pathway, which generates less PMF. This reduces the efficiency
  of OXPHOS, leading to declining ATP levels, a decrease in feedback inhibition of
  carbon catabolism and the TCA cycle, increased production of reducing equivalents
  and increased respiration. The feedback loop is still functional, and a new steady
  state is reached with reduced ATP levels. (d) In the presence of all three drugs,
  production of reducing equivalents is increased as discussed above. The increased
  flux of electrons through NDH2 enhances CFZ's ability to divert electrons to O2,
  causing the formation of toxic ROS.
