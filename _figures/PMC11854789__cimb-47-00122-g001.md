caption: 'Potential mechanisms of VNS and its related clinical applications: (a) the
  VNS activates α7nAChR through three methods, which is an important basis for treating
  various diseases; (b) VNS regulates BBB integrity by modulating endothelial tight
  junction proteins; (c) VNS promotes angiogenesis by stimulating the release of VEGF,
  BDNF, and GDF-11, which serves as possible evidence for stroke rehabilitation; (d)
  VNS activates the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway, promoting neural plasticity and neuroprotection;
  (e) VNS inhibits cell apoptosis and autophagy, reducing neuronal death and improving
  cell survival; and (f) VNS modulates the release of neurotransmitters in the brain,
  including ACh, NE, DA, 5-HT, and GABA, which is the mechanism for treating multiple
  brain diseases'
