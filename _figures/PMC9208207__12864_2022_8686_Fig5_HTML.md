caption: 'Gene expression changes in the IL-17 signalling pathway. Representation
  of the differentially expressed genes that were enriched in the IL-17 signalling
  pathway (KEGG: bta04657). Red and green boxes indicate the up- and downregulated
  genes in response to tick infestation, respectively. Left-side coloured box represents
  a gene with differential expression in the T3-vs-T0 comparison (3-week tick-exposed
  vs. tick-naive). Right-side coloured box represents a gene with differential expression
  in the T12-vs-T0 comparison (12-week tick-exposed vs. tick-naive). Fully coloured
  box indicates a gene that was changed in both comparisons. Blank box indicates no
  changes in expression. Pathway data was sourced from the KEGG database [–] and rendered
  with the Pathview R package'
