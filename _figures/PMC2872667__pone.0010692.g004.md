caption: Molecules are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between
  two nodes is represented as an edge (line). The intensity of the node color indicates
  the degree of down- (red) or up- (green) regulation where lumbar spine is compared
  with iliac crest. Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional
  class of the gene product. Direct relationships are shown in solid arrows, indirect
  relationships in dashed arrows. Genes with no colour are added to the network by
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis as part of the network generation algorithm.
