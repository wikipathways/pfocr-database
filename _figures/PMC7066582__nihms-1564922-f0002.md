caption: Model showing the anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic effect of retinoic
  acid (RA) as a combinatorial drug in lung cancer progression. RA promotes angiogenesis
  and metastasis in lung cancer via activation of the extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) pathway. Activation of the ERK pathway upregulates hypoxia-inducible
  factor-alpha (HIF-α), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and activator protein-2 (AP-2)
  gene expression which favors the upregulation of many factors involved in angiogenesis
  and metastasis such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth
  factor (EGF), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). However, activation of the ERK
  pathway alleviates the expression of MMPs inhibitors such as TIMP metallopeptidase
  inhibitor (TIMP). Treatment with a combination of RA and ERK inhibitors drastically
  overcomes this effect of RA resulting in inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis
  in lung tumours. Bexarotene also inhibits angiogenesis and metastasis of lung tumours
  via ERK pathway inhibition. The high concentration of liposome encapsulated RA inhibits
  angiogenesis and metastasis in lung tumours via ERK pathway inhibition.
