caption: 'Different representations of protein interactions. (A) Experimental methods
  can either provide evidence that support a physical contact between two proteins
  to form a complex (physical interaction) or a modulation of the activity of a target
  protein caused by the activity of a parent protein (causal interaction). (B) Different
  graphical representation of the same biological statement: PTPRJ dephosphorylates
  and inhibits MAPK1 (Sacco et al., ). Three distinct models to represent protein
  relationships supported by different experimental evidence: undirected PPI, activity-flow
  and process description. (C) The EGFR signaling pathway represented as an undirected
  protein-protein interaction network (PPI), as activity-flow network (AF) and a process-description
  network (PD). *indicates the modified form of a given protein node.'
