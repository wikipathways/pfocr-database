caption: The roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in regulating metabolic diseases, cancer,
  and aging. Differential mTORC1 activity has been shown to be protective against
  diabetes and cancer, in addition to prolonging life span (top panel). mTORC1 hyperactivity
  hampers the production of ketone bodies in the liver, protecting against diabetic
  ketogenesis. In contrast, a reduction in mTORC1 activity promotes the accumulation
  of senescent cells due to the downregulation of S6K1 and upregulation of PD-L1,
  which in turn triggers autophagy, slowing the aging process. Moreover, increased
  levels of NLRC3 due to reduced mTORC1 signaling exert inhibitory effects against
  cancer, further improving overall health. However, hyperactivation of both mTORC1
  and mTORC2 induces progressive outcomes towards metabolic diseases and cancers (bottom
  panel). Increased activities of both furin and IRS-1 due to continuous mTORC1 activation
  cause high glucose levels, reduced GSIS, and promote insulin resistance. Taken together,
  such disruptions directly contribute to β-cell dysfunction, and eventually, diabetes.
  Increased TGs and lower LDL promote the accumulation of lipid droplets, leading
  to obesity in a mTORC1-SNAT2-dependent manner. Inhibiting autophagy also plays a
  role in exacerbating metabolic outcomes that lead to NAFLD driven by eIF4E. Moreover,
  the crosstalk between both mTOR complexes has also been shown to further inhibit
  the autophagic pathway, leading to cancer. mTORC2 hyperactivation, due to PTEN loss,
  leads to continuous cell proliferation, further driving cancer progression. mTORC1
  and 2, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and 2; S6K1, P70-S6K1; PD-L1, programmed
  death-ligand 1; NLRC3, nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeats 3; IRS-1,
  insulin receptor substrate 1; SNAT2, sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter
  2; eIF4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin
  homolog; Glu, glucose; GSIS; glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; IR, insulin resistance;
  TG, triglyceride; LDL, lipoprotein lipase; NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
