caption: 'The biogenesis of miRNA. Note: Most miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase
  II (RNA pol II) in the form of primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA), and then processed in
  the nucleus by Drosha andcleavaged to precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). The pre-miRNA
  is further exported to the cytoplasm by exportin5 and further cleavaged by a complex
  containing Ago 2 and TRBP 2. The functional strand of mature miRNA is incorporated
  into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). As a component of this complex, the
  mature miRNA regulates the expression oftarget genes by specifically binding to
  these complementary sequences in the 3''UTR or coding regions of target mRNA, leading
  to the mRNA degradation or translational repression. Alternatively, the mature miRNA
  induce the translational activation by specifically binding to the 5''UTR of target
  mRNA. In addition, miRNAs can be secreted through the exosomal pathway and regulate
  the gene expression of recipient cells.'
