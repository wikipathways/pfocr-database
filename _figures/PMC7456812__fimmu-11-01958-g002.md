caption: Mechanistic basis for therapeutic targeting of ligand-specific Notch signaling.
  Agents targeting Notch signaling can be grouped by the step or process in the Notch
  signaling pathway that is being affected. Soluble decoys comprise of extracellular
  portions of Notch ligands or receptors that can competitively inhibit multivalent
  receptor-ligand interactions. Soluble multivalent ligands comprise of clustered
  ligands that provide and/or augment ligand-specific Notch activation. Blocking antibodies
  block receptor interactions with ligands and are paralog-specific antagonists with
  high selectivity. γ-secretase inhibitors prevent NICD release by inhibiting S3 cleavage
  of Notch receptors at the juxtamembrane domain. L-fucose analogs (solid red triangles)
  are taken up by cells from media and incorporated into receptor extracellular domains.
  Fucose analogs on Notch receptors alter ligand-binding affinities and can be used
  to block selective ligand interactions. Blocking peptides target protein-protein
  interface in the nuclear Notch transcriptional complex and prevent transcription
  of Notch target genes. In vitro, pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrating
  Notch-modulatory activities and anti-tumor efficacy of various classes of Notch
  therapeutics are presented in .
