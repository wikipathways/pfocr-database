caption: 'Schematic of glucose metabolism and deuterium glucose tracing(A) Schematic
  of glucose metabolism. NADH/NAD+-dependent reactions catalyzed by cGPD, GAPDH, PHGDH
  and LDH are highlighted. cGPD: cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAPDH:
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PHGDH: phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase.
  LDH: lactate dehydrogenase.(B) Schematic of [4-2H]-glucose tracing of NADH. The
  2H can be transferred to NADH at the step catalyzed by GAPDH and then to Gro3P catalyzed
  by cGPD. DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; Gro3P:
  glycerol-3-phosphate.(C) Schematic of [3-2H]-glucose tracing of NADPH. The 2H can
  be transferred to NADPH in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. G6P: glucose-6-phosphate;
  6PG: 6-phosphogluconate; R5P: ribose-5-phosphate.'
