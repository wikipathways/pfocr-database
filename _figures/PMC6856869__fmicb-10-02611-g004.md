caption: Recognition of HSV-1 infection by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Host
  cells are equipped with several PRRs that can recognize virion components (e.g.,
  glycoprotein and vDNA) and structures accumulated during vDNA replication (e.g.,
  dsRNA). Examples of PRRs include cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate
  synthase (cGAS), DExD/H-box helicases (DHX), melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and toll-like receptors
  (TLRs). It remains highly controversial whether interferon-gamma-inducible protein
  16 (IFI16) can sense incoming vDNA in the nucleus (the dashed line represents uncertainty).
  PRRs signal through the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-TANK-binding kinase
  1 (TBK1)-IFN regulatory factor 3 and 7 (IRF3/7) pathway to induce interferon (IFN)
  production. Adapted with permission from .
