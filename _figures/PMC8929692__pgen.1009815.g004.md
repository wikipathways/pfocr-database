caption: (A,C) The glyoxylate cycle, β-oxidation, and (B,D) modified β-oxidation pathway
  [] are depicted in a simplified form. The expression profiles obtained by the RNA-Seq
  (A,B; ) and LC-MS/MS analyses (C,D; ) are shown. The three squares illustrate the
  gene expression changes on different hydroxyaromatic substrates compared to galactose
  as indicated in the legend in the upper left corner on panels (A) and (C). Only
  the genes whose transcription was overexpressed on at least one hydroxyaromatic
  substrate are shown. Note that not all enzymes listed in  and  Figs are shown on
  the scheme.
