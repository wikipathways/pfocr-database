caption: 'Regulation of PIAS1-mediated transcriptional repression by phosphorylation
  and sumoylation. (a) PIAS1 directly binds to chromatin and represses NF-κB-mediated
  transcription in response to inflammatory stimuli, which is regulated by ligand-induced
  Ser90 phosphorylation of PIAS1. The IKKα kinase is activated by inflammatory stimuli
  such as TNF and LPS, which then translocates into the nucleus where it interacts
  with PIAS1 and phosphorylates PIAS1 at Ser90. The IKKα-mediated PIAS1 phosphorylation
  is dependent on the SUMO E3 ligase activity of PIAS1, indicating that the possible
  sumoylation (represented as ‘Su?’) of PIAS1 and/or IKKα might be involved in this
  process. Phosphorylated PIAS1 disassociates from IKKα and then binds to the promoters
  of PIAS1-regulated genes for transcriptional repression. (b) PIAS1 also participates
  in PPARγ-mediated transrepression by acting as SUMO E3 ligase for PPARγ. In response
  to a PPARγ agonist, such as rosiglitazone (Ro), PPARγ is activated via PIAS1-mediated
  sumoylation and recruited to the NCoR–HDAC3 corepressor complex, preventing the
  degradation of the NCoR–HDAC3 complex by the ubiquitin–proteosome pathway and resulting
  in transrepression. Abbreviation: Ub, ubiquitylation.'
