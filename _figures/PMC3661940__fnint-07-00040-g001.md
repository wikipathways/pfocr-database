caption: Intrinsic somatodendritic and presynaptic modulation of action potential
  (AP) firing and transmitter release in 5-HT neurons. (A) AP firing of 5-HT neurons
  is modulated by GPCRs and ion channels. AP firing is reduced (red arrows) via activation
  of GPCRs coupling to the Gi/opathway or activation of inhibitory ligand-gated ion
  channels. Gi/opathway activation can lead to the activation of GIRK channels, inhibition
  of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or increase in GABAA receptor currents. In addition,
  Gq/11 activation can lead to synthesis of endocannabinoids, which inhibit transmitter
  release onto 5-HT neurons. AP firing is increased (blue arrows) via activation of
  GPCRs coupling to the Gq/11pathway or activation of excitatory ligand-gated ion
  channels. Gq/11pathway activation can lead to the activation of non-selective cation
  channels or inhibition of K+ conductance. In addition, the activation of L-type
  Ca2+ channels via protein kinase C (PKC) can most likely increase membrane depolarization
  and transcription. (B) 5-HT release of 5-HT neurons is also modulated by GPCRs and
  ion channels. 5-HT release is reduced (red arrow) via activation of GPCRs coupling
  to the Gi/opathway. Gi/opathway activation leads to the inhibition of presynaptic
  Ca2+ channels, reduction in Ca2+ influx and therefore reduction in transmitter release.
  5-HT release is increased (blue arrows) via activation of GPCRs coupling to the
  Gspathway and via opening of excitatory, ligand-gated ion channels.
