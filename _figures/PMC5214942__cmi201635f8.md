caption: Our model depicting the role of the AIM2 inflammasome in maintaining intestinal
  homeostasis and how loss of Aim2 promotes dysbiosis and colitis. AIM2 promotes IL-18
  production in response to microbial DNA in IECs, which downregulates the expression
  of Il22bp and consequently enhances IL-22 activity in the colon. This is required
  for a balanced expression of antimicrobial peptides, including Reg3β and Reg3γ,
  to prevent dysbiosis. In addition, IL-18 is capable of positively regulating Reg3β
  and Reg3γ expression. Conversely, loss of Aim2 impairs IL-18 production, enhances
  IL-22BP and consequently impairs IL-22, and Reg3β and Reg3γ expression, resulting
  in dysbiosis and heightened susceptibility to colitis. During colitis, IL-18 production
  is enhanced, which downregulates IL-22BP expression and amplifies IL-22-mediated
  STAT3 activation to promote Reg3β and Reg3γ production. In turn, Reg3β and Reg3γ
  further promote and sustain STAT3 and Akt activation in a self-amplifying feed-forward
  loop, which promotes proliferation of crypt cells and intestinal repair. Loss of
  Aim2 dysregulates this signaling axis, resulting in improved proliferation and repair
  during the resolution of colitis, which may eventually lead to colorectal cancer.

  description: Our model depicting the role of the AIM2 inflammasome in maintaining

    promotes IL-18 production in response to microbial DNA in IECs, which downregulates

    This is required for a balanced expression of antimicrobial peptides, including
    Reg3β and Reg3γ, to prevent dysbiosis. In addition, IL-18 is capable of positively
    regulating Reg3β and Reg3γ expression. Conversely, loss of Aim2 impairs IL-18

    colitis, IL-18 production is enhanced, which downregulates IL-22BP expression
    and amplifies IL-22-mediated STAT3 activation to promote Reg3β and Reg3γ production.
    In turn, Reg3β and Reg3γ further promote and sustain STAT3 and Akt activation
    in a self-amplifying feed-forward loop, which promotes proliferation of crypt
    cells and intestinal repair. Loss of Aim2 dysregulates this signaling axis, resulting
