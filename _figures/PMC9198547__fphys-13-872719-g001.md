caption: 'The main pathways for nitric oxide (NO) production. The dietary pathway
  (starting at upper left) utilizes NO3- and is facilitated by lower pO2 and pH. Ingestion
  of NO3−-containing foods, especially vegetables such as beetroot, start this pathway.
  NO3− is reduced to nitrite (NO2-) by reductases or acidic conditions and facilitated
  by oxyheme proteins. Then NO2- is reduced to NO under the appropriate conditions.
  Importantly, skeletal muscle can serve as a ‘reservoir’ for nitrate. As shown by
  the dashed arrows, this pathway can also ‘run in reverse’ with NO being used to
  create NO2- and then NO3− given the appropriate conditions. *Note: NO3− can be taken
  up from the circulation into the salivary glands and go through this reduction pathway
  again in what is known as ‘the enterosalivary pathway.’ The endogenous pathway (lower
  left) uses NO synthase and oxygen to create citrulline and NO. An abbreviated depiction
  of the organic nitrate pathway (lower right) shows the production of NO derived
  from pharmacologic sources, such as nitroglycerin. ALDH-2 = aldehyde dehydrogenase,
  P450 = cytochrome P450. Reproduced with permission from Biochimica et Biophysica
