caption: TGR5-mediated cell signaling pathways in different liver cell types. TGR5
  activation leads to increased intracellular cAMP levels, followed by activation
  of PKA, ultimately leading to altered gene expression [,], resulting in relaxation
  of gallbladder smooth muscle cells and increased gallbladder filling. TGR5 signaling
  in Kupffer cells decreases LPS-induced cytokine production via a cAMP-dependent
  pathway [] and antagonizes NF-κB, both resulting in a decreased hepatic inflammatory
  response [,]. TGR5 signaling in non-ciliated cholangiocytes inhibits ERK1/2 signaling,
  resulting in increased proliferation; whereas in ciliated cholangiocytes, TGR5 signaling
  increases ERK1/2 activity to decrease proliferation []. TGR5 signaling in liver
  sinusoidal endothelial cells enhances AKT phosphorylation and increases vasodilation
  [,].
