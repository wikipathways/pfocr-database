caption: The CXCR3/PLC/IP3/IP3R signaling pathway stimulated by PT. Schematic representation
  of the signaling pathway stimulated by the binding of gliadin peptides (PT) to the
  IEC membrane receptor CXCR3. CXCR3 is a GPCR that activates PLC enzymatic activity
  through the involvement of a G protein. Active PLC cleaves PIP2 into DAG and IP3.
  The latter binds to its specific receptor, the IP3R calcium channel located in the
  ER membranes. This induces the efflux of calcium from the ER into the cytosol, altering
  the redox status of the organelle, which impairs its folding capacity and triggers
  the unfolded protein response (UPR). As a result, downstream effects include dysregulation
  of TG2 and CXCR3 gene expression, disruption of gut permeability, and the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are key features of celiac disease (CD)
