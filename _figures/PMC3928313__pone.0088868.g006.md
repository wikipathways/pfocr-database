caption: The pathway map of GSH-synthesis related metabolites are shown. The significance
  (p value) and the trends for the mean concentration differences between Allo and
  Syn mice are denoted by different colors. Green represents metabolites with mean
  concentrations in Allo mice that are significantly (p>0.5) increased (>25%) over
  syn mice. Yellow represents metabolites that are increased (>25%) in Allo, but was
  not statistically significant (p>0.05). White denotes metabolites that did not change
  greater ±25%. Orange represents metabolites whose mean concentration in Allo decreased
  by more than 25%, but did not reach significance (p>0.05). Red identifies metabolites
  that decreased in Allo by more than 25% and was also significant (p<0.05).
