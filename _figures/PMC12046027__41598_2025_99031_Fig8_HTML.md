caption: The Interferon-Induced OAS-RNase L/PKR Pathway and the effect of hnRNP A1
  depletion. DsRNA are recognized by TLR3 and activate signaling pathway to induce
  type I interferon. Secretion of IFN activates the IFN receptor and subsequent signaling
  pathway, ultimately leading to transcription of ISGs, including the dsRNA sensors
  OASs. Upon binding to dsRNA, OASs will synthesize 2–5As, second messenger needed
  for the dimerization and activation of RNase L. RNase L will degrade RNA, including
  circRNA, which maintains PKR in an inactivated state. At the same time, PKR will
  also bind dsRNA and will be activated following an autophosphorylation event. This
  facilitates the formation of RLBs and results in the activation of transcription
  of IFNs and ISGs. Arrows in red represent the various steps modulated by hnRNP A1
  depletion. Created in BioRender. Vande Velde, C. (2025) https://BioRender.com/c96y999
