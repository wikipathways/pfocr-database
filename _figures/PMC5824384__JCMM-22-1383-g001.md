caption: The role and mechanism of Twist1 in renal, pulmonary and skin fibrosis. (A)
  The role and mechanism of Twist1 in renal fibrosis. Hypoxia induces the expression
  of HIF‐1α that can bind to the proximal HRE of Twist1 at ‐317 to ‐312 in tubular
  epithelial cells and modulate Twist1 expression. Moreover, Twist1 and HIF‐1α can
  bind to Bmi1 promoter at ‐732 to ‐727 and ‐190 to ‐185, respectively, and cooperatively
  promote Bmi1 expression. Bmi1 induces the EMT program via activation of PI3K/Akt
  signalling to increase ECM deposition, resulting in renal fibrosis. The Wnt/β‐catenin
  pathway can also increase Twist1 expression, leading to renal fibrosis. However,
  direct interaction between Notch or Hedgehog signalling and Twist1 expression has
  not been found in renal fibrosis, and the hypothesis needs further investigation.
  (B) The role and mechanism of Twist1 in pulmonary fibrosis. In alveolar epithelial
  cells, persistent hypoxia induces HIF‐1α expression and de novo Twist1 expression,
  leading to repression of SP‐D that can inhibit the EMT process. Twist1 also promotes
  the EMT process directly, resulting in the accumulation of ECM and pulmonary fibrosis.
  Bleomycin‐induced lung fibrosis via the activation of TGF‐β1 signalling and up‐regulation
  of Twist1 could be ameliorated by drugs like ATRA and methacycline that could block
  TGF‐β1 signalling. Bleomycin‐stimulated Twist1 Ser42 phosphorylation controls angiogenesis
  via activating Tie2 signalling. Id2 could promote the proliferation of primary alveolar
  epithelial cells and block TGF‐β1‐stimulated type I collagen expression by inhibiting
  Twist1. BRD4 binds to phospho‐Ser276 NF‐κB/RelA stimulated by TGF‐β1 to regulate
  the expression of EMT regulators including Twist1. Moreover, Twist1 could protect
  lung fibroblasts from apoptosis stimulated by growth factor partly by negatively
  regulating the expression of Bim and PUMA. In addition, loss of Twist1 in collagen‐producing
  cells augments bleomycin‐induced experimental pulmonary fibrosis that is associated
  with the elevated expression of non‐canonical NF‐κB transcription factor RelB and
  T‐cell chemoattractant CXCL12, which causes the accumulation of T cells. (C) The
  role and mechanism of Twist1 in skin fibrosis. Twist1 expression is elevated in
  fibroblasts of fibrotic skin in a TGF‐β/Smad3/p38‐dependent manner. In turn, the
  enhanced Twist1 promotes the activation of the p38 pathway. In addition to promoting
  Twist1 expression, TGF‐β also induces the up‐regulation of ID proteins, which have
  high affinity for E12/E47 and compete with Twist1 for binding E12/E47 proteins.
  This situation leads to the formation of Twist1 homodimers that can promote the
  expression of type I collagen via direct binding to the promoters of COL1A1 and
  COL1A2. Additionally, Twist1 can promote EndMT, which is responsible for skin fibrosis.
