caption: Model for Nrarp feedback regulation of Notch signaling. (A) In the absence
  of ICD, the CSL proteins associate with HDAC-containing complexes, thereby repressing
  transcription of Notch target genes. (B) On Notch signaling, ICD is released from
  the membrane and forms a complex with the CSL proteins and Mastermind (MM), thereby
  generating a transcriptional activator of Notch target genes, including Nrarp. (C)
  Nrarp feeds back and forms a complex with the CSL proteins, ICD, and Mastermind,
  which leads indirectly to a degradation of ICD. (D) Loss of ICD precludes the further
  association of Mastermind and Nrarp with the CSL proteins, thereby converting these
  proteins back into transcriptional repressors.
