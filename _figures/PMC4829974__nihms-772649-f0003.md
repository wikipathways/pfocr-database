caption: a) The cell cycle checkpoint machinery. b) T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling
  pathway. The genes with inactivating mutations or copy number losses were colored
  in blue; the genes with activating mutations, copy number gains or significantly
  upregulated genes in comparison with control T cells were colored in red; genes
  with all other genetic alterations were colored in orange; genes without detectable
  alterations but are important components of the pathway are also included and shown
  in white rectangles; for each gene with somatic alterations, the percentage of cases
  altered was indicated; for significantly upregulated genes, the average fold changes
  are also shown.
