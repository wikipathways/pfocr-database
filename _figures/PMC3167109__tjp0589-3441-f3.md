caption: 'A, the concept of cerebellar microzones is partly built on the anatomical
  conservation of dedicated OCNO loops. Aa, according to the OCNO conservation model,
  single climbing fibres (CFs) diverge onto 5–10 PNs that are strictly localized in
  narrow parasagittal bands in the cerebellar cortex, and CFs originating from same
  inferior olivary (IO) areas target PNs in the same bands (‘blue’ IO neurons targeting
  PNs in the blue band, and ‘green’ IO neurons to the green band). This division into
  specialized bands is thought to extend into the CN by way of a precise topographic
  cortico-nuclear connection (the PN axons), that targets specific groups of nucleo-olivary
  (NO) neurons projecting to the IO region belonging to the same ‘loop’ (schematized
  as ‘blue’ or ‘green’ areas). This organization is further accentuated by collaterals
  of the CFs that are known to target NO neurons (and possibly other CN neurons) again
  within the same band. Strict conservation of OCNO bands allows the cerebellar cortex
  to respond to olivary signals (complex spikes) in each cortical zone independently.
  Ab, even though the strict zonal arrangement of CFs between IO and PNs, as well
  as a relatively clear topographical organization of cortico-nuclear PN axons, are
  well supported by anatomical evidence, the possibility of inter-zonal crosstalk
  at the level of CN is not excluded. First, the strict restriction of the olivo-nuclear
  projection via CF collaterals to CN neurons receiving input from PNs within the
  same parasagittal band has not been demonstrated, even though the majority of CF
  collaterals target CN neurons within the coarser anatomical groups (‘A–D2’, ; ‘I–V’,
  ). Second, the role of the nucleo-olivary connection as a modulator of interneuronal
  coupling and synchronization among clusters of IO neurons suggests a more diffuse
  targeting. ‘Fuzzy’ OCNO loops allow activity in one cerebellar receptive field to
  influence IO-originating complex spikes (and the resulting effects on PN firing
  and PF–PN plasticity) across other, possibly not directly related cerebellar zones.
  B, schematic drawing of the cerebellar circuitry in a frontal view. The floccular
  cerebellum (FC; far right) and the related behavioural function (vestibulo-ocular
  reflex) have been the focus of intense study, and features described in this system
  (such as conservation of OCNO pathway on a single-cell level) have been thought
  to generalize to the entire cerebellum. However, the connections of the vestibulocerebellum
  (incorporating the floccular cerebellar cortex, the ventralmost part of the lateral
  CN, and specific regions of the contralateral IO, the ventrolateral olive and dorsal
  cap of Kooy) to the CN exhibit many structural differences compared to those from
  the cerebellar hemispheres. Most strikingly, the olivo-nuclear CF collaterals and
  PN axons in the FC target an area in the CN that has significantly fewer large glutamatergic
  projection neurons than the rest of the CN, and part of the FC signalling to its
  extracerebellar targets (the oculomotor nuclei) is conveyed via the projection neurons
  within the vestibular nuclei (VN) that are outside the OCNO loop. The areas in CN
  targeted by PNs from the cerebellar hemispheres have, on the other hand, fewer NO
  neurons compared to glutamatergic projection neurons. Whether the CF collaterals
  in these areas conform to the strict OCNO arrangement is not known. Abbreviations:
  CN, cerebellar nuclei; PNs, Purkinje neurons; CFs, climbing fibres; IO, inferior
  olive; NO, nucleo-olivary; CFc, climbing fibre collateral; Pax, Purkinje neuron
  axon; VN, vestibular nuclei.'
