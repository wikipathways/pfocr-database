caption: 'Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the nectar secretion
  pathway as well as genes involved in sucrose production, transport, and hydrolysis
  in Taraxacum. The following genes were examined: HXE, hexokinase 1/2; PGM2, phosphoglucomutase
  2; UGP, UTP-glucose-1-phosphatase; SPSA2, sucrose phosphate synthase 2; SUS1, sucrose
  transport1,3,5; CWIN, cell wall invertase 4. The sucrose metabolic pathway was constructed
  using the Plant Metabolic Network (PMN). Most genes associated with nectar secretion
  were up-regulated in Taraxacum. Detailed DEG analysis and transcripts of sucrose
  biosynthesis are provided in Supplementary Table S6. The species examined include
  tha: T. hallaisanense; tmo: T. mongolicum; toh: T. ohwianum; tof: T. officinale;
  and tco: T. coreanum'
