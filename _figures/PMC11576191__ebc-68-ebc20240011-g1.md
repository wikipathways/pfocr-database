caption: CaMKK2 is activated by voltage and ligand-gated Ca2+ channels (CaV1.2 and
  NMDA receptor) as well as hormone receptors (GSHR) that increase intracellular Ca2+
  and cause accumulation of the Ca2+-calmodulin complex. CaMKK2 decodes Ca2+ signals
  generated by these cell surface activators by triggering the downstream activation
  of the CaMK1, CaMK4, AMPK, and Akt/PKB signaling pathways. Through these downstream
  pathways, CaMKK2 regulates a variety of cellular processes that support brain function
  and whole-body energy homeostasis
