caption: Proposed biochemical pathway for the synthesis of eugenol and isoeugenol
  from phenylalanine and hypothetical reaction mechanisms for EGS1 and IGS1. (A) The
  multiple steps in the biosynthetic pathway from phenylalanine to coniferyl alcohol,
  an intermediate in the synthesis of lignin and lignans, were previously identified.
  (B) Hypothetical nucleophilic displacement mechanism, where reduction through hydride
  attack accompanies loss of an acyl leaving group possibly facilitated by stabilization
  of the negatively charged transition state of the acyl moiety through proton donation.
  B (in blue) represents a putative general base/hydrogen bond donor–acceptor hydrogen-bonded
  to the p-hydroxy group of coniferyl acetate. A (in red) represents a general acid/hydrogen
  bond donor–acceptor. (C) Hypothetical mechanism where formation of a quinone methide
  intermediate precedes reduction (). It is not currently known which of the two hydrogens
  from the NADPH molecule (both shown in green) are transferred (in the form of a
  hydride) to the phenylpropanoid substrate. Hydrogen atoms not involved in the reaction
  are not shown.
