caption: a | Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) mediates inflammatory and antiviral
  cellular programmes by engaging the transcription factors interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) and canonical NF-κB (RELA–p50). IRF3 activation is strictly controlled
  by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which binds to the C-terminal tail (CTT) of STING
  through a conserved PLPLRT/SD binding motif to then phosphorylate Ser366 within
  the CTT (phospho-site). In certain cells, activation of NF-κB is less dependent
  on the CTT and TBK1. In addition, non-canonical NF-κB (RELB–p52) is activated downstream
  of STING and counteracts IRF3 and canonical NF-κB signalling. STING impacts cell
  survival and cellular proliferation in diverse ways and is associated with the induction
  of apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis and cellular senescence. Both necroptosis
  and senescence can be triggered by STING-induced cytokines. Apoptosis induction
  can proceed through the upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes (PUMA, NOXA) or, alternatively,
  directly engage BAX and BAK at the mitochondrial membrane. STING-mediated lysosomal
  damage has been shown to activate NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis. b | Intercellular
  2′3′ cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) transfer can be mediated by connexin proteins that form
  gap junctions between neighbouring cells, which can be homotypic or heterotypic.
  Additionally, various cell types use the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC)
  composed of LRCC8 subunits to import and export cGAMP. In the extracellular space,
  cGAMP is subject to degradation by the enzyme ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase
  family member 1 (ENPP1). Tumour cells have also been shown to export cGAMP whereas
  myeloid cells use SLC19A1 or P2XR7 to import cGAMP. Connexin channels also mediate
  heterotypic cellular cGAMP transfer. APC, antigen-presenting cell; cGAS, cyclic
  GMP–AMP synthase; IFN, interferon; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene.
