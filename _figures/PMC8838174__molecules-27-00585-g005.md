caption: Diagram shows protein–protein interactions in apoptosis signaling pathway
  and the involvement of five of the differentially expressed proteins from A2780
  ovarian cancer cells treated with 9-methoxycanthine-6-one. Proteins that were labelled
  in green were proteins that were suppressed by 9-methoxycanthine-6-one.
