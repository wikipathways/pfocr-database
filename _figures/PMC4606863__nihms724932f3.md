caption: TLR4-mediated priming of macrophages by LPS induces pro-IL-1β production
  via activation of NF-κB. Subsequent purinergic P2X7 receptor engagement by ATP initiates
  the process of caspase-1 activation through inflammasome initiation, which converts
  pro-IL-1β to IL-1β, but a parallel pathway in macrophages exists to initiate the
  resolution of inflammation. TLR4-mediated priming also activates cPLA2 and induces
  COX2 production via NF-κB; this results in the release of arachidonic acid and conversion
  to 15-HETE, which becomes esterified into phospholipids. Subsequent purinergic P2X7
  receptor engagement activates cPLA2 and 5-LOX in Ca2+-dependent processes, leading
  to the release of 15-HETE from membrane phospholipids and conversion of the 15-HETE
  to lipoxin. The first step in this process is enhanced by aspirin which causes complete
  eicosanoid class switching from pro-inflammatory prostaglandins to anti-inflammatory
  lipoxins.

  description: TLR4-mediated priming of macrophages by LPS induces pro-IL-1β production
    via activation of NF-κB. Subsequent purinergic P2X7 receptor engagement by ATP
    initiates the process of caspase-1 activation through inflammasome initiation,
    which converts pro-IL-1β to IL-1β, but a parallel pathway in macrophages exists
    to initiate the resolution of inflammation. TLR4-mediated priming also activates
