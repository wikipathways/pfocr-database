caption: Model depicting the role of the Sty1 pathway in the fission yeast stress
  response. The Sty1 signaling pathway is involved in the response of cells to a variety
  of different stress conditions. The role of Sty1 is to regulate the activity of
  the two transcription factors Atf1 (; ) and Pap1 (this study), which in turn regulate
  the expression of a number of genes encoding products that mediate different stress
  responses. The physiological events controlled by each factor are indicated.
