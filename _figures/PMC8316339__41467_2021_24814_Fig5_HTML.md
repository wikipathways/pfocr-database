caption: a Ten of 11 pB-mutants in genes related to apicoplast isoprenoid biosynthesis
  represented in the 1K-library were HS-Sensitive. Mutants are ranked by phenotype
  from HS-Sensitive (red) to HS-Tolerant (green). Circles indicate each HS-Sensitive
  mutant related to isoprenoid biosynthesis. *The isoprenoid biosynthesis genes we
  identified as directly upregulated in response to HS via RNAseq (DXS, PF3D7_1337200;
  apicoplast RNA methyltransferase, PF3D7_0218300). b Key enzymes in the P. falciparum
  isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway are upregulated in response to heat-shock (red circle),
  dysregulated in HS-Sensitive mutants (ocher), and absent in malaria-parasites of
  hosts that do not present fever. Pathway diagram modeled from. Isoprenoid biosynthesis
  genes upregulated in HS include DXS, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate
  synthase (IspF, PF3D7_0209300), pyruvate kinase II (PyKII, PF3D7_1037100), phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate
  translocator (PPT, PF3D7_0530200), triosephosphate isomerase (TIM, PF3D7_1439900),
  triosephosphate transporter (TPT, PF3D7_1218400), and upstream-regulator of MEP-pathway
  substrates HAD1-phosphotase (HAD1, PF3D7_1033400). All direct downstream-targets
  prenylated by bifunctional farnesyl/geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS/GGPPS,
  PF3D7_1128400) with products of the MEP-pathway (zigzag) represented in pooled screening
  were HS-Sensitive, including the Rab-family vesicular trafficking proteins (Rab5c,
  PF3D7_0106800; Rab7, PF3D7_0903200; Rab11b, PF3D7_1340700), as were several digestive
  vacuole proteases and proteins involved in hemoglobin digestion (PM1, PF3D7_1407900;
  ATCase, PF3D7_1344800; M1AAP, PF3D7_1311800; LAP, PF3D7_1446200; HSP70, PF3D7_0818900).
  The key thiamin-synthesis enzyme hydroxyethylthiazole kinase (ThzK, PF3D7_1239600)
  is absent in P. berghei and P. yoelii, malaria-parasites whose rodent hosts do not
  present fever. c P. falciparum genes with plant orthologs (green circles) indicating
  potential endosymbiont-ancestry tend to be increased in response to HS vs. genes
  that do not have plant orthologs (gray circles). P. falciparum genes with potential
  endosymbiont-ancestry were derived from 1919 ortholog-pairs between Arabidopsis
  thaliana and P. falciparum (data from OrthoMCLv5.0). The listed processes are sorted
  based on the ratio of plant-like to non-plant-like orthologs. Source data are provided
  as a Source Data file.
