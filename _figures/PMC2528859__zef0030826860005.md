caption: UPR signaling preserves ER function and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
  (GSIS). Nutrient stimuli and insulin resistance combine to increase the transcription
  and translation of proinsulin mRNA. The increased biosynthetic load of proinsulin
  requires UPR signaling for cellular adaptation and maintenance of polypeptide folding
  within the ER. Excessive biosynthetic load on the ER or genetic defects in UPR signaling,
  for example Perk-null or eIF2α Ser51Ala mutations, cause ER stress, increase interaction
  of misfolded proinsulin with BiP, and reduce secretory granule biogenesis. As a
  consequence, the pool of secretory granules is depleted, and the capacity for GSIS
  is lost. Humans with polymorphisms that reduce the capacity for protein folding
  or ER stress signaling may be predisposed to β-cell failure and development of diabetes.
