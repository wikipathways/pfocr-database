caption: Schematic diagram and heat maps of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  involved in carotenoid metabolic pathways during different developmental stages
  in ‘X15’ and ‘JTY’. DEGs linked to enzymes and their log2FC values are presented
  in the heat maps. Redder and bluer colors represent higher and lower log2FC values,
  respectively. PSY, 15-cis-phytoene synthase; PDS, 15-cis-phytoene desaturase; ZISO,
  zeta-carotene isomerase; ZDS, zeta-carotene desaturase; CRTISO, prolycopene isomerase;
  LCYB, lycopene beta-cyclase; CrtZ, beta-carotene 3-hydroxylase; ZEP, zeaxanthin
  epoxidase; VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase; NSY, neoxanthin synthase; NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid
  dioxygenase; LCYE, lycopene epsilon-cyclase; LUT5, beta-ring hydroxylase; LUT1,
  carotenoid epsilon hydroxylase
