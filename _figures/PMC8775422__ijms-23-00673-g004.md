caption: Effects of glucocorticoids on canonical Wnt signaling in osteoblasts. Glucocorticoids
  (GC) inhibit osteoblast cell differentiation by opposing Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
  (A) In osteoblasts, when Wnt is present, it binds to specific receptors, called
  frizzled (FZD) to coreceptors, low-density lipoprotein receptor related proteins
  (LRP-5/6), leading to the inhibition of glycogen-synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) activity,
  via its link with LRP-5/6 mediated by the protein Axin. When GSK-3β is not active,
  stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, where it associates with transcription
  factors to regulate gene expression involved in osteoblast activity. (B) When Wnt
  is absent, the complex GSK-3β-Axin- Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) is activated,
  leading to β-catenin phosphorylation (P) and consequently to its degradation by
  ubiquination (proteosomal degradation). The Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway is regulated
  by several inhibitors, among which are Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk-1) and sclerostin,
  that prevent Wnt from binding to its receptor complex. Glucocorticoids enhance the
  expression of Dickkopf and sclerostin by osteocytes and maintain GSK 3-β in an active
  state, leading to the inactivation of β-catenin.
