caption: Figure 1. Proposed mechanism of JAK-STAT involvement in atopic dermatitis
  (AD) development, part I. Skin barrier function defects are critical for the development
  of AD. In addition to the filaggrin gene mutation defects in some AD patients, IL-4
  is also able to downregulate barrier proteins filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin
  through the JAK-STAT pathway making the epidermis more penetrable by allergens and
  pathogens. Once penetrated through the epidermis, allergens/pathogens are detected
  by dendritic cells, which become subsequently activated to present these antigens
  to naïve Th0 cells. The Th0 cell can then differentiate into the Th2 cell through
  the JAK1,3-STAT6 pathway under the influence of IL-4. In the Th0 cells, the STAT6
  pathway can also upregulate GATA3, a master regulator of Th2 cells. GATA3 in turn
  suppresses Foxp3, the master regulator in Treg cells, thus allowing more T cells
  to be activated. Black arrows indicate activation pathway. Red lines indicate inhibition
  pathway.
