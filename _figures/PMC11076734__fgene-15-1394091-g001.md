caption: 'Auxin concentration in the cell is regulated by three different pathways:
  biosynthesis, transport, and signal transduction. Cytosolic biosynthesis is mainly
  performed by the TAA1/YUC pathway. Auxin concentration in the cell can be modulated
  through PIN and ABCB membrane proteins. The auxin signal is transduced through the
  mediation of ARF-AUX/IAA transcription factors'
