caption: Activation of the cGAS–STING pathway in cells. cGAS is stimulated by foreign
  double-stranded DNA, mtDNA in the cytoplasm, and phagocytosed DNA. Occupation of
  the substrates ATP and GTP catalyzes the formation of cGAMP via the induction of
  cGAS, which subsequently binds to STING located on the ER membrane. The incorporation
  of cGAMP into STING facilitates the trafficking of STING to the Golgi apparatus.
  Over the course of translocation, STING recruits and activates TBK1, which subsequently
  catalyzes the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 and, to a lesser
  extent, of NF-κB, resulting in the increased synthesis of IFN, along with other
  inflammatory molecules
