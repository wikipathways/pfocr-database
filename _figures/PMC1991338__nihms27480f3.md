caption: Representation of the dual effects of zinc in Bax-associated induction of
  mitochondrial apoptogenesis in malignant prostate cells. Pathway 1 represents an
  effect of zinc on Bax expression that increases the cellular level of Bax (TF=transcription
  factor). Pathway 2 represents the effect of zinc on the mitochondrial insertion
  and oligomerization of Bax that leads to pore formation for the release of cytochrome
