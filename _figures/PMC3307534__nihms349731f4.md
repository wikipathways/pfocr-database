caption: The KIT/KITLG pathway in primordial and small primary follicles participates
  in oocyte viability and survival. Kit ligand (KITLG) produced by the granulosa cells
  binds to KIT (tyrosine kinase receptor) on the oocyte. Binding of KITLG to KIT leads
  to activation of protein kinase activity, KIT autophosphorylation, followed by a
  series of cellular responses via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling
  pathway. Active PI3K signals to 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1),
  which phosphorylates and activates the protein kinase AKT. pAKT then translocates
  to the nucleus and activates a variety of pathways important for inhibition of apoptosis
  and promotion of cell survival.
