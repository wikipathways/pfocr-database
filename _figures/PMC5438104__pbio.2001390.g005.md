caption: 'The log2 (fold change [intestine/inoculum]) in the number of transposon
  insertions within C. jejuni genes encoding enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, gluconeogenesis, and the acetate switch pathways are shown and are derived
  from the raw data in . Values below −6.2 indicate mutations that led to a statistically
  significant colonization defect. *: denotes genes showing a limited number of insertions
  within the library and no insertions within the pooled of mutants recovered from
  the intestine. The red arrows denote that the number of insertions within the gene
  involved in the indicated reaction was significantly reduced within the pool of
  mutants recovered from the mouse intestine (relative to the inoculum). Green arrows
  indicate that the enzyme that catalyzes the corresponding reaction does not have
  an insertional mutant in our mutant library. Enzymes not encoded in the C. jejuni
  genome are indicated with an “X.” The inset depicts the overall 13C-excess and relative
  fractions of 13C-labeled isotopologues in free and bound glucose or galactose (as
  indicated) derived from C. jejuni 81–176 cell surface carbohydrates after cultivation
