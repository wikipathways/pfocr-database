caption: Immune dysfunction of psoriasis. Psoriasis is driven by many nonspecific
  triggers. Triggers such as infections and physical injury stimulate DCs to release
  pro-inflammatory factors (IL-23, TNF-α and IL-12). These cytokines in turn activate
  the IL-23 and/or IL-22 pathway to induce Th17 and/or Th22 cell differentiation,
  resulting in the production of numerous psoriatic cytokines, such as TNF-α, IFN-γ,
  IL-17 and IL-22, which act on keratinocytes to amplify psoriatic inflammation. In
  addition, skin infiltrating cells, such as γδT cells, contribute to the disease
  development via producing IL-17, and Treg cells and the Th17/Treg balance also play
  important roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
