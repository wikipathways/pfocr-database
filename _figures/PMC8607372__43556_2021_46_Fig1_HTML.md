caption: Cytosolic viral RNA sensing. The RLR family members MDA5 and RIG-I preferentially
  recognize long dsRNA and 5′- triphosphate short dsRNA, respectively. RIG-I can also
  recognize circular RNA synthesized in vitro and derived from virus. After RNA ligand
  binding, RIG-I and MDA5 undergo conformational changes that expose N-terminal CARDs
  to mediate downstream signaling. Riplet/TRIM25 or TRIM65-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination
  induces RIG-I and MDA5 activation, respectively. Both RIG-I and MDA5 can interact
  with MAVS on the outer membrane of mitochondria and activate MAVS to form signal
  platform, which further activates NFκB via the IKK complex or IRF3 via TBK1. DHX58
  is reported to facilitate MDA5 activation, whereas it drives the inactivation of
  RIG-I. Besides, DDX1-DDX21-DHX36 complex recognizes viral dsRNA and activates TRIF
  pathway. DDX19A senses viral RNA and activates NLRP3 inflammasome. DHX33 senses
  cytosolic viral dsRNA and interacts with MAVS to activate innate immune signaling.
  DDX60 is needed for the activation of RIG-I by binding to viral RNA. ADAR1 recognizes
  viral dsRNA suppresses dsRNA-induced signaling. LRRFIP1 recognizes dsRNA and L.
  monocytogenes dsDNA. Moreover, IFIT1 and IFIT5 can recognize 5′- triphosphate ssRNA
