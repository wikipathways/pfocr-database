caption: 'Overview of cellular metabolism. The major cellular metabolic pathways (indicated
  in red): glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, β-oxidation, TCA cycle and oxidative
  phosphorylation (OxPHOS). Each of these pathways produces metabolites that are required
  to fuel cell growth via the production of energy (ATP), nucleotides, lipids, amino
  acids and fatty acids (indicated in green). The most efficient pathway for the production
  of energy is OxPHOS, which produces significantly more ATP than glycolysis. Despite
  this difference, glycolysis is the main energy-producing pathway favored by pluripotent
  stem cells. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ATPase, ATP
  synthase; ETC, electron transport chain; F6P, fructose 6 phosphate; G6P, glucose
  6 phosphate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.'
