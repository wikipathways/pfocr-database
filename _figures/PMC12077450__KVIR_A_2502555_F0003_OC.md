caption: 'The role of CysLTs and their receptors in brain-gut-lung axis communication.
  Gut microbiota metabolites (e.g. short-chain fatty acids, bile acids) regulate systemic
  immunity via the gut-lung axis, with an anatomical basis rooted in the endodermal
  homology of the lungs and intestines. CysLTs exhibit dual roles in the gut-lung
  axis: in the gut, they enhance anti-helminth immunity by activating the tuft cell-ILC2
  pathway, while in the respiratory tract, they mediate leukotriene-dependent type
  2 allergic inflammation. Succinate, a key metabolite, synergizes with CysLTs in
  the gut to initiate immune defense but exacerbates gut-originated lung injury via
  the SUCNR1 pathway, suggesting CysLTs’ potential hub role in cross-organ inflammation.
  Bidirectional gut-brain communication involves immune cell migration, neural transmission,
  and microbiota metabolite regulation, where psychological stress and gut inflammation
  mutually disrupt neuroimmune homeostasis. Studies indicate that CysLTs may participate
  in gut-brain interactions by modulating brain decision-making circuits (e.g. inducing
  allergen-avoidance behaviors), and their receptor expression in neural nociceptive
  pathways implies conservation of related mechanisms in humans. (figure was created
