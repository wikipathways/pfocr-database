caption: 'Four different TME groups with potential implications for mechanism and
  therapy have been identified according to B7-H1 (PD-L1) expression and the presence
  of TILs in tumor biopsies: I, B7-H1-negative tumors without TILs, considered immunological
  ignorant because immune cells do not accumulate at the tumor site, II, B7-H1-positive
  tumors with TILs, considered a paradigm of adaptive resistance of tumors mediated
  by the B7-H1/PD-1 pathway, III, B7-H1-negative tumors with TILs, considered a situation
  of tolerance because TILs are present, but they do not induce B7-H1 expression in
  the tumor microenvironment through IFN-γ production, and IV, B7-H1-positive tumors
  without TILs, considered as a scenario of intrinsic induction of B7-H1 expression
  in tumor cells through oncogenic pathways that may be susceptible to be targeted.
  Groups I, III, and IV can be converted into group II through different strategies,
  synergizing with the action of anti-PD therapies that are more effective in the
  presence of TILs and B7-H1 expression.'
