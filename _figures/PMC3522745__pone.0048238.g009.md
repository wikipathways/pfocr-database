caption: IPA analysis of the top 100 probe-sets from heart and muscle gene clusters
  () showed the enrichment of calcium signalling pathway. In this figure, we have
  highlighted the genes present in this pathway in orange. Though this pathway is
  generalised for skeletal muscle contraction and cardiac muscle contraction, they
  differ in the members of the same gene family. The heart and muscle genes present
  in this pathway are given in  and . Pathway diagram was drawn using Path Designer
  function of IPA .
