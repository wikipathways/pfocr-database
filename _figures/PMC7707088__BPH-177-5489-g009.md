caption: 'Diagram showing GPCR signalling and functions in the epididymis and efferent
  ductules. Above: The efferent ductules are a series of tubules that connect the
  rete testis to the epididymis. The epithelia of the efferent ductules are mainly
  composed of two cell types, ciliated cells and non‐ciliated cells. The epididymis
  is composed of one highly convoluted tubule. The epididymis is segmented morphologically
  and functionally into following distinct regions: the initial segment (not existing
  in human epididymis), the caput, the corpus, and the cauda. Each part consists of
  several cell types, including principal cells, narrow cells, clear cells, and basal
  cells. Inset: GPER activates cAMP‐CFTR‐chloride transportation to maintain the osmotic
  pressure of the perfusion solution. ADGRG2 is located exclusively on the apical
  membrane in non‐ciliated cells. ADGRG2/β‐arrestin1/Gq/CFTR forms a supercomplex
  that maintains pH and chloride anion homeostasis. AT2 receptors are specifically
  detected in basal cells and are essential for the proton‐secretion function of the
  epididymal lumen through activation of the NO‐cGMP pathway. Different members of
  the adenosine receptor family have opposite effects on the contractility of the
  epididymis. LGR4 activates Gs to increase intracellular cAMP levels, which promote
  ERα expression'
