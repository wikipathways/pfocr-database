caption: Carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer cells and role of different miRNAs in
  cancer pathways. In the carcinogenesis of CRC, higher levels of miR-135a & miR-135b
  are associated with low levels of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) , which in turn
  leads to activation of the Wnt signalling pathway. Activation of the Wnt signalling
  pathway is a major tumour initiating event in the colonic epithelium. The low level
  of APC associated β-catenin degradation complex results in the formation of free
  cytoplasmic β-catenin that enters the nucleus and activates Wnt-regulated genes
  through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and
  concomitant recruitment of coactivators (Survivin, c-Myc and Cyclin D1). As a consequence,
  there is a lack of apoptosis and increase proliferation of abnormal cells that results
  in autonomous growth and formation of adenoma. During the course of carcinogenesis,
  cells in adenoma accumulate few other genetic alterations leading to activation
  of other signalling pathways e.g. mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), Phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinases (PI3K) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) pathways. The let-7
  miRNA family, miR-18a* and miR-143 are adept at inhibiting the KRAS translation
  hence switching “off” the MAPK phosphorylation and inactivation of downstream transcription
  factors c-Myc, c-Fos and c-Jun. Furthermore, a targeted degradation of PTEN and
  p85β by miR-21 and miR-126 respectively , blocks the PI3K-Akt pathway. These changes
  drive the early adenoma to a large advanced adenoma. The loss of p53 function is
  associated with low expression levels of miR-34a family, indicating the role of
  this miRNA family in the transformation of adenoma to the carcinoma.
