caption: GLP-1 stimulates glucose-dependent mitochondrial ATP production by initiating
  an increase of [Ca2+]i. In this model, the dual actions of GLP-1 to promote depolarization-induced
  Ca2+ influx and to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores result in an increase
  of intramitochondrial [Ca2+] and a stimulation of Ca2+-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases
  (). These dehydrogenases are components of the TCA cycle and NADH-linked shuttles.
  Modest changes of cytosolic [Ca2+], as do occur in response to CICR, produce a large
  increase of intramitochondrial [Ca2+] due to the activity of the mitochondrial uniporter
  Ca2+ transport mechanism. Therefore, the concentration of Ca2+ within the mitochondria
  reaches a level commensurate with the affinity of these dehydrogenases for Ca2+.
  Note that depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx in response to GLP-1 results from an
  inhibitory action of the hormone at KATP channels (). This effect is PKA mediated
  () and may also result from direct interactions of Epac with SUR1 (). The release
  of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores results from stimulatory actions of GLP-1
  at RYRs and IP3-Rs. Both types of Ca2+ release channels are regulated by PKA (,),
  whereas current evidence suggests a selective action of Epac at RYR (,). It has
  yet to be determined if the increase of [ATP]i measured in response to GLP-1 is
  of sufficient magnitude to result in the inhibition of KATP channels, thereby facilitating
  the triggering pathway of glucose-dependent insulin secretion. It is also not certain
  if ATP generated in this manner exerts a direct effect at the insulin secretory
  granules, thereby facilitating granule transport, priming, and exocytosis via the
  amplification pathway of insulin secretion.
