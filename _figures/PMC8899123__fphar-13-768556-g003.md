caption: 'Mechanism of action of drugs analyzed by molecular docking on the metabolic
  processes of CSCs. The ligands and targets have been investigated by molecular docking.
  Nine effective drugs, including compound #25, andrographolide, mitoketoscins, emetine,
  cortistatin, solamargine, solasonine, tylophorine, and CIN-RM are known to affect
  the biological processes and signaling pathways of CSCs. 1) Compound #25 prevents
  the assembly of the Skp2-SCF complex by binding to Skp2. Hence, it inhibits two
  pathways including non-proteolytic K63-linked ubiquitination of Akt and ubiquitination
  and degradation of p27, which ultimately inhibit the development of tumor features.
  2) Andrographolide increases intrinsic apoptosis in CSCs (especially in breast cancer)
  by inhibiting survivin, caspase-9, and caspase-3.3) Mitoketoscins stop the recycling
  of ketone bodies into Acetyl-CoA by inhibiting two proteins, including OXCT1 and
  ACAT1. Hence ATP production is stopped and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in
  CSCs is inhibited. 4) Emetine and 5) Cortistatin, can target CSCs by binding to
  sonic Hh, Smo and, gli protein. 6) Solamargine can affect sonic hedgehog and gli
  proteins by its pharmacophores. 7) Solasonine and 8) Tylophorine modulate the Hh
  pathway by affecting gli proteins. 9) CIN-RM can lead to upstream inhibition of
  the Akt pathway and reduction of CSCs markers, which decrease the expression level
  of transcription factors involved in self-renewal, such as c-Myc, Nanog, Oct4, and
  Sox2. CIN-RM can inhibit mTOR pathway. Abbreviations: ATP, Adenosine triphosphate;
