caption: 'Unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Upon ER stress, the ER launches
  three pathways collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) in an attempt
  to restore proteostasis: (A) IRE1 homodimerizes and autophosphorylates to promote
  the alternative splicing of Xbp1 mRNA into the Xbp1 spliced form (Xbp1s) transcript.
  After translation, the resulting Xbp1s transcription factor translocates to the
  nucleus of the cell to activate ER chaperones, ERAD components, and lipid biosynthesis
  factors. (B) PERK homodimerizes and autophosphorylates to induce eIF-2α phosphorylation
  ultimately leading to the upregulation of the transcription factor ATF4. This will
  result in subsequent upregulation of amino acid metabolism, stress response, and
  apoptosis. (C) ATF6 translocates to the Golgi where it is cleaved into its active
  form ATF6f and then moves to the nucleus to trigger the expression of ER chaperones,
  XBP-1, CHOP, and members of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Abbreviations:
  ATF, activating transcription factor; ATF6f, activating transcription factor 6 fragment;
  CHOP, C/EBP-homologous protein; eIF-2α, eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  2α; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; IRE1, inositol requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease-1;
  P, phosphate; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase; XBP-1 unspliced, X-box binding protein 1;
  XBP1s, XBP-1 spliced.'
