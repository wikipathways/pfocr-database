caption: Schematic illustration of examples of signal transduction pathways in astroglial
  cells following P2X7R activation. After channel opening the P2X7R is permeable for
  Na+, K+ and Ca2+. Activation of the P2X7R triggers the efflux of K+ from cells and
  activates IL-1 converting enzyme, leading to cleavage of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β
  and release from the cell. Many events downstream of P2X7R activation are dependent
  on extracellular calcium influx. Stimulation of ionotropic P2X7Rs leads to activation
  of phospholipases A2 and D (PLA2, D) and protein kinase C (PKC), e.g. resulting
  in the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) or the activation of caspase
  cascades. Furthermore, the induction of second messenger and enzyme cascades promoted
  e.g. the activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway proteins
  (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as well as PI3K/Akt activation.
  The activity of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), cyclic
  element-binding protein (CREB), and activator protein (AP-1) are also up-regulated,
  leading to the expression of proinflammatory genes, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
  or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); this in turn causes the production of
  arachidonic acid (AA) or nitric oxide (NO), respectively. Finally, the release of
  ATP via pannexin-1 (Panx1) hemichannels as well as of ATP and glutamate via P2X7Rs
  was also found to take place. The present data suggest that astroglial P2X7R stimulation
  is associated with neurological disorders leading to neuroinflammation, and apoptosis.
