caption: 'Presented are the phenylpropanoid-biosynthesis pathway and the heat map.
  Genes circled in red are significantly upregulated on the red side (RS) of the RF
  in response to C. gloeosporioides. Z-scores represent rescaled and normalized log2
  fold-change values. Enzymes in each step: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; TCMO,
  Trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; PER, Peroxidase;
  COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CHS, chalcone synthase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavanone 3′-hydroxylase; DRF, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase. GS, green side;
  GF, green fruit'
