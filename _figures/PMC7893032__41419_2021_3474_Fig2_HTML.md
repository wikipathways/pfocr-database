caption: Active inflammasomes lead to the cleavage and activation of caspase-1. The
  activated caspase-1 cleaves Gasdermin D (GSDMD). The N-fragment of GSDMD form cell
  membrane pores resulting in pyroptosis. Activated caspase-1 also promotes the maturation
  and secretion of interleukins IL-1β and IL-18. When pathogen-derived lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) binds to the precursor of caspase-4/5, it can also cause GSDMD cleavage and
  induction of pyroptosis. Another way to activate pyroptosis is caspase-3/Gasdermin
  E (GSDME) pathway. Caspase-3 can also be activated by mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization (MOMP) and death receptor pathways. The activated caspase-3 then
  cleaves GSDME and produces GSDME N-fragments, The N-fragment of GSDME form cell
  membrane pores resulting in pyroptosis. Pyroptosis results in membrane rupture and
  the release of DAMPs that are detected by phagocyte receptors, such as TIM 4 (T
  cell immunoglobulin mucin receptor 4), BAI 1 (brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor
  1), stabilin-2 and TAM (Tryo3-Axl-Mer receptor). DAMPs recognition leads to the
  production of pro-inflammatory interleukins (e.g. IL-1, IL-6) and IL-12, which activates
  NK cells and induces the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells. The pyroptotic signalling
  pathways are significantly influenced by HPV infection and by the genetic background
  of HNSCC. Green bubbles indicate activation and pink inhibition of the process.
