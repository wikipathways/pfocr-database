caption: 'Enrichment for pyruvate metabolism pathway in input datasets. A solid line
  presents a chemical reaction controlled by one or more enzyme. A dot line indicates
  adjacent metabolic pathway. Each Uniprot entry is divided by four squares, each
  representing a log2FC for a comparison between contaminated and reference plots,
  from left to right: K × B, K × L, M × B, M × L. The top line of the Uniprot entry
  is transcriptomic input, and bottom part is proteomic. The blue colour of a square
  reflects downregulation, and red—upregulation. If a biological feature is significant
  for any of the omics data layers, it is highlighted by a thicker border and a red
  mark at the top right corner. A single databox can represent one or more biological
  features, where only the entry of the most significant feature will be shown. In
  this case, a green mark in the bottom right corner indicates one or more hidden
  features that share functions or contribute equally to the biological process. The
  metabolomic data can be seen as red or blue spots in the white circles, where usually,
  red means upregulation, and blue—downregulation. For more detailed data, please
  refer to . The figure was created with PaintOmics 4.'
