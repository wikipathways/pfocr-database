caption: 'A physiological model of gait and pathophysiological model of freezing of
  gait (FoG). The normal control of gait requires coordinated activity between the
  cortex, the basal ganglia (BG), and the cerebellum to modulate the brainstem locomotor
  regions’ output. In a healthy system (a), an efficient initiation, execution, and
  termination of the desired movement are achieved via the excitation of the target
  motor plan (direct pathway) and the inhibition of competing motor plans (hyper-direct
  and indirect pathways). Before activating a target motor system, the baseline inhibition
  is increased in this system via the hyper-direct pathway that projects directly
  from the SMA to the STN. The target system is later released from this inhibition
  through its excitation via the striatum’s direct pathway to the GPi, resulting in
  the initiation and execution of the planned movement. The cessation of the movement
  is mediated by the target motor system’s re-inhibition via the indirect pathway
  from the striatum to the GPe and STN. This coordinated excitation and inhibition
  allow the BG to modulate the motor output of the locomotor regions in the brainstem
  and cerebellum to produce the desired movement. However, in Parkinson’s disease
  (b) this coordination is compromised, leading to a sustained over-inhibition (increased
  inhibition via the hyper-direct and indirect pathways, and decreased disinhibition
  via the direct pathway) of the brainstem structures via the GPi/SNr that hinders
  the initiation and execution of movement resulting in FoG. FoG can occur at the
  initiation stage (possibly due to sustained baseline inhibition via the hyper-direct
  pathway and decreased direct pathway disinhibition) or during an ongoing movement
  (possibly due to temporally abrupt re-inhibition via the indirect pathway and decreased
  disinhibition of direct pathway). CLR: cerebellar locomotor region, CMA: cingulate
