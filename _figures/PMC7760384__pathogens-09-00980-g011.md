caption: The sulfate starvation response proteins are enriched in the Δbfd cells.
  (A) Schematic representation of the sulfate starvation-induced proteins. The relative
  abundances (Δbfd/wt) of each of the proteins in the pathway is color coded according
  to the log2 FC scale; proteins that require iron to function are encased. (B) Proteins
  for the biosynthesis of sulfur-containing cofactors are affected in the Δbfd cells.
