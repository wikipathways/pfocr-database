caption: Administration of the BRAFV600E inhibitor leads to three phases of ERK activity.
  The corresponding states of the underlying molecular mechanism for each phase are
  shown. The dominating interactions at each phase are marked by bold arrows. High
  activity levels of signaling molecules are shown in bold colored circles, while
  low activity levels are marked by faint circles.
