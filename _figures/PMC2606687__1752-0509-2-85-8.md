caption: Model correction examples. Examples of model corrections performed between
  iAbaylyiv2 (left) and iAbaylyiv3 (right) models. Metabolites are depicted by blue
  circles and triangles, triangles indicating essential biomass precursors. Reactions
  are represented by arrows colored in red if they are predicted essential and in
  green if they are predicted dispensable. Gene names are indicated next to reaction
  arrows; they are written in red if they are experimentally essential and in green
  if they are dispensable. Genes with inconsistent predictions are written in bold
  italic. Dashed boxes indicate components that have been modified. Further evidence
  for model corrections are shown in main text and Additional file . (A) First steps
  of histidine biosynthesis. Unpredicted essentiality of ACIAD2907 encoding for ribose-phosphate
  diphosphokinase activity was corrected by removing the alternate gene ACIAD0964
  from the reaction GPR. Unpredicted essentialities of ACIAD0661 and ACIAD1257, catalyzing
  the ATP phosphoribosyltransferase reaction, were corrected by assigning them as
  complex subunits instead of isozymes in the reaction GPR. (B) Isoprenoids biosynthesis.
  Unpredicted dispensability of ACIAD2968, catalyzing farnesyl-diphosphate and geranyl-diphosphate
  synthases activities, was corrected by adding ACIAD1374 (undecaprenyl-diphosphate
  synthase) and ACIAD2940 (octaprenyl-diphosphate synthase) as isozymes. Unpredicted
  essentiality of ACIAD1374 was resolved by adding undecaprenyl-PP to the set of essential
  biomass precursors. (C) Synthesis of charged glutamine-tRNA(gln) and asparagine-tRNA(asn).
  Unpredicted essentiality of ACIAD1920, encoding for glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase activity,
  was corrected by removing from the model the alternate pathway using aspartyl/glutamyl-tRNA
  amidotransferase enzyme (ACIAD0822-0824). (D) Biosynthesis of polysaccharides. Unpredicted
  dispensabilities of all genes involved in GDP-mannose, UDP-glucose, and dTDP-rhamnose
  synthesis were corrected by removing these three metabolites from the list of essential
  biomass precursors.
