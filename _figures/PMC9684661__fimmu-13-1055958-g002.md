caption: Vitiligo immunometabolism promising targets. CD8+ T cells in vitiligo lesions
  can produce a variety of cytokines, including IFN-γ. Elevated levels of IFN-γ disrupt
  glucose metabolism and promote melanocyte apoptosis. IFN-γ binds with IFNgR, activates
  the JAK-STAT pathway, and leads to the secretion of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in the skin.
  JAK-STAT signaling pathway activation plays a vital role in various metabolic disorders
  and can be treated with JAK inhibitors (e.g. ruxolitinib) acting on JAK1 and JAK2.
  CXCL9 promotes massive recruitment of melanocyte-specific CD8+ T cells to the skin
  via the cognate receptor CXCR3, while CXCL10 promotes their localization within
  the epidermis and their effector functions, which increases inflammation through
  a positive feedback loop. Activation of CXCR3B by CXCL10 induces apoptosis of melanocytes.
  However, depleting antibodies acting on CXCR3 could reduce the number of C8+ T cells,
  thereby reversing the disease. In addition, flavonoids act by activating the Nrf2/ARE
  signaling pathway and inhibiting NFκB activation by reducing the extent of oxidative
  stress in melanocytes. Established vitiligo lesions are maintained by melanocyte-reactive
  TRM cells that maintain longevity in the skin via IL-15-dependent survival signals.
  TRM is linked to lipid metabolism due to their reliance on exogenous free fatty
  acid (FFA) uptake to maintain their residence in the skin. The use of antibodies
  against CD122, the β subunit of the IL-15 receptor, in a mouse model of vitiligo
  effectively inhibits TRM production. IL-15 and its receptor may be a target for
  vitiligo treatment. CXCR3, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3; CXCL9/10, C-X-C motif
