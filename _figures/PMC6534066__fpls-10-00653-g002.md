caption: Cell Cycle regulation in response to DNA damage. Under normal conditions,
  protein accumulation of repressive MYB3Rs (rep-MYB3R) is restricted to S-phase during
  which they repress the transcription of G2 genes including CYCBs and CDKBs. Rep-MYB3R
  accumulation is kept low during G2 to M through phosphorylation of these transcription
  factors by CYCB/CDKB complexes, leading to their degradation by the proteasome (shaded
  shapes and arrows). Upon DNA damage, SOG1 regulates the intra S and G2/M checkpoint
  by targeting the core cell cycle genes WEE1, SMR5 and 7 and APC/C sub-units, and
  by indirectly controlling the accumulation of rep-MYB3Rs. How SOG1 acts on MYB3Rs
  degradation remains to be fully elucidated, but this pathway involved direct up-regulation
  of the genes encoding the ANAC044 and ANAC085 transcription factors. These two proteins
  influence repressive MYB3R accumulation through a mechanism that remains to be elucidated,
  although reduction of CYCB/CDKB complexes accumulation and activity likely contributes
  to this process by reducing MYB3R phosphorylation. WEE1 can inhibit S-phase progression
  by inhibiting the activity of CYCA/CDKA complexes. WEE1 and SMR5 and 7 can also
  inhibit the activity of CYCB1/CDKB complexes directly, whereas MYB3R and APC/C control
  the accumulation of the complex. Together, all these mechanisms contribute to lowering
  the activity of mitotic CDKs, leading to G2 arrest or endoreduplication. In addition
  to these SOG1-dependent mechanisms, E2Fa/RBR complexes likely contribute to the
  activation of cell cycle checkpoints possibly by regulating WEE1 or CYC and CDK
  genes, but their role remains to be fully elucidated. On this figure, red arrows
  indicate direct transcriptional regulations whereas black arrows indicate indirect
  regulations.

    protein accumulation of repressive MYB3Rs (rep-MYB3R) is restricted to S-phase

    Rep-MYB3R accumulation is kept low during G2 to M through phosphorylation of these

    How SOG1 acts on MYB3Rs degradation remains to be fully elucidated, but this pathway
    involved direct up-regulation of the genes encoding the ANAC044 and ANAC085 transcription
