caption: Non-canonical WNT signalling pathways involve the planar cell polarity pathway
  (part a) and the Ca2+-dependent pathway (part b). Both pathways are initiated by
  binding of a WNT ligand to WNT receptors, such as Frizzled (FZD) receptors, the
  tyrosine-protein kinase transmembrane receptors ROR1 and ROR2, and tyrosine-protein
  kinase RYK, which belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (also known
  as seven-transmembrane receptors), with the potential contribution of various co-receptors.
  Binding of WNT ligands to secreted FZD-related proteins (SFRPs) blocks the WNT–receptor
  interaction. The downstream events involved in the planar cell polarity pathway
  are not well defined, but include Dishevelled (DVL) and lead to GTP-dependent activation
  of small GTPases, such as RAC1 and RHOA, which in turn activate JUN N-terminal kinase
  (JNK), and ultimately regulate cell polarity and motility and gene transcription.
  The Ca2+-dependent pathway involves activation of PLC and protein kinase C (PKC),
  which leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, triggering the activation
  of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and the nuclear factor
  of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway, leading to transcriptional regulation.
