caption: A schematic model for how S6K1 inhibits TLR2- or TLR4-mediated signaling
  pathways. Upon stimulation of TLR2 or TLR4 receptors, MyD88 binds to the cytoplasmic
  portion of the TLRs through interactions between individual TIR domains. IRAKs,
  such as IRAK-4 and IRAK-1, and TRAF6 are recruited to the receptor, and then phosphorylated
  IRAK-1 (by IRAK-4) dissociates from the receptor together with TRAF6. TRAF6 further
  interacts with TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2. TAB1 also interacts with p38α through its p38α-binding
  domain. TAB1 plays several roles in the regulation of the TAK1 complex, such as
  the recruitment of p38α MAPK to the TAK1 complex for the phosphorylation of TAB1
  and induction of TAK1 catalytic activity. The activated TAK1 eventually induces
  the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors through activation of the
  IKK complex and MAP kinases, respectively. In this study, we speculate on the inhibitory
  role of S6K1 in type 2 diabetes, inducing insulin resistance under conditions of
  nutrient overload. Under high-nutrient conditions, S6K1 acts as a negative regulator
  in insulin signaling. Simultaneously, S6K1 interacts with TAK1, which results in
  the inhibition of the association of TAB1 and p38α to TAK1. The inhibitory effect
  eventually induces the inhibition of NF-κB and AP-1 activation by the suppression
  of IKKs and p38/JNK activation, respectively.
