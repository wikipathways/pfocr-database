caption: 'Interaction network showing miRNAs and their predicted and validated targets.
  The protein interaction network (light gray lines) shows the interaction between
  proteins (ellipses) encoded by tumor necrosis factor-α pathway genes. Green triangles
  and solid gray lines represent miRNAs and validated target genes, respectively;
  red triangles and dotted gray lines represent predicted relationship between miRNA
  and target genes, respectively. TNF: Tumor necrosis factor.'
