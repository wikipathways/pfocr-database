caption: Schematic diagrams showing the roles of ATP and P2X receptors in the micturition
  pathway. (a) Mechanical distension or damage to the urothelium causes release of
  ATP, and this release is augmented in disease states such as interstitial cystitis,
  benign prostate hyperplasia, or spinal cord injury. ATP acts on P2X3 and P2X2/3
  receptors on the peripheral terminals of Aδ- and C-bladder afferents, where it may
  convey mechanosensory and nociceptive information to the spinal cord. (b) At the
  central terminals of primary sensory afferents within the dorsal horn of the spinal
  cord, ATP may be coreleased with glutamate. P2X receptors are expressed on both
  presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes. Presynaptic P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors are
  thought to be important in facilitating glutamate release. In addition, P2X4 and
  P2X7 receptors present on microglia may mediate inflammatory responses, thus contributing
  to hyperexcitability at these synapses. (c) Excitation of parasympathetic efferents
  causes corelease of ATP with acetylcholine from the nerve terminal. These neurotransmitters
  act on P2X1 and muscarinic (M3) receptors, respectively, present on the postjunctional
  membrane to cause detrusor smooth muscle contraction.
