caption: Different optimum redox balancing strategies for Accumulibacter under anaerobic
  conditions. (A) When little glycogen is degraded and is not enough to reduce all
  acetate to PHB, the glyoxylate shunt as recommended previously () is the most optimal
  way to provide electrons required for the PHB pathway. (B) When the stoichiometric
  amount of glycogen is degraded for acetate reduction to PHB, there is no need to
  operate any part of the TCA cycle to balance redox and only PHB is then produced,
  as proposed previously (). (C) When more glycogen than needed for acetate reduction
  is degraded, the reductive TCA branch can be used as proposed previously () for
  GAOs to sink electrons in more reduced PHAs (e.g., PHV and PH2MV). These flux distributions
  are unique; at the optimum (minimal CO2 production), no flux variability is observed
  (see Document S5).
