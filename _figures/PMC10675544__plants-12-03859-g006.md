caption: Ascorbate (Asc) plays dual roles in the response of plants to salinity. On
  the one hand, Asc can scavenge ROS, protect plants from oxidative damage and enhance
  salinity stress tolerance. On the other hand, Asc inhibits ROS signaling. Under
  salt stress, overexpression of OsJAB1 increases the ascorbate content in rice, which
  can scavenge more ROS and delay ROS accumulation, in turn inhibiting the salt stress
  response of rice through the ROS signaling pathway that activates the expression
  of ROS-scavenging genes and impairs salinity stress tolerance. In contrast, impairing
  the expression of OsJAB1 helps rice quickly accumulate ROS, which can effectively
  activate the rice ROS-scavenging system and enhance rice salinity stress tolerance
