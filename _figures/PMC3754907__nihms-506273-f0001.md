caption: The endosomal network and the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) pathway. Non-polarized

  description: The endosomal network and the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) pathway.
    Non-polarized cells (a) have a simpler endosomal system than polarized cells (b).
    (a) Newly synthesized proteins are transported from the trans-Golgi (TGN) network
    to the plasma membrane (green and blue arrows). Clustering of proteins into lipid
    rafts (blue) or interaction of specific motifs in the proteins with clathrin adaptors
    (green) act as sorting signals. Recycling of endocytosed membrane proteins occurs
    from early endosomes [also known as sorting endosomes, (EE/SE)] and recycling
    endosomes (RE, orange arrows). Proteins destined for degradation are sorted into
    membrane invaginations of the EE/SE. These intralumenal vesicle-containing regions
    of the EE/SE eventually mature into late endosomes, also known as multivesicular
    bodies (LE/MVBs). Ubiquitylation of proteins and the ESCRT machinery helps to
    sort cargo into LE/MVBs and might also participate in their biogenesis [,]. Not
    all ILVs are destined for lysosomal degradation. Fusion of ILVs with the late
    endosomal limiting membrane, a process called ‘back-fusion’, is essential for
    the cytoplasmic delivery of certain proteins and viruses []. In many cells, the
    limiting membrane of LE/MVBs fuses with the plasma membrane, releasing ILVs into
    the extracellular space; these vesicles are now referred to as exosomes. (b).
    Epithelial cells have distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains separated
    by tight junctions (brown), and a complex endosomal system that is essential for
    the establishment and maintenance of polarity []. In the biosynthetic route, at
    the TGN, specific signals help to sort proteins into carrier vesicles that are
    transported to either the apical or the basolateral membrane. GPI-anchors or association
    with lipid rafts transport proteins to the apical domain (blue) and proteins containing

    transported to the basolateral domain (green) []. In the endocytic route, apical
    and basolateral proteins are first internalized into early apical or basolateral

    pathways have been shown to intersect at the level of late endosomes in epithelial
    cells []; however, because exosomes released apically have a different protein
    composition from those released at the basolateral surface [,], it is also possible
    that different populations of MVBs generate exosomes destined for apical or basolateral
    release (see text and  for a discussion on polarized sorting into exosomes).
