caption: 'Alterations of mitochondrial metabolic pathways and therapeutic targets
  for PAH treatment. Under normal conditions, glucose is converted to pyruvate via
  glycolysis. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria, where it is oxidized in the TCA cycle
  to generate ATP. In PAH, pyruvate is utilized for lactate production. The production
  of lactate in the presence of oxygen is known as “aerobic glycolysis” or the Warburg
  effect. In aerobic glycolysis, excess glucose uptake is diverted through PPP. Glutamine
  is another fuel source, which enters the mitochondria to replenish TCA intermediates
  and mobilize cellular energy, carbon, and nitrogen. FAs are the main energy source
  in the healthy adult heart. FA synthesis is started with the formation of malonyl-CoA
  by carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. Increased FAO inhibits glucose oxidation. HIF activates
  the transcription of genes encoding metabolic enzymes that mediate the glycolytic
  pathway. Red indicates increase, and blue indicates reduction. Abbreviations: ACACA,
