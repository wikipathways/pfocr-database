caption: 'Sox2 and Pax6 acted in Shh, Notch and VEGFA pathway for cell differentiation
  of spinal cord, forebrain neuron differentiation, and regulation of neural precursor
  cell proliferation. In Shh signaling, Shh is positively regulated by transcription
  factor encoded genes Gli1 and Gli2 and negatively modulated by Gli3. In VEGFA pathway,
  VEGFA generally activates Prox1 that up-regulated Sox2 and Pax6, and suppresses
  Notch1. Notch signaling indirectly modulates Sox2 and Pax6 through Shh, VEGFA and
  Prox1. In exposure to BPA, Shh down-regulated Sox2 through Pax6 antagonism, and
  IGF1 attenuated VEGFA expression and its down-stream genes. Shh: Sonic hedgehog;
  VEGFA: vascular endothelial growth factor A; IGF1: insulin-like growth factor 1;
  Green line: activation; blue line: binding; yellow line: expression; yellow line
  with a red bar: antagonizing.'
