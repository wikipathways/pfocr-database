caption: Schematic illustration of CCL21/CCR7 signalling-mediated lymphatic metastasis
  in B16F10 cells treated with PTX. A. Lymphatic metastasis occurred in B16F10 melanoma
  through CCL21/CCR7 signalling pathway. B. PTX treatment enhanced the expression
  of CCR7 in B16F10 melanoma cells, which facilitated B16F10 cell migration through
  the activation of JNK and p38 signalling pathways, resulting in enhanced lymphatic
  metastasis in B16F10 melanoma cells. C. Blocking the CCL21/CCR7 signalling pathway
  through CCR7 mAb efficiently abolished lymphatic metastasis of B16F10 tumour cells
  induced by PTX treatment.
