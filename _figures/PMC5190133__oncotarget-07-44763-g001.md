caption: 'The two major apoptosis signaling pathways to induce apoptotic cell death
  are shown: extrinsic (death receptor mediated) apoptosis pathways and intrinsic
  (mitochondrial mediated) apoptosis pathways. In extrinsic pathway, cell apoptosis
  is initiated by binding of death ligands and death receptors. Next, the death-inducing
  siganalling complex (DISC) is assembled and caspase-8/10 is activated. In intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway, cell apoptosis is induced by a variety of intracellular stimuli,
  including damages, growth factor deprivation or oxidative stress. The cytochrome
  C is released from the mitochondria resulting in the formation of the apoptosome
  and activation of caspase-9. The activated caspase-8 and 9 trigger the execution
  of apoptosis by activating the downstream caspase-3, 6 and 7. It has been reported
  in the literature, the agents, such as natural compounds, miRNA and proteins are
  effective to promote or block cell apoptosis in treatment of osteosarcoma.'
