caption: Schematic representation of various cell fates upon Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  infection. The figure depicts the Mtb proteins that are demonstrated to translocate
  to mitochondria and their role in induction or inhibition of cell death modalities.
  The proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates that are either secreted or on the surface
  of Mtb are recognized by host pattern recognition receptors (majorly TLR2). The
  several proteins secreted by Mtb target various host organelles, of which mitochondria
  is a crucial target. Specific Mtb proteins, as discussed in the text, are reported
  to translocate to the mitochondrial membrane, wherein they cause a change in MMP,
  leading to Cytochrome C release and, subsequently, apoptosis. The specific pathway
  differs for each Mtb protein with differences in the source of perturbation, such
  as the generation of ROS, changes in Ca2+ dynamics, and mitochondrial fission. Some
  proteins are not reported to translocate to mitochondria, but their activities ripple
  their effect on mitochondria, such as TNT, which causes NAD+ depletion leading to
  increased ROS generation in mitochondria. The receptors, including TLR, TNF, IL-1R,
  NOD, signal through various combinations of adaptor proteins that result in specific
  signaling pathways and diverse outcomes such as apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis,
  and autophagy as described in the text. The figure depicts the Mtb proteins that
  are demonstrated to translocate to mitochondria and their role in the induction
  or inhibition of cell death modalities. One of the several Mtb proteins that inhibit
  apoptosis by interacting with mitochondrial mortalin is Cpn60.2. (H). LpqH (A) and
  PE_PGRS33 (D) interact with TLR2 (C) and induces apoptosis through TNF-α. In the
  intracellular milieu, Mtb factors upon translocation to mitochondria and causes
  a change in MMP and leads to apoptosis (E). Mtb lipids such as Man-LAM can bind
  to TLR2/CD36 and signal PPAR- γ resulting in proinflammatory cytokines (B). HBHA
  is another secreted Mtb protein that causes apoptosis by changing MMP (G). LprG
  causes changes in Ca2+ dynamics and mitochondrial fission that leads to MMPT and,
  thus, apoptosis (F). One of the secreted proteins, TNT, hydrolyzes NAD resulting
  in the accumulation of ROS, and finally, necroptosis (I). The major secreted virulent
  protein, ESAT-6, causes ER stress that is transferred to mitochondria and finally
  culminating in apoptosis (J). It may be noted that the early phase of infection
  is dominated by either apoptosis that leads to bacterial clearance or anti-apoptosis
  that promotes bacterial survival and growth (M1). Once Mtb survives the host pro-inflammatory
  responses, it takes over by modulating the host metabolism by anti-inflammatory
  cytokines and alterations in lipid metabolism that inhibit apoptosis and autophagy
  coinciding with the M2 phase. As cell death is one of the major outcomes of perturbation
  in mitochondrial activities with or without getting targeted by mycobacterial factors,
  for a comprehensive list of cell death modulators from Mtb, please refer (Mohareer
  et al., ). The mycobacterial proteins are marked in purple boxes. The figure has
  been made using the Biorender app.
