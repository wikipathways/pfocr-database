caption: Adaptive metabolic changes during S. aureus infection promote chronic infection.
  (A). During skin infection, S. aureus SCVs adapt to local fumarate accumulation
  by overexpressing fumC to degrade it. This helps sustain glycolysis, given the role
  of fumarate as a glycolytic inhibitor. Fumarate degradation is also detrimental
  to the host and abrogates trained immunity, promoting recurrent infections. (B).
  During staphylococcal bone infection, which is often chronic, S. aureus adapts to
  the excess glutamate in the infected tissues by stimulating glycolysis and aspartate
  biosynthesis, both critical pathways for staphylococcal survival in this milieu.
  Staphylococcal gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle were dispensable
  for survival during osteomyelitis. (C). S. aureus biofilms stimulate a metabolic
  bias in recruited monocytes, favoring oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) over glycolysis
  and facilitating their anti-inflammatory activity and biofilm persistence. This
  metabolic bias is stimulated by S. aureus biofilm-derived lactate, which promotes
  the production of anti-inflammatory IL-10, by inhibiting histone deacetylase HDAC11
  and causing unchecked HDAC6 activity and increased histone acetylation at the Il-10
  promoter. Host-related activities are shown in black font and staphylococcal activities
  are shown in orange font.
