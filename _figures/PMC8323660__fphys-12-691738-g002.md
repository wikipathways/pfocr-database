caption: Overview of the epigenetic changes in ASH. Metabolic pathways regulated by
  acetaldehyde, cytokine, and FFA are induced by excessive alcohol drinking and chronic
  over- nutrition. Excessive alcohol drinking and chronic over-nutrition synergistically
  induces ASH progression via activating several different signaling pathways in the
  liver, including epigenetic changes. Additionally, hepatic cytokine and FFA levels
  of cytokines are induced as a result of the associated multiple organ damages, such
  as those in the adipose tissue, brain, intestines, and muscles. Eventually, this
  pathway increases hepatic inflammation and hepatocyte lipotoxicity, which result
  in the stimulation of ASH.
