caption: Signaling pathways targeted in cancer therapies. Hedgehog, Wnt/β-catenin,
  and Notch signaling are developmental pathways that are activated in multiple forms
  of cancer, rendering them promising therapeutic targets. (A) Hedgehog signaling
  pathway. In the absence of SHH, PTCH receptor inhibits SMO. SUFU sequesters GLI1
  in the cytoplasm resulting in inactive Hh signaling. SHH binding to PTCH receptor
  ① lifts its inhibition of SMO ②. Activated SMO sequesters SUFU ③, resulting in translocation
  of GLI1 to the nucleus ④ and transcription of target genes. Targeted cancer therapeutics
  include Robotnikin that binds and inhibits SHH, SMO inhibitors Vismodegib and Sonidegib,
  and GLI1 inhibitor arsenic trioxide. (B) Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. PORCN
  palmitoylates WNTs in the endoplasmic reticulum of signal-sending cells ①. Secreted
  WNTs bind to FZD/LRP receptor complex on the surface of signal-receiving cells ②,
  resulting in dismantling of the degradation complex and release of β-catenin rather
  than its degradation ③. β-catenin then translocated to the nucleus and binds to
  T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors to induce
  the transcription of target genes ④. Anticancer drug LGK974 averts the activation
  of WNTs via inhibition of PORCN, while WNT inhibitors prevent binding to the receptors
  and vantictumab inhibits FZD proteins. (C) Notch signaling pathway. Interaction
  of delta-like (DLL) and jagged (JAG) ligands present on the surface of signal-sending
  cells with NOTCH receptors anchored in the membrane of signal-receiving cells ①
  results in extracellular S2 site cleavage by ADAM metalloproteases ②. Subsequent
  intramembrane S3 site cleavage by γ-secretases releases Notch intracellular domain
  (NICD) ③ that translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of target
  genes ④. Anticancer therapeutics have been developed to inhibit Notch ligands and
  receptors, as well as γ-secretases. Illustrations are modified from Servier Medical
