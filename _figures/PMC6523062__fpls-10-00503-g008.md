caption: Mitochondrial signal for the control of plant growth. Mitochondrial activity
  is transduced through SnRK1 and SOG1 to control plant growth. A low level of ATP
  caused by dysfunction or inhibition of the mitochondria will be sensed by SnRK1
  and trigger interaction with SOG1, a NAC-type transcription factor. This “ATP switch”
  will then cause phosphorylation of the SOG1 protein leading to its activation. Next,
  expression of cell-cycle related genes (CYCA3s or CYCD3;3) are increased to suppress
  plant cell growth. Therefore, as a result, low mitochondrial activity causes suppression
  of plant cell growth using ATP as the signal.
