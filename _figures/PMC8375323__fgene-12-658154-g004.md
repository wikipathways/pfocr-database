caption: Visual summary of TIMM17A alterations and biological interaction networks
  in breast carcinoma (cBioPortal). (A) OncoPrint of TIMM17A alterations in BRCA.
  The OncoPrint provides an overview of genomic alterations in TIMM17A affecting individual
  samples (columns) in BRCA from the TCGA dataset. The different types of genetic
  alterations are indicated by unique colors. (B) Network view of the TIMM17A neighborhood
  in BRCA. TIMM17A is the seed gene (indicated with thick border), and all other genes
  altered in BRCA are automatically identified Darker red indicates increased alteration
  frequency in BRCA. The interaction types are derived from the Biological Pathway
  Ex-change (BioPAX). The red connection indicates proteins are members of the same
  complex.
