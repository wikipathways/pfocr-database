caption: 'Summary of adducin signaling to desmosomes. Green lines and arrows symbolize
  adhesion-enhancing signaling, red lines and arrows denote signaling provoking loss
  of cell cohesion. Under physiologic conditions, adducin promotes Dsg3 incorporation
  into desmosomes. In this regard, RhoA signaling via Rho kinase may be required for
  adducin phosphorylation at Ser-726. Under conditions of PV-IgG incubation, both
  PKC and p38 MAPK are activated. Active p38 MAPK reduces RhoA activity and thereby
  disrupts RhoA-mediated desmosome assembly, which promotes Dsg3 depletion. PKC exhibits
  a dual function on cell cohesion: on one hand it promotes cell dissociation, which
  thus is similar to the function of p38 MAPK. On the other hand, PKC enhances keratinocyte
  cohesion via phosphorylation of adducin. However, this may be ineffective to block
  the effects of p38 MAPK. Nevertheless, exogenous activation of RhoA promotes the
  desmosome assembly pathway, which is then capable of preventing PV-IgG-induced cell
  cohesion loss.'
