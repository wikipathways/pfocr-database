caption: The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induced apoptosis pathway and the Fas-Fas
  ligand-mediated apoptosis pathway. The Fas, tumor necrosis factor receptor type
  1 and 2 (TNFR1 and TNFR2) localize in the cell membrane. Numerous adaptor proteins
  and signal transducing molecules are involved in signal transduction initiated by
  the binding of the Fas ligand (FasL) to Fas and TNF to TNFR1 and TNFR2, respectively
  , . cIAPs, cellular inhibitors of apoptosis; FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEKK, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase;
  TRADD, TNF receptor-associated death domain protein; TRAF2, TNF receptor-associated
  factor 2.
