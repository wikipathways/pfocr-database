caption: Model of the SIF2-mediated signaling pathway. Upon pathogen infection, SIF2
  binds a PAMP elicitor, resulting in the formation of the SIF2-elicitor-BAK1 complex.
  MEKK1 is phosphorylated by the activated kinase domain of BAK1 and/or SIF2, leading
  to the activation of MKK4/5 and, finally, MPK3/6. The active MPK3/6 then interacts
  with the downstream WRKY protein(s), which positively regulate(s) WRKY53. The phosphorylated
  MEKK1 also may interact with WRKY53 directly. WRKY53 and the other possibly involved
  WRKY proteins then induce the expression of resistance genes, ultimately leading
  to the activation of basal immunities, including callose deposition, ROS accumulation,
  and stomatal closure. Besides the SIF2-mediated signaling pathway, the other PRRs,
  such as FLS2 or EFR, also form a heterodimer with BAK1 and activate basal immunities
  through a similar signaling pathway. The SIF2-involved PTI pathway also may regulate
  calcium influx, and the increased amount of cytosolic calcium could induce the expression
  of pathogen resistance genes through the calcium-mediated signaling pathway via
  CDPKs, such as PHI1. The basal immunities also could be regulated by other mechanisms.
  For example, under the virulence pathogen infection, the ABA pathway could promote
  rapid stomatal closure. The verified steps and elements in this scheme are highlighted
  in red.
