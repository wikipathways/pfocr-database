caption: SUMOylation and SAFB2 in PDAC Progression. This schematic illustrates the
  role of SUMOylation in promoting PDAC progression and the therapeutic potential
  of its inhibition via TAK-981, which significantly reduces tumor cell proliferation.
  High Sscore cells exhibit genome variation, reduced immune infiltration, drug resistance,
  and activation of pathways such as EMT and angiogenesis. SAFB2, downregulated in
  PDAC, inhibits the progression of PDAC by suppressing the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling
  pathway, highlighting its tumor-suppressive function
