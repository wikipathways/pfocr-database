caption: The action mechanism of drugs used to inhibit extracellular vesicle release.
  Extracellular vesicles originate from the endosomal pathway or pinch off from the
  cell membrane. Exosomes are produced from MVBs by ESCRT-dependent and ESCRT-independent
  pathways. While manumycin A inhibits exosome dependent pathway, GW4869 inhibits
  exosome independent pathway. Microvesicle biogenesis is modulated by lipids and
  cytoskeletal proteins. Lipid rafts and cholesterol play an important role in the
  budding of cell membranes. Enzymes involved in the transfer of lipid from one leaflet
  of the cell membrane to the other are potentially targeted to inhibit exosome release.
  Calpeptin is a family of calcium-dependent neutral cytosolic cysteine protease inhibitors
  used as a micro-vesicular inhibitor. Y27632 is a competitive inhibitor of both ROCK1
  and ROCK2 and is able to compete with ATP in binding to the catalytic site of these
  kinases. This compound inhibits microvesicle release by blocking these two proteins.
  This compound reorganizes the cytoskeleton and mediates cellular contractility by
  regulating the activity of actin filaments. Imipramine is a well-known antidepressant
  that promotes membrane fluidity by inhibiting acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase), therefore
  preventing the generation of microvesicles. D-Pantethine inhibits cholesterol synthesis
  as well as fatty acid synthesis as the fluidity of the cell membrane is important
  during membrane bi-layer reorganization and microvesicle formation. This drug blocks
  the translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer surface membrane, which is
  an essential step of microvesicle formation. Cytochalasin D is an alkaloid produced
  as a toxin by many fungi. This compound binds the edges of actin filaments to prevent
  actin polymerization. Actin polymerization is essential for the formation of membrane-derived
  microvesicles and their intracellular movement.
