caption: Metabolic network of tumor response to Mitomycin C (MMC) treatment. Colored
  metabolites were detected using GC/LC-MS and those whose concentrations were increased
  in response to MMC treatment are highlighted in green and those that decreased in
  yellow. Several carnitine and (lyso)phospholipids were detected and they are colored
  to represent the average direction of percentage of change. Metabolites connected
  by a single reaction are indicated using solid lines and those connected using a
  dotted line are connected in the same pathway via a range of intermediate metabolites
  not shown.
