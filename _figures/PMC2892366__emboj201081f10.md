caption: A model for the function of GCN2, ATF4, ASNS and Asn in conferring tumour
  cell protection from microenvironment stress. Blue arrows indicate signalling primarily
  in response nutrient deprivation stress and green arrows indicate signalling primarily
  from hypoxic stress. Common pathways are indicated by black arrows. ATF4 likely
  has additional functions in response to hypoxia that are not depicted here.
papertitle: The GCN2-ATF4 pathway is critical for tumour cell survival and proliferation
  in response to nutrient deprivation.
