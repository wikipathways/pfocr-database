caption: Scheme of the cell wall biosynthetic pathway and its inhibition by bacitracin.
  The lipid II cycle of cell wall biosynthesis is responsible for the translocation
  of PG precursors across the cytoplasmic membrane and represents the rate-limiting
  step in this process. The cytoplasmic production of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (M)
  from UDP-GlcNAc (G) is catalyzed by the MurA to -F ligases. Subsequently, at the
  internal leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane the translocase MraY and the transferase
  MurG sequentially attach UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and UDP-GlcNAc to the lipid carrier
  undecaprenyl phosphate (UP), giving rise to the lipid I and lipid II intermediates,
  respectively. Various flippases translocate lipid II to the outer leaflet of the
  cytoplasmic membrane, where penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) incorporate the subunits
  into the growing PG layer. In order to recycle the resulting pyrophosphorylated
  state of the lipid carrier (UPP), dephosphorylation by UPP phosphatases (UppPs),
  including BcrC, yield the initial substrate UP for another round of PG subunit transport.
  Lipid carrier recycling requires flipping of UP to the internal leaflet by a yet-unknown
  mechanism. Finally, dilution of lipid carriers is counterbalanced by cytoplasmic
  synthesis of UPP, which involves the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway with the undecaprenyl
  pyrophosphate synthetase UppS catalyzing the last committed step. Like for UP flipping,
  the required mechanism to present UPP to the externally acting phosphatases is unknown.
  Bacitracin inhibits the lipid II cycle by binding to UPP, thereby preventing UPP
  dephosphorylation and progression of the cycle.
