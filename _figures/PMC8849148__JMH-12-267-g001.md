caption: Mechanism of action of romosozumab. Step 1 – Binding of Wnt ligand to the
  frizzled family receptor (G protein-coupled receptor) and co-receptor low-density
  lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6. Step 2 – The receptor complex inhibits
  axin-associated protein complex. Step 3 – The complex inhibits glycogen synthase
  kinase 3-beta, which is unable to phosphorylate β-catenin. Step 4 – This results
  in increased production of unphosphorylated β-catenin. Step 5 – β-catenin translocates
  to the nucleus and increases transcription of Wnt target genes with T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor, resulting in increased bone formation. Step 6 – Sclerostin inhibits
  binding of Wnt ligand to the receptor and inhibits Wnt signaling pathway resulting
  in reduced bone formation. Step 7 – Romosozumab sclerostin MAb (MAb in place of
  Mab) inhibits the binding of sclerostin to the lipoprotein receptor-related proteins
  5 and 6-frizzled receptor complex, thereby activating the Wnt signaling pathway
  and leading to increased bone formation
