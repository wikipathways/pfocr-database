caption: The cell cycle controls developmental decisions. The intersection between
  cell cycle control and cell fate determination mechanisms involves developmental
  signals and cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) targeting transcription factors
  that control developmental genes. CDKs also work in parallel with this pathway by
  modulating the epigenetic landscape and chromosome architecture around developmental
  genes. The activation of certain target genes determines important cell fate decisions
  and subsequent lineage commitment. bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix proteins.
