caption: Effect of Western diet on the gut microbiome and local pro-carcinogenic pathways.
  Adherence to Western diet results in the high abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum,
  Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), pks+Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus
  anaerobius. Overpopulation of these bacteria in the gut microbiome leads to the
  increased cell proliferation, elevated grade of inflammation and accumulation of
  DNA damage, eventually resulting in an environment favorable to initiation or progression
  of colorectal cancer. (A) F. nucleatum secretes FadA toxin, which binds the E-cadherin
  complex on the wall of intestinal epithelial cells. Upon interaction with FadA,
  E-cadherin undergoes phosphorylation, which lead to cleavage and subsequent translocation
  of the β-Catenin component of the complex to the nucleus. β-Catenin binds with TCF/LEF
  transcription complex, triggering the expression of CCND1 and MYC, that govern cell
  proliferation. (B) LPS is a polysaccharide on the cell wall of F. nucleatum, that
  binds the TLR4 receptor which are expressed on the intestinal epithelial cell membrane.
  LPS-TLR4 complex activates MYD88 adaptor that results in inhibition of a Ras GTPase—RASA1.
  The inhibition of RASA1 leads to unwanted cell proliferation. LPS-TLR4-MYD88 complex
  also induces the production of microRNA miR 21, that in turn activates NF-κB transcription
  factor and leads to the production of pro-inflammatory agents including KRT-7AS
  long non-coding RNA. (C) Upon binding of microbial protein Fap2 with cell membrane
  receptor, surface expressed polysaccharide Gal-Gal-NAc modulates the activation
  of NF-κB transcription factor that leads to the increase in intestinal inflammation
  through the production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8. Increased intestinal permeability
  also, known as “Leaky gut” phenomena, allows the bi-directional passage of bacteria
  and their metabolites, as well as immune inflammatory agents. Through the leaky
  gut, Fap2 is able to reach lamina propria and diminish the activity of Natural killer
  (NK) cells and T cells. (D) F. nucleatum interacts with intestinal epithelial cells
  to stimulate the production of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ENO1-IT1 via SP1 transcription
  factor. Production of ENO1-IT1 increases concurrently the expression of ENO1. This
  cascade of reactions leads to the increased level of carcinogenesis and inflammation.
  (E) ETBF produces BFT toxin, that interacts with epithelial cells to trigger intestinal
  inflammation via activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. BFT activates RAS/MAPK pathways
  to further initiate AP1 and start the production of IL-8 resulting in intestinal
  inflammation. BFT stimulates the translocation of β-Catenin to the nucleus initiating
  expression of C-Myc and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to
  DNA damage. (F) BFT also induce the production of spermine oxidase (SMO) and SMO-dependent
  ROS production, resulting in DNA damage. (G) Colibactin is secreted by of pks+E.
  coli. Interaction of colibactin with epithelial cells results in accumulation of
  DNA adducts and further DNA damage. (H) P. anaerobius surface protein PCWBR2 binds
  to α2/β1 integrin on the epithelial cells to initiate cell proliferation via activation
  of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and NF-κB transcription factor. This interaction also
  leads to expansion of neutrophils, macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells
  driving chronic inflammation and tumor progression.
