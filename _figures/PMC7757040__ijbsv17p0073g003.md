caption: 'An illustration of the combination effect of H2S donors, metformin, and
  simvastatin in facilitating acidification-induced cell death. Metformin inhibits
  mitochondria complex 1, leading to the accumulation of AMP and the downstream activation
  of AMPK pathway. Next, AMPK increases NADPH which in turn facilitates the conversion
  of pyruvate into lactic acid thereby increasing intracellular acidity. H2S donors
  promote glycolysis and inhibit the activities of intracellular acidity regulators
  (NHEs and EAs). On the other hand, simvastatin prevents the exportation of lactate
  by inhibiting MCT-4. Together, all these processes cause cell death by decreasing
  intracellular pH. (AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; NADPH: nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate; NHES: sodium/proton exchangers; AEs: anion exchangers; MCT-4:
  monocarboxylate transporter-4).'
