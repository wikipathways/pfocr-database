caption: 'Activation or silencing of WNT signaling pathway in the presence or absence
  of WNT ligands 1. Absence of Wnt ligand: In the absence of WNT ligands, the “destruction
  complex” continues to function and binds to cytoplasmic β-catenin. The rupture complex
  is mainly composed of Axin, APC, CK1, and GSK3β. The main role of this complex is
  to phosphorylate cytoplasmic β-catenin, thereby promoting its degradation. In the
  “destruction complex”, Axin acts as a scaffolding protein, responsible for assembling
  other proteins. APC regulates the phosphorylation and binding of β-catenin, and
  GSK3β and CK1 phosphorylate β-catenin. Phosphorylated β-catenin is ubiquitinated
  and then degraded by the proteasome. The continuous degradation of β-catenin leads
  to the inability of β-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm, preventing it from
  entering the nucleus to bind to the TCF/LEF transcription factor. In the absence
  of β-catenin, Groucho binds to TCF/LEF and hinders the transcriptional activation
  of genes, thus inhibiting the expression of Wnt target genes. FoxO1 and FoxO3 can
  competitively bind to β-catenin, and this binding prevents the binding of β-catenin
  to TCF/LEF, thus affecting the downstream of Wnt signaling. Klotho can bind to Wnt
  (not β-catenin) to block Wnt-triggered β-catenin activation and nuclear translocation.
  2. Presence of Wnt signal ligand Binding of Wnt ligands to Frizzled (Fz) and co-receptors
  LRP5/6 on the cell membrane surface activates Dishevelled (Dsh/DVL) proteins, which
  inhibit the activity of the “destruction complex”. Axin binds to phosphorylated
  LRP5/6 and forms a signalling complex that prevents the assembly of the β-catenin
  destruction complex. GSK3β activity is inhibited, and β-catenin is no longer phosphorylated
  and degraded, thus accumulating in the cytoplasm. The stabilised β-catenin gradually
  accumulates and is transferred to the nucleus, where β-catenin binds to TCF/LEF
  transcription factors to form a transcriptional activation complex, which initiates
  the expression of Wnt target genes, such as Snail, MMP-7, Twistl, FN1, WISPI, c-Myc,
  Cyclin D1, Axin2 and LEF1.3 Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway Aberrant
  activation of Snail1 inhibits the expression of E-cadherin, and MMP-7, with its
  proteolytic activity, is able to degrade E-cadherin. E-cadherin and β-catenin form
  a complex on the cell membrane to maintain the membrane localization of β-catenin.
  When E-cadherin is degraded, β-catenin, which was originally bound to E-cadherin,
  is released and accumulates in the cytoplasm. β-Catenin translocates into the nucleus
  and binds to TCF/LEF transcription factor to initiate the expression of Wnt target
  gene'
