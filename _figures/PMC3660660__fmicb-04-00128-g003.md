caption: The model of beta-lactamase induction in Gram-negative bacteria. The beta-lactamase
  induction by muropeptides via two major molecular mechanisms, the AmpG–AmpR–AmpC
  pathway and the BlrAB-like two-component regulatory system, are presented. The signaling
  pathway via two-component regulatory system is only supported by limited studies
  to date and is shown in dashed arrows. The “Regulator” denotes AmpR-like regulator
  or two-component response regulator. The “beta-lactamase” denotes the beta-lactamase
  that is subjected to induction. E, extracellular environment; OM, outer membrane;
  PS, periplasmic space; IM, inner membrane; C, cytoplasm.
