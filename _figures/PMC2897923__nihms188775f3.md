caption: Binding of Wnt5A to ROR2 leads to the activation of Ca2+ and PKC, which in
  turn stabilizes Wnt5A mRNA and increases its secretion. Secreted Wnt5A is presented
  to the receptor by HSPGs, resulting in a positive feedback loop. The Wnt5A-mediated
  increase in Ca2+ resluts in an increase in calpain-dependent filamin cleavage as
  well as activation of calcineurin and NFAT. Increases in PKC are associated with
  changes in the expression of proteins involved in the promotion of a metastatic
  phenotype including the upregulation of CD44 and SNAIL, loss of KISS1 and ECAD and
  establishment of an EMT. Increases in PKC are also associated with an increase in
  phospho-STAT3, which in melanoma leads to a decrease in melanosomal antigens.
