caption: Summary of the detrimental effects of TNF-α on both neuronal and glial cells
  during cerebral ischemia. TNF-α synthesis and release for both neuronal and glial
  cells may be induced via stimulation of mGlu2R by glutamate. TNF-α may then act
  in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion, modulating neuronal and glial signalling.
  Direct stimulation of the TNFR1-caspase 3 pathway results in inactivation of glial
  EAAT2s, while activation of the NFkB pathway reduces the synthesis and expression
  of this glutamate transporter. Upregulation of glutaminase in response to microglial
  TNFR activation also enhances glutamate synthesis and release, elevating levels
  of this neurotransmitter in the synapse. TNFR1 signalling may also enhance AMPAR
  trafficking into the postsynaptic membrane, enhancing the sensitivity of the cells
  to glutamate. Together, these effects result in the exacerbation of glutamate excitotoxicity
  during cerebral ischemia.
