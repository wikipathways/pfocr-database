  activation is sufficient to induce alterations in LC3B and SQSTM1 levels, which
  is similar to the typical patterns indicating autophagy. Nonetheless, our results
  suggest that the net steady-state levels of LC3B and SQSTM1 under a Raf/MEK/ERK-activated
  condition are determined by not only the standard autophagic pathway but also by
  a regulation at mRNA levels and by an involvement of BiP. This signaling may be
  important in determining cellular capacity for autophagy under a Raf/MEK/ERK-activated
  condition.
