caption: Effects of WTP53 and mutation of MuTP53 on tumour metabolism regulation.
  P53 can affect the metabolic plasticity process in multiple ways, thus affecting
  cancer pathogenesis and development. For the positive response to mitochondrial
  metabolism, WTP53 can promote the transcriptional level of GLS2 to catalyse the
  conversion of glutamine to glutamate, which is the source material of the TCA cycle.
  In addition, WTP53 can maintain the expression of apoptosis-induced factor (AIF),
  while SCO2, AIF, and SCO2 are required for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase assembly
  and maintain the electron transport chain. In contrast, for the negative response
  to glycolysis, WTP53 can directly regulate the first step of glycolysis by downregulating
  the transcriptional level of GLUT1/4 or suppressing NF-κB that can activate GLUT3.
  Moreover, the TIGAR can be encoded by WTP53 before hydrolysing and reducing the
  expression level of PFK1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. However,
  in liver cancer cells, WTP53 can disrupt the binding of MPC to pyruvate by inducing
  PUMA and inhibit the uptake of pyruvate from mitochondria, thus restraining OXPHOS.
  These data indicate that P53 may promote tumour progression but prevent cell carcinogenesis.
  In contrast with WTP53, MuTP53 may have opposite effects on tumour metabolism regulation.
  For glycolysis, MuTP53 can promote multiple glycolytic enzymes expression through
  different molecular pathways, such as HK-2, PFK-1, phosphoglucomutase (PGM), and
  PKM2. In contrast, for the mitochondrial metabolism, MuTP53 can inhibit the activity
  of α-KGDC and COXIV, then reduce the level of OXPHOS. In short, WTP53 or MuTP53
  will have a complete effect on the type of energy metabolism.
