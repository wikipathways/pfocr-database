caption: Relationship between TRIMs and NF-κB. TRIM proteins regulate the NF-κB pathway
  by affecting different target genes and play different roles in different cancers.
  Degradation of a target gene or protein knockdown is represented by a lightening
  of the color of the same pattern.TRIM22 binds to IκBα to accelerate the degradation
  of K48-linked ubiquitination, and forms a complex with IKKγ to promote the ubiquitination
  of K63 linked ubiquitination, which leads to the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκBα
  and activates the expression of NF-κB. TRIM67 binds to β-TrCP, competitively inhibits
  the binding of β-TrCP and IκBα, inhibits the degradation of IκBα, and inhibits the
  expression of NF-κB. TRIM27 interacts with IκBα to ubiquitinate it and inhibit its
  activity, leading to the activation of NF-κB. TRIM46 can interact with PPAR and
  activate the NF-κB signaling pathway through ubiquitination of PPAR. TRIM52 specifically
  activates NF-κB signaling and promotes the expression of TNFα and IL-6. TRIM44 knockdown
  upregulated CDK19, downregulated MMP1, and impaired TNFα-stimulated NF-κB-mediated
  transcriptional activity. TRIM39 stabilizes cactin through TNFα and inhibits the
  NF-κB-mediated signaling pathway.
