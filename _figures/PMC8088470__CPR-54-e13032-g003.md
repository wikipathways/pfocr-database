caption: The role of PRC2 core subunits EZH2 in the osteogenic differentiation of
  stem cell. The core subunit of PRC2, EZH2 activates WNT1, WNT6, and Wnt10a in mBMSCs
  and increases bone formation of osteoporosis mice. Contrarily, inhibition of EZH2
  upregulates the osteoblast‐related genes FHL1, IBSP, MX1, RUNX2, SP7, and ZBTB16
  in hBMSCs. With the inhibition of EZH2, the osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs
  and hAF‐MSCs are enhanced. Knockdown of EZH2 expression shows the decreased H3K27me3
  level on the WNT1, WNT5A and β‐catenin promoters, the activation of WNT/β‐catenin
  signalling pathway and the upregulated osteogenesis of hDFSCs. Similarly, EZH2 deletion
  also upregulates β‐catenin and enhances osteogenesis of hDPSCs. In pre‐diabetic
  NOD mice model, EZH2 is found to bind to the IRF8 promoter in hBMDCs and further
  represses bone loss. And it has been identified that EZH2‐modified H3K27me3 during
  the lineage specification of stem cells can be effectively reduced by CDK1, GSK126
  and DZNep
