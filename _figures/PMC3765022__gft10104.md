caption: AKI can initiate the onset of progressive renal disease. This figure depicts
  three potential pathways by which ischemic AKI may initiate progressive renal disease.
  As shown at the right-hand-side of the illustration, histone remodeling can lead
  to progressive activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes (as depicted
  in Fig. ). Additionally histone modifications, e.g. at the HMG CoA reductase gene,
  can lead to progressive lipid accumulation, which is known to exert pro-inflammatory
  effects. A second post-ischemic event is the induction of microvascular injury,
  setting the stage for ongoing tissue hypoxia. This pathway is intensified by a persistent
  up-regulation of the ET-1 gene, and that of its ETA receptor, which facilitates
  ongoing hypoxic/ischemic tissue damage. Finally, there is a relative failure of
  counter-regulatory mechanisms, most notably of IL-10 and HO-1, leaving pro-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic
  pathways relatively unopposed. As a consequence, progressive nephron loss, declining
  renal mass and ultimately end-stage kidney disease can result.
