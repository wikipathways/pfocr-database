caption: Representative image of the participation of SARA in the TGF-β signaling
  pathway. Once the receptor complex has been endocytosed with the TGF-β ligand, SARA
  binds to TβRI and recruits Smad2/3, and this is phosphorylated. Then, Smad2/3 binds
  to Smad4, and together they translocate to the nucleus and modulate the expression
  of target genes. On the other hand, the complex formed by Smad7-GADD34-PP1c acts
  as a negative regulator of the route, dephosphorylating TβRI.
