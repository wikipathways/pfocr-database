caption: Model of activation of the 5-ASA-induced checkpoint responses in colon cells.
  Following environmental signals, 5-ASA may synergize with checkpoint sensor proteins
  upstream of an ATR-dependent replication checkpoint pathway. ATR, activated by association
  with ATRIP and recruited onto DNA replication origins, phosphorylates Chk1 on Ser345
  and Ser317 and Rad17 on Ser645. The loading of claspin onto foci of replication
  also mediates stabilization and activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk1 and mediates
  the activation of the S-phase arrest. The ultimate target of Chk1 that mediates
  the replication stalling is yet unknown. In addition, ATR phosphorylates the tumor
  suppressor protein p53 on Ser15, which, although not involved in the replication
  checkpoint, ultimately results in p53 stabilization and transcriptional activation
  of downstream targets such as the CDK inhibitor p21waf1/cip1. Similarly, targets
  of the checkpoint kinase Chk1, not involved in the replication checkpoint, such
  as Cdc25A/C, are expected to be phosphorylated.
