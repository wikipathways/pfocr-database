caption: Potential mechanisms underlying probiotic-mediated prevention of NAFLD in
  vivo. (A) Probiotic-based interventions could improve dysbiosis, and in turn modulate
  the gut microbiota-derived metabolites. (B) Concurrently, improved gut barrier function
  would limit the delivery of gut-derived insults. (C) In the liver, the increased
  butyrate would increase activation of hepatic AMPK. (D) This would downregulate
  the hepatic lipogenesis pathway through reduced transcription factors and lipogenic
  enzymes and/ or increased PPARα, improved fatty acid β-oxidation. (E) The reduced
  microbiota-derived insults to the liver, would reduce the activation of TLR-4, downregulating
  the oxidative and inflammatory responses. (F) The reduced hepatic MDA and increased
  antioxidants mechanisms, and/ or (G) reduced NF-κB would prevent further oxidative
  and inflammatory stresses to the liver. (H) Lesser liver injury would reduce the
  stellate cell activation, reducing the TGF-β and downregulate the fibrogenic pathway.
  (I) Improved hepatic lipid metabolism could be seen through improved dyslipidaemia,
  reduced adiposity, FFA supply and secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokines. (J)
  Increased butyrate would promote FIAF, reducing FFA source to the liver. ACC, Acetyl-CoA
