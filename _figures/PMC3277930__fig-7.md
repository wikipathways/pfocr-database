caption: Diagram illustrating the role of Mtb WhiB3 in redox regulation. Mtb WhiB3
  is a DNA-binding protein that senses changes in the environmental gases such as
  NO and gradients of O2. WhiB3 also senses or responds to fluctuating levels of reducing
  equivalents (NADH) that are generated by the TCA cycle (respiration), and NADPH
  that accumulates during (β-oxidation of host fatty acids. If not properly balanced,
  the bacillus will experience reductive stress (). As a result, WhiB3 channels these
  excess reducing equivalents into virulence lipid anabolic pathways, which requires
  NADPH as cofactor. Thus, virulence lipid anabolism (e.g., SL-1, PDIM, PAT, DAT,
  and trehalose dimycolate) functions as an electron sink or reserve storage material,
  which is available for future use. This is also, in part, a mechanism to maintain
  intracellular redox balance. WhiB3 also overlaps with the DosR/S/T signaling pathway
  since both regulates TAG synthesis.
