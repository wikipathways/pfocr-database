caption: 'Labeling pattern from the initial metabolism of [U-13C]glutamate and the
  labeling pattern from the complete oxidation of these glutamate carbons via the
  pyruvate recycling pathway and re-entry into the TCA cycle. Labeling from the initial
  entry of [U-13C]glutamate into the TCA cycle is shown inside the dotted line. Note
  that metabolites generated are also uniformly labeled in all carbons. [Note that
  any glutamine formed in the cytosol directly from [U-13C]glutamate would also be
  uniformly labeled [U-13C]glutamine; reaction not shown in this figure]. [U-13C]malate
  or OAA leaving the TCA cycle would be converted to [U-13C]pyruvate by malic enzyme
  or the combined action of PEPCK and pyruvate kinase, and would also give rise to
  [U-13C]lactate. The [U-13C]pyruvate can be converted to [1,2-13C]acetyl CoA which
  enters the TCA cycle for further oxidation. Any citrate formed from the condensation
  of the [1,2-13C]acetyl CoA with unlabeled oxaloacetate in the cycle would give rise
  to [4,5-13C]glutamate and glutamine, and also to both [1,2-13C]aspartate and [3,4-13C]aspartate.
  These partially labeled glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate molecules can be readily
  distinguished from the [U-13C]glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate by 13C-NMR spectroscopy.
  It is very likely that studies of pyruvate recycling from [U-13C]glutamate underestimate
  the amount of recycling taking place since any citrate formed from the condensation
  of [1,2-13C]acetyl CoA with [U-13C]OAA formed from the initial entry and metabolism
  of the glutamate into the TCA cycle give rise to [U-13C]glutamate which can not
  be distinguished from the precursor. Abbreviations: Glu, glutamate; Gln, glutamine;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; Asp, aspartate; Lac, lactate; Pyr, pyruvate; ME, malic enzyme;
  PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.'
