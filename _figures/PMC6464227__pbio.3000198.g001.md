caption: The figure combines adrenal and gonadal pathways. The left-hand column shows
  the ∆5 pathway, in which steroids retain the double bond between carbons 5 and 6
  in cholesterol’s B-ring. The StAR protein facilitates import of cholesterol into
  mitochondrial, in which P450scc (CYP11A1) cleaves off the side-chain to yield Preg,
  the first C21 steroid. ∆5 steroids are converted to corresponding ∆4 steroids by
  3βHSD2 (HSD3B2) in the adrenal and gonad or by 3βHSD1 in placenta and peripheral
  tissues. In the absence of P450c17 (in the adrenal zona glomerulosa), progesterone
  is 21-hydroxylated by P450c21 (CYP21A2). P450c11AS (Aldo synthase, CYP11B2) then
  catalyzes 11-hydroxylase, 18-hydroxylase, and 18-methyl oxidase activities to yield
  Aldo. In the gonads and adrenal zona fasciculata, the 17α-hydroxylase activity of
  P450c17 (CYP17A1) permits synthesis of 17OHP, which is 11-hydroxylated to cortisol
  by P450c11β (CYP11B1). The 17,20 lyase activity of P450c17 requires allosteric action
  of cytochrome b5 (b5) in the adrenal zona reticularis and testicular Leydig cells,
  permitting conversion of C21 to C19 steroids. Human P450c17 converts 17OHP to androstenedione
  with only approximately 2–3% of its activity to convert 17OH-Preg to DHEA so that
  testosterone synthesis proceeds via DHEA and not via 17OHP; by contrast, rodent
  and ungulate P450c17 catalyzes this reaction efficiently. Testicular 17βHSD3 converts
  DHEA to androstenediol and androstenedione to testosterone; low levels of adrenal
  17βHSD5 (AKR1C3) permit synthesis of small amounts of testosterone. In the ovary
  and elsewhere, P450aro (aromatase, CYP19A1) converts C19 androgens to C18 estrogens.
  In genital skin, 5α-reductase type 2 (5αRed2, SRD5A2) further activates testosterone
  to DHT. 17OHP, 17OH-progesterone; Aldo, aldosterone; C21, 21-carbon; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone;
  DHT, dihydrotestosterone; Preg, pregnenolone; StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory
  protein.
