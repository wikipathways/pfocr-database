caption: Main molecular pathways engaged in the nonreversal of cell cycle arrest and
  perpetuation and propagation of stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) after
  diverse renal insults. Metabolic, toxic, or ischemic stressors conspire to activate
  p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and induce oxidative stress, which,
  in turn, result in phosphorylation of p53, p21, and p16 and suppression of retinoblastoma
  protein (pRb) phosphorylation, leading to cell cycle arrest (thus, MAPK and oxidative
  stress may induce either SIPS or apoptosis; hence, the scheme indicates both). Accompanying
  decline in sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) activity leads to repression of forkhead box protein
  O (FoxO)-1 and FoxO-3 with the loss of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resistance,
  while affecting production of autophagic proteins and peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1). The ensuing activation of mechanistic target
  of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), assisted by insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1
  (IGF-1), Wnt9a, and Klotho deficiency, results in suppression of autophagy. Reduced
  SIRT-1 activity also leads, via impaired deacetylation of p53 and liver kinase B1
  (LKB1), to continuing activation of p53 and suppression of AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK), respectively. These, in turn, perpetuate cell cycle arrest and activation
  of mTOR. Additive effect of reduced autophagy and cell cycle arrest is responsible
  for developing SIPS. A shift in balance between pro-apoptosis and anti-apoptosis
  in favor of anti-apoptotic signaling further seals the fate of the cell to persistent
  senescence. Accompanying it, senescence-associated secretory products (SASPs) enable
  further stress signaling, even if the initial stressor has been terminated, and
  engender propagation of proinflammatory and profibrotic signaling locally and systemically.
  The critical elements of the pathway are framed.
