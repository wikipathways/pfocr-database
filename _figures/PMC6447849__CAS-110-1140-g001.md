caption: Biogenesis of miRNA. Most miRNA are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNA
  pol II) as primary‐miRNA (pri‐miRNA), and then processed in the nucleus by Drosha‐DGCR8
  into precursor miRNA (pre‐miRNA). The pre‐miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm by
  exportin‐5 and further cleaved by a complex containing Dicer and TRBP. The functional
  strand of mature miRNA is incorporated into the RNA‐induced silencing complex (RISC),
  which contains GW182 and Argonaute protein. As a component of this complex, the
  mature miRNA regulates gene expression by binding to complementary sequences in
  the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) or coding regions of its target mRNA, leading to
  mRNA degradation or translational repression. Alternatively, miRNA can induce translational
  activation by the 5′UTR of target mRNA. In addition, miRNA can be secreted through
  the exosomal pathway and regulate gene expression in recipient cells
