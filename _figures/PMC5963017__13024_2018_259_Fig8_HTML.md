caption: Pridopidine enhances cAMP/PKA and TrkB pathway genes in the YAC128 striatum.
  Shown is a model of gene regulation after treatment with pridopidine in the YAC128
  striatum. Dopamine transmission directs the activation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors
  (D1R and D2R, respectively) in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum. On the
  WT postsynaptic density of a D1 synapse, D1Rs activate adenylyl cyclase (AC) in
  MSNs, whereas muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 (M4R) inhibits AC activity. In
  contrast, D2Rs negatively regulate AC in MSNs, while A2ARs are AC agonists. GPR3
  activates AC in both D1R and D2R-expressing MSNs, where RGS2 is a target of cAMP
  signaling. Activation of AC is upstream of cAMP and PKA, which augments NMDAR activity.
  Dopamine D1 and D2 receptor genes (Drd1 and Drd2) and A2AR gene (Adora2a) are differentially
  expressed (DE) and downregulated in the YAC128 striatum, but unchanged after pridopidine
  treatment (black highlighting). Both Rgs2 and Gpr3 are downregulated in YAC128 striatum
  (Adj. p-val < 0.05) and upregulated after treatment of pridopidine. NMDARs and TrkB
  receptors are expressed in both D1R and D2R-expression MSNs. NMDAR and TrkB receptors
  both indirectly activate the transcription factor (TF) CREB in the nucleus via downstream
  pathways. In turn, CREB activates gene expression of several targets. Genes Arc,
  Dusp1, Egr1 and Egr2 are downregulated in the YAC128 striatum, but upregulated after
  pridopidine treatment (Adj. p-val < 0.05). Fos, Fosb, Fosl2, Egr3, and Egr4 are
  unperturbed in the striatum of YAC128 mice, but expression of these genes is restored
  after treatment with pridopidine (Adj. p-val < 0.05). Dopamine pathway genes Nr4a1
  and Nr4a3 and TF gene Npas4 are downregulated in YAC128 and upregulated after pridopidine
  treatment (Adj. p-val < 0.05). NPAS4 regulates Gpr3 gene expression

  aberrant gene expression and activates neuroprotective pathways in the YAC128 HD
