caption: Anti-inflammatory pathways in microglia. (A) Gal-3 induces alternative microglia
  activation through interaction with IL-4 receptor (IL4R). Following Gal-3 lattice
  formation the carbohydrate-binding site of Gal-3 molecules interacts with glycosylated
  IL4R and prevents their endocytosis and also over activation of IL4R and its anti-inflammatory
  signaling. (B) Activation of α7 nAChR on microglia triggers anti-inflammatory cascades,
  including Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
  and PI3K/Akt, which potentiate the activity of transcriptional factor Nrf2 and its
  downstream pathways (HO-1 and CAT), and inhibits the canonical proinflammatory protein
  NFκB, which governs the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α) and
  enzymes (e.g., iNOS and COX-2) involved in neuroinflammation. This pathway can be
  induced by tropisetron and RG3487. (C) IL-4 can interact with its tyrosine kinase
  IL4R on microglia cell surface. This interaction might activate one of the canonical
  transcriptional factors that are involved in microglia polarization such as PPAR-γ.
  Pioglitazone activates PPAR-γ. (D) By crosslinking insulin-like growth factor 1
  receptor (IGFR-1), secreted Gal-3 will prevent early endocytosis and over-activate
  the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT pathway
  and the transcription of genes needed for production of anti-inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-4. IL-4, interleukin 4; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; TNF-α,
  tumor necrosis factor-α; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; NF-κB, nuclear factor
  kappa B; α7 nAChR, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; Gal-3, galectin-3; IGFR,
  insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor; PPAR-γ, peroxisome proliferator-
  activated receptor-gamma.
