caption: Effect of TRPV1 channels on the protection of ECs and the formation of macrophage-derived
  foam cells. Activation of TRPV1 channels in endothelial cells can increase intracellular
  Ca2+ levels and promote PKA, CaMKII and AMPK activation. PKA and AMPK can promote
  eNOS phosphorylation and increase the level of NO, which can promote vasodilation
  and angiogenesis. Activation of PKA can upregulate uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) expression,
  reduce ROS production, increase resistance to oxidative stress, and reduce endotheliocyte
  damage, foam cell formation and atherosclerosis. In addition, activation of TRPV1
  channels can activate the Ca2+-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt
  pathway to inhibit the activation of NF-B, which can inhibit cytokines, chemokines,
  adhesion factors and monocyte adhesion to inhibit the inflammatory response of ECs.
