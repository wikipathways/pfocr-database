caption: Ablating androgen biosynthesis as a novel treatment option for metastatic
  castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Androgens are synthesized from cholesterol through
  multiple enzymatic reactions within adrenal and testicular tissues. Cytochrome p450c17
  (CYP17), an ER-localized enzyme expressed in both the testes and adrenal glands,
  plays a critical role in the androgen biosynthesis pathway. CYP17 catalyzes two
  critical steps through its 17α-hydroxylase and C17,20-lyase activities. The 17α-hydroxylase
  activity of CYP17 converts pregnenolone to 17α-pregnenolone and progesterone to
  17α-progesterone. The C17,20-lyase activity of CYP17 converts 17α-hydroxypregnenolone
  to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione,
  which are subsequently converted to testosterone and/or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
  by other steroidogenic enzymes. Abiraterone is a novel CYP17 inhibitor that acts
  to inhibit its 17α-hydroxylase and/or C17,20-lyase activities.
