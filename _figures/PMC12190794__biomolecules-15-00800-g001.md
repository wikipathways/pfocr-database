caption: NcRNAs involved in the regulation of DIC. Schematic diagram represents the
  molecular mechanisms of most of the discussed ncRNAs in regulating DIC. MiR-499-5p,
  miR-23a, miR-532-3p, lnc00339 and lnc CMDL-1 are involved in DOX-induced mitochondrial
  fission; MiR-146a, miR-30e, miR-29b, miR-23a, miR-15b-5p and lincRNA-p21 participate
  in the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c
  induced by DOX; MiR-30e, miR-23a, miR-15b-5p and lincRNA-p21 regulate DOX-induced
  ROS production; MiR-140-5p and miR-451 are related to DOX-altered antioxidant levels;
  MiR-378 is associated with DOX-induced ER stress; MiR-320a regulates microvessel
  density under DOX treatment; MiR-34a, miR-23a, miR-128, miR-130a, miR-22, miR-23a,
  lnc5745, and lncRNA RMRP are correlated with the p53 signaling pathway; and MiR-200a
  is related in DOX-induced ferroptosis, while lncRNA TINCR has an important role
  in pyroptosis of DIC. Some lncRNAs and circRNAs can sponge miRNAs. The figure was
