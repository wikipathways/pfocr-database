caption: DSB repair pathways. (A) Homologous recombination repair (HRR). After the
  initial sensing of the DSB by MRN and the activation of ATM, H2AX is phosphorylated,
  which in turn elicits a sequence of signaling events thought to ultimately cause
  the activation of nucleases such as Mre11 and CtIP to process the DNA ends and generate
  ssDNA with 3′ overhangs. ssDNA is bound by RPA, which is subsequently exchanged
  by Rad51 and Rad51 paralogs. This exchange is facilitated by Rad52, Rad54 and BRCA2.
  The Rad51-decorated DNA fiber initiates strand invasion into an intact homologous
  DNA molecule that leads to the formation of a Holiday junction. The DNA sequence
  around the DSB is copied by DNA synthesis associated with branch migration, and
  the process is completed by resolution of the Holiday junction. HRR is a templated
  repair process and is therefore error free (). (B) DNA-PK-dependent nonhomologous
  end joining (D-NHEJ). DNA ends are recognized by Ku, which recruits, after processing
  by Tdp1 or PNKP, DNA-PKcs. Upon end-binding, DNA-PKcs is activated and phosphorylates
  itself and possibly also other proteins (like H2AX on an adjacent nucleosome). Phosphorylated
  DNA-PKcs is thought to be released from the DNA end, which allows the DNA ligase
  IV/XRCC4/XLF complex to mediate end-ligation possibly with the help of a DNA polymerase
  that catalyzes gap filling (,,). (C) Back up pathway of nonhomologous end joining
  (B-NHEJ). There is evidence that cells of higher eukaryotes with defects in D-NHEJ
  rejoin the majority of DSBs using an alternative repair pathway that is not utilizing
  any of the HRR-associated activities (). This pathway is therefore termed backup
  NHEJ (B-NHEJ). Although details of this pathway remain to be elucidated, there is
  evidence that it utilizes the PARP-1/DNA Ligase III/XRCC1 repair module known to
  be involved in the repair of SSB and base damages (), and that its function is facilitated
  by the linker histone H1 (). (D) Single strand annealing (SSA). This repair pathway
  shares features of HRR and NHEJ, and is best described in yeast (). After the initial
  sensing of the DSBs and processing of the ends by an exonuclease, possibly the MRN
  complex, the generated ssDNA tails are loaded with RPA. Ends are resected until
  homologous regions are exposed on the two DNA strands and pairing of these regions
  is facilitated by Rad52. After appropriate gap filling and removal of the overhangs
  by the ERCC1/XPF nuclease, a ligation step restores DNA integrity. The repair pathways
  described in B, C and D are associated with loss (and sometimes gain) of DNA material
  and are by nature error prone.
