caption: A) RIG-I is present in the cytoplasm of the cell in an inactive closed conformation.
  Upon viral infection, 5’-triphosphate (ppp) RNA is produced and recognized by RIG-I
  through its C-terminal regulatory domain (RD). RIG-I then undergoes a conformational
  change to expose its 2CARD domain for subsequently ubiqutination by TRIM25. Another
  E3 ligase, Riplet, ubiquitinates the RD domain of RIG-I. Ubiquitinated RIG-I binds
  to the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS and recruits polyubiquitinated TRAF3 and
  TRAF6. TRAF3 activates the TBK1/IKKε kinases through ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms
  for subsequent phosphorylation of IRF3/IRF7 and type-I IFN production. Downstream
  of TRAF6, TAK1 is activated by unanchored polyubiquitin chains and promotes activation
  of NF-κB transcription and cytokine production by ubiqutin-dependent activation
  of the IKK complex and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB. B) Ubiquitin conjugation
  is initiated by an E1 activating enzyme in the presence of ATP as energy source
  and monoubiquitin. Ubiquitin is then transferred to an E2-conjugating enzyme. The
  E3-ligase confers specificity to the reaction by recognizing the E2 and the substrate
  for ubiquitination. Deubiquitinases (DUB) hydrolyze polyubiquitin chains which are
  then recycled.
