caption: Ovaries of Drosophila house different types of cells. (A) The adult ovary
  of Drosophila consists of 16–20 ovarioles, and the germarium of each ovariole has
  different types of cells. The germline stem cells (GSCs) strictly maintain and differentiate
  under the regulation of signals from the somatic cells. At every stage of early
  cell division, the GSCs are surrounded by somatic cells for their proper regulation.
  GSCs divide into cystoblasts (CBs), which later undergo four rounds of mitotic division
  to generate a 16-cells cyst. In the end, only one cell among these 16-cell cysts
  differentiates as an oocyte. (B) The third instar larval ovary of Drosophila, also
  consists of somatic cells and germ cells. Before pupation, most of the terminal
  filaments (TF) cells has formed. While the TF cells completely formed at the early
  pupal stage. The germ cells can be identified with a germ cell-specific marker (anti-vasa).
  However, only the germ cells with single dot-shaped spectrosome were considered
  as PGCs.
