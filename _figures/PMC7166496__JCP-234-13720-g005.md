caption: 'Regional signaling pathway analysis of the genes associated with heart diseases.
  (a) The genes related to heart diseases in cardiac vessels such as CS, SDHA, IDH1,
  and DLAT worked together to regulate TCA cycle pathway; (b) The disease‐related
  genes in valves, like ACAA1, ALDH9A1, and HADHB, performed their functions in amino
  acid and fatty acid degradation pathway; (c) The genes in chambers were mainly involved
  in multiple pathways including glycolysis and propanoate metabolism pathway. TCA:
