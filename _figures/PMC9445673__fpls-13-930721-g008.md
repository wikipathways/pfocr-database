caption: 'Gene ontology enrichment analysis of human orthologs to Arabidopsis peroxisome-dependent
  genes. Network analysis were performed using Genemania and NetworkAnalyst 3.0 and
  resulting networks were submitted to enrichment analysis using GO annotation and
  pathway databases supported by NetworkAnalyst. Cluster 1 showed peroxidase activity
  including: PRDX5, PRDX1, PRDX2 and PRDX6, and Cluster 2 showed antioxidant activity,
  including HSPB1.'
