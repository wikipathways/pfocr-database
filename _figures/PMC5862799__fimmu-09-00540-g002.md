caption: Basic metabolic pathways in T cells. In the cytosol, glucose is converted
  into pyruvate via glycolysis. Pyruvate can either be further metabolized into lactate
  and secreted or enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to generate NADH and FADH2
  which get fed into the electron transport chain (ETC) to generate ATP via the process
  of oxidative phosphorylation. Glucose breakdown intermediates produced during glycolysis
  can be metabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway donating important building
  blocks for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis. TCR stimulation induces the expression
  of several genes involved in glucose transport and metabolism by recruiting the
  transcription factors c-Myc and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1) α via activation
  of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) machinery. In addition to glucose,
  T cells can also use fatty acids as a source of energy by degrading fatty acids
  through fatty acid oxidation.
