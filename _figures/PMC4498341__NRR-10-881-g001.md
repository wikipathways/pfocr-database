caption: 'Mercury-induced neurotoxicity and BN attenuates mercury neurotoxicity.Hg-induced
  neurotoxicity was partially elucidated by distributing glutamate and calcium homeostasis,
  as well as ROS generation. The three events activate neuronal death pathway. Whereas,
  BN possesses neuroprotection via antioxidant defense stimulation, increasing the
  anti-apoptotic signaling, and decreasing the apoptotic signaling and the NMDA receptors.
  BN: Berberine; Ca++: calcium ion (yellow ball); EAAT2: excitatory amino-acid transporter
  2; Gln: glycine; Glu: glutamate (red ball); Hg++: mercury ion; NMDA: N-methyl-D-aspartate;
  ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
