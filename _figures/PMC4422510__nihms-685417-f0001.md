caption: In this model, a healthy cell that has endured some type of damage (e.g.
  UV-induced mutations) will initially, and likely simultaneously, respond by inducing
  toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems (e.g. MazEF) and repair mechanisms (the SOS response).
  The Cid and Lrg proteins are present but are kept inactive at this point because
  of the inhibitory effect of the Lrg proteins on the Cid PCD effector proteins. The
  activity of the TA system, by virtue of its inhibitory effect on translation, results
  in the transition of the cell to a quiescent state (bacteriostasis) that maximizes
  the energy and resources needed to repair the damage. If the damage is beyond repair,
  a “point of no return” is reached and the inhibitory effect of the Lrg proteins
  on Cid is released by an unknown mechanism and cell death ensues. Finally, post-mortem
  signaling results in the activation of apoptosis-like processes and/or autolysis,
  including nuclease activation (such as BapE) and DNA fragmentation, membrane alterations,
  and peptidoglycan hydrolase-mediated cell wall degradation.
