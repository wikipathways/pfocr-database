caption: SCFPROM-1 function in the control of meiotic entry. (A) Model for SCFPROM-1
  functioning independently in the downregulation of mitotic cell cycle protein accumulation
  (CYE-1) and the promotion of homolog pairing through activation of CHK-2, via degradation
  of a proposed inhibitor of CHK-2, protein X. (B) Model showing downregulation of
  CYE-1 (green rectangle) levels through dual regulation by SCFPROM-1 (proteolysis)
  and GLD-1 (translational repression); loss of CYE-1 by translational repression
  is slow, whereas CYE-1 protein degradation is rapid. Protein Y (blue rectangle)
  is a proposed translational target of GLD-1; in gld-1(-) SCFPROM-1 loss of function,
  the combination of ectopic protein Y and ectopic mitotic cell cycle proteins (e.g.,
  CYE-1) results in continuous mitotic cell cycling. (C) SCFPROM-1 acts in parallel
  to the GLD-1 pathway and the GLD-2 pathway, downstream of GLP-1 signaling, to promote
  meiotic entry and inhibit mitotic cell cycling and the stem cell fate. DTC, DT cell.
