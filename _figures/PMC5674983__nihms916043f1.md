caption: Overall pathway of DC Activation. A series of molecular signals, each a specific
  agonist for different TLRs are presented alongside an antigen. Dimerization of TLRs
  activates downstream signaling “maturing” the dendritic cell. Mature cells present
  the antigen on the major histocompatibility complex along with co-stimulatory and
  recognition proteins (e.g. CD80/CD86) and signaling cytokines that further the immune
  response. A Th1 response involves secretion of many cytokines, but notable ones
  include IL-6 and IL-12. This then elicits a cytotoxic T cell response with antibodies
  directing cytotoxic cells towards a specific antigen. A Th2 response is the production
  of soluble antibodies via activated B cells. The marked cytokines include IL-5 and
  -7.
