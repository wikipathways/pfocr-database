caption: 'Overview of PARP inhibitor interactions. PARP inhibitors need to circumvent
  the blood brain barrier, which is characterized by tight junctions and multiple
  efflux pumps, to achieve therapeutic action. PARP inhibitors combined with radiotherapy,
  chemotherapy and immunotherapy can lead to synergistic activity. In addition, homologous
  recombination deficiency and other DNA damage repair defects contribute to synthetic
  lethality. (a). Ionizing radiation causes cytotoxic DNA damage and the base excision
  repair pathway is blocked by PARP inhibitors. Ionizing radiation also disrupts the
  blood brain barrier. (b). Temozolomide causes cytotoxic DNA damage and the base
  excision repair pathway is blocked by PARP inhibitors. (c). Immune checkpoint inhibitors,
  including CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, induce anti-tumor immune responses.
  Immunogenicity is augmented by PARP inhibitors via genomic instability and reprogramming
  of the tumor microenvironment. (d). IDH mutations cause accumulation of the oncometabolite
  2-hydroxyglutarate. In turn, this can lead to homologous recombination deficiency
  and synthetic lethality, in combination with impaired base excision repair due to
  PARP inhibitors. (e). Other DNA damage repair defects, including in the ATM, DNA-PK
  and Wee1 pathways, can lead to synthetic lethality, in combination with impaired
  base excision repair due to PARP inhibitors. Abbreviations: BCRP: breast cancer
  resistance protein; cGAS: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; IDH: isocitrate dehydrogenase;
  PARP: poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase; PD-L1: programmed death ligand 1; P-gp: P-glycoprotein;
  STING: stimulator of interferon genes.'
