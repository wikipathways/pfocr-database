caption: Immune cell function in liver pathologies. A Liver cancer risk factors include
  alcohol-induced liver injury, which is associated with an increase in endotoxins
  in the liver that activate Kupffer cells to produce TNF-α and IL-6. This results
  in increased production of complement factors that drive an inflammatory environment.
  In pathogen infection, group 1 ILCs and cytotoxic T cells can recognize and eliminate
  infected hepatocytes. ILC1s can express PD-L1 in settings of chronic infection,
  which negatively regulates adaptive immune responses. Kupffer cells can be both
  proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Proinflammatory Kupffer cells produce TNF-α,
  and anti-inflammatory Kupffer cells produce TGF-β. Monocytes can regulate T cells
  to produce the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17. Obesity activates a cascade in which
  Kupffer cells produce TNF-α and IL-6, resulting in chronic inflammation and the
  development of fatty liver disease. B Chronic inflammation can lead to liver fibrosis.
  NK cells and ILC1s can directly recognize and eliminate activated stellate cells
  in the fibrotic liver, a pathway that can be inhibited by TGF-β secretion. C Sustained
  inflammation and fibrosis can result in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
  NK cells can directly kill cancerous cells but ultimately can become dysfunctional,
  for example, in response to TGF-β, which is highly expressed in hepatic inflammation.
  These dysfunctional NK cells express receptors that negatively regulate their cytotoxicity.
  CD49a+ ILC1s can inhibit NK cell function and promote cancer growth by producing
  proangiogenic factors allowing tumor growth
