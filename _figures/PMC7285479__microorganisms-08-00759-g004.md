caption: Metabolic reconstruction of membrane phospholipids biosynthesis through mevalonate
  pathway. Two enzymes, Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase and Mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate
  are overexpressed (blue arrows) under cold conditions, catalysing key reactions
  for the synthesis of mevalonate and isopentenyl bisphosphate (IPP), respectively,
  inside the mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of isoprenoids. These molecules
  are closely related with the membrane phospholipids biosynthesis, which some enzymes
  have been also identified, although not overexpressed, in this proteomics dataset
  as long as other enzymes are involved in mevalonate pathway (black arrows). Absent
  reactions, catalysed by enzymes not detected in this dataset, are coloured in grey.
