caption: 'The molecular mechanisms that underlies TRPV1-mediated nociceptive hypersensitivity
  in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from a mouse model of sickle cell disease.
  In the SCD mice, a prolonged increase in plasma adenosine activates ADORA2B on myeloid
  cells, leading to an elevation in circulating IL-6 and sIL-6R. The IL-6/sIL-6R complex
  binds to gp130 on DRG neurons, producing STAT3 phosphorylation and consequently
  inducing neuronal TRPV1 expression. SCD-induced up-regulation of CCL2/CCR2 signaling
  enhances the sensitivity and expression of TRPV1. In addition, the increased protons
  caused by SCD directly sensitize and activate the TRPV1 channel. The activated/increased
  TRPV1 augments nociceptive sensitivity and participates in the induction and maintenance
  of SCD-associated chronic pain. Ca2+ influx through the activated TRPV1 channel
  increases intracellular Ca2+ levels and subsequently activates PKC and CaMKIIα.
  PKC can also be activated by the ET-1/ETA receptor signaling pathway. Both PKC and
  CaMKIIα can further activate TRPV1 via phosphorylation of TRPV1. This PKC/CaMKIIα-TRPV1
  positive feedback may be one mechanism underlying nociceptive hypersensitivity and
  chronic pain in SCD. ADORA2B: adenosine A2B receptor; gp130: glycoprotein 130; STAT3:
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; CCL2: chemokine (C-C motif)
  ligand 2; CCR2: C-C motif chemokine receptor 2; PKC: protein kinase C; CaMKIIα:
  Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II alpha; ET-1: endothelin-1; ETA:
  endothelin-type A.'
