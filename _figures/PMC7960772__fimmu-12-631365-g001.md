caption: The immune environment surrounding a transplanted organ. 1) CTLA-4-CD80/86
  interaction between Tregs and APCs resulting in increased tryptophan metabolism
  by APCs via IDO-dependent pathway. 2) LAG-3 and TIGIT on Tregs directing APCs towards
  a more tolerogenic phenotype. 3) Treg consumption of IL-2. 4) CD39 and CD73 acting
  as ectonucleotidases to break down ATP and 5’AMP to adenosine. 5) Tregs suppressing
  effector T cells via CTLA-4-CD80/86 interaction. 6) Tregs secreting anti-inflammatory
  cytokines to reduce the pro-inflammatory response, induce apoptosis of effector
  T cells, and promote the expansion of regulatory cell types. 7) MDSCs suppressing
  effector T cell, B cell, and NK cell proliferation via consumption of L-arginine
  in an iNOS dependent pathway. This mechanism is enhanced but upregulation of Arg-1
  and HO-1 by MDSCs. 8) IL-10 and TGF-b secreted by MDSCs promoting the activation
  of Tregs. 9) CCL5 secreted by MDSCs establishing a graft-to-periphery gradient to
  recruit Tregs. 10) MDSCs promoting the suppressive function of Tregs via interaction
  between PD-L1 and PD-1. 11) IL-10 secreted by B10 cells promoting expansion of Tregs
  and exerting a broad array of anti-inflammatory effects. 12) Tregs inducing apoptosis
  of autoreactive B cells via interaction of PD-1 expressed on Tregs with PD-L1 on
  B cells.
