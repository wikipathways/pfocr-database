caption: 'Receptors that sense danger signals released from neighboring injured retinal
  pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the receptor for
  AGE (RAGE) can detect danger signals released from or generated by dying RPE cells.
  Once stimulated, TLRs and RAGE activate the transcription factor nuclear factor
  kappa B (NFkB), thereby turning on the transcription of many pro-inflammatory genes
  and consequently inducing an inflammatory response. The DAMP molecules ATP and monosodium
  urate stimulate a pathway that works through Nod-like receptor NACHT, LRR, and PYD
  containing protein-3 (NALP3) and leads to the production of the proinflammatory
  cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. Those pathways surrounded by dotted lines
  indicate a current lack of data supporting a functional pathway in RPE cells.Abbreviations:
  AGE, advanced glycation endproducts; OxLDL, oxidized low density proteins.'
