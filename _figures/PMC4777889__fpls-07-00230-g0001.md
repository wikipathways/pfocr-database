caption: The various routes of hydrogen perioxide (H2O2) production and H2O2 removal
  in plant cells. Enzymatic production of H2O2 in plants requires several enzymes
  including cell wall peroxidases (Francoz et al., ), oxalate (Hu et al., ), amine
  oxidases and flavin-containing enzymes (Cona et al., ), glucose oxidases, glycolate
  oxidases (Chang and Tang, ), and sulfite oxidases (Brychkova et al., ). In these
  enzymes, some of them may convert O to H2O2 and O2. And others may oxidize their
  each substrates to generate H2O2in biocatalysis processes. Several non-enzymatic
  reactions are also known to produce H2O2. In peroxisome, H2O2synthesis is associated
  with glycolate oxidation during photosynthetic carbon oxidation cycle (Foyer and
  Noctor, ). In chloroplasts, H2O2 production can be produced by the reduction of
  O by photosynthetic electron transport (PET) chain. H2O2 in chloroplast also may
  be detected at the manganese-containing, oxygen evolving complex which is the donor
  site of photosystem II. Moreover, H2O2 could be generated in mitochondria through
  aerobic respiration because O is produced from complexes I and III in the electron
  transport chain. H2O2-scavenging enzymes include catalase (CAT; Willekens et al.,
  ), peroxidase (POX; Fan and Huang, ), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione
  reductase (GR; Jahan and Anis, ). In non-enzymatic pathway, Ascorbate (AsA) and
  glutathione (GSH) are responsible for decreasing H2O2 level (Kapoor et al., ).
