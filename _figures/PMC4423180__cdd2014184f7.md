caption: Schematic diagram for Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction via ROS-Sp1-Crif1
  pathway. Based on our experimental data, Aβ-induced ROS facilitated the reduction
  of Crif1 mRNA levels by increasing the sumoylation of Sp1. Reduced Crif1 expression
  resulted in disruption of mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial functions,
  which leads to neuronal cell death shown in AD brains

  disruption and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
