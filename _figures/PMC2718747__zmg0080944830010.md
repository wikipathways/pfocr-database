caption: A model of EGF/EGFR-induced inhibition of a Luminal-A phenotype in MCF-7
  cells. MCF-7 breast cancer cells are of a Luminal-A phenotype, express ERα and PGR,
  and are negative for HER2 amplification. The activity of miR-206 can influence this
  phenotype through the direct targeting and repression of not only ERα, but of coactivators
  (SRC-1 and SRC-3) and transcription factors (GATA-3) that are required to mediate
  estrogenic responses within this cell type. The expression and activity of miR-206
  are enhanced by active EGF/EGFR signaling, a hyperactive signaling pathway found
  in a majority of ERα-negative Basal-like breast tumors. This supports the notion
  that ERα-positive tumors acquiring ancillary EGFR signaling would have enhanced
  miR-206 levels, which would push the bi-stable system within the tumor from an ERα-positive
  to an ERα-negative phenotype. Also, given that EGFR expression induces a Basal-like
  gene expression pattern in MCF-7 cells (), miR-206 may also actively promote a Basal-like
  phenotype.
