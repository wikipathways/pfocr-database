caption: Engulfment of apoptotic cells activates several pathways that may affect
  phagocyte metabolism and promote continued corpse uptake. First, apoptotic cell
  engulfment leads to phagocyte PPAR and LXR activation, with their ligands possibly
  derived from ingested cargo. PPARs and LXR subsequently increase transcription of
  phagocytic receptors (e.g. Mer and CD36) and opsonins, (e.g. C1qb and MFG-E8) (,
  ). In a second pathway, tickling of engulfment receptors by phosphatidylserine exposed
  on the apoptotic cell leads to increased Abca1 expression and cholesterol efflux,
  via PPAR and LXR activity. Lastly, phagocytes increase Ucp2 expression in the mitochondria
  following engulfment of apoptotic cells, leading to decreased mitochondrial membrane
  potential; the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential in turn helps to promote
  continued apoptotic cell uptake. Phagocytic receptor Tim-4 may participate in crosstalk
  with the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. Phagosome containing apoptotic cell
  may also be decorated with the LC-3, a marker of macroautophagy that has been shown
  to facilitate phagosome maturation and degradation.
