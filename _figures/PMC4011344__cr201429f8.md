caption: A model of Su(fu) regulation by HIB. (A) Hh induces hib expression through
  the transcription factor Ci. HIB degrades activated Ci (CiA) by forming Cul3-HIB
  E3 ligase complex. Cul3-HIB also downregulates Su(fu) level through Crn that likely
  interferes with normal translation from su(fu) mRNA. Therefore, Hh modulates both
  Ci and Su(fu) through its target HIB to fine-tune the pathway activity. (B) Cul3-HIB
  degrades an unknown substrate “S”, which is essential for Crn nuclear export. In
  the absence of HIB, “S” promotes cytoplasmic localization of Crn; in the presence
  of HIB, Cul3-HIB degrades “S” to promote nuclear accumulation of Crn, which inhibits
  the formation of functional su(fu) mRNA, leading to reduced Su(fu) protein synthesis.
