caption: Main signaling pathways involved in mitochondria-mediated cardioprotection
  by ischemic preconditioning (IPC). IPC is triggered by ligands (i.e., adenosine,
  bradykinin, and opioids, among others) that through receptor-mediated processes
  stimulate signaling pathways involved in cardioprotection. Prosurvival kinases involved
  in these pathways [phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt and Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2]
  are activated and translocated to the mitochondria to exert protective action. Both
  pathways lead to inhibition of GSK-3β, which blocks the mitochondrial permeability
  transition pores (mPTP). Also, the activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling mechanism,
  promote activation of PKCє through the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-nitric
  oxide (NO)-PKG pathway. Stimulation of mitoKATP channel leads to reduced mitochondrial
  potential and inhibition of mPTP opening. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation
  by stimulation of respiratory chain activity promotes the continuous stimulation
  of PKCε and cardioprotection.
