caption: Schematic representation of lactate use by trophoblast cells. In normal pregnancies,
  trophoblast cells use glucose as a fuel to support the placenta’s cellular growth
  (A). The excess of lactate due to fetal metabolism may be driven into the maternal
  circulation by monocarboxylate transports system (MCTs) and AQP9. When the availability
  of glucose is reduced (B), trophoblast cells can use lactate as a carbon source
  substitute (dot lines). The uptake of lactate into the cytosol may be facilitated
  by AQP9 and MCTs localized in the plasma membrane. In the cytosol, lactate can be
  metabolized into pyruvate or it can pass across the external and inner mitochondria
  membranes by MCTs or AQP9. In the mitochondria matrix, lactate may be oxidated to
  pyruvate by a mitochondrial LDH while NAD+ is reduced to NADH. The produced NADH
  may act as a reactive oxygen species scavenger. In preeclamptic placentas, AQP9
  is not functional altering the use of lactate by the trophoblast cells. This may
  affect the mitochondria function, leading to the activation of the mitochondrial
  pathway of apoptosis. OMM, Outer Mitochondria membrane; IMM, Inner Mitochondria
  membrane; ECT, Electron transport chain; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle; and
  MPC 1/2, Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 and 2.
