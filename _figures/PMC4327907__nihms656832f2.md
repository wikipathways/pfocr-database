caption: The blue rectangle on the top represents neural cells while the black rectangle
  on the bottom represents endothelial cells. VEGF and Angiopoietin-2 (Agpt-2) from
  neural cells control endothelial cell survival either separately or by synergistic
  actions. SSeCKS in astrocytes stimulates Angiopoietin-1 (Agpt-1) production under
  hyperoxia, and Agpt-1 enhances interactions between endothelial cells and the extracellular
  matrix (ECM). Our data suggest that unknown pathways from radial glia stabilize
  nascent blood vessels by suppressing endothelial Wnt signaling during later embryonic
  cortical development. In contrast, evidence from the retina suggests that Notch
  signaling pathway positively regulates Wnt signaling by Nrarp in endothelial cells
  and that Wnt signaling is essential for vessel stability. Latent TGFβ is widely
  expressed in the brain, and neural progenitor cells can localize latent TGFβ activation
  via integrin αvβ8 so that active TGFβ is released locally (within the vicinity of
  progenitor cells) to regulate blood vessel stabilization.

    Latent TGFβ is widely expressed in the brain, and neural progenitor cells can
