caption: Oxidative stress and DNA damage links to ECM remodeling. (A) Oxidative stress
  and DNA damage may trigger ECM remodeling by different mechanisms. One possible
  mechanism is associated with ROS-mediated release of TGFβ from the large latent
  complex, allowing it to bind to the TGFβ receptor (1). This promotes the activation
  of the SMAD transcriptional complex, known to promote transcription of ECM genes.
  Another possible mechanism involves the activation of the NF-κβ transcription factor
  (2). This may occur in the presence of oxidative stress leading to NF-κβ mediated
  transcription of TNFα, which in turn further promotes NF-κβ activation and transcriptional
  regulation of ECM genes. NF-κβ can also be activated by DNA damage and control the
  transcription of ECM target genes. The oxidative stress sensor nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2 (NRF2; 3), may also have a crucial role in the transcriptional
  regulation of ECM genes. The transcription factors p53 and p73, which regulate ECM
  gene expression, are both known targets of oxidative stress and DNA damage (4).
  (B) ECM stability is important to prevent the generation of oxidative stress and
  DNA damage. The integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway promotes mitochondrial
  function, via phosphorylation of STAT3, which is implicated in the reduction of
  ROS and maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential (1). Maintaining ECM integrity
  and cell adhesion contributes to sustain nutrient uptake and phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K)/AKT signaling, together reinforcing metabolic regulation, and preventing
  accumulation of ROS (2). Biomechanical properties of the ECM are also critical to
  maintain cell structure (3). An appropriate ECM stiffness maintains mitochondrial
  dynamics, possibly preventing ROS production, and nuclear structure, supporting
  genomic integrity and avoiding DNA damage. Dashed lines represent pathways that
  may involve one or more intermediate players.
