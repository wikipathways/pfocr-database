caption: ABA-mediated signaling pathway in normal and stress conditions. At low ABA
  concentrations in normal conditions the SnRK2 protein kinase activity is inactivated
  by PP2C phosphatases. Under stress conditions ABA binds to PYR/PYL/RCARs, which
  binds and inhibits the P2C phosphatases, releasing the SnRK2 kinases, which then
  phosphorylate downstream targets and trigger ABA-induced physiological responses.
  ArathEULS3 (EULS3) is known to interact with PYL9 and CPK3. TF, transcription factor;
  P, phosphorylation. Figure adapted and re-drawn from ().
