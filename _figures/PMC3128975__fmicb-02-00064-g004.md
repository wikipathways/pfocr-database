caption: Mechanisms of MAPK activation during L. pneumophila infection. MAPKs are
  activated by sequentially induced kinases and in turn phosphorylate cellular and
  nuclear proteins such as transcription factors (Johnson and Lapadat, ; Huang et
  al., ). Inactivation of MAPKs results from dephosphorylation by dual specificity
  phosphatases (DUSPs; Lang et al., ; Jeffrey et al., ). DUSPs are regulated on many
  levels to ensure proper signaling through MAPKs, and MAPKs themselves can control
  DUSPs at the level of transcription and protein stability (Jeffrey et al., ). During
  L. pneumophila challenge of host cells, induction of the MAPK signaling pathway
  occurs through PRR signaling as well as by Icm/Dot-dependent activity in macrophages,
  and via unidentified sensors in amebae (Shin et al., ; Li et al., ). Whether Icm/Dot
  translocated substrates target kinases upstream of MAPK, or, whether interference
  with protein synthesis is sufficient to alter MAPK activity, is unknown (Shin et
  al., ).
