caption: The structure of G protein-coupled receptors and downstream signal transduction
  pathways. It shows that the agonist binds to activate the receptor by inducing a
  conformational change in the transmembrane domain (TM6, blue). The activated receptor
  binds to a variety of intracellular signaling proteins, including G proteins (light
  purple), and GRKs (light orange), that are active (yellow) and inactive (dark orange).
  The coupling of heterotrimer G proteins to the receptor initiates nucleotide exchange,
  and then the G proteins dissociate into the Gα, Gβ and Gγ subunits. Both subunits
  regulate different downstream effector proteins. The GTP-bound Gα subunit regulates
  the activity of adenylate cyclase (AC, dark purple), whilst the Gβ and γ subunits
  interact with the g-protein-coupled internal rectifying potassium channel (GIRK,
  represented by cylindrical TM, green). The G protein-mediated signaling pathway
  is terminated by GTP hydrolysis and the recombination of Gα with Gβ and γ to form
  inactive heterotrimers. Activation of the receptor also leads to phosphorylation
  of GRKs and subsequent coupling of statin. Statin-coupled receptors lead to desensitization
  and statin-mediated activation of downstream effector proteins, such as mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs) or SRC kinases. Statin activation also promotes receptor
  internalization into the endosome and subsequent degradation or circulation into
  the plasma membrane.
