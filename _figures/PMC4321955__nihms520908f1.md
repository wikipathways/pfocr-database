caption: Oxidizable substrates are highlighted by yellow boxes. Chemicals added to
  produce more specific signals are highlighted by orange boxes. Additional modulators
  of electron and proton flux used as positive controls for each assay are highlighted
  by green boxes. Important redox centers within the electron transport chain complexes
  are shown 1) as white circles when uninhibited but not contributing predominantly
  to superoxide (O2•−)/H2O2 production, 2) as red circles when uninhibited and acting
  as the predominant source of O2•−/H2O2 production, and 3) as black circles when
  blocked by potent inhibitors and not contributing to O2•−/H2O2 production. (A) Site
  IQ with 5 mM succinate. Electrons from succinate reduce the mobile ubiquinone pool
  (Q-pool) before ultimately reducing O2 at complex IV (solid line with arrowheads).
  Electron transfer through complex III and complex IV drives the pumping of protons
  to the intermembrane space resulting in an electrochemical gradient of protons across
  the inner membrane (proton motive force, PMF, composed of a pH gradient, ΔpH, and
  a membrane potential, ΔΨm). The combination of a reduced Q-pool and high PMF drives
  the reverse transport of electrons from the Q-pool to NAD+ in the matrix via complex
  I (dashed line with arrowheads). Under this condition, most of the O2•−/H2O2 production
  is from site IQ although a minor portion comes from site IF/DH and site IIIQo [].
  Site IIF O2•−/H2O2 production is inhibited by high succinate and mGPDH is substrate-limited.
  The protonophore FCCP dissipates PMF causing an oxidation of all redox centers and
  acts as a positive control for this assay. An alternative assay utilizing subsaturating
  succinate was also used during compound retesting. In this condition, site IQ remains
  active but contributes proportionally less O2•−/H2O2 due to lower PMF and increased
  activity from site IIF. (B) Site IF/DH with 5 mM malate, 5 mM glutamate and 4 µM
  rotenone. Malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase (MDH) to generate
  NADH that is oxidized by site IF. Glutamate is added to convert oxaloacetate to
  2-oxoglutarate and aspartate by aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) and facilitate
  the continual uptake and oxidation of malate. Rotenone prevents oxidation of redox
  centers upstream of site IQ. This increases the matrix NADH/NAD+ ratio to induce
  O2•− production from site IF while oxidizing redox centers downstream of complex
  I. The formation of 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of a high NADH/NAD+ ratio also
  induces significant O2•− /H2O2 production from 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH).
  The addition of 20 mM aspartate disfavors the transamination of oxaloacetate to
  2-oxoglutarate resulting in lower O2•−/H2O2 production from both site IF and OGDH
  and is used as a positive control for this assay. (C) Site IIF with 15 µM palmitoylcarnitine,
  2 µM myxothiazol and 2.5 µM antimycin A. After reaction with coenzyme A, palmitoylcarnitine
  is metabolized by enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway to yield acetyl-CoA and NADH
  as well as reducing equivalents that enter the Q-pool via electron transferring
  flavoprotein (ETF) and ETF:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETFQOR). Oxidation of the
  Q-pool is prevented by myxothiazol and antimycin A, facilitating the backward entry
  of electrons into complex II and the production of O2•−/H2O2 from site IIF (dashed
  line with arrowheads). Site IIF predominates heavily in this condition, although
  low levels of production from site IF/DH are also observed due to the NADH generated
  during β-oxidation and TCA cycle activity. Malonate potently inhibits this production
  from site IIF and is used as a positive control in this assay. (D) Site IIIQo with
  5 mM succinate, 4 µM rotenone and 2.5 µM antimycin A. In the presence of rotenone
  and antimycin A, the oxidation of succinate strongly reduces the Q-pool. Blockade
  of site IIIQi by antimycin A promotes O2•− production from site IIIQo to both sides
  of the inner membrane. The saturating levels of succinate prevent O2•−/H2O2 production
  from site IIF while rotenone and a lack of PMF prevent production from site IQ.
  Site IF/DH has a minor contribution due to a small increase in matrix NADH due to
  Krebs cycle activity. Myxothiazol potently inhibits site IIIQo and is used as a
  positive control in this assay. An alternative assay utilizing subsaturating succinate
  was also used during compound retesting. In this condition, partial reduction of
  the Q-pool results in maximal O2•−/H2O2 production from site IIIQo. However, unlike
  with saturating succinate, putative inhibitors may cause a lower signal simply through
  partial inhibition of succinate oxidation. (E) mGPDH with 25 mM glycerol phosphate,
  4 µM rotenone, 2.5 µM antimycin A, 1 mM malonate and 2 µM myxothiazol. Oxidation
  of glycerol 3-phosphate causes an over-reduction of redox centers in mGPDH when
  the oxidation of the Qpool is prevented by myxothiazol and antimycin A. This results
  in O2•−/H2O2 production from mGPDH towards both sides of the inner membrane. O2•−/H2O2
  production is prevented at site IQ, site IIF and site IIIQo by rotenone, malonate
  and myxothiazol, respectively. Site IF/DH is fully oxidized under this condition.
  There were no positive controls used for this assay; instead, signals were scaled
  to the signals with FCCP in the site IQ assay. (F) ΔΨm with 5 mM malate, 5 mM glutamate
  and 80 ng • mL−1 nigericin. Malate and glutamate are metabolized as described in
  the site IF/DH assay. However, in the absence of rotenone, electrons are transported
  to reduce O2 at complex IV with proton pumping by complexes I, III and IV generating
  a PMF. The ΔpH component of PMF is converted to ΔΨm by the addition of the K+/H+
  exchanger nigericin. The uptake of the fluorescent cation TMRM into the mitochondrial
  matrix reports ΔΨm. The protonophore FCCP dissipates PMF and acts as a positive
  control for this assay. O2•−, superoxide; PMF, proton motive force across the mitochondrial
