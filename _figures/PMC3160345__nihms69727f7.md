caption: Model of TGFβ signaling during PE cell EMT. While TGFβ stimulates PE explant
  cells to undergo EMT, caALK5 is insufficient to recapitulate this response. caALK2
  drives PE cells to undergo activation, the first step in EMT, while Smad6 inhibits
  epithelial cell activation. BMP-7 does not stimulate epithelial cell activation,
  suggesting ALK2-mediated activation is independent of BMP-7 signaling via the Type
  II activin receptor (ActRII). These data are consistent with a model where TGFβ
  signals via ALK2, and possibly a second unidentified pathway, to elicit EMT in PE
  explants. Data from the endocardial cushion model of EMT suggest that ALK2 signaling
  may also require TBRIII.
