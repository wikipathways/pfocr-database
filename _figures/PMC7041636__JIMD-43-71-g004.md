caption: Interplay between peroxisomal VLCFA degradation and ER fatty acid elongation
  at ACBD5‐mediated MCSs at the PO‐ER interface. At the ER membrane, palmitoyl‐CoA
  (C16) is elongated to form saturated VLCFA‐CoA in four subsequent steps by the enzymes
  ELOVL(1‐7) (elongation of very‐long chain fatty acids protein), KAR (3‐ketoacyl‐CoA
  reductase), HACD(1‐3) (very‐long‐chain‐3‐hydroxyacyl‐CoA dehydratase), and TER (trans‐2,3‐enoyl‐CoA
  reductase). VLCFAs are subsequently incorporated into membrane lipids at the ER
  or, when VLCFA concentrations in the membrane are already high, transferred to peroxisomal
  ACBD5. Long and very‐long chain fatty acid‐CoA synthetases (ACSL and FATP) generate
  fatty acyl‐CoA from the cytosolic free fatty acid pool. ACBD5 “senses” growing concentrations
  of VLCFA‐CoA at the contact site by binding to its ACB domain (probably by direct
  interaction with, for example, ACSL1). Bound VLCFA‐CoA is “handed over” to the peroxisomal
  FA import protein ABCD1 to be imported and degraded by the peroxisomal β‐oxidation
  pathway. Such a regulatory system may prevent excessive incorporation of VLCFA into
  phospholipids, which are as well generated at the ER
