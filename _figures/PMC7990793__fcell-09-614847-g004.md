caption: The potential working model of IL-35 immunepathogenesis in chronic HBV infection.
  The mechanisms of IL-35 mediated immune-suppressive regulation in CHB may be linked
  to both upstream and downstream pathways. When HBV escaped the host immune system,
  it would trigger the release of HBV related protein especially HBx, which subsequently
  activated ERK/AP-1 and IκB/NF-κB signaling pathway to up-regulate IL-35 expression.
  The increase of IL-35 would bind to IL-12Rβ2/gp130 heterodimers receptors, yielding
  the formation of a tetramer. After combining to JAK1 and TYK2 kinases, the tetramer
  was be phosphorylated and eventually activated STAT1/STAT4 pathways by phosphorylation
  of their transcription factor, which tailed the HBV-specific CTLs into a state of
  exhaustion. The decrease of number and function of CTLs would further induce the
  development of chronic HBV infection. The immunological roles of IL-35 were closely
  related to the etiology of CHB.
