caption: Pathogenesis of hRSV and molecules with a biomarker potential induced in
  the airways during hRSV infection. (A) HRSV attaches to airway epithelial cells
  and this binding is mediated by the interaction between the fusion (F) or glycoprotein
  (G) protein of hRSV. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is expressed on AECs and it is
  involved in the hRSV entry. When hRSV F protein binds to TLR4, this triggers a cascade
  of signaling, where the protein myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)
  is activated. The activation of MyD88 leads to activation of mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK), and the NF-kB transcription factor. Activated NF-kB translocates
  to the nucleus and promotes the production of Th1 cytokines (like as TNF-α, IL-6,
  and IL-8). Nucleolin is a protein located on the cell surface that is also involved
  in the entry process of hRSV, which generates a fusion between host cell membrane
  and the virus. This fusion allows the entry of the viral genetic material to the
  cell, and the binding of dsRNA to TLR3. TLR3 triggers a cascade of signaling by
  the TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), MAPKs and NF-kB
  transcription factor. This signaling pathway promotes the IL-33 and TSLP production.
  HRSV also can infect Dendritic Cells (DCs) and the virus mediates its entry by TLR4
  receptor, present on the surface of the DC. DCs are then infected and the genetic
  material of the virus enters the cell. dsRNA binds TLR7 receptor, present in the
  endosome produced by the fusion, which one TLR3 triggers a cascade of signaling
  by the MyD88 protein, MAPKs and NF-kB transcription factor or interferon-regulatory
  factor (IRF). Those signaling pathways promote the IL-12 and IFN-α production, respectively.
  (B) Infected AECs secrete several cytokines and chemokines that have been described
  as potential biomarkers. High IL-33 levels are produced by AECs and cells expressing
  ST2 receptor, such as ILC2s, respond to IL-33 through the production of IL-5 and
  IL-13, which promote the recruitment of eosinophils that generate disease exacerbation
  and is associated to ventilation requirement. The mast cells also express the ST2
  receptor and when IL-33 binds to these receptors the production of IL-3 is promoted.
  AECs produce high levels of IL-8, promoting the recruitment neutrophils to the infection
  site, that could generate a degree of hypoxia, ventilation requirement and asthma
  development. TSLP production is mediate by AECs. This cytokine is recognized by
  the receptor TSLPR, which is expressed by macrophages, generating an exacerbation
  of the disease and asthma. Periostin is produced by AECs or eosinophils. This protein
  increases the expression of inflammatory mediators. Deposits of periostin in the
  lung is associated with increased severity of asthma. IL-6 is produced by AECs and
  promotes a Th2 response. This cytokine is involved in the promotion of naïve differentiation
  to CD4+ and CD8+ T cell. CD4+ T cells trigger the IL-13 production and Th2 overreaction
  response. CD8+ T cells increase the disease severity. IFN-α is produced by pDCs
  and AECs. At late times of infection, high levels of this cytokine produce high
  IL-10 levels by T cells. IL-12 is produced by pDCs and promotes the differentiation
  of naive T cells into Th1 cells and induces weak IFN-γ-production by T cells. This
  low IFN-γ-production generate a Th2 overreaction response. IL-3 promotes basophil
  and eosinophil production, triggering inflammatory and allergic diseases as asthma.
  IL-13 is produced by ILC2 cells and CD4+ T cells, among other. High IL-13 levels
  result in a Th2 overreaction response and the recruitment of eosinophils that generate
  exacerbated mucus production, airway hyperreactivity and inflammation. Different
  lines (dotted and solid) were used to facilitate understanding of the figure and
  the different signaling pathways involved.
