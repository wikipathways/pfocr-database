caption: H. pylori mediate crosstalk with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to manipulate
  signaling in innate immunity. TLRs constitute a group of cell surface and subcellular
  transmembrane receptors in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and epithelial cells.
  H. pylori can interact with at least five TLR members (TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR8, and
  TLR9) in various ways as indicated. TLRs are composed of a leucine-rich repeat-containing
  ectodomain, a transmembrane region and an intracellular tail with the TIR domain.
  H. pylori encodes various factors that have evolved either to target or to evade
  detection by the TLRs. H. pylori LPS, phosphorylated lipid A of LPS, HSP-60, NapA,
  DNA, and RNA are reported in various studies to be recognized by specific TLRs as
  shown. However, nonphosphorylated lipid A and flagellin evade the recognition by
  TLR4 and TLR5, respectively. The TIR domain in TLRs has a crucial role in adapter
  protein recruitment and the activation of downstream signaling cascades. TLR activity
  is initiated by PAMP-induced receptor dimerization and TIR engagement with the adapter
  proteins MyD88 or TRIF as indicated. Binding between a given TLR and MyD88 results
  in the recruitment of members from the IRAK kinase family. IRAK members are sequentially
  phosphorylated and dissociated from MyD88. This results in the activation of TRAF6,
  which in turn stimulates signaling through MAP kinases and IKK complex leading to
  the activation of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 and the production of pro-
  and anti-inflammatory mediators. The adapter protein TRIF participates in the MyD88-independent
  TLR4 pathway as well as in the TLR3 signaling cascade. TRAF3 is recruited for the
  TRIF-mediated pathway mediating the production of type-I interferons and in some
  cases anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [, ]. Endosomal TLR-mediated signaling leads
  to the induction of type-I interferons by the engagement of the transcription factor
  IRF as indicated. Question marks indicate activities/pathways which are not fully
  clear and require further investigation. For more details, see text.
