caption: 'Edges represent chemical conversions between model components with arrows
  indicating reaction directionality. Metabolites and reactions constituting the polyamine
  biosynthetic pathway that are considered in this model are emphasised with bold
  type, with time-variant metabolites shown in green and constant metabolites shown
  in pink. Enzymes catalysing each active elementary step in the pathway are denoted
  with blue boxes. The remaining modules of the network shown in grey are not modelled
  but help gaining an overall picture of the metabolism. Abbreviations of polyamine
  metabolites: Met, methionine; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; dAdoMet, decarboxylated
  AdoMet; MTA, methylthioadenosine; AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; Orn, ornithine;
  Put, putrescine; Spd, spermidine; , total trypanothione; , exogenous methionine;  exogenous
  ornithine. Abbreviations of intra-cellular polyamine enzymes: MetPt, Met uptake
  enzyme; MAT, AdoMet synthase; AHS, methyltransferase; AdoMetDC, AdoMet decarboxylase;
  MetRcy, Met recycling enzyme; OrnPt, Orn uptake enzyme; ODC, Orn decarboxylase;
  SpdS, Spd synthase; TSHSyn, synthesis catalyst; TSHCpt,  consumption catalyst.'
