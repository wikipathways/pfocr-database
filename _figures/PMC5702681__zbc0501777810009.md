caption: Schematic diagram of GAC biosynthesis. GAC is anchored to peptidoglycan presumably
  via phosphodiester bond. GAC biosynthesis is initiated on the inner leaflet of the
  plasma membrane where GacO produces GlcNAc-P-P-Und, which serves as a membrane-anchored
  acceptor for polyrhamnose synthesis catalyzed by the GacB, GacC, GacF, and GacG
  rhamnosyltransferases. Following polymerization, polyrhamnose is transferred to
  the outer leaflet of the membrane presumably by the GacD/GacE ABC transporter. Also
  in the inner leaflet of the membrane, GacI aided by GacJ produces GlcNAc-P-Und,
  which then diffuses across the plasma membrane to the outer leaflet aided by GacK.
  Subsequently, GacL transfers GlcNAc to polyrhamnose using GlcNAc-P-Und as glycosyl
  donor. Finally, protein members of LytR-CpsA-Psr phosphotransferase family presumably
  attach GAC to peptidoglycan. Several details of this biosynthetic scheme are still
  speculative, and further research will be required to definitively confirm this
  hypothetical pathway, but the overall organization is consistent with other isoprenol-mediated
  capsular polysaccharide pathways.
