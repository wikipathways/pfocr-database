caption: Mechanism of action of natural product-targeted modulation of PCD for the
  treatment of CRC. Apoptosis is regulated by internal and external pathways, the
  Bcl-2 family regulates the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activates
  Caspase-9 and Caspase-3/7; the exogenous pathway promotes cell death by activating
  Caspase-3/7 through Caspase-8. Autophagy is the response of the ULK1 complex (ULK1/Atg13/FIP200)
  to nutrient deficiency by phosphorylating Beclin1; the latter forms the Vps34-Atg6
  complex with Atg14, which drives nucleation of the autophagosome membrane and completes
  autophagosome formation. Ferroptosis is iron-dependent cell death, where ROS excess
  triggers lipid peroxidation via Fe2+ catalysis, GSH and GPX-4 antioxidant deficiencies,
  and Fe2+ to Fe3+ conversion led to cell death. Pyroptosis is triggered by NLRP3
  activation of caspase-1/18, which shears GSDMD and forms pores that trigger cell
  rupture and inflammatory responses. Necroptosis is a receptor-mediated cell death
  mechanism mediated by RIPK1, RIPK3. RIPK1 binds to FADD to activate caspase-8, which
  induces apoptosis; under specific conditions, RIPK3 activates MLKL, which leads
  to rupture of the cell membrane and triggers necroptotic cell death. Created with
