caption: Model for the HptB regulatory network. HptB has a negative impact on PA3346
  activity. In the absence of HptB, PA3346 dephosphorylates the putative anti-anti-σ
  factor PA3347 (yellow) through the activity of its PP2C domain (in blue). Dephosphorylated
  PA3347 could bind a putative anti-σ factor (purple), which allows the release of
  a yet uncharacterized σ factor (green). This σ factor may have a specific impact
  on rsmY gene expression, but not on rsmZ gene expression. The controlled expression
  of rsmY through the HptB/PA3346/PA3347 cascade is still GacA-dependent, suggesting
  GacA synergistically acts on the rsmY promoter together with the unknown σ factor.
  Overproduction of RsmY alone (through the PA3346/PA3347 pathway) results in overexpression
  of pel genes and repression of T3SS genes but not in overexpression of the T6SS
  genes, which are specifically controlled through the RetS pathway. The rest of the
  model integrates previous published data. The activity of RsmY and RsmZ is through
  RsmA titration, which is not represented in the figure. The RetS control through
  interference with the GacS activity was previously published (). The potential role
  of three hybrid sensors, PA2824, PA1611 or PA1976 on HptB activation and the retro-transfer
  of phosphate from HptB onto RetS comes also from previously published data ().
