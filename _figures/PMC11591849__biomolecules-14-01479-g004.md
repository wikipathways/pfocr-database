caption: 'Schematic presentation of signaling pathways influenced by anti-diabetic
  drugs to counteract doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Metformin may enhance cardiac function
  by modulating autophagy and mitophagy pathways, which is evidenced by the normalization
  of autophagy markers such as beclin-1, LC3B-II, and p62. Liraglutide demonstrates
  the ability to reduce inflammation and apoptosis by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α), downregulating the pro-apoptotic caspase-3, and upregulating
  the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. On the other hand, linagliptin exhibits anti-oxidant
  properties, potentially reducing oxidative stress through the reduction of GPx activity,
  thereby limiting ROS generation, decreasing lipid peroxidation, and mitigating MDA
  formation. This process preserves cellular integrity and improves myocardial fiber
  structure, which is crucial in alleviating DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. Lastly, empagliflozin
  is illustrated to potentially mitigate DOX-related cardiac injury by enhancing mitochondrial
  biogenesis through the activation of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway. Additionally,
  it may reduce ferroptosis and enhance ketogenesis, contributing further to its cardioprotective
  effects [176,188,189,199,200,201]. Abbreviations: AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase;
