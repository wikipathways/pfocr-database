caption: The biosynthetic pathway and challenges for provitamin A metabolic engineering.
  (A) Regulatory points; (B–E) Structures of carotenoids and their precursors. Pro-vitamin
  A carotenoids are highlighted in orange. Enzymes with transcript abundance and/or
  allelic polymorphisms that positively associate with provitamin A carotenoid content
  are indicated in blue, and those with negative correlation in red (based on Harjes
  et al., ; Li et al., ; Vallabhaneni and Wurtzel, ; Vallabhaneni et al., , ; Yan
  et al., ). Not shown are CCD1 and ZEP for which transcripts levels are inversely
  associated with carotenoid content. CMK, 4-diphosphocytidyl-methylerythritol kinase;
  CRTISO, carotenoid isomerase; CYP97A/HYD3, β-hydroxylase; CYP97C, ε-hydroxylase;
  DXR, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase; DXS3, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate
  synthase 3; GGPPS1, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 1; HDR, hydroxymethylbutenyl
  4-diphosphate reductase; HDS, hydroxymethylbutenyl 4-diphosphate synthase; IDI,
  isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; LCYB, β-cyclase; LCYE, ε-cyclase; MCT, methylerythritol
  4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; MDS, methylerythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase;
  PDS, phytoene desaturase; PSY1, phytoene synthase 1; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase;
  Z-ISO, 15-cis-ζ-carotene isomerase; CCD1, carotene cleavage dioxygenase 1; ZEP,
  zeaxanthin epoxidase.
