caption: Examples of additional complexities in PSTF regulation. (a) PSTF in BGC cross
  talk. (b) In-cluster and out-of-cluster locations of two PSTFs regulating a single
  BGC. Purple indicates backbone genes; red indicates positive PSTF genes; grey indicates
  tailoring genes involved in the SM biosynthetic pathways. The dotted black arrow
  indicates the process of protein translation by the PSTF gene; the dotted red arrow
  indicates the positive regulation by the PSTF for all the other biosynthetic genes
  in the cluster; the solid red arrow indicates positive regulation by the PSTF for
  the specific gene; the solid grey arrow with an “X” indicates that gliT is not under
  the regulation of the PSTF GliZ. (a) is based on this figure in reference [].
