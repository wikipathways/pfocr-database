caption: The limonoid metabolism pathway in citrus plants. Limonoid glucosyltransfease
  (LGT) is the only single regulatory enzyme that is able to convert all limonoid
  aglycones such as nomilin, obacunone and ichangin present in Citrus spp. to their
  respective glucosides, in addition to limonoate A-ring lactone (LARL) to limonin
  glucopyranoside. During juicing process bitter limonin is immediately produced from
  LARL precursor by limonin D-ring lactone hydrolase (LLH) regulatory enzyme, especially
  in early to mid-stage developed citrus fruits
