caption: AD-like neuropsychiatric dysfunction in a mice model induced by the combination
  of high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Apart from the
  Aβ accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation, the neuron damage and activation of
  microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus, as well as the imbalanced protein expression
  of the IRS1/AKT/ERK signaling pathway and TREM1/2, may also be involved in AD-like
  pathological process
