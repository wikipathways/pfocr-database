caption: 'Moderate acute intermittent hypoxia (mAIH) triggers serotonin (5-HT) release
  on/near phrenic motor neurons. Activation of phrenic 5-HT type 2 receptors initiates
  downstream signaling, leading to phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 MAPK and subsequent
  BDNF protein synthesis. Activation of TrKB signaling by BDNF propagates the cascade
  to enhance synaptic efficacy and increase in excitatory respiratory drive onto phrenic
  motor neurons. This enhanced excitatory drive manifests itself as long-lasting enhancement
  of phrenic motor output (i.e., pLTF). In the proposed model, morphine is metabolized
  into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) and other metabolites.
  M3G binds to the microglial TLR4-MD-2 complex, initiating an innate immune response
  that involves p38 MAPK phosphorylation/activation and downstream pro-inflammatory
  gene expression/cytokine production. Pro-inflammatory cytokines consequently activate
  downstream signaling within the phrenic motor pool that inhibit mAIH-induced plasticity
  of phrenic motor neuronal synapses (e.g. pLTF). Pro-inflammatory cascades may inhibit
  pLTF by acting at multiple sites: they may negatively regulate 5-HT2 signaling at
  the level of MEK and/or at the ERK 1/2 activation loop. Inhibition of TLR4 signaling
  prior to morphine delivery permits 5-HT2-mediated MEK-ERK1/2 signaling, leaving
  mAIH-induced pLTF unperturbed. Broken lines: undefined inhibitory feedback site
  at or below MEK level. Broken arrows: hypothesized pathway with unknown precise
  mechanism in the proposed model. TLR4-MD2 complex: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–myeloid
  differentiation factor 2 (MD2) complex; P-p38 MAPK: phosphorylated p38 MAPK. Adapted
  and modified from .'
