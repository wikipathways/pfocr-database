caption: 'Extracellular signaling pathways, generated in human and mouse embryonic
  stem cells (hPSCs and mPSCs, respectively), muscle satellite stem cells (MuSCs),
  induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and neural
  stem cells (NSCs) modulate intracellular metabolic pathways. Metabolic flux then
  regulates cell identity through one or more of four main pathways: epigenetics [orange],
  redox status [green], reactive oxygen signaling (ROS) signaling [red], hypoxia induced
  factor (HIF) signaling [blue]. Large arrows with open arrowheads represent activating
  signals while repressive signals are marked by barred lines. Grey lines represent
  pathways that are repressed by aerobic glycolysis or glutaminolysis. Small arrows
  with closed arrowheads indicate whether that adjacent pathway, metabolite, signaling
  molecule, epigenetic mark, or metabolite ratio is increased or decreased. Abbreviations:
  mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), PD0325901
  and CHIR99021 inhibitors (2i), Jumonji C domain-containing proteins (JMJC), ten
  eleven translocation enzymes (TET), human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), fibroblast
  growth factor (FGF), muscle satellite stem cells (MuSC), ratio of oxidized to reduced
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+:NADH), NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin
  1 (SIRT1), octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), Kruppel like factor 4
  (KLF4), reprograming factors: OCT4, KLF4, Sex determining region Y-box 2, MYC (OKSM),
  estrogen-related receptor α and γ (ERRα/γ), nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NFR2),
  oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neural stem cells
  (NSCs)'
