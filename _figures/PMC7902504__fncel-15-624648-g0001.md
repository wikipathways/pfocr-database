  neurons. (C) Most excitatory neurons on maturation form actin rich protrusions called

  hippocampal and cortical neurons. (D) Calcium influx through N-methyl D-aspartate
  (NMDA) receptors and voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) activate CaMK kinases,
  which mediate spine morphogenesis and plasticity. Mutations in several kinases important
  for dendritic spine formation are associated with neuropsychiatric diseases.

  description: Kinase pathways mediate dendritic morphogenesis and maturation. (A)
    Immature dendritic neurites undergo expansive growth and branching during early
    development. The PI3K-Akt-mTor kinase and Hippo pathway are critical for growth.
    Activity dependent growth is primarily mediated by Ca+2 influx and downstream
    signaling by CaMK family members. (B) During arborization, dendrites of the same
    neuron avoid overlap through a principle known as self-avoidance, while neighboring
    neurons of the same type grow in well-defined territories. Kinases that mediate
    self-avoidance and dendritic tiling have been identified through screens in Drosophila
    peripheral sensory da neurons. (C) Most excitatory neurons on maturation form
    actin rich protrusions called dendritic spines that serve as sites of synapse
    formation. Several kinases that regulate the synaptic cytoskeleton are important
    regulators of spine formation in hippocampal and cortical neurons. (D) Calcium
    influx through N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and voltage gated calcium
    channels (VGCC) activate CaMK kinases, which mediate spine morphogenesis and plasticity.
    Mutations in several kinases important for dendritic spine formation are associated
    with neuropsychiatric diseases.
