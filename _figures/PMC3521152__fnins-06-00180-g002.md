caption: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone signaling. TRH mobilizes intracellular calcium
  and activates protein kinase C through a well-characterized, Gq/11-dependent pathway.
  Phospholipase Cβ1, which is activated primarily by Gα-GTP subunits, is the major
  effector in pituitary cells. Intracellular calcium and protein kinase C initiate
  multiple responses including activation of MAP kinase and regulation of ion channels.
