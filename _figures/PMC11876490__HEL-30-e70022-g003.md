caption: Enrichment by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway terms were visualized using
  the ClueGO/CluePedia plugin from Cytoscape. (A) The biological process (BP), molecular
  function (MF), and cellular component (CC) of DEGs PPI network of AGSEVs‐TN2wt and
  AGSEVs‐NI are shown. (B) The REACTOME pathway. The enrichment shows only significant
  GO terms and pathways (p < 0.05). The node color indicates the specific functional
  class that they are involved in. The colors represent various BP, MF, CC, and molecular
  pathways involved in the enrichment analysis of identified DEGs. The bold fonts
  indicate the most important functional GO terms and name of signaling pathway of
  each group. The names of the DEGs involved in each group are displayed in red font.
  The DEGs related to gastric cancer were shown in the black block
