caption: The various enzymes and intermediates generated through this de novo synthesis
  of NAD+ from tryptophan are shown together with the salvage pathway route for generation
  of NAD+ from nicotinamide, catalysed by NAMPT. Enzymes for which we have strong
  evidence of downregulation in RCC tissues are marked with a solid grey arrow. Enzymes
  or substrates observed to be upregulated are marked with a hatched arrow. Enzymes
  with evidence to suggest they may be down regulated are marked by an open grey arrow.
