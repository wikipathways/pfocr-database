caption: A soluble recombinant molecule consisting of the extracellular domains of
  CD80 linked to the Fc domain of Ig (soluble CD80 or CD80-Fc) has the potential to
  maintain and facilitate T cell activation through three independent mechanisms.
  (i) CD80-Fc could block the PD-1 suppressive pathway by binding to PD-L1 on tumor
  cells or activated T cells and preventing binding to PD-1 on activated T cells;
  (ii) CD80-Fc could activate tumor-reactive T cells by binding to PD-L1 on tumor
  cells and simultaneously costimulating through CD28 on T cells; (iii) CD80-Fc could
  prevent the tolerance induced by reverse signalling of PD-L1 through CD80 on T cells
  by binding to PD-L1 on tumor cells. TcR = T cell receptor; pMHC = peptide-MHC complex;
  APC = antigen-presenting cell; ? = CD80-Fc probably does not bind to CTLA4 although
  theoretically it should bind
