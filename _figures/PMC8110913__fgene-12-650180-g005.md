caption: Pathway analysis of the key lncRNAs associate ceRNA network. The ceRNA-pathway
  network was constructed with the six candidate lncRNAs. Triangle nodes indicate
  dysregulated lncRNAs, regular hexagon nodes represent mRNAs, and diamond nodes represent
  dysregulated miRNAs. The blue nodes of lncRNAs, mRNAs and miRNAs indicate downregulated
  expression, while the red nodes indicate upregulated expression. The shape of V
  indicates the pathways in which lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs might involve. (A) The
  upregulated key lncRNAs and related ceRNA-pathway network. (B) The downregulated
  key lncRNAs and related ceRNA-pathway network.
