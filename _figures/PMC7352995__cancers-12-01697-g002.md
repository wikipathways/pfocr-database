caption: Role of fibroblasts in mammary gland branching and BC growth. Mammary branching
  morphogenesis and BC growth share many cellular processes, including epithelial
  cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling.
  These similarities explain why many morphogenic processes induced by fibroblasts
  are exploited intensively also in BC. (A) In normal conditions, fibroblasts guide
  mammary epithelial branching through paracrine signals that are mediated by growth
  factors, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
  fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2, and FGF9, low concentrations of transforming growth
  factor (TGF)-β and tightly regulated activation of the epithelial growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. The expression of Sprouty/Spred family members
  in stromal cells plays a very important role during mammary branching. These morphogenic
  processes activated by fibroblasts are tightly controlled to ensure normal mammary
  gland development. (B) However, they become dysregulated and subverted during BC.
  In fact, BCAFs support BC growth by increasing extensively the same morphogenic
  pathways required for normal gland development. BCAFs massively upregulate the platelet
  derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)α and EGFR signaling pathways, and produce
  higher levels of FGFs, HGF, and TGF-β than normal fibroblasts. The loss of Spry
  genes promotes, in fibroblasts, a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like phenotype
  and thus leads to BC growth.
