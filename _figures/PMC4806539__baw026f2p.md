caption: 'Biological networks according to IPA of 1370 genes related to HNSCC. (A)
  The canonical pathway ‘Molecular mechanisms of cancer’ and the growing picture of
  molecular mechanisms in HNSCC: receptor signaling pathways are induced by hormone,
  growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins or cytokines, leading to the activation
  of different cytoplasmatic effectors and transcription factors, and promoting cell
  cycle regulation, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell survival and proliferation. (B)
  Beta-estradiol as an upstream regulator in head and neck tumorigenesis: network
  enriched in transcription factors/regulators (ESR1 and 2, JUN, TP53, NFKB1, RELA,
  STAT1 and 3, SP1), signal transducers (SMAD3 and 4), DNA repair protein (BRCA1)
  and proinflammatory cytokines (IL6, TGFB1, TNF) identified by the present study.
  Solid arrows = known interactions; dotted arrows = indirect interactions; inverted
  triangle = kinase; double circle = complex; circle, ellipse, diamond or square = other;
  filled shapes = genes from our list; nonfilled shapes = genes that are part of the
  network but not part of the list.'
