caption: Visualizations of part of the “PKC-gamma calcium signaling pathway in ataxia.”
  (A) Node fill color is used to describe genes with mutations relevant to ataxia;
  orange indicates an activating mutation, and gray indicates an inactivating mutation.
  (B) When experimental data are visualized as node fill color, the mutation information
  is lost. (C) Mutations are shown as an added graphic to nodes; an orange triangle
  indicates an activating mutation, and a gray hexagon indicates an inactivating mutation.
  (D) Data visualization does not interfere with the mutation information, and both
  data types are visualized. Pathways were visualized in Cytoscape []. PKC, protein
  kinase C.
