caption: A schematic summary of the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in regulating apoptosis
  cascade in lung cancer via Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Accumulating evidence has delineated
  that apoptotic cells are negative for β-catenin. This indicates that the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling cascade could be inactive in apoptotic cells. Whilst, β-catenin is expressed
  in the membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus of non-apoptotic epithelial cells around
  these apoptotic cells. Therefore, Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade could be activated
  in non-apoptotic epithelial cells via apoptotic cells (). As an illustration, downregulation
  of miR-125b could play an effective role in inhibiting expression of p-Akt, p-GSK3β,
  Wnt, and β-catenin, and could promote caspase-3 activity and Bax protein expression
  in human non-small cell lung cancer. Thereby, this could lead to suppressing the
  proliferation and triggering the apoptosis of tumor cells (). Furthermore, another
  study have illustrated that upregulation of lncRNA SNHG20 could have a crucial part
  in elevating the proliferation and suppressing the apoptosis of NSCLC cells through
  targeting miR-197 via regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade. Downregulation
  of this lncRNA could result in remarkable reduction of TCF and LEF1 expression in
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway ().
