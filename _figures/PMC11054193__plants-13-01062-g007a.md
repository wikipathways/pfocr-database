  epoxidase; NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase; ABA2, xanthoxin dehydrogenase;
  AAO3, abscisic-aldehyde oxidase; PYR/PYL, pyrabactin resistance–like; PP2C, protein
  phosphatase 2C; SnRK2, sucrose non–fermenting–1–related protein kinase 2; ABF, ABA-responsive
  element–binding factors; AOG, abscisate beta-glucosyltransferase; MAPK, mitogen–activated
  protein kinase; TPI, triosephosphate isomerase; gapN, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; gpmI, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase;

  pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha; PDHB, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  E1 component subunit beta; DLAT, pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 component (dihydrolipoyllysine-residue
  acetyltransferase); HMGCS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HMGCR, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase; MVK, mevalonate kinase; MVD, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase; GGPS,
  geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, type II; FDPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase;
  dxr, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase; ispD, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; ispF, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate
  synthase; gcpE, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase; PDS, 15-cis-phytoene
  desaturase and ZDS, zeta-carotene desaturase. DMs involved in the carotenoid biosynthesis
  pathway: C06082, Abscisate; C15970, Abscisic acid glucose ester; C00111, Glycerone
  phosphate and C00416, Phosphatidate. (b) An overview of photosynthetic processes
  and circadian rhythms in plants. DEGs involved in photosynthesis and circadian pathways
  in plants: PIF3, phytochrome-interacting factor 3; CSNK2A, casein kinase II subunit
  alpha; LHCA2, light-harvesting complex I chlorophyll a/b binding protein 2; LHCA3,
  light-harvesting complex I chlorophyll a/b binding protein 3; LHCA5, light-harvesting
  complex I chlorophyll a/b binding protein 5; PsbP, photosystem II oxygen-evolving
  enhancer protein 2; PetH, ferredoxin--NADP+ reductase and petJ, cytochrome c6. Where
  heat maps depict changes in genes and metabolites. On the metabolite heat map, a
  significant down-regulation is indicated by a green hue, while significant up-regulation
  is indicated by a bluer color. Considerable down-regulation is shown by the gene
  heatmap’s more purple color, while considerable up-regulation is indicated by its
  more brown color'
