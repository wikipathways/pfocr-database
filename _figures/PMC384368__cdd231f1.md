caption: Fig. 1. Model of regulation of the R.solanacearum Hrp type III secretion
  system in response to plant signal(s). Above, genetic organization of the hrp gene
  cluster, with grey arrows showing the orientation and length of the hrp transcriptional
  units. A new nomenclature has distinguished hrp and hrc (for hrp-conserved) genes,
  the latter are homologues of type III secretion genes of animal pathogens and are
  predicted to encode components of the type III secretion apparatus. Four proteins,
  the harpin PopA, PopB, PopC and HrpY have been described to be secreted by the Hrp
  pathway into the extracellular medium. HrpY is the structural component of the Hrp
  pilus, an essential extracellular structure involved in PopA secretion. The outer
  membrane protein PrhA controls the plant-responsive regulatory cascade composed
  of PrhJ, HrpG and HrpB, the final activator of hrp transcription units 1–4 and 7.
  Two additional regulatory components (dotted lines) have recently been identified
  (B.Brito and S.Genin, unpublished). The HrpG protein integrates another hrp-inducing
  signal pathway, which is dependent on the nutrient/metabolic status of the bacterium.
  This model is based on data compiled from , , ,  and .
