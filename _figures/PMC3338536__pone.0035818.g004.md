caption: The data from the RNAi screen was processed to calculate MAD scores and was
  used for Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). The network annotated “Skeletal and Muscular
  System Development and Function, Tissue Morphology, Inflammatory Response" ranked
  at the top with the highest score and is shown in the figure. The hits that increased
  SOD1 levels above 3SD are shown in red and the ones that decreased the signal below
  −2SD are shown in green. The proteins represented by color-less nodes were below
  the selection criteria. Direct interactions are shown in bold lines and indirect
  interactions are shown in broken lines. (See  for proteins in this network)
