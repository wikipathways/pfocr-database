caption: 'The structure and signaling pathway of P2YRs in bone. P2Y1-like and P2Y12-like
  receptors are expressed in most types of bone cells (expression status of P2YRs
  in bone lining cells is current unknown) and are activated by extracellular nucleotides
  present in the microenvironment. The topological characteristics of P2YRs are: an
  extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus; seven transmembrane domains
  forming the ligand docking pocket; the C-terminus has the protein kinases binding
  motif and influence the degree of P2Y subtypes coupling with Gq/G11, Gαs and Gi/Go
  proteins via intracellular loop structural diversity. Binding of different G proteins
  leads to downstream signaling cascades including calcium signaling transduction
  and regulation of AC/cAMP pathway (Figure was created with Biorender).'
