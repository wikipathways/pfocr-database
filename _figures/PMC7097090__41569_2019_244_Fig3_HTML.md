caption: Signalling through the type 2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2R) can directly
  inhibit AT1R activation and thus antagonize the effects of angiotensin II. Stimulation
  of AT2R can also inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2
  by activating Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP1) and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase-phosphatase 1 (MKP1), which can result in attenuation of cardiac
  hypertrophy. AT2R can also activate the transcription factor promyelocytic zinc
  finger protein (PLZF), thereby inducing the expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase
  β1 (p70S6K) and p85α expression and, in turn, eliciting protein synthesis. In addition,
  AT2R might trigger vasodilatation by activating the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K)–AKT–endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)–nitric oxide (NO)–cGMP pathway
  either via angiotensin 1–9-mediated activation– or by heterodimerization with bradykinin
  B2 receptor (B2R). Phosphorylation of AKT by activation of AT2R through angiotensin
  1–9 binding has also been found to confer cardioprotection. Angiotensin 1–7 might
  induce the NO–soluble guanylyl cyclase pathway, thereby triggering vasodilatation
  via proto-oncogene Mas receptor (MasR) activation. Activation of this receptor can
  also reduce cardiac fibrosis by stimulating SHP1 and dual-specificity phosphatase
  (DUSP), consequently inhibiting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
  ERK1 and ERK2. The KCa3.1 channel and mothers against decantaplegic homologue 2
  (SMAD2) and SMAD3 are downstream targets of ERK1 and ERK2, and are downregulated
  upon MasR activation. Additionally, angiotensin 1–7 exerts an anti-hypertrophic
  effect by inhibiting nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) through a MasR–PI3K–AKT–NO–cGMP-dependent
  pathway. This anti-hypertrophic effect also depends on atrial natriuretic peptide
  (ANP) secretion during atrial pacing and is associated with activation of the Na+/H+
  exchanger (NHE1) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) via
  the PI3K–AKT pathway. Cardiac hypertrophy can also be reduced by activation of the
  Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor member D (MRGD) by alamandine via adenylate
  cyclase (AC)–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signalling.
