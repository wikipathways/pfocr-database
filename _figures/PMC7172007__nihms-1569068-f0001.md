caption: 'Wnt ligands bind online but to Frizzled and LRP5/6 leading to Dsh recruitment
  of the β-catenin destruction complex, including GSK3-β, Axin, and APC. This prevents
  the degradation of β-catenin, allowing for cytosolic accumulation and nuclear translocation.
  In the nucleus, β-catenin and CBP form a complex to displace Groucho and bind to
  TCF, activating transcription of TCF family target genes. Early pathway inhibitors
  include C59 which prevents secretion of Wnt ligands; Klotho binds to and sequesters
  Wnt ligands; DKK-1 binds to LRP5/6 to prevent Wnt binding; sFRP4 binds Wnt and Frizzled
  to disrupt signaling; and DKK-2 binds to LRP5/6 to enhance binding of Wnt. Several
  pharmacologic agents alter the activity of components of the destruction complex,
  including lithium and TDZD-8, which inhibit the activity of GSK3-β and GSK-3, respectively,
  and prevents β-catenin degradation. Pyrvinium prevents Axin degradation and XAV939,
  a tankyrase inhibitor, stabilizes cytosolic Axin with both compounds leading to
  enhanced β-catenin degradation, . ICG–001 binds to CBP and reduces β-catenin interactions
  with TCF, thus blocking β-catenin/TCF-dependent target gene expression. This figure
