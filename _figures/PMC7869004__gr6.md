  Interaction prediction and computational drug repositioning from transcriptomics
  data in mouse GC created in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Note: nodes of RAD001-targeted
  mTOR (marked in red), CPI-613-targeted PDP1 and/or α-KGDH (purple), BoNT-A-targeted
  SNAP25 (yellow), and DON/968/CB-839/BPTES-targeted GLS (light blue). Lines represent
  biological relationships between molecules that include proteins, genes, mRNAs,
  microRNAs, and metabolites, generated from differentially expressed drug target
  genes (only drug targets differentially expressed between mouse GC versus WT at
  p < 0.05, q < 0.05 are shown, light gray). Molecule nodes are fetched from RNA sequencing
  data in mouse GC versus WT, edges are generated based on causal information in the
  Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The overlay-tool in IPA is used to predict drugs for indicated
  nodes.See also .'
