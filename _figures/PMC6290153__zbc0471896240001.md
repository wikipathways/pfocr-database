caption: Pathways of polyamines (A), hypusine synthesis (B), and EF-P modification
  (C). A, simplified pathway of polyamine interconversion. Putrescine generated from
  ornithine is converted to spermidine and spermine. B, the posttranslational formation
  of hypusine in eIF5A by two enzymatic steps catalyzed by DHPS and DOHH. The aminobutyl
  moiety of spermidine (red) is used for hypusine synthesis at Lys50 of human eIF5A(Lys).
  The DHPS reaction is reversible (). Model structure of eIF5A is based on the human
  eIF5A (PDB code 1FH4) () with the N-terminal domain I (yellow) containing the hypusine
  site loop (Ser45–Ala54) (orange) and the C-terminal domain II (green). C, EF-P (PDB
  code 1UEB) (), the bacterial ortholog of eIF5A, contains domain III, which is similar
  to domain II and is modified by β-lysylation () followed by hydroxylation. eIF5A(Hpu),
  eIF5A final modified form containing hypusine.
