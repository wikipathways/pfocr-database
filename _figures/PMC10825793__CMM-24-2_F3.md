caption: 'EBV-miRNAs modulating inflammatory signaling pathways. This figure illustrates
  the strategies EBV-encoded miRNAs apply to regulate the inflammatory signaling pathways
  in B cells during EBV infection.1) NF-κB pathway: BART15-3p blocks the maturation
  of IL-1β, IL-16, and IL-18 by inhibiting NLRP3 recognition in NLRP3- NF-κB pathway.
  BHRF1-2-5p and BART17 serve as inhibitors of protein kinases in the NF-κB pathway.2)
  Type I interferons signaling pathway: BART6-3p, 13 and 19 block RIG-I recognition
  of viral double-stranded (ds) RNA, which subsequently perturbs the activation of
  type I interferons signaling pathway. BART1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 20-5p negatively regulate
  the downstream effect of type I IFN signaling.3) MAPK pathway: BART3 and 22 hamper
  MKK3/6 phosphorylation in p38.4) JAK-STAT pathway: BART8 and 20-5p suppress STAT1
  activity.5) Hippo pathway: BART3-3p triggers the activation of AP-1 trimer, thereby
  upregulating IL-6 expression. BART16 directly targets CREB binding protein (CBP)
  to block CREB-dependent transcription. BART1, 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, and 19 indirectly
  exert IFN-α repression, while BART7-3p and 21-3p indirectly exert IFN-β repression.
  BART16 downregulates TNF-α expression.Besides, the cascade effects of inflammatory
  cytokines can be disturbed by EBV-miRNAs, and BHRF1-2-5p and BART6-3p contribute
  to the immune evasion of cytokine-induced inflammatory response via targeting IL-1-receptor
  1 and IL-6-receptor, respectively. Symbols: ↓ activation; ⊥ inhibition; ---–>indirect
