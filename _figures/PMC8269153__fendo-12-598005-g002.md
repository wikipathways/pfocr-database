caption: NRF2-related possibly epigenetic mechanisms in diabetic cardiac complications.
  Inactivation of the Sirt1/NRF2/HO-1 pathway by miR-34a might cause ER stress in
  diabetic myocardial I/R injury. miR-24-3p might activate NRF2 by inhibiting the
  expression of Keap1 to exert an anti-apoptosis effect in diabetic myocardial I/R
  injury. CPDT can activate the NRF2/HO-1 pathway by inhibiting miR-503 to reduce
  oxidative stress in DCM. Methylation of the nfe212 promoter might inactivate NRF2
  and its downstream targets SREBP-1c and FAS to cause lipid accumulation in DCM.
