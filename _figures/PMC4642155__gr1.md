  N-aryl 2-oxopropanehydrazonoyl chlorides 2b with acylhydrazines 3 yielded the condensation
  products 6 ,  (). In an attempt to provide further evidence for the actual pathway
  for the reaction of 2b with acid hydrazides, it was thought interesting to study
  the reaction of the products 6 with some sulfur dipolarophiles. This is because
  products of type 6 still have the hydrazonoyl chloride moiety. Our objective after
  such a study was to explore the utility of compounds of type 6 as precursors in
  syntheses of new thiadiazoline derivatives of expected biological activities. This
  is because many 1,3,4-thiadiazoles have been reported to possess several biological
  activities such as anticancer, antihistaminic and hypoglycemic activities , , .
