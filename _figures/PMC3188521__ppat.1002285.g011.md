caption: (A) FGF2 binds to EBs and facilitates attachment and internalization through
  cell surface HSPG and FGFR. Both early (45 min pi, C. trachomatis replication independent)
  and late (10 hpi, C. trachomatis replication dependent) Erk1/2 activation induce
  fgf2 transcription, resulting in an increase of all FGF2 isoforms. Subsequent intracellular
  replication of C. trachomatis activates host cell proteases that lead to the processing
  and/or loss of the HMW FGF2 isoforms and increased amounts of the 16 and 18 kDa
  isoforms. Upon host cell lysis, EBs, along with the 16 and 18 kDa FGF2 isoforms,
  are released. Released FGF2 binds to EBs and serves as a bridging molecule to enhance
  subsequent rounds of C. trachomatis binding and entry. This positive feedback loop
  between C. trachomatis and FGF2 may enhance the efficiency and spread of subsequent
  rounds of infection. (B) L2-FGF2 binding may involve synergistic interactions with
  OmcB-HSPG interactions. (C) The HSPG-binding domain of OmcB of serovar E is non-functional.
