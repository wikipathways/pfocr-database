caption: Activation of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway by oxidants/electrophiles. Under
  homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm through an interaction
  with Keap1 and the actin cytoskeleton. Keap1 is a five-domain protein consisting
  of an N-terminal broad complex, Tramtrack and Bric-à-brac (BTB) domain, an intervening
  region with cysteine (Cys) residues, a C-terminal Kelch domain with double glycine
  repeats (DGR), and the C-terminal domain. Keap1 homodimerizes at the BTB domain,
  which is also a binding site for Cullin 3 (Cul3). The Keap1 homodimer binds to a
  single Nrf2 molecule through the ETGE and DLG motifs of Nrf2, each binding to a
  DGR domain in Keap1. According to the proposed hinge and latch model [], ETGE is
  a high-affinity motif (“hinge”) whereas DLG is a low-affinity one (“latch”). Keap1
  functions as an adaptor protein in the Cul3-based E3 ligase complex, which results
  in the polyubiquitination (Ub) of the lysine residues situated between the DLG and
  ETGE motifs, and subsequent proteasomic degradation of Nrf2. Under stressed conditions,
  the modification of critical cysteine residues of Keap1 destabilizes its binding
  to the DLG motif of Nrf2, which blocks ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation and
  allows Nrf2 to escape Keap1 control and translocate into the nucleus. In the nucleus,
  Nrf2 heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins and promotes the expression of ARE-containing
  genes involved in cell stress response, drug metabolism, detoxification, and transport.
  Nrf2 may also be phosphorylated (P) by stress-activated kinases.
