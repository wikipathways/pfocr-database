caption: Schematic demonstration of PHB-mediated survival or apoptosis responses in
  multiple cellular compartments of different cell types and molecular mechanism involved.
  At the outer plasma membrane, PHB1 mediates the endocytosis of a pro-apoptotic peptide
  in the induction of apoptosis in the adipose vasculature. At the inner plasma membrane,
  membrane-localized PHB1 or PHB2 associate with C-Raf and is involved in the activation
  of the Raf-mitogen-associated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which can promote cancer cell survival. The serine/threonine-protein
  kinase (AKT) can phosphorylate PHB1 in the cytoplasm and promotes PHB1 mitochondrial
  translocation to induce bladder cancer proliferation. The anticancer agent rocaglamides
  mediates the pro-apoptotic action by disrupting the PHB1/C-Raf or PHB2/C-Raf interaction.
  However, increased membrane localization of PHB1 and the PHB1/C-Raf complex in activated
  hepatic stellate cells may promote Tan IIA-induced apoptosis. The ring-shaped PHB
  complex in mitochondria may regulate mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial morphology,
  mitochondrial genome, the electron transport chain (ETC), reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) homeostasis, and anti-apoptotic proteins, which further prevent mitochondria-mediated
  apoptosis. Nuclear PHB1 co-localizes with many transcription factors, such as p53,
  Rb, E2F, AIF, c-myc, and c-fos, which may influence the cell cycle and tumor growth
  in a coordinated manner. PHB1 can upregulate p53-mediated transcription but repress
  E2F activity in B cell lymphoma cells, and overexpression of PHB1 protects cells
  from camptothecin-induced apoptosis. In the absence of p53, both PHB1 and PHB2 can
  contribute to P53 inducible gene 3 (PIG3)-mediated apoptosis by increasing the transcription
  of PIG3
