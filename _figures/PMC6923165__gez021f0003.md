caption: Time-dependent changes of gene expression of the KRAS signaling pathway after
  treatment of PDAC model cell lines differing by the KRAS mutation status with paclitaxel
  in vitro. Map of consensus in the KRAS signaling pathway expression profiles of
  paclitaxel (30, 100 and 300 nM) treated BxPc-3, PaCa-44 and MiaPaCa-2 cell lines
  treated with the same paclitaxel concentrations for 24 h (A) and 72 h (B) compared
  to corresponding untreated controls. Genes upregulated in a concentration dependent
  manner are in red (in black and white resolution represented in dark colour) and
  downregulated genes in green (in black and white resolution represented in light
  colour). Genes without differential expression are without color. Time-dependent
  differences are highlighted by rectangles. Changes present only after 24 h treatment
  are in light grey rectangles in the B part and changes present only after 72 h treatment
  are in dark grey rectangles in the A part. MAPK pathway scaffold is in rounded rectangle.
