caption: Schematic representation of main changes observed by Te (IV) exposure. The
  image represents a bacilli-like cell labelled well well-defined geometric shapes
  representing proteins listed in Table S2; red arrows represent negative effects
  on the cell and green arrows represent positive effects on the cell. Non-labelled
  undefined geometric blue or purple shapes represent generic cellular proteins. Outside
  the cell, large arrows represent the metabolic pathway with significant over/ down
  representation
