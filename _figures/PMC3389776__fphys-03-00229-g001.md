caption: Amyloid protein precursor structure and metabolism. Schematic representation
  of APP processing by α-, β-, and γ-secretases. APP processing by secretase activities
  is divided into the non-amyloidogenic pathway on the left and the amyloidogenic
  pathway on the right. α- and β-secretase activities cleave APP in its extracellular
  domain to release respectively a soluble fragment sAPPα or sAPPβ in the extracellular
  space and generate carboxy-terminal fragments CTFα or CTFβ. These CTFs can subsequently
  be processed by γ-secretase complex to generate AICD and Aβ. The γ-secretase complex
  is composed of presenilin, nicastrin (NCT), γ-secretase activating protein (GSAP),
  pen-2, and aph-1.
