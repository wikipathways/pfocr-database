caption: Oxidative thiol modifications of GapDH—From cytoprotection to cytotoxicity.
  (A) ROS-mediated inhibition of GapDH re-routes metabolic flux as immediate defense
  against oxidative insult. Oxidative stress-induced inhibition of GapDH as a central
  component of glycolysis leads to the rapid re-routing of glucose-6-phosphate into
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), one of the key routes for NADPH production
  in the eukaryotic cytoplasm. NADPH serves as electron donor for glutathione reductase
  and thioredoxin reductase, and is therefore essential to restore and maintain the
  reducing environment of the cytosol. (B) Model of GapDH/Siah1-signaling cascade-dependent
  cell death. Exposure of GapDH to RNS causes S-nitrosation of Cys150 in GapDH. S-nitrosation
  stimulates the interaction between the E3-ubiquitin ligase Siah1 and GapDH. Siah1,
  which possesses a nuclear localization signal (NLS), escorts GapDH into the nucleus
  where the association between GapDH and Siah1 appears to stabilize the E3-ligase.
  This stabilization, in turn, increases the rate of degradation for a set of different
  target proteins, and ultimately triggers cell death. (C) Model of apoptosis triggered
  by ROS-mediated GapDH aggregation. Exposure of GapDH to excess ROS leads to the
  initial disulfide bond formation between either Cys150 and Cys154 (intramolecular
  disulfide bond) or between two active site cysteines Cys150. The latter leads to
  extensive conformational changes and exposes additional cysteines (e.g., Cys281)
  that undergo further intermolecular disulfide bond formation. This results in the
  accumulation of insoluble aggregates composed of multiple GapDH subunits in the
  cytosol and the nucleus. The aggregates are either intrinsically cytotoxic or interact
  with other aggregation-prone proteins (e.g., Aß, tau, α-synuclein) to cause cytotoxicity.
  For reasons of simplicity, only one subunit of the GapDH tetramer is shown.
