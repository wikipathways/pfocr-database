caption: 'Proposed model for the role of TRPC1 in Darier''s disease: We propose that
  in Darier''s disease keratinocytes, the nonfunctional SERCA fails to maintain the
  adequate ER calcium pool (⊝, compromised function). This decreased SERCA activity
  in turn up-regulates the store-operated plasma membrane calcium channel TRPC1, in
  an undefined mechanism dependent on NF-κB. Overexpressed TRPC1 channels augment
  store-operated calcium influx. The incoming calcium is pumped out via the plasma
  membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) and also used for the cells physiological need. An
  optimal level of this calcium brings about proper growth and proliferation (⊕, positive
  effect) by activating NF-κB pathway. This confers resistance to apoptosis by regulating
  the expression of proproliferative/antiapoptotic genes. However, if there is an
  overload this calcium might be detrimental, leading to stress-induced apoptosis
  or uncontrolled proliferation accounting for cancerous state (?). It is also proposed
  that isotretinoin, by yet another undefined mechanism (?) regulates the calcium
  influx via TRPC1 and blocks the calcium overload, thereby inhibiting hyperproliferation
  and probably cancer.'
