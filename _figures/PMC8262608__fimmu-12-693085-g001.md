caption: Signaling pathway involving interleukin 1 associated receptor kinase 4 (IRAK4).
  IRAK-4 is a serine, threonine kinase that is a key intracellular signaling node
  downstream of myddosome-associated toll-like receptors (TLRs), which is depicted
  as myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and the IL-1 family receptors
  (IL-1R, IL-18R and IL-33R). Activation of the IRAK4 pathway triggers an inflammatory
  chemokine and cytokine cascade that is important in innate immunity. This is mediated
  through the recruitment and activation of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptor associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6). The TRAF6 adaptor protein is able to interact and induce the translocation
  of transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) to the nucleus, resulting
  in transcriptional activation of genes encoding cytokines and chemokines. Additionally,
  TRAF6 can induce a pathway through mitogen-activation protein kinases (MAPK) that
  leads to activator protein 1 (AP-1)- induced gene expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. In addition, ssRNA fragments from SARS-CoV-2 virus can activate the IRAK4
  pathway as shown via TLR7 and TLR8, which are membrane bound on an endosome, as
  shown. As shown, an IRAK-4 inhibitor will inhibit this inflammatory chemokine and
  cytokine cascade. This pathway can be activated by other cytokines or by the recognition
  of TLRs with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on viruses, bacteria
  (e.g. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gram negative bacteria and TLR4), and other foreign
  molecules.
