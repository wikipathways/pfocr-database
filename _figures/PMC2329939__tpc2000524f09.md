caption: Catharanthus Leaf Epidermal Cells Express the MIA, MVA/Triterpene, VLFA,
  and Flavonoid Biosynthetic Pathways.The EST sequencing analysis described in this
  study suggests that the complete MVA/triterpene pathway is expressed in leaf epidermal
  cells and that the triterpenes being produced are exported outside the cell into
  the surface of the leaves. Similarly the entire pathway for VLFA biosynthesis is
  also expressed in this cell type and is exported to produce the surface wax layer
  of Catharanthus leaves. Flavonoid biosynthesis also appears within these same epidermal
  cells where flavonoid products accumulate within epidermal cell vacuoles as suggested
  by . The model also proposes that most of the vindoline pathway up to and including
  16-methoxytabersonine is expressed in the leaf epidermis and an undetermined intermediate
  is then transported to adjacent mesophyll cells, specialized idioblasts, and/or
  laticifers, for final elaboration into vindoline. To permit this complex transport,
  strict control mechanisms appear to be operating and these have yet to be characterized.
  In contrast with leaf epidermal cells that are enriched in the MVA pathway that
  supplies IPP for the biosynthesis of triterpenes, there is strong evidence that
  the IPAP cells preferentially express the MEP pathway and G10H. This raises questions
  about the roles played by these two cell types in supplying the necessary IPP for
  the biosynthesis of secologanin within the leaf epidermis.
