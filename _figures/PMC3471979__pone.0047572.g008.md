caption: PDGF-CC-mediated engagement of the PDGF receptor stimulates the PLC/PI3R
  pathway, which in turn, activates TRPC channels resulting in elevation of [Ca2+]
  transient. The elevation of [Ca2+] is required for PDGF induced PI3K/Akt pathway
  leading to inactivation of GSK3β signal. The inactivated GSK3β fails to induce the
  degradation of β-catenin resulting in accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm,
  followed by its translocation into nucleus and subsequent induction of expression
  of genes associated with the cell survival.
