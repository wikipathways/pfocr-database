caption: cAMP signaling in the mitochondrial matrix. The intra-mitochondrial cAMP-PKA
  pathway has been proposed to fine-tune metabolism by directly regulating the TCA
  cycle and respiration. sACs have been found in the mitochondrial matrix and produce
  cAMP locally in response to the CO2/HCO3− generated by the TCA cycle. The matrix
  cAMP-PKA cascades are then activated, leading to the phosphorylation of ETC proteins
  such as Complex I and Complex IV subunits, modulating the OXPHOS and ATP production.
  In addition, PKA phosphorylation of the ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) abolishes
  its ability to bind to and inhibit Complex V. The sACs can also be activated by
  mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+. Active mechanisms for transporting cAMP into the matrix
  remain to be identified. To coordinate the OXPHOS and energy needs, the cAMP-PKA
  pathways outside mitochondria can activate the nuclear CREBs and the downstream
  transcription factors (PGC-1α, NRF) to promote TFAM (mtTFA) production, mtDNA replication
  and eventually mitochondrial biogenesis. On the other hand, the matrix cAMP signaling
  could exert a negative regulation on this process by increasing the PKA phosphorylation-dependent
  degradation of TFAM
