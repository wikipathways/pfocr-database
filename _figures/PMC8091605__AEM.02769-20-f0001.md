caption: Hybrid pathway of nicotine oxidative degradation by A. tumefaciens S33 (A)
  and the arrangement of the pno and rid-NC genes in the genome of A. tumefaciens
  S33 (B). NdhAB, nicotine dehydrogenase; Hno, 6-hydroxynicotine oxidase; Pno, 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine
  dehydrogenase; Ald, predicted aldehyde dehydrogenase; Hsh, 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine
  hydroxylase. mfs, predicted major facilitator superfamily transporter gene; paz,
  pseudoazurin gene; tetR, predicted TetR family transcriptional regulator gene; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid. Green arrows, genes encoding key enzymes in the nicotine degradation
  pathway characterized in this study; red arrows, genes encoding enzymes characterized
  previously; purple arrow, predicted gene encoding key enzyme for nicotine degradation;
  blue arrows, predicted transporter and regulatory genes; gray arrows, genes with
  unknown function.
