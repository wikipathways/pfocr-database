caption: Scheme of the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis pathway. Biosynthesis of the
  molybdenum cofactor (Moco) involves the stepwise conversion of guanosine triphosphate
  (GTP) to cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP [,,], step 1) which is converted
  to molybdopterin (MPT, [,,]) in the following pathway step 2. In the third step,
  MPT is initially adenylated yielding adenylated MPT (MPT-AMP, [,]), which is subsequently
  converted to Moco [,] in the fourth pathway step.
