caption: Endocytosis and activation of the Notch (N) pathway. The precleaved transmembrane
  receptor Notch binds to its transmembrane ligand Delta (Dl, blue) on the adjacent
  cell (1). Conformation of the membrane proximal region of the Notch extracellular
  domain (Necd, red) prevents cleavage at the S2 site by the metalloprotease ADAM10.
  In the ligand-presenting cell, Dl is ubiquitinated by the E3 ligases Neuralized
  (Neu) or Mind bomb (Mib, green). This step can be competitively inhibited by members
  of the Bearded protein family that mimic the Dl intracellular domain (3). Ubiquitination
  drives Dl internalization and trans-endocytosis of Necd (4), which unmasks the S2
  cleavage site (5). This facilitates internalization to endosomes (6) in which cleavage
  at the S3 site by Presenilin (Psn) and thus release of Nintra occurs (7). Nintra
  can then enter the nucleus to direct target gene expression (8). Ligand-independent
  activation occurs by trafficking of Notch to the endosomal or lysosomal limiting
  membrane in the secreting cell (9). Proetolytic degradation of Necd (10) again facilitates
  S3 cleavage (11) and nuclear translocation of Nintra.
