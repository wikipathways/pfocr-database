caption: 'Seven transgenic approaches to Fe biofortification of rice. The pathway
  inside the gray dashed-line rectangle shows the biosynthetic pathway for mugineic
  acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) in graminaceous plants. SAMS, S-Adenosyl-methionine
  synthase; NAS, NA synthase; NAAT, NA aminotransferase; DMA, 2′-deoxymugineic acid;
  DMAS, DMA synthase; IDS3, MA synthase (dioxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation
  of DMA and epiHDMA at the 2′ position); Ferritin, iron storage protein; OsYSL2,
  Fe(II)-NA and Mn(II)-NA transporter; OsIRO2, Fe deficiency-inducible bHLH transcription
  factor related to Fe homeostasis in rice; OsIRT1, ferric transporter; OsYSL15, Fe(III)-DMA
  transporter; TOM1, MA transporter. Rice lacks the two dioxygenase genes (IDS2 and
  IDS3) and secretes only DMA. Approach 1: Enhancing Fe accumulation in seeds by introducing
  the Fe storage protein, ferritin gene, SoyferH1, SoyferH2 or Pvferritin, under the
  control of endosperm-specific promoters. Approach 2: Enhancing Fe transport within
  the plant body by the overexpression of NAS. Approach 3: Enhancing Fe influx to
  seeds by expression of the Fe(II)-NA transporter gene OsYSL2 under the control of
  the OsSUT1 promoter. Approach 4: Enhancing Fe uptake and translocation by introduction
  of the phytosiderophore synthase gene IDS3. Approach 5: Enhanced Fe uptake from
  soil by overexpression of the Fe transporter gene OsIRT1 or OsYSL15. Approach 6:
  Enhanced Fe uptake and translocation by overexpression of the OsIRO2 gene. Approach
  7: Enhanced Fe translocation from flag leaves to seeds by knockdown of the vacuolar
  Fe transporter gene OsVIT1 or OsVIT2. The ferritin image was kindly provided by
  Dr. David S. Goodsell (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA) and the RCSB
  PDB.'
