caption: Dynamics in the RTK-Ras-ERK signaling network. (A) Subset of total PPI network
  with a SAINT-based probability of dynamic interaction >0.8 by comparing baseline
  to insulin condition. (B) Subset of PPI network with dynamic interactions under
  EGF stimulus. In both (A) and (B), orange lines indicate protein association; blue
  lines denote dissociation. (C) “Core” network of PPIs that were identified in all
  three RNAi screen sets. Edge thickness denotes SAINT score, a measure of interaction
  confidence. Red edges denote those found both in our study and in MasterNet, a literature-based
  compilation of previously known PPIs. Edge thickness represents SAINT score. Circles
  represent prey; rectangles represent baits. The size of the node correlates with
  the number of RNAi screens from which the proteins were isolated. See  for details
  of all node and edge parameters and names of the proteins identified as pathway
  interactors.
