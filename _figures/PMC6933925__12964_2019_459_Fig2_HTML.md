caption: Possible rational combination treatments for HH/GLI-associated cancers simultaneously
  targeting HH/GLI and HH-regulated immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting signals.
  The efficacy, response rate and durability of the therapeutic effect of HH/GLI pathway
  inhibition is likely to increase upon combination of approved HH/SMO antagonists
  with small molecules and/or biologics such as neutralizing or blocking antibodies
  developed for the selective inhibition of immune suppression and tumor-promoting
  inflammation
