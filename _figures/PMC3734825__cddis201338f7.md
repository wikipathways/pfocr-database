caption: The upregulation of HSP70 and the phosphorylation of STAT1 induced by bortezomib
  (BTZ) decrease the cytotoxic activity against ovarian cancer cells. BTZ increased
  HSF-1 and transcriptionally upregulated HSP70, which subsequently induced STAT1
  phosphorylation. Moreover, BTZ can induce the phosphorylation of STAT1 through the
  JAK signaling pathway. Notably, cisplatin and JAKi I significantly inhibited STAT1
  phosphorylation and enhanced cytotoxicity in BTZ-treated cells. These results suggest
  the possibility to abolish or reduce BTZ chemoresistance in ovarian cancer by the
  addition of cisplatin or JAKi's
