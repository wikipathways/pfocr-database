caption: Possible mechanism underlying the difference in the efficacy of chemotherapy
  and immunotherapy in cancer patients with different TR-DDR scores. (A) The high-TR-DDR
  tumor microenvironment (TME) improves therapeutic effect through enhancing antitumor
  immunity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells), DCs, and
  M1-like macrophages, while low-TR-DDR tumor microenvironment has stronger ability
  of invasion and metastasis with an increasing number of Monocytes and M2-like macrophages.
  In high-TR-DDR tumors, CD8+ T cells exert cytotoxic effects through secreting TNF,
  perforin, and granzymes, and CD4+ T cells further activate other immune cells by
  secreting IL-1, IL-6, IFN-γ, and other cytokines, in which IL-1 and IL-6 play important
  roles to polarize macrophages toward M1 type with antitumor functions. Additionally,
  DCs promote tumor immunity through antigen processing and presentation. In contrast,
  VEGF-rich TME for low-TR-DDR tumors promotes M2 polarization of macrophages, which
  inhibits T cell (CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells) and antigen-presenting cells (DCs)
  function. In addition, recruitment and activation of Monocytes also could facilitate
  tumorigenesis by promoting immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor cell intravasation
  into the vasculature. (B) COL2A1, MAGEA4, FCRL4, and ZIC1 possibly play roles in
  DDR function and immune microenvironment. COL2A1 and ZIC1 could suppress cancer
  metastasis by regulating cell signaling pathways and the Wnt signaling pathway respectively.
  MAGEA4 exerts function in the TLS pathway, promoting genomic instability and tumor
  immunity. FCRL4+ B cell is capable of aborting B cell receptor-mediating signaling
  and proliferation, and producing TNF. The deep investigations of mechanisms of these
  DEGs at molecular levels have not been reported.
