caption: Proposed model for the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MEK4) regulation
  of human prostate cell motility and for its inhibition by genistein. Left) High
  motility phenotype. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) activates MEK4. Activated
  MEK4 in turn activates downstream effector proteins, including p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) (), MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2) (), and heat
  shock protein 27 (HSP27) (), all of which act to increase expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2
  (MMP-2) and cell invasion. Smad3 can be activated by p38 MAPK () or by the TGFβ
  superfamily receptors, activin-like kinase receptor (ALK)-5 and type II TGFβ receptor
  (TGFβRII) (). The proinvasive action of Smad3 is mitigated by the anti-invasion
  action of Smad1 (). Smad1 is constitutively activated by endoglin (ENG) in an ALK-2–dependent
  fashion (). Under the combined influence of proinvasion MEK4 and Smad3 signaling
  and of anti-invasion Smad1 signaling, cells have a high-motility phenotype characterized
  by high invasion and metastatic potential (), which in turn causes mortality from
  prostate cancer. Right) Genistein treatment and low-motility phenotype. When genistein
  is present, it binds to and inhibits MEK4 kinase activity. Genistein-mediated decreases
  in MEK4 kinase activity in turn blocks activation of p38 MAPK (), MAPKAPK2 (), and
  HSP27 (), all of which of block TGFβ-mediated increases in MMP-2 and cell invasion.
  In addition, genistein activates the antimotility action of Smad1, in a manner that
  is dependent on ALK-2 kinase activity (). Genistein's action serves to inhibit proinvasion
  MEK4 and Smad3 signaling and to enhance anti-invasion Smad1 signaling, resulting
  in cells with a low-motility phenotype characterized by low invasion and metastatic
  potential (), which in turn decreases mortality from prostate cancer (,). − = inhibitory
