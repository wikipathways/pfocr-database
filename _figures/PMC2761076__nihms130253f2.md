caption: 'The ontology features a concept for drugs or small chemical molecules and
  another for drug synthesis and formulation. Further, a drug is known to target a
  specific molecule: protein, RNA, or DNA. A drug’s target is biologically active
  in the context of a pathway, cellular component, cell, and tissue. The drug is typically
  tested using an animal model for a specific human phenotype, usually a disease.
  A patient or human with the disease phenotype has a set of symptoms/signs, some
  of which can be unrelated to the disease. Drugs treat patients, but can cause adverse
  reactions. Finally, we link the patient’s drug response to the genetic variation
  in her genome and environmental factors encountered. These concepts are linked with
  directed or undirected relations, such as encodes (DNA encodes RNA), interacts with
  (drug-drug interactions), is part of (a cell is part of a tissue), affects (environmental
  factor affects genetic variation), and several others. We illustrate our ontology
  with the drug amantadine, which acts as a prophylactic agent against several RNA
  virus-induced influenzas that afflict the respiratory system and result in coughing
  and sneezing. Amantadine can cause a skin rash as a side effect.'
