caption: 'Transsynaptic regulation of endocannabinoid signaling by β-neurexins and
  its implications in synaptic plasticity and diseases. (A) Regulation of excitatory
  synaptic strength by β-neurexins via endocannabinoid system. Anderson et al. demonstrated
  that presynaptic β-neurexins regulate endocannabinoid signaling by controlling postsynaptic
  endocannabinoid 2-AG synthesis. When β –neurexins are removed, 2-AG synthesis is
  disinhibited, presynaptic CB1Rs are activated, and synaptic strength is decreased
  (Anderson et al., ). In addition, the AC-PKA dependent LTP in burst-firing neurons
  is blocked, which may account for the impaired contextual memory in hippocampal
  CA1 β-neurexin knockout mice. β-neurexins act as a brake on endocannabinoid signaling
  possibly via transsynaptic interaction with postsynaptic neuroligin isoforms that
  exclusively bind to β-neurexins, but not a-neurexins (Anderson et al., ). β-neurexins
  might downregulate tonic endocannabinoid signaling through mGluR1/5 or M1/M3 receptors
  since activation of those GPCRs is known to trigger 2-AG production via PLC pathway
  (Varma et al., ; Chevaleyre et al., ; Heifets and Castillo, ; Kano et al., ; Castillo
  et al., ; Rinaldo and Hansel, ; Martin et al., ). This regulation might also involve
  VGCCs, NMDARs, or AMPARs as Ca2+ influx through these channels could facilitate
  PLC-DAGL mediated 2-AG production (Ohno-Shosaku et al., ; Castillo et al., ). The
  exact postsynaptic partners of β-neurexins in this process await to be identified.
  (B) The regulation of endocannabinoid signaling by β-neurexins supports neurexins/neuroligins-endocannabinoid
  signaling as a common pathomechanism in cognitive disorders (Krueger and Brose,
  ; Anderson et al., ). Abnormalities in this signaling pathway could disrupt synapses
  and neural circuits, and contribute to neurological and psychiatric diseases (Chubykin
