caption: Proposed model of signaling pathways activated in primary NHP microglia in
  response to B. burgdorferi. Upon contact with the bacterium, the microglial TLR2
  and TLR5, respectively, sense B. burgdorferi lipoproteins and flagella (likely exposed
  by fragmented or by phagocytosed bacteria), initiating downstream responses by recruitment
  of adaptor molecules such as MyD88. Whether signaling is initiated both at the surface
  and in the intracellular compartments or exclusively through the latter is not clear,
  neither is the mechanism of TLR2/5 internalization. However, once signaling is initiated,
  further downstream signaling leads to activation of MAPK pathways, mainly the ERK
  pathway, leading to production of inflammatory mediators. Upregulation of TLR4 has
  been detected by confocal microscopy, perhaps through a lipooligosaccharide moiety
  or as a result of concomitant activation along with other TLRs. Its role in inflammation
  is unclear and neither is its intracellular localization (hence the question mark
  in the corresponding arrow). Signaling through intracellular NOD2, mediated by MDP
  molecules in phagocytosed bacteria, leads to anti-inflammatory effects, especially
  for CCL2 and perhaps other mediators. Thus, the overall inflammatory outcome in
  microglia in response to B. burgdorferi is likely through the positive and negative
  regulation of several key signaling pathways. Thickness of the downstream signaling
  lines depicts signal strength. Arrowheads indicate induction, and horizontal bars
  at the end of the lines indicate inhibition. Dashed lines show additional possible
  inhibitory signals. Dotted lines indicate internalization either through phagocytosis
  or endocytosis, with phagosome and/or endosome in open ovals. Dashed and dotted
  lines indicate unclear processes. CCL2, chemokine (C-C) motif ligand 2; CXCL8, chemokine
  (C-X-C) motif ligand 8; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IL-6, interleukin
  6; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; MDP, muramyl dipeptide; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88; NOD2, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing
  2; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRIF, Toll/interleukin-1
  receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β.
