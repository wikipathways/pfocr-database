caption: Innate Immune signaling Pathways in SAR-CoV infection and Immune Evasion.
  Upon CoV infection, incoming double-stranded RNA(dsRNA) and genomic single-stranded
  RNA (ssRNA) are recognized by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR7, respectively.
  The downstream signaling of these TLRs induces activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  to produce proinflammatory cytokines and phosphorylation of interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 to drive type I interferon. NF-κB activation-induced COX-2
  production, which in term induced fever and then triggers the response of heat shock
  factor 1 (HSF-1). The inhibitory of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation damage by heat
  shock protein (HSP70, 90) is via suppressing activation of NF-κB pathway in the
  cytosol NLRP3 inflammasome and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the
  nucleus.
