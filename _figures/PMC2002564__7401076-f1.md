caption: Model of arterial–venous specification in the developing embryo. Sonic hedgehog
  (Shh) secreted by the notochord and floor plate induces vascular endothelial growth
  factor (Vegf) levels in the somites, which in turn activate angioblasts arising
  from the lateral plate mesoderm. Within an arterial-fated angioblast, Vegf interacts
  with the Vegf receptor 2 (Vegfr2)–neuropilin 1 (NP-1) complex to activate downstream
  phospholipase Cγ-1 (Plc-γ)–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and Notch
  signalling pathways, thereby inducing arterial marker expression, such as ephrin
  B2 (efnb2). Forkhead box c 1 (Foxc1)/Foxc2 proteins activate the Notch pathway by
  inducing the expression of Delta-like 4 (Dll4), thereby leading to an arterial fate.
  Conversely, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII)
  and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)–Akt signalling promote venous fate by suppression
  of the Notch pathway and Erk signalling, respectively, thereby repressing arterial
  fate. COUP-TFII not only suppresses the Notch pathway, but also inhibits NP-1 expression,
  therefore attenuating Vegf and downstream Notch activation. Unconfirmed interactions
  are indicated by question marks. This figure was adapted from a model presented
  by . Ephb4, B4 ephrin receptor; grl, gridlock; Hey, hairy-and-enhancer-of-split
  related; Mek, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; Pkc, protein kinase c.
