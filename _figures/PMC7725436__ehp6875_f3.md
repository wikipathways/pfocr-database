caption: '(A) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes. Female rats were treated
  as follows from gestation day 6 until postnatal day (PND) 365. CTL: vehicle only;
  BPA2.5:  BW/d bisphenol A; BPA25:  BW/d BPA; BPA250:  BW/d BPA; BPA2500:  BW/d BPA;
  BPA25000:  BW/d BPA. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted on uterus samples at
  estrus stage using RNA-Seq. Significantly differentially expressed genes () are
  shown in the Venn diagram. (B) Upstream regulator prediction with Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis for a subset of differentially expressed genes that overlapped only between
  BPA(25) and BPA(250) groups. Dotted arrows represent indirect interactions; solid
  arrows represent direct interactions. Note: BW, body weight; FDR, false discovery
  rate.'
