caption: Model of the Impact of the CMT2B-causing RAB7 mutant protein on the endocytic
  pathway. In CMT2B the presence of RAB7V162M causes an increase of late endosomal
  proteins and enzymes as well as of lysosomal activity. This, in turn, activates
  a feedback control mechanism demonstrated by the decrease of ESCRT proteins. Because
  of the presence of the RAB7 mutant, CMT2B cells fail to respond to this regulatory
  mechanism, showing higher lysosomal activity
