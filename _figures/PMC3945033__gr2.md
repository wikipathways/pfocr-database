caption: Computational simulation of eicosanoid profile in ATP-stimulated BMDM (for
  dataset A). (A) Simplified COX (left side) and LOX (right side) pathway maps are
  shown. (Rectangles) Enzymes; (ellipses) lipid metabolites. (Shaded) Unmeasured metabolites.
  (Arrows) Enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions. (∅) Additional metabolic pathways
  including degradation. The simulation results for COX (B) and LOX (C) metabolites
  are shown. The experimental data (Exp) for ATP-treated (Trt) and control (Ctrl)
  represent mean ± SE (n = 3). The simulation results (Fit) are shown (solid and shaded
  curves, respectively) for Trt and Ctrl.
