caption: Scheme of plant isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways. The MEP pathway is localized
  to the plastid; the MVA pathway is referred to as cytosolic and is localized partially
  in the ER compartment. We note that the mitochondrial branch of isoprenoid biosynthesis
  is not illustrated in the figure. GlyAld-3P, Glyceraldehyde-3-P; DXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-P.
