caption: a Interactions between the 27 recognized proteins that were associated with
  BCC (DOID:2513) and the prioritized proteins (ASIP, CTSS, and TNFRSF10B). b Interactions
  between the 12 recognized proteins that were associated with MM (DOID:8923) and
  the prioritized proteins (ASIP, KDELC2 [also known as POGLUT3], and CAPN1). Red
  and blue circles represent involvement in melanogenesis and apoptosis, respectively.
  Green circles represent involvement in (a) the p53 signaling pathway and (b) cellular
  senescence
