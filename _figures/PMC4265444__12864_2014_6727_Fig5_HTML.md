caption: The sulfur assimilation pathway and the genes encoding the enzymes of the
  different biosynthetic steps. The genes in red and green represent up-regulation
  and down-regulation in strain P5 at low temperature, respectively. Underlined genes
  mean identical regulation in P24. Heat map shows the expression of the genes of
  this pathway that were differentially expressed in both strains.

  wine strains reveals a novel role of the sulfur assimilation pathway in adaptation
  at low temperature fermentations.
