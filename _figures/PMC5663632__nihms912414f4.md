caption: Schematic representation of pathways involved in the control of insulin secretion
  and possible involvement of TRPM5. a During low levels of glucose (<5 mM), few glucose
  molecules are metabolized. This results in a low ATP/ADP ratio within the pancreatic
  β-cell. The (KATP) channel is active and transports K+ ions out of the cell contributing
  to the resting membrane potential causing VDCCs to remain closed and insulin-filled
  vesicles to pause within the cytoplasm beneath the outer cell membrane. b At elevated
  glucose levels (>5 mM), the glucose uptake increases and consequently leads to enhanced
  ATP production. The resulting high ATP/ADP ratio within the cell closes the (KATP)
  channel, and the membrane potential is shifted to the K+ equilibrium potential.
  This depolarization needs further amplification, e.g., via activation of TRPM5 resulting
  in Na+-influx (arrow 1), to reach the VDCC activation potential of around 0 mV with
  a consequential influx of Ca2+ ions that trigger insulin secretion (triggering pathway).
  The processing of glucose does not only lead to ATP production that closes (KATP)
  channels but also results in production of cADPR and NAADP that both can stimulate
  the release of stored Ca2+ from intracellular stores and thus are able to activate
  TRPM5. Thus, TRPM5 could also be part of the metabolic amplifying pathway of glucose-induced
  insulin secretion (arrow 2). Besides a possible function in the described triggering
  and/or amplifying pathway, the presented indispensability of TRPM5 for proper insulin
  secretion even with VDCC activation by arginine stimulation could also go along
  with a role of TRPM5 in the direct secretion process, e.g., as part of the process
  of vesicle–membrane fusion (arrow 3)
