caption: Ceramide is central to sphingolipid metabolism and can be generated de novo
  (blue), through hydrolysis of complex sphingolipids (yellow) or via the salvage
  pathway (red). In the de novo pathway, serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes
  the first reaction resulting in 3-ketosphinganine, which is reduced to dihydrosphingosine
  (dhSph), further metabolized to dihydroceramide (dhCer) by ceramide synthases (CerSs),
  and desaturated by dihydroceramide desaturase (DES) to generate ceramide. Ceramide
  is used as a building block for complex sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin, glycosphingolipids,
  and gangliosides. These complex sphingolipids can be hydrolyzed to regenerate ceramide.
  Ceramide is hydrolyzed by ceramidases (CD) to generate sphingosine, which serves
  as substrates for CerSs or SK1 to regenerate ceramide via the salvage pathway or
  to generate sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Further hydrolysis of S1P by S1P lyase
  represents the exit from sphingolipid metabolism. This schematic is focused on the
  enzymes discussed in the text and does not include all enzymes involved in sphingolipid
  metabolism.
