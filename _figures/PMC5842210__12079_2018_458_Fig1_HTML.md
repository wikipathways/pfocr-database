caption: Pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications, reflecting where CCN proteins
  may take part. An overview of a schematic linear pathway by which obesity may lead
  to diabetes mellitus, and subsequently, diabetes complications. The article refers
  sequentially to this figure and the potential role of CCNs at each step of the disease
  pathway. The CCNs currently implicated in affecting this pathogenesis and being
  dysregulated at various points, are indicated at the right of the figure; explanatory
  detail addressing promotion or protection by the respective CCN, is provided in
  the article text
