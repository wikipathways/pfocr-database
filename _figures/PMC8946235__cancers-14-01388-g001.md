caption: 'Different mechanisms for DNA damage response and main inhibitors. DNA damage
  is classified into different categories on the basis of the DNA damage type: single-strand
  breaks (SSBs), double-strand breaks (DSBs), base alterations, and crosslinks. DNA
  damage activates the DNA damage response pathway (DDR) that is composed of several
  downstream signaling pathways based on the DNA damage type. The MMR and BER pathways
  are activated by crosslinks, base alterations, and SSBs, the NER pathway is activated
  by by SSBs, and the NHEJ and HRR pathways are activated by DSBs. We also represented
  the main drugs and their inhibitor sites that are currently under investigation
  as new possible treatments in colorectal cancer (CRC). MMR, mismatch repair; BER,
  base excision repair; NER, nucleotide excision repair; NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining;
  HRR, homologous recombination repair; PARPi, PARP inhibitors.'
