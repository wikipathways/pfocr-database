caption: The synthesis pathway of SCFAs. Acetate, propionate and butyrate are main
  SCFAs produced by dietary fibers of microbial fermentation in gut. Production of
  acetate involves in pyruvate by Acetyl-CoA and Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Butyrate
  is synthesized from Acetyl CoA that is subsequently reduced to Butyryl-CoA, which
  can be converted to butyrate by so-called classical pathway via Butyryl-phosphate.
  Propionate can be formed from succinate that is converted to methylmalonyl-CoA by
  succinate pathway. Furthermore, as a precursor lactate also participate the synthesis
  of propionate by acrylate pathway.
