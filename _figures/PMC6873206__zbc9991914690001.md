caption: Overview of YAP regulation by mechanical stimuli. Changes in the mechanical
  environment of the cell can control YAP activity through multiple Hippo-dependent
  and -independent mechanisms. The Hippo pathway acts to inhibit YAP nuclear localization.
  Several upstream Hippo pathway kinases like MST1/2, MAP4K-family, and TAO phosphorylate
  LATS1/2 in the presence of its activator, MOB1. The active, phosphorylated form
  of LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP, retaining it in the cytoplasm, thereby resulting
  in YAP inhibition. Tension sensed at focal adhesions, adherens junctions, and the
  nuclear envelope, as well as changes in F-actin levels in the cytoplasm and the
  nucleus, control YAP activity through both Hippo-dependent and -independent pathways.
  F-actin levels can be influenced by the mechanical environment through tension sensing
  at the adherens junctions, focal adhesions, and nucleus. In turn, F-actin can affect
  tension experienced by the cell at each of these structures. In sum, increases in
  F-actin and tension inhibit Hippo signaling and promote YAP activity.
