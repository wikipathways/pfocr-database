caption: Imbalance of T cells in asthma pathogenesis. In response to allergens, the
  naïve T (Tn) cells are activated by the macrophages and tend to differentiate into
  T helper (Th) 1, Th2, Th17, Th22, Th9, Th25, T regulatory (Treg), T follicular helper
  (Tfh), natural killer T (NKT), mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT), γδT cells,
  cytotoxic CD8+T lymphocytes (CTLs), and memory T (Tm) cells. They secrete cytokines
  to activate and recruit the eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, and B cells. The
  arrows represent the secretions from these cells, affecting the progression of asthma.
  The transcriptional factors T-bet, Gata3, RAR-related orphan receptor (ROR) γt,
  Foxp3, and PU.1 are necessary to Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, Th22, and Th9 cell activation.
  The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signals are involved
  in the process. Besides, caspase 8 and the Fas/FasL pathway are related to cell
  apoptosis mediated by CTLs.
