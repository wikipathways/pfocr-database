caption: Innate immune signalling at the mitochondria. On induction of mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), NLRP3 localizes to the mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic
  reticulum membrane (MAM) with ASC and pro-caspase 1, inducing caspase-1 activation
  and the production of IL-1β and IL-18. MAVS is located on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane and mediates antiviral signalling. On TLR1/2/4 stimulation, TRAF6 translocates
  to the mitochondria and interacts with ECSIT, contributing to ROS production. NLRX1
  is internalized into the mitochondrial matrix where it interacts with UQCRC2, a
  protein of the complex III of the electron transfer chain, potentiating ROS production.
  IRGM binds to the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin, influencing autophagy, mitochondrial
  fission, mitochondrial ΔΨm and cell death. ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like
  protein containing a CARD; ECSIT, evolutionarily conserved signalling intermediate
  in Toll pathway; IL, interleukin; IRGM, immunity-related GTPase family M protein;
  LRR, leucine-rich repeat; MAVS, mitochondria-associated viral sensor; NAD, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; NLRP, NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing; NLRX,
  NOD-like receptor family member X; PYD, pyrin domain; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRAF,
  TNF-receptor-associated factor.
