caption: Mitochondria and metabolism remodeling upon pluripotent stem cell differentiation
  and reprogramming. Pluripotent stem cells display globular immature mitochondria,
  localized perinuclearly, characterized by an electron-lucid matrix and poorly developed
  cristae. Energy production in pluripotent stem cells is mainly generated by a high
  glycolysis rate, leading to increased lactate production, whereas oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) activity is limited, leading to reduced oxygen consumption and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production. Although substrate entry into the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle is limited, intermediates of glycolysis enter the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) and serve as substrates for the nucleotide synthesis required to sustain
  self-renewal. In differentiated cells, a more developed mitochondrial network, characterized
  by a more electron-dense matrix and developed cristae, ensures ATP production through
  increased OXPHOS activity. This results in elevated oxygen consumption and ROS production
  and reduced production of lactate through glycolysis. Interestingly, inhibiting
  OXPHOS or stimulating glycolysis impedes stem cell differentiation while favoring
  reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In contrast, stimulating
  mitochondrial biogenesis favors cell differentiation, whereas inhibiting glycolysis
  impairs reprogramming. Color images available online at www.liebertpub.com/scd
