caption: The insulin-like growth factor-1-phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase-protein kinase-B
  serine/threonine kinase-forkhead box-O pathway. (a) Increased insulin-like growth
  factor-1 (IGF-1) activates phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), leading to phosphorylation
  of protein kinase-B serine/threonine kinase (Akt) and forkhead box-O (Foxo). Phosphorylated
  Foxo is sequestered within the cytoplasm and prevents its nuclear translocation
  and atrogin-1 (muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbox)) activation. Phosphorylated Akt also
  activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70Sk, resulting in increased
  protein synthesis. (b) Suppression of IGF-1 with controlled mechanical ventilation-induced
  diaphragm muscle inactivity deactivates Akt, leading to nuclear translocation of
  Foxo, which then activates atrogin-1 and other atrogenes resulting in increased
  proteolysis. Reprinted from Cell, 117, Sandri M, Sandri C, Gilbert A, Skurk C, Calabria
