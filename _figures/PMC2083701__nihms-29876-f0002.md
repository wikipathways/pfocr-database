caption: 'The cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops, including the direct and indirect
  pathways of the basal ganglia. The cells of the striatum are divided into two sub-classes
  based on differences in biochemistry and efferent projections. The “Go” cells project
  directly to the GPi/SNr, and their activity disinhibits the thalamus, thereby facilitating
  the execution of a cortical response. The “NoGo” cells are part of the indirect
  pathway to the GPi/SNr, and have an opposing effect, suppressing actions from getting
  executed. Dopamine from the SNc projects to the dorsal striatum, differentially
  modulating activity in the direct and indirect pathways by activating different
  receptors: The Go cells express the D1 receptor, and the NoGo cells express the
  D2 receptor. The orbitofrontal cortex is thought to maintain reinforcement-related
  information in working memory and provide top-down biasing on the more primitive
  BG system, in addition to direct influencing of response selection processes in
  premotor cortex. The OFC receives information about relative magnitude of reinforcement
  values from the ABL, which it can also maintain in working memory. Dopamine from
  the VTA projects to ventral striatum (not shown) and orbitofrontal cortex. GPi:
  internal segment of globus pallidus; GPe: external segment of globus pallidus; SNc:
  substantia nigra pars compacta; SNr: substantia nigra pars reticulata; VTA: ventral
  tegmental area; ABL: basolateral amygdala.'
