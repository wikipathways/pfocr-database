caption: Signaling pathways associated with mesothelin. Through interactions with
  soluble or cell surface mesothelin, mesothelin can trigger Akt, ERK1/2, and JNK
  signaling pathways. Downstream effects of Akt and ERK1/2 signaling include inhibition
  of Bim, Bad, and Bax, which then inhibits apoptosis and/or stimulate Bcl-xl/Bcl-2
  leading to cell survival. The Akt, ERK1/2, and JNK pathways are shown to increase
  expression of matrix metalloprotease 7 (MMP-7), which leads to increased rates of
  cellular migration and invasion. MMP-7 pathway can also be triggered through SGK3/FOXO3
  and p38 pathways. SGK3/FOXO3 signaling has also been shown to cause the downregulation
  and expression of DKK1, thus increasing cell migration. In general, overexpression
  of mesothelin also causes p38 signaling activation, as well as NF-kB and STAT3 signaling.
  NF-kB downstream effect increases expression of IL-6 and contributes to cell survival
  and proliferation, while STAT3 signaling has been indicated in Cyclin E/CDK2 complex
  formation, pushing the cell through the cell cycle, and increasing cell proliferation.
