caption: Role of PAK signaling in response to inflammation, altered microbiota and
  hyperglycemia. Image is read from left to right. (Far left) Binding of a Wnt ligand
  to the Frizzled receptor disrupts the multi-subunit destruction complex consisting
  of Axin, Dvl, GSK3beta, and APC, which normally tags Beta-catenin to the proteasome.
  Here, beta-catenin is no longer degraded but moves to the nucleus where it binds
  to TCF/LEF and initiates transcription of target genes involved in cell cycle progression,
  proliferation and survival. (Low left) Ligand binding to PPARγ results in its activation
  and nuclear translocation where it then binds RXR and induces its own transcription
  as well as genes involved in glucose homeostasis and lipid transport. PPARγ directly
  inhibits Beta-catenin and the NF-κB subunit RelA. (Central) Inflammatory cytokines
  like TNFalpha or microbial products such as EspG or lipopolysaccharides (LPS), result
  in PAK1 activation. PAK1 phosphorylates Beta-catenin and leads to its stabilization
  and full transcriptional activation. PAK1 phosphorylates JNK and activates the IKK
  complex which disrupts RelA from IkB and leading to transcription of genes involved
  in inflammation and survival. Hyperglycemia results in insulin stimulation of RTKs
  which further activate PAK1 or directly contribute to a PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. PAK1
  may also directly contribute to activation of PI3K or mTOR or vice versa. Note that
  activation of the mTOR1-Raptor complex leads to transcription of PPARγ. As PPARγ
  levels increase they fulfill their role in the nucleus and cytoplasm. RAS is a key
  component of the MAPK and PI3K pathway. MAPK-ERK signaling results in activation
  of JUN and FOS (nucleus) and inhibits PPARγ (cytoplasm). (Far right) RAC1/CDC42
  are small Rho-GTPases, which also lead to PAK1 activation. PAK1 stimulates the MAPK-ERK
  cascade and also inhibits PPARγ.
