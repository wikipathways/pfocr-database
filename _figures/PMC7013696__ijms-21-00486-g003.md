caption: 'Mapping on metabolic pathways of differentially changed proteins identified
  from soybean seedling irradiated without (control) or with millimeter waves (treated)
  under flooded or unflooded conditions. (A) Mapping from unirradiated soybean under
  unflooded conditions. (B) Mapping from irradiated soybean under unflooded conditions.
  (C) Mapping from unirradiated soybean under flooding. (D) Mapping from irradiated
  soybean under flooding. Changed proteins were submitted to the MapMan software and
  mapped to metabolic pathways. Each square indicates one mapped protein. Color indicates
  the fold change value of a differentially changed protein. Red and blue colors indicate
  an increase and decrease in fold change values, respectively. Abbreviations: CHO,
  carbohydrate metabolism; MitoETC, mitochondrial electron transport chain; misc,
  miscellaneous; OPP, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid
  cycle.'
