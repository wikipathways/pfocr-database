caption: Postsqualene cholesterol synthetic pathway. This figure depicts the postsqualene
  cholesterol synthetic pathway. Lanosterol is the first sterol formed after cyclization
  of squalene. Lanosterol is converted to cholesterol in a series of enzymatic reactions.
  Two major synthetic pathways exist, primarily distinguished by the timing of the
  reduction of the Δ24-bond in the aliphatic side chain by sterol Δ24-reductase. If
  reduction of the Δ24-bond occurs early, cholesterol is synthesized via the Kandutsch-Russel
  pathway (right side of the figure). This pathway appears to be favored in most tissues.
  In the Bloch pathway (left side of the figure) reduction of the Δ24-bond occurs
  as the last enzymatic step that converts desmosterol to cholesterol. Significant
  levels of desmosterol are found in the developing brain. The enzyme names and the
  corresponding genes are in italics (small and large type, respectively). *The C-4
  demethylation complex consists of three proteins (NSHDL, sterol C-4 methyloxidase,
  and 3β-ketosterol reductase). Syndromes associated with defects at specific steps
  are indicated in red, bold type, genes in green, and enzymes in blue. HEM dysplasia
  and Antley-Bixler syndrome are in parentheses to indicate that they are not simply
  due to disruption of the corresponding enzymatic reaction. 7DHC is a precursor for
  both cholesterol and Vitamin D. In skin tissue photolysis of 7DHC in the skin leads
  to the formation of previtamin D3.
