caption: Representative strategies to optimize cytoplasmic signaling of CD28ζ CAR.
  (A) By mutating the two membrane-distal ITAMs while keeping the membrane-proximal
  ITAM intact (1XX), the cytotoxicity and persistence of CARs can be balanced to improve
  therapeutic functions. (B) Small molecule-induced SHP1 phosphatase binding can tune
  down the basal phosphorylation level of CD28ζ CAR and reduce its antigen-dependent
  response. (C) Incorporation of signaling modules from cytokine receptor (signal
  3) specifically activates the JAK-STAT pathway and improves the persistence and
  anti-tumor effect of CD28ζ CAR. (D) CAR signaling can be optimized through direct
  manipulation of transcription factors. NR4A knockout or c-Jun over-expression can
  counteract the exhaustion of CAR-T cells and improve their anti-tumor efficacy.
