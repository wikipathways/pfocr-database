caption: Pathways to cell death. The stress pathway is initiated by BH3-only proteins
  (‘BH3’), which inactivate the Bcl-2-like proteins, keeping them from restraining
  Bax and Bak. Bax or Bak can permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane, releasing
  cyto-chrome c, which provokes Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1) to
  activate caspase-9. The ‘death receptor’ pathway is activated when ligands of the
  TNF family engage with and aggregate their cognate receptors on the cell surface
  and activate caspase-8 via adaptor proteins that include FADD. The two pathways
  are largely independent, but in certain cells the death receptor pathway engages
  the stress pathway via a cleaved form of the BH3-only protein Bid (tBid), which
  can engage Bcl-2 homologs and perhaps Bax (see text).
