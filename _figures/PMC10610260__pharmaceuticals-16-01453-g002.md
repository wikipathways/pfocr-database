caption: Dexmedetomidine’s highlighted mechanisms of action. (A) depicts the cellular
  signaling pathways present during the binding of norepinephrine to alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic
  receptors. Alpha2-adrenergic receptors play a role in an endogenous negative feedback
  loop to reduce norepinephrine release, which is the mechanism that dexmedetomidine
  is designed to mimic. (B) depicts dexmedetomidine’s cellular signaling pathway behind
  the therapeutic agent’s antinociception through alpha2-adrenergic activation in
  reducing the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide and subsequent nociceptive
  signaling. (C) depicts the basic interaction between dexmedetomidine and imidazoline-2
  receptors on the outer mitochondrial membrane in regulating intracellular calcium
  levels and producing beneficial autophagy in the setting of cellular stress.
