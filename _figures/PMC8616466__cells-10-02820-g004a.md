caption: p53/caspase-8 death signaling involvement in Bad knockdown embryos at 24
  hpf. (A) A network signaling death pathway was proposed based on accumulated data.
  The p53/caspase-8/tBid-mediated death pathway was induced. It also required upstream
  signaling from loss of Bad, leading to enhanced environmental stress with increased
  ROS and enhanced apoptotic cell death via the stress/death gene p53 and its correlated
  downstream gene expression caspase-8 or activation of tBid by cleavage from Bid.
  (B) Clear upregulation of p53 and caspase-8 demonstrated via qRT-PCR. All data were
  analyzed using either paired or unpaired Student’s t-tests, as appropriate. * p
  < 0.01. (C) Identification of apoptotic-related protein expression of p53/caspase-8/tBid
  as key molecules by Western blotting analysis at 24 hpf. Both p53 and caspase-8
  showed stronger expression compared to the control group, correlated with downstream
  Bid cleavage and anti-apoptotic number Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression levels. (D) qRT-PCR
  evaluation of apoptosis-related gene expression with Bad knockdown in p53 mutant
  lines at 24 hpf. (E) Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related protein expression
  with Bad knockdown in p53 mutant fish lines correlated with downstream protein Bid
  cleavage and anti-apoptotic number Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression levels.
