caption: (A-E) Example pathways with gaps. Different gap-filling methods are indicated
  as titles. The total number of reactions for each method is given as N. Up to three
  genes encoding enzymes carrying out each reaction are shown in boxes with enzyme
  names indicated. See  for compound abbreviations and names.(A) Leucine degradation
  pathway in KEGG with a gap (yellow box) filled by SACURE.(B) Tryptophan degradation
  pathway with a gap filled by lenient annotation.(C) Trehalose production and degradation
  pathway with a gap filled by literature-based annotation.(D) Carnitine biosynthesis
  with two gaps filled by adding two unknown enzymes for which no KO group is available
  for annotation.(E) Potential gluconic acid degradation pathway with a gap filled
  by a transport reaction not annotated and not found in other eukaryotic models in
  BiGG.
