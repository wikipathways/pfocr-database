caption: Mechanisms responsible for the cytoprotective and antiinflammatory effects
  of PARP inhibitors in nononcological diseases. (A) PARP activation and consequent
  NAD+ depletion (the “Berger Hypothesis”). These processes can lead to a cellular
  energetic deficit and cell dysfunction; inhibition of PARP prevents these processes
  and exerts cytoprotective effects (inhibition of cell necrosis). (B) Role of PARP
  activation and free PAR polymers in inducing mitochondrial release of AIF (apoptosis-inducing
  factor), which, in turn induces cell death (parthanatos). Inhibition of PARP suppresses
  these processes and inhibits parthanatos. (C) The role of PARP in liberating free
  PAR polymers, which, on their own, exert cytotoxic effects; inhibition of PARP prevents
  free PAR polymer formation and suppresses cell death. (D) PARylation contributes
  to activation of the proteasome through an interaction with RNF146; PARP inhibitors
  suppress these processes. (E) Role of PARP in contributing to proinflammatory signal
  transduction via enhancing JNK-mediated (left sequence) and NF-κB–mediated (right
  sequence) activation of multiple genes and gene products. By inhibiting PARP, these
  processes are attenuated and inflammatory signaling can be attenuated. (F) PARP
  regulates the activation of the cytoprotective Akt pathway. Under normal conditions,
  PARylation anchors the ATM–NEMO complexes, which are retained in the nucleus. However,
  after PARP inhibition, the ATM–NEMO complex translocates to the cytoplasm, where
  Akt and mTOR are recruited to form the ATM–NEMO–Akt–mTOR cytoprotective signalosome,
  which, in turn, activates various mitochondrial protective and cell-survival pathways.
