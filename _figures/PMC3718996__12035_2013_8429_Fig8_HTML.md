caption: Graphs showing the different regulation of glioma cell signaling when cells
  were cultured on biomatrix, myelin and unmyelinated tissue (retina). Arrows indicate
  the up- and downregulation of intracellular signaling members of the Rho kinase
  pathway. These differences likely explain that alternative pathways exist for migration
  on different substrates
