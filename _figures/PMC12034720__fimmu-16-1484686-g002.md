caption: 'Intestinal immune response process induced by parasitic infection. Recognition
  and dissemination: (A) Parasitic antigens are recognized and captured by antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) in the lamina propria. (B) Induction: APCs activate T cells in the
  mesenteric lymph nodes. TGF-β and IL-10 promote the differentiation of regulatory
  T cells (Tregs), while IL-4 promotes the differentiation of Th2 cells. Th2 cells
  secrete IL-4 and IL-13, further stimulating plasma cells to produce IgA, IgM, and
  IgE antibodies. Meanwhile, Th17 and Th1 cell responses are inhibited, reducing the
  production of IFN-γ and TNF-α. (C) Clearance and resolution: In the lamina propria,
  ILC2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-13, and IL-22, recruiting and activating eosinophils
  and M2 macrophages to promote anti-parasitic immune responses. Monocytes also participate
  in the resolution of inflammation under the influence of IL-10 and TGF-β. Through
  multiple pathways, the inflammatory response is regulated, restoring intestinal
  homeostasis'
