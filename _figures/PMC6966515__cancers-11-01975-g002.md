caption: Schematic showing the numerous cellular events which are altered by viral
  proteins in transformed cells (see key bottom right corner). All tumour-selective
  viral proteins undergo PTM’s in the form of phosphorylation to become active. This
  occurs by kinases which may be upregulated in cancer, however the exact kinases
  may vary between cell-type. Proteins can freely translocate between the nucleus
  and the cytoplasm via the nuclear localisation and export sequences they all contain.
  PTM may impair this nuclear transport (evidence shown at least for Apoptin which
  builds up in the nucleus of cancer cells). Viral proteins can multimerise although
  it is unclear whether this happens in specific cellular compartments. The figure
  uses apoptin as an example, which tends to multimerise in the nucleus where it accumulates
  in aggregates. Components of the parallel apoptosis pathways (intrinsic and extrinsic)
  can be activated by most of the viral proteins discussed. Collectively though, they
  all result in some form of caspase activation which typically results in downstream
  activation of convergent pathways leading to apoptosis. Uniquely, Apoptin can promote
  the abnormal translocation of Nur77 from the nucleus to the mitochondria, leading
  to MOMP and thus activation of the intrinsic cell death pathway. Non-canonical modes
  of cell death may also appear in different forms, which can be altered by viral
  proteins and will naturally feed into the classical apoptosis pathways further downstream.
  This includes perturbations of the cell cycle, which could occur when some viral
  proteins interact with the APC/C. These proteins can all also promote cytoskeleton
  remodelling through interactions with different family members of Rho GTPases, as
  well as disrupting/activating growth factor signalling pathways. Overall, the landscape
  of tumour-selective cell death induced by these viral proteins is extremely complex
  and probably does not occur through a signal pathway, instead occurring through
  the activation and crosstalk of multiple intricate pathways.
