caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of TGF-β activates cancer metastasis potential
  by inducing metabolic reprogramming and bioenergetic adaptation. Platelet-CTCs interactions
  lead to the secretion of TGF-β, which triggers the activation of PI3K-AKT and Smad
  signaling pathways, thereby inducing EMT in HCT116 cells (depicted in the blue section),
  ultimately transforming them into highly metastatic HCT116 (H-HCT116) cells (depicted
  in the pink section). On the one hand, TGF-β stimulates the expression of HK1 and
  HK2 in CTCs by activating the AKT signaling pathway, inducing metabolic reprogramming
  in them. H-HCT116 cells can compensate for impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
  energy supply caused by oligomycin A treatment by upregulating HK expression and
  glycolytic metabolism. On the other hand, H-HCT116 cells regulate the rate of cell
  division by downregulating the expression of CDK2, CDK4, and Cyclin D1 proteins
  while upregulating the expression of p21. This reduces cell proliferation to conserve
  energy for survival when OXPHOS is inhibited by oligomycin A
