caption: (A) Schematic representation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways.
  Dotted lines indicate positive (green) or negative (red) regulation, and the solid
  lines refer to release of Smac and cyto c from mitochondria. The regulatory interactions
  considered in the model are highlighted in gray. The numbers 1–4 refer to additional
  feedbacks described in the Discussion.(B) Kinetic scheme of the model. The reactions
  depicted in gray, which are involved in Casp3-mediated feedback cleavage of Casp9,
  were eliminated in the Casp9-mutant model in order to dissect the role of XIAP-mediated
  feedback.A*, activated Apaf-1; C3, Casp3; C9, Casp9.
