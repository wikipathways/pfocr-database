caption: Therapeutic approaches for Treg enrichment in vivo. There is an array of
  systemically or locally delivered molecules that may promote Treg proliferation,
  phenotype stability, and functionality in vivo. Among them, IL-2 has been described
  as a major growth factor for T cells, particularly important for Treg physiology.
  IL-2 binds to its receptor CD25, whose signaling pathway induces Foxp3 expression
  on Tregs and inhibits Th17 differentiation. Foxp3 enables the expression of canonical
  Treg features, such as CTLA-4, GITR, and anti-inflammatory cytokines. On the other
  hand, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and calcitriol (VitD3), active metabolites
  of vitamins A and D, have shown to reinforce suppressive functions of Tregs. atRA
  induces the binding of the RA receptor (RAR) and the retinoic X receptor (RXR) to
  an intronic enhancer of foxp3 gene locus, increasing its expression. Similarly,
  VitD3 binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which later binds to RXR, forming a
  heterodimer that translocates towards the nucleus to promote Foxp3 expression. Also,
  VitD3 induces tolerogenic dendritic cells (DC Tol), with an immature phenotype that
  may drive Treg responses. Rapamycin (RAPA) inhibits mTOR signaling pathway, allowing
  preferential expansion of Tregs, and blocks critical Teff functions. Additionally,
  IL-33 binds to ST2 receptor, promoting further Foxp3 and ST2 expression on Tregs.
  Also, indirectly, IL-33 supports Treg expansion, inducing IL-2 secretion by myeloid
  cells, which stimulates additional ST2 expression. Finally, CCL22-loaded nanoparticles
  may recruit CCR4+ Tregs locally, decreasing Teffs and their pro-inflammatory functions.
