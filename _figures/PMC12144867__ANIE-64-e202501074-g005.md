caption: Novel chemistry and biosynthesis of archaeal lanthipeptides. a,b) The BGC
  constructions, precursors, and chemical structures of classical and DADC lanthipeptides.
  The excised residues within precursor peptides are depicted in gray, while the enduring
  core peptide residues are illustrated in blue. The C/N termini in the structure
  are in red, and specific modifications at the N‐terminus are in blue. The stereo
  structures of medlan A1 (13) and Larlan A5 (15) are deduced based on the stereo
  structure of Larlan A2 (14). c) LC‐MS analysis evaluated the production of larlan
  A2 in the in vivo reconstitution of BGC lar with/without gene larH. d) Proposed
  biosynthetic pathway of DADC lanthipeptides, demonstrated by archalan β3
