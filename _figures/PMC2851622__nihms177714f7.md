caption: Absorption of a photon (hv) induces 11-cis to all-trans isomerization of
  the retinaldehyde chromophore, resulting in activated opsin (MII) inside a cone
  outer segment. Decay of MII releases all-trans-retinaldehyde (atRAL), which is reduced
  to all-trans-retinol (atROL) by NADPH-dependent all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase
  (atRDH). all-trans-retinol released into the extracellular space by rods and cones
  is taken up by Müller cells, which contain the novel all-trans-retinol isomerase
  activity. This enzyme catalyzes passive isomerization between all-trans-retinol
  and 11-cis-retinol. Müller cells also contain CRALBP, which binds 11-cis-retinol
  but not all-trans-retinol (). Isomerization of all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol
  (11cROL) is driven by mass-action through the activity of a novel 11-cis-retinyl
  ester (11cRE) synthase, which catalyzes esterification of 11-cis-retinol using palm-CoA
  (or other fatty-acyl-CoA's) as an acyl-donor. Retinyl ester hydrolase (REH) is activated
  by apo-CRALBP to yield 11-cis-retinol, which is released by the Müller cell and
  taken up by cones. The all-trans-retinol and 11-cis-retinol within the extracellular
  space in transit between cones and Müller cells are bound to IRBP. Within the cone
  outer segment is a new NADP+-dependent 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (11cRDH), which
  oxidizes 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinaldehyde. 11-cis-retinaldehyde combines with
  apo-opsin to regenerate cone opsin pigment. The novel enzymatic activities presented
  in this paper are displayed in blue.
