caption: The interactions of the insulin receptor linked-redox signaling pathways.
  This scheme shows the major interactions of insulin signaling involving the activation
  of the receptor tyrosine kinase cascade. This leads to the initial redox-mediated
  priming of the receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and its IRS proteins. The scheme
  also links the ligand activation bypass of insulin signaling mediated by reactive
  oxygen species. The steady-state level of tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins
  is regulated by PTPases, a family of enzymes that constitutes one of the key targets
  of regulation by reactive oxygen species.
