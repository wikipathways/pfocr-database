caption: FA/TAG metabolism in hepatocytes. Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) are
  taken from blood into hepatocytes or synthesized from glucose. NEFAs are converted
  to fatty acyl-CoA esters, then are subjected to β-oxidation (Only mitochondrial
  β-oxidation pathway is shown for simplification), or generation of triacylglycerol
  (TAG) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). TGA is stored in the hepatocytes
  in the form of lipid droplets, which are coated by perilipin 1–3 and cell death
  inducing DFFA like effector (CIDE) a-c to prevent excessive lipolysis. The genes
  regulated by PPARα, PPARγ, and SREBP1c are indicated in pink, green, and blue, respectively.
  PPARα activation drives FA elimination, but the signaling of PPARγ and SREBP1c stimulates
  lipogenesis and TAG storage. ACACA, acetyl-CoA carboxylase α; ACACB, acetyl-CoA
