caption: The diagram was constructed based on the metabolic pathways summarized in
  the hypersensitive cell death response in Arabidopsis by Raffaele et al. Enzymes
  and partial diagrams marked in red or green indicate strongly enhanced or repressed
  regulation, respectively, in russet fruit skin at the transcript and/or protein
  levels. The differential regulation of wax esters in russet skin are indicated in
  red. We hypothesize that a low content of VLCFAs represses the biosynthesis of signaling
  molecules that could block or alter the signaling pathway, as indicated by the dotted
  arrow. PM plasma membrane; CW cell wall
