caption: A simplified model of the molecular pathways by which neratinib and valproate
  combine to kill cancer cells. As an HDAC inhibitor, sodium valproate causes DNA
  damage. This activates an ATM–AMPK pathway that inactivates mTOR, activated ULK1,
  and results in ATG13 phosphorylation and autophagosome formation. Neratinib both
  inhibits and downregulates the expression of ERBB family receptors as well as other
  fellow-traveler RTKs and mutant RAS proteins. Sodium valproate enhances HSP90 and
  GRP78 acetylation which reduces chaperone activity and neratinib reduces the protein
  levels of HSP90 and GRP78; this results in an endoplasmic reticulum stress response,
  phosphorylation of eIF2α, and increased expression of Beclin1 and ATG5, that in
  turn facilitate autophagosome formation. Cathepsin B, from autolysosomes both cleaves
  BID to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and acts as a direct cell killing protease.
  Elevated ER stress signaling reduces MCL-1 and BCL-XL levels which facilitates AIF
  release and AIF translocation to the nucleus where it executes the tumor cell.
