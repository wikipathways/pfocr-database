caption: Metabolite levels were more affected by genotype than diet. Pathway heat
  map of metabolites measured in total heart homogenates of WT and GlycoHi fed short-term
  low-fat (LF) or high-fat (HF) diet. The relative content of primary metabolites
  is represented by the false color heat map of the -fold changes between diet and
  genotype conditions. A, effect of diet on the metabolite profile of WT and GlycoHi
  mice. B, genotypic effect on the metabolite profile of WT and GlycoHi mice. Data
  are -fold change of means in log10 scale. Dashed arrows, indirect reactions.
