caption: Schematic of APN signaling pathway. AMPK is the master kinase that regulates
  various intracellular signaling molecules, including sirtuin and PGC‐1α, leads to
  stimulation of insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxidative metabolism.
  APN also activates p38‐MAPK, inhibiting GSK‐3β activity, leading to stimulation
  of neurogenesis and suppression of neurodegeneration. It is predicted that a crosstalk
  between the two pathways may be important for many biological effects in the nervous
  system.
