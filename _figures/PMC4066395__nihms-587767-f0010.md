caption: (A) In WT embryos, mature muscles associate with their corresponding tendon
  cells via an ECM-rich matrix (shown in blue) between the cells. Msk is required
  in the muscle and functions via secreted Vein to affect tendon cell function. Binding
  of Vein to the tendon-expressed Egfr activates a signaling cascade through activated
  MAPK. Activated MAPK translocates to the nucleus and with SrA, activates downstream
  genes to induce terminal differentiation in the tendon cells. Tight association
  of the muscle-expressed αPS2βPS integrin heterodimer to ECM proteins (such as the
  SrA target Tsp) is essential to withstand the force of muscle contraction. Msk may
  directly affect Vein secretion, accumulation and/or localization at the site of
  the muscle-tendon attachment site. Alternatively, Msk may affect Vein activity indirectly
  by modulating integrin-mediated adhesion. This adhesive function is required for
  Vein to properly activate the Egfr signaling pathway in the tendon cells. The effect
  of Msk on integrin-mediated adhesion may be direct or occur via phosphoproteins
  such as pFAK. Solid arrows denote previously published studies. Dotted arrows represent
  potential role(s) of Msk based upon our results. (B) In msk mutants, the ECM matrix
  (blue) is reduced in size and the muscle is no longer attached at the muscle-tendon
  attachment site. Terminal tendon cell differentiation does not occur as Sr and activated
  MAPK are dramatically reduced. Subsequently, Tsp expression and secretion is reduced,
  presumably resulting in smaller attachment sites. Within the muscle cells, pFAK
  is absent. Here, dotted lines and arrows denote a loss of protein and/or function
  due to a decrease in Msk protein.
