caption: General schematic of base excision repair following methyl base damage. The
  first step is carried out by a DNA glycosylase, which produces an abasic site. The
  second step is carried out by an AP endonuclease, which creates a nick 5′- to the
  abasic site. DNA synthesis replaces a single nucleotide (short patch) or several
  nucleotides (long patch). The 5′-dRP group is removed by 5′-dRP lyase (short patch)
  or as part of an overhang by a ‘flap’ endonuclease (long patch). DNA ligase seals
  the nick to complete the pathway. Incomplete BER intermediates, in particular the
  5′-dRP group, are thought to lead to downstream consequences such as chromosomal
  aberrations and toxicity.
