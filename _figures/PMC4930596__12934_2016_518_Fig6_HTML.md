caption: The functions of differential proteins in metabolic pathway. Identified differential
  proteins were searched according to KEGG, and the picture of metabolic pathways
  is drawn by Microsoft Visio. The function of increased proteins pathways and enzymes
  are marked in red in pathway, whereas the function of reduced proteins and enzymes
  are marked in green in pathway
