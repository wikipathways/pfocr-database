caption: Depictions of different mechanisms involved in the maintenance of microbial
  homeostasis in the insect gut. The microbial homeostasis is attained by AMPs and
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The Imd pathway is activated during high
  viral loads by recognising bacteria-derived peptidoglycan by the cell surface protein
  (PGRP-LC) and cytoplasmic receptor (PGRP-LE). PGRP-SD enhances Imd pathway signalling.
  AMPs are produced by the Imd pathway in the gut. Texts written in red are the negative
  regulators of the Imd pathway. Duox (member of NADPH oxidase family) produces ROS.
  It is mainly regulated by the Duox activity pathway and Duox expression pathway.
  Recently, MESH-regulated Duox activity has also been reported. Besides Imd pathway-mediated
  AMP production, the JAK/STAT pathway also produces a few AMPs. The combining of
  Upd molecules (cytokines) to the Dome receptor activates JAK/STAT signalling. Ptp61F
  and Socs36E are the negative regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway. The text written
  in green describes the regulatory aspect of different mechanisms in microbial homeostasis.
  DAP PGN—Diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan (PGN), PGRP—PGN recognition
