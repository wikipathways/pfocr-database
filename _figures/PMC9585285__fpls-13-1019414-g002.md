caption: An overview of UPR signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. The plant UPR signaling
  pathway has two branches. The first branch is mediated by IRE1a and IRE1b. Under
  ER stress, the chaperone protein BiP, binds to unfolded proteins, thereby releasing
  IRE1 to form an active dimeric or polymeric form. Activated IRE1 splices the mRNA
  of bZIP60u to produce bZIP60s, releasing a hairpin RNA (in red). The spliced fragments
  of bZIP60 mRNA will be reunited by t-RNA ligase RLG1. bZIP60s mRNA encodes the active
  transcription factor bZIP60s, which can enter the nucleus to induce the expression
  of related UPR target genes. In addition, activated IRE1 is involved in another
  process, known as RIDD (regulated IRE1-dependent decay), which degrades other mRNAs
  and ultimately reduces the synthesis of new proteins. The second branch is mediated
  by bZIP17 and bZIP28, two ER membrane-localized transcription factors. Under ER
  stress conditions, bZIP17 and/or bZIP28 are relocated from the ER to the Golgi,
  where they are hydrolyzed by S1P and S2P protease, and subsequently their hydrolyzed
  TF domains (bZIP17p and/or bZIP28p) are released for further importing to the nucleus
  to regulate the expression of ER stress responsive genes. IRE1c is a recently discovered
  plant-specific IRE1 subtype, but the exact function of IRE1c and its role in plant
  UPR pathway need to be further examined.
