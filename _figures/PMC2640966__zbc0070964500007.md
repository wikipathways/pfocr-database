caption: Model of how DGAT1 deficiency modulates RA signaling in skin. LRAT  is the
  major pathway for maintaining adequate stores of retinol, as retinyl  esters, in
  the skin. However, the ARAT activity of DGAT1 is important for  generating retinyl
  esters when retinol levels are excessive and preventing  retinol toxicity. In DGAT1
  deficiency in murine skin, excess retinol is  converted to retinaldehyde and subsequently
  to RAs, which modulate gene  expression and hair cycling. If retinol is depleted
  from the diet, the effects  of DGAT1 deficiency are minimized.
