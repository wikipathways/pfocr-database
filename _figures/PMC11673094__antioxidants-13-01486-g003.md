caption: Targeting to attenuate the inflammation is illustrated and summarized. Eicosapentaenoic
  acid (EPA) suppresses long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) to reduce inflammation
  via p21 and NF-kB signaling pathways. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduces intracellular
  PA accumulation, and DHA also attenuates inflammation through the NF-kB pathway.
  Adiponectin (APN) inhibits NOX2 expression to suppress ROS production, and APN inhibits
  the NF-kB pathway to reduce the inflammation of endothelial cells. Blueberries inhibit
  NOX4 expression to reduce ROS production. Meanwhile, blueberries suppress NF-kB
  pathway-related inflammation. Clinopodium Chinense (CCE) inhibits the expression
  of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which consequently suppresses MyD88/TRIF/TRAF 6
  to reduce inflammation with inhibition of MAPK and NF-kB pathway. Homoplantaginin
  suppressed TXNIP/NLRP3/caspase-1-related pathway to reduce inflammation. Apigenin
  suppressed proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, and adhesion molecules ICAM and
  VCAM related to inflammation. Withaferin A (WA) inhibited inflammation through NF-kB-related
  pathways. Myeloid cell-derived growth factor (MYDGF) suppressed PKC/MAP4K4/NF-kB
  signaling pathway to ameliorate inflammation of endothelial cells
