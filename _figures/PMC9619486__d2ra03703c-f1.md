caption: Illustration of the role of MCM7 in DNA replication. MCM7 forms a hexameric
  ring with the other MCM complex members that bind to DNA and assist the replication
  pathway. GINS and CDC45 collectively form the CMG complex that helps to catalyze
  the helicase activity of the complex. The origin of replication forks in the double-stranded
  DNA at origin, and synthesis by DNA polymerases occurs upon DNA unwinding.
