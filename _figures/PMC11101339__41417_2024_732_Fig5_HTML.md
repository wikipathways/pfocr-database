caption: Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), those released by tumor cells killed by
  radiation, are presented to immune cells, and activated CD8+ Teffs are recruited
  to the tumor and release IFN-γ. The level of PD-1 on CD8+ Teffs and PD-L1 on tumor
  cells are increased, and tumor cells can be killed accompanied by enhanced response
  of PD-1 inhibitors. VEGF inhibits DCs maturation and the activation and infiltration
  of Teffs, while upregulating the activity of MDSCs and Tregs. OVs selectively kill
  cancer cells, thereby releasing TAAs, PAMPs and DAMPs to activate APCs. OVs promote
  the production of IFN and T cell-recruiting chemokines to recruit Teffs into the
  tumor, and induce PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and MHC I expression. Furthermore,
  oncolytic virotherapy decreases immunosuppressive cells, and reduces VEGF levels
  in TME. EZH2 inhibitor promotes the growth, differentiation and activation of NK
  cells, and promotes the secretion of CXCL9 and CXCL10 to recruit NK cells, M1 TAMs,
  and CD4+ and CD8+ Teffs to the tumor, thereby killing tumor cells. EZH2 inhibitor
  upregulates the expression of MHC I and MHC II and increases the expression of PD-L1
  on tumor cells and PD-1 on CD8+ Teffs. Furthermore, EZH2 inhibitor decreases Tregs
  infiltration and inhibits VEGF-A/AKT signaling pathway.(Created with BioRender.com)
