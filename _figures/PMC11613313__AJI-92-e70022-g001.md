caption: Transforming growth factor‐beta3 (TGFβ3) produced by fibroid reduces bone
  morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) expression and interfere with bone morphogenetic
  protein‐2 (BMP‐2) binding to receptors results in decreased expression of homeobox‐A10
  、11 and leukemia inhibitory factor (HOXA10, HOXA11, LIF), thus affecting endometrial
  decidualization and endometrial receptivity. Tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α)
  responds to the immune response in three ways, abnormal expression of TNF‐α may
  lead to implantation failure and infertility. Vascular endothelial cell growth factor
  (VEGF) and adrenomedullin (ADM) are both angiogenic factors that cause abnormal
  angiogenesis through the PI3K‐AKT signaling pathway. The mechanical stress generated
  by fibroids is transformed into biological signals that interfere with gene expression,
  resulting in abnormal endometrial decidualization
