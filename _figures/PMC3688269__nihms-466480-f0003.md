caption: 'Given that the aforementioned mouse models all possess wild-type p53 capable
  of inducing both apoptosis and senescence, it remained unclear how dysfunctional
  telomeres limit neoplastic growth in vivo. While apoptosis clearly has a tumor suppressive
  role in vivo, until recently it was not clear whether p53-dependent replicative
  senescence plays a role in tumor suppression in vivo. Several reasons account for
  why replicative senescence was not initially recognized as a tumor suppressor mechanism
  in vivo. First, since the laboratory mice normally possess very long telomeres,
  it was not even clear whether a replicative senescence mechanism exists in mice.
  Second, compared to apoptosis, it is relatively difficult to reliably detect the
  presence of senescence cells in vivo. Until recently, only the SA-β-galactosidase
  assay was available to mark senescent cells. However, there now exist several promising
  markers to detect both senescent mouse and human cells in vivo-. Two recent studies
  specifically examined the role of telomere-induced replicative senescence as a mechanism
  of tumor suppression in the telomerase knockout mice (). The first study looked
  at lymphoma development in the context of telomere dysfunction using the established
  Eμ-myc transgenic model for Burkett’s lymphoma. Tumorigenesis was markedly reduced
  in late generation mTerc−/−, Eμ-myc cohort: while wild type mice and early generation
  mTerc−/−, Eμ-myc mice developed B-cell lymphoma by 200 days, only 25% of mTerc−/−,
  Eμ-myc mice possessing dysfunctional telomeres succumbed to this cancer. Examination
  of tumors from late generation mice revealed increased end-to-end chromosomal fusion
  and non-reciprocal translocations, hallmarks of genomic instability due to telomere
  dysfunction. To examine the role of p53-dependent apoptosis in mediating tumor suppression,
  the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 was overexpressed in hematopoietic stem cells harvested
  from mTerc−/− mice with dysfunctional telomeres. If p53-dependent apoptosis is the
  main driver of tumor suppression in the setting of telomere dysfunction, then its
  elimination by Bcl-2 overexpression should result in rapid development of lymphoma
  when transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. Indeed, reconstitution of
  Bcl-2 expressing stem cells derived from wild type and G1 mTerc−/−, Eμ-myc bone
  marrows resulted in palpable tumors within 6 weeks post-transplantation. However,
  transplantation of G5/6 mTerc−/−, Eμ-myc, Bcl-2 bone marrow failed to produce any
  tumors 100 days post-transplantation. Examination of lymph nodes from these mice
  revealed the presence of small encapsulated tumors with a 3-fold decrease in mitotic
  index and positive staining for senescent markers SA-β-Gal, p16 and p15. These results
  suggest that dysfunctional telomeres could activate a cellular senescence pathway
  to suppress tumorigenesis in the absence of apoptosis to suppress tumorigenesis,
  while this pathway was not elicited in the tumors with competent telomeres.'
