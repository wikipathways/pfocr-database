caption: Our previous report established that IL-8 promotes HNSCC progression along
  CXCR1/2-mediated NOD1/RIP2 signaling pathway. This study reveals that IL-8 promotes
  inflammatory mediators and stimulates both activation of p38 MAPK/ERK-NF-κB pathway
  and reduction of JNK level in HNSCC progression and migration. Two instances of
  IL-8-mediated mechanical signaling in HNSCC cells are schematically depicted. Results
  in this figure can be utilized to develop biomarkers and targets in HNSCC and to
  provide a basis for early diagnosis and treatment.
