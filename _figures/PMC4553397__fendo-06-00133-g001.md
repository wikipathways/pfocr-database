caption: 'Intracellular mechanisms involved in the control of FGF21 production and
  action on the heart. In response to cardiac insults, cardiomyocytes induce the expression
  of FGF21. To date, one transcriptional pathway has been implicated in governing
  this process: the Sirt1–PPARα pathway. This pathway induces the expression of FGF21,
  which can be released by cardiac cells. Moreover, FGF21 acts on the heart, protecting
  it from cardiac damage. The molecular mechanisms involved in FGF21-mediated cardioprotection
  include activation of the FGF21 receptor, FGFR1, and the co-factor, β-Klotho, and
  subsequent activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Phosphorylated CREB and p38-MAPK act
  through different intracellular mechanisms to exert protection against cardiac damage.'
