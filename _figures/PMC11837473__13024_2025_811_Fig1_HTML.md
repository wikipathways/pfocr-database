caption: The integrated stress response signaling pathway. The ISR can be initiated
  upon sensing ER stress, dsRNA, amino acid deprivation, and heme depletion, which
  are recognized by PERK, PKR, GCN2, and HRI respectively. Once activated, the four
  kinases converge in the phosphorylation of eIF2α that then activates ATF4. ATF4
  translocate to the nucleus in which promotes the translation of stress response
  genes. Evidence shows regulation of ISR through “negative feedback”. ATF4 induces
  the expression of GADD34, which promotes the dephosphorylation of eIF2α by recruiting
  CReP and PP1c, hence restoring protein synthesis. Figure was created in BioRender
