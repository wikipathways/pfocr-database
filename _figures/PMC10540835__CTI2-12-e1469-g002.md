caption: 'Dopaminergic modulation of immune responses in PD: DR‐dependent mechanism.
  Human and animal immune cells in the CNS and the periphery express all subtypes
  of dopamine receptors (DR): the D1‐like receptor subfamily (D1DR, D5DR) and the
  D2‐like receptor subfamily (D2DR, D3DR, D4DR). DA and dopaminergic mimetics target
  different immune components involved in neuroinflammation via a DR‐dependent mechanism:
  the nucleotide‐binding oligomerisation domain‐like receptor pyrin domain‐containing
  (NLRP)3 inflammasome, the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), NF‐kB signalling pathway
  ultimately impacting cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, apoptosis and the
  production of mediators (cytokines, NO). Microglia and astrocytes in CNS, and monocyte/macrophage,
  DC, T and B lymphocytes, naïve or polarised according to anti‐inflammatory (Treg)
  or pro‐inflammatory (Th1–Th17) phenotypes, and NK cells in the periphery all may
  be affected by D1‐like and D2‐like receptor activation. Both pro‐inflammatory and
  anti‐inflammatory roles have been observed depending on the type of immune cells,
  the species‐specificity (human or animal) or the specific state of the inflammatory
  condition. The figure was created with BioRender.com.'
