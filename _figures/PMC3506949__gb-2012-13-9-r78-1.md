caption: Overview of RELATCH framework for predicting metabolic flux distributions
  in perturbed microbial systems. (a) The metabolic flux distribution (w) and enzyme
  contributions (Wenz) in a reference state are first estimated using metabolic flux
  analysis (MFA), physiological measurements, and gene expression data. Variables
  are shown in bold blue letters and experimental measurements are shown in plain
  letters. (b) The metabolic flux distribution (v) in a perturbed state is predicted
  by minimizing the relative flux changes and latent pathway activation from the reference
  state. Two parameters are used to represent the extent of adaptation to perturbations,
  a penalty for latent pathway activation (α) and a limit on contribution increase
  in active enzymes (γ). (c) An illustrative example of using RELATCH to predict the
  effects of deleting an isozyme, where contributions of two isozymes are shown in
  green.
