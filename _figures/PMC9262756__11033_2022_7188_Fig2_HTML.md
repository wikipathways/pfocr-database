caption: A schematic diagram of the role of several miRNAs in regulating the Notch
  signaling pathway in epilepsy. Interaction between Notch and Delta or Jagged that
  exist on the surface of signal-sending cells could modulate the cleavage of Notch
  protein via ADAM10 metalloproteases and γ-secretase to create NICD. NICD could transfer
  to the nucleus to create a heterotrimer with RBP-J and MAML to promote transcription
  of various target genes, including HES1 and HES5 []. Mounting evidence indicates
  that overexpression of various miRNAs could have a significant role in triggering
  epilepsy through Notch signaling cascade. Recent research has represented that downexpression
  of miRNA-34a could have a crucial role in suppressing epileptiform discharges via
  modulating Notch signaling and apoptosis in the rat hippocampal neuronal model of
  SREDs. In fact, SREDs could Induce the promotion of miR‑34a expression level and
  decrease of the expression of Notch signaling (including Notch1, Notch2, Hes1 and
  Hes5) []. In addition, another study has demonstrated that overexpression of miR-139-5p
  could suppress spontaneous recurrent epileptiform discharge-induced oxidative stress
  and apoptosis through modulating the Notch pathway []
