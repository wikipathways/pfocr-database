caption: Overview of Cr metabolism and the methionine cycle. In the first, rate-limiting
  step of Cr biosynthesis, GAA is formed from arginine and glycine by AGAT (); in
  the rat, this reaction occurs primarily in the kidney (). Dietary Cr (primarily
  from meat) leads to pretranslational inhibition of AGAT (), thereby inhibiting endogenous
  Cr biosynthesis. GAA is transported to the liver, where it is methylated by GAMT
  to generate Cr, with SAM as the methyl donor (). The byproduct of this methylation
  reaction (and others) is SAH. SAH is hydrolyzed to generate Hcys. Hcys can be remethylated
  to methionine by MS, with 5-mTHF as the methyl donor, or it can be directed to the
  transsulfuration pathway through which it is ultimately catabolized. 5-mTHF also
  reduces Hcys by inhibition of GNMT, a major consumer of SAM (). Cr, whether derived
  from endogenous biosynthesis or dietary sources, is transported to tissues with
  high energy requirements such as the skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, where it
  is phosphorylated to PCr (). PCr is used for the regeneration of ATP during intensive
  exercise. Cr and PCr are converted nonenzymatically at a constant rate to Crn, which
  is then excreted in the urine (). AGAT, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase; Cr,
