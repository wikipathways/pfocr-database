caption: Regulation of the interleukin (IL)–17 axis is essential for oral immunity
  and homeostasis. (Left) Defects in the IL-17 pathway are linked to oral candidiasis.
  Defective generation of Th17 cells in patients with STAT3 mutations, gain-of-function
  STAT1 mutations, or impaired IL-17/IL-22 signaling (caused by IL-17 receptor or
  ligand mutations or neutralizing autoantibodies against IL-17/IL-22) are all linked
  to susceptibility to mucocutaneous (including oral) candidiasis. (Right) IL-17 overproduction
  is linked to aggressive periodontitis. Tissue neutrophils normally regulate IL-23
  production by antigen presenting cells (e.g., macrophages) and expansion of Th17
  cells. In contrast, leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I (LAD-I), which causes defective
  neutrophil transmigration, (1) leads to dysregulation of the IL-23/Th17 axis (2)
  and hence overproduction of the inflammatory and bone-resorptive cytokine IL-17
  (3). Inflammatory tissue breakdown products serve as nutrients for the local microbiome,
  thereby contributing to dysbiosis (4). Microbial by-products (including lipopolysaccharide)
  persistently stimulate the disinhibited IL-23/17 axis (5), further amplifying the
  destructive response.
