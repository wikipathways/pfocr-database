caption: Induced proximity has been shown to regulate initiation of transcription,
  signaling cascades, chromatin dynamics, proteasomal degradation, and subcellular
  localization. (A) Induced proximity has been systematically explored to bypass Tcell
  antigen receptor activation and for synthetic induction of a variety of signaling
  cascades. (B) CIPs have been developed for rapid induction of transcriptional activation
  (VP16) and repression (KRAB or HP1) using DNA binding domains (DBDs) as well as
  CIP of split–CRISPR-Cas proteins or CIP recruitment of activators or repressors
  through CRISPR-Cas9 systems. (C) CIP has been used for rapid protein localization,
  including nuclear import and export, localization to components of the secretory
  pathway, synaptic vesicles, and mitochondria. (D) Rapid proximity-based protein
  degradation is achieved through bifunctional molecule–mediated recruitment of E3
  ubiquitin ligase complexes (complex composed of E2, ROC1, CUL4A, DDB1, and CRBN).
  With a related approach, auxin can induce ubiquitin-mediated degradation through
  recruitment of the TIR1-Cul1 complex. (E) Induced proximity has been used for rapid
  induction of activated chromatin states through recruitment of ATP-dependent remodeling
  complexes and induction of repressive chromatin states through HP1-mediated heterochromatin
  formation.
