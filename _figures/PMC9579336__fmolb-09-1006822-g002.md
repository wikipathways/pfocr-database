caption: 'Metabolic roles and regulation of sterols and nonsterol isoprenoids in the
  cell. The Scap-SREBP complex is translocated to the Golgi where nuclear transcription
  factor SREBP-2 is released to increase transcription of HMGCR, LDLR, and other cholesterol
  biosynthetic enzymes. HMGCR expression is increased and catalyzes the conversion
  of HMG CoA to mevalonate increasing flux through the mevalonate pathway. The nonsterol
  metabolites (orange/yellow) serve as precursors for a variety of nonsterol isoprenoids
  that are vital for a number of cell processes. DMAPP is utilized for tRNA isopentenylation.
  FPP is converted to dolichol used in protein glycosylation in the ER, heme A, and
  ubiquinone for the mitochondria. FPP and GGPP are used for prenylation of proteins
  targeting them to membranes. GGPP is utilized with menadione for the formation of
  MK-4 by UBIAD1 in the Golgi. UBIAD1 cycles between the ER and the Golgi monitoring
  GGPP levels. As GGPP levels increase it binds UBIAD1 and is retained in the Golgi.
  FPP is also converted to squalene and is the first metabolite committed to the sterol
  synthesis branch of the pathway (red circles represent sterols). As cholesterol
  levels increase in ER membranes this inhibits Scap escorting SREBP to the Golgi
  for activation and oxysterols trigger Insig binding to HMGCR resulting in ERAD.
