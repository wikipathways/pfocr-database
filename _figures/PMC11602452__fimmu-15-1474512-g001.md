caption: Schematic representation of the proposed Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling
  pathway in shrimp. This diagram depicts the dual mechanism of TLR activation in
  crustaceans, highlighting both the cleavage of Spätzle (Spz) and direct recognition
  of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon pathogen detection, TLRs
  activate signaling cascades by recruiting the adaptor protein MyD88, which assembles
  a complex with Tube and Pelle. This recruitment triggers the phosphorylation and
  degradation of Cactus, thereby releasing Dorsal (and/or Dorsal-related immunity
  factor, DIF) to translocate to the nucleus. Additionally, the complex engages Pellino
  and TRAF6, which further amplify the signaling process. The culmination of these
  events is the transcriptional activation of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, critical
  for effective immune responses in shrimp. This pathway exhibits significant evolutionary
  conservation, reflecting similarities with TLR signaling in both Drosophila and
  mammals, while also showcasing unique adaptations in crustaceans. Created in BioRender.
