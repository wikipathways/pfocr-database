caption: The Plasticity of Cancer Cell Invasion. Cancer cells can invade either collectively
  or as individual cells when utilizing the amoeboid or mesenchymal invasion mode.
  Cells invading in one mode can undergo the mesenchymal-amoeboid, or amoeboid-mesenchymal
  mode (MAT and AMT, respectively) in response to current conditions and signaling
  within the extracellular matrix (ECM). The plasticity of invasion is further regulated
  by interactions with noncancer cells that contribute to signaling circuits. Tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs) produce proinvasive cytokines that affect invasion directly and
  sustain the cancer-associated phenotype of proximal fibroblasts. These cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) realign fibers of the ECM, which facilitates cancer cell invasion.
  The Rho/Rho-kinase (ROCK) pathway is crucial for many of these interactions and,
  thus, its inhibition downregulates cancer cell invasion (for more details, see the
  main text).
