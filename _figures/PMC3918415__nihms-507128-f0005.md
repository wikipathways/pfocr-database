caption: 'Molecular classification of invasive ductalbreast cancer. Genetic and gene-expression
  data classify invasive ductal carcinomas into two distinct molecular biological
  and clinicopathological pathways. (a) The low grade-like gene-expression molecular
  pathway is characterized by chromosome 16q loss, predominant estrogen receptor (ER)
  and progesterone receptor (PR) expression (ER+, PR+) and a low-grade gene-expression
  profile populated with genes associated with ER positivity (ER+). (b) The high grade-like
  gene-expression molecular pathway is characterized by loss of chromosome 13q, gain
  of 11q13 and/or amplification of 17q12, infrequent expression of ER and PR, and
  a high grade-like gene-expression signature populated with genes associated with
  cell cycle, centrosomal function and DNA repair. The low-grade tumors express a
  unique set of genes that are rarely expressed in high-grade tumors, and vice versa.
  The luminal A and luminal B subtypes constitute the majority of invasive breast
  cancers in the low grade-like gene-expression molecular pathway and generally display
  indolent clinical behavior, whereas the human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2)
  and basal subtypes constitute the majority of cancers in the high grade-like pathway
  and generally display an aggressive clinical behavior. Light blue rectangles denote
  morphological ductal subtypes. Abbreviations: HER+(−), presence (absence) of immunohistological
  expression or HER gene amplification: IDC, invasive ductal carcinoma; –16q, loss
  of chromosome 16q; +1q, gain of chromosome 1q; –13q, loss of chromosome 13q; +11q13,
  gain of chromosomal region 11q13; +17q12, amplification of chromosomal region 17q12.'
