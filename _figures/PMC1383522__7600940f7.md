caption: Model for NaCl detection and its plasticity in C. elegans. NaCl is detected
  by the ASE sensory neurons (green arrows), probably using cGMP/Ca2+signalling and
  an unknown signalling pathway. Attraction is antagonised by avoidance mediated by
  the ASH neurons (red arrows), using ODR-3, OSM-9, OCR2 and the inhibitor GRK-2.
  We propose that, upon prolonged exposure to attractive NaCl concentrations, an ASE-derived
  signal sensitises the ASH, ADL, ASI and ADF neurons, resulting in avoidance of normally
  attractive NaCl concentrations. We have shown that the ADF neurons use ODR-3, and
  the ASI neurons, a second pathway in the ASH neurons and probably the ADL neurons
  use GPC-1. Integration of these signals ultimately leads to the behavioural response
  of the animal.
