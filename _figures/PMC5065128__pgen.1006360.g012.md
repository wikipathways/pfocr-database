caption: 'Al stress induces the local up-regulation of TAA1 and YUCs in the root TZ
  through an ethylene-dependent pathway. PIF4, which is specifically up-regulated
  in root TZ in response to Al stress, also participates into the local up-regulation
  of YUCs. The Al–induced expression of PIF4 in the root TZ acts downstream of ethylene
  signaling. The locally induced TAA1 and YUCs in response to Al stress contribute
  to auxin accumulation in the root TZ, which suppresses primary root growth. Green
  represents GFP signaling; EZ: Elongation zone; TZ: Transition zone; MZ: Meristem
  zone.'
