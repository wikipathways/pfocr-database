caption: Genes commonly upregulated with all fungal isolates are represented in between
  their products. Colored squares next to each gene represent the log2fold change
  obtained with Kallisto and DESeq2. The asterisks represent the significance of the
  change (* < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001). Numbers within each colored square represent
  the number of indicators of a significant phylogenetic signal (out of five indicators)
  between the fungal phylogeny and the transcription of a given cassava gene. Genes
  that were shown to play a role, or putatively play a role, in fatty acid biosynthesis
  are represented. For a description of each gene acronym see Data .
