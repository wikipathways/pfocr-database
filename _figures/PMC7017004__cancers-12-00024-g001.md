caption: Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT5 signaling
  in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and tumor microenvironment. Distinct families
  of cytokines such as Interleukins (IL-6,IL-11) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)
  bind to their homodimeric cognate receptors IL-6R, IL-11R and LIFR respectively,
  and share a signal-transducing receptor gp130. Janus kinase (JAK) phosphorylate
  gp130 to enable docking and phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyrosine (symbol Y or Tyr)
  residue 705. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 can also be mediated by activation
  of other oncogenic proteins including growth factor (GF)-mediated receptor Tyrosine
  kinase (RTK) activation, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mediated
  activation, SRC and RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. Phosphorylated STAT3 dynamically undergo
  dimerization and nuclear translocation to trigger STAT3-mediated transcription of
  target genes. Binding of Prolactin to its receptor facilitate JAK-mediated phosphorylation
  of STAT5A and STAT5B at Tyr residue 694 and Tyr residue 699, respectively, leading
  to homodimerization or heterodimerization before nuclear translocation for target
  gene activation. STAT3 and STAT5 signaling in cancer cells release more cytokines
  into tumor microenvironment that generate a plethora of immune-compromising functions
  (highlighted in the main text). Figure created with Biorender.com.
