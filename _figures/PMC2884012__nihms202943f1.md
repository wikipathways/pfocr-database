caption: A complex series of phosphorylation events and other protein interactions
  regulate hamartin/tuberin and activity of the mTOR kinase. Initial growth factor
  binding to transmembrane receptors (not shown) activates PI-3 Kinase resulting in
  increased production of PIP3 with AKT activation that directly phosphorylates and
  inhibits tuberin. ERK can also phosphorylate and inactivate tuberin. In contrast,
  AMPK phosphorylation at distinct amino acid residues serves to activate tuberin.
  Loss of the TSC1 or TSC2 genes leads to constitutive activation of mTOR within mTORC1
  with greatly increased levels of phosphorylated ribosomal S6-kinase and phosphorylated
  ribosomal S6. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR activity within mTORC1 to restore inhibition
  of this kinase and downstream components within this signaling pathway. ATP indicates
  phosphorylation events.AKT (proto-oncogene also known as PKB); AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; ERK, Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases; FKBP38, FK506-binding
  protein 38; LKB1, Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome Kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; mTORC2, mammalian target of rapamycin
  two; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate;
