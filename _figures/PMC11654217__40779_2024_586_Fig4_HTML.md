caption: Mechanistic overview of targeting PD-1/PD-L1 by bioactive natural compounds.
  Various natural compounds inhibit signaling pathways involving JAK-STAT and Ras/Raf.
  Berberine, for example, decreases PD-L1 and Ki-67 levels while increasing cleaved
  caspase-3. Apigenin and luteolin inhibit IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression and STAT3
  phosphorylation. Curcumol reduces HIF-1α and VEGF protein levels, limiting crosstalk
  between STAT3 and HIF-1α pathways and restricting tumor growth. Evodiamine significantly
  reduces MUC1-C expression, modulating tumor development. Licochalcone A negatively
  regulates NF-κB and Ras/Raf/MEK signaling pathways. Erianin regulates Ras, VEGF,
  and HIF-1α expression, inhibiting tumoral growth. β-elemene inhibits p-Akt expression,
  while lycopene reduces IL-4 and IL-10 levels, enhancing antitumoral T cell activity.
  Panaxadiol restores T-lymphocytes’ tumor-killing activity, and sativan and polydatin
  regulate miRNA levels, controlling tumoral cell cycle pathways. Shikonin leads to
  CSN5 inactivation, degrading PD-L1, and activating tumor infiltration by T cells.
