caption: Organization of the genes encoding the enzymes of the de novo pathway, and
  their mode of transcriptional regulation by PurR in E. coli (A), B. subtilis (B)
  and L. lactis (C). Data are extracted from the BioCyc database (Caspi et al., 2020).
  In each panel, coding regions are shown by boxes with the same color code as in
  Figure 2. Horizontal arrows show the transcription direction from the promoters
  regulated by PurR and the +1 represents the first nucleotide transcribed. Of note,
  the PurR found in E. coli is non-homologous to the ones present in B. subtilis and
  L. lactis. Above the schematic diagram are detailed the regulatory elements on purMN
  operon as an example for E. coli and L. lactis and on the single pur operon for
  B. subtilis. (A) PurR (brown) interacts through a DNA binding sequence in the different
  pur operons or single genes and blocks the interaction of the RNA polymerase (RNA
  pol in black) with the TATA box, thus inhibiting the transcription. Hypoxanthine
  and guanine (mauve) are corepressors. (B) The interaction of (p)ppGpp (pink) with
  PurR (light cobalt blue) favors PurR binding to a DNA binding site composed of two
  boxes PurBox1 and PurBox2 upstream of the pur operon and inhibit the transcription
  of DNA. Conformational changes in PurR that occur upon PRPP (orange) binding inhibits
  PurR-DNA interaction, that results in the activation of DNA transcription. (C) The
  PurR (light cobalt blue) is in continuous interaction with DNA but only becomes
  activated after binding of PRPP (orange) on its allosteric site, which induces the
  recruitment of RNA polymerase (RNA pol in black) that binds to the TATA box of the
  promoter
