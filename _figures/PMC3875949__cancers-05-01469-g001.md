caption: Regulation of metabolism in maligant gliomas. EGFR signaling upregulates
  glycolysis and is mediated by PI3K/Akt signaling through inducing GLUT1 translocation
  to the cell membrane as well as activation of HK2 and PFK. EGFR signaling also upregulates
  PKM2 expression via activation of the PKCε/NF-κB signaling pathway. Large amounts
  of lactate are generated even in abundant oxygen conditions. In addition to oxidative
  phosphorylation, glucose is converted to fatty acids through generation of citrate
  in the mitochondria, which is in turn released into to cytoplasm and lysed by ACLY
  to generate the fatty acid precursor acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is then used for palmitate
  synthesis and is regulated by ACC and FAS. SCD1 further catalyzes saturated fatty
  acids to monounsaturated fatty acids. Together they form phospholipids for membrane
  formation and promote tumor growth. EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling also activates SREBP-1,
  which upregulates ACC, FAS and SCD1, to promote de novo fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore,
  glutamine enters into the TCA cycle to generate energy and also can be converted
  to lipids through reductive carboxylation under hypoxic conditions. GLUT, glucose
  transporter; HK2, hexokinase 2; PFK, phosphofructokinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGAM, phosphoglycerate mutase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvic

  TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle; ACLY, ATP citrate lyase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
