caption: Results of matching compounds and enzymes to the KEGG module database. We
  found three of the four compounds and at least one subunit from each of the enzymes
  involved in the GABA shunt pathway (A; https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_module?M00027)
  as well as many of the enzymes and molecules involved in different pathways of methanogenesis
  (B–D) including methylotrophic methanogenesis (https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_module?M00356),
  acetoclastic methanogenesis (https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_module?M00357),
  and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_module?M00567).
  Filled ovals indicate compounds that were identified in our dataset by NMR or GC-MS;
  hatched pattern ovals indicate compounds for which a consistent m/z was found in
  the FTICR-MS data. Although not quantified by other techniques, the presence of
  acetate was inferred from low alphaC values in the surface consistent with acetoclastic
  methanogenesis indicating that acetate was present as a substrate. Filled arrows
  indicate the enzyme catalyzing that step was found in the proteomics dataset, while
  open arrows indicate the enzyme was not found.
