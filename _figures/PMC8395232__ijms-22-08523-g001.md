caption: 'mtDNA-activated immune pathways. Under mitochondrial insults (oxidative
  stress, infections, etc.) or mitochondrial quality control impairment, mtDNA is
  released to the cytosol where it engages different receptors, activating inflammatory
  and innate immune signaling pathways. From the left: Oxidized mtDNA stimulates inflammasome
  activity leading to caspase-1-mediated maturation of pro-inflammatory IL-1β and
  IL18; mtDNA activates the cGAS–STING pathway triggering interferon response via
  IRF3 and NF-κB; TLR9 recognizes mtDNA, resulting in activation of NF-κB or MAPK
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. mtDNA also promotes non-apoptotic cell
  death trough TLR9/IFN-β signaling. Genotoxic stress and DNA repair response are
  also mediated by cytosolic mtDNA.'
