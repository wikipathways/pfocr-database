caption: 'A: Blockade of KCNN4 by Clt (red X) accelerates wound healing at least in
  part by transactivation of the PI3K pathway (red arrows). Additional EGF (blue)
  meets activated downstream signaling and exerts no additional effect (blue arrows).
  B: IFN-γ preincubation uncouples the postulated transactivation of PI3K signaling
  by KCNN4 inhibition (orange line) leading to reduced migration upon KCNN4 blockade
  by Clt (red X). In this constellation EGF (blue) may activate downstream targets
  and enhance migration (blue arrows).'
