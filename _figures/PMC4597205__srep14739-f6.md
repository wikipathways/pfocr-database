caption: 'Ceramide directly or indirectly targets mitochondria, leading to the release
  of apoptotic proteins, such as cytochrome C, and activates caspases. However, if
  the PI3K/AKT pathway is activated by an inflammatory stimulus or other growth factors,
  it can preserve the integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane by activating
  the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family of proteins, such as BCL-2 or BCL-xL, by inhibiting
  PP2A or BAD. Therefore, ceramide and PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors exert a synergistic
  cytotoxic effect on cancer cells. Note: the arrows in this simplified scheme are
  not intended to indicate direct physiological interactions.'
