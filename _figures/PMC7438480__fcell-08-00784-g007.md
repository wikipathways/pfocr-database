caption: Molecular mechanisms by which CypA and CD147 contribute to NASH progression.
  Under MCD diet feeding, damaged hepatocytes release CypA, and CD147 expression is
  enhanced. The formation of the CypA/CD147 complex results in an inflammatory response
  through the NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.
