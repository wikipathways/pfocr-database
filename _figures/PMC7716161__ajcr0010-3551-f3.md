caption: Schematic diagram of the role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of acinar duct
  metaplasia, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and pancreatic cancer. IL-17A
  stimulates REG_3β that is a pancreatitis mediator in pancreatic epithelial cells
  to promote acinar-ductal metaplasia and the progression of Pan IN. By increasing
  the expression of DCLK1, IL-17A can also regulate the stem cell characteristics
  of pancreatic intraepithelial tumor cells. The elevated IL-17A in the pancreatic
  tumor microenvironment recruit neutrophils by releasing specific cytokines and chemokines,
  exclude cytotoxic CD8+ T cells from the tumor, thus maintaining an immunosuppressive
  microenvironment. IL-17B recruits neutrophils, lymphocytes by activating the ERK1/2
  signaling pathway, ultimately promoting the invasion and metastasis of pancreatic
  cancer. In contrast, IL-17E plays an anti-tumor effect by activating B lymphocytes
  in pancreatic cancer. ADM, Acinar duct metaplasia; Pan IN, Pancreatic intraepithelial
  neoplasia; Th17, T helper cell 17.
