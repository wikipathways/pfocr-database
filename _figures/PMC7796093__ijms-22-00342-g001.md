caption: 'A brief illustration of respiration and photosynthesis sharing their metabolisms
  and electron transport chains in one cyanobacterial cell. To simplify the illustration,
  stoichiometry of each reaction and many bypasses are disregarded here. The direction
  of the arrows mainly follows the respiration mode. Under light conditions, photosynthetic
  electron transport proceeds from PSII to PSI, and Rubisco assimilates CO2 to initiate
  the reductive pentose phosphate pathway (also called the Calvin–Benson cycle). Conversely,
  the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway proceeds in sugar catabolism, producing
  reducing power as NADPH. Abbreviations for enzymes and the complexes are as follows:
  Rubisco, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; NDH-1 and -2, type I and
  II NAD(P)H dehydrogenase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; PSII and PSI, photosystem
  II and I; PQ, plastoquinone; Cyt b6f, cytochrome b6f complex; PC, plastocyanin;
  Cyt c, cytochrome c; Cyd, cytochrome bd-type quinol oxidase; COX, cytochrome c oxidase;
  ATPase, ATP synthase; ARTO, alternative respiratory terminal oxidase.'
