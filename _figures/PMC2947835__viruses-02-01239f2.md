caption: Membrane proximal intracellular signals at the IS versus the HIV VS. The
  interaction of TCR with its cognate pMHC complex triggers intracellular signaling
  events that lead to full T cell activation. The TCR proximal signals known to be
  activated at the IS are shown in the left diagram. Upon TCR engagement, Lck is activated
  and phosphorylates the TCR ITAMs. ZAP-70 is then recruited to the TCR ITAMs and
  phosphorylates LAT and SLP76. SLP76 subsequently recruits PLCγ-1 and other signaling
  molecules including Itk, Grb2, GADS, Nck and Vav. PLCγ-1 cleaves PIP2 to IP3 and
  DAG; IP3 triggers calcium influx while DAG activates PKCθ and the MAPK/Erk pathway.
  The signaling propagates downwards to activate transcriptions factors that alter
  gene transcription such as NF-κB and NFAT. The interaction of CD4 T cells with HIV-1
  gp120 also triggers activation of some components of the TCR signaling machinery.
  The membrane proximal signals currently known to be activated at the VS in the planar
  bilayer experiments are shown in the right diagram.
