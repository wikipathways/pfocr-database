caption: Phylogenetic distribution of the PlsB/PlsC and PlsX/PlsY/PlsC acyltransferase
  systems in bacteria. Bacterial groups that contain only the PlsB/PlsC pathway to
  phosphatidic acid are shown in blue, those that have only the PlsX/PlsY/PlsC pathway
  are shown in yellow, and those that contain members that have both pathways are
  shown in both colors.
