caption: Schematic model showing the regulatory role of PBM on M1 macrophages and
  its possible molecular mechanisms. Macrophages in the resting state become activated
  and are involved in neuroinflammation after spinal cord injury. Activated neurotoxic
  macrophages have damaging effects on neurons by secreting cytotoxic cytokines. The
  Notch1 and HIF-1α/p-NF-κB axis are involved in macrophage activation. Specifically,
  the Notch1 pathway is involved in the activation of neurotoxic macrophages and the
  expression of HIF-1α and p-NF-κB. The neuroprotective mechanism of PBM may be related
  to its inhibition of the Notch1-HIF-1α/p-NF-κB axis, which is associated with the
  activation of neurotoxic macrophage cells.
