caption: Working model of our current understanding of the mechanisms by which MBOAT7
  loss of function promotes liver disease progression. Either the common rs641738
  (C>T) SNP or obesity/hyperinsulinemia can reduce the levels of MBOAT7 expression
  and enzymatic activity. When MBOAT7 function is suppressed, there is abnormal storage
  of triacylglycerol (TAG) in the liver (i.e., hepatic steatosis) via 1) activation
  of the SCAP-SREBP-1c pathway to promote canonical de novo lipogenesis; 2) () activation
  of noncanonical pathway of lipid synthesis via upregulation of CDS2 (), or 3) the
  fatty acid transporter FATP1 is overexpressed facilitating lipid deposition ().
  In addition, the accumulation of MBOAT7 substrate LPIs can promote steatosis (,
  ) and proinflammatory and profibrotic signaling under conditions where MBOAT7 function
  is diminished (). Collectively, when MBOAT7 function is diminished, there is an
  imbalance in both the substrates (LPIs, fatty acyl-CoAs, or free fatty acids) and
  products (38:3, 38:4, and 38:5 PI and phosphorylated versions of these PI lipids)
  of the MBOAT7 reaction, which likely work in concert in the liver to promote the
  progression of liver disease from hepatic steatosis toward inflammation and fibrosis.
