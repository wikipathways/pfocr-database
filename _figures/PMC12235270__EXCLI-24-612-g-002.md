caption: illustrates the Hippo signaling pathway in its "OFF" and "ON" states, highlighting
  its role in regulating cell growth and proliferation. In the Hippo OFF state, the
  kinase cascade involving MST1/2 and LATS1/2 is inactive, allowing YAP1/TAZ to translocate
  into the nucleus and associate with TEAD transcription factors, thereby promoting
  transcription of genes involved in growth and proliferation. Conversely, in the
  Hippo ON state, MST1/2, with the assistance of SAV1, activates LATS1/2 in a complex
  with MOB1. This leads to the phosphorylation of YAP1/TAZ, creating a binding site
  for the 14-3-3 protein, which sequesters YAP1/TAZ in the cytoplasm and promotes
  their degradation. As a result, YAP1/TAZ is prevented from entering the nucleus,
  inhibiting TEAD-mediated transcription and suppressing growth and proliferation.
