caption: Suggested mechanisms of Bisphenol A impairing decidualization. Exposure to
  BPA leads to downregulation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and
  cP450 expression in theca and granulosa cells. This downregulation hinders the transport
  of cholesterol into the mitochondria for conversion into pregnenolone, thereby disrupting
  the E2 biosynthetic pathway and impairing the normal function of the HPG axis
