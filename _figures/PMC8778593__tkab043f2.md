caption: The role of exosomes in radiation-induced skin damage. Mmu-miR-291a-3p derived
  from ESCs can restrain cell senescence through the TGF-βR2 signalling pathway and
  accelerate the healing process of skin incisions in elderly mice. MSC- exosomal
  miR-135a increases epithelial cell migration by inhibiting the expression of the
  gene encoding LATS2 during skin wound healing. MSC-exosomal miR-126 can activate
  PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways and promote the skin healing process. MSC-exosomal miR-146
  up-regulates the expression of M2- related genes (such as TRAF6 and IRAK1) by targeting
  NF-κB signals, and miR-34 targets Notch1 to inhibit transcriptional pro-inflammatory
  cytokines encoding M1-related genes, such as IL-6 and TNF-α. Plasma-derived exosomes
  can promote wound healing by enhancing the expression of radiation resistance-related
  genes and regulating cell proliferation and ferroptosis of fibroblasts after radiation.
  In nude mice with ultraviolet B-induced skin photoaging, the exosomes derived from
  HDF have anti-skin senescence properties by down-regulating TNF-α and up-regulating
  TGF-β, causing the expression of type I procollagen to increase and the expression
  of MMP-1 to decrease observably. In a photoaging skin model of rats induced by ultraviolet
  B radiation, exosomes from adipose-derived stem cells increased the expression of
  type I collagen mRNA and decreased mRNA expression, including type III collagen,
  MMP-1 and MMP-3, thus significantly improving the photoinjury of skin. Irradiated
  HaCaT keratinocytes secrete exosomal miR-27a, which up-regulates the expression
  of miR-27a in bystander WS1 fibroblasts, resulting in decreased MMP-2 expression,
  which delays cell migration and increases ROS level, resulting in prolonged wound
  healing time. ESC embryonic stem cells, TGF-βR2 transforming growth factor-beta
