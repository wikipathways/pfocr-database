caption: 'Inactivating gene fusions of NF1 in lung cancer. A, NF1 protein schematic
  and the observed fusion breaks (red arrows) in the index cases are displayed on
  top. Recurrent NF1 fusions with partners (GOSR1, PSMD11, NLK, DRG2 and MYO15A antisense)
  resulted in loss of the NF1 gene as illustrated by the corresponding fusion protein
  structure below. Index samples are indicated in parenthesis and the numbers over
  the protein schematic indicate total amino acids. Red # symbol indicate protein
  truncation due to out-of-frame ORFs from fusion transcript analysis. B, UCSC browser
  view of genomic location of NF1 gene and its fusion partners (Top). Schematic representation
  of various NF1 rearrangements on chromosome 17 identified in lung cancer (Bottom).'
