caption: Most cells are protected from TNF-mediated cell death due to the presence
  two sequential cell death checkpoints that are turned on upon initiation of signaling
  from TNFR1. The early checkpoint is initiated by the ubiquitylation of RIPK1 by
  the TRAF2-cIAP1/2 and LUBAC E3 ligases. This process does not require gene transcription
  and occurs within seconds after ligand binding. Ubiquitylation of RIPK1 functions
  as a scaffold to recruit the TAB2/3-TAK1 and NEMO-IKKα/β kinase complexes to activate
  the latter. Within a few minutes after stimulation, NEMO-IKKα/β then phosphorylates
  RIPK1, which prevents RIPK1 from associating with and activating downstream death-signaling
  molecules. Under these conditions, RIPK1 functions in a survival-signaling mode.
  Active NEMO-IKKα/β also leads to the late checkpoint by phosphorylating IκBα, resulting
  in its degradation and induction of NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. The late
  checkpoint is dependent on the NF-κB-mediated induction of pro-survival genes, which
  occurs within an hour after stimulation and serves to reinforce the early checkpoint
  and to inhibit the formation of death-signaling complexes. Since NF-κB also induces
  a number of pro-inflammatory genes, this leads to an inflammatory response.
