caption: (Apoptosis) SeV, VSV, EMCV, and AdV activate a RIG-I-dependent signaling
  cascade resulting in cleavage of caspase-3 and cell death. In contrast, HSV-1 initiates
  apoptosis through a parallel pathway involving cGAS and STING. TNFR, TLR3/TRIF,
  and DAI signal through distinct signaling complexes that activate caspase-8. The
  initial DAI-dependent response requires RIPK3, but RIPK3-independent apoptosis is
  observed at later times post-receptor engagement. (Necroptosis). TNFR and TLR3/TRIF
  initiate necroptosis through RIPK1/RIPK3 and RIPK3, respectively. MCMV and IAV activate
  DAI-dependent necroptosis via RIPK3. Reovirus is sensed by an unknown IFN-inducible
  factor, which activates RIPK3. HSV-1 ICP6 and HSV-2 ICP10 proteins induce necroptosis
  by binding to RIPK1/RIPK3. SeV (Sendai virus), VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus),
  ECMV (encephalomyocarditis virus) HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus 1), MCMV (murine cytomegalovirus),
  IV (influenza virus), Reovirus (respiratory enteric orphan virus), VV (vaccinia
  virus).
