caption: 'ROS and NO signaling pathways during hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced production
  of ROS and NO occurs at several sites within the cell. Mitochondrial dysfunction
  during hypoxia generates ROS and can be pharmacologically mimicked by AA. The mitochondrial
  MnSOD mediates  conversion to H2O2. Apoplastic ROS generation can be attributed
  to membrane-bound NADPH oxidases (RBOHD). RBOHD-mediated ROS production is modulated
  by HRU. HRU proteins exist as dimers in the cytosol and regulate ROS production
  via association with RBOHD in a protein complex including ROP-GTP. ROS production
  via RBOHD is tightly regulated via several PTMs. This includes: ROS-mediated PTM;
  NO-mediated S-nitrosylation; Phosphorylation by CDPKs. CDPKs are activated by hypoxia-mediated
  Ca2+ influxes. RBOHD can be synergistically activated via Ca2+ binding and CDPK-dependent
  phosphorylation. Cellular NO production during hypoxia can occur via reductive pathways.
  This includes cytosolic NRs, which generate NO from , and the Mt-NiR. Cellular NO
  levels are regulated primarily via removal by PGBs in a series of reactions known
  as the PGB–NO cycle. NO and ROS can affect hypoxia responses by influencing the
  stability of the oxygen labile group VII-ERF TFs. Under normoxic conditions, ERF-VIIs
  are either degraded via the N-degron pathway, or sequestered via association with
  Acyl-CoA-binding proteins. Hypoxia triggers ERFVII release and nuclear translocation
  to activate target gene (RBOHD, HRU, and PGB1) expression. NO and ROS could also
  influence hypoxia responses by regulating MPK activity. In Arabidopsis, MPK3/6 mediates
  hypoxia survival by an unknown mechanism. Their activation is triggered by mitochondrial
  stress signals, potentially either H2O2 or peroxynitrate (ONOO−) H2O2 could also
  regulate MPKs indirectly via Sucrose nonfermenting1 related Kinase (SnRK1) and a
  PTP. SnRK1 phosphorylates and activates MPK6, but SnRK1 activity is impaired by
  oxidative stress. PTP1 inhibits MPK3/6 but is itself inactivated by SnRK1 and also
  H2O2. The reaction of NO with GSH results in GSNO representing an important cellular
  storage form of NO. GSNO levels in turn are dependent on GSNOR activity. Figure
