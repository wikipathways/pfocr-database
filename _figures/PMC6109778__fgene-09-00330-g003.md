caption: Simplified ketone body metabolic pathway. Key enzymes were based on the encoding
  genes which were present in both AUS and NZ () metabolism gene networks. These presented
  genes were indicated by red text. Dashed arrow represents a hypothesized contribution
  of ACSF2 to butyryl-CoA synthesis.
