caption: Schematic overview of plant immune strategies against geminiviruses. Geminivirus
  infection initiates with the release of viral ssDNA into the nucleus, subsequently
  leads to the replication, transcription and translation of viral genome. (A) Plants
  counteract geminivirus genetic life cycle via multiple host factors. GRAB interacts
  with RepA and interferes with the replication. RPT4a and EML1 hamper the geminivirus
  active transcription by obstructing the RNA Pol-II on virus euchromatin. Additionally,
  host induces RNAi via TGS and PTGS to suppress the viral gene expression. Virus-encoded
  VSRs potentially suppresses the RNAi. (B) Geminivirus induced GRIK1 autophosphorylates
  and activates SnRK1 which interact and phosphorylates the viral Rep, TrAP (AL2/C2)
  and βC1 protein. Phosphorylation of Rep and TrAP impedes Rep binding and causes
  a delay in the infection, respectively. βC1 phosphorylation hampers the TGS and
  PTGS suppressor functionalities and attenuates symptom expression via suppression
  of AS1-βC1 mediated downstream responses. Phosphorylated βC1 may also direct to
  autophagy. (C) Tobacco RFP1 interacts with βC1 and prompts the βC1 degradation via
  ubiquitin-mediated 26S proteasomal pathway and causes the symptom attenuation. (D)
  ATG8h interacts with nuclear C1 and translocate to cytosol XpoI dependent manner.
  The ATG8h-C1 complex is then recruited into autophagosomes with the aid of ATG5
  and ATG7 for vacuolar degradation. (E) Defence regulated MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 module
  induced, activated by geminivirus infection and exerts the basal defence response.
  However, βC1 protein directly interacts with MKK2 and MPK4, thereby suppress the
  broad spectrum of downstream defence reactions. (F) NIK-1 from plasma membrane activated
  upon the geminivirus infection triggers dimerization and autophosphorylation. Alternatively,
  PTI induced DAMPs secreted from ER in response to virus attack may cause NIK-1 activation.
  Active NIK-1 phosphorylates and translocate L10 into the nucleus where it binds
  to LIMYB to block the transcription of ribosomal biosynthesis genes which affects
  the global translation and prevents the translation of viral genes
