caption: 'A simplified scheme of the AM fungal metabolic pathways revealed active
  in the present study. Labeled substrates provided in different experiments are shown
  in boxes, products detected are shown in capital letters, and certain metabolic
  intermediates or pools whose presence is inferred but were not detected are shown
  in italics. 1, Trehalose synthesis from Glc phosphate and UDP-Glc; 2, trehalose
  breakdown by trehalase; 3, the PPP (also known as the hexose monophosphate pathway);
  4, gluconeogenesis, starting with PEP and involving reversal of glycolysis with
  several differences; 5, glycolysis (the Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway); 6, non-photosynthetic
  one-carbon metabolism, typically involving tetrahydrofolate (THF) and S-adenosyl
  Met as carriers of the methyl groups; 7, lipolysis: storage lipid (tryacylglycerides)
  breakdown to glycerol and fatty acids, and subsequent glyoxysomal fatty acid β-oxidation
  to acetyl CoA; 8, Dark fixation of CO2 by pyruvate carboxylase to oxalocetate (8a)
  or carbamoyl P synthethase (8d); 9, glyoxylate cycle (or shunt) involving the production
  of glyoxylate from acetyl-CoA units via part of the TCA cycle; the glyoxylate is
  condensed with acetyl-CoA (from triacylglyceride degradation) to form triose and
  CO2; 10, TCA (also known as the Krebs cycle); 11, Arg synthesis by enzymes of the
  urea cycle including the incorporation of carbon from carbamoyl P.'
