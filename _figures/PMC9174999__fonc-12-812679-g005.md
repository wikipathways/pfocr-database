caption: The probiotics play essential roles in host metabolism, immune modulation,
  and colonization resistance to pathogens, suppressing the CRC progression. On the
  one hand, there were studies demonstrating that probiotics can prevent the attachment
  of pathogenic bacteria to gut epithelia. On the other hand, short-chain fatty acids
  (SCFAs), mainly acetate, butyrate, and propionate, are major metabolic products
  of probiotics, promoting probiotics growth and reproduction, protecting the intestinal
  barrier function. Probiotics may represses toxic bacterial metabolites by indirectly
  inhibiting the growth of pathogens. Toxic bacterial metabolites can induce DNA damage
  in epithelial cells; indirectly impaired barrier function was among the constellation
  of accepted pathologies in CRC and generated local or chronic inflammation by producing
  inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF). In addition, pathogenic bacteria may also exert
  pro-inflammatory effects via microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs)
  by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which lead to detection by dendritic cells (DC) as
  well as activation of Th-17 cells, and the latter will promote the expression of
  the pro-inflammatory mediator IL-23 and block the expression of the anti-inflammatory
  mediator IL-10. However, probiotics also bound the Toll-like receptor (TLR), which
  activated the TLR–NF-kB signal transduction pathway to inhibit the inflammatory
  effects.
