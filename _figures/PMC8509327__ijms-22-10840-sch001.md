caption: Schematic representation of (a) the inactive Wnt signalling pathway, (b)
  activated canonical Wnt signalling pathway and (c) non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+signalling
  pathway. (a) In the absence of a Wnt ligand, the canonical Wnt signalling pathway
  is inactive, and β-catenin is degraded by a multiprotein complex termed axin degradosome.
  Degradosome is composed of scaffold proteins adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and
  axin and kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and casein kinase 1 (CK1). The
  two kinases phosphorylate β-catenin and release it into the cytosol, where it is
  ubiquitinated and degraded by a proteasome complex. (b) Canonical Wnt signal transduction
  is initiated by the binding of Wnt ligand (WNT) to membrane frizzled (Fzd) receptor
  and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) co-receptor. Fzd
  and LRP5/6 undergo dimerization and conformational changes, which recruit dishevelled
  (DVL) and degradosome to the membrane and trigger the assembly of a multiprotein
  complex termed signalosome. Inhibition of kinases releases β-catenin from the complex
  and enables its accumulation in the cytosol and translocation to the nucleus. In
  the nucleus, β-catenin incorporates into a multiprotein complex termed enhanceosome,
  composed of Pygopus (PYGO), ChiLs complex, adaptor protein B-cell lymphoma 9 (BCL9)
  and BAF (Brg/Brahma-associated factors) chromatin-remodelling complex. The main
  proteins of enhanceosome are transcriptional co-repressors TLE (transducin-like
  enhancer of split) and T cell factor (TCF) family of DNA-bound transcription factors,
  which mediate transcription of β-catenin dependent genes through changes in histone
  acetylation and chromatin condensation. (c) Non-canonical Wnt signalling is activated
  by binding a non-canonical Wnt ligand to Fzd receptor and Receptor tyrosine kinase-like
  orphan receptor 2 (ROR2). Receptor dimerization recruits DVL to the membrane and
  activates heterotrimeric G-proteins, which in turn activate phospholipase C (PLC).
  The PLC cleaves the membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  into inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2 diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces
  the release of Ca2+ from intracellular calcium stores and activation of calcium-sensitive
  enzymes, such as protein kinase C (PKC), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
  (CaMKII) and calcineurin. These activated proteins, in turn, activate several transcription
  factors, such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), cAMP-responsive element-binding protein
  (CREB) and nuclear factor associated with T cells (NFAT).
