caption: Proposed glucomannan and starch biosynthesis pathway in the A. konjac corm
  based on the established EST database. Presented is the nucleotide sugar interconversion
  pathway from sucrose to GDP-mannose and GDP-glucose, the two building blocks of
  glucomannan as well as the starch biosynthesis pathway. The necessary converting
  enzymes found in the EST data are given in red with the number of obtained reads
  in green. The thickness of the arrows is representative for the number of reads.
  The highest number of ESTs for this pathway was found to be from CSLA3—a putative
  glucomannan synthase. UDP-Glc UDP-d-glucose, Glc-1-P glucose-1-phosphate, Glc-6-P
  glucose-6-phosphate, Fruc-6-P fructose-6-phosphate, Man-6-P mannose-6-phosphate,
  Man-1-P mannose-1-phosphate, GDP-Man GDP-d-mannose, GDP-Glc GDP-d-glucose, ADP-Glc
