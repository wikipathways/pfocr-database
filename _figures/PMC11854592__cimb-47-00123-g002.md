caption: Role of the EpCAM signaling pathway in cancer progression. EpCAM undergoes
  sequential proteolytic processing on CSC membranes. ADAM17 and γ-secretase mediate
  this cleavage, releasing the extracellular domain (EpEX) and intracellular domain
  (EpICD). While the proteasome degrades most EpICD, a portion translocates to the
  nucleus where it forms a transcriptional complex with FHL2, LEF1, and β-catenin.
  The EpEX contains an EGF-like region that interacts with EGFR, triggering EGFR-ERK
  pathway activation. Concurrent activation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling leads to cytoplasmic
  β-catenin accumulation. FHL2 facilitates the nuclear translocation of both EpICD
  and β-catenin, where they form a transcriptional complex that regulates EpCAM target
  genes. Through these molecular mechanisms, EpCAM emerges as a central regulator
  of CSC in tumor progression such as proliferation, metastatic potential, and chemoresistance
