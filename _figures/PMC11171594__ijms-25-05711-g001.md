caption: TLR-mediated signaling. Activation of TLRs can induce different signaling
  pathways. The most common signaling pathway induced by TLRs is the MyD88-dependent
  pathway (a). Although TLR10 has been shown to interact with MyD88, the complete
  signaling pathway has not been demonstrated experimentally. The MyD88-independent
  pathway is induced only by the activation of TLR4 and TLR3 (b). The signaling cascade
  culminates with the activation of transcription factors that, in turn, induce the
  expression of genes involved in various processes, including the immune response.
