caption: Schematic representation of the CS response. The classical pathway is triggered
  by binding of C1 to an Ag–Ab complex, whereas the lectin pathway is triggered by
  binding of MBLs to specific carbohydrate structures on pathogens (PAMP). Initiation
  of both these pathways leads to the hydrolysis of C2 and C4 generating C2a and C4b
  which form the classical and lectin pathway C3 convertase C4bC2a. Uniquely, the
  AP is triggered by the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3, a zymogen present at high concentrations
  in serum. The resulting C3(HO) binds factor B (FB), and the resulting pro-convertase
  complex is activated by factor D (FD) to yield the C3 convertase C3bBb. These initial
  C3 convertases further activate AP, which then leads to amplification by the AP.
  The terminal pathway is then activated, which leads to cleavage of C5 and MAC formation.
  The end-effects of CS activation are inflammation (via AP and terminal pathway),
  pathogen and cell lysis (by MACs) and opsonization (i.e. marking of pathogen surfaces
  for clearance, by-products of classical pathway, lectin pathway and AP activation)
