caption: A. The link between air pollution, homocysteine, micronutrient deficiencies
  and global DNA methylation. Air pollution as well as micronutrient (folate and vitamin
  B12) deficiencies lead to increase in homocysteine levels and further cause global
  DNA methylation. Both folate and vitamin B12 seem to play differential role in the
  causation of global DNA hypomethylation in the present study. B. The proposed mechanisms
  for global DNA hypomethylation due to air pollution could be through the key precursor
  homocysteine. The inhalation of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10) triggers local inflammation
  (in lung epithelia) and systemic inflammation (in blood). This leads to increase
  in proinflammation due to release of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 etc.) thereby
  increasing oxidative stress. Oxidative stress and homocysteine have a cause-effect
  relation and it results into increased homocysteine. On the other hand, continuous
  inflammatory state leads to an increased folate demand, which when not compensated
  through dietary supply leads to homocysteine increase. Dietary deficiency of vitamin
  B12 also leads to homocysteine increase due to disturbances in one-carbon metabolic
  pathway. Air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10) also lead to inactivation of homocysteine
  remethylation enzyme (methionine synthase) due to which conversion of methionine
  is blocked and ultimately leads to increased homocysteine. Increased homocysteine
  alters the plasticity of genomic DNA methylation and leads to genomic instability
  and accumulation of mutations. This further makes an individual prone to other metabolic
  disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, neurological problems.
