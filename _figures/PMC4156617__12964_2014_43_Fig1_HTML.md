caption: Updated working model for the AR showing a bifurcated signaling pathway downstream
  of cAMP/Epac. Calcium enters the cell from the extracellular milieu through the
  SLO-generated pores and activates sAC. Calcium also stimulates, directly or indirectly,
  the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab27. Cyclic AMP synthesized by sAC activates Epac
  and here the signaling pathway splits into two limbs. In one of them, Epac catalyzes
  the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rap; in the other, cAMP/Epac indirectly activates
  Rab3. Rap-GTP heads a pathway that leads to acrosomal calcium mobilization (“calcium
  efflux” in the Figure). Rab3-GTP heads a pathway that leads to the correct assembly
  of the fusion machinery (“fusion competent SNAREs” in the Figure). Somewhere downstream
  of Rab3-GTP, there is a unidirectional (Rab3 limb → Rap1 limb) connection between
  both arms of the pathway. After this point, PTP1B is activated and/or recruited
  to the sites where it dephosphorylates NSF, derepressing its activity. Next, active,
  dephospho-NSF, in a complex with α-SNAP, renders SNARE proteins fusion competent.
  The step catalyzed by active SNAREs converges with the local increase in calcium
  coming from the acrosome downstream of Rap-GTP to accomplish the final steps of
  membrane fusion (“AR” in the Figure). Reversible and irreversible AR blockers used
  in this manuscript are shown in light gray. Adenophostin A (red) binds IP3-sensitive
  channels and mobilizes acrosomal calcium pharmacologically. PM, plasma membrane;
  OAM, outer acrosomal membrane. Solid arrows mean there is one step between the terms
  connected, dashed arrows mean that the number of steps is either unknown or not
  depicted for simplicity. Modified from [].
