caption: Biosynthetic pathway of A2E. All-trans-retinal generated by light-mediated
  isomerization of 11-cis-retinal reacts with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to generate
  the Schiff base adduct N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (NRPE). After [1,6]-proton
  tautomerization, reaction with a second molecule of all-trans-retinal and 6π-electrocyclization,
  a phosphatidyl-dihydropyridinium bisretinoid (dihydropyridinium-A2PE) is formed.
  Dihydropyridinium-A2PE would undergo a 1,3-H shift and hydrogen atom elimination
  to give rise to A2-DHP-PE or eliminate two hydrogens to form A2PE, a phosphatidyl-pyridinium
  bisretinoid. Following aromatic autooxidation, A2PE is generated. Hydrolysis of
  the phosphate ester of A2PE by phospholipase D yields A2PE. Under room light, A2E
  and isoA2E reach photoequilibrium at a ratio of 4:1.
