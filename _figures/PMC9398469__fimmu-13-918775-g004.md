caption: The Thrombin-Complement Web. Although the conditions under which this pathway
  exists in vivo remain to be shown, thrombin (IIa), in combination with the bona
  fide C5 convertase (not shown), cleaves C5 to C5bT and C5a, which promote assembly
  of the MAC and an anaphylactic response, respectively. The MAC may induce the generation
  of extracellular vesicles, a well-documented source of TF. Thrombin also cleaves
  C3 to generate anaphylatoxin C3a. Via PARs 1, 3 and 4, thrombin triggers modulation
  of many cell types. In particular, P-selectin (P-Sel) can associate with C3b to
  upregulate the AP. Stimulation through PARs also facilitates expression of TF activity
  to further the thrombin-mediated effects on complement.
