caption: Signaling pathway of ethanol-mediated changes in PKCε activities (expression
  and translocation). Interaction of ethanol with GPCR results in generation of second
  messengers such as DAG and IP3. Long-term ethanol consumption upregulates cellular
  levels of basal PKCε and upstream kinases such as PI3K and mTORC2 which collectively
  increases phosohorylation of PKCε at S729. In DAG-dependent pathway, binding of
  DAG and RACK to mature PKCε translocates the kinase to distinct subcellular target
  sites to mediate downstream signaling pathways. In DAG-independent pathway, increase
  in DAG kinase activities causes generation of PA which could affect PKCε translocation
  via novel pathways. Once translocated, PKCε could affect downstream signaling through
  phosphorylation of numerous molecular targets which include GABAA, N-ethylmaleimide
  sensitif factor and mGlu5 which influence binge ethanol consumption. PKCε also causes
  internalization of mGlu5 surface receptors that could potentially reduce mGlu5 availability
  during abstinence.
