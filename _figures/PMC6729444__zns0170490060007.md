caption: 'Schematic illustration of p35/Cdk5 involvement in RasGRF2 signaling. In
  this figure, we summarize our findings that p35/Cdk5 mediates RasGRF2 signaling
  to the membrane-bound GTPase Rac. Rac is involved in actin dynamics as well as the
  modulation of ERK1/2 activity. Under normal circumstances, RasGRF2 mediates the
  transition of inactive GDP-bound Rac to an active, GTP-bound form. This active form
  of Rac then participates in actin polymerization and dynamics as well as activating
  ERK1/2 through as yet undetermined intermediary steps. p35/Cdk5 phosphorylates RasGRF2
  on serine737, downregulating the transition of inactive to active Rac (solid, lighter-shade
  arrows). Subsequently, the levels of activated ERK1/2 are also decreased. The role
  of p35/Cdk5 is particularly specific for this pathway: it does not affect Ras activity
  or Rac-mediated actin dynamics. The solid black arrow shows p35/Cdk5 involvement
  in the ERK1/2 pathway, which has been described previously. (). Thus, p35/Cdk5 is
  involved at the upstream level of Rac signaling and also at the MEK1 level of the
  ERK1/2. This cross-talk and ultimate alteration of ERK1/2 activity may be important
  in maintaining distinct regulation of the ERK1/2 signaling cascade and the distribution
  of MAP1b under normal physiological conditions. Our results show p35/Cdk5 phosphorylation
  of RasGRF2, mediating ERK1/2 activity through Rac, leading to MAP1b distribution
  in neurons. This suggests that the phosphorylation state of MAP1b is important in
  its distribution along the processes of the neurons as well as its localization
  within the neuronal cell body. All effects attributed to p35/Cdk5 phosphorylation
  of RasGRF2, subsequent modulation of Rac and ERK1/2 activity, and MAP1b distribution
  are indicated by the solid, lighter-shade arrows.'
