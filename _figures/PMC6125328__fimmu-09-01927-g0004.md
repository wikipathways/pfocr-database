caption: CARMA/CARD-dependent and-independent MALT1 activation. (A) In the depicted
  T cell malignancies, gain-of-function mutations in CARMA1 or its upstream regulators
  or in-frame gene fusions of the T-cell co-receptor CD28 with ICOS or CTLA-4 are
  thought to promote MALT1 constitutive activation. (B) In the indicated B-cell lymphomas
  constitutive MALT1 protease activity can be driven by oncogenic mutations in CARMA1,
  CD79A or CD79B, which may be relevant in combination with self-antigen recognition.
  A subset of MCL and CLL are also addicted to this pathway by unknown mechanisms.
  (C) A large proportion of MALT lymphoma harbors a chromosomal translocation leading
  to formation of an oncogenic MALT1-API2 fusion protein. (D) In primary effusion
  lymphoma (PEL), NF-κB is activated through viral latency proteins such as K13 and
  K15, which activate NF-κB directly or via MALT1-BCL10. (A,B), mutations and self-antigen
  are depicted with a yellow star. (A,D) Open questions are depicted with red question
  marks. PTCL, peripheral T-cell lymphoma; ATLL adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma; ABC,
  activated B-cell subtype; DLBCL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; BENTA, B-cell expansion
  with NF-κB and T-cell anergy; MCL, mantle cell lymphoma; CLL, chronic lymphocytic/leukemia.
