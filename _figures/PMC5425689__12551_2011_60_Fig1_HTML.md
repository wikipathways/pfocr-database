caption: Model for the activity-dependent control of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) regulated
  neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) signaling and function. nNOSμ localizes to
  the dystrophin glycoprotein complex by binding a-syntrophin (a-syn), where it opposes
  blood vessel constriction during exercise. The spliced nNOS isoforms nNOSμ and nNOSβ
  (?) may regulate muscle fatigue and exercise performance by promoting normal ryanodine
  receptor 1 (RyR1) activity. SNO represents S-nitrosylation of regulatory cysteine
  thiols. RyR1 releases Ca2+ into the cytosol during contraction, while a sarcoplasmic
  reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pumps Ca2+ from the cytosol back into the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum (SR). 1 nNOSμ signaling is increased by endurance type exercise. 2 Prolonged
  inactivity leads to dissociation of nNOSμ from the sarcolemma inducing atrophy through
  a forkhead transcription factor (FoxO) mediated pathway. 3 In Duchenne muscular
  dystrophy, loss of dystrophin destabilizes the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC),
  and impairs the vasoregulatory function of nNOSμ, leading to RyR1 destabilization,
  pathogenic nNOSμ-mediated RyR1 hypernitrosylation and Ca2+ leak. 4 RyR1 Ca2+ leak
  can lead to muscle damage, weakness, and fatigue. RyR1 Ca2+ leak can further inappropriately
  activate nNOSμ, leading to further RyR1 nitrosylation and progressively more damaging
  Ca2+ leakage in a severely detrimental feed-forward loop
