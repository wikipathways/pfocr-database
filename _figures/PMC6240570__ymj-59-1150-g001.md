caption: '. Three signal pathways contribute to stemness properties of gastric cancer
  stem-like cells: Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway, Notch signal pathway, and Hedgehog
  signal pathway. (A) Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway: Wnt binds to its receptor-Frizzled
  to activate Dsh protein. The activated Dsh protein enhances the phosphorylation
  of GSK3β (a component of the cytoplasmic complex that promotes phosphorylation of
  β-catenin and its degradation), which inhibits the ability of GSK3β, further causing
  the accumulation of free and unphosphorylated β-catenin in the cytoplasm that is
  then translocated to the nucleus. In the nucleus, β-catenin binds to TCF/LEF to
  promote downstream target genes expression. (B) Notch signal pathway: Ligand binding-induced
  Notch activation causes γ-secretase (including Presenilin and Nicastrin) to cleave
  Notch COOH-terminal fragment to release NICD into the cytoplasm. Then, NICD translocates
  to the nucleus to interact with SKIP and CSL, which lead to SMRT/HDACs dissociation,
  further converting CSL to a transcriptional activator to initiate downstream gene
  expression. (C) Hedgehog signal pathway: Ptc-induced inhibition of Smo is reversed
  by Hh binding with Ptc, leading to the release of the complex of GLI (GLI/SUFU/SKT36)
  from microtubules, with GLI protein entering the nucleus to transcriptionally activate
  downstream target genes.'
