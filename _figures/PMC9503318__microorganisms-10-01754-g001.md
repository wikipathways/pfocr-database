caption: 'Schematic representation of epigenetic modifications in RNA molecules during
  human herpesvirus (HHV) infections. (a) After the introduction of the viral DNA
  into the cytoplasm and posterior transcription of viral genes, writer enzymes perform
  various epigenetic modifications, such as methyl 6-adenosine (m6A), pseudouridylation
  (Ψ), methyl-5 cytosine (m5C) and 2′-O-methylation (2-OM). (b) The m6A modification
  is the most prevalent modification in mRNA and takes place during pre-mRNA synthesis
  in the nucleus. (c) Pseudouridylation is the most abundant modification in stable
  RNAs, it is irreversible and occurs through two pathways: an RNA-dependent pathway
  and RNA-independent pathway. (d) The m5C modification is related to improved function
  and stability of RNA molecules. (e) The 2-OM modification is found in rRNA and tRNA
  molecules and is associated with increased stability and translation modulation
  of mRNAs.'
