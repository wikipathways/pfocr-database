caption: β1 axis contributed to inducing differentiation of THP-1 cells into macrophages.
  In THP-1 cells, PMA could induce the upregulation of miRNA-132-3p, the upregulation
  of miRNA-132-3p results in the downregulation of WT1 by sponge action with binding
  on its 3’UTR, the down regulation of WT1 contributes to the upregulation of TGF-β1,
  then the polarization of macrophages is induced, which is indicated by the upregulation
  of CD11b and CD14 expression. Therefore, the miRNA-132-3p/WT1/TGF-β1 axis is involved
  in the committed differentiation of THP-1 leukemia cells into macrophages
