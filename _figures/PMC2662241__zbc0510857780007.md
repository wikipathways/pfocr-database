caption: Working model. In light of the data, we propose that E4orf4-Src  signaling
  perturbs tensional homeostasis in tumor cells in part by promoting  the sustained
  activation of a Rho-ROCK pathway controlling both internal cell  tension and cell
  traction forces (cell adhesion on the outside) through the  concerted action of
  myosin II and JNK/Ser-178-paxillin phosphorylation. JNK  activation by E4orf4 also
  involves the contribution of another unknown pathway  (gray dotted line). Such chronic
  activation of the Rho-ROCK-JNK  pathway would promote the assembly of atypically
  enlarged FAs and of robust  tensile fibers, leading to a lethal increase in cytoskeletal
  tension.  Deregulation of the balance between cell tension and extracellular matrix  rigidity
  (ECM stiffness) that normally maintains tensional  homeostasis would contribute
  to engage the nonapoptotic cell death pathway  induced by E4orf4 through unknown
  mechanisms. MLC, myosin light  chain; MYPT, target subunit of the myosin light chain  phosphatase.
