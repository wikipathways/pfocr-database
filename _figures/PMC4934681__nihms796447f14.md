caption: New model for phrenic LTF with multiple molecular pathways. The Gqpathway
  (blue arrows) proceeds as described in , but can also be activated by α1-adrenergic
  receptors (α1Rs). The Gspathway (green arrows) can be induced by the activation
  of adenosine type 2A receptors (A2AR) or 5-HT type 7 receptors (5-HT7R), which are
  coupled to Gs proteins. Gssignaling activates protein kinase A (PKA), which stimulates
  immature TrkB to modulate phospho-protein kinase B (pAkt). In other systems, this
  phosphorylates glutamatergic NMDARs and increases sensitivity to pre-synaptic glutamate
  release. Recently, additional pathways (dashed arrows) have been described wherein
  vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) or erythropoietin receptor
  (EPOR) induce LTF via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and pAkt, and perhaps pERK.
