caption: 'Perpetuation of innate immune responses in sJIA. Innate immune pathways
  activated in sJIA are normally triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns by TLRs expressed on innate immune cells, but can also be triggered
  by endogenous ligands in inflammatory conditions. These intracellular pathways lead
  to activation of the transcription factor NFκB, which is translocated into the nucleus
  where it upregulates expression of genes encoding several proinflammatory cytokines.
  These cytokines initiate the inflammatory cascade through their effects on the hypothalamus,
  bone marrow, liver and vascular endothelial cells. Activated vascular endothelial
  cells act as a procoagulant surface and are likely to contribute to the coagulopathy
  of sJIA.107 Antibodies against endothelial cells reportedly occur in sJIA,108 although
  the relevance of this latter finding is unclear. The cytokines also drive joint
  inflammation, by stimulating osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, osteoblast apoptosis,
  inhibition of chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis and synoviocyte secretion of enzymes
  that degrade matrix and cartilage. Since signaling through IL-1R and IL-18R shares
  the downstream portion of the TLR4 signaling pathway, IL-1 and IL-18 provide positive
  feedback loops that further contribute to perpetuation of the inflammatory responses
  in sJIA. Abbreviations: IL-1R, IL-1 receptor; IL-18R, IL-18 receptor; M-CSF, macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; sJIA, systemic juvenile idiopathic
  arthritis; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; WBC, white blood
  cell.'
