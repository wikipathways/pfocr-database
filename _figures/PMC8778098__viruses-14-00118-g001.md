caption: Signal transduction pathways in tumor cells and targeting for oHSV replication
  and spread. PKR signaling (left) confers a strong defense against viral infection
  which is activated by dsRNA from viral infection leading to auto-phosphorylation
  of PKR which phosphorylates eIF-2α. Phosphorylated eIF-2α leads to inhibition of
  cellular translation and prevents viral protein translation in the process. The
  PKR pathway is attenuated by oHSV via ICP34.5 which regulates PP1 and leads to PP1-mediated
  dephosphorylation of eIF-2α. VHS is an oHSV tegument nuclease that is able to degrade
  viral RNA and thus avoid PKR signaling activation. Furthermore, US11 of oHSV directly
  interacts with PKR and prevents its auto-phosphorylation. Additionally, PKR regulates
  cellular apoptosis pathways via Caspase 8 and p38-MAPK signaling, and also contributes
  to anti-viral response via p38–MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Toll-like receptors
  (middle) are another pathway activated in infected cells and are able to detect
  viral nucleic acids. Upon entry of virus in the host cell, endosomes of infected
  cells detect viral nucleic acids leading to TLR activation. This leads to the recruitment
  of the adaptor protein, MyD88 and complexes with IRAK and TRAF6 ultimately leading
  to NK-κB activation and an anti-viral response. cGAS-STING signaling (right) is
  activated through viral dsDNA and is detected by cell cyclic GMP–AMP synthase(cGAS).
  Activation of cGAS leads to synthesis of 2′,3′-cGAMP and causes activation of its
  downstream target located on the cell’s endoplasmic reticulum, STING. Activation
  of STING leads to creation of autophagosomes and causes upregulation of Type I interferon
  gene expression and a strong anti-viral response. These pathways may be targeted
  with oHSV transgenes or innate features of oHSV to attenuate the host tumor cell
  anti-viral response.
