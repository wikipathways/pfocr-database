caption: 'SARS-CoV-2′s life cycle in a host cell and its expected interference with
  the GR signaling pathway. Upon infection to a host cell, SARS-CoV-2 releases its
  positive-sense single-stranded genomic (g) RNA into the cytoplasm and initiates
  synthesis of its RNAs and their encoding proteins. On the other hand, the infection
  activates local anti-viral innate immune system through host PRRs, which in turn
  stimulate production/release of type I IFNs. Activated PRRs and released IFNs further
  stimulate host transcription factors (e.g., NFκB, AP1, STATs and IRFs) for the expression
  of ISGs and proinflammatory cytokine genes. Some of the produced viral proteins
  (e.g., NSP6, NSP13, ORF3, and ORF6) shift host cell activities toward viral replication,
  such as by changing the activities of host kinases, transcription factors, nuclear
  pore complex, and RNA processing machinery, whereas they downregulate host innate
  immunity. In the process of modulating host cell activities, SARS-CoV-2 appears
  to suppress coincidentally the facilitative effects of GR on viral replication by
  affecting multiple components of its intracellular signaling pathway. Host and viral
  proteins are indicated with regular and italic letters, respectively. AP1: activator
  protein-1, GR: glucocorticoid receptor, GRIP1: glucocorticoid receptor-interacting
  protein-1, IFN: interferon, IRF: interferon regulatory factor, ISG: IFN-stimulated
  gene, NFκB: nuclear factor of κB, NSP: non-structural protein, ORF: open reading
  frame, PRR: pattern recognition receptor, STAT: signal transducer and activator
  of transcription.'
