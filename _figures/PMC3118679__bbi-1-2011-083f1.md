caption: 'Model of the networks of factors (genes product, hormones, and metabolites)
  potentially involved in the regulation of milk protein synthesis in lactating bovine
  mammary tissue. The network includes the transport of AA and glucose, insulin signaling
  and activation of protein synthesis through mTOR (mTORC1) pathway, the activation
  of mTOR pathway by Leu and vps34, the mTOR inhibition through the tuberous sclerosis
  (TSC), GSK3A, TP53, and AMPK signaling. Non-essential AA are filled with pink, essential
  AA (EAA) of group I (EAA where the mammary up-take approximates the output in milk
  protein) are filled in light blue, while EAA of group II (the mammary up-take is
  in large excess compared to the milk protein output) are filled in white with red
  font.,,, The detailed description of the network is reported in Additional file
  1. Not reported in the model is the function of MAPK signaling in protein synthesis.
  Not depicted is also the role of GH and IGF1 on milk protein synthesis regulation
  through mTOR.,Notes: *denotes proteins where the gene expression was measured in
  the present experiment. The arrows denote activation (can be phosphorylation/activation
  →; molecular movement/transport [Ȳ]; induction of gene expression [----➢]) or inhibition
  (—|). Full name of genes and proteins not reported here are in . Red small round
  objects denote phosphorylation.'
