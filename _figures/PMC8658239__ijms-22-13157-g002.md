caption: The molecular pathways of the aneurysms formation. One of the inducers of
  inflammation is angiotensin II (Ang II). It is a peptide hormone, which promotes
  a proinflammatory, profibrotic, and proliferative effect. This activates EC and
  induces expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), intercellular adhesion
  molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), selectins, and
  integrins. Studies have shown that Ang II, by stimulating the synthesis of prostaglandin
  (PG) and ROS, modulates microvascular permeability. Consequently, Ang II is involved
  in the vasodilation mechanism and thus plays an important role in blood pressure
  regulation. RhoA pathway activation is responsible for barrier dysfunction in the
  vascular EC (Yao et al., 2010). Moreover, it has been shown that it is involved
  in the inhibition of the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).
  Interestingly, the binding of AngII to its AT1 receptor in arteries and arterioles
  induces the production and release of TNFα.
