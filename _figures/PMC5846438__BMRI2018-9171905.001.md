caption: Possible signaling mechanisms of amino acids in intestinal inflammation in
  the ECs are illustrated. Amino acids ameliorate intestinal inflammation by impressing
  NF-κB and MAPK pathway. Amino acids activate Nrf2 pathway to regulate intestinal
  inflammation via inhibiting oxidative stress and the expressions of proinflammatory
  cytokines. Amino acids activate iNOS to inhibit NF-κB pathway by the production
  of NO. ACE2 combines B0AT1 to regulate uptake of Trp in IECs, which activates expressions
  of antimicrobial peptides to regulate intestinal microbiota. ACE2 illuminate intestinal
  inflammation by regulating innate immune responses and intestinal microbiota is
  not shown in the figure. GCN2 regulates intestinal inflammation by inhibiting inflammasome
  activation, triggering autophagy, and preventing oxidative stress. CaSR activated
  by Trp exerts anti-inflammation roles via activating the complex of Β-arrestin 2
  (β-arr2) to inhibit NF-κB and MAPK pathway in IECs. After being activated by amino
  acids, mTOR signaling could inhibit autophagy.
