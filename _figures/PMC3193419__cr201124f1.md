caption: In normal stem/progenitor cells, the promoter regions of many CpG island-containing
  developmental genes are marked by both active (trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4;
  H3K4me3) and repressive marks (trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27; H3K27me3), termed
  “bivalent chromatin” by Bernstein et al. . This chromatin pattern holds these genes
  in a low, poised transcription state to prevent premature lineage commitment. When
  the stem/progenitor cells respond to environmental cues and start to differentiate,
  a shift of the balance between the active and repressive epigenetic marks takes
  place with corresponding changes in chromatin architecture, leading to the silencing
  of stemness genes and upregulation of lineage-specific genes. However, repeated
  environmental stress such as chronic inflammation or accumulating reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) may promote clonal expansion of cells with genetic or epigenetic abnormalities,
  which then contribute to tumor initiation and progression. During this course of
  oncogenesis, the repressive marks in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes
  may recruit DNA methylation machinery to impose abnormal CpG island methylation
  on these genes leading to permanent gene silencing. At the same time, these epigenetic
  abnormalities may also contribute to activation of stem cell pathways, such as the
  Wnt pathway, and bestow self-renewing properties on cancer cells.
