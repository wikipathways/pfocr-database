caption: '(A) Chemical structure of oxidized NAD+. NAD+ comprises two nucleotides,
  one containing an adenine nucleobase and the other containing nicotinamide, joined
  through their phosphate groups. The location of various chemical moieties contained
  within NAD+ are indicated: ADP-ribose (ADPR), nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide riboside
  (NR), and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). (B) NAD+ is synthesized de novo in
  a pathway leading from tryptophan (blue), as well as in ‘salvage’ pathways: (i)
  the nicotinic acid (NA) (‘Preiss–Handler’) salvage pathway (yellow), (ii) the nicotinamide
  mononucleotide (NMN) salvage pathway (green), and (iii) the nicotinamide riboside
  (NR) salvage pathway (green). The abbreviations for the enzymes (gray text) and
  the intermediates (black plain text) are defined in .'
