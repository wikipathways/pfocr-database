caption: ncRNAs as potential targets for immunotherapies. a TGFβ represents one of
  the most significant immune barriers imposed by tumors. In the tumor microenvironment,
  TGFβ establishes immunosuppression via the c-Myc/miR-23a/Blimp-1 axis. In engineered
  cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes blockade of miR-23a restores adoptive T cell transfer
  therapy. b Immune-checkpoint proteins, such as PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1, can tightly
  regulate the activation or repression of the functions of T cells and influence
  the cancer immune response. The most relevant ncRNAs invovled in regulating the
  PD-1/PD-L1 pathway are included in Fig. 3b
