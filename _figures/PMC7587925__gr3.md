caption: Overview of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/CD14/toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling
  pathway in alcohol-associated liver disease. Chronic ethanol exposure leads to bacterial
  translocation and increased leaking of the gut barrier and translocation of LPS
  from gut to liver. In liver, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP; the shuttle
  protein) transfers LPS to CD14, which facilitates the binding of LPS to TLR-4/MD-2/IRAK
  complex. TLR4 undergoes dimerization and transduces signal by MyD88-dependent and
  TRIF-dependent pathways. The subsequent downstream signaling included the recruitment
  of IRAK4, IRAK1, and TRAF-6, which ultimately leads to the production of proinflammatory
  cytokines by the activation of NF-κB, JUNK, Erk1/2, and p38 MAPK pathways. IKK2,
  inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase 2; IRAK, IL-1R–associated kinase; IRF,
  interferon regulatory factor; JNK1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1; MD-2, myeloid differentiation
  protein-2; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TRAF, TNF receptor associated factor;
  TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β.
