caption: Differentially expressed genes related to mammary epithelial cell proliferation
  and milk protein synthesis in the PI3K-Akt, WNT, and mTOR signaling pathways after
  knockdown of S100A9 in MAC-T cells. Red or green ovals (rectangles) represent the
  up-regulated or down-regulated proteins (genes), respectively. This figure illustrates
  the potential underlying mechanisms of the effects of S100A9 on milk protein content.
