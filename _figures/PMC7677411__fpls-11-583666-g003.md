caption: BR signaling and its impact on CBF expression. In the presence of BRs, BRI1
  binds to BAK1, to activate inhibition of BIN2-type kinases and thereby impair the
  phosphorylation and inactivation of the transcription factors ICE1, PIF4, CES, and
  BZR1 that control expression of specific CBFs. Cold may impact this pathway by multiple
  means, including effects of calcium-activated CDPKs, CRLK1/2-controlled MAP kinases,
  and cold-induced SUMOylation events. In addition to CBF-control, BR signaling also
  impacts CBF-independent modes of COR gene regulation, our understanding of which
  is summarized on the left. However, how this activity is realized is yet unknown.
