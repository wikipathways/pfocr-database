caption: 'Inflammasome activation in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder
  - roles of the nuclear receptors. NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which includes
  canonical and noncanonical activation pathways, is induced by a number of pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns and danger signaling molecules patterns. The canonical activation
  pathway involves stimulation-mediated activation signals such as ion fluxes, lysosomal
  rupture, mitochondrial dysfunction, and so on. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to
  the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, damaged mitochondrial DNA,
  and calcium release from the mitochondria, and all these changes facilitate the
  assembly of inflammasomes. Activation of the inflammasome causes caspase-1 activation,
  leading to the maturation and release of interleukin (IL)-1/IL-18 and pyroptosis.
  In addition, caspase-1 modulates the membrane stability of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid (AMPA) receptors, which leads to the down-regulation of AMPA receptors at the
  synapses. Nuclear receptors inhibit the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome, which will
  finally protect the excitatory AMPA receptor synaptic activity and contribute to
  the antidepressant mechanism of the nuclear receptor activators. ROS: Reactive oxygen
