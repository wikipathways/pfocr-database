caption: Known molecular pathways involving anti-inflammatory properties of microalgae
  metabolites in reducing intensity of inflammatory responses which when left unchecked
  leads to cytokine storm as observed in COVID-19 patients. Molecular pathway responses
  of some known metabolites from microalgae involved in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
  pathways are mapped. Stimuli received by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such
  as Toll-like receptors (TLR) start off a cascade of pro-inflammatory responses,
  most probably affecting downstream myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88).
  The MM (in green colour) indicates microalgae metabolites that may act as inhibitors
  or enhancers. The metabolites, mostly peptides, can act on Ang-I (yellow colour)
  conversion by ACE to reduce pro-inflammatory Ang-II accumulation. Aberrated accumulation
  of Ang-II can further incite pro-inflammatory signalling pathways such as nuclear
  factor kappa B pathway (NF-κB; orange colour) and mitogen-activated protein kinase
  pathway (MAPK; blue colour. The MM majorly act on the pro-inflammatory NF-κB and
  MAPK pathways by inhibiting translocation of NF-κB/MAPK into the cell’s nucleus
  or preventing dephosphorylation of the kinases from both pathway thus reducing synthesis
  of pro-inflammatory mediators responsible for inflammation. Certain MM with antioxidant
  activities particularly work by enhancing nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor
  2 (NRF2) and increase production of antioxidant-related gene expression to reduce
  reactive oxidative speices (ROS). The arachidonic acid pathway (AA; pink colour)
  can incidentally be activated by increased inflammatory responses. AA released from
  cell membrane can be used to produce pro-inflammatory eicosanoids via COX-2 and
  LOX pathways. MM from the polyunsaturated fatty acid types have been observed to
  partially block synthesis of pro-inflammatory AA eicosanoids. Lipid derivative of
  MMs may also play a role as lipid regulators and have been observed to competitively
  block translocation of NF-κB into cell nucleus by activating nuclear receptor PPAR-γ
  as a mode to reduce inflammatory responses. MM, microalgae metabolites; IKK, IκB
  Kinase; MMP-9, matrix metallopeptidase 9; PPAR-γ, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma
