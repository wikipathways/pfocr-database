caption: The second module identified by iMCMC and the corresponding known pathway
  in the GBM data. (A) Red and blue colors in the vertex represent the proportion
  of gene's coverage and the influence of its mutation status on other genes. Thick
  gray line shows that gene CDKN2B and the metagene CDK4/TSPAN31 are approximately
  exclusive (with exclusivity more than 0.90), whereas the dashed green curve represents
  existence of relative correlation between the expressions of the corresponding pair
  of genes. It is similar for the following figures. (B) CDK4 is suppressed by CDKN2B
  in the RB signaling pathway, where the interaction is as reported in [].
