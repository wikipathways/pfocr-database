caption: Recognition of self-DNA by DNA sensing receptors. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)
  recognizes CpG motifs in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and activates the transcription factor
  nuclear factor (NF)-κB and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-7 through the myeloid
  differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway. cGAS, a cytosolic
  DNA sensor, catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) from ATP and GTP.
  2′3-cGAMP binds to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) adaptor, stimulator of interferon
  genes (STING). STING then activates kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IκB
  kinase (IKK) that phosphorylate the transcription factor IRF3 to turn on the expression
  of NF-κB and other in  and IL-6. The absent in melanoma-2 (AIM2) inflammasome recognizes
  self-DNA and activates apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC),
  resulting in the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18.
