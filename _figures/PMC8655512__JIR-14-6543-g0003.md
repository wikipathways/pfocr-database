caption: 'Immunological functions of PGRN. Four main immunological functions of PGRN:
  Pro-inflammatory: PGRN can be subjected to degradation into GRN fragments by MMP-9,
  MMP-12, MMP-14, neutrophil elastase, and PRTN3, GRNs stimulate secretion of IL-8
  by epithelium cells in MS; Anti-inflammatory: PGRN binds to TNFR1 and activates
  ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways to inhibit TNF-α activated NF-κB inflammatory pathway
  which promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-6; PGRN selectively
  inhibits expression and release of CXCL9 and CXCL10 induced by TNF-α in a TNFR1
  dependent manner; Combination of PGRN and TNFR2 will ameliorate chronic inflammatory
  disorders via FOXO4–STAT3-dependent IL-10 production in Tregs; Induce chondrogenesis
  and cartilage repair: PGRN activates the ERK/JunB signaling pathways; PGRN may inhibit
  cartilage loss bone resorption mediated by NF-κB pathway in a TNFR1-dependent manner;
  Inhibiting ADAMTS-7/ADAMTS-12–mediated COMP degradation and TNF-α-induced ADAMTS-7/ADAMTS-12
  expression; Regulating of TLR9 signaling pathway.'
