caption: (A–C) Schematics of Wnt signaling components in the absence of a Wnt signal
  (A), the presence of a Wnt signal (B), and the presence of a Wnt signal blocked
  by the displacement of Tcf7l2 by dnTcf7l2 (C). (A) Without a Wnt signal, β-catenin
  is phosphorylated by a protein complex surrounding GSK3β and sent for ubiquitination.
  In the nucleus of the cell, Tcf7l2 associates with the Groucho-TLE corepressors,
  as well as other repressors (HDAC and CtBP1). Transcription of Wnt target genes
  is repressed. Asterisks indicate components of the Wnt signaling pathway that  found
  are up-regulated by Vax2 (see also C). (B) The Wnt ligand binds to its Frizzled
  receptors and LRP coreceptors. Dvl breaks up the GSK3β-centered protein complex,
  releasing β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus, displaces corepressors,
  and attaches to the β-catenin-binding site (βc-BS) on Tcf7l2. Target Wnt genes are
  expressed. (C) DnTcfl72 has displaced Tcf7l2 in the nucleus. Because dnTcfl72 lacks
  a β-catenin-binding site, it remains a transcriptional repressor even in the presence
  of a Wnt signal and the subsequent availability of β-catenin. The cell has, in effect,
  become “blind” to the Wnt signal (see ).
