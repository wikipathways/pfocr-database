caption: Differential effect of β1C and β1A integrin cytoplasmic variants on FAK,
  AKT, and MAP kinase pathways. The schematic drawings illustrate the β1C effect on
  intracellular signaling pathways in response to exogenous and endogenous integrin
  engagement by fibronectin (Fn; A) or in response to either exogenous β1C (B) or
  exogenous β1A (C) ligation by TS2/16. The inhibitory effect of β1C on Ras/ERK2,
  but not on FAK and AKT pathways, is shown in A. The failure of β1C to induce ERK2
  activation is shown in B. A previously described activation of the MAP kinase pathway
  by PI 3-kinase, downstream of Ras (), is blocked in our model (A). It is also shown
  that AKT is activated in response to fibronectin (A), β1C (B), or β1A (C) engagement.
