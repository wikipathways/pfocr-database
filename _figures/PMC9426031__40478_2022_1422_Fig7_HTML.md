caption: 'Schematic illustrating multiple roles of CD105+ cells in GBM. A CD105+ cell
  interacts with the TGF-β pathway. CD105, a receptor of TGF-β, can affect angiogenesis,
  vascular permeability and cell proliferation by binding different TGF-β subtypes.
  B, C CD105+ cell shapes the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. Cytokines
  secreted by GBM CD105+ cells share the function of recruiting immunosuppressive
  cells. CD105+ cells impair immune cell function and contribute to creating an immunosuppressive
  barrier. D CD105 constitute a marker of GBM vasculature. E In vitro drug sensitivity
  screening of CD105+ cells. CD105+ cells are resistant to conventional drugs: TMZ
  and AVZ but sensitive to ABT-751, Doxorubicin, Idarubicin and Fludarabine. F Schematic
  depicts the “Seed and soil” rational for GBM growth. Based on the distribution and
  function of CD105+ cells, we predict CD105+ cells may release extracellular matrix
  (ECM), initiating a tumor tolerant microenvironment and thereby promoting tumor
  progression'
