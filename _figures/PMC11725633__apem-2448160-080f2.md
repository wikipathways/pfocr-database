caption: Immunoregulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by fatty acids. Dietary supplementation
  with ω-3 PUFAs decreases the frequency of TH1 cells and their effector cytokines
  in type 1 diabetes, and the serum lipid profiles are altered in SLE and RA patients.
  SCFA supplementation alleviates vancomycin-induced allergic asthma by downregulating
  TH2 immune responses, yet fatty acid immunometabolism remains largely unexplored
  in TH1 and TH2 cells. In TH17 cells, genes related to fatty acid metabolism (e.g.,
  ACC1, ACLY, FASN), intracellular proteins (e.g., FABP, CD5L), and intracellular
  fatty acid composition critically regulate differentiation and effector functions.
  Treg-cell function is well-documented to be promoted by SCFAs and these cells actively
  utilize FAO for their energy needs. In TFH cells, CXCR5 expression is uniquely controlled
  by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and its de novo synthesis pathway, governed by
  the gene Pyct2. LCFA accumulation in the tumor microenvironment drives CD8+ T-cell
  dysfunction, but individual fatty acids or lipid subtypes that can potentiate CD8+
  T cells are currently being researched. DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; EPA, eicosapentaenoic
  acid; PUFA, poly-unsaturated fatty acid; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; RA,
  rheumatoid arthritis; IFN-γ, interferon-gamma; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha;
  IL, interleukin; PCYT2, ethanolaminephosphate cytidylyltransferase; LCFA, long-chain
  fatty acid; ACC1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1; ACLY, adenosine triphosphatecitrate
  lyase; FASN, fatty acid synthase; FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; SFA, saturated
  fatty acid; RORγt, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA
  desaturase 1; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-beta; PI, phosphatidylinositol;
  Acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A
