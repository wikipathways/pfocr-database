caption: A schematic signaling pathway of TLR7 and 9. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells
  abundantly express TLR7 and TLR9 on their endosomal membranes, TLR7 and TLR9 are
  responsible for recognizing ssRNA and unmethylated CpG region of DNA. Once activated,
  TLR7 and TLR9 recruit adaptor protein MyD88, which subsequently forms a complex
  with IRAK4, TRAF6, IRAK1, and IRAF7. This complex can activate NF-kB and phosphorylate
  IRF7. Then, the activated NF-kB and phosphorylated IRF7 are translocated into the
  nucleus, where they induce the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  type I IFNs.
