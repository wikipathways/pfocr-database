caption: Major biosynthetic pathways for apigenin. Apigenin is synthesized in plants
  from either L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) or L-tyrosine (L-Tyr), both generated by the
  Shikimate pathway. Early and distinct reactive steps for each substrate converge
  on the last step of the (A) general phenylpropanoid pathway (GPP) and (B) a shared
  flavone synthesis pathway (FSP). Note that three equivalents of malonyl-CoA are
  incorporated into p-coumaroyl-CoA by CHS to generate chalcone. PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia lyase; TAL, tyrosine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate
  CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; FNS, flavone synthase
  (soluble FNS1 and membrane-bound FNS2 forms)
