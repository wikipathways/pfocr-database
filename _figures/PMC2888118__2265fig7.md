caption: (a) Diagram illustrating the current knowledge and existing gaps in our understanding
  of the complicated interactions between different toxA-regulatory genes. (b, c)
  Modification of (a) based on the results obtained in the present study. (b) Interactions
  between the toxA-regulatory genes under iron-deficient conditions. (c) Interactions
  of these genes under iron-sufficient conditions. ? indicates a previously undetermined
  mechanism of regulation; a dotted arrow indicates a potential regulatory pathway
  based only on DNA-binding studies with the PvdS–RNAP complex and the toxA upstream
  region. cRNAP, Core RNA polymerase; σV, any sigma factor other than PvdS.
