caption: Proposed model for the synergistic effect of docetaxel and resveratrol. Resveratrol
  downregulates docetaxel-induced upregulation of HER-2, Akt and MAPKs, while that
  of NF-κB is unaffected. The study postulates that docetaxel-induced upregulation
  of HER-2–Akt signaling and the downregulation of the same by resveratrol is the
  main mechanism governing the synergistic effect of docetaxel and resveratrol in
  HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Although MAPK pathway does not regulate
  the synergism, it is getting activated by docetaxel and downregulated by resveratrol.
  The bold lines indicate the signaling pathways regulating the synergism, whereas
  the dotted lines represent those that do not have any role in the same.

  description: Proposed model for the synergistic effect of docetaxel and resveratrol.
    Resveratrol downregulates docetaxel-induced upregulation of HER-2, Akt and MAPKs,
    while that of NF-κB is unaffected. The study postulates that docetaxel-induced
    upregulation of HER-2–Akt signaling and the downregulation of the same by resveratrol
    is the main mechanism governing the synergistic effect of docetaxel and resveratrol
    in HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Although MAPK pathway does not regulate
    the synergism, it is getting activated by docetaxel and downregulated by resveratrol.
