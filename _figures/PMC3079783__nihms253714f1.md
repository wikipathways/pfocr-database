caption: 'Leptin binding to the long form LRb results in the activation and tyrosine
  phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which induces subsequent phosphorylation
  of downstream tyrosine residues (Tyr985, Tyr1077 and Tyr1138) in the intracellular
  tail of LRb. Phosphorylated Tyr1138 binds and mediates the phosphorylation-dependent
  activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which
  activates transcription of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and other
  positive effectors of leptin action. Phosphorylated Tyr985 recruits the SH2-containing
  tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which activates the signaling pathway that culminates
  in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. During prolonged stimulation,
  phosphorylated Tyr985 binds SOCS3 to mediate feedback inhibition of LRb signaling.
  Phosphorylated Tyr1077 recruits STAT5 to induce STAT5-dependent transcription activation;
  however, its functional effect is less clear. Signals mediated via phosphorylated
  Jak2 include insulin receptor substrate protein (IRS) and the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  The PI3K/Akt signaling is important for the LRb-mediated anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative
  effects via down-regulating pro-apoptotic (eg. Bad, Bim, Bax and p53) while up-regulating
  anti-apoptotic/survival factors (eg. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Cyclin D).*Figure adapted
