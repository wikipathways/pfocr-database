caption: NLRX1 interactions with pathogen sensing pathways. NLRX1 can interact with
  multiple pathways of pathogen sensing. RNA viruses can be detected by the RIG‐1/MDA5‐MAVS
  pathway, which can be inhibited by NLRX1 at multiple steps including PCPB2‐mediated
  degradation of MAVS itself, NLRX1‐TUFM‐driven autophagy, NLRX1‐TRAF6 sequestering
  and NLRX1‐mediated ubiquitination of the IKK complex downstream of MAVS signalling.,  Additionally,
  NLRX1 can inhibit the DNA sensing pathway of cGAS‐STING. NLRX1 can sequester the
  interaction between STING and TBK1, as well as TRAF3‐mediated signalling downstream
  of MAVS. NLRX1 can also interact with autophagy proteins to control fungal infection
  via LC3‐associated phagocytosis. All of these interactions are in place as negative
  regulators of inflammation and can be exploited by pathogens to aid immune avoidance
