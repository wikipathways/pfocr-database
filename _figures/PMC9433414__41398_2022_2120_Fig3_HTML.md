caption: Light at night activates ERK MAPK and mTORC1 pathways in the SCN by the neurotransmitter
  glutamate and PACAP. ERK MAPK in turn activates MSK to phosphorylate CREB and activated
  Per transcription. ERK MAPK also activated MNK, which in turn phosphorylates the
  cap-binding protein eIF4E at Ser209 and regulate mRNA translation. The mTORC1 activation
  also regulates translation through downstream translation pathway effectors such
  as S6Ks and 4E-BPs, etc. Phosphorylated S6K regulates circadian ribosomal biogenesis.
  Phosphorylation of 4E-BP activated eIF4E dependent translation. The ERK MAPK and
  mTOR pathways converge on eIF4E to regulate cap-dependent translation of Per1, Per2,
  Vip mRNAs, which play important roles in photic entrainment of the circadian clock
  and SCN cell synchronization. Circadian mTOR activities are controlled by the circadian
  clock via complex mechanisms, one of which may be through the interaction of Per2
  with TSC1.
