caption: Positive regulatory pathways of PD-L1 mediated by other posttranslational
  modifications. a PDIA5 appears to exert a negative regulatory effect on PD-L1, while
  ERO1-a enhances PD-L1 expression by facilitating the proper formation of disulfide
  bonds in PD-L1. ERO1-α additionally upregulates HIF-1a protein, resulting in increased
  PD-L1 mRNA and protein levels. b S-palmitoylation occurs within the Golgi apparatus.
  ZDHHC9, DHHC3, DHHC5, and FASN have been identified as promoters of PD-L1 palmitoylation
  and thereby contribute to the stabilization of the PD-L1 protein. Conversely, DHA
  inhibits FASN, thereby suppressing the palmitoylation of PD-L1. c STAT5, which promotes
  glycolysis, leads to lactic acid accumulation, subsequently facilitating E3BP nuclear
  translocation and histone lactylation, culminating in the induction of PD-L1 transcription.
  d HDAC2 facilitates nuclear translocation through PD-L1 deacetylation, whereas p300
  promotes acetylation, enhancing its interaction with TRAPPC4 and facilitating PD-L1
  recycling to the membrane. e PDGF/ARF6/AMAP1 enhances the recycling of PD-L1 to
  the membrane by augmenting the ADP-ribosylation of PD-L1. The black arrows denote
  positive regulation, while the red arrows signify negative regulation
