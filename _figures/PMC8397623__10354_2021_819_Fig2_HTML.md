caption: Simplified, schematic representation of the ApoE signaling pathway, which
  controls APP transcription and Aβ production by activating a MAP kinase cascade.
  ApoE increases the risk of AD by causing a gradual increase in APP abundance and
  Aβ secretion, with ApoE4 being more and ApoE2 less efficient than ApoE3, in parallel
  with its effects on AD risk. (Adapted from Huang et al., Cell, 2017 Stimulation
  of APP transcription and Aβ secretion by ApoE)
