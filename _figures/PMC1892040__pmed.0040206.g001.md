caption: In mammals (upper pathway), electrons from NADPH are transferred to an oxidoreductase
  flavoenzyme, either thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) or glutathione reductase (GR).
  Electrons are then transferred from the oxidoreductase flavoenzyme to the appropriate
  electron carrier, either oxidized thioredoxin (Trx-S2) or glutathione disulfide
  (GSSG) converting them to reduced thioredoxin (Trx-[SH]2) or glutathione (GSH),
  respectively. Trx-(SH)2 and GSH then supply reducing equivalents for a number of
  different reactions, including those that are glutaredoxin (Grx)-dependent. In S.
  mansoni (lower pathway), TrxR and GR are replaced with a unique oxidoreductase flavoenzyme,
  TGR, which provides reducing equivalents for Trx-, GSH- and Grx-dependent reactions.
