caption: Schematic representation of nutrient and stress sensing by root cell. An
  unknown receptor sends the message to the unknown proteins which in connection with
  CBL/CIPK induces the genes responsible for auxin signaling. Similarly other mechanism
  also works along with CBL/CIPK pathway which induces various auxin, ethylene, gibberellin,
  phosphate induced genes. Several transcription factors, TFs are also induced due
  to phosphate deficiency which further control various genes. LBD37/38/39-lateral
