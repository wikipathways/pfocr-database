caption: Summary diagram of the proposed ADM signaling pathway in retina. Protein
  kinase C (PKC) activation leads to increased transcription of the ADM gene via a
  PKC enhancer element. The ADM precursor preproadrenomedullin is cleaved to proadrenomedullin
  which is then cleaved into the secreted peptide ADM and the proadrenomedullin NH2-terminal
  peptide (PAMP). ADM is secreted and binds to the G protein coupled receptor calcitonin
  receptor like receptor (CRLR) that is associated with either the receptor activity
  modifying protein RAMP2 or RAMP3 to activate a signaling cascade that increases
  cAMP by activating adenylyl cyclase. Increases in cAMP levels activate protein kinase
  A (PKA), which increases calcium levels by opening membrane calcium channels or
  by releasing intracellular calcium stores. The overall increase in intracellular
  calcium can increase NO production by directly stimulating nNOS or by activating
  nNOS through the activation of the calcium-activated phosphatase, calcineurin (CaN),
  which dephosphorylates nNOS at an inhibitory phosphorylation site at serine847.
  Increases in NO production can then increase cGMP synthesis by activating soluble
  guanylyl cyclase (sGC). The ADM signaling pathway is inhibited by a PKC β inhibitor
  and the calcineurin inhibitor FK-506
