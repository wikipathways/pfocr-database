caption: 'Polyisoprenyl phosphate remodeling in PMN: a rapid signaling pathway engaged
  during LX–ALX interactions. LXA4 and 15-epi-LXA4 are produced during inflammation
  as “stop signals” for agonist-triggered PMN responses. Interactions with ALX block
  agonist-induced PSDP turnover to PSMP. PSDP inhibits PLD and PI3K to reduce prophlogistic
  cellular responses.'
