caption: (a) Cortisol, when applied topically, produced endogenously, or derived from
  the circulation, impairs wound healing by inhibiting keratinocyte proliferation
  and migration. Damage to the epidermal barrier as well as infection would activate
  the skin equivalent of the HPA axis (sHPA), and local steroidogenesis, as well,
  would stimulate 11 βHSD1. Inhibition of elements of sHPA, 11 βHSD1 activity, and
  stimulation of 11 βHSD2 activity are the potential pharmacological targets for therapy
  of difficult-to-heal wounds, especially in patients receiving GC. (b) In keratinocytes,
  GC were shown to activate the classic nuclear (GR) receptor, as well as the recently
  described membrane bound GR (mbGR) () and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) ().
  This novel pathway, triggered by binding of GC to mbGR, leads to activation of PKC,
  downregulation of GSK3-β, followed by stimulation of β-catenin and finally c-myc.
  Secondly, MR binds GC with equal strength as its natural ligand aldosterone; thus,
  excess GC results in constant activation of the receptor. Recent studies show that
  deactivation of mbGR or MR may prevent skin atrophy in patients treated with GC.
  Increased production of endogenous GC (cortisol) as a result of stimulation of sHPA
  and/or overexpression of 11 βHSD1 may also lead to delayed reepithelialization in
  wound healing, as well as age-related skin atrophy. Thus, the pathway of synthesis
  (steroidogenesis) and cortisol inactivation by 11 βHSD2 are potential targets for
  novel therapies. 11 βHSD1, 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1; 11 βHSD2, 11
  β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2; GC, glucocorticoid; GR, GC receptor; HPA,
  hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal; PKC, protein kinase C.
