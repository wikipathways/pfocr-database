caption: Role of MAOs in the suppression of antitumor immunity. Monoamine oxidases
  (MAOs) appear to regulate various mechanisms, depending on the type of cancer. On
  the one hand, increased levels of MAO-A can lead to increased production of ROS,
  which in turn inhibit Prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), a key regulator of hypoxia-inducible
  factor alpha (HIF-α), which, by binding to HIF-β, translocates to the nucleus and
  enables transcription of target genes involved in angiogenesis, tumor growth and
  metastasis. In addition, MAO-A is involved in paracrine Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signalling,
  which, by binding to the Ptch1 receptor of surrounding stromal cells, enables secretion
  of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand), IL-6 and TGFβ, promoting
  tumor seeding and colonization. Overexpression of MAO-A may also lead to polarization
  of macrophages into tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), via IL-4 and IL-13, inducing
  the JAK-STAT6 signaling pathway. This TAMs polarization is thought to contribute
  to the immunosupression of TCD8+ lymphocytes, which are involved in anti-tumor defence.
  Finally, the overexpression of MAO-A in TCD8+ lymphocytes also enables immunosupression
  through the increased degradation of serotonin, an important player in TCD8+ activation
  and hence the secretion of cytotoxic molecules such as granzyme B and interferon
  y (IFN y) involved in the degradation of cancer cells
