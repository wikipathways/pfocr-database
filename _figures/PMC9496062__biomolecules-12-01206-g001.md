caption: Mechanism of the cisplatin (DDP) action. (A) The platinum atom of DDP binds
  covalently to the N7 position of guanine. (B) An interstrand crosslink is formed
  when DDP binds to two bases from different strands. On the other hand, an intrastrand
  adduct is formed when DDP binds to two bases of the same strand. (C) DDP perturbs
  genomic DNA, inducing DNA damage response, which may result in apoptosis, DNA repair,
  and/or cell cycle arrest. Created with BioRender.com.
