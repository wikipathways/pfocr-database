caption: 'Biglycan determines pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling response by switching
  between TLR2/TLR4/CD14 and TLR4/CD44. Soluble biglycan via TLR2/TLR4/CD14 activates
  the pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling, leading to chemokine and cytokine production,
  immune cell recruitment, and pro-IL-1β production. Based on the same signaling,
  biglycan induces ROS generation and production of the B-cell chemoattractant CXCL13.
  In addition, biglycan clusters the purinergic receptors P2X4/P2X7 to trigger the
  NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, subsequently leading to the turnover of pro-IL-1β,
  by activated caspase-1, to active IL-1β. Together, these responses facilitate innate
  immunity and inflammation, promoting inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However,
  soluble biglycan can also exert anti-inflammatory signals. Biglycan induces the
  expression of NOX2 via the TLR2/TLR4/TRIF pathway, which ultimately leads to the
  inhibition of biglycan-TLR2/TLR4/MyD88-mediated IL-1β production. Furthermore, biglycan
  decreases inflammation by induction of autophagy. Through TLR4 and its coreceptor
  CD44, biglycan induces autophagy of M1 macrophages, thereby elevating the number
  of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. These responses can thereby inhibit unmitigated
  inflammation during inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Abbreviations: CD, cluster
