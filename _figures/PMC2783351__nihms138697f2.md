caption: 'TLR4 signaling occurs via a cascade of events. Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS; dark blue hexagon) is the prototypic TLR4 agonist that is transported to the
  cell via LPS-binding protein (gray oval), which transfers LPS to CD14 on the cell
  membrane (red oval). This leads to intracellular activation of acid sphingomyelinase
  (purple oval), which generates ceramide (red oval). Ceramide induces the generation
  of a lipid raft containing the co-receptor myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2)
  (light blue rectangle), TLR4 (purple rectangles), and heat shock protein (HSP) 70
  and HSP90 (pink oval), among other elements. Ceramide also activates NADPH oxidase,
  that leads to peroxynitrite formation. CD14 transfers LPS to MD2 (light blue rectangle),
  leading to both MD2-TLR4 heterodimerization and then homodimerization of MD2-TLR4
  pairs. Ensuing intracellular signaling occurs through toll-interleukin 1 receptor
  domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) to at least 3 parallel pathways: cell
  motility and cell survival/apoptosis occur through the IP3K/Akt pathway (yellow
  ovals), and proinflammatory products such as cytokines result from activation of
  the NFκB (dark blue circles) and MAPK (medium blue oval) pathways. The gray boxes
  provide summaries of the converging evidence that opioids interact with the TLR4
  signaling cascade. The TLR4 signaling pathway schema is a modified from illustrative
  figure of Dauphinee and Karsan http://www.nature.com/labinvest/journal/v86/n1/fig_tab/3700366f1.html#figure-title'
