caption: 'The current model of grass lignin biosynthesis, which includes aspects of
  the phenylpropanoid pathway and the flavone pathway. Grass preferential carbon flux
  is shown with green arrows, while dashed arrows represent unverified steps in the
  pathways. The current grass phenylpropanoid synthesis model is presented with a
  yellow background. The “shikimate shunt” is expanded on in the grey shaded region
  and is part of the phenylpropanoid model. The current monocot flavone synthesis
  model leading to formation of tricin is presented with a blue background. Monocot
  monolignols and conjugates found in significant concentrations are highlighted in
  purple. Phenylpropanoid enzymes: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; PTAL, phenylalanine/tyrosine
  ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-hydroxycinnamate:CoA ligase;
