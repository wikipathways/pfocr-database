caption: A proportion of NLRP3 has been shown to reside in the ER prior to activation
  and translocate to the mitochondria or mitochondria-associated membranes during
  activation. The translocation of NLRP3 to the mitochondria has been shown to be
  dependent on microtubule rearrangement and microtubule kinase MARK4. Activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires two signals. The first signal, referred to as
  NLRP3 “priming”, requires activation of NF-κB (for example, through TLR stimulation)
  and the upregulation of NLRP3 and IL-1β. The second activating signal has been shown
  to be mediated via several mechanisms. TLR priming induced upregulation of mtDNA
  via CMPK2, and the upregulation of mtROS has been shown to activate the NLRP3 at
  the mitochondria. mtDNA may also be able to activate the AIM2 inflammasome. ER stress
  has also been implicated in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and ER stress–induced
  activation of the UPR response pathway, including UPR sensors IRE1α and PERK, is
  required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Following activation, the NLRP3 inflammasome
  leads to the activation of caspase-1 and subsequent cleavage of IL-1β and IL-18.
  AIM2, absent in myeloma 2; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  a CARD; CMPK2, cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;

  1 alpha; MARK4, microtubule-affinity regulating kinase 4; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA;
