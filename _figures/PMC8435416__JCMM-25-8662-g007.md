caption: 'The working model of the preventive and therapeutic effects of PFD on RILF.
  PFD has a significant inhibitory effect on pulmonary fibrosis and fibrosis in other
  organs and is a broad‐spectrum antifibrosis drug. In our study, we show that PFD
  protects against RILF by reducing the recruitment of M2 macrophages and inhibiting
  activation of the TGF‐β1/Smad3 signalling pathway. PFD is also involved in the crosstalk
  between macrophages and AECs: 1. PFD reduces the migration of macrophages by inhibiting
  the secretion of chemokines by MLE‐12 cells induced by ionizing radiation. 2. PFD
  inhibits activation of the TGF‐β1/Smad3 signalling pathway in MLE‐12 cells by inhibiting
  the secretion of TGF‐β1 by M2 macrophages. Here, we provide a new theoretical basis
  for the use of PFD in the treatment of RILF. Parts of the figure were drawn using
