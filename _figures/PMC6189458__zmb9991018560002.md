caption: Map of autophagy induction. The canonical autophagy pathway (green arrows)
  is depicted down the center, where MTOR negatively regulates and AMPK positively
  regulates the ULK1/2 complex. These then activate the downstream BECN1 complex,
  leading to autophagy induction and subsequently the generation of LC3+ autophagosomes.
  Additionally, AMPK has been shown to directly phosphorylate BECN1. In yellow are
  complex members that have been shown to be dispensable for autophagy induction.
  In blue are complex members whose requirement status has not been determined. In
  gray are complex members whose role is ambiguous, with conflicting reports of induction
  requirement. ER stress-induced autophagy through SERCA inhibition (pink arrows)
  activates CAMK1/4, which then induces autophagy but not degradative autophagy. The
  roles of the ULK1/2 and BECN1 complexes have not been determined. Glucose addition
  during starvation (orange arrows) activates MAPK14, which induces autophagy, but
  the roles of the ULK1/2 and BECN1 complexes remain unknown. Starvation in DT40 cells
  (black arrow) requires RB1CC1 and ATG13 but does not require ULK1/2. Cyclic AMP
  (dark purple arrows) activates MAPK1 and cyclin E and induces autophagy through
  BECN1, although it is not certain if this pathway also activates the ULK1/2 complex.
  Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) induces ROS (light purple arrows) which activate
  JNK signaling and induce incomplete autophagy via BECN1. Human coronavirus transmembrane
  papain-like proteases (PLPs) interact with BECN1 (gray arrows) to induce incomplete
  autophagy. Ammonia (lime green arrows) induces autophagy in a ULK1/2-independent
  manner, although the role of the BECN1 complex was not assessed. Poliovirus (PV)
  induces autophagic signals (blue arrows) independently of the ULK1/2 complex, although
  the role of the BECN1 complex has not been assessed. Oleate, Rhus coriaria extract
  (RCE), and astemizole-histamine (AST-HIS) induce autophagy (brown arrow) in a BECN1-independent
  manner.
