caption: Schematic graphics illustrating the pathway of histamine (HA) synthesis,
  release, and inactivation and our interpretation on the changes in the CSF HA and
  tele‐methylhistamine (t‐MeHA) levels seen with the narcoleptic children. HA is synthetized
  solely by histidine decarboxylase (HDC) and inactivated, once released from terminals,
  by HA‐N‐methyltransferase producing the direct metabolite t‐MeHA. Bar presentation
  of HA and t‐MeHA levels is based on the values given in Table 1. Our narcoleptic
  children showed a marked increase in CSF HA, which unlikely indicates an upregulation
  of HA synthesis or/and release because of an accompanied marked decrease in t‐MeHA.
  This concomitant increase in HA and decrease in t‐MeHA lead to a remarkable decrease
  in the t‐MeHA/HA ratio (7.2 folds), indicating an abnormal accumulation or impaired
  utilization of HA. On a more functional level, our observations strongly suggest
  that HA neurotransmission is prominently affected in narcoleptic children. The confirmation
  of such impaired dynamic of the brain HA system as a causative agent in narcolepsy
  awaits further development of direct neurochemical monitoring of HA transmission
  in the human brain
