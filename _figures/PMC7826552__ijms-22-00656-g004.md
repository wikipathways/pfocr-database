caption: Schematic model of α-pinene promoting an anticancer effect via NK cell activation.
  α-Pinene stimulates ERK and AKT phosphorylation signaling pathways and leads to
  NK cell activation, which is confirmed by the increased expression of receptors
  CD56 and CD170. Consequently, the NK cell product proteins perforin and granzyme
  B are induced, leading to cancer cell death.
