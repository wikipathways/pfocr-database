caption: Complex pathological processes during PCO formation under oxidative stress.
  Lens epithelial cells (LECs) are continuously subjected to oxidative stress due
  to decreased levels of glutathione (GSH) and increased oxygen content in the aqueous
  humour following cataract surgery. Both the canonical TGF-β/Smad and Wnt/β-catenin
  signalling pathways are activated in LEC fibrosis under oxidative stress, contributing
  to PCO formation. Additionally, the ERK1/2 signalling pathway, which can be activated
  by TGF-β and oxidative stress, regulates the activation of Wnt/β-catenin, indicating
  crosstalk between the TGF-β signalling pathway and oxidative stress in PCO formation
