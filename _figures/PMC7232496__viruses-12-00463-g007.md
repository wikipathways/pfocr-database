caption: Postulated mechanism of disease resistance in cattle to PPRV—Schematic representation
  of roles of differentially expressed genes. The TLR7 mediated differential induction
  of RIG-I, DHX58, RLR and MDA5 contributes to the differential interferon levels
  which in turn modulate the viral replication across these two species. The increased
  levels of PDE12 might contribute to negative regulator of the OAS pathway in goats.
