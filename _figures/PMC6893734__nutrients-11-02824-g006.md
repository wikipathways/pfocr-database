caption: 'Schematic representation of the regulation of the autophagy-lysosome system
  in response to severe energy deficit and its modulation by exercise. An upregulation
  of numerous genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosome
  degradation pathways is seen after the CRE phase, primarily in the vastus lateralis.
  Elevated levels of cortisol with low insulin, testosterone, and leptin levels did
  not prevent increased inhibitory phosphorylation of FoxO1 and FoxO3a in the deltoid
  muscles, which was blunted by prolonged low-intensity exercise in the vastus lateralis,
  despite inactivation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway []. FoxOs orchestrate the activation
  of the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathways. Upon FoxOs
  unchanged or reduced activation, the levels of E3 ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx are not
  augmented, limiting the ubiquitin-mediated tagging of proteins for proteasomal degradation.
  The central role in the antagonistic regulation of catabolic and anabolic signals
  driven by eIF3f is not altered as a consequence of its MAFbx-dependent degradation.
  AMPK can activate FoxO3a via phosphorylation or independently stimulate degradation
  via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. A severe energy deficit induces autophagy activation
  via higher Thr172 AMPKα in all muscles, although the augmented fractional phosphorylation
  at Thr172 solely present in the deltoid muscles indicates inactivation by a large
  exercise volume in the lower extremities. AMPKα directly increases activation of
  ULK1 through phosphorylation at Ser555, an effect abrogated in the vastus lateralis
  by high-volume exercise. AMPK and ULK1 propagate downstream signaling by altering
  the regulation of the Beclin 1/Vps34 complex, whose fine integration and functioning
  is required for complete autophagosome formation. An increased phosphorylated Beclin
  1 at Ser15 can be sufficient to regulate the levels of the entire complex, and likely
  the augmented phosphorylation present only in the deltoid muscles elicits stimulation
  of autophagy induction, which was not present in the vastus lateralis. No sign of
  increased LC3BII or conversion of LC3BI to LC3BII is suggestive of an overall unchanged
  rate of autophagosome formation. The enhanced accumulation of the sequestosome 1
  (p62/SQSTM1) in all muscles but preferentially in the vastus lateralis, is supportive
  of an inhibition of autophagic flux modulated by the volume of exercise performed
  by the skeletal muscles, as p62/SQSTM1 is an acceptor of ubiquitinated substrates
  whose expression should be lowered following lysosomal degradation. The arrows included
  inside dashed grey boxes illustrate the overall protein expression changes in this
  investigation split in the deltoid muscles (mean of both arms) and vastus lateralis
  and are shown beside the specific markers. Thin arrows in green (total form) and
  black (phosphorylated form) depict the overall direction of the outcomes (increase/decrease)
  for the particular muscle group. Thick arrows in blue depict the overall effect
  on stimulation/inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome or autophagy-lysosomal degradation
  pathways. The size of the arrow is representative of the magnitude of the change.
  Activatory/inhibitory actions are represented by blue/red connecting lines (dashed
  if changes in location are present). Differentially expressed genes refer to an
  upregulation unless an asterisk (*) is placed on the gene name (downregulation).
