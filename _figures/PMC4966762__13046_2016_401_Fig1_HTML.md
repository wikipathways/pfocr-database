caption: Signaling pathways activated by ET-1 in cancer. The endothelin- 1 receptor
  (ET-1R) is a G-protein coupled receptor, that upon agonist binding, results in the
  activation of G-protein-dependent primary effectors including phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ),
  which cleaves phosphatidylinositol- 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) into diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3), leading to calcium mobilization and protein
  kinase C (PKC) activation, and downstream activation of MAPK family members, including
  ERK1/2. At the same time, ET-1R activation stimulates Ras/Raf/MEK activation, converging
  on ERK1/2 signaling. Moreover, ET-1R receptor stimulation activates phospholipase
  A (PLA) and downstream arachidonic acid (AA) and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2,
  leading to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release, as well as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K), leading to the activation of AKT, integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and glycogen
  synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, which stabilizes β-catenin. Notably, ET-1R can also signal
  via β-arrestin1 (β-arr1) to activate ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT/β-catenin signaling. β-arr1
  also controls the crosstalk between ET-1R and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  through the recruitment and activation of c-Src, resulting in downstream pathway
  activation. Through β-arr1, ET-1 activates also nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signaling
  via inhibition of NF-kB inhibitor (IkB), resulting in the dissociation and subsequent
  nuclear localization of active NF-kB. On the other hand, β-arr1 mediates ET-1-induced
  hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) activity promoting vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF) release. Moreover, ET-1R activates PDZ-RhoGEF leading to Rho-A and
  -C GTPase activation, initiating Rho-dependent signaling events through RHO-associated
  coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), LIMK activation, causing cofilin
  inhibition and cytoskeletal remodelling. The cooperation of these intracellular
  signaling pathways promote cell growth, chemoresistance, angiogenesis, cytoskeleton
  remodelling, invadopodia formation, and metastasis
