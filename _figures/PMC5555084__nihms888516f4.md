caption: (A) M1 macrophages, effector T cells and cancer cells are characterized by
  biosynthetic metabolism to support proliferation and anabolism with high rates of
  glycolysis and glutaminolysis for the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids.
  In contrast, Treg, M2 macrophages, memory T cells and quiescent cancer cells are
  primarily characterized by catabolic metabolism and utilization of fatty acid oxidation
  for ATP synthesis. (B) Activation of growth factor receptors leads to Akt-mediated
  upregulation of glucose uptake and glycolytic flux and promotes lipid synthesis.
  Proliferative signals and metabolic hues are balanced with biosynthetic metabolism
  by mTORC1, which orchestrates nucleotide and protein synthesis via ribosomal protein
  S6 kinase with progression through the cell cycle via 4EBP1. Transcription factors
  Myc, HIF1α and SREBPs mediate glutamine and glucose metabolism and promote lipid
  and cholesterol synthesis. These pathways are opposed by PTEN and AMPK which inhibit
  PI3K and mTORC1 signaling and promote fatty acid oxidation, autophagy and transcriptional
  co-activator PGC1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
