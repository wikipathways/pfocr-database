caption: A hypothetical model of gliotic responses in the experimental and contralateral
  retinas after optic nerve damage. This model assumes the interplay of 4 retinal
  cell types that interact to both induce reactivity and suppress it. In the experimental
  retina (the retina directly affected by optic nerve damage), reactive gliosis is
  principally initiated by damage to the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This leads
  to the astrocyte response which is mediated through reactive microglia. Reactive
  astrocytes then present an unknown toxic signaling environment that mediates further
  RGC damage and loss leading to a continuous loop of pathology. The cycle is finally
  broken by an unknown purinergic signaling pathway that involves the release of ATP
  from PANX1 channels. Indirect evidence suggests this process is mediated by Müller
  cells and it is unknown if the signaling is autocrine or paracrine, or both (designated
  by the question marks). In the contralateral retina, astrocyte reactivity is mediated
  not by initial RGC pathology but by signaling from an astrocyte network (yellow
  cells) that extends from the site of injury through to the contralateral optic nerve
  and is facilitated by gap junctions between these cells. We predict that the purinergic
  signaling pathway that suppresses astrocyte reactivity in the experimental retina
  is activated early in the contralateral retina to help minimize activation of the
  pathology loop between RGCs, microglia, and astrocytes.
