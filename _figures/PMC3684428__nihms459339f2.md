caption: IRE1α- and PERK-mediated cell death pathways. During endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress, inositol-requiring protein 1α (IRE1α) forms a hetero-oligomeric complex
  with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) () and apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase 1 (ASK1) () and then recruits the protein kinase JNK, leading to the activation
  of JNK (). The IRE1α-TRAF2 complex recruits IκB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates
  inhibitor of κB (IκB), leading to the degradation of IκB and the nuclear translocation
  of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) (). IRE1α
  also modulates the activation of other “alarm genes,” such as p38 and ERK (), possibly
  by the binding of the Src homology (SH) 2/3 -containing adaptor proteins Nck and
  TRAF2, respectively. Furthermore, several proapoptotic (i.e., BAX/BAK, AIP1, and
  maybe PTP-1B) or antiapoptotic proteins (i.e., BI-1) interact with IRE1α, regulating
  its activation state (–). Thus, the formation of a macromolecular signaling complex
  of IRE1α with several proapoptotic proteins can generate apoptotic signals and establish
  an apoptotic environment. In addition, the endoribonuclease activity of IRE1α, aside
  from specific cleavage of Xbp1 mRNA, degrades ER-targeted mRNAs that can decrease
  cellular functions, such as proinsulin synthesis in β-cells. In contrast to the
  adaptive response by the PERK-phosphorylated eIF2α-ATF4 pathway, this pathway also
  contributes to stress-induced cell death by ATF4-mediated induction of proapoptotic
  genes, including CHOP, ATF3, and GADD34 (). The induced transcription factor CHOP
  contributes to increased expression of the proapoptotic factors, such as death receptor
  5 (DR5) (), tribbles-related protein 3 (Trb3) (), and binding to microtubule (Bim)
  (), and it can suppress B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) expression. Bim is also activated
  through protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation, which prevents its ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation (). PERK-mediated translational attenuation upregulates
  NF-κB-dependent transcription because IκB has a shorter half-life than NF-κB, so
  NF-κB is released to translocate to the nucleus (). Recovery from translational
  repression is mediated by eIF2α dephosphorylation by the two regulatory subunits
  of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), GADD34 and CReP (constitutive repressor of eIF2α
  phosphorylation) (). GADD34 is induced transcriptionally during ER stress by ATF4,
  whereas CreP is a constitutive activator of PP1. The premature dephosphorylation
  of eIF2α by the GADD34-PP1 complex restores translation of general mRNAs, which
  may be detrimental if the ER protein-folding defect is not resolved.
