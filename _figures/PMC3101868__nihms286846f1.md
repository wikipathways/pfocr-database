caption: The extrinsic or cellular injury pathway is mediated by the binding of F.VIIa
  to tissue factor (TF) and the TF:F.VIIa complex in turn activates both F.X and F.IX.
  In the intrinsic or contact system, coagulation is initiated through high-molecular-weight
  kininogen (HMWK), prekallikrein (PK), and F.XII activation, which in turn activates
  F.XI, which then activates F.IX. F.VIIIa functions as a cofactor and significantly
  accelerates activation of F.X to F.Xa by F.IXa. Once activated, F.Xa participates
  in the prothrombinase complex (F.Xa:F.Va), which, in the presence of calcium (Ca2+)
  and phospholipids (PL), converts prothrombin (F.II) to thrombin. The latter, in
  turn, cleaves fibrinogen to soluble fibrin monomers that are cross linked by F.XIIIa
  to form a hemostatic plug or clot. Deficiency of F.VIII (hemophilia A) or F.IX (hemophilia
  B) results in impaired activation of F.X and downstream activation of thrombin and
  fibrin formation. Black arrow = conversion or activation of factor or cofactor function;
  red arrows = action of inhibitors; purple arrows = various functions of thrombin.
  TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor.
