caption: 'Diagrammatic presentation of Huntington Disease progression and protection
  of neurons with phytochemicals: 6-35 CAG repeats lead to the formation of Huntingtin
  protein which consequently accumulates in the neurons and damage motor neurons.
  In the early stage, damaged motor neurons result in short term memory while on a
  later stage, this condition changes into depression, weight loss, and many more.
  The studied phytochemicals generally work against free radicals and restrict the
  accumulation of Huntingtin protein in the cells. This inhibition further leads to
  neuronal survival. Resveratrol works on LC3 lipidation while protopanaxtriol and
  viniferin leads to the antioxidative pathway and restore the function of mitochondria
  to protect the neurons and stop further accumulation of Huntingtin protein in neurons.'
