caption: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as a promoter in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) related
  neurodegeneration. LPA can elevate the binding activity of cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB) with β-site of amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme (β-secretase,
  BACE 1) promoter at the CRE site through the Gα/i-PKCδ–MEK–MAPK–p90RSK–CREB signaling
  pathway. Overexpressed BACE 1 with γ-secretase then acts as the processing enzymes
  to cleave APP and produce Aβ monomers, thus leading to the dynamic polymerization
  and depolymerization of Aβ, as well as the AD-related pathology. Excessive activation
  of LPA mediated Gα12/13-RhoA/Rock-GSK3β pathway also results in the hyperphosphorylation
  of Tau, as well as the subsequent disorganization of microtubule (MT). The hyperphosphorylated
  Tau protein can be further polymerized to form intracellular NFT deposits, which
  are considered as another hallmark of AD. Moreover, microglia are also activated
  in AD-related pathogenesis. Astrocytes become stimulated and transform into their
  A1 phase. The active A1 astrocytes promote the secretion of complement-contained
  exosomes to mediate neurological damage via the complement pathway. Microglia combines
  with toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomer and fibrils through pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs) and initiates the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as iNOS, TNF-α,
  IL-1β, and IL-6.
