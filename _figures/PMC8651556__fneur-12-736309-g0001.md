caption: A diagram of homocysteine (Hcy) and methionine metabolism. Three pathways
  involved in Hcy meatabolism, including remethylation pathway, transsulfuration pathway,
  and a small amount of Hcy released directly into the extracellular fluid. When a
  deficiency of MTHFR, CBS, MS, or B-vitamins occurs, an excess of homocysteine enters
  the blood, causing HHcy, resulting in damage to the corresponding target organs.
  SAM is the only donor of methyl in all of the metabolic pathways. HHcy leads to
  hypomethylation of biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which
  contributes to metabolic abnormalities and promotes disease occurrence.
