caption: Proposed signaling mechanism for the effects of amlexanox on LPS-induced
  neuroinflammation in BV2 microglial cells. Activation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4)
  with LPS leads to activation of IKKε, MAPKs, AKT, NF-κB complex, and STAT3. Amlexanox
  (a TBK1/IKKε selective inhibitor) can either directly or indirectly (via AKT and
  p38 MAPK) attenuate NF-κB activity. Inhibition of TBK/IKKε could also impair STAT3
  signaling pathway, which further attenuates neurotoxic factors. The figure was created
