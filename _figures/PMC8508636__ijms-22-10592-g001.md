caption: Some representative pathways of the involvement of m6A writers, readers and
  erasers in lung cancer. (A) METTL3 regulates YAP oncogene via direct m6A modification
  of its 5′-end allowing its YTHDF1/3-dependent enhancement of translation, and via
  indirect way by m6A-mediated stabilization of MALAT1 lncRNA, which in its turn sponges
  YAP-targeting miR-1914-3p. (B) METTL3-dependent deposition of m6A at 3′-UTR of G6PD-encoding
  mRNA enhances its translation via YTHDF2-dependent eIF2 recruitment leading to pro-oncogenic
  activation of the pentose phosphate pathway. (C) ALKBH5 demethylates TIMP3 and FOXM1
  oncogenic mRNAs, causing increased stability of the former and increased translation
  of the latter.
