caption: Suppression of IFNs-α/β production and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression
  during infection by various animal viruses. IFN suppression-deficient viruses have
  been constructed, and their immunological and clinical outcomes have been examined
  in their natural host animal species. Vertical arrow (dotted line) divides the IFN
  signaling to “IFN production pathway” (left) and “IFN signaling JAK-STAT pathway”
  (right). Bars (red) indicate sites of action by specific viral proteins for IFN
  suppression. FMDV, foot-and-mouth disease virus (–); PEDV, porcine epidemic diarrhea
  virus (); MeV, measles virus (–); PRRSV, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
  virus (–); WNV, West Nile virus (); ZIKV, Zika virus (); DENV, Dengue virus ();
  BRSV, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (–); RSV, respiratory syncytial virus (,
  ); IRF, interferon regulatory factor; ISRE, interferon stimulation response element;
  STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. Images were created with
