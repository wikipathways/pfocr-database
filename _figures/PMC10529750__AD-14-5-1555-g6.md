caption: Oxidative stress mediates exercise to regulate bone homeostasis. A) Low concentrations
  of ROS act as signaling molecules to maintain bone homeostasis and the balance between
  osteoblasts and osteoclasts, promote stress resistance processes, such as the induction
  of the antioxidant defense system, reduce the incidence of stress-related diseases
  and delay the aging process. High concentrations of ROS play an important role in
  the pathological changes during the progression of OP. Excessive ROS production
  can enhance the responsiveness of osteoclast precursors to RANKL, stimulating M-CSF
  and RANKL expression and increasing the RANKL/OPG ratio. Activation of the differentiation
  of osteoclast precursor cells increases the number and activity of osteoclasts and
  enhances the activity of bone resorption. An increase in ROS production inhibits
  the expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway but activates the expression
  of PPARγ and supports adipogenesis at the expense of osteoblastic genesis. Inhibiting
  the differentiation of osteoblasts and inducing the apoptosis of osteoblasts and
  osteocytes inhibits bone formation. B) Moderate regular exercise can improve the
  body's antioxidant defense ability and inhibit excessive ROS. Exercise has a prevention
  and treatment effect on OP caused by many factors, including age-associated OP,
  postmenopausal OP, and type 2 diabetes-associated OP. In addition, among bone health
  problems caused by some special factors, such as fluorosis and SOD2 deficiency,
  exercise has also been confirmed to play a good therapeutic role and protect bone
  from oxidative stress damage. C) Exercise-induced muscle factors regulate the link
  between oxidative stress and bone homeostasis. Irisin and BAIBA are secreted by
  skeletal muscle during exercise. Irisin upregulates SIRT3 expression, reduces excessive
  oxidative stress and improves mitochondrial autophagy in ASCs thereby improving
  the osteogenic differentiation activity of ASCs.BAIBA signals through MRGPRD, to
  inhibit mitochondrial breakdown in osteocytes, thereby protecting osteocytes from
  ROS-induced apoptosis.
