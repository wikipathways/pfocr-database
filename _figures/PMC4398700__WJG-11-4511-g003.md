caption: 'Ingenuity® Pathways Analysis reveals a possible network of genes activated
  in IEC-6 cells upon induction of the ephrin-B pathway. Three hundred and thirty-one
  regulated genes with changed -P values lower than 0.003 and higher than 0.997 were
  selected and entered the Ingenuity®pathway analysis. The displayed network features
  only genes with functional interactions. Many of those genes are associated with
  cellular growth, proliferation and control of cell death. Arrows pointing from one
  gene to another indicate that one causes activation of the other one (includes any
  direct interaction: e.g. binding, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, etc.). For
  ligands/receptors arrows pointing from a ligand to a receptor signify that the ligand
  binds the receptor and subsequently leads to activation of the receptor. The respective
  fold-changes are given below the gene symbols. Further abbreviations are: A, Activation/deactivation;
  B, Binding; E, Expression; M, Biochemical Modification; P, Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation;
  T, Transcription; 1Duplicate-user input gene that had duplicate identifiers in the
  dataset file mapping to a single gene in the Ingenuity® Pathways Knowledge Base.
  + Indicates there are other networks from the analysis that contain this gene. Gene
