caption: MYC regulation of essential amino acid and lipid metabolism. MYC activates
  critical transporters, SLC7A5, SLC43A1, and SLC1A5, to promote essential amino acid
  transport. BCAT1, which catalyzes the decomposition of branched amino acids, is
  a downstream target of MYC. MYC promotes tryptophan uptake and metabolism by the
  kynurenine pathway. MYC coordinates glucose, glutamine, and essential amino acid
  metabolism to promote fatty acid biosynthesis. Enzymes labeled in red are upregulated
  by MYC. ACC acetyl-coA carboxylase, ACLY ATP citrate lyase, AFMID arylformamidase,
  BCAA branched-chain amino acid BCAT branched-chain aminotransferase, BCKA branched-chain
  α-keto acid, FA fatty acid, FASN fatty acid synthase, Fum fumarate, His histidine,
