caption: The transfer of information from neurons to astrocytes, and the reverse process,
  are schematically separated by a dashed line. Top, Neurons alter astrocytic [Cl−]i
  through the release of both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Glutamate
  uptake through the Na+/K+-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters EAAT1 and
  EAAT2, gates the Cl− permeability pore. Additionally, glutamate, ATP and several
  other signaling molecules activate GPCR pathways (such as mGluR receptors) and stimulate
  Cl− uptake via NKCC1. Uptake of the inhibitory transmitter GABA through the GABA
  transporters, GAT-1 or GAT-3, is stoichiometrically associated with the symport
  of 2 Na+ and one Cl−. Bottom, Astrocytes directly modify neuronal [Cl−]i via release
  of the gliotransmitters, GABA and taurine, which subsequently activate Cl− fluxes
  through the neuronal GABAA and glycine receptor (GlyR) channels. The main pathway
  for astrocytic GABA and taurine release is thought to be the volume-regulated anion
  channel (VRAC), but other release mechanisms also exist. See text for additional
  details.
