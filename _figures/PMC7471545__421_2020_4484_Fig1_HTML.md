caption: 'Physical activity and anti-inflammatory response in SARS-CoV2 infection.
  Regular physical activity may reduce the acute inflammatory response through at
  least five mechanisms: (1) by reducing the inflammatory signalling pathway mediated
  by TLRs; (2) by increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-37 which
  could inhibit the TLR-inflammatory signalling cascade and mitigate the inflammatory
  action produced by the inflammasome; (3) by reducing lung inflammation through the
  activation of AMPK and promoting the conversion from Ang II to Ang 1–7; (4) presumably,
  by the activation of ACE2-Mas receptor vasodilator pathway, reducing lung inflammation
  and promoting some beneficial multi-organ effects; (5) most probably, by restoring
  nitric oxide (NO) levels, in order to counteract the endothelial dysfunction, thus
  contributing to pulmonary vasodilation and antithrombotic activity'
