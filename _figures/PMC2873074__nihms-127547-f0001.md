caption: Following gut ischemia/reperfusion (IR), the proinflammatory transcription
  factor, AP-1, is increased, as is the downstream, proinflammatory enzyme iNOS. Both
  are associated with gut inflammation, mucosal injury, and dysfunction. When the
  enteral nutrient, arginine, is added to the hypoperfused gut, iNOS expression and
  AP-1 DNA-binding activity are further increased. Arginine is a known precursor to
  iNOS, but the mechanism by which arginine increases AP-1 is unknown. There is a
  recently described, NO-mediated protein kinase G pathway that may explain the increase
  in AP-1 by arginine. PPARγ is believed to inhibit the proinflammatory pathway at
  the level of AP-1, protecting the hypoperfused gut. Glutamine increases PPARγ DNA-binding
  activity and may be a novel PPARγ agonist. When PPAR γ is activated, it heterodimerizes
  with the retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and then binds to the peroxisome proliferator
  response element (PPRE), resulting in target gene expression.
