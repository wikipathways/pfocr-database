caption: 'Schematic diagram on transcript abundance changes of FA synthesis and TAG
  accumulation pathway genes between mutant cC14TE_B3 and wild-type D. tertiolecta.
  Blocks of four squares represent the log2 fold change (cC14TE_B3/wild-type) under
  nitrogen-replete (+N) condition, (cC14TE_B3/wild-type) under nitrogen-deplete (–N)
  condition, (–N/+N) in cC14TE_B3, and (–N/+N) in wild-type. Dotted lines represent
  Pearson’s correlation analysis (0.75 ≥ r ≤ –0.75) between transcript expression
  levels and total percentages of MCFAs per total lipids DCW. Compounds include: ACP,
  acyl carrier protein; CoA, coenzyme A; FFA, free fatty acid; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  TAG, triacylglycerol. Enzymes include: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; DGAT, diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase; ENR, enoyl-ACP reductase; FAT, acyl-ACP thioesterase; GPAT, G3P
  acyltransferase; HD, hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase; KAR, ketoacyl-ACP reductase; KAS,
  ketoacyl-ACP synthase; LPAAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase; MAT, malonyl-CoA-ACP
  transacylase; Δ6D, Δ6-desaturase; Δ9D, stearoyl-CoA-9-desaturase; Δ12D, oleoyl-CoA-12-desaturase;
  Ω3D, Ω3-desaturase.'
