caption: FLS2 (flagellin sensing 2) signalling pathway in Arabidopsis. The transcription,
  translation and maturation of FLS2, the Arabidopsis receptor of bacterial flagellin
  (flg22), require EIN3 (ethylene insensitive 3)/EIL1 (ethylene insensitive 3‐like
  1) (Boutrot et al., ; Mersmann et al., ), GRP7 (glycine‐rich protein 7) (Nicaise
  et al., ), endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐resident reticulon‐like proteins RTNLB1/RTNLB2
  (Lee et al., ) and RABA1b (Ras genes from rat brain a1b) (Choi et al., ). FLS2 constitutively
  interacts with BIK1 (Botrytis‐induced kinase 1) and BSK1 (BR‐signalling kinase 1)
  (Shi et al., ), two receptor‐like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) that positively regulate
  FLS2 signalling, and SCD1 (stomatal cytokinesis‐defective 1) required for certain
  FLS2 responses (Korasick et al., ). BAK1 (brassinosteroid‐insensitive 1‐associated
  kinase 1) constitutively interacts with BIK1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligases PUB12/13.
  Binding of flg22 probably causes conformational change of FLS2, which further recruits
  BAK1 to the complex. The dimerization of FLS2/BAK1 leads to the phosphorylation
  of the FLS2/BAK1/BIK1 complex, and subsequent release of BIK1. Rapid Ca2+ influx,
  an oxidative burst mediated by plasma membrane (PM)‐resident NADPH‐oxidase Rboh,
  and activation of mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) and calcium‐dependent
  protein kinase (CDPK) cascades collectively activate and amplify the defence gene
  reprogramming and other defence responses. PUB12/13 are phosphorylated by BAK1 and
  interact with FLS2 on flg22 perception, thereby promoting poly‐ubiquitination of
  FLS2 to tune down the signalling. PUB22/23/24 poly‐ubiquitinate Exo70B, a subunit
  of the exocyst complex, for 26S proteasome degradation to down‐regulate defence
  signalling. EE, early endosome; MEKK, MAPK kinase kinase; MKK, MAPK kinase; MPK,
  MAP kinase (MAPK); TGN, trans‐Golgi network; Ub, ubiquitin.
