caption: Src family kinase signaling in renal fibrosis. Injury to the kidney induces
  Src activation that leads to epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation.
  Activated EGFR triggers overproduction of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and
  subsequent activation of Smad3 signaling, a key profibrotic pathway responsible
  for activation and proliferation of renal fibroblasts and deposition of extracellular
  matrix proteins. Smad3 also mediates Hck-induced renal fibrosis, and signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is required for Src- and Fyn-stimulated
  profibrotic responses in the kidney.
