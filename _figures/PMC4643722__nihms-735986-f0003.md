caption: (A) Organisation of the proteins involved in the primary (proximal) and secondary
  (distal) events in the amyloid cascade hypothesis []. According to this hypothesis
  the initial aggregation of Aβ triggers a series of proximal events (inner ring,
  blue scale), which is then followed by another series of distal events involving
  proteins in the same networks (outer ring, grey scale). Supersaturation scores are
  scaled from green (low scores) to red (high scores). (B) Supersaturated proteins
  (in red) in the KEGG `Alzheimer's disease pathway'. Some of these pathways (blue
  boxes), such as the processing of APP (I), the presenilins (II), apolipoprotein
  E (III) and tau (IV) are known to be linked to genetic perturbations that drive
  the disease (inner ring in panel A). In addition to these factors, which are proximal
  to the primary cause of cellular toxicity, other major pathways, such as oxidative
  phosphorylation (V, grey box) and endoplasmic reticulum function are distal to the
  causes. Supersaturated proteins populate both those processes that are tied to the
  primary aggregation events (I–IV) and those that are likely the result of it (V).
