caption: De novo purine biosynthetic pathway in humans. In eukaryotes, purines are
  synthesized in 10 chemical steps that are catalyzed by six enzymes (shown in bold).
  The six enzymes are phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), a trifunctional
  enzyme (TGART) that is composed of glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase (GARS),
  GAR formyltransferase (GART) and aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase (AIRS),
  formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase (FGAMS), a bifunctional enzyme (PAICS)
  that is composed of carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthase (CAIRS) and succinoaminoimidazolecarboxamide
  ribonucleotide synthetase (SAICARS), adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL), and a bifunctional
  enzyme (ATIC) that is composed of aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase
  (AICART) and inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (IMPCH).
