caption: 'Mechanisms of organelle dysfunction in cholesterol overload. (A) Overview
  of organelle cholesterol loading. Cholesterol entering the hepatocyte through LDL
  particles binds to the LDLR receptors and undergoes receptor‐mediated endocytosis.
  That cholesterol is then trafficked through the late endosome and lysosome, and
  ultimately is transferred to different cellular organelles. NPC1 mediates transfer
  of cholesterol to lipid droplets, where it is stored; however, FC can form cholesterol
  crystals within the LDs. StAR/MLN64 transfers cholesterol from the lysosome to the
  mitochondria (or StAR can transfer cholesterol from the LD to the mitochondria),
  where it is typically used for synthesis of steroidogenic signaling molecules; however,
  it can also be deposited into the mitochondrial membrane and interfere with the
  function of 2‐Oxo. NPC1/2 mediates transfer of cholesterol from the lysosome to
  the ER, where high cholesterol membrane content causes disruption of the calcium
  pump SERCA, decreasing the concentration of calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum
  lumen. FC in the cell can react with ROS through CYP450 enzymes and form oxysterols,
  which increases nuclear NF‐κB signaling. (B) ER stress. Excess cholesterol in the
  ER leads to dysfunction of SERCA, lowers the luminal calcium concentration (stimulating
  the UPR), activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, and pyroptosis. (C) Mitochondrial dysfunction.
  Cholesterol loading in the mitochondrial interferes with 2‐Oxo function, which depletes
  the mitochondrial glutathione pool, resulting in ROS generation, lipid peroxidation,
  release of cytochrome C, and trigger of apoptosis. Excessive ROS generation for
  cholesterol overload leads to the generation of toxic oxysterols, which triggers
  inflammatory signaling through NF‐κB. (D) LD cholesterol crystallization and activation
  of inflammatory cells. Excessive FC in hepatocyte LDs leads to the formation of
  cholesterol crystal in the periphery of the LDs. LD cholesterol deposition results
  in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which results in release of IL‐1β, causing
  pyroptosis or necrosis. Processing of these cholesterol crystals by activated KC
  in crown‐like structures causes release of proinflammatory signaling molecules,
  specifically IL‐1B, IL‐18, TGF‐β, and MCP1, which recruits immune cells to the liver
  and transforms HSCs into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts elaborate collagen, which
  deposits in the liver and leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis. (E) The TAZ Pathway.
  FC accumulated on the plasma membrane gets internalized by ASTER B/C, which activates
  sAC. Elevations in cAMP levels results in phosphorylation of IP3R through PKA and
  causes release of Ca from the ER lumen. Elevated cytosolic Ca levels activates RhoA,
  which inhibits LATS1/2 through phosphorylation. LATS1/2 is unable to phosphorylate
  TAZ, and the dephosphorylated TAZ (active form) translocates to the nucleus to induce
  transcription of Ihh. Ihh is secreted out of the hepatocyte and is then able to
  induce profibrotic mRNA in HSCs, resulting in hepatic fibrosis. Abbreviations: AMP,
  adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; Ca, calcium; cAMP, cyclic
