caption: DTT causes upregulation of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase
  gene rips-1. On low vitamin B12 diet, DTT leads to the depletion of SAM that results
  in toxicity. Supplementation of vitamin B12 and methionine attenuates DTT toxicity
  by restoring SAM levels. Supplementation of choline also rescues DTT toxicity by
  repleting phosphatidylcholine via an SAM-independent pathway.
