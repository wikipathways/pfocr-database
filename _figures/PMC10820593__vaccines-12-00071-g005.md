caption: Common adjuvants and proposed mechanisms. (A) The CpG motifs stimulate TLRs,
  which activate signal transduction cascades, leading to nuclear upregulation of
  cytokines which stimulate immune cell response; most famously, the STING pathway.
  (B) Oil emulsions stimulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling pathway,
  which upregulates inflammatory cytokines, like interleukin-6 (IL-6), which activate
  and potentiate immune cells. (C) DNA stimulates signal transduction cascade, which
  upregulates transcription of inflammatory genes. (D) Aluminum causes inflammation
  and stimulates a release of ATP and DNA from injured cells, which activate DCs and
  macrophages. (E) Aluminum also stimulates inflammasomes. (F) Gene Adjuvants are
  immunostimulatory genes added to the plasmid for transcription within the cell (or
  can be delivered as separate plasmids alongside the vaccine), which are transcribed
  with the antigenic gene and work to potentiate immune cell response. Created with
