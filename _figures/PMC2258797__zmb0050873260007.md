caption: Transcription elongation controlled by P-TEFb, NELF, and DSIF through the
  MEK1-ERK signaling pathway. TRH stimulation activates the MEK1-ERK signaling pathway,
  resulting in up-regulation of nuclear CDK9 and cyclin T1/CDK9 complex (i.e., P-TEFb).
  This up-regulation may be caused by stabilization or translocation of CDK9. The
  up-regulated P-TEFb is subsequently recruited on IEGs (c-fos, junB, MKP-1, etc.),
  probably through transcription activators or chromatin-associated proteins. On IEGs,
  P-TEFb phosphorylates CTR of Spt5, NELF, and CTD Ser-2 of Pol II, favoring transcription
  elongation and maturation of mRNA by the Pol II complex associated with P-TEFb and
  DSIF.
