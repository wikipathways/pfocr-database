caption: Feedback loop of the alternative pathway. Following the attachment of C3b
  to its target, a feedback loop can be engaged via interactions with the two proteases,
  factor B (FB) and factor D (FD), to form the AP C3 convertase. The binding of properdin
  (P) stabilizes the complex (i.e., its half-life is increased from 30–40 s to 3–4 min).
  Within a few minutes, more than one million C3bs can be generated and bound to a
  single bacterium
