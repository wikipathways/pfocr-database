caption: A metabolic pathway map showed the changed metabolites and their related
  pathway in model group or after XBJ treatment. The metabolic pathway networks related
  to the different metabolites between sepsis-induced acute lung injury and XBJ treatment
  groups. Red biomarkers in the networks are upregulated and the green ones are downregulated.
