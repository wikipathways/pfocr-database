caption: Cell–cell communication and partial EMT. (A) Coupling of EMT circuit with
  Notch circuit. Notch pathway, when activated by Jagged or Delta, belonging to neighboring
  cell, can activate Jagged and Notch, but inhibit Delta. EMT circuit couples with
  Notch circuit in many ways – miR-200 inhibits Jagged1, miR-34 inhibits both Notch
  and Delta, and NICD can activate SNAIL to drive EMT. (B) Notch-Delta signaling between
  two cells induces opposite fates in them – one cell behaves as a Sender (high Delta,
  low Notch) and the other a Receiver (high Notch, low Delta). Due to this lateral
  inhibition, it can promote “salt-and-pepper” based patterns. (C) Notch-Jagged signaling
  between two cells induces similar fates in them – lateral induction – and thus leads
  to patterns with all cells with the same fate. (D) (Left) cells in a partial EMT
  and interacting via N-D signaling might not be spatially close to each other, because
  N-D signaling inhibits two neighbors to adopt the same fate. (right) Cells in a
  partial EMT and interacting via N-J signaling can mutually stabilize the E/M phenotype
  and stay together as a cluster. Figure adapted from Ref. ().
