caption: The proposed mechanism by which GPF inhibits osteoclastogenesis. Binding
  of RANKL to its receptor RANK, results in the recruitment of TRAF, following by
  the activation of MAPK and NF-κB pathways and the subsequent self-amplification
  of NFATc1. As a result, several osteoclast-specific genes, including c-Fos, Acp5,
  and NFATc1 are upregulated. These signaling events are regulated by RANKL-activated
  ROS signaling. Our results indicated that GPF can inhibit osteoclast formation and
  bone resorption via suppressing MAPK (ERK and JNK)/c-Fos/NFATc1 signaling pathways
  and scavenging ROS activities.
