caption: Pathway scheme of Caco-2 response to X-rays. Illustration with the proposed
  reconstruction of the chain of events started by radiation exposure of Caco-2 cells
  at a molecular level, starting from initial DNA damage and including several proteins
  involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly focusing on the G2/M transition.
