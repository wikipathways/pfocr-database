caption: 'A: The TRAP network construction workflow is shown. A human gene expression
  compendium of over 3,500 expression profiles was compiled. Druggable genes were
  defined using DGIdb and canonical pathways using the C2.CP gene sets from MSigDB.
  Mutual Information was calculated for all druggable genes/canonical pathway pairs;
  significant relationships define the edges in the TRAP network, which is the background
  model that defines how druggable genes are connected to pathways. See  section for
  more detail.B: TCGA patient tumors with co-loss of CHD1 & MAP3K7 were used to identify
  significantly up-regulated pathways. These pathways and their direct druggable gene
  neighbors were selected from the TRAP network and the most centrally located genes
  were identified.C: The top 20 druggable target genes are shown. Network centrality
  from the TRAP analysis, the log-fold change between TCGA patients with co-loss of
  CHD1 & MAP3K7 and those diploid at CHD1 & MAP3K7, and the log-fold change between
  WFU3 shDouble and shCtrl..D: Dose-response curves of candidate drugs in cell growth
  of WFU3 shControl (black) versus shDouble (red). Cells were treated with each drug
  for 48hr and cell growth was assessed by % confluence of each well in IncuCyte Zoom.
  Data are shown by mean and SE (n=3–5 per group). These results are representative
  of three independent experiments.'
