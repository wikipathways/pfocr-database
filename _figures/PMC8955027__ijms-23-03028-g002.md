caption: Changes in central carbon metabolism of HSPC upon aging (modified from Hennrich
  et al. []). (a) Glucose metabolism pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  are depicted. The respective enzymes are shown in capital letters and the color
  encodes for changes upon aging. Glycogen is broken down and the products are fed
  into glycolysis. Glucose-6 phosphate is metabolized to dihydroxyacetone-phosphate
  (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P). The enzymes GPD2 and DAK that feed
  the pool of DHAP and GA3P increase upon aging as well as TALDO1. (b) A specific
  set of enzymes involved in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids increase
  in abundance with age. (c) Volcano plots of all proteins quantified in the respective
  cell populations. The elevation of enzymes involved in the central carbon metabolism
  is found only in the HSPC.
