caption: 'Strategies to enhance CAR-T cell therapy for CNS tumors. Combination with
  checkpoint blockade therapy: blocking the interaction between PD-1 on CAR-T cells
  and PD-L1 on tumor cells, preventing T cell exhaustion and enhancing antitumor activity.
  Secretion of cytokines: CAR-T cells secrete cytokines such as IL-12, IL-15, IL-18,
  IL-7, and CCL-19 to improve T cell proliferation and tumor infiltration. Use of
  stem-like T cells: Incorporating stem-like (TSCM) and central memory (TCM) T cells
  in CAR-T therapy, which have self-renewal and long-term antitumor potential. Optimising
  targets: Targeting tumor cells with multiple antigens to overcome antigen heterogeneity
  and prevent tumor escape. Improving CAR-T cell delivery pathways: CAR-T cells are
  delivered through intravenous routes (with challenges posed by the blood-brain barrier)
  and local administration methods such as intraventricular or intra-tumoral injections,
  increasing T cell infiltration and reducing systemic side effects'
