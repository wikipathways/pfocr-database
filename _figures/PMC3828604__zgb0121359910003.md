caption: Activation of cytoplasmic RLRs by viral RNA leads to IRF3- and -7-mediated
  induction of type I IFNs via the IPS-1–TRAF3–TBK1 pathway. DNA-PK, a DDR protein,
  can also act as a cytoplasmic PRR to induce expression of type I IFNs. IPS-1-activated
  RIP-1 also induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by activating the
  NF-κB pathway. The recognition of bacterial peptidoglycans by the NLRs Nod1 and
  -2 upregulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines via activation of NF-κB
  and MKK pathways. Cytoplasmic NLRPs induce activation of inflammasomes via ASC and
  caspases and is essential for processing of procytokines into their active forms.
  The crosstalk of stress proteins generated by oxidative stress (yellow), heat shock
  response (green), UPR (blue), DDR (pink) and cytoplasmic PRR signaling is illustrated.
