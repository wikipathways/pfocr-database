caption: 'Therapeutic approaches in Alzheimer''s disease: GSK3 Inactivation therapy:
  Neuroprotective compounds such as curcumin modulates PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway, leading
  to inactivation of tau hyperphosphorylation. Rechaperoning therapy: Modulation of
  HSPGs-Aβ interaction by heparanase; PPIases (Peptidyl-prolylcis/trans isomerases
  (PPIases) catalyzes the tau and APP from cis to trans forms, perturbing the amylodogenesis
  of Aβ. Antioxidant and Deacetylation Therapy: Resveratrol activates AMPK pathway
  which is in turn activates SIRT1, preventing tau from hyperphosphorylation by deacetylation.
  Hormonal therapy: E2(17β-estradiol) modulates the APP processing by activation of
  estrogen receptor β; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/γ-secretase
  modulators (GSMs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) agonists
  regulate β-secretase by triggering APP through activated immune response. Metal
  chelating agents (Cloquinol, Cu, Zn, and Fe) are used to prevent the Aβ aggregation
  and amyloid formation. Cell cycle therapy: Cdk5 inhibitor functions as a neuroprotectant
  by preventing the proteolysis of p35–p25 pathogenic form. Cholinesterase inhibitor
  drugs maintain the level of acetylcholine in neuronal cells by inhibiting the enzymes
  from breakdown of the acetylcholine. Immunotherapy: Active and passive immunization
  is achieved against AD by using Aβ-42 with an adjuvant and anti-Aβ-42 (Sc-Fv&mAB),
  respectively. mTOR inhibitors: Rapamycin/rapalogs inhibit mTOR activity which in
  turn inhibits AD progression by suppressing hyperphosphorylation of tau and by promoting
  autophagy.'
