caption: Differentially expressed gene enrichment of the top scored pathway maps.
  The most significant signaling pathway map for Apoptosis and survival-Endoplasmic
  reticulum stress response pathway was additionally enriched with differentially
  expressed genes from the Immune response-IL-1 signaling pathway. Enrichment and
  pathway analyses were conducted using the MetaCore pathway/network analysis ().
  Experimental data were linked to and visualized on the maps as thermometer-like
  figures. Upward thermometers have red color and indicate upregulated signals. For
