caption: Representative summary of the non-glycolytic roles of GAPDH. (1) GAPDH interaction
  with microtubule helps in microtubular dynamics. (2) GAPDH favors actin polymerization.
  (3) GAPDH acts as chaperone with endogenous and exogenous heme. (4) GAPDH phosphorylation
  is involved in early secretory pathway transport. (5) In response to glucose deprivation,
  activated AMPK phosphorylates GAPDH in the cytosol inducing GAPDH translocation
  to the nucleus and its binding with SIRT1 promoting autophagy. (6) GAPDH phosphorylation
  by AKT blocks the translocation of the enzyme to the nucleus. (7) In the nucleus,
  GAPDH binds to PARP1 or damaged DNA to induce DNA repair. (8) SNO-GAPDH binds Siah1
  and the complex translocates into the nucleus inducing cell death related genes.
  (9) GAPDH glycolytic activity can be inhibited by S-thiolation increasing respiratory
  cellular metabolism. (10) GAPDH binds VDAC1 channel favoring apoptosis by releasing
  cytochrome c and AIF.
