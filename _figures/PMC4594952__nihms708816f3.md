caption: 'A. Wnt signaling pathway: Wnt proteins are secreted glycoproteins or ligands
  that transduces extracellular message to intracellular signaling cascade by binding
  through frizzled receptors. In the absence of this ligand (off state), β-catenin
  is sequestered by a complex of molecules such as Axin1, 2/APC/CK1α and GSK-3β, which
  is commonly known as destruction complex. Phosphorylation of β-catenin within this
  complex leads to ubiquitin and proteosomal mediated degradation process. In the
  presence of WNT ligand (on state), WNT protein binds to frizzled receptors along
  with its LRP5/6 co-receptor complex leading to activation of cytosolic phosphoprotein
  disheveled (DSH) resulting in interruption of the destruction complex. The activated
  DSH will inhibit GSK-3β activity which in turn leads to cytosolic accumulation of
  β-catenin, subsequently leading to nuclear translocation resulting in target genes
  activation. In normal stem cells, the Wnt pathway signaling causes activation of
  its target genes such as OCT4, Nanog and Sox-2 leading to maintenance of self-renewal
  property []. In addition, Wnt pathway is inhibited by Dickkopf 1 ((DKK1), a soluble
  Wnt inhibitor) resulting in reduction of stem cell population []. B. Shh signaling
  pathway: Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted and lipid modified ligand that binds
  to a transmembrane spanning receptor known as patched (Patch) leading to subsequent
  signal transduction events. In the absence of Shh ligand, Patch will constitutively
  repress smoothened (smo), another transmembrane spanning protein, having homology
  similar to G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Upon Shh ligand binding to Patch,
  smo inhibition by patch will be released, which subsequently leads to activation
  of downstream GLI (GLI1, 2, 3) family of transcription factors. In pancreatic cancer
  cells, GLI transcription factor activation leads to subsequent upregulation of Shh
  target genes such as FoxM1, Nanog, OCT4 and Sox2 [–]. These markers play a major
  role in the self-renewal nature of pancreatic cancer stem cells. C. Notch signaling
  pathway: Inpancreatic cancer stem cells, notch signaling cascade plays a vital role
  in stem cell maintenance and differentiation process. Notch receptor is composed
  of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane spanning region
  and intracellular domain. Activation of notch signaling takes place through binding
  of delta ligand with notch receptor between neighboring cells. Upon ligand binding
  to notch receptor, it will undergo a conformational change that allows cleavage
  at extracellular portion of notch by a metalloprotease TNFα converting enzyme (TACE).
  Subsequently, the intracellular portion of notch will also be cleaved by γ-secretase,
  an intramembrane protease thereby releasing notch intracellular domain containing
  portion (NICD). In pancreatic cancer cells, NICD will translocate into the nucleus
  and interacts with its transcription factor RBP and co activator p300 leading to
  activation of Epcam, CD44 and Hes1 genes [, ].'
