caption: Modulation of N-type channels by drugs, toxins, and signaling pathways. The
  major pharmacologically relevant classes of N-type calcium channel active drugs
  and toxins are shown in pathway 2. This includes pore-blocking peptide toxins such
  as ω-conotoxin MVIIA, as well as a series of different types of small organic molecules
  that include piperazines and piperidines, DHPs, and long-chain carbon molecules.
  N-type channels are modulated by a variety of different signaling pathways either
  through membrane-delimited actions of activated G proteins activated by GPCRs (pathway
  1), or by interfering with scaffolding proteins such as CRMP-2 (pathway 3) (for
  details, see the text). The image of ω-conotoxin MVIIA is reproduced from Wikipedia
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziconotide).
