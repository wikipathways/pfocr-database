caption: Pathway analysis of genes highly expressed in TNBC compared to HR-positive,
  HER2-negative breast cancer. The nodes of the network are the proteins encoded by
  the genes overexpressed in TNBC and their shapes represent their biological activities
  as shown in the inset. The nodes are connected by edges which indicate direct and
  indirect biological relationships between these proteins. Highly connected nodes
  may represent therapeutic targets, inhibition of which could attenuate signaling
  throughout the network
