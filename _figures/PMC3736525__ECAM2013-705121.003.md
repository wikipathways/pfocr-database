caption: Lycopene induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Growth factors, such as
  PDGF and IGF, enhance cell survival by protecting cells from apoptosis. Lycopene
  blocks cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase, predominantly by reducing the
  levels of cyc D and E and subsequently inactivating CDK4 and 2 and reducing the
  phosphorylation of Rb. Furthermore, lycopene increases the levels of the CDK inhibitors
  p21 and p27 and the tumour suppressor p53 and reduces levels of SKP2 (leaf panel).
  Lycopene promotes apoptosis by decreasing Bcl-2, BclXL  and survivin expression,
  increasing the levels of the proapoptotic proteins Bax, Bad, Bim, and Fas ligand,
  and activating caspases 8, 9, and 3 (right panel). Lycopene can also block growth
  factor-mediated antiapoptotic signals by directly inhibiting the binding of growth
  factors to their receptors or by inhibiting the downstream PI3K-AKT pathway. Lycopene
  can elicit AKT-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis through the phosphorylation
  and inactivation of GSK3β, p21, p27, Bad, and caspase 9, as well as the inactivation
  of p53 via Mdm2.
