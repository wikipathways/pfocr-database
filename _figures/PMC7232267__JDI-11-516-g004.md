caption: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)–β klotho complex plays roles
  in endothelial homeostasis. (a) In normal endothelial cells, N‐acetyl‐seryl‐aspartyl‐lysyl‐proline
  (AcSDKP)‐induced FGFR1 levels and FGFR1–KLB complex. Such FGFR1–KLB complex is essential
  for the endothelial homeostasis by inhibiting both smad3 and mitogen‐activated protein
  kinase kinase (MEK)–extracellular signal‐regulated kinases (ERK) signaling pathway.
  (b) In the endothelial cells with KLB deficiency, MEK–ERK pathway dependent EndMT
  could be induced. KLB deficiency is not associated with alteration in FGFR1 levels
  in endothelial cells. AcSDKP cannot inhibit MEK–ERK pathway‐dependent EndMT in KLB‐deficient
  endothelial cells. (c) In the endothelial cells with FGFR1 deficiency, KLB levels
  are also significantly diminished, and both smad3 and the MEK–ERK pathway are activated.
  FGFR1‐deficient endothelial cells also show AcSDKP‐resistant endothelial mesenchymal
  transition (EndMT).
