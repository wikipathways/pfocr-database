caption: A The MasR-induced expression of sirtuin1 results in increased expression
  of PPARɣ and enhanced intracellular signaling of insulin receptor through Akt activation.
  Sirtuin1 has an inhibitory effect on SREBP-1c expression through negative regulation
  of P53. In β-cells, sirtuin 1 inhibits UCP2 in which prevents the release of insulin.
  SREBP1 interferes with the effect of the insulin response element on the IRS2 promoter
  leading to suppression of the down-stream insulin signaling pathway. B In skeletal
  muscles, irisin is derived from FNDC5 under the stimulatory effect of MasR through
  the PGC1-α activation. It leads to overexpression of GLUT4 through activation of
  p38MAPK in insulin-sensitive tissues. Irisin also induces production of betatrophin
  which induces proliferation of β-cells. During COVID-19, the possible alteration
  of irisin production may induce inflammatory pathway through the activation of p-JNK
  and p-ERK. This will lead to overproduction of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL6, IL1β and MCP1
  and disturbed insulin signaling
