caption: NF-κB signaling pathways. Although the canonical and non-canonical signaling
  pathways primarily activate the RelA/p50 and RelB/p52 dimers, respectively, all
  NF-κB members may be activated by either pathway or both. In fact, the RelA/p50
  dimers may be sequestered in the cytoplasm by p100 and can be activated through
  p100 processing. On the other hand, NF-κB dimers containing p52 may be sequestered
  in the cytoplasm by IκBα and can be activated through IκBα degradation. Furthermore,
  activation of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway can be induced through inducible
  degradation of IκBβ, IκBɛ and p105, a process similar to the inducible IκBα degradation,
  although their degradation dynamics can be different.
