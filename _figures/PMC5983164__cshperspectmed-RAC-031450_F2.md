caption: RAS effector pathways. Once activated, RAS proteins signal through multiple
  effector pathways, thus activating many different signal transduction pathways,
  such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K). The RAS signaling network gets more complex because PI3K is also directly
  activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs).
  Besides, there are several points in which the MAPK and PI3K pathways cross talk,
  leading to either activation or inhibition at different levels. Raf can be inhibited
  by PI3K in different situations. PI3K pathway can also be activated or inhibited
  by Raf under certain conditions. Another level of connection of these two pathways
  involves target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and insulin receptor substrate 1
  (IRS1). When these proteins get inhibited, a feedback signal through RTKs is initiated
  that activates MAPK in a RAS-dependent manner, thus provoking extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) and AKT phosphorylation and activation of both pathways. PTEN, Phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; PDK1, PI3K-dependent kinase 1; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated protein
  kinases 1 and 2.
