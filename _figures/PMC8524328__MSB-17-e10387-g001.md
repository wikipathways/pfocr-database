caption: The main groups of the C19DMap Community are biocurators, domain experts,
  and analysts and modellers; communicating to refine, interpret, and apply C19DMap
  diagrams. These diagrams are created and maintained by biocurators, following pathway
  database workflows or stand‐alone diagram editors, and reviewed by domain experts.
  The content is shared via pathway databases or a GitLab repository; all can be enriched
  by integrated resources of text mining and interaction databases. The C19DMap diagrams
  are available in several layout‐aware systems biology formats and integrated with
  external repositories, allowing a range of computational analyses, including network
  analysis and Boolean, kinetic or multiscale simulations.
