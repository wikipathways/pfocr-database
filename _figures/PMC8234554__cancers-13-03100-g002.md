caption: 'YAP structure and regulation. In the present figure, YAP structure (bottom)
  is depicted by showing all binding domains allowing protein-protein interactions
  to exert YAP pro-tumorigenic functions. From the N-terminus to C-terminus of the
  488 aa protein it can be distinguished a proline-rich domain (PP), one TEAD binding
  domain (BD), one 14-3-3 BD, two WW domains, one transcriptional activation domain
  (TAD) and one PDZ BD. Yellow circles highlight phosphorylation sites at serine (S).
  Green circles evidence phosphorylation sites at tyrosine (Y) and one additional
  site for lysine (K) methylation is reported. Close to these regulatory sites, kinases
  or methyltransferase are represented in white boxes and the pathway that in turn
  they regulate. Upstream modulators (top) are depicted in correspondence of the plasma
  membrane (PM). In detail, on the left G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)-mediated
  signal transduction by which several growth factors and hormones regulate the kinase
  module of the Hippo pathway via RhoA-GTPases. Going forward, the cadherin-catenin
  complex involved in both structural roles and in the cytoplasmic restrain of YAP.
  YAP cytosol-nucleus shuttling is also modulated by proteins involved in cell polarity
  and tight junctions, such as the Scribble complex, Crumbs (CRB) family members and
  Merlin which mainly operate for the recruitment, stabilization and function of the
  kinase module. On the right, signals of mechanotransduction such as cell density,
  extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and stretching are reported. AMOTL1: angiomotin-like
  1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; C-Abl: Abl proto-oncogene; CK1: casein kinase
  1; DLG5: disc large 5; NLK: nemo-like kinase; PKA: cAMP-dependent protein kinase;
  PKC: protein kinase C; PTPN14: nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase 14; Set7: SET-domain
  containing 7, histone lysine methyltransferase.'
