caption: Defects in mitochondrial quality control affect several pathways linked to
  Parkinson's disease. PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitochondrial quality control, including
  mitophagy, the MDV pathway and mitochondrial biogenesis, is essential for cell viability.
  Alterations of this process in several cell types may be linked to 1/ microglial
  activation leading to the transcriptional induction of genes encoding components
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β 2/ energy failure in neurons, due to the presence
  of damaged mitochondria and 3/ type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and low density lipoprotein
  (LDL) cholesterol accumulation. Activation of the innate immune system, metabolism
  dyshomeostasis and energetic defects contribute to neuronal death which is closely
  linked to Parkinson's disease.
