caption: Schematic depicting the protective mechanism of selonsertib against mitochondrial
  damage. In LPS/GalN-induced ALF, excessive ASK1 phosphorylation induces JNK-mediated
  DRP1 activation and mitochondrial translocation in macrophages, which in turn promotes
  excessive mitochondrial fission. Enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation then leads
  to mitochondrial damage, an increase in mitochondrial oxidative stress, and the
  overproduction of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages. Selonsertib, a selective
  inhibitor of ASK1, protects against ALF by re-establishing the mitochondrial fusion-fission
  balance through suppressing the ASK1–JNK–DRP1 pathway in macrophages, rescuing mitochondrial
  damage and relieving inflammatory injury
