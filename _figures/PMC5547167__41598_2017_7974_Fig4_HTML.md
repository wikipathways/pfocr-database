caption: Mechanism by which BB68 affects the longevity of C. elegans. BB68 increased
  the longevity of nematodes by activating the TIR-1 – JNK-1 – DAF-16 signaling pathway,
  and the cell wall component of BB68 contributed to longevity. The solid arrow indicates
  activation observed in this study. A dashed line with an ‘×’ indicates that no effect
  was observed in this study. A dashed line indicates that the test was not performed
  in this study. A “P” indicates a phosphorylation site. *Indicates direct or indirect
  phosphorylation.
