caption: G1/S transition and G1/S checkpoint induction. The transition from G1 to
  S phase is initiated by the increasing mitogen-stimulated activity of CyclinD/Cdk4/6
  which phosphorylates pRb resulting in the initial release of the E2F transcription
  factor. This activates a positive feedback loop rendering cell cycle progression
  independent of mitogenic stimulation, an event that has been termed restriction
  point (R-point; blue arrow). The feedback loop involves the upregulation of CyclinE
  which, in complex with Cdk2, further stimulates E2F release and the transcription
  of genes necessary for S phase. After full pRb phosphorylation, all E2F is released
  and cells are unable to respond to DNA damage via ATM-dependent checkpoint induction
  (red arrow). In parallel to pRb phosphorylation, replication origins are licensed
  and the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) is formed. Again, through the activity
  of CyclinE/Cdk2, Cdc45 is loaded onto the chromatin forming the pre-initiation complex
  (pre-IC) which is required for polymerase recruitment. After double-strand break
  (DSB) induction, two parallel checkpoint pathways target the activity of Cyclin/Cdk
  complexes (indicated in blue symbols). The slower pathway involves the stabilization
  of p53 and transcriptional upregulation of p21 which binds and inhibits the Cyclin/Cdk
  complexes. The faster pathway acts via the activation of Chk2 and the inactivation
  of Cdc25. Thus, inhibitory phosphates of the CyclinE/Cdk2 complex can no longer
  be removed. The indicated times are estimations and may vary considerably between
  cell types (see text for details). (See colour version of this figure online at
