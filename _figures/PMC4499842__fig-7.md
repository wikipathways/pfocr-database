caption: Explanation of how UCB-MSC therapy is curative for IC bladder. The loss of
  urothelial integrity caused by multiple bladder insults (dotted arrow) leads to
  pathophysiological characteristic of IC patients, including epithelial denudation
  and the abnormal increase in inflammation, neural cells, and angiogenesis. Injecting
  UCB-MSCs in a paracrine manner stimulates Wnt and its downstream growth factors,
  including Egf, Igf1, Igf2, and Fgf16, which can boost the regenerative capability
  of endogenous stem cells (solid arrow). In addition, the engrafted UCB-MSCs directly
  differentiate into epithelial cells in the bladder tissues.
