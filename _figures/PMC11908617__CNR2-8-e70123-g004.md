caption: Effect of ZNFs on CRC metastasis‐related pathways [46, 47, 51, 52, 55]. Zinc
  finger protein plays an important role in the occurrence and development of CRC,
  and promotes the metastasis and invasion of CRC by activating some tumor‐related
  signaling pathways. For example, increased expression of ZFP57 activates tumor stemness
  signaling; ZNF281, ZNF276, and ZNF334 could activate WNT/ β‐catenin signaling pathway,
  ZNF460 could activate jak‐stat signaling pathway, ZNF384 could activate MMPs signaling
  pathway, ZNF326 could activate EMT signaling pathway. The activation of these pathways
  has an important link with the metastasis and invasion of CRC
