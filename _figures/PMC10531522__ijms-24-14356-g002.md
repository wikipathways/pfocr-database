caption: 'The RTK inhibitor sunitinib in combination therapy with ketoconazole in
  RCC. The exosomes secreted from tumor cells affect the cells in the tumor microenvironment,
  leading to drug resistance and immune escape. The ESCRT pathway is one of the central
  components responsible for the biogenesis of exosomes. Lipids such as ceramide are
  generated by neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMAse-2), which is necessary for vesicle
  budding during ILV formation. Rab GTPases lead to the docking of MVBs to the plasma
  membrane (PM). Ketoconazole leads to the downregulation of Alix, nSMAse-2, and Rab27a,
  inhibiting exosome biogenesis and secretion and leading to a decrease in tumor growth
