caption: Interactions of ADAM17 with IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-15. ADAM17, through trans-signaling,
  cleaves the membrane interleukin-6 receptor (mIL-6R) to free a soluble molecule,
  which then associates with free IL-6 to constitute a signal-transducing receptor
  complex with gp130 and induce its dimerization. The dimerized gp130 leads to the
  activation of the JAK1/MAP kinase and PI3 kinase signaling and recruits the cytoplasmic
  transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3. Activation of gp130 also determines the phosphorylation
  and induction of the YAP pathway. The process of activation of ADAM17 is mediated
  by IL-1β that phosphorylates the cytoplasmic residue T735 and activates the p38
  MAP kinase pathway. Interferons (IFNs) also upregulate cleavage of the cell surface
  IL-15Rα/IL-15 complex in an ADAM17-dependent manner, inducing the expression of
  inflammatory cytokines and subsequently an inflammatory status. ADAM17 (disintegrin
  and metalloprotease 17); gp130 (glycoprotein 130); IFNs (interferons); JAK1 (Janus
  kinase); MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase); IL-6 (interleukin 6); IL-1β (interleukin
  1 beta); IL-15 (interleukin 15); STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription);
  PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)
