caption: PPARγ transduction pathway. PPARγ has several extracellular and intracellular
  ligands that include dietary and bioactive lipids. Given its antidiabetogenic role,
  some PPARγ ligands include antidiabetic drugs such as thiazolidinediones. PPARγ
  is also modulated by several growth factor transduction pathways such as Jnk/Erk/MKP.
  It is also known that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) bond to p25 (a product of
  the cleavage of p35 in obesity environment) inhibits PPARγ pathway by its phosphorylation.
  As a transcriptional factor, PPARγ binds to RXR (retinol X receptor) in order to
  transcribe several genes related to adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage
  in adipose tissue and increase insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues by indirect
  increase of AMP kinase activity as well as several other antidiabetogenic effects.
  Moreover, PPARγ blocks NFκB signaling, thus reducing proinflammatory cytokines and
  inflammation.
