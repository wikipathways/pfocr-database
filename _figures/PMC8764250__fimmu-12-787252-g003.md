caption: Interleukin-27 (IL-27) promotes CD4+ T helper type 1 (Th1) cell differentiation
  and inhibits Th2 and Th17 cell development in CD4+ T cells. IL-27 promotes Th1 development
  via multiple signaling pathways. In CD4+ T cells, IL-27 binds to IL-27 receptor
  and activates Janus tyrosine kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2).
  Subsequently, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1
  (STAT1) activates T-bet, and this drives naive CD4+ T cell to skew toward Th1 cells.
  STAT1 phosphorylation also promotes Th1 development via leukocyte function-associated
  antigen 1 (LFA-1)/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling pathway. In addition, Th1 differentiation can be improved
  by the TYK2/MAPK/T-bet signaling pathway, which is STAT1 independent. STAT1 phosphorylation
  induced by IL-27 inhibits GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) and orphan receptor gamma
  t (RORγt) via a STAT1-dependent manner, which blocks naive CD4+ T cell differentiate
  into Th2 and Th17. The figure was created with BioRender.com.
