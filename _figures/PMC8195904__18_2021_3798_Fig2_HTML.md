caption: Schematic of main components of the canonical WNT signalling pathway. In
  the absence of WNT ligands, β-catenin, (encoded by the CTNNB1 gene) is normally
  recruited in a destruction complex containing several proteins including APC (adenomatous
  polyposis coli), AXIN, CKIα (casein kinase 1 alpha) and GSK3β (glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β). This results in β-catenin phosphorylation of specific amino acids encoded
  by CTNNB1 exon 3 and protein degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Consequently,
  levels of β-catenin protein concentration are low in the cytoplasm and nucleus,
  hence keeping the target genes in a repressed state. At the same time, two surface
  E3 ubiquitin ligases, RNF43 and ZNFR3, regulate levels of the WNT ligand–receptor
  Frizzled through its ubiquitination which leads to its endosomal internalization
  and degradation. Binding of WNT ligands to their receptor, Frizzled, leads to the
  formation of a complex alongside coreceptors LRP and Dishevelled (DVL), which captures
  and disassembles the β-catenin destruction complex and thus prevents β-catenin phosphorylation
  and degradation. This causes protein stabilization, nucleo-cytoplasmic accumulation
  of β-catenin and the activation of target genes. Examples of WNT target genes encode
  for LGR receptors (LGR4-6), which upon binding of R-spondins (Rspo), recruit the
  RNF43/ZNFR3 complex and, therefore, allows the accumulation of Frizzled in the membrane.
  This leads to positive feedback and amplification of the WNT signalling pathway.
  Mutations in exon 3 of CTNNB1, containing the regulatory amino acids of β-catenin
  responsible for its degradation, prevent β-catenin phosphorylation by the destruction
  complex. This leads to its nucleo-cytoplasmic accumulation and constitutive overactivation
  of the WNT/β-catenin pathway even in the absence of WNT ligands and R-spondins.
