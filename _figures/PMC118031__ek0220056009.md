caption: Model for the terminal checkpoint and its regulation by SP85. (A) Delivery
  of the two major components of the coat, protein and cellulose, are proposed to
  be under control of separate signaling pathways which depend upon PK-A () and SplA
  (), respectively. SDF-2 () is suggested to initiate coat formation by stimulating
  exocytosis of future coat proteins from PSVs (upper arm; stage I). The pathway and
  timing of arrival of cellulose synthase (lower arm) at the plasma membrane are not
  known. Subsequent stage II events, including expulsion of water and cellulose synthesis
  await checkpoint execution. The checkpoint is suppressed from the time of PSV formation
  by SP85, a resident PSV protein that is later secreted to contribute to the coat.
  SP85 itself is regulated by the opposing activities of a C2 factor, which supports
  SP85-mediated suppression, and a C1 factor, which overcomes SP85 suppression, resulting
  in checkpoint activation. The effects of expressing NC1 and NC2 are interpreted
  as competitive inhibition of the actions of the C1 and C2 factors, respectively.
  Deposition of cellulose results in organization of the outer and inner layers (stage
  III), which depends on a second function of SP85. Locations of the inner, middle,
  and outer layers and the plasma membrane (pl. mem.) are noted. (B) SP85 is postulated
  to inhibit the checkpoint via a plasma membrane sensor, which transduces the inhibition
  signal intracellularly. The M or N domain of SP85 may bind the receptor directly
  or indirectly. Regulation of SP85 by the C2 and C1 factors are represented as locational.
  The deinhibiting influence of the C1 factor, itself presumably connected to a coat
  protein network, is proposed to relocate SP85 away from the sensor as a result of
  overall hydration. Inhibition of the checkpoint is relieved, and sporulation continues
  to stage II.
