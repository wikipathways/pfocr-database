caption: Biological characteristics of MPXV. (A) Genome structure of MPXV. The genome
  of MPXV is a large double‐stranded DNA structure of 197 kb length. The highly conserved
  central region is located at genomic nucleotide positions 56,000—120,000 and is
  flanked by variable ends that include inverted terminal repeats (ITR), comprising
  of a set of short tandem repeats and terminal hairpins. There are 190 non‐overlapping
  ORFs on the genome, four of which are located in reverse variable terminal repeat
  sequences. (B) Life cycle of MPXV. Mature virus (MV) attaches to the cell surface
  via interactions between viral ligands and supracellular receptors. And subsequently
  enters the cell either under neutral conditions via cell membrane fusion, or via
  an endosomal uptake pathway mediated by actin and a low pH, a pattern similar to
  the macrophage drinking mechanism. Enveloped viruses (EVs) remove the extra membrane
  envelope (becomes to MVs) prior to entry, and enter the cell in the same manner.
  After entering the host cytoplasm, the viral particles undergo three stages of gene
  expression, namely early, intermediate, and late stages. In the beginning, the virus
  initiates early transcription, and early proteins such as growth factors and transcription
  factors are expressed. Subsequently, DNA replication which is inhibited by Cidofovir
  and Brincidofovir happens, followed by intermediate/late transcription and expression.
  And the genomic DNA and late proteins are assembled to pre‐mature virion in the
  “cytoplasmic virus factory,” with morphogenesis changes, intracellular mature virus
  particles (IMVs) are formed. And IMV can be wrapped by the additional envelope to
  form intracellular enveloped virus particles (IEVs), specifically, the wrapping
  could be hindered by Tecovirimat. IEVs can be released from the cell by forming
  an actin tail to obtain extracellular enveloped virus particles (EEV), whereas IMV
  can only be released from the cell upon cell lysis. Currently, no treatment for
  MPXV infections has been approved. And United States Strategic National Stockpile
  (SNS) recommends clinicians to consider Tecovirimat, Brincidofovir, and Cidofovir
  (developed for use in patients with smallpox) as the options for the treatment of
  Mpox
