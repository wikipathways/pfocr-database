caption: Overview of the TNF-TNFR2 signalling pathway in the immunosuppressive cells.
  The TNFR2 does not interact with an intracellular DD, while it interacts with complex
  I that consists of TRAF2 with cIAP1 and cIAP2, and induction of homeostatic signals.
  The signals travel from complex I either via receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase 1 (RIPK1) or Etk (a member of the Btk tyrosine kinase family). RIPK1 trigger
  NF-κB via the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, which results in increasing the transcription
  of several genes associated positively with cell survival and proliferation. However,
  the Etk, through the PI3K/Akt pathway, is able to activate both AP1 and MAPK signalling
  pathways, which activate the promoter of proliferation, survival and other transcription
  factors. Further, it is associated with enhancing the phosphorylation of signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) that play a crucial role in
  immunosuppression (Adopted from Al-Hatamleh et al., 2019 []).
