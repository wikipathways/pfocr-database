caption: 'mTOR Signaling Cascade. mTOR regulates a number of key cellular processes
  in mammalian cells, including protein translation. mTOR can bind to GβL, Mlst8,
  PRAS40, and RAPTOR, forming the MTI sensitive complex, mTORC1.() In comparison,
  the components of mTORC2 include mTOR, GβL, mSIN1, RICTOR, and PROTOR/PRR5.() mTORC2,
  in concert with PDK1, activates AKT by phosphorylation. Activation of growth factor
  receptors, including IL-7R, IGF-1R, c-kit, and flt-3, via insulin, hormones, and
  growth factors, leads to activation of IRS-1. The activation of IRS-1 in turn leads
  to PI3K up-regulation. PI3K can also be activated by directly associating with the
  growth factor receptor at the cell membrane. Activated PI3K generates PIP3 which
  can recruit AKT to the cell membrane so that PDK1 and TORC2 can activate it.() The
  tumor suppressor PTEN negatively regulates PI3K by dephosphorylating its second
  messengers, i.e. PIP3.() Inactivating mutations of PTEN, which are found in many
  tumor types, leads to excess activation of AKT, mTOR, p70S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and
  can increase sensitivity to mTOR inhibition.() Activated AKT then can phosphorylate
  TSC2, resulting in the inactivation of the TSC1:TSC2 complex, allowing for RHEB
  to activate mTORC1.() The main downstream targets of activated mTORC1 are S6K1 and
  the inhibitor of cap-dependent translation, 4E-BP-1.() The mTORC1 kinase phosphorylates
  S6K1. Phosphorylated- S6K1 induces TOP-translation and ribosomal biosynthesis as
  well as blocks apoptosis by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD. In addition,
  P-S6K1 acts as a negative feedback mechanism for the mTOR pathway by down-regulating
  IRS-1.() mTORC1 regulates cap-dependent protein translation via phosphorylation
  of 4E-BP-1.() When hypophosphorylated, 4E-BP1 binds tightly to eIF-4E, blocking
  the association of eIF-4E with eIF-4G. This blocks the formation of the eIF-4F translation
  initiation complex which is necessary for cap-dependent translation. When 4E-BP1
  is phosphorylated by mTORC1, it is released from eIF4E, thereby facilitating translational
  initiation of mRNAs for a number of key intracellular proteins, including c-MYC,
  cyclin D1, and ornithine decarboxylase.(). Cyclin D1 forms a complex with CDK4 (cyclin
  dependent kinase 4) which is required for activation via phosphorylation of Rb (retinoblastoma
  protein).() mTOR also facilitates the elimination of the cyclin dependent kinase
  inhibitor p27kip1 through interactions with p34cdc2, allowing cell cycle progression
