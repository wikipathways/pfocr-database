caption: Brief description of pharmacological targets and signaling cascades recruited
  in reconsolidation. The process of drug memory reconsolidation requires a complicated
  regulatory network, including epigenetic mechanisms, gene transcription, and activation
  of membrane receptors, all of which are responsible for behavior changes. Targets
  for epigenetic modifications mainly lie in the HAT, the HDAC, the DNMT. Besides,
  the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of ERK and eIF2α within the nucleus regulate
  the expression of immediate early genes, such as CREB, Zif 268, and c-fos, thus
  ultimately lead to changes in addiction behaviors. Finally, pre-and postsynaptic
  membrane receptors including AMPAR, NMDAR, β-AR, and CB1 have been proved to be
  effective targets. Main downstream mechanisms contain the second messenger (cAMP)-mediated
  pathway, AMPAR & NMDAR regulated synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter transport.
