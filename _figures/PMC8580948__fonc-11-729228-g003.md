caption: Schematic representation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. (A) Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  is activated by Wnt ligands, which bind to the FZ/LRP5/6 receptor in order to inhibit
  the destruction complex. Thus, leading to accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin
  and its eventual translocation into the nucleus. Then, β-catenin binds to TCF/LEF
  sites to activate transcription of target genes such as CCND1 and MYC, which are
  involved in cell proliferation and survival. (B) The drug C59 acts at the extracellular
  level inhibiting the Wnt ligands to block the pathway. NSC668036 acts at the cytoplasmic
  level binding to DVL protein, which inhibits the Wnt3A induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
  ICRT14 acts at the nuclear level inhibiting direct interactions between b-catenin
  and TCF4, blocking the transcriptional function of nuclear β-catenin. Left panel
  shows the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway turned on; while right panel turned off.
