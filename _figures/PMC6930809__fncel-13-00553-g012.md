caption: Potential mechanisms by which Meisoindigo protects against focal cerebral
  ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and microglia/macrophage
  polarization strongly influence the immunological cascades triggered by stroke.
  Meisoindigo reduces the production of inflammatory mediators by inhibiting the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome and preventing the microglial/macrophage switch from the
  protective M2 phenotype to the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, thereby exerting neuroprotection
  against ischemic stroke, which may achieve through the inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB
  signaling pathway in neurons and microglia. In addition, we here found that the
  NLRP3 inflammasome is mainly expressed in neurons. Therefore, we speculate that
  the inflammatory mediators released by NLRP3 inflammasome1 activation in neurons
  may induce neuronal pyroptosis and affect phenotypic polarization in microglia/macrophages.

    we speculate that the inflammatory mediators released by NLRP3 inflammasome1 activation
    in neurons may induce neuronal pyroptosis and affect phenotypic polarization in
