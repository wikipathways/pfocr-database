caption: 'Four damaging pathways that can explain the detrimental effects of ROS in
  hyperglycaemia-induced diabetic neuropathy. The impaired glucose metabolism in diabetic
  condition causes an accumulation of glucose and glycolytic intermediates, which,
  instead of travel along glycolysis pathway, shunts to other metabolic or nonmetabolic
  pathways, resulting activation of the polyol pathway, hexosamine pathway, and AGE
  and PKC pathway. Superoxide inhibits glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
  activity, which is proposed to be a reason causing accumulation of all the glycolytic
  intermediates. Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP pathway) is to generate NADPH, which
  is used in polyol pathway. GFAT: glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase;
  GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase; PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase.'
