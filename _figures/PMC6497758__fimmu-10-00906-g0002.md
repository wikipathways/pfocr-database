caption: Proposed Schematic diagram of Mda5 signaling pathway in Teleost based on
  a Mammalian Model. The activation of Mda5 is initiated by the presence of long (+)
  dsRNA released after viral infection or bacterial nucleic acid, that leads to the
  phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 and 7 (IRF3/ IRF7), then to the
  activation of type I IFN promoter and finally to the expression of type I IFNs and
  other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). CARD, Caspase activation and recruitment
  domain; RD, regulatory domain; MAVS, mitochondrial-antiviral signaling protein;
  TRAF, TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-receptor associated factor; IKKϵ, inhibitor of
  nuclear factor Kappa-B kinase subunit epsilon; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; P, signifies
  phosphorylation; ISRE, interferon-sensitive response element.
