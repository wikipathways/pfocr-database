caption: NO scavenging pathways in plant cells. (A) The interaction of reduced glutathione
  (GSH) and nitric oxide (NO) in the presence of light leads to the production of
  S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). In the next steps, GSNO can be converted to glutathione
  disulfide (GSSG) and ammonia (NH3). GSNO is involved in the S-nitrosylation of cysteine
  residues (Cys-SNO). (B) Phytoglobin (PGB)–NO cycle. Under hypoxic conditions, nitrate
  (NO3−) is reduced to nitrite (NO2−) in cytosol by nitrate reductase (NR). Then,
  NO2− is transported to the mitochondrion, where it is converted to NO via an alternative
  respiration pathway, resulting in the production of a negligible amount of adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP).
