caption: Mechanism by which MTB-PtpA enters the host cell nucleus to inhibit natural
  immune function. MTB PtpA is secreted into the host cell to bind ubiquitin molecules
  and is activated, and activated PtpA can inhibit the transcription of TNFRSF8 in
  the host nucleus, thus inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. PtpA can also bind
  directly to the promoter region of the GADD45A or RNF187 gene and inhibit its transcription,
  dephosphorylating p-JNK and p-p38 to inhibit the activation of the JNK/p38 signaling
  pathway. (TNFRSF8, a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily; Trim27, belonging to
  E3 ubiquitin ligase family, can activate JNK/p38 signal pathway of host cells in
  a ubiquitin ligase activity dependent manner; GADD45A, a regulator of p38 MAPKs
  by inhibiting p38 phosphorylation and activity).
