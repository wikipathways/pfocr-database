caption: Potential metabolic pathway by which H. pylori is capable of generating GMP
  and AMP from a single purine source, adenine. The pathway for adenine processing
  assumes weak APRTase activity and the presence of an adenosine deaminase. (Step
  1) Adenine is utilized by APRTase to generate AMP, while simultaneously, purine
  nucleoside phosphorylase is adding a sugar moiety to adenine (generating adenosine),
  which allows for recognition of the nucleoside by adenosine deaminase. (2) Adenosine
  is deaminated to inosine, which is then (3) phosphorlyated to hypoxanthine, allowing
  for (4) utilization by H. pylori's Gpt. Subsequently, GMP and AMP are produced via
  the usual fashion, (5) first from IMP to XMP or adenylsuccinate and (6) finally
  to GMP and AMP.
