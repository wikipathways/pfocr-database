caption: Model for E-selectin–mediated slow rolling. The circled numbers represent
  new signaling components identified in this paper. Neutrophils rolling on E-selectin
  engage both CD44 and PSGL-1 to initiate signaling through a common pathway that
  requires lipid rafts, the cytoplasmic domain of PSGL-1, all 3 SFKs, the ITAM adaptors
  DAP12 and FcRγ, the Tec kinase Btk, and p38. This signaling cascade activates integrin
  leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) to a conformation that enables slow
  rolling but not arrest on ICAM-1. PSGL-1 and CD44 may not be located in the same
  raft domains as depicted in the figure.
