caption: In bone marrow derived MΦs, IFNα receptor is necessary for optimal expression
  and IFNα-mediated induction of mA3 mRNA. IFNα-mediated mA3 mRNA enhancement requires
  IFNαR, PKC and STAT1. Pharmacological inhibition of PKC with Rottlerin suppressed
  IFNα-mediated STAT1 and mA3 mRNA induction, while specific inhibitors of ERK, P38,
  and JNK results in enhancement of IFNαR mediated IFNα induction of mA3 mRNA. Additionally,
  ligand-activation of TLR4 induces mA3 mRNA through the TLR4•TRIF•IRF3•PKC pathway.
  In IFNαR sufficient cells, PKC positively regulates LPS mediated mA3 mRNA induction.
  Induction of mA3 could also occur through LPS activation of TLR4-mediated IFNβ production
  in a paracrine manner. Induction of mA3 by TLR4•LPS is negatively regulated by pharmacological
  inhibitors of ERK, P38, and JNK. These MAP kinases regulate mA3 mRNA induction by
  LPS via MyD88 independent of IFNαR. PD 98059, SP 600125, SB 203580, and Rottlerin
  respectively inhibit ERK, JNK, P38, and PKC in that order.
