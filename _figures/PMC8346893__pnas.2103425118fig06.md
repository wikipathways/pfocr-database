caption: Hypothetical pathway of shifting native αS multimers toward excess monomers
  and therapeutic approaches against the buildup of lipid-rich and lysosomal foci.
  Lysosomal dysfunction—by GCase deficiency or other autophagy perturbations—induced
  by excess αS monomers at membranes, decreases CatB activity (a risk factor of PD
  penetrance in hu GBA1 carriers that can strip off perilipins), and this, in turn,
  yields to Plin-stabilized LDs unavailable for cytosolic degradation. The resultant,
  nutritional stress stimulates the production of new LDs, and their abnormal membrane
  expansion is detected by CCT-α [as in Gaucher’s Disease neuropathology ()]. The
  relative abundance of cytosolic LDs retains TFEB in the cytosol (cyt) versus translocation
  to the nucleus (nucl), critical for lysosomal biogenesis and thereby lipid degradation
  (, , ). The treatment with an SCD inhibitor (“5b”) likely acts upstream of this
  vicious cycle by decreasing unsaturated FAs that are typically stored in form of
  TAGs, the major component of LDs, thereby reducing the abundance of lipidic material.
  Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, a relative increase in SFAs (by SCD inhibitor
  or increased GCase activity) can produce higher-order lipid domains in membranes
  and thereby create an αS- (and other protein) repellant surface, increasing the
  solubility of αS monomers that assemble dynamically into physiological αS tetramers
  and subsequently decrease the vesicle- and lipid-rich aggregates. Finally, certain
  SFAs can stabilize the helical structure of αS () and thereby the tetramer formation.
  For additional references of the hypothesized pathway, see Results and Discussion
  and our previous publication ().
