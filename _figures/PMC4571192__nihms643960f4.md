caption: 'Arachidonic acid metabolites are critical mediators of host defense against
  Mtb. Candidate HDTs that affect this metabolic pathway are shown in shaded boxes
  at their site of action on the pathway. (A). In controlled TB disease, the arachidonic
  acid pathway yields balanced levels of TNF and Type I IFNs, which control infection.
  (B). In uncontrolled TB disease with elevated levels of LTA4, TNF, and Type I IFNs,
  eicosanoid signaling is out of balance and favors production of LTA4 at the expense
  of PGE2. (C). Restoration of equilibrium and control of disease may be achieved
  with zileuton, which block 5-LO. As a consequence LTA4 levels are reduced and, indirectly,
  PGE2 levels become elevated, which reduces Type I IFNs and TNF, and permits control
  of the bacteria. Other drugs such as aspirin or valdecoxib, which inhibit PGE2 production,
  may be useful when the eicosanoid pathway imbalance favors production of PGE2 at
  the expense of LTA4. Abbreviations: COX, cyclooxygenase; PGE2, prostaglandin E2;
  15LO, 15-lipoxygenase; 5LO, 5-lipoxygenase; LXA4, lipoxin A4; LTA4, leukotriene
  A4.'
