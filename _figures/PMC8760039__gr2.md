caption: Pathways that promote root developmental phase transitions in Arabidopsis
  thaliana.(A) The autonomous pathway appears to promote the root-foraging phase,
  during which the transcription factor MYB36 mRNA is found only in specific cell
  types, whereas the MYB36 protein induces genes to promote foraging. Similarly, PLETHORA
  (PLT) expression varies across root zones and is highest around root stem cells,
  where differential DNA methylation patterns may promote maximum PLT activity. In
  these cells, RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED 1 (RBR1) and SCARECROW (SCR) regulate cell fates
  around QC cells, promoting de novo formative cell divisions.(B) Mobile elements
  that move among diverse root cell types constitute the non-autonomous pathway. SHORT-ROOT
  (SHR) moves from the epidermis to the endodermis, where SHR activates SCR to induce
  the movement of miR165/6, which in turn suppresses the expression of cell-differentiation
  regulators to release the root-foraging phase. JACKDAW (JKD) activity around QC
  cells delimits SHR movement in these cells, whereas the expression of genes encoding
  GLABRA2 (GL2), CAPRICE (CPC), and WEREWOLF (WER) is regulated by JKD, resulting
  in the mobility of these three genes to give rise to the epidermis. Overall, the
  non-autonomous pathway sustains the root-foraging phase (from the middle of the
  phase), vascular tissue formation, and growth.(C) Hormones are essential to organism
  development, and an emerging hormonal pathway orchestrates root developmental phases.
  Thus, opposing gradients of auxin and cytokinin regulate patterns of cell proliferation
  and differentiation. In the root tip, maximum levels of auxin with jasmonates may
  induce the transcription factor ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 109 (ERF109) that in turn
  activates QC cells to promote stem cell fates, particularly around the root tip.
  Subsequently, a local auxin maximum at the pericycle cells activates CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE
  ZIPPER (HD-ZIP III) transcription factors, and increases in auxin and HD-ZIP IIIs
  lead to the acquisition of xylem identity. As a consequence, ERF109 activity is
  upregulated at the transition zone according to the balance of jasmonate and auxin,
  thereby inducing lateral root (LR) formation. Therefore, the hormonal pathway regulates
  not only the early and later stages of the foraging phase but also entry into the
  senescence phase.(D) Roots contain cells that vary markedly in ontogeny and require
  complex genetic circuits to regulate developmental phases, suggesting a periodic
  pathway. The condensation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors in
  the cytoplasm, where they are inactivated, limits auxin responsiveness. Similarly,
  cyclic cell death of epidermal cells in the transition zone results in periodic
  LR induction. Meanwhile, the GNOM protein, a vesicle trafficking regulator, is repressed
  by ARF-GTP ACTIVATING PROTEIN DOMAIN (AGD3), and both proteins regulate the balance
  between esterification and de-esterification, orienting the turnover of pectin esterification.
  In the oscillation zone, a root clock is established through a competitive interaction
  between GNOM and AGD3 that orients the functionality of the LR clock to promote
  the root-foraging phase. Taken together, evidence suggests that the periodic pathway
  regulates the overall phases of root development from early until late cell development.
