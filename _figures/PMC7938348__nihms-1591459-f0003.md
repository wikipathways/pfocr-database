caption: mCa2+ uptake through MCU can trigger mitochondrial permeability transition,
  leading to mitochondrial swelling, membrane rupture, and the initiation of necrotic
  cell death. This pathway is largely responsible for cardiomyocyte death in myocardial
  IR-injury and heart failure. Acute inhibition or genetic disruption of MCU function
  can prevent excessive mCa2+ uptake, mPTP opening, and necrosis during IR-injury.
  With chronic, sustained MCU disruption, cardiomyocytes can remodel such that the
  protective effects against acute injury are lost. The mPTP may be sensitized to
  low levels of mCa2+, and thus open even in the absence of rapid mCa2+ uptake, perhaps
  in response to smaller, more gradual increases in mCa2+ mediated by MCU-independent
  mCa2+ uptake pathways. Chronic MCU disruption also causes upregulation of additional
  cell death pathways that may allow for cardiomyocyte death during IR-injury, even
  in the context of reduced mCa2+ uptake.
