caption: The interplay between the mevalonate pathway and mutp53. The mevalonate pathway
  can enhance cancer progression through several molecular mechanisms, including protein
  prenylation/lipidation (Ras farnesylation, Rho geranylgeranylation), cholesterol
  synthesis, and stabilization of mutp53. Mevalonate-5-phosphate (MVP), a metabolic
  intermediate in the mevalonate pathway, promotes interaction between conformational
  mutp53 and DNAJA1, which inhibits CHIP ubiquitin ligase-mediated ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation of mutp53, leading to mutp53 stabilization. Mutp53 is
  shown to bind to SREBP2, increasing the expression of mevalonate pathway enzymes
  and subsequently MVP levels, which in turn stabilizes mutp53, thus forming a positive-feedback
  loop. Therefore, inhibition of the mevalonate pathway with statins, zoledronic acid,
  or GGTI inhibitors (GGTI-2133, GGTI-298) may represent a novel therapeutic strategy
  of targeting cancers with mutp53 by inhibiting mutp53 GOF activities, prenylation
  of oncogenes, and cholesterol synthesis, as well as inducing mutp53 degradation.
