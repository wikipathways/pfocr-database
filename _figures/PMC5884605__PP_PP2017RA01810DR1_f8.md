caption: Illustration of systemic changes resulting from EMF inoculation within a
  poplar cell. Transcriptional changes of enzymes are represented by colored boxes,
  and those of transmembrane transporters are represented by colored circles; biosynthetic
  routes are illustrated in rounded rectangles that are colored according to the enzymatic
  and metabolic regulation patterns found within them. Metabolites and compound classes
  also are colored according to their respective regulation patterns. Metabolites
  that are colored in red were detected by GC-MS measurements. ACC, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
