caption: Plasma-induced oxidative stress-mediated signaling pathways proposed in the
  literature (top). In osteosarcoma therapy, according to Mateu-Sanz et al., pyruvate
  scavenges hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular medium. CAP-induced cell membrane
  disruption, however, facilitates internalization of RONS into the cell. The elevated
  oxidative stress increases peroxiredoxin expression and modulates protein phosphorylation
  and transcription factor activation, which dictates cell death or survival. Next
  to that, the plasma-generated RONS can change the expression pattern of cytokines,
  chemokines and growth factors responsible for osteosarcoma progression. CAP also
  causes DNA damage related to p53 activation and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Alternatively,
  mitochondrial injury may be inflicted directly by the RONS or indirectly by an increased
  mitochondrial calcium influx. Green boxes indicate increase or upregulation, whereas
  red boxes designate decrease or down-expression (bottom). According to Yan et al.
  following Jang et al., neural differentiation is initiated by the competition of
  NO with O2 for binding to the active site of the cytochrome c (CytC) oxidase, mitochondrial
  electron transport chain complex IV, and reversibly impeding its activity. Mitochondrial
  •O2− is formed via electron reduction of O2 by obstructing electron transfer in
  the electron transport chain. Next, the mitochondrial •O2− results in intracellular
  H2O2 generation, able to activate the Trk/Ras/ERK signaling pathway by acting as
  an intracellular messenger, ultimately leading to neural differentiation. (top)
