caption: Cartoon proposed model of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) pathogenesis.
  At the center of the disease are orbital fibroblasts which exhibit particularly
  robust responses to inflammatory mediators. Among them are CD34+ cells which we
  propose derive from fibrocytes, monocyte-derived progenitor cells trafficked from
  bone marrow. Fibrocytes circulate in Graves’ disease at higher frequency than that
  found in healthy individuals. When cultivated from the peripheral circulation, fibrocytes
  express several thyroid-specific proteins, including thyrotropin receptor (TSHR),
  thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, and sodium-iodide symporter. They also express Class
  II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) when unstimulated by interferon γ and
  can present antigens. When exposed to the appropriate culture conditions, they undergo
  differentiation into myofibroblasts (through Smad pathway activation by TGF-β) and
  adipocytes (through the activation of PPAR-γ). Many of the genes expressed by fibrocytes
  are detected at considerably lower levels in CD34+ orbital fibroblasts. We have
  found that these lower levels of expression result from the actions of Slit2. When
  activated, CD34+ fibrocytes and CD34+ fibroblasts generate several pro-inflammatory
  or anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins 1β, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, tumor
  necrosis factor α, and regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted
  (RANTES), CXCL-12 and CD40-CD154. Both CD34+ and CD34- orbital fibroblasts cell-surface
  display insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR). Orbital fibroblasts express
  three mammalian hyaluronan synthase isoenzymes and UDP glucose dehydrogenase and
  synthesize hyaluronan, the glycosaminoglycan associated with expanding orbital tissue
  in TAO. The vast majority of hyaluronan synthesis occurs in CD34- orbital fibroblasts.
