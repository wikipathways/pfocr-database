caption: Mechanisms by which phthalates affected autophagy. DBP could enhance autophagy
  through various pathways, including disrupting androgen signaling, inhibiting the
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, impairing the hedgehog signaling pathway, and activating
  the PERK/eIF2α signaling pathway. However, the elevated levels of NONRATT008453.2
  following DBP treatment exhibited autophagy-inhibiting effects. (Solid arrows represent
  mechanisms that have been demonstrated in the included studies). Dashed arrows indicate
  that mechanisms were proposed but were not experimentally validated in the included
  studies. Diamond-shaped icons represent the mechanisms that have been validated
  in vitro experiment in the included studies)
