caption: Value-added products derived from fatty acids and derivatives, which can
  be synthesized by yeast cell factories with tuned fatty acid profiles. The simplified
  metabolic pathway for fatty acid synthesis and major terminal enzymes are depicted.
  ACC, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; TE, thioesterase; WS, wax
  ester synthase; FAR, fatty acid reductase; CAR, carboxylic acid reductase; ADH,
  alcohol dehydrogenase; ADO, aldehyde deformylating oxidase; DC, decarboxylase; D,
  desaturase; E, elongase; AT acyltransferase; FAOH, fatty alcohols
