caption: 'Potential entry routes of SARS-CoV-2 to the central nervous system (CNS)
  and the mechanisms of neuronal damage. Taken through the olfactory pathway, virus
  would have access to the CNS using transneuronal/synaptic routes and reaches to
  brain respiratory center. In the hematogenous entry route, endothelial cells may
  become infected, microthrombi develop due to endothelial dysfunction. CNS infection
  arises with the SARS-CoV-2 entrance to the brain following blood–brain barrier disruption
  by cytokine storm. Astrocytes incorporate the viruses either via direct contact
  with infected endothelial cells, or ACE2 receptors. In response to virus infection,
  microglial cells trigger T cell, antigen-presenting cell activation and induce synapse
  loss. Following neuro-invasion and replication of SARS-CoV-2, impairment of ACE2
  activity due to exploitation by SARS-CoV-2, activation of AT1R by Ang II, and glutamate
  mediated inhibition of ACE2 activity contribute to the development of neurotoxicity
  and neuroinflammation. Excessive extracellular glutamate accumulation in SARS-CoV-2
  infection triggers oxidative stress and neuroinflammation via NMDA receptors, while
  SARS-CoV-2 infection targets glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and makes the patients
  more vulnerable to the detrimental effects of virus by decreasing GSH levels (Abbreviations:
  ACE2: angiotensin II–converting enzyme receptor-2; AMPAR: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid receptor; AngII: angiotensin II; AT1R: Ang II receptor type 1; BBB: blood–brain
