caption: Schematic pathway for the metabolism and roles of ascorbic acid in salivary
  glands. In most mammals, glycogenolysis, as a major source of UDP-glucuronic acid,
  leads to ascorbic acid synthesis. The glycogenolysis pathway is involved in the
  metabolism of glucose under normal and disease conditions and in the regulation
  of physiological functions. D-Glucose is converted into L-ascorbic acid via D-glucuronic
  acid, L-gulonic acid, and 2-keto-L-gulonolactone as intermediates. Ascorbic acid
  stimulates TET2 activity by promoting the recycling of inactive oxidized ferric
  iron (Fe3+) to actively reduced ferrous iron (Fe2+) in vitro and in vivo. Activation/expression
  of TET2 is indirectly involved in the expression of muscarinic and adrenergic receptors
  in salivary glands through global DNA demethylation. Ascorbic acid-induced TET2
  promotes the expression of muscarinic and adrenergic receptors, which induce Ca2+signaling,
  thereby inducing salivary gland functional protein and ultimately maintaining saliva
  secretion.
