caption: Hormonal control of hepatic H2S production capacity occurs at multiple levels
  of regulation. Hypothalamic GHRH and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) induces
  GH and TSH production/release from the pituitary gland. TSH stimulates the production
  of T4 in the thyroid gland, which is a precursor to the active form of TH, T3. GH
  and TH positively regulate each other, and both suppress endogenous H2S production
  in the liver via independent and additive mechanisms. GH acts via growth hormone
  receptor (GHR), the adaptor protein IRS-1, and intracellular signal transduction
  via the JAK2/STAT5 pathway to inhibit H2S production, in part, through substrate-level
  control via negative regulation of autophagy. T3 binds to THR to negatively regulate
  CGL and CBS gene expression, as well as the transcriptional activator of CGL expression,
  ATF4. DR can also increase H2S production through numerous effects, including activation
  of ATF4 via the amino acid deprivation sensing response via GCN2 and p-eIF2α, as
  well as by increasing FGF21 expression (green), as well as effects on hypothalamic
  signals resulting in suppressed production/release and/or signaling of GHRH and
  TRH. ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; DR, dietary restriction; GCN2, general
  control nondepressible 2; GH, growth hormone; GHRH, growth hormone releasing hormone;
  T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; TH, thyroid hormone; THR, thyroid hormone receptor;
