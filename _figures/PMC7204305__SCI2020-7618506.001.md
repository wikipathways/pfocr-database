caption: Pathway description of protein acetylation. Protein acetylation is involved
  in the regulation of chromatin structure and transcriptional activity. Acetylation
  complexes (such as CBP/p300 and PCAF) or deacetyl complexes (such as Sin3, NuRD,
  NcoR, and SMRT) are recruited to DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) in response
  to signaling pathways. HATs induced histone hyperacetylation, which was associated
  with transcriptional activation, whereas HDACs induced histone deacetylation, which
  was associated with transcriptional repression. Many transcriptional coactivators
  have intrinsic acetylase activity, and transcriptional copressurization factors
  are associated with deacetylase activity. Histone acetylation stimulates transcription
  by remodeling advanced chromatin structures, attenuating histone-DNA interactions
  and providing binding sites for transcriptional activation complexes with proteins
  with containing brominated domains.
