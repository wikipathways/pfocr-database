caption: '(A) Schematic overview of the major synthesis and degradation pathways for
  PtdIns-3-P (PI3P), PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. The classes of PI3K (I, II,
  or III) that mediate reactions are indicated. Lipid phosphatases are in red. INPP4B,
  inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase, type II.(B) Domain structure of class I PI3K
  catalytic and regulatory subunits. ABD, adaptor-binding domain; RBD, Ras-binding
  domain; BH, breakpoint cluster region homology.(C) Diagram of the intramolecular
  interactions between class IA catalytic and regulatory subunits (p110α and p85α
  are displayed as well studied examples). Tight binding of the ABD to iSH2 confers
  stability to p110α. The other contacts shown in blue block arrows diminish basal
  activity and are relieved upon regulatory subunits binding to pTyr. Cancer-associated
  activating mutations are shown in green. SHORT syndrome mutation in p85α (R649W)
  is in purple.(D) Brief summary of key PI3K effectors: PDK-1, AKT, TEC family kinases,
  and GEFs/GAPs for small GTPases. AKT has many other important substrates not shown
  here (). The specific GEFs that mediate PI3K-dependent Rac activation to promote
  motility and aldolase release are not known.'
