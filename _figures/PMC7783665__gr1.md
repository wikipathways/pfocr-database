caption: A calcineurin-NFAT pathway for expression of cytokines and cell membrane
  proteins. After contacting pathogenic antigens, immune cells, such as dendritic
  cells, release cytokines such as IL2. Antigens, such as LPS trigger Ca2+, influx
  into the cell through activation of PLC to breakdown PIP into DAG and IP3. Ca2+
  released after binding of IP3 to its membrane receptor activates CaM and subsequently,
  calcineurin interaction with NFAT in order to facilitate its translocation into
  the nucleus for the transcription of cytokines and membrane proteins.
