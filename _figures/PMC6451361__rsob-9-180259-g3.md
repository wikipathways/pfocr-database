caption: Hunger-based control of olfactory circuits. (a) Starvation inhibits the release
  of DILPs, reducing insulin signalling in both attraction and avoidance ORNs. The
  reduced insulin signalling leads to increased expression of sNPFR and DTKR in the
  attraction and avoidance ORNs, respectively. In the attraction ORNs, sNPFR receives
  sNPF secreted from the same ORNs, which in turn enhances their attraction to food
  odours. By contrast, in avoidance ORNs, DTKR receives TK from LNs in the antennal
  lobe and consequently repress the synaptic output of avoidance ORNs. (b) Five MBON
  pathways (blue) that innervate different zones of the KC axons promote odour-driven
  food-seeking behaviour. These MBON pathways are regulated by their corresponding
  dopaminergic neurons (DANs; green), and these DANs receive different combinations
  of hunger and satiety signals. The MP1-MVP2-M4/6 MBON pathway also mediates hunger
  control of learned food-seeking behaviour.
