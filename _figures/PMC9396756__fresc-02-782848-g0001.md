caption: Intersection of the mechano-transduction pathway and the cycle of frailty.
  (A) Responsive mechano-transduction in youth. Mechanical load is sensed by a pliable
  cytoskeleton initiating the anabolic responses of both muscle and bone. (B) Impaired
  mechano-transduction in aging. Mechanical load is sensed by a rigid cytoskeleton,
  influenced by changes to the microtubule network, a consequence of aging related
  phenomena, leading to sarcopenia and osteopenia. These musculoskeletal pathologies
  feed into the cycle of frailty, where reduced strength and mobility, and reduced
  physical activity propagate the feed forward cycle.
