caption: The homeostatic response to hyperactivity at inhibitory synapses onto excitatory
  principal neurons (in red at the onset of hyperactivity; in yellow after the homeostatic
  response) consists of the upscaling of perisomatic synapses and a parallel downscaling
  of dendritic inhibitory synapses. The decrease in dendritic inhibitory synapses
  is exclusively dependent on REST and independent on BDNF and consists in the canonical
  effect of transcriptional repression of REST rapidly activated by hyperactivity.
  The upscaling of perisomatic inhibitory synapses is based on the activation of three
  sequential transcriptional waves. The first one consists the initial nuclear translocation
  of REST that exerts an early facilitating role on the fast onset of Npas4 transcription.
  The second wave involves the expression of the P1-Bdnf transcript by Npas4 that
  potentially restricts the functional changes to the soma of excitatory neurons.
  Finally, in the third wave, BDNF secreted by the excitatory neurons retrogradely
  reaches the inhibitory terminals and activates, via the TrkB signaling pathway,
  the transcription of effectors genes (Slc32a1 and Gad1) whose products (VGAT and
  GAD67) eventually increase the strength of perisomatic inhibitory inputs to excitatory
  target neurons through a presynaptic mechanism. Notably, REST is also involved in
  the late transcriptional inhibition of Npas4 and Bdnf, crucial to ensuring a temporal
  constrain to their expressional increase (created in BioRender.com).
