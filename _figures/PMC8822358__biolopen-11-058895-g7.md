caption: Mapping of mechanically stimulated amino acids in metabolic pathways. Amino
  acids that are bolded and underlined were upregulated in SW1353 cells that were
  exposed to compression and shear force. Those bolded only were upregulated in cells
  exposed to compression. Amino acids that are not bolded nor underlined were not
  detected (tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine). Intermediates of interest include
  ribose-5-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate.
  Additionally, pyrimidine metabolism was upregulated in samples exposed to 30 min
  of compression that stems from the pentose phosphate pathway.
