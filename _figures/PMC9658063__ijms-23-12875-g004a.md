caption: Schematic of metabolic pathways involved in MCF-7 cells with drug resistance.
  (A) Overview of changes in metabolic products in integrated energy metabolism pathways.
  The green frame indicates the pentose phosphate pathway. The red frame indicates
  the glycolysis pathway. The gray frame indicates the glycerol metabolism pathway.
  The green frame indicates the TCA cycle. The yellow frame indicates the hexamine
  biosynthesis pathway, and the blue frame indicates the amino acid metabolic pathway.
  Red arrows indicate metabolic products upregulated in the MCF-7-D500 cells, and
  green arrows indicate downregulated metabolic products. (B) The expression levels
  of metabolites significantly differed between the MCF-7 and MCF-7-D500 cells in
  their respective pathways. (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
