  factors like high fat and carbohydrate give rise to hepatocyte oxidative stress.
  This process generates excess ROS leading to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
  Moreover, NF-κB signaling and ER stress also induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  These influential factors ultimately aid the progression and pathogenesis of NAFLD.
