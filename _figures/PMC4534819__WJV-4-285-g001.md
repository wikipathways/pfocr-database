caption: Schematic representation of the purinergic pathway. ATP is broken down to
  ADP and AMP by NTPDase or directly to AMP by pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP).
  AMP is converted to adenosine by 5′-ectonucleotidase (CD73). Adenosine deaminase
  (ADA) transforms adenosine into inosine which is converted in hypoxanthine by purine
  nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). Xantine oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine
  to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid.
