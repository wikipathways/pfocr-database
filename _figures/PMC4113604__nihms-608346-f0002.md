caption: Schematic of miRNA transfer by exosomes. MiRNA overexpression is induced
  in a cell via transfection with an miRNA expression vector. MiRNAs are then selectively
  incorporated into the intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Exosomes
  containing miRNAs are derived from the MVBs and may be released into the extracellular
  environment via either fusion of MVBs with the cell surface or the budding pathway.
  Exosomes then may bind to the plasma membrane of a target cell. Recruited exosomes
  may either fuse directly with the plasma membrane or first be endocytosed and then
  fuse with the delimiting membrane of an endocytic compartment. Both fusionpathways
  result in delivery of the exosomal miRNAs to the cytoplasm of the target cell, where
  it may associate with and silence corresponding mRNA.
