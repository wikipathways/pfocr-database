caption: A total of 29 signaling pathways were identified in the subset of significant
  peptides recognized by a group of 10 phosphatases. Each phosphatase, as well as
  its corresponding edges, is color coded. Pathway node size corresponds to number
  of peptides belonging to that pathway cluster, while edge weight corresponds to
  the number of peptides in the pathway cluster recognized by the phosphatase. Pathway
  nodes that are over-represented when compared to a background list encompassing
  all peptides on the microarray (p<0.001515) are shown in white, while all other
  pathway nodes are grey.
