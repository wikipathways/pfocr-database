caption: Wnt signaling in hematopoietic stem cells and early B cell development. Wnt
  signaling is essential for HSC self-renewal capacity and is also active in precursor
  cells from fraction A. Fraction B pro-B cells, that undergo IgH rearrangement, have
  an active Wnt pathway and express high levels of LEF1 and Fzd9. Also, large pre-B
  cells from fraction C that greatly expand their population express LEF1 and Fzd9
  and have an active Wnt pathway. Small pre-B cells from fraction D stop proliferating
  and start rearranging IgL genes. Upon expression of IgM, Wnt pathway activity is
  expected to be terminated
