caption: Id2 in head and neck SCC regulates the expression of cyclin D1/cdks via NF-κB.
  Cyclin D1/cdks increases the progression of head and neck SCC cells by phosphating
  Rb-E2F complex. This action dissociates Rb-E2f complex and results in the releases
  of E2F from the Rb-E2F complex. E2F then enters into the nucleus and initiates the
  progression of cell cycle from G0/G1 to S phase. Cdks, cyclin-dependent kinases
  (cdks 4/6); Rb, retinoblastoma; p-Rb, phosphorylated Rb; E2F, a transcription factor
  that drives the transition from G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle.
