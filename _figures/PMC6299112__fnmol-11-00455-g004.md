caption: Proposed roles for miR-137 at the glutamatergic synapse. This figure summarizes
  the findings of ; , ; , and . miR-137 regulates presynaptic signaling by regulating
  vesicle trafficking in the axon terminal. miR-137 also targets the mRNA that encodes
  the L-type calcium channel subunit Cav1.2, which has also been linked to schizophrenia
  with genome-wide significance. Postsynaptically, miR-137 regulates the levels of
  glutamatergic receptor subunits GluA1 and GluN2A, and bioinformatic predictions
  suggest that miR-137 may target the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 as well
  as ErbB4, which regulates the strength of glutamatergic synapses. mGluR5 signaling,
  in turn, increases miR-137 levels. miR-137 also regulates proteins within the PI3K-Akt-mTOR
  pathway, e.g., p55γ, to regulate neuronal responses to BDNF and Nrg1 signaling.
  We propose that miR-137 may regulate PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling downstream of mGluR
  receptors as well.
