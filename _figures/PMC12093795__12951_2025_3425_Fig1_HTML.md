caption: Design and mechanism of “NCTD-C12 + lomi” nanoparticle to robust CCL4 production
  via Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway suppression.(A) Construction of the nano drug
  delivery system. This panel illustrates the assembly of a nanoscale drug delivery
  system, which encapsulates two distinct therapeutic agents within a single nanocarrier.
  (B) Regulation of chemokine CCL4 expression via Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway
  modulation. In the nanocarrier system, the encapsulated drugs act synergistically
  to inhibit the activity of the PP2A protein, leading to a coordinated downregulation
  of the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. This synergistic inhibition is correlated
  with an elevated expression of chemokine CCL4, suggesting a potentiated therapeutic
  response due to the nanoparticle delivery approach. In contrast, when the two drugs
  are administered in their free state, they do not exhibit a synergistic effect on
  the inhibition of PP2A protein or the downregulation of the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling
  pathway. The lack of synergy results in a lower expression of CCL4, indicating a
  diminished therapeutic impact compared to the nanoparticle-mediated delivery. Created
