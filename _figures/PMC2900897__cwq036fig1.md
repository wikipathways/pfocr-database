caption: Mapping of predicted Giardia enzymes onto the eukaryotic synthetic pathway
  for dolichol phosphate (Dol-P). Orthologs to Saccharomyces enzymes, which are present
  in Giardia (e.g. Rer2/Srt1, Alg7 and Dpm1) are marked in red. Saccharomyces Sec59,
  which appears to be absent in Giardia, is marked in orange. Enzymes that have not
  been molecularly characterized and so are not identified by searches with BLASTP
  (e.g. Dedol saturase) are marked in gray. Two alternative pathways for Dol-P synthesis
  in Giardia, which are tested by experimentation here, are the conversion of Dedol-P
  to Dol-P (marked in green) and use of Dedol-P rather than Dol-P for synthesis of
  N-glycans and GPI anchors (marked in blue)
