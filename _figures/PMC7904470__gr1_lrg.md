caption: 'A-to-I RNA editing of SARS-CoV-2: potential consequences on the host-virus
  interactions. Left panel. Double-stranded RNA of SARS-CoV-2 formed during replication
  can be recognized by cytosolic innate immune receptors MDA-5 and RIG-I leading to
  the activation of type I interferon (IFN) pathway, as well as hyper-activation of
  PKR, which ultimately leads to translational shutdown. Middle panel. Extensive A-to-I
  editing of the double-stranded RNA structure by ADAR enzymes could potentially prevent
  its recognition by innate immune receptors. Moreover, increased ADAR1 can directly
  interact with PKR preventing its hyper-activation. On the other hand, extensively
  edited dsRNA can be selectively degraded by endonucleases underlining the complex
  balance between pro- and anti-viral editing effects. Right panel. Site-specific
  RNA editing can have either pro-viral or anti-viral effects. A-to-I (G) substitutions
  in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can alter binding to ACE2 through various mechanisms
  including binding affinity, spike conformation or loading of the spike into virions,
  subsequently affecting viral infectivity. One such example is the D614G substitution
  (A-to-G point mutation; unknown origin) which has increased viral infectivity by
  ~10-fold. On the other hand, a non-sense mutation in one of the viral transcripts
  could prohibit viral protein synthesis and propagation. Certain items on this figure
