caption: Role of microRNAs in oral cancer progression. The transcription of miRNA
  genes by RNA polymerase II leads to the formation of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs),
  which undergo processing by the DROSHA/DGCR8 complex into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs).
  Exportin-5 (XPO5) transports pre-miRNAs to the cytoplasm, where DICER and TRBP further
  process them into mature miRNAs. The mature miRNAs associate with the RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC), guiding the complex to target mRNA for degradation or
  translational repression. Mutations affecting key components of this pathway, including
  the binding sites of target mRNAs or alterations in regulatory elements such as
  EGFR and transcription factors like MYC and ETS1/ELK1, contribute to the dysregulation
  of gene expression and promote oral cancer development
