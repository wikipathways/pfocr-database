caption: Outside-in signaling through class I PI3Ks. Class I PI3Kβ is particularly
  important for thrombus stability, and is activated downstream of αIIbβ3 via a pathway
  involving the kinases Src, Syk, and Pyk2. This leads to phosphorylation of the E3-protein
  ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, which associates with the p85 regulatory subunit of class
  I PI3K. Activated class I PI3Ks phosphorylate membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 to form PtdIns(3,4,5)P3,
  which leads to the recruitment and/or activation of a range of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding
  proteins. These include kinases such as BTK/Tec, PDK1, and AKT. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3
  can also regulate a range of GAPs and GEFs for small GTPases, including RASA3, dedicator
  of cytokinesis (DOCK) proteins, and Cytohesin-family members. Syk may also associate
  directly with the β3-integrin C-terminal tail. Hashed lines represent phosphorylation
  events; yellow circles represent activating phosphorylation; orange circles represent
  inhibitory phosphorylation.
