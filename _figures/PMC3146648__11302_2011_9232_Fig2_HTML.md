caption: Functional selectivity of the adenosine A1 receptor. The A1R can activate
  Gαs and Gαq/11 proteins besides the classical Gαipathway. The non-selective agonist
  NECA has higher intrinsic activity for these alternative pathways than A1R-selective
  agonists. The intrinsic activities of A1R-selective agonists such as CHA, CPA, and
  CPeCA for the alternative G proteins differ amongst each other as well. Allosteric
  modulators such as 2A3BT-class PAMs can bias signaling of orthosteric ligands. The
  endogenous enzyme ADA appears to function as a natural extracellular allosteric
  modulator of A1Rs, possibly in close cooperation with the intracellular scaffold
  protein Hsc73. Signaling through G proteins and β-arrestins converges at the level
  of ERK1/2 activation. Interaction with scaffold proteins like 4.1G protein may favor
  functional selectivity by stabilizing distinct receptor conformations. See references
  in the text for more detailed information
