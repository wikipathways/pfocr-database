caption: Regulation of lymphocyte behaviors and functions by the circadian clock.
  Circadian rhythms of lymphocyte behaviors and functions are regulated by the circadian
  clock at diverse aspects such as circulation of lymphocyte populations, recruitment,
  and egress to lymph nodes, tissue infiltration, cell differentiation, and maturation,
  as well as the release of cytokines, perforin, granzyme B and immune responses.
  The rhythmicity of these behaviors and functions are driven by clocks via different
  pathways such as the CCR7/CCL21 axis, CMIP, NF‐κB, S1pr1, and C1q. BCR, B‐cell receptor;
  CCR, CC chemokine receptor; CMIP, c‐Maf inducing protein; Nfil3, nuclear factor
  interleukin‐3; NK, natural killer; RORγt, retinoid‐related orphan receptor gamma
  t; S1pr1, sphingosine 1‐phosphate receptor 1; TH17, T helper 17
