caption: A hypothetical model for association of four subcomplexes in the FA core
  complex. The four predicted subcomplexes are indicated by different colors. FAAP24
  is a new component of the FA core complex that interacts with the C-terminus of
  FANCM and may target FANCM to structured DNA that mimics intermediates formed during
  the replication or repair of damaged DNA (). FANCD2 (red) and the E2 ubiquitin conjugating
  enzyme UBE2T (pink) may interact with FANCE () and FANCL (), respectively.
papertitle: FAAP100 is essential for activation of the Fanconi anemia-associated DNA
  damage response pathway.
