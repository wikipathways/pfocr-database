caption: Glutamate metabolism is a common feature of cancers, neurological diseases,
  and hyperammonemic diseases. Glutamate can be produced from γ-aminobutyric acid
  (GABA, green semicircle) through coupled transamination of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)
  via GABA transaminase. This reaction also produces succinate semialdehyde (green
  arrow). Succinate semialdehyde can then be converted to succinate by succinic semialdehyde
  dehydrogenase (SSADH), which can produce glutamate via the TCA cycle coupled with
  an α-KG-linked aminotransferase such as aspartate aminotransferase (AAT/GOT) or
  through glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Glutamate can also be produced through the
  hydrolysis of N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG, yellow semicircle) catalyzed by
  glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) (brown arrow). NAAG can be produced from glutamate
  and NAA via N-acetylaspartylglutamate synthetases A and B. NAA can be produced from
  aspartate and acetyl-CoA through aspartate N-acetyltransferase. Glutamine (red full
  circle) also acts as an important source of glutamate via direct conversion through
  glutaminase (GLS), or through the glutaminase II pathway intermediates - α-ketoglutaramate
  (KGM) and α-KG - initially catalyzed by glutamine transaminases (such as GTK) (red
  arrows). N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), shown in purple, is a receptor connected
  to cancer and neurological diseases. Metabolites are shown in black. Diseases are
  shown in blue. Enzymes are shown in red.
