caption: 'Differences in antigen processing reduce the capacity of macrophages for
  cross-presentation. Two different cross-presentation pathways have been described:
  the vacuolar pathway (left) and the cytoplasmic pathway (right). (1) Higher proteolytic
  activity in the macrophage phagolysosomes leads to a more rapid degradation of ingested
  antigens and limits their presentation on MHCI. (2) Macrophage capacity to translocate
  antigens from the phagosome to the cytosol is lower than in DC. As this step is
  critical for the cytoplasmic pathway, it limits cross-presentation in macrophages.
  (3) Finally, expression of the cytosolic exonuclease TREX1 is increased in macrophages
  in response to external stimuli such as irradiation or TLR4 agonists. this limits
  cGAS-STING pathway activation and type I interferon secretion, which facilitate
  antigen persistence in phagolysosomes and cross-presentation. cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP
  synthase; DC, dendritic cells; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MHCI, major histocompatibility
  complex I; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TAP, transporter associated with
  antigen processing; TLR, toll-like receptor; TREX1, three-prime repair exonuclease
  1.'
