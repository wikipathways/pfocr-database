caption: Functional mechanisms of COL2A1 on the BMP-SMAD1 pathway. The canonical BMP-SMAD1
  pathway is initiated with the oligomerization of BMPR1 and BMPR2 induced by BMPs.
  BMPR2 phosphorylates BMPR1, and BMPR1, in turn, phosphorylates the C-terminus of
  SMAD1 (Ser463/465). C-terminal phosphorylated SMAD1 proteins partner with SMAD4
  and translocate into the nucleus to initiate target gene transcription. ITGB1 is
  the major receptor for COL2A1, and upon its interaction with COL2A1, ITGB1 competes
  with BMPR1 for binding to SMAD1, thus inhibiting SMAD1S463/465 phosphorylation and
  nuclear import. COL2A1 can also regulate SMAD1 activity via ITGB1-induced ERK1/2
  phosphorylation. Activated ERK1/2 phosphorylates the linker region (Ser206) of both
  unphosphorylated and C-terminal phosphorylated SMAD1. The linker region-phosphorylated
  SMAD1 is resistant to phosphorylation by BMPR1 at the C-terminal, while the interaction
  between the C-terminal-phosphorylated SMAD1 and SMAD4 can also be interrupted by
  a second phosphorylation of the linker region of SMAD1. As a result, SMAD1 activation
  can be repressed via various signaling pathways specifically in response to COL2A1.
