caption: Glucose and glutamine metabolism is altered by oncogenic K-Ras. Oncogenic
  K-Ras directs glucose metabolism into biosynthetic pathways in PDAC by upregulating
  many key enzymes in glycolysis. Oncogenic K-Ras induces nonoxidative pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) flux to fuel increased nucleic acid biosynthesis and activates the
  hexosamine biosynthesis and glycosylation pathways. PDAC cells also utilize a non-canonical
  pathway to process glutamine, through which it is used to maintain redox and support
  growth. Enzymes that show increased activity under the control of oncogenic K-Ras
  are shown in red, and metabolites that are increased are boxed in orange. Glut1,
  glucose transporter 1; Hk 1/2, hexokinase 1/2; Pfk1, phosphofructokinase 1; Eno1,
  enolase 1; Pkm, pyruvate kinase; Ldha, lactate dehydrogenase A; Gfpt1, glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate
  aminotransferase-1; GlcN, glucosamine; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; Rpe, ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase;
  Rpia, ribulose-5-phosphate isomerase; GLUD1, glutamate dehydrogenase 1; GOT, aspartate
  transaminase; GLS, glutaminase; ME1, malic enzyme.
