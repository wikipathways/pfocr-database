caption: Quercetin inhibits overactivation of dormant PMFs induced by Cy. In normal
  circumstances, the dormancy or activation of primordial follicles was regulated
  by PI3K signalling pathway and the inhibitor factors secreted by growing follicles,
  such as AMH. Cyclophosphamide disrupts the balance of the PI3K signalling pathway
  and decreases AMH level by inducing apoptosis in growing follicles, resulting in
  the overactivation of the primordial follicles and the burnout of the reserve. Coadministration
  of quercetin and Cy prevents the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/Foxo3a pathway members
  and maintains AMH level through reduced apoptosis in growing follicles to restore
  the ovary to a state of equilibrium
