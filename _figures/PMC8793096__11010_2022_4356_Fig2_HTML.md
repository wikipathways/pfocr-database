caption: Challenged adipose tissue and exacerbation of COVID-19. A. Leptin, through
  its receptor-associated JAK/ STAT-dependent and independent pathways in central
  and peripheral tissues, regulates energy homeostasis, glucose and lipid metabolism,
  and immune function. It stimulates polarization of CD4 T-cells to a pro-inflammatory
  Th1 rather than anti-inflammatory Th2 type, activation of monocytes and macrophages,
  NK cell activation, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and neutrophil
  chemotaxis. Adiponectin acts through its two receptors, mediated via AMPK or PPARα,
  to promote fatty acid oxidation and inhibit lipogenesis, suppress mTOR and IKK-NF-kB-PTEN
  signaling, and improve insulin signaling. Adipose tissue produces pro-inflammatory
  cytokines of which levels depend on the relative levels of pro-inflammatory leptin
  and anti-inflammatory adiponectin. Adipose tissue also contributes to the RAAS pathway.
  B. Obesity is characterized by metabolic dysfunction, increase in inflammation,
  ER stress, immune impairment, RAAS dysregulation, and an increased thrombogenic
  state. Altered adipokine and cytokine production can result in systemic effects
  adversely affecting organ function. Increased leptin action causes increased immune
  cell-mediated inflammation with increased vascular permeability, neutrophil activation
  with neutrophilic extracellular traps, increased pro-inflammatory, and decreased
  anti-inflammatory cytokines and increased polarization of macrophages to a pro-inflammatory
  M1 type from an anti-inflammatory M2 type. It also results in depressed innate and
  adaptive immune response with reduced interferon response and decreased dendritic
  cell activity. Dysregulated adipokine production and Insulin resistance affect immune
  cell metabolism and diminishes immune response. Increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  decrease in adiponectin, and increased ER stress lead to endothelial dysfunction.
  Decreased adiponectin also leads to platelet activation. Increased tissue factor
  and PAI-1 from adipose tissue lead to activation of coagulation cascade and decreased
  fibrinolysis, respectively. Anti-fibrinolytic effect, hypercoagulable state, and
  activated platelet with endothelial dysfunction lead to a highly thrombotic state.
  This challenged system is further compromised by SARS-CoV2 entry that exacerbates
  inflammation and ER stress. It dysregulates RAAS, leading to loss of protective
  effect of ACE2 and accumulation of Ang-II, causing further ER stress and inflammation
  leading to more endothelial dysfunction. Impaired immune response, increased inflammation,
  and activated thrombotic state can increase severity of COVID-19 in obesity. Red
