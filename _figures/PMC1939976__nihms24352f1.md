caption: 'Signaling during SMC phenotype switching. The left side of the figure denotes
  pathways involved in signaling during SMC differentiation to the contractile phenotype.
  IGF-I causes expression of genes associated with the contractile, differentiated
  phenotype through the PI3K-Akt pathway, while at the same time blocks the Ras-MAPK
  pathway with the IPS-I/SHP2 complex. The right side of the figure denotes pathways
  involved in signaling during SMC phenotype switching to the synthetic phenotype.
  Several growth factors stimulate SMC phenotype switching by stimulating MAPK directly
  as well as by cleaving the IPS-I/SHP2 complex. MAPK transposition to the nucleus
  inhibits transcription of genes associated with the contractile phenotype and stimulates
  expression of genes associated with growth. Signals from each cascade inhibit the
  opposite cascade. IGF-I: insulin like growth factor-I; PDGF: platelet derived growth
  factor; EGF: epidermal growth factor; FGF: fibroblast growth factor; PI3K: phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; IRS-I: insulin receptor substrate-I; SHP2: Scr homology protein 2; MAPK:
  mitogen-activated protein kinase. p: phosphorylation'
