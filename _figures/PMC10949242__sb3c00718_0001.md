caption: Biosynthetic pathway of F420. The scheme is adapted from Bashiri et al.6
  The pathway represents the F420 synthesis using 2-phosphenolpyruvate (PEP) as a
  precursor. F420 can also be synthesized using 2-phospho-l-lactate (2-PL) or 3-phospho-d-glycerate
  (3-PG), in which case the dehydro-F420-0 is not formed, therefore no reduction step
  to F420-0 is required.6,7 Generally, the Fbi-prefix is used for the enzymes from
  mycobacteria, and Cof-represents the homologues from archaea
