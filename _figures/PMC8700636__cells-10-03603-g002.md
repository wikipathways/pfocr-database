caption: Model of epithelial alterations and IgA regulation in CF lung (adapted from
  []). Increased EMT parameters and de-differentiation of the respiratory epithelium
  are observed in CF (increased goblet and transitional cells and decreased ciliated
  cells). After ER stress and UPR activation, SC and S-IgA secretion is downregulated.
  Pa infection modulates this pathway (orange arrows). Pa drives host IL-17 response
  that stimulates PIGR expression and further increases ER stress and UPR activation.
