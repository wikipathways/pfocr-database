caption: Potential effect of UPR-AGR2 signaling pathways on goblet cells during ETEC
  infection. Compared with the normal intestinal environment (A), during ETEC infection
  (B), the most significant changes were the decreased secretion of mucin and reduced
  numbers of goblet cells. The UPR-AGR2 signaling pathway could be the chief regulator
  of these changes during ETEC infection in the intestines of weaned piglets. AGR2 = anterior
  gradient 2; ETEC = enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli; EGFR = epidermal growth factor
  receptor; MUC2 = mucin 2; UPR = unfolded protein response.
