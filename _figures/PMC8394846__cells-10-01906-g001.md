caption: Main signaling pathways of NF-κB activation. In the classical pathway, the
  IKK complex is activated in response to different molecules such as the pro-inflammatory
  cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, or lipopolysaccharides (LPS), followed by phosphorylation
  and degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, the release of the dimers of NF-κB
  and their translocation into the nucleus, where they induce the transcription of
  multiple NF-κB target genes. The activation of NF-κB through the alternative pathway
  depends on IKKα homodimers. It is activated in response to cytokines such as lymphotoxin
  β (LTβ), the B-cell activating factor (BAFF), or the CD40 ligand. NIK kinase phosphorylates
  and activates IKKα leading to the processing of p100 and the formation of the heterodimer
  RELB/p52, which enters the nucleus and regulates the transcription of target genes.
  In the atypical pathway of NF-κB activation described in keratinocytes, in response
  to TPA or UV light, CYLD translocates from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region
  where it deubiquitinates BCL3 and prevents nuclear accumulation of p50/BCL3 or p52/BCL3,
  thereby inhibiting the activation of NF-kB.
