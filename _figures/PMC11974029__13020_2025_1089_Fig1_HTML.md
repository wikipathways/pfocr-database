caption: Mechanisms through which berberine treats breast cancer involve modulation
  of the XRCC1 enzyme in BER. Berberine can activate a cascade of transcription factors
  via AMPK signaling pathway, leading to upregulation of XRCC1 gene expression. Additionally,
  it facilitates the role of XRCC1 in the repair process by means of NF-κB signaling
  pathway. Furthermore, it indirectly enhances XRCC1 activity by mitigating oxidative
  stress-induced DNA damage
