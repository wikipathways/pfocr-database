caption: '(A): Schematic depicting of the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R), which
  is an intracellular Ca2+-release channel located on the membrane of the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), and which belongs to the same family of the ryanodine receptors
  (RyRs). The conserved and widely abundant immunophilin FKBP12, which is a primary
  receptor for the immunosuppressant actions of TAC (FK506), has been demonstrated
  to physiologically interact with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)
  via a leucyl-prolyl dipeptide epitope that structurally resembles TAC (FK506). Here,
  we are postulating that TAC binding to FKBP12, likely through its structural mimicry
  to dipeptide epitopes on the FKBP12, sequesters this immunophilin from the IP3R,
  thus structurally destabilizing the channel conducive to a spiked release of [Ca2+]i
  from ER stores (arrow). Abbreviations: TAC (FK506): tacrolimus; IP3R: inositol triphosphate
  receptor; ER: endoplasmic reticulum. (B): Schematic depicting of the inositol triphosphate
  receptor (IP3R) [Ca2+]i-release pathway in trophoblast cells. The illustration depicts
  a potential mechanism through which TAC may influence [Ca2+]i-release along the
  IP3R pathway and its putative intracellular signal transduction pathways involved
  in F-actin cytoskeletal reorganization in trophoblast cells. [Ca2+]i-release in
  trophoblasts is normally a function of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated
  activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and the membrane-bound PI3K (which produces
  inositol triphosphate (IP3)). IP3 is a ligand for the intracellular IP3R channel
  of the internal Ca2+ stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is postulated
  that TAC influences [Ca2+]i-release via its binding to the immunophilin FKBP12,
  plausibly resulting in the destabilization of the ER’s IP3R [Ca2+]i-release channels.
  The observation that TAC was unable to release [Ca2+]i in trophoblast cells in the
  presence of the IP3R inhibitor 2-APB suggests a major role for this RYR channel
  in the presently proposed mode of action of TAC. This notion is also supported by
  the ability of TAC to release [Ca2+]i in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin,
  and the PLC inhibitor U73122. Moreover, PLC activation can also lead to the production
  of diacylglycerol (DAG), which in turn activates protein kinase C (PKC), contributing
  to F-actin polymerization through the phosphorylation of a large library of intermediate
  targets of Ca2+ binding proteins. Based on data obtained in the present study, it
  is presently unclear if TAC-induced [Ca2+]i-release can influence the activation
  of a multitude of Ca2+-binding proteins involved in the F-actin polymerization through
  the PKC signaling pathway. Abbreviations: TAC (FK506): tacrolimus; GPCR: G-coupled
  protein receptor; PLC: phospholipase C; IP3: inositol (1,4,5)3-phosphate; IP3R:
  inositol triphosphate receptor; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC: protein
