caption: The extrinsic coagulation pathway and activation of PARs and complements
  by active form of coagulation factors. PARs, C3aR and C5aR are expressed on the
  surfaces of skin mast cells and peripheral basophils. Since FVIIa, FXa, FIIa and
  plasmin are serine proteases, FVIIa activates target cells via PAR-2. FXa and FIIa
  activate various types of cells via PAR-1,2,3 and PAR 1,3,4, respectively. Fibrin
  is also able to promote an inflammatory response via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4.
  Moreover, activated coagulation factors (FXa and FIIa) produce C5a and C5b from
  C5, and C3a and C3b from C3.
