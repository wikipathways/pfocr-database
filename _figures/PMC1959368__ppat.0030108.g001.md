caption: Cells are capable of synthesizing cholesterol through the mevalonate pathway.
  This pathway also produces geranylgeranyl lipid, which is attached to the COOH-terminus
  of FBL2. Geranylgeranylated FBL2 binds to NS5A, an interaction required for HCV
  RNA replication. Lovastatin, an inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, blocks the entire
  mevalonate pathway. As a result, cells are depleted of geranylgeranyl lipid and
  replication of HCV is inhibited. PP, pyrophosphate.
