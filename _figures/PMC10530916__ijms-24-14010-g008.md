caption: (A) The potential signaling pathways that were significantly affected by
  ER stress-related genes. In this figure, the height of the histogram shows the significance
  of this pathway, and the higher the column, the higher the significance. The orange
  column indicates that the pathway is predicted to be activated, the blue column
  indicates that the pathway is predicted to be inhibited, the gray column indicates
  that the pathway cannot be predicted temporarily, and the white column indicates
  that it is not predicted to be activated or inhibited. (B) The signaling pathways
  of the potential upstream regulatory factor, TP53. In this figure, the genes in
  orange grids are predicted to be activated and the genes in blue are predicted to
  be inhibited. The orange line represents activation of downstream molecules, the
  blue line represents inhibition of downstream molecules, and the yellow line shows
  inconsistent relationships with downstream molecules.
