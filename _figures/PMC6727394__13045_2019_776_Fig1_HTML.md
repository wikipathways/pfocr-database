caption: Schematic representation of altered metabolic pathways and associated circRNAs
  in cancer. The characteristic features include two aspects. First, it illustrates
  deregulated uptake of glucose and amino acids, overactive fatty acid synthesis and
  oxidation, and NADPH overproduction. Second, it shows how circRNAs interact with
  these metabolic pathways by enzymes and TFs. HIF1-α and c-myc can adjust the Warburg
  effect-relevant enzymes and transporters. The majority of circRNAs can antagonize
  miRNAs to indirectly produce effects. In addition, circ-Amotl1 and circ_FBXW7 can
  directly affect TFs. The circRNAs in the dark blue rounded rectangle are considered
  to function in cancer cells, while the circRNAs in the light blue rounded rectangle
  are just proved to function in normal cells. miRNAs are in the green rectangle;
  the components affecting metabolism are in faint yellow rectangle. The positive
  relationships are shown by arrows, and the negative relationships are shown by short
  dashes. ACC, acetyl-COA carboxylase; ACSL, acyl-CoA synthetases; ASCT2, neutral
