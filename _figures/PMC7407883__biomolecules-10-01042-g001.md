caption: 'Schematic representation of the contact activation system. The contact of
  the blood with the artificial surface (polymethylpentene membrane) leads to the
  activation of factor (F) XII to FXIIa. FXIIa can then activate four different downstream
  pathways: (i) the coagulation pathway by cleaving the zymogen FXI to FXIa, eventually
  leading to thrombin activation and fibrin formation, (ii) the complement system
  by activation of the C1qrs-complex subunits C1r and C1s, (iii) the fibrinolytic
  pathway by plasma kallikrein activating plasmin to eventually degrade fibrin, (iv)
  the inflammatory kallikrein-kinin signaling pathway by plasma kallikrein cleaving
  high-molecular-weight kininogen liberating the pro-inflammatory molecule bradykinin
  []. Heparin and C1-INH are both able to inhibit one or more of these pathways. While
  heparin only inhibits coagulation, C1-INH positively affects coagulation, the complement
  system, fibrin degradation, and inflammation [,].'
