caption: The critical activity of EX-4 correlates with the induction of multiple downstream
  effectors from different signaling pathways. As previously mentioned, different
  biological processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis modulation are initiated
  through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/AKT) adenylyl cyclase/protein
  kinase A signaling pathways. In PI3K/AKT axis, the activation of PI3K phosphorylates
  Akt factor which in turn affects the dynamic of different factors. For example,
  it was mentioned that activated Akt could increase the level of nitric oxide (NO)
  by phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) and contributes to the modulation
  of nitrosative stress. Of note, EX-4 has the potential to regulate the function
  of neurons by the suppression of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). The decrease
  of GSK-3β function declines Tau protein phosphorylation thereby prohibits the aggregation
  of α-synuclein. Therefore, EX-4 is able to modulate the function of neurons and
  endothelial cells (ECs) during pathological conditions. It is noteworthy to mention
  that the application of EX-4 could decrease the cytopathic effects of Parkinson’s
  and Alzheimer’s diseases. In addition, it was well-established that the activation
  of microglial nuclear factor-ƙB (NF-ƙB) after administration of EX-4 provokes pro-inflammatory
  responses. One of the possible therapeutic effects of EX-4 on the injured cells
  could be related to the modulation of apoptosis. It was determined that the activation
  of Akt by EX-4 inhibits Caspase cascade such as caspase-9 and -3. In addition, the
  inhibition of pro-apoptotic factors such as Bad and Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription
  factors decreased apoptotic changes. The above-mentioned factors are thought to
  participate in different cell activities (). For instance, the critical role of
  EX-4 was determined in the regulation of β-cell proliferation via PI3K/Akt and mTORC1/S6K1-dependent
  signaling pathway. ,  In contrast to the induction of cell proliferation, and increased
  proliferation rate could be correlated with the abortion of lipotoxicity-induced
  apoptosis after induction of protein kinase B and inhibition of mitochondrial-derived
  Caspase 3 while the transcription of Bcl-2 was found to up-regulate under these
  conditions. ,  In addition to the therapeutic effects of EX-4 on insulin-producing
  cells, exposure of human endothelial cell lines to EX-4 pre-treated with apoptosis
  inducer tunicamycin decreased the possibility of atherosclerosis by reducing phosphorylated
  inositol requiring enzyme-1α/inositol requiring enzyme-1α ratio. Phosphorylation
  of c-JNK is also diminished in EX-4-treated human endothelial cell lines. Considering
  the detrimental effects of accumulated free acids in the promotion of endothelial
  apoptotic changes, initiation of endothelial active fatty acids metabolic reaction
  is thought to be an efficient strategy to reduce diabetic micro- and macro-vascular
  pathologies. However, cautions must be considered for the administration of Ex-4
  in diabetic candidates. For example, prolonged and continuous subcutaneous use of
  EX-4 possibly causes nausea, vomiting and a negligible increase in the heart rate.
  In addition, systemic intravenous injection of this compound was found to yield
  severe tachycardia and arrhythmias in non-diabetic and diabetes cases in the swine
  model.
