caption: APP processing and the production of the amyloid-β peptides. APP is synthesized
  as a type I transmembrane protein which initially undergoes cleavage at either α
  - or β-secretase sites to release large ectodomains, designated sAPPα  or sAPPβ,
  respectively. Ectodomain shedding leaves membrane-embedded fragments, C99 (99-residue
  C-terminal APP fragment) or C83 (83-residue C-terminal APP fragment), which are
  substrates for γ-secretase cleavage. Proteolysis of C99 by γ-secretase promotes
  the extracellular release of the amyloidogenic fragments (Aβ, toxic pathway) whereas
  proteolysis of C83 by γ-secretase generates an N-terminally truncated and non- toxic
  Aβ protein of 3 kDa (P3, non-toxic pathway). Evidence suggests that the progressive
  accumulation/oligomerization/aggregation of Aβ in brain regions subserving memory
  and cognition is the primary cause of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease.
  Proteolysis of C99 and C83 by γ-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain
  (AICD). Following association with the adaptor protein Fe65 and nuclear translocation,
  AICD is able to suppress the expression of the major apoE/lipoprotein receptor LRP1
  by binding directly to its promoter []. Thus, APP processing is also involved in
  the regulation of brain apoE (a major genetic determinant of AD) and cholesterol
  metabolism.
