caption: Summary of the related mechanism of treating CKD with CMM. TGF-β/Smad and
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways are two antifibrotic mechanisms that have been
  confirmed by a variety of TCM studies. Among them, Smad3 is pathogenic in renal
  fibrosis but Smad7 plays a protective role by negatively regulating the phosphorylation
  of Smad2/3 and NF-κB-driven inflammatory response. For the dual functions of Smad4,
  the therapeutic effect of CMM is to inhibit Smad3-dependent renal fibrosis. Besides,
  the sustained excessive reaction of abnormal activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway can lead to an increase in Col I and FN and ultimately lead to renal fibrosis.
  In the occurrence of glomerular hyperperfusion, hyperfiltration, and hyperglycemia,
  it causes oxidative stress and AGE activation, followed by a series of inflammatory
  reactions. In addition to inhibiting the activation of AGE, the antiinflammatory
  effect of CMM is also manifested in the inhibition of ROS-ERK1/2 and NF-κB-mediated
  NLRP3 inflammasomes.
