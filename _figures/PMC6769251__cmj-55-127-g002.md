caption: . The mechanism of BRAFV600E mutation negatively regulates sodium iodide
  symporter (NIS) and Integrin targeted imaging. On the one hand, BRAFV600E mutation
  promotes NIS silence by histone deacetylation (HDAC) of NIS promoter, on the other
  hand, BRAFV600E mutation promotes the secretion of transforming growth factor β
  (TGFβ), which, through the activation of SMADs and consequent impairment of the
  thyroid-gene transcription factor PAX8. BRAF oncoprotein can activate ERK1/2 signal
  through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, then thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)
  was upregulated, TSP-1 further positively regulates the expression of integrin,
  which in turn increases the level of ERK1/2 signal, forming a positive feedback.
