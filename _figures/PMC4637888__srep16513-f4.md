caption: Normally, STIL binds SUFU and free GLI1 for downstream gene transcription.
  Inactivation of Smo receptors by cyclopamine inhibits the Shh pathway, but the downstream
  Gli1 signaling can be resumed by overexpression of STIL. Activation of Smo receptors
  by purmorphamine promotes Shh signaling, but the effect of purmorphamine can be
  diminished by down-regulation of STIL expression. In mature cells, the increase
  of Gli1 transcription inhibits the Caspase-3 activity and thereby prevents cell
  apoptosis. In proliferating cells, the increase of Gli1 signaling promotes cell
  proliferating but may also lose its inhibition to Caspase-3 or activates other signaling
  transduction pathways that increase the cell’s drug sensitivity.
