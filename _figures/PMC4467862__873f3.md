caption: Model of crosstalk between erythropoiesis and iron metabolism involving TGF-β
  family member GDF11. Erythroid precursor proliferation and differentiation is regulated
  in part by multiple members of the TGF-β family. GDF11 binding to ActRII results
  in Smad2,3 phosphorylation and leads to the expansion of erythroid precursors and
  suppresses differentiation, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis and iron overload.
  Hepcidin expression in hepatocytes is stimulated through the iron pathway (through
  bone morphogenic protein receptor signaling and Smad1,5,8 phosphorylation) and suppressed
  through the erythropoiesis pathway (possibly through ERFE binding and signaling
  through a yet-unidentified receptor). ActRII, activin receptor IIa; BMP6, bone morphogenic
  protein 6; BMPR, bone morphogenic protein receptor; GDF11, growth differentiation
  factor 11; R-Smad, receptor-mediated decapentaplegic protein; R-Smad-P, phosphorylated
  R-Smad.
