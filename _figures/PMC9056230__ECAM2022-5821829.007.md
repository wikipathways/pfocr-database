caption: Compounds-targets-pathways for DO against hyperlipidemia network analysis.
  By assembling the core pathways acquired by analyzing C-T-P network (the green node
  refers to the compound, the red stands for the pathway, and the blue means the target),
  naringenin (MOL004328, degree = 37), isorhamnetin (MOL000354, degree = 37) and taxifolin
  (MOL004576, degree = 12) have a higher degree, indicating more mutual effect with
  targets and signaling pathway might be the core active compounds on anti-hyperlipidemia.
  By analyzing C-T-P network, we picked out 5 important signaling pathways that were
  significantly associated with DO treatment of hyperlipidemia. The 5 of chosen pathways
  including insulin resistance (degree = 8), Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (degree = 8),
  Pathways in cancer (degree = 8), AMPK signaling pathway (degree = 7) and thyroid
  hormone signaling pathway (degree = 7).
