caption: Schematic diagram of the antidepressant-like effect of Rb1 by potentiating
  synaptic plasticity via the miR-134–mediated BDNF signaling pathway in a mouse model
  of chronic stress. Long-term chronic and unpredictable mild stress increase the
  expression of miR-134 in the mouse hippocampus. The highly expressed miR-134 inhibits
  the activity of BDNF, thereby inhibiting its receptor TrkB and its downstream PI3K–AKT
  and MAPK–ERK pathways. Inhibition of both pathways reduces the phosphorylation of
  the Ser9 site of GSK-3β and then promotes the activation of GSK-3β. Activated GSK-3β
  reduces the stability of β-catenin, alleviates its binding to CREB in the nucleus,
  and regulates transcription and expression of genes, such as BDNF, PSD-95, GAP-43,
  and MAP-2. However, Rb1 can inhibit the expression of miR-134 and rescue the negative
  effects of miR-134 on the BDNF signaling cascade pathway during chronic stress,
  promoting gene transcription and expression and increasing hippocampal synaptic
  plasticity. These molecular changes may be the basis for the antidepressant-like
  effects of Rb1.
