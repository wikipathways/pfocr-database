caption: '(A) In well-oxygenated cells, glucose is metabolized to pyruvate, which
  is converted to acCoA by PDH for entry into the TCA cycle. Glucose-derived citrate
  is shuttled to the cytosol and converted to acCoA by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) for
  fatty acid synthesis. Glutamine is converted to αKG for entry into the TCA cycle.
  (B) In hypoxic cells, HIF-1 activates the transcription of several genes: (a) PDK1
  and genes encoding other isoforms of PDH kinase, which phosphorylates and inactivates
  PDH; (b) LDHA, which converts pyruvate to lactate; (c) other glycolytic enzymes
  and glucose transporters to increase flux through the glycolytic pathway; and (d)
  BNIP3 and BNIP3L, which trigger mitochondrial selective autophagy. To compensate
  for the reduced flux of glucose to citrate, reductive carboxylation of glutamine
  generates cytosolic citrate for fatty acid synthesis. Note the change in direction
  of the reactions catalyzed by aconitase (ACO1, ACO2) and isocitrate dehydrogenase
  (IDH1, IDH2) under hypoxic conditions. Blue circles indicate proteins that are products
  of HIF-1 target genes. Fum, fumarate; Mal, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate; Succ, succinate;
  Succ-CoA, succinyl coenzyme A.'
