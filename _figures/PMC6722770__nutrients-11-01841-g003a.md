caption: 'Indirect effects of prebiotics. (A) The general mechanisms of SCFAs. The
  SCFAs are metabolites derived from the fermentation of prebiotics by the microbiota.
  They are consumed by the microbiota or released into the biological systems (blood,
  gut, lung, placenta). They can interact with the cells by three mechanisms. In the
  first mechanism, the GPRs which are receptors coupled to signaling pathways (AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMP-K), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs),
  nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)) are involved.
  The second mechanisms correspond to the diffusion channels (solute carrier family
  16 member 1 (Slc) 16a1 and 5a8) that allow the SCFAs transport directly to cytoplasm
  and their potential interactions with pathways. By these two mechanisms, the signaling
  cascade is activated and can influence the transcription of genes by acetylation
  and deacetylation respectively via the histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and the
  histone deacetylases (HDAC) enzymes (epigenetic mechanisms). In the last mechanisms,
  there is a passive diffusion of SCFAs able to modulate directly enzymes (HDAC, HAT)
  involved in epigenetic processes. The modulation of genes expression by acetylation
  and deacetylation will have different consequences such as a modification of metabolism,
  cell cycle or microbial activity described in B,C. (B) The specific impact of SCFAs
  on epithelial cells. SCFAs (butyrate, propionate) can interact with the G-protein
  coupled receptor (GPR)43 receptor and activates the mTOR/STAT3 pathway allowing
  the modulation of genes to increase the expression of antimicrobial peptides such
  as regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma (RegIIIγ) and β-defensins. SCFAs can
  directly increase the epithelial barrier function by stimulating O2 metabolism in
  intestinal epithelial cell lines. This mechanism results in the stabilization of
  the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1). SCFAs interact also with
  the GPR 41 (acetate, propionate) and GPR43 receptors to activate the extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 and MAPK signaling pathway. In this way, epithelial
  cells produce inflammatory chemokines and cytokines during the immune response to
  protect the organism against aggressions or infections. The consumption of SCFA
  also increases the secretion of the antimicrobial peptide by epithelial cells. (C)
  The specific impact of SCFAs on IS. SCFAs can be found in the bloodstream. They
  can interact with different immune cell subtypes. In a first step they can modify
  the hematopoeisis of dendritic cells (DC) precursors in the bone marrow and induce
  CD11c+ CD11b+ DCs in lung-draining lymph nodes. The cells CD11c+ CD11b+ DC have
  a lower capacity to activate the Th2 cell which results in the reduction of allergic
  asthma. SCFAs are also able to modify in vitro the functionality of FMS-like tyrosine
  kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L)-elicited splenic DCs: a lower ability to activate T cell
  and to transport antigen to the lymph node and a lower expression of chemokine (C-C
  motif) ligand 19 (CCL19) on their surface decreasing their ability to move in different
  sites. In the lungs SCFAs are able to inhibit the enzyme HDAC9 resulting in an increase
  of the forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) transcription factor and then an increase of the
  number and the activity of Treg. In the intestine the increase of retinoic acid-synthesizing
  (RALDH) enzyme activity during the consumption of SCFA, allows the conversion of
  vitamin A to the retinoic acid in tolerogenic DC CD103 +. Then, the retinoic acid
  acts directly on T cells and induces their differentiation into Treg.'
