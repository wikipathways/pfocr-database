caption: ADCY family roles in cancer recurrence and prognosis. cAMP inhibits cancer
  formation by blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), inhibiting the
  antiapoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bcl-XI, upregulating the cancer suppressor gene
  p53, inhibiting the oncogenes c-myc and erbB-2, and inhibiting the regulation of
  the angiogenic pathway by VEGF, TGF-β, and EGFR. However, many cancers exhibit lower
  AC levels and lower cAMP levels, promoting cancer formation as well as cancer cell
  proliferation, reducing apoptosis, and even promoting neovascularization, cancer
  cell migration, and invasion.
