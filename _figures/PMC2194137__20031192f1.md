caption: Synthesis and structure of α-C-GalCer. (a) Overview of the pathway used to
  synthesize α-C-GalCer. The Ramberg–Backlund link-up was performed and the α-configuration
  was established. Protecting groups were removed and the C-26 fatty amide was installed.
  (b) Structural comparison of α-C-GalCer and α-GalCer, showing the main differences
  between the two molecules. Glycoside CH2 is nonpolar and hydrophobic; it repels
  hydrogen bond donors. In contrast, glycoside oxygen is polar and the electron pairs
  can form hydrogen bonds with N–H and O–H donors.
