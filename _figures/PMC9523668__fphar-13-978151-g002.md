caption: The mechanisms and related targets of H19 in lung diseases. H19 acts as a
  sponge for miR-140, miR-29b, and miR-196a to promote cellular fibrosis. H19 promotes
  cell hypertrophy by splicing to produce miR-675. H19 acts as a sponge for miR-21
  and miR-181a to promote cell proliferation. H19 promotes inflammation by acting
  as a sponge for miR-17, miR-29b-3p, and miR-140-5p and regulating the PI3K/Akt pathway
  through epigenetic pathways. H19 regulates cell death by binding to YB1 and acting
  as a sponge for miR-22-3p and miR-19b-3p. H19 promotes cell carcinogenesis by acting
  as a sponge for microRNA107 and regulating EZH2 expression through epigenetic pathways.
  H19 acts as a miR-29b-3p, miR-148b-3p, and miR-484 sponge and regulates the expression
  of CDH1 promoter through epigenetic pathways to promote cancer cell proliferation
  and metastasis.
