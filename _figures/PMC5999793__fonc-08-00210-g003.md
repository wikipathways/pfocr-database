caption: Schematic model of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation
  by phospho-p62 (A). In normal cells, the ETGE and DLGex motifs of Nrf2 bind to the
  Keap1DC domain, which promotes ubiquitination of Nrf2 followed by its proteasomal
  degradation. (B) In human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, phospho-p62 (pS349) competitively
  interacts with the DLGex site on Keap1DC, resulting in the translocation of Nrf2
  into nucleus. (C) K67 binds to Keap1DC at higher affinity than phosphor-p62, whereas
  the DLGex motif of Nrf2 binds to Keap1DC with covering K67. Nrf2 is eventually ubiquitinated
  and degraded by the proteasome.
