caption: EBNA3C interacts with oncogenic serine/threonine Pim-1 kinase. This molecular
  association stabilizes Pim-1 by inhibiting its Poly-ubiquitination. EBNA3C also
  promotes Pim-1 mediated p21 degradation. EBNA3C contributes to B-cell proliferation
  by activating oncogenic Pim-1 which leads to inhibition of the growth suppressive
  property of p21 as well as impeding intrinsic apoptosis signaling. This molecular
  strategy for oncogenic Pim-1 kinase targeted by EBNA3C for inhibition of p21 function,
  and it can be a potential therapeutic target for EBV-associated malignancies.
