caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanism of action of nimbolide in diethylnitrosamine

  activity of ZO-1 associated nucleic acid binding protein at a junctional site preventing
  its nuclear accumulation and thus preventing the induction of cell cycle related

  which prevent translocation of growth factors and nutrients necessary for cell growth
