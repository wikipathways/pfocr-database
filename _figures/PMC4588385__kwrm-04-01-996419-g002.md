caption: Wnt signaling regulates the asymmetry of the larval seam cell divisions.
  (A) In wild type animals, each seam cell divides once per larval stage to generate
  anterior hypodermal daughter (‘hyp’) that differentiates and a posterior daughter
  that maintains the seam cell fate (‘SC’) and the ability to divide further (vertical
  arrow). (B) When Wnt signaling pathway activity is reduced, seam cells are seen
  to divide symmetrically to generate 2 daughters that adopt the anterior ‘differentiated
  cell’ fate. (C) When Wnt signaling pathway activity is increased, seam cells are
  seen to divide symmetrically to generate 2 daughters that adopt the posterior 'progenitor
  cell' fate.
papertitle: The C. elegans embryonic fate specification factor EGL-18 (GATA) is reutilized
  downstream of Wnt signaling to maintain a population of larval progenitor cells.
