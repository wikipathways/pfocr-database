caption: 'Key components of the stress response signaling network in C. elegans. This
  diagram depicts a summary of our current knowledge of the molecular interactions
  between six signaling pathways known to play an important role in stress response.
  These interacting pathways regulate cellular responses induced by specific (e.g.,
  insulin) or general (e.g., heat) exogenous signals, usually via the activation of
  receptor (e.g., IGF1R), which in turn activates a series of kinases and other proteins
  (ovals) that maintain specific signaling states within the cell. Ultimately, these
  signals change either co-activator binding or the protein conformation of transcription
  factors (rectangles; e.g., FOXO), which are responsible for downstream responses
  via the transcriptional activation of large suites of genes. The overall pattern
  of interwoven signaling across the network leads to a strong prediction of pleiotropy
  within this system, which is usually verified by the phenotypic outcomes of mutations
  in key pathway components. Protein families or human protein names are given first,
  with the C. elegans gene listed below those names. References (indicated by superscripts
  on pathway labels): 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6Honjoh et al. (2009); 7; 8; 9; 10.'
