caption: NMI inhibits cancer progression. NMI expression in epithelial cells inhibits
  the Wnt and TGFβ signaling pathways. NMI also increases the expression of DKK1,
  the secreted inhibitor of the LRP 5/6 receptor in the Wnt pathway. In addition,
  NMI increases levels of active GSK3β, thereby targeting β‐catenin for degradation.
  In parallel, NMI also binds STAT5 to enhance expression of its target gene SMAD7,
  the inhibitory SMAD, and subsequently dampens TGFβ signaling. In the absence of
  NMI, β‐catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and is translocated to the nucleus where
  it binds TCF/LEF transcription factors to enhance transcription of Wnt pathway target
  genes. Decreased expression of NMI leads to enhanced transcription of EMT master
  regulators SLUG and ZEB2 downstream of TGFβ signaling. As a result, cells that have
  lost NMI undergo morphological changes and become more invasive and metastatic.
