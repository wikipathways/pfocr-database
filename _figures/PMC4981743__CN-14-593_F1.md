caption: 'Pathophysiology of Diabetic neuropathy: Glucose induced osmotic stress,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant depletion results in the formation
  of intense oxidative stress inside neuronal cells. Glucose is also found to activate
  JNK and protein kinase pathway (PKC). JNK activation leads to the facilitation of
  activator protein-1 (AP-1) directed expression of tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β)
  and other cytokines, which reduces vascular supply to the nervous tissue. Oxidative
  damage to mitochondria results in release of pro-apoptotic mediators from the mitochondria
  and also causes damage to electron transport chain components (ETC). This eventually
  results in apoptosis and bioenergetic dysfunction associated with DN. Glucose induced
  advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its further association with receptors
  for AGE (RAGE) also involved in activation of NF-κB heterodimer and thus releases
  proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α
  (TNF-α), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) release and thus produces neuroinflammation. Further,
  lack of insulin, neurotrophic signaling leads to reduced PI3K/AKT mediated neurogeneis
  and thus may promote demyelination observed in chronic neuropathies.'
