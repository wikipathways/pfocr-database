caption: 'Heatmap of DEGs in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of Disanthus cercidifolius
  var. longipes. Note: DEGs were identified using limiting adjusted p-values < 0.05
  and |log2 fold change (FC)| ≥1. Yellow ovals represent DEGs, and gray ovals indicate
  a difference in gene expression that was not significant. The color scale from minimum
  (blue) to maximum (red) indicates the levels of gene expression from low to high.
  In the heatmap, gene expression was calculated using Z-scores of Fragments Per Kilobase
  per Million (FPKM) mean values of three biological replicates. Cluster indicators
  on the right side of the heatmap denote the names of each gene'
