caption: 'Schematic diagram depicting TKI-activated NFKB2-MIF/CXCLs-CXCR2 compensation
  pathways responsible for the survival and proliferation of AML blasts. After TKI
  treatment, cytotoxicity-induced injury signals might directly activate the non-canonical
  NFKB2 (P100/P52) pathway to release more MIF, CXCL5, CXCL8 and other tumor-promoting
  cytokines. MIF might act as an autocrine signal to initiate the survival mechanism*
  through MIF-CD74/CD44 pathways. Meanwhile, MIF-CXCR2, CXCL5-CXCR2 and CXCL8-CXCR2
  pathways might be responsible for cell proliferation by activating CDK4/CYCLIN E-based
  transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle progression. * pBAD-BCL2: Phosphorylation
  of BAD has been restored by PIM family compensation pathways to prevent its binding
  to BCL-2, allowing blasts to survive the TKI treatment. Red color indicates the
  key molecules in this study.'
