caption: Schematic diagram of mitochondrial function of chondrocyte in OA. Cytokines
  and other stimuli mainly lead to chondrocytes apoptosis through mitochondrial apoptosis
  pathway. The key chondrocyte signal transduction pathways include the JNK pathway,
  the PI-3K/Akt pathway, the NF-κB pathway, and the p38/MAPK pathway. Phosphorylation
  and inactivation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 could suppress its anti-apoptotic
  activity and induce the escape of Cyto c. The JNK and NF-κB pathways promote p53
  to upregulate pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax and Bim. The aggregations of these
  pro-apoptotic molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines further impair mitochondrial
  integrity. Compared with normal chondrocytes, the MRC of OA chondrocytes showed
  that the activity of complexes I, II, and III and ΔΨm were significantly decreased.
  Inhibition of MRC can lead to insufficient electron transport, causing a decrease
  in ATP production. Mitochondrial damage not only reduces the efficiency of bioenergy
  production, but also increases the ROS production. Antioxidant defense system cannot
  eliminate excessive ROS and lead to oxidative stress. Then, oxidative stress interferes
  with cell regulation mechanism and further causes cell apoptosis. Excessive mtROS
  also increases the risk of mtDNA mutations and ATP synthesis disorders, which deteriorating
  mitochondrial dysfunction. At the same time, mitochondrial dysfunction disrupts
  Ca2+ homeostasis. Excessive accumulation of Ca2+ leads to the opening of mitochondrial
  PTP and the damage of mitochondrial membrane structure. The entry of H2O molecules
  into the mitochondria leads to an increase in mitochondrial mass, which ultimately
  results in the swelling and the degradation of mitochondria. In damaged mitochondria,
  pro-apoptotic cytokines such as Cyto c escape from the mitochondrial intermembrane
  space via membrane pore proteins and bind to cytoplasmic scaffolding protein Apaf-1
  to activate protease 9 and 3. Pro-apoptotic proteins induce the occurrence of the
  mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway. Finally, chondrocyte apoptosis promotes
  the occurrence of OA. OA = osteoarthritis; JNK = c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PI-3K/Akt
  = phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-protein kinase B; NF-κB = nuclear factor-κB; MAPK
  = mitogen-activated protein kinase; Bcl-2 = B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2; Bax = Bcl-2-associated
