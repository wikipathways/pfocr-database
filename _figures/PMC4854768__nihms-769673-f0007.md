caption: RvE1 is synthesized through neutrophil-endothelial cell crosstalk from EPA.
  Endothelial cells produces an RvE1 intermediate, 18R-hydroxy-EPA, through the 15-LOX
  pathway (either a 15-LOX or an acetylated COX-2 by aspirin). The leukocyte processes
  18R-hydroxy-EPA through the 5-LOX pathway to produce RvE1, the final active mediator
  that is released to act locally having a short half-life. Synthetic RvE1, which
  has a longer half-life, inhibited neutrophil infiltration in different disease models
  including peritonitis, colitis, acute lung injury, asthma and periodontal disease.
  It also promoted molecular pathways characteristic to the resolution phase of inflammation.
