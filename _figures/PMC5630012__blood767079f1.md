caption: Schematic representation of coagulation initiation and amplification. (A)
  In the current paradigm, activation of the FVIII and FV cofactors is considered
  to be primarily a thrombin-mediated feedback reaction, although a key role of FXa
  in relation to thrombin has been demonstrated for FV activation. (B) The coagulation
  scheme supported by the present studies highlights in addition the newly identified
  selective activation of FVIII by nascent FXa within the extrinsic TF-FVIIa-FXa initiation
  complex prior to inhibition by TFPI. By concurrently activating FIX, the extrinsic
  TF-FVIIa complex can initiate directly the FVIIIa-FIXa antihemophilic pathway. The
  2 depicted mechanisms of coagulation activation may be variably integrated in response
  to different stimuli.
