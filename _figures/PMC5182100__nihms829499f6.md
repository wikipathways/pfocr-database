caption: C-signal appears to be a proteolytic fragment of CsgA and/or lipids produced
  by CsgA phospholipase activity. Involvement of CsgA in production of C-signal was
  inferred from isolation of csgA mutants whose development could be rescued by addition
  of wild-type cells [, ]. Purification of a factor from wild type capable of rescuing
  a csgA mutant identified a 17 kDa fragment of CsgA called C-factor or p17 [, ].
  p17 was shown to be associated with the outer membrane [], where it is produced
  from full-length CsgA (p25) by a protease called PopC [] (, top pathway). Secretion
  of PopC is controlled by its inhibitor, PopD, which is degraded upon starvation
  in a RelA-dependent process that involves the protease FtsHD []. According to this
  model, p17 is C-signal. An alternate model is that cardiolipin phospholipase activity
  of intact CsgA releases diacylglycerols from the inner membrane that are C-signal
  [] (, bottom pathway). This model is supported by analysis of a csgA suppressor
  mutation that causes overexpression of socA [], which codes for a cardiolipin phospholipase
  [], by mutational analysis ofcsgA [], and by developmental rescue of a csgA socA
  mutant by a lipid fraction enriched in diacylglycerols from Myxococcus []. The two
  models for the identity of C-signal are not mutually exclusive.
