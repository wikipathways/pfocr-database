caption: Global gene expression by B. burgdorferi throughout the enzootic cycle is
  modulated in large part by the ON and OFF states of two major regulatory networks–the
  Hk1/Rrp1 two component system and the RpoN/RpoS pathway [,,]. During acquisition,
  exogenous as yet unidentified small molecules generated during tick feeding activate
  an Hk1-dependent signaling cascade that culminates in phosphorylation of Rrp1 and
  synthesis of c-di-GMP [–,–]. Binding of c-di-GMP by PlzA (liganded-PlzA) promotes
  transcription of the glpKFD operon and other tick-phase genes, presumably by binding
  to an upstream “PlzA box” [,,,]. At the same time, transcription of rpoS by the
  BosR/Rrp2/RpoN complex ceases and spirochetes transition from an RpoS-ON to -OFF
  state [,,]. To expedite the switch from an RpoS-ON to -OFF state, liganded-PlzA
  interferes with transcription by residual RpoS allosterically by, in essence, acting
  as a ‘brake’ on RNAP-RpoS holoenzyme. The absence of rpoS/RpoS within fed larval
  midguts allows for unfettered expression of RpoD-dependent tick-phase genes (i.e.,
  glps, ospA, lp6.6) that are repressed by RpoS in mammals [,,,]. During transmission,
  c-di-GMP signaling also is activated (i.e., ON) in response to tick-specific signals,
  again allowing for expression of the glp operon and other tick-phase genes that
  are upregulated by liganded-PlzA [,,,,,]. In contrast to acquisition, however, during
  transmission, BosR/Rrp2/RpoN-dependent transcription of rpoS is induced [,,], making
  this the only point within the enzootic cycle when both the c-di-GMP and RpoN/RpoS
  pathways are ON. Based on findings presented herein, we postulate that the ‘RpoS-brake’
  function of liganded-PlzA prevents RpoS-mediated repression of tick phase genes,
  which are required for survival within fed midguts, while at the same time allowing
  transcription of RpoS-upregulated genes required for transmission (i.e., bba64)
  and/or early infection (i.e., ospC, dbpBA) [,,]. Once within the mammal, loss of
  c-di-GMP signaling (i) restores RpoS’s Gatekeeper function and (ii) enables unliganded-PlzA,
  working directly or indirectly via an unidentified interactive partner, to assume
  its alternative, c-di-GMP-independent virulence-related function(s).
