caption: Schematic model for RNF125 and Cbl-b in LPS-induced endotoxemia. When mice
  receive a sub-lethal dose of LPS, LPS triggers (1) TLR4 to initiate a MyD88-dependent
  signaling pathway, which activates NF-κB and induces the expression of NLRP3 and
  pro–IL-1β and (2) TRIF-dependent pathway that induces the expression of Casp-11.
  LPS also undergoes endocytosis and binds its cytosolic sensor Casp-11 to induce
  oligomerizations of Casp-11, which cleaves GSDMD to liberate its N-terminal domain
  (NTD). NTD may trigger the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the
  release of IL-1β without inducing pyroptosis. RNF125 targets the NLRP3 LRR domain
  for K63-linked polyubiquitination. The K63 ubiquitin chains attached to the NLRP3
  LRR domain recruit Cbl-b by binding its UBA region. Cbl-b then ubiquitinates NLRP3
  at K496 within its NBD and targets NLRP3 to the proteasome for degradation, thus
  keeping the NLRP3 inflammasome in check. In the absence or inactivation of Cbl-b,
  mice are highly susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxemia. However, when mice receive
  a lethal dose of LPS exposure, LPS binds to Casp-11 and mainly triggers Casp-11–mediated
  pyroptosis via GSDMD. Cbl-b is unable to control this noncanonical inflammasome-induced
  lethality. CARD, caspase recruitment domain; PYD, pyrin domain; TKB; protein tyrosine
  kinase-binding; L, linker region; RF, Ring finger; P, peptide; PR, proline-rich
  region; Toll/IL‐1R domain–containing adaptor‐inducing IFN‐β. Red arrows indicate
  activation or induction, whereas the blue dashed arrow indicates possible activation.
