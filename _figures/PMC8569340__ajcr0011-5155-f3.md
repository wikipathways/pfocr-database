caption: Collaborations of Akt, MAPK, and JAK/STAT pathways in suppressing the anti-cancer
  immune system. Under hypoxic conditions provided by Akt signalling, PD-L1 is expressed
  by breast cancer cells to inhibit T-cells. Three main signalling pathways are involved.
  RTKs triggers PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, whereas cytokine receptors (CR) are activated
  by cytokines released into the TME. JAK/STAT signalling is then activated to recruit
  STAT1/3 and other transcription factors on some specific gene promoters including
  the PD-L1 promoter. Simultaneously, proliferation and metastasis are activated and
  anti-cancer immunity inactivated. S6 and CSN are ribosomal protein S6 and components
  of the eukaryotic translation factors 3 (eIF-3) complex, respectively, involved
  in protein synthesis. “Redesigned from Pharmacological Research, Volume 156, Jabbarzadeh
