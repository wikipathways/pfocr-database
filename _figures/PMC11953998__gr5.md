caption: Schematic illustrations showing different nano-targeting systems achieving
  precise mitochondrial localization and killing tumor cells through mtDNA perturbation
  (a–b) and metabolism disruption (c–d). (a) Vir-ZM@TD mimicked herpesvirus infection
  to trigger innate immunity in tumor therapy. ATP-responsive DNAzymes cleaved TFAM
  mRNA, causing mtDNA stress [72]. (Reproduced with permission, copyright 2022, Wiley-VCH.)
  (b) MIDRS comprised DNA/Mg2+ nanoflowers with cytochrome C aptamer, Cas12a/crRNA,
  and quenched chlorin e6 (Ce6). MIDRS remained inert in circulation but disrupted
  mitochondrial respiration in tumor cells. Cas12a recognized mtDNA SNVs, releasing
  Ce6 to restore photosensitivity. Laser irradiation generated ROS, damaging mitochondria
  and activating the cGAS-STING pathway to enhance immune response [76]. (Reproduced
  with permission, copyright 2023, Science.) (c) PEG and TPP functionalized the 2D
  WS2 nanosheets to load glycolysis inhibitor FX11. FX11@TPEG-WS2 targeted mitochondria
  via TPP and induced apoptosis by disrupting glycolysis under ultrasound [90]. (Reproduced
  with permission, copyright 2023, Wiley-VCH.) (d) TDNs-G-TPP targeted mitochondrial
  energy metabolism, inhibiting aerobic respiration and glycolysis, reducing ATP production,
  and blocking lamellipodia formation to suppress migration of tumor cells [98]. (Reproduced
