  MiRNA''s predicted to target steroidogenic or metabolizing enzymes are encased in
  blue. Genes measured as either up‐ or down‐regulated in our current study after
  a specific hormone replacement therapy are marked by colored circles. The effects
  exerted by [E2+NETA] are depicted in green, the effects exerted by [E2] in red,
  and the effects exerted by [T] in gray. a) Steroid hormone biosynthesis: Cytochrome
  P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to
  the hormones dehydroepidandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, which
  are further metabolized to estrone (E1) and 17β‐estradiol (E2) by CYP19A1 (aromatase).
  Androgen conversion to estrogen in adipose tissue by CYP19A1 is an important source
  of bioactive endogenous estrogens among postmenopausal women. Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  3ß1 (HSD3ß1) catalyzes the interconversion of pregnenolone and progesterone and
  of DHEA and androstenedione, whereas HSD17β1 catalyzes the conversion between androstenedione
  or testosterone and E1 or E2, respectively. The availability of HSD17β1 is regulated
  by a number of miRNAs, which are inhibited both by [E2+NETA] and [E2]. b) Estrogen
  metabolism: The ‘sulfatase pathway’ converts stored estrogen sulfates into the bioactive
  unconjugated E1 and sulfotransferases convert estrogens into the biologically inactive
  estrogen sulfates. The CYP‐family of enzymes consists of a cluster of enzymes that
  function in the oxidative metabolic activation and deactivation of compounds including
  several steroid hormones. E1 and E2 undergo 2‐hydroxylation by the CYP1A1, CYP1A2
  and CYP3A4 enzymes and 4‐hydroxylation by CYP1B1. Catecholestrogens are deactivated
  by catechol‐O‐methyltransferase (COMT). UDP‐glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1),
  crystallin zeta, quinone reductase (CRYZ), glutathione S‐transferase alpha 1 (GSTA1)
  and sulfotransferases (SULT1/2) are detoxifying enzymes that convert endogenous
  substrates to inactive metabolites. CRYZ is inhibited by miRNA‐186 and ‐21, which
  are negatively regulated by [E2+NETA], potentially resulting in an accumulation
  of catechol estrogen quinines, which are potential initiators of breast cancer.
  c) Progesterone metabolism: Aldo–ketoreductase family 1 member C4 (AKR1C4) catalyzes
  the conversion of progesterone and androstenedione to their corresponding alcohols.
  d) Gene transcription: Progesterone, testosterone and E2 bind to their respective
  nuclear receptor proteins, progesterone receptor (PGR), androgen receptor (AR) and
  estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), and activate genes with corresponding responsive
  elements resulting in gene expression of genes with such responsive elements. The
  expression of PGRA/B is up‐regulated by [E2], whereas those of ESR1 and of AR are
  down‐regulated by [E2+NETA]. e) Growth factor receptors and cell division: Two genes
  encoding membrane bound receptors, EGFR (alternatively symbolized as HER1) and ERBB2
  (HER2), both considered being breast cancer oncogenes, are down‐regulated by [E2+NETA],
  whereas a number of kinases and cell‐division cycle genes, such as CDK1, CDC20 and
  CCNE2, are up‐regulated by [E2+NETA] or, in the case of CCNE1 by [E2]. In contrast,
  CTSD, which encodes cathepsin D and which is often used as a breast cancer tumor
  marker (Cavalieri et al., 2006), is down‐regulated by [E2+NETA]. (For interpretation
