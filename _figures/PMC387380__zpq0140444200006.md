caption: Working model of potential mechanisms of DA receptor signaling and sites
  of action of the different pharmacological agents used in this study. In red, regulation
  of the Akt/GSK-3 pathway by DA. Elevated DA tones lead to activation of GSK-3 through
  a signaling cascade involving D2-class receptors and the inactivation of Akt caused
  by a reduction of its phosphorylation on Thr-308. This reduction in Akt activity
  results in a reduced phosphorylation/increased activation of GSK-3α and GSK-3β that,
  in turn, regulate DA-associated behaviors. Note that, in contrast to DARPP-32, the
  phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3 was not affected by cAMP. Dashed lines indicate
  the effect of different drugs on this signaling cascade. D1R, DA D1 receptor; D2R,
  DA D2 receptor; AC, adenylyl cyclase.
