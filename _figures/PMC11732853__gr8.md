caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the distinct and synergistic effects of Mg2+,
  H2, and OH- released from biodegradable Mg on bone regeneration. (A) During the
  early osteoporotic fracture healing, the implantation of Mg-IMN releases Mg2+, H2,
  and OH- into tissues surrounding the fracture site. (B) The three degradation products
  directly enhance osteogenesis and reduce inflammation. Specifically, H2 and OH-
  (which create an alkaline pH environment) increase cell proliferation, while Mg2+
  may primarily improves the extracellular matrix (ECM). (C) Mg2+, H2, and OH- contribute
  comparably to improved bone regeneration when implanted with Mg-IMN. This process
  involves the activation of sensory pathways and inhibition of sympathetic signaling.
  Notably, Mg2+ and H2, but not OH-, increase the synthesis of CGRP and inhibit adrenergic
  receptors
