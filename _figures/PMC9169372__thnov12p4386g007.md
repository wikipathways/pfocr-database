caption: Mechanism model for PIPKIγ-mediated oxaliplatin resistance in CRC. PIPKIγ
  is frequently expressed in CRC cells with oxaliplatin resistance. Highly expressed
  PIPKIγ induces the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and subsequent transcription
  of PD-L1 in CRC cells. Then, PD-L1 is packaged into the exosomes and transferred
  to the oxaliplatin-sensitive CRC cells, which display lower expression of PIPKIγ.
  PD-L1 finally contributes to oxaliplatin resistance though modulation of DNA damage
  response. Hijacking PIPKIγ-exosomal PD-L1 axis with UNC3230, Bay11-7082, or GW4869
  largely reverses oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells.
