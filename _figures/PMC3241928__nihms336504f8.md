caption: '(A) Pten/Braf/Bcat-STA melanomas are characterized by rapid growth, high
  degree of melanocytic differentiation, and extensive metastasis. These phenotypes
  are associated with increased MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt signaling as well as elevated
  Mitf and Pin1 levels. Bold text: relatively increased levels and/or activity compared
  to other models, blue shading: relatively decreased compared to other models, red
  shading: genetically inactivated, *: stabilized.(B) Pten/Braf melanomas exhibit
  rapid tumor growth, but only intermediate melanocytic differentiation and metastasis.
  Signaling pathway activation, Mitf, and Pin1 are intermediate in this model.(C)
  Pten/Braf/Bcat-KO melanomas exhibit tumor growth, but significantly reduced melanocytic
  differentiation and almost no metastasis. Inactivation of β-catenin in this model
  is associated with reduced PI3K/Akt signaling and Mitf levels.(D) Braf/Bcat-STA
  melanomas are characterized by long latency and slow tumor growth, as well as lack
  of metastases. These tumors are differentiated and heavily pigmented due to high
  Mitf levels, but show reduced PI3K/Akt pathway activation.(E) A three-pathway synergy
  is observed when MAPK/Erk, PI3K/Akt, and β-catenin/Mitf signaling pathways are simultaneously
  activated in melanoma. If any of these three changes is not present, the metastatic
  melanoma phenotype is abrogated.'
