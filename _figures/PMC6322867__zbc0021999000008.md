caption: Roles of FakB1 and FakB2 in S. aureus physiology. Exogenous FA, either saturated
  (SFA) or monounsaturated (18:1), are incorporated into membrane phospholipids following
  activation by FA kinase. SFA are bound to FakB1 and FakB2 prefers 18:1, although
  it can bind SFA as indicated by the dotted line also. Both fatty acid-binding proteins
  are substrates for FakA-mediated phosphorylation. The acyl-phosphates bound to the
  FakBs are then transferred to either PlsY (sn-glycero-3-phosphate (G3P) acyltransferase)
  to form acyl-G3P (LPA) to initiate membrane phospholipid (PL) synthesis, or to PlsX,
  which converts the acyl-phosphate to acyl-ACP. Acyl-ACP enters the elongation cycle
  of fatty acid biosynthesis (FASII). The origin of cellular FA in S. aureus is unknown,
  but CETSA data suggest FakB1 functions to bind these saturated FA for activation
  by FakA and re-cycling into the PL biosynthetic pathway. FakB2 can substitute for
  FakB1, but its unique function is to activate extracellular host 18:1 to be utilized
  for phospholipid lipid synthesis at the infection site.
