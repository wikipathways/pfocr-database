caption: Schematic representation of IGF signaling involvement in EMT. The two main
  signaling pathways downstream the IGF-IR are both involved in the regulation of
  transcription factors of the Twist, Snail, and ZEB1 families, all involved in the
  EMT program. The IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation
  of GSK3β, thus preventing the phosphorylation and proteasome targeting of Snail
  and Slug. The same pathway also induces the activation of NF-kB transcription factor,
  which then increases the transcription of Snail and ZEB1. On the other hand, the
  Ras/Raf/ERK pathway is involved in the transcription of Twist and ZEB1. In turn,
  Snail inhibits PTEN gene transcription, thus potentiating the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway.
  In addition, Slug increases the transcription of IGF-I, the main IGF-IR ligand.
