caption: (A) Endosomal acidification is regulated by the V-ATPase, which pumps protons
  into the endosome lumen, and NHE9, which allows for proton movement out of the endosome
  via exchange with Na+ or K+. The endosome is alkalinized when there is proton leakage
  as a result of increased NHE9 expression or activity, and inversely acidified when
  there is a loss of NHE9 function. (B) Endosomes are trafficked through a series
  of pH-defined compartments that can lead either to i) recycling back to the plasma
  membrane, or ii) degradation within the lysosome. Luminal pH could regulate the
  activity of acid hydrolases and/or the sorting of endosomes along distinct pathways.
  A major fate of endocytosed EGFR under high ligand conditions is delivery to lysosomes
  for degradation. The model proposes that endosomal alkalization resulting from increased
  NHE9 activity diverts EGFR trafficking away from lysosomes and thus increases its
  membrane persistence. This results in activation of oncogenic downstream signals
  that lead to increased cell migration and tumorigenesis.
