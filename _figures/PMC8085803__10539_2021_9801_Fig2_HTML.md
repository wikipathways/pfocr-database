caption: Neuroendocrine regulation of immunity via the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal
  axis. In this graphic, we show the predicted pathogen concentration signalled by
  IFNγ derived from Th1-lymphocytes. This is subtracted from the complement pathway
  activation (playing the role of sensory data) detected by macrophages to give a
  prediction error (εy) represented by the IL-12 levels released by macrophages. Intuitively,
  the presence of unanticipated pathogens prompts an increase in macrophage activation.
  This prediction error may be resolved in two ways. The first is to decrease the
  amount of pathogen through phagocytosis and oxidative killing. The second is to
  increase the Th1 response (μx) to update predictions (IFNγ) so that they are consistent
  with the presence of pathogen. The degree to which the Th1 response is increased
  depends upon two things. The first is prior beliefs about the amount of pathogen
  expected. Deviation from this prior is indicated by the prediction error (εx), which
  may be intrinsic to T-cell populations. The second is the precision or inverse variance
  associated with the predicted pathogen concentration. If the variance is assumed
  to be very high, the effect of the prediction error (εy) on the expectation (μx)
  is attenuated. Here, we have assumed the expected variance is a function of some
  variable v whose expectation (μv) is signalled by cortisol from the adrenal cortex.
  This means that, when cortisol is high, the Th1 response to macrophage-derived cytokines
  is more limited. To update beliefs about variance, we can penalise deviations from
  a prior value as before (εv), but the prediction error from y has to be handled
  more carefully. As variance is a second order statistic (the expectation of a squared
  quantity), we need to square the prediction error (as shown in the hypothalamus)
  and compare this to the current estimate of the variance. These (respectively) account
  for the cytokines released by macrophages and detected by the hypothalamus, and
  for the negative feedback from the adrenal cortex to the anterior pituitary—shown
  as the point at which the square prediction error and variance are compared (with
  ξv representing their ratio)
