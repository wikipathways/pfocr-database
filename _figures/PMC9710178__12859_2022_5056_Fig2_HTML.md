caption: Flow chart of ChiMera processes. ChiMera has 3 submodules that can be used
  separately. The ones signed with “C” are part of the core module, which performs
  model creation, evaluation and creation of visualization files. “T” represents the
  translator module that adds KEEG pathway information to the compounds in the edges
  file. The file can be loaded into Cytoscape or Gephi for visualization. “K” represents
  the knockout module, which performs gene and reaction knockouts. “V” represents
  the use of outputs created by ChiMera to create custom maps by third-party tools
  based on user needs
