caption: Mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. The UPR is triggered
  by several events, including protein unfolding/misfolding, hypoxia, low adenosine
  triphosphate levels, ER calcium depletion, and protein/sterol over-expression, causing
  dissociation of 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) from the three UPR sensors,
  (A) inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), (B) protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic
  reticulum kinase (PERK), and (C) activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6). Activated
  IRE1α undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation to generate endogenous RNase
  activity; in turn, this is responsible for splice truncation of X-box binding protein
  1 (XBP1S) mRNA. Additionally, IRE1α may also activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway,
  in which tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)-dependent
  downstream activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and caspase-12 takes place.
  Once activated, PERK undergoes homodimerisation and autophosphorylation to activate
  eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). In turn, this induces ATF4 expression.
  Separately, dissociation of GRP78, allows ATF6 processing by the Golgi complex,
  where proteases S1P and S2P cleave an active 50 kDa (p50) ATF6 domain that is free
  to translocate to the nucleus. Xbp1s, ATF4 and ATF6, as well as other unlisted factors,
  are responsible for three dominant cell responses to UPR. The folding pathway induces
  increased expression of molecular chaperones, including GRP78, assisting in compensatory
  ER protein folding. Alternatively, the cell may respond by increasing ER-associated
  protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, whereby gene products target and degrade unfolded
  proteins in the ER. Prolonged UPR results in the activation of the intrinsic apoptosis
  pathway; this ATF6 and ATF4-dependent process induces C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP)
  expression. In turn, CHOP inhibits B-cell lymphoma 2 and induces apoptosis.
