caption: The regulatory pathways of ferroptosis. The figure shows the regulatory pathways
  of ferroptosis, which can be roughly divided into three categories. The first is
  regulated by the GSH/GPX4 pathway, such as the cystine/glutamate anti-transporter
  SystemXC−, the sulfur transport pathway, and arachidonic acid and other related
  pathways. The second is the regulatory mechanisms of iron metabolism, such as the
  regulation of NCOA4 and IREB2 related to ferritin metabolism, and the regulatory
  pathway of ferroportin-related STEAP3, all have an effect on free iron content,
  ultimately causing the Fenton reaction. The third category is related pathways of
  lipid metabolism, such as ACSL4, LPCAT3, ALOXs, etc., which have the role of lipid
  regulation and ferroptosis.
