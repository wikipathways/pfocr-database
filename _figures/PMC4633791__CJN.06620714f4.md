caption: Newly recruited CD4+ T-cell soldiers induced to be spies. Professional soldier
  lineage CD4+CD2−CD127hiFOXP3− T cells can fail to be activated into effector cells
  when they contact antigen. This figure illustrates four pathways that will be described
  in order from top to bottom. (1) Anergy is induced when there is no Signal 2, and
  these cells, when re-exposed to specific antigen with activated antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs), are not activated and do not proliferate or produce IL-2. This occurs
  in the absence of inflammation and activated APCs (pathway 1). (2) Induced T regulatory
  cells (iTregs) are induced by TGF-β and antigen when there is no IL-6 or IL-1β (pathway
  2). These cells express FOXP3 and CD25 but can revert to effector T cells, because
  FOXP3 expressions are not stable. (3) In the mucosa, to induce oral tolerance, TGF-β
  and antigen can induce Th3 cells that can express FOXP3 (pathway 3). Th3 cells suppress
  by release of TGF-β. (4) Tr1 cells are induced by repeated culture with antigen
  and IL-10, which converts the APCs to DC-10 cells (pathway 4). They do not express
  FOXP3 or CD25 and suppress by release of TGF-β and IL-10.
