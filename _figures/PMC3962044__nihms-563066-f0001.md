caption: NF-κB signaling pathways in osteoclast lineage cells. a In basal conditions,
  IκBα sequesters p65 and p50 in the cytosol, keeping the classical NF-κB pathway
  off. TRAFs 2 and 3 bring NIK and cIAP1/2 together, causing ubiquitination and degradation
  of NIK, preventing activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway. b Both pathways
  are activated by RANKL. In the classical NF-κB pathway, adaptor proteins TRAF2/5/6
  support the activation of TAK1 and IKKβ, leading to proteosomal degradation of IκBa.
  Released p65/p50 dimers then move into the nucleus, where p65 regulates the transcription
  of target genes. In the alternative NF-κB pathway, TRAF3 is degraded by cIAP1/2
  uibiquitination after it binds RANK. The stabilized NIK leads to partial degradation
  of p100. Without sequestration by the IκB domain in p100, p52/RelB dimers translocate
  to the nucleus, marking the activation of the alternative pathway
