caption: Roles for the Epac–PLCɛ pathway in cardiac calcium release A, treatment of
  isolated cardiac myocytes with 10 μm 8-CPT activates Epac and PLCɛ, ultimately leading
  to CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2 and either enhancement () or inhibition
  () of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). PKC activation of CaMKII is proposed to
  provide a link between the observed PLCɛ- and CaMKII-dependent effects. PLCɛ Rap
  guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) activity is also shown to potentiate Rap
  activation and trigger additional downstream signalling pathways that may impact
  susceptibility to hypertrophy. B, Oestreich et al. provide evidence that activation
  of the Epac–Rap–PLCɛ pathway occurs in parallel with PKA activation under conditions
  of strong β-AR stimulation. Thus, during concerted PKA and Epac activation, RyR2
  activity is shown to be influenced by both PKA and CaMKII phosphorylation and SR
  depletion prevented by PKA-dependent SERCA activation.
