caption: A novel pathway essential for canonical leptin signaling in hypothalamic
  neurons. Leptin activates signaling pathways to control the expression of appetite-regulating
  neuropeptides [proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP)] in
  hypothalamic neurons. The canonical Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)–signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway is shown in blue. In red
  is the newly discovered NSAPP pathway that we showed to be essential for producing
  an intracellular burst of H2O2 that inhibits key protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases),
  thereby allowing canonical leptin signaling to propagate. Normal leptin signaling
  is required to suppress appetite and to stimulate white adipose tissue (WAT) browning
  and brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity. Pointed arrowheads indicate
  stimulation of the immediately downstream molecule or process; flat arrowheads indicate
  inhibition. Specific phosphorylation sites are indicated within yellow ovals. The
  double line indicates the plasma membrane; all molecules above it are extracellular,
  and all named molecules below it in the schematic are intracellular. The leptin
  receptor (LepRb), NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4), and aquaporins are transmembrane molecules.
  Solid lines represent experimentally demonstrated pathways; dotted lines are less
  well-characterized or putative. Adapted from Ref. (–).
