caption: Upon exposure to antigen and the proper interleukin milieu, CD4+ Th0 cells
  commit to either the Th1 or the Th2 lineage. As classically described, ‘type 1’
  immune responses are typified by proliferation and activation of Th1 cells via exposure
  to certain interleukins including IL-12 and IL-18. Activated Th1 cells release characteristic
  cytokines such as IL-2 and interferon γ (INFγ) (among others) in response to pathogens.
  The ‘type 2’ response is typified by proliferation and activation of Th2 cells and
  release of their characteristic cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 (among others) in
  response to extracellular, for example, parasitic, pathogens. How the appropriate
  immune response is chosen upon a particular threat has been the focus of much research
  and debate. Cells that first encounter invading pathogens (antigen-presenting cells)
  present foreign antigens to Th0 cells. Antigen presentation in combination with
  secretion of specific cytokines promotes the commitment of Th0 cells towards one
  lineage over another, and the initiation of a counter immune response to the infection
  (reviewed in REF. ). In the presence of an antigen, direct stimulation of ST2L or
  exposure to IL-4 appears to be sufficient for the activation of Th2 cells and the
  release of Th2-associated cytokines. Exposure to IL-33 results in chemotaxis of
  Th2 cells and the release of Th2-associated cytokines. IL-33 can coax the release
  of Th2-associated cytokines from mast cells as well as basophils. IL-33 might also
  promote superoxide production and degranulation of eosinophils. Interestingly, recent
  evidence hints at a more promiscuous role for IL-33 as it has been found to induce
  INFγ release from antigen-exposed Th2 cells, natural killer (NK) cells and invariant
  NK T cells. To regulate this IL-33 mediated type 2 response, soluble ST2 (sST2)
  in the extracellular environment might act as a decoy, binding free IL-33 available
  to ST2L. Recently, it has been shown that a soluble form of the IL-1 receptor accessory
  protein (IL-1RAcP) might serve as a co-decoy, enhancing the ability of sST2 to inhibit
  IL-33 signalling.
