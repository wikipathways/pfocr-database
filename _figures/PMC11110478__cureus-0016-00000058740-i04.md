caption: 'IL-6 stimulates an intracellular signaling pathway: STAT-3 (A), whereas
  TNF-α, IL-17, IL-1, TLR ligands, and growth factors stimulate another intracellular
  signaling pathway: NF-κB (B). In nonimmunocompetent cells, when STAT-3 and NF-κB
  are stimulated at the same time, NF-κB becomes excessively activated, resulting
  in excessive production of IL-6 (C). Large numbers of IL-6 act via autocrine (D)
  and paracrine (E) signaling, promoting much more IL-6 production following STAT-3
  activation. We defined these positive feedback mechanisms that mediate IL-6 as “IL-6
  Amp” in a narrow sense. Nonimmunocompetent cells activated by IL-6 Amp produce various
  types of chemokines (F). These chemokines stimulate immunocompetent cells such as
  macrophages, T cells, and B cells (G). Various types of chemokines produced by these
  immunocompetent cells stimulate STAT-3 and NF-κB in nonimmunocompetent cells again
  (H), which consequently produce much more IL-6 and chemokines. We defined this mechanism
  as “IL-6 Amp” in a broad sense. Thus, IL-6 Amp can occur when adequate amounts of
  both IL-6 to activate STAT-3 and TNF-α and IL-1 or IL-17 to activate NF-κB are present.
  Throughout the course of IL-6 Amp, tremendous numbers of cytokines and chemokines
  are produced, which we call “cytokine storm syndrome” (I).TNF: tumor necrosis factor;
  STAT-3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; TLR: toll-like-receptors;
  MDSC: myeloid-derived suppressor cell; DC: dendritic cell; TCL: tumor cell lysate'
