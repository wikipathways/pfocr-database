caption: Subcellular distribution of FoxO1 driven by nutritive stimuli in white/beige
  adipocytes. Upon fed state, phosphorylated FoxO1 (p-FoxO1) localizes in the nucleus,
  cytoplasm, and mitochondria. The insulin signal activates the AKT pathway phosphorylating
  FoxO1. The phosphate group is an anchor for binding to 14–3–3 proteins in the cytoplasm.
  In the nucleus, p-FoxO1 is inactive, binds 14–3–3, and shuttles to the cytoplasm.
  In mitochondria, FoxO1 binds mtDNA mitigating the mtDNA-encoded gene expression.
  Upon fasted state, FoxO1 is dephosphorylated by PP2A in the cytoplasm, migrating
  to the nucleus to induce lipid catabolism (ATGL, LIPA) and antistress response genes
  (SOD2, UCP1). The fasted state induces proline oxidase/dehydrogenase (POX/PRODH)
  that produces mitochondrial ROS that activates PTPMT1. The dephosphorylation permits
  mitochondrial FoxO1 exclusion and increased mtDNA-encoded genes expression. Then,
  FoxO1 could be degraded or recruited to the cytoplasm/nucleus.
