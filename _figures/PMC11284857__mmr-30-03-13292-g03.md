caption: Depicted regions primarily reside within the dental follicle tissue surrounding
  the root apex. Overexpression of β-catenin in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  promotes differentiation of DFCs into cementoblasts, thereby enhancing cementum
  formation. Conversely, loss of Tgfbr2 and Smad4 in the TGF-β signaling pathway,
  as well as BMP2 deficiency in the BMP signaling pathway inhibits the formation of
  cementoblasts, Eventually, an excess or deficiency of cementum can result in abnormal
  root development. The excessive upregulation of Wnt10b and β-catenin in the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway leads to a significant increase in bone mass by promoting osteoblast
  differentiation. The loss of the Tgfbr2 in the TGF-β signaling pathway inhibits
  the differentiation of DFC into osteoblasts, leading to the block of alveolar bone
  formation. Loss of Ptch1 receptors inhibits the proliferation of DFCs, thereby affecting
  tooth eruption. BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; DFC, dental follicle cell; Ptch1,
  patched 1; Tgfbr2, TGF-β type 2 receptor
