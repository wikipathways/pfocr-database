caption: 'Interactions between BAs and Other Viruses. (A) STH manifests antiviral
  activity against IVA infections through the modulation of signaling pathways, including
  TLR4/NF-κB; (B) CDCA demonstrates the capacity to attenuate IAV infections by inhibiting
  the nuclear export of vRNPs; (C) CDCA can reduce virus-induced lipid synthesis,
  inhibiting the replication of rotavirus; (D) CDCA activates FXR and TGR5 receptors
  to counteract HBV infection; (E) GCDCA enhances the virulence of norovirus through
  a mechanism that is not yet clarified. STH: sodium taurocholate; TLR4: Toll-like
  receptor 4; CDCA: chenodeoxycholic acid; vRNPs: viral ribonucleoproteins; IAV: influenza
  A virus; GCDCA: glycine deoxycholic acid; FXR: Farnesoid X Receptor; TGR5: Takeda
  G Protein-Coupled Receptor 5; HBV: hepatitis B virus'
