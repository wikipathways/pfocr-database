caption: 'Schematic of the non-canonical role of c-PINK1 in neuronal function. Conditional
  proteolytic processing: In healthy neurons, most mitochondria are highly functional,
  as evident by an adequate ΔΨm that enables the import of PINK1 via the TOM-TIM protein
  import complex at the OMM and IMM, respectively. In healthy mitochondria, PINK1
  is cleaved by PARL and MPP at the IMM, and the cleaved PINK1 (c-PINK1) is retro-translocated
  to the cytosol to exert extra-mitochondrial functions. PINK1-PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling;
  Mitochondria with optimum ΔΨm proteolytically processes f-PINK1 to c-PINK1. The
  c-PINK1 stabilizes and retro-translocated to the cytosol and phosphorylates the
  catalytic subunit of PKA and enhances PKA mediated CREB activation, resulting in
  upregulated BDNF expression and release. BDNF, a neurotrophic factor augments neuronal
  plasticity. c-PINK1 degradation through N-end rule pathway: The N-end rule specific
  E3 enzymes UBR1, UBR2, and UBR4 recognize the N-terminal phenylalanine residue of
  c- PINK1 for proteasomal degradation. AKT activation: Activation of PINK1 leads
  to phosphorylation of cytosol localized AKT. Mitochondrial movement: f-PINK1 phosphorylates
  Miro1 to arrest mitochondrial movement. However, c-PINK1 can activate PKA-mediated
  phosphorylation of Miro2 to enhance the anterograde movement of mitochondria in
  dendrites and axons. Anti-apoptotic: PINK1 interacts with and phosphorylates Bcl-xL,
  an anti-apoptotic protein, hindering the pro-apoptotic cleavage of Bcl-xL. Degradation
  of misfolded proteins: Parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1 form a PPD complex to promote ubiquitination
  and degradation of Parkin substrates and PINK1 mutation leads to decreased degradation
  and accumulation of abnormally folded Parkin substrates.'
