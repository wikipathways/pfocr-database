caption: Under hypoxia, the potential neuro-endocrine-immune/metabolism networks contribute
  to the regulation of moderate inflammation and the maintenance of energy balance.
  Hypoxia may inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and induce the
  expression of ET-1/ADM, and the latter then promote the expression of IL-6/TNF-α
  and form a positive feedback loop with them. On the other hand, the ET-1/ADM and
  IL-6/TNF-α may in turn activate the HPA axis, and the latter subsequently induces
  glucocorticoids and generates a negative feedback to inhibit ET-1/ADM and IL-6/TNF-α
  expression to reduce the inflammatory responses in brain. Therefore a HPA axis-ET-1/ADM-IL-6/TNF-α
  feedback regulatory loop is outlined here. Besides, both SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 may have
  complementary roles in down-regulating IL-6 and TNF-α, and both IL-6 and TNF-α have
  reciprocal functions to induce SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 expression, thus constituting a
  SOCS-1/3-dependent feedback regulation to modify cerebral inflammation. The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid
  (HPT) axis was inhibited in L. crocea brains during the early period of hypoxia,
  thus leading to a decrease in thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) production. Decrease of
  HPT axis-thyroid hormones subsequently may inhibit protein synthesis by the PI3K-Akt-mTOR-S6K
  signaling pathway, which contributes to the reduction in energy consumption during
  hypoxia stress. Meanwhile, down-regulation of HPT axis-thyroid hormones also represses
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and accelerates the anaerobic glycolytic pathway,
  which facilitates O2-independent ATP production under hypoxia. Therefore the HPT
  axis-mediated effects may play roles in response to hypoxia by reorganizing energy
  consumption and generation. Genes related to the neuro-endocrine system (orange),
  immunity (red), and metabolic system and protein synthesis (blue) are indicated.
  The outer border indicates the brain of L. crocea. The arrow represents promotion,
  and the interrupted line represents inhibition. Solid lines indicate direct relationships
  between genes. Dashed lines indicate that more than one step is involved in the
  process.
