caption: 'Interactions of Brucella spp. with the immune system. After the activation
  of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with Brucella antigen via the Toll-like receptor
  (TLR) signaling pathway, a cascade of events leads to the priming of CD4+ T cells
  to helper T cells type 1 (Th1) and type 2 (Th2). Th1 cells secrete various cytokines,
  such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, which activate and enhance the anti-Brucella mechanisms
  of macrophages and activate CD8+ T cells, which boost the immune responses of macrophages
  even further. Moreover, APCs can trigger Th2 activation, which switches on B lymphocytes
  and the humoral immunity, facilitating the opsonization and faster eradication of
  the pathogen from the host''s body. It is noteworthy that Th1 and Th2 cells can
  inhibit either pathway via secreting cytokines, such as IFN-γ and IL-10, respectively.
  Furthermore, macrophages can be stimulated by secreting another cytokine called
  type III interferons or interferon-λ by APCs or epithelial cells. These activated
  macrophages exert their immunomodulatory effects through two different pathways:
  direct and indirect. In the direct pathway, chemokine and inflammatory cytokine
  expression, antigen recognition and presentation, and macrophages'' cytotoxicity
  are elevated. Through the indirect pathway, these cells can enhance natural killer
  (NK) and T cell chemotaxis and NK cell cytotoxicity and elevate the production and
  release rate of IFN-γ, which in turn, via activating the Th1pathway, helps better
  and faster eradication of Brucella spp. Abbreviations: TLR: Toll-like receptor;
