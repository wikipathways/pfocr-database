caption: Only differentially expressed genes (DEG) related to ABA, ET and auxin biosynthesis,
  signaling and response, present in Drought and Bacteria&Drought datasets, are indicated
  in the schemes of each hormone pathway. Expresssion levels (log2 fold change) are
  represented as colors and symbols. Red stands for downregulated and blue stands
  for upregulated genes. For each hormone pathway, the DEG are identified with numbers.
  For more detailed function of each regulated gene, see .
