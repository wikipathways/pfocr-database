caption: 'Oxidative inactivation of PTEN in immune responsiveness: Ischemia or inflammation
  can lead to elevated plasma cytokines, which stimulate myeloid cells to produce
  NOX2-derived ROS. These ROS mediate the AKT signaling pathway by inhibiting PTEN
  and trigger granulopoiesis, promoting the proliferation and differentiation of immune
  cells. These cells engage in immune reactions while also contributing to anti-apoptosis
  and remodeling processes'
