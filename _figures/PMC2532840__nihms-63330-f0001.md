caption: 'The notion that the 4’-aminopyrimidine group of thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)
  undergoes tautomerization to the 1’,4’-imino form (1’,4’-iminoThDP) during the catalytic
  cycle of enzymes that utilize it has gained wider acceptance since the appearance
  of X-ray crystal structural data (). The role and likelihood of tautomerization
  is suggested by two totally conserved structural features on all ThDP enzymes: (a)
  the V coenzyme conformation ensuring that the C2 thiazolium atom and the N4’ atom
  of the 4’-aminopyrimidine ring are within less than 3.5Å from each other (), potentially
  enabling the 1’,4’-imino tautomer to participate in proton transfers; and (b) the
  presence of a glutamate within hydrogen bonding distance of the N1’ atom of the
  4-aminopyrimidine ring, as a potential catalyst for the tautomerization (, as exemplified
  with the reaction of yeast pyruvate decarboxylase, YPDC). As illustrated in the
  active site structure of YPDC in , the residue E51 probably carries out this function
  (). Chemical evidence for the importance of the 4’-aminopyrimidine moiety of ThDP
  in catalysis was obtained from ThDP analogues in which one or another nitrogen atom
  was replaced by carbon (), while a model for activation of the ring for catalysis
  via tautomerization by N1-protonation was suggested from our laboratories (-). Notwithstanding
  the attractive features of this hypothesis, until recently no direct spectroscopic
  or structural evidence was available on any ThDP enzymes for the presence of the
  1’,4’-imino tautomer. In rapid-scan stopped flow experiments, mixing slow active-center
  variants of YPDC with pyruvate, a UV absorption was noticed with λmax between 300−310
  nm, shown by circular dichroism (CD) experiments to correspond to a chiral enzyme-bound
  species (), and demonstrated with model studies to pertain to the 1,4-imino tautomer
  of 4-aminopyrimidine. Subsequently, the same CD band (and implied tautomer) was
  clearly observed when mixing methyl acetylphosphonate with either YPDC or the E1
  subunit of the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc-E1) (,) or
  on reacting methyl benzoylphosphonate with benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFD) ().
  In these examples, the keto group of the substrate analog phosphonate forms a covalent
  adduct with the thiazolium C2 atom of ThDP, an adduct that resembles the pre-decarboxylation
  intermediate C2α-lactylthiamin diphosphate (LThDP in ) which cannot be decarboxylated.
  The reaction in each case is signaled by the appearance of a positive circular dichroism
  (CD) signal in the range of 300−307 nm. Research with a number of YPDC and PDHc-E1
  variants prompted us to speculate that the ThDP cofactor exists as the 1’,4’-iminoThDP
  tautomer with each tetrahedral adduct on the pathway (). Earlier, we had reported
  preliminary electronic spectroscopic data on chemical models which supported assignment
  of the positive CD signal at 300−310 nm the 1,4-imino tautomer ().'
