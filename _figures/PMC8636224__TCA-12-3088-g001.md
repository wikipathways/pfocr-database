caption: 'Biogenesis and secretion of exosomes by donor cells and uptake of exosomal
  contents by recipient cells. Exosomes originate by membrane invagination of the
  multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to form intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). MVBs fuse either
  with lysosomes or with the cellular membrane, leading to degradation of the MVBs
  or secretion of the exosomes into the extracellular space. Exosomes merge with the
  recipient cell either by fusion of the exosomal membrane with the cellular membrane
  or via the endocytosis pathway, leading to the discharge of exosomal contents into
  the cytosol of the recipient cell. Components generally found in the exosome include
  miRNA, mRNA, DNA and proteins such as tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, and CD81) involved
  in exosomal biogenesis, RAB GTPases (RAB11, RAB27A/B and RAB35) involved in exosomal
  secretion, ALIX, ARF6 and TSG101 in the endosome‐related pathways, and proteins
  involved in the signal transduction and antigen presentation (such as TfR, c‐Met,
  EGFR, MHC I/II). Abbreviations: miRNA, microRNA; ARF, ADP‐ribosylation factor; TSG101,
  tumor susceptibility gene 101; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; EGFR, epidermal
  growth factor receptor; TfR, transferrin receptor'
