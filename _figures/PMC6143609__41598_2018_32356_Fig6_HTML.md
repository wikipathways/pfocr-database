caption: 'The proposed model that connects AHCY activity, DNA damage and the regulation
  of the cell cycle through adenosine levels in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Left:
  General schematic representation of proposed model: lowered AHCY activity causes
  adenosine depletion, stalling of replication forks and subsequent DNA damage, which
  activates various signalling pathways and causes cell cycle arrest in the G1/S checkpoint.
  Strong and sudden lowering of the AHCY activity causes immediate proliferation changes
  in cancer cells; however, mild inactivation of AHCY would cause chronic stress for
  liver cells and thus contribute to adult onset liver disease, such as hepatocellular
  carcinoma as observed in the latest case of AHCY deficiency. Right: A detailed overview
  of how adenosine depletion could cause replication fork stalling through misbalance
  of the dNTP pool due to lower dATP levels, and subsequent impairment of adequate
  rates of DNA synthesis and progression of the replication forks. Treatment with
  hydroxyurea, although following another pathway, facilitates a similar and well-described
  effect through the disturbance of the balance of the total dNTP pool.'
