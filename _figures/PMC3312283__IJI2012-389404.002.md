caption: 'This figure shows three novel intracellular signaling pathways involved
  in the pathogenesis of IBD. Pathway 1: TNF-α induces adhesion molecule expression
  in endothelial cells, as well as proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6) production
  by monocytes, through a sphingosine kinase (SK), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P),
  nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent pathway. Pathway 2: upon stimulation of
  cells with proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β), constitutive proteasome
  subunits are converted to the immunoproteasome subunits β1i (LMP2), β2i (LMP10,
  MECL-1), and β5i (LMP7) [–]. Functionally, immunoproteasome subunits play a role
  in NF-κB signaling. Pathway 3: dual activation of NF-κB and STAT3 pathways controls
  the expression of IL-17. As shown in this figure, crosstalk between these three
  pathways occurs, thereby promoting intestinal inflammation. Specific components
  of these pathways such as sphingosine kinase (SK), immunoproteasome subunits (LMP2,
  LMP7, and LMP10), and interactions between NF-κB/STAT3 represent possible pharmacological
  targets for IBD. In the figure: LMP is low molecular mass polypeptide (2, 5, or
  10); JAK2 is Janus Kinase 2; PI3K is phosphoinositide-3 kinase; AKT1 is Alpha serine/threonine-protein
  kinase.'
