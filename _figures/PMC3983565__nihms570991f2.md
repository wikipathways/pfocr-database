caption: Paradoxical activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in tumours treated with RAF
  inhibitors. a | In cells with mutant RAS, BRAF is typically sequestered in the cytosol
  and is kept inactive either through autophosphorylation or by phophorylating another
  protein that keeps it in an inactive state. One study has demonstrated that inhibiting
  BRAF in the presence of a mutated or growth-factor-activated RAS leads to relief
  of BRAF autoinhibition and, consequently, its recruitment to the plasma membrane
  where it dimerizes with and hyperactivates CRAF. b | Another suggested mechanism
  is focused around conformational changes in BRAF and CRAF caused by physical binding
  of the RAF inhibitor, promoting dimer formation between an uninhibited CRAF protomer
  and an inhibitor-bound BRAF or CRAF. At low concentrations, the drug binds only
  one RAF protomer and leads to transactivation of the other. At high concentrations,
  the drug binds and inhibits both RAF members of the dimer, blocking the signalling
  complex entirely.,
