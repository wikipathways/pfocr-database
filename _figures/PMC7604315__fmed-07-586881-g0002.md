caption: Neddylation and HCC. There are two biological processes taking place in pro-inflammation
  macrophages. One is related to the transcription factor HIF. HIF-1α can be targeted
  by pVHL, a substrate receptor of CRL2. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α prefers
  to be hydroxylated and then recognized by pVHL for degradation via the UPS pathway.
  Under hypoxic conditions, HIFα tends to translocate to the nucleus and form a heterodimer
  with a HIF1β subunit and transcriptionally regulates a wide spectrum of genes significant
  for the anti-inflammatory response. The other is about the apoptosis inhibition
  of pro-inflammation macrophages. SAG, a neddylation E3 ligase, collaborates with
  UPS to promote survival of infectious macrophages via ubiquitination of Bax and
  SARM. In contrast, SAG knockdown leads to the accumulation of proapoptotic Bax and
  SARM and breaks the balance between antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bax in the mitochondria,
  which induces the death of macrophages.
