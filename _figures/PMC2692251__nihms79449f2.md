caption: HuR and/or AUF1 differentially regulate mRNAs encoding cell cycle and Erk1/Erk2
  Mapk signaling-related genes in MCT-1–transformed cells. mRNAs from HuR and/or AUF1
  IP materials differentially expressed in transformed cells were visualized on KEGG
  cell cycle (A) and BioCarta (B) Erk1/Erk2 Mapk signaling pathway maps. Known pathway-related
  genes and their relations are shown. Genes showing altered association with HuR
  and/or AUF1 in transformed phenotype are colored (A) or framed (B) as indicated.
  Arrows indicate an increased or decreased association with HuR/AUF1 in malignant
  cells. All genes found to be altered in each pathway are listed in Supplementary
  Tables S2 and S3.
