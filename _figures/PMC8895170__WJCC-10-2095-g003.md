caption: 'Schematic diagram of betatrophin and angiogenin-likeprotein3 participating
  in lipid regulation. Betatrophin synthesized by the liver under the stimulation
  of feeding or insulin can promote the cleavage of angiogenin-likeprotein3 (ANGPTL3)
  to release the active N-terminal catalytic core domain (CCD) domain, which leads
  to a decrease in the inhibitory effect of ANGPTL3 on Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity
  and indirectly promotes LPL to participate in lipid metabolism. When triglyceride-
  derived fatty acids enter the adipocytes, some of them form lipid droplets, while
  the other part induces the increase of LPL synthesis in adipocytes, and enters the
  blood circulation to participate in lipid metabolism mediated by glycosylphosphatidylinositol
  high density lipoprotein binding protein 1. GPIHBP1: Glycosylphosphatidylinositol
  high density lipoprotein binding protein 1; HSPG: Heparan sulfate proteoglycan;
  CM: Chylomicrons; TG: Triglycerides.'
