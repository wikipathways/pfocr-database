caption: Comparison of the initiation steps in biotin synthesis and fatty acid synthesis.
  FabH, the 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase that catalyzes the initiation step of fatty
  acid synthesis, is believed to also catalyze the initiation step of biotin synthesis
  based on the sensitivity of in vitro DTB synthesis to thiolactomycin and the requirement
  of FabH for a CoA primer.
