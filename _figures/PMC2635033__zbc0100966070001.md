caption: Schematic diagram of de novo and salvage purine nucleotide  synthesis with
  points of regulation by Akt. Glucose (Glu) can be  converted to ribose 5-phosphate
  (Rib-5-P) via either the oxidative or  non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  Under normal  conditions, most ribose 5-phosphate used in purine synthesis comes
  from the  non-oxidative pathway. Ribose 5-phosphate is converted by PRPP synthetase
  to  PRPP (reaction 1), which is converted to phosphoribosylamine  (PRA) by PRPP
  amidotransferase, the first committed step of the  de novo pathway (reaction 2).
  Glycine combines with  phosphoribosylamine to produce glycinamide ribonucleotide
  (GAR),  which is combined with formate to produce FGAR (reaction 3); the  latter
  is converted to AICAR in five subsequent steps (shown as a dashed  arrow with the
  first step, reaction 4, inhibited by azaserine).  AICAR and formate are converted
  by the bifunctional enzyme ATIC (reaction  5) to IMP, which can then be converted
  to either AMP or GMP. The major  routes of AMP and GMP catabolism differ. AMP is
  converted to hypoxanthine  (Hx) via adenosine (Ado) and inosine (Ino), and GMP  is
  converted to guanine (Gua); in both cases ribose 1-phosphate  (Rib-1-P) is generated.
  The ribose 1-phosphate can undergo  isomerization to ribose 5-phosphate and then
  be converted to PRPP, and  hypoxanthine and guanine can be converted to IMP by hypoxanthine  phosphoribosyltransferase
  (reaction 6). PRPP production from glucose  is shown in green, the de novo purine
  pathway is shown in  pink, purine nucleotide catabolism and the purine salvage pathway
  are  shown in yellow, and points of regulation by PI3K/Akt are shown in  red. Glu-6-P,
  glucose 6-phosphate; 10f-THF,  10-formyltetrahydrofolate.
