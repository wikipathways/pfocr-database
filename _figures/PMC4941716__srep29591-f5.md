caption: Given the expression changes of cgi-miR-2d and CgIκB2, it was suggested that
  CgIκB2 could be modulated post-transcriptionally by up-regulated cgi-miR-2d at the
  early stage of V. splendidus infection and led to the inhibition of NF-κB pathway
  activation as well as the promotion of haemocyte phagocytosis. At the late stage
  of V. splendidus challenge, expression of cgi-miR-2d was repressed while that of
  CgIκB2 was up-regulated to disadvantage both NF-κB pathway and haemocyte phagocytosis.
  Moreover, apoptosis could also be regulated by cgi-miR-2d, which was conserved among
  miR-2 family yet not dominant during V. splendidus challenge, indicating the existence
  of other unknown modulatory pathways.
