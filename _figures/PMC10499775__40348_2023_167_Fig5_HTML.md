caption: Illustration of the PI3Kδ pathway. PI3Kδ is activated through a variety of
  receptors (shown here is activation via IL-2 and its associated receptor). PI3Kδ
  typically consists of a catalytic subunit (p110δ) and a regulatory subunit (p85α)
  and leads to the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) by
  phosphorylating its precursor phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), both
  located in the cell membrane. Downstream PIP3 signaling is mediated by intracellular
  enzymes, such as the serine/threonine kinase AKT, which phosphorylates the FOXO
  transcription factors inactivating them, as well as regulators of the mTOR complex
  1 (mTORC1), which is in turn activated. Increased activity of the PI3Kδ pathway
  leads to APDS. Patients with APDS are responsive to mTOR inhibition. More targeted
  approaches include selective PI3Kδ inhibitors, such as leniolisib or idealisib
