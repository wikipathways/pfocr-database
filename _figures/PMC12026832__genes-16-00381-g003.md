caption: Signaling pathways in cardiac fibroblast. (A) Activated PDGFR stimulates
  the Ras pathway, which leads to the activation of RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine
  protein kinase (Raf-1). Raf-1 activates downstream effectors, including dual-specificity
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated protein
  kinase (ERK1/2) which promote the phosphorylation of several transcription factors
  to induce cell proliferation, cell survival, and ECM-related gene expression. (B)
  TGF-β signaling pathway. TGF-β homodimers phosphorylate and form a heterotetrameric
  complex with two type I receptors. The signaling domain of the type I receptor mediates
  phosphorylation and the activation of Smad proteins. The activated Smad complex
  forms a transcriptional module with several transcription factors, and co-factors
  to promote the transcription of ECM-related target genes. TGF-β activated the AKT
  pathway via a RhoA-dependent manner to induce the transcription of target genes.
  (C) Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt ligands bind to a frizzled receptor and co-receptor
  LRP. In the absence of a Wnt signal, cytoplasmic b-catenin phosphorylated by a multiprotein
  complex consisting of Axin, APC protein, and several kinases, is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation. Upon Wnt binding, the destruction complex is dissembled, allowing β-catenin
  to translocate into the nucleus, where it binds with transcription factors (TCF/LEF)
  to regulate downstream gene expression. (D) Hippo signaling pathway. Various physiological
  or pathological signals induce the Hippo signaling pathway in fibroblasts. Upon
  activation, Hippo kinase complexes MST1/2, MOB1 SAV, and LATS1/2 induce phosphorylation
  of YAP and TAZ. Phosphorylated YAP and TAZ are sequestered in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3
  proteins or targeted for degradation. The inactivation of the Hippo kinase complex
  results in the nuclear translocation of YAP and TAZ. In the nucleus, YAP and TAZ
  bind with TEAD factors to regulate gene expression
