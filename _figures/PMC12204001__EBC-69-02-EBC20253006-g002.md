caption: Aberrant cytoplasmic DNA activates the cGAS-STING pathway in DCs to induce
  the production of interferon (IFN) and increase the expression of major histocompatibility
  complex I (MHC I) and CD86 molecules on the DC surface. Activated DCs promote cross-presentation
  of tumor antigen to T cells, which further activates T cells and exerts anti-tumor
  effects. Mass production of IFNs also up-regulates immunosuppressive factors such
  as PD-L1 on the tumor surface, so combination therapy with synergistic ICB therapy
  is required. Activation of STING promotes macrophage maturation and migration to
  the tumor site, exhibiting potent phagocytic activity and increasing levels of CXCL10,
  CXCL11, and TNF-α. The cGAS-STING signaling pathway also up-regulates the expression
  of the natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligand on tumor cells, which binds
  to NKG2D receptors on NK cells, thus enhancing NK cell-mediated tumor cell killing.
  And there are three main ways to effectively activate cGAS-STING pathway. Direct
  activation using STING agonists such as CDNs, or introduction of exogenous DNA into
  the tumor. The cGAS or STING activity can be regulated by PTMs. The second strategy
  is to modulate the TME, such as targeting tumor metabolism or suppressive pathways
  with specific inhibitors. It can also activate cGAS-STING by increasing the activity
  of immune cells, such as STING agonists in combination with ICBs. Created with Figdraw.
