caption: Overview of immune regulation pathways induced by IDO enzyme in humans. At
  the transcriptional level, IDO enzyme is expressed by various cells of the immune
  system and activated by cytokines and other immunomodulatory molecules such as TNF-α,
  IL-6, and IFN-γ. On the one hand, IDO activity results in decreasing available Trp
  level, which activates the GCN2 kinase pathway and inhibits the mTOR pathway, leading
  to the reduced number of antigen-specific T cells. On the other hand, increasing
  Kyn level and KP metabolite concentrations induced by IDO activate AHR pathway,
  leading to the increased number of regulatory T cell. The results of these signal
  pathways contribute to the apoptosis of effector T cells and proliferation regulatory
  T cells. IFNs, interferons; ILs, interleukins; TNFs, tumor necrosis factors; IDO,
