caption: Model for HCN4 function in establishing laterality. The developmental timeline
  along the left illustrates early cleavage stages to post-gastrulation asymmetric
  gene expression of the Nodal-Lefty-Pitx2 cascade leading to final organ situs. Previously
  established important laterality events are outlined adjacent to the developmental
  time line and portray very early laterality events of cytoskeletal rearrangement
  and physiological amplification, as well as later events such as gastrulation-stage
  ciliary flows, all funnel into the canonical Nodal-Lefty-Pitx2 gene regulatory network
  to bring about invariant asymmetric organ situs. HCN4 action is required during
  early cleavage stages and can largely bypass the Nodal-Lefty asymmetric gene expression
  cascade to affect organ situs. HCN4-mediated Nodal-Lefty asymmetric gene expression-independent
  effect could be due to directly acting on downstream factors of the Nodal-Lefty
  pathway or through a non-canonical pathway. Players in this HCN4-mediated laterality
  patterning remain to be discovered.

  manner.
