caption: A scheme to explain how CP-AMPARs may trigger LTP2. (A) Baseline conditions.
  The synaptic complement comprises NMDARs (predominantly GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B) and
  calcium impermeable (CI)-AMPARs (note only one of each receptor type is shown for
  simplicity). (B,C) The first TBS (or cTBS, cHFS, etc.) induces LTP1 via activation
  of CaMKII and involves the synaptic insertion of additional CI-AMPARs. (D) The first
  TBS also drives CP-AMPARs into the perisynaptic plasma membrane, via a pathway involving
  protein kinase A (PKA). (E) Additional TBS activates NMDARs to drive CP-AMPARs from
  the perisynaptic to the synaptic membrane. (F) Baseline stimulation leads to Ca2+
  entry via CP-AMPARs, which triggers de novo protein synthesis (via PI3K and MAPK).
  (G) Consequently, what follows is spine growth and the incorporation of additional
  CI-AMPARs. CP-AMPARs are removed from the synapse around the same time.
