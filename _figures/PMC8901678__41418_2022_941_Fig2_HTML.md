caption: After intake of iron, Fe3+ is reduced by dcytb and then transported into
  enterocyte through DMT1. Dietary heme is absorpbed by unknown mechanism and degraded
  in enterocyte by HO-1. Once exported by FPN, Fe3+ binds to transferrin (diferric
  transferrin, TF-Fe2), travels to tissues, and largely utilized in new red blood
  cells. Macrophage degraded senescent RBCs to recycle iron. Once needed, EPO, released
  by kidney, promotes erythropoiesis by HIF signaling pathway. The iron utilization
  of erythroid marrow and its recycling by macrophages represent the major iron circulation.
  Excess iron can be stored in hepatocytes through TFR1-mediated TF-Fe2 or SLC39A14-participated
  non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI). The release of iron from enterocyte, red blood
  cells, and macrophages is precisely controlled by FPN, the body’s sole iron exporter,
  to maintain a relatively stable iron level. The peptide hepcidin, the master regulator
  of systemic iron homeostasis, is a circulating hormone synthesized by the liver.
  Recently, we identified RNF217 as a novel E3 ligase for mediating FPN degradation.
