caption: TNFα, a key proinflammatory cytokine in the induction of muscle wasting,
  binds to its receptor, activating a signaling pathway that culminates in the activation
  of NF-κB. NF-κB then enhances the transcription of the iNOS transcript, which is
  subsequently bound by HuR at an ARE in the 3'-UTR and stabilized. This results in
  a dramatic increase in iNOS mRNA levels, resulting in enhanced translation of the
  iNOS protein. iNOS converts L-arginine into citrulline, releasing NO in the process.
  Several NO-dependent pathways may be responsible for the induction of muscle wasting.
  First, NO diffuses out of the cell where it combines with superoxide (O2-) to form
  peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Peroxynitrite then diffuses back into the cell, selectively
  inhibiting MyoD, an important myogenic transcription factor, at the post-transcriptional
  level. Loss of MyoD leads to a reduction in MyHC expression, compromising the integrity
  of the myofibrillar protein complex. Second, NO-production leads to the oxidative
  modification of Jun-D, which, together with myogenin, regulates several key skeletal
  muscle-specific proteins, like CKM. Finally, NO-production may inhibit protein synthesis
  by inhibiting mTOR signaling and by increasing eIF2α and eEF2 phosphorylation, though
  the mechanism by which this occurs is uncertain. It is also unclear whether NO causes
  these last two effects directly, or through the formation of peroxynitrite.
