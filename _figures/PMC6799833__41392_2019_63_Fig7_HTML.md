caption: 'The potential mechanisms of fluoxetine in the remission of AD. As a selective
  5-HT reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine can increase the extraneuronal concentration
  of 5-HT. 5-HT binds to the 5-HT4A receptor to promote neuronal dematuration through
  a Gs-mediated pathway. 5-HT binds to the 5-HT1A receptor, which is involved in BDNF-dependent
  neurogenesis through the Gi-mediated signaling pathway. After 5-HT stimulation,
  MeCP2 is phosphorylated at Ser421 through CaMKII-dependent signaling, and this promotes
  the dissociation of CREB from HDAC and then increases the expression of BDNF. BDNF
  activates downstream signaling pathways, including the MEK-ERK pathway, which might
  promote the activity of α-secretase, inhibit γ-secretase, and reduce the production
  of toxic amyloid Aβ. Moreover, the serotonylation of histone H3 at glutamine 5 (Q5)
  enhances the binding of H3K4me3 and TFIID and allows gene expression. Fluoxetine
  has been reported to bind and inhibit NMDA receptors directly, which can reduce
  the inhibition of α-secretase and thus prevent the production of Aβ. In addition,
  fluoxetine can bind to the endoplasmic reticulum protein sigma-1 receptor, which
  induces the dissociation of Bip from the sigma-1 receptor and promotes neuroprotection.
