caption: 'The HER2 signaling pathway and mechanisms of HER2 signaling inhibition.
  The left-most receptor signaling pathway depicts the mechanism and binding of trastuzumab
  monoclonal antibody. The receptor pathway second to the left depicts the mechanism
  and binding of the pertuzumab monoclonal antibody. The receptor pathway second to
  the right depicts the mechanism of TKIs. Finally, the right-most receptor pathway
  depicts a normal uninhibited HER2 signaling pathway upon ligand binding. HER2: human
  epidermal growth factor receptor 2; HER3: human epidermal growth factor receptor
  3; TKIs: tyrosine kinase inhibitors; PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt: protein
  kinase B.'
