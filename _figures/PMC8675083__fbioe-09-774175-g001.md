caption: A profile of the GOIs’ sites in the glucose metabolism pathway of CHO cells.
  To better demonstrate the relationship between the target genes of metabolic engineering
  and the glucose metabolism pathway in CHO cells, an illustration is presented. The
  GOIs which are overexpressed have been marked with “+,” and the others which are
  down-expressed via siRNA have been marked with “−.” All the GOIs are indicated using
  background of colorful circles, and the metabolic pathways are marked as an axis
  below the figure.
