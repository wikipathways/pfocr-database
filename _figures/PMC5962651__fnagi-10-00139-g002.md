caption: The schematic presentation of autophagy pathway and core autophagy-related
  proteins targeted by various miRNAs. The figure shows some significant miRNAs (dark
  green color) and their respective targets (light green and yellow color) for the
  regulation of autophagic mechanisms in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The
  figure shows that insufficient research has been conducted in neurodegenerative
  diseases for the regulation of autophagy via miRNAs and further molecular research
  is encouraged in all major neurodegenerative diseases including prion diseases.
