caption: Brain locus coeruleus (LC) and superior salivatory nucleus (SSN) represent
  the central noradrenergic and cholinergic neural nucleus projecting to lacrimal
  gland via the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and pterygopalatine ganglion (PG).
  They release the noradrenaline (NA) and acetylcholine (ACh) that binds to the Adra1a
  and M3AChR receptors in the acinar and myoepithelial cells of lacrimal gland. The
  balanced orchestration of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous
  system (PSNS) precisely controls tear production and secretion from lacrimal gland.
  Dry eye stress causes SNS activation of lacrimal gland, which reduces tear production
  and secretion through the NA-Adra1a-UCPs signaling pathway. Corneal irritation and
  carbachol injection causes PSNS activation, which evokes reflex tear hypersecretion
  and can be reversed by SNS activation. Created in BioRender. Wang, Q. (2025) https://BioRender.com/229xwx3
