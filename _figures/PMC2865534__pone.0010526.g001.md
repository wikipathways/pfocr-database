caption: '(a) Maturation pathway for the [NiFe] catalytic site of P. furiosus SHI
  is based on that proposed for E. coli hydrogenase 3 . HypE and HypF generate thiocyanate
  in an ATP-dependent process from carbamoyl phosphate (CP). The source of the CO
  ligand is unknown. The HypCD complex binds the iron atom containing the CN and CO
  ligands and donates it to the catalytic subunit (PF0894). The Ni atom is provided
  by the HypAB-SlyD complex in a GTP-dependent reaction. The Ni and Fe atoms in the
  [NiFe] site are coordinated to PF0894 by the S atoms of four of its Cys residues
  (indicated by S). Activation of PF0894 requires cleavage of four C-terminal residues
  (-VVRL) catalyzed by a newly identified peptidase, FrxA (and to a much lesser extent
  by HycI). It is not known how the biosynthesis of PF0894 is coordinated with that
  of the other three subunits (PF0891, PF0892 and PF0893) to give catalytically-active
  SHI. The predicted cofactor content of mature heterotetrameric SHI  is shown together
  with their roles in the reversible production of hydrogen gas from NADPH. The abbreviations
  used are: CP, carbamoyl phosphate; CO, carbonyl ligand; CN, cyano ligand; FAD, flavin
  adenine dinucleotide. (b) The expression plasmids utilized for production of SHI
  in E. coli strain MW4W. The antibiotics refer to the selective marker on each plasmid:
  Amp, Ampicillin; Sm, Streptomycin; Kan, Kanamycin; Cam, Chloramphenicol.'
