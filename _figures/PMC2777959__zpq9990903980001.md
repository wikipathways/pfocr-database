caption: 'Comparison of mixed acid pathway for glucose fermentation in native E. coli
  and energy-conserving succinate production pathway in recombinant E. coli. (A) Mixed
  acid pathway: Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is the primary source of energy for glucose
  uptake and phosphorylation. Succinate production is primarily determined by partitioning
  of carbon at the PEP node. In native E. coli, half of the pyruvate produced from
  PEP is used for this glucose uptake. The four solid stars indicate metabolic steps
  that have been blocked by constructed deletions. Dotted arrows indicate steps that
  are either nonfunctional or expected to have reduced carbon flow as a result of
  these deletions. Pyruvate (oval) is shown twice but represents a single metabolic
  pool. (B) Energy-conserving succinate production pathway: An acquired mutation in
  ptsI inactivating the PEP-dependent glucose uptake systems was functionally replaced
  by increased expression of the galP permease and glucokinase (glk). Additional mutations
  increased the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pck) sufficiently
  to make this enzyme the dominant route for carboxylation, increasing net production
  of ATP and increasing the pool of PEP available for succinate production. Bold solid
  arrows indicate the primary route for succinate production in KJ060 and related
  strains. Some intermediate steps in glycolysis have been omitted for clarity. G6P,
  glucose 6-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.'
