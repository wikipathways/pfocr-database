caption: EGFR activation by EGF results in c-Src activation, which is required for
  TRPM7 activity (phosphorylation and expression) contributing to Mg2+ homeostasis
  and interaction of EGFR and TRPM7 in the cell membrane. This signaling pathway is
  required for activation of ERK1/2. Cross-talk between EGF–EGFR and TRPM7 in VSMCs
  regulates cell migration and proliferation and may play an important role in vascular
  homeostasis.
