caption: IL-6 classical and trans-signaling pathways. a IL-6 binds to cells that express
  both the membrane bound IL-6R gp130 and trigger the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway. This type of signaling is called classical signaling. b In cells that express
  only gp130 but not IL-6R, IL-6 binds to soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) and the complex in
  turn bind to gp130 to trigger the activation of intracellular signaling. This type
  of signaling is called trans-signaling. The sIL-6R is released by proteolytic cleavage
  of the IL-6R membrane bound precursor by the metalloproteases ADAM10 and 17. A natural
  form of gp130 is able to bind to the sIL-6R bound to IL-6 with comparable affinity
  and mediates inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling
