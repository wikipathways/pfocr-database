caption: 'A schematic representation of cPAcP interaction with HER-2 and PI3K/Akt
  pathway in regulating prostate cell homeostasis. cPAcP loss of expression induces
  carcinogenesis and subsequently prostate cancer (PCa) cell proliferation and progression.
  Initiation of PCa is accompanied by an early decrease of cPAcP expression in prostate
  cells resulting in hyperphosphorylation of HER-2 on tyrosine residues including
  Y1221/2 and Y1248. In addition to the activation of HER-2/MAPK pathway, loss of
  cPAcP activity can lead to the accumulation of PIP3 and subsequent Akt activation,
  which results in PCa progression and survival. Akt activation can phosphorylate
  S6K and GSK3 and leads to prostate cell proliferation. Activated Akt may phosphorylate
  and sequester FKHR and BAD in cytoplasm which results in survival of PCa cells.
  In addition, Akt may also phosphorylate AR and ERK which results in inducing PCa
  cell proliferation. Abbreviations: Akt, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog;
  AR, androgen receptor; BAD, Bcl-2-associated death promoter protein; cPAcP, cellular
  prostatic acid phosphatase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases; FKHR, forkhead
  in rhabdomyosarcoma (also designated FOXO1); GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; HER-2,
  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (also designated ErbB-2/neu); PDK-1, phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate; S6K, ribosomal S6 kinase (a family member of serine/threonine
  kinases).'
