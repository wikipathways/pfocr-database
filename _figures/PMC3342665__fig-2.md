caption: Enzymatic synthesis of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Desulfhydration of cysteine
  is the major source of H2S in mammals and is catalyzed by the trans-sulfuration
  pathway enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE),
  and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). Cystathionine can be converted
  by CSE to form H2S. CBS can form cystathionine from serine and homocysteine, and
  additionally can form H2S from cysteine. Cysteine, along with alpha-ketoglutarate
  (alpha-KG), is converted into 3-mercaptopyruvate (3MP) by cystine aminotransferase
  (CAT). 3MP can then be broken down by 3MST to form H2S.
