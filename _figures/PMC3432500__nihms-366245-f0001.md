caption: Proposed model for mitohormesis in response to reduced insulin/IGF1-signaling.A.
  In C. elegans and mice (MEFs), impaired insulin/IGF1-signaling reduces glucose uptake,
  ultimately increasing the cellular AMP/ATP ratio. This energy-stress signal activates
  AMP kinase, which engages a transcriptional “metabolic shift program” that includes
  induction of mitochondrial proline oxidase. This shift in metabolism generates mitochondrial
  ROS that initiate an adaptive ROSsignaling pathway. B. The adaptive mitochondrial
  ROS signal, through PMK-1 (p38) and SKN-1 (NRF2), activates a protective transcriptional
  “stress response program.” This involves increased expression of SOD and catalase
  (CAT), which detoxify ROS and improve cellular stress resistance to ultimately help
  to extend C. elegans lifespan.
