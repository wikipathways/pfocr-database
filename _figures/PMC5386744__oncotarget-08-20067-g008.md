caption: Biphasic activation of A-SMase in CD95-receptosomes is caused by two different
  mechanisms. CD95 ligation leads to the activation of caspase-8 which triggers a
  translocation of A-SMase onto the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. At the plasmamembrane
  A-SMase colocalizes with CD95 and is supposedly involved in the formation of lipid
  rafts propagating the formation of CD95 clusters []. In type I cells, these receptor
  ligand complexes undergo clathrin-dependent internalization forming CD95-receptosomes.
  Along the endocytotic pathway CD95-receptosomes fuse with trans-Golgi vesicles (TGV)
  which contain A-SMase to form multivesicular bodies (MVB) which eventually mature
  to early lysosomes. Within this compartment, caspase-7 or caspase-3 activates A-SMase
  to transmit further downstream signaling.
