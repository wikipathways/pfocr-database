caption: (a1) System design of the ULFMEF developed for wireless charging of implantable
  electronic devices. The ULFMEF system consists of an IMER and an EMET. (a2) Schematic
  showing the typical working frequency of ULFMEF, compared to other wireless energy
  transfer methods such as electromagnetic radiation, electromagnetic resonance, electromagnetic
  induction, magnetoelectric material, ultrasound and near-infrared light effects.
  (b) Illustration of the working mechanism of the ULFMEF system applied for wireless
  electrical stimulation and light-induced optogenetic stimulation in deep tissues.
  (c) Structure diagram and physical photograph of the EMET, which utilized a motor
  to control the rotation of a magnet to generate a low-frequency magnetic field.
  (d) Schematic diagram and photograph of the IMER combined with a rectifier circuit.
  (e) Schematic diagram showing the external/internal magnetism synergistic electricity-generating
  process in a typical cycle and during multiple cycles. The electricity is generated
  in the IMER through two pathways, including EMET-induced Ee via an external pathway
  and MIFC-induced Ei via an internal pathway, respectively.
