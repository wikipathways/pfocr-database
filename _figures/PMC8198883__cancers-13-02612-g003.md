caption: 'Schematic representation of the signaling potential of orexin receptors,
  as demonstrated by experiments on recombinant cell lines. Continuous arrows indicate
  demonstrated or hypothesized causal links between messengers and/or enzymes. The
  broken arrow indicates an undetermined causal pathway. GPCR: G-protein coupled receptors.
  AC: adenylate cyclase. PLC, PLA2, PLD: phospholipase C, A2, and D, respectively.
  NSCCs: non-selective cation channels. 2-AC: 2-acyl-glycerol. CB1R: cannabinoid type
  1 receptor. See the text of the paper for the other abbreviations.'
