caption: Model for B. pertussis CyaA regulated complex signaling pathways to block
  the monocyte differentiation and to trigger macrophage dedifferentiation. CyaA toxin
  recognizes CD11b molecule on phagocytes to translocate its adenylate cyclase (AC)
  domain across the cell membrane. Upon interaction with the host cell protein calmodulin,
  AC enzyme gets activated and catalyzes the conversion of cellular ATP to cAMP. cAMP
  signal transduction via PKA then inactivates RhoA and/OR activates LATS1/2 to inhibit
  Yap regulated gene expression and prevents monocytes from acquiring bigger cell
  size, a typical macrophage feature; this signaling pathway could also block the
  macrophages from retaining large cell size and triggers their dedifferentiation.
  The decrease in Yap activity is paralleled by the inactivation of AKT/PKB to suppress
  the cell growth signaling in order to reduce cell size. Elevated cAMP level subverts
  IL-2 receptor signaling which upregulates the M-CSF receptor expression and that
  makes the monocyte less sensitive to pro-differentiating M-CSF growth factor. These
  complex CyaA-mediated signaling events culminate in subverting macrophage-based
  host protective functions to compromise the anti-Bordetella host immune responses.
