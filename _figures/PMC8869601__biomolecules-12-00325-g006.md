caption: 'Pathway model of a potential citrate shunt in PKAN erythrocytes. In erythrocytes,
  citrate imported from the plasma is the only source for the acetyl moiety in acetyl-CoA,
  which is the primary building block for fatty acid synthesis and essential for post-translational
  modifications. Its formation is mediated by ACLY under consumption of ATP and citrate.
  Depletion of CoA largely impairs this reaction in PKAN erythrocytes. An alternative
  citrate pathway via ACO1 and IDH1 is preferably active in PKAN erythrocytes since
  metabolites of this route were found to be altered accordingly. Metabolites with
  normal abundances are in black, pathways are in italic green font. Altered metabolites
  are shown in red, normal font indicates decreased and bold fonts increased levels.
  Pathways that are strongly affected in PKAN erythrocytes are indicated with dotted
  lines and arrow heads in red. The red cross indicates absent/inactive PANK2 protein
  due to the genetic condition. Black arcs indicate potential inhibition of G6PD by
  elevated NADPH/NADP+ ratios and of PFK by increased citrate and ATP levels. The
  following enzyme acronyms are used: aconitate hydratase (ACO1), isocitrate dehydrogenase
  (IDH1), aspartate-aminotransferase (GOT1), ATP-citrate synthase (ACLY), α-hydroxyglutarate
  dehydrogenase (L2HGDH), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2).'
