caption: 'Schematic of fatty acid β-oxidation, oxidative stress response and cholesterol
  absorption processes in the enterocytes of mouse. The main cholesterol importer
  NPC1L1 and the cholesterol exporters ABCG5/G8 are located at the apical membrane
  of enterocytes and facilitate the uptake of cholesterol across the brush border
  membrane. ACAT2 esterifies the absorbed cholesterol, and MTTP transfers triglycerides
  and cholesteryl esters to ApoB48 in the smooth ER. The nascent chylomicrons leave
  the ER, are secreted through the Golgi complex to the basolateral side of the enterocyte
  and reach the venous circulation through lymphatic vessels. In addition to the chylomicron
  pathway, a significant portion of intestinal xanthophylls are absorbed through an
  ABCA1/ApoA1 pathway and may be preferentially delivered to some tissues. The absorption
  of dietary cholesterol through the apical membrane into enterocytes is associated
  with β-oxidation and/or oxidative stress response. NPC1L1: Niemann-Pick C1 like-1;
  ABCG5/G8: ATP-binding cassette transporter G5/G8; CD36: cluster of differentiation
