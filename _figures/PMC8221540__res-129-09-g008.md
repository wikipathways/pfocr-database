caption: Proposed immunometabolic regulation of resting and inflamed endothelial cell
  (EC) phenotypes. In resting ECs, the 3 central glucose metabolism pathways of glycolysis,
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) are active. PFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase
  3) maintains glycolysis by generating F2,6BP as a potent agonist of the rate-limiting
  enzyme PFK1 (phosphofructokinase 1). G6PD (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) is
  the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP. PDKs govern the flux of glucose-derived
  pyruvate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and OXPHOS via phosphorylation and inactivation
  of PDH complex. Upon inflammatory stimulation, all 3 glucose metabolism pathways
  are extensively enhanced in ECs. In turn, enhanced PPP and mitochondrial OXPHOS
  via upregulation of G6PD or inhibition of the FOXO1 (forkhead box O1)-PDK4 (pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinase 4) axis, respectively, suppress inflammation, while heightened
  glycolysis via activation of the NF-κB (nuclear factor-kappa B)–PFKFB3 pathway promotes
  inflammation.
