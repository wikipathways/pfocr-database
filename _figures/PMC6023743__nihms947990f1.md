caption: A well-studied example of modulation of phospholipid signal transduction
  cascade in the nucleus is turnover of inositol phospholipids, especially phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2). Extracellular stimulation of hepatocytes and other cell types by insulin
  growth factor (IGF) results in enhanced nuclear diacylglycerol (DAG) production
  via hydrolysis of nuclear PIP2 by phospholipase C (PLC) β () and modulation of nuclear
  processes such as proliferation and gene expression (). Interestingly, generation
  of nuclear DAG also promotes PKC translocation to the nucleus () and initiates DNA
  synthesis () (). In the nucleus, DAG is also generated by a second pathway involving
  hydrolysis of PC or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by nuclear phospholipase D (PLD)
  to form phosphatidic acid (PA) that is subsequently converted to DAG by a nuclear
  lipid phosphate phosphatase (LPP) (). Nuclear DAG has a short half-life as it is
  rapidly converted to PA by nuclear DAG kinase θ ;) that is stimulated by a variety
  of agonists (). Further, PA produced in the nucleus can function as a second messenger.
  PA interacts with a variety of cellular and cytoskeletal proteins and these interactions
  may modulate enzyme activities, spatio-temporal localization of the protein, and
  cellular functions such as migration, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal organization,
  secretion, and proliferation (; ). PA in the nucleus can also generate another bioactive
  signaling lipid mediator, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), by the action of PA specific
  phospholipase A1/A2 (; ; ). LPA mediates cellular functions by signaling extracellularly
  via G-protein coupled LPA1–6 receptors and intracellularly by binding to target
  proteins such as PPARγ (; ). No definitive measurements of LPA levels in nuclear
  preparations have been reported; however, LPA1 is known to be constitutively expressed
  in the nucleus of porcine cerebral microvascular endothelial, rat hepatoma HTC4,
  () and human bronchial epithelial and neuronal PC12 cells (). Further, in human
  bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and PC12 cells, trafficking of LPA1 to the nucleus
  was influenced by cell-matrix interactions via integrin signaling, and nuclear LPA1
  may be involved in regulating intra-nuclear protein phosphorylation (). PLC-β mediated
  hydrolysis of PIP2 in the nucleus, in addition to DAG, also generates the second
  messenger, inositol IP3 that binds to its cognate receptor present on the inner
  nuclear membrane to release calcium that is essential for transcriptional regulation
  of calcium dependent enzymes such as calmodulin kinase (). In the nucleus, IP3 is
  phosphorylated by inositol kinases localized in the nucleus (; ; ) resulting in
  the generation of inositol polyphosphates that regulate chromatin remodeling, histone
  modifications, transcription and mRNA export (; ). In addition to PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-5
  phosphate (PI5P) was shown to be necessary for the binding of Ubiquitin-like with
  PHD and RING finger domain 1 (UHRF1) to tri-methylated residues of histone3 (H3K9me3)
  (). UHRF1 is involved in DNA replication and repair and also associated with targeting
  HDACs to actively transcribed chromatin via interaction with PI5P. Nuclear PIP2
  also mediates interaction between BASP-1 and WILMS’TUMOR 1 protein in association
  with HDAC1 () further implicating a role for polyphosphoinositides and other phospholipid-derived
  mediators in gene regulation and chromatin structure. Thus, there is compelling
  evidence that mammalian cells have the ability to synthesize and metabolize phospholipids
  and generate lipid mediators within the nucleus that signal both intra- and extra-nuclear
  for cellular processes ().
