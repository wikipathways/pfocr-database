caption: Figure 2. This is a schematic to show the possible relationships between
  TG-2 and adhesion proteins. (A) If a more direct association between TG-2 and a
  particular protein, for example, paxillin, can be demonstrated (orange solid line);
  but lack of association between TG-2 and other adhesion proteins (purple solid line),
  one can postulate that the signaling pathway is more likely to be TG2-paxillin.
  Although one cannot exclude simultaneous signaling between TG-2 and vinculin, etc.,
  these effects may be more likely indirect via other intermediates. Conversely, it
  may also be possible to have a scenario where the TG-2 influences FAK (B), or vinculin
  (C) more directly than paxillin, suggesting alternative primary axes of signaling.
