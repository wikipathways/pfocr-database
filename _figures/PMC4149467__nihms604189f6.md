caption: Model for GATA regulation of Notch signaling in the intestine. During the
  process of epithelial cytodifferentiation within the intestine, a subset of progenitor
  cells stochastically loses Notch receptor expression and upregulates Dll1 expression
  thereby defining these cells as the secretory progenitors(). We propose that within
  the secretory progenitor population, GATA factors function to increase Dll1 expression
  thereby contributing to the overall high level of Dll1 characteristic of these cells.
  Interaction between DLL1 on secretory progenitors and Notch receptors on adjacent
  progenitors drives Notch signaling within neighboring cells, and such Notch-receiving
  progenitor cells generate enterocytes rather than secretory cells. Although GATA
  factors are present within the progenitor population as a whole, within Notch-receiving
  absorptive progenitors, activation of the Notch pathway results in repression of
  Dll1 expression (). Absorptive progenitors continue to express GATA factors and
  differentiate into mature enterocytes expressing markers including Lct and Fabp1.
  As secretory progenitors differentiate into mature goblet cells, expressing markers
  including Atoh1 and Muc2, GATA expression is lost. In the case of intestine from
  G4G6 dcKO embryos, we propose that loss of GATA factors dampens overall DLL1 levels
  in secretory progenitors. Therefore, there is less Notch ligand available to neighboring
  cells, and the balance between the absorptive and secretory cell lineages is altered
  to favor secretory cell fate. Moreover, loss of GATA factors in remaining absorptive
  progenitors results in abnormal enterocyte differentiation.
