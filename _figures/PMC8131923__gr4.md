caption: BMPs through BMPR2 signaling stimulate catabolic metabolism of lipid. BMPR2
  activates phosphorylation of perilipin through p38/MAPK pathway to promote lipolysis.
  The resulting free fatty acids are transported into mitochondria and generate H+via
  fatty acid oxidation (FAO). H+ is transported by electron transport chain (ETC)
  and creates ATP or heat. A part of fatty acids is integrated into triacylglycerol
  (TAG) by reesterification and therefore form a futile cycle. The smad1/5/8 pathway
  transactivates SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase), which increased fatty acid desaturation.
  The resulting unsaturated fatty acids by SCD1 enzymatic activity are incorporated
  into the triacylglycerol, which is the necessary process of synthesis of triacylglycerol.
  Moreover, TAG with higher percentage of unsaturated fatty acid are more readily
  to mobilize. Thus, SCD1 accelerates both the synthesis and lysis of triglycerides.
  BMP, bone morphogenetic protein.
