caption: Heat map of metabolite changes in the midvein of oilseed rape leaves during
  senescence. The main vein of leaves was harvested from plants grown under low (LN)
  or high (HN) nitrate conditions. Metabolite concentrations were determined as the
  peak area in GC-MS analyses normalized to sample fresh weight. Log2 of the ratios
  of the metabolite concentrations to their value in the youngest leaf of the high
  nitrate treatment (HNV15) are presented on a metabolic pathway representation by
  shades of red or blue colours according to the scale bar. The stage of senescence
  of each leaf rank is indicated by shades of colours from yellow (more senescent
  old leaf) to green (less senescent young leaf) according to the scale bar. Data
  represent mean values of four biological replicates for each leaf rank and time
  point. V3 to V11 or V15, midvein harvested from the different leaf ranks, from the
  oldest (V3) to the youngest V11 and V15 for LN- and HN-grown plants, respectively.
