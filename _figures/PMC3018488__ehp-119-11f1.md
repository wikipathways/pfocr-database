caption: 'Simplified scheme of SAM synthesis and its involvement in arsenic and DNA
  methylation. The human arsenic metabolic pathway involves a series of methylation
  reactions; both arsenic metabolism and DNA methylation require SAM as the methyl
  donor. Here we show the intermediate steps of SAM synthesis and its involvement
  in the methylation of DNA and arsenic. Abbreviations: AS3MT, arsenic (+3 oxidation
  state) methyltransferase; ATP, Adenosine-5′-triphosphate; MAT1A, methionine adenosyltransferase
  I; MTR, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase; PPP, tripolyphosphate.'
