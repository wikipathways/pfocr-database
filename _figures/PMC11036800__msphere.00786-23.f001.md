caption: Schematic of presumed glycerol metabolism in P. aeruginosa. Glycerol is taken
  up by diffusion through the facilitator GlpF, which may be associated with the kinase
  GlpK to immediately phosphorylate incoming glycerol molecules. G-3-P is dehydrogenated
  by GlpD to DHAP, the central molecule in the pathway. DHAP can be isomerized to
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by TPI and then converted into pyruvate to feed the TCA
  cycle (left pathway). Alternatively, DHAP can be converted to fructose by fructose
  bisphosphate aldolase (FDA). This anabolic production of fructose leads to G-6-P
  via gluconeogenesis. G-6-P can either be used for biosynthesis or be burned for
  energy via the ED pathway (right pathway). Within the ED pathway, the Edd and Eda
  enzymes catalyze the steps in the production of pyruvate from 6-phosphogluconate,
  which can be derived from G-6-P.
