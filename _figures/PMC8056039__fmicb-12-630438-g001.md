caption: The interaction between gut immune response, microbiota and pathogens in
  mosquito females. (A) The strong increase of gut-associated microbial load after
  blood meal induces the activation of the IMD pathway in midgut epithelial cells
  and the release of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The contact between bacterial
  cells or bacterial-associated molecules (such as peptidoglycans) and epithelium
  is partially prevented by the peritrophic matrix (PM) which forms soon after a blood
  meal. Other mosquito-secreted molecules can be exploited by the bacteria as protection
  from AMPs, such as C-type lectins. When the PM integrity is impaired (B) by the
  action, for example, of the Plasmodium ookinetes, the IMD pathway is activated and
  hemocytes are recruited to the infection site at the base of the epithelium thanks
  to the release of prostaglandin E2 by midgut cells. Apart from activating vector
  immune response some bacterial species are able to directly limit (C) or to favor
  (D) pathogen and virus infection in mosquitoes.
