caption: (a) Acid-base regulatory strategy in P. fucata is involved in the response
  to elevated CO2. The homeostasis of intracellular H+ and HCO3− are regulated by
  cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase (CA), membrane-associated CA12, and apical and basolateral
  proton pumps, ion channels, exchangers and transporters, including increased expression
  of vacuolar type H+ -ATPases (V-ATPase), sodium/hydrogen exchangers (NHE3/5), chloride
  channels (CLC), sodium/potassium-transporting ATPases (NKA) and sodium/potassium/calcium
  exchangers (NCKX), decreased expression of anion/bicarbonate transporter family
  members (SLC26A3/4/6), and normal expression of sodium bicarbonate cotransporters
  (NBC1/3), anion exchangers (AE2), and K+ channels. In these processes, increased
  energy demand is supplemented by enhancement of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
  and oxidative phosphorylation (OP) is stimulated by HCO3−via adenylate cyclase (AC)-induced
  signaling and membrane transport, including increased expression of complex I (CI),
  F0F1-type ATPases (F-ATPase), AC, cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA). In the diagram,
  crimson indicates up-regulation, green indicates down-regulation, and gray indicates
  insignificant changes. The solid arrows show the direction of ions and CO2 diffusion.
  The dotted arrows show the hypothetical signaling pathways. (b) Anti-oxidative and
  lysosome pathways in P. fucata are involved in the response to elevated temperature.
  Elevated temperature induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via
  increased expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP), resulting in oxidative stress. Under
  the medium temperature stress (25 °C), the increased expression of “anti-oxidation”-related
  genes [e.g., heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and
  glutathione peroxidase (GPO)], activation of the “Toll-like receptor signaling pathway”
  and depressed “arachidonic acid metabolism” promote anti-oxidative regulation in
  mantle cells. Under high temperature stress (31 °C), the “lysosome” pathway is the
  main defense system for clearing damaged proteins and organelles, with assistance
  from HSP70. The energy supplement might originate from the enhanced degradation
  of other glycans. In this diagram, crimson indicates up-regulated genes, green indicates
  down-regulated genes, pink indicates enhanced pathways, blue indicates inhibited
  pathways, and gray indicates oxidative stress.
