caption: STAT5 is required for differentiation of luminal progenitor cells into alveolar
  cells. STAT5 activation mediates alveolar cell fate commitment and proliferation
  that leads to lactational differentiation. Mammary stem cells give rise to progenitor
  cells that differentiate into ductal or luminal progenitor cells. ELF5 induces differentiation
  of luminal progenitor cells into alveolar cells downstream of prolactin signaling.
  Cell types illustrated in pink exhibit STAT5 activation. ELF5, E74-like factor 5
  (ets domain transcription factor); PRL, prolactin; STAT5, signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 5.
