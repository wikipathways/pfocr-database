caption: 'This model summarizes the contribution of IKAROS in the regulation of NOTCH
  target genes. Two groups of genes were identified and investigated: genes overexpressed
  when IKAROS is absent and the NOTCH pathway is induced (‘additive effect’, left
  panel); and genes downregulated by the absence of IKAROS combined to the NOTCH pathway
  induction (‘desensitize effect’, right panel). Based on the results presented in
  here, IKAROS and NuRD are first and foremost required for priming and transcriptional
  poised chromatin organization of these genes. Both, additive as well as desensitize
  genes share common regulation when IKAROS is present and the NOTCH pathway is not
  induced (A1, D1). IKAROS then binds chromatin and establishes competence for CHD4/NuRD
  (CHD4) and EZH2/PRC2 (EZH2) recruitment. H3K27me3, which is produced by the methyltransferase
  EZH2, marks the chromatin of Cdkn1a, Prdm16 and Nrarp, but not the chromatin of
  the transcriptionally active Tp53 gene. Whether EZH2 is recruited or the H3K27me3
  mark removed rapidly from this transcriptionally active gene, is not known. H3K4me3,
  which results from the activity of MLL/SETD1 methyltransferases, also characterizes
  the four target genes when IKAROS is present and the NOTCH pathway is not induced.
  Together, H3K27me3 with H3K4me3 typify bivalent chromatin associated to many primed
  genes and transcription poised organization. In the absence of IKAROS and/or induction
  of NOTCH (A2-A4 and D2-D4), the chromatin association of IKAROS and CHD4/NuRD can
  hinder efficient/optimal recruitment of BRG1/BAF and restrict transcriptional enhancement;
  the substantial recruitment of CHD4/NuRD to chromatin requires IKAROS but can be
  further enhanced upon NOTCH activation (NICD might also interact with NuRD []);
  the high expression or overexpression of additive and desensitize genes is associated
  with increasing H3K79me2, which is deposited by DOT1L and is associated to the transcriptional
  elongation machinery. The regulation of additive and desensitized gene differs in
  the ratio between the H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 that characterizes their chromatin upon
  NOTCH pathway induction and/or the absence of IKAROS. In summary, the regulation
  of these genes is similar in IKAROS expressing cells prior to NOTCH pathway induction.
  After NOTCH induction, the regulation of additive genes and desensitize genes diverge.
  Thus, we propose that IKAROS is a pioneer transcription factor granting chromatin
  organisation and competence for gene expression, which are critical for rapid and
  physiological transcription induction upon signaling. Grey line: gene TSS (transcriptional
  start site); Ik: IKAROS; green arrows: active transcription, which is proportional
  to the size of the arrow; orange filled dot; histone H3K27me3; light green filled
  dot histone H3K4me3; dark green filled dot: histone H3K79me2;?: unknown additional
  factors.'
