caption: Farnesol induces ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response.
  Activation of the MEK-ERK signaling pathway by farnesol is an early event that is
  critical in triggering the UPR. The UPR is initiated by the activation of several
  ER stress-sensor proteins, including PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. Dissociation of the ER
  chaperone BiP/GRP78 from UPR sensor protein complexes plays a critical role in their
  activation. Release of BiP leads to activation and nuclear translocation of ATF6.
  Activation of PERK results in the phosphorylation of eIF2α and subsequently to an
  attenuation of the rate of general mRNA translation and protein synthesis. However,
  it selectively enhances the translation of some mRNAs, including the transcription
  factor ATF4. Active IRE1 induces alternative splicing of XBP1 mRNA resulting in
  the synthesis of a potent transcriptional activator. ATF4, ATF6, and XBP1 enhance
  the transcription of several chaperones. Activation of these pathways lead to inhibition
  of newly synthesized protein, increased degradation of misfolded proteins, and amplification
  of the protein folding capacity with the intend to restore normal ER function and
  promote cell survival. If ER homeostasis cannot be restored, cells start to undergo
  apoptosis. The IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1-JNK cascade is an important pro-apoptotic signaling
  pathway in ER stress. GRPs, glucose response proteins; SRPs, stress response proteins;
