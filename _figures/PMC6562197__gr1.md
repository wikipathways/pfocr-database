caption: The cAMP signalling pathway in cardiac myocytes. In response to adrenergic
  stimulation via β1- or β2-adrenergic receptors (β1AR, β2AR), cAMP is synthesized
  by adenylyl cyclases (AC) and degraded by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The effector
  proteins protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) are
  part of signalosomes, which are organized by A protein kinase associated proteins
  (AKAPs). Target proteins, which are getting phosphorylated by PKA are often part
  of AKAP-dependent signalosomes. Popeye domain containing (POPDC) proteins are localized
  to many different subcellular compartments, some of which are also shared by other
  cAMP binding proteins. It is unknown whether POPDC proteins are part of the same
  signalosome complex as other cAMP effector proteins. Like PKA and EPAC proteins,
  POPDC proteins are also found in the nucleoplasm probably lacking the transmembrane
  domains (ΔTM-POPDC).
