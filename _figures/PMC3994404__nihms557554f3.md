caption: Receptor tyrosine kinase trafficking may affect signal transduction. Trafficking
  of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as KIT, may regulate signal transduction
  pathways by binding to adaptor proteins specific to endosomal compartments and altering
  the type of signaling complexes recruited. Initiation of RTK signaling triggers
  recruitment to lipid rafts where interactions with plasma membrane anchored signaling
  molecules is facilitated. In particular, lipid rafts may be critical for signaling
  through the Src family kinases, PI3K and PLCγ1. Internalization of RTKs can induce
  the activation of additional signaling pathways by recruitment of adaptor proteins
  such as adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interaction, PH domain and leucine zipper
  containing 1 (APPL1) in very early endosomes, which can bind AKT and direct signaling
  through GSK3β. As the early endosome matures it becomes positive for PtdIns(3)P
  which recruits the early early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) protein. At this point,
  the early endosome may sort receptors for recycling back to the plasma membrane.
  Receptors that are not recycled remain in the endosome as it matures to a late endosome
  and control switches from Rab5 to Rab7. Signaling still occurs within the limiting
  membrane of late endosomes where adaptor protein complexes of p14, p18 and MP1,
  which are specific to the late endosomal compartments, may promote unique signaling
  to the MAPK pathway. The localization of late endosomes may also promote signal
  transduction to the nucleus because their close proximity to the centrosome allows
  weak signals to travel shorter distances and reach the nucleus. Eventually, receptors
  passage into intraluminal vesicles of multi-vesicular bodies and lysosomes, which
  results in cessation of signaling and receptor degradation. The schematic is an
  oversimplification, as multiple signaling pathways may well occur at all stages
  of receptor trafficking, but enrichment of particular adaptor proteins may promote
  a particular pathway by facilitating specific interactions. Activating mutations
  in RTKS favor their intracellular localization and trigger signaling from intracellular
  compartments in the absence of ligand. Further studies are needed to determine how
  the constitutively active RTKs traffic and signal in cells. Normal RTKs are depicted
  in green and mutated RTKs in red.
