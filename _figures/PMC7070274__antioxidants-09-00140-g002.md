  in oxidized glutathione and thiols. At the same time NADPH is used for synthesis
  of DNA and fatty acid synthesis and is needed for activities of NADPH oxidases,
  NO-synthase and other processes. The scheme is simplified and regulatory networks
  functioning in living systems are much more complex and include other mechanisms
  and feedback loops. For example, it was recently shown that the deletion of Nrf2
  in mice can be—to a large extent—compensated by other adaptive mechanisms in conditions
  of caloric restriction []. This suggests that robust regulatory network beyond Nrf2
  and FOXO transcription factors exists in order to maintain redox balance. Abbreviations:
