caption: Changes in Adipose Tissue During Weight Gain. During obese adipose tissue
  expansion, preadipocyte differentiation is impaired, and hypoxia activates hypoxia‐inducible
  factor 1 (HIF‐1) to decrease adiponectin expression and upregulate leptin. HIF‐1
  also promotes angiogenesis by turning on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
  The altered leptin:adiponectin ratio promotes proinflammatory immune cell infiltration
  and the formation of crown‐like structures (CLS). Dying adipocytes release free
  fatty acids (FFAs), which bind toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) on macrophages and adipocytes
  to activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF‐κB) and upregulate secretion of inflammatory
  cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‐α), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), IL‐8,
  chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5), and CCL2. These cytokines promote lipolysis
  and FFA release to further activate the NF‐κB pathway, which also increases aromatase
  expression and estrogen synthesis. CCL2 and other cytokines serve as chemoattractants
  to recruit monocytes/macrophages. These feed‐forward loops establish a chronic inflammatory
  milieu in obese adipose tissue. IFN‐γ indicates interferon gamma; TGF‐β, transforming
  growth factor beta; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; Th1, T‐helper 1 cells;
  Th17, T‐helper 17 cells; Treg, T‐regulatory cells.
