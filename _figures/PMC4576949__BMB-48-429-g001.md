caption: YAP may be maintained in inactivated state by VE-cadherin-PI3/Akt signaling
  axis in quiescent endothelial cells. VE-cadherin clustering not only induces catenine
  complex formation, but also induces Akt activation pathways. When VE-cadherin-mediated
  cell to cell contact is disrupted in a variety of pathophysiological conditions,
  PI3/Akt pathway is inactivated, which results in nuclear localization of YAP. Nuclear
  YAP induces ANG-2 for angiogenic sprouting and vascular remodeling. Destabilized
  actin cytoskeleton might also affect YAP activity in endothelial cells. This requires
  further investigations (Figure is reproduced from an original article published
  in Nature Communications).
