caption: Signaling pathways activated by CO and BR. CO exerts pleiotropic cellular
  effects by modulating intracellular signaling pathways. sGC represents one possible
  target of CO action. Activation of sGC leads to enhanced synthesis of cGMP and subsequent
  activation of G-kinase. This pathway has been implicated in vascular and neural
  effects of CO. CO treatment also modulates major MAPK pathways, including upregulation
  of p38 MAPK and downregulation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) or extracellular
  signal–regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathways. p38 MAPK has been implicated in antiinflammatory,
  antiapoptotic, and antiproliferative effects of CO by sGC-dependent and sGC-independent
  pathways, depending on the model system. Recently, the tumor suppressor protein,
  caveolin-1, and the heat shock factor-1 (hsf1) have been shown to act as intermediates
  in the antiproliferative and antiinflammatory effects of CO, respectively. Additional
  potential targets of CO include Ca2+-activated K+ channels (Kca) implicated in vasodilation.
  The pathways by which BV or BR elicit cytoprotective actions are less well studied.
  Recent evidence implicates p38 MAPK in the antiproliferative effect of BR.
