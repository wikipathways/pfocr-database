caption: Schematic representation of molecular changes from acute psychostimulant
  exposure to persistent molecular changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsal
  striatum. A, Acute exposure to psychostimulant increases synaptic dopamine and glutamate
  in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum. Dopamine binds postsynaptic D1 receptors
  and activates the cyclic AMP (cAMP) second-messenger pathway. cAMP activates protein
  kinase A (PKA) that phosphorylates several target molecules including NMDA and AMPA
  receptors and L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs), resulting in an increase in intracellular
  Ca2+ (High [Ca2+]i) and activation of Ca2+/CaM (calmodulin) kinases. PKA also phosphorylates
  downstream signaling molecules including dopamine and adenosine 3′, 5′- monophosphate
  regulated phosphoprotein 32 (DARPP-32) and CREB. Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at
  Thr 34 (P-DARPP-32) converts it to a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1),
  a phosphatase that dephosphorylates CREB. Inhibition of PP1 and activation of PKA
  result in an increase in CREB phosphorylation that activates downstream acute gene
  expression. B, Following chronic psychostimulant exposure, under conditions of low
  intracellular Ca2+ (Low [Ca2+]i), L-type Ca2+ channels would activate Ca2+/CaMdependent
  calcineurin (PP2B), resulting in dephosphorylation of its targets that include AMPA
  receptors and DARPP-32. DARPP-32 in its dephosphorylated state no longer would inhibit
  PP1, resulting in dephosphorylation of CREB and alteration of CREB-mediated gene
  expression. DA = dopamine; GLU = glutamate; CRE = cyclic AMP and calcium response
  element; AP1 = Activator Protein 1.
