caption: a) Schematic diagram showing that the Hippo/YAP and FGF/FGFR pathways interact
  with each other to form a positive feedback loop to regulate activities of FTSECs.
  Our data indicated that dysfunction of the Hippo signaling pathway may lead to dysregulation
  of YAP protein expression or activation. Overexpression or constitutive activation
  of YAP protein in FTSECs is able to promote proliferation and drive transformation
  of these cells. Moreover, increased YAP activation stimulates secretion of FGF ligands
  and expression of FGFRs. Elevated FGF ligands bind to the increased FGF receptors
  to activate downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K and MAPK pathways, leading
  the suppression of the Hippo pathway and activation of YAP protein. Dysfunction
  of FGFR pathway may also have the similar effect on the FTSECs. The Hippo/YAP and
  FGF/FGFR pathways interact with each other to form a positive feedback loop to regulate
  activities of FTSECs. b) The clinical relevance of the discovered positive feedback
  loop is evidenced by the results from the multidimensional cancer genomics data
  analysis. These large-scale patient sample analyses indicate that 77% of ovarian
  HGSC cases (322/420) have alterations in major genes composing the positive feedback
  loop.
