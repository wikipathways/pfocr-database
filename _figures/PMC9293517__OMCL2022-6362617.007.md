caption: Summary of metabolite classification in metabolomics. (a) Blank vs. model
  (AD rat) differential metabolites. (b) Sc-At vs. model differential metabolites.
  The grey circle represents the metabolites with reduced content, the yellow circle
  represents the metabolites with increased content, the orange circle represents
  the pathway, the brown hexagon represents the category to which they belong, and
  the purple triangle represents the subgroup to which they belong.
