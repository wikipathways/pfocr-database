caption: 'PI3K-PTEN-AKT-FOXO3-mTOR and the Hippo signaling pathways as primary regulators
  of primordial follicle activation. At the top of the figure, the female reproductive
  system (ovary and follicle enlarged) is shown, as well as a schematic representation
  of follicle activation steps. In the PI3K/AKT pathway, PI3K is activated by the
  binding of the KIT ligand (KITL), released by pre-granulosa cells (GCs) to the KIT/tyrosine
  kinase receptor on the oocyte. PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 into PIP3, promoting PDK1
  recruitment to the membrane. In turn, PDK1 activates Akt, which moves to the nucleus
  and phosphorylates the FOXO3 transcription factor. On the contrary, PTEN dephosphorylates
  PIP3 to PIP2 while preventing the activation of the follicle. (B) Hippo pathway:
  Internal stresses or ovarian tissue fragmentations lead to the polymerization of
  globular actin (G-actin) to filamentous actin (F-Actin), causing disruption to the
  Hippo signaling pathway, which results in the expression of MTS1/2 and SAV1 complex.
  The latter is able to phosphorylate LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1 and 2). LATS1/2
  prevent the phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ, promoting their translocation into the
  nucleus. YAP/TAZ stimulate the transcription of downstream growth factors stimulators
  such as 1 CYR61/CCN1, CTGF/CCN2, and BIRC genes, resulting in primordial follicle
  activation and development.'
