caption: Main mechanisms of EE in post-stroke neurogenesis and functional recovery.
  Post-ischemic EE increased the production and secretion of activated astrocytes
  after ischemic stroke. Astrocytic HMGB1 then enhances the production and secretion
  of activated astrocytes through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Astrocytic IL-6 promotes
  post-stroke neurogenesis and functional recovery.
