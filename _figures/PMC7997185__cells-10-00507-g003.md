caption: The possible involvement of NEK6 and NEK7 in DDR. NEK6 kinase activity is
  inhibited by ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2 caffeine-sensitive signaling pathway after DSBs induced
  by IR and UV treatment. NEK6 kinase activity inhibition by DDR is necessary for
  G2/M arrest. NEK6 is repressed by miR-23a, which is induced by berberine, a genotoxin
  that increases the accumulation of DSBs, in a p53-dependent manner. NEK7 is related
  to a protective function of telomeres in response to oxidative DNA damage. ATM activation
  mediates the function of NEK7 in telomeres. NEK7 is recruited to the telomeres and
  binds and phosphorylates TRF1 in S114, preventing its degradation. The integrity
  of telomeres is linked to the stability of TRF1.
