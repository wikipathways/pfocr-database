caption: Phenotype term query. An example query using “craniosynostosis” as the searched
  term. a A researcher may wish to know what genes are likely causal for a disease
  or phenotypic trait. FGFR2 is shown to be the most likely causal gene on OMIM, Orphanet,
  and Phen2Gene for craniosynostosis, particularly for “Beare-Stevenson Syndrome”
  (BSS). Pathway information from Reactome for “Activated point mutants of FGFR2”
  demonstrates further evidence that FGFR2 is the most likely causal gene and provides
  several alternative drug target candidates. Literature and openFDA data also support
  fluoxetine, which has significant effects on FGFR2 and its pathways, as a potential
  cause of the condition. b Alternative ways to look at this symptom include finding
  alternative co-occurring conditions in COHD, in addition to finding past treatments
  for patients in the Columbia University Irving Medical Center in conjunction with
  clinical trial data. FGFR2 is still shown to be a causal gene for many alternative
  syndromes with this condition. Finally, a user can find current funded research,
  its principal investigators (PIs), new sources of NIH funding, and non-profit foundations
  that support research and treatment for the condition
