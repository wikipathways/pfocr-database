caption: Fig. 1. Pathways controlling cell cycle progression and survival. Two signaling
  cascades emanate from the IRS molecules. One may signal survival, cell growth, and
  cell cycle progression through the PI3K branch and another, which constitutes a
  cooperative or overlapping pathway, operates through the MAPK cascade. The former
  can be down-regulated by the lipid phosphatase PTEN and acts independently of the
  MAPK pathway. Its effects on S6K1 regulate the translational machinery, influencing
  cell growth and cell division. The MAPK pathway may use different CREB kinases in
  a context-specific manner.
