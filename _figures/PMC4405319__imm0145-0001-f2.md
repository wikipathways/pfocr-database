caption: 'Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding
  to TLR4 with co-stimulatory molecules, CD14, lipopolysaccharide binding protein
  (LBP), CD11b, CD18 and MD-2, recruits MyD88-dependent and -independent intracellular
  proteins. MyD88-independent pathway: signalling proteins, TRAM and TRIF, and kinases,
  IKKε and TBK-1, are recruited to the intracellular domain of TLR4. These are activated
  and phosphorylate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Phosphorylated IRF-3 translocates
  into the nucleus for transcription of interferon-β. MyD88-dependent pathway: MyD88
  and TIRAP/MAL are recruited to the intracellular domain of the TLR4 receptor. IRAK-4
  and IRAK-1 are activated via phosphorylation. IRAK-1 interacts with TRAF6, inducing
  activation of MAPK and transcription of AP-1 and NF-κB genes to produce pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activation of the PI3K–AKT pathway
  results in impaired AP-1/NF-κB cytokine production. IRAK-M negatively regulates
  MyD88-pathway signalling. Underlined co-stimulatory molecules and signalling proteins
  represent those that are differentially expressed in the immature immune response.
  Italicized co-stimulatory molecules and signalling proteins represent those that
  are differentially expressed in the endotoxin and immune tolerant responses.'
