caption: 'Metabolic pathway of terpene biosynthesis. The terpenes’ skeletons are formed
  by the condensation of multiple units of IPP and its isomer, DMAPP. MEP biosynthetic
  pathway starts with pyruvate and G3P. Through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions,
  it ultimately produces IPP and DMAPP (shown on a light blue background). This process
  involves a variety of enzymes, DXS (1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase) and
  DXR (1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase), CMS (2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  4-phosphate cytidyltransferase), CMK (4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  kinase), MDS (2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase), HDS (4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl
  diphosphate synthase), and HDR (4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase).
  The MVA biosynthetic pathway, which is another pathway for terpene biosynthesis,
  distinct from the MEP pathway, starts with acetyl-CoA. The primary enzymes involved
  in the MVA pathway are acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase (HMGS), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), mevalonate kinase (MVK),
  phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase (MVD),
  and isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase (IDI). Geranyl diphosphate synthase
  (GPPS), farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase
  (GGPPS), and farnesylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GFPPS) TPs convert the basic
  terpene precursors, IPP and DMAPP, into various terpene compounds. Abbreviation
