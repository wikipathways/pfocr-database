caption: Targeting immunosuppressive molecular pathways in EC. Tumor cell induces
  immunosuppression by the production of immunosuppressive factors such as TGF-β,
  IL-10, VEGF, and COX-2. Tumor cells undergoing EMT can acquire both aggressive and
  immunosuppressive properties. Wnt/β-catenin pathway and STAT3-related pathway are
  activated in tumor cells and immunosuppressive cells and therefore they seem to
  be attractive targets for EC immunotherapy.
