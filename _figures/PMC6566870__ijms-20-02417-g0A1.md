caption: Simplified diagram of the signaling assays measured. Chemokine recognition
  induces conformational change(s) in the receptor. The ensemble of activated GPCR
  conformations is dependent on the agonist bound on the extracellular side and determines
  which intracellular effectors, such as G proteins or Arrestins, are preferentially
  recognized to induce further downstream signaling. Common GPCR signaling pathways
  include ERK1/2 phosphorylation through activation of the mitogen activated protein
  kinases (MAPK) pathway and Gαi-mediated cAMP inhibition following trimeric G protein
  dissociation. The specific pathway giving rise to ERK1/2 phosphorylation may vary
  depending on the cellular context. Here we used forskolin (Fsk) to directly stimulate
  cAMP production via activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC).
