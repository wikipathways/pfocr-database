caption: Mechanisms of cellular [18F]FLT retention. Similar to thymidine in the salvage
  pathway, [18F]FLT is taken up from the extracellular milieu by specialized nucleoside
  transporters or via passive diffusion. Within the cell [18F]FLT is phosphorylated
  by thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), the enzyme also responsible for phosphorylation of
  thymidine. TK1 activity is dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The phosphorylated
  form of thymidine (TMP) is further phosphorylated to thymidine diphosphate (TDP)
  and thymidine triphosphate (TTP), which is subsequently incorporated into the DNA.
  The phosphorylated form of [18F]FLT cannot be incorporated into DNA but is trapped
  within the cell . Techniques like PET or gamma counter measurements are capable
  of quantifying the rate of accumulation of [18F]FLT within cells. An alternative
  thymidine metabolism pathway is the de novo synthesis. The key enzyme of this pathway
  is thymidylate synthase (TS), which methylates deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP)
  to TMP. The two pathways merge at the level of TMP. Studies describing the importance
  of the different factors for [18F]FLT uptake are described in detail in the Supplementary
  Results.
