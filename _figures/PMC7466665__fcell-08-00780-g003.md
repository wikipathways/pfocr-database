caption: Potential role of LPA on Hippo-YAP mediated osteogenesis, angiogenesis and
  osteoimmunology. LPA may act as an upstream extracellular signal of Hippo pathway
  via GPCRs (LPA1-6). Provided that Hippo pathway is activated, MST1/2 and SAV1 are
  phosphorylated and activate the complex of LATS1/2 and MOB1A/B. As a result, the
  phosphorylated YAP/TAZ is sequestrated in the cytoplasm by interacting with 14-3-3
  proteins or degraded. Conversely, in the context of Hippo off, YAP/TAZ is dephosphorylated
  and translocate into nucleus, regulating a variety of cell properties by influencing
  gene expression with its main transcriptional factor TEAD, including genes that
  dominate osteogenesis, angiogenesis and osteoimmunology. Therefore, we propose that
  LPA-Hippo axis may perform regulatory effects on osseointegration procedure by influencing
  osteogenesis, angiogenesis and osteoimmunology.
