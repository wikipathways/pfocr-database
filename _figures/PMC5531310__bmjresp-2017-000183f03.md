caption: Glycolysis is downregulated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lungs,
  with possible shuttling of intermediates to the sorbitol and pentose phosphate pathways.
  (A) Analysis of gene expression for key enzymes of glycolysis. Gene-encoding enzymes,
  including the genes 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3),
  phosphofructokinase (PFK), phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), PGAM4, glucose-6-phosphatase
  catalytic subunit 3 (G6PC3) and SLC2A4RG, were significantly downregulated in IPF
  compared with normal suggesting a decreased rate of glycolysis (p<0.05). (B) The
  classical glycolysis/pentose/energy pathways are shown. (C) Data for metabolic intermediates
  in the normal lung (NL) are shown in green boxes, and data for IPF are represented
  in purple boxes. Levels of glycolytic intermediates fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fructose
  1,6-BP) and phosphoenolpyruate were significantly decreased in IPF, suggesting decreased
  glycolysis. Fructose levels were significantly increased, whereas sorbitol levels
  showed an upwards trend in IPF, possibly indicating shuttling of glycolytic intermediates
  towards the sorbitol pathway. The y-axis label of metabolic changes is shown as
  counts×106 and the y-axis label for gene expression encoding enzymes as fold changes
  of relative RNA levels of enzymes. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
