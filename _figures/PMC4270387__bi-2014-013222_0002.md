caption: Examples of non-stress-related peroxide signaling. The white panel (left)
  shows a general scheme of growth factor-triggered peroxide signaling. Binding of
  growth factor to receptors (green) leads to the activation of oxidases (orange)
  and the production of superoxide that is subsequently converted to peroxide. Certain
  aquaporins (dark red) facilitate the entry of peroxide into the cell where kinases
  (light purple), phosphatases (dark purple), and transcription factors, (dark blue)
  can be oxidatively activated or deactivated. Active Prxs (cyan toroid) degrade peroxides
  but also can be inactivated by hyperoxidation (dark toroid); Srx (light red) reactivates
  hyperoxidized Prxs. The magenta and purple panels convey other examples of peroxide
  signaling highlighted in the text. In LPA-mediated signaling (magenta, bottom),
  binding of LPA to its receptor (green) activates NADPH oxidase (NOX, orange), and
  through endocytosis, a “redoxosome” is formed. Superoxide/peroxide accumulates in
  the redoxosome, and it serves as a hub for modifying regulatory factors. In murine
  adrenal corticosteroid production (purple, top right), binding of ACTH to its receptor
  (green) leads to the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway (the transcription factor
  cAMP response element-binding protein is denoted with an asterisk) and then phosphorylation
  and activation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR); StAR makes cholesterol
  available for CYP11A1- and CYP11B1-catalyzed conversion via 11-deoxycorticosterone
  (DOC) to corticosterone (CS) and also produces superoxide from which superoxide
  dismutase (SOD) produces peroxide. The peroxide increasingly inactivates PrxIII
  and after further buildup initiates a negative feedback loop by activating p38,
  which in turn suppresses the synthesis of StAR.
