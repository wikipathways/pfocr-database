caption: 'Model of PER2 modulating the assembly of the CREB/CRTC1/CBP transcriptional
  complex. Left: In the early dark phase at ZT14, PER2 interacts with CREB and CRTC1.
  On the other hand, CREB and CRTC1 do not dimerize at this stage, and all the elements
  do not bind to the CRE element in the Per1 promoter. CBP is not recruited to the
  regulatory region of Per1 and the histone H3K27 is not acetylated. Per1 is not transcribed
  through this pathway. Right: In the SCN or in cells a light pulse or forskolin treatment
  initiates a kinase cascade that leads to CREB phosphorylation and assembly of the
  CREB: CRTC1: CBP complex which is facilitated by PER2. As a consequence of this
  assembly, histone H3K27 is acetylated (grey star) and the Per1 gene is transcribed.
  The hatched oval with question mark indicates that most likely additional factors
  contribute to the initiation of transcription by the RNA polymerase II (POLII).
  Figure was generated using Adobe Illustrator version 24.3.1.'
