caption: Three validated protein complexes in the protein–protein interaction (PPI)
  network, protein complex A, C, and F. In protein complex A, red nodes are the genes
  enriched in the pathway of cell cycle; green nodes are the genes enriched in the
  pathway of DNA replication; purple nodes are the genes enriched in the pathway of
  purine metabolism; and the yellow node is the gene enriched in the pathway of one
  carbon pool by folate. In protein complex C, the red node is the gene enriched in
  the pathway of RNA degradation. In protein complex F, red nodes are the genes enriched
  in the pathway of axon guidance.
