caption: RP–Mdm2–p53 pathway forms a crucial link between nutrient deprivation and
  cellular energy homeostasis. Nutrient deprivation induces lipolysis in adipocytes
  generating free fatty acids (FFAs), which enter the liver to serve as a direct energy
  source or as a precursor for ketone body formation. In normal mouse liver, nutrient
  depletion causes ribosomal stress by inhibiting rRNA biosynthesis, which in turn
  inhibits Mdm2 (indicated by the smaller letters) and activates p53 to induce MCD
  expression. MCD facilitates the transport of FFAs into the mitochondrial matrix
  through CPT1α to be oxidized to acetyl-CoA by β-oxidation. Acetyl-CoA is then oxidized
  via the TCA cycle to produce energy and “reducing equivalents” (NADH and FADH2),
  which are used for ATP synthesis by OXPHOS. p53 also induces the expression of SCO2,
  a crucial component of the electron transport chain, to promote OXPHOS. Together,
  the action of the RP–Mdm2–p53 pathway maintains liver lipid homeostasis during the
  fasting state. However, in Mdm2C305F mouse livers, ribosomal stress in the form
  of nutrient deprivation cannot activate p53 (grayed out), which results in the accumulation
  of FFAs in the liver and hepatosteatosis.
