caption: Schematic of the LIF-LIFR Mediated Hippo signaling network, as well as YES-YAP
  activation. (A) Hippo pathway is active, leading to the inhibition of YAP1 and TAZ.
  It should be noted that YAP1 and TAZ do not necessarily have to associate to have
  a downstream effect, nor is TEAD the only transcription factor they bind to. Furthermore,
  there are many upstream inputs that can activate the core Hippo kinase cascade that
  do not involve Scribble, or LIFRβ. Such inputs include cellular adhesion, metabolism,
  and cytoskeletal tension. (B) Hippo pathway is inactive; YAP1 and TAZ are active
  and aid in the regulation of genes associated with cell proliferation, survival,
  and anchorage independent growth. YAP1 has been shown to be activated by YES downstream
  of LIF-LIFR signaling.
