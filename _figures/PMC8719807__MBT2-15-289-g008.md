caption: 'Updated metabolic model for fermentative glycerol metabolism in E. coli
  via complementary 1,2‐PDO‐ or H2‐dependent modes operating in a pH‐dependent manner.
  Under alkaline conditions, H2‐dependent mode operates in which HYD‐mediated proton
  reduction to H2 is directly coupled to the menaquinol‐generating GlpK‐GlpABC pathway,
  which also serves as a PEP‐independent glycerol dissimilation pathway to alleviate
  stoichiometric constraints resulting from the essential GldA‐DhaKLM pathway (Purple
  shading). Under acidic conditions, the 1,2‐PDO‐dependent mode exclusively utilizes
  GldA‐DhaKLM for glycerol dissimilation requiring PEP synthetase to regenerate PEP
  (Orange shading). Other relevant reactions are represented by the enzyme(s) catalysing
  each step. Dashed lines illustrate multiple reaction steps. Abbreviations: α‐KG,
  α‐ketoglutarate; see Fig.  for remaining list of abbreviations.'
