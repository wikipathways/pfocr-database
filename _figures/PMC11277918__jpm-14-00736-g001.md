caption: cGAS-STING pathway in tumors. In tumors, where cells tend to accumulate significant
  DNA damage, cGAS plays a pivotal role by catalyzing the production of cGAMP upon
  the detection of tumor-derived double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Subsequently, cGAMP
  binds to the STING protein located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), initiating
  a cascade of events. Activated STING is translocated from the ER to the Golgi apparatus
  via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. Once activated, STING
  triggers the activation of key signaling molecules such as TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase
  1) and IRF3 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 3). This activation culminates in the
  production of transcription factors NF-κB and interferon upon their translocation
  into the nucleus. Ultimately, these molecular responses orchestrate the immune-mediated
  destruction of tumor cells, thereby contributing to tumor suppression. cGAS cyclic
