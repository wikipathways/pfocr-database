caption: The microbial metabolic pathway of NADH-consuming compound production. One
  arrow indicates one step of reaction. The butyrate is NADH-balanced and generally
  produced more than butanol. The NADH reduction (inset) by electricity increases
  the flux of electron for butanol formation, more NADH-consuming pathway. Fe ox oxidized
  form of ferredoxin, Fe red reduced form of ferredoxin
