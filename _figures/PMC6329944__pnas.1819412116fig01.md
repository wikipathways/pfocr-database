caption: Three phases of tooth eruption, preeruptive, intraosseous, and supraosseous,
  require signaling in the PTHrP/PTH1R pathway. (A) In the preeruptive phase, teeth
  are fully surrounded by a bony crypt. The enamel organ produces PTHrP and CSF1 (arrows)
  which feed back to the dental follicle. (B) The intraosseous phase is characterized
  by the spatially restricted removal of bone on the coronal side of the tooth due
  to signals from the dental follicle (arrows). Osteoclasts invade and resorb the
  bone to create an eruption pathway (ep). Cementum starts to form on the root surfaces
  (c). (C) First molars in the present study () create an eruption pathway but do
  not move into the occlusal plane (red X). Excess cementum forms (c), perhaps forming
  transient fusions with bone, preventing eruption. (D) Normally, teeth move through
  the eruption pathway and form an attachment to the surrounding bone via the periodontal
  ligament. A full deletion of Pthrp followed by restoration of expression in the
  enamel organ using K14-Pthrp rescues eruption ().
