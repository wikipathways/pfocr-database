caption: Here, we report that, similar to glioma, breast cancer stem cells also depend
  more on oxidative phosphorylation for their energy needs. The experimental evidence
  suggesting that BCSCs depend more on oxidative phosphorylation are several-fold.
  BCSCs, (1) produce less lactate than their differentiated progeny (), (2) have a
  higher number of mitochondria or more functional mitochondria (as determined by
  the mitochondria-specific fluorescent stain MitoTracker-RED CMXRos ()), and (3)
  have higher ATP content (), which correlates with higher oxygen consumption rates
  (), and a more energetic state () (). Interestingly, to our surprise, BCSCs in our
  system also consumed more glucose than their differentiated counterparts () behaving
  more like a cell with a glycolytic phenotype. However, while there was no difference
  in relative expression of the M1 and M2 isoforms of pyruvate kinase, a glycolytic
  enzyme that has been implicated in the Warburg effect [], there was a significant
  difference in the relative expression of the phosphofructokinase (PFK)-P and L isoforms.
  PFK is a glycolytic enzyme that mediates a commitment step in glycolysis. Therefore,
  taken together these results indicate that BCSCs are not only taking up more glucose
  and are committing more of it down the glycolytic pathway, but are also shuttling
  more of the resulting pyruvate into the mitochondria, as indicated by the lower
  lactate production and increased oxygen consumption rates, mitochondrial numbers/mass
  and ATP content in BCSCs compared to their differentiated progeny (). Previously,
  we have reported that glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) stem cells exhibited higher
  lactate production, less glucose consumption and lower extracellular acidification
  rate [], results that seem contradictory to the findings reported here for BCSCs.
  It should be noted that lactate production levels in the current study were measured
  in breast cancer cells propagated in differentiation media (as monolayers) and compared
  to cultures propagated as mammospheres enriched in BCSCs. In contrast, the GBM stem
  cell study compared ZsGreen-cODC-neg and ZsGreen-cODC-pos cells sorted from neurosphere
  cultures enriched in GBM-SCs, thus these two data sets cannot be directly compared
  and do not necessarily contradict each other. In the case of glucose consumption,
  both studies (in breast and GBM) compared differentiated cultures (monolayers) with
  CSC-enriched cultures (mammospheres in breast, and neurospheres for GBM). However,
  we indeed observed opposite results, as mammosphere cultures had higher glucose
  uptake compared to their differentiated cultures, while in glioma neurosphere cultures
  consumed less glucose than the corresponding differentiated glioma cultures. Such
  a discrepancy cannot readily be explained, and further studies on levels of glucose
  transporters would be needed to shed light on these observed differences.
