caption: TGF-β-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. The TGF-β/SMAD pathway can
  arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by modulating the expression of specific
  genes, including induction of 4EBP1, p15INK4b, p16INK4A, p21WAF1 and p57KIP2 and
  repression of Id proteins, E2F, c-MYC and CDC25a genes. The TGF-β/SMAD pathway can
  induce cell apoptosis by inducing the expression of proapoptotic genes, such as
  BCL-XL, BIM, BIK, SHIP and TIEG. The TGF-β activation of TAK-1 occurs via TRAF6
  and the adaptor XIAP-mediated TAB/TAK-1 complex and GADD45β. Activation of NF-κB
  by the TAK pathway stimulates p38/JNK phosphorylation, which has been reported to
  lead to apoptosis. Additionally, the TGF-β signaling pathway can be coupled to the
  cell death machinery through ROS, autophagy activation (ATG-5/-6/-7), induction
  of DAPK expression, epigenetic changes and shortening of telomere length (regulating
  hTERT). Inhibitory signals are indicated with inhibitory red arrows; Stimulatory
  signals are indicated with green arrows. SMAD-mediated transcriptional events are
  indicated with the black arrow.
