caption: a| FtsZ assembly is coordinated with the initiation of DNA replication and
  nucleoid segregation to ensure that daughter cells receive complete copies of the
  bacterial genome. b| In Bacillus subtilis, the glucolipid biosynthesis pathway serves
  as a metabolic sensor to transmit information about carbon availability and growth
  rate, through the intracellular UDP–glucose concentration, to the division apparatus.
  When this sensor is functional (top), division is coupled to the achievement of
  a specific size (termed ‘critical mass’) as well as to mass doubling time. When
  this sensor is defective (bottom), division is uncoupled from the achievement of
  critical mass but remains sensitive to mass doubling time, resulting in reduced
  cell size.
