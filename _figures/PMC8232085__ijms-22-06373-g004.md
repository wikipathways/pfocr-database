caption: Microglial functions modified during aging and with polyphenol supplementation.
  IPA network analysis featuring annotated microglial functions enriched by MS-detected
  proteins for AGING comparison (A). Orange and blue nodes represent predicted activated
  and inhibited regulators, respectively. Darker colors indicate greater predicted
  activation or inhibition. Orange and blue lines depict regulation from upstream
  molecules to downstream function. Dataset proteins shown in green (downregulated)
  or red (upregulated) with MS-determined LFQ fold change and p-values; darker colors
  represent greater fold change; significance cutoff at p < 0.1 to incorporate a greater
  number of dataset proteins in predictive analysis. Annotated functions included
  antigen presentation, nitric oxide synthesis, cell aggregation, and necroptosis.
  Then, the pathway was fitted with OLD-NT-020 dataset proteins (B) to observe changes
  in aging microglial cell functions with NT-020 diet. Consistent with trends observed
  in differential protein expression, gene ontology, and canonical pathway analysis,
  activated predictions in AGING were reversed to inhibition in OLD-NT-020.
