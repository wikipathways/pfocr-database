caption: Activation and Attenuation of IL-33/ST2 Signaling. (A) IL-33/ST2 Signaling.
  IL-33 binds to ST2L causing a conformational change that leads to recruitment of
  IL1-RAcP. Heterodimerization of the transmembrane proteins results in interaction
  between their intracellular C-terminal domains that facilitates recruitment of adaptor
  molecules including MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6. Subsequent activation of transcription
  factors NF-κB, JNK, ERK, and p38 leads to expression of genes encoding cytokines,
  chemokines, and growth factors. (B) Attenuation of IL33-ST2 signaling. SIGIRR can
  disrupt the ST2L/IL1RAcP heterodimer. Phosphorylated ST2L is quickly internalized,
  polyubiquitinylated by the E3 ligase FBXL19 and targeted for degradation by the
  proteasome. Extracellular IL-33 can be sequestered by sST2 acting as a molecular
  decoy and can be quickly oxidized via its cysteine residues. Both processes prevent
  its interaction with the membrane bound ST2L receptor. Blue arrows indicate interaction
  between molecules, black arrows indicate gene regulation or transcriptional activation;
  red lines with bars indicate disruption of molecular interactions.
