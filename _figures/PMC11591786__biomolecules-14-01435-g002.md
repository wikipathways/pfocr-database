caption: Schematic representation of enzymatic steps from Acetyl-Coa leading to the
  Δ5 sterol biosynthetic pathway, illustrating the lanosterol (LSS, in invertebrates)
  biosynthesis route leading to cholesterol and the cycloartenol (CAS, in plants)
  biosynthesis route leading to stigmasterol. With the exception of FDFT1, farnesyl-diphosphate
  farnesyltransferase 1, all enzymatic abbreviations and EC numbers for vertebrate
  and plant enzymes are detailed in Table 1. Each enzymatic reaction is highlighted
  in red on the corresponding chemical structures. The first cyclic products of each
  sterol biosynthesis pathway, as well as the final sterols, are highlighted in bold
