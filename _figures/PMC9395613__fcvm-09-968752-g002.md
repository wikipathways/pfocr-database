caption: Regulation of CVB3 and autophagy in VMC. CVB3 infection triggers the formation
  of autophagosomes and uses the autophagosomal pathway for replication. CVB3 infection
  in cardiomyocytes activated calpain and increased. The inhibition of calpain activity
  led to the accumulation of LC3-II protein expression, impairing the autophagic flux.
  AT1 and AT2 regulate cardiomyocyte autophagy activity by propagating viral replication,
  thus triggering autophagic cell death. CVB3 might directly or indirectly induce
  autophagy via the AMPK/MEK/ERK and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways. CVB3 inhibits
  the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes. CVB3 specifically targets the SNARE
  protein SNAP29 and the adaptor protein PLEKHM1, both of which regulate autophagosome
  fusion, for cleavage through the catalytic activity of viral proteinase 3C; this
  process ultimately impairs the formation of SNARE complexes. The release of proinflammatory
  cytokines also participates in the cardiac fibroblasts caused by CVB3 infection,
  and the downregulation of autophagy suppresses them. CVB3, coxsackievirus B3; VMC,
  viral myocarditis; LC3, light chain 3; AT1 and AT2, Type I and II angiotensin II
  receptors.
