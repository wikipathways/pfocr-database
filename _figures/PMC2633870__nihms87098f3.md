caption: (Top) Each of the MMS toxicity modulating proteins found in the filtered
  interactome was colored according to its predominant functional theme, as defined
  by EcoGene or SwissProt. Red circle = DNA repair, replication, and recombination;
  blue circle = protein synthesis; purple circle = transcription; yellow circle =
  RNA processing; orange circle = protein stabilization; grey circle = unknown; white
  circle = other. (Bottom) MMS-toxicity modulating proteins with clustering coefficients
  greater then zero were determined using MATLAB algorithms and then visualized using
  Cytoscape. This was done to identify groups of proteins that have the potential
  to be part of a complex or pathway. RpsT was included due to its connectivity to
  the sub-network via Pnp and DeaD. Ultimately, the highly clustered sub-network centred
  on RplA was identified and contained activities involved in protein synthesis and
  RNA metabolism.
