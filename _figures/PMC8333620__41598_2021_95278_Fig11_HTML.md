caption: Proposed mechanism of action for the anticancer activity of C1 and/or C3
  against A375 human melanoma cancer cells. The oxidative stress caused by these complexes
  results in the high-value production of ROS. The ROS overproduction induces the
  activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway due to changes in the mitochondrial
  potential. The mitochondrial damage results in cytochrome C release in the cytosol
  and subsequently level of procaspases 9 and 3 increases. Moreover, apoptosis via
  the intrinsic pathway can be induced by the tumor suppressor p53 that activates
  Bax in response to DNA damage.
