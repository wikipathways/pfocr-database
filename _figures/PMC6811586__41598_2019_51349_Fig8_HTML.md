caption: The summarization of network-based gene set enrichment analysis procedure.
  The main inputs are transcriptomics data, background network, and list of regulators.
  NASFinder is applied to the sets of functionally related genes to identify the biological
  context (topology) which connects the molecules of interest together and their main
  regulator (e.g. receptors). Then, the significant sub-networks are used for pathway
  functional analysis and calculation of network activity score.
