caption: Mirin is an antiviral polyamide (AVP) sensitizer. Inhibition of MRE11 promotes
  the effectiveness of chemo- and radio-therapy (left) and antiviral polyamides (AVPs)
  (right). Inhibitors of DNA repair processes increase cell sensitivity toward therapeutic
  irradiation and chemotherapeutic agents that act by damaging cellular DNA. Inhibition
  of, for example, MRE11 or ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) augments cell death
  in response to DNA damage by preventing cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. In an
  analogous manner, Mirin (but not ATM inhibitor KU55933) promotes the degradation
  of HPV episomal DNA in response to AVPs. MRE11 therefore has a role that protects
  viral episomes from AVPs that does not require signaling through the ATM/CHK2 pathway
  [].
