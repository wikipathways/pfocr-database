caption: 'Several modulator molecules linked to the signaling of GLP-1 receptor within
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are demonstrated. Example molecules known to act on an
  AMPK/mTOR pathway are also shown. The activation of GLP-1 receptor results in the
  stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) that transforms adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  into 3-5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which then activates the cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase (PKA) as well as the following AMPK for the modification of autophagy/mitophagy.
  Some example factors including fasting, starvation, and/or metformin known to act
  on the autophagy/mitophagy signaling are also shown. Note that some critical pathways
  such as that for insulin induction have been omitted for clarity. Arrowhead means
  stimulation whereas hammerhead represents inhibition. Abbreviation: GLP-1, glucagon-like
  peptide-1; AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian/mechanistic
  target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3 kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; PTEN,
  phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10'
