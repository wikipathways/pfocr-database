caption: 'A network was generated around the Aurora-A (AURKA) and Aurora-B (AURKB)
  proteins was generated by the cBio portal [] using data from Pathway Commons regarding
  protein-protein (HPRD), enzymatic (Reactome ) and pathway (NCI-Nature Pathway Interaction
  Database) interactions. Of all neighbors of the seed genes (AURKA & AURKB), the
  50 most frequently altered in the SCCHN subset of TCGA data are shown. All proteins
  are identified by official gene symbol. Node coloring (white to red: low to high)
  reflects the combined frequency of all alterations for a given gene. Blue and green
  arrows represent enzyme-substrate interactions. The group of proteins circled by
  a dashed line represents a large group of coordinately regulated proteins found
  in a mitotic complex with Aurora-B at the centromere/kinetochore. Detailed information
  (i.e., copy number alterations, expression change, frequency of mutations) can be
  viewed for each gene in a network generated for AURKA and AURKB on http://www.cbioportal.org/.'
