caption: Homolytic cleavage of the fatty acid hydroperoxide and cyclization of the
  alkoxyl radical produces an epoxy allylic radical, readily converted to an epoxy
  allylic carbocation (middle box). A purely radical pathway can account for lyase
  activity via hemiacetal synthesis and its spontaneous cleavage to aldehydes (in
  blue). Alternatively, ionic intermediates (in red) can similarly account for lyase
  activity and are the preferred mechanistic route to allene oxide and divinyl ether.
  Although not illustrated, there is also the potential for epoxyalcohol synthesis
  through either radical or ionic pathways.
