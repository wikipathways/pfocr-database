caption: A model for the initiation of tasiRNA biogenesis. The precursor RNA bound
  to the initiator RISC—22-nt small RNA-loaded AGO1 or miR390-AGO7—interacts with
  SGS3s, which form liquid droplets. Then, SDE5 pulls RDR6 into the droplets by transiently
  interacting with AGO1/7, SGS3, and RDR6. In the two-hit pathway, removal of poly(A)
  tail by the cleavage of the 3′ target site promotes dsRNA synthesis. In this process,
  the 4-nucleotide mismatches between miR390 and the 3′ site are critical for the
  rapid release of the SGS3-miR390-AGO7 complex from the cleavage site. If the complementarity
  is too strong, the complex remaining at the 3′ cleavage site completely inhibits
  both dsRNA synthesis and tasiRNA production. In the one-hit pathway, although the
  poly(A) tail represses dsRNA synthesis, a small amount of tasiRNAs are generated.
  Such a low level of tasiRNAs cleave the target mRNA in cis, creating nonpolyadenylated
  3′ ends favored by RDR6. As the heteroduplex of the 3′ half of tasiRNAs and the
  5′ half of these binding sites are as weak as that of the 3′ half of miR390 and
  the 5′ half of the 3′ binding site in wild-type TAS3, tasiRNA-AGO1 complex can rapidly
  dissociate from the cleavage site.
