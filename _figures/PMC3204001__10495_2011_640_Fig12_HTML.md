caption: Schematic representation of the signaling apoptotic pathways induced by TEF.
  TEF rapidly induces ER calcium release through PLC-IP3pathway [], leading to caspase-4
  activation and to intracellular calcium increase. Accumulation of calcium in the
  nucleus (N) causes DNA damage; and in the mitochondria (M) it induces ROS production.
  An increase of ROS levels can cause DNA damage in the nucleus and cytochrome c release
  from mitochondria, leading to caspase-9 activation. Caspase-9 can also be directly
  activated by caspase-4. Caspase-2 and the p53/p73 signaling pathway become activated
  in response to DNA damage. Caspase-2 can directly cause cytochrome c release from
  mitochondria. p53 can induce cell cycle arrest through p21 induction and p73 could
  be responsible of Noxa induction and subsequent cytochrome c release and caspase-9
  activation. The initiator caspases-2, -4 and -9 cause executioner caspases activation
  and apoptosis
