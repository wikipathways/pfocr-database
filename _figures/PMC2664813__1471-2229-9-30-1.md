caption: 'A simplified diagram of enzymes and major products in the synthesis of chlorogenic
  acid in plants. The product names appear between the arrows. Enzymes involved in
  this pathway are: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/quinate
  hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; HQT, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; C3''H, p-coumaroyl ester 3''-hydroxylase.'
