caption: 'Schematics of the Hippo pathway in flies and mice. Cells (outlined in grey,
  nuclei in green) are shown with adherens junctions (AJ) and basolateral junctions
  (BLJ). (A,B) Hippo pathway components in (A) Drosophila and (B) vertebrate are shown
  in various colors, with pointed and blunt arrowheads indicating activating and inhibitory
  interactions, respectively. Continuous lines indicate direct interactions, whereas
  dashed lines indicate unknown mechanisms. See text for further details. Abbreviations:
