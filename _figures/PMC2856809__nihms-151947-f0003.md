caption: Dual MAG receptor model. MAG is envisioned as interacting independently with
  gangliosides (GD1a or GT1b, MAG-binding determinant highlighted) and with NgR’s
  (NgR1 or NgR2). In each pathway, MAG engagement results in transmembrane signals.
  For example, NgR1 interacts with transmembrane signaling molecules p75NTR and Lingo-1
  to transduce a signal that results in RhoA activation and inhibition of axon outgrowth.
  Gangliosides may signal via some of the same components, or via yet underfined components
  as shown, to activate RhoA, modulate axon and node of Ranvier structures, and stabilize
  axons. Additional modulating factors (cAMP, calcium, PKC) and potential pathway
  crosstalk are not shown (see []). Reproduced with permission [].
