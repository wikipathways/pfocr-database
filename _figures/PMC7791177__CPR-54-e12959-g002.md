caption: Alzheimer's related modulation of GluA1 and consequent pathology. A, M1 receptor
  activation can rescue cognitive impairment through modulation of GluA1 S845 phosphorylation
  and downstream incorporation with PSD‐95, a pathway that is compromised by Aβ aggregation.
  B, Aβ reduces PSD‐95, a protein involved in recruiting and anchoring glutamate receptor
  subunits to the post‐synaptic density. In agreement, we observed early reductions
  in surface expression of glutamate receptor subunit GluA1. C. Aβ oligomers cause
  mislocalization of tau protein to the dendritic spines. There, calcineurin‐mediated
  dephosphorylation of GluA1 S845 triggers a pathological cascade or rapid AMPAR insertion
  and acute neurotoxicity. D, Aβ oligomers impair synaptic function by decreasing
  the amplitude of mEPSCs
