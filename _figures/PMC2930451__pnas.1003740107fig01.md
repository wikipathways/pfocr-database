caption: Schematic illustration of flux balance analysis with constraints of grouping
  of functionally and physically related reactions based on genomic context and flux-converging
  pattern analyses. (A) By considering protein–protein associations based on genomic
  context analyses consisting of conserved neighborhood, gene fusion and co-occurrence,
  significantly related reactions were organized in a group. The binary variable,
  y, is 0 or 1. vj is the flux of reaction j and v1 and v2 belong to the same group.
  vj,min and vj,max are lower and upper bounds for the flux of reaction j. (B) The
  flux ranges of the grouped reactions based on genomic context analyses were further
  constrained by flux-converging pattern analyses based on the carbon number of metabolites
  that participate in each reaction (Ca) and the number of passing through flux-converging
  metabolites from a carbon source (Jb), for instance glucose in this study. A metabolite
  could be split into different metabolites or created by combining two metabolites.
  Each circle with different colors defines reaction groups that have a similar scale
  of flux values, determined by stoichiometric carbon balances for metabolites and
  fluxes through metabolic pathway. The flux-converging metabolite is defined as a
  metabolite that sums fluxes originated from a reaction that produces two or more
  metabolites into parallel pathways. δ denotes a constant defining the flux level
  of reactions in a reaction group. v1n, v2n are normalized flux of reaction 1, 2
  by dividing each reaction by a carbon source uptake rate, such as glucose. (C) To
  restrict the flux solution space of the Escherichia coli genome-scale model, the
  simultaneous on/off constraints (Con/off) by genomic context analyses and flux scale
  constraints (Cscale) by flux-converging pattern analyses were applied to the E.
  coli central metabolism. (D) Grouping of reactions using genomic context analysis
  and clustering of the grouped reactions using flux-converging pattern analysis in
  the form of CxJy. Cx indicates the carbon number of metabolites that participate
  in each reaction and Jy indicates the type of fluxes through flux-converging metabolites
  from a carbon source. The red metabolites are flux-converging metabolites. The flux-converging
  metabolites correspond to metabolites where two split reactions combine, indicated
  by bold, transparent, and red arrows, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which
  converges fluxes split by fructose-bisphosphate aldolase. The flux-converging metabolites
  categorize Jy into four types, denoted as JA, JB, JC, and JD, where each subscript
  indicates the number of flux-converging metabolites passed zero to three times,
  respectively, for the given flux from a carbon source. The subscript E, which specifically
  indicates that the flux has once converged into pyruvate, is placed next to subscripts
  of J, including A, B, C, or D. Each rectangle with different colors defines reaction
  groups that are likely on or off simultaneously, determined by genomic context analysis.
  The CxJy’s assigned by using a different pathway from a glucose for each reaction
  are partitioned by a slash.

  description: Schematic illustration of flux balance analysis with constraints of

    and flux-converging pattern analyses. (A) By considering protein–protein associations

    The binary variable, y, is 0 or 1. vj is the flux of reaction j and v1 and v2
    belong to the same group. vj,min and vj,max are lower and upper bounds for the
    flux of reaction j. (B) The flux ranges of the grouped reactions based on genomic
    context analyses were further constrained by flux-converging pattern analyses
    based on the carbon number of metabolites that participate in each reaction (Ca)

    (Jb), for instance glucose in this study. A metabolite could be split into different
