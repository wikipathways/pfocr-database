caption: Regulation of ethylene production, from left is class I, auto-inhibition
  and class II auto-catalytic and level of expression of ethylene receptors during
  ripening of pineapple fruit. In class I, during the basal level of ethylene production,
  ethylene response pathway does not occur as the negative regulator (CTR) is bound
  and activated by the ethylene receptors, which lead to subsequent degradation of
  EIN2, EIN3 and EIL1 through ubiquitination by SCP complex and 26 proteosome. In
  class II, the presence of the hormone will further induce its production, leading
  to ethylene spike observed during floral senescence and fruit ripening process.
  Most importantly, the binding of ethylene at its receptors will release and inactivate
  the CTR, promoting cleavage of carboxyl end of EIN2 to the nucleus and activate
  the nuclear transcription factor EIN3/EIL1 and ERF1, which induce the ethylene responsive
  genes. Two types of ethylene receptors have been identified at the ER lumen. It
  is hypothesized that non-climacteric fruits rely on type-II ethylene receptor, which
  binds to CTR more loosely compared with type-I. Thus, only minimal amount of ethylene
  required to release the negative regulator, CTR. On the left is the heatmap of the
  transcripts with homology to ethylene receptors. None of the ethylene receptors
  were differentially expressed, but one transcript with homology to ETR2, type II
  ethylene receptors was the highest expression in green mature fruit.
