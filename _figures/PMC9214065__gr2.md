caption: Overview of Notch signaling pathway. After Notch receptor and its ligand
  interact at the cell-to-cell surface, Notch receptor is cleaved twice by ADAM metalloprotease
  and γ-secretase. Notch ICD translocates into the nucleus, and then binds to the
  DNA binding protein CSL and recruits several co-activators to initiate Notch target
  genes transcription.
