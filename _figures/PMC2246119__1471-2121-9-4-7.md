caption: Working model for the interaction of AR and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway
  in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. In normal conditions, Wnt and androgen
  signaling function at different cell populations (A&B). In prostate cancer where
  both pathways may be deregulated in the same cells, androgens may inhibit the input
  of AR into the Wnt signaling pathway where β-Catenin can potentiate the AR signaling
  (C). In castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, Wnt can activate both signaling
  pathways turning the unliganded AR into a coactivator of the Wnt dependent transcriptional
  program (D).
