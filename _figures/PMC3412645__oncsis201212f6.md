caption: DNA damage signaling pathway in parental cells and 82FR-31NR cells. Radiation
  activates the p53 pathway to induce apoptosis in irradiated parental cells. On the
  other hand, the AKT/cyclin D1/Cdk4 pathway is activated by irradiation in 82FR-31NR
  cells. The AKT pathway facilitates DNA repair of radiation-induced DNA damage and
  promotes cell survival in 82FR-31NR cells after irradiation.

  description: DNA damage signaling pathway in parental cells and 82FR-31NR cells.
    Radiation activates the p53 pathway to induce apoptosis in irradiated parental
    cells. On the other hand, the AKT/cyclin D1/Cdk4 pathway is activated by irradiation
    in 82FR-31NR cells. The AKT pathway facilitates DNA repair of radiation-induced
    DNA damage and promotes cell survival in 82FR-31NR cells after irradiation.
