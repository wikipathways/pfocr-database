caption: Lipid metabolism overview in normal and cancer cells. Cancer cells acquire
  diet-derived FA through LPL, CD36, FATPs, and FABPpm. Glucose is converted to acetyl-CoA
  by glycolysis and on to citrate through the TCA cycle in the mitochondria. The citrate
  is transported to the cytoplasm and converted back to acetyl-CoA by citrate lyase,
  which is used as the carbon source for the growing acyl chains. The pentose phosphate
  pathway from glycolysis generates NADPH. Cancer cells also develop effective de
  novo FAS machinery with an increase in the activity of key lipogenic enzymes. The
  surplus lipids (including excess FAs and cholesterol) in a cell exist in the form
  of neutral, inert biomolecules in the core of LDs. ATGL catalyzes the initial step
  of lipolysis, converting TGs to DGs; HSL is primarily responsible for the hydrolysis
  of DGs to MGs, and MAGL hydrolyzes MGs into FFA and glycerol. CPT1, as an outer
  mitochondrial membrane enzyme, translocates FA across the mitochondrial membranes
  and then the degradation of long-chain FAs occurs in the mitochondria. Cholesterol
  homeostasis involves the interplay between de novo synthesis (mevalonate pathway),
  uptake of dietary cholesterol, and removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral
  tissues. 27-HC is the metabolite substrate of cholesterol by CYP27A1 enzymes. SREBP-1
  is activated through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
  pathway.

  description: Lipid metabolism overview in normal and cancer cells. Cancer cells
    acquire diet-derived FA through LPL, CD36, FATPs, and FABPpm. Glucose is converted

    The citrate is transported to the cytoplasm and converted back to acetyl-CoA by
    citrate lyase, which is used as the carbon source for the growing acyl chains.
    The pentose phosphate pathway from glycolysis generates NADPH. Cancer cells also
    develop effective de novo FAS machinery with an increase in the activity of key
    lipogenic enzymes. The surplus lipids (including excess FAs and cholesterol) in
    a cell exist in the form of neutral, inert biomolecules in the core of LDs. ATGL
    catalyzes the initial step of lipolysis, converting TGs to DGs; HSL is primarily
    responsible for the hydrolysis of DGs to MGs, and MAGL hydrolyzes MGs into FFA
