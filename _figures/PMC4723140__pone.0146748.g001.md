caption: Enzymatic reactions are marked by arrows. Blue arrows indicate specific glycolytic,
  red arrows specific gluconeogenic and black arrows enzymatic reactions for both
  glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Enzyme encoding genes in boxes are colored red or
  blue, respectively, to indicate up- or down-regulation in DUhTP compared to control
  DUC. Different colors in a box for the same gene indicate various probe sets with
  differing expression. Two mRNA transcripts (GCK, GOT1) with fold change >2 are colored
  in pale and dark magenta for up- or down-regulation, respectively.
