caption: Potential cellular mechanisms of skeletal muscle deconditioning in breast
  cancer patients. Through the analysis of clinical and pre-clinical studies related
  to all cancer’s types, several different pathways may be implicated in skeletal
  muscle deconditioning in breast cancer patients. Both the cancer per se and its
  treatment lead to increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and Myostatin/Activin
  A pathways (in orange), consequently decreasing protein synthesis (in blue) and
  increasing pathways implicated in protein breakdown (in green). The activation of
  the autophagy-lysosomal system needs to be elucidated as an increase in autophagosomes
  formation has been consistently found as well as increased levels of p62, suggesting
  that lysosome activity might be disrupted in cancer cachexia, leading to no change
  in autophagy flux (green dotted line). The combination of high levels of inflammatory
  cytokines, ROS and mitochondrial altered dynamics, biogenesis and function (in purple)
  would also lead to increased protein breakdown and apoptosis. On the other hand,
  it would also lead to high levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress, resulting in
  an increase in the UPR system (in brown) and consequently protein breakdown. The
  involvement of the PERK/eiF2α/ATF4 pathway, known to be implicated in non-cancer
  models of muscle atrophy, needs to be clarified, as it might surprisingly be necessary
  to counteract muscle atrophy in cancer-related models of muscle atrophy (brown dotted
  line). Moreover, different studies also highlighted a reduction in the number of
  satellite cells (SCs), their capacity to differentiate and skeletal muscle capacity
  to regenerate, emphasizing that cancer-related muscle atrophy may also result from
  muscle altered repair/regrowth (in red). Finally, increased presence of fibro-adipogenic
  progenitors might also be implicated in muscle deconditioning as they are implicated
  in both IL-6-mediated muscle atrophy (in non-cancer models of muscle atrophy) and
  Intermuscular adipose tissue development (in gray). Altogether, these cellular mechanisms
  might play an important role in breast cancer-related skeletal muscle deconditioning
  and clearly need to be further investigated through clinical studies using muscle
  biopsies. MAM, mitochondria-associated ER membranes.
