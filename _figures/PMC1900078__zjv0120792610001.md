caption: The reverse transcription pathway of HBV. (A) The pgRNA (thin black line)
  is the template for synthesis of minus-strand DNA. pgRNA is greater than genome
  length, so the termini are redundant (∼110 nt). DR1 and DR2 are 11-nt direct repeat
  sequences (open boxes), and there are two copies of DR1 due to its location in the
  terminal redundancy. The stem-loop, ɛ, is indicated. P protein forms a complex with
  ɛ, and the two are coencapsidated into a newly formed nucleocapsid. DNA synthesis
  takes place within the nucleocapsid. P protein acts as primer and polymerase to
  initiate the synthesis of minus-strand DNA. First, the first 3 (or 4) nt are synthesized
  using the bulge of ɛ as the template. (B) The nascent minus-strand DNA switches
  template to complementary sequence within DR1, and the synthesis of minus-strand
  DNA resumes. RNase H activity of P protein degrades the pgRNA as minus-strand DNA
  is synthesized. (C) The SS DNA intermediate contains a complete minus-strand DNA,
  and the 5′ portion of the pgRNA is not digested. This short RNA (∼17 nt) serves
  as the primer for the initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis. (D) In the major
  pathway, the RNA primer switches template from DR1 to DR2 in a process termed primer
  translocation. Plus-strand DNA synthesis initiates from DR2. (E) When the nascent
  plus-strand DNA has extended to the 5′ end of the minus strand, it switches template
  from 5′r to 3′r in a process termed circularization. (F) The plus-strand DNA is
  extended from 3′r to subsequently form the mature RC DNA genome. (G) In the minor
  pathway, the RNA primer is used to initiate plus-strand DNA synthesis from DR1 in
  a process termed in situ priming. (H) The mature DL DNA genome results from fully
  elongated plus-strand DNA primed at DR1.

  description: The reverse transcription pathway of HBV. (A) The pgRNA (thin black
