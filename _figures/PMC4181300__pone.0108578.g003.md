caption: 'Green color represents pPROM specific functions, blue- genes associated
  with both sPTB and pPROM and yellow-functions specific for sPTB. Ovals- links projected
  from ‘Functions and diseases’ (Fx) and ‘Biomarkers’ (Bm) categories of IPA’s knowledge
  database. Lines correspond to functional (arrows) or physical interactions (lines)
  between proteins. An arrow indicates a regulatory vector. Solid lines imply direct
  relationships between proteins, dotted lines imply indirect interactions. Relationships
  include post-translational modifications, transcription regulation, proteolysis
  or co-expression. The blue lines indicate the NfkB area of influence. Different
  node shapes represent the following: complexes or unknown (an example is NfkB),
  cytokines and growth factors (as for CSF1), enzymes (NOS3), peptidases (MMP1), transcription
  regulators (TP53).'
