caption: 'Lung adenocarcinoma treatment and emerging therapeutic potential of targeting
  macrophages. Diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma patient requires at first magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) or positron-emission tomography scan (PET-scan). Tumor biopsies
  were also performed to further characterize the histology of the tumor and to determine
  the cancer cell’s origin, the disease progression, and the expression of PD-L1 among
  other features. Oncogenic mutations driving lung adenocarcinomas were screened,
  of which V-KI-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations were the most frequent. These different
  diagnoses allow personalized treatment options with targeted oncogenic pathway inhibitors
  and/or chemotherapy. Immunotherapy is highly patient-dependent since the treatment
  with a checkpoint inhibitor that targets the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway requires tumors
  expressing levels of PD-L1 higher than 50%. These therapies are generally not exclusive
  and different strategies are employed for a better healing without remission. Novel
  potential therapies are aimed at targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).
  Whether or not IL-1β inhibitory antibody (Canakinumab) targets macrophages, its
  use on patients with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels higher than 2 mg/L reduced
  the rate of lung cancer. Composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) may allow
  patient stratification. For instance, lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), a prognostic
  factor and a predictor survival, could be modified with CCR2 inhibitors (PF04136309
  or CCX872) or with CCL2 inhibitors (CNTO888), preventing the recruitment of circulating
  Ly6Chi monocytes into tumors. To limit the conversion of tissue-resident macrophages
  (i.e., alveolar macrophages AMs and interstitial macrophages IMs) into TAMs, blocking
  antibodies anti-CSF-1R (IMC-CS4 or AMG820) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (PLX3397,
  BLZ945 or JNJ-40346527) are used. Cancer cells express CD47 on their surface, known
  to be a “don’t eat me” signal and recognized by SIRP1α expressed on macrophages,
  which triggers a cascade of events that inhibit phagocytosis: anti-CD47 (Hu5F9-G4
  or CC90002) or competitive recombinant SIRP1αFC (TTI-621 or ALX148) are developed
  as a way to reeducate TAMs for eliminating cancer cells. As for T-cells, TAMs also
  express the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, inducing immune tolerance and TAMs
  PD-1 expression reduced the phagocytic potency against tumor cells. Immunotherapy
  with the use of αPD-1 not only targets PD-1/PD-L1 pathway on T-cells but is efficient
  to reactivate phagocytic potency of macrophages. However, TAMs could limit anti-PD-1
  therapeutic benefits by stealing and capturing αPD-1 antibody from the CD8+ T-cells
  via FcγRIIb/III receptors unless if αFcγRs antibodies are administrated before.
  Another way to reeducate TAMs is to convert M2-like macrophages to an antitumor
  phenotype in targeting MARCO (αMarco Ab) or in inhibiting histone deacetylase (TMP195)
  to reprogram macrophage-dependent T-cell immune responses. Rebastinib reduced cancer
  cell metastasis by inhibiting a specific Tie2+ TAMs population implicated in the
  angiogenic switch.'
