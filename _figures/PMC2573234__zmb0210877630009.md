caption: Positive feedback loops governing fatty acid-lipoic acid biosynthesis and
  RNase P activity. The intersection of the FAS II pathway and RNase P activity in
  yeast mitochondria is depicted as a cartoon. In the FAS II pathway, acetyl-CoA (or
  acetyl-acyl carrier protein [ACP]) and malonyl-ACP are condensed on ACP, and the
  carbon chain is elongated in several iterative steps to produce octanoic acid ()
  (Fig. ). Other enzymes convert octanoic acid to lipoic acid () and attach the cofactor
  to target proteins (). Lipoic acid is required for pyruvate dehydrogenase activity,
  creating one positive feedback loop. Fatty acid and/or lipoic acid is required for
  efficient RNase P activity. The second positive feedback loop is created because
  RNase P activity is required for the maturation of its own RNA subunit, RPM1, via
  an endonucleolytic cleavage of tRNAPro from the pre-RPM1-pro precursor RNA. The
  dashed arrows represent the requirement of lipoic acid for PDH, α-KDH, and GC enzymatic
  activity. The dotted arrow (at right) represents the requirement of a product of
  the FAS II pathway for RNase P activity or assembly.
