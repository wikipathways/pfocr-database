caption: The NRF2 signalling pathway. Under basal conditions, a KEAP1/CUL3/RBX1 complex
  binds to NRF2 and promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.
  In addition, NRF2 can be regulated via glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) mediated
  phosphorylation, which promotes ubiquitination of the transcription factor by a
  β-TrCP/CUL1/RBX1 complex. Upon activation of NRF2 by electrophiles, reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and other stimuli, NRF2 evades these repression mechanisms, accumulates
  in the nucleus, and modulates the expression of several hundred cytoprotective genes
