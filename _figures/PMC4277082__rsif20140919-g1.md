caption: Understanding entropy. Thermodynamic entropy refers to the spreading of energy
  within an inanimate matter—solid, liquid or gas. The quantity describes the number
  of accessible energy states within the aggregate. The molecules in a solid occupy
  a fixed position and the number of accessible energy states is small. A solid has
  low entropy. The molecules of a gas enclosed within a container are free to move
  about and have access to a large number of energy states. A gas has high entropy.
  Evolutionary entropy refers to the diversity of pathways within a metabolic network.
  The quantity describes the number of accessible pathways of energy flow. Glycolysis
  has a simple pathway of energy flow and the rate at which energy is taken from the
  environment and reinvested into metabolic activities is low, giving it low evolutionary
  entropy. By contrast, oxidative phosphorylation has several distinct pathways of
  energy flow and includes a large number of interacting enzymes. The rate at which
  energy precursors are reinvested in metabolic activity is high. Thus, OxPhos has
  high evolutionary entropy. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  AcetylCo-A, acetyl coenzyme A; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; NADH, nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide; ATP, adenosine triphosphate. (Online version in colour.)
