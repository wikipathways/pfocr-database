caption: Oxidative stress formed by a number of disorders or external factors such
  as chemical drugs, heat stress, and so on could induce both extrinsic and intrinsic
  apoptotic pathways []. However, during abnormal conditions, endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress could also activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [], leading to cell
  death. On the other hand, disruption of Bax/Bcl-2 balance by mitochondrial dysfunction
  leads to ROS elevation []. Afterward, ROS activate the NF-κB signaling pathway,
  subsequently increasing the release of inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, antioxidant
  sources-such as curcumin-could decrease ROS production and cell death rate, finally.
  In this regard, curcumin via activating the Nrf2 pathway could increase the levels
  of cellular antioxidants [,], such as SOD, GPx, and CAT, and by activating the expression
  of HO-1 (Heme Oxygenase-1), as an Nrf2-regulated gene which is involved in the prevention
  of vascular inflammation, could directly or indirectly decrease the generation of
  ROS as well as inflammation [,]. On the one hand, it has been reported that curcumin
  via activating the ERK and MAPK could ease the oxidative damage [,].
