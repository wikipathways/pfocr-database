caption: Chronic iAs exposure inhibits ATM activation (ATM-pSer1981) and downstream
  ATM signaling (measured by CHEK2-pThr68). Reduction of CHEK2 activation (CHEK-pThr68)
  may lead to reduced downstream signaling which mediates cell cycle checkpoints required
  for DSB repair prior to cell division. Chronic iAs exposure may reduce ATM activation
  by inhibition of MRN activity (dotted inhibitory line) which is required for initial
  ATM activation. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and 5 (PP5) are required for ATM dephosphorylation.
