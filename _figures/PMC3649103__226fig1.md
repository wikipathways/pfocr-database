caption: Hepatic glucose metabolism. Of an ingested glucose load, 20% is metabolized
  by the liver. Under the action of insulin, glycogen synthase is increased, and the
  majority of the glucose load is stored as glycogen. Although insulin activation
  of sterol response element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) activates the lipogenic
  pathway, there is little citrate formed to act as a substrate for lipogenesis. In
  addition, insulin action on the liver phosphorylates forkhead protein O1 (FoxO1),
  excluding it from the nucleus, and suppressing the enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis
  (GNG). ACC, acetyl CoA carboxylase; ACL, ATP citrate lyase; ACSS2, acyl-CoA synthetase
  short-chain family member 2; ApoB, apolipoprotein B; ChREBP, carbohydrate response
  element binding protein; CPT-1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1; FAS, fatty acid
  synthase; Glut2, glucose transporter 2; Glut4, glucose transporter 4; Glut 5, glucose
