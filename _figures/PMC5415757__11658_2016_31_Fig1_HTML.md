caption: The interactions of p62 and the UPS, autophagy and ubiquitinated proteins.
  Upon UPS inhibition, p62 is upregulated and phosphorylated on S405 and S409, which
  can facilitate the degradation of ubiquitinated cargoes via autophagy. p62 synthesis
  is induced by an increase in Nrf2 following UPS deficiency. The increased p62 competes
  with Nrf2 for Keap1, and then a p62–Keap1 complex selectively facilitates the ubiquitinated
  aggregate formation and creates a positive feedback loop with Nrf2. HDAC6 can be
  activated by the products in UPS (such as K63), but inhibited directly by p62. HDAC6
  plays a critical role in ubiquitinated aggregate formation and autophagosome–lysosome
  fusion, while a ratio of p62 to HDAC6 maintains the homeostasis of autophagic process.
  Besides inhibiting the degradation of p62 and ubiquitinated proteins, a deficiency
  in autophagy also compromises UPS since the increased p62 delays ubiquitinated protein
  delivery to UPS for degradation. p62 overexpression increases the aggregation of
  ubiquitinated proteins and has a protective effect on cell survival, while p62 deletion
  exacerbates cell injury and relates to some diseases by either facilitating or damaging
  autophagic degradation dependent on the cell type
