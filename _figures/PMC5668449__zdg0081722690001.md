caption: Beneficial and detrimental role of adenosine A2Bsignaling in normal individuals
  and SCD patients. Hypoxia-induced adenosine A2Bsignaling activates AMPK and Sphk1.
  The former activates 2,3-BPG, generating enzyme BPG mutase, whereas the latter promotes
  glycolysis. Together, both in high-altitude and in SCD, adenosine A2B activation
  increases erythrocyte 2,3-BPG levels and in turn increases O2 release. In normal
  erythrocytes, this pathway helps release more O2 to counteract tissue hypoxia and
  injury, whereas, in SCD erythrocytes, this pathway leads to more sickling and disease
  progression. RBCs, red blood cells.
