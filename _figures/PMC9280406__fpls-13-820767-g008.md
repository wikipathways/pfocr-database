caption: Models showing the role of BcSpd1 in plant–B. cinerea interaction. (A) B.
  cinerea BcSpd1 is involved in regulating genes in fungal growth, development, secondary
  metabolism, pathogenicity, and anti-microbe plant metabolism degradation. (B) ΔBcSpd1
  recovered from host defense by upregulating many genes in the hormone pathway, transcription
  factors, and defense-related secondary metabolism biosynthesis.
