caption: Adverse effect of melatonin on the AR pathway. (1) The AR pathway. Androgen
  triggered the dissociation of AR and HSPs. AR and androgen formed complexes and
  were transported into nuclear. Nuclear AR complexes bound to the ARE region of hormone-dependent
  genes to start the transcription. (2) Melatonin mediated the AR nuclear exclusion
  via a Gi/cGMP/Ca2+/PKC pathway. Melatonin stimulated Gi protein to enhance the production
  of cGMP. cGMP induced the intracellular flux of Ca2+. Ca2+ activated PKC and PKC
  promoted the nuclear exclusion of AR. RGS proteins (RGS4, RGS10) exerted adverse
  effects on this pathway. (3) The potential involvement of Gq protein in AR nuclear
  exclusion. Melatonin activated phospholipase C (PLC) to generate inositoltriphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) which contributed to the intracellular flux of Ca2+.
  Activated Gq protein presumably stimulated PLC or (PLD) to promote AR nuclear exclusion,
  and the process was inhibited by RGS4
