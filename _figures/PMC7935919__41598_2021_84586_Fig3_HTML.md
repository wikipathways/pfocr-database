caption: Schematic illustration showing altered coagulation pathway proteins in polycystic
  ovary syndrome (PCOS). Cellular stimulation factors and proteins involved in blood
  coagulation pathways [intrinsic (top left), extrinsic (top right) and fibrinolytic
  system (bottom left)] are illustrated. Proteins increased in women with PCOS are
  indicated by upward red arrows (labelled ‘PCOS’) with the protein decreased in PCOS
  (prothrombin) indicated by a downward red arrow. Red dotted lines indicate the inhibitory
  actions of the proteins in blood coagulation pathways.
