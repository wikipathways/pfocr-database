caption: Biosynthetic pathway for astaxanthin engineered in S. cerevisiae. This pathway
  shows systematic astaxanthin biosynthesis from the mevalonate pathway in S. cerevisiae,
  into which the carotenogenic genes from X. dendrorhous shown in parentheses and
  bacteria were introduced. The endogenous genes of S. cerevisiae are underlined.
  The black, white, and gray thick arrows indicate the reactions catalyzed by the
  enzymes encoded by crtW, crtZ, and crtS, respectively. Although the crtS-mediated
  biosynthesis of astaxanthin has been poorly understood, the pathway proposed by
  Andrewes et al. () is shown in this figure. DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate;
  FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate.
