caption: Schematic diagram of the autophagy process. ① Autophagy is regulated by TOR
  kinase. Inhibition of TOR results in activation of constitutive autophagy, while
  overexpression of TOR blocks autophagy. Autophagy is initiated by the association
  of ATG13 and ATG1, together with ATG11 and ATG101, into an active complex. ② Autophagosome
  formation includes membrane delivery, vesicle nucleation and phagophore expansion
  and closure. ATG9, with ATG2 and ATG18, is involved in the delivery of lipids to
  the expanding phagophore. The VPS34 lipid kinase complex generates PI3P decoration,
  which is accompanied by the conjugation of ATG8 to PE. ATG8 firstly is matured by
  cleavage of its C-terminal by ATG4, and then is conjugated to PE by E2-like ATG3
  and the E3-like ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 complex. ATG8-PE localizes to the autophagosomal
  membrane for phagophore expansion. ③ Selective autophagy is mediated by interaction
  of ATG8 with specific autophagic receptors through the AIM domain. Different cell
  components can be recognized by specific autophagic receptors. For instance, the
  C1 protein is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and binds to ATG8 for
  degradation. The whole chloroplast is ubiquitulated by PUB4 and binds to ATG8. The
  fragments of chloroplasts are recognized by CHMO1 or ATI1/2 for degradation by RCBs
  or ATI1/2 decorated plastid bodies. In plants, peroxisomes to be degraded are probably
  recognized by PEX6 or PEX10, and the ubiquitylated proteasome is recognized by RPN10.
  ④ The mature autophagosome is transported to the vacuole with the help of FYVE and
  FYCO proteins and fused with the vacuole to be degraded.
