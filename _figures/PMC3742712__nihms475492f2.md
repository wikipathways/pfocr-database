caption: Canonical inflammasomes are cytosolic platforms that activate caspase-1 in
  response to pathogen- or danger- associated molecular patterns. Activation of caspase-1
  leads to secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, and pyroptosis. Two domain structures for
  inflammasome initiator proteins are known. 1) NLRs contain a signaling domain (PYD
  or CARD), a nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD/NACHT), and a leucine
  rich repeat (LRR) domain. 2) AIM2 contains a PYD signaling domain and a DNA-binding
  HIN-200 domain. AIM2 detects cytosolic DNA. NLRP3 detects multiple agonists such
  as extracellular ATP, bacterial pore-forming toxins, monosodium urate crystals,
  and cholesterol crystals. NLRC4 detects cytosolic flagellin or T3SS components that
  have been injected into the cytosol. The NLR or AIM2 signaling domains (PYD or CARD)
  bind to ASC by homotypic interactions, triggering formation of the ASC focus, which
  recruits procaspase-1, leading to its activation and processing. The ASC focus also
  recruits procaspase-8, initiating an apoptotic pathway. NLRC4 can additionally interact
  directly with caspase-1, resulting only in pyroptosis. The platform(s) that activate
  caspase-11 in response to cytosolic bacteria remain unknown. Caspase-11 triggers
  pyroptosis directly, and can also activate the canonical NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 inflammasome
  pathway leading to IL-1β and IL-18 processing (denoted by the long curved arrow
  to NLRP3).
