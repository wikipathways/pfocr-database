caption: Striped view of multiple data types. (A) Transcription and splicing data,
  collected on whole-genome exon tiling microarrays (see supplemental methods), are
  represented by stripes of color on a functionally organized list of monoamine G-protein-coupled
  receptors. Transcriptional changes for 11 different human tissues are displayed
  as the center color of the gene box, and splicing for the gene across all tissues
  is displayed as the rim color. (B) In the context of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis,
  mRNA and protein levels change in response to carbon source perturbation in Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae growing on galactose or ethanol. The color on the left side of the gene
  box illustrates mRNA changes; the color on the right indicates corresponding protein-level
  changes. (C) A variety of SNP parameters can be viewed simultaneously using the
  striped view. SNP distribution (dbSNP ), structure-based functional predictions
  (LS-SNP ), and myocardial infarction (MI) association data are combined to asses
  the coverage of the SNP panel over a pathway depicting the role of statin drugs.
  To view the complete versions of these MAPPs with live backpages see Supplemental
  Data.
