caption: Schematic representation summarizing the effects of exposure to hydrocodone
  overdose on the mGluR5-nNOS-ERK pathway and GLT-1, xCT, and RAGE expression in the
  NAc. Exposure to hydrocodone overdose may increase synaptic glutamate release, resulting
  in an increase in extracellular glutamate concentrations. Under a hyper-glutamatergic
  state, mGluR5 and NMDAR are overstimulated, thereby increasing intracellular calcium
  and subsequently upregulating nNOS activity. Activation of nNOS activity can lead
  to inhibition of the downstream ERK signaling pathway. Additionally, exposure to
  hydrocodone overdose is associated with an increase in the inflammatory response,
  such as upregulation of RAGE. Ceftriaxone treatment attenuates hydrocodone-induced
  mGluR5-nNOS-ERK pathway activation, glutamatergic system dysregulation, and RAGE
  upregulation. (Blue arrows indicate the downstream pathways; Red arrows indicate
  upregulation or downregulation of all target proteins or markers)
