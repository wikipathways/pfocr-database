caption: The insulin and leptin-melanocortin signaling pathway is responsible for
  maintaining energy and metabolic balance by controlling appetite. The melanocortin-4
  receptor (MC4R) encoded by the MC4R gene binds to peptide hormones (α-MSH or AgRP)
  secreted from either α-MSH or AgRP expressing neurons, respectively, present in
  the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Studies indicate that MC4R gene variants
  interact with the diet by increasing preference for a specific nutrient (fat) and
  decreasing satiety to promote increased weight gain. AgRP, agouti-related peptide;
  POMC, proopiomelanocortin; α-MSH, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone.
