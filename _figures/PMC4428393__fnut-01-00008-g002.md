caption: Cytoplasmic folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is required for de novo
  purine, thymidylate, and methionine synthesis. Cellular methylation potential is
  dependent on the production of S-adenoyslmethionine (AdoMet), the major methyl donor
  in the cell. Methionine is generated when homocysteine is remethylated. A methyl
  group can be transferred from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (THF) by methionine synthase
  (MS). 5-methylTHF is produced by methylene THF reductase (MTHFR) from the folate
  metabolic pathway. In the liver and kidney, homocysteine can also be remethylated
  by betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), a reaction that depends on choline-derived
  betaine as the methyl donor (not shown). Methionine is converted to AdoMet, from
  which methyltransferases (MT) transfer methyl groups to acceptor molecules. Acceptor
  molecules include DNA, RNA, histones and other proteins, and other small molecules.
  The reaction produces S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) that can be converted to homocysteine.
  TS, thymidylate synthase; MTHFD1, methylene THF dehydrogenase 1.
