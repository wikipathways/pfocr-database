caption: Cross-talk interaction between the sphingolipid and sphingofungin biosynthetic
  pathways in Aspergillus fumigatus. (A) Schematic representation of the sphingofungin
  pathway and localization of the involved biosynthetic enzymes—cytosolic (blue),
  vesicular compartments (orange), and both locations (green). (B) Schematic representation
  of the biosynthesis of ceramide, the relevant precursor of sphingolipids. SphB,
  polyketide synthase; SphA, aminotransferase; SphF, 3-ketoreductase; SphH, cytochrome
  P450 monooxygenase; SphC, monooxygenase; SphE, acyl transferase; CoL, acyl-CoA ligase;
  SPT, serine palmitoyl transferase; KR, 3-ketoreductase; CerS, ceramide synthase
