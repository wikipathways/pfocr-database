caption: MZp immune functions and how they can be affected in the HIV context. MZps
  possess a strong Breg potential, as attested by the expression of several immunoregulatory
  molecules. Indeed, MZps express CD39 and CD73, which will convert the extracellular
  ATP into ADO. This molecule will then be uptaken by purinergic receptors such as
  A2A, which will induce cAMP accumulation in the cytosol and the activation of the
  CREB pathway. CREB will induce the expression of CREB-induced elements such as the
  NR4A molecules and IL-10, which will allow for the maintenance of a regulatory phenotype.
  The NR4As will then induce the expression of even more immunoregulatory molecules
  such as CD83 and PD-L1, while also impeding unwanted cell activation by the BCR
  or the TLR. However, this homeostasis is heavily altered in the HIV context due
  to the chronic inflammation, excess BAFF and viral proteins. For instance, MZ B-cells
  are able to class-switch following CD40 engagement and subsequent NF-kB pathway
  activation. However, in the HIV context, HIV Nef could impede this CSR. HIV gp120
  could activate B-cells by cross-linking DC-SIGN an action that is enhanced by BAFF.
  Excess BAFF could induce TACI-dependent CSR by activating the mTOR pathway, which
  intersects with the TLR pathway (also engaged due to HIV-mediated recognition by
  TLR7, expressed by MZ B-cells), lowering the MZ activation threshold. HIV proteins
  such as Vpr could also directly affect MZp immunoregulatory protein expression such
  as CD83. Thus, in the HIV context, MZps could possibly lose their immunoregulatory
  functions, become easily activated and produce poor-affinity antibodies, with possible
  auto-reactivity.
