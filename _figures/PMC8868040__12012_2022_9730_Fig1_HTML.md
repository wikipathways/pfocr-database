caption: The science of renin-angiotensin system in hypertension and cognitive impairment.
  Through different signaling pathways, Ang-II leads to specific effects on blood
  pressure (BP) regulation and hypertension-associated cognitive impairment. In general,
  Ang-II/AT1R pathway induces deleterious impact on cognitive function, promoting
  cognitive impairment, while the others exhibit protective effects at different levels
