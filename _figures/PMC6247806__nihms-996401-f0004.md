caption: Two important mechanisms by which P53 may inhibit angiogenesis in neoplasms
  are induction of the antiangiogenic protein, TSP1, and decreased expression of the
  pro-angiogenic protein, VEGF. After wild-type p53 transcriptionally up-regulates
  TSP1 in the tumor cell, the secreted TSP1 binds to and activates the endothelial
  surface receptor, CD36. Several proteins, including p59fyn, caspase-3 like proteases,
  and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), are then sequentially activated
  leading to apoptosis of the endothelial cell. Many of the mediators of the apoptotic
  signal transduction pathway downstream of p38MAPK have not yet been identified.
  A second mechanism by which p53 may inhibit angiogenesis is by decreasing the pro-angiogenic
  factor, VEGF. It is not clear whether down-regulation of the VEGF by p53 occurs
  at the transcriptional or at the post-translational stage. Pharmacological delivery
  of the p53 gene may result in the inhibition of angiogenesis by additional mechanisms
  (see section IIA).
