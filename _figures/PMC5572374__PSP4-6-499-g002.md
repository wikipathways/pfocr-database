caption: (a) Prior knowledge network (PKN) derived from public resources, including
  interactions connecting nodes which are measured (in blue) or perturbed (stimulated
  in green and inhibited in red) in the experimental data. The network was further
  expanded to include more components from the apoptotic pathway (p53, Caspase8, and
  Caspase 9) and Myc for the cell cycle activation and their regulation of Survival.
  Network layout is generated with Cytoscape. (b) Examples of logic rules used to
  convert the network to a logic model. All other nodes in the model with more than
  one input edge are modeled with a simple OR gate.
