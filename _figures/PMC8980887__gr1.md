caption: Parathyroid hormone (PTH)'s Primary Signaling Pathways in Osteoblastic Cells.
  PTH is a polypeptide containing 84 amino acids (AA). The peptide fragment essential
  for signaling (1–34 AA) are demonstrated in blue circles. PTH binds to PTH receptor
  (PTH1R), a G-protein coupled receptor, and activates adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase
  C (PLC). Adenyl cyclase activation then converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which now acts as a secondary messenger to
  activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA can directly interact with proteins on the
  lipid droplet membrane to trigger the breakdown of triglycerides to free fatty acids,
  or lipolysis. In addition to the cAMP/PKA pathway, PTH-PTH1R signaling triggers
  PLC hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol triphosphate
  (IP3). IP3 is now capable of signaling within the endoplasmic reticulum to release
  calcium stores, thereby altering the intracellular calcium flux that is critical
  for regulating mitochondrial function. Upon IP3 formation, diacylglycerol (DAG)
  is also formed and can act as secondary messengers, regulating protein kinase C
  (PKC) and protein kinase D (PKD), both of which are important for glucose and lipid
  metabolism. Although both pathways have been demonstrated in osteoblastic cells,
  it is likely that these pathways are also stimulated within other cell types which
  express PTH1R.
