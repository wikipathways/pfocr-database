caption: Pathways of DHT synthesis from adrenal DHEA. DHEA is converted by 3β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase/isomerase (3βHSD) to AD. In the conventional pathway, AD is first
  transformed to T (red arrow), which is then converted by SRD5A to DHT. In the alternative
  pathway, AD is the principal substrate for SRD5A and is converted to 5α-dione (blue
  arrow), a necessary precursor to DHT. Both 5α-dione and DHT are reversibly interconvertible
  by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3αHSD) to the other 5α-reduced steroids, androsterone
  (AST) and 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (Adiol), respectively.
