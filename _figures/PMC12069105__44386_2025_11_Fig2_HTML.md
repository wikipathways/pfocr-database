caption: (Left) Balanced agonists activate both the G protein and β-arrestin signaling
  pathways. (Middle) G protein biased agonists preferentially activate G protein signaling
  pathway(s). Sustained G protein signaling can affect cellular responses through
  second messenger signaling. (Right) β-arrestin biased agonists preferentially activate
  β-arrestin signaling pathways leading to distinct physiological outcomes. Figure
