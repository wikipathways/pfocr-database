caption: 'In cells expressing CDUPRT, 5-FC is transported into the cell where it is
  converted into 5-FU by the CD component of CDUPRT. UPRT subsequently converts 5-FU
  into FUMP which is further processed into FdUMP and FUTP which inhibit DNA synthesis
  and RNA function respectively, leading to apoptosis. Endogenous DPD degrades 5-FU
  into non-toxic β-Alanine, which ultimately becomes the rate-limiting step in the
  conversion of 5-FU to its toxic metabolites. In cells that do not express CDUPRT,
  5-FU toxicity is mediated by direct conversion to FdUMP via TK, leading to inhibition
  of DNA synthesis and apoptosis. In the absence of CDUPRT, 5-FC cannot be converted
  to 5-FU and may result in the inhibition of cell proliferation or cytotoxicity through
  an unknown mechanism. Thickness of arrows is reflective of the predominating pathway
  or effect. Abbreviation: CDUPRT; cytosine deaminase::uracil phosphoribosyltransferase,
  CD; cytosine deaminase, FUMP; 5-fluorouridine monophosphate, FdUMP; 5-fluorodeoxyuridine
  monophosphate, FUTP; 5-fluorouridine triphosphate, DPD; dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.'
