caption: Schematic of proposed signaling pathways by which the Tec kinases regulate
  JNK activation, actin polymerization, and cytokine expression in LPS-stimulated
  neutrophils. Exposure to LPS results in Tec kinase translocation to the plasma membrane
  and activation, which is in turn critical for JNK activation. The Tec kinases regulate
  actin assembly as well as MCP-1, IL-6, and partially TNF-α upregulation in response
  to LPS stimulation in a JNK-dependent manner. The Tec kinases also play a role in
  IL-1β and TNF-α synthesis in response to LPS stimulation via a JNK-independent pathway.
  Notably, although p38 plays an important role in LPS-induced neutrophil functions,
  including NF-κB activation, cell adhesion, and IL-8 synthesis, its activation is
  independent of Tec kinase activity.
