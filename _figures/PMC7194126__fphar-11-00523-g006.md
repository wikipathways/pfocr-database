caption: Presentation of a proposed mechanism for the neuroprotective role of ICS
  II against OGD/R-induced injury in primary hippocampal neurons. ICS II is thought
  to direct bind and inhibit PDE5, thereby elevating cGMP level and PKG activity.
  Then, cGMP promoted PKG/BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathways, thereby reducing neuronal apoptosis
  and assisting neuronal survival.
