caption: Anticancer agents target and interfere with the intrinsic and extrinsic signaling
  pathways. Upon treatment with tumor cells, anticancer agents induce ROS generation
  which eventually leads to damage of the mitochondrial membrane. Activated Bak/Bax
  results in mitochondrial permeabilization. Damaged mitochondrial membrane results
  in the release of cyt c, which triggers the activation of caspase-mediated apoptosis.
  Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress causes the discharge of calcium ions, which activates
  the m-calpain caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway. ER stress release activating transcription
  factor 6 alpha (Atf6-α) leading to apoptosis via activation of C/EBP homologous
  protein (CHOP). In the extrinsic pathway, the induction of death-inducing signaling
  complex (DISC) associated caspase 8 with the activation of apoptosis effector protein
  caspase 3 as well as BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein Bid to its active form tBid
  subsequently stimulates the multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax/Bak) to exhibit
  their activities.
