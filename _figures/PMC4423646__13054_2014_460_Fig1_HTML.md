caption: Ischemia/ reperfusion-induced and sepsis-induced endothelial dysfunction
  is initiated by increased amounts of reactive oxygen species. 1. Ascorbate reduces
  the production of superoxide (O2–), hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite (OONO–)
  by inhibiting the Jak2/Stat1/IRF1 signaling pathway, which leads to subunit p47phox
  expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH-ox) and
  thus to O2– formation. 2. Ascorbate protects against oxidative stress induced pathological
  vasoconstriction and loss of endothelial barrier by inhibiting tetrahydrobiopterin
  (BH4) oxidation, the cofactor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), thereby
  preventing endothelial nitric oxide (eNO) depletion and eNOS uncoupling. 3. Ascorbate
  inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and iNOS expression, preventing
  abundant production of nitric oxide (NO) that generates OONO– in the presence of
  O2–. 4. Ascorbate protects against vascular leakage by inhibiting protein phosphatase
  2A (PP2A) activation, which dephosphorylates occludin. Phosphorylated occludin is
  crucial for maintenance of tight junctions. 5. Ascorbate inhibits myocardial apoptosis
  by preventing Bax activation, which decreases the ability of BCl-2 to inhibit cytochrome-C
  release from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and subsequent caspase-3 activation,
  which initiates apoptosis. The combination with vitamin E is synergistic. 6. Ascorbate
  inhibits microcirculatory flow impairment by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-induced
  intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) expression, which triggers leukocyte stickiness
  and sludging. cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate;
  GTP, guanosine triphosphate; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion; sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase.
