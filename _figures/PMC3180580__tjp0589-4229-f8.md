caption: 'In untreated rats, DOR activation in the VTA causes a postsynaptic decrease
  in GABAAR signalling that is probably mediated by PKC. In stressed rats, while some
  VTA neurons show this postsynaptic inhibition, in other neurons a different signalling
  pathway becomes active: DOR activation now increases GABAAR signalling through a
  PI3K-Akt pathway that probably causes the insertion of new GABAARs into the synapse.
  In ethanol-consuming rats a different DOR effect is dominant: presynaptic inhibition
  of neurotransmitter release. While in ethanol-consuming rats it appears that the
  GABA inputs to all VTA neurons develop this DOR-mediated inhibition of GABA release
  (), different subsets of VTA neurons express either the postsynaptic DOR augmentation
  or inhibition of GABAAR-mediated currents.'
