caption: 'mTORC1 signaling. mTORC1 is a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism,
  which mediates three major inputs from growth promoting signals such, for example,
  growth factors and insulin. mTORC1 directly phosphorylates and activates S6K1 and
  inhibit 4E-BP1, which leads to protein synthesis, cell growth and proliferation.
  mTORC1 is positively regulated by Akt-PRAS40 and negatively regulated by tumor suppressor
  complex TSC1/TSC2, which suppress activity of small GTPase Rheb. Rheb activity is
  positively regulated by mTCTP. TSC1/TSC2 activity is suppressed by inhibitory phosphorylation
  of TSC2 by PI3K-dependent Akt, ERK1/2 and ERK1/2-dependent RSK1. PI3K is activated
  by multiple inputs such as growth factors and insulin, which leads to recruitment
  of PI3K to the membrane and its binding IRS-1. Active PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate
  (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which leads to PDK1-dependent
  phosphorylation of Akt followed by activation of mTOR in the mTORC1 complex. mTOR
  is part of two distinct complexes: the rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 consisting of
  mTOR, raptor and adaptor protein GβL, an upstream activator of S6K1, and the rapamycin-insensitive
  mTORC2, consisting of mTOR, rictor and GβL. mTORC2 directly phosphorylates Akt,
  which is necessary for full Akt activation. In contrast, hyperactivated S6K1 inhibits
  IRS1-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (the feedback loop). Tumor suppressor PTEN antagonizes
  PI3K-Akt signaling by specifically dephosphorylating PIP3 to PIP2. TSC1/TSC2 activity
  is positively regulated by cellular energy: increase in AMP levels due to glucose
  or fatty acids depravation and other stresses leads to LKB1-dependent activation
  of AMPK; active AMPK directly phosphorylates TSC2 and primes TSC2 for its subsequent
  phosphorylation by GSK3, which leads to inhibition of mTORC1, inhibition of translation,
  protein synthesis and cell growth. Pink or blue coloring indicate signaling molecules
  which are either positively or negatively, respectively, regulate cell growth and
  proliferation. Arrows indicate functional enhancement; flat bars indicate functional
  suppression.'
