caption: Negative regulation between FoxO3a and EPS8 in EGF/PI3K/Akt pathway. EGF
  and its receptor conduct signal into the cell and EPS8 active PI3K/Akt pathway to
  phosphorylate FoxO3a. The phosphorylated FoxO3a translocate from the nucleus into
  the cytoplasm of the cell and loses its regulation of apoptosis, differentiation
  and DNA repair. In the nucleus, FoxO3a combines with the core promoter region of
  EPS8 and directly inhibits EPS8 expression, which forms a new negative loop of EGFR
  signaling pathway.
