caption: Inactivating mutations in PTCH or binding of Hh ligands to PTCH de-represses
  SMO thereby allowing its translocation onto the tip of the primary cilium leading
  to transcriptional activation of Gli1/2. Multiple ciliary proteins are involved
  in processing Hh signal transduction. Ciliary EVC/EVC2 forms a complex with SMO
  that in turn is tethered by a complex of EFCAB7 and IQCE anchoring the EVC-EVC2
  complex in a signaling microdomain at the base of the primary cilium. Activation
  and nuclear translocation of Gli1/2 involves dissociation of Gli1/2 from its endogenous
  inhibitor, SuFu. Kif7 cooperates with SuFu in catalyzing dissociation of the Sufu-Gli2
  complex. Inhibition of Hh binding to Ptch by robotnikinin or blocking of SMO activation
  by small molecules such as cyclopamine, itraconazole, vismodegib, LDE225, etc. inhibits
  Hh signaling and tumor growth. While ATO blocks translocation of Gli2 to the tip
  of cilia, GANT61 and GANT 58 inhibit Gli1/2 transcriptional activities. GliA, Gli
  activator.
