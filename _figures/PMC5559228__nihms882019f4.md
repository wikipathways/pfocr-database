caption: B cell development in the bone marrow begins with the first committed B cell
  lineage progenitors (pro-B cells) undergoing Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement.
  Pre-B cells expressing a properly rearranged Ig heavy chain form the pre- B cell
  receptor (pre-BCR) complex along with surrogate light chains, which stimulates pre-B
  cell expansion and Ig light chain gene rearrangement. The Ig heavy and light chain
  proteins then form surface IgM, at which point immature B cells are then tested
  for self-reactivity. Immature B cells with high self-reactivity undergo deletion
  or receptor editing, while B cells with low or no self-reactivity migrate to the
  spleen, where development continues (see ). Genetic disruption of mTOR, Raptor,
  and Fnipl lead to blocks in B cell development, as depicted. Also shown is the relative
  activity of the mTORC1 signaling pathway during early B cell development.
