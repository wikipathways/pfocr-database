caption: A model of TMEM166 regulation in MPP+-induced oxidative stress. TMEM166 mainly
  localizes in ER and partially in mitochondria. MPP+ binds to mitochondrial complex
  I and blocks the electron transfer of oxidative phosphorylation, leading to the
  production of ROS, which could eventually activate AMPK to promote cell survival.
  MPP+-induced cell oxidative stress could be divided into two stages. ① The first
  is the stage in which the generated ROS starts to damage the mitochondria and mitochondrial
  energy production decreases slightly. At this time, TMEM166 is up-regulated to promote
  mitophagy dependent on PINK1/Parkin to clear damaged mitochondria to maintain cell
  homeostasis. ② The second is that ROS has been generated enormously and the reduction
  in mitochondrial energy production has threatened cell survival. At this time, excessive
  TMEM166 in mitochondria will inhibit AMPK activation, causing mitochondrial dysfunction
  and oxidative stress aggravation. In this stage, more and more damaged mitochondria
  are produced and need to be cleared by mitophagy. The expression of TMEM166 is actually
  very high, but the rate of mitophagic/autophagic degradation exceeds the rate of
  its synthesis, causing its protein level to drop and AMPK activation to increase,
  which could promote mitochondrial biogenesis and produce more ATP, to maintain cell
  survival. In addition, activated AMPK promotes TMEM166 degradation, possibly through
  an AMPK-dependent autophagy/mitophagy pathway.
