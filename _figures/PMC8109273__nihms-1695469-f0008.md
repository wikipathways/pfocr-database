caption: (A) Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) expression in colonic biopsy tissue
  (for A and B, ANOVA Tukey HSD, n = 15, 8, and 8 time-point-averaged female biopsy
  transcriptomes for IBS-C, IBS-D, and HC, respectively). For full statistical results
  split by time point, see  (p = < 0.001 for IBS-C and IBS-D versus HC for biopsies
  from first time point (IBS-D versus HC FDR 0.018), from generalized binomial test).(B)
  Gene expression of human XDH in colonic biopsy tissue. For full statistical results
  split by time point, see  (p value 0.022 for IBS-C and 0.101 for IBS-D in time point
  1 and <0.005 for time point 2 (with IBS-C versus HC FDR <0.05), from generalized
  binomial test).(C) Simplified human-microbiome purine nucleotides degradation pathway
  with identified IBS-relevant changes indicated. Black arrows indicate metabolic
  steps, and yellow and blue up arrows indicate elevated expression or abundance in
  IBS.(D) Lasso correlation plot between hypoxanthine and PNP (FDR <0.001). Orange
  and blue points represent IBS-C and IBS-D subjects, respectively.(E) Metagenomic
  xanthine oxidase module abundance for all groups (also shown in  for IBS-C; IBS-C
  versus HC FDR <0.1, Mann-Whitney U test. n = 22, 29, and 24 averaged gut microbiome
  profiles for IBS-C, IBS-D, and HC, respectively).Boxplot center represents median
  and box IQR. Whiskers extend to most extreme data point <1.5 × IQR. Symbols indicate
  significance (*p = < 0.05, ^p = < 0.1, ^p = < 0.2).See also  and .
