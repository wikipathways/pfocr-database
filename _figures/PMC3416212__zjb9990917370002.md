caption: Pathway for serine, glycine, threonine, cysteine, and lysine biosynthesis
  and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in Dehalococcoides strain CBDB1 inferred from
  annotation of the genome and isotope labeling patterns. Colors indicate that the
  carbon was synthesized from the C-1 of acetate (green), from the C-2 of acetate
  (red), or from bicarbonate (blue). EC numbers in red mark genes that have not been
  annotated in CBDB1, so far.
