caption: 'Free energy profile (at 250 °C and 10 hPa) for the first half of the decomposition
  pathway. Here, 1 loses a triazene ligand (after TS-2), and one ligand decomposes
  into an imido ligand (TS-5). TS-3 has the largest free energy (211 kJmol–1) for
  the displayed part of the decomposition pathway. The overall largest free energy
  barrier is found at TS-8 (214 kJmol–1): the analogous step to TS-3 but for the last
  ligand. At 250 °C and 10 hPa, the adduct structures I-2A separate spontaneously
  (i.e., the process is barrierless and has a negative free energy difference) and
  is therefore not included.'
