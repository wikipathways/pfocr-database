caption: 'Multiple vesicular pathways deliver proteins to and from the vacuole. Resident
  vacuolar proteins are sent to the vacuole by several biosynthetic pathways, while
  proteins targeted for degradaton may be sent via endocytosis or autophagy. Biosynthetic
  pathways: The ALP pathway delivers cargo from the late Golgi to the vacuole. The
  CPY pathway also starts from the late Golgi, but traverses multivesicular bodies
  (MVBs) before reaching the vacuole. The CVT pathway delivers biosynthetic cargo
  from the cytosol to the vacuole in a process that has common components with autophagy.
  Trafficking pathways away from the vacuole may recycle membrane and proteins to
  the endocytic or CPY pathways. Degradative pathways: Endocytosis transports both
  soluble and membrane-bound cargo from the plasma membrane and extracellular space
  to the vacuole. Cargo progresses from early endosomes to late endosomes (multivesicular
  bodies) before reaching the vacuole. In macroautophagy, vesicles called autophagosomes
  engulf cytosolic material for degradation at the vacuole. In microautophagy, the
  vacuolar membrane itself forms invaginations which form vesicles that are then degraded
  at the vacuole.'
