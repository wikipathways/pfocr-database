caption: 'IL-6 signaling pathways: classical signaling via the JAK/STAT pathway, trans-signaling,
  trans-presentation, and intracellular signaling. Once IL-6 is produced, it binds
  to its specific membrane receptor, IL-6R (or CD126), inducing homodimerization of
  the signaling receptor component gp130 (or CD130) on the surface of cells such as
  hepatocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, activated B cells, and CD4 T cells (classic
  signaling). This homodimerization then activates cytoplasmic Janus kinases (JAKs:
  JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2), which phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic
  region of gp130. The downstream signaling molecules, signal transducer, and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3), STAT1, and SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase
  2 (SHP2) are recruited to the tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs of gp130. These signaling
  molecules themselves are then phosphorylated by the aforementioned JAKs and thus
  translocated to the nucleus, producing the transcriptional output. Similar to how
  IL-6 production is controlled by both stimulatory and inhibitory components, this
  is also the case with respect to regulating the IL-6 intracellular transduction
  signal. Specifically, STAT3 has been shown to have both a positive and negative
  effect on the transduction pathway. In one role, it stimulates negative feedback
  molecules, suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3 proteins. SOCS1
  binds to and inhibits JAK, while SOCS3 inhibits the Ras-MAP kinase pathway induced
  by SHP2. In another role, STAT3 induces Arid5a, which selectively binds to STAT3
  3′UTR and stabilizes the positive STAT3 signal. Thus, these molecules also provide
  a critical means of regulating the response to IL-6 and the prevention from pathologies
  associated with IL-6 dysregulation. IL-6 does not strictly follow the classic signaling
  pathway, as not all IL-6 receptors are membrane receptors. In a process called trans-signaling,
  IL-6 can bind to the soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R) in the serum. The IL-6/sIL-6R
  complex then activates gp130-expressing cells, even if cells lack membrane IL-6R.
  This may, in part, explain the pleiotropic effects of IL-6, given that gp130 is
  expressed in many more cells than those who express membrane IL-6R. Furthermore,
  cells expressing only IL-6R can present IL-6 to cells expressing only gp130 and
  activate the signaling pathway, in what is called trans-presentation. Lastly, extracellular
  IL-6 can be taken up by IL-6R and translocated to the endosomal compartment by endocytosis,
  where it activates gp130.'
