caption: PrPC may inhibit Bax-mediated apoptotic pathways at several different points,
  either by a direct interaction between the two proteins or by involvement of additional,
  intermediary proteins. PrPC on the cell surface (GPI-PrP) may bind to a putative
  transmembrane receptor, initiating a signal transduction cascade that culminates
  in inhibition of Bax mitochondrial translocation, conformational change, or oligomerization
  (A). Cytoplasmic forms of PrP may produce similar effects via a direct interaction
  with Bax (B). PrP may inhibit pro-apoptotic, BH3-only proteins (C), or enhance an
  interaction between Bax and anti-apoptotic, multi-domain proteins such as Bcl-2
  and Bcl-XL (D). PrP may suppress downstream events in the Bax pathway, such as cytochrome
  c (cyto. c) release, or activation of Apaf-1 and caspases (E). Finally, PrP in the
  ER may alter Bax function in this organelle, via effects on intracellular calcium
  and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (F).
