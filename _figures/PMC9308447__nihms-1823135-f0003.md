caption: Metabolism of (S)-nicotine and (S)-NNN by this pathway are similar, yet lead
  to drastically different results. The red atoms in the structures are the different
  functional groups that explain the results. For NNN, after 5'-hydroxylation by CYP2A6
  or CYP2A13, the properties of the N-N=O group in 5'-hydroxyNNN cause immediate transformation
  to the DNA damaging diazohydroxide intermediate illustrated, leading to DNA adducts
  and cancer. In contrast, the highlighted N-CH3 group of nicotine does not have this
  effect, but rather is further oxidized to the innocuous compound (S)-cotinine, which
  is stable and is excreted in urine. (Brackets indicate unstable intermediates).
