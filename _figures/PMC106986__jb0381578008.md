caption: Model of the Cpx and ςE regulons. The Cpx two-component system is activated
  by the synthesis of P-pilus subunits and the outer membrane lipoprotein NlpE. The
  inner membrane sensor CpxA phosphorylates its cognate response regulator, CpxR.
  CpxR-P stimulates transcription of the degP and dsbA genes. The periplasmic DegP
  and DsbA proteins are involved in proteolysis and disulfide-bond formation, respectively.
  An unknown signal transduction pathway (question mark) is postulated to monitor
  the level of P-pilin and other outer membrane proteins (OMP). This pathway is also
  proposed to stimulate ςE activity. Transcription from the fkpA, degP, rpoEp2, and
  rpoHp3 promoters requires ςE. The fkpA gene encodes a periplasmic prolyl isomerase,
  and rpoE and rpoH encode ςE and ςH, respectively. Reprinted from Genes and Development
