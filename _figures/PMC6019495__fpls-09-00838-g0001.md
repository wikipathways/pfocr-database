caption: ABA and GA metabolism and signaling/ABA is synthesized from carotenoids in
  a series of reactions in the plastids and cytoplasm (top left). ABA is catabolized
  to form phaseic acid. ABA transport occurs through different transporters, and ABA
  elicits distinct signaling cascades (in the nucleus and cytoplasm) (bottom left).
  GA biosynthesis starts from GGDP in the plastid and a portion of it is catabolized
  to inactive forms (top right). In the GA signaling pathway, GA causes destruction
  of DELLAs (negative regulator of GA) via the 26S proteasome machinery. The two signaling
  pathways crosstalk to regulate seed germination and abiotic stresses (bottom right).
