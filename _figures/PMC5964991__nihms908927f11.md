caption: Proposed mechanism of arundic acid-induced EAAT1 expression. Arundic acid
  activates intracellular signaling proteins, ERK and Akt, as well as the NF-κB pathway,
  leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In the nucleus, NF-κB binds to both consensus
  sites (-116 and -538) on the EAAT1 promoter, leading to the increased expression
  of EAAT1. Arundic acid also blocks Mn-induced repression of EAAT1 by inhibiting
  Mn-induced YY1 expression.

  transporter EAAT1 via the ERK, Akt and NF-κB pathways.
