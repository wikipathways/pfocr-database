caption: 'Translational pathway. The typical time, cost, relative number of publications,
  funding sources, and phases of the translational pathway for biomaterial-based therapies
  for cardiovascular disease are highlighted. ∗, number of studies in PubMed (preclinical)
  and ClinicalTrials.Gov (clinical) averaged per year for the past 5 years, using
  search terms “cell therapy,” “gene therapy,” “biomaterials,” “myocardial infarction,”
  and “peripheral artery disease.” The cost of each phase was drawn from [] for preclinical
  and clinical phases, [] for PAD market size, and [] for MI market size. Abbreviations:
