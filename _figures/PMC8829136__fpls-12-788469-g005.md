caption: Co-expression network of wounding-induced volatile formation. (A) Hierarchical
  clustering tree of DEGs based on WGCNA analysis. Each short black line (“leaf”)
  represents an individual gene. Different colored boxes below the hierarchical clustering
  tree represent genes with similar expression patterns, and these genes were clustered
  based on dissimilarity measures. Cut tree represents the cut height of the cluster
  tree; Merged dynamic represents further merge similar modules according to module
  eigengene. (B) Correlation heat map of four volatile substances and each module.
  Red and blue indicate high and low correlations, respectively. “*” indicates a significant
  correlation between the module and volatile substances (p < 0.05). The correlation
  value has been scaled. (C) Co-expression network diagram of candidate genes. The
  left side shows the TF-gene regulation network. When the weight value is greater
  than 0.5, we believe that there is a regulatory relationship between the candidate
  genes and TFs. The red dots represent the LOX, TSB, and TPS, respectively. The left
  side shows the KEGG undirected network diagram. The structural genes that have a
  potential relationship with candidate genes (weight value < 0.15) were chosen to
  construct a KEGG undirected network. The node size and color represents the number
  of genes enriched into the pathway. The larger purple node represents more genes
  in this pathway, and smaller yellow circles represent fewer genes.
