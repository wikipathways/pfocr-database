caption: Regulation of CHOP. The three signaling branches of UPR lead to CHOP transcription
  respectively. Once activated via dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation, PERK
  phosphorylates eIF2α, which enables ATF4 translation. Subsequently, CHOP is activated
  by ATF4 trafficking to the nucleus. In the presence of misfolded proteins, ATF6α
  translocates to the Golgi apparatus where it was processed by the protease SP1 and
  SP2, thus producing a cytosolic fragment ATF6f to regulate CHOP activation in the
  nucleus. Activation of IRE1α RNase domain processes unspliced XBP1 mRNA to create
  activated XBP1(s), which enters the nucleus and controls the expression of CHOP.
  Another pathway involves ISR. This response is initiated with GCN2, PKR, HRI, and
  PEAK that converge on the phospho-eIF2α/ATF4 pathway and CHOP induction ensues.
  A ROS-dependent mechanism also activates CHOP via MAPKs. CHOP, C/EBP homologous
  protein; UPR, unfolded protein response; ISR, integrated stress response; ATF, activating
  transcription factor; ATF6α, activating transcription factor 6α; PERK, PRKR-like
  ER kinase; XBP1, X box-binding protein 1; GCN2, general control nonderepressible
  2; PKR, RNA-dependent protein kinase; HRI, heme regulated inhibitor; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation
  initiator factor 2α.
