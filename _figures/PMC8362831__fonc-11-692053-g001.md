caption: High frequency MB mouse model Ptch1+/−/Tis21KO has a specific activation
  signature of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The picture shows the main components of
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, chiefly involved in cell growth, differentiation, migration
  and survival. Signaling is activated at the cell membrane by different growth factors
  and cytokines, and is propagated through PI3K and AKT to a range of downstream molecules,
  including mTOR, a key regulator of protein synthesis. Several factors may constitutively
  activate or inhibit this signaling pathway. The colored boxes, blue or red, highlight
  the genes differentially expressed in the pairwise comparison Ptch1+/−/Tis21KO versus Ptch1+/−/Tis21WT
  (see ), identified by microarray analysis of the GCPs isolated from mice at P7,
  previously performed by us (). The blue or red colors indicate down-regulated or
  up-regulated transcriptional expression, respectively. In Ptch1+/−/Tis21KO cells
  there is a model-specific activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, with extensive
  deregulation of the mRNA expression of upstream regulators as well as of the downstream
  targets. Arrows represent activation; bars represent inhibition. The stars indicate
  the potential drug targets, identified through the genomic analysis of deregulated
  Ptch1+/−/Tis21KO-dependent genes, as previously proposed (). AKT, AKR mouse thymoma
