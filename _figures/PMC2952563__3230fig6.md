caption: A scheme showing proposed metabolic pathways for CDCA in mice. The dark arrows
  indicate the major metabolic pathway. The number in the parenthesis indicates the
  average concentration of individual BAs in mouse livers. CDCA (1.6→36.0) means that
  CDCA was increased from 1.6 to 36.0 nmol/g in livers of male mice fed CDCA. BA,
  bile acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; CDCA7S, chenodeoxycholic acid 7-sulfate;
  GCDCA, glycochenodeoxycholic acid; LCA, lithocholic acid; αMCA, α-muricholic acid;
  MDCA, murideoxycholic acid; TCDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid; TDCA, taurodeoxycholic
  acid; TDCA7S, taurodeoxycholic acid 7-sulfate; TαMCA, tauro-α-muricholic acid; THCA,
  taurohyocholic acid; TMDCA, tauromurideoxycholic acid; TUDCA, tauroursodeoxycholic
  acid; UDCA, ursodeoxycholic acid.
