caption: Schematic representation of the VACV- and CPXV-stimulated PI3K/Akt pathway
  of biological relevance in spontaneously immortalized A31 and MEF cells. Upon attachment
  and/or penetration, VACV and CPXV activate Akt(S473-P) and Akt(T308-P) via mTORC2
  and PI3K/PDK1, respectively. Thus, Akt is fully activated and transduces signals
  associated with diverse biological activities to attend viral demands, such as cytoskeleton
  alterations, survival, translation release, and microtubule stabilization, which
  appear to benefit virus penetration, morphogenesis, and release, thereby increasing
  viral replication. Boxes highlight the biological consequences after pharmacological
  (LY294002, rapamycin, and Akt-X) and/or dominant-negative (DN-Akt) blockade of the
  pathways. Viral stimulation of both the PI3K/Akt pathway early during the infective
  cycle and the viral antiapoptotic genes is required to impede the demise of the
  cells, which is followed by an increase in virus titers. In contrast, upon the blockade
  of the pathway, the viral antiapoptotic genes alone are not sufficient to prevent
  the host cells from undergoing apoptosis, which is accompanied by a decline in virus
  yield.
