caption: Model of allosteric communication within the regulatory tandem GAF domains.
  The GAFab structural model for the cGMP- and Pγ-bound state () is shown with the
  major structural elements undergoing ligand-dependent conformational changes in
  the GAFa (red labels) and GAFb (orange labels). Pγ subunits are indicated by thick
  yellow and orange lines, while the catalytic domains are represented as light blue
  ovals based on the overall domain arrangement of rod PDE6 holoenzyme. Arrows indicate
  the proposed interactions that convey allosteric changes upon cGMP and/or Pγ binding,
  and gray spheres represent the sites of disease-causing mutations in human cone
  PDE6. See  for details.
