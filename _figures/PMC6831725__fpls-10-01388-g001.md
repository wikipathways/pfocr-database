caption: Model of exogenous melatonin-mediated post-harvest preservation mechanism
  in fruits and vegetables. (1) Blue lines and arrows indicate ROS elimination pathway.
  Melatonin acts psrimarily as a powerful free radical scavenger by increasing the
  content of antioxidant enzymes, non-enzymatic antioxidants, and the enzymes related
  to oxidative protein repair, removing excess active oxygen from post-harvest fruits
  and vegetables, and promoting GABA shunt pathway. Subsequently, the content of hydroxyl
  radicals and hydrogen peroxide decreases, the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation
  is reduced, thus protecting cells from oxidative damage and prolonging the shelf-life.
  (2) Green lines and arrows indicate pathogen response dependent pathway. Exogenous
  melatonin increases the levels of JA and SA, triggers plant pathogen responses,
  increases pathogen resistance, and extends the shelf life. (3) Orange lines and
  arrows indicate post-harvest decay of fruits and vegetables. Diseases or senescence
  of post-harvest fruits and vegetables produce lots of ROS, lead to lipid peroxidation,
  and cause post-harvest decay. Red arrows indicate increased levels of each component.
