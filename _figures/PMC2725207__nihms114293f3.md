caption: The loading of 9-1-1 at RPA-coated gaps, generated during NER of DNA damage,
  activates Mec1. The various types of phosphorylations by Mec1 are indicated with
  arrows, but not all targets are shown. The Ddc1-only bypass pathway of Mec1 activation,
  surrounded by a dotted line, is only operative at low salt in vitro and appears
  not to operate in the cell, unless Mec1 and Ddc1 are artificially colocalized by
  protein fusions []. Multiple Mec1-phosphorylated Rad53 proteins bind the mediator
  Rad9, and undergo transphosphorylation to complete full activation of Rad53. The
  S. cerevisiae factors are shown. Note that S. cerevisiae Rad9 is a mediator protein,
  and human Rad9 a clamp protein ().
