caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanisms through which norcantharidin (NCTD) reverses
  cisplatin resistance and inhibits the epithelial mesenchymal transition of human
  cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells via regulating the YAP pathway. NCTD may thus
  be an effective compound which may be used to reverse the resistance of human lung
  cancers to DDP by inhibiting YAP-induced anti-apoptotic effects, epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT), and proliferation and invasiveness.
