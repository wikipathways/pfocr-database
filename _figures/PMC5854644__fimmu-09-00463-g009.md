caption: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) related to the epigenetic control of genes involved in
  demyelination, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammation, pain, and
  loss of sensation were differentially expressed in leprosy patient (LP). Different
  pathways, including canonical and non-canonical pathways of TGF-β, may drive cell
  toward EMT, with a Schwann cell (SC) undifferentiated phenotype consisting of the
  absence of p75ntr, in gray, SOX10, with upregulated miRNAs in lepromatous (LL) and
  blockade by the SOX9 pathway, and the presence of CD44, which had downregulated
  miRNAs in LL. RHOA miRNAs were downregulated in LL, stimulating ROCK1 to drive EMT,
  inflammation and pain, which was controlled by upregulated miRNAs in all LP. AQP1,
  the only gene with upregulated miRNAs in blood in LP and downregulation in lesional
  skin, is one of the genes responsible for osmotic regulation. In lesions, downregulated
  miRNA for AQP1 indicated that AQP1 might not be expressed in the nerve, which was
  consistent with the upregulation of miRNAs for the MEF2C AQP1 transcription factor,
  possibly resulting in depolarization and calcium influx stimulating SIGMAR1, which
  also had downregulated miRNAs. The low expression level of SIGMAR1 may result in
  loss of sensation, but its overexpression may result in pain. Depolarization may
  stimulate RHOA to maintain a cycle of demyelination, inflammation, loss of sensation,
  and pain.
