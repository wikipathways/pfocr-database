caption: Structural replacement of LCBs and sterol in S. cerevisiae. The main structure
  of LCB in S. cerevisiae is phytosphingosine (PHS), while sphingosine (SPH), which
  is the main structure of LCB in mammals, is not biosynthesized. Furthermore, S.
  cerevisiae biosynthesizes ergosterol, whereas in mammals it is cholesterol. In SPH
  cells, the endogenous LCB biosynthesis pathway is completely lost, and SPH is supplied
  from outside the cell to synthesize Cers and complex sphingolipids, resulting in
  cells that have sphingolipids containing SPH [94,95]. In SPH/Chol cells, in addition
  to the structural substitution of LCB, the structure of sterol is also replaced
  by cholesterol [95]
