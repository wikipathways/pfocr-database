caption: Overview of the interrelationship between ROS and metabolic enzymes. Here
  we present the main ROS-producing systems, as well as the metabolic enzymes whose
  activity is modified by direct oxidation (see text for details). Brown arrows mean
  ROS production; red arrows mean inhibition; green arrows mean activation of target.
