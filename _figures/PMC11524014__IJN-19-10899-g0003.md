caption: 'Schematic of carbon dots in anticancer immunotherapy. This figure illustrates
  the diverse effects of carbon dots (CDs) in anticancer immunotherapy: CD-RTB promotes
  macrophage proliferation and enhances the release of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6
  (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α); CD-Al acts as an immunostimulant,
  activating macrophages to produce TNF-α and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β); CD-MSN enhances
  the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, adding value to their
  immune functions; CD-OVA boosts the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80
  and CD86 on dendritic cells (DCs), increases TNF-α production, and significantly
  stimulates splenocyte proliferation and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production; CD-MAN
  efficiently captures danger signals and transmits them to DC cells, thereby enhancing
  the immune response of antigen-presenting cells (APCs); CDTAC promotes DC maturation
  by inducing PD-L1 downregulation or activating the STING signaling pathway, resulting
  in increased secretion of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6; Ce6-IDCD maintains stable morphology
  and size at physiological pH and releases Ce6 at tumor pH, facilitating reactive
  oxygen species (ROS)-induced photodynamic therapy (PDT) mediated apoptosis, necrotic
  signaling, and an increase in CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and DC cells'
