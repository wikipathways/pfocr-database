caption: Transductional pathways associated with the activation of the 5-HT1AR overexpressed
  in non-neuronal cell lines. Signaling pathways of the 5-HT1A-R in CHO (cells derived
  from Chinese hamster ovary) and HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells are described.
  Activation of the receptor reduces cAMP levels through the inhibition of AC I, with
  a subsequent decrease in PKA activity; an effect mediated by Gαi/0. In contrast,
  co-expression of the receptor with AC II promotes an increase in the activity of
  this enzyme, increasing cAMP levels and PKA activation; effect mediated by βγ. The
  release of βγ after the activation of the receptor promotes ERK phosphorylation
  through two pathways, which involve the Ras-Raf-MEK and phosphatidylcholine-specific
  phospholipase C (PC-PLC) proteins. Moreover, the increase in ERK phosphorylation
  after the activation of the receptor promotes a reduction in caspase-3 activity;
  an effect mediated by the activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription
  factor. Additionally, the activation of the 5-HT1AR also activates the PI3K-Akt
  pathway, which participates in ERK phosphorylation.
