caption: Reduced glutathione (GSH) neutralizes H2O2 with the glutathione peroxidase
  enzyme, and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is reduced by NADPH and glutathione reductase
  to regenerate GSH. In the first pathway, glutamine-derived malate is transported
  out of the mitochondria, and is converted by malic enzyme 1 (ME1) to pyruvate, reducing
  one molecule of NADP+ to NADPH. In the malate-aspartate shuttle-related second pathway,
  found in mutant KRAS-transformed cells, aspartate that is produced from GOT2 mediated
  transamination of glutamine-derived oxaloacetate (OAA) is transported out of the
  mitochondria. Aspartate is then converted in the cytosol back to OAA by GOT1 and
  then to malate by malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1), which is in turn processed to pyruvate
  by ME1 to produce one molecule of NADPH . The fate of glutamine-derived pyruvate
  is similar to glucose-derived pyruvate in that much of it is expelled as lactate.
  α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; GOT, glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase.
