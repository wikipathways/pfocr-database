caption: 'Summary of metabolic pathways leading to terpenoid-associated volatile synthesis.
  The differently expressed KEGG enzymes between Temple and Murcott mandarin hybrid
  fruit are in red boxes. The second metabolites are presented in yellow boxes. Pathway
  names are presented in the blue box. In most cases, arrows indicate multiple enzyme
  reactions. Abbreviations: MEP, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate; MVA, mevalonate;
  IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethyl-allyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate;
  FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; Cstps1,valencene synthase.'
papertitle: Proteomic and metabolomic analyses provide insight into production of
  volatile and non-volatile flavor components in mandarin hybrid fruit.
