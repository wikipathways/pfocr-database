caption: The role of T-cell suppression and immune checkpoint blockage in tumor and
  organ rejection. Activation of a T cell via 3-signal pathway by an antigen presenting
  cell (APC) is illustrated. The donor cells are rejected when the T cells are activated.
  Therefore, the immunosuppressants, which inhibit CD3 (Anti-CD3 mAB), calcineurin
  (Cyclosporine or Tacrolimus), CD80/86 (CTLA4-Ig), IL-2 signaling (Anti-CD25 mAB),
  JAK3 (JAK3 inhibitor), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Sirolimus or Everolimus),
  and those interfere with the proliferative phase in the cell cycle (MPA, mycophenolate
  mofetil (MMF), azathioprine, and Fk778; not illustrated) are the key to successful
  post-transplantation outcomes. On the other hand, the employment of immune checkpoint
  inhibitors in transplant patients with cancer may increase the tumor killing while
  giving the chance for graft rejection. Therefore, fine-tuning the immunosuppressants
  and immune checkpoint inhibitors in transplanted patients with cancer is vital in
  achieving graft tolerance while treating cancer. APC, antigen presenting cell; CTLA4,
  cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4; IL-2, interleukin-2; IL-15, interleukin-15;
  JAK3, Janus kinase 3; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TCR, T-cell receptor; MHC
  I, major histocompatibility complex; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PD1, programmed
  cell death 1; PDL 1/2, programmed death-ligand 1/3.
