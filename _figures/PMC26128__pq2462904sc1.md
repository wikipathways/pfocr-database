caption: In the aerobic bacterium Pseudomonas denitrificans, the  biosynthetic pathway
  to vitamin B12, featuring an  oxygen-requiring step, has been established (for reviews,
  see refs.   and ), but it is now clear that a second, anaerobic route to corrin  has
  existed in nature for ca. 4 billion years (, ). Thus,  the obligate anaerobes, such
  as methanogenic bacteria, and the  semianaerobic Propionibacterium shermanii are
  able to  synthesize B12 by processes that differ at several pivotal  steps from
  the aerobic pathway. The Ps. denitrificans route  uses a two-stage ring contraction
  sequence on the metal-free substrate  precorrin-3, using O2 () to fashion γ-lactone
  and  tertiary hydroxyl functions at C-1 and C-20 in precorrin-3x (Scheme  ) as a
  prelude to a pinacol-like rearrangement, whereas  cobalt is inserted late, i.e.,
  not until all  S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-derived methyl groups are in  place
  and amidation of the carboxylates has begun (,  ).
