caption: Axon-Schwann cell (SC) interactions in health and disease. In the healthy
  peripheral nervous system (PNS) (left), myelinating and non-myelinating SC support
  axonal function by providing physical/electrical insulation in the form of myelin
  as well as metabolic support. One possible mechanism may involve the detection of
  axonal activity by neurotransmitter receptors (NR) on SC, followed by intracellular
  signaling and activation of glucose metabolism. Lactate, a by-product of glycolysis
  can be an important source of energy for both SC and axons and is shuttled by monocarboxylate
  transporters (MCT). Axon-glia interactions likely contribute to the maintenance
  of normal sensorimotor function and transport of molecules and organelles along
  the axon. In the diseased PNS (right), disruption of SC-axon metabolic interactions
  may be both a cause and a consequence of pathology. For example, in diabetes ①,
  high levels of glucose lead to activation of the polyol pathway, mitochondrial dysfunction,
  and oxidative stress, which drive the development of neuropathic symptoms and axon
  degeneration. Also, experimental models of impaired SC metabolism, such as the LKB1
  and TFAM mouse mutants, have demonstrated the effects of abnormal lipid production
  ② in axonal maintenance, with or without progressive changes to myelin ③. Primary
  myelin defects are also a driver of axonal loss, as reduced or defective myelin
  will impair axon impulse conduction and drive the development of neuropathy. Disruption
  of axon-glia metabolism and communication by any of these pathways can lead to axonal
  degeneration with abnormal sensory (e.g., paresthesia) and motor (e.g., muscular
  atrophy) function. Further studies of the SC-axon metabolic relationship are necessary
  to allow the prevention, early detection, and treatment of pathologies.
