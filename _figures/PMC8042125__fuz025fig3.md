caption: PII controls the arginine pathway by NAGK interaction. The arginine synthesis
  pathway is controlled by PII-dependent activation of the rate-limiting step, the
  N-acetyl glutamate kinase (NAGK) reaction. Under nitrogen sufficient, low 2-OG conditions,
  two PII trimers (in ATP complex) symmetrically associate with the hexameric NAGK
  (PDB entry 2V5H) to activate the reaction and to tune down arginine feedback inhibition.
  This allows increased flux towards arginine, which then may be used also to store
  excess nitrogen in form of cyanopyhcin (for details see text). Under nitrogen-limiting
  conditions, the increasing 2-OG levels lead to dissociation of the complex. Free
  NAGK is highly sensitive towards arginine-feedback inhibition. Subsequent phosphorylation
  of PII robustly prevents further NAGK interaction, unless PII becomes dephosphorylated
  again in response to sustained nitrogen excess conditions.
