caption: 'Cyclic hypoxia promotes phenotypic plasticity in MCs due to significant
  transcriptomic changes that lead to hyper-responsiveness to IgE/Ag-dependent stimulation.
  MCs exposed to cyH suffer an increase in ROS production and modify their transcriptional
  profile. Upregulated genes include classical markers of hypoxia such as Hif-1α and
  Vegf. Moreover, upregulated genes are associated with oxidative phosphorylation
  and the FcεRI signaling pathway. An increase in FcεRI-signaling elements leads to
  increased Ca2+ mobilization and overactivation of PLCγ, culminating in enhanced
  degranulation and expression of cytokine mRNAs, such as Tnf-α, Il-2, and Il-4. This
  hyperresponsive phenotype of IgE/Ag-activated MCs could promote angiogenesis, tumor
  growth, and metastasis. TAMC: tumor-associated mast cell; TME: tumor microenvironment.
