caption: 'Canonical and non-canonical pathway of NF-κB. On the (left), p50/p65 subunits
  are inhibited by IκBs; however, when the pathway is activated, IκBs are phosphorylated
  by the IKK complex integrated by IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ and sent to degradation. Then,
  the p50/p65 are released and translocated in the nucleus to activate the transcription
  of the target genes. On the (right), in the non-canonical pathway, RelB is sequestered
  by p100. When the pathway is activated, IKKα phosphorylates and sends p100 to degradation.
  Then, RelB is released and forms a dimer with p52, which is translocated to the
  nucleus. Abbreviations: IκB kinase complex (IKK); Transforming growth factor-β–activated
  kinase 1 (TAK); NF-κB-Inducing Kinase (NIK).'
