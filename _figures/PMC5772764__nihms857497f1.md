caption: Synthesis pathway for serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is depicted here
  with enzymes responsible for each step as well as known inhibitors of these enzymes.
  Serotonin will then bind to one of seven 5-HT receptors (5-HT1-7) at the nerve ending.
  A few known drug inhibitors of specific 5-HT receptors are also portrayed.
