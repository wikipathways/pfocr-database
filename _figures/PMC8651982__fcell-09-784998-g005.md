caption: Some Post-Translational Modifications modulating the transcriptional activities
  of TCF7l1 and Gro/TLE. Post-translational modifications (PTM) including phosphorylation
  and/or ubiquitination of (A) T-cell factor-like-1 (TCF7l1) and (B) Groucho/Transducin-like
  enhancer of split (Gro/TLE) influence positively, or negatively, the transcriptional
  output of TCF7l1/Gro complex. (A) (a) TCF7l1 bound on W-CRM with co-repressors normally
  limits transcription. (b) The Homeodomain-Interacting Protein Kinase-2 (HIPK2) acts
  as a positive or negative regulator of Wnt target genes’ expression. Phosphorylation
  of TCF7l1 by HIPK2 decreases TCF7l1 affinity to target genes’ promoter and enables
  transcription through the β-catenin/T-Cell Factor-7 (β-cat/TCF7) complex. (c) Conversely,
  phosphorylation of the transcriptional activators Lymphoid Enhancer Factor-1 (LEF1)
  and TCF7l2 abolishes their binding to the promoter and blocks gene transcription.
  (B) (a) Gro/TLE together with DNA binding Co-repressor normally limits RNA Pol II
  mediated transcription. (b) The Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) phosphorylates Gro/TLE
  through the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway, resulting in a decrease
  of Gro/TLE repressive activity. Gro/TLE mediates crosstalk between Notch and MAPK
  signaling pathways. Notch signaling activation leads to the expression of the Enhancer
  of split E(spl), which is a major transcriptional repressor of Notch target genes.
  E(spl) complexes with Gro/TLE to block target genes’ expression, including proneural
  genes. Phosphorylation of Gro/TLE by the MAPK pathway inhibits its function as a
  repressor. (c) When Wnt signaling is activated, the E3 ubiquitin ligase (UBR5) polyubiquitinates
  Gro/TLE in flies. Similarly, in vertebrate, the X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis
  (XIAP) is recruited to the transcriptional complex containing TCF7l1 and Gro/TLE,
  and monoubiquitinates Gro/TLE. Mono/polyubiquitination of Gro/TLE enables its degradation
  by the proteasome and blocks its re-association to TCF7l1, allowing the recruitment
  of the transcriptional co-activator β-cat to the activating TCF/LEF, and further
  expression of Wnt target genes. W-CRM, Wnt-Cis regulatory motif; EGFR, Epidermal
  Growth Factor Receptor.
