caption: Schematic of mTORC1 signaling and genetic mutations at specific sites in
  the pathway. Cytoplasmic mTOR signaling is activated in normal cells by growth factors
  and nutrients. Loss-of-function mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 lead to constitutive
  mTORC1 signaling and cause tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Loss-of-function deletions
  in STRADa cause polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, symptomatic epilepsy syndrome (PS)
  and result in hypoactivation of the TSC1:TSC2 complex and enhanced mTORC1 signaling.
  Hyperactive mTORC1 signaling results in enhanced S6K1 and S6 phosphorylation, leading
  to increased cell size, such as balloon cells (BCs) and giant cells (GCs). mTORC1
  mediated inhibition of 4E-BP1 results in enhanced translation of c-Myc, which in
  turn translocates into the nucleus to regulate expression of Octamer-4 (Oct-4),
  sex-determining region Y box 2 (SOX2), and nestin, perhaps conferring an immature
  cellular phenotype on many type II focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) cells. The molecular
  event causing sporadic FCD type II has yet to be identified but the phenotypic and
  histological similarities between sporadic FCD II, PS, and TSC suggest that sporadic
  FCD type II may be caused by dysfunction of an mTORC1 regulatory gene.
