caption: The first steps of autophagy. The autophagy pathway proceeds through a series
  of stages, including nucleation of the autophagic vesicle, elongation and closure
  of the autophagosome membrane to envelop cytoplasmic constituents, docking of the
  autophagosome with lysosomes and degradation of the material inside the autophagosome.
  For details, see Ref. . This picture shows an essential step in the process of elongation,
  i.e. lipidation of Atg8-like proteins, such as LC3, and targeting of these lipidated
  proteins to the autophagosomal membrane. The delipidation of these proteins, also
  by Atg4, is inhibited by ROS, the source of which can vary with the cell involved
  and the cause of autophagy induction. In case of disturbed ROS production, as in
  CGD macrophages, the delipidation will be increased and autophagosome formation
  will be decreased.
