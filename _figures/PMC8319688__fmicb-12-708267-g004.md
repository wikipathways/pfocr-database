caption: Visualization of the impact of aurone treatment on the central metabolism
  of significantly enriched KEGG pathways. The changes in gene expression in central
  carbon and sulfur metabolic pathways in response to SH1009 (A) and SH9051 (B) treatments.
  Detected genes are colored based on their values of log fold change, green and red
  colors indicate down- and up-regulated genes, respectively; a gray color indicates
  undetected genes. Pathway annotations and gene names are customized from different
  studies on C. albicans or based on their homology in S. cerevisiae and created with
  BioRender.com. Stars indicate genes that are directly activated by the major transcriptional
  activators Tye7p for carbon metabolism and Met4p for sulfur metabolism.
