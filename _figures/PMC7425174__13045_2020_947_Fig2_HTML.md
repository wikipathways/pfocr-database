caption: PD-1-mediated immune regulation. Under low expression levels of PD-L1, CD80
  restricts PD-L1 function by forming the PD-L1/CD80 cis-heterodimer. The PD-L1/CD80
  cis-heterodimer prevents the PD-1/PD-L1 trans-interaction, whereas the ability to
  bind to the CD28 co-stimulatory receptor is retained (left). Upregulation of PD-L1
  on APCs allows the PDL-1/PD-1 trans-interaction, leading to SHP2-dependent negative
  regulation of the CD28 signaling pathway as well as transcriptional repression of
  TCR-induced effector genes (right)
