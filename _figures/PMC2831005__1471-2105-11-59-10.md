caption: Yeast cell cycle. Pathway for Yeast cell cycle, retrieved from Kegg database,
  for the 24 genes analysed. The two coloured sets of genes correspond to the two
  small subnetworks, (6 and 7 genes), analysed separately. The connections between
  genes labelled with e represent known gene regulatory interactions, while the ones
  labelled with p represent known interactions between proteins that can activate
  or repress the activity of one or several proteins involved.
