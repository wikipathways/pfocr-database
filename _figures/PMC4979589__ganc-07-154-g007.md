caption: (A) In the normal colon, Wnt signaling is inactive and Hath1 is transcriptionally
  active in differentiated secretory cells. Hath1 transcriptionally activates MUC4,
  as well as other mucins such as MUC2. (B) However, in colorectal cancer, active
  Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling transcriptionally upregulate Hes1. Hes1 antagonizes
  Hath1, thus reducing Hath1 levels. In addition, the Hath1 protein is targeted for
  phosphorylation mediated destruction by GSK3β instead of β-catenin, further reducing
  Hath1 levels. Thus, MUC4 is no longer actively transcribed owing to reduced Hath1,
  resulting in reduced MUC4.
