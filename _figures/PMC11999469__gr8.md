caption: Connection of Nrf2, NF-κB, NLRP3 Pathways and the mechanism of SA. When NLRP3
  agonists or ROS stimulate cells, they activate the adaptor protein ASC, and its
  PYD domain recruits NLRP3. The CARD domain of NLRP3 binds to the CARD domain of
  Pro-caspase-1 to self-cleave and activate Pro-caspase-1 and generate a series of
  inflammatory factors. When cells are subjected to external stimuli such as LPS,
  LPS binds to TLR4 receptors on the cell surface and generates endogenous ROS, prompting
  NF-κB translocation into the nucleus to exert inflammation and inducing the generation
  of downstream inflammatory proteins and pro-inflammatory factors. Under normal conditions,
  Keap1 and Nrf2 bind together, and when Nrf2 activator or endogenous ROS stimulate
  cells, they lead to the release of Nrf2 from Keap1, translocating Nrf2 into the
  nucleus and activating antioxidant ARE sequences, thereby inducing a series of downstream
  antioxidant enzymes
