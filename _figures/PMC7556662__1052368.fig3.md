caption: The TF and contact pathways activate coagulation and generate thrombin. Abnormal
  expression of intravascular TF in sickle cell disease (SCD), the so called “blood
  borne TF”, triggers intravascular blood coagulation and pathological thrombosis.
  After binding with plasma factor VIIa, TF activates the extrinsic pathway of coagulation,
  generating thrombin, which mediates fibrin deposition, thrombosis and vascular remodeling.
  Besides lowered natural anticoagulant factor levels (thrombomodulin, protein C and
  S) also favor thrombosis. Activation of the contact pathway of coagulation by RBC
  phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EV), platelet
  polyphosphates, cfDNA and NET also sustain thrombin generation. TF and thrombin
  cause chronic inflammation possibly leading to endothelial injury, vascular permeability,
  angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, all of which are reflected by vasculopathy.
