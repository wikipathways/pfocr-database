caption: 'Intracellular estrogen receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling
  pathway in non-small cell lung cancer. A: Mechanisms of ER and EGFR signaling in
  NSCLC. E2 (17β-estradiol)-bound ER acts in part as a transcription factor in the
  nucleus. Once the ER binds to the DNA in the estrogen response element of a gene,
  it generally recruits co-activator complexes to modulate gene transcription (genomic
  signal). In addition, E2-bound ER also acts in the cytoplasm (non-genomic signal)
  by interacting with downstream mediators of EGFR signaling, such as MAPK and PI3K/AKT.
  EGFR is a cell membrane receptor tyrosine kinase that transmits a signal when it
  binds EGF; B: Mechanisms of combination therapy for NSCLC. The estrogen antagonist
  fulv binds to ERs and blocks estrogen signaling. EGFR-TKIs, such as gefitinib or
  erlotinib, bind to mtEGFR and inhibit EGFR signaling. Both treatments block the
  interaction between ER and EGFR signaling. EGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor;
  ER: Estrogen receptor; TKI: Tyrosine kinase inhibitor.'
