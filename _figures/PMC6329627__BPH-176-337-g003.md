caption: Molecular mechanisms for PGE2‐cytokine crosstalk in facilitation of adaptive
  Th1 and Th17 cell responses. (A) PGE2 through EP2/EP4 receptors activates the cAMP‐PKA‐CREB/CRTC2
  pathway that in turn drives the expression of IL‐12β2 and IFN‐γ 1 receptors (R)
  and amplifies cytokine signalling, leading to facilitation of Th1 cell differentiation.
  Additionally, activation of PI3K by strengthened CD28 costimulation and that by
  EP2/EP4 receptors further supports Th1 cell differentiation by antagonizing cAMP/PKA‐mediated
  suppression of TCR activation. (B) IL‐23 induces COX‐2 expression and low levels
  of PGE2 production by activated Th17 cells. T‐cell‐intrinsic PGE2 then acts back
  on Th17 cells for the induction of IL‐23 receptor (and possibly also IL‐1 receptor)
  through the positive feedback IL‐23‐PGE2‐EP2/EP4‐cAMP‐PKA‐STAT3/CREB/NF‐κB‐IL‐23
  receptor loop, leading to the generation of pathogenic Th17 cells by synergistic
  actions with IL‐23 and/or IL‐1. CREB and CRTC2 can also directly drive IL‐17A gene
  expression by binding to its promoter. (C) Activation of NF‐κB induced by TLR or
  CD40 engagement on DCs induces the early phase of IL‐23 p19 gene expression. NF‐κB
  also induces DCs to express COX2 and PGE2, which then further amplifies NF‐κB signalling
  for the IL‐23 p19 expression through the EP2/EP4‐cAMP‐PKA‐CREB pathways. PGE2 can
  also induce IL‐23 p19 expression through cAMP‐Epac pathway‐activated C/EBPβ.
