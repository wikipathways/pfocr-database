caption: A model for the dual regulation of ecm33+ gene expression and its putative
  involvement in the negative feedback regulation of the Pmk1 MAPK signaling pathway.
  Regulatory elements in the promoter are schematically represented. Dotted lines
  denote hitherto uncharacterized processes. Ecm33 may exert its effect on Ca2+/calcineurin
  signaling largely via Pmk1 pathway and partly via other Ca2+-influx machineries.
