caption: A proposed model of cross-talks among mast cells, T cells, and tumor cells
  leading to mast cell-mediated immunosuppressive and protumorigenic effects in the
  GC microenvironment. CXCL12-CXCR4 chemotaxis mediates the recruitment and accumulation
  of mast cells into the GC microenvironment, which could be up-regulated PD-L1 expression
  via NF-κB signaling pathway activation by tumor-derived TNF-α. Mast cells inhibit
  T-cell proliferation and function in a PD-L1-dependent manner in GC, which promotes
  GC progression

  cancer progression through TNF-α-PD-L1 pathway.
