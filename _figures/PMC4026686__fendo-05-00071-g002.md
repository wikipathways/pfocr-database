caption: Illustration of the biased agonist action of the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonists
  LSD and DOI at the 5-HT2A protomer of the 5-HT2A–D2LR heterodimer, which leads to
  enhanced Gi/o signaling over the D2R protomer producing an enhanced inhibition of
  the AC–PKA–CREB pathway. In contrast, the standard 5-HT2A agonist TCB2 did not produce
  a modulation of the D2R agonist-induced inhibition of the AC–PKA–CREB pathway and
  the endogenous ligand 5-HT significantly reduced the signaling of this pathway.
  A biased 5-HT2A agonism with DOI was also observed in the facilitatory D2LR–5-HT2A
  receptor–receptor interaction of the heteromer, which enhances 5-HT2A signaling
  over Gq/11–PLC when using 5-HT and TCB2 as 5-HT2A agonists. Thus, when using DOI
  as a 5-HT2A agonist, a D2R agonist instead diminished 5-HT2A protomer signaling
  over the Gq/11–PLC pathway.
