caption: Schematic representation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) induced apoptosis
  signalling pathways. When released into the cytoplasm of the target cell, granzyme
  B can activate caspase 3, both directly and indirectly, by truncation of the proapoptotic
  bcl-2 family member Bid (t-Bid), resulting in activation of the caspase 9 mediated
  pathway. Ligation of the FAS death receptor by CTL secreted FAS ligand will result
  in activation of caspase 8, again resulting in activation of caspase 3 with execution
  of apoptosis.
