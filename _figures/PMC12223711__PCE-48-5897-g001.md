caption: Function of NDR1 and other NHLs in PTI and ETI responses. (A) The role of
  NDR1 in PTI and ETI. NDR1 protein is localized on the plasma membrane. Recognition
  of PAMPs by PRRs, triggers signal transduction via receptor‐like cytoplasmic kinases
  (RLCKs). NDR1 and EDS1 are activated dependent (green lines i) or independent (green
  lines ii) on the MPK3/6 activities, leading to the upregulation of NLRs proteins.
  In ETI, NDR1 interacts with RIN4, which is associated with RPS2 and RPM1, to facilitate
  ETI in response to the effectors AvrRpt2 and AvrRpm1 secreted by the bacteria through
  a type III secretory system (T3SS). This interaction initiates a signalling pathway
  involving with (red lines iii) or without (red line iv) EDS1 and MPK3/6, to further
  increase the expression of NLRs. A positive feedback loop (red line v) between downstream
  MPK3/6 and EDS1 contributes to the sustained activation of MPK3/6. These activated
  NLRs trigger ETI, which potentiates and restores PTI through upregulation of PTI
  components. (B) Illustration demonstrating the crucial role of AtNHL3 in regulating
  callose deposition in response to chitin and flg22 treatment. LysM‐containing GPI‐anchored
  protein 2 (LYM2) and LysM domain receptor‐like kinase 4 (LYK4) is a membrane‐bound
  chitin‐triggered plasmodesmal closure protein and a chitin signalling protein, respectively.
  CPK11 and CPK6 are calcium‐dependent protein Kinases that phosphorylate respiratory
  Burst oxidase homologue D (RBOHD). Flagellin‐sensing 2 (FLS2) is perceived by flg22
  and causes a downstream signal by interacting with BRI1‐associated kinase 1 (BAK1).
  Activation of calmodulin‐like 41 (CML41) indirectly leads to phosphorylation of
  RBOHD. RBOHD converts O2 to H2O2. H2O2 then acts to close stomata by facilitating
  the interaction between Plasmodesmata‐located protein 1/5 (PDLP1/5), AtNHL3, and
  callose synthase 1 (CALS1), with AtNHL3 acting as a scaffold protein. [Color figure
