caption: Proposed modification strategies of flavonoids, carotenoids and chlorophyll
  metabolic pathways in tepals of Chinese narcissus to acquire functional color pigments.
  (A) Reconstruction of flavonoids metabolic pathway to acquire functional anthocyanin
  pigments (cyanidin, delphinidin, and pelargonodin); (B) Modification of expression
  of some critical genes in carotenoids metabolic pathway to acquire sufficient functional
  carotenoids pigments; (C) Restriction of gene expression in chlorophyll breakdown
  and heme formation sub-pathways meanwhile increase gene expression in ALA formation,
  Proto IX formation and chlorophyll formation sub-pathways may produce flower with
  green tepal. The specific suggestions for modifications of each pathway are listed
  at the bottom of each section. Black filled arrows indicate the substance metabolism
  directions; red “X” means the decrease or deletion of the expression of negative
  gene(s) or sub-pathways in order to remodel the main pathway.
