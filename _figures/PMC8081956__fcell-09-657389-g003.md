caption: Overview of autophagy pathways in mammalian cells. Common autophagy markers
  and their participation in autophagic machinery, as discussed in Section “Autophagy
  Markers.” Signaling pathways that culminate in autophagy induction commonly lead
  to the activation of ULK1 kinase complex, promoting its localization at autophagy
  initiation sites near the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ULK1 complex activity regulates
  the activation of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, consisting
  of class III PI3K, VPS34, and other interacting proteins, including BECLIN-1. This
  complex is responsible for the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)
  at the site of early isolation membrane formation, which is essential for the nucleation
  step in the autophagic pathway. PI3P acts as a signaling molecule that recruits
  the double FYVE containing protein 1 (DFCP1) and other PI3P-binding proteins that
  promote the omegasome formation. At the expansion step, the autophagy-related protein
  7 (ATG7) functions as an E1-like enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of ATG12
  to ATG5 in collaboration with the E2-like activity of ATG10. ATG12-ATG5 interacts
  with ATG16L at the vesicle membrane, marking the lipidation site. Microtubule-associated
  proteins 1A/1B light chain (LC3) at its mature form (LC3-I) are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) through the combined activity of ATG7 (E1-like enzyme), ATG3 (E2-like enzyme)
  and ATG12-ATG5 (E3 ligase enzyme). LC3 conjugated to PE (named LC3-II) is located
  at the autophagosome membrane and is important for the expansion and completion
  of the isolation membrane. P62/sequestosome-1 (named p62) works as an autophagy
  adaptor that recognizes polyubiquitinated cargos that will be sequestered for autophagic
  degradation due to their interaction with LC3-II. P62 phosphorylation at serine
  403 (p-S403) increases affinity for polyubiquitinated targets and is promoted during
  autophagy activation. P62 phosphorylation at serine 349 (p-S349) is important for
  its competitive interaction with KEAP1 protein, promoting the activation of the
  NRF2 transcription factor, important during non-alcoholic liver disease (NALFD)
  development. Other autophagy adaptors besides p62 may participate during cargo recognition
  of selective autophagy. After autophagosome closure, the autophagic pathway proceeds
  with the formation of the autolysosome. The autophagosome external membrane fuses
  with the lysosome, releasing lysosome acidic hydrolases into the autophagosome lumen,
  and promoting cargo digestion. Importantly, LC3-II and p62 present within the autolysosome
  are also degraded in this process.
