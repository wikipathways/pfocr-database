caption: '“Hedgehog OFF”: In the absence of Hedgehog ligands, PTCH1 suppresses the
  accumulation of SMO, thus repressing its activity. GLI2 and GLI3 are trapped in
  the cytoplasm by SUFU and consequently phosphorylated by PKA, CK1, and GSK3β. Phosphorylated
  GLI2 and GLI3 are degraded by the proteasome into repressor forms (GLI2R and GLI3R),
  which inhibit downstream gene expression. “Hedgehog ON”: Once Hedgehog binds to
  PTCH1, SMO inhibition is relieved. Activated SMO relieves the suppression of GLI2
  and GLI3 by SUFU. The GLIs evade phosphorylation and the activated forms (GLI2A
  and GLI3A) translocate to the nucleus to activate Hedgehog target gene expression.'
