caption: a | Repressive histone-modifying enzymes Polycomb complex protein BMI1 and
  histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2, as part of Polycomb repressive complex
  1 (PRC1) and PRC2, respectively, contribute to the functional phenotypes of memory-like
  killer cell lectin-like subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1)–CD8+ T cells and terminally
  differentiated KLRG1+CD8+ T cells via subset-specific activity. Differential targeting
  of Notch repressors Numb and Fbxw7 and cell cycle repressors, including Cdkn2a,
  results in activation or repression of Notch and retinoblastoma-associated protein
  1 (RB1)–p53 pathways, ultimately affecting polyfunctionality and apoptosis. Similarly,
  differential repression of memory-associated loci affects the memory-associated
  transcriptional programme. In memory-like subsets, active transcription facilitated
  by forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) binding may inhibit EZH2-mediated repression.
  b | The left panel illustrates a bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4)-dependent
  regulatory cascade that is critical for normal effector cell differentiation. The
  recognition of lysine acetylation marks (yellow pentagon) by the histone reader
  protein BRD4 increases expression of the transcription factor Batf (which encodes
  basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor ATF-like (BATF)). BATF, together with
  activator protein 1 (AP-1), transcriptionally represses the histone deacetylase
  gene Sirt1 (which encodes protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)). Decreased activity
  of SIRT1 increases acetylation at the Tbx21 (which encodes T-bet) locus, resulting
  in increased expression of Tbx21 and T-bet target genes. The addition of the bromodomain
  inhibitor JQ1 upends this pathway (right panel), with the lack of Sirt1 repression
  contributing to decreased histone acetylation and the reduced expression of Tbx21
  and T-bet targets. Ultimately, JQ1 inhibits effector differentiation, which results
  in increased stem cell memory T (TSCM) and central memory T (TCM) cells. Ac, acetylation;
  TF, transcription factor.
