caption: Role of nitric oxide in fruit ripening, programmed cell death and leaf senescence.
  (A) NO and ROS-mediated control of programmed cell death. Plants rapidly-produce
  NO and various ROS in response to biotic and/or abiotic stresses leading to intrinsic
  execution of the target cells. NO and ROS can trigger PCD either synergistically
  or independently. Both NO and ROS are implicated in the hypersensitive response
  (HR), characterized by the execution of the infected and surrounding cells, is a
  well-known form of PCD in plants. However, significant cross-talk exists between
  NO and ROS during the establishment of HR. The establishment of HR warrants a critical
  balance between intracellular levels of NO and ROS. Several key proteins such as
  non-expressor of pathogensi-related genes 1 (NPR1), TGA1 (transcriptional activators
  that specifically bind to 5′-TGACG-3′), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrorgenase
  (GAPDH), respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RBOHD) are involved in HR are known
  to be S-nitrosated by NO or affected by the NO-ROS cross talk. NO is also known
  to scavenge H2O2 under certain circumstances thereby protecting plant cells from
  ROS-mediated damage. (B) NO-mediated regulation of senescence, seed dormancy and
  fruit ripening. NO affects leaf senescence by modulating phytohormones such as ABA,
  ET, and JA. Though the role of NO in seed ageing is not well-defined, NO is known
  to break seed dormancy via stimulation of ET production. NO donors and arginine
  (Arg) abolishes seed dormancy and stimulates germination whereas, the application
  of NO scavengers (such as cPTIO, L-Name, and CAN) promotes seed dormancy. NO-mediated
  removal of seed dormancy and promotion of germination is associated with alternations
  of nitrated and biotinylated proteins, ABA, JA and protein nitration. NO has also
  been implicated in fruit ripening. As the fruit ripens, ROS and RNS anabolic vs.
  catabolic rates change significantly altering the overall nitro-oxidative environment
  at the cellular level ultimately affecting the NO-dependent S-Nitorsation and Tyrosine
  Nitration events in fruit. Furthermore, NO mediated binding and chelation, S-nitrosylation
  of methionine adenosyl transferase (MAT), stoichiometric reduction of ACC and transcriptional
  regulation of several genes involved in the ethylene pathway plays an important
  role in fruit ripening.
