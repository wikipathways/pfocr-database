caption: Innate immunity. Lysosomal damage is a key pathway for NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation, with ANXA2 recruited to the damaged lysosomal membrane to facilitate
  repair, thereby inhibiting inflammasome activation and IL-18 release. Moreover,
  autophagy can interact with NLRP3 via mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs).
  Fas-mediated apoptotic signalling enhances calcium influx into the mitochondria,
  activating NLRP3 through mitochondrial dysfunction. The ANXA2/S100A10 complex, in
  response to calcium signalling, promotes the translocation of ULK1 to MAMs, inducing
  autophagy to clear damaged mitochondria and suppress apoptosis and inflammatory
  responses. Adaptive immunity. ANXA2 suppresses T-cell functions. It limits tumour
  cell apoptosis induced by TRAIL by promoting autophagy, which inhibits the formation
  of the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) necessary for T-cell-mediated apoptosis.
  Additionally, ANXA2 activates TLR2 on tumour-associated neutrophils, enhancing the
  expression of arginase 1 (ARG1), an enzyme that depletes L-arginine in the tumour
  microenvironment. This depletion hampers T-cell proliferation and function, allowing
  tumour cells to evade immune responses
