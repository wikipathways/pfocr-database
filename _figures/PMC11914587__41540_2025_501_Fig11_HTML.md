caption: Misfolded proteins from motor neurons and astrocyte activate the CD14 and
  TLR receptors on microglia to initiate NLRP3 inflammasome signaling leading to neuronal
  inflammation. NLRP3 nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich–containing family, pyrin
  domain–containing-3, TLR Toll-like receptor; CD14 cluster of differentiation 14,
  IL-1b Interleukin 1β, IL-18 Interleukin 18. Double-sided orange rectangle represents
  a molecular pathway within a cell; black arrow represents signal propagation; small
  dark blue rectangle represents a protein or enzyme; small pink rectangle represents
  mutated protein/enzyme; and, green step arrow represents a receptor
