caption: The ferrichrome pathways in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. In E. coli the transport
  involves two TonB outer membrane transporters, FhuA and FhuE, and an inner membrane
  ABC transporter, FhuBCD. Iron is released by a mechanism probably involving metal
  reduction and acetylation of the desferrichrome, followed by siderophore recycling
  in the extracellular medium. In P. aeruginosa, transport involves two TonB1 outer
  membrane transporters, FiuA and FoxA, and a permease, FiuB, for transport across
  the inner membrane. Iron is released from the siderophore by a mechanism similar
  to that in E. coli. FiuC is probably the N-acetyltransferase. FoxB seems also to
  be involved in ferrichrome transport; however, its function is so far unknown. In
  P. aeruginosa, both outer membrane transporters, FiuA and FoxA, are also involved
  in a signaling cascade regulating the expression of the genes involved in the ferrichrome
  pathway.
