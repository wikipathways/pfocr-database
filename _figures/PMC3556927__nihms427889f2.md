caption: Proposed model showing interplay of molecular chaperones and ubiquitin–proteasome
  degradation pathways for mutant misfolded keratins and possible targets for therapeutic
  interventions. The interaction between molecular chaperones and the ubiquitin–proteasome
  system is a critical step in the response to cytotoxic effects of damaged keratins.
  Attempts to either conserve cellular resources by refolding and/or preventing toxicity
  by degrading the aggregated keratins are suggested modulation of either systems
  (pathways 1 or 2) may provide a unique therapeutic target for keratin diseases.
  Following nascent inactive mutant keratin polypeptide release from the ribosome,
  the misfolded keratin is initially recognized by Hsp40 and delivered to Hsp70. Subsequently,
  depending on the nature of the mutation, a multi-chaperone complex assembles containing
  the Hsp70 co-chaperone Hip and Hop. A number of co-chaperone networking determines
  the folding and degradation activities of Hsp70. At the final stage of the chaperone
  pathway, Hsp90 can associate with diverse binding proteins (such as heat shock protein
  binding protein 1HspBP1, HIP, HOP, CHIP [via its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR),
  etc.] to mediate conformational changes of the misfolded keratin required to activate
  and refold back. Alternatively when the misfolded keratin protein is marked by phosphorylation,
  during cell stress and the cytotoxic effects of mutations, the activation pathway
  is blocked and phosphorylated keratin aggregates are targeted to the proteasome
  for degradation. This process involves the cochaperone CHIP and the ubiquitin ligases
  E3 (STUB1) forming the BAG-1 or (STUB1)–Hsp70–CHIP complex (pathway 2) which can
  also be ensured by increased nuclear translocation of the transcription factor pHSF-1
  upon induction. BAG-1/STUB1 associate with the ATPase domain of Hsp70 and mediate
  interaction of Hsp70 with the proteasome via its ubiquitin-like domain (ubl), whereas
  CHIP binds to the carboxyl terminus and acts as chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase
  to mediate the attachment of a polyubiquitin chain to the chaperone substrate (Hsp70-misfolded
  keratin aggregates). The misfolded keratin aggregates are targeted and cleared by
  the ubiquitin–proteasome degradation pathway (pathway 2). Before the tagged aggregated
  keratins are targeted, they are covalently modified with ubiquitin (Ub) through
  a series of steps that involve Ub activation (E1), conjugation (E2) and ligation
  (E3) and require ATP hydrolyses. This ubiquitin then forms substrate for further
  rounds of ubiquitination, forming the polyubiquitin chain linked by lysines and
  forms part of the recognition signal for the Ub-tagged aggregated keratins to be
  shuttled for degradation via ATP-dependent hydrolysis into the 26S proteasome by
  a set of protein domains such as the ubl domain of BAG-1. In the BAG-1 complex keratins
  are degraded and reduced to peptides, which are then released into the cytosol and
  further broken down by peptidases to free amino acids, while the ubiquitin chain
  are de-ubiquitinated and recycled to free ubiquitin. Most remarkably, BAG-1/STUB1
  and CHIP associate with Hsp70 to induce the proteasome degradation of a Hsp70-bound
  keratin aggregates (pathway 2). When BAG-1 is displaced by binding of HspBP1 to
  the ATPase domain of Hsp70, the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP is attenuated
  in the formed complex, enabling CHIP to modulate Hsp70 activity without inducing
  degradation. The ATPase domain can also be occupied by Hip, which stimulates the
  chaperone activity of Hsp70 and participates in the Hsp70/Hsp90-mediated biochemical
  pathway regulation. At the same time, Hop displaces CHIP from the carboxyl terminus
  of Hsp70 and recruits Hsp90 to the chaperone complex. Intervention 1 and 2 are possible
  therapeutic strategies to reduce the levels of mutant keratin aggregates and cell
  fragility. 1, By interference-related approaches at the synthesis phase (e.g. by
  RNAi and SmarT). 2, By development of various small chemical molecules that can
  modulate molecular chaperones in favour of keratin refolding or degradation by the
  proteasomal pathways. Finally, the interruption or removal of mutant keratin aggregates
  in patients with hereditary keratinopathies may allow for the formation of a normally
  appearing KIF cytoskeleton with intact keratin.
