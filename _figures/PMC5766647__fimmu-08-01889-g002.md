caption: Gut–liver axis and metabolites flux toward the liver. Intrahepatic T cell
  (including Treg cells) lineage fitness, function, survival, and proliferation are
  influenced by signals from the antigen presenting dendritic cells (DCs) and cytokines.
  The T cell receptor (TCR) binding to the foreign antigen–MHC II complex and co-stimulation
  provided by CD80 and CD86 binding to the T cells CD28/CTLA-4 induces T cell activation
  or inhibition of its function. Cytokines secreted by the DCs determine the differentiation
  pathway of the activated CD4 T cell to different Th1/Th2/Th17 lineages or Treg-cell
  survival with contact-dependent mechanism with DCs CD80/86. IL-2 is secreted in
  the liver by activated T effector cells, and this is required for Treg-cell survival
  and suppressive function. Dietary SCFAs (acetate, propionic acid, and butyrate)
  and MCFAs arrive to the liver via the portal vein, but LCFAs are absorbed via intestinal
  lymphatics and drain back into the systemic circulation via the thoracic duct. The
  amino acids, Glu and Arg, and glucose are also absorbed via the portal venous system
  towards the liver. There is always a certain degree of gut leakiness and bacterial
  product such as lipopolysaccharide reaches to the liver, and they rapidly undergo
  phagocytosis by hepatic sinusoidal Kupffer cells, which function as a sinusoidal
  firewall of the liver (). The liver is enriched with fat-soluble vitamins such as
  vitamins A and D. DCs express immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
  (IDO), which transform Trp into kynurenine, which is then metabolized into other
  catabolites through the action of enzymes within the kynurenine pathway (, , ).
  Trp-derived catabolites can mediate the tolerogenic effects of IDO by inducing apoptosis
  of activated but not resting T cells (). Folic acid binds to folic acid receptor
  (FR4) on the Treg cell and Niacin (vitamin B3) interacts with GPCR109 on DCs. Glu,
  glutamine; Trp, tryptophan; Arg, arginine; SCFA, short-chain fatty acid; MCFA, median
  chain fatty acid; LCFA, long-chain fatty acid.
