caption: Schematic outline of the involvement of necroptosis in elimination of cells
  of the cardiovascular system and reported inhibition strategies based on necroptosis
  pathway. A) Role of Nec1s in treatment of atherosclerosis in response to inflammation
  and necroptotic death of cells including macrophages and VSMCs. B) Ischemia-reperfusion
  related injury has been found to eliminate cardiomyocytes, notably via necroptotic
  machinery somewhat different from the conventional signaling pathway. C) Treatment
  of abdominal aortic aneurysms by Nec1s and potentially NSA by prevention of VSMC-necroptosis
  as a therapeutic strategy. ApoE−/−, apolipoprotein E knockout; Ldlr−/−, low-density
  lipoprotein receptor knockout; Mφ, macrophage; I/R, ischemia reperfusion; mPTP,
  mitochondrial permeability transition pore
