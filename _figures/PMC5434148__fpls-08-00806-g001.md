caption: Brassinosteroid mediated cell wall remodeling. Models of the BR signaling
  pathway are drawn based on the information from rice (). Activated and repressed
  reactions are represented by arrows and blunt-ended lines, respectively. Negative
  regulators (GSK and 14-3-3) are in the shape of stars. Phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation
  are represented by “+P” and “-P,” respectively. Direct and indirect regulation are
  represented by solid and dashed lines, respectively.
