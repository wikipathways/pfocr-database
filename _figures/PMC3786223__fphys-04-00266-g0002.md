caption: The potential role of miRNAs in the attenuated myogenic process in the elderly.
  Let-7b and let-7e may contribute to the inhibition of satellite cell activation
  and proliferation via downregulating cell cycle regulators CKD6, CDC25A, and CDC34.
  In addition miR-181a may inhibit ActRIIA (activin type IIa receptor) and as a consequence
  permit activation of the proliferation inhibitors SMAD2/3. The combination of miR-221
  and miR-698 further inhibits proliferation by down regulating various MRFs and driving
  terminal differentiation of the myocytes. Anabolic stimulus is known to reduce miR-1.
  Failure to downregulate miR-1 in elderly skeletal muscle following anabolic stimulation
  may contribute to anabolic resistance in mature myotubes via inhibition of IGF-1/Akt
  signaling., ↑ = stimulatory pathway; or, T = inhibitory pathway; ↑, upregulated
  miRNA; ↓, downregulated miRNA; ?, cause-and-effect relationship not established.
