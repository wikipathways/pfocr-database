caption: Schematic representation of the proposed model. (A) Schematic representation
  of the dual mode of regulation of tuberin and the mTOR pathway in response to growth
  factors, as previously proposed by Ma et al. (). Both the ERK and the Akt kinases
  can directly control the phosphorylation levels of tuberin, thus allowing for the
  double control of the pathway by growth factor receptors. (B) Proposed model for
  the regulation of the tuberin and mTOR pathway by PC-1. PC-1 induces activation
  of the PI3k/Akt pathway (), but the pool of Akt activated in response to PC-1 is
  not able to phosphorylate Tsc2. At the same time, PC-1 overexpression downregulates
  the MEK/ERK pathway (our current work), resulting in reduced phosphorylation of
  tuberin and thus inhibition of mTOR. In ADPKD, the absence of PC-1 would result
  in the upregulation of the ERKs responsible for upregulating the mTOR pathway.
