caption: Model of the regulation of the insulin signaling pathway by miRNA cluster
  mmu–mir-183–96–182. Mir-96 and mir-183 are mainly responsible for regulating Irs1,
  which is the key mediator of the metabolic aspect of the insulin pathway, whereas
  mir-182 targets Rasa1 and Grb2, both of which play important roles in linking insulin
  signaling with the Ras pathway. A dotted arrow indicates the experimentally verified
  miRNA and target gene interactions via luciferase activity assay.
