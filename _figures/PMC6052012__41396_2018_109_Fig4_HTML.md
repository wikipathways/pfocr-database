caption: 'Metabolic construction of the putative pathway for AOM coupled to Fe(III)
  reduction in “M. ferrireducens“. Electrons from methane are generated through the
  “reverse methanogenesis” pathway and transferred to the menaquinone pool (MK/MKH2)
  via the Fpo and Hdr complexes, which oxidise F420H2 and CoM-SH+CoB-SH, respectively.
  CoM-SH and CoB-SH can be oxidised by the HdrDE complex [] or the cytoplasmic HdrABC–FrhB
  complex that also reoxidise ferredoxin and reduce two F420 []. Reducing equivalents
  are transferred via the menaquinone:cytochrome c oxidoreductases to MHCs located
  outside the cytoplasm to reduce the Fe(III) oxides. Abbreviations for enzymes and
  co-factors: H4MPT, tetrahydromethanopterin; MFR, methanofuran; Fwd, formyl-methanofuran
  dehydrogenase; Ftr, formylmethanofuran/H4MPT formyltransferase; Mch, methenyl-H4MPT
  cyclohydrolase; Mtd, F420-dependent methylene H4MPT dehydrogenase; Mer, F420-dependent
  methylene-H4MPT reductase; Mtr, Na+-translocating methyl-H4MPT:coenzyme M methyltransferase;
