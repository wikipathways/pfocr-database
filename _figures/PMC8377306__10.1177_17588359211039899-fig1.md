caption: 'Proposed immune-stimulatory properties of certain cytotoxic agents (a) capable
  of inducing an immunogenic cell death, such as anthracyclines or (b) with immunogenic
  activity, such as PARP (Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) inhibitors: PARP inhibition
  results in (a) accumulation of cytosolic double strand DNA, which (b) activates
  cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate)
  synthetase (cGAS) and (c) the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. This
  upregulates (d) type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This in turn
  results in (e) increased antigen presenting capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) and
  CD8+ mediated anti-tumor immune response.'
