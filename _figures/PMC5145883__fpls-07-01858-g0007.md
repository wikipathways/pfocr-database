caption: Flavonoid and theanine biosynthetic pathway in C. sinensis under CT, DT,
  and CD. Heat maps on the left show fold change of the DEGs involved in (A) flavonoid
  biosynthetic pathway and (B) theanine biosynthetic pathway under CT, DT, and CD.
  The numbers in the brackets following each gene name indicate the number of corresponding
  unigenes identified in transcriptome. The color in the ellipses represents the gene
  was regulated under particular stress treatment (blue indicates CT; yellow indicates
  DT; red indicates CD). Full names of enzymatic genes are expanded in Supplementary
  Tables , .
