caption: A simplified scheme illustrating metabolic fates of tryptophan and potential
  consequences of imbalance in its turnover. Kynurenine pathway is the major route
  for tryptophan metabolism in most mammalian tissues (the metabolites within the
  scope of this paper are inside a blue box). KYNA is an agonist of aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AhR) and functions as an ROS scavenger and suppresses inflammatory response.
  A shift toward 3-HK and NAD+ production enhances inflammation.
