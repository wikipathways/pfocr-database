caption: Figure 1. Model for synthetic lethal interactions between ATM and APE1 and
  between ATM and FANC. (A) Replication forks (RF) stall when they encounter base
  lesions. Inhibition of APE1 blocks the PARP1-mediated SSBR pathway (grayed out),
  leading to collapsed replication forks. The FA pathway is required for stabilization
  of sporadic stalled replication forks. Blocking the FA pathway and inhibiting the
  monoubiquitination of FANCD2 therefore destabilizes stalled replication forks (grayed
  out) and leads to fork collapse. The resulting DSB lesions are repaired predominantly
  by ATM-dependent HR. (B) When APE1 or FANC are inhibited in ATM-deficient cancer
  cells, the cells fail to repair DSBs caused by collapsed RFs. Accumulation of unrepaired
  DNA lesions causes cell death. APE1, AP endonuclease 1; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated; DSB, double-strand break; FA, Fanconi anemia; FANC, FA complementation
  group; HR, homologous recombination; PARP1, Poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]–ribose)
  polymerase 1; RF, replication fork; SSBR, SSB repair.
