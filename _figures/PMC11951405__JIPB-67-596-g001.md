  that undergo key post‐translational modifications (PTMs) such as cleavage by subtilases

  for maintaining the RAM and lateral root (LR) development. Additionally, RGF/GLV
  signaling affects PIN2 trafficking, facilitating auxin distribution for gravitropic
  responses. Similarly, PSK peptides are cleaved and sulfated to become bioactive,
  acting through the PSKR and co‐receptors to promote root elongation and nodulation,
