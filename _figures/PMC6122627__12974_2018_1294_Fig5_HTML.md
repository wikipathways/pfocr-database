caption: Schematic representation of the pathways being affected by MDD and by treatments.
  Inflammatory pathway studied (a) and results obtained (b). In b, the colors show
  the statistically significant changes in major depressive disorder (MDD) vs. control
  group (red = upregulation, blue = downregulation). The arrows indicate the effects
  on the MDD group treated with antidepressants at time of death (AD-treated group).
  TLR Toll-like receptor, Hsp Heat shock protein, MyD88 myeloid differentiation primary
  response 88, MKK mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, ERK extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase, JNK c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 protein 38, NF-κB nuclear factor kappa
  B, 5-HTR serotonin receptor, p11 S100 calcium-binding protein A10 (S100A10), DUSP2
  dual-specificity phosphatase 2, Nrf2 nuclear factor (erythroid 2-derived)-like 2,
  Keap-1 Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, PI3K phosphoinositide 3-kinase, P phosphate
