caption: The mechanism of tumor cell genesis induced by hypoxia inducible factor (HIF).
  When oxygen is sufficient and Fe2+ and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) are existing, hypoxia-inducible
  factors (HIF) are hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) protein and then
  bind to pVHL, where they are ubiquitinated and degraded in the proteasome. The inactivation
  of VHL gene and hypoxic microenvironment in renal cancer cells induce the accumulation
  of HIF-1α in large amounts, and HIF-1α and HIF-1β combine to form heterodimer, which
  further stimulates the activation of signal transduction pathways of vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2), erythropoietin (EPO)
  and rapamycin (mTOR) and promoted the further development of tumor
