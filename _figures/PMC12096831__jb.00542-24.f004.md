caption: Trehalose futile cycling facilitates metabolic fine-tuning during stationary
  phase. (A) During stationary phase in E. coli, RpoS-induced expression of the biosynthetic
  genes otsA and otsB leads to the synthesis and accumulation of intracellular trehalose,
  which is then transported into the periplasm via stretch-activated porins (SAPs).
  Once in the periplasm, trehalose is hydrolyzed by TreA back into glucose. Flux of
  this liberated glucose through the PTS sugar transporter EIIC leads to the dephosphorylation
  of EIIA and EIIB, the phosphorylation state of which is key for modulating adenylate
  cyclase (AC) activity. Phosphorylated glucose can be converted back into trehalose
  or enter other metabolic pathways. (B) Deletion mutation of the periplasmic trehalase
  treA results in the accumulation of trehalose in the periplasm and reduced glucose
  flux through the PTS, leading to the phosphorylated EIIA-mediated activation of
  AC, which converts ATP into cAMP. Higher cAMP levels generate increased activation
  of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), upregulating the expression of high- and moderate-affinity
  transporters for carbon substrates, as well as enzymes for alternative carbon metabolism
