caption: The conversion of subendothelial macrophages into cholesterol-laden foam
  cells is believed to constitute the foundation of the atherosclerotic lesion. Native
  LDL has traditionally not been considered capable of generating foam cells because
  cells downregulate their LDL receptor number with increasing cellular cholesterol
  content, precluding lipid loading via this pathway []. Modification of LDL is therefore
  required to drive lipid uptake by alternative receptor pathways. Over the past thirty
  years, multiple means have been identified to alter LDL structure that facilitate
  its conversion of macrophages into lipid-laden foam cells. The widely accepted paradigm
  for the in vivo modification responsible for the alternative receptor binding behavior
  of LDL has been the oxidative modification hypothesis, most cogently proposed by
  Steinberg and colleagues in 1989 []. This theory posits that heightened oxidative
  stress in the vascular wall and its associated production of reactive oxygen and
  nitrogen species give rise to oxidized forms of LDL that are recognized by a family
  of scavenger receptors that we now recognize to be members of the innate immunity
  PRR class []. This family includes eight subclasses of structurally unrelated receptors
  that share the defining feature of being able to bind and internalize modified forms
  of LDL (; reviewed in []). As suggested by their name, these receptors also recognize
  and “scavenge” other modified-self and non-self ligands, including bacteria, apoptotic
  cells, anionic phospholipids and amyloid proteins. The phagocytic function of these
  evolutionarily ancient receptors is believed to have its roots in tissue remodeling
  and host defense, however new evidence suggests that scavenger receptors can also
  direct cellular signal transduction either alone, or by pairing with dedicated signaling
  receptors such as the Toll-like receptors [], which are discussed in greater detail
  below.
