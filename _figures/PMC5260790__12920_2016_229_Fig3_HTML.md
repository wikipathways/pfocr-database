caption: The differential methylation network of schizophrenia. The schizophrenic
  differential methylation network (SDMN) was generated by QQPPI of schizophrenic
  differential methylated genes (SDMGs) with underlying pathway enrichment. Among
  those SDMGs, there are 10 hypermethylated promoters in SDMN including GNA13, CAPNS1,
  GABPB2, GIT2, LEFTY1, NDUFA10, MIOS, MPHOSPH6, PRDM14 and RFWD2. They represent
  the key roles in modulating specific regulatory functions in schizophrenia. The
  thick lines represent the protein-protein interactions, the thin lines are binary
  relations (such as biochemical reactions) between genes in Pathway Commons. The
  zig-zag lines stand for both protein-protein interactions and binary relations.
  The green and red nodes stand for hypo- and hypermethylated genes respectively.
  The yellow nodes are depicted as hypermethylated promoters. The V-arrow nodes are
  depicted as under-expression genes and the triangular nodes are depicted as over-expression
  genes
