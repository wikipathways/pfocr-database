caption: Possible mechanism for endothelial–smooth muscle cross-talk via the myoendothelial
  junctions (MEJs) in pulmonary hypertension exemplified by serotonin actions. Serotonin
  is synthesized primarily from l-tryptophan (l-Trp) by tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1)
  in the ECs (). It may diffuse to the VSMCs through MEJs and dissociate transforming
  growth factor β (TGF-β) from latency-associated peptide (LAP), resulting in the
  binding of TGF-β to its receptor (R) activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) (, ),
  which leads to increased vascular smooth muscle remodeling through the activation
  of similar mothers against decapentaplegic protein (SMAD) signaling (, , ) and phosphorylated
  TGF–associated kinase 1 (TAK1-p)–MAPK signaling pathways (). Serotonin may also
  stimulate the production of superoxide anions by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate reduced oxidase (NOX) in VSMCs (, ). The increased number of superoxide
  anions may diffuse into ECs through MEJs and may lead to eNOS uncoupling and reduced
  NO bioavailability and the resultant decreased activation of sGC–cGMP signaling
  (). Accordingly, the antiproliferation effect of the NO–cGMP–cGMP-dependent protein
  kinase pathway is diminished. The thick and thin arrows denote enhanced and suppressed
  activity, respectively. The red and green arrows denote stimulatory and inhibitory
  effects, respectively.
