caption: a In healthy vasculatures, angiogenic endothelial cell-derived PDGF-BB promotes
  pericyte recruitment. b In FGF-2+ tumors, tumor-derived FGF-2 stimulates endothelial
  PDGF-BB and PDGF-DD production through the FGFR1 signaling pathway. In addition
  to endothelial function, FGF-2 stimulates pericyte proliferation and migration through
  the direct pericyte effect on the FGFR-2 signaling and indirect mechanism by sensitizing
  PDGFRβ signaling on pericytes. c The FGF-2-FGFR1 endothelial and FGF-2-FGFR2 pericyte
  signaling pathways in vascular remodeling. EC, endothelial cell; PC, pericyte; TC,
