caption: 'Pathway map of differentially expressed genes involved in cytidine synthesis
  across the comparison groups: A glycolytic pathway; B TCA cycle; C cytidine synthesis
  pathways. Each pathway is colour-coded to reflect the corresponding comparison groups.
  In the figure, K denotes strain K12, B denotes strain K12ΔpoxB, and A denotes strain
  K12ΔpoxBΔpta. “UP” indicates upregulation of gene expression, and “DOWN” indicates
  downregulation of gene expression'
