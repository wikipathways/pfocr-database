caption: Proposed mechanism of CD147-induced cytokine production and mediated invasion
  in CCA. Roles of soluble CD147 are demonstrated. The involvements of NF-κB translocation
  and CD147 homophilic interaction in the CD147-dependent mechanism are suggested.
  Modulation of CD147, NF-κB translocation, or proinflammatory cytokine actions might,
  therefore, slow the disease progression and improve the prognosis.
