caption: Schematic overview of cell death pathways affected by Coxiella burnetii effector
  proteins. Relevant sections of different cell death pathways and the interference
  of C. burnetii T4SS effector proteins (green boxes) with these pathways are shown.
  The anti-apoptotic effector protein AnkG migrates to the nucleus (blue circle),
  is imported, and fulfills its activity by a hitherto unknown mechanism. CaeB is
  localized to the ER (light blue oval) and possibly also to the mitochondrium (petrol
  box). CaeB inhibits apoptosis by interference with the mitochondrial pathway after
  Bax/Bak activation and inhibition of MOMP (light purple star). CaeA is localized
  in the nucleus, but acts far downstream in the apoptotic pathway by inhibiting the
  activation of Caspase-7 (interrupted line). Furthermore, an infection with C. burnetii
  facilitates the dimerization of Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 by an unknown mechanism to inhibit
  cell death. Additionally, there is an influence on cAMP signaling leading to phosphorylation
  of Bad, which is recruited to the Coxiella-containing vacuole (CCV; red circle)
  thereby inhibiting its pro-apoptotic features. The p38 signaling pathway is also
  influenced, leading to anti-apoptotic transcription/translation activity. C. burnetii
  also inhibits Caspase-11 activation via the effector protein IcaA. Hence, there
  is no inflammasome formation and no Caspase-1 activation, which in concert prevents
  pyroptosis. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is depicted as an orange box, which
  interacts with cellular pattern recognition receptors (purple box). Other cellular
  proteins are also represented by purple boxes.
