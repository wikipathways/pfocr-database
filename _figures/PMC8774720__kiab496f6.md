caption: 'Upregulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway by fungal infection.
  A, Expression of genes putatively involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway
  in damaged and water-treated control leaves (DAM) or in damaged and B. maydis-infected
  leaves (SLB) of W22 after 4 d of treatment. Transcriptomes were sequenced and mapped
  to the Z. mays W22 NRGene V2 genome. RPKM values (means; n = 4) for each gene are
  shown as a heat map next to the gene abbreviation: DAM (left column) and SLB (right
  column). For statistics, corresponding gene abbreviations and gene IDs see . B,
  Quantitative LC–MS/MS analysis of representative flavonoids in the same samples.
  Metabolite amounts are given in microgram per gram fresh weight for DAM (left column)
  and SLB (right column). RPKM, reads per kilobase per million reads mapped.'
