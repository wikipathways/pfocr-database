caption: 'Summary of the FAN1-MLH1 complex interaction and a plausible model for its
  involvement in ICL and slip-out repair. (A) Scheme of the FAN1-MLH1 interaction
  in different states of wt or mutated FAN1. Protein orientation is unknown and arbitrarily
  presented for ease. (B) Left: FAN1 is subjected to CDK-mediated phosphorylation
  at S126 located within the MIP box. Right: Regulation of FAN1-MLH1 interaction through
  the cell cycle and in response to ICL damage. (C) Top: The FAN1-MLH1 complex localizes
  to ICL damaged chromatin to preserve genome stability and ensure cell viability.
  In cells, devoid of the FAN1-MLH1 interaction aberrant ICL repair and cell death
  ensues. Inactivation of FAN1’s endo- and exonuclease activities by mutating D960A
  or inhibition of FAN1 dimerization, affecting FAN1’s endo- but not exonucleolytic
  activity, would alleviate the toxicity of the FAN1 MIP/MIM-mutated variant and promote
  cell proliferation and survival. Bottom: Inhibition of the FAN1-MLH1 interaction
  (MIP*/MIM*) blocks repair of slipped-DNAs. Repair defects were rescued when the
  MLH1-interacting–defective FAN1 was also defective either in both its endonuclease
  activities or in dimer formation (endo- but not exonuclease defective). Therefore,
  the regulatory aspects of the FAN1 binding to MLH1 aligns the pathway of ICL repair
  with that of slipped-DNA processing. Mutations: MIP*, Y128A/F129A; MIM*, L155A/L159A;
  nd*, D960A; dim*, K525E/R526E/K528E.'
