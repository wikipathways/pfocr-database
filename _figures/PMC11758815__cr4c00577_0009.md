caption: Copper signaling. Copper is taken up into the cell via Ctr1 and DMT1. Copper(II)
  is also internalized by means of CD44/hyaluronan-mediated endocytosis. Copper(II)
  is reduced into copper(I) by the metal reductases STEAP. Intracellular copper is
  transported to mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. Copper can bind to chaperone
  proteins, such as CCS and ATOX1. CCS is responsible for the delivery of copper to
  SOD1, and ATOX1 to the delivery of copper to transporters ATP7A and ATP7B. Known
  copper storage proteins include MT1, MT2, and MT3. The cuprophore elesclomol enables
  the trafficking of copper to the mitochondria. Binding of copper to lipoylated components,
  such as DLAT and DLST, triggers cuproptosis. Mitochondrial copper allows the reduction
  of hydrogen peroxide by NADH to produce NAD+, which is required for the activity
  of several mitochondrial enzymes and the production of metabolites such as α-KG
  and acetyl-CoA, controlling epigenetic and transcriptional programs of inflammation
  and cancer metastasis. Copper can modulate signal transduction pathways by binding
  to growth factors, kinases, or phosphatases. Copper is exported outside of the cell
  by ATP7A and ATP7B. In the presence of high copper level, PLEKHA proteins bind to
  PDZD11, and then PLEKHA–PDZD11 complexes target ATP7A to the cell membrane. In the
  presence of a high copper level, ATP7B shuttles from the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes
  and imports copper. Ceruloplasmin is a copper-carrying protein in the blood. See
