caption: TRPV1 antagonist-induced hyperthermia involves BAT-mediated thermogenesis.
  Proposed schematic illustrates acute BAT activation following TRPV1 antagonist-induced
  hyperthermia. Sensory nerves and sympathetic nerves innervate BAT, suggested to
  mediate feedback loops serving a proposed pathway for crosstalk. Brown adipocytes
  have been shown to express TRP channels, including TRPV1 (). AMG9810 transiently
  disrupts this feedback loop (1), causing hyperthermia mediated via an increase in
  sympathetic activity and NA release (2). NA stimulates β-adrenoceptors and initiates
  downstream signaling resulting in heat generation. SN-SS, sensory nerve-sympathetic
  system; TG, triglyceride; FFA, free fatty acid.
papertitle: The sympathetic nervous system is controlled by transient receptor potential
  vanilloid 1 in the regulation of body temperature.
