caption: (a) Th17 cells from blood and peripheral tissues are recruited into the tumor
  environment. Tumor-associated myeloid antigen-presenting cells (APCs) secrete IL-1
  and IL-23, which results in Th17 cell expansion. (b) Th17 cells express polyfunctional
  cytokines including IL-17 and IFNγ. (c) Th17 cell-derived IL-17, IFNγ, along with
  Th1-derived IFNγ, stimulates expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in the tumor environment.
  (d) These chemokines recruit T cells and NK cells into the local environment, where
  they execute antitumor responses. (e) Treg cells are enriched in the tumor environment,
  which suppress Th17 cell expansion through an adenosinergic pathway. This model
  is based on published information.
