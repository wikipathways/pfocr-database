caption: 'Potential mechanisms of action of lactic acid bacteria in pathways of apoptosis
  [,]. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by FAS ligand-induced activation of death
  receptors on the cell membrane (e.g., TNF—tumor necrosis factor). The intrinsic
  pathway is induced radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The mitochondrial localization
  and activation of Bax and Bak are required in the intrinsic pathway. However, it
  can be prevented by pharmacologic inhibitors or anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins.
  Lactic acid bacteria can enhance the apoptosis induction through 5-fluorouracile
  (5-FU) that can induce the activation of autophagic cell death promoted by the induction
  of Beclin-1 and GRP78 or Bcl-2 and Bak. Moreover, LAB may act to prevent cancer
  via downregulating NF-κB-dependent gene products which regulate cell survival (Bcl-2,
  Bcl-xl) and proliferation (Cox-2, cyclin D1). Symbols: →activation; →inhibition.'
