caption: Major flowering pathway genes of Arabidopsis thaliana. Positive and negative
  regulatory connections are indicated by arrows and lines with T-ends, respectively.
  White and black arrows or T-ends indicate regulatory connections occurring primarily
  under long days and short days, respectively. Gene name abbreviations are explained
  in Supplementary Table .
