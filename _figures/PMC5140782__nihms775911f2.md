caption: 'Oncogenic BRAF activity induces formation of ketone body acetoacetate, which
  enhances MAPK pathway activity by promoting binding between BRAFV600E and MEK1.
  Inhibition of oncogenic BRAF de-represses MITF expression leading to increased mitochondrial
  biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation due to enhanced expression of the master
  mitochondrial regulator PGC1α, which also suppresses glycolysis. High PGC1α levels
  are critical for survival and tumorigenesis of a subset of melanomas relying heavily
  on oxidative metabolism by upregulating expression of ROS detoxification genes,
  thus mitigating oxidative stress. NRAS activation by mutations or loss of activity
  of the NF1 tumor suppressor can contribute to the activation of the MAPK pathway.
  Abbreviations: HMGCL - 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, OXPHOS – genes encoding
  proteins participating in TCA cycle activity, oxidative phosphorylation and ATP
  production in mitochondria, ROS – reactive oxygen species, BRAFi – inhibitors of
  BRAFV600E activity, I – V – mitochondrial complexes 1 through 5.'
