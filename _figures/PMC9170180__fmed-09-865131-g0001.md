caption: 'Wnt, Hippo, and Notch signaling in an intestinal stem cell [inflammatory
  bowel disease (IBD) condition]. The disrupted intestinal epithelial barrier promotes
  a leaky gut in inflammatory conditions, such as IBD. In this state, differentiation-related
  pathways, such as Wnt, Hippo, and Notch, are dysregulated in intestinal stem cells.
  The Wnt signaling pathway plays a vital role in the intestinal epithelium and downregulation
  of β-catenin disrupts the differentiation of secretory cells in IBD. The Hippo pathway
  regulates cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, and stemness. An improved amount
  of nuclear YAP/TAZ occurred in IBD and increased the proliferation of undifferentiated
  intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and a lack of secretory cells. In contrast, cytoplasmic
  YAP/TAZ overexpression is seen in inflamed tissue. Also, MST1/2 is downregulated
  and disorganized villus structures and increased undifferentiated cells and dysplastic
  epithelia. However, it is controversial that Hippo pathway is upregulated or downregulated
  in IBD. The Notch pathway regulates the differentiation and development of cells,
  tissues, and organs by interactions among nearby cells. Upregulation of the Notch
  pathway in IBD inhibits differentiation of secretory cell lineages and abnormality
  in the expression of NICD in ulcers reduces the quantity of goblet cells in patients
  with ulcerative colitis (UC). Red arrows show crosstalk between these three pathways
  and dotted lines display downregulated pathways and molecules. Abbreviations: low-density-lipoprotein-related
