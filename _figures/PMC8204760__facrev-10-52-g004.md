caption: 'Left: The 5-HT6 receptor binds to several proteins of the mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, including mTOR itself and the Ras GTPase-activating
  protein (Ras-GAP) neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Physical association of NF1 with the receptor
  strongly enhances constitutive activation of the Gs–adenylyl cyclase pathway by
  the receptor. Middle: The receptor activates the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)–Cdc42
  signaling pathway in an agonist-independent manner to promote the initiation of
  neurite growth. Dissociation of the 5-HT6 receptor–Cdk5 complex allows the recruitment
  of G-protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (GPRIN1) by the receptor (right
  panel), which mediates constitutive activation of the Gs–adenylyl cyclase–protein
  kinase A (PKA) pathway, thereby promoting neurite elongation and branching. *Constitutively
  active receptor. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Ser, serine.'
