caption: FOXO1 regulates activation and function of dendritic cells. (A) FoxO1 nuclear
  localization is stimulated by activation of the MAP kinase pathway (JNK, p38, and
  ERK). In the nucleus FOXO1 affects DC function by increasing expression of genes
  such as ICAM1, CCR7, APRIL, BLYS, IL-1-β, IL-6, IL12, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and αvβ3. The
  change in gene expression promotes DC homing to the lymph nodes, antigen presentation,
  DC activation of T-and B- cells, and inflammation. (B) Cytokine receptors and pattern
  recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) stimulate activation of
  FOXO1 through the MAP kinase pathway. Activated FOXO1 can bind to the promoter region
  of target genes and regulate transcription. AKT is a major downstream target of
  PI3K that functions as a negative regulator of FOXO1. Stimulation of mTOR activates
  AKT to inhibit FoxO1 activity, which has been proposed to prevent a hyperinflammatory
  response.
