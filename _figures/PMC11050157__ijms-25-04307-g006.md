caption: Diagram showing the effect of obesity and T2DM on the molecular pathways
  leading to skeletal muscle atrophy and involvement of NGF. An increased level of
  myostatin leads to the translocation of FoxO1 transcription factor, which induces
  muscle degeneration by increasing MuRF1, p62, and LC3BII. NGF inhibits the action
  of myostatin and enhances phosphorylation of Akt protein which then inhibits the
  translocation of FoxO1 into the nucleus. Moreover, NGF promotes muscle cell regeneration
  by increasing the level of cyclin D1. Arrows represent stimulation; blocked lines
  represent inhibition
