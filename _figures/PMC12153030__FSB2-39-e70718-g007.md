caption: 'The hypothetical model of effect on ISGs exocytosis by short‐term and long‐term
  treatment with BBR. Upper: Under high‐glucose stimulation, short‐term treatment
  with BBR for β‐cells increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration through blocking
  KCNH6 channel, which subsequently affects ISG exocytosis. Lower: Long‐term treatment
  with BBR not only exerts its effects through the inhibition of KCNH6 channel but
  also by activating the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway. This activation leads to
  an upregulation of SNARE‐associated protein transcription, resulting in increased
  expression of Munc18‐1, Syntaxin‐1a, and VAMP2 proteins. Consequently, this enhances
  the capacity of ISG docking and fusion, thereby promoting ISG exocytosis'
