caption: Schematic presentation showing the HMGB1 release from the nucleus due to
  the necrotic cell death under oxidative stress conditions. The HMGB1 secretion enhanced
  the inflammation and initiated a cascade of signal transduction for the release
  of proinflammatory cytokines. The secreted extracellular HMGB1 molecule structurally
  consists thiols cysteine residues in its DNA binding A and B domains. The reduced
  form of HMGB1 acts as chemoattractant for leukocytes recruitment at the inflamed
  site. Under oxidative stress conditions, extracellular HMGB1 is readily oxidized
  and primarily forms disulphide linkage between adjacent cysteine molecules 23 and
  45 on A-box. The disulphide form of HMGB1 actively stimulates the proinflammatory
  cytokine production via binding to RAGE receptor [,]. The HMGB1 is itself considered
  as DAMP molecule because it forms highly inflammatory complex in association with
  ssDNA, necrotic cell debris, IL-1ß etc. The secreted HMGB1 directly act onto the
  activated infiltrated immune cells which reach immediately at the necrotic site.
  The primary infiltered immune cells i.e. neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes possess
  cell surface receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) specific for HMGB1
  binding []. RAGE is a transmembrane receptor protein mainly present on immunoglobulin
  superfamily. RAGE–HMGB1 complex contributes to the induction of proinflammatory
  genes and lethal shock signalling []. The complex triggers the activation of NF-kB,
  ERK, PI3/AKT signalling and stimulates the gene expression of various IL-6, TNF-a,
  macrophages inflammatory proteins (MIP) 1a and 1ß proteins etc. [,].Cumulative effect
  of continuous rising oxidative stress as well as of tissue damage leads to the irreversible
  complete oxidation of all cys residues of HMGB1 A and B boxes. The sulphonic (oxidized)
  form of HMGB1 modifies its functional activity i.e. abrogates pro-inflammatory cytokine
  production and chemoattractant property. The oxidized HMGB1 promotes the tissue
  regeneration and survival response. It was demonstrated invivo and in vitro that
  complete oxidation of HMGB1 acted as a feedback mechanism to counter the inflammatory
  activity and tissue damage [,].
