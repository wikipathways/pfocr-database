caption: The bulky isopropyl group could not be installed using standard Grignard
  reaction conditions to make 11h, either with or without CeCl3. Consequently, the
  2-propenyl intermediate (12g) was hydrogenated to the isopropyl analogue (12h),
  and the synthesis of 1h was completed as usual ().
