caption: 'Proposed model for the repressive actions of KLF9 and KLF13 on cAMP-dependent
  neurite-outgrowth. Neurite-outgrowth is promoted by activation of the cAMP signaling
  pathway. Experimentally, we used forskolin to activate adenylate cyclase (AC) and
  3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to inhibit phosphodiesterase. KLF9 and/or KLF13
  repress the expression of several genes of the cAMP signaling pathway. Shown in
  the figure are the proteins that would be affected by KLF9 and KLF13 gene repression.
  Adenylate cyclase 6 (ADCY6), calmodulin 3 (CALM3), protein kinase A alpha subunit
  (PRKACA) and Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (also known as EPAC1). CNGC:
  cyclic nucleotide gated channel; CaM: calmodulin; CaMKs: calmodulin-dependent kinases;
  PKA: protein kinase A; RAP1A: Ras-related protein 1a; RAF1: v-raf-leukemia viral
  oncogene 1; MEK: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; ERK1/2: extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2; CREB: cAMP response element-binding protein; CBP:
  CREB-binding protein; +p: phosphorylation.'
