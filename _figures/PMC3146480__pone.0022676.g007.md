caption: MC-RR exposure caused aberrant expression of dre-miR-126 and dre-miR-31.
  Downregulation of dre-miR-126 can resulted in the upregulation of PI3KR2 and SPRED1,
  two negative regulators of the VEGF signaling pathway, upregulation of dre-miR-31
  can lead to reduced venous sprouting. Dre-miR-126 and dre-miR-31 pathways may together
  cause significantly decreased number of complete ISVs in zebrafish embryos. In this
  model, continuous lines show steps confirmed in this study or elsewhere; the dashed
  lines represent processes that have not been proved by direct evidence.
