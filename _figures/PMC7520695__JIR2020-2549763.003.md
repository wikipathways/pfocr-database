caption: Signaling pathway of IL-1β and IL-18. IL-1β molecules are released in the
  cytosol and bind to IL-1R1 receptor in order to form a heterodimer with IL-1RAP.
  IL-1R is phosphorylated by MyD88 and IRAKs; thus, TRAF-6 are activated and able
  to further activate specific MAP kinases and NF-κB. Then, NF-κB is translocated
  to the nucleus and initiates the transcription of proinflammatory molecules. Similar
  to IL-1β, the IL-18 molecules follow a parallel pathway with the same outcome of
  production of proinflammatory molecules (image created in https://BioRender.com).
