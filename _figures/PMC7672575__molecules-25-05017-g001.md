caption: The schematic mechanism of replication of SARS-CoV-2 into host cell. Spike
  (S) protein on the surface of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
  recognizes the ACE2 receptor on the cellular membrane of host cell. After receptor
  binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by transmembrane
  protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), followed by fusion of the viral and
  cellular membranes. The conformational changes at the S1 and S2 subunits facilitate
  the virus–cell fusion via the endosomal pathway. The viral genome is released into
  the cytoplasm and translated through the ribosomal frame, shifting to generate replicas
  polyproteins pp1a and pp1b. Negative-sense RNA intermediates are generated to serve
  as the templates for the synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA (gRNA) and sub-genomic
  RNAs (sgRNAs). The gRNA is packaged by the structural proteins to assemble progeny
  virions. Shorter sgRNAs encode conserved structural and accessory proteins. Following
  gRNA and sgRNA synthesis, the viral proteins and genome RNA are inserted into virions
  and assembled in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and then transported
  in the vesicle to the plasma membrane before releasing out via exocytosis pathway
  [,,,,].
