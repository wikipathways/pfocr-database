caption: Human hair follicles display HPA axis-like regulatory feedback systems. Affected
  by hair stress-sensors, the sympathetic nerve activity elevates to different degrees,
  showing neuroendocrine production and release of corticotropin releasing hormone
  (CRH), which leads to signal transduction pathway enhances the production and secretion
  of the anterior pituitary-derived POMC peptides, ACTH, and β-endorphin. Meanwhile,
  the glucocorticoid receptor agonist cortisol down-regulates follicular CRH expression
  as an adaptive response to stabilize and restore the general homeostasis.
