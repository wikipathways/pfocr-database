caption: Molecular mechanisms of peripheral sensitization in cancer pain. The tumor
  microenvironment constitutes a dynamic cellular ecosystem that secretes multiple
  algogenic mediators that collectively induce peripheral sensitization of tumor-innervating
  sensory neurons. Pro-nociceptive factors including CCL2, PGE2, GM-CSF, IL-6, TNF-α
  and IL-1β bind to their cognate receptors, triggering downstream phosphorylation
  events that lower neuronal activation thresholds. This results in enhanced signal
  transduction through downstream pathways. Concurrently, Nav1.7 undergoes phosphorylation-induced
  activation while Kv7 experiences functional downregulation. These changes synergize
  with TRPV1 sensitization and Ca2⁺3.2 activation to generate ectopic action potentials.
  The resultant neuronal hyperexcitability manifests clinically as spontaneous pain
  and mechanical hyperalgesia
