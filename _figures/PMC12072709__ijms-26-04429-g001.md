caption: A schematic presentation of the two hypotheses offered to explain how energy
  metabolism supports brain activation. (A) The astrocyte–neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS)
  hypothesis [19], suggesting that the energy substrate, lactate, which supports neural
  activity, originates from astrocytic glycolysis that is induced by glutamate uptake
  and activation of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. The astrocytic lactate produced is shuttled
  via monocarboxylate transporters to the active neuron where it is used oxidatively
  (mitochondrially) in support of the neural activity. Hu and Wilson [41] showed that
  lactate is the main substrate used during neural stimulation and that the oxygen
  necessary for its utilization is present in the tissue parenchyma outside of the
  blood vasculature and is plentiful. (B) The efficiency tradeoff hypothesis [68]
  suggests that aerobic glycolysis (nonoxidative glucose consumption and lactate production)
  is the process that supplies the active neural tissue with the necessary energy.
  Although glycolysis is an inefficient metabolic pathway, the hypothesis claims that
  the speed by which glycolysis produces ATP, as compared to the slower oxidative
  phosphorylation, trades speed for efficiency, which is necessary for the support
  of brain activation. This hypothesis was constructed to explain the lack of oxygen
  consumption detected when the BOLD fMRI technique was used during brain activation.
  The technique measures the level of deoxyhemoglobin in red blood cells carried by
  blood capillaries, and is not the direct measurement of tissue oxygen that an oxygen
  electrode affords. The efficient tradeoff hypothesis still contends that under aerobic
  conditions at rest, pyruvate is the glycolysis end-product
