caption: Translation initiation control relays signals to erythroid and granulocytic
  differentiation. SCF binds c-kit, a Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs), activating
  PI3K/mTOR pathway in the same way as constitutive active mutant RTKs and kinase
  active fusion protein, BCR/ABL. mTOR downstream effector proteins are maintained
  active by attenuating the phosphatase Pp2a which is inhibited by SCF-driven alpha4
  expression and enhanced expression of SET in response to BCR/ABL. High activity
  of translation initiation factors enhances polysome recruitment of structured mRNAs
  and delays erythroid terminal differentiation. During erythroid terminal differentiation
  the balance between globin synthesis and haeme biosynthesis is under the tight control
  of translation initiation. Iron Responsive Element (IRE) in the UTRs of ferritin
  and transferrin modulates iron uptake and storage in accordance to demand of haeme.
  Low cellular iron levels trigger phosphorylation of eIF2α to reduce the production
  of globin proteins. High eIFs levels also regulate commitment to the erythroid or
  megakaryocytic lineage by selective usage of AUGs in the SCL transcript driving
  different isoform production. The same mechanism is used to produce truncated isoforms
  of the transcription factor C/EBPα that acts as a dominant negative form of the
  full length and hence inhibits granulocytic terminal differentiation. Another form
  of translation control is involved in regulation of C/EBPα transcription activity.
  Full-length C/EBPα enhances transcription of micro RNA 223 (miRNA-223), an inhibitor
  of NFI-A translation. NFI-A is a competitor for binding C/EBPα DNA sites and hence
  its inhibition results in a positive feedback loop driving granulocytic differentiation.
  In addition to transcription inhibition of full-length C/EBPα driven by selective
  AUG usage or translation silencing of competitors, the role of RNA-binding proteins
  is important in modulating terminal differentiation. BCR/ABL enhances the expression
  of hnRNPE2 that binds the UTR of C/EBPα transcript and inhibits translation.
