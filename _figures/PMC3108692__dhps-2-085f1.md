caption: 'The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) network. mTOR is a central component
  of the phosphoinositide 3′ kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway
  that mediates eukaryotic cell growth and proliferation. The mTOR kinase is the catalytic
  component of two distinct multiprotein complexes called mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)
  and mTORC2. mTORC1 also contains raptor, MLST8, and praline-rich Akt substrate 40
  (PRAS40) (a repressor). In tumor cells, mTORC1 activity is aberrantly elevated.
  Diverse positive and negative growth signals influence the activity level of mTORC1,
  many of which converge upon the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1)/TSC2 complex
  and Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb). PI3K receives activating signals from
  growth factor receptors or it may be activated constitutively in some tumors. Phosphatase
  and tensin homolog (PTEN) reverses the action of PI3K and functions as a tumor suppressor.
  Akt also promotes mTORC1 activity by phosphorylating TSC1/TSC2 and PRAS40, resulting
  in guanosine-5’-triphosphate (GTP) loading of Rheb and suppression of the PRAS40
  repressor. Downstream, mTORC1 phosphorylates the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase
  (p70S6K) (activation) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein
  (4EBP-1) (inhibition of negative regulator) to increase messenger RNA translation
  of specific proteins. mTOR-regulated proteins include D-type cyclins and c-Myc (which
  increase cell proliferation), hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) (which increases
  synthesis of the proangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]),
  various glycolytic enzymes, and growth factors (which can promote cell survival).
  Activation and inhibition induced by direct phosphorylation at one or more sites
  is indicated by a phosphate (P). The mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin, temsirolimus, everolimus,
  deforolimus) inhibit mTORC1 by first binding to the intracellular protein FK506
  binding protein 1A, 12 kDa (FKBP12); the resultant mTOR inhibitor-FKBP12 complex
  then binds mTOR, blocking mTORC1 to inhibit its kinase activity. Through the specific
  inhibition of mTORC1 activity, the mTOR inhibitors display a multifunctional biologic
  activity profile, blocking cell proliferation, cell growth, cell survival, and angiogenesis
  in preclinical tumor models. Figure reprinted with permission from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals,
