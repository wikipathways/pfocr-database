caption: Activation starts with ligand binding to TLR4, which initiates a signaling
  cascade that releases NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus,
  NF-κB mediates the transcription of NLRP3, ASC, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18. Once these
  are transcribed, the inflammasome is considered primed. A second signal, from either
  a pattern or damage activated molecular pathogen (PAMPS or DAMPs), then initiates
  assembly of the inflammasome complex, which then activates caspase-1. Active caspase-1
  then proteolytically cleaves the pro-forms of the cytokines, enabling release of
  the mature cytokines to promote inflammation.
