caption: Recognition of Candida species is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs),
  C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)
  receptors. Both TLR4/TLR2 can induce production of proinflammatory signals and cytokines
  through the MyD88-dependent NF-κ B pathway. However, TLR3-mediated recognition is
  carried out through activation of the IRF3 transcription factor. The CLR receptors,
  such as dectin-1, dectin-2, dectin-3, and Mincle, stimulate the release of inflammatory
  cytokines by activating T cell lineage-specific tyrosine kinase (Syk) and downstream
  complex (CARD9-Bcl10-MALT1). Dectin-1 promotes maturation of inflammasome, so as
  to induce production of cytokines. DC-specific intracellular adhesion molecule-grabbing
  non-integrin (DC-SIGN) receptor can induce TH cell responses through Raf1 activation.
  In addition, NLRP3 stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through an
  Erk dependent pathway, and NOD2 receptor activates inflammasome by affecting maturation
  of IL-1β via caspase-1
