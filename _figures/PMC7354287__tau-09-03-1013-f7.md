caption: Androgen-binding AR inhibits TGF-β-related Pathway. Through binding signal
  molecules to TGF-βreceptors (TGF-βR1 and TGF-βR2), the receptors are phosphorylated
  to activate the SMAD signaling pathway and the non-SMAD signaling pathway. The SMAD
  signaling pathway begins with the co-SMAD gaining phosphorylation from TGF-β receptor,
  and then binding to SMAD4 to form SMAD complex. The complex enters the nucleus and
  binds the transcription factor of Snail gene promoting the expression of Snail1.
  Because Snail1 is the key protein of EMT, it can induce the production of EMT. Non-SMAD
  pathways include TAK1 signaling and PI-3k signaling pathway, etc. The TAk1 signaling
  pathway starts with the phosphorylation of TAK1 factor, which leads to JNK phosphorylation
  acting on c-JUN to regulate the transcriptional activity of cells and promote cell
  proliferation and inhibit cells apoptosis. And PI-3K signaling pathway is caused
  by PI-3K factor binding phosphoric acid which leads to phosphorylation of AKT. Inhibition
  of GSk3βandβ-catenin Phosphorylation by phospho-AKt reduces the degradation of β-catenin,
  and thenβ-catenin converging in nucleus promotes cell proliferation and inhibits
  apoptosis by binding transcription factors. Furthermore, phospho-AKt factors can
  also lead to EMT by directly promoting the expression of EMT-related key proteins.
