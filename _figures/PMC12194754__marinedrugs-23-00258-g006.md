caption: The regulatory mechanism and metabolic pathways of FSP1 in tumor cells. The
  figure illustrates the regulatory mechanism of FSP1 in tumor cells and its metabolic
  pathways. It reveals how FSP1 inhibits lipid peroxidation by consuming NAD(P)H and
  reducing oxidized coenzyme Q, thereby protecting cells from ferroptosis. Additionally,
  it demonstrates the regulatory role of the Nrf2 signaling pathway on FSP1 expression,
  as well as the potential toxic effects of lipid peroxidation products (such as MDA,
  4-HNE, and acrolein) on cells
