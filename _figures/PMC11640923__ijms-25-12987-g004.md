caption: Iron handling in the brain. Iron entry into the brain is strictly regulated
  at the blood–brain barrier (BBB) by the polarized endothelial cells (ECs), which
  is supported by astrocytes. Iron enters ECs through the classical transferrin/transferrin
  receptor (TF/TFRC) endocytic pathway and is released by divalent metal transporter
  1/solute carrier family 11 member 2 (DMT1/SLC11A2) in the cytosol after its reduction
  by six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3 (STEAP3) within endosomes.
  The apo-TF/TFRC complex is then recycled to the cell surface and dissociated; TFRC
  remains in the membrane for further cycles of iron uptake, while TF is recycled
  in the circulation. Alternative routes for iron entry in ECs are the transcytosis
  of holo-TF from the luminal to the abluminal side of ECs or the uptake of ferritin
  by TFRC or T-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain 1 protein (Tim-1). Ferritin and TF
  may be released at the abluminal side of ECs through extracellular vesicles (EVs).
  In ECs, iron may be stored within the ferritin cage or released at the abluminal
  side through ferroportin1/solute carrier family 40 member 1 (FPN1/SLC40A1), which
  is coupled with ferroxidase proteins like ceruloplasmin (CP) and hephaestin (HEPH).
  Astrocytes and choroid plexus express and release hepcidin (HAMP), in this way controlling
  iron entry in the brain through its interaction with FPN1/SLC40A1. The control of
  iron entry is also performed by apo- and holo-TF levels in the extracellular space
  through the regulation of FPN1/SLC40A1 stability and HEPH activity. Astrocytes,
  in direct contact with ECs, uptake iron through DMT1/SLC11A2 and then redistribute
  the metal in the extracellular space through FPN1/SLC40A1 coupled with CP. Iron
  moves in the brain extracellular space bound to citrate or ATP (released by astrocytes)
  or to TF (mainly secreted by oligodendrocytes and the choroid plexus). Mature oligodendrocytes
  acquire iron through ferritin uptake by Tim-1, store iron in ferritin and release
  iron through FPN1/SLC40A1. Microglial cells acquire iron through TF/TFRC endocytosis
  and through DMT1/SLC11A2, store the metal in the ferritin shell and release iron
  through FPN1/SLC40A1 and secreting ferritin. Like for microglia, iron uptake is
  obtained through TF/TFRC endocytosis and through DMT1/SLC11A2 in neurons, which
  store small amounts of iron in ferritin and release excess iron through FPN1/SLC40A1
