caption: Immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) is initiated by transcription
  through the switch μ (Sμ) region and a downstream switch region to which switching
  will occur (shown here to be Sγ3). Activation-induced deaminase (AID) targets the
  non-template single-strand DNA (ssDNA), deaminating cytosine to form uridine. The
  proteins uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)
  of the base excision repair pathway then deglycosylate and excise the uridine to
  generate a single-strand nick. The same reaction occurs on the template strand,
  although less efficiently, and the formation of closely staggered nicks on the two
  DNA strands leads to a DNA double-strand break (DSB). Broken DNA ends from the two
  switch regions are then joined by either classical or alternative non-homologous
  end joining. CSR DSBs activate ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), initiating a
  non-canonical DNA damage response (ncDDR) that regulates CSR and B cell differentiation.
  Phosphorylation of AID by ATM in response to CSR DSBs promotes the association of
  APE1 with AID, leading to more efficient nick formation. ATM activity promotes the
  association of the two switch regions with DSBs. ATM activates the kinase LKB1,
  which inhibits CREB-regulated transcription co-activator 2 (CRTC2), a transcriptional
  co-activator of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1), promoting a plasma
  cell genetic programme. cDDR, canonical DNA damage response; dsDNA, double-strand
  DNA; P, phosphorylation.
