caption: Schematic diagram shows pathways involved in interleukin-1β (IL-1β)–mediated
  cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro. Interleukin-1β signaling induced the release of
  cytochrome c from the mitochondria into cytosol and induced the activation of caspase
  3 to trigger the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway in the cardiomyocytes. Interleukin-1β
  signaling also induced the activation of caspase-independent apoptotic pathways
  through the upregulation of endonuclease G (Endo G) and high-temperature-requirement
  protein A2 (HtrA2/Omi) expression. Simultaneously, IL-1β signaling mediated the
  inhibition of survivin and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), members
  of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins family, to attenuate anti-apoptotic effects
  during cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
