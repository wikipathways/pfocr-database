caption: Discussed in detail in the text, the following key steps are known to be
  involved in trafficking newly synthesized G proteins to the PM. Chaperone proteins
  have been identified for each G protein subunit, and these chaperones are required
  for proper folding and/or initial delivery of the subunit to a membrane. After formation
  of the Gβγ in the cytoplasm, the C-terminal tail (CaaX motif) of Gγ is modified
  with a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl group, and then Gβγ is targeted to the ER. At
  the ER, C-terminal proteolysis and carboxymethylation of Gγ occurs. Gα initially
  binds to Gβγ at either the ER or Golgi and undergoes palmitoylation. The fully lipid
  modified G protein heterotrimer then trafficks to the PM via the Golgi-dependent
  secretory pathway or through an uncharacterized Golgi-independent process
