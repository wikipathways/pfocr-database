caption: 'Sclerostin: an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt-LRP5/6-Fz
  complex elicits a molecular cascade that transfer Axin-mediated destruction complex,
  which is essential to β-catenin degradation, to the plasma membrane. Increased β-catenin
  moves into the nucleus, where it represents the molecular mechanism that β-catenin
  binds to TCF/LEF, which are the main partners of β-catenin to serve the transcriptional
  function of canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Sclerostin inhibits Wnt signaling by
  binding competitively to LRP5/6, thereby promoting the degradation of β-catenin
  mediated by destruction complex, resulting in the interaction between TCF/LEF and
  repressor Groucho/TLE proteins to halt the expression of target genes.'
