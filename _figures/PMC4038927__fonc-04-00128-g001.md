caption: The current model for the potentiation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer
  cells by depolarization. Triggering of TRAIL-R1 (DR4)/TRAIL-R2 (DR5) induces the
  generation and accumulation of mROS, leading to impairment of the ETC function and
  cardiolipin oxidation. Impairment of the ETC complex I/III function decreases H+
  efflux, thereby causing ΔΨm dissipation, i.e., MMD, and additional mROS generation
  and cardiolipin oxidation, thereby forming a positive loop. Cardiolipin oxidation
  and ΔΨm dissipation cooperatively promote the MPT and liberation of sufficient cytochrome
  c to trigger caspase activation and induce apoptosis. TRAIL-resistant cancer cells
  appear to gain considerable tolerance for oxidative stress-mediated activation of
  the intrinsic death pathway. Accumulation of mROS can also promote the formation
  of unfolded or misfolded proteins, thereby provoking ERS responses such as activation
  of the transcriptional factor XBP-1. XBP-1 activation leads to upregulation of the
  surface TRAIL-R2 expression level, thereby enhancing the death signaling. Activation
  of this alternative death pathway may contribute to commit TRAIL-resistant cancer
  cells to apoptosis.
