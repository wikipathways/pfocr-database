caption: Simulated molecular network between EMT and MET. The simulation of molecular
  interactions between EMT or MET hallmarks and the related biological functions of
  participation was conducted through prediction methods, in which gene ontology is
  linked to cytoskeleton remodeling, metastasis, remodeling the microenvironment,
  and embryogenesis-related process. (MET- or EMT-related molecules were downloaded
  from GSEA datasets, and the analyzed interaction map results were output from the
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.).
