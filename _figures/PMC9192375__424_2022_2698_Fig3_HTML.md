caption: Tonic entrainment in the SAN. (A) Scheme of a SAN cell visualizing the signal
  transduction pathway following stimulation by the ANS. Gs protein-coupled beta-1-adrenergic
  receptors (green) are activated by norepinephrine (NE) released from sympathetic
  nerve terminals. Subsequent Gαs signaling stimulates adenylyl cyclases (ACs, gray)
  to synthetize cAMP, which directly activates HCN4 channels. Conversely, Gi protein-coupled
  M2 muscarinic receptors (red) are activated by acetylcholine (ACh) released from
  vagal nerve terminals. Gαi signaling inhibits ACs and thereby reduces the intracellular
  cAMP level, leading to a decrease in HCN4 activity. Similar effects are evoked by
  TRIP8bnano, a synthetic peptide that binds to the CNBD of HCN4 and inhibits cAMP-dependent
  activation of the channel. (B) cAMP-dependent activation of HCN4 reduces the number
  of nonfiring cells in the SAN, which stabilizes the network rhythm during HR acceleration.
  (C) Reduction in cAMP-dependent activation of HCN4 increases the number of nonfiring
  cells in the SAN. Overshooting inhibition leads to bradycardia and SAN dysrhythmia
  due to destabilization of the network rhythm. (D) The tonic entrainment process
  takes place between firing cells (left) and neighboring nonfiring cells (right).
  Pacemaker cells in the nonfiring mode are more hyperpolarized and electrotonically
  draw the flow of cations from more depolarized neighboring cells in the firing mode
  via gap junctions. This slightly depolarizes the nonfiring cells (green arrow) and
  hyperpolarizes the firing cells to the same extent (red arrow)
