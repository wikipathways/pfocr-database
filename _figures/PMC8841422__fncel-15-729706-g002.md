caption: The glymphatic pathway and pathological changes. CSF in periarterial spaces
  flows across the glial basement membrane and astroglial endfeet to enter the brain
  parenchyma. The aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is highly expressed on the endfeet of astrocytes,
  forming the outer wall of the perivascular space (PVS) and facilitating the CSF
  influx into the interstitium. After mixing with interstitial fluid (ISF) and waste
  metabolites, CSF is transported toward to perivenous space in a polarized net fluid
  movement. Ultimately, CSF exits along the lymphatic vessels and arachnoid granulations
  for the removement of solutes from the brain parenchyma accumulated during neural
  activity. Under pathological conditions, the brain may have an impairment on AQP4
  polarization and localization. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), AQP4 depolarization
  leads to the reduction in CSF influx from periarterial space. At the same time,
  the direction of CSF-ISF flow is disrupted or even reversed, which reduces the ability
  and efficiency to transport amyloid β (Aβ) protein. The concentration of Aβ increases
  gradually, and deposition occurs in the brain parenchyma and periarterial space.
  Vascular pathology causes endothelial cell (EC) failure, producing the cell debris
  and protein deposition that gives rise to the obstruction and inflammation of PVS.
  Increased PVS fluid and the abovementioned factors causes enlarged PVS, which then
  leads to a further accumulation of toxic metabolic by-products, such as Aβ and tau.
