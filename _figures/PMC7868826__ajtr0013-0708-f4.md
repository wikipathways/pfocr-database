caption: 'EGF induced A20 expression via the MEK1/MSK1/p-p65 (Ser276) signaling pathway.
  A. EGF activated the MEK1/ERK signaling pathway, resulting in the activation of
  MSK1 and the subsequent phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276, increased p65 activity,
  and increased expression of A20. The inhibition of MEK1 by PD98059 resulted in reduced
  MSK1 phosphorylation, whereas the inhibition of MSK1 by H89 repressed the phosphorylation
  of p65 and the induction of A20. B. Western blot of A20 protein in QSG7701 cells
  pretreated with the MSK1 inhibitor H89 to inhibit the phosphorylation of p65 at
  Ser276 and then treated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for the indicated time. Key: EGF, epidermal
  growth factor; A20, tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3; MEK1; mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase; MSK1, ribosomal protein S6 kinase A5; p, phosphorylated.
  All data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.'
