caption: 'Simplified overview of commonly mutated oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and
  pathways in endocrine cancer. In the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
  (right center), extracellular ligands activate receptor kinases such as RET, VEGFR,
  PDGFR, and others, initiating the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, resulting in
  gene transcription and proliferation. Activating mutations in these proteins lead
  to constitutive signaling. In the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) cascade (right
  side), receptor activation causes activation of Akt, also affecting cellular survival
  and regulating apoptosis. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling promotes
  survival and is stimulated by Akt and repressed by TMEM127. In neurofibromatosis
  type 1, loss of NF1 function prevents termination of RAS signaling. In von Hippel-Lindau
  syndrome, VHL (left top) targets hypoxia-inducible factor proteins for ubiquitination
  (Ub) and proteasomal degradation. When HIF persists due to mutated VHL, continuous
  activation of hypoxia genes leads to angiogenesis and tumor development. In the
  mitochondrion (left side), defects in subunits of complex II, SDHA, B, C, D, and
  assembly factor 2 (AF2), impair electron transport and induce a pseudo-hypoxic state.
  MAX (in nucleus) interacts with MYC and other transcription factors to repress cell
  growth and loss of function allows proliferation. S: succinate, F: fumarate, OH-P:
  hydroxy-proline residue, PIP2,3: Phosphatidylinositol bis- or tris-phosphate. Adapted
  from Fishbein L, Nathanson KL. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: understanding
