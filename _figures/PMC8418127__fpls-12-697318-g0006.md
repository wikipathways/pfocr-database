caption: Biosynthetic pathways of 20-hydroxy-betulinic acid in Lotus japoinucs and
  anti-pathogenic fatty acid falcarindiol in tomato. (A) shows the biosynthesis of
  20-hydroxybetulinic acid from 2,3-oxdiosqaulene by the enzymes encoded by a triterpene
  producing gene cluster in Lotus japonicus. AMY2 (β-amyrin synthase) converts 2,3-oxidosqualene
  into a unique metabolite dihydro-lupeol. Subsequently dihydro-lupeol is converted
  to 20-hydroxy-betulinic acid by two consecutive reactions catalyzed by L. japonicus
  CYP71D353. (B) represents the bioproduction of falcarindiol from the primary metabolite
  linoleic acid by the enzymes of anti-pathogenic fatty acid gene cluster in S. lycopersicum
  (tomato). Linoleic acid is converted to crepenyic acid by acetylenase enzyme encoded
  by Solyc12g100240 gene. Crepenyic acid is converted into dehydrocrepenyic acid by
  a desaturase (Solyc12g100250). Subsequently, dehydrocrepenyic acid is converted
  to falcarindiol by a set of desaturase, hydroxylase, and decarboxylase. Dotted arrows
  represent a multi-step pathway.
