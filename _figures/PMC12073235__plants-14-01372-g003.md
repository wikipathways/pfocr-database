caption: 'Aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway in plants. CM, chorismate mutase
  (* engaging step of the pathway). Arrow represents one biochemical reaction. PPA-AT,
  prephenate aminotransferase. ADT, arogenate dehydratase. ADH, arogenate dehydrogenase.
  In red: inhibition regulatory pathways. Glu, glutamate. Chorismate is converted
  to prephenic acid by the enzyme chorismate mutase (E.C. 5.4.99.5). Prephenate undergoes
  transamination by the enzyme prephenate aminotransferase (E.C. 2.6.1.79), using
  glutamate, producing L-arogenate and 2-oxoglutarate. The enzyme arogenate dehydratase
  (E.C. 4.2.1.91) completes the aromatic ring of the L-arogenate cycle by removing
  the hydroxyl and carboxylic groups attached to it, thus forming phenylalanine and
  generating H2O and CO2. To obtain tyrosine, arogenate is oxidized by the enzyme
  arogenate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.3.1.43) with the cofactor NAD+, producing a molecule
  of CO2 and one of NADH'
