caption: Glycolysis occurs in M1-like macrophages in response to hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α (HIF1α) activation. HIF1α not only promotes glycolysis but also induces
  the expression of genes that encode inflammatory cytokines, notably interleukin-1β
  (IL-1β). The glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 1 has also been shown to directly interact
  with and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to caspase 1 activation and the
  processing of pro-IL-1 β. In T cells, the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GAPDH) binds to mRNA encoding interferon-γ (IFNγ) and represses its
  translation; the switch to glycolysis that occurs in response to T cell activation
  leads to the dissociation of GAPDH allowing for translation of IFNγ. Glycolysis
  is also crucial for the functioning of natural killer (NK), T helper 1 (TH1), TH2,
  TH17 and peripherally induced regulatory T (pTreg) cells. The pentose phosphate
  pathway branches off glycolysis and generates ribose for nucleotides for DNA and
  RNA synthesis, but also NADPH, for NADPH oxidase or for glutathione biosynthesis,
  promoting an antioxidant response. In human pTreg cells, the glycolytic enzyme enolase
  has been shown to promote their suppressive functions by regulating the expression
  of FOXP3 splicing variants containing exon 2 (FOXP3-E2). CARKL, carbohydrate kinase-like
  protein; NLRP3, NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3; PKM2, pyruvate kinase
  isoenzyme M2.
