caption: MAPK and chemokine signaling pathways are influenced by dapagliflozin. The
  red nodes represent the key targets, the orange nodes represent common targets of
  CaD and DKD targets, and the green nodes represent the other targets of these two
  pathways. CaD affects the phosphorylation of MAPK14 in the p38/MAPK pathway. In
  the JNK pathway, CaD affects the phosphorylation of MAPK8 and MAPK10 and it also
  indirectly affects the activation of CASP3. As for the classical MAPK signaling
  pathway, CaD affects the activation of GRB2, HRAS, RAF1, and the phosphorylation
  of MEK and ERK. The chemokine signaling pathway is closely related to the classical
  MAPK signaling pathway. CaD inhibits the expression of CCL5. CaD inhibits apoptosis,
  oxidative stress, and inflammation by inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway and
  the chemokine signaling pathway, thereby exerting a therapeutic effect on DKD.

  description: MAPK and chemokine signaling pathways are influenced by dapagliflozin.
    The red nodes represent the key targets, the orange nodes represent common targets
    of CaD and DKD targets, and the green nodes represent the other targets of these
    two pathways. CaD affects the phosphorylation of MAPK14 in the p38/MAPK pathway.
    In the JNK pathway, CaD affects the phosphorylation of MAPK8 and MAPK10 and it
    also indirectly affects the activation of CASP3. As for the classical MAPK signaling
    pathway, CaD affects the activation of GRB2, HRAS, RAF1, and the phosphorylation
    of MEK and ERK. The chemokine signaling pathway is closely related to the classical
    MAPK signaling pathway. CaD inhibits the expression of CCL5. CaD inhibits apoptosis,
