caption: The schematic model illustrates the mechanism by which HSV-2 UL24 blocks
  the IRF-3 signaling pathway. During HSV-2 infection, the viral dsRNA by-product
  is recognized by RIG-I. Subsequently, RIG-I binds to dsRNA and signals to the adaptor
  protein MAVS. Dimerized MAVS recruits and activates the downstream protein kinase
  complexes TBK-1/IKK-ε, leading to the phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF-3.
  The IRF-3 dimer translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it binds to
  the IFN-β promoter to initiate the transcription of IFN-β. In the case of HSV-2
  infection, the viral late protein UL24 interferes with IRF-3 phosphorylation, leading
  to the blockade of IFN-β production
