caption: An optimal subnetwork of MAPK pathway inferred by Banjo. The optimal network
  is inferred based on i2 interval discretization method. The directed and circlehead
  arrows represent activation and inhibition respectively, the value on each edge
  is influence score or weight describing the interaction between two nodes.
