caption: '(A) Mechanism VI: The macrophages from peritoneum, lung, liver, and spleen
  upregulate more trained immunity (innate immune memory)-related metabolic genes
  than that of adipose tissues, and the macrophages from peritoneum, small intestine,
  and adipose tissues upregulate more trained immunity-related metabolic genes than
  bone marrow macrophages (For detailed expression data, see ). (B) Ingenuity pathway–Venn
  Diagram analyses show that the macrophages (Mφ) from peritoneum, lung, liver, spleen,
  and intestine upregulate more shared trained immunity regulators such as mevalonate
  pathway regulators than Mφ from bone marrow. (C) The expression changes of 19 new
  enzymes involved in intracellular immunometabolism pathways (IMPs) and trained immunity
  pathways (TIPs) of M1 Mφ and 6 new enzymes involved in IMPs and TIPs of M2 Mφ may
  be the mechanisms underlying the higher M1 Mφ proinflammatory status of lung, liver,
  spleen, and intestine and the disease group-specific pathways and shared disease
  pathways (PMIDs:28381829; 27396447;26694790; 30679807; 28396078). The green boxes
  are bioenergetics pathways (), and the blue boxes are trained immunity pathways
  (A). SLC1A5, GLUT1, LDH, PDH, ACLY, and CPT1A are mentioned in previous studies.
  However, IDH is found to decrease in M1, but not sure in M2. *25 others (bolded
  and underlined) are not found in the reviews listed above.'
