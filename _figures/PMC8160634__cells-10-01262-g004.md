caption: HUWE1 influences the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. (1) In response to irreparable
  DNA damage, p53 is activated via ATM-mediated phosphorylation and HAT-mediated acetylation.
  HDAC2 inhibits acetylation of p53. The pro-apoptotic BAK/BAX are stimulated by p53
  activation and via p53 independent mechanisms. This subsequently results in mitochondrial
  pore formation and the cytoplasmatic release of cyt c to effectuate apoptosis. The
  anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 inhibits BAK/BAX. (2) HUWE1 negatively regulates p53, Mcl-1,
  and HDAC2 via polyubiquitination. HUWE1 positively regulates ATM phosphorylation
  via polyubiquitination. HUWE1 depletion could result in cellular immortalization
  and resistance to platins via target overexpression and subsequent ineffective activation
  of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
