caption: 'As shown in “A”, the administration of sumatriptan (a 5-HT1B/D receptor
  agonist), applied at the terminal of the IB4-positive nociceptor, triggers the events
  that will lead to mechanical hyperalgesia and the development of type I hyperalgesic
  priming. Activation of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors by administration of sumatriptan
  and the following activation of G-protein αi subunit (Gαi), ultimately producing
  neuroplastic changes that are expressed as prolongation of the PGE2-induced hyperalgesia.
  B. PGE2-induced hyperalgesia, which is dependent only on PKA in the normal state
  [], in the primed state is prolonged due to activation of an additional pathway
  involving PKCε and protein translation. Abbreviations: 1B, 5-HT1B receptor subtype;
  1D, 5-HT1D receptor subtype; PKCε, protein kinase C epsilon; PGE2, prostaglandin-E2.'
