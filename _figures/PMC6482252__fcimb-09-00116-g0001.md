caption: Mechanism of foam cell formation. LDL is taken up inside the cell via the
  low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Digestion of the cholesterol esters (CE)
  in LDL inside the lysosome releases free cholesterol (FC) which undergoes efflux
  via ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1 or ABCG1, or enter the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) where they are esterified to form lipid droplets by acyl CoA acetyl
  transferase 1 (ACAT-1) FC could also cause persistent stress to the ER which ultimately
  results in excess nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) signaling and apoptosis. Excess
  FC inside the cells can also result in the formation of cholesterol crystals (CC)
  causing toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and downstream signaling events. OxLDL
  is taken up via scavenger receptors such as CD36, scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1) and
  LOX1, and induces ROS generation and cytokine secretion. Components of oxLDL are
  ligands for the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) which increases
  the intake of more OxLDL via upregulation of CD36. Activation of PPARγ triggers
  liver X receptor signaling which facilitates lipid efflux via upregulation of ABCAI,
  blocking of this pathway along with accumulation of OxLDL/FC results in the macrophage
  transforming into a foam cell. Mycobacteria entering the cell via the cell surface
  receptors are taken up by phagosomes and associate with lipid droplets and assimilate
  them facilitating their survival in the host cell whose lipid metabolism is further
  impacted by the mycobacteria.
