caption: 'The effects of PUFAs related to the steps involved in the carcinogenic process.
  In the first stage of carcinogenesis, initiation: PUFAs regulate reactive oxygen
  species generation; EPA and DHA increase mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm);
  Peroxidized EPA and DHA suppress iNOS followed by nitric oxide (NO) production;
  The increased AA to DHA ratio inhibits ATP production. In the second stage, n–3
  PUFAs, including ALA, EPA and its derivatives such as F4-Neuroprostanes (F4-NeuroPs),
  are able to inhibit cancer cell growth and proliferation. During the progression
  stage: n–3 PUFAs and PGE3 influence tumor progression by inhibiting neovascularization
  by decreasing MMP, HIF-1α, VEGF and Ang2. Moreover, n–3 PUFAs are able to inhibit
  tumor progression through ROS-dependent apoptosis of pro-tumorigenic tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs). On the other hand, the n–6 PUFAs derivative, PGE2, increases
  Ang2 and metaloproteinaase-9 (MMP-9) expression, followed by inducing angiogenesis.
  Metastasis is also regulated by PUFAs by inducing apoptosis and pyroptosis by caspase
  pathway activation. The specialized pro-resolving mediator, RvD1, is able to inhibit
  metastasis.'
