caption: Both 5HT creatinine complex (1; 5HT) and the NO donor DEANO (2; NO) increased
  the fictive locomotor frequency recorded from Pd-7 swim interneurons that comprise
  the Clione locomotor CPG and control the dorsal movement of the parapodia during
  swimming. Each action potential of a Pd-7 swim interneuron synaptically produces
  a single burst of action potentials in synergistic motoneurons, and each burst of
  action potentials produced by the motoneuron contributes to the contraction of synergistic
  muscle fibers in the parapodia. Thus, the increase in action potential frequency
  in Pd-7 swim interneurons directly correlates to the frequency of parapodial movements.
  Application of the cGMP analog, 8-Br-cGMP (4) increased swim frequency. Hence, we
  hypothesize that 5HT and NO may produce their effects on Pd-7 swim interneurons
  through a common signaling pathway mediated by cGMP or alternatively through separate,
  but parallel pathways that converge to produce a common result. Our data suggest
  the later hypothesized mechanism. ODQ (3), an inhibitor of sGC, the enzyme that
  synthesizes cGMP from GTP, when applied inhibited NO-induced but not 5HT-induced
  swim acceleration (these results are shown in ). Similarly, 5HT is capable of inducing
  swim acceleration when the PKG inhibitor, Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMP (5) is applied, indicating
  that 5HT contributes to swim acceleration without the activation of PKG. It is unknown
  what signaling mechanism mediates 5HT-induced swim acceleration (?), and experiments
  are planned to elucidate these details. Because the effect of 5HT is blocked by
  the 5HT antagonist, mianserin, the most likely serotonin receptor involved is the
  5HT2-like receptor, a metabotropic receptor that is linked to phospholipase C signal
  transduction mechanisms (). While our results show that 5HT is capable of inducing
  swim acceleration independently of cGMP there remains the possibility of cross-talk
  between the serotonergic and nitrergic signaling (;).
