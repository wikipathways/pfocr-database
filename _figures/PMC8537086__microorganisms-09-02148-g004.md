caption: 'Interactome analysis of PknB protein. The PknB molecule interacts with the
  proteins involved in central carbon metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis pathways,
  pentose phosphate pathway, teichoic acid synthesis and the enzymes associated with
  peptidoglycan (PGN) synthesis. Shown are the different types of interactions: Experimentally
  verified substrate for phosphorylation by PknB, experimentally verified protein–protein
  interaction (including data from databases such as the STRING database) and metabolic
  interactions. Proteins interacting directly with PknB are shown with a blue arrow,
  and other interactions are indicated by a black arrow. GlmS, GlmU and GlmR proteins
  are involved in a chain of reactions that regulate central carbon metabolism by
  interacting with PknB (marked with a maroon arrow). The interactions of Fem proteins
  (FemA and FemB) are highlighted with an orange arrow. The doted lines indicate different
  substrates of PknB according to interactome analysis. In the protein interaction
  network, the central role played by GlmR in association with PknB (green) is shown.
  GlmR-GlmS-GlmU proteins participate in the cascade of reactions in response to the
  availability of a nutrient carbon source, thereby regulating different pathways,
  such as peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The proteins marked with an asterisk (*) are
  direct interaction partners by PknB substrate phosphorylation according to [].'
