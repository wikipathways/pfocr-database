caption: The mechanism of the effect of Tim-3 on IFN-γ production by NK and CD4+ T
  cells. Tim-3 can inhibit ERK and NFκB p65 signaling; however, it fails to inhibit
  the NFAT pathway, which is a major pathway promoting IFN-γ production by NK cells.
  Thus the production of IFN-γ in NK cells can be maintained via the NFAT pathway
papertitle: The inhibitory receptor Tim-3 fails to suppress IFN-γ production via the
  NFAT pathway in NK-cell, unlike that in CD4+ T cells.
