caption: Regulation of neural precursor plasticity within the classical neurogenic
  zones. Schematic illustration of example factors and manipulations known to regulate
  cell genesis in the adult subgranular zone (SGZ) (A) and subventricular zone (SVZ)
  (B). Numbers denote examples known to affect lineage decisions at the stage indicated
  in the figure. (A) Stem-cell loss occurs when their proliferation is highly induced,
  such as through Notch and FoxO deletion (1) (; ; ; ), or in aged mice (2) (; ; ).
  Mobilization of quiescent radial glia-like cells (RGLs) occurs during voluntary
  running (3) (; ); brain injury, such as injection of the antimitotic drug Ara-C
  () (4) or seizure-inducing Kainic acid (5) (; ). Molecular inhibitors of RGL activation
  include SFRP3 and GABA signaling (6) (; ). Kainic acid-induced seizures activate
  nonradial progenitor cells (7) (). Increasing Akt signaling or decreasing tonic
  GABA signaling alters the division mode of RGLs, fostering the symmetric fate (8)
  (; ). Ectopic expression of Ascl1 changes the fate of intermediate progenitor cells
  (IPCs) to generate oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) (9) () and demyelination
  injury induces OPC proliferation (10) (; ; ). Stab wound, stroke and ischemic injuries
  activate astrocytes into reactive astroglia (11) (reviewed in ). (B) In the SVZ
  excessive activation (1) (; ; ; ) and aging (2) (; ; ) leads to stem-cell loss.
  Ara-C promotes RGL cell-cycle entry (3) () and stroke injury activates the normally
  quiescent ependymal cells (4) (; ; ). Infusion of EGF increases production of astroglia
  and OPCs while reducing proliferation of IPCs (5) (; ). Demyelination injury increases
  OPC proliferation (6) and doublecortin (DCX)+ neural progenitors to swich fate into
  OPCs (7) (; ; ; ). Manipulation of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway can
  change the fate of a subset of neural progenitors from granule cell (GC) neurons
  to periglomerular cell (PGC) neurons (8) (). Stab wound, stroke, and ischemic injuries
  activate astrocytes into reactive astroglia (9) (reviewed in ).
