caption: The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is physiologically
  activated by binding of growth factors to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such
  RET and NTRK, resulting in receptor dimerization and activation via autophosphorylation
  of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain. The activated receptor, through
  a series of adaptor proteins, leads to activation of RAS located at the inner face
  of the plasma membrane. The activated RAS binds to and recruits RAF proteins (mainly
  BRAF in thyroid follicular cells) to the plasma membrane. Activated BRAF phosphorylates
  and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK), which in turn
  phosphorylates and activates the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Activated
  ERK translocates into the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of the genes
  involved in cell differentiation, proliferation and survival. Alterations of this
  pathway in thyroid cancer can occur at different levels as a result of point mutation
  or rearrangement involving the RET, RAS, and BRAF genes.
