caption: 'The different steps of egress and their kinetics (green arrows) determined
  in this study are depicted. On top, the molecular signaling pathway leading to egress
  recapitulates our current understanding of the cascade and the positioning of PP1
  phosphatase deduced from this study and Paul et al. [34]. PP1 is involved in the
  initiation of the rounding-up step, possibly by controlling Ca2+ release. In addition,
  PP1 also modulates cGMP homeostasis by regulating the phosphorylation status of
  GCα, which may adjust its interactions with cofactors like SLF. Dotted versus plain
  arrows represent indirect and direct mechanisms, respectively. Inhibitors of the
  egress pathway are shown in orange. SLF: Signaling Linking Factor; CDC50B: Cell
