caption: This figure summarizes the mechanisms observed in blood cancers of hijacking
  the physiologic circuitry of their normal counterparts (left column) to drive tumor
  growth and manipulate endogenous immune responses (right column). Example malignancies
  are listed centrally for each mechanism (row). A, on the left panel, illustrates
  an IL-7-mediated signaling pathway that drives physiologic homeostatic proliferation
  of T cells. In contrast, the right-sided panel shows that, by acquiring somatic
  mutations throughout this pathway (indicated by black color), blood cancers such
  as T-ALL can drive autonomous signaling. B highlights a similar phenomenon via the
  BCR signalling pathway that is activated by multiple B cell malignancies through
  acquired somatic mutations of the BCR itself as well as downstream components (indicated
  by black color). C depicts the typical antigen-specific activation of T cells mediated
  by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the physiologic setting (left);
  in contrast, the lack of co-stimulation during antigen (Ag) presentation by malignant
  cells can induce T cell anergy (right). In D, the conventional role of HMGB1 as
  a “danger” signal emitted by dying cancer cells that stimulates and attracts anti-tumor
  T cells (left panel) is reversed in CLL in which (right panel) HMGB1 may promote
  differentiation of monocytes into nurse-like cells (NLCs) to promote CLL cell survival
  in vivo. Finally, E portrays the duality of Th1-led inflammation, with the left
  panel attributing tumor-destructive roles to CD8+ T cells and macrophages and tumor-promoting
  activities to regulatory T cells (Tregs); the right panel ascribes tumor-survival
  signals to CD4+ Th1 cells and a potential anti-tumor influence to Tregs as seen
  in CLL, cHL, FL and MM.
