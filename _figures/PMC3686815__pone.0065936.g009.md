caption: Extrasynaptic ACh can exert long distant regulatory effects on non-excitable
  cholinoceptive cells, such as microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and endothelia,
  mediated mainly through activation of nicotinic α7-ACh receptors . However, extracellular
  ACh is highly labile due to extracellular presence of the ACh-degrading enzymes,
  AChE and BuChE. (1) The finding here of presence of extracellular ACh-synthesizing
  enzyme, ChAT, proposes a model in which continuous synthesis of ACh counteracted
  by breakdown could maintain a steady-state equilibrium, which can regulate glial
  activation status. (2) This equilibrium may also be influenced by neuronal activity,
  since action potentials by cholinergic neurons, for example, may lead to synchronized
  production and release of Aβ peptides into the interstitial fluid . (3) These Aβ
  peptides can interact with AChE and BuChE, and temporarily form BAβA-complexes (BAβACs),
  in which these enzymes acquire ultrafast catalytic activity, plausibly through induction
  of certain conformational change in their tertiary structures . (4) The hyperfunctional
  BAβACs will then effectively shift the equilibrium state towards lower ACh, which
  in turn leads to the activation of glia with expression of, for example, complement
  factors. (5) Reuptake of Aβ peptides will result in disintegration of BAβACs, (6)
  normalization of the steady-state balance, and (7) the initial astroglial status.
  (8) In AD the presence of the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene may disturb
  the balance additionally due to dysfunctional Aβ re-uptake (clearance) and/or high
  levels of ApoE protein, a common condition among APOE4 carriers . High ApoE protein
  will prolong the interaction between cholinesterases and Aβ, leading to gradual
  accumulation and deposition of BAβACs in the brain. The end stage, BAβACs is deposited
  together with Aβ peptides in the brain as parts of the Aβ plaques and cerebral amyloid
  angiopathies, two hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease brain, which also explains the
  documented presence of BuChE, AChE and ApoE in these Aβ deposits .
