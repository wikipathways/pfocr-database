caption: Non-condensate compartmentalization in plants and insects. (A) Colocalization
  of glycolysis enzymes in D. melanogaster flight muscle fibers. M-lines and Z-lines
  associate with glycolysis enzymes (indicated with blue). Glycolysis enzymes associated
  with Z-lines are shown on the right. In the presence of GPDH, multiple sequential
  glycolysis enzymes associate with the Z-line, allowing them to convert fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
  to ATP and pyruvate. Deletion of muscle GPDH disrupts localization of the other
  glycolysis enzymes, resulting in flight defects. (B) Substrate channeling on the
  mitochondrial membrane in plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, glycolysis enzymes (yellow,
  blue and purple shapes) are diffusely localized in the cytosol. Inhibition of respiration
  triggers the accumulation of each glycolysis enzyme on mitochondrial membranes.
  These complexes promote substrate channeling through the glycolytic pathway, efficiently
  converting glucose into usable ATP.
