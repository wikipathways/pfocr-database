caption: Overview of the metabolic pathway changes in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes due
  to insulin or TNF-α treatments. Pathways that were up-regulated are shown by red
  arrows and pathways that were down-regulated are shown by green arrows. Proteins
  involved in pathways of glycolysis, glycogenolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and
  oxidative stress responses were up-regulated and protein involved in glycogenesis,
  gluconeogenesis, and TCA cycle, were down-regulated. LIPE; hormone sensitive lipase.
