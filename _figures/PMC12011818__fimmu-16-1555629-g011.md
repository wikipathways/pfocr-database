caption: Proposed model of HPV E2-mediated suppression of innate immune signaling.
  Upon infection, RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS, TLR3-TRIF, cGAS-STING, and JAK-STAT pathways are
  activated to induce the expression of IFNs and ISGs. HPV E2 disrupts these pathways
  by targeting core signaling molecules, thereby inhibiting signalosome formation
  and suppressing of IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. In addition,
  HPV E2 inhibits the JAK-STAT pathway by interacting with STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9,
  preventing ISGF3 complex assembly and nuclear translocation. Together, these mechanisms
  suppress IFN production and ISG induction, thereby dampening antiviral immunity
  and promoting viral replication
