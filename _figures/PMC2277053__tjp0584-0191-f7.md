caption: PGE2 binds EP3 receptors, which activates Gs and adenylyl cyclase, thus increasing
  the level of cAMP. In normal sensory neurons, cAMP activates PKA alone resulting
  in an increase in P2X3 receptor-mediated currents and nocifensive responses (route
  on the right). After inflammation, in addition to the PKA-mediated pathway, cAMP
  also activates Epac which leads to the activation of the PKC signalling pathway
  (route on the left). Activation of the PKC-dependent pathway further increases the
  potentiation of P2X3 receptor-mediated responses by PGE2, giving rise to exaggerated
  hyperalgesic behavioural responses.
