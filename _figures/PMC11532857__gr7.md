caption: Role of miRNAs regulating angiogenesis in HCC. A. Pericytes line the vascular
  endothelium throughout the body. Pericytes cover vascular endothelium throughout
  the body, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptors are located on these vascular surfaces. tip/stalk cells are a group
  of endothelial cells. Tumor cells widely secrete pro-angiogenic factors and create
  tumor tissue with poor perfusion. After that, a hypoxic microenvironment is created,
  which is one of the main drivers of angiogenesis in tumor tissue. PDGF by tip cells
  is secreted, and the high level of VEGF secretion by tumor cells blocks PDGFRb signaling
  through the receptor complex consisting of PDGFRb and VEGFR2. VEGF-stimulated tip/stalk
  cells tend to migrate and proteolytic enzymes such as MMP, elastase or trypsin are
  secreted by cancer cells. These enzymes destroy cell junctions. The released cells
  gradually mimic the behavior of blood vessel cells and form channel-like structures
  similar to vessels.B.By increasing the expression of miR-199a-3p, the signaling
  pathways of HGF, and MMP2 are blocked, and at the same time, the expression of VEGFR1
  and VEGFR2, HGF, MMP2, VEGFA genes is inhibited, and then angiogenesis is inhibited.
  Increased miR-146 increases angiogenesis by inhibiting PDGFRA activation in the
  BRCA1–PDGFRA pathway
