caption: Schematic representation of SP-mediated signaling and activation of the MAPK
  and MLC20 pathways in lymphatic muscle cells. SP binding to NK1R and/or NK3R activates
  the MAPK pathway, specifically ERK1/2 and p38, causing an increase in their phosphorylated
  forms. SP-mediated downstream activation can be blocked by the neurokinin receptor
  inhibitor NK1R (L703606) and/or NK3R (SB222200) are shown. Activation of p-ERK increases
  MLC20 phosphorylation, which is diminished upon inhibition of ERK1/2 with PD-98059.
  Inhibition of p38 phosphorylation does not decrease pMLC20 and may play a role in
  activation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by inflammatory mediators as
  NF-κB and I-κB. PKC possibly plays an intermediary role in this SP-mediated downstream
  signaling by activation of ERK-mediated MLC20 phosphorylation, which is abrogated
  on inhibition with GF109203X. SP signaling may thus be activating parallel contractile
  and inflammatory pathways by activation of p-ERK and p-38MAPK, respectively. Dashed
  arrows represent components that have not been directly assessed in this study.
