caption: Current scheme of queuosine incorporation in tRNAs. The involvement of various
  proteins at different steps in the pathway and the E. coli strains deficient at
  these steps are shown. Transformation of GTP to preQ0 at the first step in the pathway
  is shown by an open arrow. This transformation may involve additional proteins (such
  as QueD and QueE []) or may represent a multistep process.
