caption: 'Multiple pathways are responsible for the antiallergic effects of azelastine.The
  figure summarizes the pathways of action of multiple action antiallergic drugs,
  which include membrane activation and cell degranulation (early phase reaction)
  and de-novo synthesis (late-phase reaction). Drugs acting at the membrane level
  also interfere with the subsequent steps of intracellular Ca2+ influx and PTK signal
  transduction pathway. Copyright © 2009, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. All rights
