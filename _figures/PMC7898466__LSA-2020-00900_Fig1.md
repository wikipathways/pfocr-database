caption: (A) TLS pathways for replication through cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs).
  Polη replicates through CPDs in an error-free manner. Polθ functions in inserting
  nts opposite the 3′T or 3′C of a CPD in the error-prone TLS pathways dependent upon
  Polκ or Polζ for extension of synthesis. As a scaffolding component, Rev1 functions
  together with Polη or Polκ, and Polλ functions together with Polζ. (B) TLS pathways
  for replication through (6-4)PPs. Polθ extends synthesis from the nts inserted by
  Polη or Polι opposite the 3′T or 3′C of the (6-4) photoproduct and these pathways
  promote error-prone TLS. After nt insertion opposite the (6-4) lesion by Polλ, Polζ
  would extend synthesis from the nt inserted by Polλ. The Polλ/Polζ pathway conducts
  error-free TLS through (6-4) PPs. The thickness of the arrows depicts the relative
  contribution of TLS Pols to lesion bypass.
