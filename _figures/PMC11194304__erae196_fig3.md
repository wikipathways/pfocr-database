caption: RHO OF PLANTS (ROP) GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTORS (GEFs) drive the
  specificity of ROP signalling. Different examples in which ROPGEFs specifically
  activate one process but not others. The participating ROPGEFs are present simultaneously
  in all the cases shown, but only their specific downstream process is activated.
  This might depend on spatiotemporal differences or different binding properties
  from other components of different ROP signalling complexes. (A) Root hair initiation
  and tip growth are regulated by overlapping ROPs but are activated by different
  ROPGEFs. Polarization of ROP signalling at the root hair initiation domain is driven
  by ROPGEF3 and potentially ROPGEF14. Their activating receptor remains unknown,
  and only ROP2 and ROP4 were shown to regulate root hair initiation specifically,
  but it is likely that ROP6 also participates in this process. Multiple ROPGEFs regulate
  root hair tip growth, but a function is shown only for ROPGEF3, ROPGEF4, and ROPGEF10.
  The other shown ROPGEFs are expressed in root hairs, but no function is established
  yet. The RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (RLK) FERONIA (FER) regulates GEF4 and GEF10, while
  potential other RLKs are needed to activate all expressed GEFs. So far, no specificity
  of ROPGEFs to ROPs has been determined, which could help us understand the individual
  ROP-regulated pathways. (B) Pollen germination and pollen tube tip growth are regulated
  by the same ROPs but are activated by different ROPGEFs. ROPGEF8 and ROPGEF9 specifically
  accumulate at the pollen germination site and polarize ROP signalling. Their activating
  RLK still needs to be determined. During pollen tube growth, multiple RLKs are known
  to activate various ROPGEFs, activating the same set of ROPs. It remains to be determined
  if any specificities of RLKs towards ROPGEFs or ROPGEFs towards ROPs occur in activating
  downstream pathways. (C) The TRANSMEMBRANE KINASE (TMK) RLKs activate ROP2 and potentially
  ROP4 via an unknown ROPGEF to drive auxin-dependent lobe growth in pavement cells.
  On the other hand, FER activates ROP6 via GEF14 to restrict growth in the neck regions.
  It still needs to be determined which ROPGEF mediates TMK signalling, if another
  ROPGEF is also present in the FER-dependent pathway, and how specificity between
  both pathways is achieved. (D) ROPGEF1 and ROPGEF4 inhibit ABA-induced stomata closure
  via ROP10 and ROP10. However, their activation mechanism has yet to be discovered.
  On the other hand, ROPGEF2 and ROPGEF4, together with ROP2 and ROP7, inhibit PHYTOCHROME
  B (PHYB)-dependent stomatal opening in response to red light. PHYB directly activates
  ROPGEF2 to counteract its function, but it still needs to be revealed how ROPGEF4
  is activated. The specificities of these co-occurring pathways still need to be
  determined, especially for ROPGEF4, which is part of both processes with opposite
  results
