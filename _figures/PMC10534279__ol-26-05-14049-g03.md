caption: Roles and mechanisms of GDF15 in CC. Solid lines indicate demonstrated mechanisms
  and dashed lines indicate possible mechanisms. GDF15 initiates the phosphorylation
  of ERK, Akt and PLCγ via GFRAL/RET signaling to mediate anorexia, muscle atrophy
  and fat loss in CC; the antibody 3P10 can inhibit these processes. Binding of GDF15
  to TGFβRII and TGFβRI leads to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3. This pathway
  downregulates NPY and upregulates POMC to induce anorexia. Reduced food intake indirectly
  contributes to muscle wasting and fat depletion in cancer cachexia. Activation of
  MAP3K11/GDF15 and Bcl-2/caspase-3 apoptotic pathways is responsible for CC muscle
  atrophy, but their specific receptors are unknown. GDF15 may also reduce muscle
  mass through the TAK-1/NF-κB signaling pathway, and downregulates the expression
  of miR-1, miR-133a and miR-499 in muscle. In addition, GDF15 may promote muscle
  atrophy and fat loss by stimulating the HPA axis. Moreover, the GDF15/Smad2/3 pathway
  may be involved in CC-induced anemia. High levels of GDF15 directly inhibit the
  expression of hepcidin, which could further trigger anemia and muscle wasting in
  CC. GDF15, growth differentiation factor 15; CC, cancer cachexia; ERK, extracellular
