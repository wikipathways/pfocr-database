caption: Selective autophagy in cancer. (a) Cellular senescence is a barrier to tumorigenesis
  and selective autophagy explains the conflicting reports about the role of autophagy
  in senescence. Normal proliferating cells basally degrade the pro-senescence transcription
  factor GATA4 via p62 selective autophagy. The molecular details of the GATA4-p62
  interaction and its regulation are currently unclear. (b) Upon oncogene-induced
  stress, the GATA4-p62 interaction is abrogated by an unknown mechanism thereby stabilizing
  GATA4. (c) GATA4 translocates to the nucleus where it activates a senescence transcriptional
  program as well as a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) transcriptional
  program. General autophagy is also stimulated at this time and is required to drive
  senescence. This pathway clarifies the apparent paradox in the literature that autophagy
  can suppress senescence (basal selective autophagy of GATA4) and promote senescence
  (autophagy is required to support senescence phenotype). (d) Basally, Lamin B1 binds
  nuclear LC3 and chromatin but is not targeted for autophagic degradation. (e) Upon
  oncogene-induced stress, Lamin B1 is autophagocytosed with bound chromatin to mediate
  nuclear lamina selective autophagy contributing to a senescence phenotype and thereby
  tumor suppression.
