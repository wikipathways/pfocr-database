caption: Overexpression of TGF-β is associated with increased renal injury and extracellular
  matrix deposition that eventually lead to chronic kidney disease and renal failure.
  TGF-β also activates HO-1 expression and one or more products of the HO-1 reaction
  mitigate TGF-β mediated pathogenic and fibrogenic effects.
