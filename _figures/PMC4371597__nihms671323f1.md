caption: 'The pathway consists of three proximal sensors: PERK, IRE1α and ATF6α. Their
  coordinated response serves to restore ER folding capacity by inhibiting protein
  translation (PERK) and orchestrates a transcriptional response that ultimately increases
  protein-folding capacity (IRE1α & ATF6α). BiP negatively regulates these pathways
  by binding to the luminal domains to prevent activation. The induction of ER stress
  and accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen causes the release of BiP
  from PERK, IRE1α and ATF6α, leading to their subsequent activation. PERK dimerization
  leads to trans-phosphorylation and activation, resulting in the phosphorylation
  of eIF2α and a global decrease in the rate of protein translation. However, some
  mRNAs, such as ATF4 mRNA, are translated under these conditions, possibly by the
  presence of open reading frames within the 5′ untranslated region. BiP release from
  IRE1α permits dimerization and activation of its kinase and RNase activities to
  permit XBP-1 mRNA splicing, creating a translational frame-shift to produce a transcriptionally
  competent transcription factor (XBP-1s) that traffics to the nuclease in an p85α/β-dependent
  fashion. Lastly, the release of BiP from ATF6α leads to the translocation of ATF6α
  to the Golgi where it undergoes sequential cleavage by S1P and S2P proteases. The
  resultant transcription factor transits to the nuclease where it activates UPR target
  genes.'
