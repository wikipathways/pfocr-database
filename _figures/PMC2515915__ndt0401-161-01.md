caption: Overview of the adenylyl cyclase–cyclicAMP signaling system. In this signaling
  pathway, the binding of agonists to receptors leads to the activation of G proteins,
  which in turn activate adenylyl cyclase. In the inactive state the α subunit of
  G protein is bound to GDP and to βγ subunits. The binding of agonists to receptors
  causes an interaction of receptors with G proteins, which, in turn, releases GDP
  in exchange with GTP. This leads to generation of α-GTP and a βγ subunits dimer.
  Both α and βγ subunits can interact with effectors. Activation of adenylyl cyclase
  causes generation of cAMP from ATP. cAMP binds to the regulatory (R) subunits of
  tetrameric PKA holoenzymes. The binding of cAMP to an R subunit lowers its affinity
  for the C subunit. This causes the release of free catalytic (C) subunits. The C
  subunit can catalyze reversible protein phosphorylation and irreversible phosphorylation
  of newly synthesized peptides. Phosphorylation of substrates can occur in the cytoplasm
  or, after translocation of the C subunits, in the nucleus. One of the substrates
  of PKA is transcription factor cyclicAMP response element binding protein CREB,
  which regulates transcription of many neuronally expressed genes, including brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac) is stimulated
  by cAMP to exchange GDP with GTP on Rap-1. Rap can also be regulated by phosphorylation
  by a C subunit of PKA. Deactivation of PKA is achieved through degradation of cAMP
  to 5’AMP by cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases.
