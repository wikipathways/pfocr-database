caption: To ensure successful invasion of the host cell T. cruzi has developed a multi-step
  process with redundant mechanisms involving diverse host and parasite molecules.
  The enzyme Plase A1 (Tc-Plase A1) is secreted by T. cruzi and is widely present
  during the infectious life stages. Tc-Plase A1 may contribute to lipid modifications
  on host cells and concomitantly activates the PKC signaling pathway. This suggests
  that Tc-Plase A1 is involved in the early events of the parasite–host cell interaction
  and precedes parasite invasion.
