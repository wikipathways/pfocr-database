caption: Overview of OMPs and LPS biogenesis pathways and extracytoplasmic stress
  response. (a) OMPs are synthesized in the cytoplasm and translocated across the
  IM by the Sec translocon. After translocation, the signal sequence (indicated in
  red) is cleaved. In the periplasm, chaperone proteins as SurA assist OMPs folding
  and deliver them to the BamABCDE complex for assembly at the OM. Blue arrows show
  the sequence of events occurring during OMPs biogenesis. (b) LptD is an OMP and
  follows the chaperone/Bam folding pathway. Correct LptD folding requires its association
  with the lipoprotein LptE and interdomain disulfide bridges isomerization. LptD-LptE
  interaction at the Bam complex is favored by the chaperone/protease BepA. Red dashed
  arrows show the sequence of events occurring during LptDE complex assembly. (c)
  LptDE complex is the LPS OM translocon. LPS is synthesized in the cytoplasm by the
  Lpx pathway, flipped to the periplasmic face of the IM by MsbA and transported through
  the periplasm to the outer leaflet of the OM by the Lpt machinery. Continuous red
  arrows show the sequence of events occurring during LPS biogenesis. (d) Mislocalized
  or misfolded OMPs and defects in the LPS export pathway trigger the σE envelope
  stress response (black arrows). Misassembled porins bind to DegS, cleaving RseA
  and initiating the σE stress response. The current model suggests that defects in
  Lpt assembly/function result in RseB binding to LPS possibly released by the Lpt
  machinery (question mark). RseB bound to LPS frees RseA that can then be cleaved
  by OMP-activated DegS and by RseP thus activating the σE stress response.
