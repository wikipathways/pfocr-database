  The blue square represents mixed-species biofilms; and the red square represents
  S. mutans biofilms. The fold of change of protein synthesis from 67 to 115 h is
  indicated by arrows; fold ≥1.5 represents induction (red ↑); fold ≤0.6 represents
  repression (green ↓); and no arrows are depicted for fold 1.5< and >0.6. The proteins
  represented in this diagram are important for S. mutans biofilm formation and survival:
  sugar uptake (ScrA, ScrB, PtsG, MalM), EPS matrix (Ftf, GtfB), intracellular polysaccharide
  storage (AmyA, GlgA, GlgB, GlgP). * Plus TreA.'
