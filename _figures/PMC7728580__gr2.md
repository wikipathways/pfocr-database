caption: Role of H2S in HCC. (A) Over-activation of endogenous H2S promotes the proliferation
  of liver cancer cells, this effect may be related with inhibition of p53, p21, JNK,
  caspase-3, PARP, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, acceleration of cell cycle progression, and upregulation
  of EGFR, ERK1/2. (B) Treatment of hepatoma cells with NaHS (500 µM) stimulates the
  levels of CSE, CBS and activates NF-κB signaling, resulting in COX-2, VEGF and MMP-2
  upregulations, and decreased caspase-3 activation, accompanied by increased HCC
  cell viability. In addition, activation of the STAT3/COX-2/VEGF axis is required
  for NaHS (500 µM) to stimulate HCC cell growth and migration. (C) Administration
  of NaHS (10−3 M) prevents the migration and proliferation of HCC cells via curbing
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and promoting the induction of autophagy. A
  H2S donor GYY4137 (400 μM) diminishes tumor growth via inhibition of the STAT3 pathway.
