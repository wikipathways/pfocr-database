caption: Sex hormone signaling axis modulates viral infection at the viral entry,
  transcription and replication stages. (A) AR mediated recruitment of Src, which
  led to the activation of the kinase p90 RSK1, which led to Ser897 phosphorylation
  of EphA2. AR coordinated activation of the Src/RSK1/EphA2 Ser897 signal to accelerate
  endocytosis of KSHV. (B) Androgen pathway increased the transcription of HBV mRNAs
  through direct binding to ARE1 (913–927 bp) and ARE2 (949–963 bp) in HBV enhancer
  I. The HBx gene can also enhance AR activity by activating c-Src signaling pathways
  and inactivating GSK-3β signaling pathways; ER-α binds to HNF-4α, causing molecular
  chelation, which inhibited the DNA binding ability of HNF-4α to HBV enhancer I,
  resulting in a decrease in enhancer I activity and HBV gene transcription. (C) ZIKV
  infection attracted S100A4 + macrophages to aggregate and differentiate into interferon-γ-expressing
  cells in the testis and secrete interferon-γ, increasing the permeability of the
  blood–testicular barrier (BTB), thereby facilitating the entry of ZIKV into the
  spermatogenic tubules; S100a4-Cre (GFP +) cells are expressed in the testis and
  rarely expressed in the interstitial tissue of the ovary. The interruption of the
  PTCH1 signaling pathway decreases the expression of Cga, which causes a decrease
  in the levels of follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH),
  and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Finally, the function of the ovaries and
  testes is damaged.
