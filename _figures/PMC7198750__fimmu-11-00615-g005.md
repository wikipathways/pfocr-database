caption: Cell interactions in TME engaging the cGAS-STING pathway. Double-stranded
  breaks (DSBs) can lead to cytosolic self-DNA that engages the cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase
  (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and produces type-I interferon
  (IFN). STING promotes the senescence of cancer cells. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine
  monophosphate (cGAMP) can transfer to proximal host non-cancer cells through gap-junction
  channels and promote the formation of an inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME).
  Dendritic cells (DCs) are the main source of type-I IFN and tumor necrosis factor
  α (TNFα), and promote an inflammatory TME. Infiltrating DCs take up tumor-derived
  DNA or cGAMP from dying cell fragments or exosomes. DCs cross-prime and activate
  anti-tumor cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cells and constrict cancer growth
  effectively. Co-stimulation of type-I IFN and TNFα signaling simultaneously leads
  to remarkable necroptosis of tumor cells. cGAS can relocate to the nucleus and obstruct
  polymerase 1 (PARP1), which suppresses DNA repair. Chronic levels of IFNα and TNFα
  in TME could support tumor development and cause type-2 macrophages and regulatory
  T cells to be recruited (Red arrows represent mechanisms promoting tumors; black
  arrows represent mechanisms limiting tumors).
