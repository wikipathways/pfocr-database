caption: MDSCs expansion is regulated by several factors in vivo microenvironment.
  This figure summarizes possible MDSCs inducers described in the context of transplantation
  and their signaling pathways. RAS is a target GTPase of CSF, TGF-β, or IL-6. mTOR
  inhibitor, rapamycin, paradoxically activates the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. This
  pathway locates at a downstream of IL-33 and Steroid signaling pathways. Both cyclosporin
  and TCDD induce IDO through NFAT and aryl hydrocarbon receptor, respectively. The
  STAT 3 is mainly involved in MDSCs expansion as well as IDO expression. MDSCs, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells; CSF, colony stimulating factor; IDO, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase;
  TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells;
  STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.
