caption: Working model of salidroside (SR) against skin cancer. SR prevents the carcinogenesis
  of mouse skin tissue initiated by DMBA/TPA. SR acts as a drug to suppress skin tumors
  in mice by inactivating the IκBα/NF-κB pathway, thus reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. In addition, the p53 and caspase-3 signaling pathways were enhanced by
  SR, resulting in apoptosis to prevent skin carcinogenesis. SR, salidroside. DMBA,
  7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene. TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.
