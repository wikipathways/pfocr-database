caption: 'Polyol pathway.Notes: Shown are the two reactions catalyzed, respectively,
  by aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase. The pathway makes sorbitol from
  glucose, fructose from sorbitol, and NADH from NADPH via NAD+. Sorbitol can trigger
  osmotic stress and cell death; fructose can induce nonenzymatic glycation or contributes
  to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. NADH can cause reductive stress that eventually
  leads to oxidative stress. Additionally, NADPH depletion can also impair glutathione
  reductase resulting in accumulation of oxidized glutathione that can further impair
  cellular redox balance.Abbreviations: GSSG, oxidized glutathione; GSH, reduced glutathione.'
