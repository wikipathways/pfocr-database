caption: Suggested mechanism of inflammatory response in the C3R downstream pathway
  during C3 deficiency. In this scheme, the deficiency of C3 is thought to activate
  the iNOS-mediated COX-2 induction pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, ASC-inflammasome
  pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway. Finally, activated NF-κB translocates into
  the nucleus, and induces the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines as well as the
  downregulation of tight junction channels and ion channels in the mid colon.
