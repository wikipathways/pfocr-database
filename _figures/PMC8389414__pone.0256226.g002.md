caption: Pathway analysis highlighting those biosynthetic pathways liked with mediators
  found to contribute to the separation between patients with severe symptoms and
  those that were critically ill in the PLS-DA analysis (VIP Scores >1) for mediators
  from the (A) DHA, (B) n-3 DPA, (C) EPA, and (D) AA bioactive metabolomes. Results
  expressed as fold-change differences vs concentrations in plasma from patients with
  severe disease. Results are representative of n = 23 critically ill patients and
  n = 15 patients with severe disease.
