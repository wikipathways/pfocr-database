caption: Mechanism of action of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The binding together
  of MHC-peptide (peptide = tumor antigen) and TCR activates the anti-cancer pathway
  of T-cell–mediated immune response. The binding of CTLA-4 to its ligand and PD-1
  to PD-L1, on the contrary, inhibit the anti-cancer pathway. The binding of monoclonal
  antibodies, such as ICIs, to CTLA-4, PD-1 or PD-L1 prevent the deactivation of the
  anti-cancer pathway.
