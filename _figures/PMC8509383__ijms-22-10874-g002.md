caption: The mechanisms through which melatonin inhibits hypoxia-induced tumor progression.
  Melatonin inhibits the survival of hypoxic cancer cells by (1) up-regulating and
  activating the apoptotic factors, (2) down-regulating and inactivating anti-apoptotic
  factors [B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL)], (3)
  blocking the cell cycle by up-regulating p21/WAF1 and p53, and (4) inhibiting carbonic
  anhydrase IX (CA IX) expression and activity and cAMP-related pathways to make an
  unsuitable environmental pH. Melatonin inhibits hypoxia-induced angiogenesis by
  (1) suppressing the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-2
  (Ang-2), stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2
  and -9), angiopoietin-1 and -2 (ANGPT-1 and -2), (2) inhibiting the expression of
  lipoxygenase (LOX) via interacting with RZR/RORα nuclear receptor, and (3) blocking
  the hypoxia-induced tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and membrane-type 1 matrix
  metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) activity and subsequently reducing Semaphorin-4D (Sema4D).
  Melatonin inhibits the hypoxia-induced invasion and migration of cancer cells by
  (1) decreasing levels of proteases including Cathepsin C (CTSC), MMP-2, MMP-9, MT1-MMP,
  and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), (2) up-regulating the adhesion proteins,
  such as integrin and E-cadherin, (3) suppressing oxidative-stress-induced detachment
  of cancer cells via overexpression of the β1 integrin and down-regulation of ROS-αvβ3
  integrin-FAK/Pyk2 (focal adhesion kinase/proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) signaling
  pathway, and (4) blocking hypoxia-induced microtubule organization and rearrangement
  via blocking the Rho-kinase 1 (ROCK1) signaling pathway. Melatonin disturbs hypoxia-induced
  cancer cell metabolism by (1) reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and down-regulating
  hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), VEGF and glycolysis-related enzymes such as
  glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and progestins activate 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase
  3 (PFKFB3), and (2) competing with glucose in binding to GLUT1, and 3) inhibition
  of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1) signaling pathway.
