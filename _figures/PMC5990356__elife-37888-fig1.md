caption: (A) When a chemokine (blue, green or brown line) binds to a chemokine receptor
  (black lines) embedded in the plasma membrane (PM; grey) of a cell, a G protein
  formed of three subunits (α, ß, γ), one of which (α) is attached to a molecule called
  GDP, is recruited. The GDP is then replaced with a molecule known as GTP, the G
  protein dissociates, and the different subunits go on to activate a range of different
  cellular pathways. (B) Different models can explain how chemokines signal within
  a cell. In the first model (left), different chemokines (L1, L2, L3) bind to their
  corresponding receptors (R1, R2, R3) and activate a generic G protein mediated pathway
  (G) in two types of cells (in yellow and green). The final response (RE1, RE2) triggered
  by a chemokine is ultimately dependent on interpretation modules (depicted as cellular
  brains) that are specific to the cell type, rather than on the identity of the signaling
  chemokine-receptor complex. The second model (right) proposes that each chemokine-receptor
  pairs activates a specific cellular pathway that determines a particular cellular
  response. The work by Malhotra et al. supports the first model ().
