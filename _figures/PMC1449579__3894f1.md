caption: 'Current model for lesion bypass promoted by the RAD6 epistasis group in
  response to spontaneous damage. Spontaneous damage is indicated as an X. The model
  predicts two Polζ-dependent error-prone arms: one controlled by the Rad6-Rad18 complex
  and the other controlled by a homodimer of Rad5. The error-free pathway is composed
  of proteins involved in both error-prone arms, as well as proteins involved in DNA
  replication. See text for details; adapted from .'
