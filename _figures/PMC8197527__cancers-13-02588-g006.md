caption: 'Proposed mechanism for the combined effect of AR and ER-β on TNBC. ER-β
  expression reverses the aggravating role of AR: indirectly through inhibition of
  the signal transduction pathway activated by AR, or directly by forming a heterodimer
  with AR, inhibiting it from forming homodimers []. ER-β1 also suppresses the invasion,
  migration, and metastatic abilities of these cells by suppressing ZEB1. Activation
  of AR promotes ER-β production by functioning as a transcription factor that directly
  binds to the ER-β promoter [].'
