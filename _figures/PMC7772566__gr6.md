caption: Cholesterol synthesis pathway restricts nEc specification from hPSCs(A) PPI
  network analysis generated by STRING revealed that LPGs within the metabolism module
  comprised key molecules function in multiple metabolic pathways.(B) Genes related
  to TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation were enriched in LPGs, and heatmap showed
  decreased expression of these LPGs along trilineage differentiation of hPSCs. The
  expression level was normalized to RPKM and z-scored.(C) Heatmap showed decreased
  expression of LPGs related to amino acid metabolism along trilineage differentiation
  of hPSCs. The expression level was normalized to RPKM and z-scored.(D) Genes of
  cholesterol synthesis pathway that were enriched in LPGs were labeled in red. Heatmap
  showed that the expression of these cholesterol synthesis pathway-related LPGs was
  specifically downregulated when the hPSCs were specified toward a nEc fate. The
  expression level was normalized to RPKM and z-scored.(E) A schematic model for hPSC
  self-renewal and trilineage differentiation. Extracellular signaling, epigenetic
  regulation, transcriptional regulation, and metabolic pathways play a synergistic
  role in regulating hPSC self-renewal and trilineage differentiation. Histone modifications
  share common mechanisms in leveraging the transcriptional activity of genes belonging
  to all three lineages. The TCA cycle, the respiratory chain, and the amino acid
  metabolism are all important for maintaining an undifferentiated state of hPSCs,
  though glycolytic flux is highly active. A mutual antagonistic effect occurs in
  Me&En and nEc lineage specifiers, and a balance of these lineage specifiers is required
  for the self-renewal of hPSCs. hPSC-enriched miRNAs showed clear lineage gene targeting
  preference. The cholesterol synthesis pathway plays a pivotal role in maintaining
  hPSCs via restraining the nEc differentiation.
