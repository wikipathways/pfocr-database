caption: Oxidative inactivation of PTEN in nerve survival and regeneration. During
  neuronal injury, the NOX2-derived ROS concentration increases due to receptor kinase
  stimulation or extracellular vesicles released by macrophages. These ROS oxidize
  PTEN, leading to the activation of the PIP3/AKT signaling pathway, which promotes
  nerve regeneration. This mechanism can also promote self-renewal, proliferation,
  and differentiation in neuronal stem and progenitor cells. In the context of Alzheimer’s
  disease, the activation of the AKT pathway can downregulate GSK3β activity and the
  subsequent phosphorylation of the tau protein, providing neuroprotection
