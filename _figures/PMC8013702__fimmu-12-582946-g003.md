caption: Schematic of MuV infection of testicular somatic cells and downstream effects.
  Sialic acid (SA) on the surface of Sertoli cells (SCs) and Leydig cells (LCs) mediated
  MuV entry into cells. Gas6 and Axl/Mer (AM) receptor tyrosine kinase system facilitates
  MuV replication by inhibiting antiviral response. MuV triggers Toll-like receptor
  2 (TLR2) and cytosolic RNA sensors MDA5/RIG-I signaling pathways, thereby inducing
  the expression of various immunoregulatory cytokines, including pro-inflammatory
  factors TNF-α and IL-6, chemokines CXCL10 and MCP-1, and type 1 interferons INF-α
  and IFN-β. IFN-α and IFN-β then induce the expression of various proteins, including
  ISG15, OAS1 and Mx1, that can inhibit MuV replication. MuV infection also induces
  the production of CXCL10, MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6 by testicular macrophages (TM).
  CXCL10 produced by SC in response to MuV infection induces apoptosis of germ cells,
  whereas TNF-α disrupts blood-testis barrier (BTB) integrity and permeability. MuV
  infection of LC inhibits testosterone synthesis. MuV-induced TNF-α is presumably
  responsible for the MuV inhibition of testosterone synthesis. MCP-1 and CXCL10 produced
  by SC, LC and TM may recruit leukocytes (L), resulting in orchitis. Sg, spermatogonium;
  Sp, spermatocyte; RS, round spermatid; ES, elongated spermatid. SOCS, suppressor
  of cytokine signaling. →, promotion; ┴, inhibition; ×, disruption of BTB. The red
  dashed line indicates a possible signaling pathway in SCs and LCs according to previous
  findings (–).
