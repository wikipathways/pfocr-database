caption: Figure 1. Signaling between the muscle and tendon cell is essential for MTJ
  formation. (A) The leading edge of the myofiber expresses the αPS2/βPS integrin
  heterodimer complex before it encounters its target tendon cell. The Egf ligand
  Vein is secreted from the muscle and accumulates at the site of the muscle-tendon
  junction. The binding of Vein to the Egfr expressed on the plasma membrane of the
  tendon cell results in the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic MAPK. This now activates
  MAPK, along with the tendon-cell specific transcription factor Sr, which are capable
  of entering the nucleus to regulate gene expression. (B) A stable myotendinous junction
  is maintained by the formation of the integrin-mediated hemiadherens junctions at
  the site of muscle-tendon attachment. This stable integrin-ECM linkage is formed
  when the muscle-expressed αPS2/βPS integrin complex binds to Tig and Tsp and the
  tendon-expressed αPS1/βPS integrin complex binds to Laminin. Tig, Tsp and Laminin
  are all ECM components that are secreted into the space between the muscle and tendon
  cell, respectively. Continual activation of the Egfr pathway and Sr nuclear localization
  is essential for the transcription of genes to maintain tendon cell identity and
  to synthesize components necessary for this ECM-integrin linkage.
