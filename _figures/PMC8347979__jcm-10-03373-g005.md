caption: ADAM17 promotes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis via EMT activation. Representative
  scheme illustrating the results of TGF-β-induced CTGF expression mediated via the
  ERK/ADAM17/RSK1/C/EBPβ pathway in human lung epithelial cells. TGF-β activates the
  ERK/ADAM17/RSK1/C/EBPβ signalling pathway, which finally leads to CTGF expression,
  promoting EMT in human lung epithelial cells.
