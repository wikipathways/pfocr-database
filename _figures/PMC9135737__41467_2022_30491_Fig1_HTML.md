caption: The DMSP synthesis pathways, with emphasis on the methylation pathway and
  in particular the S-methylation of Met to SMM, catalyzed by MmtN (bacteria) or MMT
  (plants). This step is marked by grey dotted boxes. Dotted black lines represent
  the unconfirmed steps of the decarboxylation pathway, and a potential but unconfirmed
  role for DMSP in secondary metabolite production. S-methyltransferase enzymes of
  the transamination pathway for DMSP synthesis and methylation pathway in Burkholderia
  are indicated in purple font. SMM, S-methylmethionine; MTOB, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate;
  MTHB, 4-methylthio-2-hydroxybutyrate; MTPA, 3-methylthiopropylamine; DMSHB, 4-dimethylsulfonio-2-hydroxybutyrate;
  MMPA, methylmercaptopropionate; DMSOB, 4-dimethylsulfonio-2-oxobutyrate; MMT, Met
  S-methyltransferase; HMT, homocysteine S-methyltransferase; SDC, SMM decarboxylase;
  DOX, DMSP-amine oxidase; DDH, DMSP-aldehyde dehydrogenase.
