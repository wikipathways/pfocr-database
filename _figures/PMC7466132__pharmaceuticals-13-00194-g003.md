caption: Schema summarizing synergistic effects of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
  (SAHA) and parthenolide PN in triple-negative breast cancer cells prepared based
  on Carlisi et al., []. SAHA (histone deacetylase 1 inhibitor, HDACIs) and PN used
  in combination lead to several epigenetic modifications as SAHA induces hyperacetylation
  of histones H3 and H4 and PN downregulates DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). These
  modifications, together with reduced glutathione (GSH) depletion induced by combined
  treatment with SAHA and PN, trigger apoptosis. While PN restrains pro-survival autophagy
  that is induced by SAHA, SAHA prevents cytoprotective effects of PN on AKT/mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway.
  SAHA does not influence the inhibitory effect of PN on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
  activity.
