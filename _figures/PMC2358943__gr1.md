caption: 'Metabolism of PtdIns(4,5)P2 by PLCγ and PI3K. PLCγ hydrolyses PtdIns(4,5)P2
  to yield Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DAG, both of which function as signalling molecules. Ins(1,4,5)P3
  stimulates the release of Ca2+ from the ER into the cytosol, which triggers the
  nuclear translocation of NFAT. DAG binds to and activates RasGRP, which stimulates
  Ras and the Erk pathway, leading to AP-1-dependent transcription. Ras also binds
  to p110 and contributes to optimal PI3K activation. DAG binds to and activates PKC,
  which activates NF-κB through CARMA1, BCL10 and MALT1. By contrast, PI3K phosphorylates
  PtdIns(4,5)P2 at position 3 to produce the membrane phosphoinositol lipid PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.
  PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 functions as an anchor and cofactor for proteins with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding
  PH domains such as Akt, Tec family kinases, and various GEFs and GAPs. Pdk1 is required
  to co-activate Akt. Akt phosphorylates and inactivates Foxo and GSK3. GSK3 can phosphorylate
  and inactivate NFAT. Akt stimulates mTOR through Tsc1 and Tsc2. Tec kinases can
  phosphorylate PLCγ and contribute to its optimal activity. PI3K signalling is antagonised
  by the Pten phosphoinositide phosphatase, which removes the 3-phosphate, and the
  SHIP phosphatase, which removes the 5-phosphate. The role of PI(3,4)P2-binding proteins
  is still unknown. Although PLCγ and PI3K generate mutually exclusive second messenger
  signalling molecules, several of the pathways activated by these second messengers
  interact, and the signals are further integrated by the cell to promote gene transcription,
  cell growth and differentiation. p110δ seems to be the principal PI3K isoform in
  the context of antigen receptor signaling; however, p110α and p110β are also expressed
  in lymphocytes but their roles in antigen receptor signalling are unknown. Abbreviations:
  BCL10, B cell lymphoma 10; CARMA1, caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing
  membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein 1; IP3, inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate;
