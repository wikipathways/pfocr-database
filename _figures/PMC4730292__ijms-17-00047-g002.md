caption: 'Schematic representation of the cholesterol pathway and of the mediation
  of sterol metabolites (ubiquinone) in mitochondrial respiratory function (Complex
  I–IV) in response to the inflammation signal. Inhibitors of CP and MTAse (as MitoQ)
  are indicated in capital and red characters: statins, aminobisphosphonate, squalene
  synthase and farnesyltransferase inhibitors. The block of CP leads to the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome and consequently IL-1β through mitochondrial signals.'
