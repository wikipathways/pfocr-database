caption: 'Potential mechanisms of neuronal damage attributable to Cu toxicity.(a)
  Elevated levels of ROS may further compromise mitochondrial integrity, creating
  a feedback loop that exacerbates ROS generation. Cu significantly enhances mitochondrial
  ROS production, which subsequently impairs TCA cycle activity. (b) Excessive Cu
  may also facilitate the polymerization of amyloid oligomers that form following
  the cleavage of APP. These amyloid plaques increase ROS production and may impair
  antioxidant function, further exacerbating oxidative stress in the brain. Additionally,
  Cu phosphorylates tau protein, and its activation leads to the formation of NFTs
  and subsequent neurodegeneration. (c) Excessive Cu can increase ROS production and
  promote oxidative stress. Elevated ROS levels induce lipid peroxidation in neuronal
  cell membranes, resulting in the production of MDA, a cytotoxic compound. ROS also
  impair the cellular capacity to synthesize antioxidant enzymes, further exacerbating
  oxidative stress. Additionally, ROS can interact with nucleotides and mitochondria,
  further activating the caspase-3 cascade in neurons, which can ultimately lead to
  neuronal death. (d) oxidative stress induced by elevated ROS levels may contribute
  to neuronal dysfunction and inflammation. Disrupted Cu homeostasis in neuronal cells
  triggers ROS production, subsequently activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. This
  activation promotes the transcription of inflammatory genes and the production of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6. The resultant neurotoxicity
  exacerbates neurodegeneration. Created with Microsoft Office 2016. APP: Amyloid
