caption: Possible mechanism of peroxisomal regulation during steroidogenesis. According
  to the literature, the steroidogenic pathway is disturbed under peroxisomal-deficient
  conditions. The underlying mechanism may at least partly involve inhibition of the
  rate-limiting enzyme StAR. Excessive oxidative stress caused by peroxisomal deficiency
  can directly lead to the inhibition of steroid synthesis; moreover, the mitochondrial
  membrane potential is disturbed under peroxisomal-deficient conditions, which deteriorates
  StAR-mediated cholesterol transport. The specific molecular mechanism of StAR inhibition
  needs to be clarified in the future. Additionally, the lipid structure and lipid
  composition of the cell membrane are closely related to the activity of adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) and G protein-coupled receptor signalling. We hypothesize that peroxisomes
  may be involved in upstream cell signalling for hormone production by regulating
  the membrane composition of steroidogenic cells. Red line stands for “inhibit” while
  black line means “promote.”
