caption: Changes in DEGs and DAMs in the metabolic pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis
  of Chinese olive under sunburn stress. The pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis referring
  to the KEGG database (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00941) (accessed
  on 28 August 2023) [20]. Orange and blue colors indicate high and low expression
  levels of DEGs, while red and green colors represent the up- and down-accumulation
  of DAMs, respectively. No color indicates no significant change. Squares, circles,
  and triangles represent the comparisons of CK vs. MSI, CK vs. SSI, and MSI vs. SSI,
  respectively
