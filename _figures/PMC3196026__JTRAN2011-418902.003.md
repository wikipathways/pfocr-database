caption: The mechanism of B7-H4 action in islet transplantation. Interaction between
  B7-H4 and an unknown receptor on activated T cells leads to a series of intracellular
  signalling cascades that result in improved allograft survival. B7-H4 protects allograft
  rejection through deletional and nondeletional mechanisms. It can limit cytotoxic
  CD8+ proliferation and transcription of granzyme B. It also reduces the Th1 response
  which may facilitate generation of suppressive Foxp3+ Tregs. The combination of
  controlling activated T-cell proliferation and promoting regulatory T-cell subsets
  results in enhanced allograft survival and induction of donor-specific tolerance.

  description: The mechanism of B7-H4 action in islet transplantation. Interaction
    between B7-H4 and an unknown receptor on activated T cells leads to a series of
    intracellular signalling cascades that result in improved allograft survival.
    B7-H4 protects allograft rejection through deletional and nondeletional mechanisms.
    It can limit cytotoxic CD8+ proliferation and transcription of granzyme B. It
    also reduces the Th1 response which may facilitate generation of suppressive Foxp3+
    Tregs. The combination of controlling activated T-cell proliferation and promoting
    regulatory T-cell subsets results in enhanced allograft survival and induction
    of donor-specific tolerance.
