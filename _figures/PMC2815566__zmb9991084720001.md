caption: 'Pre-rRNA processing pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (A) The structure
  of the 35S rRNA precursor and locations of processing sites. The pre-rRNA encodes
  the 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs, which are flanked by the 5′ and 3′ external transcribed
  spacers (5′-ETS and 3′-ETS) and separated by internal transcribed spacers 1 and
  2 (ITS1 and ITS2). The positions of oligonucleotide probes used for Northern hybridization
  and FISH analysis are shown in blue and red boxes, respectively. (B) The pre-rRNA
  processing pathway. RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcripts undergo one of two alternate
  fates. The 35S precursor, contained within the 90S preribosome, is generated by
  cleavage at site B0 within the 3′-ETS. This is followed by posttranscriptional endonucleolytic
  cleavages (PTC) within the 5′-ETS, at A0 and A1 at the 5′ end of the mature 18S
  rRNA and within ITS1 at A2. Cleavage at A2 separates the precursors to the 40S and
  60S subunits and generates the 20S and 27SA2 pre-rRNAs. Alternately, Pol I transcripts
  can undergo cotranscriptional cleavage (Co-TC) at the A0, A1, and A2 sites, within
  the small subunit (SSU) processome. Co-TC cleavage is followed by the assembly of
  the large subunit (LSU) processome on the nascent RNA transcript. Following either
  posttranscriptional or cotranscriptional cleavage, the 20S pre-rRNA, contained within
  a pre-40S particle, is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where maturation
  to 18S is completed. The pathway of 5.8S and 25S synthesis occurs within a series
  of pre-60S particles. The 27SA2 pre-rRNA follows one of two alternate pathways:
  around 85% is cleaved at the A3 site within ITS2, followed by 5′→3′ exonucleolytic
  processing gener-ating the 27SBs pre-rRNA. The remaining 15% is processed at site
  B1L, which is located 8 nt 5′ to B1S, yielding the 27SBL pre-rRNA. These two alternate
  forms of 27SB are cleaved within ITS2 at site C2, yielding 26S pre-rRNA and the
  long and short forms of 7S. The 7S pre-rRNAs are converted to 6SL and 6SS by the
  nuclear exosome and Rrp6. Maturation of 26S to 25S rRNA proceeds by a two-step 5′-exonuclease
  pathway. Subsequently, pre-60S particles are exported to the cytoplasm, where final
  maturation to 5.8S is completed.'
