caption: Pathways of protein folding after exposure to protein damage during aging.
  Unfolded proteins accumulate in aging cells due to their exposure to damaging stresses
  or expression of proteins with dominant conformations that tend towards aggregation.
  Such proteins can, however, be folded by ATP-dependent chaperones such as Hsp70
  or small HSP such as Hsp27 that function independently of ATP and tend to form high-molecular-weight
  folding complexes. Each pathway plays a significant role in longevity through recognition
  and refolding of damaged proteins.
