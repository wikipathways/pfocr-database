  Arrows represent positive influences on signaling or developmental processes; T-bars
  represent negative influences. Grayed-out elements are inactive or not present in
  a particular organ or genotype. The positive regulator of stomatal development EPFL9/STOMAGEN
  also requires TMM for activity, but for simplicity, is not shown here. The left
  half of the seedling depicts the wild type (TMM+). In both the cotyledon and hypocotyl,
  stomatal lineage ligands EPF1/2 signal through ERf and TMM receptors to inhibit
  stomatal development for proper patterning. CHALf ligands in the hypocotyl do not
  influence stomatal patterning due to the presence of TMM, which dampens CHALf signaling.
  The right half of the seedling depicts the tmm mutant: Without TMM, EPF1/2 do not
  inhibit stomatal development, leading to the formation of stomatal clusters in cotyledons.
  The opposite effect is observed in the tmm hypocotyl, however, due to the presence
  of CHALf ligands in this organ. Without TMM’s dampening effect, CHALf ligands overactivate
  ERf receptors, resulting in a strong inhibition of stomatal development.(B) Model
  for TMM compartmentalization of ERf receptor functions in growth and stomatal development
  in stems. Apoplast-mobile CHALf and EPF1/2 ligands can encounter ERf receptors both
  in the stomatal lineage and in nonstomatal cells, such as the inner tissues. TMM,
  which is present only in the stomatal lineage, differentially regulates these two
  ligand classes. Thus, CHALf signaling does not affect stomatal development because
  it is dampened by TMM, while EPF1/2 signaling does not affect growth because it
  is potentiated by TMM. Arrows represent positive influences on signaling pathways
  or developmental processes; T-bars represent negative influences. Grayed-out elements
  represent inactive pathways.'
