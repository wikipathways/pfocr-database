caption: Cholesterol transport in polarized cells. Polarized cells form distinct apical
  (red) and basolateral (blue) membrane compartments, which are separated by tight
  junctions (TJ). Proteins and lipids are sorted along the biosynthetic and endocytic
  pathways indicated by blue (basolateral) and red (apical) vesicles. Plasma membrane
  cholesterol is transported in vesicles between the basolateral and apical membrane
  via a subapical compartment or apical recycling compartment (SAC/ARC). Recycling
  to the basolateral membrane can also occur from this compartment (a). LDL cholesterol
  has the same fate as in nonpolarized cells (b). A fraction of de novo synthesized
  cholesterol is transported along the biosynthetic pathway as in nonpolarized cells.
  In the TGN, cholesterol might form microdomains or rafts along with sphingolipids
  that segregate from the remaining TGN membrane and carry apically destined proteins
  and lipids to the apical membrane shown in red (c). Basolaterally destined vesicles
  (blue) bud off of the TGN but should contain less cholesterol (d). Plasma membrane
  cholesterol can shuttle rapidly between the plasma membrane domains by nonvesicular
  transport. This process involves fast transbilayer migration of cholesterol to circumvent
  the lateral diffusion barrier created by the TJ in the exoplasmic leaflet of the
  plasma membrane. Transport through the cytoplasm bound to a protein carrier (e),
  and/or diffusion along the inner monolayer (f) result in rapid exchange of cholesterol
  between the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domain. CE formation occurs as
  in nonpolarized cells but is omitted for clarity.
