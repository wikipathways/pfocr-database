caption: Cellular events underlying UCP1-mediated thermogenesis. Adipocytes can express
  various adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes (). Whereas β-ARs (β1/β2/β3) are coupled
  with Gs, leading to activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), α2-ARs coupled to Gi are
  inhibitory in nature. On stimulation of β-ARs, activation of Gs-AC-cAMP-PKA pathway
  leads to activation of UCP1 transcription on one hand, and phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive
  lipase (HSL) and other lipid droplet-associated proteins on the other (). Sequential
  hydrolysis of triglycerides (TAG) into diacylglycerol (DAG), monoacylglycerol (MAG),
  and glycerol, as well as fatty acids (FAs), is achieved by enzymatic activities
  of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), HSL, and monoglyceride lipase (MGL) (). FAs
  released from intracellular lipid stores are taken up by mitochondria, where they
  undergo β-oxidation, and their stored energy is dissipated via UCP1 that serve to
  uncouple oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis (, ). Besides intracellular
  lipids, brown adipocytes can also utilize circulating glucose, nonesterified free
  fatty acids (NEFA), and TAG-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) for fueling thermogenesis ().
  Among β-ARs, β1-ARs are often associated with an increase in proliferation and differentiation
  of brown adipocytes (), whereas β3-ARs associate with thermogenic activation ().
  CREB, cAMP response element binding protein.
