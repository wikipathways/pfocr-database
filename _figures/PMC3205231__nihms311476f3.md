caption: 'There are two major signaling pathways: first, in the “blue” pathway, phys
  de-repress the positively acting transcriptional regulators, including HY5, LAF1
  and HFR1, by inhibiting the COP1 and DET1 containing CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligases;
  Second, in the “orange” pathway, phys trigger the degradation of the negatively
  acting transcriptional regulators PIFs. The activity of PIFs could be enhanced by
  the COP1/DET1 through HFR1 repression; the protein stability of at least PIF3 is
  promoted by COP1 through an unknown mechanism. The recently identified HMR acts
  early in the pathways and is involved in the degradation of PIFs and phyA as well
  as the inhibition of DET1.'
