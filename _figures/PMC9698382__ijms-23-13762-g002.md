caption: RANK/RANKL signaling. RANKL (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B
  ligand) to this date, represents the only known physiological agonist for RANK,
  its receptor. RANK does not exhibit any kinase activity. Signaling pathway of RANKL/RANK
  is crucial for skeletal homeostasis and its misbalance affects bone resorption.
  The outcome of disturbed skeletal homeostasis is the cause for a number of bone
  diseases, e.g., osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteopetrosis. RANKL/RANK
  signaling also plays an essential role in lymph node development and in mammary
  glands in mice, as well as thymic maturation.
