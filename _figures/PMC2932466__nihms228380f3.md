caption: Potential signal transduction mechanisms involved in the mediation of cellular
  responses induced by secreted MIC-1 cytokine in certain cancer cells. The scheme
  shows the potential signaling transduction elements mediating the cellular responses
  induced by MIC-1 in certain cancer cell types and interactive cross-talks with other
  oncogenic signaling pathways. In analogy with other TGF-β superfamily members, MIC-1
  can interact with type I and II receptor serine/threonine kinases, which remain
  to be identified more precisely in a given cell type. Thereby, MIC-1 can induce
  the formation of heteromeric receptor complex that, in turn, may stimulate different
  R-Smad proteins by phosphorylation and their association with their Smad4 co-partner.
  The R-Smad/Smad4 complexes may translocate to the nucleus, where they may participate
  in co-operation with other factors, such as co-activators or co-repressors, in the
  transcriptional regulation of the expression of gene products that mediate specific
  cellular responses. Moreover, MIC-1 can also induce its cellular effects through
  the stimulation of other signaling elements and cross-talks with intracellular pathways
  initiated by distinct growth factors. Particularly, the activation of the EGFR family
  members, EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 via their phosphorylation which can be induced by
  MIC-1, is shown. The activation of the FAK/RhoA, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK signaling elements
  induced by MIC-1, which may contribute to the acquisition of more malignant behavior
  by cancer cells, including an increase in their migratory and invasive abilities,
  is also illustrated. In addition, the frequent deregulations in the MIC-1 signaling
  network that may promote its oncogenic effects are also indicated. Moreover, the
  cytoprotective effect induced by MIC-1 via the stimulation of the PI3K/Akt survival
  pathway, which may contribute to the resistance of certain cancer cell types, to
  current chemotherapeutic treatment is also indicated. EGFR, epidermal growth factor
