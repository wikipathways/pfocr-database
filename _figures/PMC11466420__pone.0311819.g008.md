caption: BA treatment increased the proportion of MII oocytes, enhanced developmental
  rates, cell numbers, trophectoderm rates, and cell survival compared to control.
  Additionally, BA-treated oocytes exhibited reduced levels of ROS and elevated levels
  of glutathione, accompanied by enhanced expression of antioxidant genes. Especially,
  BA treatment mitigated the negative effects of H2O2-induced ROS activation and the
  Nrf2 inhibitor, brusatol, on meiotic maturation and oocyte quality. These results
  suggest that BA affects beneficial effects on the maturation of porcine oocytes,
  which can be attributable to the activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway
  by BA
