caption: Synaptic localization of endocannabinoid synthesis and degradation. 2-AG
  is synthesized on-demand in the postsynaptic neuron by DAGL. Following synthesis,
  2-AG diffuses into the synaptic cleft and activates CB1 receptors at GABA and glutamate
  terminals. 2-AG signaling can be terminated by MAGL degradation in the presynaptic
  terminal. AEA can be synthesized through multiple pathways (e.g., through a pathway
  involving NAPE-PLD), then diffuses into the synapse to activate CB1 receptors. Extracellular
  AEA undergoes reuptake into the postsynaptic cell and is hydrolyzed by FAAH.
