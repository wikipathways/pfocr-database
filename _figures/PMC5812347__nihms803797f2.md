caption: PSY is a byproduct of metabolism of galactosylceramide (GalCer), one of major
  glycosphingolipids of myelin. Therefore, expression of GalCer synthesizing enzyme
  UDP-galactose ceramide galactosyl transferase (CGT) leading to production of GalCer
  is tightly linked to PSY synthesis and thus PSY-induced OL toxicity under GALC deficient
  conditions. In OL progenitor cells (OPCs) the expression level of CGT is low but
  its expression is upregulated during the differentiation into immature and mature
  OLs. Therefore, psychosine may accumulate in OLs during the late stages of differentiation
  and resulting in failure of myelin formation. In addition, myelin turnover process
  may result in further accumulation of PSY in survived mature OLs and thus ultimately
  lead to loss of OLs and demyelination. Based on the critical role of PSY accumulation
  in the disease processes, numerous therapeutic approaches have been proposed and
  tested to reduce the PSY load. These includes pharmacological inhibition of PSY
  synthesis (L-cycloserine), enzyme replacement therapy, gene and stem cell therapies.
  Recent studies also described the idea of stabilizing the misfolded GALC enzyme
  in KD by pharmacological chaperone and tested in cell culture studies. The loss
  of OLs may induce neuroinflammation via activation of innate immune responses mediated
  by TLR2 and at the same time, the induced neuroinflammation may be amplified by
  PSY released from degenerated OLs. In addition to brain resident cells, such as
  astrocytes and microglia, the infiltrating peripheral immune cells, such as macrophages
  and lymphocytes, are also involved in PSY-induced mechanisms of neuroinflammatory,
  oxidative, and nitrosative stress pathway. In addition, these secondary disease
  processes may involve other disease processes, such as endothelial vascular complications
  and neuronal/axonal loss and thus neuro-muscular dysfunction. Therefore, drugs targeting
  to decrease the PSY load and neuroinflammation (e.g. NSAID, sPLA2 inhibitors) and
  antioxidants (NAC and vitamin D) could be potential alternative therapy or combination
  therapy with other approaches, such as enzyme replacement therapy, gene therapy,
  and stem cell therapy.
