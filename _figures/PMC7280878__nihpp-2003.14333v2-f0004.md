caption: 'Target genes and pathways of COL-3 and CGP-60474 in treating lung injury
  in COVID-19. All pathways were significant enriched in both human COVID-19 patient
  lung tissues and HCC515 cells with ACE2 inhibitor inhibition. The abnormal gene
  expression patterns in these pathways were reversed by COL-3 and/or CGP-60474. Blue
  diamond: Down-regulated gene in disease; Orange diamond: Up-regulated gene in disease;
  Hexagon: Pathway; Blue line: Drug decreases gene expression; Orange line: drug increases
  gene expression; Blue/Orange line width corresponds to the ability to change gene
  expression; Dark green line: Interaction between gene and pathway; Diamond size:
  Importance of gene in the disease; Hexagon size: Importance of pathway in the disease.'
