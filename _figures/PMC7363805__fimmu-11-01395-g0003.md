caption: Cell-dependent and -independent effector mechanisms of complement activation
  and FcR-mediated killing. Complement factor- and antibody-opsonized cancer cells
  can be eliminated through cell-dependent and cell-independent effector mechanisms.
  CRs and FcRs on phagocytes bind opsonins and antibodies, respectively, on the surface
  of targeted cancer cells, followed by phagocytosis and/or release of lytic enzymes
  (granzyme B, perforins) and proinflammatory mediators (TNFα, IFNγ). The classical
  pathway of complement activation mediates a cell-independent form of lytic cell
  death by introducing a MAC in the membrane of antibody opsonized target cells that
  are recognized by complement C1 complex. ADCC, antibody-dependent cell-mediated
