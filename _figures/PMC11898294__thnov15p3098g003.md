caption: Overview of types and mechanism of nanovaccine adjuvants. (A) Nanovaccines
  loaded with TLR4 agonists induce DC maturation and antigen capture, transforming
  the TME from an immunologically “cold” to “hot” state. This leads to increased activation
  of DCs and T cells, thereby improving the efficacy of αPD-1 therapy in colorectal
  cancer models. (B) Manganese-loaded nanovaccines, via oxidative stress and mitochondrial
  DNA leakage, disrupt cellular redox homeostasis. This leads to the activation of
  the cGAS-STING pathway, inducing type I IFN responses and facilitating CD8+ T cell
  infiltration and macrophage activation within the tumor, thus promoting a robust
  anti-tumor immune response. (C) Nanovaccines loaded with cyclic nucleotides stimulate
  the cGAMP-STING signaling pathway, resulting in enhanced CTL and DC responses in
  both tumor and lymphoid tissues. This approach significantly enhances type I IFN
  signaling and inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma growth. (D) Intratumoral administration
  of PC7A-loaded nanovaccines stimulates CXCL9 expression in myeloid cells, leading
  to increased recruitment of IFNγ-expressing CD8+ T cells into the TME. This upregulation
  of CXCL9 enhances anti-tumor immune responses through efficient CD8+ T cell activation
  and infiltration into the tumor
