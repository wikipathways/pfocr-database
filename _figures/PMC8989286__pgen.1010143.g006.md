caption: For the WT, phosphorylated VarA [VarA(~P)] promotes the transcription of
  the sRNAs csrB-D, which sequesters CsrA. L-Asp and m-DAP levels are maintained resulting
  in normal PG and cell shape. In the absence of varA, the lack of the scavenging
  sRNAs results in increased CsrA activity and (directly or indirectly, as shown by
  the dashed arrow) overproduced AspA, which reduces L-Asp levels and impairs m-DAP
  biosynthesis. The PG therefore contains dipeptides, while tetrapeptides are reduced,
  leading to a reduction of cross-links and therefore cell rounding.
