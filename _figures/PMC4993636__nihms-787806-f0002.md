caption: A) Localization of core components in Drosophila epithelia. Under conditions
  of low Hippo pathway activity (left), Wts is associated with its inhibitor, Jub,
  at adherens junctions (AJ), and Hpo is predominantly cytoplasmic, while Yki is nuclear.
  Under conditions of high Hippo pathway activity, Wts localizes with Ex at the marginal
  zone (MZ), and Hpo is recruited to Sav, causing Yki to be cytoplasmic. B) Localization
  of core components in 32 cell mouse blastocysts. In outer TE cells, Hippo signaling
  is low, YAP is nuclear, and Amot is localized to the apical membrane. This is presumed
  to prevent the formation of a LATS activation complex, although the localization
  of LATS proteins has not been determined in this tissue. In inner ICM cells, Hippo
  signaling is high, YAP is cytoplasmic, and Motins (Amot) are localized to cell-cell
  junctions, where, together with Merlin/NF2, they promote phosphorylation and activation
  of LATS [].
