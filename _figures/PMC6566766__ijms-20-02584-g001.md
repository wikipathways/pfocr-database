caption: Involvement of ECs, platelets, and EVs in cancer progression, including angiogenesis,
  invasion, and metastasis. EVs play important roles in these processes through their
  function of cell-to-cell communication. Cancer cells develop favorable microenvironments
  by promoting angiogenesis and procoagulant and proinflammatory activities via the
  secretion of exosomes and hypoxia-induced growth factors. Platelets are activated
  via physical contact with cancer-derived exosomes, thereby resulting in increased
  secretion of platelet-derived microvesicles and the subsequent development of coagulation
  (A). ECs are activated by VEGF-A and FGF-2 released from cancer cells under hypoxic
  conditions and by circulating cancer-derived exosomes. Activated ECs shed microvesicles
  and activate other ECs via the microvesicles and direct interaction (B). Hypoxia
  is involved in tumorigenesis. A hypoxic microenvironment created by cancer cells
  triggers the proangiogenic pathway that involves the cancer-derived exosomes secretion
  (C). Circulating cancer cells and EVs from cancer cells, platelets, and ECs are
  strongly associated with cancer progression, including metastasis. EC, endothelial
  cell; EV, extracellular vesicle; VEGF, vascular endothelia growth factor; FGF, fibroblast
  growth factor; MV, microvesicle; EPC, endothelial progenitor cell.
