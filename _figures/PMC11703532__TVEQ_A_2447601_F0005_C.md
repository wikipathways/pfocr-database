caption: A) Box plot representation of the selected serum and urine metabolites from
  the carnitine metabolism comparing healthy controls (green; n = 84) with specific
  disease stages. Significance levels (*<0.05; **<0.001) for the comparison healthy
  vs. CKD (all stages) are provided. Clear up- or downward trends are portrayed in
  accordance with CKD progression from stage 2 (pink; n = 59) to stage 3 (red; n = 29)
  and 4 (dark red; n = 6). Urine metabolites are normalized to urine creatinine. B)
  Trend lines representing the linear relationship between serum creatinine (X-axis)
  and specific serum metabolites (Y-axis) from the carnitine pathway. Red lines mean
  upward trends, blue lines mean downward trends and grey lines mean unaltered behavior
  in accordance with CKD progression from stage 2 to stage 3 and 4. Spearman correlation
  coefficients are provided with significance levels (*<0.05; **<0.001) for every
  metabolite. The positive ratio of betaine/carnitine and its catabolites is completely
  reversed precisely at the onset of stage 2 CKD
