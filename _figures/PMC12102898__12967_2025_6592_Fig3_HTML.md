caption: NF-κB signaling pathway processes and associated ubiquitination. The NF-κB
  signaling pathway is classified into canonical and non-canonical pathways. The classical
  pathway relies primarily on the activation of the IκB kinase complex β (IKKβ) and
  the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB by the inflammatory immune response,
  leading to nuclear transcription of NF-κB (primarily p50/RelA dimer) molecules.
  The non-classical pathway is stimulated by a cytokine (CD40L, BAFF), which leads
  to the activation of NIK and IKKα, then partial degrading p100 to p52 and forming
  NF-κB molecules with RelB. A large number of E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in
  this pathway, some acting as transducers and others activating or inhibiting the
  NF-κB signaling pathway by ubiquitinating and degrading related proteins
