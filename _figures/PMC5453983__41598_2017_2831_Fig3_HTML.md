caption: 'Both HPV E6 and E7 interfere with p53 function. HPV E6-mediated degradation
  of p53 is well established. By an independent mechanism, the HPV E7 oncoprotein
  interferes with the p53-p21-DREAM pathway. Interference is caused by the abrogation
  of indirect p53-dependent transcriptional repression of many genes required for
  cell cycle progression. E7 sequesters hypo-phosphorylated p130 and p107 proteins,
  thereby preventing them from forming the DREAM transcriptional repressor complex.
  In general, DREAM can bind to four combinations of promoter elements: CHR sites,
  E2F sites, CDE/CHR or E2F/CLE tandem elements. For clarity only genes with CHR or
  E2F sites are depicted as examples. When p130/p107 pocket proteins are sequestered
  and not available for DREAM repressor formation, protein complexes on E2F or CHR
  sites change their composition from repressor to activator complexes. CHR elements
  then bind MMB-FOXM1 and E2F sites bind activating E2F1-3-DP complexes, respectively.
  In conclusion, sequestration of p130 and p107 by HPV E7 abrogates p53-dependent
  repression of cell cycle genes and thus impairs cell cycle checkpoint control by
  p53.'
