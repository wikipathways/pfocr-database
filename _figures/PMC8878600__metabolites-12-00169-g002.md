caption: 'Homeostasis of the Drosophila intestinal epithelium is mediated by ISCs
  that respond to microbiota and damaging agents. Commensal and pathogenic bacteria
  are sensed by the intestinal epithelium and induce innate immune effectors including
  ROS and AMPs. Two ROS-producing enzymes, the NADPH oxidases, Duox and Nox, are activated
  in response to pathogens and commensals, respectively. Duox produces ROS in response
  to pathogen-derived uracil, whereas Nox produces ROS in response to commensal-derived
  lactate. The innate immunity Imd pathway controls ROS-resistant microbes. Recognition
  of the bacterially-derived peptidoglycan (PGN) by the transmembrane receptor PGRP-LC
  and by the intracellular receptor PGRP-LE leads to Imd activation and subsequent
  secretion of AMPs. Other PGRPs (PGRP-LB and PGRP-SC) are enzymatic and negatively
  regulate Imd. Intestinal homeostasis is mediated by ISC mitosis and subsequent differentiation.
  ISC activity is tightly regulated by evolutionarily conserved growth control signaling
  mechanisms, including the Hippo, IIS and TOR pathways. ISC proliferation is also
  regulated by secreted IL-6-like cytokines (Upd1, Upd2, Upd3) that trigger the Jak/STAT
  pathway. EC damage caused by pathogens, drugs and ROS induces the JNK pathway and
  elevates Upd3 in ECs, which, in turn, triggers Jak/STAT activation in the VM and
  the release of EGFs (Vein, Keren and Spitz) by the ISC niche. EGFs activate their
  receptor EGFR in the ISCs and promote ISC proliferation and tissue regeneration.
  The Wg morphogen is also induced in EBs and promotes ISC proliferation via cMyc
  in the infected midguts. EEs sense nutrients and serve as a link between the diet-stimulated
  Dilp3 expression in the VM, which controls ISC proliferation. (ROS: reactive oxygen
