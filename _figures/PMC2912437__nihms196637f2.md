caption: Polyol pathway of glucose metabolism. In polyol pathway glucose is converted
  to sorbitol by a NADPH −dependent enzyme aldose reductase. Later sorbitol is converted
  to fructose by a NAD+ dependent enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase. During hyperglycemia
  excess of sorbitol is formed and being impermeable through the membranes accumulates
  inside the cells and cause osmotic stress. Increase in osmotic stress during hyperglycemia
  has been shown to be the major cause of secondary diabetic complications. Further,
  decrease in the ratio of NAPDH/NAD+ leads to oxidative stress which could be responsible
  for changes in inflammatory signaling.
