caption: 'Potential mechanisms of proinflammatory diets on IBD. The Western diet not
  only increases the permeability of the epithelial barrier by inhibiting the expression
  of mucin 2 and upregulating the concentrations of TLRs and LPS, but also activates
  the mTOR, which further causes intestinal dysfunction and the excessive release
  of proinflammatory cytokines, and the inflammatory response further disrupts the
  balance between Treg and Th17 cells in the intestine, ultimately leading to an increased
  risk of IBD. The high-glucose diet increases the permeability of the epithelial
  barrier and the sensitivity of proinflammatory cytokines, and activates TGF-β by
  upregulating the production of ROS in T cells, thereby promoting the differentiation
  of Th17 cells and ultimately triggering IBD. The high-fat diet could increase oxidative
  stress in the ER of goblet cells and decrease the expression of mucin 2 and claudin1,
  thereby disrupting the intestinal barrier and triggering an inflammatory response,
  and further disrupting the balance between NK T and Treg cells, ultimately exacerbating
  IBD. The high-salt diet could destroy the colonic barrier by reducing the expression
  of mucin 2, occluding, and ZO1, which induces excessive release of proinflammatory
  cytokines, thereby activating the p38/MAPK signaling pathway, disrupting the balance
  between Treg and Th17 cells and ultimately aggravating IBD. In addition, p38/MAPK
  can activate SGK1, which promotes the accumulation of salt in the colon via epithelial
  sodium channels (ENaC) and triggers a proinflammatory “vicious cycle.” →: Pro; ┤:
