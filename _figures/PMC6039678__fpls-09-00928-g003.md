caption: Sugar fluxes regulating defense responses under pathogen attack. Trehalose-6-phosphate
  (T-6-P) is central to the metabolic switch between energy intensive processes like
  starch synthesis and low sugar stress conditions (when under pathogen attack or
  during plant defense signaling). T-6-P regulates the switch between these two conditions
  by regulating the multi-functional heterotrimeric stress regulator, SnRK1. SnRK1
  can perceive low sugar stress and mediate defense against pathogens through post
  translational modification of key metabolic enzymes, activating PCD and bZIP (basic
  leucine zipper) mediated transcriptional reprogramming. Trehalose on the other hand
  can also sense pathogen stress and respond by activating defense genes and blocking
  the energy intensive starch biosynthesis. Sucrose regulates defense signaling both
  positively and negatively by activating secondary metabolite production under low
  sugar conditions on one hand and inhibiting SnRK1 on the other, during normal conditions.
  Additionally, the mitochondrial HXKs are also implicated in activating PCD and defense
  gene activation during pathogen attack. However, little is known if Glucose mediates
  the process. Thus, the components of signalling pathway of sugars (like sucrose,
  glucose and trehalose) that maintains the balance between stress conditions and
  homeostatsis are yet to be discovered and are indicated by “?” in the figure.
