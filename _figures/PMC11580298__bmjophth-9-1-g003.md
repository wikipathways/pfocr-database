caption: Genomic verification test results for glaucoma closest diseases on glaucoma-related
  hub diseases-biomarkers interaction network. (A) There were 27 overlapping genes
  for glaucoma and asthma from GWAS data. (B) Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network
  for glaucoma–asthma genes. Only PTHLH-ETS1 and ATXN2-RBFO1 showed significant connections.
  (C) Pathway enrichment analysis results for glaucoma–asthma genes. These genes were
  mapped mainly on cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granule, ribonucleoprotein granule,
  trans-Golgi network, cytoplasmic stress granule and histone deacetylase complex.
  (D) Glaucoma shared three disease-specific genes with hepatitis B. (E) No connection
  was identified for the three glaucoma–hepatitis B genes. (F) Pathway enrichment
  results for glaucoma–hepatitis B genes. These genes were mapped on the Metabolism
  pathway. (G) Nine genes were identified as glaucoma–myocardial infarction (MI) shared
  disease-specific genes. (H) PPI network for glaucoma–MI genes. (I) GMDS and FNDC3B
  showed a significant relationship on PPI network
