caption: 'Examination of Differentially expressed (Progressors vs NonProgressors)
  and mutated genes in TCGA HNSCC subjects in the context of a stylized pathway representation
  of the Reactome Integrin Cell Surface Interactions Pathway, which was significantly
  enriched for the putative DE candidate genes (False Discovery Rate Adjusted P-value = 0.00424).
  Note that three of these genes are also CTCF binding sites: VTN, FGG, and FGB'
