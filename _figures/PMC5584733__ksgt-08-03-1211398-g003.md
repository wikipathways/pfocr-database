caption: Targeting Rac1 activation and downstream signaling via blocking Rac1 lipid
  modifications. (A) The isoprenoid pathway is a multi-step chemical cascade, initiated
  by the 3-hydroxy-2-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase). HMG-CoA
  resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and represents a rate-limiting step in
  the conversion of acetyl-CoA into mevalonate, which is converted into isopentenyl
  diphosphate (IPP), the precursor of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate
  (FPP). Via the action of squalene synthase, FPP can be converted into squalene,
  the committed precursor for cholesterol production. Alternatively, FPP can be converted
  into geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) by GGPP synthase. Both FPP and GGPP can serve
  as lipid backbones for protein prenylation, which involves the addition of a farnesyl
  or geranylgeranyl moiety to the cysteine residue within the CAAX motif (where C
  represents the cysteine, AA represent 2 aliphatic amino acids and X is the terminal
  amino acid) by farnesyltransferases (FTases) or geranylgeranyltransferases (GGTases),
  respectively. (B) Following Rac1 protein expression, the CAAX motif (CLLL) located
  at the carboxyl-terminus is recognized by GGTase type I (GGTase I). This results
  in the covalent attachment of a geranylgeranyl moiety to cysteine 189. (C) Rac1
  prenylation promotes Rac1 translocation and association with the ER membrane where
  the RAS-converting CAAX endopeptidase (RCE1) and the isoprenylcysteine carboxyl
  methyltransferase (ICMT) mediate Rac1 post-prenylation modifications on the cytosolic
  surface of the ER. First, RCE1 cleaves the 3 amino acids (LLL) following the prenylated
  cysteine residue. This exposes the carboxyl-group of the cysteine amino acid (COO−),
  thus allowing the transfer of a methyl group (CH3) from S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet)
  to Rac1 by ICMT, releasing S-adenosyl- L homocysteine (AdoHcy) as a by-product.
  The fully processed prenylated Rac1 protein can then be trafficked to the plasma
  membrane. Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs) have been implicated
  in mediating Rac1 extraction from the ER membrane, with the RhoGDI-Rac1 association
  being tightly regulated and reversible, thus allowing cycling between Rac1 membrane/nuclear
  translocation and cytoplasmic sequestration. Rac1 prenylation and processing also
  primes Rac1 for palmitoylation, in which a 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate is attached
  to cysteine 178 by palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs). Rac1 palmitoylation also depends
  on the polybasic region (PBR) within the carboxyl-terminus of Rac1. It is unclear
  whether palmitoylation of Rac1 occurs in the cytoplasm or on the plasma membrane.
  It is also yet to be determined whether palmitoylation preferentially occurs on
  GDP-bound or GTP-bound Rac1, for simplicity the latter was not depicted in the figure.
  Rac1 palmitoylation enhances Rac1 stability and mediates Rac1 localization to the
  plasma membrane, particularly to lipid-ordered subdomains, as well as nuclear translocation.
  Statins, GGTase I inhibitors (GGTIs) and PAT inhibitors have been shown to target
  HMG-CoA reductase, GGTase I and PAT enzymes, respectively. As a result, all 3 classes
  of compounds have been shown to disrupt Rac1 localization, activation and downstream
  signaling.
