caption: Signaling pathway and transcription factors involved in HPR1 gene expression
  in cancer. Mutations and/or overexpression of the growth factor receptor genes such
  as EGFR and its downstream signaling molecules such as RAS and BRAF genes result
  in increased expression and/or translocation of the Ets family transcription factors
  such as GABP and Ets-1. These transcription factors in cooperation with several
  other transcription factors overexpressed in cancer, such as Sp1 and Egr-1, lead
  to HPR1 expression in cancer. HPR1 promoter demethylation and p53 mutations also
  contribute to increased HPR1 gene expression (not shown).
