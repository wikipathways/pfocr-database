caption: HCV Infected Cellular Distribution of PIPs, Binding Proteins. Diagram of
  HCV-infected cell showing enrichment of PI4P at the ER and membranous web, with
  model of potential HCV assembly pathway in conjunction with lipid droplets (LDs)
  and ApoB precursor lipoprotein []. HCV RNA is produced in replication complexes
  at membranous web structures juxtaposed to ER, and in close association with LDs.
  Viral assembly site is unknown, but viral particles may associate with ApoB precursor
  lipoproteins. Infectious viral particles are then likely trafficked through the
  Golgi and released at the PM. PIP associated proteins known to affect the HCV lifecycle
  are highlighted. Akt pathway-PI3K (green text). Replication-PI4KIIIα (blue text).
  Secretion-PI4KIIIβ, OSBP, CERT, GOLPH3 (red text).
