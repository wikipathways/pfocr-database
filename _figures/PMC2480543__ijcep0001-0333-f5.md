caption: 'A schematic composite of the complex protein circuitries identified by the
  authors and others [–] utilizing immunohistochemistry in cases of prostate cancer
  and HGPIN and depicting their interrelationships with the mTOR pathway. Specifically,
  downstream signaling by the tyrosine kinases, PDGFR-alpha, EGFR and IGF-IR and their
  signaling ligands, proceeds through the PI3′-K/Akt and ras /Raf kinase/ERK1/2 pathways.
  The former is facilitated in some cases by a reduction in PTEN, an inhibitor of
  PI3′-K and leads to phosphorylative activation of mTOR and in turn its effector,
  p70S6K; and the latter (p-ERK 1/2) converges on p70S6K promoting cell cycle progression.
  Their impact is evidenced by progressively increased proliferation indices (Ki-67
  expression/ percentages) and cell proliferation. Such bipathway stimulation and
  signal transduction also leads to the phosphorylative inactivation of 4E-BP1 (p-4E-BP1),
  thereby inhibiting ((−)) 4E-BP-1 and resulting in unbound eIF4E to effect mRNA translation
  and the synthesis of proteins that promote cell growth and anti-apoptosis. Relatedly,
  p-p70S6K promotes phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6) that also participates
  in mRNA translations. Notably, HIF-1alpha induced by mTOR signaling is relevant
  to VEGF production and coincides with the increased expression levels of these two
  protein analytes in prostate cancer and HGPIN. * indicates established immunohistochemical
