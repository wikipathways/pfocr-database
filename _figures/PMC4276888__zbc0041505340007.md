caption: Schematic of proposed TXNIP/miR-200/Zeb1/E-cadherin signaling pathway. Diabetes
  increases beta cell TXNIP expression, which leads to activation of the mitochondrial
  death pathway and promotes cleaved caspase-3, apoptosis, and beta cell loss. Increased
  beta cell TXNIP also induces expression of microRNA-200, which, by targeting and
  down-regulating anti-apoptotic Zeb1, further contributes to the increase in cleaved
  caspase-3 and beta cell apoptosis. TXNIP-induced microRNA-200 and Zeb1 reduction
  also lead to an increase in E-cadherin, a marker of decreased EMT. This inhibition
  of EMT may further exacerbate beta cell loss by inhibiting beta cell expansion and
  promoting apoptosis.
