caption: Impact of Glycolysis in RA Angiogenesis. FLS in RA efficiently produce ATP
  via glycolysis, providing essential energy that facilitates the activation of the
  Rho/ROCK signaling pathway. This pathway plays a pivotal role in upregulating the
  secretion of various pro-angiogenic factors, including VEGF, FGF, and MMPs. Moreover,
  lactate, a metabolic byproduct of glycolysis, further stimulates the expression
  of endogenous FGF, thus expediting the process of angiogenesis (left). In ECs located
  in RA synovium, the glycolytic process is likely influenced by the enzyme phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase
  isozyme 3 (PFKFB3). PFKFB3 enhances the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-2,6-bisphosphate,
  leading to increased lactate production. This, in turn, promotes the phosphorylation
  of Akt, facilitating pathological angiogenesis (right)
