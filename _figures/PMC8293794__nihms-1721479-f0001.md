caption: The CD4 T cell-IL-21:IL21R-CD8 T cell axis. High TCR signaling leads to increased
  expression of PD-1 as well as of other molecules associated with TFH and TPH polarization
  such as ICOS and the ability to produce IL-21. When these CD4 T cells enter tissues,
  e.g. the joint space, and are activated they produce IL-21. This CD4 T cell-derived
  IL-21 signals to CD8 T cells activated through their TCRs. The insert shows the
  specific IL21R signaling pathway that occurs within the CD8 T cell. JAK1/3 signals
  primarily through STAT3 which leads to transcription of many different genes associated
  with TRM. Signaling also occurs through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The combined results of these signals ascribe
  the cell to a metabolic profile that supports chronic inflammation including through
  the release of IFNγ. The IFNγ from the CD8 T cell furthers the inflammation in the
  joint space leading to tissue destruction and pain. Figure image created with BioRender.com.
