caption: 'The formation and degradation of differential metabolites in the metabolic
  pathways. Color gradients represent relative concentrations, with red indicating
  higher concentrations and blue indicating lower concentrations. Horizontal blocks
  represent different inoculation methods, with single fermentation depicted on the
  left and mixed fermentation on the right. Vertical blocks denote different fermentation
  times, from top to bottom: 1, 7, and 18 d. (For interpretation of the references
  to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
  article.)'
