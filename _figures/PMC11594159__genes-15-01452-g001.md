  on Wikipedia https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP268.html, accessed on 5 October
  2024. On the left, in green, is the Sender cell. On the right, in red, is the Receiver
  cell. The Nucleus is depicted within the Receiver cell. The gene names and symbols
  are depicted in blocks on the figure, discussed directly below and listed, with
  additional information, in Table 2a,b and Supplementary Table S1
