caption: Comparison between simulations and MFA experiments. Comparison between selected
  simulated fluxes using molecular weights, thermodynamic penalties, and a combination
  of the two costs, and Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) data. Fluxes are normalized
  by glucose to glucose-6-phosphate conversion rates. X-axes values are kept constant
  for all plots. Reaction names are taken from the Ecoli iJR904 model []. Yellow boxes
  indicate Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), blue indicates glycolysis, green indicates
  TCA cycle and red indicates other reactions
