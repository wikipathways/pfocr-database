caption: Figure 1. The immunomodulating effects of a multifunctional chimeric chaperone
  in the tumor microenvironment. Flagrp170 produced by tumor cells delivers tumor-associated
  antigens to antigen-presenting cells (e.g., DCs) for efficient cross-presentation
  and T-cell priming. The NFκB signaling pathway is triggered in DCs upon infection
  with Flagrp170-encoding adenoviruses as well as by extracellular Flagrp170, resulting
  in their functional activation. The upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules and
  the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-12, IL-12) promote the
  effector functions of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).
  These cells, possibly via interferon γ (IFNγ) and granzyme B, kill malignant cells,
  hence causing the release of Flagrp170-tumor antigen complexes that may further
  amplify T-cell antitumor responses.
