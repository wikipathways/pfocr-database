caption: Activation of Gαs/olf proteins on D1-like receptors stimulates adenylate
  cyclase (). Adenylate cyclase induces production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP), leading to activation of protein kinase A, (PKA). PKA generates cellular
  signaling cascades necessary for long-term plasticity. PKA also induces phosphorylation
  of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein (DARPP-32), which inhibits
  protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Inhibitory interactions between DARPP-32 and PP1 regulate
  neural plasticity through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways (Valjent
  et al., 2004). Activation of Gαi/o proteins on D2-like receptors inhibits adenylyl
  cyclase, regulating cAMP activity. The phospholipase C pathway can be induced by
  Gβ and Gγ proteins from D2 receptors, G proteins from D1-like receptors, or G proteins
  from D1-D2 heteromers. These convergent pathways regulate the PLC-mediated cleavage
  of the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). DAG activity regulates protein kinase C, while
  IP3 binding to IP3 receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum increases intracellular
  calcium (Ca2+) levels. Increased Ca2+ levels leads to activation of protein phosphatase
  2B (PP2B) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling cascades
  that have been identified as regulators of long-term plasticity. Expression of these
  different dopamine receptor types varies across neuronal populations innervated
  by dopamine neurons.
