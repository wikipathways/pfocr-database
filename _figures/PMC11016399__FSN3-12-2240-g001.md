caption: RESV and inflammatory parameters. Numerous cell signaling pathways are activated
  by inflammation. RESV directly inhibits the phosphoinositide 3‐kinases (PI3K)/Akt,
  mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways which lead to NF‐κB
  activation that stimulate the production of several inflammatory markers. It suppresses
  the activation of NF‐κB directly through the facilitation of the degradation and
  phosphorylation of IκBα, one of the proteins associated with IκB. A downregulation
  of Janus kinase (JAK) is one of the effects of RESV on signal transducers and activators
  of transcription (STAT) protein phosphorylation and activation. The overall STAT
  signaling pathway could potentially be impacted by resveratrol by suppressing the
  activation of JAKs or other signaling molecules upstream of STAT proteins.
