caption: Role of ILC3s in the response against C. rodentium. Vasoactive intestinal
  peptide (VIP), released by neurons in lymphoid patches in close contact with CCR6+
  ILC3s, inhibits their IL-22 secretion. Simultaneously, ILC3s have a negative intrinsic
  modulation, expressing both RANK and RANKL, which suppresses the induction of IL-22
  and IL-17. Susceptibility to C. rodentium infection is caused by these inhibitory
  mechanisms. The interaction between CCR6+ ILC3 and TfH cells through MHC-II in the
  mesenteric lymph nodes limits the TfH responses as well as pathogen specific-IgA.
  Simultaneously, ILC3s expression of TL1A receptor DR3 confers protection against
  C. rodentium. SCFAs produced by the commensal microbiota from dietary fibers increase
  IL-22 secretion in ILC3s via the FFAR2/FFAR3-AKT/mTOR/STAT3 molecular pathway, thus
  contributing to the elimination of the infection. Moreover, ILC3-derived GM-CSF
  production can improve antimicrobial responses by increasing the expression of IL-1β
  and MHC-II in macrophages (M1-like macrophages). Furthermore, Vitamins D and A in
  the diet increase ILC3’s synthesis of IL-22, which protects against C. rodentium;
  vitamin A’s molecular mechanism is via HIC (Hypermethylated in cancer 1).
