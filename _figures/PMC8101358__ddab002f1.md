caption: Schematic overview of the biosynthetic pathways for (A) N-acyl ethanolamines
  (NAEs) and (B) ceramides (CERs). (A) NAE species, including the endocannabinoid
  anandamide (AEA), are produced through four independent enzymatic pathways from
  the membrane phospholipid precursor (N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine; NAPE). Fatty
  acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) degrades NAEs to free fatty acids (such as arachidonic
  acid for AEA) and ethanolamine. (B) CER species are biosynthesised via the enzyme
  serine palmitoyltransferase (SPTLC 1-3) that converts palmitoyl-CoA and L-serine
  to 3-keto dihydrosphingosine, in the rate-limiting step of the sphingolipid de novo
  pathway. The resulting dihydrosphingosine is coupled to various fatty acids via
  ceramide synthases (CERS) to generate dihydroceramides CER[NDS] that are further
  converted to CER[NS] via the enzyme delta 4-desaturase (DEGS1). Conversion of these
  pro-apoptotic CER[NS] species to sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate, with roles
  in cell survival, degrades ceramides through reversible reactions. CER[NS] are also
  reversibly converted to sphingomyelin or further metabolized to ceramide 1-phosphate).
  Measured lipid species are in bold; genes encoding enzymes are in italics; genes
  identified through SNPs that associated at GWAS with circulating lipid levels are
  in red.
