caption: The iNOS pathway is identified as one of the significant pathways by IPA.
  It is also part of NOROS, the most significant pathway. Here all the genes were
  overlaid to the DEGs. All the up-regulated DEGs are red while CALM is the solitary
  down-regulated DEG (green). Members of the IK-B family are both up- or down- regulated.
