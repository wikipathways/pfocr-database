caption: 'Illustration of the main mechanisms of radiation-induced lung injury. Radiation-induced
  lung injury contains three inseparable phases along with time: (1) acute radiation
  responses; (2) radiation pneumonitis; and (3) pulmonary fibrosis. Once exposed to
  ionizing radiation, cell damage occurs in the alveolar and vascular epithelium.
  Subsequently, inflammatory cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and
  lymphocytes are recruited to the damaged tissue with the upregulation of chemotactic
  factors and adhesion molecules. Cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-4,
  and VEGF, are secreted and released to promote inflammation or tissue restoration
  concurrently. Radiation pneumonitis occurs due to an imbalance between restoration
  and inflammation. Radiation-induced ROS stimulates downstream signaling via the
  ERK/GSK-3β/snail axis. Increased GSK-3β then activates TGF-β and leads to an increase
  in β-catenin levels, which maintains stemness of type II AEC and promotes its differentiation
  into fibroblasts. Additionally, IGFBP7 is enhanced by TGF-β and is involved in the
  EMT of AECs through the ERK signaling pathway. Several other molecules, such as
  αvβ6 integrin and VTN, and signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis, can
  also promote the expression of TGF-β. Abundant TGF-β induces fibroblast proliferation
  and differentiation into myofibroblasts, and promotes collagen synthesis. Excessive
  deposition of ECM eventually results in pulmonary fibrosis. Abbreviations: IR: Ionizing
