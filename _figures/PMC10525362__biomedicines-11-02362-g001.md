caption: Schematic illustration of the vitamin D synthesis pathway and signaling mechanism.
  The primary variants of vitamin D found in the natural environment encompass vitamin
  D3 (cholecalciferol), which is biosynthesized in the epidermis of animals and humans
  upon exposure to sunlight, as well as acquired through dietary source (DBP = vitamin
  D-binding protein).
