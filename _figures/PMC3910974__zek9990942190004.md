caption: Pathway model showing two distinct roles for Sck1 in nutrient signaling.
  Work described here and elsewhere suggests that Sck1 is both a negative regulator
  of cAMP signaling via Gpa2 regulation and a kinase that acts in parallel to PKA,
  possibly as a sensor of nitrogen levels. Gpa2 activation of PKA is via the activation
  of adenylyl cyclase (Git2/Cyr1; not shown).
