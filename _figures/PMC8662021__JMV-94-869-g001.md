caption: 'The cis‐ and trans‐signaling pathway of interleukin (IL)‐6: The cis signaling
  is mediated by soluble IL‐6R, whereas trans‐signaling is mediated by membrane‐bound
  IL‐6. Trans‐signaling proceeds with STAT3 activation, transcription of which would
  result in the synthesis and release of cytokines. However, both the signaling involves
  gp130 activation'
