caption: CD47 regulation of autophagy. In the presence of cellular stress, blockade
  of CD47 activates gene expression of beclin-1 and autophagy related proteins (ATG)
  5 and 7 that limit BCL-2 mediated pathways to induce cell death. The increase in
  beclin-1 ATG5 and ATG7 leads to increased autophagic flux by increasing expression
  of LC3 to form the autophagosome membrane and stimulates p62, which targets unwanted
  cargo to be degraded in the autophagosome. The radioprotective effect of CD47 is
  reversed by the administration of 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which inhibits early activation
  of autophagy, or the lysosomotropic agent hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which inhibits
  autophagy at late stages of the pathway.
