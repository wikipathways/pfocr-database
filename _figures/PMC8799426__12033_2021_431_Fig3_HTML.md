caption: a Cas13-crRNA complex through variable delivery systems (such as AAV delivery
  method) can target virus genes (such as ORF1ab, RdRp, S, and N genes) to degrade
  viral genome and block genome expression of virus. b Production of humanized ACE2
  mouse model through the microinjection of CRISPR–Cas9 complex and human ACE2 template
  sequence in mouse zygote to substitute mouse ACE2 gene and express in the lung,
  intestine, and brain of a mouse under its promoter. This humanized model is compared
  with a wild-type mouse in SARS-CoV-2 infectious conditions. c The pooled or arrayed
  CRISPR genome-wide screening is done for analysis of top-ranked gene clusters in
  the pathway of virus infection in host cells. In this direction, designing of sgRNA
  library for targeting candidate host cell gene to production of knocked out cells
  and challenging with SARS-CoV-2 virus are done for determining of anti-viral and
  pro-viral genes from sensitive and resistant cells
