caption: The signaling pathways involved with miR-1269a and miR-1269b. A schematic
  illustration of the roles of miR-1269a and miR-1269b in multiple signaling pathways.
  miR-1269a can inhibit apoptosis by inhibiting TP53, the core of the p53 signaling
  pathway, and Casp9, the initiation factor of apoptosis. miR-1269a up-regulates TGF-β
  signaling by suppressing its antagonists Smad7 and HOXD10. TGF-β, in turn, up-regulates
  miR-1269a via SOX4 to form a positive feedback loop in the TGF-β signaling pathway.
  miR-1269a also activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by inhibiting RASSF9. miR-1269b
  participates in the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by inhibiting SVEP1
  and PTEN, and HBx promotes tumor progression by inducing miR-1269b to up-regulate
  CDC40 in an NF-κB dependent manner.
