caption: 'This diagram shows the image of an animal that has the “thermostat” turned
  on by hsf-1neuro (in both branches) or by growing animals at 25°C (only in the acid
  lipase branch). Fat desaturase branch: TAX-2/4–expressing neurons are sufficient
  but not necessary to control fat-6/7 expression in the gut. The neurohormonal TGF-β/BMP
  signal is down-regulated in the VNC neurons. In this model, the correct dose of
  BMP is key for Fat-6/7 expression in the gut and requires additional and redundant
  signals for fat-6/7 expression. Acid-lipase branch: HSF-1 is both necessary and
  sufficient to control this pathway. The HSF-1 thermostat works independently of
  TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway. The HSR is not required within TAX-2/4–expressing neurons,
  but presumably in other neurons that are in close proximity to them. Both the neurohormonal
  signals and TFs required for this pathway remain unknown. Both pathways are required
  for fat remodeling and survival at warmer temperatures. BMP, bone morphogenetic
  protein; HSF-1, heat shock factor 1; hsf-1neuro, neuronal overexpression of hsf-1;
  HSR, heat shock response; TF, transcription factor; VNC, ventral nerve cord.'
