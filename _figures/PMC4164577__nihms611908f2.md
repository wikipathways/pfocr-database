caption: Altered brainstem projections in mice with mutations that reduce EphB signaling.
  A. Normal pathway from AVCN and PVCN (indicated as VCN) to MNTB in wild type mice.
  Nearly all of the projections are contralateral, terminating in a calyx of Held
  in the appropriate frequency region. Blue color gradients refer to frequency axis;
  dark blue represents high frequencies. LSO, lateral superior olive; MSO, medial
  superior olive. B. Mutations that block reverse signaling through ephrin-B receptors
  result in a significant number of ipsilateral calyceal projections (). These ipsilateral
  projections in most cases appear as branches from contralaterally projecting VCN
  axons. In some cases, ipsilateral projections grow directly to the MNTB in the absence
  of a contralaterally projecting branch. For clarity, MSO and LSO are omitted; these
  nuclei have not been studied in the context of Eph signaling.
