caption: Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT3 pathways
  in the inflammatory response. STAT signaling is activated by cytokines (IL-6, IL-11,
  and IFN-γ). Canonically, ligand binding to receptors triggers Janus kinase (JAK)
  phosphorylation and, subsequently, STATs, followed by STAT dimerization. The dimers
  translocate to the nucleus, where it drives transcription of target genes involved
  in inflammation. The signaling steps that are affected by phytochemicals in the
  STAT1/3 pathway axis are presented.
