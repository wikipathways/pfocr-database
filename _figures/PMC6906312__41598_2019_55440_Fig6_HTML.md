caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differential metabolites in POD 7 between
  GIK and TPN. Analysis based on comparison of TPN versus GIK in POD 7. Merged network
  combining primary signaling related to the differential metabolites expressed in
  the ingenuity pathway analysis. Rectangle represented elevated (red) or decreased
  (green) metabolites. The peripheral represented metabolic pathways. The central
  circle represented signaling complex or group. The full and dotted line represented
  direct (full) and indirect (dotted) correlation to signaling. The full line in purple
  represented the direct correlation between metabolic pathways and metabolites.
