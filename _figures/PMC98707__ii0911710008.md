caption: Working hypothesis for the mechanism of action of glycine in PG-PS-induced
  arthritis in the rat. PG-PS from gram-positive bacteria plays an important role
  in the etiology of arthritis. It is proposed that PG-PS stimulates CD14 and TLR2,
  resulting in increases in intracellular calcium. This stimulates NADPH oxidase and
  generates superoxide, which activates NF-κB, leading to TNF-α production. Glycine
  (GLY) blunts PG-PS-induced increases in [Ca2+]i, an effect reversed by low concentrations
  of strychnine or depletion of chloride. The inhibition of superoxide production
  and TNF-α generation by glycine is most likely due to blunting of the intracellular
  calcium signaling pathway. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that glycine
  activates a glycine receptor, leading to influx of chloride which hyperpolarizes
  the macrophage membrane and decreases the opening time of voltage-dependent calcium
  channels. In vivo treatment with glycine blocks PG-PS-induced arthritis most likely
  via a similar mechanism.
