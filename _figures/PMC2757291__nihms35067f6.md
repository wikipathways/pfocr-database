caption: E-CD4 T cells are positively selected through heterotypic interactions between
  DP thymocytes and MHC class II-expressing cTEC (pathway 1). Thymocyte-mediated T
  cell selection pathway select T-CD4 T cells and NKT cells through homotypic interactions
  between TCR on developing DP thymocytes with MHC class II or CD1d on DP thymocytes,
  respectively (pathway 2). Our studies indicate that the SAP/Fyn/PKCθ signaling cascade
  is a common pathway required for the generation of both T-CD4 T cells and immature
  NKT cells, while T-bet and IL-15R are selectively involved in the maturation of
  NKT cells. Whether E-CD4 T cells and T-CD4 T cells share similar molecular requirements
  for their maturation is currently unknown.
