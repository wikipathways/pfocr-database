caption: 'Simplified schematic depicting the mTOR pathway and associated “mTORopathies.”
  The mTOR pathway involves 2 complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 integrates cellular
  energy levels via upstream kinases and controls many downstream functions, including
  transcription and translation, lipid synthesis, cell growth, cell proliferation,
  cell survival, and cell death. mTORC2 has been less extensively studied, but has
  downstream functions involved in cytoskeletal organization. mTORC1 is sensitive
  to rapamycin inhibition, whereas mTORC2 is relatively insensitive to rapamycin (at
  least during the acute phase). Mutations in different upstream and downstream aspects
  of the mTOR pathway have been associated with various malformations of cortical
  development and epilepsy, including tuberous sclerosis complex, focal cortical dysplasia,
  and hemimegalencephaly. Abbreviations: 4E-BP1, elongation factor 4E binding protein
  1; AMPK, 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; DEPDC5, DEP domain-containing
  5; eIF4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; mTORC1, mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 1; mTORC2, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3-kinase;
  PMSE, polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, symptomatic epilepsy; PTEN, phosphatase and
  tensin homolog on chromosome 10; Rheb, Rhas-homolog expressed in brain; S6K1, S6

  1 protein; TSC2, tuberous sclerosis complex 2 protein.'
