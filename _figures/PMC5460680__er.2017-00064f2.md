caption: Metabolic fates of glucose in mammalian cells. Major biochemical pathways
  are denoted in red, with the main product from each pathway shown in blue. Glucose
  is used to produce not only energy but also intermediate metabolites for biosynthesis.
  Several key enzymes are highlighted in green. Note that citrate can be exported
  from mitochondria and converted to acetyl-coA in the nucleus to exert epigenetic
  regulation on gene expression. Although the metabolic pathways are common among
  different cell types, their relative importance likely varies depending on the biological
  function of each cell. G3pdh, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; G6pdh, G6P dehydrogenase;
  Gfat, glutamine–fructose-6-phosphate transaminase; Pdh, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  Phgdh, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; Ldha, lactate dehydrogenase; OAA, oxaloacetate;
  PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; UDPGlcNAc, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine.
