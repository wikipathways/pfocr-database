caption: 'The calculated pathways from chorismate to pyruvate in the model before
  (A) and after (B) adding demand reactions for all carbon-containing molecules. The
  chorismate input flux was set at 10 mmol/gDCW/h, equal to 100 mmolC/gDCW/h as chorismate
  contains 10 carbon atoms. Three carbon-containing metabolites were produced in pathway
  A: pyruvate (3 C atoms), enterochelin (30 C) and indole (8 C). The output flux of
  pyruvate is only 2 mmol/gDCW/h, accounting for only 6 % of the carbon input from
  chorismate. The main outputs of pathway A are actually enterochelin (45 % C) and
  indole (44 % C). Pyruvate is just a byproduct of two reactions in the pathway, and
  most of the produced pyruvate is also reused through serine (dashed lines are a
  simplified representation of many reactions in the pathway) to produce enterochelin.
  Therefore, it is not reasonable to regard pathway A as converting chorismate to
  pyruvate. After adding demand reactions for 4-hydroxybenzoate, pathway B that contains
  only one main reaction in which pyruvate is a product was obtained. ichor: Isochorismate;
