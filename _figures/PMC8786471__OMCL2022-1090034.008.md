caption: Schematic illustration of the possible mechanism of the protective effect
  of eupatilin against ototoxic drug-induced apoptosis. As confirmed, cisplatin treatment
  markedly induces the generation of ROS and triggers the mitochondrial apoptotic
  pathway. Eupatilin treatment could reduce the generation of ROS, increase the expression
  levels of antiapoptotic proteins, decrease the expression levels of proapoptotic
  proteins, and reduce the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK protein, suggesting that
  eupatilin protect hair cell death through the p38/JNK signaling pathway and finally
  ameliorate the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.
