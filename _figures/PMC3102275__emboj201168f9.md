caption: Model for the mechanisms characterized in the present study showing the sequence
  of events that mediate CO2 regulation of S-type anion channels and stomatal closing.
  In this model, CA1/CA4, OST1 and SLAC1 function as positive mediators, and the HT1
  protein kinase functions as a negative regulator of high CO2-incuded stomatal closing.
  [Ca2+]i sensitivity priming and [Ca2+]i-independent mechanisms are proposed to regulate
  SLAC1-dependent S-type anion currents in parallel via an ‘AND'-like gate. In this
  ‘AND'-like gate, one ‘input' occurs via the OST1 pathway, and the other ‘input'
  is mediated by the Ca2+ sensitivity priming pathway. Convergence with abscisic acid
  (ABA) signalling is also indicated here. CA, carbonic anhydrase; OST1, open stomata
  1; HT1, high leaf temperature 1; SLAC1, slow anion channel; PYR/RCAR, ABA receptors.
