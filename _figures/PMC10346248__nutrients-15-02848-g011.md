caption: Schematic models of the NRF2 signaling pathway and its regulatory mechanisms
  in human skeletal muscle. (A) Basal signaling after 48 h of Zynamite PX® supplementation.
  * p < 0.05 compared to the control group. (B) Signaling elicited by high-intensity
  exercise without supplementation. * p < 0.05 compared to T1. (C) Signaling elicited
  by high-intensity exercise after supplementation with Zynamite PX®. * p < 0.05 compared
  to T1. Stimulating effects are represented by thin blue connecting lines. Changes
  in cellular localizations are presented with black dashed lines. The thick arrows
  in darker blue color located close to the specific markers illustrate this study’s
  overall protein expression changes. Red crosses indicate suppression of the expected
  signaling response to high-intensity exercise following supplementation with Zynamite
  PX®. Activatory/inhibitory phosphorylations are depicted in green/red circles
