caption: Mla mutants normally exhibit a 2-4X increase in OMV production, due in large
  part to the perturbed asymmetry of the OM (). Additional evidence in E. coli suggests
  that fatty acids derived from OM phospholipase activity (PldA) stimulate lipid A
  biosynthesis (). These factors result in an increased need for de novo fatty acid
  biosynthesis to contend with the rate of loss at the OM. Concurrently in the cytoplasm,
  the stringent response alarmone ppGpp has been shown to inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis
  (). We know that Mla-null mutants (demonstrated here with dashed lines) with obgE*
  accumulate ppGpp at levels greater than that of WT (, ). ObgE* could be acting through
  either partial inhibition of the hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp to GTP/GDP (red bars) or
  stimulating the hydrolysis of pppGpp to ppGpp (red arrow). The resultant accumulation
  of ppGpp would repress fatty acid biosynthesis despite the global need for increased
  biosynthesis due to OMV production.
