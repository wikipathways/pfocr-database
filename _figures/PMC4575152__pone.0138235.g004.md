caption: Glucose is metabolized by EMP pathway and acetate is overproduced, which
  can be then activated to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is incorporated in the TCA and the
  glyoxylate shunt. During growth on succinate, gluconeogenesis is required for the
  formation of PEP and further intermediates of the EMP pathway, whereas the TCA cycle
  serves as the main catabolic process under these conditions. MS, malate synthase;
