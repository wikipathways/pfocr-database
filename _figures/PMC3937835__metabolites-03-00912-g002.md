caption: (A) The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in the crtD− mutant R. rubrum ST4.
  The central pathway (shown in black) represents the linear sequence of metabolic
  reactions as established for the wild-type pathway to spirilloxanthin [,], but lacking
  the 3,4- and 3′,4′-dehydrogenation steps catalyzed by CrtD []. The minor pathways,
  the alternative spheroidene pathway and the 3,4-didehydrolycopene pathway, are shown
  in the red and green boxes, respectively. The putative CrtI branch points linking
  the major and minor pathways are indicated. (B) The wild-type carotenoid biosynthetic
  pathway following the intermediate, rhodopin, is shown in the blue box.
