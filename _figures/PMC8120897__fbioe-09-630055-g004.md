caption: 'The role of nanoparticles in overcoming the BBB for efficient delivery of
  therapeutic moieties to treat AD. (A) Image of human brain. (B) Components of the
  BBB. (C) Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) for imaging and targeted drug delivery
  to the AD brain. (D) Different pathways of transport (a–e) across BBB utilized by
  functionalized NPs. (a) Transport of NPs through cellular transport proteins; (b)
  transport of NPs through tight junctions; (c) transport of NPs via receptor-mediated
  transcytosis; (d) transport of NPs via transcellular pathway following diffusion,
  specifically adopted by gold NPs; (e) transport of cationic NPs and liposomes via
  adsorption-mediated transcytosis. (E) Effect of functionalized NPs in treating AD
  via the degradation of tau aggregates and efflux of Aβ fibrils after getting solubilized
  by the NPs. AD: Alzheimer’s disease; NPs: Nanoparticles; BBB: Blood–brain barrier.'
