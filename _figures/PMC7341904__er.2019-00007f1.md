caption: Upregulation of the MAPK pathway in tumor cells leads to proliferation and
  progression of thyroid cancer. Increased signaling along the MAPK pathway is caused
  by genetic mutations occurring in the pathway (such as those of BRAF and RAS), activation
  of receptor tyrosine kinases due to mutations (such as those of RET), overactivation
  of these kinases by growth factors, and fusion receptor tyrosine kinases (such as
  RET and NTRK fusions). Shown are several drugs capable of targeting upstream receptor
  tyrosine kinases, specific mutations, and genetic rearrangements that are either
  FDA approved for thyroid cancer or of interest in treating this disease. Furthermore,
  constitutively activated MEK (due to BRAF V600E or RAS mutations) leads to decreased
  expression of thyroid-specific genes, particularly NIS, resulting in RAI refractoriness.
  Inhibition of BRAF or MEK reverses this effect and restores RAI avidity. Furthermore,
  complex interplay between the immune system and cancer cells exists, including inhibitory
  and stimulatory interactions. Expression of inhibitory ligands such as programmed
  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells effectively turns off the T cells, leading
  to evasion of the immune response. Blockade of such signals with checkpoint inhibitor
  drugs is depicted in the figure. Several immunotherapeutic drugs are approved for
  several solid tumors but not thyroid cancer. CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated
  protein 4; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; NIS, sodium iodide symporter; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1; PI3K,
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TCR, T-cell receptor.
