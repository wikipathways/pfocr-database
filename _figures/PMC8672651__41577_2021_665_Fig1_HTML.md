caption: Schematic summary of the currently known contributions of complement to COVID-19.
  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) triggers direct or
  indirect activation of extracellular and/or intracellular complement pathways. SARS-CoV-2
  envelope proteins activate the lectin pathway through binding to mannose-binding
  lectin (MBL) or the classical pathway through SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and
  C1q. Competition of SARS-CoV-2 with C3b-regulatory factor H (FH) for binding to
  heparan sulfate removes the inhibitory effects of factor H on C3, sustaining activation
  of the alternative pathway. Infection-induced type I interferon receptor (IFNAR)
  signalling through the Janus kinase (JAK)–signalling transducer and activator of
  transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway in type II pneumocytes induces production of intracellular
  complement factor B (FB) and C3, which seed an intracellular C3 convertase and cleavage-mediated
  activation of intracellular C3. Type II pneumocyte-generated C3 activation fragments
  engage cognate receptors (C3a–C3aR and C3b–CD46) on immune cells in the vicinity
  and induce their (hyper)activation. SARS-CoV-2-induced complement activation in
  the capillaries increases C5a generation. C5a potentiates activation of leukocytes
  and neutrophils, their adhesion to endothelial cells, their production of proinflammatory
  cytokines and/or the formation of local neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). SARS-CoV-2-primed
  endothelial cells upregulate C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) expression and become vulnerable
  to pathological C5a activation and insertion of the membrane attack complex (MAC),
  which cumulatively cause endothelial cell death and loss of thromboresistance. Simultaneously,
  complement induces platelet activation (mostly via action of the MAC) and activation
  of the coagulation cascade (mostly via action of MBL-associated serine protease
  1 (MASP1) or MASP2), supporting detrimental thrombus formation. Current pharmacological
  interventions with specific complement targets are depicted. These include antivirals
  and JAK or STAT inhibitors, which reduce infection-induced extracellular and intracellular
  complement activation, and drugs that block MASP1 or MASP2 activity and classical
  pathway and C5 activation. Several therapeutics aim at inhibiting C3 and C5 activation
  fragments, and one inhibitory antibody blocks C5aR1 stimulation. ACE2, angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; RELA, nuclear factor-κB p65 subunit.
