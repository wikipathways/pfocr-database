caption: 'Photosynthesis in non-leaf tissues in outer and inner parts of the organ,
  proposed by Henry et al. [102]. Key reactions in inner tissues (without light) to
  capture respired carbon: PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase.
  Reactions in outer tissues (with light): ME, malic enzyme; RuBisCO, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
  carboxylase/oxygenase; PPDK, Pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase. Adapted from Henry
  et al. [102]. Reproduced with permission from Robert Henry, Pathways of Photosynthesis
