caption: Mediation of the maturation and activation of BMDCs during Mycobacterium
  bovis infection by the cGAS pathway. Mycobacterium bovis regulated the maturation
  and activation of BMDCs via the cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3-dependent pathway and promoted
  type I IFN production. Furthermore, type I IFN and its receptor IFNAR contributed
  to this process. Moreover, the mature and activated BMDCs enhanced the proliferation
  of T cells by some surface markers and cytokines. These signaling pathways linked
  the innate and adaptive immune responses. (The full line arrows signify promotion;
  the dotted arrows signify releasing cytokines.)
