caption: Schematic representation of the relationship between hyperglycemia, iAng
  II, and pathological effects. In hyperglycemia, there is an increase in glucose
  oxidation through the tricarboxylic acid cycle in mitochondria, which results in
  enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species. Overproduction of superoxide inhibits
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, resulting in an accumulation
  of upstream metabolites of the glycolytic pathway. Increased levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (GAD-3P) cause activation of PKC isoforms through diacylglycerol (DAG) production
  and synthesis of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). There is increased shuttling
  of glucose through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, resulting in the modification
  of transcription factors through o-glycosylation. All of these products of hyperglycemia,
  i.e., oxidative stress, AGEs, PKC, and o-glycosylation of transcription factors,
  activate expression of RAS components. Cardiac myocytes synthesize and retain Ang
  II intracellularly in hyperglycemia, whereas cardiac fibroblasts increase both intra-
  and extracellular Ang II. iAng II could directly increase oxidative stress and cellular
  apoptosis through unidentified mechanisms and/or could enhance expression of RAS
  components through a positive feedback mechanism, resulting in enhanced extracellular
  Ang II levels as well, particularly via cardiac fibroblasts. Extracellular Ang II
  in turn causes oxidative stress, cardiac myocyte apoptosis, and cardiac fibrosis
  through the AT1 receptor. Interrupting this cycle by blocking Ang II synthesis provides
  protection from hyperglycemia-induced pathological events. ACE inhibitors or ARBs
  would block only the extracellular synthesis or actions, respectively, of Ang II;
  whereas a renin inhibitor would block both intra- and extracellular Ang II synthesis,
  the latter providing an explanation for the more pronounced effects of aliskiren
  observed in this study.
