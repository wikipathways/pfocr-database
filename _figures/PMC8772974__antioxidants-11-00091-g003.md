caption: The mechanism of ROS involved in pro-inflammatory Kupffer cells. Fatty acid
  intake increases lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, whereas oxidative stress involves
  the release of mtDNA from damaged hepatocytes. KCs activated by mtDNA promotes the
  secretion of pro-inflammatory factors through the cGAS/STING axis and is dependent
  on the NF-kB pathway. LPS-mediated inflammation through activation of MAPK and NF-kB
  pathways. Meanwhile, LPS activates TLR4 to promote NOX2 production of ROS. Large
  amounts of ROS increase MAPK and NF-kB transcription and promote production of inflammatory
  cytokines as well as (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, etc.). Mitochondria are the main organelle
  for ROS production, and UCP2 localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane increase
  proton transfer to downregulate mitochondrial membrane potential to control ROS
  levels. NRF2 regulate negatively ROS by increasing the production of antioxidant
  factors.
