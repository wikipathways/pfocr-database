caption: Model of PSY1 and RaxX signaling pathways. RaxX, a pathogenic molecule closely
  mimicking PSY1, is recognized by the immune receptor XA21, but only when carrying
  its C-terminal domain. XA21 does not bind PSY1. The PSY1 signaling pathway involves
  the PSY1 receptor (PSY1R) which induces hypocotyl and root elongation, immune response
  and H+-efflux by activating the plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase. PSY1 and RaxX induce
  root elongation using a signaling pathway not including PSY1R, suggesting an additional
  receptor recognizing the conserved PSY domain present in all PSY homologs as well
  as RaxX.
