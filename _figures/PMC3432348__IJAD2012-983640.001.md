caption: Pathways activating and inhibiting complement. The three complement activation
  pathways converge at the formation of the enzyme C3 convertase (or C4b/C2a), activation
  of which leads to the formation of C3b, the ligand of complement receptor 1 (CR1,
  also known as CD35). Activation of the complement pathway can ultimately lead to
  the release of inflammatory mediators, opsonisation of pathogens, and the membrane
  attack complex (MAC). The C1 complex of the classical complement pathway is comprised
  of C1q, C1r, and C1s. The endogenous complement C1 inhibitor/C1-esterase inhibitor
  (C1-Inh), which regulates the activation of the C1 complex, is decreased in AD.
  C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9 form the MAC complex in the alternative complement activation
  pathway. CD59, an endogenous regulator of the MAC complex, is decreased in AD whilst
  C9 may be increased. Levels of Factor H, a regulatory glycoprotein of the alternative
  complement cascade, may also be perturbed in AD.
