caption: General model for the production and utilization of activated Ste20. Based
  on results in this study, the model proposes that GTP-bound Cdc42 (presumably activated
  by its exchange factor, Cdc24) converts Ste20 to an active form (asterisk) by antagonizing
  the autoinhibitory influence of CRIB domain sequences in the Ste20 N terminus. As
  discussed in the text, this conversion is required for pheromone-dependent signaling,
  but there is no evidence that mating pheromones stimulate this conversion, and instead
  Cdc42-activated Ste20 is competent to signal even without prior exposure to pheromone.
  Therefore, pheromone-mediated activation of the Gβγ complex may promote signaling
  through the mating pathway by an existing pool of activated Ste20 kinase. The lifetime
  of activated Ste20 is unknown, as is the degree to which Ste20 activity requires
  continual interaction with Cdc42; evidence from other systems suggests that PAK
  autophosphorylation stabilizes the open conformation, allowing kinase activity to
  persist after dissociation of the GTPase (, ). The pathway leading to filamentous
  growth also requires activation of Ste20 by Cdc42. The question mark implies that
  while nutritional cues can trigger filamentous growth, they do not necessarily stimulate
  the Ste20-dependent filamentation MAP kinase cascade, as discussed previously ();
  instead, nutritional cues may primarily modulate a separate (protein kinase A) pathway
  that is required in parallel for filamentous growth (, ). Dashed-line arrows denote
  that Ste20 also functions in other cellular processes (e.g., regulation of actin,
  cell polarity, and osmoregulatory signaling); these likely also depend on activation
  by Cdc42, but little is known about Ste20 regulation during these events.
