caption: JAK kinases are associated with and mediate signaling via EPO and MPL receptors.
  Mutated JAK2 and CALR activate cell proliferation via the JAK-STAT and RAS-RAF-MAPK
  pathways leading to proliferation of hematopoietic cells. JAK-STAT pathway activation
  can be inhibited by the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib at the level of the EPO and
  MPL receptor. IFNs have been associated with a variety of mechanisms of action which
  are not fully elucidated to date. IFN has been associated with immunomodulatory
  effects, stimulation of HSC differentiation and apoptosis. Epigenetic processes
  such as DNA methylation and histone (de)acetylation can be targeted by HDAC inhibitors
  (e.g. vorinostat and givinostat), the LSD1 inhibitor IMG-7289, and hypomethylating
  agents. Navitoclax inhibits anti-apoptotic signaling via BCL-2 and has been successfully
  tested in myelofibrosis patients but not ET or PV.
