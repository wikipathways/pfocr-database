caption: Hippo/YAP signaling pathway maintains the balance between cell proliferation
  and apoptosis. YAP is a key factor downstream of the signaling pathway. Under physiological
  conditions, YAP is phosphorylated through a series of kinase cascades and is located
  in the cytoplasm. When MST1/2, hSAV1, MOB1 and LATS1/2 are inactivated or YAP is
  overexpressed, YAP is translocated into the nucleus and binds to TEAD. This in turn
  promotes the expression of a number of factors (cyclin E, CIAP1 and CTGF). This
  also promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. CIAP1, cellular inhibitor
  of apoptosis protein 1; CREB, cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding
  protein; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; hSAV1, human salvador 1; LATS1/2,
  large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2; MOB1, mps 1 binder kinase activator-like 1; MST1/2,
  mammalian STE20-like kinase 1/2; se, serine; TEAD, TEA domain family member; YAP,
  yes-associated protein.
