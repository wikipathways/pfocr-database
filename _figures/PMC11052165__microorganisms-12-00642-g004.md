caption: Curcumin inhibits oxidative stress and ameliorates inflammatory pathways.
  CUR can promote the disassembly of the Nrf2-Keap1 complex and activate the expression
  of Nrf2/ARE transcripts to exert its antioxidant effect. CUR also regulates inflammatory
  factors through the upregulation of PPARγ, which indirectly inhibits NF-κB expression.
  However, CUR was able to inhibit NF-κB transcription directly with TLR4 receptor
  mediated inhibition, and TLR4 directly regulated the MAPK signaling pathway to inhibit
  the release of pro-inflammatory factors, which ultimately achieved the purpose of
  alleviating inflammation
