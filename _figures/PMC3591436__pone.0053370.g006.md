caption: The activation of IκB-α and NF-κB could upregulate MMP-9 production in A.
  cantonensis-induced leukocytes. Blocking IκB-α and NF-κB signaling by MG132 could
  reduce MMP-9 production. Further, blocking MMP-9 activity by GM6001 could reduce
  claudin-5 degradation and blood-CSF barrier permeability during angiostrongyliasis
  meningoencephalitis. Therefore, we suggest that MMP-9 could cause claudin-5 degradation
  and promote leukocyte infiltration into CSF by the paracellular route during A.
  cantonensis infection in mouse choroid plexus.
