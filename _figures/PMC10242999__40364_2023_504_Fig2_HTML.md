  condition for these molecules. This complex formation is independent of TF-FVIIa
  potency for cleaving PAR. B Ephs: TF-FVIIa binary complex can cleave both Eph B
  2/ A 2 proteolytically; then, signal transduction is induced by ephrins. C JAK-STAT
  Proteolytic activity of FVIIa causes initiating of apoptosis-related signaling events
  such as activation of PI3K, Akt, by STAT5 phosphorylation. D 1-Function of the MAP
  Kinase and PI3K-PKB pathways due to the TF-FVIIa interaction through activating
  specific transcription factors in the nucleus leads to the gene expression and translation

  that consists SRC-like family, PI3K, PKB, and Rac stimulation conducts cytoskeletal
  rearrangement'
