caption: Two-step model for innate immune system activation in MPS diseases. The lack
  of lysosomal enzyme activity associated with MPS leads to the accumulation of highly
  sulphated GAG that could either be exocytosed and bind to TLR4 or released intracellularly
  due to lysosomal disruption. Secondary storage substrates released from cells may
  also activate TLR4—GM2 ganglioside for example. TLR4 signalling culminates in the
  activation of the NF-Kb pathway, which promotes pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 transcription
  (Priming step), as well as transcriptional induction of other pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  Many of the pathological events associated with disease progression, such as defective
  autophagy, lysosomal leakage and cathepsin release, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive
  oxygen species, and changes in potassium permeability, can further boost inflammation
  by triggering the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation (Activation step).
  This eventually leads to secretion of mature IL-1β via caspase-1 cleavage which,
  together with the other pro-inflammatory cytokines, causes multiple downstream events,
  such as microglia and astrocyte activation and neuronal degeneration, including
  pyroptosis.
