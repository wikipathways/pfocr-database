caption: COPD creates a favourable microenvironment for lung cancer initiation and
  progression. During COPD the p38 MAPK pathway is activated. P38 MAPK activates MK2,
  subsequently mediating the phosphorylation and thereby the inactivation of TTP.
  Therefore, TTP is unable to degrade the mRNA of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF,
  IL-6, IL-8), metalloproteinases 9 and 12 (MMP9 and MMP12), and cathepsin S (CTSS).
  Simultaneously endogenous inhibitors CIP2A and SET are upregulated and inhibit PP2A
  activity, reducing the dephosphorylation and thus activation of TTP. Cytokine secretion
  results in the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes. All of the above collectively
  create a sustained chronic inflammatory environment, which feeds further secretion
  of MMP9, MMP12 and CTSS to promote proteolysis. These factors degrade the ECM in
  the lung parenchyma leading to subsequent airspace enlargement and rbm fragmentation.
  The expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin is decreased, whilst the expression
  of mesenchymal markers vimentin and S100A4 is increased, in conjunction with increased
  VEGF secretion. Chronic inflammation and high proteolytic activity collectively
  create an ideal niche for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting
  the oncogenic transformation of resident cells of the lung, and encouraging LC initiation
  and progression
