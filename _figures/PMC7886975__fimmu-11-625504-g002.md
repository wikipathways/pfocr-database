caption: Crosstalk between ZDBD-containing proteins, stress granules, and innate immunity
  signaling pathway following RNA virus infection. 1) Innate immune sensors like MDA5
  and PKR are activated upon recognition of virus RNA in the cytoplasm, which in turn
  activates the NF-κB pathway culminating in expression of type I IFN. 2) At the same
  time, activated PKR also phosphorylates eIF2α, causing stalled mRNA translation
  that induce the formation of stress granules. Stress granules are instrumental in
  promoting cell survival under cellular stresses like virus infection. 3) Most ZDBD-containing
  proteins have been shown to localize to stress granules, mediated via respective
  Zα domains. Therefore, it is possible that RNA can adopt Z-conformation more readily
  within stress granules. 4) ADAR1p150 is a negative regulator of immune response
  protecting against autoimmunity and chronic inflammation, as edited RNA transcripts
  lose immunogenicity. On the other hand, ZBP1 activation triggers IFN response and
  cell death mechanism. The vaccinia virus E3L is an inhibitory protein towards the
  antiviral response of its mammalian host, which is dependent of its Zα domain. In
  fish, PKZ is a paralog that complements PKR-mediated pathways, as PKZ can be activated
  by Z-RNA binding. The cyprinid herpesvirus ORF112 protein antagonizes the activation
  of PKZ as the virus immune evasion strategy. Incidentally, PKR and MDA5 had also
  been reported to localize to stress granules. It is therefore plausible that the
  close proximity through localization to stress granules facilitate the crosstalk
  between ZDBD-containing proteins and immune recognition and signaling pathways.
