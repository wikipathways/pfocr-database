caption: (Top pathway) Scr, Exd and Hth work together to specify the SG fate in parasegment
  2 (PS2) by activating expression of several early-expressed genes, including the
  transcription factors Hkb, Sage, Fkh and CrebA. SG formation is limited to a subset
  of cells within PS2 by dorsal Dpp signaling. The ventral ectodermal cells of PS2
  are specified as salivary duct through ventral EGF-signaling. Although global expression
  of Scr can drive formation of ectopic SGs in more anterior parasegments (PS0, PS1),
  it fails to induce SG fates in more posterior segments because of the activities
  of the trunk gene Tsh (PS3-13) and Hox gene Abd-B (PS14). (Bottom pathway) Whereas
  Hkb is only transiently expressed in the SG, Sage, Fkh and CrebA continue to be
  expressed in the SGs where they function to maintain and implement the earlier decision
  to form SGs. Fkh has many roles in the SG, including maintaining its own expression
  and that of Sage and CrebA. Fkh also controls invagination and is required for polytenization.
  Fkh keeps SG cells alive and works with Sage to control expression of genes required
  to maintain an open patent SG lumen. CrebA functions to increase secretory capacity
  by upregulating expression of the protein components of secretory machinery.
