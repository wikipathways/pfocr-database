caption: Overview of the autophagy pathway and potential targets for pharmacological
  modulation. Different extracellular signals such as amino acids, growth factors
  and insulin, activate mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) via PI3K
  and Akt1 signaling, thereby inhibiting autophagy. However, upon deprivation of nutrients
  and growth factors, AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) is activated. AMPK inhibits
  mTORC1, which results in the activation of ULK complex. Interestingly, its activation
  can also occur independently from mTORC1. ULK complex, in turn, activates class
  III PI3K via phosphorylation of beclin 1. Subsequently, class III PI3K generates
  phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates (PI3P), which are essential for the synthesis
  of the phagophore membrane. Further membrane elongation involves two ubiquitin-like
  conjugation systems. In the first system, ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 via a reaction
  that involves ATG7 and ATG10. Subsequently, ATG12-ATG5 complex binds to ATG16L.
  ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L associates with the phagophore. The second system involves the
  conjugation of LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). First, pro-LC3 is processed
  by Atg4B, which results in cytosolic LC3-I. ATG7 then adds phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) to LC3-I to form LC3-II, which associates with the phagophore membrane. Misfolded
  proteins and aggregates are tagged with ubiquitin chains, which are a substrate
  for p62. Protein – p62 complexes aggregate and migrate to the autophagosomal membrane,
  where p62 interacts with LC3. After the formation of the autophagosome, the outer
  membrane of the phagosome fuses with a lysosome, thereby forming an autolysosome.
  Finally, the internal material is degraded by lysosomal enzymes and nutrients and
  metabolites are recycled. Efflux of cholesterol via ABCA1 transporters is promoted
  by autophagy. Interestingly, autophagy can be regulated at the transcriptional level.
  mTORC1 inactivation results in nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB
  (TFEB). Once in the nucleus, TFEB triggers the transcription of autophagy and lysosomal
  genes. Moreover, oxidant stress can trigger autophagy by disrupting the interaction
  between nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2) and Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1 (Keap1). Nrf2 then translocates to the nucleus where it upregulates the
  transcription of different autophagy-related genes including p62. Additionally,
  calcium homeostasis plays a role in the autophagy pathway. ER stress causes calcium
  release, which activates proteases such as death-associated protein kinase (DAPK)
  and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ). The latter induces
  autophagy via inhibition of mTORC1 in an AMPK-dependent manner. DAPK induces autophagy
  by phosphorylating beclin 1 and thereby activating class III PI3K. Autophagy can
  be stimulated pharmacologically by targeting AMPK using metformin and resveratrol.
  Rapamycin (or analogs) induce autophagy via mTORC1 inhibition. Induction of transcription
  of lysosomal and autophagy genes by targeting Nrf2 and TFEB with tert-butylhydroquinone
  (tBHQ) and trehalose, respectively, is an alternative approach for autophagy induction.
  Autophagy can be inhibited by targeting class III PI3K with wortmannin and 3-methyladenine.
  Alternatively, the autophagic process can be blocked by targeting lysosomes with
  bafilomycin and chloroquine.
