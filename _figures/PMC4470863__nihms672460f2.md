caption: Commitment and maintenance of gonadal cell fate. In XX and XY gonads at the
  bipotential stage, supporting cell precursors are exposed to male and female promoting
  signals that antagonize each other. In the XY gonad, expression of Sry triggers
  up-regulation of Sox9 and Fgf9, which activate the male pathway and repress signals
  that promote the female pathway (WNT4/RSPO1 and β-catenin). Supporting cell precursors
  commit to Sertoli cell fate and orchestrate testis development by promoting Leydig
  cell differentiation from steroidogenic progenitors, and regulating mitotic arrest
  in germ cells. In the XX gonad, in the absence of Sry to initiate the male pathway,
  Wnt4 and Rspo1 maintain β-catenin signaling to promote the female pathway. Supporting
  cell precursors commit to granulosa cell fate and orchestrate ovary development
  by promoting Theca cell differentiation from steroidogenic progenitors, and regulating
  meiotic entry in germ cells. Reinforcing signals (dotted lines) exist between somatic
  and germ cells in the developing testis and ovary. In the adult testis, Dmrt1 is
  required for maintaining Sertoli cell fate by repressing female promoting signals,
  while in the adult ovary, abolishing female promoting signals leads to loss of granulosa
  cell fate and up-regulation of Sox9 and other markers of Sertoli fate.
