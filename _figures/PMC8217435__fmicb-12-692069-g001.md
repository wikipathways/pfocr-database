caption: Schematic of the IFN response to dsRNA viruses. (A) dsRNA motifs can be recognized
  by retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) like receptors (RLRs) (RIG-I and MDA-5)
  in the cytoplasm or Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 in the endosomes that trigger IFN
  and proinflammatory cytokine production. Activated RLR are recruited to mitochondrial
  antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, which in turn recruit tumor necrosis factor
  receptor-associated factors (TRAF). TLR3 signals through its adaptor protein Toll/IL-1R
  domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) to activate TRAFs. TRAFs promote
  the activation of the TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) complex [composed of TBK1, IκB
  kinase ε (IKKε) and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)] leading to TBK1 activation
  that mediates phosphorylation and homodimerization of the IFN regulatory factors
  (IRF) 3/7. Activated IRF3/7 dimers translocate to the nucleus to trigger IFN gene
  transcription. TRAF activation also promote the activation of the IKK complex (composed
  of IKKα and β, and NEMO) that activates NF-κB and the transcription of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. (B) IFNs signals through their heterodimeric surface receptors (IFNAR1
  and 2 for α-IFN; IFNLR 1 and 2 for λ-IFN; and IFNGR 1 and 2 for γ-IFN) that lead
  to activation of intracellular Janus Kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (STAT) pathways and to the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes
  (ISGs). Binding of α-IFN to its receptor activates the JAK kinases JAK1 and TYK2,
  which in turn leads to the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. Phosphorylated STAT1
  and STAT2 dimerizes and binds to IRF9 to form the transcriptional factor complex
  IFN stimulated gene factor (ISGF) 3 that translocates to the nucleus to bind the
  IFN-response elements (ISRE) in ISG promoters and drive the expression of ISG products,
  such as protein kinase R (PKR) or interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide
  repeats (IFIT) 1. λ-IFN signaling follows this same canonical pathway as α-IFN signaling.
  γ-IFN signals through its receptor by activating the JAK kinases JAK1 and JAK2 that
  leads to STAT1 phosphorylation and homodimerization into the transcription factor
  termed the gamma interferon-activated factor (GAF). GAF then binds gamma interferon-activated
  site (GAS) to drive the transcription of ISGs dependent on γ-IFN.
