caption: eIF4E mediates export of a subset of mRNAs, which contain the 4E-SE RNA element
  that is recognized by LRPPRC bound to eIF4E. LRPPRC contains an NES that interacts
  with Crm1-RanGTP, which translocates the mRNP to the cytoplasm. Among the 4E-SE
  mRNAs, there are important proliferation factors. In many cancer cells, eIF4E and
  Crm1 levels are elevated resulting in abnormal increase in nuclear export of various
  mRNAs, including the ones that regulate cell proliferation, which promotes their
  translation in the cytoplasm. eIF4E up-regulation leads to Nup358 degradation and
  increased levels of Dbp5, Gle1 and RanBP1. The crosstalk between the bulk mRNA export
  machinery and the eIF4E mRNA export pathway will be interesting to investigate.
