caption: Signaling pathway of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 1 and
  NOD2. d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) of Gram-negative bacteria and
  muramyl dipeptide (MDP) of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are recognized
  by NOD1 and NOD2, respectively. After activation of NODs, RICK is recruited through
  CARD-CARD interactions, leading to the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways.
