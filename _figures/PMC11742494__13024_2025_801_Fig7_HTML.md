caption: CHI3L1’s role in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease through modulation
  of neuroinflammation. As chronic inflammation progresses, astrocytes and microglia
  release proinflammatory mediators, including CHI3L1, cytokines, and chemokines.
  CHI3L1 regulates IL-6 levels, which in turn elevates IL-1β and TNF-α levels, disrupting
  the BBB and initiating neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to neuronal death.
  IL-6 activation stimulates astrocytes, with reactive astrocytes (marked by increased
  GFAP) promoting amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation and Tau phosphorylation. Through STAT3
  activation, CHI3L1 promotes APP expression in neurons, further driving Aβ aggregation
  and cognitive decline. Additionally, CHI3L1 induces microglial activation by regulating
  IL-6, resulting in the production of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, which exacerbates neuroinflammation
  and disrupts neurotransmitter signaling. CHI3L1 also activates the MAPK and NF-κB
  pathways, contributing to Aβ accumulation and neuronal inflammation via RAGE activation
  in both astrocytes and neurons
