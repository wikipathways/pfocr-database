caption: The Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway. Under basal conditions transcription factor Nrf2
  is bound to a cytoplasmic repressor Keap1, which targets Nrf2 for ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation via association with the Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin
  ligase complex. Small molecule inducers modify highly reactive (sensor) cysteine
  residues of Keap1, which loses its ability to target Nrf2 for degradation. This
  results in stabilization of Nrf2, binding to the ARE (in heterodimeric combinations
  with a small Maf transcription factor), and activation of the transcription of cytoprotective
  (phase 2) genes. ARE, antioxidant response element; Keap1, Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1; Nrf2, nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2.
