caption: A schematic diagram of ROS signal transduction induced by salt stress. When
  plant cells are exposed to salt stress, they generate a significant amount of ROS,
  which can lead to oxidative damage. To mitigate this damage, plant cells maintain
  ROS homeostasis through various signal transduction pathways activated by salt stress.
  Under normal conditions, ROS, such as H2O2, are typically produced by chloroplasts,
  mitochondria and peroxisomes. Additionally, H2O2 can be generated from extracellular
  oxygen through the action of RBOH and SOD under salt stress conditions. The produced
  H2O2 is subsequently transported into the cell or detected by ROS receptors on the
  cell membrane, which activates the MAPK signaling pathway to help maintain intracellular
  ROS homeostasis. Excessive H2O2 in the cytoplasm is recognized by ROS sensors, triggering
  downstream signal transduction pathways. For instance, H2O2 interacts with the ROS
  sensor Hsf to form a homotrimer that translocates to the nucleus, where it activates
  the expression of genes associated with oxidative stress. Furthermore, ROS can also
  be detected by other ROS sensors, such as p46-MAPK, to facilitate the plant response
  to salt stress. Additionally, ROS signaling can interact with other signaling pathways,
  highlighting the complexity of stress responses in plants. For example, ROS generated
  by RBOHD stimulate the opening of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, leading
  to an influx of calcium ions, which generates Ca2+ signals. Subsequently, this influx
  activates TPC1 on the vacuolar membrane, allowing Ca2+ from the vacuole to enter
  the cytoplasm, which further activates RBOHD. This cycle can create a ROS/Ca²⁺ wave,
  thereby enhancing the salt tolerance of plants. RBOH, respiratory burst oxidase
