caption: Diagram illustrating the IL-6 signaling pathway triggered by the binding
  of IL-6 and its receptor complex resulting in JAK2/STAT3 activation. This leads
  to promotion of the production of the effectors of phagolysosome maturation-trafficking
  regulators and lysosomal enzymes, as well as proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory
  cytokines, in the regulation of SOCS3. This event clears the B. abortus infection
  in macrophages. Lines with arrows indicate an activating reaction, and dotted lines
  indicate an uncertain reaction.
