caption: Significant molecular network of combination therapy related metabolites.
  Metabolites are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two
  nodes is represented as a line. Note that the colored symbols represent metabolites
  that occur in our data, while the transparent entries are molecules from the Ingenuity
  Knowledge Database. Red symbols represent up-regulated metabolites in HFMD patients
  after combination therapy; green symbols represent down-regulated metabolites in
  HFMD patients after combination therapy. Solid lines between molecules indicate
  direct physical relationship between molecules; dotted lines indicate indirect functional
  relationships. The yellow dashed area denotes the related pathway.
