caption: Dual-pathway model for regulation of LR growth and development by NO3−. Because
  the ANR1 gene is rapidly induced by NO3− (), the putative NO3− receptor and the
  mechanism for transcriptional activation of ANR1 are likely to be shared with other
  NO3−-inducible genes such as the NIA1 genes encoding NR (, ). We have tentatively
  placed ANR1 upstream of AXR4 in the signal transduction pathway. This arrangement
  makes a number of predictions that can be tested experimentally by using axr4 mutants
  () and ANR1 antisense lines (). Other genes implicated in controlling particular
  stages in LR initiation or development () are shown on the right. Broken arrows
  indicate signaling steps, solid arrows indicate transport or metabolic steps, and
  large open arrows indicate developmental steps.
