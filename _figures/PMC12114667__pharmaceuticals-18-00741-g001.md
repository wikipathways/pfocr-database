caption: Schematic representation of CK1ε’s role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  Proteins are represented as ellipses, with CK1ε highlighted by a distinct shape.
  Target genes are represented as green rectangles. ATP and a competitive inhibitor
  are shown as yellow and red circles, respectively. Solid arrows indicate downstream
  signaling effects. Dashed arrows represent cellular outcomes resulting from the
  regulation of target genes
