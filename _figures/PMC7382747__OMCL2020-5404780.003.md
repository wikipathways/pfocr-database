caption: The relevant signaling pathway in itaconate-induced anti-inflammatory and
  antioxidative effects. Itaconate is promoted in macrophages activated by stimuli
  like LPS via increasing CAD transcription. Increasing itaconate activates the Nrf2
  pathway via alkylation Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which induces
  the transcription of various Nrf2-dependent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes,
  such as HO-1 and GSH. Itaconate can also inhibit succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and
  reduce ROS generation and, consequently, IL-1β secretion by activation. Itaconate
  promotes the transcription of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which directly
  inhibits IκBζ expression and leads to decreasing IL-6. In addition, itaconate directly
  alkylates the cysteine residue 22 of GAPDH and ALDOA to inhibit glycolysis, thereby
  mitigating the inflammatory response.
