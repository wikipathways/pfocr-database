caption: Mycobacterium tuberculosis and apoptosis modulation. The mycobacteria or
  its virulence factors may modulate apoptosis, both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways
  at different levels, as inductors (red arrows) or inhibitors (black inhibitors).
  (a) Apoptosis may be detonated via TNF and FasL impacting initiator caspases-8 and
  -9 and effector caspases-3 and -7. (b) The intrinsic pathway also may control mycobacteria
  infection at the mitochondria level, cytochrome c released, and apoptosome formation
  by activating caspases-9 and -3. (c) TNF death signal may be blocked at DISC formation
  and caspase-8 activation. (d) The proapoptotic protein BAX may be down-regulated
  with the H37Ra strain. (e) Mycobacteria may stabilize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2.
  (f) Up-regulation at the gene level of FasL and caspases may be done during mycobacteria
  infection; (g) down-regulation of IL-12 expression and TNF has also been reported
