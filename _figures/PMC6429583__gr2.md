caption: Homology of the GSH synthesis pathways in mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans.
  In mammals, the de novo synthesis pathway is comprised of the glutamate cysteine
  ligase catalytic (GCLC) and modifier subunits (GCLM), and glutathione synthetase
  (GS); with glutathione reductase (GR) involved in recycling intracellular GSSG to
  GSH. In worms, the respective orthologs are designated as glutamate cysteine synthetase
  heavy (GCS-1) and light (E01A2.1) subunits, glutathione synthetase (GSS-1) and glutathione
  reductase (GSR-1). Genes of the de novo (gcs-1, E01A2.1 and gss-1) and recycling
  pathway (gsr-1) are transcriptionally upregulated by the SKN-1 (Nrf2 ortholog) under
  constitutive and stress-induced conditions.
