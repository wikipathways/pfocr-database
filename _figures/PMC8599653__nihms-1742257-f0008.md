caption: Schematic summary of the proposed mechanism of EphA2-regulated fibronectin
  deposition. 1) EphA2 within the focal adhesion undergoes ligand-independent phosphorylation
  on Y772 by focal adhesion kinase (FAK). EphA2 expression limits FAK activity, suggesting
  a novel reciprocal relationship between FAK and EphA2 signaling in the focal adhesion.
  2) Elevated EphA2 signaling and reduced FAK signaling are associated with reduced
  phosphorylation and activation of p190RhoGAP. 3) Elevated RhoA activity due to inactive
  p190RhoGAP mediates myosin light chain phosphorylation and cellular contractility.
  4) RhoA-driven contractility supports the recruitment of α5β1 integrins into tensin-rich
  fibrillar adhesions that drive 5) fibronectin deposition.
