caption: Schematic representation of chitinase 3-like 1-associated β-catenin activation
  signaling pathway, which is inhibited by methylxanthine derivatives. Binding of
  extracellular chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) to a putative receptor on plasma membrane
  activates the intracellular phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase
  B (AKT) signaling pathway, which leads to β-catenin activation by translocating
  this protein from cytoplasm into nucleus. Methylxanthine derivatives, including
  caffeine, pentoxifylline and theophylline, directly down-regulate CHI3L1 mRNA expression
  and inhibit CHI3L1 protein functions, leading to reduced CHI3L1-associated AKT activation
  and prevent down-stream β-catenin nuclear translocation with different degrees of
  efficacy.
