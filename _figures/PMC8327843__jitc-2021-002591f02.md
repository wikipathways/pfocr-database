caption: 'Mechanisms leading to Treg infiltration and adaptation in the inflamed TME.
  Inflammation-associated infiltration: chemokine and cytokine dependent recruitment.
  Tregs possess multiple chemokine receptors. Chemokine gradients such as CCR4-CCL17/22,
  CCR8-CCL1, CCR5-CCL5, and CCR10-CCL28 are involved in recruiting Tregs into the
  TME. Hyperactivation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is correlated with Treg infiltration
  and CD8+ T cell exclusion via regulation of the production of chemokines such as
  CCL5 by tumor cells. Tumor hypoxia induces the expression of CCL28 and promotes
  the recruitment of Tregs via CCR10. activated CD8+ T cells also produce CCL17/22
  that recruit Tregs. On the other hand, chemokine gradients such as CXCR3-CXCL9/10/11
  are involved in CD8+ T cell recruitment. Metabolic adaptation. Effector T cells
  and Tregs employ different metabolic system in normal versus inflammatory conditions.
  TCR stimulation provokes a specific metabolic program through the PI3K-mTOR signaling
  pathway, leading to increased uptake of glucose through glucose transporter (GLUT)
  to enhance aerobic glycolysis. Activated effector T cells shift their metabolic
  program from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis. Metabolic
  reprogramming in tumor cells changes the TME into a nutrient-restricted, lactate-rich,
  and hypoxic environment, which is unfavorable for the survival and function of effector
  T cells. FOXP3 plays an essential role in this distinct metabolic program of Tregs
  by suppressing glycolysis, promoting OXPHOS, and enabling the use of lactate through
  monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) as an energy source. While tumor-infiltrating
  non-Tregs convert pyruvate to lactate to maintain glycolysis, Tregs in the TME convert
  pyruvate to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria to trigger the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, which provides a survival benefit to Tregs over effector T cells in the low-glucose,
  high-extracellular lactate TME. mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; TME, tumor microenvironment; Tregs, regulatory T cells.'
