caption: Gut microbiota modulates inflammation and immune mechanism of hyperglycemia-induced
  DR. Gut microbiota dysbiosis under hyperglycemia with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) causes
  bacterial translocation and gram-negative bacteria increase allowing accumulated
  production of LPS into blood circulation. Elevated LPS level activates NF-κB through
  TLR-4-MyD88, increases the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α, and also can deregulate
  the innate and adaptive immune response. Increased Hp can induce the expression
  of IL-6 and TNF-α, and IL-6 can cause damage to vascular endothelial cells. The
  increasing abundance of E. coli in the microbiome of patients with T2DM will lead
  to the generation of oxygen free radicals, causing neuronal cell apoptosis and extensive
  damage to retinal endothelial cells, and promote the development of DR. Gut microbiota
  associates with the serum levels of TMAO, which promotes vascular inflammation by
  activating inflammasome, NLRP3, through reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling
  pathway. Further, the NLRP3 inflammasome modulates the structure and function of
  BRB to induce damage of retina. Patients with T2DM commonly have a moderate degree
  of gut microbial dysbiosis, the abundance of some bacteria that produce butyrate
  reduction, and impact the levels of SCFA. SCFA production by colonic fermentation,
  which binds to the GPR43, regulates inflammation and GLP-1 secretion, and further
  influences the development of DR.
