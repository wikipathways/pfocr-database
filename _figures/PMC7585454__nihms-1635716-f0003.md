caption: Cardiac myocyte regulation by PDE5A and PDE9A. Both enzymes are highly selective
  for cGMP; PDE5A hydrolyzes principally GC-1α (NO-coupled) and PDE9A GC-A (NP coupled)
  derived cGMP. PDE5A inhibition leads to cGK1α that in turn phosphorylates sarcomeric
  proteins to enhance myocardial compliance and counter adrenergic stimulated contractility,
  proteasome activity, reduce hypertrophic-stimulated microRNA (miRNA) changes, RGS2/4
  and TRPC6 to suppress Gq-protein coupled receptors and calcineurin (Cn) signaling,
  and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) to negatively control mechanistic target
  of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and its downstream effects on autophagy and hypertrophic
  growth stimulation. PDE9A shares many of these targets, notably those converging
  on hypertrophic stimuli, though there are differences (e.g. no impact on miRNAs,
  less contractility modulation). cGK1α also confers mitochondrial protection via
  KATP channels. Oxidation of cGK1α by reactive oxygen species (ROS) results in a
  loss of function of the pathway, by oxidative changes in NOS, GC-1α, and cGK1α.
  This results in depressed anti- hypertrophic signaling. Other abbreviations are
  as in other panels.
