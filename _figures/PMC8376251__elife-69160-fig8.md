caption: Schematic summarizes the key findings in this work and places them in the
  context of existing literature. GIV is likely to primarily function during capacitation
  of sperm, during which it fulfills two key roles as a signal transducer in a spatiotemporally
  segregated manner. The first role (right, top) is in the head of the sperm, where
  GIV’s GEM motif inhibits the AC→cAMP pathway and prevents acrosomal reaction. The
  second role (right, bottom) is in the mid-piece and tail region of the sperm, which
  involves tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV, which happens downstream of PKA activation.
  Such phosphorylation is rapidly induced during capacitation. In addition, GIV’s
  GEM motif is activated and is required for the enhancement of PI3K/Akt signals,
  enhanced motility, and survival of sperms during capacitation.
