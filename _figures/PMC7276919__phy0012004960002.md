caption: cGAS/STING pathway, a major cytosolic dsDNA sensing pathway mediating type
  I IFN signalingcGAS is localized close to the plasma membrane. The recognition of
  dsDNA forms a complex with cGAS dimers binding to two dsDNA strands. cGAS-dsDNA
  binding induces a conformational phase transition for the catalytic synthesis of
  cGAMP from ATP and GTP. The human cGAS (hcGAS) has K187 and L195 mutations, which
  necessitate longer dsDNA for activation and cause low levels of cGAMP production
  in response to dsDNA. cGAMP binds to STING and recruits IKKα and TBK1 to activate
  IRF3 for type I IFN production. Additionally, after cGAMP binding, STING interacts
  with LC3 and promotes non-canonical autophagy through an ATG5-dependent mechanism
  after TBK1 degradation to control viral replication.
