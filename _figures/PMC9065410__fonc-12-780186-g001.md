caption: Glycolysis pathways of 18F-FDG and normal glucose and related metabolic pathways
  regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in EGFR-mutated non-small
  cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 18F-FDG is transported into cells by glucose transporters
  (GLUTs) and phosphorylated to 18F-FDG-6-phosphate by hexokinase (HK). It is trapped
  inside cells because 18F-FDG-6-phosphate is not a substrate of glycolysis or pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) and is unable to diffuse outside cells. The metabolites
  of pyruvate and ribose-5-phosphate in the glycolysis decreased significantly after
  treatment of lung adenocarcinoma cells with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
  ().
