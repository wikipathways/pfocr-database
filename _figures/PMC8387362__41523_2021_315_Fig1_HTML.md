caption: (1) all eligible women were selected based on their personal and family history
  of cancer (red and pink women) and (2) received prior clinical screening. (3) unsolved
  cases were selected for WES through normal/tumor pair samples from blood lymphocytes
  and FFPE tissues. (4) sequencing data were analyzed through a germline candidate
  variant detection algorithm focused on homology-directed repair candidates following
  a classical BCSG model. (5) tumor landscapes were evaluated through a variant calling
  pipeline designed to minimize artifacts and a second-hit detection strategy based
  on the biological mechanism (i.e. defects in the hr pathway). (6) candidate BCSGs
  were re-evaluated in the context of a patient harboring a germline variant with
  an HRD tumor and second hit.
