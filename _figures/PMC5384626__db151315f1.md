caption: 'The metabolic pathway of retinoic acid. A: Gene ontology analysis of RNA-seq
  data from SC and VS adipose tissue identified retinol metabolism as the second most
  significant biological pathway that is differentially expressed between these two
  depots; this is defined by P value <0.05 after Bonferroni correction. ECM, extracellular
  matrix. B: Vitamin A/retinol is metabolized to atRA via two sequential enzymatic
  reactions. i: In the first reaction, RDH10 and DHRS3, two retinol dehydrogenases/reductases,
  reversibly oxidize retinol to retinal and vice versa. CRBP1 is a cellular retinol-binding
  protein that controls the availability of cellular retinol. ii: In the second reaction,
  ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3 (retinaldehyde dehydrogenases) irreversibly oxidize
  retinal to atRA. iii: RA enters the nucleus and specifically binds the retinoic
  acid receptor family: RARs α, β, and γ or RXRs α, β, and γ. iv: atRA is metabolized
  to 4-hydroxy-retinoic acid by cytochrome P450 proteins (CYP26A1, CYP26B1, and CYP26C1).
  v: RARs are ligand-dependent transcription factors and, when bound to atRA, regulate
  the expression of many RA target genes through binding to the RARE. Proteins whose
  gene expression is upregulated in VS ASCs are highlighted in red, and those that
  are downregulated in VS-ASCs are blue.'
