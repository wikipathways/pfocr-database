caption: The underlying mechanism of AF caused by TMAO. Created by ScienceSlides Software
  and Microsoft Office PowerPoint Software. Elevated plasma TMAO levels can promote
  AF in different ways. Firstly, activating NLRP3 inflammatory bodies and the NF-κ
  B pathway leads to the release of inflammatory factors and further promotes NGF
  expression. Both inflammatory factors and NGF can stimulate atrial plexus and induce
  AF. On the other hand, TMAO can activate the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway, and
  the activated inflammatory factors further promote myocardial fibrosis and induce
  arrhythmia.
