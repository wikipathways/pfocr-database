caption: TLR mediated signaling. (a) The Myd88 mediated pathway is shared by all the
  TLRs with the exception of TLR3. MyD88 recruits TRAF6 and members of the IRAK family.
  TRAF6, along with Uev1A and Ubc13 activates the TAK1 complex by a K63 linked ubiquitination.
  The TAK1 complex then activates the IKK complex that consists of IKKα, IKKβ and
  IKKγ, that further catalyzes IκB proteins phosphorylation. This in turn facilitates
  IκB proteins degradation by a proteasome-dependent manner, which allows NFκB translocation
  to the nucleus. In parallel to activating the IKK complex, TAK1 activates the MAPK
  pathway which culminates in AP-1 activation. The combination of AP-1 and NFκB controls
  inflammatory responses mediated by inflammatory cytokines. (b) The MyD88 independent
  pathway initiates when TRIF associates with TRAF3 which binds to TBK1 and IKKε.
  This binding culminates in IRF3 phosphorylation that facilitates IRF3 dimerization
  and translocation into the nucleus and transcription regulation. TRIF can also interact
  with TRAF6 which along with RIP1 mediates NFκB activation. TRIF can also induce
  IRF2 translocation to the nucleus and transcription through the PI3K-AKT pathway.
