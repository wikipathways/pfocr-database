caption: Hyper-methylation of promoter regions can lead to transcriptional silencing,
  resulting in partial or complete loss of the native protein harboring the repeats.
  In contrast, active transcription through the repeats can trigger formation of R-loops
  (RNA:DNA hybrids that lead to DNA damage response pathway activation) and potentially
  exacerbate somatic repeat instability. Transcribed repeat RNAs fold into complex
  structures, which aberrantly interact with and sequester cellular RNA-binding proteins
  (RBPs). Trinucleotide repeat expansions in protein-coding sequences generate mutant
  proteins that elicit gain-of-function toxicity. Finally, the coding and non-coding
  repeat RNAs are translated in the absence of canonical AUG-mediated initiation through
  repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation, producing toxic polymeric peptides.
