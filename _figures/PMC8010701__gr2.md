caption: 'Schematic representation of the mevalonate pathway. Acetyl-CoA is converted
  in two steps, sequentially catalyzed by ACAT1 and ACAT2 and HMGCS1 (HMG-CoA synthase
  1), to mevalonate, whose formation is the main rate-limiting step in the pathway,
  catalyzed by HMGCR (HMG-CoA reductase; inhibited by statins). The presqualene portion
  of the pathway generates a series of acyclic isoprenoid compounds, with a critical
  branch point at the level of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) generation. The committed
  step toward sterol synthesis involves epoxidation of squalene to squalene-2,3-epoxide,
  catalyzed squalene epoxidase (SQLE; inhibited by NB-598), which then undergoes cyclization
  to form the first sterol intermediate (lanosterol; 4α,4β,14α-trimethyl-cholesta-8(9),24-dien-3β-ol)
  in the postsqualene portion of the pathway. This is followed by a series of demethylation
  and double-bond isomerization and reduction reactions, with ultimate engagement
  of either the Bloch Pathway or the Kandutsch-Russell Pathway to form cholesterol.
  Reduction of the side-chain double bonds in desmosterol (cholesta-5,24-dien-3β-ol)
  and 7-dehydrodesmosterol (cholesta-5,7,24-trien-3β-ol) is catalyzed by DHCR24 (inhibited
  by U18666A), whereas reduction of the ring B nuclear double bond in 7-dehydrocholesterol
  (7DHC; cholesta-5,7-dien-3β-ol) and 7-dehydrodesmosterol are catalyzed by DHCR7
  (inhibited by AY9944). The mevalonate pathway is involved in the synthesis of several
  other important isoprenoid metabolites, including ubiquinone (coenzyme Q), dolichols,
  vitamin-D, and steroid hormones. Mutations in the DHCR24 gene lead to desmosterolosis,
  whereas such defects in the DHCR7 gene cause Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS).
  Inset: Chemical structure of cholesterol (cholest-5-en-3β–ol). DHCR24, 24-dehydrocholesterol
  reductase; DHCR7, 7DHC reductase.'
