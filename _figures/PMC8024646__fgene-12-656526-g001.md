caption: 'Pipeline showing how miRNA-mediated subpathway activity profiles were inferred
  based on gene and miRNA expression and topological weights in a global directed
  pathway network (GDPN). The method to identify accurate risk biomarkers of prostate
  cancer involved five steps: merge pathways and construct network; perform directed
  random walk; infer miRNA-mediated subpathway activity; select features and evaluate
  classification method; and obtain risk biomarkers. z(gi) refers to a row-normalized
  vector of the expression of the ith gene over all samples, while a(miRj) refers
  to a row-normalized vector of the activity values of the jth miRNA (namely, the
  jth miRNA-mediated subpathway) over all samples. The middle part of the figure shows
  how the activity profiles were inferred. The 343 canonical KEGG pathways were merged
  into the GDPN. There are 39,930 directed edges and 7,159 nodes besides the virtual
  node in the GDPN. The virtual node is represented as a circle with a dotted line.
  P0 refers to the matrix of the initial weights of all genes in the GDPN; P∞ refers
  to the final weights of all genes in the GDPN. To identify the important upstream
  genes, regarding assessing the direction of edges between genes, a gene was considered
  important if it influenced more downstream genes. The expression level and topological
  weights of the genes are integrated into a(miRj).'
