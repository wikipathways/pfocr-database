caption: Schematic model of molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of gene transcription
  and protein translation during mGluR-LTD in postsynaptic neurons of hippocampal
  CA3-CA1 synapses. Group I mGluR stimulation can activate the epidermal growth factor
  receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) via G-protein release, which activates the nonreceptor
  tyrosine kinase Src. Recruitment of the Shc-Grb2-Sos complex stimulates the small
  GTPase Ras, which leads to activation of ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK signaling cascades.
  ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK can also be stimulated by G-protein release via the small GTPase
  Rap1 through the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases MKK3/6 and MEK1/2, respectively.
  Stimulation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK signaling cascades leads to activation
  of the transcription factors Elk-1, CREB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), ATF2, c-Jun,
  c-Rel, and NF-κB via the kinases RSK1 and mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase-1.
  p38 MAPK is also linked to activation of the AA cascade of which the 12(S)-HPETE
  metabolite may serve as a retrograde signaling molecule. In addition, ERK1/2 signaling
  can mediate formation of the translation initiation eIF4F complex necessary for
  initiating protein synthesis. mGluR-LTD involves activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR
  signaling pathway via interactions with Homer and PI3K enhancer-L (PIKE-L). This
  can facilitate regulation of protein synthesis by activating S6K, eEF2, the eIF4F
  complex, and the cyclin1-CD4 complex. Furthermore, mGluR activation leads to dissociation
  and activation of eEF2K, which phosphorylates eEF2. Activated eEF2 prevents global
  protein translation but facilitates up-regulation of Arc/Arg3.1 synthesis, which
  is involved in AMPAR endocytosis. Other proteins synthesized during mGluR-LTD include
  STEP, FMRP, and MAP1B, which may also regulate AMPAR synaptic trafficking.
