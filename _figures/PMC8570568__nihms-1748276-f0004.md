caption: Consequences of the virus are indicated by black arrows, while consequences
  of ageing are indicated by red arrows. SARS-CoV-2 first enters cells by binding
  to ACE2, and viral entry then leads to the shedding of ACE2. Ageing may also be
  associated with reduced expression of ACE2, and the low expression of ACE2 after
  infection potentially mediates a pro-inflammatory state through the production of
  angiotensin (Ang) II. Severe COVID-19 has also been correlated with reduced type
  I IFN responses, a defect which may be compounded by aberrant type I IFN signaling
  with age. This could be made worse by the notable reduction in total number of pDCs
  found in severe COVID-19 patients. Aged pDCs also have a reduced ability to produce
  type I IFNs, and the pro-inflammatory nature of the SASP in older individuals desensitizes
  JAK/STAT signaling in innate immune cells. All of this would compound the loss of
  type I IFN signaling during severe COVID-19, ultimately leading to reduced expression
  of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and permitting enhanced viral propagation.
  This viral replication leads to cell death and damage, causing the production of
  immunostimulatory DAMPs and PAMPs. Signaling in response to these signals generally
  activates the NF-κB transcription factor, which is also the main immune signaling
  pathway engaged by SASP mediatorsand the persistent basal stimulation of pattern
  recognition receptors in older adults. NF-κB signaling promotes production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. DAMPs linked to both aging and viral infection can also trigger activation
  of inflammasomes such as NLRP3, potentiating cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18,
  as well as triggering further cell death through pyroptosis. SASP mediators and
  the autoimmune-prone environment associated with aging may also predispose aged
  individuals to a prothrombotic environment, and thrombosis and inflammation continue
  to promote one another in a feed-forward loop which further contributes to the hyperinflammatory,
  pathophysiological innate response that causes devastating outcomes observed in
  severe COVID-19.
