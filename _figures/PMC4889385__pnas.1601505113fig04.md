caption: Proposed models for the development of nutrition-dependent expression of
  alternative horned and hornless male morphs separated by a sharp body size threshold.
  (A) Results presented here suggest that (i) the Hh signal pathway negatively regulates
  horn growth in low-nutrition male beetles, whereas (ii) previous work implicated
  the somatic sex determination gene dsx in mediating nutrition-dependent exaggeration
  of horns under high nutrition. (B) Combined, dsx-mediated promotion of horns in
  high-nutrition individuals and Hh-mediated inhibition of horns in low-nutrition
  individuals have the potential to transform ancestral, linear into strongly sigmoidal
  scaling relationships characterized by a bimodal distribution of male phenotypes
  and the establishment of a sharp allometric size threshold.
