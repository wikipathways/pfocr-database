caption: A schematic representation of the role of several miRNAs in regulating the
  sonic hedgehog signaling pathway in glioma. Accumulating evidence has revealed that
  upregulation of miR-326 in combination with curcumin can effectively contribute
  in the suppression of proliferation, and elevation of the apoptosis process in glioma
  cells via attenuating the activation of the SHH/GLI1 pathway []. Another finding
  confirms that miR-9 via targeting PTCH1 and promoting expression of GLI1 can trigger
  the activation of sonic hedgehog cascade and modulate expression of drug efflux
  transporters, MDR1 and ABCG2 in glioblastoma cells, therefore enhancing Temozolomide
  resistance in tumor cells []. Furthermore, mounting research has demonstrated that
  Chidamide can play an important role in inhibiting the expression levels of Shh,
  Ihh, and Dhh via upregulating miR-338-5p, thereby suppressing the growth rate, migration,
  and invasion of human malignant glioma cells. In fact, Chidamide exerts its effects
  by enhancing oxidative stress via the miR-338-5p-mediated regulation of Hedgehog
  pathway []
