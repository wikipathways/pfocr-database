caption: The haem biosynthetic pathway and associated porphyria disorders. In mammals,
  haem is synthesised in all nucleated cells through eight enzymatic steps and is
  essential for life. Each of the porphyrias (orange boxes) is caused by partial deficiency
  of the associated haem biosynthesis enzyme (green boxes), except for X-linked erythropoietic
  protoporphyria (XLEPP), which is caused by gain-of-function mutations of the erythroid-specific
  δ-aminolaevulinic acid synthase 2 (ALAS2) gene. ALAS1, the housekeeping enzyme,
  is expressed in all other tissues. ALAS1 is under negative feedback control by haem
  (dashed blue line, left) and is rate-limiting under normal circumstances, when the
  catalytic capacities of the other enzymes in the pathway are normal. Drugs and hormonal
  factors have been identified as the most common precipitating factors for an acute
  attack (dashed red lines and sites of impact) []. Non-enzymatic and spontaneous
  cyclisation of hydroxymethylbilane to uroporphyrinogen I is an alternative path
  in cases of deficient uroporphyrinogen III synthase activity (dashed blue line,
  right). Figure modified from [,].
