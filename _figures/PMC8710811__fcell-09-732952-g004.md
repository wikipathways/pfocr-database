caption: Schematic illustration of the fibrotic role of sAREG, a substrate of ADAM17.
  After the proteolytic process of ADAM17, sAREG can activate EGFR, which is widely
  expressed on cardiac cells. The binding of sAREG to EGFR causes the receptor to
  undergo a conformational change known as “Dimerization,” resulting in homo- or heterodimers
  formation. This precedes an intracellular domain activation in its tyrosine residues
  by phosphorylation, promoting these same residues’ autophosphorylation in their
  homolog. Autophosphorylation of EGFR can activate it to induce the JAK/STAT pathway,
  leading to an increase in gene and protein expression of fibroblasts and pro-fibrotic
  factors such as TGF-β. Elevated fibroblasts can result in fibroblast activation,
  both mechanically by altered activation patterns and chemically by inflammatory
  mediators. Activated fibroblasts are transformed into myofibroblasts by TGF-β. Myofibroblasts
  are not present in normal cardiac tissue unless during cardiac injury and can induce
  pathological ECM remodeling, which characterizes cardiac fibrosis via the expression
  of α-SMA, collagen synthesis, and secretion of MMPs.
