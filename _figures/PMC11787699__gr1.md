caption: Role of YAP/TAZ in soluble biological signals in bone. The localization of
  YAP/TAZ is influenced by various soluble signaling factors. For example, molecules
  such as FGF-2, RANK, ERα, VEGF, and S1P/LPA can regulate the fate of YAP/TAZ through
  direct action or the classical Hippo signaling pathway, causing it to remain in
  the cytoplasm or be degraded by the proteasome. Conversely, upstream signals from
  BMP-2, IGF-1, TGF-β, GC, and DEX drive YAP/TAZ to the nucleus, where they interact
  with the TEAD and Smad protein families
