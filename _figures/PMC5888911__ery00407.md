caption: Schematic representation of the influence of high NT on FA anabolism and
  catabolism biosynthetic pathways. High NT promoted the expression of the genes in
  the FA biosynthesis pathway (; Supplementary Table S17), in particular FAD2 and
  FAD3, but also the genes enhancing GA signal (). The enhanced GA signal resulted
  in the increased expression of SFAR genes (Supplementary Table S9) (right). The
  free FAs are subjected to β-oxidation, a process in which FAs are degraded into
  acetyl-CoA. Subsequently, acetyl-CoA is converted into 4-C compounds via the glyoxylate
  cycle, which occurs partially in the peroxisome (left). The numbers in parentheses
  indicate the up-regulated folds of the genes in relevant cycles. FAD, fatty acid
  desaturase; MLS, malate synthase; ICL, isocitrate lyase; MFP, multifunctional protein;
  KAT, 3-keto-acyl-CoA thiolase; ACT, anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase; ICL,
  isocitrate lyase; and cts, comatose.
