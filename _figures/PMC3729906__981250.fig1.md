caption: Schematic representation of molecules examined by immunohistochemistry. The
  proteins explored are depicted in color, including molecules involved in T-cell
  receptor (TCR) signaling and T-cell differentiation/activation, and others. In brief,
  antigen ligation to the TCR/CD3 complex initiates a signaling cascade involving
  the protein tyrosine kinases ZAP-70, Lck, Fyn and Itk. Downstream consequences include
  Ca2+ flux, NFATc2 nuclear translocation, MAP kinase activation (ERK, JNK and p38),
  transcription and cytokine release. CD69 and ICOS, upregulated following TCR engagement,
  act as co-stimulatory molecules. Syk is a ZAP-70 homolog physiologically expressed
  in B cells. CD30 signaling activates the NFκB pathway and also ERK, thereby inducing
  JunB expression; conversely, JunB activates CD30 transcription. ALK fusion proteins
  phosphorylate STAT3, in addition to activating the ERK pathway. Downstream targets
  of pSTAT3 include CEBP/β and cyclin D3. Further information on the molecules explored
  is provided in Online Supplementary Table S2.
