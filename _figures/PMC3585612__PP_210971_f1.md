caption: The proposed monolignol biosynthetic pathway. The principal pathways for
  the biosynthesis of monolignols 4-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols are
  highlighted in gray. The first step in the pathway involves the deamination of Phe
  to cinnamic acid by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). A multiple protein complex
  (C4H-C3H) consists of cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase
  (C3H) hydroxylate cinnamic acid at the ring 4 position to 4-coumaric acid and subsequently
  at the ring-3 position of 4-coumaric acid to caffeic acid (). 4CL then activates
  the hydroxycinnamic acids to their corresponding CoA thioesters. The C4H-C3H protein
  complex, in conjunction with 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate shikimate 4-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase
  (HCT), hydroxylate 4-coumaroyl-CoA, at the 3 position to caffeoyl-CoA. Caffeoyl-CoA
  O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), coniferyl aldehyde 5-hydroxylase (CAld5H), and 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde
  O-methyltransferase (AldOMT) modify the phenolic ring at the 3 and 5 positions through
  a series of hydroxylation and methoxylation reactions. Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR)
  and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) reduce the phenolic intermediates to monolignols.
