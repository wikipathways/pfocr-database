caption: . PI3K/AKT pathway *The pathway begins with an extracellular stimuli activating
  a receptor tyrosine kinase, triggering the activation of RAS followed by PI3K. Activated
  PI3K catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), a step that is regulated by
  PTEN. PIP3 activates the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, which targets
  and phosphorylates AKT. Phosphorylated AKT then enters the nucleus, where it increases
  the expression of tumor-promoting genes. Activated AKT also produces changes in
  the cytoplasm by activating mTOR and thus promoting translation. AKT can also phosphorylate
  glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK3-β), inactivating the protein. GSK3-β inhibition
  results in a concomitant stimulation of β-catenin, allowing it to enter the nucleus
  and increase expression of tumor-promoting genes.
