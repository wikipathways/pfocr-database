caption: Model of the processing route of green leaf volatiles. The biosynthetic pathway
  of GLVs originated from LNA is depicted in the emitter plant (top leaf). Processing
  of exogenous GLVs is depicted in the receiver plant (bottom leaf). The compounds,
  enzymes, and other processes are described as underlined, plain, and dotted-underlined
  text, respectively. The enzymatic conversion and airborne transfer are indicated
  as solid and dotted arrows, respectively. The potential components, which were not
  found or tested in this study, are shown in gray.
