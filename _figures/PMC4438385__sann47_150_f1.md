caption: Brown adipose tissue uncoupling and thermogenesis. In brown adipose tissue
  (BAT), sympathetic stimulation releases norepinephrine (NE) activating β3-adrenoreceptors
  (β3-AR) in brown adipocytes coupled to G-proteins, which activates adenylate cyclase
  (AC), turning AMP into cAMP that in turn activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA induces
  lipolysis activating adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase
  (HSL; the active isoform being pHSL), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) which hydrolyzes
  triglycerides, diacylglycerol, and monoacylglycerol, respectively, releasing free
  fatty acids (FFAs). FFAs are then imported into the mitochondria through carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a), where they are oxidized (via β-oxidation and further
  citric acid cycle), leading to the formation of NADH and FADH, which are then oxidized
  by the electron transport chain. This results in pumping protons out of the mitochondrial
  matrix and the creation of a proton-motive force that drives the protons back into
  the mitochondrial matrix through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). The energy stored
  in the proton-motive force is then released, starting mitochondrial heat production.
  Furthermore, PKA activation increases UCP1 expression via mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 pathway responsible
  for gene transcription, cell growth, cell differentiation and protein synthesis.
