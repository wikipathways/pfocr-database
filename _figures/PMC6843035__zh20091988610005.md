caption: Phosphoinositide signaling pathway in renal collecting duct cells. Proteins
  in red undergo changes in phosphorylation in response to dDAVP (see  for specific
  regulated phosphopeptides). Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase-α and -β (Pi4ka and
  Pi4kb, respectively), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] 5-kinase type-1α
  and -1γ (Pip5k1a and Pip5k1c, respectively), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  [PI(4,5)P2] phosphodiesterase-β4 (Plcb4) are shown. Sites in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  [I(1,4,5)P3] receptor type 1 and 3 (Itpr1 and Itpr3, respectively) likely increase
  Ca2+ release (). The upregulated site in serine/threonine-protein kinase D1 (Prkd1)
  increases its activity. DAG, diacylglycerol; Gαq, G protein subunit Gαq; P2ry2,
  purinergic P2Y2 receptor; Prkce and Prkch, PKC ε- and C η-type, respectively.
