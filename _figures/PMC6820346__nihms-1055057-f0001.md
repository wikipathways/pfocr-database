caption: The HGF/Met pathway. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is mainly produced
  and secreted by the tumor-associated fibroblast (TAF) as an inactive precursor pro-HGF
  (Step 1; ref. ). Cleavage of pro-HGF to active HGF is facilitated, among others,
  by the membrane-anchored enzyme matriptase on the cancer cell surface (Step 2; ref.
  ). HGF binding to Met results in a dimerization of two Met receptor molecules ().
  Upon dimerization, activation of both receptors is promoted by transphosphorylation
  at several binding sites (Y1230, Y1234, Y1235; refs. , ). Further tyrosine residues
  on the C-terminal end (Y1349, Y1356) become phosphorylated, serving as docking sites
  for downstream adaptor molecules, such as Grb2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1;
  Step 4; ref. ). Importantly, Gab1 as major adaptor molecule for downstream of HGF/Met
  signaling can bind to Met indirectly via Grb2 (). Common HGF/Met downstream signaling
  is mediated by PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Ras/Raf (MAPK signaling pathway) and STAT3 (Step 5;
  ref. ). Activation of these downstream pathways drive transcriptomic changes (Step
  6), that mediate a plethora of cancer cell phenotypes (Step 7; refs. , , , ). The
  mechanism by which cancer cells engage TAFs to produce pro-HGF is not fully understood
  (Step 8).
