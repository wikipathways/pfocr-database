caption: 'Cross talk between HSPs and redox reaction: -Heat stress imposes damages
  to plant like increased membrane fluidity, unfolding of proteins, ROS production
  and dissociation of HSP70/90-HsfA1 complex. To endure HS, Plants activate various
  mechanisms to preserve their adaptation. First such mechanism is the activation
  of cyclic nucleotide gated calcium (CNGC) channels that result in the movement of
  Ca2+ions in to cytoplasm and bind with Calmodulin Protein (CaM3) forming the Ca2+-CaM3
  complex and help in the activation of Heat shock factors (HSFs). Second mechanism
  involves Phosphoinositol signaling pathway that also lead to the influx of more
  Ca2+in to the cytoplasm and merge with Ca2+-CaM3 pathway. Another mechanism during
  HS is the activation of ROS signaling network by Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog
  D (RBOHD) that produce O2− which is converted in to H2O2 that is involved in the
  induction of HSFs activation. ROS like H2O2 also activate the HSFs complex through
  mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). On activation, HSFs move to the nucleus
  and activate HSE and HSP target genes. HS also lead to the dissociation, of HSP70/90-HsfA1
  complex; on dissociation HsfA1 undergoes trimerization that further activates the
  HSFs complex in the cytosol and Heat shock element (HSE) in the nucleus. Their activation
  has many positive effects on the cellular metabolism like transcriptional regulation,
  activation of antioxidant system and multi chaperone network (HSP60, HSP70, HSP90,
  HSP100, and sHSP) that may lower down the ROS levels in the cell and help in achieving
  thermotolerance.'
