caption: Schematic diagram of the protective effects of FMT administration on the
  rotenone-induced PD mouse model through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Briefly,
  FMT treatment restores the gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by rotenone, which decreases
  the generation of pathogenic LPS in the gut and inhibits the intestinal inflammation
  by downregulating the TLR4 signaling pathway. Then, the reduced intestinal barrier
  permeability decreases the leakage of microbes, LPS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) into the systemic circulation. As a consequence of
  reduced systemic inflammation, lower levels of LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines
  get access to the SN across the BBB, which inhibits neuroinflammation (activated
  astrocytes and microglia) through suppressing LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway activation
  in the SN. Eventually, the dopaminergic neuronal death is attenuated in the SN.
  This diagram demonstrates that FMT treatment can correct the gut microbiota dysbiosis
  and ameliorate the rotenone-induced PD mouse model, in which suppression of the
  inflammation mediated by the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway both in the gut and the
  brain possibly plays a significant role. Further, it is shown that microbiota dysbiosis
  is involved in the genesis of PD via the microbiota-gut-brain axis
