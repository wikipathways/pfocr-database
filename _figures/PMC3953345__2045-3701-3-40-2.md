caption: Schematic presentation of the molecular mechanisms of myogenic differentiation.
  RA directs myogenic differentiation through the regulation of Pax3 and Myf5 gene
  expression, whereas bexarotene (BEX) enhances the commitment of skeletal muscle
  lineage through the Meox1 and Pax3 pathways. The histone acetyltransferase p300
  is directly involved in the regulation of myogenic differentiation through histone
  acetylation at the Pax3, Myf5, and MyoD gene loci. Solid arrows indicate identified
  regulatory pathways, whereas a dashed arrow suggests a potential regulatory pathway.
