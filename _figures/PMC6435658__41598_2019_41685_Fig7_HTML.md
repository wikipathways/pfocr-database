caption: 'Illustration summarizes the molecular mechanism and signaling pathways underlying
  the effect of Dis on HCT-116 cells. Dis triggers intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic
  pathway. Dis induces P53 phosphorylation, which is upstream of Bax. Bax increases
  the permeability of mitochondria, hence Cytochrome C leaks into the cytoplasm. Release
  of Cytochrome C promotes the cleavage of pro-Caspase 9 into an active form. Activation
  of Caspase 9 leads to the activation of other caspase members such as Caspase 3/7.
  hdacs/sin3, Hsp27 and Survivin which are known as inhibitors of P53, Cytochrome
  C and Caspase 9, respectively were down-regulated in the presence of Dis. When Fas
  and TNF-α were activated by P53, it activates Pro-Caspase 8, which is attached to
  the death domain (FADD) of Fas and TNF receptors. This attachment triggers the cleavage
  and activation of Caspase 8, which activates the caspase cascades. In the presence
  of Dis, NF-ƙB is arrested by iƙb (NF-ƙB inhibitor), hence the translocation of NF-ƙB
  to nucleus was inhibited. Dis is able to inhibit the p21 inhibitors through the
  inhibition of bmp. In the presence of Dis, bmp is not able to change the assembly
  of smad9. Therefore, smad9 is not translocated to the nucleus, hence activation
  of id1 and id2 were inhibited. Green: up regulated, Red: down regulated, inhibition:–|,
  induction: →.'
