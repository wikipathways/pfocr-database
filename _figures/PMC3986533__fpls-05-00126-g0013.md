caption: Anabolic reaction sequences in chloroplasts (A,B) and root plastids (C,D)
  of wild-type (A,C) and cue1 mutant plants (B,D). In chloroplasts (A,B) CO2 is assimilated
  in the reductive pentose phosphate pathway (RPPP; Calvin-Benson cycle) via ribulose
  1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO;1). Its product, 3-PGA, is then
  converted to triose phosphates (TP) via the subsequent action of phosphoglycerate
  kinase and NADP glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (PGK/NADP-GAPDH; 2). TPs
  are exported via the TPT in counter exchange with inorganic phosphate (Pi) and subjected
  to Suc biosynthesis in the cytosol. Suc is the main transport sugar that is exported
  to the sinks via the phloem. In chloroplast glycolysis, 3-PGA can only be metabolized
  to 2-PGA via phosphoglycerate mutase (PGyM; 3), but not further to PEP. Under defined
  conditions, it can also enter the phospho-serine pathway of Ser biosynthesis. In
  leaves Ser is, however, mainly produced by photorespiration (PR) or is imported
  from non-green tissues, such as roots. TPs in the cytosol can undergo the glycolytic
  conversion to 3-PGA, involving PGK/NAD-GAPDH (5), and further to 2-PGA and PEP by
  the subsequent action of cytosolic PGyM (6) and enolase (ENO2; 7). PEP has to be
  imported to the stroma via PPT1 or PPT2 in counter exchange with either 2-PGA or
  Pi. The latter derive, for instance, from the shikimate pathway, where PEP and erythrose
  4-phosphate (E-4-P) serve as precursors. End products of the shikimate pathway are
  the aromatic amino acids (AAA) Phe and Tyr, which are synthesized from the intermediate
  chorismate, and Trp, which is synthesized from anthranilate as well as phosphoribosyl
  pyrophosphate (PRPP) and Ser. AAA are exported via amino acid transporters (AAT).
  PEP can be further metabolized by plastidial (4) or cytosolic (8) pyruvate kinase
  (PK) yielding pyruvate. Outside the chloroplasts pyruvate is subjected to mitochondrial
  respiration. In the chloroplast stroma pyruvate can enter de novo fatty acid biosynthesis,
  the production of the branched-chain amino acids Leu and Val as well as the MEP
  pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. The third branched-chain amino acid Ile uses
  Thr as a precursor. In contrast to wild-type chloroplasts (A), chloroplasts from
  cue1 (B) suffer from a limitation in PEP provision and processes like the production
  of AAA via the shikimate pathway are impaired (green background) and thus rely on
  PEP supply by PPT2. Anabolic sequences with pyruvate as precursor would probably
  be less affected (light blue-green background) as pyruvate might also be supplied
  by pyruvate transporters (PyrT). In roots (C,D) reducing power and metabolic intermediates
  are provided by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) with Glc6P as precursor
  and TP as end products. Cytosolic Glc6P deriving from the degradation of imported
  sucrose is provided to the plastid by the GPT in counter exchange with either TP
  or Pi. Glc6P can be converted to Fru6P by plastidial or cytosolic phosphoglucose
  isomerise (PGI; 9, 14), activated to Fru1,6P2 by phosphofructokinase (PFK; 10, 15),
  and cleaved by aldolase (11, 16) to TP, which are subsequently converted to 3-PGA,
  2-PGA, and PEP by plastidial or cytosolic PGK/NAD-GAPDH (5, 12), PGyM (3, 6), and
  ENO (7, 13). Note that in root plastids ENO1 is present. The fate of PEP in plastidial
  and cytosolic metabolism of roots is similar as in leaves. However, a blocked PEP
  transport across the envelope of root plastids due to a knockout of PPT1 cannot
  be compensated by PPT2 (D), and would lead to an increased production rather than
  a depletion of products deriving from PEP and pyruvate (light red background). It
  is likely that processes like the OPPP or the phospho-serine pathway are also increased
  by feedback regulatory mechanisms.
