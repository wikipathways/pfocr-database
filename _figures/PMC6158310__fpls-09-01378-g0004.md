caption: A model of G protein-related high light, cold and ER stress in plants. (A)
  AtGPA1, labeled as Gα in the figure, is activated by high light or UVB stress in
  Arabidopsis. AtGPA1 induces a transient increase of [Ca2+] in cytosol and RBOH activation
  and the following NO-dependent ROS accumulation. The downstream stress response
  genes are subsequently up-regulated, which eventually cause the stress phenotype.
  (B) Cold stress response through G protein pathway. COLD1 interacts with AtGPA1
  and elevates cytosolic [Ca2+] concentration at low temperature. The expression of
  stress-related TF DREB1A/C is upregulated, which leads to the up-regulation of stress
  responsive genes (Ma et al., ). (C) ER stress induces the expression of Gβγ-regulated
  Bip, IRE1, several bZIPs and UPR genes.
