caption: Scheme of induced immune response following mRNA vaccination. Dendritic cell
  (DC) maturation upon (ds) mRNA sensing by TLRs (adjuvant effect of mRNA) and subsequent
  Type I interferon (INF) production [, , ]. Type I INF initiates the transcription
  of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) involved in the DC maturation process, but
  also activates antiviral enzymes that promote mRNA degradation and inhibit antigen
  expression (innate immune response) []. The mature DC can express the antigenic
  proteins and present them on MHC class I and class II to CD8+ (cytotoxic) and CD4+(helper)
  T cells respectively (adaptive immune response) []. Secreted antigen can be presented
  through the MHC II pathway to T helper cells and B cells, to generate memory B cells
  and plasma cells that can engender antigen-specific immune defenses and antibody
  production resulting in a durable protection [,]. Figure created using BioRender.com.
