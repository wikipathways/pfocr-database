caption: Proposed mechanisms of TIE inhibition of LPS plus IFNγ induced inflammation
  in RAW264.7 cells. TIE inactivates MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in addition
  to inhibiting expression of miR155, which may result from TIE downregulation of
  iNOS, COX-2, and IL-6 expression and their production. Arrows indicate the main
  inflammatory pathway activated by LPS stimulation. The prohibition signs indicate
  the inhibitory effects of TIE.
