caption: Oxylipin Signaling pathway in Arabidopsis.Hypothetical model showing the
  function of COI1 in ubiquitin (UB) mediated proteolysis (A). A developmental or
  environmental signal causes the phosphorylation of R, a regulatory protein. Phosphorylated
  R binds to COI1 via a leucine repeat region (blue squares). A SCF complex (Skp1,
  Cdc53, and COI1) act as a ubiquitin ligase to transfer ubiquitin to R. After polyubiquination,
  R is released and destroyed by the proteosome (modified from ). A hypothetical model
  for wound signaling (B) in Arabidopsis showing JA-dependent (lower) and JA-independent
  (upper) pathways (modified from  and others). The cev1 and cex1 mutants positive
  activate the JA dependent pathway. Other mutants, such as coi1, jin1, and jin4,
  prevent JA induced gene expression.
