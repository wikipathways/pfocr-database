caption: Model summarizing the functional relationship between Rab5-Rab11 GTPases
  and BDNF/TrkB-mediated CREB transcriptional regulation. In the plasma membrane,
  BDNF binds TrkB, promoting its activation and internalization in Rab5-positive early
  endosomes (in green) in dendrites () and somas of hippocampal neurons. From early
  endosomes, receptors are sorted to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes (in blue)
  or to late endosomes/lysosomes for degradation (data not shown). TrkB increases
  the activity of both Rab5 and Rab11 GTPases (; ), in addition to classical signaling
  pathways such as PI3K–Akt–mTor (in light yellow) and MAPK/Erk1/2 (in orange). The
  activity of Rab5 and Rab11 was required for the long-lasting activation of Akt and
  Erk1/2. Interestingly, reducing the activity of Rab5 diminished the levels of the
  endogenous Rab11 protein. Consistent with these results, the inhibition of Rab5
  activity resulted in severe downregulation of Erk1/2 activation, positioning Rab5
  activity upstream of Rab11 and long-lasting Erk1/2 activity. Erk1/2 was required
  for CREB phosphorylation in the nucleus (in pink), and reducing the activity of
  both Rab5 and Rab11 blocked CREB phosphorylation. Finally, blocking Rab11 activity
  reduced early-gene transcriptional regulation mediated by BDNF. Akt activation by
  BDNF may contribute to Rab5-Rab11-mediated CREB nuclear phosphorylation by increasing
  the protein levels of both Rab5 and Rab11 GTPases () and thus support a positive
  feedback loop for intracellular BDNF/TrkB signaling. Overall, our data support a
  role for somatic Rab11 recycling endosomes as an integrator of intracellular signaling
  mediated by BDNF/TrkB signaling endosomes and leading to transcriptional changes.
