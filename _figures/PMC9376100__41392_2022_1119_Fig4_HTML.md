caption: Drugs targeting the apoptosis signaling in NASH. Inflammatory cytokines stimulate
  hepatocyte apoptosis through different pathways such as TRAIL signaling, Fas signaling
  and TNFα signaling pathway. TRAIL is a member of the TNF superfamily that can lead
  to the induction of apoptosis in tumors or infected cells. The Fas receptor induces
  an apoptotic signal by binding to FasL expressed on the surface of other cells.
  TNFα is a classical cytokine and its signaling pathway had been well investigated.
  Antagonists and inhibitors at different trial stages are as indicated. Drugs at
  different clinical stages are indicated in different colors. Created with BioRender.
