caption: Three major metabolic pathways that generating and consuming AKG. The left
  part shows TCA cycle, in which isocitrate is converted to AKG by IDH3 in mitochondrion,
  and subsequently AKG is catalyzed by α-KGDH to generate succinyl-CoA. The right
  part illustrates the other two signaling which utilize glutamine to generate AKG,
  namely glutaminase I pathway (occurring mostly in mitochondrion) and glutaminase
  II pathway (both in the cytosol and mitochondrion). Besides, AKG is also involved
  in amino acids metabolism, as demonstrated in the upper right.
