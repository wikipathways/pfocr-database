caption: Hypothesis of possible IFN-I signaling pathway regulatory mechanism based
  on our findings in PD. Various toxic metabolites and proteins could increase NFATc2
  expression may positively regulate expression of interferon-β and NF-κB, which in
  turn, enhance IFNs signaling, resulting in unexpected consequences (neuroinflammation,
  neuronal apoptosis, axonal degeneration, etc.). Images were drawn by Figdraw
