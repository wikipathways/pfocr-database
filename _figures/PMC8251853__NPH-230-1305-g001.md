caption: Schematic representation of the jasmonate (JA)‐mediated manipulation of plant–insect
  interaction by viruses. In uninfected plants, infestation of plants by insects leads
  to activation of JA biosynthesis/catabolism and signaling, which in turn reduce
  the population of insects. Schematic overview of the flux of JA biosynthesis/catabolism
  and signaling is modified from Browse () and Pieterse et al. (). Biosynthesis of
  JA starts with linolenic acid (LA), which is converted to α‐LA by FAD3 and FAD7,
  and finally to JA‐isoleucine (JA‐Ile). Upon JA‐Ile synthesis, JAZ proteins are ubiquitinated
  and degraded by 26S proteasomes, thereby relieving JAZ‐mediated suppression of MYC2.
  MYC2 then forms an active dimer to activate the expression of downstream genes such
  as terpene synthase (TPS) and epi‐arisotolchene synthase (EAS) genes, and in turn
  the synthesis of volatiles, including terpenoids. In addition, activation of JA‐signaling
  pathway results in interaction between ORA59 and WRKY20, which in turn activates
  the expression of downstream genes, such as PLANT DEFENSIN 1.2 (PDF1.2). However,
  in virus‐infected plants, virus infection compromises the activation of JA biosynthesis/catabolism
  and signaling at several levels, resulting in a reduction in the biosynthesis and
  release of volatiles and an increase in the insect population. Specifically, βC1
  encoded by tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) downregulates the expression
  of FAD3 and FAD7 and interacts with MYC2 and AS1 to interfere with JA biosynthesis/catabolism
  and signaling, respectively (Yang et al., ; Luan et al., ; Li et al., ). C2 encoded
  by tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and 2b encoded by cucumber mosaic virus
  (CMV) interact with ubiquitin and JAZ, respectively, thereby preventing the degradation
  of JAZ to interfere with JA signaling (Wu et al., ; Li et al., ). In addition, BV1
  encoded by cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV), NSs encoded by tomato spotted wilt
  virus (TSWV), and tomato zonate spot virus (TZSV) bind to MYC2, thereby preventing
  the dimerization of MYC2 and activation of downstream gene expression (Li et al.,
  ; Wu et al., ). βC1 encoded by cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMuV) binds to
  WRKY20 to interfere with the interaction between WRKY20 and ORA59 and, in turn,
  the expression of downstream genes (Zhao et al., ).
