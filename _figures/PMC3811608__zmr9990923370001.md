caption: Simplified schematic of the early steps in a canonical homologous recombination
  pathway in the eukaryotic nucleus and in bacteria. Upon DNA damage, the free ends
  of a DSB are first processed by an exonuclease. The exposed 3′ ssDNA tails are coated
  by single-strand DNA binding proteins (SSBs) to prevent the formation of secondary
  structures. The recombination mediator, Rad52 (or RecO in bacteria), then displaces
  SSB and recruits the Rad51/RecA-type recombinase to form presynaptic helical nucleoprotein
  filaments. These filaments then initiate homology search and catalyze ATP-dependent
  strand invasion within duplex DNA templates. The invading strand provides a free
  3′ end for priming DNA replication that allows the restoration of genetic information
  missing from the dsDNA breaks. The Rad52 protein has a second function in this pathway,
  which is to capture the second end through its single-strand annealing activity.
  After DNA synthesis and ligation, double Holliday junctions are formed. The Holliday
  junctions can be resolved by different molecular strategies with or without DNA
  strand crossover. Without the capturing of the second end by Rad52, the invading
  strand may be dissociated from the D-loop and reannealed to the ssDNA on the second
  end, a process known as synthesis-dependent strand annealing (not shown).
