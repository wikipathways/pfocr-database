caption: 'HNF4α Downregulation Drives Hepatocellular Carcinoma Proliferation and Genomic
  Instability: Downregulation of HNF4α promotes HCC progression through key molecular
  pathways. Reduced HNF4α leads to increased c-MYC activation, which suppresses p21
  and subsequently elevates Cyclin D1, driving cell cycle progression and HCC proliferation.
  Additionally, increased Cyclin F expression due to HNF4α loss contributes to genomic
  instability. Both pathways converge to promote HCC proliferation. The red arrows
  indicate downregulation, while green arrows indicate upregulation. Created with
