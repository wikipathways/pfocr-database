caption: Comparison of glucose metabolism in a normal and cancer cell and potential
  inhibitors of glucose metabolism l. The majority of normal cells utilize glucose
  as a substrate in the glycolytic pathway. Then pyruvate, a product in this process,
  enters the mitochondria and after being converted into acetylo-CoA enters the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle. In cancer cells, overexpression of GLUT transporters causes increased
  glucose uptake compared to normal cells. Increased expression of glycolytic enzymes
  is also observed. M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase shows reduced catalytic activity
  which allows the directing of part of the created G-6-P to the pentose phosphate
  pathway. The PKM2 isoform also stimulates HIF-1 into increased transcriptional activity
  by binding to the transactivation domain of HIF1-α subunit. The activation of HIF
  results in increased expression of the key elements of glucose metabolism, for example,
  GLUT transporters, enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, and lactate dehydrogenase.
  Most of the pyruvate created in cancer cells is converted into lactate by lactate
  dehydrogenase. Lactate is transported outside of cells by the monocarboxylate transporters,
  whose amount is elevated in cancer cells.
