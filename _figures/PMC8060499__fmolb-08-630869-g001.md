caption: 'Possible involvement of the complement system (CS) in the recruitment of
  neutrophils and the formation of NETs in Alzheimer''s disease. When the blood-brain
  barrier (BBB) is intact, most complement molecules do not pass through it but can
  be produced constitutively by brain cells. In AD, the BBB is compromised, facilitating
  the passage of complement elements, among other pro-inflammatory elements (). Aβ
  plaques are recognized as DAMPs by CS components and other innate immunity receptors,
  leading to the activation of BBB endothelial cells. They up-regulate ICAM-1 adhesion
  molecules, allowing neutrophils to adhere and interact with LFA-1, invading the
  cerebral parenchyma (). There the neutrophils worsen neuroinflammation, performing
  NET extrusion. In this context, the CS may be involved trough: (1) C1q binding to
  the Aβ plates, activating the classical complement pathway; (2a) CR1 (CR1*A) molecules
  present in the neutrophil membrane, that recognize the Aβ plates opsonized with
  C3b fragments, preferentially leading to NET extrusion; (2b) soluble CR1 formed
  by non-functional isoforms (CR1*B) that do not inhibit the CS (3) Potent anaphylatoxins
  such as C5a, which recruit neutrophils from the periphery to the Aβ plaque, being
  recognized by C5aR1 neutrophil receptors, promoting the release of NETs. Although
  other elements of the inflammatory reaction do occur, in this figure, we focus on
  elements of the CS discussed throughout this study. The complement cascades’ reactions
  were not represented due to space and number of elements participating in the pathways.
  The role of cytokines and endothelial adhesion molecules in neutrophil recruitment
  for Aβ plaques was extensively reviewed by  ICAM-1- Intercellular adhesion molecule
  1; LFA-1- Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1; NET- extracellular neutrophil
  traps; CS- complement system; C1q- complement component 1q; CR1- complement receptor
