caption: 'HCO3− entry is mediated by SLC26A3 with an exchange of 2Cl−/HCO3−. CFTR,
  apart from its reported role in conducting HCO3− directly, may act as a Cl− channel
  to provide a recycling pathway for Cl−, which is required for the operation of SLC26A3.
  The HCO3−-dependent events, including activation of soluble adenylate cyclase (sAC),
  leading to sperm capacitation are also shown. CNG: cyclic nucleotide-gated channels.'
