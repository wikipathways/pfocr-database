caption: 'Influence of intestinal microbiota on the immune system in CRC patients.
  The immune system plays an important role in the development of CRC by virtue of
  its tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing effects. The immune system can be categorized
  as the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. In the innate immune
  system: NK cells secrete IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin and GZMB to suppress tumors and
  can be converted to hILC1 under certain conditions; ILC2 secretes IL-5 and IL-3;
  ILC3 secretes IL-22 and IL-17A; tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) and macrophages
  (TAM) also play a significant role; In the adaptive immune system: CD8+ T cells
  and Th1 cells secrete IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin and GZMB; Treg cells secrete TGF-β
  and IL-10; Th17 cells secrete IL-22 and IL-17A. The innate and the adaptive immunity
  reinforce each other and play a pro-tumor or anti-tumor role together. The gut microbiota
  can influence on CRC cells through various mechanisms. For example: microbiota disrupt
  the gut barrier; some microbiota increase pro-inflammatory responses through PCWBR2
  or activation of the NF-κB/STAT3 signaling pathway with lineage cells; others can
  act on domain CRC cells by regulating TAN, TAM through CXCL1/2/5.'
