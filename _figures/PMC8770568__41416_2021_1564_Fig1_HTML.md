caption: Therapeutics are identified in red. Targeting of the PI3K pathway can be
  achieved through upstream IGF1-R inhibition, direct PI3K inhibition, or downstream
  inhibition of mTOR or metabolic functions. The ER biomodulator BHPI both inhibits
  ER and stimulates the UPR to facilitate cell death. The small-molecular inhibitor
  ER-148 stimulates ubiquitination of ER via recruitment of E3-ligase. The ER co-activator
  SRC3 can be disrupted by the SRC inhibitor SI-2. Modulation of the cell cycle is
  an effective strategy that acts by inducing cell cycle arrest by inhibition of CDK4/6.
  Epigenetic modification of acetylation may be an effective strategy to inhibit HDACs
  or BET proteins. In addition, clinical trials are currently evaluating the efficacy
  of oral SERDs and next-generation SERMs to expand endocrine therapy options in ESR1
  mutant breast cancer. ER oestrogen receptor, SERD selective oestrogen receptor degrader,
  Ub ubiquitin, NG SERMs next-generation selective oestrogen receptor modulators,
  IGF1-R insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, CDK cyclin-dependent kinase, UPR unfolded
  protein response, SRC3 steroid receptor co-activator 3, CoA co-activator, HDAC histone
  deacetylase, BET bromodomain and extra-terminal motif protein, PI3K phosphoinositide
  3-kinase, AKT protein kinase B, mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin, BCL-2 B-cell
  lymphoma 2, Ac acetylation.
