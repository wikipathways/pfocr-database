caption: The metabolite changes detected by 1H NMR hemolymph analysis and the pathway
  referenced to the KEGG database show the interrelationship of the identified metabolic
  pathways involved in the experimental Eri silkworms. Metabolites with increased
  and decreased levels compared to control silkworms are indicated in red and blue.
