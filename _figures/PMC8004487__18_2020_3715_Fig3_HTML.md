caption: Role of sphingolipid associated loci in major sphingolipid metabolic pathways.
  Most of the sphingolipid associated loci contain genes that code for enzymes (highlighted
  in red font) involved in sphingolipid metabolic pathways. SGPP1 codes for a S1P
  phosphatase that catalyzes the degradation of sphingosine-1-P to sphingosine to
  facilitate ceramides synthesis catalyzed by ceramide synthases (CERS1-6) including
  CERS4 and CERS6. SPTLC3 gene encodes a subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase
  complex which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of de novo pathway in sphingolipid
  biosynthesis. FADS1-2-3 locus encodes enzymes that regulate the desaturation of
  fatty acids and have important role in generation of unsaturated ceramides. GLTPD2
  codes for glycolipid transfer protein domain-containing protein 2 and has putative
  role in transfer of ceramide-1-phosphate
