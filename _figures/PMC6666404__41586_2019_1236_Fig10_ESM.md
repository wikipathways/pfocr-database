caption: a, Comparison of AUC test (two-sided) performance with LR analysis with the
  time covariate. Left, distribution plot of P values resulting from the AUC test.
  Right, distribution plot of P values resulting from the LR analysis. The pie chart
  shows the number of differentially expressed genes (q < 0.1) for both methods and
  the overlapping number. b, Top, comparison of results from paired t-test (two-sided)
  with DESeq2 method (Wald test) for stage pairwise analyses (for example, EE versus
  personal healthy baseline). Seventy-one per cent of transcripts identified by DESeq2
  method overlap with paired t-test results. Bottom, P value distribution for paired
  t-test (left) and DESeq2 (right). Both methods show a homogenous distribution of
  P values with enrichment for significant ones. Supplementary Table 39 lists molecules
  found significant by paired t-test or DESeq2 method. c, Illustration of IL10 pathway
  enriched in response to RVI. Multi-omic molecules that changed significantly during
  the course of RVI by AUC test are highlighted in red (upregulated) or green (downregulated).
  d, An example of enriched neuroinflammation signalling showing molecules significantly
  upregulated (red) or downregulated (green) in response to RVI. Simplified pathway
  graph is shown in Fig.  (bottom). e, Illustration of insulin signalling (left) and
  cardiac hypertrophy (right) pathways, which were enriched in response to RVI. Molecules
  that changed significantly during the course of RVI by AUC test are highlighted
  in dark pink (upregulated) or green (downregulated).
