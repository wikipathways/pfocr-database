caption: Cellular metabolism networks. Glucose is imported from the extracellular
  environment and can generate glycogen stores, be used in the pentose phosphate pathway
  to generate reducing power, or be oxidized during glycolysis to obtain adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate generated from glycolysis can either be partially oxidized
  to lactate to quickly regenerate the consumed nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  (NADH) or translocate into the mitochondria to be completely oxidized thought the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle can also be fueled by fatty acids
  via fatty acid oxidation or glutamine via glutaminolysis. The electrons released
  by glycolysis and the TCA cycle enter into the electron transport chain composed
  of complex I–V (CI–CV) where ATP is generated by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).
