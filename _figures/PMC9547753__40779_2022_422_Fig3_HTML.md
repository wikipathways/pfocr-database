caption: 'Four types of cell death in sepsis. Apoptosis: Apoptosis is activated in
  either the extrinsic or the intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway is triggered
  by the Fas/FasL pathway after infection. The death receptor Fas activates caspase-8
  by binding to the Fas ligand that is expressed on activated T lymphocytes during
  cellular immunity followed by activation of caspase-3 to trigger the execution pathway
  of apoptosis. In the intrinsic pathway, death stimuli including DNA damage and the
  accumulation of misfolded proteins break the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic
  signals mediating mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after which cytochrome
  C is released from mitochondria and forms an apoptosome with Apaf-1. The apoptosome
  activates caspase-9 and finally activates caspase-3. The pro-apoptotic protein Bim
  accelerates apoptosis while the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis.
  Pyroptosis: In the classical pathway, the inflammasome complex activates caspase-1
  upon simulating PAMPs and DAMPs. Caspase-1 promotes the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-1β IL-18 and HMGB1 and then cleaves gasdermin into GSDMD. GSDMD
  aggregates into a pore on the cell membrane. In the non-classical pathway, LPS activates
  caspase-4, caspase-5 and caspase-11 which cleave gasdermin into GSDMD to form the
  pore and drive pyroptosis. Autophagy: Atg 8/12 systems activate the phagophore to
  form the autophagosome. The autophagosome fuses with the lysosome and further form
  an autolysosome. Lysosomal enzymes degrade misfolded proteins and damaged organelles
  in autolysosomes and enter the recycling process. Ferroptosis: Ferroptosis is a
  ROS-dependent form of cell death defined by iron-dependent accumulation and lipid
  peroxides that is resulted from an imbalance between the synthesis of oxidants and
  antioxidants. At the core process, PUFAs and lipids containing PUFAs are particularly
  sensitive to oxidation by enzymes and nonenzymatic processes such as iron-dependent
  Fenton reactions to form lipid hydroperoxides that can produce toxic lipid free
  radicals (e.g., alkoxyl radicals) in the presence of iron. Furthermore, by taking
  protons from neighboring PUFAs, these free radicals might initiate a new round of
  lipid oxidation and spread oxidative damage. GPX4 functions as a phospholipid hydroperoxidase
  in the redox system to reduce phospholipid hydroperoxide production and plays an
  anti-ferroptosis role. The enzyme HO-1 can accelerate the formation of a labile
  iron pool and further promote lipid peroxidation. GSDMD gasdermin-D, LPS lipopolysaccharide,
  Atg autophagy-related gene, ROS reactive oxygen species, PUFA polyunsaturated fatty
  acid, LIP labile iron pool, GPX4 glutathione peroxidase 4, HMGB1 high mobility group
  box 1, IL interleukin. Part of the autophagy was created partially utilizing the
