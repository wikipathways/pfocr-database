caption: Strategies for targeting PDLFs in the treatment of periodontitis. a The synthesis
  of inflammatory factors can be reduced by blocking the sIL-6R signaling pathway
  and inhibiting the autonomous autocrine amplification loop in PDLFs. b The synthesis
  and secretion of inflammatory factors can be reduced by targeting and inhibiting
  the PDLF surface receptor, the postreceptor signaling pathway and epigenetic inheritance.
  c Biomaterials and pharmacological agents can promote the regeneration of inflamed
  periodontal tissues by inducing osteogenic differentiation in PDLFs and cementoblast
  differentiation. The black arrows indicate activation, and the red horizontal lines
  indicate inhibition. IL-6, interleukin-6, sIL-6R soluble interleukin-6 receptor,
