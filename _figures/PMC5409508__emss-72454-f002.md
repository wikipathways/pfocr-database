caption: 'Extrinsic cues can be divided into three general categories: (A) Direct
  application of mechanical forces, such as shear stress and mechanical strain are
  relatively well-characterized examples of how biophysical signals from the microenvironment
  activate specific signaling pathways and alter the epigenetic status. Shear stress
  is transduced through multiple mechanisms, and a few key examples listed here include
  voltage-gated ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and cell adhesion
  molecules such as cadherins and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM).
  These sensors activate classical elements such as the MAPK pathway, which leads
  to the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 and p38 to act on downstream target genes,
  and activation of PI3K and PKA. Mechanical strain sensing involves a myriad of receptor
  tyrosine kinases as well as the Wnt receptor, Frizzled, and an array of integrins.
  These extracellular mediators can activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, which stimulates
  mTOR activity. (B) Conventional biological stimuli include cell-ECM and cell-cell
  interactions, and receptor patterning/clustering. These events exhibit a feedback
  response: the cell receives specific input from one of these effectors, and in turn
  changes the signal by altering the composition or organization of the ECM or responds
  with an additional signal to a neighboring cell and propagating the message into
  something dynamic. Cell-ECM interactions are dominated by integrins at the cell
  surface that exert their effect directly on the nucleus via cytoskeletal filaments.
  Cell-cell interactions act in a similar manner but also include cell adhesion molecules
  such as cadherins. Receptor patterning occurs naturally in the sense that the spatial
  distribution of signaling or adhesion molecules affects cell behavior. In a synthetic
  system, receptors such as Ephrin-B2 can be encouraged to cluster by presenting the
  ligand at varying density along a physically-linked backbone, which stimulates a
  stronger response than a single ligand alone; in this case, Ephrin-B2 stimulates
  the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. (C) Physical material
  properties at the macro, micro and nano scales include surface topography, cell
  adhesion and shape, and substrate stiffness. Topography of the material surface,
  such as the distribution and regularity of nanopit spacing, activates signaling
  pathways such as JNK and Erk1/2 and affects cytoskeletal tension. Cell adhesion
  and shape can be controlled by altering the adhesive sites on a synthetic substrate.
  This effect regulates cell fate decisions in hMSCs through the Rho/ROCK pathway,
  which is necessary for the activity of the YAP and TAZ transcription factors. Finally,
  the physical stiffness of the extracellular substrate heavily influences cell behaviors,
  such as fate decisions, and this signal is also transduced through YAP/TAZ and the
  actin cytoskeleton.'
