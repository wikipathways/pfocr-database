caption: 'G6PD shunts glucose-6-phosphate away from glycolysis and into the oxidative
  arm of the PPP. Transketolase (TKT) and transketolase-like 2 (TKTL2) shunt xylulose-5-phosphate
  back into the glycolytic pathway. Only those glycolytic enzymes that are discussed
  specifically in the text are shown: glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), PGAM1, PKM2,
  and LDHA and LDHB. Also shown are MCT4 and MCT1, which transport lactate out of
  and into cells, respectively.'
