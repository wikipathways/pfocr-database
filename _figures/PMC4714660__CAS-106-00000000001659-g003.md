caption: Myeloid cells responding to adjuvants. Toll‐like receptor 2 (TLR2) response
  is illustrated. Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAM), myeloid‐derived suppressor cells
  (MDSC), and dendritic cells (DC) express TLR2, which senses exogenous and endogenous
  ligands of TLR2. These cells are originated from bone marrow. They are activated
  in response to the ligands through the myeloid differentiation primary response
  gene 88 (MyD88) pathway. MDSC and TAM suppress natural killer (NK) activation and
  CTL proliferation by inducing regulatory T cells (Treg). DCs in tumor turn active
  by recognition of TLR2 ligands to activate NK cells and CTL. Tumor microenvironment
  controls the balance of activation/suppression of immune cells. Tumor cells express
  TLR2, which may support tumor progression in response to TLR2 ligands. BCG, bacillus
  Calmette–Guerin; CWS, cell wall skeleton; Hsp77, heat shock protein 77.
