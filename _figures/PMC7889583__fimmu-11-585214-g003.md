caption: Resistance mechanisms to MDSC immunosuppression. AMPK activation inhibited
  the TLR4/Myd88 pathway as well as STATs and NF-κB pathways to attenuate the immunosuppressive
  function of tumor MDSCs; miR-15 family including miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-195,
  and miR-503, down-regulated the suppressive function of MDSCs and/or Tregs within
  the TME through blocking PD-L1/PD-1 signaling pathway; miR-155 regulated tumor MDSC
  via the repression of SOCS-1 in MDSCs; Nrf2 activation reduced intracellular ROS
  production to abrogate MDSC immunosuppression; DATS, as H2S donors and an activator
  of CSE reduced the number of MDSCs in spleen and blood through the inhibition of
  iNOS expression and NO production; Lnc-C/EBPβ mastered suppressive functions and
  differentiation of MDSCs by binding to C/EBPβ (specifically to the LIP isoform).
  AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; C/EBPs, CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins; miRNA,
  MicroRNA; LncRNAs, long non-coding RNAs; MALAT1, metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma
  transcript 1; DATS, diallyl trisulfide.
