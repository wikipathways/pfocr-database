caption: Identification of neoantigen-reactive T cells from patients with cancer.
  Next-generation sequencing (whole exome and whole transcriptome) is performed on
  tumor and matched normal cells to identify non-synonymous somatic mutations expressed
  by the cancer (left). Next, two approaches that do not rely on predictions of HLA–peptide
  binding can be used to investigate the reactivity of T cells to neoantigens encoded
  by the identified mutations. In the first approach (middle), minigenes encoding
  the mutation flanked by nucleotides encoding 12 amino acids from the wild-type gene
  can be synthesized in tandem to create TMG constructs, which are then cloned into
  an appropriate expression vector. Linking multiple minigenes in tandem allows a
  relatively large number of mutations to be evaluated at once. Plasmids encoding
  TMGs or TMG RNAs transcribed in vitro are then introduced into the appropriate antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs), such as autologous dendritic cells or B cells, through techniques
  such as electroporation or lipid-based transfection, to allow processing and presentation
  of the neoantigens in the context of the patient’s own HLA class I and II molecules.
  T cells derived from tumor (TILs) or from the blood (right) are then co-cultured
  with the antigen-presenting cells expressing the TMGs, and T cell reactivity is
  evaluated by immunological methods such as cytokine ELISPOT or ELISA or the analysis
  of T cell–activation molecules such as CD137 (4–1BB) or CD134 (OX40) by flow cytometry
  (far right). The second approach (bottom) is identical to the first approach, except
  that instead of genetic constructs encoding the mutations, long peptides containing
  the mutant amino acid flanked by 12 amino acids from the wild-type protein are synthesized
  and then pulsed onto antigen-presenting cells, which process and present the mutant
  peptides to T cells. Similar to the minigenes and TMG concept, in this approach,
  a variable number of individual long peptides can be combined to generate peptide
  pools, which increases the throughput of neoantigen screening.
