caption: Model of resistance to MET and MET/MAPK/ERK inhibition in DFCI358. A, At
  baseline, mutant MET in parental DFCI358 cells activates KRAS, which in turn amplifies
  downstream MAPK/ERK signaling resulting in enhanced transcription and release of
  EGFR ligands. B, Upon MET inhibition in parental DFCI358 cells, amplified KRAS sustains
  MAPK/ERK signaling via EGFR-ligand stimulated EGFR and other activated RTKs. C,
  Upon dual MET/MEK inhibition in KRAS amplified NS Control DFCI358 cells, cell viability
  is sustained by the PI3K/AKT pathway activated directly by amplified KRAS. D, With
  KRAS downregulation and MET inhibition in KRAS KD DFCI358 cells, resulting in diminished
  MAPK/ERK signaling, cell viability is sustained by the PI3K/AKT pathway activated
  by RTKs, such as IR/IGF1R, HER2 and EGFR.
