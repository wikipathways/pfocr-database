caption: 'Main extracellular stimuli and intracellular signaling pathways leading
  to astrocyte reactivity in ND. Dysfunctional neurons, activated microglia, and astrocytes
  themselves release a wide range of molecules, which bind specific receptors at the
  astrocyte plasma membrane. These signals activate intracellular pathways such as
  the JAK/STAT3 pathway (in red), the NF-κB pathway (in orange), the CN/NFAT pathway
  (in purple), or the MAPK pathway (in green). The JAK/STAT3 pathway is activated
  by interleukins such as IL-6 or CNTF. Upon cytokine binding, the kinase JAK is activated
  and STAT3 is recruited to the gp-130 receptor. JAK phosphorylates STAT3, which dimerizes
  and translocates to the nucleus, where it binds consensus sequences (STAT responsive
  element, SRE) in the promoter region of its target genes. In astrocytes, the JAK/STAT3
  pathway regulates the transcription of gfap, vimentin, and stat3 itself. STAT3 also
  induces the expression of SOCS3, the endogenous inhibitor of the JAK/STAT3 pathway,
  which mediates an inhibitory feedback loop. The NF-κB pathway is activated by pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. The canonical NF-κB pathway involves the activation
  of the IKK complex by receptor-bound protein kinases, leading to the phosphorylation
  of IκBα, the master inhibitor of NF-κB. Upon phosphorylation, IκBα is polyubiquinated
  and targeted to the proteasome for degradation. The NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 then
  translocate to the nucleus, where they activate the transcription of various target
  genes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and cox2. Like the JAK/STAT3 pathway,
  NF-κB induces the transcription of its own inhibitor, IκBα. The CN/NFAT pathway
  is activated by cytokines such as TNFα or by glutamate. CN is a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase
  with many regulatory effects on the NF-κB pathway depending on the initial trigger
  and cellular context. CN also activates NFAT by dephosphorylation. NFAT binds specific
  promoter sequences and activates the expression of target genes (cox2). The MAPK
  pathway is activated by growth factors and cytokines which initiate a phosphorylation
  cascade. Upon activation, ERK1/2, p38 and c-jun also regulate gene transcription
  through the activation of a specific set of transcription factors (TF). ND are characterized
  by intracellular and/or extracellular depositions of pathologic proteins (such as
  Aβ, Tau, and mHtt, which are shown in blue). In ND, pathological proteins can either
  be endogenously expressed or internalized by astrocytes. They represent “danger
  associated molecular patterns” that bind specific pattern recognition receptors
  (PRR) at the membrane or within astrocytes. These abnormal proteins can interfere
  with intracellular signaling pathways, activating or inhibiting various signaling
  proteins (represented as lightning, see Section Additional levels of Complexity
  and Figure 3). The precise molecular mechanisms involved in astrocytes are mostly
  unknown. These complex signaling cascades strongly affect the astrocyte transcriptome
  and lead to astrocyte reactivity. Abbreviations: NFAT RE, NFAT responsive element;
  GF-R, Growth factor receptor; GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor.'
