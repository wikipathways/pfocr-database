caption: Crosstalk between the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) and the exosomes
  secretion in Parkinson’s disease. (A) The presence of soluble free or exosomes-containing
  α-synuclein (α-syn) derived from Substantia Nigra can be detected in cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) and blood samples from Parkinson’s disease patients, potentially contributing
  to the early disease’s diagnosis and progression monitoring. (B) Overview of the
  autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) and exosomes secretion. In (1), the formation
  of the initial membrane that will originate the double-vesicle autophagosome (2)
  depends on several complex proteins’ actions (shown in different colors). (3) The
  fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes is a final step of the pathway, originating
  the autolysosome (4), where the substrates are finally degraded into their monomeric
  components that can be recycled back to the cytosol (5). Multivesicular bodies (MVB)
  originate the exosomes vesicles, which are secreted by exocytosis and participate
  in the cell-to-cell transmission of α-syn (neurons and glia cells).
