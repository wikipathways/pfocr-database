caption: 'Intranasal NGF for TBI management.Intranasal NGF performs its functions
  by modulating different nervous cell types: microglia (green cells), astrocytes
  (blue cells), and neurons (yellow cell). (A) TrkA challenge by NGF on microglia
  cells (black solid lines) promotes clearance of Aβ peptides reducing Aβ accumulation
  and plaques-mediated cytotoxic effects. Moreover, TrkA/NGF signaling (black solid
  lines) inhibits TLR4-mediated activation of the NF-κB pathway (gray dotted lines),
  thereby downregulating the release of proinflammatory cytokines. (B) NGF-mediated
  activation of p75NTR interferes with astrocyte proliferation by blocking (black
  solid lines) cyclin D1-mediated cell cycle progression to the S phase (gray dotted
  lines). (C) NGF has a pro-angiogenic activity, stimulating the production and the
  release of VEGF. (D) Cell membrane TrkA challenge by NGF promotes upregulation of
  Bcl-2 and downregulation of caspase-3 limiting the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
  (black solid lines). Furthermore, the challenge of TrkA receptors exposed to mitochondrial
  membrane negatively affects Ca2+ mitochondrial entry and ROS production/release.
  (E) NGF signaling limits tau hyper-phosphorylation, inhibiting aggregation in neurofibrillary
  tangles (NFTs). Furthermore, NGF regulates the levels of APP phosphorylation, thus
  controlling APP/TrkA binding, which in turn, by masking the β- and α-secretase cleavage
  sites, limits the formation of Aβ plaques. Black solid lines indicate direct action
  of the receptor challenge by NGF; gray dotted lines show pathways altered by the
  action of NGF. Aβ: Amyloid beta; APP: amyloid precursor protein; Bcl2: B-cell lymphoma
  2; NFT: neurofibrillary tangles; NGF: nerve growth factor; p75NTR: p75 neurotrophin
  receptor; ROS: reactive oxygen species; TLR4: Toll-like receptor 4; TrkA: tropomyosin
  receptor kinase A; VEGF: vascular-endothelial growth factor.'
