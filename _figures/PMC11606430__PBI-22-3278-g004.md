caption: The biochemical pathway represents metabolic changes in chickpea leaves along
  three pod filling stage (i.e. 3 harvesting time points) under well‐watered (WW)
  and drought‐stress (DS) conditions. Metabolic changes are presented as mean relative
  abundance of all chickpea genotypes under each conditions. Values of metabolite
  levels from minimal to maximal are coloured from blue to red
