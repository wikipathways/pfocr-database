caption: 'Macrophage polarization in cartilage tissue. a The phenotype of macrophage
  polarization. Synovial macrophages can be derived from monocytes that originally
  reside in synovial tissue or in the circulation. Evidence suggests that primary
  macrophages (M0) can be activated and differentiate into the M1 phenotype (INF-γ
  and LPS stimulation) and M2 phenotype (IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation). Both M1-polarized
  (subdivided into M1a-c, which promotes the inflammatory response) and M2-polarized
  (subdivided into M2a-d, which suppresses the inflammatory response) macrophages
  can regulate the function of cartilage tissue through the secretion of exosomes
  carrying specific cytokines and chemicals. The conversion of the M2 phenotype into
  the M1 phenotype can effectively delay OA degeneration. b The role of exosomes in
  regulating macrophage polarization in OA. Left: TGF-β1-stimulated BMSC-derived exosomes

  lncRNA MM2P is upregulated in rat macrophage (RAW264.7) cells and blocks SHP2-mediated
  dephosphorylation of STAT3 at Try705, thus promoting the transcription of the SOX9
  gene. Alternatively, MM2P interacts with the RNA-binding protein FUS to stabilize
  SOX9 mRNA. Consequently, the elevated SOX9 mRNA and proteins can be delivered to
  chondrocytes via exosomes to promote cartilage repair. INF-γ interferon-gamma, LPS
