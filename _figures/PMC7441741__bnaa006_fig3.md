caption: 'Tumorigenic mechanism in somatotroph cells. cAMP-associated pathways are
  key for somatotroph tumorigenesis. GHRH released by the hypothalamus interacts with
  its receptor (GHRH-R) on the somatotroph cell membrane to increase activation of
  adenylyl cyclase through Gαs. Consequent increased cAMP production leads to the
  dissociation of the regulatory subunits (R) of protein kinase A (PKA) from the catalytic
  subunits (C), which then translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate CREB (cAMP
  response element) and other targets, eventually leading to increased GH expression
  and cell proliferation. Mosaic (McCune-Albright syndrome) or somatic activating
  mutations in GNAS (coding for Gαs) lead to upregulation of the cAMP pathway. In
  Carney complex, increased PKA activity, either due to the inhibitory action of the
  regulatory subunit PRKAR1A, or increased catalytic subunit activity (PRKACB) leads
  to tumorigenesis. Loss of AIP has been shown to increase cAMP signaling through
  () decreased expression of the G inhibitory protein Gαi-2, which mediates the inhibitory
  effects of somatostatin (SS) on adenylyl cyclase. AIP deficiency is associated with
