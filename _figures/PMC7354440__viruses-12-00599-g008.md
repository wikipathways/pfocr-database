caption: PEDV nsp15 antagonizes host antiviral response by degradating the RNA levels
  of TBK1 and IRF3. During PEDV infection, the RNA transcriptional levels of TBK1
  and IRF3 were degraded by viral encoded nsp15 protein in an endoribonuclease activity
  dependent manner, resulting in reduction of endogenous TBK1 and IRF3. The decreased
  TBK1 and IRF3, two key effectors during IFN signaling pathway, circumvent IFN production
  and IFN mediated antiviral response.
