caption: Metabolic prediction for the community of MAGs from TVG metagenomes. The
  abundance of peptidases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes was calculated by considering
  the MAG completeness and taking the average for all MAGs within an individual microbial
  group (0 digits were used after the decimal point). The presence of a specific pathway/function
  within each microbial group was assigned when the pathway/function was present in
  any MAG within this microbial group. The Fe uptake pathway was predicted by use
  of the previously established database. For the metabolic prediction of N and S
  cycling, C1 oxidation, and C fixation, only the major microbial groups (with at
  least one MAG from the group having over 15× genome coverage) are represented.
