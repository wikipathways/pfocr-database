caption: Model for HRPII recognition by human brain endothelial cells and the intracellular
  pathway that leads to BBB leakage. () HRPII binds to an as-yet-unidentified receptor
  () and may be internalized (). Inflammasome adaptor proteins (likely ASC/CARD) associate
  with this endosome () and recruit procaspase-1 (Pro-casp-1), which is auto-catalytically
  activated (). Active caspase-1 can cleave pro-IL-1 into its mature form (). Mature
  IL-1β is secreted (), such that it can then bind to the IL-1 receptor, IL-1R ().
  Signaling through MyD88, IL-1R activates NFκB (), as does downstream signaling from
  the inflammasome (). NFκB mediates transcription of inflammatory genes (), resulting
  in a redistribution of tight junction and adherens junction proteins and a compromised
  blood-brain barrier (), as well as in an increase in levels of surface adhesion
  molecules ().
