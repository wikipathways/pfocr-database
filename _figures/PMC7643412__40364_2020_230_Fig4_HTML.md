caption: The crosstalk between ferroptosis and apoptosis, necroptosis, autophagy-dependent
  cell death and pyroptosis. a.The crosstalk between ferroptosis and apoptosis. Starvation
  and treatment of gallic acid and irradiation lead to upregulated ROS, and ROS in
  turn induces apoptosis and ferroptosis (via lipid ROS). ROS is decreased by TRIP-Br1,
  which is inhibited by the PI3K/Akt pathway. PUFAs induce ferroptosis in the form
  of lipid ROS, as well as apoptosis via the PPARγ/SDC-1 pathway. The lipid ROS is
  reduced by GPX4 and GSH, which are inhibited by DT in danshen and PEITC, respectively.
  DT and PEITC also induce apoptosis. P53 induces ferroptosis by inhibiting SLC7A11
  and apoptosis by regulating genes such as BAX, APAF-1, PUMA, p53AIP1, PIDD and NOXA.
  b. Cystine starvation induces a decrease in GSH and subsequent increase in intracellular
  ROS, which triggers ferroptosis. The increased ROS also induces necroptosis via
  the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway. TRIP-Br1 suppresses ferroptosis and necroptosis by
  inhibiting ROS production. In addition, MLKL upregulates CHAC1 via the GCN2/eIF2α/ATF4
  pathway, and CHAC1 decreases the level of GSH. Upregulated RIPK3 causes breast cancer
  cells to rely on cystine and undergo necroptosis and ferroptosis upon cystine deprivation.
  c. Siramesine and lapatinib induce both ferroptosis and autophagy by upregulating
  cellular ROS. d DHA triggers both ferroptosis and pyroptosis in breast cancer cells.
