caption: 'TNF-induced and ROS-dependent events in target cells: the role of JNK activation
  in mediating cell death. TNF interaction with its type I receptor will generate
  a sequence of events (depicted in Figure 23) that is not designed to lead uniquely
  to cell death [-] and in which ROS may play a crucial role. 1) The interaction between
  TNF and TNFRI is first followed by association with the intracytoplasmic receptor
  tail of the adapter TRADD (TNF-receptor associated death domain), the protein kinase
  RIP1 and TRAF-2 and TRAF-5 (TNF-receptor associated factors 2 and 5); this works
  as a signalling complex that activates NF-κB (through Inhibitor of NF-κB kinase
  (IKK)) and MAPK cascades that regulate the AP-1 transcription factor. Activation
  of NF-κB-binding activity and transcription of dependent genes is potentially pro-survival
  by up-regulating the synthesis of cFLIP (c FLICE inhibitory protein), which can
  inhibit activation of caspase 8/10, the starting point for TNF-mediated induction
  of classic apoptosis. 2) At this point the TRADD/RIP-1/TRAF-2 complex can dissociates
  from the receptor by a still unknown mechanism and bind to FADD (Fas-ligand associated
  death domain) to form another complex leading to recruitment of several molecules
  of pro-caspase 8/10 and to their autocatalytic cleavage, resulting in activation;
  however, this event occurs only in cells having low levels of cFLIP, suggesting
  that apoptosis as well as caspase-independent or necrotic cell death (see later)
  may occur when the preventive pro-survival function of NF-κB fails. When activation
  of caspase 8/10 ocurs, the scenario can still prefigure two alternatives. 3) Activated
  caspase 8/10 may cleave the pro-apoptotic protein Bid (to tBid), which then translocates
  to mitochondria, causing permeabilization of mitochondrial outer membrane, cytochrome
  c release, apoptosome assembly and activation of executioner caspases, leading to
  classic apoptosis. This pro-apoptotic scenario may be amplified by the recruitment
  to TNFRI of FAN (Factor-associated neutral sphingomyelinase), which is able to produce
  sphingosine that, in turn, permeabilizes lysosomal membranes, leading to the release
  of cathepsins. These lysosomal proteases, which can be activated following engagement
  of different death receptors, act as pro-apoptotic proteases able to cleave Bid
  as well as to induce oligomerization of Bax or interact directly with mitochondrial
  outer membrane (note that this pathway, for the sake of clarity, has been omitted
  from Figure 23). It should be noted that in hepatocytes it has been reported that
  generation of ROS following activation of death receptors (by Fas or TNF) is strictly
  dependent on Bid cleavage to tBid and its subsequent translocation to mitochondria
  []. 4) The second alternative is the one more strictly related to ROS and involves
  the crossroads kinase RIP1. RIP1 has multiple crucial roles; it is involved in the
  activation of NF-κB, but may also contribute to apoptosis when cleaved by caspase-8
  to cRIP1 (4a), an event preventing or reducing activation of NF-κB and sustaining
  enhanced interaction between TRADD, FADD and procaspases 8/10. However, it has also
  been described (4b) that the kinase domain of RIP1 is essential to activate JNK,
  which in turn (although this is just one of the JNK-dependent actions) will favour
  TNFRI-related apoptosis and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by eliciting
  cFLIP phosphorylation and degradation. Concerning the involvement of ROS, however,
  RIP1 (reviewed in [,,]) has been shown (5) to be able also to translocate to mitochondria
  (prevented by NF-κB) following TNF stimulation of cells: this event induces mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization and increases release of ROS in the cytoplasm without
  leading to cytochrome c release and apoptosome complex formation. This increased
  TNF-related mitochondrial generation of ROS is crucial because it can lead target
  cells to apoptosis or, more likely, to a necrotic or caspase-independent form of
  cell death: in this latter scenario a significant role is attributed to ROS-mediated
  sustained activation of JNK (6), surely operating in hepatocytes [,], which, as
  we will see (Figure 24), is a crucial crossroads for ROS-related irreversible injury
  of parenchymal cells as elicited by the different aetiologies leading to CLDs. TNF
  (7) may lead to ROS-dependent and JNK-mediated cell death (necrotic type) also by
  involving activation of Nox1: however, this mechanism has been described in fibroblasts
  and, at present, we do not know whether it may apply to hepatocytes or other liver
  cell populations [,].'
