caption: The potential treatments targeting immunosenescence could be classified as
  three aspects. Firstly, rejuvenating HSCs is a promising therapeutic strategy. FMT
  from young mice could enhance intestinal barrier and further reduce inflammatory
  cytokines in aged mice. Antibiotic treatment can also effectively eliminate bacteria
  in the circulation. Moreover, my-HSC depletion, IL-1 inhibitors and pharmacological
  interventions, could promote HSCs self-renewal, increase lymphoid output and suppress
  the release of inflammatory cytokines. Secondly, during early phase of sepsis, treatments
  targeting immunosenescence might suppress excessive inflammation. It is recommended
  to use TLR inhibitors or FASN inhibitors, which suppress TLRs/Mdy88-mediated signaling
  pathways, in order to inhibit accelerated aging of neutrophils. Nanoparticles-containing
  drugs could selectively promote neutrophil apoptosis and prevent the persistent
  existence of aged neutrophils. High-dose simvastatin could enhance the accuracy
  of neutrophil migration and thereby prevent remote organ damage. Since aged neutrophils
  exhibit an enhanced capacity to release NETs, NETs inhibitors can be used to suppress
  inflammation. Moreover, restoring the balance between NAD+ and NADH by using CD38
  inhibitors, NAD+/NMN/CA, and Sirtuin activators, could induce macrophages to exhibit
  an anti-inflammatory phenotype. The upregulation of TREM2 could also suppress the
  senescent pro-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages. The usage of p38 inhibitor
  might inhibit SASP in T cells. Thirdly, it is necessary to prevent immunosuppressive
  state in the late stage of sepsis. Sirtuin inhibitors or the suppression of cGAS-STING
  signaling pathway might restore immune functions of macrophages. Moreover, the downregulation
  of PD-L1 on neutrophils, monocytes or B cells might reduce their interactions with
  T cells, which could inhibit T cell exhaustion and restore adaptive immune functions.
  The usage of IgM-enriched intravenous immunoglobulins and apoptosis inhibitors targeting
  lymphocytes might also improve the prognosis of patients. Finally, thymus regeneration
  or inhibiting the involution or atrophy of thymus can be tested in septic models
  or patients in the future. *Created with BioRender.com
