caption: Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) altered PPARα,γ associated
  pathways. PPARs are known to dimerize with RXR and their roles in metabolism are
  well established. Significant upregulation (FDR ≤ 0.05) of genes within this KEGG
  signaling pathway are highlighted in gradients of blue (THC), green (CBD), or both
  blue and green (both THC and CBD). Note that 1 gene in the data (FABP, logFC = −0.61,
  yellow) set was significantly downregulated for CBD.
