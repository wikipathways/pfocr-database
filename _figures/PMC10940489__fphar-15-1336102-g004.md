caption: (A). Different JAK/STAT3 activators that play important roles in the pathophysiology
  of myocardial fibrosis. (1) TGF-β interacts with its receptor (TGF-βR) on the cell
  surface, initiating receptor kinase activity. This activity leads to JAK phosphorylation
  and subsequent activation of STAT3. However, the precise mechanism underlying this
  process remains to be fully elucidated. (2) IL-6 binds to its specific receptor,
  IL-6R, forming a complex. This complex then associates with the membrane protein
  gp130. Activation of JAKs, which are associated with gp130, is critical for phosphorylating
  specific tyrosine residues on gp130. These residues act as anchoring points for
  STAT3. (3) Ang II and ET-1 engage with the GPCR family, triggering the phosphorylation
  of tyrosine in JAK kinase and consequently activating STAT3. (4) PDGF and VEGF each
  bind to their respective tyrosine kinase receptors. This binding results in the
  phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptors, which can indirectly or transactivate
  JAK, leading to the activation of the STAT3 pathway. Once phosphorylated, STAT3
  dimerizes and moves into the nucleus. In the nucleus, these STAT3 dimers attach
  to specific DNA sequences, enhancing the transcription of genes that are pivotal
  in driving inflammation and fibrosis, including collagen, fibronectin, α-SMA, etc.
  In addition, the activation of STAT3 has the capability to stimulate the expression
  of HIF-1α and enhance the production of ECM in hypoxic environments. (B). Epithelial
  to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The activation of JAK/STAT3 signaling by pathological
  stimuli has the potential to induce a phenotypic transition of epithelial cells
  into mesenchymal cells. These mesenchymal cells exhibit enhanced migration and invasion
  capabilities. (By Figdraw)
