caption: BR signaling involves a cell-surface receptor complex (BRI1/BAK1), a GSK3
  kinase (BIN2), a phosphatase (BSU1) and two homologous transcription factors (BZR1
  and BZR2/BES1). Green and red colors represent positive and negative functional
  roles in BR signaling, respectively. Arrows and bars represent actions of promotion
  and inhibition, respectively. In the absence of BR, BKI1 suppresses BRI1, and BIN2
  phosphorylates and inhibits BZR1 and BZR2/BES1 (not shown). BR binds to the extracellular
  domain of BRI1 to activate its kinase, which leads to disassociation of BKI1 from
  BRI1 and dimerization with and activation of BAK1. Then, through an unknown mechanism,
  the activated receptor kinases inhibit BIN2 or activate BSU1, yielding dephosphorylated
  BZR1 and BZR2/BES1, which directly regulate BR-responsive gene expression. BIN2
  phosphorylation negatively regulates BZR1 by increasing proteasomal degradation
  and BZR2/BES1 by inhibiting DNA binding. The current study shows that BR promotes
  nuclear localization of BZR1 and BZR2/BES1. BIN2 phosphorylation of BZR1 not only
  inhibits its DNA binding but also promotes its binding with 14-3-3 proteins, which
  is required for cytoplasmic retention and efficient inhibition of phosphorylated
  BZR1 in vivo. 14-3-3 proteins also regulate subcellular localization of BZR2/BES1.
  We propose that the large numbers of BIN2-phosphorylation sites in BZR1 and BZR2/BES1
  allow BIN2 to inhibit BZR1/BZR2 through multiple mechanisms, conferring an efficient
  control of gene expression and plant growth by BR signaling.
