  images obtained at a lateral resolution of 100 μm. The data for CDP-choline (m/z
  527.069, scaled to 50% of maximum intensity), α-GPC (m/z 258.109, scaled to 100%
  of maximum intensity), and betaine (m/z 156.042, scaled to 100% of maximum intensity)
  are normalized to the RMS of all data points, whereas ACh (m/z 146.118, scaled to
  60% of maximum intensity) is normalized to its internal standard.
