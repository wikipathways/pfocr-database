caption: TLR9 has been proposed to signal through two independent cascades, (A) the
  canonical inflammatory pathway and (B) the non-canonical stress tolerance pathway.
  Signaling is initiated by TLR9 recognition of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides. In
  the canonical inflammatory pathway, this recognitions occurs after TLR9 trafficking
  to endolysosomes. In the non-canonical stress tolerance pathway, this recognition
  occurs after retrograde transport of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides to the endoplasmic
  reticulum where unstimulated TLR9 resides.
