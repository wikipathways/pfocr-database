caption: Rationale for the problematic role of β2 adrenergic agonists in clinical
  trials. Schematic representation of the mechanisms by which interleukin-8 (IL-8)/cytokine-induced
  neutrophil chemokine (CINC)-1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 have a synergistic
  inhibitory effect on the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) signaling pathway in type
  II alveolar (ATII) cells. IL-8/CINC-1 and TGF-β1 cause the activation of different
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) isoforms. However, IL-8/CINC-1 but not TGF-β1 phosphorylates
  G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) via a protein kinase C-zeta (PKC-ζ)-dependent
  mechanism explaining why the blockade of IL-8/CINC-1 prevents the TGF- β1-mediated
  inhibition of the β2AR signaling pathway in ATII cells. This results in the translocation
  of the protein complex GRK2 and PI3K to the cell membrane. This protein complex
  causes phosphorylation at the Ser355 heterologous desensitization and downregulation
  of the β2AR in ATII cells. IL-8/CINC-1 and TGF-β1 then prevent the activation of
  3′-5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway that
  upregulates the vectorial fluid transport across the alveolar epithelium via phosphorylation
  and increased expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
  (CFTR) at the plasma membrane of ATII cells. The solid lines indicate the pathways
  stimulated by IL-8/CINC-1 and the dashed lines indicate the pathways inhibited by
  these mediators ().
