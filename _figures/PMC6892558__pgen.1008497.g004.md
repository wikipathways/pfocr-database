caption: 'The pattern of the presence/absence of the assigned LPS glycosyltransferase
  genes in 65 strains with well-assembled LPS genes. Based on the polymorphism of
  the carboxy-terminal half of the enzyme, 5 HP1105 alleles are distinguished. The
  locus JHP0562-0563 contains one or two glycosyltransferase genes among the three
  possible ones (1 to 3) with the amino-terminal modules (n1 to n3) and the carboxy-terminal
  counterparts (c1 to c3). The glycosyltransferases responsible for synthesis of core-Trio-Glc
  and distal Lewis antigens are conserved amongst H. pylori strains; the glycosyltransferases
  responsible for synthesis of the intervening region between the core-Trio-Glc and
  the distal Lewis antigens vary substantially among H. pylori populations: both HP1283
  and HP1578 are absent in all studied hspEastAsia strains exhibiting JHP0562 (n1c1)
  and two copies of HP1105 alleles (highlighted in green box). In contrast, strains
  harbouring the HP1283/HP1578 usually contain only one copy of HP1105 (mostly allele
  1) and lack JHP0562 (n1c1) (highlighted in black box).'
