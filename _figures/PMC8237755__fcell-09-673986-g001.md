caption: Pathways controlling the glia-glioma transformation. The scheme represents
  some of the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of the role of WIP in
  gliomas. WIP drives a mechanism that stimulates growth signals, promoting YAP/TAZ
  and β-catenin stability in a Hippo-independent fashion, and allows cells to coordinate
  processes such as proliferation, stemness, and invasiveness, which are key factors
  in cancer progression. When gliomas were grown in a defined medium containing EGF
  and FGF as growth factors, PI3K inhibition or Akt knockdown reduced their proliferation.
  WIP is overexpressed in gliomas and its downregulation decreased YAP/TAZ levels
  and their targets (such as CTGF or CYR61), in parallel with a reduction in proliferation
  and stem markers such as nestin. The effect of WIP reduction was compensated, at
  least in part, by over-expression of Rac or PAK. Some elements of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1
  pathway and the connection of Akt with WIP and YAP/TAZ, are represented in this
  scheme.
