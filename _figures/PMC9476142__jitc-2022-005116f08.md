caption: A schematic diagram of CDK1-mediated PD-1 and FBW7 interaction and their
  underlying implications for antitumor immunity. The PD-1 protein is primarily expressed
  in the cell membrane and FBW7 is expressed in the nucleus of immune cells. In the
  FBW7 OFF condition, PD-1 phosphorylation is suppressed by the CDK1 inhibitor and
  it could not undergo nucleus translocation. Thus, the PD-1 protein constitutively
  expresses in immune cells, which in return activates the PD-1/PD-L1 immune suppressive
  pathway and inhibits CTLs infiltration. Tumors harboring the FBW7low/PD-1high feature
  manifest as ‘cold tumor’ and are not sensitive to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy. In
  contrast, the CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of PD-1 protein at Ser261 residue triggers
  a rapid movement into the nucleus, where PD-1 binds to FBW7 and undergoes ubiquitination
  and destruction. Overexpression of FBW7 could enhance this interaction, as a consequence,
  leading to the suppression of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling (FBW7 ON). The CD8+CTLs infiltrates
  the FBW7high/PD-1low ‘hot tumor’, which confers increased responsiveness to anti-PD-1
  immunotherapy. CTLs, cytotoxic lymphocytes; FBW7, F-box and WD repeat domain containing
  7.
