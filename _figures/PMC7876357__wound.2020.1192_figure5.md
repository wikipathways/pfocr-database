caption: Model illustrating TLR4-dependent signaling events that impact the expression
  of inflammatory and profibrotic genes. EDA stimulation of TLR4 signaling, perhaps
  in cooperation with the α4β1 integrin, engages the MyD88 adaptor protein pathway
  mobilizing TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), also known as MAP3K7. TAK1, in turn,
  activates NF-κB resulting in the NF-κB-mediated downregulation of Bambi,, enhancing
  thereby TGF-β signaling while increasing NF-κB(p50/p65)-dependent transcription
  of inflammatory genes. Bambi suppression, particularly in the context of increased
  TGF-β synthesis and/or release enhances TGF-βR-dependent SMAD2/3 phosphorylation
  while increasing the cellular levels of ROS. ROS signaling stimulates ATM-induced
  p53 phosphorylation, src kinase transactivation of the EGFR at Y845 and src-dependent
  phosphorylation of caveolin-1 at the Y14 site. EGFR-activated ERK1/2 and TAK1-stimulated
  MAPKs target transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB, USF, AP-1) and chromatin remodeling
  proteins (e.g., CB/p300) that cooperate with SMADs and p53 to influence expression
  of a genomic proinflammatory/profibrotic program. TGF-β1 also activates the RhoA/ROCK
  pathway, likely by promoting src kinase-induced caveolin-1 Y14 phosphorylation and
  Rho-GTP loading that downregulates both PTEN and PPM1A levels contributing to the
  persistence of SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and transcription of profibrotic genes. ROS,
  reactive oxygen species.
