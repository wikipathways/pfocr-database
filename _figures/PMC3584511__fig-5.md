caption: Metabolic enzymes with SSB sites were identified within the biosynthetic
  pathways for methionine, Cys, chorismate, thiamine, GMP, and queuosine. The translation
  and protein quality control machinery is another target of S-bacillithiolation.
  The schematics of the metabolic pathways refer to the annotated genes of B. subtilis
  modified from the SubtiPathways database (http://subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/subtipathways.html),
  and possible inhibitory steps in these pathways are shown by the identified S-bacillithiolated
  proteins SerA, PpaC, MetE, YxjG, MetI, LuxS (Met, Cys biosynthesis); AroA, AroE
  (Chorismate biosynthesis); ThiG, ThiM (Thiamine biosynthesis); GuaB and QueF (GMP,
  queuosine biosynthesis). The schematic for queuosine biosynthesis is adapted from
  (), and the Met and Cys biosynthesis pathway is from (). Cys, cysteine; GMP, guanosine
  5′-phosphate. (To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the
