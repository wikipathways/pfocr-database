caption: Non-canonical regulation of HIF-1α stability. Factors promoting pseudonormoxia
  and pseudohypoxia are indicated in red and green, respectively. (A) Prolyl hydroxylase
  (PHD) activity may be blocked by accumulation of Krebs cycle metabolites succinate
  and fumarate, whereas αKG, and co-factors ascorbate and iron, boost PHDs activity
  regardless of oxygen levels. Activation of any factor promoting pVHL downregulation
  in normoxia will also lead to pseudohypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α. Finally, posttranslational
  modifications, such as methylation by SET7/9, or interactions with proteins, such
  as receptor of activated protein C kinase (RACK1) and HSP90, may regulate PHD accessibility
  to HIF-1α and promote or block hydroxylation regardless of oxygen concentrations.
  (B) Severe damage or inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes
  I, III, IV, or V, reduces oxygen consumption, which in turn may increase intracellular
  oxygen concentrations and cause pseudonormoxia. (C) MDM2 is an ubiquitine ligase,
  which promotes HIF-1α degradation in hypoxic environment when associated with tumor
  suppressor proteins. (D) Proteasome-independent HIF-1α degradation via chaperone-mediated
  autophagy is mediated by HSC70. (E) PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis is the major pathway involved
  in promoting HIF1A transcription and translation, regardless of oxygen concentrations
  and upon numerous protumorigenic stimuli. For example, elevated reactive oxygen
  species concentrations were shown to promote HIF1A transcription and translation
  via Akt signaling. On the other hand, conditions counteracting mTOR pathway, such
  as nutrient starvation, and possibly adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation,
  may lead to HIF-1α downregulation.
