caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of BMP6 signaling pathway
  regulated by PSMD14-ALK2 axis in colorectal cancers. ALK2 type I receptor is polyubiquitinated
  by E3 ligase Smurf1 and subsequently degraded in the absence of BMP6. Upon treatment
  of BMP6, PSMD14 binds to ALK2 protein and deubiquitinates the K48-linked polyubiquitin
  chains of ALK2 protein, resulting in the increase of ALK2 stability and thus leads
  to the initiation of BMP6 signaling pathway. This initiation of BMP6 signaling pathway
  facilitates tumor growth, cancer stemness and chemoresistance in colorectal cancers.

  through stabilizing the ALK2 receptor in the initiation of BMP6 signaling pathway.
