caption: H2AX is phosphorylated by members of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)
  family; which one is involved depends on the type of genotoxic stress (). While
  ATM and ATR are primarily involved in H2AX phosphorylation following IR and replication
  stress respectively, DNA-PK and JNK-1 were shown to be responsible for γH2AX formation
  during apoptosis (, ). γH2AX foci are known to be involved in the recruitment and
  stabilization of DDR proteins including Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1 (the MRN complex), MDC1,
  53BP1, BRCA1, ATM, and RNF8 (, -). DSB repair is performed by the homologous recombination
  (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways. HR, driven by the BRCA2, RAD51
  and RAD52/54 genes, is the more accurate because it utilizes a homologous DNA segment
  to act as a template for the damaged DNA region. Repair is also performed by sister
  chromatid-dependent recombination repair via cohesin recruitment (, ). In contrast,
  NHEJ is faster, does not require a homologous DNA segment, and can operate in non-replicating
  cells. However, it is error-prone. The classical effectors of NHEJ are the end-binding
  proteins Ku70/80, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), the nuclease Artemis,
  the scaffolding protein XRCC4 and ligase IV. Recently, a slow DNA-PK-independent
  NHEJ pathway involving PARP1, histone H1, XRCC1 and ligase III has been proposed
  (, ). The γH2AX foci are also involved in chromatin alteration via recruitment of
  remodeling complexes and in signal transduction (accrued ATM activation, G2/M cell
  cycle checkpoint). In addition, γH2AX foci, through their recruitment of the cohesions
  and the MRN complexes, are involved in binding and tethering the broken DNA ends
  may help prevent the dissociation of the broken chromosome ends ().
