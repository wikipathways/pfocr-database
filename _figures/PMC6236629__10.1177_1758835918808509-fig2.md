caption: 'CDK4/6, PARP and PI3K pathways inhibition by SMIs.(a) Inhibition of CDK4/6
  by SMIs (e.g. palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib) through interaction with
  CDK4/6 and cyclin D1 activities are inhibited and hence suppressing phosphorylation
  of Rb, where E2F remains bound as an inactive complex and unable to activate the
  expression of genes that favor cell cycle progression. (b) The single-strand break
  in DNA recruits the PARP enzyme for DNA repair, and failure in repair can result
  in double-strand breaks during DNA replication. Thus, PARP inhibition by SMIs (e.g.
  olaparib, veliparib and talazoparib) induces DNA damage (cell death) through synthetic
  lethality with BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer cells. (c) Inhibition of the PI3K pathway
  by SMIs (e.g. buparlisib and alpelisib) blocks the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and inhibits its conversion into phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
  (PIP3), hindering the outcomes of the AKT pathway in protein synthesis and cell
  growth.Key: direct positive regulation; indirect positive regulation; direct inhibition;  inhibited
  regulation.CDK4/6, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6; PARP, poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose)
  polymerase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; SMI, small molecule inhibitor.'
