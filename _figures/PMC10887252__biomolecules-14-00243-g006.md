caption: Pro-oncogenic and anti-oncogenic roles of JNK signaling in cancers. (A) The
  JNK signaling plays a dual role in the occurrence and progression of different kinds
  of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, multiple myeloma, prostate cancer,
  and oral cancer. (B) JNK signaling promotes the progression of glioblastoma and
  non-small-cell lung cancer. (C) Deficiency or inhibition of different JNKs promotes
  tumor formation in breast cancer, intestinal tumors, and papilloma. (D) Inhibition
  of the JNK pathway suppresses the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer, skin cancer,
  and Burkitt lymphoma. Activation indicates sustained activation of the JNK pathway;
  inactivation represents deficiency of JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, or compound deficiency of
  JNK1 and JNK2; inactivation also indicates inhibition of JNK activity by JNK inhibitors
  such as SP600125
