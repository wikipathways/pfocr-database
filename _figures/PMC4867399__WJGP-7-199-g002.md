caption: 'Illustrated summary of Hedgehog pathway and its effetcs at different stages
  in the formation and progression of ductal pancreatic carcinoma. Stromal cells secrete
  CXCL12 that binds to its receptor CXCR4 of ductal pancreatic cancer (DPC) cells
  (paracrine) and of stromal cells themselves (autocrine) resulting in Shh expression.
  Shh, secreted by DPC cells, binds in a paracrine manner Smo on stromal cells of
  the tumor microenvironment ending up in IL-6 secretion, which is known to regulate
  the progression of precursor lesions and tumor formation. For details see chapter
