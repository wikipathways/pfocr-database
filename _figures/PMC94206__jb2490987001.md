caption: 'Metabolic pathway for leucine catabolism in Pseudomonas species (right,
  solid arrows; redrawn from reference ) and possible pathways for leucine-dependent
  acetone formation in Vibrio species (left and right, dashed arrows). Pathways A
  and B are discussed in the text. The isopropyl moiety of leucine is shown fully
  deuterated to help trace the origin of acetone in each pathway as discussed in the
  text. Abbreviations: HIV, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA;
  IV-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA; α-KIC, α-ketoisocaproic acid; MC-CoA, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA;
  MG-CoA, 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide.'
