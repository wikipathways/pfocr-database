caption: 'The three main types of autophagy. Macroautophagy: schematic representation
  of the sequential steps: initiation/nucleation, phagophore formation, phagophore
  elongation, closure (autophagosome), fusion, and degradation. Under nutrient/energy-rich
  conditions (insulin growth factors, amino acids) MTOR inhibits autophagy initiation
  by regulating the ULK1 complex. In contrast, AMPK activates autophagy in response
  to stress or starvation. CMA: process that degrades substrates containing a KFERQ-motif
  (or CMA-targeting recognition motif). The chaperone HSPA8 forms a complex with other
  co-chaperones (HSP90, HSP40, HSP70-interacting protein/HIP and HSP70-HSP90 organizing
  protein/HOP) that not only acts as a catalyst allowing unfolded proteins to refold,
  but also mediates delivery of proteins to the lysosome via the LAMP2A receptor at
  the lysosomal membrane. Microautophagy: in this process, the cytoplasmic content
  destined for autophagy is directly engulfed into the lysosome following formation
  of an invagination. Abbreviations not described in the text: DFCP1, double FYVE
  domain-containing protein 1; RB1CC1/FIP200, FAK-family interacting protein of 200
  kDa; RER, rough ER; UVRAG, UV resistance-associated gene; WIPI, WD repeat domain
  phosphoinositide-interacting.'
