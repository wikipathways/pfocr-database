caption: Model of OsLecRK5 regulation in the callose synthesis pathway. OsLecRK5 proteins
  dimerize in response to a currently unidentified ligand and are activated by autophosphorylation.
  Active OsLecRK5 then phosphorylates UGP1 to enhance its activity in callose synthesis.
papertitle: Rice LecRK5 phosphorylates a UGPase to regulate callose biosynthesis during
  pollen development.
