caption: AhR signaling pathway. The unliganded AhR resides in the cytoplasm, complexed
  with a dimer of the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), the co-chaperone prostaglandin
  E synthase 3 (p23), and a molecule of hepatitis B Virus X-associated protein 2 (XAP-2).
  Ligand-mediated activation of the AhR results in its nuclear translocation where
  it dissociates from its complex and forms a heterodimer with the aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) that binds to the xenobiotic response element
  (XRE) found in the promoter regions of AhR-regulated genes such as CYP1A1.
