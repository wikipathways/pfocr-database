caption: 'Extrinsic pathway: inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. Extrinsic pathway
  is known as the journey from inflammation to carcinogenesis, which can be interpreted
  in several dimensions. ROS/RNS can directly damage DNA, which may lead to unlock
  of oncogenes and inhibition of cancer suppressor genes. In addition, ROS/RNS can
  oxidize proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and worsen the disturbed
  metabolism. What’s more, intermediate products modified by ROS/RNS also have strong
  oxidative activity to further damage the DNA. With chronic inflammation, the function
  of DNA repair system is likely to be impaired. When DNA damage cannot be repaired
  in time but instead accumulates, genomic instability may occur. If damage persists,
  carcinogenesis will be the destination. In the perspective of host defense, the
  defect of immune barriers will increase the risk of contact with carcinogens or
  other toxins, which also increases the production of ROS/RNS. Furthermore, inflammatory
  pathways like NF-κB and STAT3 are altered through the whole journey to carcinogenesis.
  The dysregulated inflammatory pathways are important accomplices behind the scene.
