caption: Proposed MAPK pathways and their inhibitors involved in EVT dysfunction during
  an inflammatory state. (A) LPS binding to the TLR4 receptor activates a downstream
  signaling cascade resulting in the phosphorylation of specific MAPKs. Phosphorylation
  and subsequent activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and JNK results in the translocation
  of these MAPKs into the nucleus where they activate transcription factors and up-regulate
  the genes responsible for IL-8 and IL-6 cytokine production. Along with the activated
  MAPKs, LPS binding to TLR4 results in the activation of NF-κB which is shown to
  represent the classical pathway of LPS/TLR4 activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine
  production. (B) In the presence of LPS, the activation of TLR4 results in the downstream
  phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 where it crosses into the nucleus, activates
  transcription factors and alters the genes responsible for decreased EVT invasion.
  The LPS-mediated increase in cytokine production and decrease in EVT invasion are
  both initiated by a TLR4-dependent signaling pathway but ultimately alterations
  in specific trophoblast functions occurs through different MAPK signaling mechanisms.
  Specific inhibitors of ERK1/2 (U0126), p38 MAPK (SB 202190) and JNK (SP 600125)
  show points of inhibition within each pathway. Asterisks denote MAPK proteins measured
  in our study by ELISA.
