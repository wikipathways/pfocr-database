caption: Possible role of enolase in MCI, EOAD, and AD. This scheme illustrates an
  alternate role for enolase, in addition to glucose metabolism, in normal and/or
  MCI, EOAD, and AD brain. In this model, up-regulation and membrane integration of
  α-enolase, promotes surface-binding of the tPA/PGn complex, which produces the protease
  plasmin (PLa). Plasmin, in turn, can degrade Aβ peptides associated with the bilayer
  and activate the MAPK/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway, promoting up-regulation of ENO1 transcription,
  and therefore, production of α-enolase. In this way, up-regulation of enolase would
  catalytically amplify an internal signal for cell survival during AD progression.
  Moreover, by complexing with a2M, plasmin may also be involved with Aβ clearance
  from the brain via LRP-1 at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Unfortunately, due to
  significant oxidative modification, it is hypothesized that enolase becomes unable
  to facilitate the initiation of these pathways, which would lead to the augmentation
  of neuronal death in brain of subjects with MCI, EOAD, and AD versus normal aged
  brain.
