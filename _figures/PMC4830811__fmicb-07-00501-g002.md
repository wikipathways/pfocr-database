caption: 'Sphingolipid biosynthesis in fungi. (A) Scheme of fungal sphingolipid biosynthetic
  pathway. Enzymatic steps with reverse reaction shown in brackets are as follows:
  (1) Serine C-palmitoyl transferase; (2) 3-ketosphinganine reductase; (3) Dihydrosphingosine
  kinase [Dihydrosphingosine-1P-phosphatase]; (4) Long-chain base (LCB) phosphate
  lyase; (5) Dihydroceramide synthase; (6) Dihydroceramide C4 desaturase; (7) Ceramidase
  [Ceramide synthase]; (8) Sphingosine kinase [Sphingosine-1P-phosphatase]; (9) Ceramide
  C8 desaturase; (10) Sphingolipid C9 methyltransferase (Smt1); (11) Hexosyl ceramide
  synthase [Hexosyl ceramidase]; (12) Dihydrosphingosine C4-hydroxylase (13) Phytosphingosine
  kinase [Phytosphingosine -1P-phosphatase]; (14) Ceramide synthase [Ceramidase];
  (15) Sphingolipid α-hydroxylase; (16) IPC synthase; (17) IPC mannosyl transferase;
  (18) Inositolphosphotransferase; (19) Inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase
  C. Major sphingoid backbone in fungi is composed of 18 C-atoms (shown in blue) and
  the fatty acyls attached to various sphingolipids comprise of 16–26 C-atoms (shown
  in red). Putative conversion steps of dihydroceramide to phytoceramide and to IPC
  are represented by dashed arrows. (B) Structure of fungal glucosylceramide. Long
  chain sphingoid backbone amide linked to a fatty acyl and linked by β-glycosidic
  bond to a polar head group (glucose) at C1 position. Unique features of fungal glucosylceramide
  are: Δ4 and Δ8 double bonds in the sphingoid backbone (shown in green), 9-methylation
  in the sphingoid backbone (shown in yellow), α-hydroxyl fatty acyl (shown in orange)
  and hydroxyl groups in the hexose moiety (shown in blue). (C) Structure of fungal
  IPC. The distinguished features of IPC’s in fungi are: C3-hydroxylation of sphingoid
  backbone and α-hydroxyl fatty acyl (both shown in orange), phosphate linked inositol
  group (shown in grey). ‘R’ represents 16–24 carbons in the fatty acyl chain.'
