caption: Scheme of putative reactions that generate the major early-eluting metabolites
  of TPT sulfonate observed in mouse plasma. Sequential desulfations form three pairs
  of compounds with a mass difference of 80 (see ). All of these metabolites except
  the m/z 270 were also identified in hepatocyte incubations (B). Diagonal arrows
  represent a possible alternate pathway in which phenyl oxidation precedes sulfhydryl
  oxidation.
