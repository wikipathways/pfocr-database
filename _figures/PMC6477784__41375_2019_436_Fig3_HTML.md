caption: 'The interplay between purinergic signaling and ComC activation during mobilization
  of HSPCs. Pro-mobilizing agents (e.g., G-CSF) activate innate immunity cells (e.g.,
  granulocytes or monocytes) to secrete proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes as well
  as several DAMPs, including ATP, Hmgb1, and S100a9. ATP is a potent activator of
  the inflammasome, which potentiates, through the P2X7 receptor, the release of HMGB1
  and S100a9 from innate immunity cells, and stimulates via P2Y receptors the degranulation
  of neutrophils, which release more PLC-β2 and proteolytic enzymes. In the next step,
  HGMB1 and S100a9 proteins activate the complement cascade (ComC) in the MBL-dependent
  pathway, and PLC-β2 disrupts lipid rafts on the surface of HSPCs, which play a role
  in the retention of HSPCs in BM stem cell niches. Thus, both DAMPs and PLC-β2 promote
  effective mobilization. At the same time, ATP is processed to adenosine by CD39
  and CD73 ectonucleotidases, which inhibits the mobilization process by (i) upregulating
  heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) in HSPCs and
  innate immunity cells and (ii) inhibiting the degranulation of neutrophils. The
  ComC, together with the CoaC, is activated in the MBL-dependent pathway, which releases
  C5 cleavage fragments, which are in turn crucial in inducing the egress of HSPCs
  from BM into PB. Pathways promoting mobilization are shown by red arrows and the
  adenosine inhibitory pathway by a black arrow. There are also indicated three phases
  of mobilization—initiation phase (activation of NRLP3 inflammasome and release of
  DAMPs activating the MBL pathway of ComC), amplification phase (NRLP3 products and
  alternative ComC activation pathway amplify sterile inflammation in BM), and the
  execution phase (ComC cleavage fragments and activation of CoaC permeabilize BM–PB
  barrier to facilitate the egress of HSPCs). (adapted from Adamiak M. et al. Oncotarget,
