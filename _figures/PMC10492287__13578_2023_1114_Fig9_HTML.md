caption: Summary of the metabolic pathway in placental cells. Summary of the metabolism
  in cells and tissue exposed to shear stress. The main glucose transporter GLUT1
  is downregulated, and lower glucose levels in the cells and higher glucose levels
  in the supernatant were observed. Genes involved in the glycolytic pathway, like
  HK2, PFKP and PGK1 are also downregulated in cells treated under flow conditions.
  Products of the glycolytic pathway, like pyruvate and the downstream product lactate
  are upregulated in cells and supernatant exposed to fluidic flow. A second pathway
  was observed, which could handle the energy maintenance in cause of low glucose
  consumption and downregulated glycolysis. Amino acid transporter SLC7A8 is upregulated
  in cells treated under flow conditions, as well as the enzymes GOT1 and GOT2. Product
  from the conversion from cysteine to pyruvate is glutamic acid, which is upregulated
  in cells exposed to shear stress
