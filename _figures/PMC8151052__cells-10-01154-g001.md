caption: 'Simplified overview of FGFR canonical signalling pathways. FGFs bind to
  FGFR inducing receptor dimerisation which then drives the transphosphorylation of
  the tyrosine kinase domain in the intracellular compartment of the cell. The intracellular
  portion of active FGFR is phosphorylated at multiple tyrosine sites. In the C-terminus,
  tyrosine phosphorylation acts as a docking site for molecules containing SH2 domains
  such as PLCγ. Phosphorylation of PLCγ hydrolyses PIP2 to produce DAG and IP3, inducing
  the release of calcium cations and subsequent activation of PKC. In the intracellular
  juxtamembrane region of FGFR, phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of FRS2 which
  then acts as a secondary docking protein to form two independent complexes. One
  complex is FRS2-GRB2-SOS that activates RAS, which in turn activates the MAPK pathway.
  A second complex is FRS2-GRB2-GAB1, which drives the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway.
  Other pathways are also known to be activated by FGFR such as STAT, p38 MAPK, JNK,
  SRC and RSK2 pathways. Collectively, these pathways play multiple roles in cell
  survival, growth, migration, differentiation and metabolism. FGFR signalling is
  regulated by receptor internalisation upon ubiquitination by CBL or by negative
  modulation by different proteins (shown in bold red) such as MKP, SEF and SPRY.
