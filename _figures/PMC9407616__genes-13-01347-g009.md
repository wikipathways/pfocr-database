caption: Network of enriched KEGG pathways and related genes. Red points represented
  the DEGs with an upregulated trend, green points are represented the DEGs with a
  downregulated trend, and gray points represent an enriched KEGG signaling pathway.
  Enriched metabolism-related pathways are shaded by a blue ellipse. Annotations of
  KEGG pathway are in .
