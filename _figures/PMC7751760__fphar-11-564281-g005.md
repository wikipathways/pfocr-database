caption: The cellular pathways regulated by H2S in renal diseases. Starting from the
  right-hand side, H2S suppresses the expressions of PDE5, thereby enhancing the production
  of NO and the activation of cGMP and PKG resulting in the subsequent reduction of
  BP. Simultaneously, PDE5 inhibition facilitates the phosphorylation of AMPK, resulting
  in the inactivation of mTORC1 and the corresponding reduction of matrix production.
  Next, H2S reduces Hcy levels, thereby inducing the dephosphorylation of Akt and
  the downstream activation of FOXO 1 signaling pathway, leading to the reduction
  of apoptosis and matrix production. The deactivation of Akt also triggers the activation
  of GSK3β and inhibition of Fyn leading to the elevation on Nfr2 and consequent rise
  in the antioxidant status. Similarly, H2S attenuates the activation of TGF-β and
  its downstream effectors Smad2/3 resulting in the promotion of anti-inflammatory
  activities. Moreover, H2S prevents the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IKK
  complex, thereby facilitating the inhibition of NF-κB and subsequently reducing
  inflammation. H2S also inhibits TRL4-induced activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and
  NLRP3 pathways resulting in the suppression of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and
  inflammation. H2S, hydrogen sulfide; PDE5, phosphodiesterase type 5; cGMP, cyclic
