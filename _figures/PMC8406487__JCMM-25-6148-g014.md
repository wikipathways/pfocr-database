caption: Six‐shogaol, a small molecule with anti‐proliferative and apoptotic effects.
  The schematic diagram demonstrates major pathways by which 6Sh may confer anti‐leukemic
  effects. 6‐Shogaol may, simultaneously, upregulate the p53 expression levels and
  generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consequently, ROS may inhibit fatty acid
  synthase (FASN) expression and cause DNA damage. FASN suppression, in its turn,
  induces apoptosis and decreases cell growth. Additionally, DNA damage leads to the
  activation of p53, which, as a transcription factor, upregulates the expression
  levels of the apoptotic genes and those involved in the cell‐cycle arrest, including
  PUMA and p21, respectively.  = activation,  = inhibition,  = induction,  = suppression,
