caption: Drosophila insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, a simplified schematic
  representation. The inactive and active states of the pathway are shown on the left
  and right, respectively. The binding of the insulin-like peptides (Ilp1-7) to insulin-like
  receptor (InR) initiates a phosphorylation cascade that results in the regulation
  of metabolism. Chico and Lnk, insulin receptor substrates; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase consisting of two subunits, catalytic Pi3K92E (Dp110) and regulatory Pi3K21B
  (Dp60); PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate; Pten, phosphatase and tensin homolog; Pdk1, 3-phosphoinositide
  dependent protein kinase-1; Akt, protein kinase B (PKB); Foxo, transcription factor
  Forkhead box O; 14-3-3, chaperone proteins. Arrows and bar-headed lines indicate
  activation and inhibition, respectively. Phosphate groups are depicted as solid
  black dots. Protein complexes are encircled by dashed lines. Inactive components
  of the pathway are shown in semi-transparent mode. Effects of mutations, depletion
  or overexpression of protein molecules on adult fly lifespan are color-coded according
  to the legend at the bottom; different simultaneous effects are shown as color gradients
  (for the references, see ).
