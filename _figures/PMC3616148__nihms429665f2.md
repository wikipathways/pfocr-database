caption: Replication forks may inevitably encounter DNA adducts that are not repaired
  (such as a 6–4 photoproduct). These lesions block high fidelity polymerases, potentially
  leading to replication fork stalling, gaps in replicated DNA, and the generation
  of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Current models suggest that replication fork
  stalling uncouples the replicative helicase from normal high fidelity DNA polymerases
  resulting in further unwinding of the double helix and the creation of abnormal
  large stretches of single stranded DNA (ssDNA). These single-stranded, unreplicated
  regions become coated with the ssDNA binding protein Replication protein A (RPA)
  which serves to initiate ATR signaling, as well as recruit the RAD18 E3 ubiquitin
  ligase to trigger the postreplication repair pathway which includes TLS. Together,
  the E3 ubiquitin ligase RAD18 and the RAD6 E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme monoubiquitinate
  PCNA on Lys-164, the latter a homotrimeric protein that functions as an auxiliary
  factor for DNA polymerases. This event is thought to operate as a molecular switch
  from normal DNA replication to the TLS. In this example of the two polymerase model
  for lesion bypass across a 6–4 photoproduct, Polymerase eta (Polη) inserts a nucleotide
  directly opposite the lesion and requires an additional TLS polymerase, such as
  DNA polymerase zeta (Polζ), to extend beyond the insertion. REV1 facilitates the
  exchange from Polη to Polζ which subsequently performs the extension step beyond
  the inserted nucleotide opposite the damaged base. Lesion bypass of DNA adducts
  may be executed with high fidelity or can lead to mutations that promote carcinogenesis.
  The Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex plays an important role localizing REV1 to
  stalled replication forks via interaction with the FA core complex-associated FAAP20
  protein. The deubiquitinase protein USP1 maintains PCNA in a non-ubiquitinated state
  thereby minimizing TLS activity in the cell under normal conditions. USP1 proteins
  levels are reduced following UV exposure thereby shifting the balance towards PCNA
  ubiquitination by RAD18 and RAD6. ELG1 is an alternative component of the replication
  factor C complex (which loads PCNA onto DNA) and associates with the USP1-UAF1 complex
  to down regulate PCNA monubiquitination and TLS. Potential outcomes of TLS activity
  or lack of TLS activity are illustrated.
