caption: Regulatory properties of system A in CHO-K1 cells. Proposed signal transduction
  pathways for the adaptive and osmotic responses of system A (dashed lines). The
  amino acid–dependent up-regulation of system A activity relies on two independent
  pathways, ERK1/2 and JNK. Both are necessary for the adaptive response to occur.
  According to previous data (), hypertonicity triggered an increase in system A activity
  that was consistent with the synthesis of a putative system A–activating protein.
  This pathway is independent of the amino acid–deprivation signal and requires p38
  and CDK2–cyclin complexes for full response, although their precise way of action
  is still unknown.
