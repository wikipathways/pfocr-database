caption: (A) Yeast interactome graph showing high-throughput physical interactions
  (pink links), medium throughput TAP-tag physical interaction data for diverse chaperones
  (gray links), and genetic interactions (green links) amongst the yeast counterparts
  to the twenty-four lost genetic functions. Genetic interactions are based on 108
  separate data sets, while physical interactions, not including the separate TAP-tag
  data set, are based on 103 data sets. The gene nodes are also colored by functional
  category. The largest statistically significant category of enrichment is for “biosynthetic
  process” with an expect value in random sampling of 2.3E-24 (17/27 lost genes).
  The two lost eukaryotic ClpB chaperones encoded by HSP104 and HSP78 interact physically
  with only two of the lost genes, LYS4 and LYS20, which are mitochondrial components
  of the lysine biosynthesis pathway. (B) Gene association analysis shows that Lys4
  and Lys20 make contact with ribosome-associated chaperones (RAC) but no other Hsp70
  and J-domain co-chaperones. Proteins localized to the mitochondria are indicated
  with purple labels. Genes with known roles in protein targeting and import to the
  mitochondria or refolding after import are indicated by asterisks (see key). Genes
  with HSE4 elements in their promoters () are indicated by yellow halos. The edge
  and node color combination is as in (A).
