caption: MAPK, PI3K, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in obesity pathogenesis. MAPK
  signaling pathway includes a three-tiered kinase cascade consisting of MAPK kinase
  kinases (MAPKKKs), MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), and MAPKs. MAPKs such as ERK1/2, JNK,
  and p38 MAPK play complicated roles in adipogenesis and appetite regulation. Activation
  of MAPKs induced adipose tissue inflammation in obesity. MAPKs also cause insulin
  resistance in obesity by inactivating IRS1 directly and PPAR-γ indirectly. MAPKs
  signaling pathway plays diverse roles in adipose tissue browning and thermogenesis.
  PI3K-AKT pathway is closely related to insulin signaling. It increases GLUT4 and
  downregulates GSK3, resulting in insulin effects. PI3K-AKT signaling in lymphoid
  cells reduces adipose tissue inflammation to fight against obesity, while it results
  in the opposite direction in myeloid cells. Besides, PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling negatively
  regulates food intake and has a bidirectional effect on thermogenesis. JAK-STAT
  signaling pathway consists of JAK1, 2, and 3, and STAT family includes STAT1, 2,
  3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6. JAKs cannot only activate STATs, but also MAPKKKs and PI3K.
  JAK-STAT pathway participates in leptin-mediated anorectic effects. In the liver,
  the activation of JAK-STAT signaling is negatively related to the accumulation of
  fat. Notably, there are different impacts from different JAKs and STATs on BAT-related
  thermogenesis
