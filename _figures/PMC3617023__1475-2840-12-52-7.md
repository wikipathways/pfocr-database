caption: Schematic of the NRG-1/ErbB pathway in the normal and diabetic heart. (A)
  Schematic of the NRG-1/ErbB pathway in the normal heart. NRG-1/ErbB activates a
  number of downstream signaling cascades, such as PI3-kinase, AKT, and MDM2. Activation
  of MDM2 causes ubiquitination and resultant degradation of p53 resulting in the
  latency of p53 action. (B) Proposed molecular mechanism of action by which type
  1 DM suppresses the myocardial NRG-1/ErbB pathway. Degradation and decreased expression
  of MDM2 induced by type 1 DM may appreciably reduce the inhibitory effects that
  MDM2 typically has on p53 and as such may represent a potential molecular mechanism
  for diabetes-induced cardiac cell death and associated cardiomyopathy.
