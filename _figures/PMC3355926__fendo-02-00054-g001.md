caption: Activation of the Pi3K/Tor pathway by insulin and glutamate. The relationships
  among the genes described in the text are shown. Proteins shown in red are PI3K/Tor
  pathway inhibitors, and autism is associated with loss of function mutation in these
  genes, whereas the proteins shown in green are PI3K/Tor pathway activators and autism
  is associated with gain of function alterations in these genes. Proteins shown in
  blue represent other pathway activators. For clarity, several molecular intermediates
  are omitted. See Hay and Sonenberg () for a more complete molecular description
  of this pathway.
