caption: A model for the insulin–PKB–TRIM24 signalling pathway in control of hepatic
  lipogenesis via P-bodies. Insulin stimulates phosphorylation of TRIM24 via PKB in
  hepatocytes, which translocates TRIM24 from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Cytosolic
  TRIM24 is targeted to Pparγ-containing P-bodies, where it interacts with P-body
  components such as EDC4 and AGO1/2 and ubiquitinates these proteins to stabilise
  Pparγ mRNA. This pathway promotes lipid accumulation in the liver, and its inhibition
  alleviates diet-induced hepatosteatosis.
