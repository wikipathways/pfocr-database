caption: Catabolic reactions catalyzed by the pca and qui gene products (arrows with
  filled arrowheads). The biosynthetic reactions of the pathway leading to the formation
  of the aromatic amino acids are shown with arrows with empty arrowheads. QuiA, quinate/shikimate
  dehydrogenase; QuiB, dehydroquinate dehydratase; QuiC, dehydroshikimate dehydratase.
