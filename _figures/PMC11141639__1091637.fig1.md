caption: 'Winer et al. demonstrate that gain-of-function (i.e., activating) mutations
  in IL7R and NRAS cooperate to drive T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
  in mice mainly due to the ability to activate MYC, in particular via NRAS-dependent
  up-regulation of MYC protein levels. NRAS likely promotes MYC protein stabilization
  by at least two mechanisms: directly, by phosphorylation of MYC, and indirectly,
  via transcriptional activation of PLK-1, whose increased expression prevents MYC
  proteasomal degradation. Bcl-2 is also up-regulated (essentially due to IL7R-mediated
  signaling), although its exact role in the cooperative oncogenic effects of IL7R
  and NRAS is unclear. The use of a chemical inhibitor of PLK-1 (volasertib) or of
  a drug that down-regulates MYC (and IL7R) transcription (JQ-1) diminishes leukemia
  burden in vivo. Pre-clinical studies evaluating the value of these drugs against
  human T-ALL with IL7R and RAS signaling pathway mutations are warranted. Final version
