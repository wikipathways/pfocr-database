caption: Relevant crosstalk of altered signaling pathways involved in cell death for
  PTC and ATC. Molecules enriched in PTC are depicted in turquoise meanwhile those
  enriched in ATC are depicted in yellow. Notice that both pathways start in both
  intra and extracellular space and also both culminate with the inhibition of caspases.
papertitle: Genome-wide expression analysis suggests a crucial role of dysregulation
  of matrix metalloproteinases pathway in undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma.
