caption: 'Progression of thyroid cancer and the main genetic alterations involved
  in such process. (A) Picture depicting thyroid cancer hystotypes and their causative
  genetic events. PTCs present BRAF (V600E substitution), RAS mutations, and/or RET/PTC
  rearrangements. FTCs display PPARc/Pax8 rearrangements, RAS mutations, and PTEN
  inactivating mutations or deletions. ATCs are characterized by PTEN and CTNNB1 mutations
  and p53 inactivation. (B) Schema shows the key molecular signaling pathways involved
  in thyroid cancer. On the left (inside the circle with dashed blue line): MAPK pathway,
  which is activated in most thyroid cancers after a mutational event. Once thyroid
  cancer development is initiated, gene expression is altered, evoking cell proliferation,
  cell growth, angiogenesis, and loss of differentiation. On the right (inside the
  circle with dashed red line): pathways altered in advanced thyroid cancers, which
  promote tumor progression. This includes the PI3K–mTOR pathway, the p53 tumor suppressor,
  and alterations in the promoter for TERT. miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs are also
  represented inside the nucleus as genetic players in thyroid cancer development.'
