caption: Model of light-stimulated transcriptional responses in MED134. Proton-pumping
  processes and retinal biosynthetic pathway are shown in left, whereas central metabolic
  pathways, such as glycolysis, pentose phosphate cycle, and TCA cycle, are in right.
  The color of arrows and membrane proteins indicate the value of L2/D4 ratio. The
  ratio is calculated based on abundance of reads for each gene normalized by total
  number of protein-encoding reads for each sample. PR, proteorhodopsin; PP, pyrophosphatase;
  SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; Cyt, cytochrome oxidase; NHA, Na+/H+ antiporter.
