caption: 'Antioxidant defense system that regulates ferroptosis. GSH-dependent pathways
  (GSH/GPX4 and MVA) and GSH-independent pathways (FSP1/CoQ10 and DHODH/CoQ10) constitute
  an antioxidant defense system. System xc− composed of SLC3A2 and SLC7A11 is a cystine/glutamate
  antiporter that imports Cys2 into cells with an equal amount of counter-transport
  of glutamate. The Cys2 is oxidized to cysteine (Cys), which contributes to the synthesis
  of GSH in a reaction catalyzed by glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) and glutathione
  synthetase (GSS). Cytosolic and mitochondrial GPX4 (GPX4cyto and GPX4mito) eliminates
  ROS by converting GSH to GSSG. The MVA pathway requires HMGCR as a critical rate-limiting
  enzyme to generate IPP and CoQ10. IPP is involved in the synthesis of GPX4 in the
  presence of Se, while CoQ10 plays an important role in suppressing lipid peroxidation.
  FSP1 repairs lipid peroxidation on the plasma membrane by converting CoQ10 to CoQH2.
  By contrast, DHODH generates CoQH2 by reducing CoQ10 through a uridine-synthesizing
  redox reaction that catalyzes DHO to OA to exert a protective effect on lipid peroxidation
  at the mitochondrial membrane. TYRO3 acts toward anti-ferroptosis by the PI3K/AKT/NRF2
  axis to bolster the activity of GSH/GPX4. Abbreviations: BQR, brequinar sodium;
