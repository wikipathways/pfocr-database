caption: '(A top) Cell: the fate of CD63 illustrates both the earlier distribution
  to the plasma membrane and the later participation into exosomes via two distinctive
  pathways: 1) the secretory pathway from ER → Golgi → PM (brown dashed lines) and
  2) the endocytic pathway from PM endosome MVB → (black dashed lines). Exosome: membrane
  topology of the full-length or its domain-deleted truncates. Tagged peptides as
  targeting moiety (T) or protein drug (D) are indicated. (B) Exosome: Schematic representation
  of experimental design and deletion strategy of CD63. The cutting sites are indicated
  by a scissor sign. (C) Names of the full-length CD63 and its truncates as well as
  their corresponding membrane topology. Circled T (green): targeting peptide on the
  outer surface of exosome. Circled D (red): protein drugs on the inner surface of
  exosome.'
