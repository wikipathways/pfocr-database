caption: Overview of DAMPs activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. The first step in the
  2-step process involves activation and translocation of NFκB into the nucleus to
  regulate the transcription of the oligomerization-like receptor pyrin-domain-containing
  protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome genes. The second step is actuation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  mediated by (a) DAMPs such as biglycan, LMW hyaluronan, uric acid, and Aβ to release
  cathepsin from lysosomal degradation; (b) K+ efflux via P2X7 receptor activation
  by DAMPs such as biglycan, ATP, Aβ, and cathelicidin; and (c) CD44 activation by
  LMW hyaluronan caspase-1 signaling pathway leading to caspase-1 activity and the
  release of mature IL-1β.
