caption: Gene expression (CAMs). (A,B) STRING network—each circle represents one gene,
  and the length of the node represents the level of interaction. (A) Protein–protein
  interaction between genes associated with cell adhesion molecules and (B) protein–protein
  interaction between genes associated with PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint pathways.
  (C) Heatmap of differential expression of genes associated with cell adhesion molecules
  across C57BL/6, Winnie and Winnie-Prolapse mice based on the Z score, hierarchically
  clustered based on Euclidean distance. Top 20 upregulated genes associated with
  cell adhesion molecules in (D) Winnie and (E) Winnie-Prolapse mice. (F) Downregulation
  of genes associated with cell adhesion molecules in Winnie and Winnie-Prolapse mice.
  C57BL/6 mice (C1–C8), Winnie mice (W1–W7), and Winnie-Prolapse mice (WP1–7).
