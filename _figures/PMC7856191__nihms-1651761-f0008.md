caption: Gal-9-dependent B cell adhesion and regulation in the periphery. Human circulating
  B cells, LN-resident na誰ve B cells and LN ECs express an abundance of Gal-9, which
  bind cell surface carbohydrate ligands (a). Gal-9 can bind cell surface ligands
  on intravascular circulating B cells and LN-resident naive B cells in the extracellular
  matrix (ECM) to help bridge B cells to ECs (b). Gal-9 binding to na誰ve B cells not
  only dampens BCR activation via CD45-Lyn-CD22-SHP-1 pathway (), but also globally
  elevates cell survival and immunoregulatory genes, while suppressing cell activation
  and mobility genes (c). Among several immunoregulators induced by Gal-9, SLAMF7
  is upregulated while pro-activation signaling SLAMF7-adapter, EAT-2, is lowered,
  which confers inhibitory pathways. (Adapted from cartoon model in Ref. ()).
