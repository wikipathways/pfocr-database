caption: (A) The production and trafficking of HH protein. The precursor of HH is
  auto-cleaved and HH-N is covalently modified by a cholesterol at the C-terminus;
  then HH-N is further palmitoylated by HHAT on ER membrane. After these processes,
  DISP1, a membrane protein located on the cell surface, facilitates the release of
  HH-N into the extracellular space from the producing cells. Scube2, an extracellular
  protein assists in the trafficking of HH-N in the extracellular space. In the HH
  receiving cells, before binding HH-N, the receptor PTCH1 localizes to the cilia
  and suppress the downstream protein SMO, keeping the GLI transcription factors in
  an inactive form (GLI-R). (B) The HH signal transduction from PTCH1 to SMO. The
  HH binding to PTCH1 relieves the inhibition of PTCH1 to SMO, causing SMO to relocate
  to the cilia. The activated SMO can promote the maturation of GLI to its active
  form (GLI-A). GLI-A enters the nuclei to turn on the HH signal.
