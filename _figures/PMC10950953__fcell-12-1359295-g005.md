caption: Cellular interaction of immune cells and stem cells in the jaw. Immune cells
  and MSCs in the jaw have multiple modes of action, paracrine, signaling pathways,
  ligand and receptor binding, etc. Immune cells produce IL-35, IL-33, OSM, etc.,
  which act on MSCs through paracrine. MSCs can produce CCL2 to polarize macrophages
  towards M2 type, and can also produce EVs to regulate Treg/Th17 balance. Neutrophils
  can recruit MSCs by producing SDF-α
