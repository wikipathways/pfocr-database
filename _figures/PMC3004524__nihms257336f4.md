caption: Model of pri-miRNA processing and localization. In the cotranscriptional
  pri-miRNA processing pathway, the Microprocessor complex, consisting of Drosha,
  DGCR8, and other factors (represented as unlabeled circles, see text for examples),
  is recruited to sites of pri-miRNA synthesis and binds the nascent pri-miRNA. Drosha
  cleavage releases α ~70-nt pre-miRNA hairpin. Grey partial circles represent exonucleases
  that are recruited cotranscriptionally to degrade the 5′ and 3′ sequences flanking
  the former site of the pre-miRNA hairpin. The pre-miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm
  by the Exportin 5-Ran-GTP complex. In the cytoplasm, Dicer, its cofactor TRBP, and
  Ago2 recognize the pre-miRNA,, and Dicer cleavage results in a miRNA:miRNA* duplex.
  The mature miRNA strand is then incorporated into the RISC effector complex, which
  targets an mRNA to regulate its translational output, or stimulates miRNA-mediated
  deadenylation and decay. In the alternate pathway, where either Microprocessor binding
  or action is lacking, nascent pri-miRNAs undergo CPA and are released into the nucleoplasm.
  Unprocessed polyadenylated pri-miRNAs may then be transported to SC35 foci, degraded
  in the nucleoplasm, or processed to pre-miRNAs, but with lower efficiency than those
  processed at transcription sites. In SC35 foci, protein complexes are recycled and
  then released and recruited to sites of active transcription.  Pri-miRNAs that accumulate
  in SC35 foci undergo surveillance and may be retained or degraded within the domain,
  or they may be released into the nucleoplasm, followed by degradation or less efficient
  processing to pre-miRNAs. The inhibitory effects of the ENE and of ribozyme cleavage
  are indicated.
