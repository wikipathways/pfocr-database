caption: The mTORC1 pathway controls cellular metabolism. The mTORC1 signaling pathway
  controls metabolic pathways active in proliferating cells. This schematic shows
  our current understanding of how glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), and glutamine metabolism are interconnected in proliferating
  cells. The mTORC1 pathway participates in this metabolic rewiring by controlling
  the expression of genes (depicted in blue) encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis,
  the PPP, and lipid synthesis. This metabolic control requires the up-regulation
  of c-Myc and HIF1α (glycolysis), and SREBP1 (lipid biosynthesis and the PPP). mTORC1-dependent
  metabolic regulation allows for production of both NADPH and intermediates for macromolecular
  synthesis (depicted in red). c-Myc drives glutamine metabolism, which also supports
  NADH production.
