caption: A simplified overview of carotenoid pathway in cereal and Solanaceae crops.
  The first step in carotenoid biosynthesis is the condensation of two GGPP molecules
  to form phytoene catalysed by PSY, which is the main rate-limiting step in solanaceous
  fruits and cereal grains. Further, the conversion of phytoene to lycopene via sequential
  desaturation and isomerization reactions is catalysed by a set of four enzymes (PDS,
  ZISO, ZDS, and CRTISO). Lycopene is at the branch point of carotenoid synthesis
  since it can be cyclized to ß-carotene or α-carotene by LCYB and LCYE. Downstream,
  the sequential hydroxylation and epoxidation of these carotenes leads to the production
  of diverse xanthophylls (e.g., lutein and zeaxanthin). Regulatory proteins belonging
  to diverse classes of transcription factors are marked with coloured dots. The name
  of the enzymes is detailed in the abbreviation list.
