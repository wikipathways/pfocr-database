caption: 'Schematic diagram of the protective mechanism of dapagliflozin in sepsis-induced
  cardiomyopathy: The SIC model was established by animal experiments. After one week
  of pretreatment with dapagliflozin (10 mg/kg), mice underwent CLP surgery to induce
  SIC, and cardiac function, pathological changes, and overall mechanism changes were
  evaluated 24 h after surgery. Treatment with dapagliflozin significantly improved
  cardiac function, reduced levels of myocardial injury markers, and attenuated histopathological
  damage in SIC mice. Mechanistically, dapagliflozin enhances autophagy, reduces oxidative
  stress and inflammatory response, and restores the balance of energy metabolism
  by regulating key genes (such as Prdm10, Rac2, Myc, Stat3, Mapk3) and activating
  the AMPK signaling pathway. Overall, dapagliflozin exerted cardioprotective effects
  through multiple regulations, ultimately improving myocardial function and reducing
  tissue damage in SIC mice'
