caption: Mechanism of hypomagnesemia in Gitelman syndrome. The expression of TRPM6/7
  decreases in NCC-defective states like Gitelman syndrome. The signaling mechanism
  is thought to involve two major TRPM6/7-regulating pathways, the (1) ACE-cAMP-PKA
  pathway and the (2) Akt-PI3K-RACK1 pathway. NCC inactivation (3, 4) downregulates
  Na-K ATPase activity through the resulting decrease in intracellular sodium. The
  decreased ATPase activity might signal (5) TRPM6 downregulation thus causing hypomagnesemia.
  Similarly, this may have an effect on (6, 7) the apical KV1.1 and therefore TRPM6
  and/or on (8) the putative basolateral NMX protein, CNNM2. (9) A KIR4.1-NCC crosstalk
  facilitated by NEDD4-2 might also exist which could further have an effect on (10)
  Na-K ATPase as the ATPase’ activity is coupled with that of KIR4.1. The proposed
  decrease in KIR4.1 is attributed to the attributed to a possible compensation mechanism
  to decreased intracellular chloride levels. As KIR4.1 provides the necessary voltage
  gradient for the activity of CLC-kb, lowering KIR4.1 activity will (11) reduce ClCkb
  function. Lastly, (12) secreted UMOD is known to affect TRPM6/7 cell surface expression
  by arresting the channel’s endocytosis.
