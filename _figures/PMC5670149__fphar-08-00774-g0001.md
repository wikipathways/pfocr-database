caption: Overview of Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling. Without Wnt ligands, cytoplasmic β-catenin
  is phosphorylated by a destruction complex. Phosphorylated β-catenin is then ubiquitinated
  and destructed by the proteasome ultimately. Once activated, Wnt proteins bind to
  their receptors and induce a series of downstream signaling events which lead to
  the disassembly of the destruction complex, resulting in dephosphorylation of β-catenin.
  Accumulated β-catenin then translocates into the nucleus, where they bind to T cell
  factor (TCF)/Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF) to stimulate the transcription
  of Wnt target genes, including fibrosis-related gene expression, such as Fibronectin,
  Matrix Metallo Proteinases-7 (MMP-7), Twist, and Snail. In addition, Wnt/β-Catenin
  and TGF-β signaling converge at the promoter, where Smads, β-Catenin, and LEF/TCF
  form a complex to coregulate specific genes expression. β-catenin is further stabilized
  in the cytoplasm by the action of TGF-β to signal through phosphatidyl inositol
  3-kinase (PI3K).
