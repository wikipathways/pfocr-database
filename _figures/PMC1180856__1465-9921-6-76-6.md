caption: Schematic depiction of the crosstalk between different phosphodiesterases
  (PDE) and the effects of PDE inhibitors on cGMP and cAMP signaling. Different agonists,
  e.g. prostanoids or nitric oxide (NO) increase the intracellular concentrations
  of the second messengers cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine monophosphate
  (cGMP). Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors stabilize the second messengers and amplify
  the efficacy of the agonists. 8MM-IBMX selectively blocks PDE1 which can hydrolyze
  both cyclic nucleotides. Motapizone inhibits PDE3, which hydrolyzes cAMP and is
  inhibitable by cGMP. Sildenafil blocks PDE5 and PDE1 and can therefore influence
  the cAMP and cGMP pathway. IP-R, prostacyclin receptor; AC, adenylate cyclase; sGC,
  soluble guanylate cyclase; smc, smooth muscle cell; PDE, phosphodiesterase.
