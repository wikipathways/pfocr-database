caption: A model for the XIAP-regulated RhoGDI SUMOylation signaling pathway in modulation
  of cell motility. SUMO-RhoGDI down-regulates Rho GTPase (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42)
  activity. XIAP binds to RhoGDI through its RING domain and inhibits RhoGDI SUMOylation
  at Lys-138, resulting in activation of GTPases, through which XIAP promotes actin
  polymerization and facilitates cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.
