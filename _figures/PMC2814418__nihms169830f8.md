caption: Schematic representation of VDR-dependent and auxiliary pathways that lead

  entering the cell activate p50VDR, as indicated by an asterisk. This results in
  modulation of the activity of genes containing VDREs by the VDR/RXR heterodimers
  and by the activation of differentiation–auxiliary pathways that include the three
  principle MAPK signaling cascades. KSR-1 may amplify the mitogen-activated Raf–MEK–ERK
  pathway, the MAPK cascade upregulated in the initial phase of deltanoid-induced
  monocytic differentiation [,] and may result in phosphorylation of C/EBPβ. The source
  of the activation of JNK and p38 pathways is currently unclear, but it appears that
  the p38 pathway has a negative effect on differentiation. The suggested involvement
  of the transcription factor AP-1 [] and of the cell cycle controlling protein pRb
  [] have not been discussed in this paper. The C/EBPβ appears to be an effector of
  monocytic differentiation, perhaps through a C/EBP element in the promoter of the
  gene encoding CD14, a monocyte-specific protein []. Another monocyte-specific protein,
  MSE, is also upregulated by deltanoids, but the mechanism is still unknown.

  description: Schematic representation of VDR-dependent and auxiliary pathways that
