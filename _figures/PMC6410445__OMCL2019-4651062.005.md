caption: A model for the AA-RCD adaptive pathway due to acid stress. Acid stress triggers
  resistance to AA-RCD through a pathway in which RTG2 does not activate the CIT2
  upregulation, i.e., mitochondrial retrograde response, but it is required for Hog1
  activation which controls the transcriptional upregulation of CTT1, encoding cytosolic
  catalase. The concomitant increase of catalase activity inhibits the ROS-dependent
  pathway causing AA-RCD.
