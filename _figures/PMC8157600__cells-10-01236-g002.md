caption: Mechanisms involved in insulin and hIAPP cosecretion in pancreatic β-cell.
  The most important physiological stimulus of insulin secretion is glucose. Glucose
  is transported inside the cell thanks to GLUT2, entering the Krebs Cycle and glycolysis.
  These processes produced a higher ATP/ADP rate that inhibits ATP-dependent K+ channels,
  depolarizing the membrane. Changes in the potential of membrane open Ca2+ channels,
  introducing Ca2+ into the cell and promoting the release of the insulin into blood
  flow after glucose intake. Not only this pathway releases this hormone, but also
  an increment of AMPc via apetite’s hormones signaling and the activation of PKC,
  due to the adrenergic response. What is more important is that amylin or hIAPP is
  cosecreted in these insulin granules after its maturation in ER.
