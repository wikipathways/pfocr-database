caption: Sources of serine. (A) Serine can be uptaked across cell membranes through
  the transporters SLC7A10/SLC3A2 (in nerve cells) and SLC1A4/SLC1A5 (in other cells).
  (B) Serine can be produced by degradation of serine-containing proteins in the lysosome,
  a process that breaks down proteins which are deactivated or misfolded, such as
  macropinocytosis and autophagy. (C) Serine can be synthesised from glycine via the
  catalysis of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1/2). (D) Serine can be generated
  de novo through serine synthesis pathway (SSP). The 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) produced
  by glycolysis or gluconeogenesis is first catalyzed by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
  (PHGDH) to turn into 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (3-PH), which is combined with a molecule
  of glutamic acid to produce phosphoserine through the work of phosphoserine aminotransferase
  1 (PSAT1), and phosphoserine is finally hydrolyzed into serine by the action of
  phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH). Serine directly binds and promotes allosteric
  activation of the glycolytic enzyme M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), by contrast,
  PHGDH can be inhibited by serine.
