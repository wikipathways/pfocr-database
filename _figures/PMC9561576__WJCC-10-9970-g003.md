caption: 'Principles of immunothrombosis. Monocytes and their microvesicles release
  activated intravascular tissue factor (TF) in response to pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which initiates
  the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. Activated platelets and endothelium secrete
  protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which activates microvesicle-derived TF. Interaction
  between P-selectin on activated platelets and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL)
  on leukocytes enhance recruitment of leukocytes and increase TF production. Neutrophil
  extracellular traps (NETs) provide a scaffold consisting of DNA, histones, and neutrophil
  serine proteases, and they support immunothrombosis through several pathways. (1)
  NETs bind to von Willebrand factor (vWF) and support the recruitment of platelets;
  (2) Histones H3 and H4 on NETs can trigger the activation of platelets; (3) NETs
  bind to TF leading to TF-mediated thrombingeneration through the extrinsic pathway
  (dotted arrow); (4) Neutrophil elastase and other neutrophil serine proteases cleave
  and inactivate anticoagulants, including TF pathway inhibitor and thrombomodulin;
  and (5) NETs can directly activate factor XII (the contact pathway of coagulation)
  mediated by platelet-derived polyphosphates (PolyP). The complement system (specifically
  the activated complement components C3a and C5a) also enhances platelet activation.
