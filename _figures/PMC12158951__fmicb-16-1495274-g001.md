caption: Two main mechanisms of Fn promoting CRC proliferation. CK1, Casein Kinase
  1; GSK-3, Glycogen Synthase Kinase – 3; FZD, Frizzled receptors; Dvl, Dishevelled;
  APC, Adenomatous polyposis coli; CBP, CREB-binding protein; TLR4, Toll-like receptor
  4. (A) FadA on the surface of Fn adheres to E-cadherin on the surface of host cells,
  triggering the Wnt / β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled receptors
  and form complexes with LRP5 / 6 on the cell surface to activate signal transduction.
  Subsequently, Dvl is phosphorylated and activated, leading to the inactivation of
  GSK-3, thereby preventing the degradation of β-catenin. β-catenin accumulates and
  transports into the nucleus, binds to the LEF / TCF transcription factor in the
  nucleus, activates the expression of Wnt target genes, and promotes the proliferation
  of CRC cells. (B) Fn activates the host cell’s TLR4 receptor through its LPS, initiating
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, which leads to an increase in the levels of miR-21.
  The upregulation of miR-21 suppresses the expression of RASA1, thereby relieving
  the suppression of the RAS signaling pathway and resulting in its activation. The
  activated RAS signaling pathway propels the cell cycle into the S phase, promotes
  DNA synthesis, and enhances the proliferation of CRC cells. This figure was drawn
