caption: Ventral hippocampus metabolic networks differentially affected in susceptibility
  vs resilience. Red and blue arrows indicate regulation of metabolite levels observed
  across our datasets in resilient and susceptible animals, respectively. The test
  tube icon represents an alteration observed in serum samples, as these molecules
  are excreted in urine. The hyperactive pathway through these networks experienced
  by susceptible animals is highlighted in blue. Metabolite relationships were derived
  from KEGG database and the IUBMB-Sigma-Nicholson Metabolic Pathways Chart. Solid
  black arrows represent direct metabolic reactions. Yellow boxes represent basic
  cellular functions affected by key metabolites. Molecules that survived FDR correction
  are in bold. Molecules affected by imipramine treatment are italicized. PRPP, phosphoribosyl
  pyrophosphate; GAR, glycinamide ribonucleotide; FGAR, 5′-Phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycineamide;
  AICAR, 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide; IMP, inosine monophosphate;
  IDP, inosine diphosphate; XMP, xanthosine monophosphate; sAMP, succinyl adenosine
  monophosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine
  triphosphate.
