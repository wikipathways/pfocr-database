caption: 'The effect of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 in Alzheimer''s disease (AD). CX3CL1 binds to
  CX3CR1 which is its sole receptor and mainly expressed by microglia: (1) regulating
  introduction of inflammation cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, NO, etc.) and reducing
  neuroinflammation in AD; (2) negatively modulating the function of AMPAR and NR2B,
  increasing GLT activity through the mechanism dependent on A1R, and then decreasing
  the neurotoxicity induced by Glu; (3) stimulating the release of adenosine; adenosine
  then activates A2AR and promotes synaptic facilitation by NMDAR-dependent pathway
  and simultaneity activates A3R and induces synaptic inhibition by Ca2+-dependent
  pathway. TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-alpha; IL-1β: interleukin-1β; IL-6: interleukin-6;
  NO: nitric oxide; A1R: adenosine 1 receptor; A2AR: adenosine A2a receptor; A3R:
  adenosine 3 receptor; GLT: glutamate transporter; LTP: long-term potentiation; CREB:
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein; BNDF: brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor.'
