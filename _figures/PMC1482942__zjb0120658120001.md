caption: Proposed scheme for teichoic acid synthesis in S. aureus. (A) The chemical
  structure for the completed polymer covalently bound to N-acetylmuramic acid is
  depicted. The repeating ribitol-5-phosphate polymer is often replaced by d-alanine
  or glucose (R2 and R3). (B) S. aureus teichoic acid comprises a polymer composed
  of a disaccharide containing N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (filled oval) and N-acetylmannosamine
  (open oval), 3 units of glycerol-3-phosphate (square), and ∼30 repeating ribitol-5-phosphate
  (octagon) units. These polymers are synthesized in a stepwise manner on the cytoplasmic
  face of the cell membrane onto undecaprenyl-phosphate (wavy line). Following synthesis,
  the entire polymer is exported out of the cell and attached to N-acetylmuramic acid
  of peptidoglycan.
