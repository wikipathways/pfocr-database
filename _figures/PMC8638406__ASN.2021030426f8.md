caption: IL-17RC signaling limits CD4+ TH17 pathogenicity in experimental cGN via
  a negative feedback loop. This diagram illustrates the potential role of the pathway
  in renal inflammation. The IL-17RA/IL-17RC complex is highly expressed in renal
  CD4+ TH17 cells and the receptor signaling pathway is activated in these cells in
  experimental cGN. Disruption of the IL-17RC signaling pathway potentiates the production
  of IL-17A and IL-17F, and other TH17-associated cytokines, such as IL-22 and GM-CSF
  (not shown), in CD4+ TH17 cells. These proinflammatory cytokines induce the expression
  and production of chemokines, such as CXCL1 and CXCL5, in the inflamed kidney. This
  is accompanied by the recruitment of pathogenic CXCR2-expressing neutrophils, ultimately
  leading to an exacerbation of experimental cGN, and thus provide a potential mechanistic
  link between the dysregulated IL-17RC feedback loop in TH17 cells and aggravated
  renal tissue injury.
