caption: Microbial modulation. (a) Schematic diagram shows the electron transfer and
  total pathway of semiconductor-engineered microbial system for artificial photosynthesis.
  Dashed line indicates the reducing equivalents are generated outside the cell. Solid
  line indicates reducing equivalents generated by direct electron transport to the
  cell. (b) Schematic diagram of the engineered microbial system illustrates how InP
  nanoparticles assist the generation of NADPH and synthesis of shikimic acid. Panel
