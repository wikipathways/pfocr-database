caption: Noncoding RNAs related to the hedgehog pathway in cancer. The five main components
  of the Hh signaling are Hh, Ptch, Smo, Sufu, and Gli. The ncRNAs introduced in this
  review include circRNA, microRNA, lncRNA and snRNA. This diagram briefly describes
  the interaction between ncRNAs and five core components, with the representatives
  in the pentagram region associated with other Hh-related target genes
