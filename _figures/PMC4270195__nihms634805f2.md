caption: 'Glucose-TOR-E2Fa signaling regulates the G1 to S transition and promotes
  cell cycle initiation in meristems. TOR kinase activated by photosynthesis-derived
  glucose directly phosphorylates E2Fa transcription factor, which leads to the transcriptional
  activation of S1-phase genes involved in DNA replication in root meristems. The
  e2fa mutant shows defects in glucose-activated G1-S phase transition and rapid root
  growth. The glucose-TOR signaling pathway occurs in most cells in the root meristem
  and is distinct from the conventional pathway mediated by plant growth hormones
  or cell-specific transcription factors, which activate the expression of CYCD. Elevated
  CYCD activates CDK, which phosphorylates the RBR suppressor to release E2Fa. CYCD,
  cyclinD; CDK, cyclin-activated protein kinase; EdU, 5-ethyle-2’-deoxyuridine; RAM,
  root apical meristem; RBR: retinoblastoma-related; SAM, shoot apical meristem.'
