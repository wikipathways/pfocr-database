caption: 'Engagement of Cdk5 and mTOR signaling pathways by 5-HT6 receptor and their
  role in neurodevelopmental processes and cognition. Left panel: The 5-HT6 receptor
  constitutively interacts with Cdk5 (and its activator p35), which phosphorylates
  the receptor at Ser350. This enables 5-HT6 receptor to promote neurite growth via
  the activation of the Rho GTPase Cdc42. Cdk5 activity, under the control of 5-HT6
  receptor, also enables migration of pyramidal cortical neurons, likely via the phosphorylation
  of doublecortin (DCX) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). These effects are agonist-independent
  and prevented by inverse agonists. Right panel: The 5-HT6 receptor recruits several
  proteins of the mTOR pathway, including mTOR itself and Raptor, two protein components
  of the mTORC1 complex, neurofibromin (NF1), Vps34, and Rheb. Prefrontal 5-HT6 receptors
  engage mTOR signaling upon agonist stimulation and in rat neurodevelopmental models
  of schizophrenia to compromise social cognition and episodic memory, whereas 5-HT6
  receptor blockade by antagonists or direct mTOR inhibition by rapamycin rescue cognitive
  deficits in these models.'
