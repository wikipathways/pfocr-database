caption: Scopolamine blockade of Ach-M1 receptors located on GABAergic interneurons
  results in disinhibition and a burst of glutamate transmission, activation of AMPA
  receptors, and depolarization of postsynaptic pyramidal neurons. This leads to activation
  of voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCC), which activates release of BDNF and
  the subsequent stimulation of TrkB receptors and the Akt-mTORC1 signaling pathway.
  This pathway controls the translation and synthesis of synaptic proteins, such as
  GluA1 and PSD95, that are required for the formation of new synapses that occur
  and are associated with the rapid antidepressant actions of scopolamine. Administration
  of rapamycin, a selective mTORC1 inhibitor, blocks the antidepressant actions scopolamine.
