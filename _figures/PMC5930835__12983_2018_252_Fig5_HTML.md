caption: 'Simplified schematic diagram of inferred H. euphorbiae carbohydrate metabolism.
  Glycolysis runs down from glycogen degradation towards GAP and is then entirely
  directed into glycerol via Akr. Additionally, sorbitol may be produced from G1P
  originated glucose, though down-regulated FPBase most likely supports the glycerol
  pathway. The PPP is regulated in a way that most metabolites cycle back as GAP towards
  glycerol while providing NADPH reducing power. It is not known whether trehalose
  is produced from glucose at this phase of diapause, even though a TRET1 transcript
  was up-regulated. We presume that indifferently expressed transcripts are potentially
  regulated at the protein level via post-translationally signaling cascades as described
  in the text (details in [, , ]). Alternatively, regulation may have taken place
  in an earlier diapause phase or was too weak or tissue specific to be detected with
  our sampling and sequencing scheme. Protein legend: A1e – aldose-1-epimerase; Akr
