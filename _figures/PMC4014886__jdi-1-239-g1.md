caption: Mechanism of adiponectin stimulation of peroxisome proliferator‐activated
  receptor‐γ coactivator 1α (PGC‐1α)‐dependent signalling. The interaction of adiponectin
  with its receptor AdipoR1 triggers Ca2+ influx in skeletal muscle. The increase
  in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration activates the calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase
  kinase β (CaMKKβ)–CaMK pathway, which in turn upregulates the abundance of PGC‐1α.
  CaMKKβ also contributes to the activation of adenosine monophosphate‐activated protein
  kinase (AMPK), which leads to an increase in the activity of PGC‐1α through SIRT1‐mediated
  deacetylation. The increase in the activity and the abundance of PGC‐1α contribute
  to the upregulation of mitochondria biogenesis and of insulin sensitivity. It is
  not known whether AdipoR1 requires a cofactor to trigger Ca2+ influx.
