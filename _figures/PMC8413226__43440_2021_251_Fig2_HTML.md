caption: Activation of the μ-OR by unbiased and biased agonists. Following an unbiased
  agonist binding to the μ-OR both Gi/o protein- and β-arr2-dependent signaling pathways
  are activated. The conformation changes detach the Gi/oα and Gi/oβγ subunits of
  the heterotrimeric G protein. The Gi/oα subunit inhibits the activity of adenylate
  cyclase, reduces cAMP production, and leads to the activation of downstream signaling
  pathways, while the Gi/oβγ subunit inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC)
  and activates G protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRK) which
  results in hyperpolarization and inhibition of neuronal activity. This pathway is
  thought to mediate analgesia. On the other hand, the β-arr2-dependent pathway has
  been linked with undesirable opioid effects. It is hypothesized that the exclusion
  of this pathway using agonists with G protein bias may diminish opioid side effects,
  while preserving therapeutic ones
