caption: 3, 3′- (3, 5-DCPBC) impacts important regulatory hubs in melanoma progression.
  Summary scheme depicting 3, 3′- (3, 5-DCPBC) targeting EGFR and SRC kinases, AKT/mTOR,
  and RAS/RAF/MAP kinases. Taken together, 3, 3′- (3, 5-DCPBC) shows excellent tyrosine
  kinase and serine kinase inhibiting properties. Most excitingly, it is endowed with
  the potential to target multiple kinases to prevent cellular migration (via SRC),
  proliferation, and protein synthesis (via AKT/mTOR). The Red circular outline indicates
  the post-translationally regulated phosphokinase sites which were found to be significantly
  down-regulated in melanoma cells after 3, 3′- (3, 5-DCPBC) treatment compared to
  controls. The ash-colored circular nodes represent intermediate signaling pathway
  transcription factors whose phosphorylation site was not changed. They are mentioned
  to depict the complete pathways. The yellow, green, and pink phosphorylation sites
  represent tyrosine, threonine, and serine, respectively.
