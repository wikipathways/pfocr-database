caption: a Insulin and adiponectin pathways in healthy subjects. Insulin signaling
  is mediated by its receptor (InsR), in the cell membrane, which triggers two different
  intracellular pathways. The first one is called the metabolic arm; this path is
  dependent on IRS 1/2 and downstream activation of the PI3K-AKT path. This metabolic
  arm, besides its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, possesses anti-apoptotic,
  anti-oxidative stress, and anti-inflammation response. The second arm (mitogenic
  arm) is mediated by MAPK-ERK activation, enhancing cellular growth, proliferation,
  and hypertrophy and evoking a pro-inflammatory response. In addition, insulin also
  induces FOXO1 transcription factor phosphorylation, preventing its nuclear translocation
  and AdipoRs transcriptional repression. Adiponectin is an insulin sensitize molecule
  that triggers the PI3K path through IRS 1/2 activation by its downstream effector
  APPL1. Moreover, adiponectin inhibits NFκ-B response, increases fatty acid oxidation,
  and decreases intracellular ceramide preventing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
  b Insulin pathways in insulin-resistant patients. The first step during insulin
  resistance is downregulation of circulating adiponectin that induces a pro-inflammatory
  response, mediated by NFκ-B, and reduces activation of PI3K-AKT, the metabolic arm
  path. In this case, downregulation of the anti-inflammatory metabolic arm of the
  insulin path favors the activation of the mitogenic and pro-inflammatory arm. In
  turn, downregulation results in nuclear translocation of the unphosphorylated form
  of the FOXO1 transcription factor that represses the transcription of adiponectin
  receptors. The major reduction in the adiponectin pathway increases the intracellular
  level of ceramides, which in turn lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The
  basal pro-inflammatory status of visceral adipose tissue enhances both TNF-α and
  IL-6 activation. TNF-α triggers JNK and IKK activation, part of the upstream NF-κ-B
  path, blocking IRS1/2 signal. The IL-6 signal transduction cascade activation induces
  SOCS3 transcription that also inhibits IRS1/2 activation. Taken together, these
  events drastically inhibit the metabolic anti-inflammatory arm of the insulin path
  decreasing both insulin and adiponectin sensibility in peripheral tissues favoring
  the pro-inflammatory response. ACC acetyl carboxylase, ACO enzyme acyl-CoA oxidase,
