caption: TNFα signaling is mediated by two isoforms of the cytokine and two receptor
  subtypes. sTNFα can interact with TNFR1 to mediate either pro-inflammatory or pro-death
  signaling. Pro-death signaling occurs through recruitment of FADD and RIPK1, which
  can either lead to necroptosis trough RIPK3 and MLKL activation, or apoptosis through
  caspase8 and caspase 3 activation. Pro-inflammatory signaling occurs through TRAF2
  activation of P38, JNK, or ERK MAPKs, or NFκB. Alternatively, tmTNFα can interact
  with TNFR2 to mediate pro-homeostatic or pro-inflammatory signaling through TRAF1,
  cIAPs 1 and 2, and TRAF2. This pathway can be mediated by activation of MAPKs, NFκB,
  or Akt. This figure was made using BioRender.
