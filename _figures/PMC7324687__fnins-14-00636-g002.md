caption: Schematic of dopamine interaction with adenosine and NMDA signaling. (A)
  Dopamine (DA) D2 receptors (D2R) heteromerize with adenosine 2A receptors (A2AR)
  to inhibit their downstream signaling via the cAMP-PKA pathway, impacting gene expression
  such as immediate early genes. (B) Example of DA-mediated enhancement of NMDA receptor
  (NMDA-R) signaling. Activation of the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) activates the cAMP-PKA
  pathway which leads to phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor,
  which is thought to enhance NMDA-dependent calcium influx and therefore downstream
  responses such as ERK phosphorylation and subsequent transcriptional activation.
  On the other hand, heteromerization of D1R or D2R with NMDA receptors inhibits NMDA-mediated
  currents (C).
