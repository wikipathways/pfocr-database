caption: Schematic of signaling crosstalk between androgen receptor and epidermal
  growth factor receptor pathways. Concurrent signaling via androgen receptor with
  the epidermal growth factor receptor (left) leads to cell cycle arrest. Signaling
  via one or the other pathway (right) leads to growth proliferation. p21 is required
  for AR signaling in either situation.
