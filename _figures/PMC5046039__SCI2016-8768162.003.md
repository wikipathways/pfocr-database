caption: 'Bone remodeling: (a) in precursor cell stage, the macrophage-colony stimulating
  factor (M-CSF) binds to its receptor (c-Fms). It promotes survival and proliferation
  of osteoclast precursors, as well as RANK and c-Fos expression. (b) c-Fms pathway:
  M-CSF binds to c-Fms and promotes cell proliferation and survival. It also promotes
  RANK and c-Fos expression as well as NFATc1 autoamplification through AP1. (c) RANK
  pathway: the binding of RANKL to RANK promotes the recruitment of tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which can activate the nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as p38 and Jun N terminal
  kinase (JNK). TRAF6-activated NF-κB induces the expression of NFATc1, an important
  transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis. This NFATc1 expression is also stimulated
  by the nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 2 (NFATc2). Finally, RANK
  also activates the tyrosine kinases Btk and Tec that are involved in the phosphorylation
  of phospholipase Cγ (PLC γ). NF-κB can also stimulate the c-Fos induction. (d) IgLRs
  pathway and calcium signaling: RANK activation leads to phosphorylation of DAP12
  and FcRγ. These molecules are both associated with IgLRs and stimulate Syk. Activated
  Btk/Tec/BLNK/SLP76 complex and Syk will phosphorylate PLC-γ which will mediate the
  calcium release from intracellular stores. Calcium will activate calcineurin phosphatase
  which is involved in NFATC1 autoamplification. It also stimulates C-Fos through
  CaMKIV activation. (e) NFATc1 autoamplification: by these three pathways, AP-1,
  calcineurin and NFATc1 participate in NFATc1 autoamplification. Indeed, AP-1 and
  the continuous calcium signaling are essential for NFATc1 amplification. The NFATc1
  promoter is epigenetically activated through histone acetylation and contains NFAT
  binding sites. Thus, NFATc1 specifically autoregulates its own promoter and is responsible
  for its robust induction. NFATc1 is negatively regulated by other transcription
  factors, such as IRF8, MafB, and Bcl6 that are, in turn, inhibited by Blimp1, a
  transcriptional target of NFATc1.'
