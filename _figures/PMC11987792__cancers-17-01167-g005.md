caption: 'Exosome-mediated platinum drug resistance in breast cancer. Oxaplatin, carboplatin,
  cisplatin, lobaplatin, and nedaplatin are different platinum drugs used to treat
  different cancers. Tumor cell exosomes upregulate p-glycoprotein, which pumps the
  drug out of the cell; miR-423-5p alters the TME; exosomes released by Snail-induced
  EMT inhibit the activity of PTEN and BRCC3, thus downregulating the activity of
  NLRP3; the exosomes derived from SOD1 fibroblasts release miR-3960; this miRNA targets
  the BRSK2-induced phosphorylation of PIMREG by S16, thus inhibiting or decreasing
  the activity of the NF-Kβ signaling pathway—all these mechanisms by exosomes lead
  to cisplatin resistance. Note: Red bar denotes inhibition, downward red arrow denotes
  down-regulation, upward green arrow denotes upregulation'
