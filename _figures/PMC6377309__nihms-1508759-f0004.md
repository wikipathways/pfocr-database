caption: (A). SAMHD1 regulates DNA damage response induced by DNA instability chemicals
  such as CPT, ETO, HU or ionizing radiation (IR). SAMH 1 co-localized with MRN after
  DNA damage induced by IR or CPT in cells. SAMHD1 interacts and recruits CtIP to
  DSB sites to facilitate DNA end resection in HR process. SAMHD1 inhibits DNA damage-induced
  innate immune response. (B). SAMHD1 prevents the release of ssDNA from stalled replication
  forks and inhibits activation of the cGAS-STING-IRF3 pathway, leading to block of
  IFN-I production. SAMHD1 forms foci at replication forks and interacts with nascent
  DNA. SAMHD1 binds RPA and CtIP to promote fork progression and resection. SAMHD1
  acts with MRE11 and promotes its exonuclease activity to accelerate resection at
  forks and DSBs, resulting in degradation of nascent DNA at stalled replication forks.
  SAMHD1 activates the ATR-CHK1 checkpoint for the reboot of CPT-arrested forks. Mutation
  or loss of SAMHD1 increases the accumulation of ssDNA and activate the DNA sensor-dependent
  IFN pathway. ATR, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein; CDK, cyclin-dependent
  kinase; CHK, ATM serine/threonine kinase; CPT, Camptothecin; CtIP, C-terminal binding
  protein 1 interacting protein; CycA, Cyclin A; ETO, etoposide; HR, homologous recombination;
  HU, hydroxyurea; IR, ionizing radiation; MRE11, double-strand break repair protein;
  MRN, a protein complex consisting of MRE11, Rad50 and Nbs1; RECQ1, ATP-dependent
  DNA helicase Q1; RPA, replication protein A.
