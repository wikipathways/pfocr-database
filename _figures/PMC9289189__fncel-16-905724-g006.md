caption: Possible mechanism of nicotine-induced facilitation of MF-GrC LTP. (A) Composition
  of cerebellar cortical microcirculation and the recording diagram of MF-GrC synaptic
  transmission evoked by facial stimulation. The inhibitory inputs of GoC were blocked
  by picrotoxin. (B) 20 Hz facial stimulation induced MF-GrC LTP via the NMDA receptor/NO
  cascade signaling pathway. Insert, representative traces showing the evoked MF-GrC
  synaptic transmission before (pre) and after (post) delivery of 20 Hz stimulation.
  (C) Activation of α4β2 nAChR enhanced Ca2+ influx and facilitated NO generation
  in GrC resulting in an enhancement of MF-GrC LTP expression. Insert, representative
  traces showing the evoked MF-GrC synaptic transmission before (pre) and after (post)
  delivery of 20 Hz stimulation. PC, Purkinje cell; CF, climbing fiber; MF-mossy fiber;
  GoC, Golgi cell; GrC, granule cell; R, recording electrode; NOS, nitric oxide synthase;
  NO, nitric oxide; LTP, long-term potentiation.
