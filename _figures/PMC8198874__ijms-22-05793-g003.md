caption: Summary of Complex GSL Biosynthesis. Ceramide is a major branching point
  in the biosynthetic pathway for several structures, including SM, C1P, and the simple
  GSLs GlcCer and GalCer. Ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG) is responsible for the
  addition of a glucose molecule to ceramide, whereas ceramide galactosyltransferase
  (CGT) adds a galactosyl molecule to ceramide. GalCer can be sialylated by the sialyltransferase
  ST3Gal V to produce GM4. In addition, GalCer may be sulfated by cerebroside sulfotransferase
  to form sulfatide. GlcCer is converted to LacCer by the addition of Gal onto the
  Glc head group. LacCer is another major branching point for complex GSL biosynthesis;
  however, only two synthetic pathways are illustrated above, which are the a- and
  b-series gangliosides (left and right, respectively).
