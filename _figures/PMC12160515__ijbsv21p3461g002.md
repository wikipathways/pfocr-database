caption: Possible signaling pathways in inflammatory-oxidative stress mediated neural
  regeneration. CNS injury induces cytokines to interact with ROS and activation of
  NMDAR leads to calcium efflux, thereby further contributing to intracellular ROS
  accumulation through the action of NOX. Intracellular ROS inactivates PTEN and leads
  to the accumulation of PIP3, which directs Akt to the plasma membrane and promotes
  Akt activation and neurogenesis. In addition, Akt activates p21, thereby disrupting
  the interaction between Nrf2 and its inhibitor Keap1 and promoting Nrf2 stabilization
  for detoxification and neuroprotection against excessive ROS action. RTK are up-regulated
  in response to CNS injury and activate ERK1/2 signaling pathway upon binding to
  BDNF. All of the above events promote neurogenesis, neuroprotection and synaptic
  maturation. Finally, ROS induces JNK p38 MAPK, whose synergistic action is essential
  for debris removal and axonal regeneration. However, high levels of oxidative stress
  can trigger peroxidation and the formation of 4-HNE lipids, which may adversely
  affect nerve regeneration. (BDNF - brain-derived neurotrophic factor; ERK1/2 - extracellular
  signal-regulated protein kinase; 4-HNE - 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; JNK - c-jun N-terminal
  kinase; MAPK - mitogen-activated protein kinases; NMDAR - N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor;
  NOX - NADPH oxidase; Nrf2 - nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2; PI3K - phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PIP2 - phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate; PIP3 - phosphatidylinositol
