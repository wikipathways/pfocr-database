caption: Mechanisms of AIM2 regulation in OSCC, CSCC, GS, and OS independent of inflammasome.
  AIM2 has been shown to play a role in promoting cancer cell proliferation through
  activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, as well as enhancing cancer cell viability
  and inhibiting apoptosis. This ultimately leads to the promotion of cancer cell
  invasion and the development of EMT, thereby contributing to the progression of
  OSCC and CSCC. Conversely, in GS, AIM2 has been found to inhibit cell growth and
  migration by suppressing AKT phosphorylation. Additionally, in OS, AIM2 can inactivate
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, leading to inhibition of proliferation, invasion, and
  migration of osteosarcoma cells, as well as promotion of apoptosis, ultimately hindering
  the progression of OS
