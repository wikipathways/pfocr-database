caption: The involved genes are highlighted in the red color. The lines between genes
  represent known interactions, with solid lines representing direct interactions
  and dashed lines representing indirect interactions. The high scores associated
  with these networks indicate they were highly unlikely to be formed by chance. (A)
  11 out of the top 20 genes for BDH signature are involved with p53 and ERBB2 pathways
  (Network 1, Cancer, Cell Cycle, Cell Death, score of 28), and (B) 17 out of the
  top 20 inflammation signature genes are involved with inflammatory pathway NFκB
  (Network 1, Immune Response, Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction, Connective
  Tissue Disorders, score of 47). (C) 9 of the top 20 genes for the necrosis signature
  are also involved with Immune Response pathway, majorly NFκB complex, and (D) 3
  of the top 20 genes for necrosis are associated with cell death (Network 2, Cancer,
  Cell Death, Cell Cycle, score of 6).
