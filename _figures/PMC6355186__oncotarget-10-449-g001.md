caption: Ceramides result from the breakdown of more complex sphingolipids like sphingomyelins
  and glycosphingolipids or are synthesized de novo from serine and palmitoyl-CoA
  (C16 Cer shown). Ceramidase catalyzes the de-acylation of Ceramide to form sphingosine.
  Sphingosine Kinase phosphorylates sphingosine in an ATP-dependent manner to generate
  S1P. S1P is removed from the sphingolipid metabolism pathway when it is degraded
  by S1P Lyase, yielding precursors for phospholipid synthesis (hexadecenol and phosphoethanolamine).
  Ceramide can be recycled via S1P phosphatase-catalyzed dephosphorylation of S1P
  to reform sphingosine, which is acylated by Ceramide Synthase (CerS) to reform ceramide.
  The chain length of the resulting ceramide depends on the type of CerS that acts
  on sphingosine, e.g. CerS5 produces C16 Cer from sphingosine. C16 Cer promotes cell
  cycle arrest and apoptosis while S1P stimulates pro-survival and pro-proliferative
  signaling cascades.
