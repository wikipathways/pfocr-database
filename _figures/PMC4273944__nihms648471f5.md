caption: (A) The Wsp signal transduction pathway. A TCS used by the Wsp system consists
  of WspE, a CheA-CheY hybrid, and WspR containing a N-terminal REC domain followed
  by a GGDEF module with diguanylate cyclase activity. WspR produces c-di-GMP, which
  in turn promotes biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. (B) The Chp signal transduction
  pathway. Two CheY homologs PilH and PilG differentially regulate the activity of
  an adenylate cyclase (AC), which produces cAMP to control virulence via Vfr, a transcription
  factor belonging to the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) family. The novel kinase ChpA
  contains nine predicted phosphorylatable sites, including six conserved histidines
  located in Hpt domains, and another two located in Hpt-like domains where the conserved
  histidines are substutituted with a threonine and a serine, respectively.
