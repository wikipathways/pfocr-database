caption: —Diagram of the subset of PSGs that are involved with cellular respiration
  in (A) the Krebs cycle or (B) the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. We used information
  from the Genecards and KEGG databases to identify the location where PSG gene products
  act within the pathways. The font color and symbols (*, +, and −) for PSGs indicate
  the elevation category of the species for which the gene was identified. PSG results
  from the multibranch foreground PAML analyses are indicated in bold text.
