caption: VAT immune cell composition and multiple interactive regulatory networks
  in metabolic homeostasis. A variety of tissue-resident innate immune cells are distributed
  in VAT, either interacting with each other or with adipocytes to maintain metabolic
  homeostasis by producing cytokines. The IL-33/ILC2s pathway plays an initial and
  key role in maintaining type II immune state in VAT homeostasis. Eosinophils, M2,
  iNKTs, and Tregs also play a role in maintaining a steady state of VAT. IL-33 is
  considered to be an initial cytokine that induces and sustains the functions of
  ILC2s, eosinophils, M2, and Tregs. IL-10 is the core effector cytokine that maintains
  type II immune response in normal VAT, and almost all the VAT-resident cell types,
  such as eosinophils, M2, iNKTs, and Tregs produce IL-10. The critical role of IL-10
  is to inhibit the production of MCP-1 by adipocytes, thereby reducing the accumulation
  of monocytes in adipose tissue, which prevents their polarization into pro-inflammatory
  M1. IL-10-producing iNKT cells uniquely express the transcription factor E4BP4 that
  controls transcription of the gene encoding IL-10 in Tregs, and differ from conventional
  iNKT cells which express PLZF. APCs, adipose progenitor cells; ASCs, adipose stem
