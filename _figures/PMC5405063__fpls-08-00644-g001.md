caption: Regulation of translation initiation by the (TOR) pathway, eIF4E activity
  and eIF2α phosphorylation in response to developmental and environmental cues in
  plants. Different treatments activate plants’ TOR and GCN2 that promote downstream
  phosphorylation of S6K and eIF2α, respectively. In addition, eIF4E and eIFiso4E
  activity could be also regulated in these organisms, although the possible mechanisms
  involved in this regulation has not been elucidated yet. Despite that these events
  could lead to regulation of translation initiation (based on the information in
  other eukaryotes), in some cases the precise role of these pathways in translational
  control remains unclear in plants. Solid lines highlight experimentally demonstrated
  associations among processes; in contrast, dashed lines represent possible links
  that are missing or unresolved in plants.
