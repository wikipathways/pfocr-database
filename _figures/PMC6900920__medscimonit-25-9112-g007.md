caption: The schematic diagram of the mechanism of the effect of acupuncture in the
  chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model. In the chronic unpredictable
  mild stress (CUMS) rat model, the effect of acupuncture may have been associated
  with the inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, nitric oxide synthase
  (NOS), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and the glutamatergic system, through
  activation of the NO-cGMP signaling pathway.
