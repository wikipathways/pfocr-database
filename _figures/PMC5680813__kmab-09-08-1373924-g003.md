caption: Schematic illustration of the target-mediated drug disposition model. The
  non-target related PK is represented by a two-compartment model (in grey) including
  linear distribution and clearance processes. The dashed compartment represents the
  depot compartment from which the antibodies are absorbed for simulating subcutaneous
  (SC) injection. The liver is represented in the central compartment where the ASGPR
  is expressed at the surface of the hepatocytes. The interaction of the antibodies
  with the receptors results in a nonlinear target-mediated elimination pathway (in
  red). Binding to the ASGPR leads to the complex formation and endocytosis. The receptor
  turn-over is also represented with a synthesis and degradation rate. All parameters
  used in the model are given in brackets.
