caption: The mitohormetic response, involving at least two separate pathways, enabled
  Dahomey to develop faster than Alstonville larvae. First, larvae with Dahomey mtDNA
  ate more, which caused third instar larvae to weigh more. Backup of sugars produced
  increased activity of the polyol pathway and increased N expression. Increased N
  expression blocked CrebB and fed back to increase food consumption. Second, pyruvate
  was metabolised to acetyl-CoA and exported from the mitochondrion for fatty acid
  synthesis and palmitic acid and stearic acid levels increased. The long-chain fatty
  acids were catabolised by β oxidation, resulting in the formation of NADH and FADH2.
  FADH2 shuttled electrons to the quinone pool and partially by-passed ETC complex
  I where the V161L mutation occurred. In contrast, Alstonville larvae upregulated
  glycogen metabolism and activity of the pentose phosphate pathway increased. Increased
  glycogen metabolism increased wandering, which diverted energy away from development.
  Increased insulin signalling decreased larval food consumption.
