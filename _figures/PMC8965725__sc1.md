caption: Schematic depiction of SR717@RGE-HFn NPs with a dual-targeting strategy for
  potent anti-glioma immune response. 3D model of the peptide-fused ferritin subunit
  and self-assembled peptide-HFn NPs were generated using Modellar (v 9.2) simulation
  software. For example, the RGE peptide fused to the ferritin subunit (blue) through
  a GGGT linker peptide was modeled based on the RGE peptide sequence (RGERPPR) and
  wtFH cage structure (PDB 2FHA). The peptide-engineered HFn NPs traverse the BBB
  through TfR1-mediated transcytosis. Once across the BBB, the tumor penetration peptide
  RGE facilitates deep penetration of NPs into the tumor tissue and effective homing
  of STING agonists to the glioma, leading to activation of the STING pathway.
