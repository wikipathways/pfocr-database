caption: 'MEP pathway in B. subtilis. Eight enzymes are involved in the conversion
  of d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate to IPP and DMAPP. These two products
  are precursors for isoprenoid compounds such as carotenoids. Enzymes in the metabolic
  pathway: 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (Dxs), 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate
  reductoisomerase or 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate synthase (Dxr, IspC), 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (IspD), 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  kinase (IspE), 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF), (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate
  synthase (IspG), 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (IspH), and
  isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase (Idi). Intermediates in the metabolic pathway:
  1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP), 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP),
  4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol (CDP-ME), 2-phospho-4-(cytidine
  5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol (CDP-MEP), 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate
  (MEC), (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate (HMBPP), isopentenyl diphosphate
  (IPP), and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)'
