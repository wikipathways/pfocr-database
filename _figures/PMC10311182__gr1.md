caption: Airway remodeling mediated by LIGHT signaling pathway. (A) Schematic of difference
  between normal and asthmatic airway. Immune cells interact with smooth muscle cells
  through LIGHT-LTβR, activating the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway and resulting
  in ASM hypertrophy and hyperplasia. (B) Schematic of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling
  pathway in asthma. Upon LIGHT-LTβR interaction, TRAF2 and TRAF3 are recruited to
  the receptor. Activated TRAF2 degrades TRAF3, which allows the NF-κB inducing kinase
  (NIK) to accumulate. Sequentially, IKKα is induced to phosphorylate and ubiquitinate
  P100, leading to the nuclear translocation of RelB. As a result of the activated
  pathway, several events can occur, which include but are not limited to the hyper-induction
  of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules, ASM cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy,
  and potentially myofibroblast differentiation and asthma exacerbation. The figure
  was created with BioRender.com.
