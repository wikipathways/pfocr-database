caption: 'A possible explanation for the extra- and intracellular origins of resistance
  to AD-O51.4 and TRAIL in SW480 cells. Simplified figure showing the propagation
  of apoptosis signals within cells. Arrows indicate the increased/decreased expression
  of specific proteins observed after acquisition of resistance, *—abundance significantly
  altered (p < 0.05) as shown on . Left panel: decreased abundance of R1 and R2 surface
  receptors together with an increased level of Bcl-2 result in a decreased level
  of Caspase-8 further decreasing Caspase-3 abundance undermining apoptosis. In addition,
  the decreased abundance of HSP60-p53 complex and increased abundance of cIAP-2 are
  observed, which suggests inhibition of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The same
  protein alterations were observed by Rozga et al. []. Right panel: addition of AD-O54.1
  evokes low apoptosis response. Despite an decreased abundance of Caspase-8, increased
  abundance of Caspase-3 is observed leading to weak apoptosis signal propagation.
  The Caspase-8-independent Caspase-3 activation could be explained with the observed
  Fas and FasL increase, furthermore, low BIDlevels preclude mitochondrial pathway
  involvement in Caspase-3 activation.'
