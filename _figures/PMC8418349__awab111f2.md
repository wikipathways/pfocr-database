caption: 'Noradrenaline synthesis pathway, distribution of pre and postsynaptic adrenoreceptors,
  and available noradrenergic agonist and antagonists used in animal and human studies.
  Agonists are depicted by a plus symbol and dark green arrows, whilst antagonists
  are depicted by the letter ‘X’ and orange arrows. Drugs used in human studies and
  clinical trials are marked with an asterisk. Noradrenaline synthesis pathway: noradrenaline
  is synthesized from tyrosine, which is initially converted to l-DOPA through the
  action of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH); l-DOPA is further converted to dopamine by
  aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), before finally being converted to noradrenaline
  through the action of dopamine β-monooxygenase (DA-C; also known as dopamine β-hydroxylase).
  Noradrenaline is recycled through the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and degraded
  by monoamine oxidase (MOA), to the principal end product vanillylmandelic acid or
  a conjugated form of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). Methylphenidate = mixed
  noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor.'
