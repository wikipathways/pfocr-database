caption: Mechanisms involved in the prooncogenic activation of the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway.
  Among the genetic alterations so far described, (a) somatic mutations located within
  specific domains of NRF2 and/or KEAP1 proteins can affect their reciprocal interaction
  or impair the negative control exerted by other regulators of NRF2 stability such
  as Rbx1 and Cul3. Also, (b) genetic deletion of NRF2 exon2 can be responsible for
  impaired NRF2-KEAP1 interaction. In all the cases, NRF2-dependent transcription
  is potentiated. As concerning the epigenetic changes, (a) either hypermethylation
  of the CpG islands in the KEAP1 promoter region, (b) the decreased methylation of
  the CpG islands within the NRF2 promoter, or (c) the inhibition of KEAP1 mRNA translation
  exerted by certain miRNAs can lead to NRF2 hyperactivation. Moreover, (d) enhanced
  NRF2 expression can also occur in response to upstream oncogenic signaling triggered
  by aberrant KRAS and BRAF activation. Also, (g) metabolic changes leading to succinate
  accumulation can promote KEAP1 succinylation and prevent its interaction with NRF2.
  Lastly, increased NRF2 nuclear translocation and transactivation can be induced
  by (h) PI3K-Akt-mediated inhibition of GSK3 or direct interaction with protein regulators
  such as (i) p21, (j) p62, and (k) dpp3.
