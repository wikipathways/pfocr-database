caption: A proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of physalin B in Physalis angulata
  starting from 24-methylenecholesterol. (A) The structures of withanolide C and physalin
  B; (B) Proposed biosynthetic routes to physalin B and brassinolide. Biosyntheses
  of physalin B and brassinolide diverge at the level of 24-methylenecholesterol,
  which is channeled to the production of physalin B through withanolide via 24-methyldesmosterol
  under the activity of 24ISO, or of brassinolide via campesterol, catalyzed by SSR1.
