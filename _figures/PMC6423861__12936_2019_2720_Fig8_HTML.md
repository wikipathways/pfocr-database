caption: Consequences of hypoxanthine deprivation on parasite metabolism, as captured
  in model simulations. These are most clearly delineated in model simulations of
  parasite metabolism during the first 24 h of hypoxanthine deprivation. The simulations
  indicated that the parasite supplies phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to synthesize chorismate,
  which is a precursor for ubiquinone synthesis as part of shikimate synthesis. PEP
  is also utilized to synthesize oxaloacetate (OAA), which in turn leads to enhanced
  porphyrin metabolism. The red arrows indicate the metabolic flow occurring under
  hypoxanthine-deprivation conditions. A dotted arrow indicates more than one reaction
  step. AKG, alpha-ketoglutarate; ETC, electron transport chain; FUM, fumarate; MAL,
