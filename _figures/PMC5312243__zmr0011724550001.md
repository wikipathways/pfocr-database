caption: 'Tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways in prokaryotes. An outline of prokaryotic
  tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways is shown with the conserved three-enzymatic-step
  core path from ALA (5-aminolevulinate) to uroporphyrinogen III boxed in blue. Among
  prokaryotes, one finds one of two generally nonoverlapping paths to ALA. The synthesis
  of ALA from glutamyl-tRNA (5-carbon pathway) is most common, with a limited number
  of bacteria possessing the enzyme AlaS to form ALA from glycine and succinyl-CoA
  (4-carbon pathway). The 4-carbon pathway to ALA is found only in bacteria that possess
  the protoporphyrin-dependent pathway branch. Uroporphyrinogen III is the precursor
  to Ni-containing F430 in methanogens, Co-containing cobalamin, and Fe-containing
  siroheme and heme d1 as well as coproporphyrinogen, which is the common precursor
  of Fe-containing protoheme and Mg-containing chlorophylls. Abbreviations: PBG, porphobilinogen;
  HMB, hydroxymethylbilane; uro''gen III, uroporphyrinogen III.'
