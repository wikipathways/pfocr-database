caption: Model for LMP1-induced canonical and noncanonical NF-κB activation. LMP1
  can induce canonical IKKβ-dependent NF-κB activation through both TRAF-binding (TES1)
  and death domain (DD)-binding (TES2) sites. This pathway depends on IRAK1 and TRAF6
  and is inhibited by dominant negative forms of TAB2 and Ubc13 (). The activation
  of an unknown IKK kinase similar to TAK-1 downstream of TRAF6 is illustrated. All
  LMP1-induced NF-κB activation is IKKβ-dependent; thus, NIK/IKKα-induced p100 processing
  likely requires the IKKβ-dependent expression of a critical signaling factor. MIP-2
  RNA induction by LMP1 depends on IKKγ, whereas MIG and I-TAC RNA inductions are
  IKKγ-independent and therefore atypical. In addition to canonical NF-κB activation,
  the LMP1 TRAF-binding site is the primary mediator of noncanonical NIK/IKKα activation
  leading to p100 processing to p52 and p52/RelB nuclear translocation. ELC, MIG,
  and CXCR4 RNA induction likely depend on this pathway. Essential molecules in each
  pathway are labeled in white.

  description: Model for LMP1-induced canonical and noncanonical NF-κB activation.
    LMP1 can induce canonical IKKβ-dependent NF-κB activation through both TRAF-binding
    (TES1) and death domain (DD)-binding (TES2) sites. This pathway depends on IRAK1
    and TRAF6 and is inhibited by dominant negative forms of TAB2 and Ubc13 (). The
    activation of an unknown IKK kinase similar to TAK-1 downstream of TRAF6 is illustrated.
    All LMP1-induced NF-κB activation is IKKβ-dependent; thus, NIK/IKKα-induced p100
    processing likely requires the IKKβ-dependent expression of a critical signaling
    factor. MIP-2 RNA induction by LMP1 depends on IKKγ, whereas MIG and I-TAC RNA
    inductions are IKKγ-independent and therefore atypical. In addition to canonical
    NF-κB activation, the LMP1 TRAF-binding site is the primary mediator of noncanonical
    NIK/IKKα activation leading to p100 processing to p52 and p52/RelB nuclear translocation.
    ELC, MIG, and CXCR4 RNA induction likely depend on this pathway. Essential molecules
    in each pathway are labeled in white.
