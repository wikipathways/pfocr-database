caption: Apoptotic effect of amygdalin via multiple cellular signaling pathways. Amygdalin
  activates p38MAPK, which affects the death stimuli, activates Bax apoptotic proteins,
  and inhibits Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins. Apoptosis-related proteins induce mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a decisive event in the process of cytochrome
  c release. Activation of the release of cytochrome c as a mitochondrial response
  to proapoptotic stimuli via the mitochondrial or intrinsic apoptotic pathway ultimately
  leads to the activation of caspases, including caspase-3, which induces apoptosis.
  Amygdalin induces ROS overproduction, which compromises the oxidative balance and
  eventually leads to apoptosis. Amygdalin downregulates cyclin-dependent kinase 2
  (CDK2) and cyclin A, which induces cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phases. Amygdalin
  also inhibits cell transfer from the G1 to S phase, resulting in the inhibition
  of cell proliferation and growth. “Activation” is shown by red arrows and ‘inhibition’
  shown by black arrows. Taken from Pharmaceuticals with permission of authors [].

    Amygdalin activates p38MAPK, which affects the death stimuli, activates Bax apoptotic
