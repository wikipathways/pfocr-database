caption: 'Simplified diagram of the two major pathways affected by EGFR-mediated signaling
  in malignant glioma cells. The PI3 kinase pathway is shown on the right and the
  Ras/Map kinase pathway on the left. Following EGFR activation, a series of sequential
  phosphorylation events result in cell proliferation and survival through increased
  transcription and translation of key proteins while inhibiting pro-apoptotic pathways.
  Agents that target key points in the pathway that are discussed in the text are
  shown in parentheses at their respective sites of action.Abbreviation: EGFR, epidermal
  growth factor receptor; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; mTORI, mTOR inhibitor;
  TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor; FTI, farnesyl transferase inhibitor; HDACI, histone
  deacetylase inhibitor; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome
  10; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP2,
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate.'
