caption: Metabolic pathways in activated T cells. After T‐cell receptor (TCR) engagement
  and CD28‐mediated co‐stimulation, activated T cells up‐regulate glucose transporters
  (GLUT) and amino acid transporters such as the glutamine transporter ASCT2, LAT1–CD98,
  which mediate leucine uptake, and the major alanine transporter SNAT1. These events
  allow T cells to undergo metabolic reprogramming that involves the up‐regulation
  of glycolysis with conversion of glucose into pyruvate. Pyruvate can either be converted
  to lactate or sustain the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The citrate withdrawn
  from the TCA cycle can be used to sustain lipid synthesis. Glycolysis can also feed
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which produces the necessary intermediates
  for nucleotide and protein synthesis. Endogenous fatty acids or those imported from
  the extracellular space through T‐cell‐surface receptors, such as GPCRs, fatty acid‐binding
  proteins TM (FABPTM), fatty acid transport proteins (FATP), or CD36, can also be
  oxidized to sustain mitochondrial ATP production. CIC, citrate carrier; IC, isocitrate;
  IL‐2R, IL‐2 receptor; KG, ketoglutarate; MPC, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier; OAA,
  oxaloacetate; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; S‐CoA, succinyl CoA
