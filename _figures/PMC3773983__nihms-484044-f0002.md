caption: 'Four major signaling pathways in the postsynaptic region of a neuron that
  combine to form a local signaling network. The major linear routes of signal flow
  are depicted by the thick arrows of four different colors: orange [phospholipase
  C (PLC) pathway], pink (Ras pathway), green (adenylyl cyclase pathway), and blue
  [Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) pathway]. The interactions between different pathways are
  represented by black lines with arrow (representing activation) or a dot (representing
  inhibition). Although most major interactions in the network are shown, these connections
  are not meant to be all-inclusive; additional connections could exist. The three-colored
  background represents three different cell compartments: the plasma membrane (light
  yellow), cytosol (light blue), and nucleus (light green). Some of the signaling
  proteins that translocate between different compartments are shown in both compartments.
  Examples include MAP kinase, which when activated translocates from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus to phosphorylate and activate transcription factors; and the transcription
  factor CREB, which upon phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) translocates to
  the nucleus.'
