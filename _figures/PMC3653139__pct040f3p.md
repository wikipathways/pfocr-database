caption: Plausible biosynthetic pathway and expression of unigenes involved in the
  biosynthesis of anthraquinones in O. pumila. The expression levels of unigenes encoding
  the enzymes of each step are shown. Separated proteins of MenD, MenH and MenC in
  bacteria are known to be fused to a single protein in Arabidopsis (). HR, hairy
  roots; CSC, cell suspension culture; MenF, menaquinone-specific isochorismate synthase;
  MenD, 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate synthase; MenH,
  2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate synthase; MenC, o-succinylbenzoate
  synthase; MenE, o-succinylbenzoic acid-CoA ligase; MenB, naphthoate synthase; DXPS,
  1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; CLA, cloroplastos alterados; DXR, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose
  5-phosphate reductoisomerase; ISPD, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase;
  CDPMEK, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase; ISPF, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; HDS, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate
  synthase; HDR, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase. The expression
  levels of unigenes are represented with a black–blue color code and FPKM values.
