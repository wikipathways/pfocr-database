caption: Pathway of 1,2-propanediol degradation. Under fermentative conditions, the
  pathway of 1,2-propanediol degradation provides a source of ATP and reducing power
  (NADH) but no source of cell carbon. Under aerobic conditions or during anaerobic
  respiration with tetrathionate, propionyl-CoA feeds into the methyl citrate pathway
  to provide additional ATP as well as biosynthetic building blocks.
