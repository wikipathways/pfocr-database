caption: Mechanism of neoantigen-induced CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity.
  (A) Neoantigens are processed and presented by MHC-I molecules on the cell surface
  of dendritic cells (DC) and subsequently recognized by the T cell receptor (TCR)
  of T cells along with the co-receptor CD8. The TCR-MHC-neoantigen interaction, together
  with the co-stimulation mediated by the interaction between CD28 and CD80/86, induces
  the activation, expansion and differentiation of antigen-specific effector CD8+
  T cells. (B) Activated effector CD8+ T cells recognize tumor cells presenting these
  neoantigens by TCR and attack the tumor cells by perforin and granzyme B-mediated
  cytolysis, Fas/FasL pathway and cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ and TNF-α) release, which
  promotes the eradication of tumor cells.
