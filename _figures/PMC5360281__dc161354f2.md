caption: 'Visualization of selected miRNA targeting events on the insulin signaling
  pathway (from WikiPathways). The genes targeted by miRNA per pathway, as counted
  in Supplementary Table 3, are visualized in this figure for selected pathways. Pathway
  was imported into Cytoscape from WikiPathways, and ID mapping was performed to obtain
  Entrez Gene identifiers for each gene. An intermediate file from the Pathway Finder
  tool was parsed and imported into Cytoscape to supply the mappings between Entrez
  Gene and the selected set of miRNAs. A visual style was defined in Cytoscape to
  highlight any gene targeted by these miRNAs in preferential order: miR-122 (blue),
  miR-192 (red), and any of the other 14 possible miRNAs (gray). Other selected pathways
  from WikiPathways are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.'
