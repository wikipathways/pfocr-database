caption: Modified model of the HMA-induced viral mimicry in leukemic cells. (A) Treatment
  with DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis), such as azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine
  (DAC), reactivate repressed inverted-repeat Alus (IRAlus), leading to the formation
  of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). The same agents upregulate the expression of the
  RNA-editing enzyme, ADAR1 (1). The pattern recognition receptor, MDA5, senses the
  dsRNAs located in the cytoplasm, leading to the aggregation of the mitochondrial
  antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and to the phosphorylation of interferon (IFN)
  regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). However, increased ADAR1 activity depletes dsRNAs and
  prevents the activation of MDA5 (2), whereas, it further inhibits the OAS/RNAse
  L apoptotic pathway (3). In the absence of ADAR1 upregulation, activated IRF7 translocates
  into the nucleus inducing the transcription of type-I and III IFN (4), which are
  then secreted into the tumor microenvironment (5) and bind to their receptors, causing
  the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins
  (6). Activated STATs associate with the IRF9 and move into the nucleus (7), where
  they induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and the major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) molecules (8) by increasing the ability of tumor cells to present
  tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). (B) The competence of HMAs to induce a viral mimicry
  state potentially depends on the level of cellular differentiation. The latter defines
  the permissiveness to IFN-mediated induction of ISGs and the degree of upregulation
  of ADAR1.
