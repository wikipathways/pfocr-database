caption: a, Gemcitabine, or 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC), is in molecular competition
  with endogenous deoxycytidylate species at every stage of its metabolism, from uptake
  to phosphorylation to incorporation into elongating nascent DNA. The efficacy of
  gemcitabine can therefore be enhanced by depleting cellular deoxycytidylate nucleotides
  through either dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibition or disruption of
  oncogenic signalling through mucin 1 (MUC1) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)
  as this increases the proportion of gemcitabine-derived nucleotides relative to
  their endogenous counterparts. b, Various cytotoxic anticancer therapies operate
  by causing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. Adaptive resistance to these therapies
  emerges downstream of hyperactive DSB repair, which requires large amounts of deoxynucleotide
  triphosphates (dNTPs). Inhibition of dNTP synthesis therefore enhances the efficacy
  of these therapies in many contexts. c, Aside from its role in pyrimidine synthesis,
  DHODH also opposes ferroptosis by neutralizing mitochondrial lipid peroxide radicals
  through the generation of reduced ubiquinol and opposes apoptosis by contributing
  to mitochondrial membrane potential. DHODH inhibition therefore sensitizes cancer
  cells to ferroptosis and apoptosis-inducing agents such as GPX4 inhibitors and TNF-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), respectively. ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential; 5-FU,
