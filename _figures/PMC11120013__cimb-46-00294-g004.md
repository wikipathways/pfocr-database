caption: CP-derived RONS promote cancer cell autophagy and death by activating the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family signalling pathways. RONS activating
  JNK and extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways leads to autophagosome
  formation and autophagy, while JNK and p38 also potentiate apoptosis via both intrinsic
  and extrinsic pathways of p53. Cancer cells that highly express gasdermin E (GSDME)
  also undergo pyroptosis
