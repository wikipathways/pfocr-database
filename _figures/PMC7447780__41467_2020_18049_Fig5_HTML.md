caption: a The stacked bars represent the relative amount of Ile isotopologues measured
  in the supernatant of liquid holidic medium of bacterial cultures in complete holidic
  medium (filled black circle) or in medium without Ile (-Ile) or without His (-His)
  containing uniformly 13C labelled lactate (13C-lactate). Heavy-labelled Ile isotopologues
  were measured using LC–MS in samples collected after 48 h of bacterial growth and
  displayed as metabolite peak area. The number of heavy carbons incorporated per
  Ile molecule is indicated as m + n, where m = molecular mass of the metabolite and
  n = the number of 13C. Filled black circles represent the presence of specific bacteria
  in the culture. For each condition 3 independent bacterial cultures were sampled.
  The plots represent the mean amount of the detected isotopologues per condition
  and the error bars represent the s.e.m. Source data are provided as a Source Data
  file. b Predicted biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of Ile from lactate in
  A. pomorum. Circled numbers correspond to the enzymes and reactions in Supplementary
  Table . The fate of lactate carbon atoms incorporated through the TCA cycle is indicated
  in red, while the pyruvate (derived from lactate) carbon atoms incorporated by enzyme
  10 are labelled in green and red. Note that the resulting Ile molecule can contain
  2 or 4 labelled carbon atoms depending on the labelling of the lactate molecules.
  Continuous arrows represent direct reactions; dashed arrows represent two or more
  consecutive reactions.
