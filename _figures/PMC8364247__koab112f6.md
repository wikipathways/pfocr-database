caption: A working model of the role of NF-YCs in light-triggered repression of the
  BR pathway. In the light, NF-YCs inhibit BR biosynthesis by directly repressing
  the expression of BR6ox2. On the other hand, NF-YCs enhance BIN2 activity by promoting
  the autophosphorylation of BIN2 for its stabilization. The NF-YC-mediated inhibition
  of the BR pathway facilitates photomorphogenic growth by regulating both BR biosynthesis
  and signaling. The lines ending with arrows indicate promotion. The lines ending
  with bars indicate repression.
