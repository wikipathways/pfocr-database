caption: IAV infection/NS1 transfection alters the interferon pathway and IKKε phosphorylation
  which inhibits PML-NB formation. NS1 also changes the SUMOylation pattern of PML-NB
  which leads to its degradation. PML-NB degradation increases the oxidative stress
  through elevated level of ROS at the late phase of infection. On the top of that
  IAV infection and NS1 transfection both generate cellular stress at late time points
  and induce oxidative stress. ROS alters the mitochondrial function and activates
  several stress signalling pathways which at the end activate p53 and caspase 3 to
  induce apoptosis.
