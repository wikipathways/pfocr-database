caption: Sxl is integrated into the Hh signaling pathway. The Hh pathway scheme is
  modified from . It shows the branch leading to the formation of the transcriptional
  activator Ci155 upon Hh binding to its receptor Ptc. Hh signaling promotes the Sxl
  entry into the nucleus. Sxl upregulates both Ci155 and its target Dpp, as well as
  Dpp targets pMad and Sal ().
