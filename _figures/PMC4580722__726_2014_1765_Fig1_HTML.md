caption: Overview of the autophagic machinery. (Macro)autophagy starts with the nucleation
  of an isolation membrane, named the phagophore, which surrounds a fraction of the
  cytoplasm destined for degradation. Upon induction of autophagy, e.g., in starvation,
  the ULK1 complex localizes to a specialized domain of the ER called the omegasome.
  This privileged site for the biogenesis of the phagophore forms a cradle where the
  autophagosomal membrane elongates and acts as a template for the spherical form
  of the autophagosome. Downstream the ULK1 complex is the PIK3C3 complex, which produces
  phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) to allow the recruitment of the PI(3)P-binding
  proteins WIPI1/2 and ZFYVE1/DFCP1. Both contribute to the expansion and the closure
  of the autophagosome together with the ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L complex and the LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine
  (LC3-PE) conjugate. Whereas ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L only transiently associates with the
  autophagosomal membrane, LC3–PE constitutes a specific marker of the autophagosome
  as it remains associated with the autophagosomal inner membrane. The newly formed
  autophagosome receives input from the endocytic pathway and ultimately fuses with
  a lysosome, allowing the degradation of autophagic substrates by lysosomal hydrolases.
  Fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome requires the small Rab GTPases (such
  as Rab7, 8B and 24) and the transmembrane lysosomal protein LAMP2. The products
  of autophagic degradation, such as amino acids, are recycled to the cytosol where
  they exert a negative feedback on autophagy initiation. In addition to amino acids,
  autophagy is also controlled by upstream signaling pathways governed by insulin/growth
  factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the energy status (through AMPK). Most
  of these factors regulate the two initiation complexes, ULK1 and PIK3C3. As a master
  regulator of autophagy, MTORC1 integrates multiple of these upstream signals and
  controls the activity of the ULK1 complex
