caption: cGAS-STING pathway and the NF-κB pathway. DNA damage can be recognized by
  ATM, PARP-1 and c32/56, leading to activation of ubiquitination of STING or NEMO,
  resulting in activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. TBK1 may also induce activation
  of IKK, which activates NF-κB. in addition, TBK1 plays a dual role in metabolism.
  During energy consumption, the AMPK signaling pathway can activate TBK1 via ULK1,
  which in turn acts as a feedback system to inhibit AMPK, thereby suppressing caloric
  expenditure. Over-activated TBK1 in turn suppresses inflammation and insulin resistance
  by inhibiting obesity-mediated activation of NIK and NF-κB. ATM ataxia telangiectasia
