caption: 'Sphingolipid metabolic pathway in liver regeneration and HCC progression.
  Numerous agonists, including cytokines and growth factors, activate cytosolic SK
  to translocate to the plasma membrane and produce S1P. S1P can be irreversibly degraded
  by S1P lyase (SPL). It can also be dephosphorylated by S1P phosphatases (SPP). After
  being secreted by ABC transporters or Spns2, S1P binds and activates S1P receptors
  (S1PR1-5) and regulates numerous cellular functions such as proliferation, angiogenesis
  and migration. In de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis, serine and palmitoyl-CoA are
  converted to sphinganine and further modified to form ceramide. SM: sphingomyelin,
  Cer: ceramide, Cers: ceramide synthtase, ACdase: acid ceramidase, Sph: sphingosine,
  SK: sphingosine kinase, SPP: sphingosine phosphatase, SPL: sphingosine lyase, DES:
  dihydroceramide desaturase'
