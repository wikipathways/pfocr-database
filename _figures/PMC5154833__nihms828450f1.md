caption: '4-Aminobutyric acid (also γ-aminobutyric acid; GABA) is normally metabolized
  to succinic semialdehyde via GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), and subsequently forms
  succinic acid via succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), the defect in SSADH
  deficiency (SSADHD; box). Multiple metabolites are elevated in tissues of aldh5a1−/−
  mice, and in physiological fluids derived from patients with SSADHD. These include:
  γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB; produced from succinic semialdehyde (SSA) in a reaction
  catalyzed by aldo-keto reductase 7a2, AKR7a2); D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid (D-2-HG;
  produced in a reaction catalyzed by nicotinamide-independent D-2-hydroxyglutaric
  transhydrogenase (TH), which stoichiometrically interconverts SSA and GHB coupled
  to the interconversion of D-2-HG with α-ketoglutarate (a-KG)), succinic semialdehyde
  (SSA); and 4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid (DHHA; no enzyme reaction has been identified
  that catalyzes the formation of DHHA, but it may be derived from SSA condensation
  with an “activated” two carbon species, perhaps within the pathway of oxidative
  phosphorylation []). In addition to GABA-T, monoamine oxidase (MAO) and β-alanine
  aminotransferase (βAAT) can also metabolize GABA. Also shown is 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal
  (4-HNE), which is metabolized to 4-HNE acid in brain in a reaction catalyzed by
  SSADH. Note the structural similarities of 4-HNE and SSA.'
