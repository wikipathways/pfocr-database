caption: Stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) leads to the recruitment and activation
  of protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ), which in turn recruits a protein complex comprising
  CARMA1, BCL-10 and MALT1. MALT1 binds to and activates TNF receptor-associated factor
  6 (TRAF6), which then activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs) through K63-linked polyubiquitylation. Proper T cell activation
  requires both TCR stimulation and co-stimulatory signals. In the absence of co-stimulation,
  several E3 ligases (such as GRAIL, CBL-B and ITCH) keep T cell activation in check
  by targeting multiple stages of the TCR signalling pathway, including the TCR complex
  and downstream signalling molecules, such as PKCθ. Co-stimulatory signals release
  the inhibition of TCR signalling mediated by E3 ligases.
