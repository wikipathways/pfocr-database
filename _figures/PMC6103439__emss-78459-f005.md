caption: Components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), such as collagens and fibronectin,
  interact with cell surface integrins and cadherins. Depending on which surface molecule
  they interact with, the cancer hallmarks (uncontrolled proliferation, invasiveness
  and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)) can either be activated or repressed.
  Activation of the MAPK/PI3K pathway, mediated by integrin stimulation, facilitates
  nuclear translocation of β-catenin, resulting in EMT and increased invasiveness.
  EMT is also induced by TGFβ signalling, through collagen- and fibronectin-integrin
  associations. Other stimuli, including secreted cytokines, can contribute to cell
  transformation. For example, YAP signalling is activated by IL-5, in turn causing
  increased proliferation and loss of contact-dependent growth inhibition, which is
  typical behaviour associated with cancer cells.
