caption: 'Biogenesis, Packaging, and Secretion of Exosomal miRNAsmiRNA genes are initially
  transcribed into primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) in the nucleus. A nuclear complex consisting
  of Drosha and DGCR8 cleaves the pri-miRNAs, resulting in the generation of precursor
  miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Exportin 5 is responsible for nuclear export of the pre-miRNAs.
  In the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNAs are further processed by the Dicer complex into
  double-strand miRNAs (∼22 nt). One strand of the miRNA duplex (the mature miRNA)
  is selected to be incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The
  main components of the miRISC include miRNA, miRNA-targeted mRNA, GW182, and Argonaute
  2 (Ago2). The miRNA in the miRISC can bind to the complementary sequence in the
  3′ UTR of its target mRNA, which causes mRNA destabilization and translation suppression.
  Mature miRNAs are generally sorted into exosomes via four potential pathways: A,
  nSMase2-dependent pathway; B, the 3′ end of the miRNA sequence-dependent pathway
  (the 3′ end of the miRNA sequence contains an important sorting signal and thus
  guides specific miRNAs to be packed into exosomes); C, the miRNA motif and sumoylated
  hnRNP-dependent pathway (three hnRNP family proteins, hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPA1, and hnRNPC,
  guide miRNA loading into exosomes, and, among them, sumoylated hnRNPA2B1 specifically
  recognizes the GGAG motif in the 3′ portion of miRNA sequences and governs the sorting
  of miRNAs into exosomes); and D, the miRISC-related pathway. The RISC can co-localize
  with MVBs. Ago2 and miRNA-targeted mRNA are also associated with the exosomal assortment
  of miRNAs. Finally, MVBs fuse with the cellular membrane and release exosomes containing
  miRNAs into the extracellular space.'
