caption: Illustration summarising the major tumour procoagulant effects in pancreatic
  cancer. (1) Tissue factor (TF) expression and release of TF-positive microvesicles
  (TF + MV) (2) TF triggers the extrinsic pathway of coagulation leading to thrombin
  (FIIa) generation. (3) Heparanase (HPSE) removes glycocalyces containing tissue
  factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), thereby enhancing TF activity. (4) Tumour-derived
  mucin and podoplanin (PDPN) activate platelets, which express phosphatidylserine
  (PS) on their surfaces (5), facilitating prothrombinase complex assembly and thrombin
  generation. Activated platelets present adhesion molecules that facilitate endothelial-platelet
  and platelet–leukocyte interactions that contribute to generation of platelet-rich
  microthrombi (6). Activated neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)
  (7) that create a matrix for blood cell and MV adhesion which promote thrombosis
  and impair blood flow. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) released from tumour cells or neutrophils
  provides a negatively charged surface that promotes activation of factor XII (FXII)
  (8). FXIIa initiates the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, providing an additional
  source of thrombin. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1)—a potent inhibitor
  of fibrinolysis – can be released by pancreatic tumour cells, as well as by activated
  platelets (9)
