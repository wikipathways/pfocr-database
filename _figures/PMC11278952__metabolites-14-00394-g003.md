caption: 'Schematic representation of the alterations of bile acids involved in the
  synthesis pathway in HD. Primary bile acids are converted to secondary bile acids
  by the gut microbiome. 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol from the brain mainly involves the
  alternative pathway. GCDCA and GUDCA levels are elevated and iso-LCA decreased in
  Huntington’s disease patients (HD) (presymptomatic HD (preHD) + symptomatic HD (symHD),
  and the total of neurotoxic bile acids (GCA + GDCA + GCDCA) is higher in symHD compared
  to healthy controls (HC). Conversely, the sum of neuroprotective BAs (UDCA + GUDCA
  + TUDCA) is increased in preHD carriers compared to HC. Also, it is noted that decreased
  CYP46A1 and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol levels in HD have been shown in previously
  published papers. Abbreviations: CA, cholic acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; TCA,
