caption: A schematic of HER3 engagedment in heterodimerization and signaling. General
  features of HER2:HER3 signaling. HER2 fails to bind any known HER-family ligands
  and HER3 has impaired catalytic activity. Following ligand engagement, HER3 engages
  and allosterically activates its kinase partner, in this case HER2. Phosphorylation
  of its C-terminal tail leads to recruitment of adapter proteins leading to activation
  of PI3K and RAS pathways. Activation of PI3K leads to phosphorylation of membrane
  phosphoinositides producing PIP3, which in turn docks the PH domain-containing proteins
  PDK1 and AKT. Membrane-bound AKT is phosphorylated and activated by PDK1 and mTOR.
  Activated AKT proceeds to phosphorylate a plethora of cellular substrates involved
  in diverse biological processes. HER3 ligand neuregulin (NRG) initiates HER2-HER3
  dimerization which also leads to activate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  via phosphorylation of AKT-HSF1 (heat shock factor1)-SLUG (known EMT-regulator)
  signaling pathway (please see the text for details).
