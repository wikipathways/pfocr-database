caption: The reverse transsulfuration pathway. The reverse transsulfuration pathway
  is responsible for the transfer of sulfur from homocysteine, which in turn is derived
  from dietary methionine, to cysteine. Cysteine is synthesized from homocysteine
  by the action of CBS and CSE. CBS condenses serine and homocysteine to form cystathionine,
  which is acted on by CSE to produce cysteine and the gaseous signaling molecule,
  H2S. Both CBS and CSE can generate H2S from homocysteine. Cysteine can also be channeled
  into glutathione biosynthesis to maintain redox balance in cells. The availability
  of cysteine is the rate-limiting step for the synthesis of glutathione. CBS, cystathionine
  β-synthase; CSE, cystathionine γ-lyase; H2S, hydrogen sulfide. Color images are
  available online.
