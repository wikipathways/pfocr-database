caption: 'Fifty eight-week-old Sprague–Dawley rats received an ACLT surgery to build
  KOA model after seven days of adaptive feeding. Then, experimental groups underwent
  following treatments: acupuncture, RS504393, and combination of acupuncture+RS504393
  seven days after the surgery, and the mechanical pain was tested once every seven days.
  After seven weeks of intervention, all rats received behavioral tests (open field
  test and thermal pain test) and then sacrificed. Cartilage and synovium from right
  knee joint and DRGs from L3-5 were collected to conduct histology test and molecular
  biology experiment (immunofluorescence labeling and Western blot). DRG: dorsal root
  ganglion; ACLT: anterior cruciate ligament transection. (A color version of this
  figure is available in the online journal.)'
