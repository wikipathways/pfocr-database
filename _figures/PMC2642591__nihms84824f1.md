caption: Retinoic acid (RA) is produced from vitamin A (retinol) via a two-step enzymatic
  pathway that oxidizes retinol to retinaldehyde and then retinaldehyde to RA. Oxidation
  of retinol to retinaldehyde requires the activities of several alcohol dehydrogenases
  (ADH-1,-4,-5) and subsequently, retinaldehyde is oxidized to retinoic acid by retinal
  dehydrogenases (RALDH). RA produced by DCs acts on T- and B-lymphocytes, and induces
  the mucosal homing receptors α4β7-integrin, and CCR9. RA in the presence of TGF-β
  promotes the conversion of naïve T cells in to Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, and at
  high concentration inhibits the differentiation of Th-17 cells. In addition, RA
  synergizes with IL-6 and IL-5 and promotes class switching to IgA in B cells.
