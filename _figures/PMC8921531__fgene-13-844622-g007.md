caption: Genes in the polysaccharide synthesis pathway in Dendrobium nobile, adapted
  from Wang (). Hydrolysis or hydrolysis-derived reactions could generate monosaccharides,
  such as mannose, glucose, and galactose. These monosaccharides are also the basic
  building blocks and repeating units for synthesizing polysaccharides. Genes in red
  indicate gene copy number variation among D. nobile, Dendrobium catenatum, Dendrobium
  chrysotoxum, Phalaenopsis equestris, Apostasia shenzhenica, and Arabidopsis thaliana.
  Genes in green are Dendrobium-specific. The dashed lines indicate multiple steps.
