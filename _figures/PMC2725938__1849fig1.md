caption: Main pathways associated with response to CR. Metabolic fluctuations signal
  through a nutrient and energy level. A decrease in the nutrient levels down-regulates
  the IIS pathway and the nutrient-dependent kinases TOR, PKA, and AKT, which in turn
  up-regulate stress response organizers such as the transcription factors NF-κB and
  FOXOs. In parallel, the cell's energetic imbalance produced by CR up-regulates the
  NAD+-dependent family of Sirtuins and the nutrient-dependent kinase AMPK, which
  in turn activate and modulate the stress response. Sirtuins are also involved in
  the activation of the LKB1 kinase. Overall, as is shown in the bottom part of the
  figure, survival and life span increase is activated through the activation of several
  processes (in blue) and inhibition of others (in green).
