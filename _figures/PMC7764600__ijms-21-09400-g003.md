caption: The cellular degradation pathway of autophagy plays a fundamental role in
  immunity. Environmental perturbations (endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, hypoxia)
  as well as chemotherapy and radiation, by inducing DNA damage and cellular stress,
  inhibit AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and activate autophagy. The autophagy
  machinery interfaces with most immune signaling molecules involved in the development,
  homeostasis, and survival of inflammatory cells, including macrophages, neutrophils,
  T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes. Disturbance of ER homeostasis that cannot be rescued
  by the unfolded protein response (UPR) results in autophagy, which is largely attributed
  to the inactivation of the mTOR and downregulation of AKT/mTOR pathway, which is
  an important signaling pathway in the development of GC. Autophagy is necessary
  for recognition of the EBV-EBNA1 antigen by CD4+ T cells via HLA-II and EBV-mediated
  activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and plays a role in the reactivation
  of the EBV lytic cycle. The EBV-BZLF1 protein, also known as Zta, creates a positive
  loop with autophagosomes to maintain the EBV lytic cycle. IFN, type I interferon.
