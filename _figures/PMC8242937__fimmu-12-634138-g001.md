caption: The biology and functions of exosomes in schistosomiasis. Exosomes are vesicles
  that are formed by the inward budding of the multivesicular body (MVB) membrane.
  Cargo sorting systems include an ESCRT -dependent pathway (especially for ubiquitylated
  protein) and an ESCRT-independent pathway (e.g., lipid raft-mediated and ceramide-dependent
  pathways). Exosomes are secreted following MVB fusion with the cell membrane. Exosomes
  interact with and are taken up by target cells in different ways, including receptor-mediated
  endocytosis and direct fusion with the plasma membrane. Exosomes can be regarded
  as delivering vehicles for several biological processes in schistosomiasis. They
  transfer antigens, proteins and RNA to modulate immune responses, gene expression,
  and metabolic processes. Exosomes are also involved in the transfer of lipids to
  recognize TLRs, thus participating in tissue repair.
