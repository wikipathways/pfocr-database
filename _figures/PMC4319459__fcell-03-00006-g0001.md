caption: eNOS activation promotes mithormesis and healthspan extension. Calorie restriction
  (CR) and exercise act as slight stressors favoring low-level ROS production. Further,
  CR, exercise and dietary supplementation with a balanced BCAA-EAA formula enhance
  eNOS expression and NO production. The eNOS-NO-PGC1α pathway boosts mitochondrial
  renewal, with efficient energy production, and activates the endogenous antioxidant
  response. Thus, within a finely tuned cellular range, NO and ROS activate mithormesis,
  an adaptive stress resistance program promoting cell survival and prolonging healthspan.
  Conversely, cardiovascular risk factors uncouple eNOS and lead to superoxide (O•−2)
  and peroxynitrite (ONOO−), a powerful oxidant that initiates a vitious cell-damaging
  cycle that favors chronic age-related diseases.
