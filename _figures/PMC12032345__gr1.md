caption: Overview of STING signaling pathwayDNA from damaged mitochondria or pathogens
  can be recognized by cGAS, and cGAS subsequently catalyzes the formation of 2′,3′-cGAMP.
  The resulting 2′,3′-cGAMP binds to STING with “closed” conformation along with translocation.
  The phosphorylation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB leads to the upregulation
  of type I IFNs, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. CDNs derived from pathogens
  such as c-di-GMP, c-di-AMP, and 3′,3′-cGAMP and non-CDNs such as SR-717, MSA-2,
  and diABZI can also trigger the STING signaling pathway.1,18 Safeguards that limit
  cGAS-STING activation26 include the nucleases TREX1 at the ER and DNase II or ADA2
  in the lysosome, the export of cGAMP and subsequent degradation of cGAMP by ENPP1,
  and the degradation of STING in the lysosomal compartment
