caption: Depiction of RAS-ERK signaling pathway and primary and secondary connections
  to substrates identified by time-resolved phosphoproteome profiling. Primary and
  secondary targets dynamically modulated upon vemurafenib treatment. Main functional
  groups depicted are “RPS6 kinases,” “RTK signaling,” actin cytoskeleton organization,
  nuclear pore, and “transcription.” Key players of actin cytoskeleton regulation,
  including Rho GEF's and GAP's, are emphasized. The Hippo pathway target, YAP1, acts
  together with TEAD factors (here TEAD3) to control transcription at promoters containing
  M-CAT elements. TCF and MKL1/2 assemble with SRF on promoters comprising serum response
  elements (SREs). The MKL1/2 regulators LMO7 and FLNA/B included putative RSK (RPS6A)
  phosphosites that were dynamically modulated after vemurafenib treatment.
