caption: Model to depict functional coupling between Stim1- and Orai1-mediating calcium
  entry. Stim1/Orai1-mediated calcium entry is critical for endothelial permeability
  via activation of calcium-sensitive PKCα. Within these ER-PM junctions, Ca2+ enters
  via Orai1 (the PM Ca2+ entry channel), where the channel interacts with Stim1 (the
  ER luminal Ca2+ sensor), and is activated. Ca2+ entry through Orai1 channel induces
  multiple signaling pathways such as activation of the NF-κB pathway []. The classical
  PKCα isoforms contains both calcium- and diacylglycerol-binding domains, and activation
  of PKCα is accompanied by translocation to the plasma membrane. ER – endoplasmic
  reticulum; PM – plasmic membrane; DAG – diacylglycerol.
