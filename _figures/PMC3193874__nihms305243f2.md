caption: 'Normally, the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is activated by nutrients
  (Glucose and amino acids), growth factors and insulin, which enhances the activation
  downstream of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) that is critical
  regulator of the pro-inflammatory gene expression. TOR is directly inhibited by
  rapamycin, and indirectly by the oral anti-diabetic drug metformin and resveratrol,
  which activate AMPK, an important inhibitor of TOR. The histone deacetylase, Sirtuin-1,
  considered a master metabolic regulator (involved in Cholesterol and fat metabolism,
  and glucose homeostasis), exhibits ability to modulate and control numerous transcription
  factors including de-acetylating (inactivation) of NFκB with the consequent reduction
  in the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. Resveratrol also enhances activation
  of Sirtuin-1 (negative regulator of NFκB) and inhibits PI3K and S6K (positive regulators
  of NFκB). The levels of nutrients and insulin are reduced during caloric restriction
  which decreases activation of TOR pathway. IGF-1R: Insulin growth factor type 1
  receptor; IRS-1: Insulin receptor substrate-1; PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  PTEN: Phosphatase and tensin homolog; Akt: Serine-threonine protein kinase; S6K:
  70KDa protein kinase; ATP: Adenosine triphosphate; AMP: Adenosine monophosphate;
  AMPK: 5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase.'
