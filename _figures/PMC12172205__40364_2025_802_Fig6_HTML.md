caption: Bacterial dysbiosis drives profound changes in the gut environment of CD
  patients. These changes include the displacement of commensal bacteria, predominantly
  F. prausnitzii in healthy individuals, by dysbiotic bacterial communities dominated
  by F. umbilicata in CD patients. Additionally, microbial metabolic pathway activity
  is altered, leading to shifts in metabolite concentrations within the GI tract of
  affected individuals. Notably, integrative analysis of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics,
  and metabolomics revealed that E. coli utilizes aspartate to promote its growth
  and consumes propionate to express virulence factor genes such as ompA, which is
  involved in host adherence and invasion
