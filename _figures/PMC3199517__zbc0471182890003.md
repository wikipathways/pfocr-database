caption: Schematic model of NF-κB activation network. While in an inactivated state,
  NF-κB is located in the cytosol complexed with the inhibitory protein IκB proteins,
  represented here as the single IκBα species. Upon TNFα stimulation, IKK is activated,
  which catalyzes degradation of IκBα, releasing NF-κB. The activated free NF-κB is
  translocated into the nucleus, where it induces expression of downstream genes,
  such as A20 and IκBα (boldface lines, c1 and c1a). These two proteins act as negative
  feedback loops to turn off the NF-κB signaling (dotted lines and translation reactions,
  c4 and c4a). Experimentally shown in this study, a large amount of NF-κB does not
  translocate to the nucleus upon stimulation and acts as a reservoir of NF-κB. The
  exchange between the reservoir and translocable NF-κB is shown with dashed lines;
  however, their exact mechanism and rate kinetics (P1, P2) are yet to be determined
  and are assumed to be relatively slow relative to the overall NF-κB translocation
  kinetics. The total concentration of NF-κB is determined by quantitative Western
  blots in this study to be ∼0.12 μm. The initial translocation-competent fraction
  of NF-κB is represented by NF-κB·IκBα complex. See supplemental material for specific
  parameter values.
