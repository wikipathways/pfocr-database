caption: Membrane-bound Notch ligands (Dll1,3,4 and Jag1,2) are characterized by a
  Delta/Serrate/Lag2 (DSL) motif (yellow) located in the extracellular domain. The
  Notch receptor (Notch1-4) is processed at the S1 site by a furin protease, sugar-modified
  by Fringe in the Golgi, and inserted into the membrane as a heterodimer with a large
  extracellular domain (NECD). Ligand-receptor interaction leads to two consecutive
  cleavage events (at S2 and S3 sites), respectively carried out by an ADAM protease
  and presenilin, which release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates
  to the nucleus and forms a transcriptional activation complex after binding to Mastermind
  (MAML) and CSL/RBPJk/Su(H). This ternary complex activates the transcription of
  a set of target genes including Hes, Hey and others.
