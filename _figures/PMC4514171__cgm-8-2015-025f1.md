caption: 'TLR diversity, ligands, and signaling. TLRs are expressed on the epithelial
  and immune cells on the plasma membrane (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5) and endosomal
  membrane (TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9). Pathogenic PAMPS are the natural ligands of TLRs:
  eg, bacterial lipid-derived macromolecules are ligands for TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and
  TLR6, while nucleic acid derivatives like dsDNA (TLR3) nucleotide complexes with
  other macromolecules (TLR7) and the CpG nucleotide sequence (TLR9). TLR signaling
  in an MyD88-dependent and TRIF-mediated (MyD88-independent) pathway leads to the
  translocation of AP-1, NF-κB, and IRF-3, respectively, to the nucleus, which induces
  the transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes.'
