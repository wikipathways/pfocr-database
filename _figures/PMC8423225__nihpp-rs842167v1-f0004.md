caption: Overview of SARS-CoV-2 entry, infection and endothelial inflammation and
  cell death. As is well established, oral nasopharyngeal entry of SARS-CoV-2 is followed
  by its binding to the alveolar epithelium. The infected pneumocytes secrete cytokine
  and chemokines, which attract neutrophils to the alveolar space, leading to a possible
  breach of the alveolar wall. Meanwhile, endothelial cells overexpress NLRP3 as we
  observed in the autopsies (either by infection, or via increased amounts of chemokines
  and cytokines). The NLRP3 pathway drives endothelial pyroptosis. The leads to breakdown
  of the endothelial-alveolar barrier and causes interstitial and alveolar space flooding.
  Endothelial cell death and debris activates coagulation cascades that promotes thrombi
  formation.
