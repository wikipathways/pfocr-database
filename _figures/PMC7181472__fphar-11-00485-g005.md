caption: Mechanism of Kunxian capsule in treating RA. The red nodes represent targets
  in Kunxian capsule. (A) Through intermediate protein Gβγ, GPCRs regulated the activation
  of PI3Ks. The phosphorylation of PI3K activated AKT which lead to downstream cascades,
  such as controlling cell proliferation, protein translation. JAK-STAT signaling
  is related with the proliferation of the inflammatory cells. Lastly, cAMP, a second
  messenger affected by calcium signaling pathway, could activate PI3K via intermediate
  molecules, such as PKA and mTOR, which are high degree targets in KX. KX inhibits
  the three pathways and decrease cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis in
  RA. (B) Th17 cells could be activated by IL-1β (through mTOR-ROR) or IL-6 (through
  STAT3-HIF1-ROR). Subsequently, the activated TH17 cells released IL-17, which activated
  the downstream effector cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and synovial fibroblast.
  These cells could release inflammatory cytokines which could promoted cartilage
  damage. KX could target at the critical checkpoints in the pathways, downregulating
  the inflammatory cells proliferation and alleviating cartilage damage.
