caption: Schematic illustrating the pheromone-dependent MAPK pathway in budding yeast.
  The two branches of this pathway are responsible for generating cell polarity and
  tracking pheromone gradients and for arresting the cell division cycle and activating
  the expression of the mating program. The receptor is Ste2 or Ste3 for mating type
  a or α, respectively. Molecules and interactions of a similar type are color coded.
  Orange denotes receptors and G proteins, pink denotes kinases, and dark green denotes
  scaffold molecules. Black arrows denote phosphorylation, blue arrows denote synthesis,
  and red arrows denote translocation or recruitment. See text (section Physiological
  function of the yeast pheromone-induced pathway) for a more detailed description
  of protein interactions.
