caption: Bile acid synthesis in CTX. Due to the deficiency of 27-sterol hydroxylase
  (CYP27), the production of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and cholic acid (CA) is
  reduced and cholestanol and cholesterol accumulate. CDCA supplementation inhibits
  bile acid synthesis via negative feedback on both the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
  pathway and on cholesterol biosynthesis (dashed lines), thereby preventing cholestanol
  and cholesterol accumulation
