caption: The Rab cycle. The newly synthesized Rab protein associates with Rab escort
  protein (REP) that directs it to Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (RabGGT) to receive
  its prenyl tails (red wavy lines). REP delivers the Rab to its target membrane.
  Throughout this process, the Rab is GDP-bound. A guanine nucleotide exchange factor
  (GEF) catalyzes exchange of GDP for GTP to activate the Rab. The GTP-bound Rab interacts
  with effector proteins that mediate membrane traffic in the pathway regulated by
  its associated Rab. The Rab then interacts with its associated GTPase activating
  protein (GAP) that catalyzes hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by the Rab. The Rab is then
  removed from the membrane by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) in
  preparation for the next cycle. The insertion of the Rab into the target membrane
  is mediated by a GDI dissociation factor (GDF) that releases the Rab from GDI. Loss-of-function
  mutations at each of the above steps produce disease phenotypes as indicated by
  the red text boxes.
