caption: In the absence of other factors, PBP2 and RodA are enzymatically inactive
  (left). In response to signals yet to be determined, MreC associates with PBP2,
  induced a conformational change, which in turn activates RodA (center). We propose
  that this activated complex has a higher affinity for MreB to promote MreB filament
  formation (right) to orient the PG produced by the activated synthase. For simplicity,
  MreD and RodZ are not shown but are also required for proper Rod system function,
  possibly by modulating the MreC-PBP2 interaction.
