caption: Links between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated
  degradation. The figure depicts the pathogenesis of AD and the resultant synaptic/cognitive
  dysfunction via Aβ and tau, the two main postulated mechanisms of AD. The connections
  between the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) and the components of the two pathways
  are indicated. Only key relevant features of AD pathogenesis are shown. Processes
  with a purely inhibitory effect are shown by red connectors. Negative regulatory
  mechanisms with potential for therapeutic intervention are shown by purple connectors.
  APP, amyloid precursor protein; s-APPβ, soluble N-terminal APP fragment; PDE3, phosphodiesterase
  3; PKA, Protein Kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase); Ub-tau, tau with attachment
  of many ubiquitin (Ub) molecules (i.e., polyubiquitinated tau); stars indicate phosphorylation;
  shapes with filled red circles with tails represent polyubiquitin attachment. Created
