caption: Model of the state of the art of  TWEAK and  TNFα in obesity and  T2D conditions.
  In obesity and T2D states, higher circulating levels of  TNFα and lower levels of
  sTWEAK have been observed. Additionally, obese adipose tissue is highly infiltrated
  with macrophages that could be a source of sTWEAK production and also express mTWEAK
  on the surface. The latter may establish a strong pro-inflammatory response in adipocytes
  where the Fn14 receptor is over-expressed and activates the NF-κB pathway. In contrast,
  sTWEAK has been identified as a negative regulator of  TNFα signaling since both
  signal via similar  TNFR-associated factors, including  TRAF2. Amelioration of 
  TNFα-induced insulin resistance by sTWEAK in obesity and  T2D could be a consequence,
  at least in part, of its direct regulation of JNK1/2 phosphorylation, controlled
  by PP2A phosphatase which is known to negatively regulate cytokine signaling. PPA2
  activation could thereby be linked to the protective role of sTWEAK during the development
  of insulin resistance. Thus it is tempting to speculate that in obesity and  T2D,
  the increase of mTWEAK and the decrease of sTWEAK may help to maintain the pro-inflammatory
  effect of  TNFα-driven response.
