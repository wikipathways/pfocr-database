caption: 'Model of self-regulation of the cAnsignaling pathway of type III-A CRISPR–Cas
  system. Recognition of the invasive transcript by the Csm complex triggers three
  catalytic activities: the Csm3-mediated cleavage of the invasive transcript, degradation
  of DNA template by the HD domain of Cas10, and synthesis of cA2–6 by the Palm domain
  of Cas10. The cA6 acts as a signaling molecule that binds to the CARF domain of
  the Csm6 ribonuclease and activates non-specific RNA degradation by the HEPN domain.
  CARF domain acts as ring nuclease that slowly converts cA6 into linear A6>p and
  finally into A3>p. Cleavage of the target RNA by Csm complex switches off cAnsynthesis
  by the Cas10 subunit. cA6 and A6>p remain bound to the CARF domain and activate
  the HEPN domain for degradation of cAns accumulated in the cell, thereby switching
  off signaling and restoring the pre-infection cell state.'
