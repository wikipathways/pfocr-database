caption: 'Proteins containing cysteine residues with a free thiol group can be modified
  through oxidation, glutathionylation, nitrosation, sulfhydration or sulfenation
  to modulate protein function. Many autophagy proteins have key modifiable cysteines
  including: 1) Autophagy initiation proteins (ATG 3, 4, 7 and 10); Recombinant ATG4
  activity has been shown to be regulated by hydrogen peroxide modification of Cys81.
  2) Modulators of the Beclin-VPS34 complex. RUBICON is a cysteine rich protein, and
  HMGB-1 is able to translocate to the cytosol, Cys106 modification is important for
  its translocation, Cys23-Cys45 disulfide bridge is important for its binding to
  BECN1. 3) The upstream autophagy signaling protein p53 has 2 cysteines that are
  prone to oxidative modification; and conserved cysteines in TOR can be oxidized.
  4) Mitophagy-related proteins such as PARKIN, which is modifiable by nitrosation
  or sulfhydration, and DJ-1, which can be modified by oxidation. Modification of
  cysteines on these proteins may present a redox based regulation of the autophagy
  pathway during diseases associated with increased oxidative or nitrosative stress.'
