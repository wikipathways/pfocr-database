caption: Metabolic pathway of sphingolipids. Normal serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)
  uses l-serine and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates to form 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine.
  Abnormal SPT associated with HSAN1 uses l-alanine instead of l-serine as substrates,
  resulting in deoxysphinganine formation. In variants associated with amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis (ALS), the abnormal SPT results in excessive production of sphynganines
  and ceramides, instead of deoxyphinganine formation. ASA arylsulfatase A, CERK ceramide
  kinase, CERS ceramide synthase, CGT ceramide galactosyltransferase, CST cerebroside
  sulfotransferase, DEGS dehydroceramide desaturase, GCS glucosylceramide synthase,
  3-KSR 3-ketosphinganine reductase, SGPP sphingosine 1-phosphate phosphatase, SPT
