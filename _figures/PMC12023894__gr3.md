caption: 'Natural compounds act on breast cancer (BC) through the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling
  pathway. (A) Natural compounds primarily inhibit the activation of key components
  in the Hh signaling pathway, thereby down-regulating the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT)-related proteins and suppressing the activation of the neurogenic
  locus notch homolog protein (Notch)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. This
  mechanism ultimately leads to the inhibition of the EMT process. (B) Natural compounds
  inhibit angiogenesis by directly inhibiting the expression of vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) or inhibiting the activation of the Hh signaling pathway by
  promoting ubiquitination-dependent degradation of smoothened (SMO). (C) Natural
  compounds overcome multidrug resistance in human BC cells by inhibiting Sonic Hedgehog
  (SHH) signaling and its downstream multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR-1)/P-gp expression.
  (D) Natural compounds can inhibit BC stemness by suppressing the Hh/protein kinase
  B (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) signaling pathway, promoting the
  phosphorylation of β-catenin, which in turn reduces the expression of CD44+ and
  CD24−. Phosphorylated β-catenin can decrease the downstream targets c-Myc and cyclin
  D1, thereby lowering the stemness of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Alternatively,
  these compounds can inhibit key components of the Hh signaling pathway, leading
  to a reduction in cancer stem cell markers such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH),
  octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), nanog homeobox (NANOG), and sex determining region
  Y-box 2 (SOX2), which also contributes to the decrease in BC stemness. (E) Natural
  compounds can inhibit the proliferation of BC cells by either suppressing the cell
  cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor wild-type p53-activated fragment 1 (p21Waf)/CDK-interacting
  protein 1 (Cip10 or inhibiting the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2),
  while promoting the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2-associated X protein
  (Bax). Additionally, they can suppress the invasion of BC cells by downregulating
  matrix metalloproteinases matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9
  (MMP-9). Furthermore, these compounds can enhance the activity of cysteine-aspartic
  acid protease 3 (caspase-3) and caspase-8, thereby inhibiting the migration of BC
  cells. PTCH1: patched 1; GLI1/2: GLI family zinc finger 1/2; JAGGED: jagged canonical
