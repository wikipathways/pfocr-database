caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway investigated in the present study.
  Salusin-β decreases adipoR1 expression, which reduces the phosphorylation of AMPK
  and ACC in cells. ACC promotes the synthesis of Malonyl-CoA, which inhibits CPT-1,
  reducing the transfer of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA from the cytoplasm to mitochondria,
  thus inhibiting fatty acid β-oxidation. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; adipoR1, adiponectin
  receptor 1; AMPK, 5′AMP-dependent protein kinase; CPT-1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase
  1; FFA, free fatty acid; p, phosphorylated; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex;
  shRNA, short hairpin RNA; siRNA, small interfering RNA
