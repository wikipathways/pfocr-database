caption: Proposed cellular mechanisms of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis occurs when the
  reduction of PL-PUFA (PE)-OOH via GPX4 is insufficient to prevent iron-mediated
  L-ROS accumulation. An important cysteine supply route for GSH synthesis is the
  import of cystine via the antiporter system Xc- (). An additional or alternative
  cysteine route is transsulphuration (1a). GSSG is reversed into GSH with the catalytic
  action of NADPH-dependent GR () generated in the penthose phosphate patway (2a).
  GSH is a cofactor of the GPX4 enzyme that prevents the accumulation of PL-PUFA(PE)-OOH
  by converting them to PL-PUFA(PE)-OH (), and in the process of GPX4 maturation participates
  IPP from the mevalonate pathway (3a). Free redox active iron is involved in the
  formation of L-ROS from membrane PL-PUFA(PE) through the Fenton reaction and oxidation
  by15-LOX-1 (). ACSL4 and LPCAT3 enzymes are involved in the formation of PL-PUFA
