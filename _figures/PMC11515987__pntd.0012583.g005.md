caption: Red in pie plot and histogram plot represented cluster 3 while blue represented
  cluster 1. Different colors of metabolites represented different sources of metabolites,
  which green meant microbiota-source and red meant host-source. The patterns in the
  background were intestine, which meant that metabolic pathways derived from gut
  microbiota could influence serum metabolites in blood vessels. Red up-arrows represented
  significant enrichment of microbes or genes or metabolites in cluster 1 compared
  to cluster 3 while blue down-arrows represented significant depletion. Full-line
  arrows showed that serum metabolites sourced from microbiota could be generated
  by gut microbiota-derived metabolic pathways mediated by functional genes. Dashed-line
  arrows meant that serum metabolites from different source had strong correlation
  with gut microbiota, but can’t find any microbiota-derived relevant differential
  functional genes

  description: Red in pie plot and histogram plot represented cluster 3 while blue
    represented cluster 1. Different colors of metabolites represented different sources
    of metabolites, which green meant microbiota-source and red meant host-source.
    The patterns in the background were intestine, which meant that metabolic pathways
    derived from gut microbiota could influence serum metabolites in blood vessels.
    Red up-arrows represented significant enrichment of microbes or genes or metabolites
    in cluster 1 compared to cluster 3 while blue down-arrows represented significant
    depletion. Full-line arrows showed that serum metabolites sourced from microbiota
    could be generated by gut microbiota-derived metabolic pathways mediated by functional
    genes. Dashed-line arrows meant that serum metabolites from different source had
    strong correlation with gut microbiota, but can’t find any microbiota-derived
