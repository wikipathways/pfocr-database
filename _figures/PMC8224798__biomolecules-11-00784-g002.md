caption: Endogenous PrPC in the kidneys plays a role in cellular signaling processes
  to influence renal physiology. (A) PrPC mediates a variety of downstream signaling
  pathways via interactions with appropriate binding partners in kidney tissues. There
  are numerous PrPC-signaling pathways that are characterized in neuronal cells, and
  some of these have been cross-validated in the kidney, while others have not. The
  signaling proteins and interaction mechanisms that merit further validation in renal
  models are shown in grayscale or dotted lines. (B) PrPC has been associated with
  some protective functions against ischemic injury through affecting the ERK1/2 transduction
  pathway and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). (C) PrPC exhibits ferrireductase activity to
  promote the uptake of transferrin- (Tf) and non-Tf-bound iron (NTBI) by the kidneys.
  Fe3+ ions are bound to transferrin, which can enter proximal tubular cells. PrPC
  ferrireductase activity produces Fe2+, which can be released into the cytoplasm
  through DMT1 and ZIP14.
