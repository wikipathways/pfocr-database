caption: Schematic depiction of lncRNA-p21/EZH2/STAT3 pathway. Enz treatment induces
  lncRNA-p21 expression via regulating the AR binding to the lncRNA-p21 promoter in
  PCa cells. Highly expressed lncRNA-p21 competes with Hotair to interact with EZH2
  and disrupt PRC2 complex (SUZ12 and EED). At the same time, lncRNA-p21 promotes
  AKT phosphorylated EZH2 on Serine 21 and enhances the STAT3 methylation by EZH2.
  The methylated STAT3 was activated and promotes the NED
