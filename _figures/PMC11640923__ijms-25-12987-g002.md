  Duodenal enterocytes acquire dietary iron both as inorganic iron and heme iron.
  At the luminal membrane, inorganic ferric iron (Fe3+) is reduced to ferrous iron
  (Fe2+) by the duodenal cytochrome b/cytochrome b reductase (DCYTB/CYBRD1) and transported
  into the cell by divalent metal transporter 1/solute carrier family 11 member 2
  (DMT1/SLC11A2). Heme iron is internalized through the heme carrier protein 1/solute
  carrier family 46 member 1 (HCP1/SLC46A1) and released in the cytoplasm as Fe2+
  by heme oxygenase 1 (HO1/HMOX1). Enterocytes store iron within ferritin or export
  iron at the basolateral membrane through ferroportin1/solute carrier family 40 member
  1 (FPN1/SLC40A1), whose function is negatively regulated by the master regulator
  of iron homeostasis hepcidin (HAMP), which is mainly secreted by hepatocytes. Iron
  released in the extracellular space is then oxidized by hephaestin (HEPH) and loaded
  onto transferrin (TF), which distributes iron as Fe3+ to tissues and cells through
  the circulation. In most cells, holo-TF interacts with the ubiquitous cell surface
  transferrin receptor (TFRC) and the complex is internalized by endocytosis. Within
  the endosomes, iron is released by acidification, reduced to Fe2+ by the six-transmembrane
  epithelial antigen of prostate 3 (STEAP3) ferrireductase and released in the cytoplasm
  by the divalent metal transporter 1/solute carrier family 11 member 2 (DMT1/SLC11A2).
  The apo-TF/TFRC complex is recycled to the cell surface and dissociated; TFRC remains
  in the membrane for further cycles of iron uptake, while TF is recycled in the circulation.
  Cytosolic iron is then delivered to the sites of usage or stored within ferritin.
  Mitochondria are the main site of iron cellular usage. Iron enters mitochondria
  through DMT1/SLC11A2, mitoferrin 1/solute carrier family 25 member 37 (MFN1/SLC25A37)
  and mitoferrin 2/solute carrier family 25 member 28 (MFN2/SLC25A28), and it is mainly
  used for the synthesis of heme and iron sulfur clusters (ISCs). Newly synthesized
  heme is transferred to mitochondrial heme-containing proteins or transported to
  the cytosol for transfer to cytosolic heme-containing proteins through the mitochondrial
  heme transporter feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1b (FLVCR1b). ISCs are
  assembled partly in the mitochondrion by the mitochondrial ISC assembly machinery
  and partly in the cytosol by the cytosolic ISC assembly machinery (CIA), which receives
  ISCs from mitochondria through the ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 7 (ABCB7)
  transporter. Excess mitochondrial iron is stored in mitochondrial ferritin (FTMT),
  while excess cytosolic iron is mainly stored in cytosolic ferritin, that may quickly
  release it for cellular needs through nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated
  ferritinophagy or by an autophagy-independent lysosomal pathway. Cellular iron excess
  may also exit cells through FPN1/SLC40A1, which is coupled with ferroxidase proteins
  like ceruloplasmin (CP) and HEPH
