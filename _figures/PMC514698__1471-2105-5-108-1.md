caption: Known Yeast Cell Cycle Interactions. Schematic of known yeast cell cycle
  interactions between protein products of the twelve genes we studied (Table 1).
  An arrow indicates a positive interaction and a closed circle indicates a negative
  interaction. A dashed line indicates a protein-protein (e.g., phosphorylation, etc.)
  interaction and solid lines indicate direct transcriptional regulation. Genes are
  shown adjacent to each other when they are treated as a cluster in the KEGG pathway
  diagram (in the case of SBF and MBF the genes code for protein subunits). A connection
  inside a cluster indicates regulation of the whole cluster simultaneously. The interactions
  are located along an approximate time axis through the stages of the cell cycle
  (G1, S, G2).
