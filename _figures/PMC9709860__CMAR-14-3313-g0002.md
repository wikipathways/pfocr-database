caption: The scheme demonstrates the HPV-induced cell cycle disruption. HPV E6 oncoprotein
  binds to p53 via E6AP and subsequently degrades it via a proteasome-mediated pathway.
  The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is functionally inactivated by the HPV E7 oncoprotein.
  The tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A encodes the p16INK4A protein, a cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor, which attaches and disrupts the cyclin D–CDK4 and cyclin D–CDK6
  complexes. Loss of CDKN2A and the commonly seen amplification of cyclin D1 (CCND1)
  drive cells through the G1–S checkpoint of the cell cycle and promote unscheduled
  DNA replication.
