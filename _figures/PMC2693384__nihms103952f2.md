caption: Binding of S1P to the SIP1 receptor stimulates the Gi-dependent recruitment
  of PI3 kinase, Tiam1 and Rac1 to lipid rafts (CEM), which serves to activate Rac1
  in a Gi-PI3K-Tiam1 dependent manner. In addition, S1P induces an increase in intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration via a Gi-PLC pathway with additional activation of Rac1. After
  the activation of Rac1, S1P induces a series of profound events including adherens
  junction and tight junction assembly, cytoskeletal reorganization, and formation
  of focal adhesions that combine to enhance vascular barrier function. Furthermore,
  the transactivation of S1P1signaling by other barrier enhancing agents is recently
  recognized as a common mechanism for promoting endothelial barrier function. TJ,
