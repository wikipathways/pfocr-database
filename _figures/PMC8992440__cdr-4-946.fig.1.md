caption: 'Irinotecan, the active metabolite, SN-38, and its glucuronide (A), and formation
  of inhibitory complex of Top1-DNA-SN-38 much more potent than irinotecan (B). In
  liver, irinotecan is bioactivated through hydrolysis catalyzed by carboxylesterases
  to be converted into SN-38, an active metabolite of irinotecan. SN-38 undergoes
  glucuronide conjugation to be SN-38 glucuronide by a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase,
  UGT1A1, for the detoxification pathway. SN-38 glucuronide is hydrolyzed by b-glucuronidase
  after being excreted in the gut. In the tumor cells, SN-38 can target the Top1-DNA
  covalent reaction intermediates and reversibly stabilize the Top1-DNA-SN-38 complex.
  As illustrated in (B), the collision of the DNA replication fork, together with
  this ternary complex formation, ultimately results in lethal and irreversible double-strand
  breaks[]. Top1: Topoisomerase I.'
