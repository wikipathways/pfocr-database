caption: Putative Nrf2 signaling pathway during long-term potentiation (LTP) in the
  CA1 region of the hippocampus. Membrane depolarization and glutamate binding to
  the postsynaptic membrane receptors induce N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
  activation, and result in Ca2+ entry into the postsynaptic membrane. Ca2+ activates
  calmodulin (CaM) and calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and
  results in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)
  phosphorylation. When glutamate binds to AMPAR, they become permeable to Na+, which
  is important for stable activation of NMDAR. Ca2+ activates MAP kinase pathways
  (Ras/Raf/MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Rsk), which phosphorylate cAMP response element-binding protein
  (CREB). CREB induces mRNA transcription for synapse growth. Extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases (ERK1/2) can phosphorylate nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2).
  Keap1 is a negative regulator of Nrf2. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) inactivate
  Keap1, which allows Nrf2 to become active. NADPH oxidase is an ROS source that can
  be activated by Ca2+, and is translocated into neurons via NMDA receptors.
