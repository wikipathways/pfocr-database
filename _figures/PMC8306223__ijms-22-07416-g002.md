caption: Functions and regulatory mechanisms of SETDB1 in different cancers. (A) The
  expression of SETDB1 differs in various cancers, indicating that SETDB1 may act
  as oncoprotein or tumour suppressor. (B) In lung cancer, SETDB1 was downregulated
  by self-mutation, miR-29s/SETDB1/TP53 circuitry, LINC00476, and miR-409-3p, while
  SETDB1 was upregulated under overexpression/amplification or induced by growth factor.
  SETDB1 facilitates the development of lung cancer by positively regulating SOD1,
  AKT methylation and the WNT/β-catenin pathway while negatively regulating the expression
  of FosB. Additionally, SETDB1 connects with SMAD2/3 and downregulates EMT biomarkers
  to repress the development of lung cancer.
