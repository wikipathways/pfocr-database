caption: Polyhydroxyalkanoate production in engineered E. coli. Engineered metabolic
  pathways for production of polyhydroxyalkanoate in recombinant E. coli. Genes involved
  in metabolic engineering and polyhydroxyalkanoate production pathway are shown.
  Pflb, pyruvate formate lyase; LdhA, d-lactate dehydrogenase; AdhE, acetaldehyde-alcohol
  dehydrogenase; Fnr, transcriptional regulator for expressing anaerobic metabolism;
  PntAB, transhydrogenase; BktB, β-ketothiolase; PhaB, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase;
  PhaC, polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase.
