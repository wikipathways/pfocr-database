caption: Involvement of TIR domain-containing adaptors in TLR signaling pathways.
  MyD88, or myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88, is an adaptor molecule
  that contains the Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domain. This adaptor
  mediates the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-signaling pathway, which in turn activates
  IRAKs, IL-1-receptor-associated kinases, and TRAF6, or the tumor necrosis factor
  receptor (IKK) complex, which is composed of IKK-α, IKK-β, and IKK-γ (also known
  as IKK1, IKK2, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) essential modulator, NEMO, respectively),
  is activated upon the activation of related factor 6. TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6,
  TLR7, and TLR9 all employ this pathway to liberate NF-κB from its inhibitor, allowing
  it to enter the nucleus and produce inflammatory cytokines. Through TLR2 and TLR4,
  the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway is mediated by TIR domain-containing adaptor
  protein (TIRAP), another TIR domain-containing adaptor protein. On the other hand,
  MyD88 is not required for the TLR3- and TLR4-mediated activation of interferon (IFN)-regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) or the induction of IFN-β. The MyD88-independent route requires
  TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor protein producing IFN-β), a third TIR domain-containing
  adaptor. IRF3 is activated downstream of TRIF via the nontypical IKKs IKK-ε and
  TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). TRAM,
  or TRIF-related adaptor molecule, is a fourth TIR domain-containing adaptor that
  is unique to the TLR4-mediated, MyD88-independent/TRIF-dependent pathway
