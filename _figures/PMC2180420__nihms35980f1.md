caption: LHR positive MA-10 cells expressing the myc-hLHR and myc-ERK2 and LHR negative
  I-10 cells expressing ERK2-GFP and EGFR-GFP were co-cultured as indicated. Human
  CG binds only to the LHR in MA-10 cells (arrow labeled A) and any changes in the
  phosphorylation of ERK2-GFP or EGFR-GFP must occur through an indirect effect that
  involves an hCG-dependent increase in the release of MA-10 cell soluble, diffusible
  factors that act on I-10 cells and/or an hCG-dependent increases in MA-10/I-10 cell
  contacts (arrow labeled B). In contrast the phosphorylation of myc-ERK2 can be mediated
  by an intracellular pathway directly stimulated by hCG in MA-10 cells (arrow labeled
  A) or by the indirect pathway involving increased cell contact or release of diffusible
  factors acting on the originating MA-10 cells (arrow labeled C).This figure is modified
  from a similar figure first published in reference [].
