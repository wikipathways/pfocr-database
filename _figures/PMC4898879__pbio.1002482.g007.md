caption: In response to blue light, M1 pRGC projections to the SCN result in activation
  of the adrenal gland via the ANS. This alertness promoting pathway is associated
  with corticosterone release and increased waking. This pathway is strongly activated
  by blue light due to the spectral sensitivity of melanopsin which peaks ~480 nm.
  Loss of melanopsin results in reduced activation of this pathway, resulting in enhanced
  sleep induction. Additional arousal-promoting pathways undoubtedly contribute to
  this response. By contrast, green light results in activation of the sleep-promoting
  VLPO pathway, most likely via non-M1 melanopsin pRGCs that are more dependent upon
  rod and cone input. As melanopsin plays a critical role in rod and cone adaptation,
  under bright light conditions, loss of melanopsin results in attenuated sleep induction
  via this pathway. Moreover, the resultant saturation of rod and cone pathways also
  results in a loss of chromatic responses.
