caption: Overview of the key genes and regulatory networks leading from the bi-potential
  gonad to either testis or ovary development in mouse. a Genes that are essential
  for the development of the bi-potential gonad have been identified due to the total
  lack of gonads in the corresponding knockout mouse strain and they have been shown
  to be expressed in the bi-potential gonad. Functional studies revealed that specifically
  the WT1 −KTS isoform binds to and activates the Nr5a1 promoter in conjunction with
  LHX9. In the spleen and adrenal gland, CBX2 has been shown to regulate Nr5a1, leading
  to the hypothesis of a similar function in the bi-potential gonad. b Various genes
  have been implicated in the pathways leading to testis development in mouse. In
  XY mouse embryos, Sry is transiently expressed in the bi-potential gonad, whereas
  in human embryos, SRY expression is periodic. However, in both species, Sry expression
  initiates an increase of Sox9 expression, which then stimulates Fgf9 expression.
  Both FGF9 and SOX9 act in a positive feedback loop, which act to suppress the female
  specific genes, especially Wnt4 and subsequently lead to the manifestation of the
  testis-specific program. Numerous other genes and their gene products, such as Gata4,
  Fog2, Wt1 (+KTS isoform), Nr5a1, Pgsd, Fgfr1, Cbx2, Sox8, Amh, Dax1, and Dhh are
  necessary for the regulation (positive as well as negative) and maintenance of this
  crucial male determining pathway. Dmrt1 has recently been shown to be required for
  the maintenance of gonadal sex, especially to prevent female reprogramming in postnatal
  mouse testis. c In XX individuals, Sry is absent and ovary-specific genes, such
  as Rspo1, Wnt4, and Foxl2 are expressed. Rspo1 −/− ovaries show reduced levels of
  WNT4, suggesting that Rspo1 acts upstream of Wnt4. However, a synergistic action
  of WNT4 and RSPO1 to activate β-catenin has also been suggested. WNT4/β-catenin
  have been proposed to suppress the SOX9/FGF9 positive feedback loop, allowing the
  ovarian-specific pathway to progress. WNT4 and FOXL2 are also involved in the positive
  regulation of Bmp2. Together, FOXL2, RSPO1, and WNT4 activate Fst expression. Genes
  of the female pathway that have been shown or suggested to interact with the male
  pathway are shown in red, genes of the male pathway interacting with the female
  pathway are highlighted in blue. In this figure, solid lines do not necessarily
  imply direct interactions. Question marks indicate that the position of that gene
  and the interaction with other genes has been proposed. Many pathways shown in this
  figure are similar or even identical between mouse and human; however, for some
  of them, there might be differences between the two species
