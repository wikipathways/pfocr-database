caption: 'Norepinephrine synthesis, storage, reuptake, and metabolism. In noradrenergic
  neurons, dopamine (DA) is produced in the cytoplasm as in dopaminergic neurons.
  Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) in the vesicles catalyzes the production of norepinephrine
  (NE) from DA. As for DA, cytoplasmic NE is subject to oxidative deamination catalyzed
  by monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) in the outer mitochondrial membrane, to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde
  (DOPEGAL). It should be noted that NE is a poorer substrate than DA for MAO of either
  isoform. DOPEGAL is converted to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) via aldehyde/aldose
  reductase (AR). A minor pathway (not shown) involves conversion of DOPEGAL to dihydroxymandelic
  acid via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). As for DA, most of vesicular NE released
  by exocytosis is taken back up into the cytoplasm via a cell membrane transporter—the
  cell membrane norepinephrine transporter (NET) for NE (although DA is a better substrate
  than NE for uptake via the NET). Theoretically, NE can be oxidized spontaneously
  to NE quinone and downstream oxidation products. Other abbreviations: LAAAD = L-aromatic-amino-acid
  decarboxylase; TH = tyrosine hydroxylase; TYR = tyrosine; VMAT = vesicular monoamine
  transporter.'
