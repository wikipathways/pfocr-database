caption: 'RecQ helicases in base excision repair (BER) and double-strand break repair
  (DSBR). (a) Summary of the BER pathway. Interactions between RecQ helicases and
  BER proteins are depicted by a green arrow (for activation) or a red bar (for inhibition).
  Asterisks after PARP1 and XRCC1 indicate that these genes are specifically downregulated
  by RECQL5 loss. The brown RecQ hexagon indicates that multiple RecQs interact with
  these proteins. (b) Summary of DSBR pathways. (i ) Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ).
  (ii ) Homologous recombination (HR). (iii ) Alternative (Alt)-NHEJ. The involvement
  of RecQ helicases in DSBR is depicted. Each RecQ helicase is represented as a colored
  hexagon. The colored hexagons are consistent with the coloring in . Other key proteins
  are shown as white ovals. DNA molecules are shown as blue/red or light blue/red
  duplexes. Dashed lines denote nascent DNA synthesis. Abbreviations: dHJ, double
  Holliday junction; dRP, deoxyribose phosphate; IR, ionizing radiation; MPG, methylpurine
  DNA glycosylase; P, 3′-phosphate; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; Pol,
  DNA polymerase; RFC, replication factor C; SDSA, synthesis-dependent strand annealing;
  Topo, topoisomerase; UA, 3′-α,β unsaturated aldehyde; UNG, uracil DNA glycosylase.'
