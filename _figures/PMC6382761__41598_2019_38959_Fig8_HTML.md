caption: Anti-metastasis effect of inotilone and the proposed signaling pathway. The
  LLC-bearing mouse model revealed the anti-cancer metastasis efficacy of inotilone.
  Inotilone also ameliorated the inflammatory state of the tumor’s microenvironment.
  The signaling pathways of anti-cancer metastasis affected by treatment with inotilone
  in A549 cells. Inotilone significantly decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expression
  and activity, which may suppress IL-8 production and the FAK, PI3K/AKT, MAPK and
  NFκB pathways. In addition, inotilone enhanced anti-oxidative enzyme activation.
  The above results suggest that the anti-metastatic activity of inotilone may be
  mediated through regulation of the enzymatic antioxidant system and MMP protein
  expression.
