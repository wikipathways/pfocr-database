caption: (A) C. elegans has a direct life cycle, with eggs developing through four
  larval stages into sexual adults. The larvae resemble the adults except in the lack
  of fully developed gonads, and their smaller size. The illustration shows the timing
  of developmental events at 25°C, with hours since fertilisation on the outside of
  the circle, and hours since hatching on the inside. Moults are indicated by solid
  black bars. In the hermaphrodite, the first ∼250 germ cells develop as sperm (after
  the L3 to L4 moult); later germ cells develop as oocytes. In conditions of overcrowding,
  starvation, or high temperature, C. elegans L1 commit to enter an alternate developmental
  pathway (via a lipid-storing alternate L2d) that results in the production of a
  diapausal dauer (“enduring”) L3d. The L3d is non-feeding, resistant to environmental
  insult, and displays arrested ageing. The L3d resumes development when exposed to
  sufficient food resources. Other nematodes also have a five-stage life cycle, punctuated
  by four moults, and many species, including parasites, also have a dauer-like L3
  stage. (B) The adult hermaphrodite anatomy is simply observed under light microscopy.
  Above is an adult animal (length ∼1 mm). In the cartoon below the major organ systems
  are indicated.
