caption: Protein trafficking routes. Extracellular proteins are targeted (as cargoes;
  C) to allow their internalization through plasma membrane (PM) invagination. Within
  the cell, the targeted cargo enters into the early endosome (EE) through membrane
  receptors, and is further redirected to the proper destination via 3 different routes.
  (I) The recycling route allows the transport of the cargo protein to the endosome
  recycling compartment (ERC), and from the ERC to the PM. Rab guanosine triphosphatases,
  such as Rab11 and Rab35, participate in the recycling. (II) Late endosome (LE) formation
  initiates cargo protein transport to the lysosome (LYS), where they are degraded
  by proteases. The process is mediated by the Rab5 to Rab7 switch, and by the endosomal
  sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). (III) In the retrograde pathway,
  the cargo is released from the EE. The retromer and retriever complexes facilitate
  cargo transport to the Golgi apparatus (GA; trans network), along the cytoskeleton
  (CSK). GTP = guanosine triphosphate. [Color figure can be viewed at www.annalsofneurology.org]
