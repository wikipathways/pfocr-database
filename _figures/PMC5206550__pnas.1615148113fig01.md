caption: 'Hypothetical representation of the link between the Hog1 MAPK and the lipid
  metabolic pathways activated in R. microsporus during symbiosis establishment. Genes
  are named according to S. cerevisiae nomenclature. Red circles and arrows represent
  genes up-regulated during symbiosis establishment; gray circles and black arrows
  depict genes not DE; dashed arrows represent unknown links, or uncertainty of precursor.
  In the metabolic pathway, names of the up-regulated genes are written adjacent to
  the metabolic conversions in which they are involved. Asterisks denote R. microsporus
  ATCC 52813 predicted protein annotations: DAG kinases (protein ID 315343 and 249146),
  phospholipases D (protein ID 277488 and 209457), and lipases (protein ID 249672,
  281243, and 250139). The well-characterized yeast lipid metabolic pathway was used
  in the construction of this figure (, , ).'
