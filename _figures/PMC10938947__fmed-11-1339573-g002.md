caption: Introduction of pathways related to bone regeneration, like WNT signaling
  pathway. (A) IHH binds to Smoothened homolog (SMO) to activate GLI2 activator (GLI2A)
  and to prevent the cleavage of GLI3-to-GLI3 repressor (GLI3R), thus leading to the
  formation of osteocytes. (B) Hydrolysis of Notch proteins is achieved by Notch binding
  to JAG or DLL, followed by Notch intracellular structural domain (NCID) binding
  to EGF repeats present in the ligand to affect the expression of downstream target
  genes, including the split hairy enhancer (Hes) and Hes associated with the YRPW
  motif (Hey). Hes1 and Hey1 prevent osteoblast differentiation and maturation and
  promote bone resorption by inhibiting Runx2 activity, where the expression of Hes1
  appears to be a key determinant of bone mass. (C) The FGF pathway activation begins
  with FGF binding to FGFR, with subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in
  the intracellular domain of FGFR, recruitment of various substrates, and activation
  of downstream pathways. This ultimately leads to cell proliferation, differentiation,
  and apoptosis
