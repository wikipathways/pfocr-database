caption: 'Proposed model of cell-wall remodeling by multistep STPK regulation of mycolic
  acid biogenesis. Phosphorylation of the mycobacterial de novo FA synthase FAS-I
  would lead to the reduced production of acyl-CoA pools, precursors of different
  lipids, including TGs, phospholipids (PLs), and MAs. For MA synthesis, proteins
  of the FAS-II-mediated FA elongation, chain activation (FadD32, AccA3/AccD5), and
  MA condensation (Pks13) to yield (after reduction by CmrA) TMMs are phosphorylated
  by PknB, resulting in decreased MA synthesis. Phosphorylation of MpmL3 impairs its
  TMM export to the outer membrane, leading to cytoplasmic TMM accumulation and a
  severe decrease in TDMs. TMM, the mycoloyl donor, is transferred by the mycoloyltransferases
  (Ag85 complex) to the biologically active mycolate-containing compounds (TDMs, glucose
  monomycolates, glycerol monomycolates), as well as to arabinogalactan to form the
  mycoloyl arabinogalactan peptidoglycan (mAGP) complex. The negative control of key
  enzymes in the MA biogenesis pathway, in addition to modulating TMM amounts, results
  in overall cell-wall remodeling. Red asterisks: PknB-regulated proteins identified
  and/or confirmed in this study.'
