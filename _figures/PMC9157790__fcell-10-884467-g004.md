caption: 'Molecular alterations in Wnt pathway components. Unlike colorectal cancer,
  direct alterations in β-catenin or β-catenin regulating proteins are virtually inexistent
  in TNBC. Notwithstanding, a significant proportion of TNBC patients display aberrant
  levels of β-catenin expression. While there is no clear answer to why, several possible
  mechanisms have been described to contribute to aberrant β-catenin levels in TNBC.
  These include the release of β-catenin from plasma membrane pools due to loss of
  CDH1, mutations or copy number aberrations (illustrative representation–REF: reference,
  CNV1: duplication of gene B, CNV2: deletion of gene D) in receptors and secreted
  Wnt agonists and antagonists, hypermethylation of promoters of genes encoding antagonists,
  expression of truncated antagonist receptors, etc.'
