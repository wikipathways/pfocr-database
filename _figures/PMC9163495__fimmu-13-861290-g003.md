caption: Effects of microglia and astrocyte activation on synaptic plasticity. Microglia
  sense changes in synaptic microenvironment and H+ accumulation activates a series
  of stress responses to shift microglia into activated state. These changes promote
  the transcription and expression of TXNIP, key enzymes of glycolysis and proinflammatory
  mediators (e.g.,TNF, IL-1β, HIF-1α, and PGE2). TXNIP is closely related to oxidative
  stress in producing ROS to increase cytomembrane permeability. Increased expression
  of key enzymes in glycolysis promotes lactate production and disrupts the balance
  of NAD+/NADH. An imbalanced NAD+/NADH ratio activates the NMDA receptor and increases
  Ca2+ influx to trigger downstream inflammatory cascade. Increased concentration
  of proinflammatory mediators in the vicinity of synapses promotes synaptic plasticity
  and polarization of microglia itself. Activation of NMDA receptors, Ca2+ influx
  and the downstream signaling cascade are regulated by SFKs and TrKB receptors. SFKs
  phosphorylates NMDA receptor subunits to promotes Zn2+ entry into postsynaptic neurons
  through NMDA receptor channels to activate the TrKBs/ERK pathway. Phosphorylation
  of TrKBs/ERK promotes autophagy, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. Astrocytes also
  sense the changes in synaptic microenvironment and activates the ERK/CREB signaling.
  Upon entering the nucleus, p-ERK activates p-CREB to initiate related gene transcription
  and promotes proliferation, activation, and polarization. Phosphorylation of ERK/CREB
  also enhances glycolysis and proinflammatory mediators, leading to the accumulation
  of lactate, glutamate, and serine. All together, these changes increase the excitability
  of postsynaptic neurons and contribute to central sensitization in neuropathic pain.

  description: Effects of microglia and astrocyte activation on synaptic plasticity.
    Microglia sense changes in synaptic microenvironment and H+ accumulation activates
    a series of stress responses to shift microglia into activated state. These changes
    promote the transcription and expression of TXNIP, key enzymes of glycolysis and
    proinflammatory mediators (e.g.,TNF, IL-1β, HIF-1α, and PGE2). TXNIP is closely
    related to oxidative stress in producing ROS to increase cytomembrane permeability.
    Increased expression of key enzymes in glycolysis promotes lactate production
    and disrupts the balance of NAD+/NADH. An imbalanced NAD+/NADH ratio activates
    the NMDA receptor and increases Ca2+ influx to trigger downstream inflammatory
    cascade. Increased concentration of proinflammatory mediators in the vicinity
    of synapses promotes synaptic plasticity and polarization of microglia itself.
    Activation of NMDA receptors, Ca2+ influx and the downstream signaling cascade
    are regulated by SFKs and TrKB receptors. SFKs phosphorylates NMDA receptor subunits
    to promotes Zn2+ entry into postsynaptic neurons through NMDA receptor channels
    to activate the TrKBs/ERK pathway. Phosphorylation of TrKBs/ERK promotes autophagy,
    apoptosis, and neuroinflammation. Astrocytes also sense the changes in synaptic
    microenvironment and activates the ERK/CREB signaling. Upon entering the nucleus,
    p-ERK activates p-CREB to initiate related gene transcription and promotes proliferation,
