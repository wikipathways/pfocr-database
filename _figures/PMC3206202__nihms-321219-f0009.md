caption: Differential association of 14-3-3 mediated signaling among genes induced
  during BIPM compared to the genes induced during MIPM.Canonical pathway diagram
  representing 14-3-3 mediated signaling pathways matched to the network eligible
  genes induced during BIPM (A) and network eligible genes induced during MIPM (B).
  Mitogen-activated protein kinase 5 (ASK1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
  tubulin, microtubule-associated protein tau (Tau) and c-Fos show significant association
  with this pathway in BIPM dataset. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), tubulin,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3A), protein kinase C (PKC) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan
  5-monooxygenase activation protein (14-3-3, YWHA1) show significant association
  with this pathway in the MIPM dataset. Red color nodes represent genes that appear
  in the bicuculline or mating dataset. Greater intensity of red represents a higher
  degree of upregulation.
