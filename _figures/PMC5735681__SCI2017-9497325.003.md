caption: The interaction between the Wnt and the Notch signaling pathways. (a) Wnt3a
  could upregulate the expression of the downstream target gene Hes1 of the Notch
  signaling pathway and inhibit the expression of Hes5 and then induce the proliferation
  of NSCs (the red arrows). The overexpression of Hes5 inhibited the Wnt signaling
  pathway, downregulated Mash1, and induced neuronal differentiation (the purple arrows).
  (b) The oscillatory expression of Ngn-2 could activate the Notch signaling pathway
  so that Hes1 was upregulated to promote the self-renewal of NSCs (the green arrows).
  The continuous expression of Ngn-2 inhibited the expression of Hes1 and promoted
  the differentiation of NSCs into neurons (the black arrows).
