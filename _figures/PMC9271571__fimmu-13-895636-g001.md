caption: 'Brief illustration of the activation and regulation of the two major NF-κB
  signaling pathway. The canonical pathway is induced downstream of the stimulation
  of LPS and cytokines. Such stimuli mediate the activation of IKK, consisting of
  three subunits: IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ, which in turn phosphorylates and elicits the
  ubiquitin dependent processing of IκB and p105, leading to the nuclear translocation
  of RelA/p50, c-Rel/p50, p50/p50 dimers and the regulation of target gene expression.
  The non-canonical pathway is induced downstream of TNFR superfamily. In the absence
  of stimuli, NIK undergoes ubiquitin-dependent degradation mediated by NIK ubiquitin
  ligase, composed of TRAF3, TRAF2 and cIAP1/2. Under stimuli, TRAF3 undergoes ubiquitin-dependent
  degradation, which allows the accumulation of NIK. NIK directly phosphorylates and
  activates IKKα, contributing to the phosphorylation and ubiquitin dependent processing
  of p100 to p52. The nuclear accumulation of p52/RelB dimers changes transcriptional
  activity of target genes. The excessive NIK can also be evacuated via negative feedback
  mechanisms. IKKα can phosphorylate NIK, resulting in the direct proteasome-mediated
  degradation without the involvement of NIK ubiquitin ligase. TBK1 downstream of
  CD40 and BAFF also phosphorylates NIK and induces degradation. LPS, lipopolysaccharides;
  IKK, IκB kinase; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; NIK, NF-κB inducing kinase;
  TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; BAFF, B-cell activating factor belonging to the TNF
  family.'
