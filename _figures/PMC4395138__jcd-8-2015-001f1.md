caption: Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. One of the major pathways
  for caspase activation is the extrinsic pathway. After apoptosis is initiated via
  death signal ligation in the cell membrane, a complex (DISC) is formed after FADD
  and procaspase-8 are recruited to the site. In type I cells, the DISC directly activates
  caspase-8; caspase-8 then activates effector caspases that go on to cleave substrates
  essential for survival. In type II cells, caspase-8 cleaves Bid, transforming it
  into the truncated and active form (tBid). tBid migrates to the mitochondria where
  it triggers the release of Bax/Bcl-2 and subsequently activates the intrinsic pathway.
  The other major apoptotic pathway for caspase activation is the intrinsic pathway.
  After toxic insults or DNA damage, the mitochondria releases cytochrome c, Apaf-1,
  and ATP into the cytosol of the cell, which lead to the formation of the apoptosome
  and the recruitment of procaspase-9. The apoptosome then activates procaspase-9,
  triggering the effector caspases and leading to the apoptotic destruction of the
  cell.
