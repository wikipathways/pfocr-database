caption: Permissive and non-permissive (antifungal) pulmonary phagocytes exhibit transcriptional
  differences in immune associated pathways. Using male and female BALB/c mice, phagocyte
  subsets were purified and incubated with C. neoformans strain H99 at 37째C, 5% CO2
  for 2hrs at a ratio of 20:1. Following incubation, cells were collected and stored
  in TriZol at -20째C until analysis. RNA purification and analysis was conducted by
  Novogene using SMARTer Stranded V2 library prep and samples were sequenced using
  the Illumina Platform. Differential expression analysis was compared between each
  macrophage and DC subset alone and following incubated with C. neoformans strain
  H99. Significant differences in gene expression were identified and grouped into
  signaling pathways using KEGG Pathway Analysis. (A, B). Up- and down-regulation
  of genes associated with male CD11b+ dendritic cells (DCs) within the cell adhesion
  molecules and antigen processing and presentation signaling pathways, respectively.
  (C, D). Up- and down-regulation of genes associated with female Ly6c- monocyte-like
  macrophages within the cell adhesion molecules and antigen processing and presentation
  signaling pathways, respectively. Blue and red represent genes up-regulated or down-regulated,
  respectively, in CD11b+ DCs and Ly6c- monocyte-like macrophages interacting with
  C. neoformans compared to the subset alone. Data were generated from a merged data
  set (n=2) from 2 independent female and 2 independent male mouse experiments.
