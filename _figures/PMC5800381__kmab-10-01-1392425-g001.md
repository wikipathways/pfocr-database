caption: 'Simplified schematic representation of four different types of airway inflammation
  in asthmatic patients. (A) Type 2 consists of allergic and nonallergic eosinophilic
  asthma. (a) In allergic eosinophilic asthma, T-helper type 2 (TH2) cell lymphocytes
  and mast cells drive eosinophilic airway inflammation in an allergen-specific, immunoglobulin
  E (IgE)-dependent manner. (b) In nonallergic eosinophilic asthma, innate lymphocytes
  such as natural killer T cells (NKT cells) and innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2)
  cells might contribute to airway eosinophilia via the production of interleukin
  (IL)-5, in response to pollutants or infectious agents. (B) Non-type 2 consists
  of neutrophilic and paucigranulocytic asthma. (c) The mechanisms underlying neutrophilic
  asthma need to be elucidated, but the IL-17 pathway and CXCL8 have been associated
  with the airway neutrophilia. More precisely, IL-17A and IL-17F play important roles
  in host responses to extracellular pathogens via the upregulation of antimicrobial
  proteins and induction of cytokines and chemokines involved in neutrophil expansion
  (e.g., GM-CSF) and recruitment (e.g., CXCR ligands). (d) Paucigranulocytic asthma
  has been poorly studied. It is thought to be not inflammatory and is characterized
  by the absence of increased numbers of inflammatory cells, suggesting the involvement
  of non-inflammatory mechanisms mediated by airway remodeling responses that lead
  to extensive airway narrowing. The biologics being evaluated in clinical trials
  or already approved as add-on treatment, on top of high-doses inhaled corticosteroid
  (ICS) and a short- or long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist (LABA), for (C) allergic
  and (D) nonallergic eosinophilic asthma are depicted in light grey. CRTH2: prostaglandin
