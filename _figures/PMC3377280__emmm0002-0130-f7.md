caption: During the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, HR is the preferred pathway
  to repair DSBs. Activated CHK1 stimulates repair by phosphorylating the RAD51 recombinase,
  while stalling the cell cycle by keeping CDK1 inactive. CDK1 inactivation is mediated
  by a number of pathways, including inactivation of CDC25 phosphatases and Wee1 kinase
  by CHK1.High levels of Aurora-A result in constitutive activation of the PLK1 kinase.
  Claspin is degraded upon phosphorylation by PLK1, an event normally restricted to
  the G2 checkpoint recovery phase. The inactivation of CHK1 that ensues weakens the
  response of HR protein, such as RAD51 accumulation to the DSBs. Consequently, DNA
  is repaired by the constitutively operative NHEJ pathway. The shortening of the
  cell cycle arrest observed in Aurora-A overexpressing cells after irradiation might
  be a result of both the activation of a faster DNA repair process, such as the NHEJ
  pathway and the stimulation of CDK1.
