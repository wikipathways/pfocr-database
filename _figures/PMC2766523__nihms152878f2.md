caption: A complete response of Medicago truncatula to Nod factor (NF) from Sinorhizobium
  meliloti requires multiple extracellular-domain-containing cell-surface receptors,
  including the LysM family receptors MtNFP and MtLYK3/HCL. DMI2 encodes a leucine-rich-repeat
  receptor kinase that is localized to the membrane and is required for tight root
  hair curling around the bacteria. Downstream of NF, DMI1 encodes a ligand-gated
  ion channel that localizes to the nuclear membrane. DMI3 encodes a Ca2+–calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase that is required for the induction of cell division in the root cortex
  and for the transcriptional changes required for the establishment of the symbiosis.
  Two GRAS family transcriptional regulators, nodulation signalling pathway 1 (NSP1)
  and NSP2, are also required for Nod-factor-induced transcriptional changes. The
  response to NF also involves Ca2+ spiking.
