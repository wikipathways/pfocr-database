caption: Pathway analysis of cytokine/chemokine driven JAK-STAT pathway in transgenic
  spleen. The RPKM ratio of DEGs from spleen was sprayed to custom-made cytokine and
  chemokine mediated JAK-STAT pathway. The red and green heat-map denotes the up-
  or down-regulation respectively, and the numbers indicate folds change of each DEG.
  Eclipses refer to regular gene; dash rectangular boxes stand for kinases; diamonds
  indicate to transcription factors; single bundle refer to set AND set; double bundle
  refer to AND including sets plus subset. The pathway was customized by combination
  of KO04060 (cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction), KO04062 (chemokine signaling
  pathway) and KO04630 (JAK-STAT signaling pathway) from KEGG database. The down-stream
  STATs target genes were inquired from corresponding GO database as well as research
  conducted by Sakamoto et al. []
