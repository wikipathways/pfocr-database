caption: Aberrancies of the Wnt/β-catenin and RAS-ERK pathways and their cooperation
  in the tumorigenesis. Aberrant activations of the Wnt/β-catenin and RAS-ERK pathways
  caused by various mutations occur in various human cancers as described. When aberrancies
  of the two pathways occur together by mutations, such as APC and KRAS, they cooperate
  in the tumorigenesis and that results in the enhancements of the tumorigenesis at
  different stages of CRC (colorectal cancer), including initiation, progression,
  and metastasis, involving CSC (cancer stem cell) activation. Red star, gain-of-function
  mutation; Blue star, loss-of-function mutation
