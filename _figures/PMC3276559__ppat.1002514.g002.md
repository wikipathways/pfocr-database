caption: The diagrams illustrate metabolic pathways that produce (arrow pointing towards
  acetyl-CoA) or utilise (arrow pointing away from acetyl-CoA) acetyl-CoA. Transcript
  abundance was compared in those genes from each pathway that encode enzymes that
  directly utilise or produce acetyl-CoA A. Guy11 germinating conidia (4 h) and Guy11
  mycelium grown in complete medium. B. Δpmk1 germinating conidia (4 h) and Guy11
  germinating conidia (4 h). The diagrams also show which pathways contain genes significantly
  more highly expressed in one condition as compared to the other (see key for each
  diagram). These are based on adjusted P-value< = 0.05 for at least one of the genes
  in each pathway.
