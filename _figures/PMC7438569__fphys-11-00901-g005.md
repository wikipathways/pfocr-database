caption: Mechanisms of cardioprotection from NAD+ repletion. Pathological stimuli
  that predispose the heart to SCD-associated CVD may result in reduced activity of
  NAMPT and increased activities of CD38 and PARP, which leads to NAD+ depletion and
  disease progression. Repletion of NAD+ by supplementation of NAD+ boosters confers
  cardioprotective effects through multiple signaling pathways. NAD+ repletion enhances
  catabolism and stimulates ATP production resulting in downregulation of AMPK, which
  prevents overactivation of autophagy, promotes the PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 pro-survival
  kinase pathways (RISK pathways), and inhibits the mPTP-induced cell death. NAD+
  repletion also activates SIRT1/FOXO1/MnSOD pathway that increases the clearance
  of ROS, SIRT3-dependent mitochondrial protein deacetylation that restores mitochondrial
  function and SIRT7-dependent deacetylation of GATA4 which inhibits hypertrophy-related
  gene expression. These mechanisms lead to reduced myocardial injury and hypertrophic
  remodeling as well as improved cardiac function. In addition, NAD+ repletion activates
  CD38-mediated Ca2+signaling and PKC-dependent phosphorylation which improves the
  function of cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5 and lowers the risk for arrhythmia.
