caption: Besides Dickinson’s first allenamide synthesis (), Bogentoft reported another
  earlier example of allenamide synthesis (). Allenamide 2 was prepared in 50% yield
  via a base-induced isomerization of propargyl amide 1. Per-hydrogenation of allenamide
  2 was also reported to give alkyl amide 3. In addition, under basic conditions,
  a mixture of oxazole 4 and oxo-quinazoline 6 could be obtained via C-O (pathway
  a) and C-N (pathway b) bond formation, respectively, from a ring-opened intermediate
  5.
