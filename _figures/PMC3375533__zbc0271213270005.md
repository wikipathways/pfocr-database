caption: 'A proposed model of CymR-based oxidation stress sensing, response, and virulence
  regulation in S. aureus. When S. aureus is exposed to ROS, the redox potential equilibrium
  will be disrupted. Meanwhile, CymR senses the oxidative stress through oxidation
  of the active cysteine and then dissociates from DNA, which may activate two distinct
  pathways: cysteine biosynthesis/ROS detoxification pathway and the virulence regulation
  pathway. In the cysteine biosynthesis and ROS detoxification pathway, mccAB, tcyP,
  cysM, and other genes with similar functions are induced and restore the redox equilibrium
  in cytoplasm. In the virulence regulation pathway, upon sensing oxidative stress
  by CymR, S. aureus may turn down its virulence gene expression and convert itself
  into a form more resistant to host killing.'
