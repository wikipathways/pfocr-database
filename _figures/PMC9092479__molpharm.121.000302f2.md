caption: mTORC1 senses two different amino acid signaling cascades. (A) The Rag-dependent
  signaling pathway is stimulated by amino acids such as Ala, His, Ser, Met, Thr,
  Val, Leu, and Arg and converges on the Rag GTPases. Following activation, RagA or
  RagB is GTP bound and heterodimerizes with RagC or RagD. Rag GTPase heterodimer
  directly interacts with the Raptor subunit of the mTORC1 at the lysosome. Finally,
  Rheb activates the mTORC1. (B) The Rag-independent signaling pathway is stimulated
  by the addition of amino acids such as Gln and Asn. The small GTPase adenosine diphosphate
  ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), vacuolar H+-ATPase (v-ATPase), and Rheb are necessary
  components of the Rag GTPase independent pathway. The cycling of Arf1 to a GTP-bound
  state through guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and GDP-bound state through
  GTPase activating protein (GAP) promotes mTORC1 activation and lysosomal localization.
  v-ATPase is present at the lysosome and required for amino acid signaling to mTORC1
  for both pathways.
