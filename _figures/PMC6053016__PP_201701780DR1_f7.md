caption: Proposed model of PI3K signaling network in algae under N starvation based
  on relative gene expression in T411 and its unique physiology. Changes in the relative
  mRNA levels of genes identified in the PI3K signaling pathway in T411 under −N conditions
  compared to wild-type cells grown in the same conditions. Genes and pathways denoted
  in blue are downregulated and those in red are upregulated in T411. In case of pathways,
  colors denote the response of the majority of genes. For detailed gene annotation,
  please refer to Supplemental Table S5.
