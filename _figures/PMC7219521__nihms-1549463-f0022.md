  B. Design of AAV9 rescue experiment. 1-month-old CM-KO or Control male mice were
  injected with either AAV9 TnT-GFP or AAV9 TnT-MEK1-CA via jugular vein. Echocardiography
  was performed before and after the injection at indicated time points to assess
  heart function. C-E. Protein expression of ERK phosphorylation, GFP and HA by Western
  blot. C. Representative immunoblot showing expression of p-ERK, t-ERK, GFP and HA.

  n=5. F-G. Echocardiographic analysis of heart function of all experimental groups.

  analysis with Turkey’s test. H-K. Protein expression of regulators in apoptotic
  pathway were measured with Western blot. H. Representative immunoblot showing expression
  of BCL-XL and BAX. I-K. Quantification of BAX, BCL-XL expression, and BAX/BCL-XL
