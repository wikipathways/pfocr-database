caption: Carbon-cycling metabolic pathways identified for a) Bacteria and b) Archaeal
  Euryarchaeota (Blue) and Crenarchaeota-related (Green) lineages at different depths
  for BCK1 sediment core. Relative signal intensity was normalized by the number of
  the probes for each indicated metabolic pathway. List of targeted genes for each
  category are provided in .
