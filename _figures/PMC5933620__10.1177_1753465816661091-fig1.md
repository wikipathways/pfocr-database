caption: Mechanism of action of nivolumab.The TCR signaling pathway is a major component
  of immune defense against tumors. Under normal circumstances, TCR recognition of
  the MHC on APCs will trigger a cascade of events causing activation of T cells and
  thus immune response against tumor cells. This signal is inhibited by tumor cells
  with activation of the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor co-signaling pathway, which ameliorates
  T-cell activation. Nivolumab acts by binding onto the PD-L1 on T cells, thus preventing
  inhibitor co-signaling and restoring T-cell activation.APC, antigen presenting cell;
  MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PD-1, programmed death-1; PD-L1, programmed
  death-1 ligand; TCR, T-cell receptor.
