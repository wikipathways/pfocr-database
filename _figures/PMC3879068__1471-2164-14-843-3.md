caption: 'Networks showing metabolic pathways differentially modulated between H and
  L groups. A: Diagram of the different expression between H and L groups of the main
  genes affecting de novo FA synthesis pathway. B: Global IPA network of genes associated
  with lipid metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism and small molecule biochemistry.
  Biological association of 35 focus genes as a graphical representation of the molecular
  relationship (edges) between genes/gene products (nodes). The intensity of the node
  color indicates the degree of expression: (red) up-regulated and (green) down-regulated
  in the H group relative to the L group. The shape of nodes indicates the functional
  classes of the gene products. Genes highlighted in orange are those genes related
  to lipid metabolism.'
