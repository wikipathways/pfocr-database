caption: Interaction network pathway analysis of circulating omega-3 and omega-6 oxylipins
  (n = 98). The networks depict the differences of each lipid mediator between high
  versus low tertiles of plasma succinate levels. Compounds that were not detected
  (ND) or not measured (NM) with the LC–MS/MS method are shown without boxes. Blue
  boxes with yellow borderlines indicate that this lipid mediator was higher in high
  versus the low succinate group, whereas red boxes with yellow borderlines indicate
  that this lipid mediator was lower in the comparison. Boxes without yellow borderlines
  indicate that this lipid mediator did not significantly change in the comparison.
  Fold-change values are depicted according to the legend bar on the right side. Intermediate
  enzymes are represented in green, and they were not measured. Comparisons are performed
  with independent t-test analysis (log10 transformed values) and P < 0.05
