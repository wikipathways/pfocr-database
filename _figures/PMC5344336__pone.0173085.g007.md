caption: When GPER is activated by G-1, it activates Gs protein. Gs stimulates adenlylyl
  cyclase (AC) and increases cAMP generation. Cyclic AMP activates both Epac and PKA,
  the downstream targets. Epac activates Rap1, then RhoA is phosphorylated at serine
  188 by both Rap1 signaling and PKA, thereby the activity RhoA and its effector Rho
  Kinase (ROCK) is inhibited, Reduced Rho kinase activity removes its inhibitory effects
  on MLCP by decreasing the phosphorylation of MYPT1 (pThr853), the myosin phosphatase
  target subunit 1 of MLCP, leading to decreased phosphorylation of MLC20 and coronary
  artery relaxation.
