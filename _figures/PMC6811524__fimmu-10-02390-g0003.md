caption: Canonical Wnt signaling manipulation during bacterial infection of epithelial
  cells. (A) S. enterica infection of intestinal epithelial cells inhibits Wnt signaling
  through an unknown mechanism (left). Activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP,
  which targets both β-catenin and IκBα for proteasomal degradation, stabilizes NF-κB
  levels which causes nuclear translocation of the protein and expression of pro-inflammatory
  target genes. Wnt signaling is also inhibited in the GVB during infection, promoting
  bacterial access to vasculature by increasing vascular permeability. S. enterica
  secretes the T3SS effectors AvrA and SopB into intestinal M cells and crypt-localized
  epithelial cells which causes activation of canonical Wnt signaling (right). Deubiquitinase
  AvrA and phosphatase SopB induce pathway activation through reversal of β-catenin
  posttranslational modifications, promoting expression of β-catenin-dependent genes
  that drive EMT in M cells, induce intestinal stem cell proliferation, and inhibit
  NF-κB activity in stem cells. (B) C. trachomatis infection of reproductive tract
  epithelium induces breakdown of adherens junctions and accumulation of β-catenin
  in the cytoplasm (left). β-catenin localizes to the chlamydial inclusion and translocates
  into the nucleus to activate transcription. Pathway activity promotes the bacterial
  developmental cycle through unknown mechanisms as well as drives expression of OLFM4
  which is known to inhibit NF-κB signaling. C. pneumoniae expresses inclusion membrane
  protein Cpn1027 during infection of respiratory epithelium (right). Cpn1027 recruits
  Caprin2, a scaffold protein of the β-catenin destruction complex, as well as GSK3β,
  thereby reducing β-catenin turnover and allowing nuclear translocation for expression
  of target gene BCL2 to inhibit host cell apoptosis.
