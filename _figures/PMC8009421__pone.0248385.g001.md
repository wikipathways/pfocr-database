caption: Organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster in S. sviceus and proposed
  enzymatic steps involved in the synthesis of desferrioxamine B. Genes encoding the
  four desferrioxamine biosynthetic enzymes are in black (desA, desB, desC, and desD)
  and genes involved in ferrioxamine uptake and utilization are in grey (desE and
  desF).
