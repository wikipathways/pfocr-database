caption: CDO catalyses the first step in the CSAD pathway, cysteine→CSA→hypotaurine→taurine
  (highlighted in boldface), and shunts cysteine towards the production of CSA, pyruvate,
  sulphate, hypotaurine and taurine. For the purpose of clarity, multistep pathways
  apart from the CSAD route have been condensed to a single arrow. ‘?’, unidentified
  enzyme.
