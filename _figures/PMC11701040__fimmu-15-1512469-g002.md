caption: 'Mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction drives the development of
  chemotolerance in colorectal cancer (CRC): mitochondrial dysfunction drives CRC
  cell proliferation and chemotolerance. This is mainly through the activation of
  the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms described above. RASG 1 mutations
  activate the BRAF-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, leading to phosphorylation of Drp1
  (S616), which induces mitochondrial fission and cell proliferation. ERK 1/2 signaling
  regulates mitochondrial apoptosis through RAGE and IQGAP1.Mitochondrial fission
  and dysfunction through pathways involving β-catenin, miR-27α/miR-17-5p, and MTFR2
  would further promote CRC cell proliferation and chemotolerance. Drugs also affect
  Drp1 activity through multiple pathways, including CDK1, OTUD6A and PKA-mediated
  phosphorylation. Further enhancement of the above signaling pathway expression'
