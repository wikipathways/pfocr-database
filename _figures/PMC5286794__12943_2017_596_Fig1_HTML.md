caption: Regulation of key cancer stem cell signaling pathways by epigenetic mechanisms.
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling can be enhanced by decreased expression of the DKK1 inhibitor
  through promoter hypermethylation and increased H3K27me3 and decreased H3K16 acetylation
  marks. Notch signaling target genes such as Hes1 and Hes5 can be activated by inhibition
  of H3K27 inhibitory methylation mark at their promoter region by STRAP. Hedgehog
  signaling pathway can be activated in CSCs epigenetically by Shh promoter hypomethylation
  and increase HDAC1 expression. Epigenetic deregulation of CSC-related signaling
  pathways allows cancer cells to acquire self-renewal ability and drug resistance
  properties
