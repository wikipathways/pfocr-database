caption: 'Proposed mechanisms underpinning the beneficial neurological action of glucagon-like
  peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (R) agonists. The GLP-1R, a class B1 G-protein-coupled
  receptor, is present on numerous cells within the nervous system—including throughout
  the brain on multiple types of neurons as well as on astrocytes and microglia. GLP-1,
  chiefly generated by L cells within the gastrointestinal tract, is also produced
  by select preproglucagon neurons that are primarily localized to the nucleus of
  the solitary tract within the hind brain—providing projections to extensive brain
  areas. Notably, GLP-1 appears also be generated by M2 microglia to potentially provide
  reparative/anti-inflammatory actions. Endogenous GLP-1 and/or long-acting GLP-1
  agonists gaining access to the brain can provide neurotrophic/protective actions
  that are mediated via GLP-1R binding and activation (as such actions are lost in
  the presence of GLP-1R antagonists and in GLP-1R knockout studies,,). Stimulation
  of the GLP-1R results to a rapid rise in intracellular cAMP levels, which then activates
  protein kinase A and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K); phosphorylating and activating
  a variety of downstream signalling pathways. These can be broadly subdivided into
  2 divisons: the mitogen-associated protein kinase/extracellular signal–regulated
  kinase and PI3K/protein kinase B pathways. These modulate multiple intracellular
  events including augmenting protein synthesis, cellular proliferation (neurogenesis),
  mitochondrial biogenesis and inhibiting apoptosis, inflammation, and protein aggregation.
  Both singly and in combination these pathways can lead to improved cell survival
  and a more robust cellular phenoype. cAMP, cyclic AMP; CREB, cAMP response element-binding
  protein; FoxO1/O3, forkhead box O1/O3; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase 3 β; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells.'
