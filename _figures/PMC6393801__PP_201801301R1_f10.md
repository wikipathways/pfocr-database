caption: Proposed model of extracellular ATP signaling pathway to the defense-related
  transcriptome. Once extracellular ATP binds to the P2K1 receptor on the plasma membrane,
  which induces the autophosphorylation of the receptor and transphosphorylation of
  downstream targets (), the activated P2K1 receptor results in transcriptional reprogramming
  of 542 genes. More than half of the ATP-responsive genes required signaling by one
  or more of the pathways through EIN2, NPR1, and COI1, for example, 154 genes in
  the COI1-dependent pathway, 21 genes in the NPR1-dependent pathway, six genes in
  the EIN2-dependent pathway, and 129 genes in the codependent signaling pathway.
  The other half of the ATP-responsive genes (233 genes) are independent of COI1/NPR1/EIN2-mediated
  pathways, the putative ATP-specific pathway. Many of the ATP-responsive genes are
  regulated under the participation of MYC and CAMTA transcription factors. KD, Kinase
  domain; Lec, lectin domain; tm, transmembrane domain.
