caption: Aberrant levels of coagulation factors are found in IBD patients that may
  lead to hypercoagulability. The coagulation cascade can be devided in an intrinsic,
  extrinsic and common pathway. Fibrinolysis (Fibrinolytic system) and thrombin generation
  (Thrombin-generating system) takes also part in the coagulation system []. Within
  the extrinsic pathway, higher levels of factor VIIa has been been found in IBD patients
  vs. quiescent patients [] while in the intrinsic pathway, Factors XIa and IXa were
  found elevated in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients vs. patients with inactive UC
  []. Additionally, Factors Va and Xa of the common pathway showed higher levels in
  active vs. inactive UC []. Within the thrombin generating system, prothrombin fragments
  1+2 (F1+2) and the thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) were also significantly elevated
  in IBD patients vs. patients in quiescent phase [] whereas thrombin inhibitor antithrombin
  III was decreased []. Within the fibrinolytic system, inhibitor of plasminogen activator-1
  (PAI-1) and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) were increased while
  tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was decreased in IBD patients vs. healthy controls
  [, , ] suggesting promotion of prothrombotic mechanisms in IBD.
