caption: 'The WNT/β-catenin pathway and the Warburg effect. WNT ligands bind with
  the Frizzled/LRP 5/6 receptor complex, leading to LRP phosphorylation of the AXIN/APC/GSK-3β
  complex. β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm to translocate to the nucleus. The
  WNT-process transcription activity is then stimulated. MCT-1 enhances lactate release
  out of the cell. The stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is associated with the
  activation of the glucose process. Increased levels of aerobic glycolysis are associated
  with higher lactate production and a decrease in mitochondrial respiration. HIF-1α
  activation leads to the cytoplasmic pyruvate being shunted into lactate by MDH-A
  induction. The pyruvate cannot then be fully converted into acetyl-CoA and enter
  the TCA cycle. The entry of glucose into the TCA cycle is modulated by the pyruvate
  dehydrogenase complex (PDH). A decrease in PDH inhibits the activity of the mitochondria
  in several cancers []. In tumor cells, the activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway
  enhances aerobic glycolysis []. PDK-1 is activated in vitro and in living colon
  tumor cells [] and there is a decrease in the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA
  in mitochondria []. PDK-1, LDH-A and MCT-1 are stimulated in cancer cells [,]. c-Myc
  and cyclin D1 also stimulate aerobic glycolysis []. The activation of c-Myc and
  PI3K/Akt signaling leads to the stimulation of HIF-1α activity, which inhibits glucose
  entry into the TCA cycle [,]. The stimulation of HIF-1α increases the expression
  of Glut, HK, PK, PDK-1 and LDH-A [,,]. Glut allows the entry of glucose into the
  cytoplasm where glycolysis ensues. HK phosphorylates glucose during the first stage
  of glycolysis. PK controls the production of pyruvate during the last stage of glycolysis.
  PDH stimulates the entry of pyruvate into the oxidative phosphorylation process
  and thus the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle within the mitochondria. Activation
  of HIF-1α stimulates PDK-1, inactivating PDH. The stimulation of LDH-A leads to
  the conversion of pyruvate into lactate. Abbreviations: GSK: glycogen synthase kinase,
