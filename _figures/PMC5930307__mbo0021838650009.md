caption: Model of envelope stress-mediated downregulation of flagellar gene expression.
  Cell envelope stress signals are sensed in the LPS mutant background by various
  sensory systems located in the membrane. The signal may be transmitted (i) directly
  via the alternative cell envelope stress sigma factor σ24, which is encoded by the
  rpoE gene, (ii) indirectly by enhancing transcription of rpoE, (iii) via the Rcs
  signaling pathway by phosphorylating RcsB, or (iv) via an unknown sensor and signaling
  pathway. RflP expression is then increased directly by σ24 via the activity of a
  σ24 binding sequence in the promoter region of rflP, by direct or indirect induction
  by RcsB-P, or by other factors. Increased levels of RflP protein led to degradation
  of the flagellar master regulator protein complex FlhD4C2 via ClpXP protease and
  subsequent downregulation of flagellar synthesis. Genes are indicated by gray boxes,
  and gene names are in italics.
