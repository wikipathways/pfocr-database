caption: (A) After harvesting strains at the exponential phase in 0.2× LB medium,
  transcriptome analyses of Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP), the TCA cycle, and l-Pro
  relative biosynthesis or the metabolism pathway in PM-14 were compared with those
  of the wild type (WT), with red and blue circles representing positive (up-regulated
  genes) and negative (down-regulated genes) values, respectively, calculated in reads
  per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads of PM-14/wild type (in log2).
  (B) qRT-PCR verification of key genes in the l-Pro biosynthesis pathway of both
  PM-14 and LK-18, followed by a conceptual map of l-Pro overproduction. G6P, 6-phosphoglucose;
  F6P, 6-phosphofructose; FBP, 1,6-bisphosphofructose; GAP, 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde;
