caption: 'Dysregulated cholesterol homeostasis drives inflammasome activation. (A)
  Left: Phagocytosis of cholesterol crystals by macrophages can cause damage/rupture
  of the lysosome. This releases lysosomal contents into the cytosol, and proteins
  such as cathepsins can subsequently cause cellular damage that is sensed by the
  NLRP3 inflammasome. Middle: Upon bacterial sensing, macrophages produce the oxysterol
  25-HC in order to maintain inhibition of the SREBP2 cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.
  Macrophages that are impaired for 25-HC production have excess cholesterol, which
  drives mitochondrial damage and activation of the AIM2 inflammasome via mitochondrial
  DNA. Right: Macrophages utilize ABCA1/ABCG1 to promote cholesterol efflux to HDL.
  Deletion of ABCA1/ABCG1 in myeloid cells causes cholesterol buildup and subsequent
  triggering of the NLRP3 inflammasome. (B) Diagram suggesting possible connection
  between altered cholesterol homeostasis resulting from pathogen infection or altered
  organismal metabolic status and engagement of innate immune sensors and inflammation.
  HDL = High density lipoprotein, 25-HC = 25-hydroxycholesterol'
