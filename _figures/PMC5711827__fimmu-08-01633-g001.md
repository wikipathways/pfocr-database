caption: Innate immune signaling pathways that drive type I IFN responses in mycobacteria-infected
  host cells. During infection, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis ESX-1 secretion system
  facilitates disruption of the phagosomal membrane contributing to mitochondrial
  stress and leakage of mycobacterial products into the cytosol. These products include
  the cyclic dinucleotides cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) and cyclic
  diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), DNA, and N-glycolylated muramyl dipeptide
  (MDP). Recognition of cytosolic mitochondrial and mycobacterial DNA by cyclic GMP-AMP
  synthase (cGAS) initiates formation of the second messenger cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP).
  cGAMP and bacterial cyclic dinucleotides interact with dimeric STING on the endoplasmic
  reticulum or the STING-accessory molecule DDX41. STING activation and relocation
  to the perinuclear Golgi initiates recruitment and activation of TANK-binding kinase
  1 (TBK1), and possibly also IKKε. Subsequent activation and nuclear translocation
  of the functionally active dimeric transcription factors interferon regulatory factor
  (IRF)3 and NF-κB drives expression of type I IFNs. cGAMP may also access uninfected
  cells via gap junctions, triggering STING activation and type I IFN expression in
  bystander cells. MDP is recognized by NOD2, which leads to RIP2-mediated activation
  of TBK1, culminating in IRF5 dimerization and nuclear translocation. M. tuberculosis
  isolate BTB 02-171 induces type I IFN expression dependent on TLR4. It is inferred
  that the induction pathway is similar to the known toll-like receptor (TLR)4 endosomal
  signaling pathway. However, this awaits experimental confirmation. Mycobacterium
  bovis Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) lacks ESX-1, yet, can elicit type I IFN expression.
  Cyclic dinucleotide-mediated STING activation independent of ESX-1 has been described.
