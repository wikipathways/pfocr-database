caption: BMSC-Exos ameliorate other CVDs. (A) BMSC-Exos alleviate DIC. miR-96 carried
  by BMSC-Exos targets and inhibits the Rac1/NF-κB signaling axis, suppressing oxidative
  stress and inflammation. lncRNA MSTRG.58791.2 in BMSC-Exos can inhibit inflammation.
  BMSC-Exos can also regulate the PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 and HMGB1/TLR4/NLRP3 pathways, reducing
  GSDMD expression and inhibiting DOX-induced CMCs pyroptosis and oxidative stress.
  lncRNA GHET1 in BMSC-Exos targets IGF2BP1 to reduce NLRP3 mRNA stability, ameliorating
  DOX-induced CMCs pyroptosis. (B) BMSC-Exos mitigate HF. BMSC-Exos can exert anti-fibrotic
  effects, inhibit CMCs hypertrophy and suppress inflammation by inducing myofibroblast
  senescence, inhibiting the Hippo-YAP signaling axis, or enhancing KLF4 expression.
  (C) BMSC-Exos improve AF. Nrf2-overexpressing BMSC-Exos can reduce cardiac fibrosis
  through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. miR-148a carried by BMSC-Exos targets and binds to
  SMOC2 mRNA to inhibit its expression, thereby suppressing CMCs apoptosis. (D) BMSC-Exos
  alleviate sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction. CircRTN4, miR-34a-5p and miR-141
  carried by BMSC-Exos can inhibit CMCs apoptosis by interacting with miR-497-5p to
  upregulate MG53, regulating the HMGB1/AMPK signaling pathway to reduce CMCs pyroptosis
  and binding and inhibiting PTEN expression to activate the β-catenin signaling axis,
  thereby alleviating inflammation and CMCs apoptosis. BMSC-Exos, bone marrow mesenchymal
