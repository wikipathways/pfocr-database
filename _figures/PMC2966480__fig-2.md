caption: Regulation of xenobiotic metabolism by AhR and NRF2. Xenobiotics are metabolized
  by cytochrome P450s (CYPs) into intermediates that are reactive or nonreactive.
  Reactive intermediates can be metabolized by cytoprotective enzymes into less-toxic
  and often readily excretable products. When activated by a ligand, AhR in the cytoplasm
  complexes with ARNT and translocates into the nucleus and induces the transcription
  of CYPs by binding to the xenobiotic response elements (XREs) in the promoters of
  target genes. NRF2 bound to KEAP1 in the cytoplasm translocates into the nucleus
  when the pathway is activated by exogenous or endogenous electrophilic or free radical
  stresses, and binds to the antioxidant response elements (AREs) to induce transcription
  of cytoprotective genes.
