caption: 'Anaerobic metabolic pathways in C. reinhardtii. Pathways at  the upper right
  are proposed for succinate production and NADH  reoxidation in the hydEF-1 mutant.
  Proteins encoded in the C.  reinhardtii genome that are associated with the metabolisms
  depicted  include the following: ACK, acetate kinase; ADH,  bifunctional acetylaldehyde/alcohol
  dehydrogenase (alcohol dehydrogenase only  in the case of the PDC pathway); FDX,
  ferredoxin; FMR,  fumarate reductase; FUM, fumarase; HYD, hydrogenase;  MDH, malate
  dehydrogenase; MME, malic enzyme; PAT,  phosphate acetyltransferase; PDC, pyruvate
  decarboxylase;  PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; PFL, pyruvate  formate-lyase;
  PFR, pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase; PYC,  pyruvate carboxylase; PYK, pyruvate
  kinase. Known or putative  cellular localizations of the proteins depicted are coded
  by color as follows:  green for the chloroplast, red for the mitochondrion,  orange
  for dual chloroplast/mitochondrion localization, blue  for cytoplasm, and black
  for unknown. The cellular localizations of  MDH1, -3, and -4, ACK2, PFL, and PAT1
  were experimentally determined by Allmer  et al. () and  Atteia et al. (),  respectively.
  The cellular localizations of the other enzymes were determined  using ChloroP,
  TargetP, and Predotar softwares and are highly speculative.  When possible a final
  predicted localization was determined by doing an  average of all predictions.'
