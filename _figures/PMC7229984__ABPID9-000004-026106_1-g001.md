caption: The genome-wide GBM pattern encodes human normal-to-tumor cell transformation
  via the Ras, Shh, and Notch pathways and includes most changes in chromosome numbers
  and focal CNAs that were known and at least as many that were unrecognized in GBM
  prior to its discovery. The genotype that the GBM pattern represents is depicted
  in a diagram of the WGS technology-filled in Notch pathway (yellow) in addition
  to the Agilent and Affymetrix microarray-described Ras and Shh pathways, including
  CNAs unrecognized in GBM prior to the discovery of the pattern (violet) and, among
  them, biochemically putative drug targets that are predicted to be correlated with
  survival (light blue). Shown are amplifications (red) and deletions (green) of genes
  and transcript variants (rectangles), either GBM- and LGA-shared (black) or GBM-specific
  (blue), and relationships that directly or indirectly lead to increased (arrows)
  or decreased (bars) activities of the genes and transcripts, the tumor suppressor
  proteins p53, Rb, and Ptch1, and the oncoproteins Notch1, Notch2, and the hominin-specific
  Notch2nl (circles).
