caption: Signaling cascade and recently described players in de-etiolation. This simplified
  model shows a basic overview of (A) the PHY/CRY-mediated light-responsive signaling
  cascade, and (B–F) recent discoveries in the field discussed in this review. The
  upper panel shows the etiolated state, the lower panel shows the changes that occur
  early upon de-etiolation. (A) Light is perceived by photoreceptors such as phytochromes
  (PHY) and cryptochromes (CRY), resulting in indirect activation of the expression
  of Elongated Hypocotyl5/HY5 Homolog (HY5/HYH)-dependent photomorphogenesis-related
  genes by repression of the COP1 complex. (B) Small RNAs (sRNA) modulate transcript
  accumulation of both light-signaling molecules and ownstream effector genes, and
  the sRNA pathway itself is also controlled via light signaling pathways. (C) TOR
  indirectly activates translation via auxin, and is itself stimulated by light as
  well as by sugars. (D) Physical sequestration can limit functionality. (D1) Increased
  translation in the plastid is likely linked to increased ribosome density, as opposed
  to occupancy. (D2) Cytosolic transcripts are sequestered in processing bodies (P-bodies)
  during etiolation, with release allowing their translation. (D3) GluTR is soluble
  and active in the light, with the soluble form correlating with chlorophyll content
  during greening. (E) Retrograde signalling mediated by 1O2 produced by the early
  assembly of the oxygen evolving complex of PSII might contribute to the EXECUTER1
  signaling pathway. (F) MGDG and DGDG, produced in the envelopes by monogalactosyldiacylglycerol
  synthase 1 (MGD1) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase 1 (DGD1), are the primary
  plastid lipids, and have crucial and disparate roles in PLB formation and etioplast-to-chloroplast
  transition, but more research is required to understand the role of both lipids
  and proteins in membrane biogenesis.

  description: Signaling cascade and recently described players in de-etiolation.
    This simplified model shows a basic overview of (A) the PHY/CRY-mediated light-responsive
    signaling cascade, and (B–F) recent discoveries in the field discussed in this
    review. The upper panel shows the etiolated state, the lower panel shows the changes
    that occur early upon de-etiolation. (A) Light is perceived by photoreceptors
    such as phytochromes (PHY) and cryptochromes (CRY), resulting in indirect activation
    of the expression of Elongated Hypocotyl5/HY5 Homolog (HY5/HYH)-dependent photomorphogenesis-related
    genes by repression of the COP1 complex. (B) Small RNAs (sRNA) modulate transcript
    accumulation of both light-signaling molecules and ownstream effector genes, and
    the sRNA pathway itself is also controlled via light signaling pathways. (C) TOR
    indirectly activates translation via auxin, and is itself stimulated by light
    as well as by sugars. (D) Physical sequestration can limit functionality. (D1)
    Increased translation in the plastid is likely linked to increased ribosome density,
    as opposed to occupancy. (D2) Cytosolic transcripts are sequestered in processing

    (D3) GluTR is soluble and active in the light, with the soluble form correlating
