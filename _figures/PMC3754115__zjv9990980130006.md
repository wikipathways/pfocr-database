caption: A hypothetical model for IRF4 activation in EBV latency. Our present study
  has disclosed that IRF4 is activated through c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation,
  although c-Src is unlikely to be a direct kinase for IRF4. The level of the c-Src
  protein is elevated in EBV type 3 latency through an unknown mechanism. c-Src is
  activated (phosphorylated at Y418), probably in part by the LMP1/NF-κB axis. In
  addition to the LMP1 pathway, other lymphocyte-specific pathways may also contribute
  to IRF4 activation. IRF4 expression is induced by the LMP1/NF-κB axis. In addition,
  a recent report shows that the IRF4 protein is stabilized by the EBV latent antigen
  EBNA3C (). MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
