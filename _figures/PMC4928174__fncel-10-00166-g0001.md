caption: Core Reelin signaling pathway. A simplified scheme of Reelin-induced signaling
  events in neurons is shown. Based on a combination of phenotypic analysis of mouse
  mutants and biochemical studies a core Reelin signaling pathway was identified,
  where lipoprotein receptors interact with the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain
  of Disabled-1 (Dab1) via the NPXY motif in their intracellular domains. Oligomerized
  Reelin induces clustering of the receptor-Dab1 complexes, which induces tyrosine
  phosphorylation of Dab1 by Src family kinases (SFK) at different sites. This leads
  to site-specific modification of downstream signaling effectors, which is discussed
  in more detail in the text. The reciprocal activation of Src kinases (SFK) and Dab1,
  which underlies the prolonged increase of Dab1 phosphorylation after Reelin stimulation,
  is negatively regulated by p-Dab1 ubiquitinylation and degradation. It is unclear
  to what degree Apoer2 and Vldlr are coclustered by Reelin. Inhibition of the serine/threonine
  kinase Gsk3β via Akt was the first described lipoprotein receptor- and Dab1-dependent
  linear Reelin signaling cascade in neurons, which targets the cytoskeleton. Reelin
  binds to additional transmembrane proteins (coreceptors) that also interact with
  Dab1, which are not essential for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 but might
  be involved in receptor crosstalk and/or activation of additional downstream effectors.
  Long-lasting changes in responsive cells are induced by transcriptional regulation,
  which involves the gamma-secretase mediated release of receptor intracellular domains.
  The regulation of transmembrane proteins (N-Cadherin, Nectin) downstream of a Reelin-Dab1-Crk/CrkL-Rap1-dependent
  signaling cascade has been shown to be essential for Reelin’s role during neurodevelopment.
