caption: (A) METTL3 is expressed more abundantly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells
  than healthy hematopoietic stem cells. Upregulation of METTL3 results in increased
  mRNA methylation and higher expression levels of factors critical for the regulation
  of apoptosis and differentiation. For example, increased PTEN activity reduces PI3K/AKT
  pathway signaling, leading to proliferation and maintenance of the hematopoietic
  stem cell program. (B) In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, increased METTL3
  results in increased expression of SOCS2, a member of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.
  Increased levels of SOCS2 lead to cellular proliferation and carcinogenesis.
