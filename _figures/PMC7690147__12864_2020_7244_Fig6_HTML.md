caption: 'Schematic of the proposed biosynthetic pathways from acetyl-CoA to torularhodin
  and β-carotene in R. glutinis ZHK. These genes-encoding proteins annotated by orthology
  for enzymes which can catalyze pathway steps. Carotenogenic pathway: CrtE: GGPP
  synthase, CrtYB: bifunctional lycopene cyclase/phytoene synthase, CrtI: phytoene
  desaturase. Metabolites are shown in bold, while the enzymes responsible for relative
  bioconversions are indicated in italics at corresponding arrows'
