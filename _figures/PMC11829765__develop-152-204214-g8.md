caption: Lineage diversification in the ureteric mesenchyme. Scheme summarizing the
  signals and connected cellular processes during smooth muscle cell (SMC) and lamina
  propria (LP) diversification in ureter development. From E11.5 to E14.5, SHH and
  WNT7B signal from the ureteric epithelium (UE) to the adjacent inner mesenchyme
  (IM) to induce expression of ALDH1A2 and BMP4. BMP4 represses ALDH1A2 in the inner
  region and thus assures activation of MYOCD and of the SMC program at ∼E14.5. From
  ∼E18.5 to P7, epithelial SHH and WNT7B signal from B-/I-cells to the adjacent mesenchymal
  cells to induce proliferation and differentiation of the LP (including expression
  of ALDH1A2). Both signaling pathways are also combinatorially required at lower
  concentrations to maintain differentiation and low proliferation of SMCs (thin lines).
  BMP4 signals from the LP to the adjacent tunica muscularis (TM) and urothelium.
  The function of BMP4 signaling in these tissues is unknown. OM, outer region of
  the ureteric mesenchyme; TA, tunica adventitia
