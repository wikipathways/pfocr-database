caption: Figure 3. A model for the relationship between bile acids, the microbiome
  and cirrhosis. In healthy individuals, cholesterol is primarily converted to CA
  and CDCA by the neutral bile acid biosynthetic pathway. Sufficient quantities of
  bile salts enter the small intestine to prevent dysbiosis and the release of inflammatory
  markers (i.e., LPS). Bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria are found in normal range
  (103–105 cells per gram wet weight), and the ratio of secondary to primary bile
  acids in stool is high. In cirrhosis, the neutral pathway is repressed due to downregulation
  of CYP7A1 by proinflammatory cytokines, and the acidic pathway is the primary pathway
  for bile acid synthesis. Dysbiosis occurs due to lower concentration of bile salts
  entering the small bowel. This dybiosis is characterized by inflammation due to
  an increase in organisms with potent LPS such as members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
  The population of 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria in the colon is hypothesized to decrease
  due to lower levels of primary bile acids which are thought to serve the as an energy
  source. Consequently, ratio of secondary/primary bile acids is low in cirrhosis.
