caption: Pathway map of quantitative comparisons of metabolic proteins in DLD-1 cell
  lines. Pairwise comparisons of metabolic PRM measurements of A, DLD-1 Mut versus
  DLD-1 WT and B, DLD-1 Par versus DLD-1 WT. Peptides with the lowest CV and largest
  normalized peak area were used for quantitative comparisons and normalized peak
  area for all detected peptides are shown in supplemental Fig. S3. The legend for
  each pairwise comparison shows fold changes relative to the cell line listed first
  in each comparison. Proteins with a CV < 0.25, an ICC > 0.6, and a p < 0.05 and
  that are higher in the first cell line are shown in red (at least a twofold difference)
  or light red (between 1.2- and 1.9-fold difference). Proteins with a CV < 0.25,
  an ICC > 0.6, and a p < 0.05 and that are lower in the first cell line are shown
  in green (at least a 2-fold difference) or light green (between 1.2- and 1.9-fold
  difference). Proteins with a CV < 0.25, an ICC > 0.6, but a p > 0.05 or with a CV
  < 0.25 but an ICC < 0.6 are listed in gray (no difference). Proteins with a CV >
  0.25 or with no detectable peak area are shown in white.
