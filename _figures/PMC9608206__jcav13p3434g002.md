caption: PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulating PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression is regulated
  by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which controls numerous cell processes including PD-L1
  translation and post-transcription. Arrows mean activation, and bars mean inhibition.
  While dotted lines represent PD-L1 expression and solid lines represent PI3K pathway
  functions. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) is activated by various factors
  including growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. PI3K promotes phosphatidylinositol
  4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3), and then activates Protein Kinase B (AKT). AKT mediated PD-L1 regulation
  is divided into two parts, activating β-catenin and activating the mechanistic target
  of rapamycin complex 1(mTORC1). β-catenin enhances PD-L1 expression by activating
  T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) and combining with the PD-L1 promoter.
  mTORC1 regulates PD-L1 promoter through signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3(STAT3), mammalian target of rapamycin (NF-κB), and Myc, activated by beta-transducin
  repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1(S6K1)
  mediated by MAX interactor 1(Mxi1) degradation. Also, mTOC1 induces ribosome biogenesis
  by promoting p70 protein S6 kinase beta-1(p70S6K1) and inhibiting eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1(4E-BP1). Both ways upregulate eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 4E (elF4E), which promotes PD-L1 mRNA translation.
