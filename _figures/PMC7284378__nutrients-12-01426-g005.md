caption: Proposed mechanisms for protective effects of MWF on chronic alcohol-induced
  liver injury. MWF decreased gene expression involved in de novo TG and cholesterol
  synthesis, which may contribute to anti-steatotic effects. Moreover, MWF reduced
  alcohol-induced inflammatory response by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. MWF positively
  reacts with the hepatic antioxidant defense system as well as protectively alters
  alcohol-induced intestinal microflora changes.
