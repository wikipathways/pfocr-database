caption: 'KDM5B recruits SETDB1 to silence TEs by H3K9me3 modification in the repression
  of tumor immunogenicity. Targeting KDM5B mediated epigenetic silencing of TE can
  induce tumor intrinsic immunity, mainly in two ways: (1) activating of IFN response
  in tumor cells: TE transcripts can form nucleic acid molecules such as dsRNA and
  reverse‐transcribed dsDNA, which leads to the efficient activation of MDA5 and cGAS‐STING
  sensing pathways and downstream IFN signaling; (2) boosting specific cytotoxic T
  cell response: upregulated expression of TE‐encoded peptides in tumor cells can
  activate TE‐specific T cell anti‐tumor response by MHCI antigen presentation pathway.
  Abbreviations: SETDB1, SET domain bifurcated histone lysine methyltransferase 1;
  KDM5B, lysine demethylase 5B; TE, transposable element; IFN, interferon; MDA5, melanoma
  differentiation‐associated gene 5; cGAS, cyclic GMP‐AMP synthase; cGAMP, cyclic
  GMP‐AMP; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; MHCI, major histocompatibility complex
  class I; RT, reverse transcription; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; dsRNA, double‐stranded
  RNA; dsDNA, double‐stranded DNA.'
