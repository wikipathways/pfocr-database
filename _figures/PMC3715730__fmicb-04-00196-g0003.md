caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of Interferon Signaling Pathway of genes
  differentially expressed in the bronchial epithelial cells exposed to Alternaria
  alternata spores. Genes that are significantly up-regulated are shown in red. The
  intensity of red corresponds to an increase in fold change levels of spore treated
  cells compared to control. Genes in white did not exhibit significant changes in
  expression at 24 h post inoculation with Alternaria. The network was generated with
  IPA (Ingenuity Pathways System).
