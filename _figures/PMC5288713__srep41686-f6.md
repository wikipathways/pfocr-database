caption: Cytosolic flagellin induces NAIP5/NLRC4-caspase-1 pathway, and in parallel,
  activates NF-κB transcription factor by an unknown mechanism. Inflammasome activation
  leads to the cleavage of PARP1, which, in its turn, is likely released from the
  chromatin, resulting in chromatin decondensation and consequently NF-κB-dependent
  Nos2 gene transcription. The product of NOS2 expression (nitric oxide) is involved
  in the control of intracellular replication of pathogens in macrophages.
