caption: Obese and postmenopausal breast cancer women exhibit the involvement of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (interleukins/ILs), as shown in the illustration. (A) Obese and postmenopausal
  women secrete a large amount of IL-1/IL-RA, which is correlated with body mass index
  (BMI). This secretion occurs via the Wnt signaling pathway in mammary tissue, promoting
  breast cancer. IL-1 also plays a role in decreasing insulin concentration, leading
  to chemotherapy resistance, fatigue, and increased risk of breast cancer. IL-6 is
  found to be correlated with BMI and can induce inflammation through the Janus kinase
  (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/Wnt pathways. It
  is also correlated with aromatase and resistin, which are known to increase the
  malignancy of ER+ breast cancer and metastasis. Furthermore, IL-6 can impair the
  receptors of natural killer (NK) cells. The secretion of IL-8/C-X-C motif chemokine
  ligand 8 (CXCL8) induces insulin degradation and chemotherapy resistance. IL-10
  secretion inhibits the secretion of aromatase via suppressing tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF)-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation. In
  addition, the excessive secretion of IL-12 can cause fatigue. The secretion of interferon-gamma
  (IFN-γ) can induce inflammation via nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB). TNF-α, on the
  other hand, promotes breast cancer progression through the Wnt pathway. Additionally,
  TNF-α plays a role in increasing fat diameter and induces insulin resistance through
  aromatase while also being involved in the synthesis of IL-6. The secretion of transforming
  growth factor-beta (TGF-β) also contributes to an increase in fat diameter, induces
  inflammation, and promotes tumor progression. (B) The mechanism of how breast cancer
  susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1)-deficient adipose-derived stem cells promote breast
  cancer progression. BRCA1-deficient adipose-derived stem cells are unable to repair
  both spontaneous and stress-induced DNA damage. This accumulation of DNA damage
  leads to a more persistently active ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) complex,
  which activates p21 and induces cellular senescence. In the senescent state, BRCA1-deficient
  adipose-derived stem cells secrete an increased number of inflammatory cytokines,
  which promotes breast tumor proliferation and invasion. (C) Ovariectomized (OVX)
  mouse models, commonly used in menopausal and breast cancer research, exhibit altered
  immunological parameters. In particular, the cytokine IL-6 up-regulates sensitized
  breast cancer cells to low levels of testosterone; on the other hand, the OVX model
  reduces the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IL-4. The red color up arrow symbol
  (↑) represents up-regulation, while the down arrow symbol (↓) represents down-regulation
