caption: IL-37 signaling pathway induced by TLR2/4 extracellularly and intracellularly.
  The translocation of the activated NF-κB induced by TLR2/4 into the nucleus for
  binding to NF-κB-specific DNA-binding sites, resulting in the regulation of the
  transcription of target genes, such as ICAM-1. On one hand, IL-37 can inhibit the
  TLR2/4-NF-κB signaling pathway by suppressing the phosphorylation of NF-κB or binding
  to Smad3 to inhibit transcription in the nucleus. On the other hand, IL-37 can combine
  with IL-18Rα side chain to prevent the formation of IL-18 functional complex to
  suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokine extracellularly.
