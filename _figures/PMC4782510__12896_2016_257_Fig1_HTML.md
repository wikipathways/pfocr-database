caption: Metabolic pathway from glucose to HFAs in engineered E. coli. Glucose is
  degraded into acetyl-CoA through glycolysis. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) catalyzes
  the irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. The discrete,
  monofunctional type II fatty acid synthases (FAS) act on malonyl-CoA to synthesize
  fatty acyl-ACPs. Then thioesterase hydrolyzes the acyl-ACPs bond to form FFAs. At
  last, fatty acid hydroxylase transforms FFAs to HFAs. Acyl-CoA synthetase responsible
  for fatty acid degradation is knocked out to block fatty acids and HFAs degradation

  fatty acids from glucose.
