caption: Glial activation and TLR4/NF-κB inflammation signaling pathway were two mutually
  potentiating mechanisms leading to BBB disruption in hypoxic-ischemic and inflammatory
  (HII) injury of the developing brain. TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway-induced inflammation
  activation contributed to ECs and pericytes damage after HII, which was inhibited
  by melatonin.
