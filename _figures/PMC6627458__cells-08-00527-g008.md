caption: Potential mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of oxytocin
  (OT) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia. LPS binds its receptors,
  such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), increases ER stress, and stimulates inflammatory
  pathways for production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in ER stress-dependent and -independent
  manners. In addition to NF-κB signaling, a branch of the ER stress-related pathways,
  namely the p-eIF-2α–ATF4 pathway, is also activated, stimulating unidentified transcriptional
  programs for the production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. The p-eIF-2α–ATF4 pathway
  also upregulates CHOP levels, leading to the production of IL-1β mediated by inflammasome
  activation. OT binds to the OT receptor (OTR) and reduces PTP1B levels, which could
  contribute to modulating some cellular responses (red lines). Furthermore, OTR signaling
  inhibits the p-eIF-2α–ATF4 pathway, thereby suppressing the production of TNF-α,
  IL-6, and IL-1β (red lines).
