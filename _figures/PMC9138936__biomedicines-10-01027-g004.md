caption: The regulation of aggresome–autophagy pathway. Aggresome and autophagy are
  regulated by Lys63-associated polyquitination-mediated pathway. Oxidative damage
  or genetic mutations are responsible for protein misfolding. After folding, the
  misfolded proteins are labeled with polyubiquitin chains linked to Lys48, which
  is subsequently degraded via either the proteasomal system or chaperone-mediated
  pathway. However, when proteasome and chaperone systems are overwhelmed, misfolded
  proteins form oligomers or aggregates with cellular toxicity. Moreover, PD-related
  parkin ligase E3 acts with the E2 enzymes Ubc13/Uev1a to facilitate Lys63-associated
  polyubiquitination of misfolded proteins in proteasome injury conditions. Polyubiquitin
  chain stimulates binding with HDAC6, and the misfolded proteins bind to dynein motor
  complex, which retrograde the aggresomes to MTOC via transport. Polyubiquitination
  encourages p62 binding in addition to recruiting autophagic membranes to form autophagosomes.
  Consequently, the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes facilitates the degradation
  of misfolded and aggregated proteins through the lysosomal hydrolases.
