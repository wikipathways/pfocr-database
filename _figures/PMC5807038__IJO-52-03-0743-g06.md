caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of circRNA-000911 in breast
  cancer cells. Circular RNA (circRNA)-000911 acted as a miR-449a sponge to regulate
  the miR-449a/Notch1/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway in breast cancer cells. Decreased
  circRNA-000911 expression in breast cancer increased the activity of miR-449a, which
  downregulated the expression of Notch1 and upregulated the downstream effectors,
  thereby promoting breast tumorigenesis and progression.
