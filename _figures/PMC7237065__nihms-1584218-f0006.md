caption: Universal patient pathway for breast cancer management in three sequential
  intervals of care (Patient Interval, Diagnostic Interval, and Treatment Interval)
  highlighting the Patient and Diagnostic Intervals of care. The Patient Interval
  begins with the onset of clinical symptoms or an abnormal screening exam and extends
  to the time the patient presents for diagnostic work-up of a recognized or suspected
  breast abnormality. During the Diagnostic Interval, the identified breast abnormality
  undergoes a ‘triple test’ work-up based on clinical evaluation, imaging and tissue
  sampling to achieve a definitive benign or malignant diagnosis. The health system
  should endeavor to complete the diagnostic work-up within a 60 day (2 month) period,
  because worsened survival outcomes can result from diagnostic delays extending significantly
  beyond 3 months.
