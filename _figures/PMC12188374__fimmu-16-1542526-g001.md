caption: (1) The EML4-ALK fusion protein produced by ALK rearrangement can activate
  the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The activated JAK-STAT signaling plays an important
  promoting role in the process of AST; (2) TET2 promotes neutrophil lipid transfer
  through STAT3-mediated CXCL5 expression, thus facilitating the process of AST; (3)
  In KRAS-mutated lung cancer with LKB1 deficiency, the AMPK-FAO pathway is disrupted
  by the excessively accumulated ROS. Meanwhile, ROS mediates the shutdown of the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through FOXO3A, disrupting the balance of the TF
  network,thus promoting the development of AST; (4) The upstream TFs of ASLC form
  a regulatory network centered around NKX2-1, FOXA2, SOX2 and TP63; (5) In KRAS-driven
  LUAD, SOX2 promotes the recruitment and infiltration of TANs through CXCL3 and CXCL5;
  (6) YAP inhibits ASLC with LKB1 deficiency by suppressing DNp63 mediated by ZEB2;
  (7) Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway can induce squamous characteristics in an
  EGFR-mutated LUAD model; (8) The deletion of FOXA1and the overexpression of FOXM1synergistically
  drive AST (63); (9) The knockout of FOXA1 significantly upregulates the transcription
  of DNp63 in tumor cells. The protein level of FOXA1 is downregulated in tumors with
  DNp63 overexpression, while it is upregulated in tumors with DNp63 knockout. TFs,
  transcription factors; LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma;
