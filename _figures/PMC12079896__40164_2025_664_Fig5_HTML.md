caption: Dynamic signaling pathway alterations during progressive ineffective erythropoiesis
  in MDS. (1) The top panel shows changes in hemoglobin (HGB) and mean corpuscular
  volume (MCV) over time, with statistical significance (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <
  0.001, ****P < 0.0001). (2) A timeline (0–56 weeks) tracks MDS progression, highlighting
  key processes such as ferroptosis, senescence, autophagy, and apoptosis. Erythroid
  progenitor cells from NHD13 and WT mice were sorted at selected four time point
  for RNA sequencing to identify gene expression changes. (3) The bottom panel depicts
  the molecular mechanisms leading to cell death, including dysregulated iron metabolism,
  premature aging, and activation of apoptosis and pyroptosis. Early MDS stages are
  driven by increased heme metabolism and ferroptosis, while later stages are characterized
  by senescence, cell cycle disruption, and inflammasome activation, indicating the
  potential for stage-specific therapeutic approaches in MDS
