caption: Model of how OsDET1 deficiency leads to contradictory phenotypes related
  to  in OsDET1 RNAi plants. OsDDB1 interacts with OsCOP10, OsDET1, and OsDDA1 to
  form the CDDD complex. The reduction of CDDD complex function hinders the ubiquitination
  of OsPYLs and causes the accumulation of OsPYLs. The accumulation of PYLs and  promotes
  the stability of the PP2C--PYL ternary complex (). However, OsDET1 deficiency also
  leads to a decline in the content of  in normal conditions. Thus, due to these opposing
  factors, OsDET1 deficiency only partly causes the  hypersensitivity phenotype, such
  as closed stomatal pores and changes of pollen grain morphology, although it is
  unable to induce leaf senescence in normal development. The modulation of cuticular
  wax biosynthesis by the  signaling pathway is distinct from the governing stomatal
  regulation, and the accumulation of cuticular waxes is reduced in OsDET1 RNAi plants.
  During dark treatment,  is induced by continuous dark, which further enhances the  response
  and finally leads to increased leaf senescence. The leaf senescence in turn promotes
  the synthesis of . Finally, OsDET1 RNAi plants exhibit a significantly accelerated
  leaf senescence phenotype.
