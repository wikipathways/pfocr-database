caption: Metabolic pathway visualization and relative metabolite abundance of Magnolia
  flower buds. Fold changes (FC) from white to violet flower buds were converted into
  log2-transformed values (log2FC). A log2FC value range is −2 < log2FC < 2. If log2FC
  value is higher than zero (indicated in red), metabolite content is higher in violet
  flower buds than in white flower buds. If log2FC value is less than zero (indicated
  in green), metabolite content is higher in white flower buds than in violet flower
  buds.
