caption: Regulatory mechanism of endothelial cells in unstable plaques. Inhibition
  of endothelial cell apoptosis induced by ox-LDL was mainly through WNT/JNK pathway
  after Dickkopf1 (DKK1) silencing. The combination of vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and its ligand metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) induces the
  phosphorylation of ERK1/2 through PLCγ/PI3K signal transduction and promotes the
  migration of ECs. Oxidative stress and hypoxia induce transforming growth factor-β
  (TGF-β) to stimulate the phosphorylation of SNAI2 and SMAD3, resulting in endothelial
  to mesenchymal transition (EndMT). P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R) deletion can promote the
  expression of vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase (eNOS) in ECs, thus promote the activity of nitric oxide (NO) and matrix
  metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), then increase endothelial inflammation. Oleic acid
  suppresses cell apoptosis by inhibiting Toll-like receptor-activated JNK/NF-κB/IκBα
  pathway and the expression of TNF-α, MCP-1 and ICAM-1.
