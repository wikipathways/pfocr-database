caption: miR-106b serves as a critical regulator of tumor growth and metastasis in
  Osteosarcoma by modulating key cell cycle checkpoints and apoptotic pathways. By
  targeting cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 and p27, miR-106b facilitates
  the G1/S transition, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Additionally, its
  role in promoting invasive behavior is linked to advanced disease stages, including
  extensive lung metastases. miR-106b also contributes to chemotherapy resistance
  by altering apoptotic signaling, particularly through the regulation of BCL-2 family
  proteins, thereby preventing programmed cell death
