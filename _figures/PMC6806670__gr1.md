caption: Diagram of Model Reaction RulesAng1 (tetrameric) and Ang2 (dimeric, trimeric,
  and tetrameric) induce oligomerization, phosphorylation, and internalization of
  Tie2. Orphan receptor Tie1 binds and forms heterodimers with receptor Tie2. Internalized
  receptors are recycled back to the cell surface or degraded. Receptors Tie1 and
  Tie2 get cleaved from the surface and form soluble receptors Tie1 and Tie2. Soluble
  Tie2 binds to both ligands Ang1 and Ang2. See also .
