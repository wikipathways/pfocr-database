caption: Overview of the Wnt signaling pathway. In the “Wnt-Off” state, Wnt/receptor
  interactions are interrupted by secreted Wnt antagonists, including sFRPs, DKKs
  and WIF1; and β-catenin is degraded by the formation of the “destruction complex”
  consisting of APC protein, Axin and others. In the “Wnt-On” state, Wnts are are
  lipid modified by the acyl transferase porcupine in the endoplasmic reticulum, and
  act in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. The Wnts form a complex with Frizzled
  receptor and coreceptors LRP5/LRP6. Upon receptor activation, the “destruction complex”
  which includes APC, Axin and others is inhibited thereby blocking β-catenin phosphorylation
  for degradation. This inhibition results in cytoplasmic β-catenin stabilization
  and accummulation which facilitates its translocation into the nucleus. Nuclear
  β-catenin acts as a transcriptional co-activator for LEF1/TCF, leading gene transcription
  of Wnt target genes, such as JUN, Cyclin-D1, and MMP7. In addition, Wnts bind to
  tyrosine-protein kinase transmembrane receptors ROR2 and RYK to activate other non-canonical
  planar cell polarity, the Wnt/JNK and the Wnt/Calcium pathways.
