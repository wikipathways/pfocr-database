caption: Crosstalk between DC and NK. Pathway represented with gene expression (log2
  fold-change) values overlaid. Red shading indicates increased and green shading
  indicates decreased, while colour intensity indicates expression level. White and
  grey shading indicate not significantly differentially expressed and filtered out
  due to low expression, respectively. Solid and dashed lines represent direct and
  indirect interactions, respectively, between molecules. Open arrow means ‘translocate
  to’, solid arrow means ‘acts on’. Shapes indicate functional class of a gene product;
  vertical ellipse (transmembrane receptor), horizontal ellipse (transcription regulator),
  square (cytokines), circle (others), cogwheel (pathways). Double edge indicates
  complex or group. © 2000–2020 QIAGEN. All rights reserved.
