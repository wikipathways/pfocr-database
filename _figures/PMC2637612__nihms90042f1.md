caption: The primary pathways for acetaminophen metabolism (Panel A) are glucuronidation
  and sulfation to nontoxic metabolites. Approximately 5% of a therapeutic dose is
  metabolized by cytochrome P450 2E1 to the electrophile N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine
  (NAPQI). NAPQI is extremely toxic to the liver. Ordinarily, NAPQI is rapidly detoxified
  by interaction with glutathione to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.
  If glutathione is depleted, NAPQI interacts with various macromolecules, leading
  to hepatocyte injury and death. Glutathione is synthesized from the amino acids
  cysteine, glutamate, and glycine by means of the pathway shown in Panel B. Glutamate
  and glycine are present in abundance in hepatocytes; the availability of cysteine
  is the rate-limiting factor in glutathione synthesis. However, cysteine itself is
  not well absorbed after oral administration. Acetylcysteine, in contrast, is readily
  absorbed and rapidly enters cells, where it is hydrolyzed to cysteine, thus providing
  the limiting substrate for glutathione synthesis.
