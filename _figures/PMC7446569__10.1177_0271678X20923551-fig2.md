caption: Mast cells (MCs) might be some of the central mediators of inflammatory responses.
  MCs are normal resident cells in the leptomeninges and brain structures surrounding
  blood vessels. After the onset of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), MCs rapidly respond
  by degranulating and releasing preformed and stored mediators including histamine,
  serotonin, heparin, TNF-α, and other cytokines. MC-derived granules can activate
  both microglia and astrocytes as well as exacerbate neuronal necrosis and apoptosis.
  For example, MC-derived tryptase induces microglial activation and secretion of
  pro-inflammatory factors via the protease-activated receptor 2 signaling pathway;
  MC-derived histamine stimulates microglial activation and the subsequent production
  of pro-inflammatory factors. MC proteases activate astrocytes and cause the release
  of IL-33 by activating p38, ERK1/2 MAPKs, and the NF-κB signaling pathway. In turn,
  activated microglia and astrocytes further stimulate MCs to release histamine, IL-6,
  and TNF-α. The interaction between MCs and oligodendrocytes is still unclear. The
  MC–microglia–astrocyte network amplifies the cascade of inflammatory responses and
  aggravates neuronal necrosis and apoptosis after ICH.
