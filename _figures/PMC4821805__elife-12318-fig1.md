caption: '(A) General scheme of haem biosynthetic and degradative pathways in the
  eukaryotic cell. Haem biosynthesis (upper) is a series of eight reactions beginning
  in the mitochondria by condensation of succinyl coenzyme A with glycine, continuing
  in the cell cytoplasm, and finishing in the mitochondria with the final synthesis
  of the haem molecule. Haem degradation (lower) is mediated by haem oxygenase in
  the cell cytoplasm, releasing a ferrous iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide. (B)
  Evolution of haem biosynthetic and degradative pathways in arthropods, according
  to the available genomic projects. Similarly to vertebrates, hexapods (insects)
  including blood feeding mosquitoes (red-coloured body), possess all enzymes for
  haem biosynthesis and degradation. Chelicerates lack haem oxygenase, indicating
  iron acquisition from sources other than haem. Plant-feeding mites (green-coloured
  body) of the superorder Acariformes, as well as mite-predating mites (black-coloured
  body) of the superorder Parasitiformes, possess a complete set of genes for haem
  biosynthesis. Ticks, which feed solely on blood (red-coloured body) retained only
  the last three enzymes (mitochondrial) of the pathway. CO - carbon monoxide, Fe2+
  - ferrous iron, Gly - glycine, Suc-CoA - succinyl coenzyme A, ALAS - 5-aminolevulinate
  synthase, PBGS - porphobilinogen synthase, HMBS - hydroxymethylbilane synthase,
  UROS - uroporphyrinogen synthase, UROD - uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, CPOX -
  coproporphyrinogen oxidase, PPOX - protoporphyrinogen oxidase, FECH - ferrochelatase;
