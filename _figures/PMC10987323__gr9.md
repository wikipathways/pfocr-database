caption: 'Role of mtETC in M1 macrophage polarization. LPS, IFN-γ and/or TNF-α (not
  shown here) stimulate reprogramming of macrophages toward the pro-inflammatory phenotype.
  During metabolic reprogramming, the TCA cycle is disrupted at two points (at the
  steps of α-ketoglutarate and malate conversion) resulting in the accumulation of
  citrate and succinate, disrupting the feeding of electrons to the mtETC. The interruption
  activates the “Warburg effect” and shifts the cellular metabolism towards aerobic
  glycolysis to meet the energy demands. This results in the upregulation of glycolytic
  enzymes, and lactate production. M1 macrophages upregulate PKM2, catalyzing in the
  conversion of PEP into pyruvate and promoting glycolysis. Succinate synthesis is
  promoted in M1 macrophages via the channeling of glutamine into the TCA cycle through
  GABA shunt and through anaplerosis. Oxidation of succinate to fumarate via C II
  during low OXPHOS conditions results in the transfer of electrons in the opposite
  direction toward C I, leading to RET that induces mtROS production, which activates
  HIF-1α. HIF-1α, a signaling molecule characteristic of the M1 phenotype, drives
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β. In M1 macrophages,
  oxidation of G6P is enhanced due to an increase in oxidative PPP which generates
  NADPH that is required for NOX-induced ROS (shown by broken black arrow), synthesis
  of fatty acids, and anti-oxidant defense mechanisms, and ribulose-5P that is required
  for nucleotide biosynthesis, and this occurs due to suppressed activity of CARKL.
  M1 macrophages show upregulation in the PDK1 enzyme, a regulatory enzyme that phosphorylates
  PDH that catalyses the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coA. Pyruvate-derived acetyl
  CoA (shown by broken black arrow) enters into the TCA cycle that generates NADH
  which fuels mtETC. Reduction in IDH1 levels led to an increase in the synthesis
  of antimicrobial molecule i.e., itaconic acid (or Itaconate) via IRG1 from decarboxylation
  of aconitate. However, increased production of itaconate inhibits SDH activity.
  Furthermore, citrate is exported from the mitochondria via CIC, and broken down
  into oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA via ACLY. Acetyl CoA can be used as a substrate
  for fatty acid synthesis. Oxaloacetate is metabolized to pyruvate accompanied by
  NADPH and NO production. In M1 macrophages, iNOS activity is upregulated, resulting
  in the catabolism of arginine to citrulline and NO (shown by broken black arrow),
  the latter playing a crucial antimicrobial role in M1 macrophages. Citrulline is
  metabolized along with aspartate to generate argininosuccinate via ASS, which is
  further catalyzed into arginine and fumarate. Further, NO-induced nitrosylation
  of Fe–S proteins in C I, and C IV results in their inactivation resulting in low
  OXPHOS. The black solid arrows represent the movement of substrates, the broken
  blue arrows represent the activation of enzymatic and signaling pathways in M1 macrophages,
  and the broken red line represent the inhibition of the enzymes/pathways in M1 macrophages.
