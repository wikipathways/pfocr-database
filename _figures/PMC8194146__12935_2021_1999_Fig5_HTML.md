caption: Illustration of the crosstalk of the Hippo pathway and BCSC-related pathways.
  Linc-OIP5 promotes transcription via forming a positive feedback circuit between
  YAP and Notch signaling []. IMP3 indirectly promotes Wnt5B via miR145-5p and facilitates
  TAZ-driven gene expression []. YAP and TAZ can promote the Wnt/β-catenin/TCF axis
  and induce target genes by interaction with β-catenin, while WBP2 integrates the
  Hippo, Wnt, and PI3K pathway [–]. Mir-613 inhibits EGFR via directly inhibiting
  WBP2 and positive correlation of EGFR and WBP2 is confirmed, while EGFR promotes
  WBP2 phosphorylation, contributing to integration of the Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo
  pathways [, ]. YAP/TAZ mediate the synergistic function and oncogene expression
  induced by the PI3K and dysregulated Hippo pathways []. The MAPK/ERK1 pathway negatively
  regulates breast cancer proliferation by inhibiting YAP/TEAD []. YAP induces gene
  transcription and promotes glycolysis by wiring up the Hh/GLI2 axis []. The SnoN
  oncoprotein exerts negative feedback regulation on TGF-β signaling, while promoting
  TAZ signaling and enhancing gene transcription in breast cancers []. Zyxin forms
  a ternary complex with LATS and Siah, which facilitates the degradation of LATS,
  activation of YAP and subsequently cell proliferation []. The tumor suppressor Merlin
  can inhibit YAZ/TAZ and maintain Smad7 stability, suppressing the adaptive glycolysis
  facilitated by the interaction between YAP/TAZ and Smads []. Ski inhibits breast
  cancer by suppressing TAZ in a LATS-dependent manner or in a LATS-independent manner,
  in which NCoR1 is recruited by Ski and suppresses TAZ by binding to the TEAD-TAZ
  complex []
