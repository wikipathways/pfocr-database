caption: Potential model of the intersection of PD vulnerability pathways with DA
  metabolism at presynapse, promoting aSyn aggregation. Pre-synaptic calcium influx
  (via Cav1.3 calcium channels) drives mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos),
  energetically supporting DA sequestration (thick green arrow) and consecutively
  neurotransmission. Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are loaded with DA neurotransmitter by
  VMAT-2, which transports cytosolic DA into the SV in exchange of H+ provided by
  the action of the H+-ATPase. Following release, synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE)
  replenishes SVs; however, PD-linked deficits in this pathway can limit the SV availability
  (thick red line). Because of ongoing DA biosynthesis (TH-catalyzed conversion of
  tyrosine to L-DOPA), impairment of DA sequestration into SVs leads to the accumulation
  of DA in the cytosol (thick red line). Subsequent build-up of oxidized DA metabolites
  (yellow highlight) in the cytosol disturbs aSyn homeostasis and leads to neurotoxicity.
  Specifically, cytosolic DA oxidation, catalyzed by iron (Fe3+), can lead to increased
  oxidized DA derivatives (oxDA), as well as increased levels of the neurotoxic metabolite
  DOPAL, catalyzed by MAO, further oxidized to DOPAL-Q (thick red arrows). aSyn oligomerization
  by DOPAL/-Q entails formation of adducts, whereas binding of DA-Q, calcium, and
  iron also promote the formation of aSyn oligomers/aggregates. Neuronal detoxification
  from DOPAL is mediated by ALDH1A1, which catalyzes its conversion to the non-toxic
  metabolite DOPAC (thin green arrow). Moreover, DA-Q and iron are removed from the
  cytosol over time by sequestration to the dark pigment neuromelanin at the soma
  (black intermittent arrow), enclosed within membranes, which can be neuroprotective
  under physiological conditions.
