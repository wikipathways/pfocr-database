caption: Mechanism of sepsis-induced liver injury. LPS regulate liver cell inflammation
  by modulating the MAPK/NF-κB and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways; regulate liver cell
  oxidative stress and ferroptosis by modulating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways;
  and LPS-induced inflammatory mediators can lead to endothelial cell damage, microcirculation
  disorders, adaptive pathway activity in liver cells, and exacerbated sepsis-induced
  liver injury. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; MyD88, myeloid
