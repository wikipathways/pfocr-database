caption: A condensed scheme of glycerol metabolism in plants. Glycerol is phosphorylated
  to G3P by GK (GLI1). G3P can also be generated by G3Pdh via the reduction of DHAP
  in both the cytosol and the plastids (represented by the oval). G3P generated by
  this reaction can be transported between the cytosol and plastidial stroma. In the
  plastids, G3P is acylated with oleic acid (18:1) by the ACT1-encoded G3P acyltransferase.
  This ACT1-utilized 18:1 is derived from the stearoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP)-desaturase
  (SSI2)-catalyzed desaturation of stearic acid (18:0). The 18:1-ACP generated by
  ACT1 either enters the prokaryotic lipid biosynthetic pathway through acylation
  of G3P or is exported out of the plastids as a CoA-thioester to enter the eukaryotic
  lipid biosynthetic pathway. Lyso-PA, Acyl-G3P; PA, phosphatidic acid; PG, phosphatidylglycerol;
  MGD, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol; DGD, digalactosyldiacylglycerol; SL, sulfolipid;
  DAG, diacylglycerol.
