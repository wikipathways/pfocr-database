caption: An comprehesive metabolomics and transcriptomics study to identify metabolic
  pathway alterations in CFG treatment of ovarian tumor-bearing mice in vivo. (A)
  Integrative co-analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics. Significance was determined
  as p<0.05. (B) Pathway illustration of galactose metabolism. (C) Pathway illustration
  of fatty acid elongation, oxidation and metabolism. (D) A Schematic to show the
  differential metabolic pathways involved in CFG treatment of ovarian cancer.
