caption: Examples of the molecular mechanisms by which phytochemicals activate hormetic
  stress response pathways. Neurons normally receive signals from multiple extracellular
  signals that activate adaptive cellular signaling pathways. For example, many neurotransmitters
  activate GTP-binding protein coupled receptors (GPCR), neurotrophic factors activate
  specific receptors (NTFR) and insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) activate
  their receptors (IR). The receptors in turn activate kinase cascades including those
  that activate protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). Stress on the endoplasmic reticulum stress
  activates the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). Downstream of PKC, MAPK,
  PI3K and PERK is the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), a transcription
  factor that translocates to the nucleus and binds to the antioxidant response element
  (ARE) in genes that encode cyto-protective proteins such as antioxidant enzymes
  (AOE) and phase-2 proteins. Sulforaphane, a phy-tochemical present in relatively
  high amounts in broccoli, interacts with cysteine residues critical for the sulfhydryl-mediated
  interaction of the protein Keap with Nrf-2, thus freeing Nrf-2 so that it can translocate
  to the nucleus. Resveratrol, present in red grapes and wine, can activate a different
  hormetic pathway. Resveratrol interacts with the SIRT1 histone deacetylase which
  activates the transcription factor FOXO3 resulting in induction of genes encoding
  AOE, anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and neurotrophic factors such as BDNF.
  Other phytochemicals, including allicin from garlic and capsaicin from hot peppers,
  can activate specific ionotropic transient receptor potential (TRP) receptors in
  the plasma membrane resulting in Ca2+ influx; Ca2+, in turn, activates neuroprotective
  kinase cascades and the trancription factor CREB (cyclic AMP response element binding
  protein); CREB induces the expression of BDNF, an inter-cellular mediator of neurhormesis.
  Some phyto-chemicals may activate the transcription factor NF-κB, which is known
  to mediate adaptive cellular stress responses by inducing the expression of the
  AOE Mn-superoxide dismutase. BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CBP, CREB-binding
  protein; DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol triphos-phate; NGF, nerve growth factor;
  PLC, phospholipase C. This figure is modified from .
