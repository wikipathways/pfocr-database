caption: The MHC I antigen presentation pathway is down-regulated by multiple mechanisms
  in cancers. (i) At the level of DNA, mutation and methylation of nucleotides can
  reduce expression of APM genes; (ii) Transcription of APM can be reduced by changes
  in chromatin that impair gene accessibility or through loss of transcription factors.
  Multiple mechanisms can affect these processes including altered signaling pathways,
  oncogene activity, and the tumor microenvironment; (iii) At the level of transcription,
  binding of ncRNA or proteins to the 3′ UTR of APM mRNAs can reduce transcription;
  (iv) At the level of protein, Staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing
  1 (SND1) can bind to MHC I in the ER and trigger endoplasmic reticulum-associated
  degradation (ERAD). At the cell surface, loss of SPPL3 increases glycosphingolipids
  (GSL) that then sterically inhibit MHC I and TCR interactions. Reactive nitrogen
  species can nitrosylate peptide-MHC I complexes in ways that impair TCR interactions.
