caption: 'Regulations in KIT protein and signaling pathway. LMTK3 directly promotes
  KIT protein translation, but also inhibit the expression of PKC (PKC-θ) and KIT
  phosphorylation. LIX1 controls MAPK pathway. Hedgehog pathway has two activate models:
  with ligands, HHs binding to the receptors, Patched-1/2, initiate the Hh pathway
  and inhibit SMO; without ligands, SMO starts to activate different GLIs, GLI1/2
  up-regulate the KIT mRNA level, while GLI3 down-regulates KIT mRNA levels via the
  proteasome pathway. There are three classic intracellular signaling pathways for
  KIT activation, respectively Ras-Erk pathway, PI3K-AKT pathway and JAK-STAT pathway.
  Ras-Erk pathway and PI3K-AKT pathway have crosstalk with Hh pathway. FGF2 binds
  to and activates its receptors FGFR (FGFR3), mediating the reactivation of mutant
  KIT and JAK-STAT pathway. AMPD3 also promotes the JAK-STAT pathway. FGFR3 and AMPD3
  both form a positive protein–protein feedback loop with mutant KIT. MiRNA-218 can
  inhibit JAK-STAT pathway and P55PIK can promote PI3K-AKT pathway. ACK1 activates
  the MAPK pathway and the PI3K pathway, whereas lix1 may only regulates the MAPK
  pathway'
