caption: Intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway.(A) Schematic diagram of the intrinsic
  or mitochondria apoptosis signaling pathway. Upon the release of Cytochrome C from
  mitochondria, it binds with apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) to form
  the apoptosome. The apoptosome activates procaspase-9 into caspase 9, the initiator
  apoptotic caspase. Caspase 9 then cleaves and activates procaspase-3 to caspase3,
  the executioner or effector caspase. In turn, caspase 3 promotes the activation
  of caspase 9, forming a positive feedback loop. Meanwhile, the inhibitor of apoptosis
  protein (IAP) inhibits the activity of caspase 3. Elevated activity of caspase 3
  induces irreversible fate of apoptosis. (B) Reaction scheme of our mathematical
  model of intrinsic apoptosis pathway, where Apaf-1, Cytochrome C, apoptosome, procaspase-9,
  caspase 9, procaspase-3 and caspase 3 are denoted by Apaf1, CC, a1cc, c9p, c9a,
  c3p and c3a, respectively. Note that the black arrows represent direct reactions
  such as binding, synthesis and degradation, the red line with hammerhead represents
  inhibiting regulatory reaction, and the two green arrows represent activating regulations,
  which are the modifications of the Fussenegger model.
