caption: Schematic interpretation of the importance of dynorphins under physiological
  and pathophysiological processes in the cardiovascular system. Dynorphin fragments
  (Dyn A 1–17, Dyn A 1–13, and Dyn B 1–13) are involved in the regulation of tissues
  within the CV system. Panel A. Dynorphin A is cardioprotective. Dyn A 1–17 and Dyn
  A 1–13 dampen the sympathetic-induced increases in blood pressure and heart rate.
  Dyn deficient mice exhibit increased sympathetic activation. Lack of Dyn causes
  reduced IGF-1, T4, and free fatty acid levels. IGF-1 is capable of inhibiting Na+/H+
  antiporter. Thus, increased IGF-1 may increase the development of heart failure
  via uncontrolled Na+/H+ antiporter hyperactivity-mediated increased calcium transient.
  Increased T4 protects cardiac tissue following I/R injury. Panel B. Arrhythmogenic
  signaling of dynorphins. Once a threshold is reached (30–50 μM), dynorphins induce
  arrhythmias through PKC- and IP3 - dependent mechanisms. Lastly, inhibition of Na+/K+
  ATPase by Dyn leads to arrhythmias via intracellular calcium mobilization and activation
  of PKC -dependent Ca2+signaling pathway. The flow of physiological changes that
  require further investigations are shown in dashed arrows. BP; blood pressure, CRH;
  corticotropic-releasing hormone, Epi; epinephrine, FFAs; free fatty acids, HR; heart
  rate, IGF-1; insulin-like growth factor 1, IP3; NE; norepinephrine, PKC; protein
  kinase C, SER; sarco/endoplasmic reticulum-associated calcium storage organelle,
  T4; thyroxine.
