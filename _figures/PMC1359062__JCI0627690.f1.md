caption: 'Ciliated cell differentiation into goblet cells requires 2 signals. Tyner
  et al. (), using a mouse model of Sendai virus infection, propose that the induction
  of a chronic mucus-producing airway epithelium requires 2 signals. Signal 1 activates
  the EGFR on ciliated cells and induces EGFR phosphorylation and activation of PI3K/Akt.
  This pathway leads to inhibition of ciliated cell apoptosis. Ciliated cells that
  survive can respond to signal 2: IL-13 binding to its receptor. Upon IL-13 receptor
  (IL-13R) activation and STAT6 signaling, ciliated cells begin to produce mucins
  (including those encoded by MUC5AC), which are contained within mucous secretions,
  and lose their ciliated cell surface, taking on features of mucus-producing goblet
  cells. It also appears that other epithelial cells, such as Clara cells, can differentiate
  into goblet cells. Thus, the airway epithelium is driven to become a mucus-producing
  organ, presumably to enhance host defense. In some diseases, such as asthma, this
  response may be misdirected. Airway tissue from human asthmatics exhibits EGFR activation
  on ciliated cells, and mucus appears to be induced by IL-13, suggesting that this
  may also be an important pathway for mucous induction in humans, yet it remains
  unclear whether other pathways of mucous induction are active in chronic airway
  diseases.'
