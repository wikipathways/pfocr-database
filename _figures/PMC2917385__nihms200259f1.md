caption: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, which often occurs in
  NSCLC, leads to upregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway as well as the Raf/MEK/ERk
  kinase pathway. Akt pathway activation has been implicated in both resistance of
  cells to radiation-induced killing and in increased expression of hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A number of drugs
  that can inhibit various points along these pathways have been shown in pre-clinical
  models to increase the radiation responsiveness of tumors.
