caption: Inhibition of MyD88 signaling pathway can up-regulate Ghrelin expression
  and aggravate Echinococcus multilocularis disease progression. The picture showed
  that following the hepatic portal injection of Echinococcus multilocularis protoscoleces,
  the intraperitoneal administration of TJ-M2010-5 resulted in a marked suppression
  of the MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, accompanied by a significant increase in Ghrelin
  levels. These two factors synergistically mitigated the inflammatory response and
  modulated the imbalance between Th1 and Th2 cells. Specifically, the secretion of
  anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 was upregulated, while the secretion
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and INF-γ was downregulated. Furthermore, the
  expression of the M2 polarization factor Arg-1 was upregulated, whereas the expression
  of the M1 polarization factor iNOS was downregulated. These alterations may potentially
  exacerbate the progression of liver disease caused by Echinococcus multilocularis
  infection. The author used Adobe Illustrator to hand draw the images, and the original
  images had no copyright dispute
