caption: (A) During liver development, the liver bud is specified from the remainder
  of the endoderm by Wnt expression from the cardiac mesoderm. HSC, hepatic stellate
  cell. (B) Once specified, the endoderm matures into fetal hepatoblasts that are
  capable of bilineage differentiation into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. (C) Spatial
  heterogeneity across the developing liver results in the specification of the ductal
  plate though activation of the Notch signaling pathway, in close proximity to what
  will ultimately become the portal tract. (D) Once specified, the ductal plate is
  patterned, and the side adjacent to the portal mesenchyme closely associates with
  laminin and expresses high levels of Sox9, whereas the side adjacent to the developing
  parenchyma expresses TGF-β–mediated C/EBP and contributes to zone-1 hepatocytes.
