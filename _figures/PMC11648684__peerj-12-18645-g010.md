caption: METTL3 increases the activity of intracellular antioxidant enzymes such as
  SOD, CAT, and GSH-PX to resist oxidative stress by regulating the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.
  Overexpression of FTO up-regulates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial
  biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation, thereby affecting the mitochondrial
  oxidative respiratory chain and enhancing the level of oxidative stress. YTHDF3
  inhibits mitochondrial oxidative stress by regulating PRDX3 in a m6A-dependent manner.
  manner regulates PRDX3 and inhibits mitochondrial oxidative stress. Meanwhile, oxidative
  stress induced by hydrogen peroxide and arsenite increased the level of intracellular
  m6A methyltransferase and thus the overall level of m6A modification. Created with
