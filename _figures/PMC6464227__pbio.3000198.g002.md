caption: Steroids in the left-hand column (the Δ5 pathway) may be acted on by either
  3βHSD1 or 3βHSD2 to yield the corresponding Δ4 steroids. Following the production
  of Preg, the backdoor pathway typically features its conversion to 17OH-Preg, which
  is then converted to the key intermediary, 17OHP. In the brain (and elsewhere),
  progesterone may be converted to the neuroactive steroid, allopregnanolone. 17OHP
  is 5α-reduced by 5αRed1 (SRD5A1) to 5α-pregnan-17α-ol-3,20-dione, which is then
  3α-reduced by AKR1C2 or AKR1C4 to yield 17OH-allopregnanolone. P450c17 catalyzes
  its 17,20 lyase activity very efficiently when 17OH-allopregnanolone is the substrate,
  yielding androsterone, which O’Shaughnessy and colleageus show is the principal
  androgen in human male fetal circulation. Androsterone may then acted on by testicular
  17βHSD3 (or, to a minor degree, by adrenal 17βHSD5 [AKR1C3]) to yield androstanediol,
  which may be 3α-oxidized, probably by 17βHSD6 (HSD17B6; also known as RoDH, to yield
  the most potent androgen, DHT. The work of O’Shaughnessy and colleagues shows that
  the human fetal testis instead uses progesterone produced by the placenta to generate
  the 17OHP that initiates the backdoor pathway. The identities of all of the enzymes
  catalyzing the reductive and oxidative 3αHSD reactions have not been determined
  unambiguously. 17OHP, 17OH-progesterone; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; Preg, pregnenolone;
  RoDH, retinol dehydrogenase.
