caption: Anti-tumoral functions of the inflammasome pathway. (A) The inflammasome
  can suppress tumor cell proliferation and promotes tissue homeostasis and cell differentiation.
  (B) Inflammasome activation favors anti-tumor immunity by enhancing NK and CD8 T
  cell tumorilytic activities. This is primarily mediated by IL-18. Inflammasome triggers
  enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. (C) Pyroptotic cell death
  downstream of inflammasome activation establishes an immunogenic environment through
  the release of several DAMPs and immunostimulatory molecules. Pyroptosis is initiated
  by caspase-dependent processing of gasdermins that form pores leading to osmotic
  lysis of the cell. Certain chemotherapies induce toxicities because of pyroptotic
  death of healthy cells through gasdermins E cleavage by caspase-3.
