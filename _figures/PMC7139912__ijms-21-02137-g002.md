caption: Symplified representation of pro-inflammatory mediators in Wobbler (Wr) mouse
  spinal cord. The figure shows inflammatory pathways that are upregulated in Wr mice.
  Wr mice show increased expression of the high mobility group box 1 alarmin (HMGB1),
  a ligand of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The signaling pathway of TLR4 involves
  MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88), an adapter protein that activates
  nuclear translocation of the p65/p50 subunits of NFκB (nuclear factor kappa B).
  In Wr mice, the NFκB pathway activates and assembles the inflammasome (an intracellular
  multi-protein complex) and stimulates transcription of the inflammasome component
  NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3), and of the pro-interleukins 1β and
  18. Both are converted by caspase 1 into mature IL-1β and IL18, which are secreted
  and stimulate microglial cells to further produce HMGB1, TNFα, IL-18, and IL-1β.
  The similar effect on caspase 1 is produced by TNFα binding to its cognate receptor
  TNFR1. The glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (GRA) CORT113176 shows inhibitory
  effects on HMGB1, TLR4, MyD88, p50/p65 subunits of NFκB, TNFα, TNFR1, and IL18.
  Quantitative aspects of CORT113176 effects are shown in . CORT113176 also reduces
  the density of microglia and astrocytes, cells of origin of the inflammatory mediators.
  In consequence, CORT113176 inhibits pro-inflammatory factors and their cells of
  origin in the Wr spinal cord. (Figure modified from Liu et al. []; data from Wr
  mice ± CORT113176 modified from Meyer et al. [,].)
