caption: DNA damage repair pathways and drug targets. (A) Several internal and external
  stressors such as ionizing radiation, replication stress, ROS, or chemical stress
  can lead to DNA double-strand breaks (DNA DSBs). Depending on cell cycle progression
  and the availability of a template strand, either the nonhomologous end joining
  (NHEJ) or the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway are the mechanism of
  choice for DNA repair. In the NHEJ pathway, DNA damage is recognized by the “DNA-dependent
  protein kinase” (DNA-PK), a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase complex, composed
  of a large catalytic subunit named DNA-PKcs and a heterodimer of Ku proteins (Ku70/80).
  Then, the nuclease Artemis is activated and cleaves 5′- and 3′-DNA overhangs. In
  HRR, which only occurs in the S and the G2 phase of the cell cycle, a protein complex
  termed MRN (which is composed of MRE11, Rad50, and Nbs1) recognizes DNA DSBs. After
  its activation by phosphorylation, the ATM kinase works as a master effector protein
  for HRR by activating several downstream effectors such as the CHK1 or the CHK2
  kinase or the BRCA1 protein, having effects on cell cycle progression via p53 control
  or CDK1 inhibition. Stalled replication forks lead to an arrest of DNA replication
  and such replication stress could lead to DNA DSBs. To prevent this and to stop
  cell cycle progression, the ATR protein kinase is recruited and binds to its partner
  protein ATRIP. Cell cycle regulation and repair mechanisms are then controlled via
  CHK1 activation. Repair of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) is initiated by PARP
  enzymes. (B) In HRR, the MRE protein acts as a nuclease and resects the broken DNA
  ends, which results in the overhanging of single-stranded 3′-ends. Protection from
  further resection or modification of ssDNA is reached by the binding of the RPA
  protein. RAD51 is essential for HRR, as it facilitates DNA unwinding, stretching,
  and invasion into the template strand. To prevent its early polymerization on DNA,
  RAD51 proteins are kept inactive by binding to BRCA2, which is recruited to the
  broken DNA in a complex with BRCA1 and the linker protein PALB2 after detection
  of DNA damage. The RAD51-DNA filament is then capable of invading the template strand.
  (C) The RAD51-DNA filament invades the template strand and searches for extended
  homologous regions, which are then stabilized by base pairing. RAD51 disassembles
  and leaves a heteroduplex of the defective DNA strand and the template strand. The
  invading strand is extended by a DNA polymerase, and after elongation, the newly
  synthesized strand segment is displaced and finally ligated with its original strand
  endings. This figure was created using the BioRender.com online tool.
