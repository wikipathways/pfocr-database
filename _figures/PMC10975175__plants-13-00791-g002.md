caption: (a) Heat stress triggers nitric oxide (NO) production and increases calcium
  levels. Increased calcium concentration through its sensor proteins activates genes
  GSNOR (S-nitrosoglutathione reductase) and HOT5 (hot temperature 5), thus fine-tuning
  NO levels. NO leads to S-nitrosylation of cysteine in NPR1 (non-expresser of pathogenesis-related),
  mediating heat stress responses. ROS-driven systemic signaling converges with NPR
  genes, activating RBOHD (respiratory burst oxidase homolog D) via related to apetala
  2 (RAP2). This triggers NOA1 (NO-associated) genes, initiating heat stress responses
  (HSR), including oxidative defenses, osmolyte accumulation, and heat shock proteins
  (HSPs). (b) The heat stress signal is detected at the plasma membrane by a sensor.
  This signal is then relayed through calcium (Ca2+) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
  signaling pathways, resulting in the activation of L-cysteine desulfhydrase (LCD),
  D-cysteine desulfhydrase (DCD), cysteine synthase (CS) for hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
  production. H2S interacts with transcription factors, driving the transcription
  of antioxidants, osmolytes, and heat shock proteins (HSPs), thereby enhancing cell
  thermotolerance
