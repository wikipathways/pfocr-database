caption: The protein-protein interaction network and SPIA analysis of the 28 up-regulated
  genes related to positive regulation of cell proliferation and 21 down- regulated
  genes related to negative control of cell proliferation. The network (A) was mapped
  using STRING, and the confidence parameter was set as 0.15. Lines between proteins
  stand for possible interactions, and are color-coded based on the type of interaction.
  In SPIA analysis (B), X-axis indicates probability to observe differentially expressed
  genes on the pathway; y-axis refers to the probability to observe perturbation of
  genes within pathways. Each number refers to a KEGG pathway ID. Pathways above the
  blue line are significant at 5% after FDR correction; those above the red lines
  are significant at 5% after Bonferroni correction. 49 genes were analyzed by SPIA
  analysis. The Notch pathway is shown as a yellow dot and TGF-beta pathway is shown
  as a green dot.
