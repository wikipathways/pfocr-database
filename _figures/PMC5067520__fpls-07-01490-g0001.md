caption: Scheme representation of very-long-chain fatty acid elongation. This process
  takes place on cytosolic side of the ER membrane. It is alimented by acetyl-CoA
  and acyl-CoA originating from the cytoplasm-located glycolysis and plastid-resident
  FA elongation pathway, respectively. Plastids provides 16 or 18 carbon-long acyl-CoA
  (i.e., palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoA) to be elongated. The first committed step to
  VLCFA elongation cycle is catalyzed by the β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS), which
  condenses malonyl-CoA (synthesized by carboxylation of acetyl-CoA moieties) with
  palmitoyl- or stearoyl-CoA. Resulting products are then reduced into β-hydroxacyl-CoA
  (step 2) before losing a molecule of water (step 3); the latter reaction of which
  is mediated by the β-hydroxacyl-CoA dehydratase (HCD). Upon dehydration, β-enoyl-CoA
  undergo reduction (step 4), forming acyl-CoA that harbor two additional carbons.
  These products can either be oriented toward sphingolipid, wax and triacylglyceride
  synthesis depending on tissue specificity and cell requirement or reenter VLCFA
  elongation cycle until its length reaches 28 carbons in Arabidopsis or more in other
  plant species. Each cycle turn consumes one molecule of ATP and two of NADPH+H+.
