caption: Graphical abstract. The proposed mechanism by which ATX inhibition regulates
  the pathological development of FCAVD is illustrated in the schematic diagram. In
  diseased valves, an inflammatory environment emerges, causing immune cells such
  as macrophages to infiltrate the valvular tissue and release inflammatory cytokines
  (e.g., IL-1β). ① This IL-1β upregulates the expression of LPAR1, which strengthens
  the action of ATX-LPA. In addition, Lp(a) carrying ATX and LPC accumulates in the
  valves, while activated VICs secrete additional ATX [12, 31]. ② ATX subsequently
  converts LPC into LPA, which binds to the increased LPA receptor (LPAR), activating
  the TGF-β signaling pathway [32]. ③ In turn, this activation promotes fibro-calcific
  remodeling by inducing the expression of CTGF and IL-6 via the TGF-β signaling axis.
  Importantly, ATX inhibition specifically hinders the activation of ATX-LPA enhancing
  TGF-β-linked signaling and ultimately alleviating fibrosis and calcium deposition
  in the activated VICs
