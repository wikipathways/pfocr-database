caption: '[Left] In hypoxic conditions, HIFs stabilize, translocate into the nucleus,
  and bind to the HRE, thereby inducing the expression of their target genes. In the
  presence of oxygen, HIFs are continuously degraded by the canonical PHD/pVHL-mediated
  pathway. The regulatory mechanism of FIH-1 also contributes to the inhibition of
  HIF activity. [Right] NRF2 maintains cellular redox homeostasis in response to oxidative
  stress, which can be induced by an excess oxygen environment. ROS/electrophiles
  and nonelectrophiles, such as p62, can inhibit NRF2-KEAP1 interactions to activate
  NRF2 target gene expression. This inhibition occurs through the KEAP1 Cys modification
  and competition with KEAP1 for binding to NRF2. Additionally, as a KEAP1-independent
  regulatory pathway, NRF2 phosphorylation by GSK-3β leads to β-TrCP-mediated proteasomal
  degradation of NRF2'
