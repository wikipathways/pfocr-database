caption: 'The ultra-structures, components, and functions of intermitochondrial cement
  (IMC) and mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) in male germ cells are summarized.
  (A) TEM image showing the morphology of IMC and MAMs (yellow rectangle area) in
  spermatocytes. M: mitochondria; ER: endoplasmic reticulum. (B) The summary of the
  components and functions of IMC (also called pi-bodies), piP-bodies, and MAMs in
  Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis during mouse spermatogenesis. After piRNA
  precursors are exported from the nucleus, they process by factors located in the
  IMC into piRNA intermediates, then load to MILI protein and are cleaved, generating
  mature primary piRNA with 1U signature. The MILI-bound piRNA then engages in the
  ping-pong cycle leading to the cleavage of complementary antisense transcripts,
  producing secondary piRNA with 10A signature, and then are loaded to either MILI
  or MIWI2. Loading of MIWI2 with secondary piRNA induces its translocation into the
  nucleus where it functions in the methylation and silencing to transposable elements
  (TEs) together with other nuclear factors. However, the components of MAMs and how
  MAMs regulate the piRNA pathway still need to be further explored. Non-standard
  abbreviations in this review are shown: IMC, intermitochondrial cement; CB, chromatoid
  body; MAMs, mitochondria-associated ER membranes; TEM, transmission electron microscope;
  MVH, mouse vasa homolog; TDRD1/MTR-1, Tudor domain-containing 1/Mouse Tudor repeat-1;
  TDRD6, Tudor domain-containing 6; MOV10L1, Moloney leukemia virus 10 like 1; TDRKH,
  Tudor and KH domain-containing protein.'
