caption: 'Schematic depiction of chromium resistance and toxicology in bacterial cell:
  (1) chromate due to the structural similarity with sulfate enters the bacterial
  cell through sulfate transporter encoded by the chromosomal DNA. (2) Plasmid DNA
  encoded efflux systems are used to expel the intracellular chromates outside the
  bacterial cell to resist the chromate toxicity. (3) Aerobic Cr6+ reduction into
  Cr3+ involves soluble reductase which requires NAD(P)H as an electron donor while
  anaerobic Cr6+ reduction occurs in the electron transport pathway by cytochrome
  b (cyt b) or cytochrome c (cyt c) along the respiratory chains in the inner membrane;
  Cr3+ cannot pass the bacterial cell membranes due to the insolubility of Cr3+ derivatives.
  (4) Membrane-embedded chromate reductase which is encoded by the chromosomal DNA,
  reduces Cr6+ anaerobically in the presence of electron donors. (5) Cr5+ produced
  during the redox cycle of Cr6+ produces oxidative stress by the production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). (6) To combat the ROS generated oxidative stress, protective
  metabolic enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione are secreted. Some
  outer membrane proteins are also involved to counter the oxidative stress. (7) Cr6+
  and principally Cr3+ not only negatively affects DNA replication and RNA transcription
  by damaging DNA but also alters gene expression. In addition, Cr3+ also damages
  proteins by impairing their functions. (8) DNA repair system is activated in order
  to repair the damaged DNA (Source: Ahemad ).'
