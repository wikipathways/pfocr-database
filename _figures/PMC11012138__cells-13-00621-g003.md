caption: Mechanism of oxygen sensing and HIF pathway activation in embryonic neurogenesis.
  (A) During early development, oxygen delivery to the embryonic neocortex is limited
  by the lack of vasculature. As a result, HIF-1α signaling is high in aRG cells,
  which promotes self-renewal. As neurogenesis progresses the ingrowth of blood vessels
  basally from VZ creates more oxygenated zones where more committed progenitor cells
  reside. These progenitors divide to produce postmitotic progeny, although its ultimate
  fate (neuronal or glial) appears to be regulated primarily by the developmental
  timing. The oxygen levels are also not uniform along the apicobasal axis, which
  adds another layer to the niche complexity. Although aRG cells reside in physiologically
  hypoxic regions, very low oxygen levels or anoxia can have adverse effects on progenitor
  proliferation and survival. (B) The effects of HIF-1α activity on different cell
  types in the developing neocortex. Activation of the HIF pathway generally maintains
  stemness and promotes survival and proliferation of aRG cells. This occurs at the
  expense of differentiative divisions and the production of more committed basal
  progenitors. This phenotype is caused at least in part, by increased glycolysis
  and HIF-dependent expression of trophic proteins such as EPO. Additionally, HIF
  promotes the expression of transcription factors such as Pax6 while being associated
  with the repression of differentiation markers such as Tbr2. However, the degree
  to which these genes are directly regulated by HIF is largely unknown. Moreover,
  the role of HIF in regulating basal progenitor subtypes is so far not understood.
  In newly generated neurons HIF-1α is critical for survival and may affect migration.
  HIF-1α also induces VEGF production by NPCs which is necessary for cortical vascularization.
  In glial progenitors HIF activity is particularly important for survival and proliferation
  of OPCs, while putting the brakes on oligodendrocyte maturation via Dlx3 and Ascl2
  regulation. While HIF-2α is unlikely to be required for embryonic NPCs it plays
  a role in perinatal neuron survival, myelination and likely in ECs. (C) HIF signaling
  cross talks with other signaling pathways during neurogenesis. HIF-1α co-activates
  the transcription of Notch target genes such as hes-1 by binding to HRE elements
  directly as well as interacting with the Notch ICD. In addition, Notch can potentiate
  HIF-1α activity by sequestering FIH-1. HIF-1α also enhances Wnt signaling by inducing
  the expression of Tcf-1 and Lef-1 transcription factors, which bind β-catenin to
  activated Wnt-dependent transcription
