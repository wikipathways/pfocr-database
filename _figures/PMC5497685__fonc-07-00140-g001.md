caption: Ca2+ regulates different steps of autophagy. Extracellular Ca2+ can enter
  the cell via the TRPM2 channel, where it activates CaMKII that phosphorylates Beclin
  1, promoting its binding to Bcl-2 and blocking autophagy initiation. Beclin 1 can
  also be scaffolded to the IP3R, which also limits autophagy promotion. IP3Rs are
  responsible for fueling mitochondria with Ca2+, which supports the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle and the resulting ATP production. The presence of an adequate ATP/AMP
  ratio suppresses the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)–mechanistic target of rapamycin
  (mTOR)–unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) axis and thus autophagy induction. Autophagosome
  maturation can be inhibited by the TRPML3 channel mostly expressed in endosomes,
  while fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes can be blocked by basal RyR activity.
  Ca2+ release through lysosomal nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)-activated
  TPC2 channels can be further amplified by Ca2+ release from IP3Rs resulting in stimulation
  of the CaMKKβ–AMPK pathway and autophagosome formation. Ca2+ release from the lysosomes
  can, however, affect lysosomal pH and so abrogate fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes
  as well as the further lysosome-dependent degradation. TRPML1, another lysosomal
  channel, can be regulated by different factors, including lysosomal mTOR, PI(3,5)P2
  or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ca2+ released from TRPML1 activates calcineurin,
  which binds and dephosphorylates TFEB and promotes its nuclear translocation, where
  TFEB induces transcription of various autophagy-related and lysosomal biogenesis
  genes. Plain black arrows indicate activatory and inhibitory pathways; dashed arrows
  indicate intracellular movement.
