caption: Molecular inhibition of the NFκB pathway by NR4As in macrophages/microglia.
  (A) GSK-3 phosphorylates the NFκB p65 subunit, which allows for docking of NR4A
  on NFκB bound to DNA promoter region. NR4A1 or NR4A2 is then capable of recruiting
  CoREST, which removes the NFκB subunits from their target DNA. This process, where
  NR4A acts as an intermediate to mediate transcriptional repression without directly
  binding to DNA is termed transrepression. (B) Interaction of NR4A1 with NFκB is
  inhibited by p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Once so phosphorylated, NR4A1 no longer inhibits
  the NFκB pathway and the inflammatory response is maintained. The chemical compound
  n-pentyl 2-(3,5-dihydroxy-2-nonanoylphenyl)acetate (PDNPA) inhibits the interaction
  between p38 and NR4A1 and could thus be used as an inhibitor of inflammation.
