caption: Schematic representation of miRNAs involved in the regulation of atrophy
  and protein degradation pathways in skeletal muscle tissue. Insulin-like growth
  factor 1 (IGF-1) activates the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, responsible for protein
  synthesis. Akt inhibits the degradation of proteins by keeping inactive in the cytoplasm
  transcription factors members of the forkhead box protein O (FoxO) family (FoxO1,
  FoxO3 and FoxO4), which otherwise migrate in the nucleus and promote the transcription
  of the E3 ligases (Atrogin1 and MuRF1), responsible for the protein degradation
  mediated by the system of the ubiquitin proteasome. In the nucleus FoxO3 is also
  able to promote the transcription of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light
  chain 3 (LC3) and BCL2 Interacting Protein 3 (BNIP3) which once in the cytoplasm
  localize on the outer membrane of the mitochondria, promoting mitophagy through
  the recruitment of the autophagosome. The Akt/mTOR pathway is also able to promote
  the activation of the factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) which, associating with peroxisome
  proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α), induces mitochondrial
  biogenesis. Akt activation is inhibited by phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)
  which inhibits the phosphorylation of PIP2 to PIP3. Several in vitro and in vivo
  studies have shown that elevated circulating levels of miR-1, miR-133a/b and miR-206
  appear to negatively regulate the IGF-1/Akt/mTOR pathway, by targeting positive
  regulators IGF-1 and IGF1-receptor (IGF-1R) thus promoting muscle wasting. On the
  contrary, miR-486 and miR-182 promote protein synthesis, by targeting negative regulators
  of this signaling pathway (PTEN, FoxO1-3). miR-21 and miR-29 contained in the exosomes
  can penetrate the muscle fiber and activating the TLR7/8 located on the endoplasmic
  reticulum promoting i) the activation of JNK which induces apoptosis of the muscle
  fiber and ii) NF-kB which, migrating in the nucleus, promotes the transcription
  of Atrogin1 and MuRF1, responsible for protein degradation. miR21 and miR29 in skeletal
  muscle tissue are also able to negatively regulate mitochondrial biogenesis by targeting
  YY1. Finally, the signaling pathway induced by myostatin activates SMADs (2-3-4)
  which, by moving to the nucleus, inhibit muscle growth. Dashed arrows indicate the
  pathways that lead to muscle wasting. Dashed lines indicate the inhibitory function
  of miRNAs in skeletal muscle tissue. Black arrows indicate the pathways involved
  in muscle homeostasis.
