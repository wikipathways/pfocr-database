caption: Best networks of the 5 top scoring siRNAs from the MAPK pathway for HRV infection
  for the different compared methods are displayed. (A) shows the known KEGG pathway.
  (B) is the inferred NEM and (C) the sc-NEM. (D) left shows the known network with
  the most likely attachment of the hidden variable Z (blue) and (E) is the inferred
  NEMix. For all networks their performance is summarized in . Subfigure (F) summarizes
  robustness of the MAPK network inference. For the inferred MAPK signaling networks
  on the HRV infection data, we assessed robustness of the accuracy for edge recovery.
  Box-plots display the result of 50 bootstrap samples for the three compared methods,
  on the 5 gene (n = 5) and 8 gene (n = 8) network.
