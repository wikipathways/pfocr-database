caption: 'Recognition of particulate and soluble β-glucans by dectin-1 and signal
  transduction in macrophages and DCs. When particulate β-glucan binds, dectin-1 molecules
  cluster, which excludes CD45 and CD148 and enables Src to associate and phosphorylate
  the hemITAM motif of dectin-1. Syk then binds to the phosphorylated hemITAM domain.
  In contrast, when dectin-1 is empty or is bound to small soluble β-glucan, it cannot
  exclude the CD45 and CD148 phosphatases, which remove the phosphate from the hemITAM
  domain. Therefore, no signal or only a weak signal is generated. Syk-mediated phagocytosis
  occurs instantly while the so-called integrated transcriptional response (ITR) begins
  with PLCγ activation. Three major pathways exist in the ITR: 1) CBM complex modulates
  the signaling for NF-κB via NEMO complex and, in parallel, activates MAPK to activate
  AP-1 expression after PKCδ activation; 2) Syk also triggers PLCγ, and subsequently
  calcineurin, which eventually turns on NFAT; 3) following Syk-dependent ROS production
  by NADPH oxidase, NLRP3 initiates IL-1 processing. In addition to ITR, β-glucans
  trigger the TLR2/6 dimeric receptor to attract MyD88 protein, which activates a
  series of kinases to activate on the NEMO/IKK complex, which finally induces NF-κB,
  which is also activated independent of Syk. In this Syk-independent pathway, Raf-1
  induces p60 and this nuclear factor subsequently induces NF-κB. BCL-10: B cell lymphoma
