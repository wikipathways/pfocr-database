caption: Multi-scaffolding molecule IQGAP1 assembles PI4K, PIP5KIα and PI3K at functional
  proximity for streamlining PI3,4,5P3synthesis from PI and AKT/PKB activation. IQGAP1
  scaffolding of PI3K pathway components has potential to occur at any cellular membrane
  including plasma membrane and endomembrane compartments. This introduces novel concept
  and mechanism in activation of AKT/PKB. RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; GPCR, G-protein
  coupled receptor; Int., integrins; PM, plasma membrane.
