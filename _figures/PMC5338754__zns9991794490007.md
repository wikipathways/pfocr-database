caption: 'Schematic diagram of proposed mechanism of reciprocal interaction between
  IP3 and ryanodine receptors in the induction of hyperalgesic priming. Activation
  of PKCε (in males, only) by the priming stimulus in the peripheral terminal of an
  IB4+ nociceptor (right side of figure) triggers a cascade of events that ultimately
  produces hyperalgesic priming (; ; ; ), which includes calcium release from ER and
  requires both ryanodine (RyR) and IP3 (IP3R) receptors, activation of αCaMKII, and
  cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) (). Direct activation
  of RyR and IP3R also produces priming, in males and females. We hypothesize that
  release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from ER stores, causing a local increase in [Ca2+]i
  (dashed and magnified boxes, middle) (; , ) is a key factor required for the induction
  of priming. The suggested interaction between RyR and IP3R, by Ca2+ released through
  these ionotropic receptors, is shown in the magnified box. Once outside the ER,
  Ca2+ can activate nearby RyR and IP3R, increasing [Ca2+]i even more, via CICR, to
  reach a level high enough to trigger mechanisms, such as calmodulin and αCaMKII
  (, ; ), leading to induction of priming (). The ER calcium pump, SERCA, transports
  the Ca2+ released into the cytosol, back to stores, to refill them, restricting
  Ca2+ signals spatially and temporally, a “loop” mechanism that has been associated
  with the development of neuroplasticity (; ; ; ; ). Additional Ca2+ buffering in
  the cytosol limits the fast diffusion of Ca2+, supporting its local accumulation.
  Thus, the whole system of RyR and IP3R can be triggered by administration of IP3
  or ryanodine. When the concentration of agonists reaches a certain level, the effective
  doses able to induce priming () (a), the local cascade of propagating CICR becomes
  self-supported. We believe this “small” (in the scale of the whole cell), but long-lasting,
  change in Ca2+ homeostasis is a crucial factor for the development of hyperalgesic
  priming. In contrast, when the Ca2+ signal produced is strong but of short duration,
  for example, that produced by calcium ionophore, due to the bell-shaped sensitivity
  of RyR and IP3R for [Ca2+]i, the production of the self-supported long-lasting local
  [Ca2+]i increase is prevented, and hyperalgesic priming does not develop. Although
  the direct interaction between the receptors is important to generate amplification,
  we consider Ca2+ a key mediator of the reported reciprocal modulation of RyR and
  IP3R, and the amount of Ca2+ initially released is the most important factor in
  the mechanism, regardless of which receptor is stimulated. This constitutes our
  paradigm of “the common (shared) amplifier,” postulating the amplification of Ca2+
  signals produced by either input (RyR or IP3R), which explains the similarity in
  the difference between males and females in the sensitivity to be primed by either
  IP3 or ryanodine. Although this amplification system is present in both males and
  females, it is less potent in males (a 100,000-fold difference). In regard of the
  higher sensitivity of females to be primed by ryanodine or IP3, the action of estrogen
  on EsRα (left) potentiates the amplification system, likely by sensitizing the ER
  receptors, as suggested by previous reports: modulation of RyR by estrogen-PKA signaling
  () or potentiation of IP3R by estrogen through metabotropic glutamate receptor 1,
  phospholipase C, and generation of IP3 () (left, large arrow). This latter pathway
  could also result in tonic sensitization of IP3R in females, due to an increased
  basal IP3 levels. As shown in  and , tonic activation of EsR in cultured male nociceptors,
  by incubation in the presence of β-estradiol, also potentiates their sensitivity
  to both ryanodine and IP3. This finding suggests that the sensitizing machinery
  of EsR is also present in males, but probably not active enough due to a lower level
  (or lack) of estrogen. Nevertheless, there is still a possibility that the EsRα-dependent
  sensitization in females (as well as in males, when activated) is indirect, due
  to the suppression of some blocking pathway active in males and females when EsRα
  is not stimulated. Although little is known about endogenous competitive antagonists
  shared by RyR and IP3R, according to our “shared amplification system paradigm,”
  suppression of either RyR and IP3R by their antagonists, including endogenous (;
  ; ), could indeed reduce the sensitivity of the whole system (as shown in , b).
  Whether this mechanism is involved in the observed difference between males and
  females in our study remains to be a determined.'
