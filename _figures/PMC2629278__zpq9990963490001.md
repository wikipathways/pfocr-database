caption: Two alternative models for the role of CYCLOPS in symbiosis signaling. (A)
  The model of the Sym pathway according to Yano et al. (). Symbiotic signals are
  perceived by appropriate receptor complexes, activation of which will lead to a
  signaling cascade within the Sym pathway. Because cyclops mutants show spontaneous
  nodulation it is interpreted that CYCLOPS acts as a branching point in the pathway,
  where fungal and bacterial infection are regulated in a CYCLOPS-dependent manner
  and nodule organogenesis is regulated in a CYCLOPS-independent manner. This finding
  suggests that NSP1, NSP2, and ERN1 transcription factors have dual roles in both
  the bacterial infection branch and the nodule organogenesis branch as mutants in
  these genes are impaired in both. (B) An alternative model for the Sym pathway.
  Because cyclops mutants show greatly reduced levels of spontaneous nodulation it
  is interpreted that CYCLOPS is required for nodule organogenesis, but that the cyclops
  mutants have low penetrance. Low penetrance allows a more parsimonious Sym pathway
  in which CYCLOPS has analogous functions to all other members of the Sym pathway.
  The pathway bifurcates into nodulation-specific and mycorrhization-specific branches,
  each governed by their own set of transcription factors. NF, Nod factor. Pictures
  of a root nodule on L. japonicus and an arbuscule of Glomus versiforme in an M.
  truncatula root cortical cell stained with WGA Alexa Fluor 488 are shown at right.
