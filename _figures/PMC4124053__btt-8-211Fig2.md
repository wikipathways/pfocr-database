caption: 'Reverse signaling in the pharmacodynamics of TNF-α antagonists promotes
  apoptosis.Notes: The TNF-α antagonists may interact with the transmembranal receptor
  TNFR2, promoting a reverse signal which blocks the NF-κB pathway, resulting in the
  blockage of FLIP. In this way caspase 8 is activated to unlock the caspase 3 cascade
  which initiates apoptosis. Furthermore, there is the pro-apoptotic signal from the
  mitochondrial pathway, where the reverse signal activates the p53 protein; this
  protein recruits proapoptotic proteins such as bcl-2 which interact with cytochrome
  C, which in turn form the apoptosome, resulting in the activation of caspase 3.
  The Smac-DIABLO protein blocks the anti-apoptotic protein IAP, allowing the activation
  of caspase 3, causing apoptosis. Reprinted with permission from The Journal of Rheumatology.
