caption: Hyperglycemia activates the key components of the Nox2 holoenzyme, and also
  increases Rac1 transcription by modifying its DNA methylation and histone methylation.
  Activated Nox2 increases ROS production, and sustained increase in ROS damages the
  mitochondria. Capillary cell apoptosis is accelerated, which ultimately leads to
  the development of diabetic retinopathy. Hyperglycemia also induces many metabolic
  abnormalities that can generate ROS, and themselves are also influenced by ROS.
  POP = polyol pathway, PKC = protein kinase C and AGEs = advanced glycation end products.
