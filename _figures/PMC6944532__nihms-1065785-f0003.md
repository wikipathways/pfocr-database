caption: '(A) PIK3CA plays a key role by recruiting other proteins to the membrane,
  activating signaling cascades involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation,
  motility, and morphology. In normal cells, cells are simulated by growth factors
  (such as receptor tyrosine kinase), PIK3CA is brought to cell membrane through binding
  of p85 to phospho-IRS1, thereby converting PIP2 to PIP3. An E545K mutation located
  in the helical domain of PIK3CA improves the ability of the protein to associate
  with IRS1 and aids in converting PIP2 to PIP3, thereby rewiring the oncogenic signaling
  pathway in cancer. (B) Gain of dileucine motifs (red spheres) induced by mutations
  in cytosolic intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of GLUT1 and CACNA1H in the
  cellular membrane and ITPR1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may result in mislocalization
  from the plasma membrane to endocytic compartments. (C) C-to-T mutations and CC-to-TT
  substitutions in the TERT promoter gain binding sites for transcription factors
  (TFs) from the ETS family, thus, promoting over expression of TERT and resulting
  in tumor development. (D) C-to-A mutations in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of
  GEPT1 gain a binding site for miR-206*, and ultimately reduce expression of GEPT1
  by inhibiting translation. Abbreviations: IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; SLiM,
  short linear motif; TERT, telomerase reverse transcriptase; TFBSs, TF binding sites.'
