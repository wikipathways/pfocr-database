caption: During pathogen infection, BLI-3-generated ROS may be utilized (A) by SKPO-1
  to generate more potent antimicrobials (B) to maintain protective barriers; (C)
  to activate DAF-16, via oxidation of CST-1, to increase the expression of protective
  immune response genes; and/or (D) as a signaling molecule to activate SKN-1, via
  the p38 MAPK pathway, to maintain redox homeostasis during infection. Alternatively,
  pathogen infection stimulates the release of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS). These mtROS
  (E) facilitate HIF-1 and AMPK-dependent immunity. (F) Alternatively, during infection,
  wounding-dependent release of calcium causes mtROS release, relieving repression
  of protective actin assembly via oxidation of RHO-1.
