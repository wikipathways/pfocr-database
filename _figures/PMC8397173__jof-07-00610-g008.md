caption: A proposed model depicting the outcomes after Sln1 loss in S. scitamineum.
  Loss of Sln1 results in increased phosphorylation of Hog1. The levels of Hog1 phosphorylation
  are suppressed via induction of the negative regulator Ptp2, which is initiated
  by the transcription factor Atf1. Loss of Sln1 function causes increased mating
  and virulence of S. scitamineum, by possibly enhancing Hog1 activity to promote
  the transcription of Prf1. Furthermore, the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway positively
  regulates mating and virulence by the transcription factor Prf1. TF represents a
  transcription factor.
