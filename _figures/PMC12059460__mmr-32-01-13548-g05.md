caption: 'HPE inhibits allergic rhinitis by modulating the AMPK/SHP1/SHP2/STING signaling
  pathway. HPE promotes the NF-κB signaling pathway through activation of AMPK, and
  NF-κB directly activates SHP2 on the one hand, and SHP1 on the other hand via C/EBPα/PU.1.
  SHP1 inhibits STING, and SHP2 inhibits TBK1, thereby inhibiting the STING/TBK1 signaling
  pathway, which mediates inflammatory responses and promotes mitochondrial via IRF3
  Oxidative Stress. Mitochondrial oxidative stress upregulates the expression of cGAMP
  and P53: cGAMP binds to STING and stabilizes its dimers and oligomers; P53 inhibits
  SHP1 and SHP2, and promotes the expression of both SYK and EGFR. STING interacts
  with EGFR, leading to the autophosphorylation of EGFR and activation of SYK, which
  then phosphorylates STING and EGFR at Y240 and Y245 sites, respectively. SYK and
  EGFR phosphorylate STING at the Y240 and Y245 sites, respectively, promoting its
  translocation to ERGIC for signaling. cGAMP, cyclic GMP-AMP; EGFR, epidermal growth
  factor; HPE, human placental extracts; IFN, interferon; IRF3, IFN regulatory factor
  3; OVA, ovalbumin; SHP, Src homology 2-containing phosphatase; SYK, spleen tyrosine
  kinase'
