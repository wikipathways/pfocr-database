caption: ABHD6 is strategically positioned to regulate 2-AG levels at the site of
  its generation. ABHD6 is an integral membrane protein localizing to the post-synaptic
  neuronal membrane. The PLC-DAGLα pathway cleaves the membrane phospholipid PIP2
  to generate 2-AG for retrograde signalling through pre-synaptic CB1Rs (). Immunohistochemical
  studies indicate that in neurones ABHD6 localizes to sites of 2-AG generation, including
  post-synaptic dendrites of principal glutamatergic neurones as well as some GABAergic
  interneurones (). 3D structure of ABHD6 has not been resolved but the catalytic
  triad (depicted as mouth) is predicted to face the cytosol/intracellular membrane
  ().
