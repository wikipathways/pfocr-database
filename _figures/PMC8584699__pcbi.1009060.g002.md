caption: 'The central carbon metabolism of an E. coli core model (blue rectangular:
  Glycolysis, pink square: Pentose Phosphate Pathway, yellow circle: TCA cycle) was
  used in order to create two E. coli strains: one that consumes glucose (left) and
  one that consumes acetate (right), after the deletion of the reactions marked with
  red crosses. The best solution of the community gap-filling algorithm predicted
  the addition of the reactions represented by continuous blue arrows and the activation
  of the existing reactions represented by dashed blue arrows, in order to restore
  biomass production in the two models. The dashed black arrows show the exchange
  reactions for glucose and acetate in the community. The metabolites in bold represent
  biomass precursors. The numbered deleted reactions are: (1) PGM, (2) MALS, (3) SUCOAS,
  (4) PFL, (5) PTAr, (6) GLCpts, (7) CS. The numbered added and activated reactions
  are: (1) POX, (2) CS, (3) PKETF, (4) EDD and EDA, (5) PDH, (6) ACS, (7) ACKr, (8)
  ME1.'
