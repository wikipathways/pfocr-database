caption: 'a | Growth factors such as insulin stimulate PI3K to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3), which promotes the phosphorylation (P) of AKT at Thr308 by phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1). AKT phosphorylates tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) on multiple
  sites to inhibit its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for the small GTPase
  RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB). GTP-loaded RHEB then activates mammalian
  TOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Growth factors also stimulate mTORC2 by promoting its association
  with ribosomes in a PI3K-dependent manner. b | Amino acids stimulate mTORC1 by promoting
  the conversion of RAS-related GTP-binding protein (RAG) heterodimers to the active
  conformation, in which RAGA or RAGB is loaded with GTP and RAGC or RAGD is loaded
  with GDP. c | In response to low energy (high AMP/ATP ratio), AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR) at Ser792
  and TSC2 at Ser1387, leading to the inhibition of mTORC1. d | During the inhibition
  of the Hippo pathway component large tumour suppressor homologue (LATS) kinase,
  hypophosphorylated Yes-associated protein (YAP) translocates to the nucleus and
  promotes the expression of the microRNA miR-29. miR-29 targets PTEN mRNA and inhibits
  PTEN translation, which leads to increased levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 and the activation
  of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Dashed arrows represent translocation of the molecule.
  e | Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activates the TSC complex by phosphorylating
  TSC2 at Ser1379 and Ser1383. Phosphorylation of these two residues requires priming
  by AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of Ser1387. WNT signalling inhibits GSK3β and
  the TSC complex, and thus activates mTORC1. mTORC2 is activated by WNT in a manner
  dependent on the small GTPase RAC1. Proteins shown in green promote mTOR activity
  or their activity is promoted by mTOR. Proteins shown in red inhibit mTOR activity
  or their activity is inhibited by mTOR. Phosphorylation depicted in yellow is an
  activation signal and phosphorylation depicted in orange is an inhibitory signal.
