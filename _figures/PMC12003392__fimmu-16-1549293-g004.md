caption: 'Differential regulation of host metabolic pathway by C. albicans: Left panel:
  In response to C. albicans β-glucans, primarily exposed on yeast form, host cell
  responds by enhancing glycolysis, OXPHOS, and glutamine metabolism. This metabolic
  shift triggers anti-fungal responses by supporting ROS production and cytokine response.
  Enhanced glycolysis results in elevated lactate levels, which limits β -glucans
  expression and drives glycolysis in C. albicans, depleting glucose from extracellular
  milieu. Right panel: Reduced exposure of β -glucans on hyphae form of C. albicans
  fails to activate glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, leading to reduced
  mitochondrial ROS production and cytokine response. This setting favors C. albicans
  survival'
