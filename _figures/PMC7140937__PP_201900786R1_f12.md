caption: Hypothesized role of the miR159-GAMYB pathway in tobacco. A, GAMYB mRNA in
  vegetative tissues. The presence of miR159 strongly repressed GAMYB expression,
  resulting in no obvious phenotypic impact. B, Upon pathogen infection, miR159 is
  repressed (via an unknown mechanism, potentially silencing suppressors), enabling
  the GAMYB mRNA to be expressed. The transcription factor activates defense response
  pathways, including the HR, causing cell death to limit pathogen infection.
