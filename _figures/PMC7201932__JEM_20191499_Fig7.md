caption: Graphical summaries. (A) Mosaic-activating SMAD3 mutation accelerates osteogenesis
  in affected cells cultured in conventional osteogenic media without BMP2. (B) Osteogenesis-stimulating
  effect of BMP2 is dampened by the mosaic-activating SMAD3 mutation in affected cells
  that were cultured in osteogenic media supplemented with BMP2. Cell growth–associated
  gene expression is significantly down-regulated by the gain-of-function SMAD3 mutation,
  regardless of BMP2 presence. P in red circle denotes phosphorylation on TGF-β receptors,
  BMP2 receptors, and C-terminal SxxS motif of SMAD3 protein. Thickness of arrows
  indicates levels of gene expression in response to signaling via TGF-β/SMAD and
  BMP2/SMAD pathways. Thicker arrows indicate higher gene expression.
