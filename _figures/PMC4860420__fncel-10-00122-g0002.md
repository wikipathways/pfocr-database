caption: Reelin signaling mechanisms in brain development and function. Reelin is
  secreted as a full-length protein that contains three large cleavable domains, an
  Nt, a C, and a Ct domain. The central domain binds to ApoER2 and VLDLR receptors,
  which internalize the ligand and transduce the Reelin signal by activating Src/Fyn
  kinases that phosphorylate the adaptor protein Dab1. Downstream of this canonical
  pathway, distinct signaling cascades regulate specific biologic activities at different
  times during brain development. (A) Prenatally, Reelin controls neuronal migration
  and cortical layer formation through the Crk/C3G/Rap1 pathway. This signaling cascade
  regulates the function of cell adhesion molecules, including nectin3, N-Cadherin,
  and Integrin α5β1, which facilitate somal translocation and cellular layer formation.
  (B) During early postnatal development, the Crk adaptor proteins and the PI3K-Akt-mTOR
  pathway contribute to Reelin activity by promoting protein translation, dendrite
  outgrowth and spine development. (C) In the late postnatal and adult brain Reelin
  affects synaptic function and plasticity. This activity is mediated in part by ApoER2,
  which interacts with the NMDAR through PSD-95, causing Ca2+ influx and the activation
  of CamKII. An unknown receptor also mediates the activation of the MEK-Erk1/2 pathway
  by Src/Fyn kinases. Together these signaling pathways promote synaptic activity
  and plasticity through the induction of immediate-early genes involved in learning
  and memory such as those containing LRN enhancers.
