caption: Model of CX3CL1-induced breast carcinogenesis in ErbB2 transgenic mice. We
  propose that CX3CL1 is not involved in tumor initiation, which is probably mediated
  by ErbB2 mutagenesis. In this model, CX3CL1 would promote the progression of small
  or preneoplastic lesions in the mammary gland by enhancing ERK pathway activation
  through transactivation of the ErbB receptor family. Direct activation of this mitogenic
  pathway by PyMT would overcome the effect of CX3CL1 on breast tumorigenesis in Tg-PyMT
  mice. HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF; AR, amphiregulin, ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease.
