caption: PKCϵ regulation in neuroprotection against ASPD. ASPD reduces PKCϵ expression
  in rat hippocampal neurons and causes synaptic loss. ASPD also dephosphorylates
  and activates GSK-3β, which is responsible for hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein,
  forming neurofibrillary tangles. PKCϵ activators, such as DCPLA-ME, restore PKCϵ
  expression and prevent Aβ-induced synaptic loss. Endogenous PKC activators, such
  as arachidonic acid or Ca2+ from neuronal signaling, would have a similar effect.
  ApoE3 + cholesterol also protects against Aβ induced neurotoxicity. LRP-1 antibody
  and PKCϵ-specific inhibitors block the apoE3-mediated protection against ASPD. ApoE3
  bound to cholesterol acts through the PKCϵ signaling pathway via LRP-1 to induce
  neuroprotection and synaptogenesis.
