caption: Reaction scheme with different nitrogen sources. The reaction scheme around
  the GS-GOGAT cycle and the GDH pathway was constructed based on the results obtained.
  The bold arrows, thin arrows, and dotted arrows indicate the enhanced, not changed,
  and weakened fluxes in each reaction. (A), the reaction scheme during the early
  log phase when Synechocystis was grown in Na15NO3 medium; (B), the reaction scheme
  during late log phase when Synechocystis was grown in Na15NO3 medium; (C), the reaction
  scheme when Synechocystis was grown in 15NH4Cl medium. The enlarged characters and
  molecular structure represent larger pool sizes of the molecule.
