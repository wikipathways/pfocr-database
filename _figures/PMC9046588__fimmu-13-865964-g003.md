caption: 'The TLR pathway is regulated by arginine methylation. After activation by
  TLR ligands, TRAF6 is methylated by PRMT1 and becomes inactive, resulting in lower
  downstream NF-κB activity. This is reversed by JMJD6 which demethylates TRAF6. Abbreviations:
  TLR, Toll-like receptors; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor
  6; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B; JMJD6, Jumonji Domain Containing 6.'
