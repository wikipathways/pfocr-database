caption: A. RTK and cell cycle-regulatory signaling networks frequently altered in
  pancreatic cancer. Oncogenes exhibiting gain-of-function mutations are indicated
  by a dark dashed line. Tumor suppressor genes altered in the disease are indicated
  by a lighter dashed line. The frequencies at which these genes are altered are also
  included. Oncogenic KRAS mutation cooperates with the loss of various tumor suppressor
  genes to promote cellular proliferation, growth, survival, and stem cell renewal.
  B. Hippo signaling is frequently deregulated in pancreatic cancer. The ability of
  the pathway to restrict cell growth and induce apoptosis is mediated by a number
  of stimuli including cell density, glucose levels, serum levels, and cytoskeletal
  tension.
