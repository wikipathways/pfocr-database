caption: Scheme of the metabolic activation of 4-ABP leading to DNA adduct formation
  in bladder. 4-ABP is first oxidized to the HONH-4-ABP by cytochrome P450 (P450)
  in liver. HONH-4-ABP may undergo circulation and reach the bladder to form DNA adducts.
  As a conjugation pathway, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) catalyze the glucuronidation
  of HONH-4-ABP to form N-Gluc-HONH-4-ABP, which undergoes circulation through the
  blood and collected in the bladder. HO-N-Gluc-4-ABP can undergo hydrolysis in urine
  at acidic pH and forms a nitrenium-carbenium ion intermediate that can damage DNA
  in the bladder epithelial cells. A small portion of unmetabolized 4-ABP can also
  reach bladder through circulation in the blood and undergo oxidation by P450 expressed
  in the bladder epithelium to form HONH-4-ABP which reacts with DNA.
