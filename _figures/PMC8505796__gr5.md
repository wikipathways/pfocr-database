caption: 'Interactions of ALDH1A1 with other molecules.Interaction with Notch. In
  the non-small lung cancer model, ALDH is regulated through the Notch pathway . In
  breast cancer xenograft models, ALDH1A1 is controlled at a post-translational level
  by the Notch signalling pathway. Notch induces ALDH1A1 Lys-353 deacetylation and
  activation via SIRT2 induction and supporting ALDH1A1 to promote tumorigenesis and
  tumour growth . Notch stimulation with sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) expands the
  breast cancer cells ALDH1+ subpopulation with CSC properties. Overexpression of
  sphingosine kinase 1 induces an increase in the levels of S1P and an expansion of
  the CSC subpopulation . ALDH1A1 is involved in lung CSC activity via suppression
  of the Notch/Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)/CyclinE1 pathway. Upregulation of
  ALDH1A1 in lung cancer A549 cells significantly decreased NOTCH1, NOTCH2 and NOTCH3,
  CDK2, and CyclinE1 .Interaction with NRF2. The levels of ALDH1A1, NRF2, and NQO1
  (both controlling redox balance) are higher in ALDH+ HCT116 colorectal cells and
  doxorubicin-resistant ovarian cancer cells compared to ALDH-. The increase in ALDH1A1
  and p62 was associated with NRF2 upregulation, indicating NRF2 signalling activation
  in ALDH+ cells .Interaction with Polycomb genes Bmi-1 and NSPc1. Silencing of Bmi-1
  expression in HNSCC- ALDH1+ cells resulted in the downregulation of Snail and ALDH1
  expression. Bmi-1 modulates the tumorigenic traits of ALDH1+ cells by regulating
  Snail, but the mechanism is unknown  (dotted arrow). Polycomb 1 of the nervous system
  (NSPc1) in glioma CSCs causes the reduction of endogenous RA by inhibition of retinol
  dehydrogenase 16 (RD16). Suppression of NSPc1 expression reduced self-renewal and
  sphere-forming abilities in glioma CSCs and expression of Nestin and CD133 .Interactions
  with MDR. RARα regulates MDR activity in human leukemic cells . Retinol, retinyl
  acetate, and 13-cis-RA (but not atRA) reduce the activity of MDR1 by non-competitive
  inhibition and raising the membrane viscosity . In the ovarian cancer model, the
  silencing of ALDH1A1 reduced the level of its downstream target NEK2. The downregulation
  of ABC transporters was detected due to ALDH1A1 or NEK2 silencing. They assume that
  ALDH1A1 can be involved in cisplatin resistance through the upregulation of NEK2
  in ovarian cancer .Interaction with HOX. There is reciprocal feedback between HOXA5
  and Wnt signalling . The Wnt pathway suppresses HOXA5 but activates ALDH1A1 transcription
  leading to c-MYC expression. C-MYC reacts with the Miz1 protein as a transcriptional
  repressor and prevents the transcription of HOXA5, thereby maintaining the properties
  of stem cells .Abbreviations: atRA – all-trans retinoic acid, Bmi-1 - CDK2 – cyclin-dependent
