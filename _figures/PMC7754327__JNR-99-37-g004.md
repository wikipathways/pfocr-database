caption: Schematic illustration of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme
  activity. MTHFR acts in the folate metabolic pathway. Dietary folate is converted
  into tetrahydrofolate (THF) that in turn is converted into 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate
  (5,10‐MTHF). MTHFR irreversibly converts 5,10‐MTHF into 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate
  (5‐MTHF), which is a crucial methyl donor to convert homocysteine (Hcy) into methionine
  (MET) and reform THF
