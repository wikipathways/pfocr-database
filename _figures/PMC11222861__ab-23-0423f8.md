caption: A brief proposal model of altered epigenetic regulation mechanisms of histone
  H3K27 acetylation causing FLHS and a summarized workflow of comparative analysis
  of fatty liver disease among different species. HFD affected histone modification
  of H3K27ac and resulted in dysregulation of genes evolving in lipid metabolism (PCK1,
  APOA4, APOA1) and apoptosis (KIT, NTRK2) together with PPAR signaling pathway and
  MAPK signaling pathway, which may induce the progression of FLHS. Meanwhile comparative
  analysis of human and rat with fatty liver together with FLHS chicken revealed four
  conservative hub genes (PCK1, INHBE, MAMDC2, ANXA13), especially for PCK1, which
  may play a vital role in fatty liver disease. FLHS, fatty liver hemorrhage syndrome;
  HFD, high-fat diet
