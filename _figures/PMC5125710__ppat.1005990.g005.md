caption: Models that depict the inhibition of mature virus formation by HIV-1 maturation
  inhibitors. Immature virus B is in equilibrium for binding to MI to produce MI-bound
  immature form A. In model 1, HIV protease can only cleave immature virus (form B)
  in the absence of MIs. The innate cleavage rate constant (k 1) is a function of
  Gag polymorphs. In model 2, HIV-1 protease may cleave CA/SP1 in either form A (bound)
  or form B (unbound) to produce mature virus C, thus the former pathway provides
  an escape mechanism for the formation of mature virus in the presence of MIs with
  rate constant k 2. This second cleavage rate constant (k 2) is a function of both
  MIs and Gag polymorph, and is derived from inclusion of MPI values from multiple
  (model 2a) or single (model 2b) cycle antiviral assays ().
