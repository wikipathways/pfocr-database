caption: 'Schematic representation of metabolic or disease regulation by LEAP-2 antagonism
  of GHSR1a in human organs. Mechanism of antagonism between ghrelin and LEAP-2: ghrelin
  inhibits the expression of SREBP1 through AMPK phosphorylation, thus decreasing
  LEAP-2 expression. In the hypothalamus, LEAP-2 inhibits the cAMP-PKA pathway on
  NPY/AgRP neurons and phosphorylates AMPK and ACC on NPY neurons, respectively, which
  reduces food intake and suppresses appetite, resulting in decreased GH secretion.
  In the heart, LEAP-2 upregulates the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well
  as M1 macrophage markers by promoting M1 macrophage polarization, while inhibiting
  M2 macrophage polarization and downregulating its markers, and knockdown of LEAP-2
  contributes to the treatment of obesity-induced myocardial injury. In the liver,
  hepatic fibrosis due to bariatric surgery is upregulated by LEAP-2 through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway, ultimately leading to the expression of pro-fibrotic factors.
  In pancreatic islets, LEAP-2 enhances GSIS by upregulating insulin-secretion-related
  genes through the GHSR1a-PPARγ signaling pathway. Simultaneously, LEAP-2 reverses
  the insulin inhibitory effect caused by ghrelin via GHSR1a and Mrap2 receptors.
