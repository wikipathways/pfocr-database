caption: The process of LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). LAP is the degradation
  of phagocytosed cellular corpses (e.g., apoptotic, necrotic, and necroptotic cells)
  and pathogens in phagosomes that utilize autophagic machinery. This process is dependent
  on some members of the classical autophagy pathway, including Beclin1, PI3KC3, ATG5,
  and ATG7, but not unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1). PtdSer is an eat-me signal exhibited
  by dying cells, and the receptors, including TLR, TIM4, and FcγR in phagocytes (e.g.,
  macrophages and neutrophils) are required for recognizing PtdSer and recruiting
  LC3 to the phagosome to form a single-membrane structure. NADPH oxidase (e.g., NOX2)
  is one of the major sources of ROS that regulates LAP. PI3KC3, class III phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; RIPK3, receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3; NOX2, NADPH oxidase
  2.
