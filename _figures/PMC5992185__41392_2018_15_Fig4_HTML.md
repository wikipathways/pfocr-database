caption: 'Molecular structure, posttranslational modifications, and protein–protein
  interactions of the Ski and SnoN proteins. a, b The domains that define the Ski
  and SnoN proteins include: Dachshund homology domain (DHD), SAND-like domain, and
  coiled-coil domain (CC). Both the Ski and SnoN proteins are regulated by PTMs, as
  catalyzed by several enzymes at specific residues that are indicated. Known regions
  of interaction with some partners for Ski and SnoN are indicated. c Several proteins
  are also partners for Ski and/or SnoN but the interacting domains are not identified.
  Kinases are shown in green, transcriptional coregulators in blue, transcription
  factors in red, and other proteins in black'
papertitle: Transcriptional cofactors Ski and SnoN are major regulators of the TGF-β/Smad
  signaling pathway in health and disease.
