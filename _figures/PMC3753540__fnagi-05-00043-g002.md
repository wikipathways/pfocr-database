caption: Potential mechanisms for reduced neurogenesis with aging. This figure depicts
  reported age-associated deficits or suppressive factors interfering with neurogenesis.
  It is unclear which is most prominent and is likely a combination of multiple factors.
  NSC, Neural stem cells; NPC, neural progenitor cells; X indicates a reduction in
  the indicated pathway.
