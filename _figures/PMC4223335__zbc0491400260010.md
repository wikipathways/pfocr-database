caption: Model of concerted regulation of NFATc3 by electrical activity and NGF in
  sensory neurons. Electrical stimulation (depolarization in this study) induces Ca2+
  influx into the cell via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which leads to CaN-dependent
  dephosphorylation of NFATc3 and initiation of its import into the nucleus. NGF facilitates
  NFATc3 activation and retention in the nucleus by stimulating the PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway, which leads to phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of GSK3β and thereby
  to the slowing of NFATc3 export from the nucleus.
