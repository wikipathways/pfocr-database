caption: Schematic representation of an epigenetic mechanism of action postulated
  to mediate cancer progression by artificial light at night (ALAN)-induced melatonin
  suppression. Photoperiod (day and night cycle) and ALAN signals are detected by
  intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and then propagated
  to circadian clock in the hypothalamic superchiasmatic nucleus (SCN) by the retinohypothalamic
  tract (RTH). The circadian signals from the SCN are conveyed to the pineal gland
  (PG) via the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). The SCN-PG pathway regulates normal
  rhythms of melatonin (solid gray arrows) that are associated with normal activity
  of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), normal global methylation, and finally normal
  cellular development (cancer free). Conversely, ALAN exposures (solid white arrow
  and dotted gray arrows) particularly of short wavelengths are associated with converse
  actions and finally trigger cancer progression and promote metastasis formation.
  Exogenous melatonin treatment may rectify the ALAN maladaptive responses.
