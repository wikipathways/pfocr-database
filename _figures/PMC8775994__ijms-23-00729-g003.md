caption: Molecular photoentrainment of the SCN. The light-induced release of glutamate
  and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) from the RHT nerve
  terminals leads to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP levels in the SCN. These
  trigger a cascade of events including activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which
  activates the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB),
  together with co-activators such as CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1).
  This leads to the upregulation of CRE-driven genes, including the core clock component,
  Per1 (1). In addition, Sik1 is upregulated, which feedbacks on the CREB pathway
  by phosphorylation of CRTC1. This deactivates CRTC1 leading to a decline in CREB-induced
  gene transcription and therefore a decline in Per1 expression (2). In parallel,
  the activation of ERK1/2 by Ca2+ influx leads to the upregulation of the immediate-early
  transcription factors JUN and FOS. These heterodimerise to form AP-1, which drives
  Per2 transcription leading to an increase in Per2 expression (3). Adenosine, which
  accumulates in the extracellular space during wakefulness, modulates these light-activated
  signalling pathways. Adenosine predominantly signals through the Gi (inhibitory)
  coupled A1 receptor in the SCN, which results in a decrease in intracellular cAMP
  and Ca2+ levels, and therefore a downregulation of the subsequent signalling events
  (4). Figure created with BioRender.com.
