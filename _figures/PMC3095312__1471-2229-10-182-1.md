caption: Monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) biosynthetic pathway showing the common
  entry to the pathway through the biosynthesis of strictosidine and its subsequent
  deglucosylation leading to species-specific end-products identified in Catharanthus
  roseus and Rauvolfia serpentina. The biosynthetic pathways of MIA precursors and
  the first MIA biosynthetic steps are common to all MIA-producing species (dark grey
  background). The species-specific MIA chemical diversity is exemplified in C. roseus
  and R. serpentina (light greys background) where major advances in molecular biology
  of MIA biosynthesis have been performed. Chemical structures are coloured in red
  (indolic moieties), in black (monoterpenoid moieties) and in blue (glucose). Cr,
  C. roseus (yellow); Rs, R. serpentina (green); STR, strictosidine synthase; SGD,
  strictosidine β-D-glucosidase; RGD, raucaffricine β-D-glucosidase.
