caption: Hypothetical conclusive mechanism of neurodegenerative disorder associated
  with ANT1. The pathway was summarized according to the pathway shown in KEGG website
  (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/highlight_pathway?scale=1.0&map=hsa05012&keyword=MPTP).
  Comp, complex; VMAT, vesicular monoamine transporter; DAT, dopamine transporter;
  TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; mPTP is composed of ANT1, cytosolic benzodiazepine receptor,
  Bax, and CypD. Red arrows displayed the detected changes occurred in impaired neuronal
  cells in this study. “ + ” indicated the promoted processes, “−” indicated the inhibited
  processes
