caption: Fig 1A is the biologically plausible representation of a signalling network.
  An SGA event in one of the gene products can disrupt the normal signal cascade.
  Given the difficulty in estimating the order of signal transduction, we replaced
  the realistic representation by connecting all the possible SGA events of genes
  to an OR gate indicating the pathway abnormality status (PAS). After parameter estimation
  and causal relation extraction, edges with larger weights remain, resulting in Fig
  1B. Gene-level SGAs connecting to the same PAS produce the functional module. PAS
  is then connected to transcriptomics with the same logical OR relationships. Instead
  of signal transduction or transcription regulation, ORN edges are more abstract,
  representing noisy logical induction.
