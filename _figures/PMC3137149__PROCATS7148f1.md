caption: Simplified model of the tuberous sclerosis complex signaling pathway. Tuberin
  and hamartin physically interact and function as a heterodimeric complex to inhibit
  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (TORC1), which includes mTOR,
  Raptor, mLST8, PRAS40, and DEPTOR. TORC1 integrates mitogenic signals and nutrient
  availability with protein synthesis via substrates including p70 S6 kinase (S6K).
  Tuberin inhibits TORC1 via the Ras homologue Rheb, which is a key target of tuberin's
  highly conserved guanosine triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) domain. Tuberin
  stimulates the conversion of Rheb–guanosine triphosphate (active) to Rheb–guanosine
  diphosphate (inactive), thereby inhibiting TORC1.
