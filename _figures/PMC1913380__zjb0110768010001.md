caption: (A) Schematic representation of the nar locus in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
  The narXL and narK1K2GHJI operons share a divergently oriented promoter region covering
  173 bp. The 5′ end of the narXL mRNA was localized at 45 bp upstream of the translational
  start of narX. The narK1K2GHJI genes are transcribed as an operon starting at 29
  bp upstream of the narK1 translational start. (B) The currently elucidated regulatory
  network for the onset of denitrification in P. aeruginosa. The major initial signal
  to turn on the denitrification pathway in P. aeruginosa is low-oxygen tension. This
  signal is measured by the Fe-S clusters attached to Anr (). Anr increases the transcription
  of the narXL operon encoding a two-component regulatory system responding to the
  presence of nitrate. Anr and NarL cooperatively activate the dnr gene for the third
  involved regulatory system, Dnr, responding to NO (). The fourth regulatory system,
  NirQ, in turn requires Dnr and NarL for its formation (). Under low-oxygen tension
  conditions and in the presence of nitrate, Anr and NarL activate in concert with
  the DNA bending protein IHF, the narK1K2GHJI operon encoding nitrate/nitrite transporters,
  and the structural genes for the respiratory nitrate reductase. The enzyme converts
  nitrate into nitrite. Now, both Dnr and NirQ, most likely responding to N-oxides,
  are essential for the gene regulatory scenario required for the formation of the
  three enzyme complexes that catalyze the conversion of nitrite into N2.
