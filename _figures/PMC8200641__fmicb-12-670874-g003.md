caption: The PERK-eIF2α pathway is involved in forms transformation of parasites.
  (A) PK4-eIF2α was associated with the formation of gametophytes, conversion of Plasmodium
  gametophytes into ookinetes, invasion of new red blood cells by merozoite-containing
  schizonts and the infection of Anopheles mosquitoes by gametocytes; (B) PERK- eIF2α
  phosphorylation was vital for the switch from promastigote to amastigote in Leishmania;
  (C) Tc-eIF2α phosphorylation was required for the differentiation of non-infective
  epimastigotes into infective metacyclic trypomastigotes of T. cruzi; (D) TgIF2K-A/TgIF2α
  phosphorylation was related to bradyzoite cyst differentiation in T. gondii.
