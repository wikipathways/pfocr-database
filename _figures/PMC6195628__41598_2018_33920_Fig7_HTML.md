caption: SFK regulation of the Notch signaling pathway. Proposed mechanism of the
  regulation of Notch signaling by Src family kinases (SFKs). Integrin-induced SFK
  activity serves to phosphorylate the Notch intracellular domain. This phosphorylation
  leads to decreased recruitment of MAML to the Notch transcriptional complex and
  subsequent reduction in target gene transcription. Phosphorylation of the Notch
  intracellular domain may lead to reduced half-life of the protein.
