caption: Mechanisms through which the gut microbiome contributes to oncogenesis. Fn
  expresses various virulent factors that activate prooncogenic pathways. FadA adhesin
  expressed by Fn binds to E-cadherin, leading to activation of Annexin 1 and activation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Activation of TLR4 by LPS activates NF-κB
  to upregulate the production of miRNA-21, which promotes oncogenesis by inducing
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and inhibiting RASA1, a GTPase activating protein that
  normally inhibits the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway. Activation of TLR4 by LPS also upregulates
  the CYP2J2/12,13-EpOME pathway, promoting tumor migration, invasion, EMT, and metastasis.
  Microorganisms also secrete different metabolites which activate the AhR pathway,
  which contributes to oncogenesis through various mechanisms, one of which is through
  crosstalk with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Created with BioRender.com
