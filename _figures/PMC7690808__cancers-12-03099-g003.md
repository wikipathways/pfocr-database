caption: TGF-β targeting factors that “lock” NK cell functions. TGF-β impairs the
  balance between activating signals and inhibitory signals on NK cells to block the
  activation of NK cells. Their anti-tumour activity is reduced by downregulating
  the mTOR pathway and upregulating the Smad3/E4BP4 pathway. The conversion of NK
  cell to innate lymphoid cell under the high levels of TGF-β leads to the loss of
  the metastasis-restraining function of NK cells through the expression of CD69,
  CD49a, and TRAIL, and the loss of EOMES.
