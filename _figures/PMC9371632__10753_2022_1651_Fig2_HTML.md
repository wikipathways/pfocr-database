caption: Schematic representation of elements involved in generating innate immune
  response against SARS-CoV-2. SARS‐CoV2 infects permissible cells via angiotensin‐converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2). After entering the alveolar epithelium, the virus is recognized
  by important innate immune sensors including endosomal RNA sensors—Toll-like receptor
  3 (TLR3), TLR7/8 and cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and melanoma
  differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). TLRs are known to further activate
  TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing IFNβ (TRIF) and myeloid differentiation primary
  response gene 88 (MyD88) signaling pathways. MyD88-dependent pathway proceeds via
  formation of “Mydossome” with TRAF6 activating TAK1 kinase via polyubiquitination.
  The activated TAK1 activates IKK kinase complex by phosphorylation. The activation
  of IKK complex leads to the activation of induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB.
  The TRIF-dependent pathway, on the other hand, recruits TRAF3 and TRAF6. TRAF3 activates
  IKK complex by polyubiquitination which in turn activates IKKε/TBK1 by phosphorylation
  and causes activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 and IRF7. In addition, virus-induced
  mitochondria damage activates cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon
  gene (STING) pathway to induce synthesis of antiviral IFN-α/β production via IRF3
  and IRF7. Transcription factor NF-κB initiates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (TNF-α and IL-6), and the transcription factor IRF3/7 initiates production of type
  I interferon (IFN-α/β). Interferons are secreted and bind to the type I interferon
  receptor (IFNAR) in an autocrine loop to activate JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway,
  where STAT1-STAT2 is phosphorylated and forms heterodimer that joins IRF9 to form
  ISGF-3. ISGF-3 complex then binds to ISREs on the regulatory region on target genes
  to induce expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISG genes expression
  establishes an antiviral state in the cells.
