caption: Anaerobic metabolic pathways of glucose and xylose in B. coagulans strain
  P4-102B. Thickness of the arrow indicates glucose or xylose flux to L-lactate (broken
  line) as the preferred route during anaerobic growth of wild type and to D-lactate
  in strain QZ19 constructed in this study. Broken arrows (L-LDH and ALS) represent
  mutations in the two pathways introduced in this study. Xylose fermentation pathway
  in lactic acid bacteria, such as L. lactis utilizing phosphoketolase pathway resulting
  in an equimolar lactate and acetate is also presented for comparison. See Patel,
  et al. for details on pentose fermentation by B. coagulans and L. lactis ().
