caption: Under normal cell growth conditions, the pre‐ribosomal complex formed by
  RPL5, RPL11, and 5S rRNA is incorporated into nascent ribosomes (Left panel). When
  nucleotide levels become limiting for 47S rRNA synthesis, ribosome biogenesis is
  impaired, which converts the RPL5/RPL11/5S rRNA complex into the IRBC complex, which
  is able to bind and inhibit MDM2, releasing p53, leading to p21 induction and G1
  arrest (Middle panel). However, a more severe drop in nucleotide levels leads to
  the degradation of p21 by the proteasome, impairing IRBC‐dependent G1 arrest and
  allowing S phase entry despite reduced nucleotide pools. Cells are therefore exposed
  to replicative stress, sensed by the ATR‐Chk1 pathway responsible for p53 S15 phosphorylation.
  Chronic replicative stress leads to DNA damage and eventually genomic instability,
  key events in tumor progression (Right panel).
