caption: Regulation of kinase levels by other kinases and Cdc37. (A) Schematic of
  the pheromone-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is shown at the
  left. Levels of Fus3 in wild-type (WT) cells (lane 1), ste11Δ cells (lane 2), and
  ste11Δ/cdc37S14A cells (lane 3) are shown at the right. (B) Schematic at left shows
  the PKC signaling pathway. Levels of the Slt2 mitogen-activated protein kinase in
  wild-type cells (lane 1), bck1Δ cells (lane 2), and bck1Δ/cdc37S14A cells (lane
  3) are shown at the right. (A and B) Pgk1 levels are shown as a loading control.
  Vertical lines denote nonconsecutive lanes from the same gel and Western blots.
papertitle: Cdc37 has distinct roles in protein kinase quality control that protect
  nascent chains from degradation and promote posttranslational maturation.
