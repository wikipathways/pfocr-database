  can be recruited to tumour microenvironment where they differentiate into TAMs with
  various phenotypes ranging from the M1 phenotype to the alternative M2 phenotype.
  This process including multiple classic factors including IL-4, IL 13, LPS and IFN-γ.
  M1 phenotype acts as a pro-inflammatory stimuli through secreting large amounts
  of inflammatory factors like INOS, IL-1β and TNF-α. While M2 phenotype releases
  TGF-β, IL-4, Arg-1 and IL-10 to regulate the degree of immune response and boost
  tumour formation. TAMs, tumour-associated macrophages.'
