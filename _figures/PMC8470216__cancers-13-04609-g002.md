caption: 'T cells remodel their metabolism to get differentiated into T-cell subsets
  within the TME. TN cells use glucose that enters in OXPHOS. Upon encountering cognate
  antigen, activated T cells get differentiated into TEFF, rapidly uptaking glucose
  and glutamine to perform aerobic glycolysis and generating lactate as a by-product.
  Once the antigen is cleared, TEFFs can get differentiated into memory T cells (TMEM),
  which depend on fatty acid oxidation. Equally, cancer cells depend on aerobic glycolysis
  and glutaminolysis that are fueled by glucose and glutamine, respectively, with
  production of lactate as a by-product. TEFF within the TME can be differentiated
  into Tregs with immunosuppressive properties that mainly produce energy by oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). T cells can become exhausted
  if they fail to clear antigens, as, for example, in cancer. T lymphocytes derived
  from tumors show elevated levels of PD-1 decreasing PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
  and therefore glycolysis. Exhausted T cells in tumors having often dysfunctional
  mitochondria rely on FAO. FA: fatty acids. Cancer cells and T cells compete for
  nutrients, since cancer cells also have an increased glucose and glutamine uptake
  and they use aerobic glycolysis with production of lactate that is exported to the
  extracellular space, promoting acidification in the TME that compromises the activity
  of immune cells.'
