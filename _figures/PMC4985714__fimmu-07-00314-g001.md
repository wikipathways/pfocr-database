caption: The purine salvage pathway is an integral metabolic pathway, responsible
  for the regulation and availability of purines. ADA catalyzes the deamination of
  adenosine and deoxyadenosine, forming inosine and deoxyinosine (respectively), which
  can then undergo further downstream processing. Alternatively, adenosine and deoxyadenosine
  may be released to activate downstream pathways.
