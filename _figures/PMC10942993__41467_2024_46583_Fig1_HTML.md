caption: GGPP geranylgeranyl diphosphate, TS taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene synthase, T5OH
  taxoid 5α-hydroxylase, TCPR Taxus cytochrome P450 reductase, T5AT and TAX19 taxoid
  5-O-acetyltransferase, T13OH taxoid 13α-hydroxylase, T10OH taxoid 10β-hydroxylase,
  T9OH taxoid 9α-hydroxylase, T2OH taxoid 2α-hydroxylase, T7OH taxoid 7β-hydroxylase,
  T1OH taxoid 1β-hydroxylase, TBT taxoid 2α-O-benzoyltransferase, DBAT 10-deacetylbaccatin
  10β-O-acetyltransferase, BAPT 13-O-(3-amino-3-phenylpropanoyl) transferase, T2′OH
  taxoid 2′-hydroxylase, DBTNBT N-debenzoyl-2′-deoxytaxol N-benzoyltransferase, PAM
  phenylalanine aminomutase. Dashed lines represent the proposed steps and unknown
  enzymes were marked in red. New formed groups in compounds were marked with red.
  Tri-oxygenated taxoids were speculated as the hypothetical intermediates and hydroxylation
  modification at C9 catalyzed by T9OH was proposed as the fourth oxidation reaction
  step in the biosynthetic pathway of Taxol
