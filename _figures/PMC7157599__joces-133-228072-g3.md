caption: Molecular mechanisms used by members of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases to
  regulate Wnt, TGF-β and Notch signaling pathways. HUWE1, NEDD4L, ITCH, SMURF1, SMURF2
  and HECTD1 downregulate Wnt signaling pathway either through mediating the ubiquitylation
  of Dvl or of Axin proteins. Conversely, UBR5 activates Wnt signaling by regulating
  the ubiquitylation of β-catenin, which results in enhanced β-catenin stability,
  as well as that of Groucho/TLE proteins, which inactivates this transcription repressor.
  SMURF1, SMURF2, WWP1 and NEDD4L E3 ubiquitin ligases suppress TGF-β signaling through
  promoting the ubiquitylation of Smad family members including Smad2, Smad3 and Smad7.
  In contrast, UBR5 upregulates TGF-β signaling by ubiquitylating Smad2 and Smad7.
  ITCH, NEDD4 and WWP2 inhibit Notch signaling by ubiquitylating Deltex (also known
  as DTX1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that positively regulates Notch signaling, and
  targeting Deltex and Notch for proteosomal degradation. NEDD4, ITCH, WWP2 and UBR5
  also inhibit the Notch signaling pathway by targeting Notch-like receptors GLP-1
  and LIN-12 in C. elegans for degradation or inactivation.
