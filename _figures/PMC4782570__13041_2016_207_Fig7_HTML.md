caption: The proposed regulatory mechanism of insulin expression by the Wnt/β-catenin/NeuroD1
  pathway in the hypothalamus. Wnt3a might bind to LRP and Frizzed receptor to activate
  the canonical Wnt pathway. GSK3 phosphorylates β-catenin and induces its degradation;
  Wnt3a inhibits GSK3, leading to β-catenin accumulation. Accumulated β-catenin translocates
  into the nucleus and enhances the expression of NeuroD1 with TCF. Up-regulated NeuroD1
  also translocates into the nucleus, where it induces the production of insulin
papertitle: Wnt3a upregulates brain-derived insulin by increasing NeuroD1 via Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling in the hypothalamus.
