caption: 'Figure 1. Model for the interaction of NMD and ERQC. (A) Under normal conditions,
  mature mRNAs are inspected at the pioneer-round of translation (i). Upon recognition
  of a PTC by the ribosome, the PTC-containing mRNA is captured by the NMD protein
  complex, cleaved by SMG6 and degraded by the exosome and XRN1 (ii)-(iv). Proteins
  translocated into the ER are modified and folded by ER protein chaperones (v). Properly
  folded proteins exit the ER en route to the Golgi, whereas misfolded proteins are
  degraded by ERAD or autophagy (vi). (B) Defects in NMD stabilize PTC-containing
  mRNAs that: (1) encode misfolded proteins to provoke ER stress (vii); or (2) disrupt
  ER function by altering gene expression or generating proteins that act in a dominant-negative
  manner (viii). The UPR is activated to maintain ER homeostasis (ix). (C) Under conditions
  of ER stress, the generation of PTC-containing mRNAs is increased, possibly due
  to oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage (x). In response to ER stress, the exosome
  subunits (DIS3 and EXOSC3) are induced by an eIF2α phosphorylation-dependent pathway
  and SMG6 is induced by an unidentified pathway (xi). Induction of these genes promotes
  cleavage and decay of PTC-containing mRNAs captured by NMD machinery (xii).'
