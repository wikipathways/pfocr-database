caption: TLRs play critical roles in gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders at the
  mucosa. Major TLR signaling pathways (A). TLR signaling mediates major biological
  functions at the mucosal epithelium (B). PAMPs from pathogens bind TLRs and activate
  MYD88-dependent pathways, stimulate proinflammatory secretions, and recruit immune
  cells to the site of infection, where immune cells remove cellular debris and restrict
  new invasion. Through TLRs, bacteria control epithelial cell gene expression, and
  epithelial cell products shape the composition of the microbiota. TLRs recognize
  DAMPs, which are signal molecules released during cell injury and by cancer cells.
  DAMPs activate TLRs and the p53/TRIF–dependent notch signaling pathway, promoting
  the epithelial cell proliferation involved in regeneration after mucosal injury.
  TLR activation by PAMPs or DAMPs can activate COX-2, PGE2, EGFR, Wnt, and β-catenin
  signaling, promote epithelial cell proliferation, but the growth mediated by these
  pathways can also lead to tumorigenesis. CD, cluster of differentiation; COX-2,

  description: TLRs play critical roles in gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders
    at the mucosa. Major TLR signaling pathways (A). TLR signaling mediates major
    biological functions at the mucosal epithelium (B). PAMPs from pathogens bind
