caption: The mechanism of canonical and non-canonical pyroptosis pathway. In the canonical
  pyroptosis pathway, intracellular pattern recognition receptors (e.g., NLRP1B, NLRP3,
  NLRC4, etc.) recognize the stimulus signals of pathogens and bind to pro-caspase-1
  through the adaptor protein ASC to form a multi-protein complex that can activate
  caspase-1 protein. In the non-canonical pyroptosis pathway, intracellular LPS directly
  binds and activates caspase-11/4/5 protein to initiate pyroptosis. After inflammatory
  caspase activation, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 are cleaved to active IL-1β and IL-18.
  The portion of GSDMD that connects the N- and C-terminals is rapidly cleaved to
  remove the inhibitory effect of the C-terminal on the N-terminal. Then, the N-terminal
  of GSDMD connects with phosphatidylinositol(PI) on the cell membrane, resulting
  in an oligomerization effect and formation of the “gasdermin channel”. Ion movement
  through this channel destroys the osmotic balance, leading to cell swelling, membrane
  dissolution, cell content release, and inflammatory response. Furthermore, cytosolic
  LPS stimulation induced caspase-11-dependent cleavage of the pannexin-1 channel
  followed by ATP release, which in turn activated the P2X7 receptor to cause ATP-induced
  loss of intracellular K+, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1b secretion.
