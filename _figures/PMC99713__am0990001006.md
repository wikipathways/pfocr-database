caption: Metabolic pathways for formation of AFG1 from OMST and formation of AFG2
  from DHOMST. At least three enzyme reactions may be commonly present in both pathways.
  Reaction 1 may be catalyzed by an ordA gene product, which is microsome cytochrome
  P-450 oxygenase. A transient intermediate formed during this pathway may be subsequently
  converted to another substance in reaction 2 and finally converted to the final
  product, AFG1 or AFG2, in reaction 3. Reactions 2 and 3 may be catalyzed by an unstable
  microsome enzyme and a 220-kDa cytosol protein. However, the order of the three
  enzyme activities was not determined in this study.
