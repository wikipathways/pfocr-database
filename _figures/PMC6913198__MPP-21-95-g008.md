caption: Schematic model for the role of AtRTP5 in plant immunity. Silencing of AtRTP5
  promoted plant immunity by repressing the JA signalling pathway and activating SA
  biosynthesis and SA‐dependent responses. AtRTP5 suppressed the expression of SA
  biosynthesis‐related genes ICS1 and CBP60g, and the endogenous SA content was decreased
  in overexpression plants. The decreased SA suppressed PR1 expression and negatively
  affected plant resistance to Phytophthora pathogens. AtRTP5 accelerated the expression
  of JA biosynthesis‐related genes AOS and Lox2, and the endogenous JA content was
  increased in overexpression plants. The increased JA accelerated the expression
  of MYC2, JAZ1 and PDF1.2.
