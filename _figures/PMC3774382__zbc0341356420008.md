caption: Model for lactate-dependent activation of PI3K/Akt and promotion of angiogenesis.
  Lactate enters endothelial cells through the MCT1 transporter, and it elevates the
  level of Gas6, Ang1, and probably VEGF. These ligands activate receptor tyrosine
  kinases Axl, Tie2, and VEGFR-2, which trigger the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is essential
  for angiogenesis. These ligands can be produced by other cell types, which may also
  contribute to the response.
