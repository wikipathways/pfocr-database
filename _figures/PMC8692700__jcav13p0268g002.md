caption: The indispensable role of PES1 in different signaling pathways. (1) PES1
  bridges β-Catenin and TCF4 to activate the β-Catenin/TCF signaling pathway. (2)
  Loss of PES1 increases the level of stabilized β-Catenin in the cytoplasm and the
  level of protein AXIN2. (3) The JNK signaling pathway directly binds to the PES1
  promoter by c-Jun to promote the expression of PES1. (4) PES1 promotes the expression
  of cyclin D1 by upregulating the phosphorylation levels of PTEN, PI3K, AKT and GSK3β,
  and also promotes the expression of cyclin D1 by upregulating ERα. (5) PES1 promotes
  the expression of VEGF by upregulating HIF-1α, thereby promoting angiogenesis. (6)
  The bromodomain of BRD4 binds to the conserved lysine sequence in PES1 and acetylates
  the conserved lysine sequence, which promotes the expression of c-Myc.
