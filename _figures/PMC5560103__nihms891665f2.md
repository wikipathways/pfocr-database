caption: Bimodal regulation of Sestrin2A) Sestrin2 is a leucine sensor and inhibitor
  of mTORC1 signaling in response to stresses. Sestrin2, leucine, and GATOR2 exist
  in a equilibrium in the cell that dictates mTORC1 activity in response to both leucine
  levels and other stresses. Increasing leucine levels pushes the Sestrin2-leucine
  equilibrium forward such that more GATOR2 is free, leading to increased mTORC1 signaling.
  Increasing levels of Sestrin2, downstream of ATF4 in response to cellular stresses,
  pushes the Sestrin2-GATOR2 equilibrium forward, inhibiting mTORC1 signaling.B) Schematic
  depicting mTORC1 activity in response to increasing Sestrin2 levels, at constant
  levels of GATOR2 and leucine.C) Diagram showing how modulating leucine levels will
  impact mTORC1 activity at varying cellular levels of Sestrin2.
