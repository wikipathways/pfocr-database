caption: Effects of IL-17A on osteoblasts. ①IL−17A promotes MC3T3-E1 to differentiate
  into osteoblasts by activating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, whereas another
  study indicated that IL-17A inhibited osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1.
  ② IL-17A upregulates Runx2 and osterix expression to promote mice calvarial osteoblast
  to differentiate into mature osteoblast, whereas downregulates Runx2 and osterix
  expression to inhibit rat calvarial osteoblast to differentiate into mature osteoblast.
  ③ IL-17A promotes the secrete of IL‐6 and IL‐1β to activate the AKT, STAT3, and
  ERK1/2 pathways and promotes osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal
  stem cells (BM-MSCs), whereas IL-17A inhibits osteoblastic differentiation through
  inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway.④ IL-17A promotes human BM-MSCs (hBM-MSCs)
  to differentiate into osteoblasts by upregulating Runx2 expression. IL-17A with
  bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) or with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α synergistically
  enhance osteogenic differentiation. However, IL-17A inhibits osteoblastic differentiation
  of hBM-MSCs by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway. ⑤ IL-17A promotes bone-derived
  cells to differentiate into osteoblasts by activating the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathways.
