caption: Glucose-induced FFA partitioning in the β-cell. Inhibition of β-oxidation
  by glucose (Glc) redirect Lc-CoA to the GL/NEFA cycle. Condensation of glycerol-trisphosphate
  and Lc-CoA is mediated by the glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase (GPAT) to form
  lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA is further acetylated into phosphatidic by the
  1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT). The phosphohydrolase activity
  of lipins on PA produces 1,2-DAG that is then converted to TAG by the diacylglycerol
  O-acyltransferase (DGAT). TAG is sequentially hydrolyzed to 1/2,3-DAG, MAG, and
  finally glycerol by the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the hormone-sensitive
  lipase (HSL), and the MAG lipase (MAGL). MAG can also be hydrolyzed to glycerol
  by the α/β -hydrolase domain-containing 6 lipase (ABHD6—plasma membrane-bound enzyme).
  G3P can be directly converted to glycerol via the glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase
  (G3PP) as a mechanism of gluco-detoxification. The triggering pathway of insulin
  secretion is shown in blue. Activation of FFAR1 further enhances insulin secretion,
  as shown in green.
