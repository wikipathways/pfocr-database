caption: Biology of the von Hippel-Lindau/hypoxia-inducible factor (VHL-HIF) axis
  in the setting of hypoxia or a mutation or aberration of the VHL gene product. In
  normoxic conditions, HIFα is hydroxylated on specific proline residues by prolyl-hydroxylases.
  VHL acts as the sensor for these hydroxylated proline residues as part of the VHL-E3
  ubiquitin ligase. This polyubiquitinates HIFα and marks it for degradation by the
  proteasome. In hypoxic conditions (or in the presence of aberrant VHL), HIFα is
  allowed to accumulate in the cell. It associates with HIFβ and this complex translocates
  to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor binding to hypoxia response elements
  and upregulating oxygen-sensitive genes. These HIF-responsive genes include vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming
  growth factor alpha (TGFα), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), carbonic anhydrase IX
  (CA-IX), erythropoietin (EPO), and others. Examples of selected receptors are given,
  including VEGF receptor (VEGFR), PDGF receptor (PDGFR), and the receptor for TNFα
  and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Shown is the downstream signaling for
  one of these receptors, VEGFR, including through the PI3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR,
  p38 MAP kinase (p38MAPK), and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways. Examples of agents (including
  pazopanib) that impact on this cascade are given, and where they act on the pathway
  is shown.
