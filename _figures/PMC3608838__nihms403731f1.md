caption: (A) Formation and toxicity of α-syn oligomers. Protein aggregation in neurodegenerative
  diseases is initiated by aberrant protein folding which leads to the formation of
  oligomers and eventually amyloid fibrils and inclusions bodies (blue arrows). Certain
  oligomeric species are toxic to cells by mechanisms that include (1) impairment
  of proteostasis, (2) chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, (3) pore formation,
  (4) glutamate receptor dysfunction, (5) seeding with (6) prion-like transmission
  (red arrows), all of which may combine in the pathogenic process of cell death and
  transmission. Endogenous cellular systems which can reduce oligomer levels are the
  chaperone network, the ubiquitin-proteasomal system (UPS), and the autophagy-lysosomal
  pathway (ALP) (green arrows).(B) Potential treatment strategies which reduce toxic
  α-syn oligomers to slow or prevent neurodegeneration. These strategies target different
  steps along the protein aggregation pathway, as well as intracellular and/or extracellular
  pools of α-syn oligomers. The primary goal of treatment is to reduce toxic oligomer
  levels directly or indirectly by preventing oligomer formation, disrupting already
  formed oligomers, promoting degradation of toxic oligomers or conversion of toxic
  oligomers to non-toxic oligomers, and sequestering or clearing oligomers by antibody
  or cell-based mechanisms to prevent cell-to-cell transmission (black dotted lines).
