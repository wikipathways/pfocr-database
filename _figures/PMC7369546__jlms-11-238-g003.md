  regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation”, “amoebiasis”, “legionellosis”,
  “regulation of mononuclear cell migration”, “IL17 signaling pathway”, and “IL10
  signaling” were identified. The determined biological terms can be considered as
  a tool to screen the related genes. The action roles of the 7 central nodes are
  illustrated in . Except for CXCLs, activation is the prominent action between the
  other genes. Associated cellular components for the 7 central genes are shown in

  membrane, and intracellular components. TNF and IL6 are linked to all components
  while IL10 and CXCL2 are related to the extracellular component.'
