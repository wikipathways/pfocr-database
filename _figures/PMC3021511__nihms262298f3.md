caption: a) Amino terminal labelling techniques use chemical or enzymatic methods
  to selectively label neo-N termini that are created on protease treatment. The labelled
  N-terminal peptides can then be enriched through positive selection methods (such
  as the subtiligase method) or, alternatively, the internal unmodified peptides can
  be removed through negative selection methods (such as terminal amine isotopic labelling
  of substrates (TAILS) methods). The remaining pool of enriched labelled neo-N termini
  can then be analysed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and the exact sites of
  proteolytic cleavage can be assigned. b) An alternative proteomic method for protease
  substrate identification, Protein Topography and Migration Analysis Platform (PROTOMAP)
  combines one-dimensional (1D) SDS–PAGE fractionation with liquid chromatograpy (LC)–MS
  analysis. In a typical PROTOMAP experiment, proteomes from control (Ctrl; red) and
  experimental (protease-active) (Expt; blue) systems are separated by 1D SDS–PAGE.
  The lanes are cut into bands at fixed intervals, digested with trypsin and analysed
  by LC–MS/MS to generate data that are integrated into peptographs, which plot sequence
  coverage for a given protein in the horizontal dimension (N to C terminus; left
  to right) versus gel migration in the vertical dimension. Spectral count values
  for each protein in each gel band provide quantitation. Cleaved proteins are identified
  by shifts in migration from higher to lower molecular weight (MW) in Ctrl versus
  Expt systems.
