caption: Representative structure of triterpene compounds isolated from horticultural
  trees. Multi-omics approaches were utilized for the identification and functional
  characterization of triterpene biosynthesis genes, either leading to complete pathway
  elucidation or any specific enzymatic step of the pathway
