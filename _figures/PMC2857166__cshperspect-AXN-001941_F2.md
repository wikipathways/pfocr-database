caption: Regulation of receptor activation and signaling by proteolytic processing.
  (A) Following ligand-receptor complex formation, ADAM10 cleaves the ephrinA5 ligand.
  This regulated proteolytic event both leads to release from the initial cell–cell
  adhesion, allowing for growth cone retraction, and is necessary for the transduction
  of the EphA3 forward signal. (B) Processive cleavage of ephrinB leads to the release
  of the ephrinB intracellular domain (ICD), which may activate SRC-family kinases
  to contribute to reverse signaling. On the other hand, cleavage of the EphB2 receptor,
  in this case by matrix metalloproteases (not pictured), is required for receptor
  activation in vitro. (C) Regulated proteolysis of DCC occurs by ADAM10-mediated
  creation of a carboxy-terminal fragment (CTF), followed by γ-secretase mediated
  intramembrane cleavage releasing DCC ICD. This ICD is competent to translocate to
  the nucleus when fused with Gal4. The cleavage event by ADAM10 leads to attenuation
  of neuritogenesis in vitro. (D) Kuzbanian appears to act positively in the Slit-Robo
  signaling pathway. Based on genetic observations and the abnormal presence of Robo
  protein on the commissural portions of axons in kuz mutants, we speculate that Kuz
  may cleave Robo to regulate receptor activity.
