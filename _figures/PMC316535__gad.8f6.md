caption: Genetic models for ptp-2 signaling during (A) oogenesis and (B) vulval development.
  C. elegans genes are in italics, and their mammalian homologs are listed to the
  right. During oogenesis, PTP-2 likely functions to regulate positively signaling
  downstream from a yet uncharacterized PTK or R-PTK. PTP-2 may lead directly to the
  activation of the Ras, MEK, and MAPK cascade, or to the activation of an uncharacterized
  signaling pathway that is required for proper oogenesis. During vulval development,
  PTP-2 appears to be acting as a positive regulator of LET-23 signaling, functioning
  downstream of or in parallel to LET-60 Ras, and in a pathway that cooperates with
  SEM-5. All genes known to participate in the regulation of vulval induction are
  not shown, and this model does not intend to imply that ptp-2 does not interact
  with these genes, but rather that such putative relationships are yet to be defined.
