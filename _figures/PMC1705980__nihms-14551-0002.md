caption: Schematic model of autophagic regulation. Stimulation of the class I PtdIns
  3-kinase at the plasma membrane through the insulin receptor results in the generation
  of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (dark pink circles). These phosphoinositides
  allow binding and activation of Akt/PKB and its activator PDK-1. Along with amino
  acids, Akt/PKB activates mTor (additional components in this pathway are not depicted).
  Subsequent phosphorylation of a downstream effector, possibly analogous to Atg1
  or other ATG gene products as demonstrated in yeast, inhibits autophagy. PTEN dephosphorylates
  3′ phosphoinositides and antagonizes the action of class I PtdIns 3-kinase. A class
  III PtdIns 3-kinase complex, which includes Beclin 1/Atg6, generates PtdIns(3)P
  (purple circles) to control the membrane dynamics that are associated with autophagosome
  formation. Rapamycin inhibits mTor, while wortmannin and 3-methyladenine inhibit
  the class III PtdIns 3-kinase; the effect is to induce or inhibit autophagy, respectively.
  Autophagy is also regulated through heterotrimeric G proteins and other kinases
  and phosphatases that are not depicted.
