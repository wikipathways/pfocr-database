caption: Altered Ca2+signaling in T cells during aging—impact of ion channel expression
  and function. Calcium signaling in T cells, mediated by several types of channels,
  pumps, and receptors, is part of a crucial activation pathway, leading to proliferation,
  differentiation, and various effector functions. Antigen recognition through T cell
  receptors (TCRs) initiates the phosphorylation of multiple adaptor proteins. Activation
  of PLCγ1, followed by inositol triphosphate (IP3) production, induces Ca2+ release
  from ER calcium stores by binding to its receptor (IP3R). The decrease of [Ca2+]ER
  activates STIM, which translocates to the plasma membrane and causes store-operated
  calcium entry (SOCE) through direct interactions with Orai channels. The increased
  cytosolic Ca2+ concentration leads to the activation of calcineurin, dephosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation of NFAT resulting in expression of IL2, CD25, Foxp3, and
  further components essential for T cell function. Other ion channels including (non-selective)
  TRPC and TRPM2/7, CaV channels (e.g., CaV3.1), and purinergic ionotropic receptors
  (e.g., P2X7) mediate Ca2+ influx during T cell activation. Additionally, ion channels
  like potassium channels (e.g., KV1.3, KCa3.1) or TRPM4 indirectly regulate Ca2+
  influx through de- or hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane. Besides alterations
  in TCR activation, also Ca2+signaling changes during aging. STIM1 and STIM2 expression
  levels are reduced (↓). Orai channel expression is still under investigation but
  Orai2 mRNA expression is decreased (↓). In contrast, PMCA4 expression increases
  with age (↑) leading to higher Ca2+ extrusion. Inhibition of KV1.3 or KCa3.1 causes
  age- and subtype- dependent differences in Ca2+ influx patterns (↯). Possible changes
  in expression or function of other ion channels during aging are largely unknown
  (?).
