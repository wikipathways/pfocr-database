caption: Role of RGS proteins in selected GPCR signaling in bone. In osteoblasts,
  PTH1R activation upon binding of PTH or PTHrP triggers the activation of the Gαs–AC–cAMP
  signaling pathway which ultimately promotes osteoblast differentiation. Activation
  of PTH1R can induce the expression of many RGS proteins, including RGS2 and RGS5.
  RGS2 can target the cAMP signaling to regulate PTH1R signaling, and RGS5 is likely
  to regulate osteoblast differentiation by controlling PTH levels. In osteoclasts,
  activation of GPCRs, such as CasR and OGR1, can activate Gαq or Gαi/o to activate
  the PLC–Ca2+signaling pathway for NFATc1 activation or Gαs to activate the Ac–cAMP
  pathway to promote osteoblast differentiation and function. RGS10, RGS12, and RGS18
  can regulate osteoclast differentiation.
