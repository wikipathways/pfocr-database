caption: 'Plastidic intersection of the shikimate pathway, the methyl erythritol phosphate
  pathway, and lipogenesis. The shikimate pathway, methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP)
  pathway, and fatty acid synthesis are localized in plastids, and share phosphoenolpyruvate
  and pyruvate as common biosynthetic precursors. The biosynthesis of triacylglycerols
  occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Arabidopsis Genome Initiative numbers in red
  indicate that the corresponding gene is downregulated in Arabidopsis wri1 developing
  embryos, or upregulated in transgenic plants constitutively expressing the WRI1
  transcription factor. AGI numbers in black indicate that the expression of the corresponding
  gene is WRI1-independent. AGI numbers in blue indicate that no transcriptomic data
  was available. Abbreviations: DGAT1, acylCoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1; E4P,
  erythrose 4-phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; phytyl-PP, phytyl pyrophosphate.'
