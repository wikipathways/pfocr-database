caption: PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and its interaction with PTEN. The PI3K pathway regulates
  diverse cellular processes, including protein synthesis, cell survival, proliferation,
  glucose metabolism, apoptosis, DNA repair, and genome stability. Akt-mediated phosphorylation
  inhibits the activity of the TSC1-TSC2 complex, also known as hamartin-tuberin.
  This is a critical step for the negative regulation of mTORC1, whose activity controls
  anabolic processes. Another important downregulation of Akt phosphorylation is towards
  BAD, while MDM2 activity is enhanced, promoting the degradation of the tumor-suppressor
  p53, which also plays a part in the P300-mediated cell apoptosis. Cell cycle regulation
  occurs by means of cyclins A and D stimulation and GSK3 inhibition. The latter event
  is also responsible for increased glucose metabolism. PTEN is intimately involved
  in the regulation of these mechanisms through its substrate PIP3. Of note, the activity
  of PTEN in the cell nucleus that leads to cell survival control is related to the
  upregulation of key mediators, such as RAD51, CDNPC, and P300. RTK, receptor tyrosine
