caption: WNT signaling must be inhibited in the foregut and induced in the midgut
  and hindgut for proper regionalization of the GI tract epithelium. In the developing
  stomach, WNT signaling must be inhibited for proper gastric epithelial development.
  The absence of WNT is critical for establishment of SOX2 expression in this domain.
  The mesenchymal transcription factor BARX1 is required to inhibit WNT signaling
  in the foregut domain. BARX1 induces expression of the WNT inhibitors known as SFRPs
  (secreted frizzled-related proteins). In this environment of low WNT, proper formation
  of the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus, forestomach and glandular
  columnar epithelium of the hindstomach occurs. In the absence of BARX1, WNT is upregulated.
  The esophagus and forestomach epithelia take on a “squamo-glandular” hybrid structure
  whereas the hindstomach epithelium becomes intestinalized. BAPX1, another gastric
  mesenchymal factor, also contributes to differentiation of the gastric versus intestinal
  domains. In posterior endoderm regions, WNT signaling is permitted, and CDX2 is
  induced. In the colon, loss of the WNT effectors TCF1 and TCF4 blocks posterior
  gut development. Additionally, cross talk between HH and WNT is required to generate
  the simple columnar epithelium of the colon. In the absence of IHH, WNT is perturbed,
  and the epithelium is anteriorized. The table summarizes phenotypes in loss and
  gain of function experiments involving WNT activators and repressors, as well as
  proteins involved in cross talk with the WNT pathway, during GI tract development
  and epithelial morphogenesis.
