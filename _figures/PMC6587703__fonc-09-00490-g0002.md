caption: Mechanistic interactions between VEGF-targeted anti-angiogenic therapy and
  checkpoint inhibitors in the systemic treatment of mRCC. Various VEGF-targeted and
  mTOR-targeted anti-angiogenic agents are currently approved in mRCC, inhibiting
  VEGF-A (bevacizumab); VEGFR1-3, FGFR1-4, PDGFR- α, c-kit, and RET-oncogene (lenvatinib);
  c-MET, AXL and RET, and VEGFR2 (cabozantinib); c-KIT, FGFR, PDGFR, and VEGFR (pazopanib);
  VEGFR1-3, c-KIT, and PDGFR (axitinib); VEGFR, PDGFR, and Raf family kinases (sorafenib);
  VEGFRs, PDGFRs, and RET (sunitinib). Everolimus and temsirolimus are specific inhibitors
  of mTOR and interfere with the synthesis of proteins that regulate proliferation,
  growth and survival of tumor cells. These agents are more selective for the mTORC1
  protein complex, with very little impact on the mTORC2 complex. Nevertheless, increased
  tumor hypoxia during this anti-angiogenic therapy is the key player for developing
  TKI resistance, with consecutive HIF-α accumulation. Under hypoxia, PD-L1 upregulation
  was dependent on HIF-2α in RCC, being associated with simultaneous VEGF overexpression.
  Moreover, specimens from patients treated with anti-angiogenic therapy were associated
  with enhanced expression of PD-L1 (). Thus, combined blockade of PD-L1 (avelumab
  or atezolizumab) or PD-1 (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) along with inhibition of the
  angiogenesis pathway is an innovative therapeutic concept in mRCC.
