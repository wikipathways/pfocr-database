caption: Gene expression alterations in Manf mutants with a linkage to Parkinson's
  disease. A human disease KEGG pathway coloured with Drosophila homologues showing
  altered gene expression in Manf mutants - filled boxes with red represent genes
  that are upregulated, with blue downregulated expression or with purple differently
  altered gene expression between two Manf mutants. The unaltered components in the
  pathway are coloured green. Note that α-synuclein (SNCA) has no homologue in Drosophila.
  The complete list of altered genes is summarised in Table 11 with some additional
  genes not present in KEGG pathway but have been associated with PD elsewhere. The
  expression of genes with a role in dopamine uptake, intracellular transport, and
  synthesis is altered. Mitochondrial oxidative pathway complex I encoding genes show
  upregulation. The other mitochondrial proteins encoded by nuclear genes involved
  in PD such as Htra2 and DJ-1 expression is downregulated in Manf mutants. Some members
  of ubiquitin pathway are altered as well.
