caption: Notch and AMPK signaling pathways in PH. a Notch signaling pathway and targeted
  therapy in PH. BMPR2 mutations in PASMCs increase TNF, reducing BMPR2 and activating
  Notch2. Hypoxia induces the expression of lncRNA Tug1, which activates Notch1 signaling,
  thereby promoting the migration of PASMCs. Notch3 activation leads PASMC migration.
  Additionally, it can cause the release of NICD3, which downregulates p27kip1, further
  enhancing PASMC proliferation. In PAECs, DLL4 nAbs impair barrier function, and
  hypoxia activates Notch1 to promote proliferation. Notch signaling contributes to
  PH, with anti-TNF and Propylthiouracil as potential therapies. PASMC pulmonary artery
