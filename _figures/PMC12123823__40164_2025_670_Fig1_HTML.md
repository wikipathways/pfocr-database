caption: Mechanisms underlying NET formation. The genesis of NETs can be delineated
  into three principal mechanisms. The initial pathway, termed "suicidal NETosis",
  commences with nuclear membrane disintegration, followed by the dissolution of cellular
  polarity, chromatin decondensation, and ultimately, cell membrane rupture leading
  to cell death. A second pathway, identified as "vital NETosis", involves the encapsulation
  of decondensed chromatin within vesicles that are extruded from the cell, a process
  that does not entail cell demise. The final mechanism is mitochondrial DNA-dependent
  NETosis, which, akin to viable NETosis, is not associated with cell death and is
  specific to the viable NET formation
