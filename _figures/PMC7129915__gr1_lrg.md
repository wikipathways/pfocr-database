caption: Summary of antiviral signaling pathways in chickens. Chicken antiviral responses
  rely on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern
  recognition receptors (PRRs). Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is detected by chicken
  melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) or laboratory of genetics and
  physiology 2 (LGP2), which triggers downstream signaling mediated through mitochondrial
  antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). Endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), TLR3,
  TLR7 and TLR21 can recognize dsRNA, ssRNA and cytosine-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides
  (CpG ODNs), respectively. TLR3 signals through adaptor protein TIR-domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon (TRIF) and TLR7 and 21 signal through myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88 (MyD88). Surface TLR2 and 4 also signal through MyD88. However,
  when present in the phagosome, TLR4 signals through adaptor protein TRIF and TRAM
  (TRIF-related adaptor molecule). These adaptor molecules then activate the transcription
  factors interferon regulatory factor (IRF)7 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB),
  by coordinating the assembly of multi-protein complexes. Upon activation, IRF7 and
  NF-κB induce transcription of type I interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Additionally, secreted type I IFNs can activate
  Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway
  through type I IFN receptor binding. Activated JAK/STAT leads to the phosphorylation
  of STAT1 and STAT2 molecules, results in recognition of the IFN-stimulated response
  element (ISRE) and transcription of ISGs. Activation of these various pathways leads
  to the induction of an antiviral state. This figure was created using Servier Medical
