caption: Subcellular localization and function of the eukaryotic LSM complexes. LSM1
  protein promotes the assembly of the LSM1-7 complex in the cytoplasm. This complex
  is a critical component of the decapping machinery and, therefore, plays an essential
  role in the 5′-3′ mRNA decay pathway. LSM8, however, directs the formation of the
  LSM2-8 complex in the nucleus. This complex physically interacts with the oligo-U
  tract of the U6 snRNA to block its degradation by exonucleases. The LSM2-8 complex
  is a core component of the spliceosome and, coherently, participates in the splicing
  reaction.

  description: Subcellular localization and function of the eukaryotic LSM complexes.
    LSM1 protein promotes the assembly of the LSM1-7 complex in the cytoplasm. This
    complex is a critical component of the decapping machinery and, therefore, plays
    an essential role in the 5′-3′ mRNA decay pathway. LSM8, however, directs the
    formation of the LSM2-8 complex in the nucleus. This complex physically interacts
    with the oligo-U tract of the U6 snRNA to block its degradation by exonucleases.
    The LSM2-8 complex is a core component of the spliceosome and, coherently, participates
    in the splicing reaction.
