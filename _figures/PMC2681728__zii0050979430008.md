caption: Proposed model of the role of p47 in E. chaffeensis infection and survival
  in monocytes based on this study and previous reports (-, , ). Binding of E. chaffeensis
  to its receptor directly or indirectly activates FYN. Activated FYN tyrosine kinase
  phosphorylates and activates PLC-γ, which hydrolyzes membrane phospholipid PIP2
  (phosphatidylinositol biphosphate), resulting in increased level of IP3 and release
  of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and Ca2+ influx. FYN may regulate the function
  of IP3 receptor by phosphorylation and promoting release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic
  reticulum. FYN also phosphorylates caveolin-1 involved in ehrlichial entry. p47-PTPN2
  interaction modulates cytokine signaling events by exerting negative feedback on
  the Jak/Stat pathway by dephosphorylation of Jaks and Stats involved in intravacuolar
  maintenance and survival of E. chaffeensis. p47-PCGF5 interaction modulates gene
  transcription associated with cell signaling and remodeling of cytoskeleton, facilitating
  and supporting intracellular survival of E. chaffeensis. CAP1 promotes rapid actin
  dynamics in conjunction with ADF/cofilin and is required for cell morphology, migration,
  and endocytosis. Mitochondrial shuttling of CAP1 promotes actin- and cofilin-dependent
  apoptosis, which may play important role in release of DC ehrlichiae from the monocyte.
