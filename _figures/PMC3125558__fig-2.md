  description: KEGG pathway diagrams containing significantly altered metabolites.
    Significant urinary metabolites are shown on KEGG pathway diagrams with direction
    of change indicated. For completeness, identified metabolites with nonsignificant
    changes are also shown. Gray circles represent unobserved metabolites in this
    study, but in the KEGG pathway libraries. (a) Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism.
    (b) Benzoate degradation via hydroxylation. (c) Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate
    metabolism.
