caption: Lipids play key regulatory roles within the nucleus. Within membranes lipids
  (a) initiate signal cascades via recruitment of nuclear membrane proteins, as is
  the case in the best understood pathways correlated with extracellular signaling
  such as hormonal, cell migration signaling, inflammation or apoptotic response,
  and intracellular metabolic pathways such as the mTOR pathway; (b) as activators
  of nuclear receptors that activate or repress transcription, as is the case in PPAR-associated
  transcription and SF-1 targeted expression; and (c) within enigmatic nuclear micro-structures,
  such as nuclear speckles, where phospholipids mediate mRNA splicing factor activity
  (SF), polyadenylating polymerase activity (PAP) and modifications such as mRNA capping
  (CE). All these important activities highlight the importance of nuclear phospholipids
  in cellular physiology
