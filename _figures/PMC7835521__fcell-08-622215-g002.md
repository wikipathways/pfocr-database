caption: 'Cartoon model of ER–PM junction (store-operated Ca2+ entry system pathway).
  (A) Orai’s monomeric structure: TM1-4 and its C- and N-terminal endings facing the
  cytosol. (B) Orai channel structure: The channel is conformed by six subunits (monomers)
  which interact with each other due to the hydrophobic cluster (E106, V102, F99,
  R91) in their respective TM1. These interactions leave the ion pore at the center
  of the channel, and it is also stabilized by the TM1–TM2 turret, causing the channel’s
  selectivity. (C) STIM1 resting state: This protein seems to dimerize in basal conditions.
  STIM1 monomer’s structure consists of the EF-SAM calcium sensor, facing the ER-lumen,
  the TM domain, and the CC1, SOAR/CAD segments oriented to the cytosol. The STIM1
  monomer in the presence of calcium is folded into the cytosol domain due to hydrophobic
  interactions between the coiled coils. (D) STIM1 extended state: STIM1 interacts
  with EB1 protein, helping to remodel the ER and forming STIM1 clusters near the
  PM; its polybasic tail also seems to interact with the PM. When there is a Ca2+
  depletion in the ER lumen, STIM1 suffers a conformational change, and both monomers
  release its SOAR/CAD segments, which, in turn, interact with Orai. (E) Possible
  activation of Orai: STIM1 could contribute to either rotate Orai’s helices or help
  the subunits’ outward movement. Orai loses its high permeability and allows the
  entry of extracellular calcium. TM, transmembrane helices; EF-SAM, EF hand 1, non-canonical
  ER hand 2, and sterile alfa motile; CC1, coiled coil 1; SOAR/CAD, Stim1-Orai1 activating
  region/CRAC activation domain; EB1, microtubule plus-end tracking of end binding
  protein 1; cyt, cytosol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PM, plasma membrane.'
