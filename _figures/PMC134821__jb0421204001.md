caption: Parallel pathways for respiration and for biosynthesis. (a) Parallel pathways
  in respiration and ATP synthase in the cell membrane of E. coli. Q represents the
  mobile quinones and/or quinols that accept electrons from the dehydrogenases and
  transfer them to the terminal oxidases. Heavy arrows represent the major pathway
  during aerobic growth with substrates in excess, but all components shown play a
  role in electron transfer under these conditions (, , ). (b) Two pathways for glutamate
  synthesis. The solid circles (•) represent nitrogen as ammonia, amino, and amide.
  2OG is the citric acid cycle intermediate, 2-oxoglutarate. Glu, glutamate; Gln,
  glutamine; GS, glutamine synthetase; GOGAT, glutamate synthase. GOGAT transfers
  the amide group of Gln to 2OG to give two glutamates. Glutamate is formed in each
  pathway by reductive amination with NADPH (not shown).
