caption: i. NGF is released from diseased tissues (e.g., sites of injury, inflammation,
  cancer) in close proximity to the peripheral endings of nociceptors. ii. At the
  surface of nociceptors, NGF binds to both NRP1 and TrkA, forming a ternary NGF/NRP1/TrkA
  complex with a 2:2:2 stoichiometry. iii. TrkA signals from the plasma membrane and
  endosomes to activate kinases and ion channels. iv. Activation and sensitization
  of TRPV1 and Na+ and Ca2+ channels lead to increased excitability of nociceptors.
  v. NRP1 chaperones TrkA from the biosynthetic pathway to the plasma membrane and
  to signaling endosomes, which further enhances excitability of nociceptors. vi.
  GIPC1 interacts with NRP1 and TrkA, linking the complex to the myosin VI molecular
  motor to amplify pain signaling. As such, by binding NGF and interacting with TrkA,
  NRP1 is a coreceptor that facilitates NGF/TrkA signaling of pain
