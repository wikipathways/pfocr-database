caption: Schematic diagram of NOX2 and NOX2 regulatory subunits, along with sites
  of inhibitor action. NOX2 and p22phox are shown in the membrane, along with NOX2
  regulating cytosolic subunits. PRD refers to the proline-rich domain of p22phox.
  Shown also is the pathway of electron flow from FAD through the two heme groups
  (represented by red squares). FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; NADPH, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form; NOX, NADPH oxidase. To see this illustration
