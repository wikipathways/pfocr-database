caption: Schematic representation of nodes of therapeutic blockade in the PI3K and
  other signaling pathways that synergize with BET inhibition. PI3Ks are a family
  of heterodimeric proteins that can be activated downstream of RTKs, GPCRs and small-GTPases.
  They catalyze the conversion of PIP2 to the second messenger PIP3 which helps recruit
  to the membrane proteins that contain a PH-domain such as AKT, PDK1, mTORC2 and
  PREX1/2. PI3K activity can be attenuated by several phosphatases including PTEN,
  SHIP1/2 and INPP4B. AKT acts as a major mediator of PI3K signaling by phosphorylating
  a wide range of substrates that regulate cell growth, proliferation, metabolism
  and survival. Given the high frequency of PI3K pathway activation in human cancers
  several inhibitors targeting kinases throughout the pathway are currently being
  evaluated in clinical trials. However their efficacy as monotherapies can be limited
  due to a variety of mechanisms including the unleashing of FOXO- and mTORC1-mediated
  feedback loops that reactivate the pathway. Inhibition of BET proteins has recently
  been shown to effectively block adaptive signaling response of cancer cells to inhibitors
  of the PI3K pathway and other signaling pathways (shown in red rectangles) suggesting
  they may be rational combinatorial partners for multiple oncogenic signals.
