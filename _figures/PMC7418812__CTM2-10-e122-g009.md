caption: A model for glucose regulation ovarian primordial follicles activation via
  the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. Only core components of the pathway are shown.
  Adequate glucose (middle right) reduce the ratio of AMP/ATP in primordial follicle,
  thus inhibit phosphorylation of AMPK. In turn, it promotes the phosphorylation of
  mTOR and activates the phosphorylation of S6 protein. By activating the expression
  of p‐S6 downstream genes and proteins, the primordial follicle is activated finally.
  The AMPK‐Hippo‐YAP (bottom left) and AMPK‐YAP (bottom right) signaling pathway does
  not work in the ovarian primordial follicles activation. Black arrow shows the effect
  of low glucose, the red arrow shows the effect of adequate glucose. The red cross
  symbol means no effect
