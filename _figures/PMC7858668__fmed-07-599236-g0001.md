caption: The role of complement in diabetic kidney disease. Clinical manifestations
  of diabetic kidney disease include arteriole hyalinosis, mesangial expansion, glomerular
  basement membrane (GBM) thickening, podocyte loss, glomerular hyperfiltration, albuminuria
  (or proteinuria), immune cell recruitment, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy
  (Top). Complement activation within podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells is
  noted in DKD (Bottom Left). Diabetes induced downregulation of the C3 convertase
  inhibitor, DAF, leads to aberrant C3 hydrolysis and subsequent C3a/C3aR signaling
  in podocytes. Additionally, hyperglycemia induced mannose binding lectin (MBL) activation
  further propagates the lectin pathway. C3a/C3aR signaling decreases cAMP activity,
  increasing reactive oxidative species (ROS) production within the mitochondria while
  similarly inducing IL-1β signaling leading to f-actin remodeling. Cytoskeletal rearrangement
  eventually leads to podocyte loss and sclerosis after continuous inflammatory insult.
  Podocyte sclerosis is further promoted by crosstalk with glomerular endothelial
  cells exposed to hyperglycemia. Paracrine communication of profibrotic factors is
  promoted by C5a/C5aR and C3a/C3aR signaling similarly leading to fibrosis of glomerular
  endothelial cells themselves. C3aR and C5aR inhibitors as well as upstream C1-INH
  and OMS721 complement targets may help relieve glomerulosclerosis. Complement activation
  within tubular epithelial cells is noted in DKD (Bottom Right). Hyperglycemia induces
  activates complement through enhanced MBL activity. Eventual C5 hydrolysis leads
  to C5a/C5aR signaling promoting proinflammatory chemokine secretion and TGF-β mediated
  interstitial fibrosis. The inflammatory response encourages immune cell recruitment
  leading to cellular infiltrates. The increased glycation events also decrease activation
  of the membrane attack complex (MAC)-inhibitor, CD59. The combined MAC formation
  and immune cell infiltration encourage tubular cell lysis and apoptosis. C5aR inhibitors,
  Eculizumab, DPP-4 inhibitors, C1-INH, and OMS721 may improve disease progression
  by uncoupling some of these pathogenic mechanisms.
