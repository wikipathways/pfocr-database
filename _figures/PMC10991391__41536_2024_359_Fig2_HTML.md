caption: a Soft ECM activates the Rho-mDia signalling cascade leading to increased
  lipid synthesis by accumulating SREBP at the Golgi apparatus that in turn after
  being cleaved can upregulate the expression of HMG-CoA and LDL receptor for the
  mevalonate and lipid synthesis pathway. Additionally, soft ECM regulates the integrin
  co-receptor CD98hc to import sphingolipids which helps in increasing the lipid content
  in the cell and therefore also the Rho recruitment to the cell membrane. b Stiff
  ECM activates the Rho-ROCK signalling cascade leading to higher glycolytic rates
  by on one hand inhibiting the degradation of phosphofructokinase (PFK) and on the
  other hand inhibiting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and stimulating Na+/H+
  exchangers to promote higher pH for elevated glycolytic flux. ALDO aldolase, DAG
  diacylglycerol, DHAP dihydroxyacetone phosphate, F1,6BP fructose 1,6-bisphosphate,
  G3P glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, HMG-CoA β-hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-CoA, LDL low-density
  lipoprotein, LPIN1 phosphatidate phosphatase lipin 1, mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin.
