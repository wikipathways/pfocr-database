caption: Pathogenesis of HMGB1 in alopecia areata. The NLR family pyrin domain-containing
  3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is activated in the outer hair root sheath cells of patients
  with alopecia areata. This results in the simultaneous release of interleukin-1β
  (IL-1β) and high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1), which bind to the interleukin-1
  receptor (IL-1R) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)/toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) on the surface of CD8+ T cells, respectively, and promote the secretion
  of interferon-γ (IFNγ) by CD8+ T cells. Many CD8+ T cells accumulate to accelerate
  the death of hair follicles, while injured hair follicle dermal papilla cells secrete
  HMGB1. This activates the WNT/Notch signalling pathway through binding to TLR4 on
  the surface of stem cells to promote their proliferation, thereby regenerating hair
