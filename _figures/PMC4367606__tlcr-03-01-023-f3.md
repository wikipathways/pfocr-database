caption: 'Strategies for γδ T cell based immunotherapy. Left panel, the adoptive cell
  transfer of in vitro expanded γδ T cells. Right panel, the in vivo activation of
  γδ T cells by phosphoantigens (e.g., BrHPP) or aminobisphosphonates and low-dose
  IL-2. The concomitant injection of aminobisphosphonate leads to intracellular accumulation
  of IPP/ApppI in tumor cells by blocking the mevalonate pathway, resulting in the
  sensitization of tumor cells to γδ T cells. Abbreviations: BrHPP, phosphorylated
  bromohydrin; IL-2, interleukin-2; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate.'
