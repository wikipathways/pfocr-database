caption: Metabolic characteristics of M1/M [LPS(±IFN-γ)] macrophages. (I) Arginine
  is metabolized by iNOS to citrulline and NO. Citrulline can be used with aspartate,
  as catalyzed by Ass1, to generate argininosuccinate, which is further catalyzed
  by Asl to arginine and fumarate; (II) glycolytic activity is enhanced; (III) PPP
  activity is increased, generating NADPH for ROS and NO production by NAPDH oxidase
  and iNOS, respectively; and (IV) citrate accumulates and is then exported into the
  cytoplasm via CIC and transformed into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate via ACLY. Acetyl-CoA
  is used for FAS and protein acetylation. Oxaloacetate is further metabolized to
  pyruvate, accompanied by NADPH and NO production. Citrate also generates itaconate
  via IRG1, thus inhibiting SDH and causing the second break in the TCA cycle. (VI)
  Succinate accumulates via inhibition of SDH (VII) and derivation from glutamine
  through anaplerosis via αKG and the GABA shunt pathway. Succinate can stabilize
  HIF1α, leading to the release of IL-1β. (VIII) The high mitochondrial membrane potential
  induced by LPS leads to reversal of the normal direction of electron flux through
  complex III, causing RET in complex I and driving ROS production. Succinate can
  also be released into the extracellular milieu, where it is sensed by GPR91 to promote
  inflammatory responses. GLUT, glucose transporter; HK, hexokinase; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
