caption: 'Schematic diagram of a possible molecular mechanism by which alpha-synuclein
  monomers/oligomers/ synuclein fibrils can modulate the A2AR homoreceptor complexes
  and A2AR-D2R, mGluR5-A2AR-D2R heteroreceptor complexes and their balance in the
  plasma membrane.It is proposed that monomeric alpha-synuclein TM peptides can become
  linked to the A2AR homoreceptor complex and modulate the A2AR function. Under the
  modulation of the monomeric alpha-synuclein peptides the A2AR antagonist (e.g.,
  istradefylline) may favour the formation of non-propagating alpha-synuclein dimers
  (pathway highlighted in red). Instead, the A2A receptor agonist induced A2AR activation
  (pathway highlighted in green) may in the alpha-synuclein-A2AR complex produce signals
  that favour the propagation of alpha-synuclein dimers/oligomers into small and large
  synuclein aggregates that accumulate in Lewy bodies. Ring-like synuclein oligomers
  can also be formed, which enter the plasma membrane and there produce beta sheet
  structures that associate and produce pores through which calcium ions may pass.
  The A2AR-D2R heteroreceptor complexes plays a relevant role since the activation
  of the A2AR protomer with an A2AR agonist inhibits the D2R protomer signaling and
  increases motor inhibition. There also likely exist in this motor inhibition pathway
  A2AR-mGluR5 heteroreceptor complexes and A2AR-D2R-mGluR5 heteroreceptor complexes
  in balance with the A2AR-D2R heteroreceptor complexes. A2AR: Adenosine A2A receptor;
  D2R: dopmaine D2 receptor; PD: Parkinson’s disease; TM: transmembrane.'
