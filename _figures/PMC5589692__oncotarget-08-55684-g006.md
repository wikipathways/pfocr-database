caption: The actin remodeling following the binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 requires a
  cooperative interaction between VEGFR-2 and integrins, especially integrin αvβ3.
  The activation of VEGFR-2 initiates its autophosphorylation at Tyr1214. Then, follows
  the recruitment of Nck to VEGFR-2 and the sequential activation of Fyn, Cdc42 and
  PAK upstream of the p38 MAP kinase module. Activation of p38 leads to activation
  of MAPKAP kinase-2 (MK2), which contributes to increase the level of polymerized
  actin by phosphorylating HSP27. Interestingly, activation of MK2 also activates
  LIMK1, which phosphorylates annexin A1 (ANXA) to promote formation of lamellipodia
  and cell protrusion. Of note, Nck can also trigger actin polymerization through
  activation of the WASP-Arp2/3 pathway. Both together, actin polymerization associated
  with stress fibers-mediated cell contraction and lamellipodia-mediated increased
  cell protrusion contribute to sustained cell migration, an essential step of angiogenesis.
