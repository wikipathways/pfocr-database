caption: Model of IKBKE mediated AR signalling. (A) IKBKE up-regulation in prostate
  cancer enhances the ubiquitination and turnover of LATS2 in a kinase dependent manner.
  This is turn promotes nuclear localization of YAP and transcription of YAP regulated
  genes, including c-MYC. Up-regulated levels of nuclear c-MYC result in up-regulation
  of c-MYC regulated genes, such as AR. This results in a large pool of AR in cells
  which in turn, upon ligand mediated activation can also be co-activated by nuclear
  YAP. (B) Upon inhibition of IKBKE kinase activity, LATS2-Ub is impaired allowing
  the protein to accumulate and phosphorylate YAP. Phosphorylated YAP is held in the
  cytoplasm and subsequently targeted for proteasomal degradation. This results in
  c-MYC downregulation which in turn results in AR down-regulation, including constitutively
  active AR splice variants, and therefore AR regulated gene expression. Ub, ubiquitin;
  P, phosphate.
