caption: Figure 3. RNA helicases in E. coli ribosome assembly. The relative order
  of RNA helicase function in ribosome assembly and the sizes of intermediate 50S
  subunit particles that accumulate in RNA helicase mutants are indicated. RhlE functions
  early in the assembly process and is proposed to dictate whether assembly will follow
  an SrmB- or DeaD-specific pathway. Whether the ribosome biosynthetic pathway involves
  both RNA helicases or if separate SrmB- and DeaD-specific pathways function at high
  and low temperature, respectively, is not known. SrmB interaction with L4, L24 and
  the 23S rRNA indicates that it functions before DeaD however there is crosstalk
  between the two helicases as DeaD overexpression partially rescues the assembly
  defect in ΔsrmB cells (black dotted arrow). SrmB is required to form the L1024 G-ribo
  wrench pseudoknot, providing the nucleation site for L13 and subsequent events early
  in ribosome assembly. The role of DbpA in assembly is controversial but is reported
  to act late in the process, performing a function that occurs in the absence of
  DbpA, but not in cells expressing both wild type and mutant R331A proteins., DeaD
  has also been shown to be required for a very late step in 30S assembly involving
  16S rRNA.deaD inactivation is partially alleviated by overexpression of cold-induced
  proteins, RNase R or CspA,, and also RhlE (green dotted arrow), which catalyze RNA
  unwinding.,, These observations suggest that DeaD functions to remove inhibitory
  RNA secondary structures whose stability is enhanced at low temperature. The overall
  objective is to produce stress-condition-specific ribosomes differing in their subunit
  composition e.g., a cold adapted ribosome. The figure is adapted from Shajani et
