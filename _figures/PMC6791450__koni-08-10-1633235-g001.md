caption: 'Metformin: A multi-faceted immuno-metabolic adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.
  (a). Evidences. The anti-diabetic agent metformin might serve as an archetype immuno-metabolic
  adjuvant capable of simultaneously regulating, in the appropriate direction and
  intensity, antitumor immunity-related metabolic checkpoints not only in T-cells,
  cancer cells and associated immune suppressor cells of the TME, but also in the
  gut microbiota and its systemic effects on host metabolism. The capacity to improve
  the metabolic competence of T-cell immune surveillance, suppress the metabolic traits
  of immunosuppressive cell subsets in the TME, prevent both the constitutive and
  the inflammation (IFNγ)-inducible expression of immune checkpoint receptors in cancer
  cells, and shift the gut microbiota composition towards specific commensal microbes
  might optimize the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy. Further studies are needed
  to determine the effects of metformin on tumor antigen cross-presentation by dendritic
  cells and tumor cell lysis by natural killer cells. (b). Mechanisms. As a consequence
  of the metformin-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial electron transfer, metformin
  is able to activate a variety of AMPK-dependent and -independent signaling pathways
  through which it facilitates the inhibition of mTOR, inhibits the inflammatory pathway,
  and lastly disturbs inflammation, cellular survival, stress defense, protein synthesis,
  autophagy, and epigenetic reprogramming .– Downstream of these major biological
  outcomes, metformin might have the capacity to impact all the cancer-immune system
  interactions constituting the so-called “cancer immunogram”. Metformin might lead
  to systemically decreased levels of pro-inflammatory soluble inhibitors (e.g., serum
  levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6–), which are known to drive tumor-associated
  inflammation, impair T cell-mediated tumor control, and associate with poor outcomes
  in response to ICIs (1). Metformin might increase tumor sensitivity to immune effectors
  by augmenting the levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens
  (2), which might impact also tumor foreignness by helping T-cells to recognize neoantigens
  (3). Metformin might alter the general performance of immune system via modification
  of the microbiome (4), specifically by changing microbial folate and serine/methionine
  metabolism.– Metformin might reverse an inhibitory tumor metabolism by remodeling
  the hypoxic TME via reduction of intratumoral hypoxia (5), a key driver of poor
  outcomes upon ICIs. Metformin might sustain or restore the infiltration of tumor-reactive
  T-cells into the tumor (6) by preventing the occurrence of dysfunctional states
  characterized by impaired activity and proliferative activity, increase apoptotic
  rate, and reduced production of effector cytokines (i.e., T-cell exhaustion). Metformin
  might alter the expression profile of immune checkpoints (7) such as PD-L1 in the
  tumor compartment [37, ], thus suggesting that a combination of metformin-CTLA-4
  blockade might have the potential to increase the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.'
