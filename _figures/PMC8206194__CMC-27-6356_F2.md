caption: 'Mechanism of action of romosozumab. The Wnt pathway is activated by the
  interaction between LRP5/6, Wnt and Frizzled. As a consequence, b-catenin is released,
  enters the nucleus and activates transcription from Wnt target genes. Sclerostin
  binding to LRP5/6 and Frizzled coreceptors on osteoblasts inhibits Wnt canonical
  pathway and b-catenin is consequently phosphorylated and degraded. Sclerostin inhibits
  bone formation by inhibiting osteoblasts and increases bone resorption by increasing
  RANKL production by osteoblasts. Romosozumab inhibits sclerostin allowing for increased
  Wnt signaling. Sclerostin inactivates the Wnt pathway by binding to LRP5/6 and b-catenin
  is consequently phosphorylated and degraded.Abbreviations: Low-density lipoprotein
  receptor proteins (LRP), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), Protein kinase
  A (PKA), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). (A higher resolution / colour
  version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article).'
