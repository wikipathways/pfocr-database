caption: Examples of sterols and steroids. The endogenous sterol pathway in yeast
  is highlighted in yellow, heterogenous synthesis of animal-derived sterols in yeast
  is highlighted in red, heterogenous synthesis of phytosterols in yeast is highlighted
  in green and steroids derived from sterols are highlighted in blue. Solid arrows
  represent de novo routes examined in yeast and dashed arrows indicate potential
  synthetic pathways. De novo biosynthesis of the steroidal compounds marked in blue
  are not yet realized in yeast
