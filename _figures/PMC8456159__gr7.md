caption: Model for the biology underlying the 14q24 RCC susceptibility locusThe risk-associated
  rs49030674-C allele creates a binding site for HIF1 and acts as an enhancer, while
  the protective T allele creates a binding site for IRX2/5 and acts as transcriptional
  repressor. Therefore, the rs4903064-C risk allele is associated with increasing
  expression of DPF3, which is a member of the BAF SWI/SNF complex. DPF3 overexpression
  changes chromatin accessibility, leading to changes in gene expression profile,
  including overexpression of CEMIP and IL-23R. CEMIP is an anti-apoptosis gene and
  IL-23R is part of the STAT3 pathway. Downstream, the reduction of apoptosis and
  activation of the STAT3 pathway, a vital step on RCC oncogenesis, increases the
  probability of developing renal cancer.
