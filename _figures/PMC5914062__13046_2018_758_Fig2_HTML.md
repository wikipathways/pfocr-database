caption: A schematic model illustrating the relationship between glucose metabolism
  and radiation resistance. Radiation-resistant cells exhibit an active glycolytic
  phenotype, and the enzymes in the glycolytic pathway play an important role in the
  process of radioresistance and can serve as targets for improving the efficacy of
  radiotherapy. In addition, HIF is able to activate glycolytic enzymes and promote
  the occurrence of radioresistance by inducing cell autophagy and angiogenesis. *
  was used to represent the targets to enhance radiosensitivity, the corresponding
  radiosensitizers are indicated in the same color in rectangle
