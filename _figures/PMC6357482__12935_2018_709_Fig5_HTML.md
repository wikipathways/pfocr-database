caption: Schema of miR-7 regulated EGFR, IGF1R and Wave3 pathway. miR-7 is expressed
  at a low level in highly invasive cells, and when added as a form of mimic, it appears
  to play a more potent role in inhibition of invasive breast cancer cell migration.
  More importantly, miR-7 mimic indeed has a dual effect as it also significantly
  inhibits the proliferative, chemotactic and angiogenic-like homing characteristics
  of endothelial cells especially in response to o chemoattractant factors produced
  by aggressive breast cancer cells, also suggesting that miR-7 may be developed as
  an anti-cancer therapeutic potentially capable of suppressing breast cancer metastasis
  and tumour-associated angiogenesis simultaneously []
