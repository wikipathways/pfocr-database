caption: Axial skeleton of new born mice upon partial loss-of-function of Cdx genes
  and upon precocious HoxPG13 expression (A–E) and schematic representation of positive
  and negative regulators of axial extension before and after the trunk-tail transition
  (F). A, Cdx loss-of-function mutations (loss of one allele of Cdx2 and of both alleles
  of Cdx4) arrest axial extension prematurely. B, Wild type. C, Gain of function of
  the central Hox gene Hoxb8 partially rescues axial extension in Cdx mutants. D,
  Hoxc13 early gain of function leads to posterior axial truncation. E, Posterior
  activation of the canonical Wnt pathway by Lef1 constitutive expression partially
  rescues axial elongation in Cdx mutants. The posterior axial skeleton of new borns
  is shown with anterior on the left. See text for more details. F, Schematic representation
  of axial extension of trunk and tail between early somite stage (E8.0, X axis) and
  the end of posterior extension by tissue addition (E13.5). Shown are positive (“Central”
  Hox genes, and Cdx genes), and negative (HoxPG13) regulators of axial extension,
  and some of the effectors of axial growth between developmental stages E8.0 and
  E13.5. Expression levels (not to scale) are schematically indicated in the Y dimension.
  In green, growth stimulatory central Hox and Cdx expression, with Wnt signaling
  (blue) and RA clearance (orange) showing a parallel course. In red, growth inhibitory
  HoxPG13 expression. Decrease of axial growth stimulation and increase of inhibition
  correspond to the trunk-tail transition (around E10.5).
