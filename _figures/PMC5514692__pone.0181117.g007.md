caption: Before heme iron can be utilized, heme must be extracted from hemoglobin
  by proteolytic activity in the stomach and duodenum. Intestinal heme uptake occurs
  in the proximal part of the duodenum. The first step in heme iron absorption involves
  intact heme transport across the apical membrane to the enterocyte interior via
  the HCP1 and HRG1 importers. The passage of heme iron through the enterocyte then
  divides into two separate pathways. First, intracytoplasmic heme can be catabolized
  by heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), a process leading to the release of ferrous iron. Freed
  heme iron is then neutralized by ferritin, a cytosolic multimeric iron-storage protein,
  or recycled to the circulation via ferroportin (Fpn), where it is bound by transferrin
  (Tf). Free heme, apart from being a substrate of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed
  by HO1, may induce the expression of both Hmox1 and Fpn genes at the transcriptional
  level via the MARE/ARE sequence motif, a regulatory mechanism that involves inactivation
  of the transcriptional repressor Bach1 and the recruitment of the transcriptional
  activator Nrf2. In addition, iron extracted from the protoporphyrin ring of heme
  can promote the translation of the Fpn transcript containing the Iron Responsive
  Element (IRE) in its 5’ UTR via the Iron Regulatory Proteins. Finally, up-regulation
  of Fpn on the enterocyte basolateral surface of hemoglobin-fed piglets may be due
  to the reduced binding of hepcidin (showing a residual concentration in the blood
  plasma) to cell surface Fpn and thus to its limited internalization and degradation.
  Orchestrated up-regulation of Fpn expression in duodenal enterocytes at different
  regulatory steps may be a key event in understanding high heme bioavailability.
  The second, minor, pathway of heme iron movement involves the transport of intact
  heme, not catabolized by HO1, across the basolateral membrane by FLVCR1 to the plasma,
  where it is captured by hemopexin (Hpx) and delivered in the form of heme-hemopexin
  via receptor CD91 to various sites in the body.
