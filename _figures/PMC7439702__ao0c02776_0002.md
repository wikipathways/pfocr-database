caption: Chemical structures of representatives of abyssomicins and the role of AbmU
  in the biosynthetic pathway of neoabyssomicins. (A) Chemical structures for representatives
  of type II abyssomicins; 1–3 were isolated from S. koyangensis SCSIO 5802. (B) Chemical
  structures of representatives of type I compounds. (C) Genetic organization of the
  neoabyssomicin/abyssomicin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. koyangensis SCSIO 5802.
  The [4 + 2] cyclase is shaded in brown. (D) Proposed pathway for neoabyssomicin/abyssomicin
  construction in S. koyangensis SCSIO 5802; the AbmU-catalyzed transformation has
  been validated in this work.
