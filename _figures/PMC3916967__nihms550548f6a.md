caption: A. Y265C Pol β promotes deletion during joining of the V and D fragments.
  This cartoon depicts joining of the V to the D fragment. After the Rag proteins
  cleave the DNA, hairpins form. Artemis nicks the hairpins which sometime results
  in a substrate with DNA gaps. WT Pol β or other × family polymerases fill the gaps.
  However, in the presence of the slow Y265C Pol β polymerase, gaps are filled inefficiently,
  which can result in nuclease activity leading to deletions and shortening of the
  CDR3 junction. B. Y265C permits highly error-prone SHM resulting in autoimmunity.
  After deamination of cytosine by AID, replication can occur resulting in transitions.
  Alternatively, the mismatch repair pathway can bind to the U:G mismatch and recruit
  Exo 1, resulting in mutations at A:T base pairs. A third possibility is that APE1
  incises the DNA at the AP site, resulting in a single nucleotide gap that is normally
  filled in by Pol β. However, in the presence of Y265C Pol β the gap is filled inefficiently
  or not at all, leading to translesion synthesis and increased mutagenesis.
