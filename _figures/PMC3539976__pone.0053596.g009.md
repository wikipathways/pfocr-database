caption: BDNF peptides B-5 and B-3 may interact with or compete for the binding site
  of BDNF to its transmembrane receptor TrkB. Depending on the concentration or the
  cellular state or condition (i.e. during stress, like in the presence of H2O2),
  the peptides could act as partial agonists or partial antagonists. Fig. 8A shows
  the partial agonistic role of the peptides. In this case, the peptides favor the
  activation of the TrkB receptor, and in the presence of BDNF, they synergize with
  it. Once the TrkB receptor gets activated, it is dimerized and autophosphorylated
  (one of the residues that gets phosphorylated is the Tyr 706) and the signal is
  transduced. The cascades that could be activated by the peptides include the differentiation
  pathway through MAPK and pCREB regulating gene expression of markers of neuronal
  phenotype and plasticity, and also the expression of BDNF and TrkB, giving the possibility
  of a feedback mechanism. The other cascade that could be activated by the peptides
  is the survival one, in which PI3K and AKT participate to enhance survival and inhibit
  cell death. Fig. 8B represents the partial antagonistic role of the peptides where
  the peptides compete with BDNF for the activation of the receptor blocking the TrkB
  activation by BDNF and its signal transduction pathway. The sites where the TrkB
  inhibitor K252a and the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX can block the pathway are
  shown with a grey and red bar, respectively.
