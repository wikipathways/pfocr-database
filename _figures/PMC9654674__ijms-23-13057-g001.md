caption: Schematic representation of phytoglobin (Pgb)-NO respiration in hypoxic roots
  and nodules. Inside mitochondria, pyruvate is oxidized through the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle to generate NADH. Mitochondrial internal dehydrogenase and external
  dehydrogenases, respectively, oxidize matricial and cytosolic NADH and NADPH. Electrons
  are transferred to either alternative oxidase or cytochrome oxidase. Nitrite (NO2−)
  is reduced into NO at both alternative oxidase and cytochrome oxidase sites. NO
  diffuses into the cytosol, where it is oxidized into nitrate (NO3−) by phytoglobins
  (Pgb1.1). Nitrate reductase (NR) reduces NO3− into NO2−, which is transported into
  the mitochondria. ATP is synthesized due to the trans-membrane electrochemical gradient
  generated by proton (H+) pumping at the different sites of the electron transfer
  chain. Tungstate (WO4=) inhibits Pgb–NO respiration via NR inhibition. Pyr, pyruvate.
