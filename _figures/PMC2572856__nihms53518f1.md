  disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease y[].(b) attenuated β-catenin signaling is
  implicated in Alzheimer’s disease [].(c) TGFβ/Notch balance associated with skeletal
  muscle repair deficiency, due to elevated levels of P-SMAD present on CDK inhibitor
  promoter regions [].(d) Altered MAPK signaling in mouse liver [], rat aorta [],
  human skeletal muscle [], mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs)/osteoblasts [],
  human T cells [] and rat basal forebrain [].(e) aberrant Akt phosphorylation levels

  [], rat enterocytes [], and rat kidney [].(f) exogenous Shh administration promoted
  revascularization and improved wound repair in mouse myocardial ischemia [] and
  mouse diabetic ulcer models [], respectively, and also protected dopaminergic neurons

  matter of Multiple Sclerosis patients [].Notably, it is likely that many of these
  identified signaling aberrations deleteriously affect numerous targets. Deciphering
  these interactions, as well as uncovering other modes of pathway integration, will
  play a prominent role in the future development of targeted signaling manipulation
