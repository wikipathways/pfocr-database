caption: Metabolic and respiratory chain plasticity is central to pathogenesis. A,
  Porphyromonas gingivalis undergoes a metabolic transition, forming a biofilm due
  to exogenous pyruvate availability. Upregulated pathways and metabolites are depicted
  in green, downregulated pathways and metabolites are depicted in red, and unaltered
  pathways and metabolites are shown in black. The presence of exogenous pyruvate
  shifts central carbon metabolism towards gluconeogenesis and anabolism. This causes
  a change in gene expression, particularly leading to higher expression of fimbrial
  adhesion genes (fimA), which is essential for biofilm formation (24). B, the respiratory
  chain of bacteria is highly flexible. Electrons enter the respiratory chain through
  dehydrogenases that oxidize the cognate electron donor. Various examples of electron
  donors are depicted in the figure. These electrons are passed through various dehydrogenases
  to the mobile electron carriers that shuttle them to the terminal oxidoreductases.
  These oxidases utilize the received electrons to reduce their cognate terminal electron
  acceptor. Examples of terminal electron acceptors are depicted in the figure. During
  electron transfer, the reduction potential-favored flow of electrons provides energy
  to pump protons into the periplasmic space. This creates a transmembrane proton
  motive force which is used to drive ATP synthesis via the ATP synthase (22, 23,
  27). Gly-3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide
