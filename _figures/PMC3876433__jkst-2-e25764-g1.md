caption: 'Figure 1. STAT3 and STAT5 signaling in normal and transformed cells. In
  normal cells, cytokines binding to their receptors results in the activation of
  JAK tyrosine kinases and STAT3 or STAT5 (STAT3/5). Tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3/5
  proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Whereas
  STAT3/5 activation is tightly regulated in normal cells, the oncogenic activation
  of tyrosine kinases causes constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3/5. This
  leads to permanent changes in the expression of genes that control cellular processes
  such as proliferation survival, angiogenesis, and immune response which are commonly
  disrupted in cancer. Constitutively active STAT5 and possibly STAT3 proteins also
  interact with the scaffolding adaptor Gab2 in the cytoplasm of transformed cells
  to activate the PI3-Kinase/Akt pathway, which plays an important role in survival,
  proliferation, and metabolism regulation. This figure was produced using Servier
