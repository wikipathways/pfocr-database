caption: Activation of NF-κB by the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. (A) Activation of
  NF-κB via the PI3K/AKT pathway. Activation of the PI3K pathway by RAS results in
  the production of AKT. AKT activates NF-κB through the activation of IKK. Activation
  of NF-κB results in Snail-induced EMT. PI3K signaling is antagonized by PTEN; however,
  up-regulation in Snail inhibits PTEN, resulting in a self-amplification cycle. (B)
  Activation of NF-κB via the MAPK pathway NF-κB is regulated through MEK-induced
  activation of IKK and ERK-induced up-regulation of Snail. (C) Regulation of Snail
  via RKIP and PTEN up-regulation of Snail through the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways
  inhibits both PTEN and RKIP, which then, in turn, amplifies the expression of Snail.
