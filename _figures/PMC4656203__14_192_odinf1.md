caption: Schematic representation of folate transport and folate mediated 1-carbon
  metabolism in eukaryotic cells (for gene abbreviations and enzyme commission numbers,
  see  and , respectively). Before entering the cells, folate polyglutamates are converted
  to monoglutamates by the enzyme GGH. Transport of folate monoglutamates into the
  cells may occur through the proton-coupled folate transporter SLC46A1/PCFT, or SLC19A1/RFC-1,
  which utilizes the organic phosphate (OP−) gradient. Folates also may be transported
  via an endocytic mechanism by FOLR1, FOLR2 and FOLR3, possibly mediated by SLC46A1/PCFT.
  Export of folate monoglutamates occurs via ABCC1 and ABCC3. In the cytoplasm, the
  enzyme FPGS converts folate monoglutamates to polyglutamates, which is an essential
  step for folate homeostasis. The enzyme GGH is active also in the cytoplasm where
  it is primarily located to the lysosomes. Folate polyglutamates are considered to
  be better substrates than monoglutamates for enzymes involved in the folate metabolism.
  However, in eukaryotic cells the folate metabolism is highly compartmentalized and
  the distribution of folate cofactors and the extent of folate polyglutamation differ
  in cytosolic and mitochondrial pools. One-carbon metabolism in mitochondria is needed
  to generate formate for one-carbon metabolism in the cytoplasm. Two enzyme steps
  are required to convert 5-formylTHF (leucovorin) to methyleneTHF. The first step
  is usually catalyzed by MTHFS, which is considered to be “rate-limiting” with regard
  to the generation of methyleneTHF. 5-formylTHF also may be converted to 5,10-methyleneTHF
  by the actions of FTCD and SHMT1. Other enzymes involved in the folate metabolism
  are ALDH1L1, ALDH1L2, AMT, ATIC, FTCD, GART, MTFMT, MTHFD1, MTHFD1L, MTHFD2, SHMT1
  and SHMT2. Note that only those proteins encoded by genes analyzed in the present
  study have been depicted in the figure. Also, some of the gene products, which in
  the figure are described as active in the cell membrane or cytoplasm, may also be
  active in mitochondria (for example, SLC19A1/RFC-1, FPGS and MTHFS), or may have
  dual actions. For instance, AMT in mitochondria also catalyzes the conversion of
  5,10-methenylTHF to 5-formylTHF, which subsequently is converted back to 5,10-methenylTHF
  by MTHFS. THF = tetrahydrofolate,   = folate polyglutamate,   = folate monoglutamate.
