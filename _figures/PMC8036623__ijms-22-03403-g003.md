caption: Relationship between stress, proteolysis, and VEGF-mediated angiogenesis.
  Stress induces expression of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EP), and isoproterenol
  (Iso) []. NE activates β-adrenergic receptors, which activates the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-
  protein kinase A signaling pathway []. This pathway leads to an upregulation of
  VEGF as well as MMPs, such as MMP-2 and MMP-9 []. Other proteases such as MT1-MMP
  and uPA are upregulated by NE as well, also leading to pro-tumor effects which can
  be mitigated by CMT-3 [,]. EP and Iso have been shown to upregulate VEGF expression
  as well [].
