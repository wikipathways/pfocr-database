caption: 'The DEGs and DEMs involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway in
  response to cold stress. The blue pattern represents the metabolites or genes that
  changed under CK, TH-0%, and TH-75% groups. The rectangle is divided into three
  equal parts (the left of the rectangle represents DEGs or DEMs in CK, the middle
  of the rectangle represents DEGs or DEMs in TH-0%, and the right of the rectangle
  represents DEGs or DEMs in TH-75%). The color in the rectangle indicates that the
  genes or metabolites were regulated (red indicates upregulation and blue indicates
  downregulation). AtBG1: beta-glucosidase; PAL: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; CCR:
  cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; PX: peroxidase; HCT: shikimate O-hydroxy cinnamoyl transferase;
  TOGT1: scopoletin glucosyltransferase; F6H: feruloyl-CoA 6-hydroxylase; CSE: caffeoyl
  shikimate esterase; 5BST: 5-O-(4-coumaroyl)-D-quinate 3′-monooxygenase; CAD: cinnamyl-alcohol
  dehydrogenase; and COMT: caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase.'
