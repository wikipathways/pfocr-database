caption: 'A possible model for humidifier disinfectant‐associated lung injury (HDLI)
  and interactome network comparisons with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and
  rats exposed to polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG). (A) PHMG‐containing humidifier
  disinfectant may induce cellular stress in immune cells, activating the TGF‐β/SMAD‐independent
  pathway in adults with HDLI and integrin signaling in children, respectively. However,
  pathways in children and adults may be partially cross‐linked, leading to activation
  of extracellular matrix (ECM)‐related genes, which induces fibrosis via ECM remodeling.
  In the case of TGF‐β/SMAD signaling in adults with HDLI, pre‐exposure to toxic materials
  in the environment in adults may have already promoted the activation of TGF‐β/SMAD
  signaling, a key pathway in lung fibrosis. If so, exposure to toxic PHMG may further
  stimulate the TGF‐β/SMAD pathway as previously demonstrated in a mouse model [Inhal
  Toxicol. 2020; 32: 419‐430]. By contrast, several potential pathways were predicted
  in children with HDLI (Table ). Increased expression of integrin, a potential activator
  of MMPs, is associated with lung fibrosis in young mice including in a bleomycin‐induced
  animal model [Transl Res. 2015; 166: 554‐567], suggesting that the integrin signaling
  pathway might be the most prominent pathway in children with HDLI. See additional
  online references. (B) Enriched pathways resulting from interactome network analysis
  of HDLI and IPF. All pathways were predicted from genes significantly interacting
  with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to HDLI or IPF. (C) Enriched
  pathways resulting from interactome network analysis of rats exposed to PHMG. Pathway
  analysis performed in humans with HDLI and IPF was carried out for genes significantly
  interacting with the DEGs in the lung tissues of rats exposed to PHMG'
