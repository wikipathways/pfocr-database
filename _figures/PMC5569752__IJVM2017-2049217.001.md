caption: ER stress-mediated apoptosis and inflammation in cardiovascular disease.
  When prolonged ER stress occurs, activation of CHOP-mediated and JNK/p38 MAPK-mediated
  apoptosis signaling pathways regulate the Bcl-2 family, which controls the balance
  of pro-/antiapoptotic signaling, and ER stress-induced apoptosis signaling dampens
  eNOS expression with the increased oxidative stress. The IRE1α/TRAF2/ASK1 complex
  also activates caspase-12 and ultimately induces cell apoptosis. Furthermore, ER
  stress-mediated NF-κB-IKK activates NLRP3 inflammasome and mediates eNOS activity.
  Excessive ER stress and activation of the IRE1α/TRAF2/ASK1 pathway increase TXNIP
  activation that subsequently induces NLRP3 inflammasome and reduced eNOS activity.
  The IRE1α/TRAF2/ASK1 complex also contributes to the expression of proinflammations
  that stimulate NLRP3 inflammasome-induced caspase-1 and IL-1β and UPR-mediated IL-6.
  ER stress also activates IL-8, MCP-1, and TNF-α expression. Ultimately, the accumulation
  of ER stress-mediated apoptotic and inflammatory responses decreases the eNOS activity
  which diminishes NO bioavailability and causes vascular dysfunction. The yellow
  arrows represent ER stress-mediated pathway.
