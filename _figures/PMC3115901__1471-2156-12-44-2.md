caption: Schematic outline of the ceramide/sphingosine-1-phosphate rheostat. Single
  arrows indicate irreversible processes, i.e. no enzymatic activities have been detected
  that reverses the metabolic pathway depicted by the arrows. Of particular interest
  is the degradation of sphingosine-1-phosphate to hexadcanal and phophoethanolamine
  which is a sink for sphingosine-1-phosphate irreversibly terminating its signalling
  activity.
