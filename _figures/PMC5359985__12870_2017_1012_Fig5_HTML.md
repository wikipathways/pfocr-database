caption: Schematic representation of phenylpropanoid/flavonoid pathway as affected
  by the chlorosis mutation. Red and green font indicate up- and down-regulated genes,
  respectively, in the chlorotic leaves compared to shaded plants. Significantly changed
  metabolites are shown with a barplot (E and G indicate chlorotic and green leaves,
  respectively) while compounds that were not identified in this study are shown in
  gray font. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4Cl,
  4-coumarate--CoA ligase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase; F3′5′H,
  flavonoid 3′, 5′-hydroxylase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-monooxygenase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase;
  ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase
