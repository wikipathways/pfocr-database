caption: Exchange of Fe between apoplasmic and symplasmic compartments in Arabidopsis.
  Root Fe is translocated to shoots through the xylem as FeIII-citrate complexes by
  bulk flow. FeIII can be reduced by light, extracellular AsA, and PM-bound ferric
  reductases of the FRO family. AtFRO6 and AtIRT3 are likely candidates to mediate
  Fe reduction and uptake in Arabidopsis shoots in both sink and source cells. In
  the cytoplasm, highly reactive FeII is complexed by NA. In the apoplasm, FeII is
  oxidized to FeIII and chelated by citrate. The formation of Fe-NA complexes in the
  apoplasm may occur to some extent. Apoplasmic Fe-NA can be taken up by PM-localized
  YSL transporters. In the cytoplasm, the prevalent Fe form is Fe-NA, which can readily
  circulate through the symplasmic path. Fe-NA moves from cell-to-cell through plasmodesmata
  passively by bulk flow. In the phloem, Fe is presumably mainly present as Fe-NA.
  In sink organs, Fe-NA can exit the phloem via plasmodesmata, or diffuse out of sieve
  elements into the apoplasm. In the latter scenario, Fe is retrieved by YSLs or by
  AtOPT3. Iron derived both from the apoplasm and from the symplasmic pathway constitutes
  the intracellular Fe pool. Plants possess yet unknown sensing and signaling mechanisms
  to regulate the size of this pool. AtOPT3 has been also suggested to transport signaling
  molecules that could circulate from the shoot to the root through the phloem, thereby
  negatively regulating root Fe uptake. AsA, ascorbic acid; Cit, citrate; FRO, Ferric
  Reductase Oxidase; IRT, Iron-Regulated Transporter; NA, nicotianamine; OPT, OligoPeptide
  Transporter; YSL, Yellow Stripe-Like; PM, plasma membrane.
