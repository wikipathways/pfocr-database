caption: Schematic illustration of albumin nanoparticles preparation and their targeted
  delivery to breast cancer cells and metastatic lymph node. (a). The synthesis process
  of BSA-CYC-DOX NPs and BSA NPs. (b). The dual-drug-loaded NPs were delivered to
  breast cancer via the active targeting mediated by BSA-binding proteins gp60 and
  SPARC. CYC increased DOX accumulation by inhibiting HH signaling pathway and reducing
  P-gp expression. BSA-CYC-DOX NPs were drained into the metastatic lymph node through
  lymphatic vessels and retained in macrophages.
