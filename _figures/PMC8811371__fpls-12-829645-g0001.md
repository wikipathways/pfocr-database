caption: 'Protein kinase-mediated signaling pathways in plant hosts. (A) Receptor
  kinases associated with resistance against C. higginsianum in Arabidopsis. Perception
  of microbe-/damage-associated molecular patterns (MAPMs/DAMPs) by cognate receptors
  (MAMP receptors, PEPR1/2) leads to the association of co-receptors (BAK1, SERK)
  and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs, BIK1), and transphosphorylation within
  the complex. The phosphorylated BIK1 dissociates from the complex and phosphorylates
  RBOHD, triggering the production of ROS. Pathogen delivers the effector protein
  (NIS1) that inhibits the kinase activity of BAK1 and BIK1 and blocks the interaction
  of BIK1-RBOHD. BAK1 contributes to invasion resistance and is targeted by unknown
  effector(s) for degradation. BAK1 depletion results in increased release of PROPEP-derived
  DMAPs, activating the PEPR-mediated pathway that is required for post-invasion resistance.
  (B) MAPK-mediated defense responses in N. benthamiana and apple. Left: in N. benthamiana,
  pathogen recognition leads to activation of NtMEK2 by unidentified MAP3K(s). Activated
  NtMEK2 phosphorylates and activates downstream NtSIPK, NtNTF4, and NtWIPK, which
  interact with and phosphorylate transcription factor NtWRKY8. NtWRKY8 binds to the
  promoter of its target genes-related to resistance against C. orbiculare. Right:
  in apple, the MdMEK4-MdMPK3 cascade phosphorylates MdWRKY17 in response to C. fructicola.
  The phosphorylation of MdWRKY17 increases its binding to the promoter of MdDMR6,
  which promotes SA degradation and increases susceptibility to C. fructicola.'
