caption: (A) Parallel pathways for the replication checkpoint-dependent transcriptional
  regulation in budding yeast. Upon replication stress, Rad53 induces the expression
  of DDR genes via Dun1/Crt1 pathway and de-represses transcription of MBF-dependent
  targets required for replication stress response. (B) Regulation of TOS4 as a prototypical
  example of SBF-to-MBF subunit switch. TOS4 transcription is regulated via subunit
  switching and replication checkpoint signalling. During G1, SBF binds to TOS4 promoter
  and activates transcription. Upon entry into S phase, SBF dissociates from the TOS4
  promoter in a Clb/CDK1-dependent manner leaving TOS4 promoter available for binding
  of MBF and its co-repressor Nrm1. In response to replication stress, Nrm1 dissociates
  from MBF in response to replication checkpoint activation leading to transcriptional
  de-repression of TOS4. (C) Proposed importance of SBF-to-MBF subunit switching.
  The SBF/MBF switch on G1/S promoters provides a fail-safe mechanism that prevents
  loss of periodicity and hyperaccumulation of dosage-sensitive genes during G1 in
  case of MBF loss of function. (*) Indicate loss of periodicity in case of MBF ‘malfunction'.
