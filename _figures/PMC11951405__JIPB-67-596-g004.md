  conditions, root‐derived CEP1 peptides are transported via the xylem to shoots,
  where they bind to XIP1/CEPR1 and CEPR2 receptors, initiating a descending signal
  that induces CEPD1 and CEPD2 polypeptides (glutaredoxin family). These CEPD peptides
  travel through the phloem back to roots, upregulating NRT2.1 and NRT1.5 to enhance
  nitrogen uptake. Concurrently, N starvation upregulates CLE peptides (CLE1/3/4/5/7)
  in root pericycle cells. These CLE peptides bind to CLAVATA1‐like receptors, inhibiting
  LR development. Additionally, N deficiency induces CLE2 expression in roots, with
  CLE2 peptides translocating to leaves to facilitate sucrose transport to roots,
  promoting primary root growth and further N uptake. Together, these pathways modulate
  N acquisition and root architecture for adaptation to N‐deficient conditions. (B‐C)

  description: Plant small peptides (SPs) mediate nutritional deficiency responses
    (A) Signaling pathways mediated by CEP and CLE peptides in response to N deficiency.
    Under N‐deficient conditions, root‐derived CEP1 peptides are transported via the

    a descending signal that induces CEPD1 and CEPD2 polypeptides (glutaredoxin family).
    These CEPD peptides travel through the phloem back to roots, upregulating NRT2.1
