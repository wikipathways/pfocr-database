caption: '(Ai-Av) In red: the rod bipolar (RB) pathway of mammalian retina. Rods make
  synapses onto RBs (Ai), which make synapses onto the AII. Signaling from AIIs to
  ON and OFF pathways is compartmentalized by the morphology of the AII, a bistratified
  cell with distinct neurites in the ON and OFF sublaminae of the inner plexiform
  layer (IPL). (Aii). Proximal (OFF-layer) dendrites provide glycinergic synapses
  (Aiii) onto the terminals of some OFF cone bipolar (CB) cells [primarily type 2
  CBs; ()] and onto the dendrites of some OFF ganglion cells (GCs), including OFF
  α and δ GCs as well as suppressed-by-contrast GCs (; ; ). At their distal (ON-layer)
  dendrites, AIIs are coupled by electrical synapses to the terminals of ON CBs (Aiv)
  (particularly type 6 CBs presynaptic to ON α GCs); depolarization of AIIs drives
  excitatory transmission to GCs, including ON α GCs () (Av). Thus, the AII mediates
  so-called ‘cross-over’ inhibition, whereby one pathway (ON, in this case) suppresses
  the other (OFF) and thereby decorrelates their outputs (). (Bi-Bvi) In blue: rods
  are coupled electrically to cones by gap junctions (Bi), and cones make synapses
  onto ON and OFF CBs (Bii). Depolarization of the ON CB by the cone not only drives
  glutamatergic transmission to ON GCs (Biii), it also depolarizes AIIs via the electrical
  synapses (Biv) and thereby elicits glycinergic transmission to OFF GCs and perhaps
  OFF CBs (Bv). (Ci-Cii) In green: rods make direct chemical synapses onto some types
  of OFF CB (Ci), which in turn contact OFF GCs (Cii).'
