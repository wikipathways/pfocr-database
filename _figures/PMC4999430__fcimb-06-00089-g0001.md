caption: Interplay between EPEC/EHEC and inflammasome. Host cells detect and respond
  to the cellular disturbance from the T3SS-dependent infection of EPEC and EHEC.
  The sensing of bacterial presence begins when PRRs on the cell membrane recognize
  PAMPs (for example. LPS by TLR4). This engagement initiates the activation of NF-κB
  signaling and allows the production of inflammasomal components, including NLRP3
  and Pro-IL-1β. Moreover, the detection of PAMPs also triggers the deubiquitination
  of NLRP3, readying for the sensor protein to assemble the signature complex of NLRP3/ASC/Caspase-1.
  In the case of NLRP3, the complex formation also requires a secondary stimuli from
  the infection (for example, the disruption of membrane integrity by Ehx-toxin or
  the presence of bacterial-derived DNA:RNA hybrids). NLRC4 initiates the complex
  assembly after Naip proteins binds to respective ligands. Ultimately, pro-IL-1β
  is processed to a secretion-competent form. EPEC and EHEC use multiple effectors
  to interfer NF-κB and inflammasome pathways. Currently, only a limited numbers of
  effectors known to directly target components of the inflammasome complex; they
  are NleA, NleB, and NleF. NleA directly interacts with NLRP3 to interrupt ubiquitin
  modification of NLRP3; NleB may negatively influence FADD/Caspase-8, which enhances
  NLRP3-inflammasome activity; NleF may potentially disrupt NLRP3-inflammasome by
  inhibiting Caspase-4 and Caspase-8.
