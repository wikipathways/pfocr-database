caption: Future therapeutic strategies are based on adaptive NK cells. (A) When the
  CD16 pathway is activated by Abs or NKCEs binding to different targets, adaptive
  NK cells secrete numerous IFN-γ and TNF-α to regulate anti-tumor immunity; (B) Methods
  to significantly improve the efficiency of ADCC can be considered from two aspects
  of adaptive NK cells and target cells, such as avoiding CD16 on the surface of adaptive
  NK cells being cleaved by ADAM17 or MMP, enhancing its binding with Fc segment in
  a high-affinity manner, and advancing Ag presentation to the surface of tumor cells
  to reduce endocytosis; (C) Adding 4-1BB/CD28 and CD3ζ co-stimulatory signals to
  adaptive NK cells, or blocking the co-inhibitory pathway with the antagonistic Ab
  EOS-448 of TIGIT, and stimulating the co-activation pathway of CD2, NKG2C, and 4-1BB
  with agonist are all effective means to strengthen adaptive NK cell function; (D)
  Up-regulation of ARID5B expressed in adaptive NK cells can alter its metabolic characteristics,
  resulting in longer persistence and increased function. NKCEs, NK cell engagers;
  ADCC, Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; ADAM17, A disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17;
  and MMP, Matrix Metalloproteinase.
