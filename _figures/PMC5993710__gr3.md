caption: 'Schematic overview on carbohydrate and protein degradation pathways based
  on enzymes predicted from the P. saccharofermentans str. M3/6T genome sequence.
  Intracellular and extracellular reactions are separated by the cell envelope. Names
  in blue denote the hemicellulose polysaccharides. The following intracellular metabolic
  pathways are shown: glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, central pyruvate metabolism
  and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Arrows symbolize enzymatic reactions. Crossed
  red arrows mark enzymatic reactions for which corresponding enzymes were not predicted
  in the P. saccharofermentans str. M3/6T genome. Green metabolites represent fermentation
  pathway end-products (acetate, propionate, isovalerate, formate, and molecular hydrogen).
  Abbreviations: Asp, aspartic acid; Gln, glutamine; His, histidine; Ile, isoleucine;
  Leu, leucine; Thr, threonine; Val, valine; OPT, Oligopeptide Transporter Family
  proteins; ABC, ABC transporter; SSS, Solute-Sodium Symporter Family proteins; MFS,
  Major Facilitator Superfamily proteins; NP, no prediction.'
