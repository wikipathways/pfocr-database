caption: PKR activation model of RAN translation. Schematic diagram depicting chronic
  activation of PKR by repeat expansion RNAs increases RAN translation. Blocking the
  PKR pathway with PKR-K296R, metformin, or TRBP reduces RAN protein levels to a greater
  extent than blocking p-eIF2α with ISRIB. These results suggest PKR regulates RAN
  protein levels through both p-eIF2α–dependent and p-eIF2α–independent pathways.
  The accumulation of misfolded or aggregated RAN proteins may, in turn, activate
  the PERK pathway and exacerbate disease by leading to further eIF2α phosphorylation
  and a cycle of increased RAN protein production.
