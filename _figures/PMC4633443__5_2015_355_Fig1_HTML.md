caption: The inflammasome axis. The NLRP3 inflammasome is composed of NLRP3, ASC,
  and procaspase-1. Production of these proteins is regulated by NF-κB transcriptional
  factor, which in turn is stimulated by the activation of the TLR4 receptor. Please
  note that various factors associated with bacterial colonization act as ligands
  of this receptor. The interaction between the PYD and CARD domains (1 and 2) within
  the inflammasome leads to caspase-1 activation and cleavage of IL-1β precursor to
  produce an active form of IL-1β (3)
