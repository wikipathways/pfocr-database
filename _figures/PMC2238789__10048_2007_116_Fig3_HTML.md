caption: 'Hypothetical ‘super pathway’ not stratified for cell type illustrating known
  direct interactions between the 892 PD priority genes (regulation, expression and
  promoter binding only). A total of 417 interactions (relations) are shown and any
  unlinked entities were removed. Display style: by effect; cellular layout; colour
  codes: promoter binding, violet; green, positive regulation; red, negative regulation;
  grey and/or broken lines, unknown (Resnet 5.0 database, unedited). Blue shading
  around selected genes indicates their involvement in the cellular process and disease
  conditions depicted in Fig. a and b, respectively. Permutations of this figure with
  hyperlinks are provided online as SI_Figures_4a-c'
