caption: Contribution of endogenous H2O2 elevation in CVP neurons to ventricular arrhythmogenesis
  and related therapeutic strategy in T2DM. In the T2DM state, the oxidative stress,
  as evidenced by endogenous H2O2 elevation and lowered catalase occurred in CVP neurons.
  Consequently, endogenous H2O2 elevation reduced the neuronal excitability through
  reduction of the N-type Ca2+ channel expression and activation. H2O2 overproduction
  in CVP neurons further attenuated the cardiac vagal activation and enhanced the
  susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmogenesis, including the inducibility of ventricular
  arrhythmias in anesthetized rats and MI-evoked ventricular arrhythmias in conscious
  rats. Reduction of cytosolic H2O2 levels in the AVG through in vivo Ad.CAT gene
  transfection markedly increased T2DM-reduced expression and activation of N-type
  Ca2+ channels, intracellular Ca2+ levels, and cell excitability of CVP neurons.
  Ad.CAT gene transfection subsequently improved impaired cardiac vagal function and
  suppressed ventricular arrhythmogenesis in T2DM. Therefore, targeting H2O2-N-type
  Ca2+ channel signaling pathway could be a potential therapeutic strategy to improve
  the withdrawal of cardiac vagal activation and suppress ventricular arrhythmias
  in T2DM patients with MI.
