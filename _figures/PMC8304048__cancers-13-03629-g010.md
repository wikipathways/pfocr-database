caption: Hypothesis of galectin-9 truncation in modulating its function. Truncating
  the linker peptide by splicing exons 5 and/or 6 can modulate the distance at which
  the divalent lectin is able to link two specific sites. C-CRD truncation (splicing
  of exon 10) may alter the specificity of oligosugars. The protein variant X5 appears
  to be a monovalent lectin and can either label sites with specific ligands for further
  interactions or, conversely, block them before they can interact with divalent lectins,
  thereby preventing efficient cross-linking.
