caption: Biosynthetic pathway of pheromones in D. melanogaster flies of different
  genotypes. The two genes desat1 and desat2 code for two desaturases with different
  substrate specificity (palmitate and myristate, respectively) that introduce a first
  double bond on the carbon ω7 (desat1) or on the carbon ω5 (desat2; adapted from
  ). Hypothetically, the second double bond (on carbon ω11 for Cs females and on carbon
  ω9 for Tai females) could be processed by the same Desat enzyme on mono-unsaturated
  precursors (C20:1 for desat1 and C18:1 for desat2). Subsequently, saturated and
  unsaturated fatty acid precursors are processed by several elongation steps coupled
  with a final decarboxylation step (not shown here), leading to the production of
  mature cuticular hydrocarbons. The desat2 gene, which normally induces the production
  of 5,9 dienes in Tai-like females, is defective in Cs flies, leading to the predominant
  production of 7,11 dienes and of 7-monoenes by females and males, respectively.
  The desat11573-1 mutation largely reduces the levels of these unsaturated hydrocarbons
  and largely increases the levels of n-alkanes in homozygous mutant flies (1573-1).
  The solid and the shaded arrows represent the desaturation and the elongation steps,
  respectively (the number of shaded arrows is not indicative of the number of elongation
  reactions).
