caption: A model of the agr-sarT-sarU pathway for regulating the expression of virulence
  genes in S. aureus. SarA is synthesized during the exponential phase based on differential
  activation of three sarA promoters (sarA P2, P3, and P1). SarR and SigB can down-regulate
  SarA expression, and other factors may up-regulate it. The basal level of RNAII
  expression, in part in response to SarA, would lead to synthesis of the AIP. Upon
  bacterial accumulation, the AIP would activate RNAIII transcription via a quorum-sensing
  mechanism. Besides the quorum-sensing pathway, we also propose that RNAIII activation
  would lead to repression of SarT. SarT repression would result in elevated sarU
  and decreased sarS expression; Rot protein acts as a repressor for hla expression
  (27). As SarU is an activator of RNAIII synthesis, this would provide a secondary
  amplification of the original agr signal. Accordingly, this model predicts a reduction
  in RNAIII promoter activity in a sarU mutant as well as decreased sarU promoter
  activity in an agr mutant compared to activities in the parental strain.
