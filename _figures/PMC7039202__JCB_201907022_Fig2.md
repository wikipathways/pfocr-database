caption: Sources of one-carbon units. Routes of entry of one-carbon units from the
  catabolism of amino acids, from metabolic pathways that detoxify secondary toxic
  byproducts and from those that prevent degradation of folate species. Toxic byproducts
  are colored in red. Degraded folate species are colored in green. The asterisk and
  orange color denote mouse enzyme with function not conserved in humans.
