caption: The regulation of KRAS activation and signal transduction. The canonical
  and well-known pattern of activating KRAS is dependent on correct membrane localisation
  and adjacent activation of membrane receptors. In the resting state, KRAS normally
  binds with GDP in an inactivated state. When the extracellular growth factors such
  as EGF transmit signals to receptors, the SOS, a kind of GEF, interacts with the
  KRAS-GDP complex leading to the release of GDP and the replacement of GTP. The tether
  of GTP and KRAS induces structural changes of switch I and switch II, thereby activating
  KRAS. In contrast, GAPs enhance intrinsic GTPase activity in KRAS to accelerate
  the reaction in which GTP is hydrolysed to GDP. The KRAS cycle between the activated
  and inactivated conformations functions as a finely regulated molecular switch that
  controls multiple signalling cascades, including the canonical RAF-MEK-ERK pathway,
  which controls proliferation; PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which promotes cell survival;
  and other signalling pathways, which are required for KRAS-dependent tumour growth
  and endocytosis, and cytoskeletal organisation
