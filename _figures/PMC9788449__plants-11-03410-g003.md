caption: Schematic representation of PIF4-mediated thermomorphogenesis through the
  regulation of the auxin signaling pathway in plants. Warm temperatures promote PIF4
  transcription and protein stability through multiple regulatory mechanisms. PIF4
  further positively regulates the auxin response, which promotes thermomorphogenesis
  in response to moderately elevated ambient temperatures.
