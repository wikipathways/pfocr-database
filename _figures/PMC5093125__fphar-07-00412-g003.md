caption: Schematic overview of the generation of C18:0 ceramide and the supposed effect
  of IFN-β. Ceramides are produced de novo by serine and palmitoyl-CoA or by “salvage”
  pathways, with recycling of sphingomyelin or sphingosine-1-phosphate. IFN-β increased
  e.g., C18:0 ceramide and sphinganine-1-phosphate (with a C18-backbone) as indicated
  by the arrows in brackets. Accordingly, the de novo synthesis and/or the “salvage”
  pathway may be activated by IFN-β therapy as indicated by bold arrows.
