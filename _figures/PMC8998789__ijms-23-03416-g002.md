caption: mTOR signaling in PCOS-induced endometrial hyperplasia Glucose metabolism
  in the uterus is of essential importance for normal endometrial function. Hyperinsulinemia
  and insulin resistance are major disorders involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS
  and are believed to contribute to the development of EH in women with this condition.
  (1) Normally, S6K1 phosphorylates IRS1, thereby preventing the association of IRS1
  with the insulin receptor. This negative feedback mechanism desensitizes and protects
  the cell from further insulin stimulation. When mTORC1 is chronically activated,
  for example, due to excessive glucose consumption, the sustained downstream stimulation
  of S6K1 increases IRS1 phosphorylation. This decreases its responsiveness to insulin,
  thus rendering the cell insulin resistant []. (2) mTORC2 influences insulin sensitivity
  by impairing IRS1 and AKT function. (3) GLUT-4 expression and translocation to the
  plasma membrane are enhanced by AMPK and AKT, respectively [,]. (4) High androgen
  levels in PCOS restrain apoptosis and increase the proliferative potential of endometrial
  cells by stimulating mTOR signaling via AMPK inactivation. (5) Metformin restrains
  EH by suppressing the mTOR pathway through AMPK stimulation. It has also been shown
  that metformin increases GLUT-4 and decreases AR levels in the endometrium, probably
  via the mTOR pathway []. IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IRS1, insulin receptor
