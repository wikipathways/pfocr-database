caption: 'Potential regulatory manner of RP105 in activating osteoclastogenesis of
  bone marrow macrophages. RP105 promotes the differentiation of bone marrow macrophages
  into osteoclasts with different “signaling-competent” partners. As a result, there’re
  three potentially regulate manner of RP105 in the differentiation process: (1) TLR2
  works as a “signaling-competent” of RP105 () and forms RP105/TLR2/Btk axis to up-regulate
  PI3K p110δ to activate the PI3K-Akt as well as promotes production of TNF and activation
  of NF-κB pathways (; ); (2) Pim-1L works another “signaling-competent” of RP105
  () and stimulate expression of NFATc1 through JAK/STAT pathway () and activate Akt
  to promote PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (); (3) RP105 also could inhibit TLR7 and
  TLR9 signaling and the downstream Lyn/SHP-1/2 manner, which activate Ca2+signaling
  pathway and promote cell-cell fusion (). Figure was created using BioRender.com.'
