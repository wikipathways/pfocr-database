caption: Selenite reconfigures primary metabolism in root tissue of B. napus. A schematic
  diagram illustrates the global effects of selenite treatment on metabolism after
  day 3. Each box represents the fold-change in metabolite abundance in selenite-treated
  roots relative to untreated roots. Dotted lines represent more than one enzymatic
  step. Relative differences in enzymatic activity from selenite-treated roots are
  italicized.
