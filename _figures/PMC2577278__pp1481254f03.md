caption: Biosynthetic pathways for terpene-derived natural products found in hop trichomes,
  showing EST abundance in the hop glandular trichome cDNA library. A, The MEP pathway
  leading to DMAPP biosynthesis. B, General reactions of mono- and sesquiterpene biosynthesis.
  C, Prenylflavonoid and bitter acid biosynthesis. Chemical structures of selected
  compounds are shown. The abundance of ESTs corresponding to each biosynthetic gene
  in the hop glandular trichome cDNA library is indicated in parentheses. DXPS, 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose-5-P
  synthase; DXR, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-P reductoisomerase; MCT, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-P
  cytidylyltransferase; CMK, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase; MCS,
  2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; HDS, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate
  synthase; HDR, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate reductase; IPPI, isopentenyl
  diphosphate/dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase; OMT, O-methyltransferase; PT, prenyltransferase.
  Numbers in parentheses represent the number of occurrences of an EST corresponding
  to the particular enzyme in the 9,816 cleansed hop ESTs.
