caption: Schematic of the relationship between BCAA/BCKA catabolism and regulation
  of glucose transport in myotubes. In the first panel, a simplified insulin signalling
  pathway is shown. In the second panel, with KIC supplementation, KIC is converted
  back to leucine by BCAT2, which then activates mTORC1/S6K1, leading to the phosphorylation
  of IRS-1Ser612 and thus hindering IRS-1 signalling downstream. In the third panel,
  with BDK depletion or BT2 treatment, BCKD activity is increased leading to reduced
  leucine levels, and corresponding attenuation of mTORC1 activation and rescuing
  of insulin-stimulated glucose transport
