caption: 'Coagulation cascade: targets for antithrombotic intervention.Notes: Coagulation
  is initiated when the injured endothelium releases tissue factor, which activates
  the extrinsic pathway. Amplification, key to the coagulation cascade, is triggered
  by intrinsic coagulation pathway factors that are activated by tissue factor-VIIa
  in a positive feedback loop. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways converge at the
  level of factor X activation, which activates the final common pathway. In turn,
  factor Xa combines with factor Va, calcium, and platelet phospholipids to form prothrombinase
  complex, which activates prothrombin to thrombin, the final enzyme in the process
  that converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Warfarin inhibits synthesis of the active forms
  of four vitamin K-dependent procoagulant proteins, ie, factors II (prothrombin),
  VII, IX, and X, as well as two anticoagulant proteins, C and S. LMWHs are derived
  from unfractionated heparin by depolymerization, which forms fragments approximately
  one third the size of unfractionated heparin. The smaller LMWH fragments still contain
  the parent compound’s essential antithrombin III-binding pentasaccharide sequence
  and thus can catalyze factor Xa inactivation. Precluded by their smaller fragment
  chain length from simultaneously bridging antithrombin III and thrombin, which is
  required for thrombin IIa inactivation, most LMWH agents demonstrate high anti-Xa
  activity and minimal anti-IIa activity. Factor Xa inhibitors are synthetic analogs
  of the pentasaccharide sequence that binds with high affinity to antithrombin III.
  These agents catalyze inactivation of factor Xa, thus decreasing thrombin generation.
  DTIs bind directly to the active site of thrombin and block interaction with its
  substrate, fibrinogen. In contrast with LMWH, DTIs inactivate clot-bound thrombin,
  which promotes thrombus growth and circulating thrombin.Abbreviations: H, heparin;
