caption: A model for the suggested pathways of astaxanthin inhibiting lung diseases
  by activating the Nrf2–HO1 pathway. Astaxanthin phosphorylates AMPK, which then
  phosphorylates Nrf2 at the Ser550 residue, accompanied by GSK3β inhibition, leading
  to nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 for the transactivation of ARE-driven genes, including
  HO-1. These changes result in inhibited oxidative damage and alleviated COPD, emphysema,
  and lung fibrosis. AMPK, 5′-AMP–activated protein kinase; ARE, antioxidant response
  element; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase
  3β; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; Keap1, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; Nrf2, nuclear
  factor erythroid 2–related factor 2.
