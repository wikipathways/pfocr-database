caption: Schematic Diagram Illustrating the Inhibitory Effect of Melatonin on Neuronal
  Damage and Brain Injury by PI3K/AKT Activation via PTEN Activity Suppression After
  Stroke. Ischemic stroke results in PTEN dephosphorylation and triggers the activation
  of PTEN. Activated PTEN subsequently converts phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-triphosphate
  (PIP3) to phosphatidyl (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2), leading to the inactivation of
  pro-survival Akt pathway followed by neuronal toxicity. In the presence of melatonin,
  the PTEN activity is reversed, thereby leading to the convert of PIP2 to PIP3 catalyzed
  by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Thus, the activation of Akt is increased.
  Activated Akt inhibits neuronal apoptosis and promotes cell survival after stroke.
