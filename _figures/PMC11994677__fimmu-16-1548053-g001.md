caption: Crosstalk between KTRM and renal cellular networks. KTRMs bind to extracellular
  matrix proteins of tubular epithelial cells via integrin heterodimers α9β1 and α5β1,
  monitoring and clearing urinary particles. They also establish contacts with peritubular
  endothelial cells to monitor and phagocytose circulating immune complexes; when
  these complexes contain nucleic acids, KTRMs can be activated via the TLR-Myd88
  pathway. Additionally, in heart failure, collecting duct epithelial cells induced
  by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) express S100A8 and S100A9, which promote
  KTRM activation to produce TNF-α. TNF-α induces renal endothelial cells to generate
  CSF2, promoting KTRM proliferation. This cardiorenal regulatory network helps maintain
  homeostasis. KTRMs can also establish connections with other immune cells in the
  kidney. KTRMs produce IL-15, which activates the IL-15/IL-15R/STAT3 signaling pathway
  in tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells, inducing their proliferation and activation,
  thereby exacerbating lupus nephritis (LN). Tissue-resident Tregs regulate the M2
  phenotypic shift of KTRMs to prevent inflammation spread and promote repair. KTRMs
  also secrete IL-10 to stimulate the differentiation of regulatory T cells. Moreover,
  the predominant B-1a subpopulation of kidney tissue-resident B cells increases the
  expression of OXPHOS pathway genes in KTRMs via IL-10 production, promoting their
  transition to an M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype and inhibiting the production of
  monocyte-recruiting chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4) by KTRMs
