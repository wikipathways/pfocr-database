caption: MicroRNA (miR)-21 in hypoxic oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-derived
  exosomes is significantly upregulated under hypoxic conditions, and the hypoxic
  microenvironment stimulates tumour cells to generate miR-21-rich exosomes to be
  delivered to normoxic cells to promote prometastatic behaviors. On the other hand,
  exosomes containing miR-21 target phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and programmed
  cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), exhibit cisplatin resistance in OSCC. Moreover, miR-200c-3p
  in exosomes derived from a highly invasive OSCC line can induce a similar phenotype
  in non-invasive counterparts to promote OSCC invasion. The expression of proteasome
  subunit α type 7 (PSMA7) in salivary exosomes in patients with inflammatory bowel
  disease (IBD) showed significant differences between patients with IBD and healthy
  controls. During aging, miR-24-3p was identified as a novel candidate biomarker
  of aging, which could affect the MAPK signaling pathway to increase susceptibility
  to age-dependent alterations in the immune and inflammatory status, or it could
  induce apoptosis of salivary glands during aging, decreasing the production of saliva.
