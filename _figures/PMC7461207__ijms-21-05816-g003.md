caption: 'Mechanotransduction signalling for osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem
  cells (hMSCs). (A) VEGF signalling pathway: VEGF is produced and released into extracellular
  fluid to bind to its receptor and activate the ERK 1/2-RUNX2 signalling pathway.
  (B) ERK 1/2-RUNX2 pathway: a common pathway shared by many types of mechanical loading
  to induce osteogenesis. (C) Dynamic stretching increases the production of long
  non-coding RNA H19 (lncRNAH19) to inhibit the function of miR-138 in blocking the
  FAK-ERK 1/2-RUNX2 signalling pathway. (D) Notch signalling pathway: dynamic stretching
  enhances the production and release of JAG1 into extracellular fluid, which binds
  to the Notch receptor to inhibit the role of HDAC1 in blocking the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway involved in osteogenesis. (E) Through TRPV4 channel, perfusion activates
  calcineurin, which increases the nuclear translocation of NFATc1, which forms a
  complex with OSX to induce osteogenesis. (F) BMP-2 signalling pathway: BMP-2 is
  produced and released into extracellular fluid to bind to its receptor, which then
  enhances the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated Smad 1/5/8 for triggering osteogenesis.'
