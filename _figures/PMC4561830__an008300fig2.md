caption: 'Metabolic pathway of 10-formyl-H4folate formed from H4folate and [ring 2-carbon]histidine,
  [3-carbon]serine, [2-carbon]glycine, and formate. Key folate-metabolizing enzymes
  include the following: 1) formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase, 2) the glycine-cleavage
  system, 3) SHMT, and 4) 10-formyl-H4folate synthetase. 10-formyl-H4folate is incorporated
  into C2 and C8 of the purine ring by GAR and AICAR transformylases, respectively.
  AICAR, 5′-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide; GAR, 5′-phosphoribosyl-glycinamide;
  H4folate, tetrahydrofolate; SHMT, serine hydroxylmethyltransferase; 10-formyl-H4folate,
  10-formyltetrahydrofolate. Reproduced from reference  () with permission.'
