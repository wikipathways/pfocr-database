caption: 'SIK1 inhibits tumor cell EMT by suppressing β-catenin signaling pathway
  and the expression of Twist 1. (1) In hepatocellular carcinoma, SIK1 phosphorylates
  SMRT, which forms complex withβ-catenin thereby inhibiting Twist1-associated EMT.
  Twist 1 could also negatively control the expression of SIK1 by binding to the E-box
  motif of the SIK1 promoter. (2) In gastric adenocarcinoma, SIK1 prevents tumor cell
  EMT by inducing the cytosolic translocation of HDAC, which in turn reduces the activity
  of β-catenin signaling pathway and blocks the tumor metastasis. Dashed arrow: This
  process was identified in human Uterine Fibroid, which is waiting for further verification
  in gastric adenocarcinoma cells. SIKs, salt inducible kinases; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition; LKB1, liver kinase B1; SMRT, silencing mediator of retinoic acid and
  thyroid hormone receptor; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TBL1, transducing β-like protein
  1; TBLR1, TBL1-related protein; NCoR, nuclear receptor corepressor'
