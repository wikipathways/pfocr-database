caption: Cellular regulatory pathways involving PrPC protein in cancer. The PrPC protein
  is involved in different cellular tumorigenesis process, where its activities are
  regulated directly through protein–protein interactions or/and indirectly using
  different cellular regulatory pathways. P-gp; P-glycoprotein, GLUT-1; Glucose transporter-1;
  FLNA; Filamin A.
