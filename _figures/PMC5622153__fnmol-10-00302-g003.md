caption: Schematic of BACE1-dependent NRG1/ErbB4 signaling pathway involving in the
  pathogenies of schizophrenia. Neuregulins (type I, type III Nrg1 and Nrg3) are cleaved
  by BACE1 and release their EGF-domain into in the extracellular space, through binding
  the ErbB4 receptors to activate downstream signaling pathway. The NRG1/ErbB4 signaling
  in neurons can exert an effect on NMDA receptors interacting with PSD-95, which
  lead to the phosphorylation of PI3K-AKT and ERK molecules. Abnormal NRG1/ErbB4 signaling
  pathway may contribute to impaired myelination and synaptic function. Meanwhile,
  intracellular fragment of Nrg1 and ErbB4 are cut off by γ-secretase complex, producing
  the peptide into the nuclear to regulate neuron development.
