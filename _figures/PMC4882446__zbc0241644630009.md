caption: Model of capsular α-glucan regulation routes in M. tuberculosis. The model
  is based on our finding of capsular induction under Pi starvation and SHX-mediated
  amino acid stress as well as the current literature on stress signaling pathways
  in M. tuberculosis. Low Pi is sensed by the Pst system and downstream signaling
  via the SenX3-RegX3-MprAB-SigE pathway. SigE activates the SigE-dependent stress
  regulon, which ultimately induces the capsular α-glucan (green arrows). SigE signaling
  to RelMtb occurs in Pi starvation, but the capsular α-glucan is not elevated via
  a RelMtb-dependent manner (red arrow with cross). Mimicking amino acid starvation
  by SHX activates the stringent response via RelMtb-mediated induction of (p)ppGpp
  and up-regulates the capsule polysaccharide α-glucan (green arrows). Nutrient stress
  as seen in the stationary phase cultured M. tuberculosis leads to induced capsular
  α-glucan levels mediated by RelMtb and/or SigE (black arrows). SigE and RelMtb communicate
  via feedforward and feedback loops and therefore might influence each other in the
  capsular α-glucan production (black arrows with question mark). Furthermore, M.
  tuberculosis encounters in vivo various stress conditions, like carbon, iron, hypoxia,
  or other stresses (marked Other stresses) that might up-regulate capsular α-glucan
  in a similar way via SigE and/or RelMtb. TCS, two-component system; Poly-P, polyphosphate.
