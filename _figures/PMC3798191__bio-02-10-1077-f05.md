caption: Three intra-pathway feedback loops attenuate each pathway (RA stimulate cyp26a
  and FGF stimulates dusp6 while Notch represses dlc). In addition, the RA pathway
  either stimulates (through fgf8) or represses (through dusp6) the FGF pathway, the
  FGF pathway stimulates the Notch pathway (through dlc), and the Notch pathway represses
  the RA pathway (through cyp26a). (A) The Celf1 RNA-binding protein attenuates the
  Notch pathway by limiting the abundance of Rbpj protein through a post-transcriptional
  control. Notch signalling depends on FGF signalling through Dlc. (B) When the TP
  MO impairs the repressive interaction between Celf1 and rbpj mRNA, rbpj is overexpressed,
  which stimulates the Notch pathway. Consequently, the RA pathway is repressed (due
  to cyp26a overexpression) and the FGF pathway is repressed (due to fgf8 repression).
  FGF repression does not lead to Notch repression owing to rbpj overexpression, and
  relieving the repressive interaction between Celf1 protein and rbpj mRNA uncouples
  the Notch and RA pathways from the FGF pathway.
