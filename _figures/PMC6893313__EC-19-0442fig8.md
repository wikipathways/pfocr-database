caption: Representative model of the MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion induced by leptin in
  a cultured model for breast cancer. Leptin-dependent activation of FAK occurs via
  Src and an independent mechanism from the canonical ObR pathway. These kinases promote
  the secretion of MMPs, cell migration and invasion in cultured models for breast
  cancer cells.
