caption: A brief summary of the intracellular Hippo pathway in mammals. The core Hippo
  pathway in mammals is composed of evolutionarily conserved kinases, including the
  Mst1/2 (Hpo in Drosophila), Sav1 (Sav in Drosophila), and Lats1/2 (Wts in Drosophila)
  kinases. When Hippo signaling is active, this kinase cascade is sequentially phosphorylated
  as shown, eventually resulting in the phosphorylation of Yap and Taz to promote
  their interaction with 14-3-3 protein and their degradation in the cytoplasm. Without
  repression by Hippo signaling, Yap and Taz can shuttle into the nucleus and bind
  to transcription factors (e.g., Tead) to regulate the transcription of target genes
  involved in different physiologic processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation,
  and migration.
