caption: 'O-GlcNAc is involved in the cellular stress response. Glucose and glucosamine
  can enter cells via glucose transporters and are directed towards the HBP for conversion
  to UDP-GlcNAc. O-GlcNAcylation of key proteins is essential for maintaining cellular
  homeostasis and promoting survival during stress and injury. Key survival pathways
  modulated by O-GlcNAc include: (1) the PI3K/Akt pathway, (2) heat shock protein
  expression, (3) calcium homeostasis, (4) reactive oxygen species regulation, (5)
  mitochondrial dynamics, (6) inflammation, and (7) PTM interplay. Note that proteins
  are shown as light blue squares, O-GlcNAc as green circles, and phosphates as orange
  circles. Arrows denote activation, whereas blunt ends denote inhibition. OGA O-GlcNAcase,
  OGT O-GlcNAc transferase'
