caption: 'The process of protein ubiquitination and biological events mediated by
  some ubiquitination types. In the case of ATP supplying energy, E1 ubiquitin-activating
  enzyme activates ubiquitin molecules. E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme transfers the
  activated ubiquitin molecules to E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and the cysteine
  active site of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme forms thioester bonds with ubiquitin
  transferred by E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme. E3 ubiquitin ligase participates
  in the ubiquitination of substrate by forming an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl
  group of Gly76 of ubiquitin and the ε-amine of Lys in the substrate. Typical types
  of polyubiquitination are K48 (ubiquitin is linked to ubiquitin at lysine 48 residue
  to form the isopeptide-linked polyubiquitin chain) and K63 (lysine 63 residue).
  The former mainly performs the degradation of proteins in cells, while the latter
  has achievements in DNA damage repair, kinase activation, signal transduction, and
  so on. Atypical ubiquitin chains are K11 (lysine 11 residue) and linear ubiquitin
  chain (the N-terminus of the ubiquitin molecule is directly connected to the C-terminus
  of another ubiquitin molecule to form a peptide bond). OTUB2 can also cleave the
  K11 polyubiquitin chain, which may have a role in the regulation of cell division.
  In addition, the linear ubiquitin chain often plays an activating role in cellular
  pathways that regulate inflammatory responses and can be specifically cleaved by
  OTULIN. Note: Different colors of ubiquitin molecules in the figure represent different
  types of ubiquitination.'
