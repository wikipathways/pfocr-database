caption: New therapeutic targets arise from metabolic reprogramming in RCC. Novel
  targets for therapeutic intervention on the basis of published work, are shown in
  bold. Kidney cancer cells exhibit increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate
  production, with an associated decrease in pyruvate entering the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle. These pathways can be targeted by inhibiting glucose uptake or the
  enzymes hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Kidney cancer cells
  also exhibit alterations in glutamine metabolism to generate glutathione and reduce
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). This pathway can be targeted by inhibiting glutamine
  uptake, glutaminase, or enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis (γ-glutamylcysteine
  synthetase and glutathione synthetase). Kidney cancer cells also exhibit increased
  tryptophan metabolism, which results in increased levels of kynurenine, an immunosuppressive
  metabolite. The production of kynurenine can be inhibited by targeting indoleamine
  2,3-diaxygenase (IDO). Reprinted from ref.  with permission.
