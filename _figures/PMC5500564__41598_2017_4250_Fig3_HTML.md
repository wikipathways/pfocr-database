caption: Differential gene expression in the tamoxifen metabolism pathway. (A) Asian
  American vs African American. Up or down regulation means increase or decrease of
  gene expression in Asian American BRCA patient tumor tissues. (B) Asian American
  vs Caucasian American. Up or down regulation means increase or decrease of gene
  expression in Asian American BRCA patient tumor tissues. (C) African American vs
  Caucasian American. Up or down regulation means increase or decrease of gene expression
  in African American BRCA patient tumor tissues. The pathway diagrams with differential
  gene expression were made using Pathview package, where pathway diagrams were originally
  obtained from KEGG database–.

    Asian American vs African American. Up or down regulation means increase or decrease
    of gene expression in Asian American BRCA patient tumor tissues. (B) Asian American
    vs Caucasian American. Up or down regulation means increase or decrease of gene
