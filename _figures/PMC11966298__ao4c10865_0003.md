caption: Metal-based platforms induce synergistic therapeutic strategies for enhanced
  immunotherapy. In addition to activating tumor immunotherapy triggered by the cGAS-STING
  pathway, metal nanomaterials can also be combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
  chemodynamic therapy, and photothermal therapy to enhance the therapeutic effects
  on tumors. Moreover, cancer vaccines synthesized from metal nanomaterials can be
  used to enhance tumor immunity in some “cold tumors” with low immunogenicity
