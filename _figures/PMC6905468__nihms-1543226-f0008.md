caption: Under normal conditions, cisplatin-DNA adducts (indicated by G<>G) are removed
  by the NER machinery, ATR becomes activated, and the excision gap can be filled
  in by DNA synthesis and ligation. However, when ATR kinase is inhibited, the gap
  filling process becomes more dependent on the translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway,
  which can result in mutagenesis or cell death.
