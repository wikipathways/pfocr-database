caption: Inflammation and cancer connection pathways. An intrinsic and an extrinsic
  pathway connect inflammation and cancer. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by inflammatory
  or infectious conditions that increase tumor risk. In the intrinsic pathway, genetic
  alterations induce inflammation and tumor development. Although they have a different
  origin, both pathways converge in the activation of key transcriptional factors
  and inflammatory mediators, which are responsible for the recruitment of inflammatory
  cells. Once recruited, these cells fuel the process of cancer-related inflammation
  and tumor development. This figure was made with Servier Medical Art templates,
