caption: Model for the redistribution of carbon from triacylglycerol to raffinose
  and stachyose. SDP1-mediated hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) yields fatty acids,
  which can be converted to glucose-phosphate (Glc-P) through β-oxidation, the glyoxylate
  cycle and gluconeogenesis. Glc-P is then synthesized to UDP-Galactose (UDP-Gal)
  and sucrose, the precursors for raffinose and stachyose. It is possible for diacylglycerol
  (DAG) to be further hydrolyzed to provide additional fatty acids, as well as glycerol,
  for conversion to glucose. In this simplified pathway, not all enzymatic steps or
  intermediate metabolites are indicated. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GolS,
  Galactinol Synthase; OAA, oxaloacetate; RS, raffinose synthase; STS, stachyose synthase.
