caption: Schematic model of SARS-CoV-2-induction of complement in respiratory epithelial
  cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects respiratory epithelial cells and induces an interferon
  response. IFNs signal via the IFN receptor to activate STAT1 via JAK1/2. STAT1 co-operates
  with RELA to induce transcription of IL6 and complement genes including C3, CFB,
  C1R and C1S. CFB acts as an alternative pathway C3 convertase to cleave C3 intracellularly
  to C3a and C3b. C3a engages C3aR and C3b engages CD46 on leukocyte subsets in the
  lungs to drive inflammation. These events can be pharmacologically targeted with
  antivirals (e.g., remdesivir), JAK-STAT inhibitors (e.g., ruxolitinib) and/or cell
  permeable complement inhibitors, including CFBi.
