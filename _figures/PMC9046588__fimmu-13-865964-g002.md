caption: The functions of PRMTs in the cancer immune cycle. (A) During T lymphocyte
  proliferation and differentiation, the methylation of NFAT interacting protein NIP45
  and the subsequent binding of PRMT1 to the NFAT transcriptional activation complex
  amplifies IL-4 production. Moreover, PRMT5 partially controls T cell signaling events,
  including AKT/mTOR, ERK1/2, NFAT, and NF-κB signaling by asymmetrically dimethylating
  Vav1 and promoting T cell proliferation and IL-2 production. (B) PRMT1 recruits
  RORγt to the IL-17 promoter and asymmetrically dimethylates histone 4 arginine 3
  (H4R3me2a) to stabilize STAT3 activated by IL-6 rather than STAT5 activated by IL-2.
  This alleviates the inhibitory effects of STAT5 on the IL-17 promoter and promotes
  Th17 differentiation. Concomitantly, PRMT5 methylates the cholesterol biosynthesis
  regulator SREBP1 in T cells, promoting cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes to produce
  RORγt agonists, thereby promoting RORγt activity and driving Th17 differentiation
  gene expression. Besides cholesterol biosynthesis, PRMT5 directly modulates RORγt
  activation and promotes the glycolytic pathway by up-regulating Hif1a, which encodes
  HIF-1α. (C) c-Myc methylation by PRMT1 increases its binding capacity for p300 instead
  of HDAC1, and enhances c-Myc-p300 complex recruitment to PPARγ which triggers M2
  transcription. Additionally, PRMT1 generates asymmetrically dimethylated histone
  H4 Arg3 (H4R3me2a) at the PPARγ promoter to ultimately promote M2 differentiation
  in response to IL4-STAT6 signaling. (D) CARM1 recruits p65 to the CXCL10 promoter
  and catalyzes H3R17me2a. CXCL10 and CXCL11 expression is triggered when PRMT5 symmetrically
  dimethylates p65 which increases p65 affinity for DNA. Conversely, PRMT1 asymmetrically
  dimethylates p65 which negatively regulates p65-DNA binding and transcriptional
  activity. (E) PRMT1 and PRMT5 mediate p65 arginine methylation functions differently
  on CXCL10 and CXCL11 induction. (F) The methylation of the NFAT cofactor protein
  NIP45, catalyzed by PRMT1, augments IFN-γ production and is followed by enhanced
  PD-L1 expression via IFNγ/JAK/STAT1 signaling. PRMT5 up-regulates PD-L1 via H3R2me2s
  on the STAT1 promoter and binds to an unknown transcription factor on the PD-L1
  promoter. (G) PRMT5 interacts with complexes containing BCL6, encouraging BCL6-mediated
  transcriptional repression and allowing access to GC. While PRMT7 induces H4R3me1
  and H4R3me2s at the BCL6 promoter, it represses BCL6 expression and limits GC formation.
