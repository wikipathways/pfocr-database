caption: 'mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. mTORC1: Is a five component complex with DEPTOR
  and PRAS40 as negative regulators and RAPTOR and mSLT8 as positive regulators. It
  regulates different cellular processes like lipid metabolism and protein metabolism
  other than autophagy as seen in Figure . It is influenced by the nutrient and energy
  level in cell and gets shut down or inhibited when cell encounters reducing nutrient
  level and decrease in energy. Inhibition of mTORC1 leads to inhibition of cellular
  metabolic processes. mTORC2; A six component complex has DEPTOR as its negative
  regulator and RICTOR and mSLT8 as positive regulators. This complex influences activation
  of mTORC1 by phosphorylation of AKT. How nutrient level influences mTORC2 is not
  known yet.'
