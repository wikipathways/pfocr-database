caption: A depiction of isoprenoid synthesis through the core 6 enzyme MVA and 7 enzyme
  MEP pathways. Also depicted are the newly discovered archaeal branches from the
  MVA pathway. The thermoarchaeal-type branch begins with mevalonic acid whereas the
  archaeal and haloarchaeal-type branches stem from MVAP. Typically, isoprenoids are
  synthesized by acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, and G3P, however IPP and DMAPP can also be
  synthesized from C5 alcohols, D-ribulose or D-ribulose-5-phosphate, and a synthetic
  route in which HMG-CoA is ultimately converted to prenol. AibAB, 3-methylglutaconyl-coenzyme
  decarboxylase; AtoB, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; BMD, bisphosphomevalonate decarboxylase;
