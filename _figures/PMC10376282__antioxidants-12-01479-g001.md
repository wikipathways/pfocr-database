caption: Catabolic pathway of ellagitannins and ellagic acid to urolithins. 5-OH,
  4-OH, 3-OH, 2-OH, and 1-OH refer to the number of hydroxyl groups for each urolithin
  group—penta-, tetra-, tri-, di- and monohydroxy urolithins, respectively. The blue
  font refers to new urolithins generated by a bacterial 3-dehydroxylase. The purple
  and red circles designate the final urolithins produced in UM-A and UM-B, respectively.
  Uro-AR can be found in both metabotypes. Adapted from [].
