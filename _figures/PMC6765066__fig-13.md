caption: HMGB1 as a therapeutic target in pulmonary diseases. Preexisting trauma,
  exposure to toxicants, PAMPs, or DAMPs can induce the release of HMGB1, either active
  or passively, and subsequently the accumulation of HMGB1 in the airways of patients
  with pulmonary diseases. Post-translational modifications such as hyperacetylation
  and phosphorylation result in the translocation of HMGB1 into the cytoplasm, where
  HMGB1 can be actively released. The hyperacetylation of HMGB1 can be decreased by
  silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT)-1 activators (e.g.,
  resveratrol), NF-κB inhibitors (e.g., ethyl pyruvate, GTS-21, naringin, hesperidin,
  FPS-ZMI), Nrf2 activators (e.g., baicalin, glycyrrhizin, hydrogen sulfide gas, resveratrol),
  and ODSH. Antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sulforaphane), as well as other compounds
  (e.g., vitamin D, insulin), can also inhibit the cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1.
  Similar to antibodies, compounds such as ODSH, glycyrrhizin, and thrombomodulin
  can bind directly to, neutralize, or inactivate extracellular HMGB1, thereby decreasing
  the binding of HMGB1 to its receptors. Extracellular HMGB1 can bind to TLR2, TLR4,
  TLR9, and RAGE receptors to activate pathways involved in inflammation, tissue injury,
  and tissue remodeling. Following the binding of HMGB1 to TLR2 and TLR4, it can activate
  the NF-κB pathway, which ultimately increases the expression and secretion of proinflammatory
  mediators and further augments the secretion of HMGB1, creating a deleterious feedback
  cycle. Also, HMGB1 can bind with RAGE receptors and activate MAPK-dependent pathways
  that mediate tissue injury and remodeling. MAPK inhibitors (e.g., ulinastatin, naringin)
  can decrease the accumulation of airway HMGB1. The accumulation of airway HMGB1
  and proinflammatory mediators increases the levels of ROS, MMP9, heat shock proteins,
  and certain proteases that produce oxidative stress, inflammation, tissue injury,
  and vascular remodeling. NF-κB inhibitors (e.g., ethyl pyruvate, GTS-21, naringin,
  hesperidin, FPS-ZMI) can attenuate cytokine and HMGB1 airway accumulation. Antioxidants,
  PPAR-γ, and Nrf2 activators (e.g., vitamin D, glycyrrhizin, baicalin, resveratrol,
  ethyl pyruvate) can decrease inflammation, lung injury, and remodeling by decreasing
  oxidative stress induced by the accumulation of HMGB1 in the airways. FPS-ZMI, N-benzyl-4-chloro-N-cyclohexylbenzamide;
  Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor.
