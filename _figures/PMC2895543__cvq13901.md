caption: Simplified scheme of pro-inflammatory signal transduction pathways leading
  to eNOS activation and endothelial hyperpermeability. Binding of pro-inflammatory
  agonists to their receptors activates a myriad of intracellular second messengers,
  leading to release of calcium from intracellular stores, PKC activation, Akt/PKB
  activation, and ERK-1/2 activation. The overall result is a functional state favouring
  changes in phosphorylation state of eNOS and elevated production of NO and increased
  permeability of the microvascular barrier. Several elements of the overall signalling
  paradigm remain elusive, such as the downstream effectors linking eNOS-derived NO
  to changes in the cytoskeleton and intercellular junctions that produce the hyperpermeable
  state, the precise role of the balance between cGMP and cAMP [via phosphodiesterases
  (PDE)] in permeability regulation. The mechanisms involved in the restoration of
  basal permeability and/or promotion of enhanced barrier integrity are represented
  by the Epac/Rap1 pathway.
