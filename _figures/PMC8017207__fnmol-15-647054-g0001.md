caption: 'Tau regulates anterograde fast axonal transport through a PP1-GSK3β pathway.
  Lower panel: Exposure of a phosphatase activating domain (PAD, red domain) located
  at the N-terminus of tau causes activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1, in purple).
  Active PP1 (labeled by red asterisks) dephosphorylates and activates glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β (GSK3β). Active GSK3β (labeled by red asterisks) phosphorylates light
  chain subunits of kinesin-1, an event that promotes the release of membrane-bound
  organelle (MBO) cargoes transported by this major motor protein. Spatially discrete
  post-translational modifications in tau that either promote (i.e., phosphorylation
  events in the proline-rich region) or prevent (i.e., N-terminal phosphorylation)
  PAD exposure may thus allow the localized delivery of selected MBOs at functionally
  distinct axonal subdomains, such as en passant pre-synaptic terminals or nodes of
  Ranvier under normal physiological conditions. Although depicted bound to microtubules
  (MT), tau’s dynamic interaction with MTs in normal conditions likely provides opportunities
  for tau to interact with PP1 (and/or other enzymes) on or off the MT surface. Upper
  panel: By extension, aberrant PAD exposure associated pathological forms of tau
  such as aggregates/oligomers (oTau), mutant tau, and selected pathological post-translational
  modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, pTau), may disrupt homeostatic maintenance
  of this process.'
