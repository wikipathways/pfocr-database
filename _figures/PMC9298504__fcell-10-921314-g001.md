caption: Therapeutic targeting of autophagy with potential application in Parkinson’s
  Disease. (A) Schematic representation of autophagosomal formation with autophagic
  core proteins involved in the different steps such as initiation, nucleation and
  expansion. We highlight in yellow the mTOR complex 1, in blue the ULK1 complex and
  in soft red the PI3K Class III complex. (B) Schematic representation of the autophagy
  pathway shows the forming phagophore that matures to the autophagosome and then
  fuses with the lysosome for degradation. Proteins encoded by “Parkinson’s disease
  genes,” labelled with red boxes, function in the autophagy pathway and related processes
  at different steps. The therapeutic targets or drugable nodes within the autophagy
  pathway that are targeted by compounds discussed in this minireview are marked in
  blue.
