caption: Microglia, the primary immune and cytokine-producing cells of the central
  nervous system (CNS), are also critical for normal brain development via (A) the
  phagocytosis of extraneous synapses using the complement pathway; (B) releasing
  factors such as BDNF and IL1β critical for synapse formation during learning and
  memory; (C) phagocytosis of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) via the TREM2 and DAP12/CD11b
  pathway; (D) assisting in neuronal differentiation via the release of insulin-like
  growth factor-1 (IGF-1); (E) Neuronal patterning and wiring using Cx3cr1 signaling;
  (F) supporting neuronal growth and survival by releasing trophic factors; and (G)
  inducing programmed cell death via nerve growth factor (NGF), CD11b integrin DAP12
  immunoreceptor. Diverse environmental challenges with known (solid lightning bolts)
  or suspected (dotted lightning bolts) impacts on microglial development are depicted
  in red text. Refer to  for additional references.
