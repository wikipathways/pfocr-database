caption: Signaling functions of SIRT3 relevant to cancer chemoresistance. As a tumor-suppressing
  protein, SIRT3 not only deacetylates MnSOD and p53 but also regulates the mito-COX-2/p-Drp1Ser616pathway,
  SIRT3/GSTP1/JNK pathway, FOXO3α/CDT1 pathway, and mitochondrial fission to enhance
  chemotherapy drugs sensitivity of cancer. As a tumor-promoting protein, SIRT3 scavenges
  the oxidant products by deacetylating SOD2, MnSOD, and PGC-1α, and activates UPRmt
  to promote chemotherapy drugs resistance to cancer.
