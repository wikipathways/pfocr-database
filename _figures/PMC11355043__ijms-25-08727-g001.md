caption: The current model of the blood coagulation cascade, depicting NOACs’ mechanism
  of action. There are two pathways, the intrinsic pathway and the extrinsic pathway.
  These multicomponent processes are illustrated as enzymes, inhibitors, zymogens,
  or complexes. On injury to the vessel wall, tissue factor, the cofactor for the
  extrinsic tenase complex, is exposed to circulating FVIIa and forms the extrinsic
  tenase. FIX and FX are converted to their serine proteases FIXa and FXa, which then
  form the intrinsic tenase and the prothrombinase complexes, respectively. The combined
  actions of the intrinsic and extrinsic tenase and the prothrombinase complexes lead
  to an explosive burst of the enzyme thrombin (IIa). In addition to its multiple
  procoagulant roles, thrombin also acts in an anticoagulant capacity when combined
  with the cofactor thrombomodulin in the protein Case complex. The product of the
  protein Case reaction, activated protein C (APC), inactivates the cofactors FVa
  and FVIIIa. The cleaved species, FVai and FVIIIai, no longer support the respective
  procoagulant activities. Once thrombin is generated through procoagulant mechanisms,
  thrombin cleaves fibrinogen (releasing fibrinopeptide A and B [FPA and FPB]), as
  well as activating FXIII to form a cross-linked fibrin clot. Thrombin–thrombomodulin
  also activates thrombin activate-able fibrinolysis inhibitor, which slows fibrin
  degradation by plasmin. The procoagulant response is downregulated by the stoichiometric
  inhibitor tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin III (AT-III).
  TFPI serves to attenuate the activity of the extrinsic tenase trigger of coagulation.
  AT-III directly inhibits thrombin, FIXa, and FXa. The accessory pathway provides
  an alternate route for the generation of FIXa. Thrombin has also been shown to activate
  FXI. The fibrin clot is eventually degraded by plasmin, yielding soluble fibrin
  peptides. Factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) act by binding
  to the active site of factor Xa, inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin,
  the final enzyme in the coagulation cascade. Dabigatran, conversely, functions as
  a direct thrombin inhibitor. It binds with high affinity to the active site of thrombin,
  inhibiting its ability to convert fibrinogen to fibrin, thereby preventing clot
  formation
