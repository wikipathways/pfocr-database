caption: Some factors are conducive to increasing the abundance of R.intestinalis
  to increase butyrate. Diet, exercise, prebiotics, probiotics, medication and FMT
  may increase the abundance of R. intestinalis to increase butyrate. Butyrate inhibits
  a series of inflammatory reactions mediated by the NF-κB signaling pathway. Then,
  it inhibits vascular calcification by increasing insulin and inhibiting glucagon
  secretion to inhibit the content of ACEs, improving the intestinal barrier to inhibit
  the content of LPS, and promoting the ketogenic effect to increase the content of
  BHB in the blood
