caption: A current model showing that BES1 family members (or BES1 transcription factors,
  BES1 TFs) are essential downstream regulatory components in the TPD1-EMS1/SERKs
  pathway. In previous studies it was thought that BES1 family members play fundamental
  roles in regulating BR signaling pathway. A previous report proposed that EMS1 regulates
  tapetum development through interaction and activation of a group of beta carbonic
  anhydrases (β-CAs). In this study we suggest that BES1 family members can be activated
  by EMS1-mediated signaling to regulate tapetum formation. Our ChIP analyses suggest
  that BES1 and BZR1 can directly bind to the promoter regions of a number of tapetum
  developmental genes, such as SPL, DYT1, and TDF1. In addition, phenotypic similarity
  between the sextuple mutant and spl implies that BES1 family members may control
  SPL expression in earlier anther development. The detailed mechanism remains to
  be elucidated
