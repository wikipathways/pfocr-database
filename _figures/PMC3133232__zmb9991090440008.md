caption: 'Schematic model of Nrf2 regulation by Keap1. Keap1 is a key regulator of
  the Nrf2-signaling pathway and serves as a molecular switch to turn the Nrf2-mediated
  antioxidant response on and off. (1) Oxidative stress or chemopreventive compounds
  cause a conformational change in the Keap1-Cul3-E3 ubiquitin ligase by acting on
  specific cysteine residues in Keap1. (2) Nuclear translocation of Nrf2: a decrease
  in Nrf2 degradation results in nuclear translocation of free Nrf2 and activation
  of Nrf2 target genes. (3) Nuclear translocation of Keap1: unlatching of the Kelch
  domain in Keap1 from Nrf2 also exposes an NLS to KPNA6, and Keap1 enters the nucleus
  with the assistance of KPNA6/importin β. (4) Turning off of the signal: Keap1 removes
  Nrf2 from the ARE of downstream genes. The Keap1-Nrf2 complex is then transported
  out of the nucleus by the strong NES in Keap1. (5) In the cytosol, the Nrf2-Keap1
  complex associates with the Cul3-Rbx1 core ubiquitin machinery, leading to degradation
  of Nrf2.'
