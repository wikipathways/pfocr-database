caption: 'A) Regulation of expression of differentiation genes in GIST882 and GIST48
  cells. Thick arrows indicate high gene expression of LIX1, SFPQ and PDE3A in GIST882
  cells compared to GIST48 cells. High LIX1 expression downregulated expression of
  αSMA in GIST882, while low LIX1 expression led to higher αSMA expression in GIST48
  cells. B) Model for dual survival pathways and addiction to YAP in GIST882 and GIST48
  cells. C: cilostazol; D: DNMDP; I: imatinib; V: verteporfin. Plain black arrows:
  Effect of the different drugs on their targets (flat head = inhibition; arrow head=
  induction). Thick arrows indicate stronger effect of the drug. Dashed arrow indicates
  hypothetic effect of the drug. Blue arrows: KIT inhibition by imatinib led to downregulation
  of major pathways such as MAPK/ERK or PKB controlling expression of viability factors.
  Thick arrow indicates a stronger KIT oncogenic drive. Red arrows: verteporfin, a
  direct inhibitor of YAP/TEAD interaction shuts down YAP transcriptional program,
  causing severe cytotoxicity in both in GIST882 and GIST48 cells. In GIST882 cells,
  activation of oncogenic KIT downstream pathways is modest (i.e. sensitive to imatinib).
  Cilostazol leads to nuclear exclusion of YAP and reduces of cell viability, alone
  or in synergism with imatinib. In GIST48 cells, lower PDE3A expression and stronger
  activation of KIT downstream pathways (i.e. resistance to imatinib) overcomes the
  effect of cilostazol on YAP-driven viability. Cilostazol however sensitizes GIST48
  cells to the modest inhibition of oncogenic KIT downstream pathways by imatinib.
  Our data suggest that oncogenic KIT downstream pathways and YAP pathway act in parallel
  to drive cell survival. In case of simultaneous inhibition of the two pathways,
  their relative strength shifts the balance between survival and cell death.'
