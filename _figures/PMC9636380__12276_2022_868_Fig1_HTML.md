caption: RIPK3 can be activated via various receptors when bound by their respective
  ligands. These are TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1), CD95, death receptors (DR4/5), Toll-like
  receptors (TLR3/4), and Z-DNA-binding protein-1 (ZBP1)/DAI. In the first three of
  these pathways (but not TLR3/4 or ZBP1), RIPK1 is required and binds to RIPK3 through
  its receptor-interacting protein homotypic interaction motif (RHIM). In the case
  of ZBP1, RIPK3 is recruited directly via the ZBP1 RHIM domain, while in the case
  of TLR3/4, RIPK3 is recruited indirectly via the RHIM domain of TRIF. Once activated,
  RIPK3 autophosphorylates and then phosphorylates and activates MLKL to induce a
  conformational change and translocation to the membrane, where membrane permeabilization
  follows. During this process, post-translational modifications positively and negatively
  regulate the necroptosis pathway. Two E3 ligases, Pellino-1 (PELI1) and carboxy
  terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP), may control the basal threshold of
  necroptosis. Another E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM21, is proposed to be a regulator
  of necroptotic cell death in response to TRAIL. PPM1B suppresses necroptosis by
  dephosphorylating RIPK3.
