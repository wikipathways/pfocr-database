caption: 'The scheme for pathways of linear, cyclic and pseudocyclic electron transport
  (blue arrows) as driven by light energy allocated to Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem
  I (PSI), in the light reactions (with light‐blue background) of photosynthesis (redrawn
  with permission from Yin et al., ). Thick‐curved arrows show O2 evolved, protons
  (H+) pumped or NADPH produced per electron transferred. H+ are required for ATP
  synthesis, and produced ATP and NADPH (or reductant equivalents) are used for various
  metabolic processes specified underneath in black phrases. The cyclic electron transport,
  the pseudocyclic electron transport, and the Q cycle introduced in Extension 2 are
  shown in thin double‐lined arrows and their fluxes are all expressed in proportion
  to the total electron flux passing PSI (J 1) as f cycJ 1, f pseudoJ 1 and f QJ 1,
  respectively. The linear electron transport (LET) as the only pathway defined in
  the canonical model is shown in thick single‐lined arrows and expressed as (1 − f
  cyc − f pseudo)J 1. In the presence of the cyclic electron transport, the electron
  flux passing PSII (J 2) is smaller than that passing PSI: J 2 = (1 − f cyc)J 1,
  instead of J 2 = J 1 as implied in the canonical model. In the presence of pseudocyclic
  electron transport for supporting processes like nitrate reduction, CO2 uptake is
  not in a 1:1 ratio to O2 evolution, but is [1 − f pseudo/(1 − f cyc)] mol CO2 per
  mol O2 evolved (assuming no Mehler reaction), which is the basis for Equation ()
