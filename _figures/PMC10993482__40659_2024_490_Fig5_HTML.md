caption: Gal-1 pathways promoting EMT in cancer. (a) Gal-1 promotes EMT in gastric
  cancer cells through a TGFR-β/Smad pathway and can be blocked with the Gal-1 inhibitor
  ITD1. (b) Gal-1 secreted from gastric cancer cells or CAFs induces EMT through a
  mechanism involving β1-integrin and Gli-1. (c) Overexpression of Gal-1 in gastric
  cancer cells increases the levels of S1PR1 at the cell surface, which is required
  for Gal-1-induced EMT through an unknown pathway. (d) Overexpression of Gal-1 in
  ovarian cancer cells activates MAPK JNK/p38 signaling through an unknown mechanism
  promoting EMT. (e) Activation of TLR-4 induces Gal-1 via PI3K/AKT or ERK-AKT pathways
  leading to EMT. (f) Gal-1 overexpression in HCC cells induces EMT through a Integrin/FAK/PI3K/AKT
  pathway. (g-j) Examples of extracellular Gal-1 contribution to EMT, involving Ras/Rac1/MEKK4/JNK/AP
  (g) and FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR (h) in urothelial cancer cells, activation of NFkB signaling
  in pancreatic cancer cells (i) and activation of β -catenin pathway in colorectal
  cancer (j)
