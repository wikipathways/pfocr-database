caption: Possible involvement of MRP5 in the regulation of the function of cardiovascular
  smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes via the NO/cGMP-signaling pathway. NO is
  formed by nitric oxide synthases in cardiovascular endothelial cells, eg, in response
  to an ischemic stimulus, and diffuses to cardiovascular smooth muscle cells as well
  as to the cardiac myocytes. In these cells it enhances the cellular levels of cGMP
  by stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclases (sGC). Intracellular targets of the
  cGMP signal transduction pathway include cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs),
  cGMP-gated ion channels, as well as cGMP-regulated cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs).
  The signal is terminated either by metabolic degradation of cGMP by PDEs or by ATP-dependent
  export of cGMP from the cell mediated by MRP5.
