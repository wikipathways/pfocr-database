caption: ER stress preferentially activates autophagy in neuronal cells. (a) Diagram
  showing the pathways investigated in this study by which ER stress may increase
  the proteolytic capacity of neuronal cells. ER stress could enhance proteolytic
  degradation by the proteasome by influencing the subunit composition via activation
  of the EOR. Alternatively, the UPR can be employed to enhance the expression levels
  of the constitutive subunits. In addition, regulation of the localization or activity
  of the proteasome may occur. In addition, the UPR may result in activation of autophagy.
  (b) Our data show that a disturbance of ER homeostasis resulting in activation of
  the UPR will activate the autophagy pathway. This can be due to a decreased capability
  to export misfolded proteins from the ER lumen under these conditions or may relate
  to the inability of the proteasome to degrade aggregated proteins. In AD neurons,
  decreased proteasomal degradation as well as a disruption in the autophagosomal/lysosomal
  system may eventually lead to neurodegeneration
