caption: SB induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in cervical cancer cells through the mitochondrial
  fission dynamic pathway mediated by Drp1 in vitro and in vivo. SB increased the
  expression of Drp1 in cervical cancer cells which lead to mitochondrial excessive
  fission and mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby inducing the G2/M cell cycle arrest
  and decreasing the expressions of CDK1, cyclin B1, and cdc25C. Blocking Drp1 inactivates
  mitochondrial fission in cervical cancer cells and alleviates the G2/M cell cycle
  arrest. Our study suggests that SB can be exploited as a potential medicine for
  cervical cancer therapeutic prevention and treatment via the Drp1-mediated mitochondrial
  pathway.
