caption: Neuroimmune signaling integrates central nervous system (CNS) responses to
  alcohol and stress. (Left) Stressors activate the body’s stress response system,
  which is comprised of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands (i.e.,
  HPA axis) as well as the stress hormones they produce (e.g., adrenocorticotropic
  hormone and glucocorticoids). Stress also activates the sympathetic nervous system,
  which secretes catecholamines. These hormones act on various organs and tissues
  that are part of the immune system. In response, immune cells secrete cytokines
  that via the blood are transported to the brain. There, these cytokines lead to
  brain neuroimmune-gene induction that sensitizes stress-response pathways. At the
  same time, the immune system communicates with the CNS through sensory (afferent)
  nerves that activate the brain in response to stressful stimuli. This communication
  pathway involves particularly the vagus nerve and the nucleus tractus solitarius
  in the brain stem. (Right) Alcohol influences neuroimmune signaling via its effects
  on the gastrointestinal tract. Consumed ethanol enters the stomach and gut and makes
  them “leaky” by inducing the release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which
  in turn activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the gut. As a result, bacterial
  products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can enter the blood and reach the liver.
  Both LPS and ethanol (which also reaches the liver via the circulation) contribute
  to inflammatory reactions in the liver, which lead to release of tumor necrosis
  factor-alpha (TNF-α) and other proinflammatory cytokines from the liver. These proinflammatory
  cytokines in the blood enter the brain and increase neuroimmune-gene expression.
  Chronic ethanol also increases expression of HMGB1–TLR4 signaling in the brain,
  leading to persistent and progressive increases in neuroimmune-gene expression in
  the brain.
