caption: 'Model of GPCRs mediated signaling pathways. In classical model, heterotrimeric
  G proteins (α, β, γ subunits) mediate signal transduction via the receptor. Signal
  transduction initiated when ligands bind to GPCRs. The resulting conformation change
  promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Galpha subunit of G proteins. Gs activates
  AC leading to the production of cAMP in cells, then cAMP binds to the regulatory
  subunit of PKA, regulating the phosphorylation of the GPCR and leading the process
  of desensitization of GPCR. PKA can regulate the level of CREB (Zeitlin et al.,
  ) and mediates MAPK ERK pathway (New and Wong, ). Gq/11 controls the activity of
  PLC, which hydrolyzes PIP2 to generate IP3 and DAG. IP3 and DAG in turn lead to
  an increase in the intracellular concentrations of free Ca2+, regulation of NFκB
  (Arendash et al., ) and the activation of a number of protein kinases and pathways,
  including PKC/MAPK/ERK (Ritter and Hall, ). GPCR activate PI3K/Akt cascades through
  Gβγ (New and Wong, ). Gi inhibits AC, and G12/13 is suggested to activate GSK3 in
  neuronal cells (Sayas et al., ,). GSK3 is involved in tau phosphorylation with regard
  to AD pathology (Ly et al., ). And Akt and PKC can inhibit GSK3 activity (New and
  Wong, ; Langmead et al., ). Abbreviations: GPCR(s), G protein-coupled receptor(s);
  GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; AC, adenyl cyclase; cAMP,
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; CREB, cAMP response element-binding
  protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate; IP3,
  inositol triphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; NFκB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
