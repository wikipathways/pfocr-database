  and InvasionmiR-206 promoted lung cancer cell apoptosis by targeting c-Met and Bcl2,
  as well as governed EGFR, MET, and its downstream phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and
  AKT. Likewise, miR-133b boosted lung cancer cell apoptosis by suppressing expression
  of MCL1, BCL2L2, and attenuated EGFR and its downstream phosphorylation of ERK1/2
  and AKT. Furthermore, miR-206 inhibited lung cancer cell migration and invasion
  by repressing SOX9 and Smad3 and upregulating E-cadherin, meanwhile blocked EGFR,
  MET, and its downstream phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT, as well as antagonized
  c-Met and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. miR-133b repressed FSCN1, contributing to the
  blockage of lung cancer cell migration and invasion.
