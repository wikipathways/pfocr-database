caption: LIGHT imposes a pro-inflammatory phenotype on esophageal fibroblasts by signaling
  through HVEM or LTβR. LIGHT-HVEM signaling is proposed to activate the canonical
  NFkB pathway. In the canonical signaling pathway, adaptor proteins are recruited
  to form the IKK complex, which degrades the IκB inhibitor, leading to nuclear translocation
  of NF-kB dimers and gene transcription. In contrast, LIGHT-LTβR signaling is thought
  to mainly occur via the non-canonical NF-kB pathway. In the non-canonical pathway,
  ligand binding drives NIK to activate IKKα, which phosphorylates the p100 molecule
  that is then cleaved to produce p52, which translocates into the nucleus as a heterodimer
  with RelB, where it promotes pro-inflammatory and anti-homeostatic gene expression.
  Together, these pathways play a primary role in driving homeostatic fibroblasts
  towards pathogenic pro-inflammatory fibroblasts in eosinophilic esophagitis.
