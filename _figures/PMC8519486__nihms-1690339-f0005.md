caption: 'Bottom Right: NFκB activation in VIC through concerted efforts of inflammatory
  LPS/TLR signaling, LFA-1/ICAM-1 signaling, and Notch-1 signaling induces VIC osteoblastic
  differentiation and calcification. Left: Inflammation induces NFκB activation in
  VEC. NFκB+ VEC undergo EndMT, transforming into VIC (T-VIC). NFκB+ VEC have also
  been shown to exhibit evidence of osteoblastic differentiation. Knock-out of valve-specific
  NFκB in CAVD models prevents calcification and adverse valvular remodeling, consistent
  with the paradigm that NFκB activation in VEC promotes pathologic differentiation
  of VIC. Top right: Inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 activate NFκB signaling
  in VEC, which induces EndMT. It is unknown if Notch1 also plays a role in NFκB signaling
  in VEC. If so, Notch pathway could be a method through which VIC and VEC communicate
  in response to inflammation.'
