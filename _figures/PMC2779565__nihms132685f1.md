caption: The most studied pathways of autophagy regulation, including mTOR-mediated
  suppression of autophagy, which is reversed by amino acid deprivation, rapamycin,
  or AMP-kinase (1), and the Beclin 1-class III PI3K pathways (2) are shown. In addition,
  there is cell type-dependent stimulation of autophagy by ERK and JNK signaling (3),
  although kinase targets remain unidentified. Alternative mechanisms for generating
  PI(3)P exist in mammalian cells, including wortmannin-resistant class II PI3Ks and
  phosphoinositide phosphatases (4, see text). Recent studies also suggest a role
  for ROS acting downstream of Beclin 1 to reduce cleavage of LC3 from preautophagosomal
  membranes (5). The signals involved in generating mitochondrial ROS during starvation
  remain undefined, but ROS are involved in mitochondrial activation of ERK. It is
  unknown if ERK acts directly to phosphorylate mitochondrial targets or if its effects
  on autophagy reflect other cytoplasmic sites of action.
