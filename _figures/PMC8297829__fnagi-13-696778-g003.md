caption: Schematic representation of the two general CYP46A1 mechanisms of action—via
  the mevalonate pathway and sterol flux. Modulation (the ↕ up-down arrow) of CYP46A1
  activity affects the mevalonate pathway (or the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis),
  a critical metabolic circuitry which plays key roles in multiple cellular processes
  by synthesizing the non-sterol isoprenoids and sterol cholesterol precursors. Modulation
  of CYP46A1 activity also alters the brain cholesterol turnover and sterol flux through
  the plasma membranes. The latter in turn affects membrane properties and thereby
  membrane-dependent events. See main text for details. Dashed arrows indicate multiple
  steps.
