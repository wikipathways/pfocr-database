caption: In HD, YY1 protein is recruited by CAG RNA foci and polyQ protein aggregates
  and this results in the derepression of PAPD5 transcription. Upregulation of PAPD5
  expression leads to the induction of TAB2, which triggers TAK1-MKK4-JNK-caspase
  cascade, and eventually results in caspase-3 activation and neuronal cell death.
