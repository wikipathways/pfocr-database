caption: Ca2+signaling pathway of alternative splicing regulated by mechanical stress.
  In response to mechanical stimulation, Ca2+ influx is induced by both Gd3+-sensitive
  cation channel and L-type Ca2+ channel. Phosphorylation path is activated by Ca2+
  entried through Gd3+- sensitive cation channel (see Fig. ), then regulates the expression
  of different splicing isoforms. Furthermore, the increase of intracellular Ca2+
  by mechanical stress makes effect on splicing factors, then changes different splicing
  variants expression.
