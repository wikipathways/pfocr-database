caption: Model for Spn function. The results indicate that Spn is required for prestalk
  cell differentiation and would be part of a complex network, including the Dictyostelium
  STAT () and the signaling molecules DIF and cAMP (see text for details). Under the
  appropriate signal, it is possible that the Gα-like domain acts as a molecular switch
  allowing the activation of the phosphatase domain. Once active, Spn, by antagonizing
  the effect of a Ser/Thr kinase, may either activate a pathway required for the prestalk
  differentiation process or inhibit a negative regulator responsible for a block
  of this pathway.
