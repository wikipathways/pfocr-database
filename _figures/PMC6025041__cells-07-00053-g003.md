caption: HBP modulates cancer metabolism through the O-GlcNAcylation of metabolic
  enzymes, signaling proteins and mitochondrial proteins. (A) In the image, the main
  metabolic pathways exploited by cancer cells for anabolism and bioenergetics are
  represented. The O-GlcNAcylated proteins (mainly the metabolic enzymes) are indicated
  in the grey boxes if the effect of the glycosylation has been demonstrated. The
  circle on the box, representing the O-GlcNAcylation, is red when the protein function
  is activated by glycosylation and green when it is inhibited. (B) The reciprocal
  regulation of AMPK and PKA and the HBP is schematically represented as discussed
  in the main text. 6-PG, 6-phosphogluconate; 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  THF, tetrahydrofolate; DHF, dihydrofolate; FA, fatty acids; Fatty Ac-CoA, Fatty
  Acyl-Coenzyme A; GSH, glutathione; Trx, thioredoxin; NT, nucleotides.
