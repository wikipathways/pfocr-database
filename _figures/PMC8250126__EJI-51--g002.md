caption: Importance of cytokine signaling through Janus kinases (JAK) during SARS‐CoV‐2
  lung infection. Viral endocytosis in lung epithelial cells begins through the ACE2
  receptor, which is regulated by IFN signaling. The initial antiviral response mediated
  by type I/III IFNs and downstream JAK/STAT signaling is impaired in severely ill
  patients. In these patients with progressive disease, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection triggers
  an excessive immune reaction with release of multiple pro‐inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL‐2, IL‐6, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF) that signal through
  the JAK/STAT pathway, and others like TNF. Infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils
  contribute to lung injury. A genetic susceptibility with polymorphisms in or near
  the genes for IFNAR2 and TKY2, respectively, and, the development of autoantibodies
  against IFNs favor the inflammatory profile in severely ill patients. The JAK1/JAK2
  inhibitor baricitinib exerts antiviral effects by hampering virus endocytosis and
  profound anti‐inflammatory effects in severely ill patients by blocking cytokine
  signaling.
