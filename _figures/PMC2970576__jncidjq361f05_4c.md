caption: Analysis of gene expression in CD44+/CD24− MCF-7/ADR cell population by TaqMan
  Low-Density Array and Ingenuity Pathway analysis. Genes in CD44+/CD24− MCF-7/ADR
  cells with expression levels that were greater than twofold higher or lower than
  their expression in CD44+/CD24+ MCF-7/ADR cells (Supplementary Table 7, available
  online) were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathways software to identify any biological
  relationships among these genes. A) Highest ranked pathway. B) Second highest ranked
  pathway. Green shapes = decreased gene expression; red shapes = increased gene expression.
  Pathways were drawn by use of the Path Designer feature in Ingenuity Pathways Analysis
  software, version 8.0 (Ingenuity).
