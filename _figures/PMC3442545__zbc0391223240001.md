caption: The two-component response regulator CpxR can become activated by two independent
  mechanisms. A, activation by the cytoplasmic membrane sensor kinase CpxA. Upon activation
  by diverse extracytoplasmic signals, CpxA autophosphorylates on a conserved histidine
  residue, using ATP as its phosphoryl donor. Phospho-CpxA then acts as a phosphoryl
  donor to the response regulator CpxR, which autophosphorylates on the conserved
  aspartate residue (Asp-51). By homology to OmpR, phosphorylation of CpxR is predicted
  to expose its DNA-binding domain, which promotes binding to its target genes (,
  ). B, activation by AcP. In the absence of extracytoplasmic stimuli, CpxA functions
  as a net phosphatase, removing inorganic phosphate (Pi) from CpxR-P. Under these
  conditions, CpxR can become phosphorylated using as its phosphoryl donor AcP, the
  intermediate of the Pta-AckA pathway (, ). Phosphotransacetylase (Pta) converts
  acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) to AcP, whereas acetate kinase (AckA) converts AcP to
  acetate (). Bent arrow, cpxP promoter. +1, transcription initiation site.
