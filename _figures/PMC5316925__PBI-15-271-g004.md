caption: ABA mediated signalling pathway during normal and stress conditions. Under
  normal conditions, ABA content is low, and SnRK2 protein kinase activity is inhibited
  by PP2C phosphatases. Under drought stress, the cellular ABA level increases, and
  ABA then binds to PYR/PYL/RCARs, which in turn bind and inactivate PP2Cs. The SnRK2s
  autoactivate when they dissociate from PP2Cs. Activated SnRK2s phosphorylate downstream
  targets and trigger ABA‐induced physiological and molecular responses.
