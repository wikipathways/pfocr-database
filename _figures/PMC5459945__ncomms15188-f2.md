caption: '(a) The unique pathways analysed in this study are indicated by the coloured
  lines. Green: glucose synthetic; blue: glycolytic EMP; orange: MG bypass; purple:
  ED pathway. (b) Sample cut set strategy for synthetic glucose pathway shows that
  the structure is amenable to a metabolic valve topology which bypasses most of the
  biomass precursors. These precursors of the central metabolism are required for
  growth and have been identified in red. The green x marks which reactions have been
  identified for deletion by the algorithm to design for orthogonality. The blue x
  marks the metabolite valve. Synthetic pathways attempt to bypass these precursors
  as well as the points of regulation. A similar branched topology was not observed
  for natural glycolytic pathways.'
