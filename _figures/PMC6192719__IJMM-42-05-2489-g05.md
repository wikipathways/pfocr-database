caption: Networks analysis of the 24 differentially expressed genes with potential
  miRNA-mRNA interactions in hypoxic AC16 CMs. The network analyses of the 24 differentially
  expressed genes with potential miRNA-mRNA interactions in hypoxic AC16 CMs were
  investigated using Ingenuity®Pathway Analysis software. (A) In network 1, 14 targeted
  genes (DIO2, SLC2A5, APOL6, HDAC11, STC1, MME, CHAC1, APLN, TFRC, CD4, HIF3A, BCL2,
  DMTN, and SLC6A8) were associated with free radical scavenging, small molecule biochemistry,
  and carbohydrate metabolism. (B) In network 2, seven targeted genes (SLC7A11, ACVRL1,
  BNIP3L, MME, METTL7A, TNS1, and GPR68) were associated with cancer, organismal injury
  and abnormalities, and cell death and survival. In network 3, only CAMK1D was associated
  with carbohydrate metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, and digestive system
  development and function. CMs, cardiomyocytes; miRNA, microRNA. Diamonds, horizontal
  ovals, vertical ovals, squares, rectangles, trapezoids, and inverted triangles represent
  enzymes, transcription regulators, transmembrane receptors, cytokines, ligand-dependent
  nuclear receptors, transporters, and kinases, respectively. Solid and dashed lines
  represent direct and indirect action, respectively. Red and green symbols represent
  upregulated and downregulated molecules, respectively.
