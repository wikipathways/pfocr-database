caption: Lipid droplets involvement in (+)ssRNA virus infections. LDs seem to be involved
  in all the (+)ssRNA virus infection stages. During the first steps of a virus life
  cycle, thanks to a tight connection with ER vesicles and DMVs, LDs can serve as
  a platform for virus replication and assembly. LDs are also involved in the inflammation
  responses. Once viral signatures activate TLRs, an immune signaling cascade is initiated
  through the activation of the NF-κB pathway leading to the expression of downstream
  target genes. FFAs generated from LD metabolism rearrangement can also function
  as activating stimuli to NF-κB itself. cPLA2α localizes on the LD surface where
  it releases AA, which is converted in eicosanoids supporting inflammation. On the
  other side, LDs can hinder inflammation by activating PPAR anti-inflammatory signaling
  pathways or blocking virus replication and assembly through viperin, which localizes
  on LD surface. Created with BioRender.com.
