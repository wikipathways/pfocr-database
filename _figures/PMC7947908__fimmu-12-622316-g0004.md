caption: The role of circRNAs in the pathophysiological process of SLE (a) In T cells
  of patients with SLE, hsa_circ_0012919 competitively binds to mir-125a-3P through
  ceRNA mechanism, regulates the expression of DNMT1/RANTES gene, reduces the level
  of CD70, and causes the pathophysiological process of acute and chronic inflammation,
  leading to the occurrence and development of SLE. CircIBTK competitively binds to
  mir-29b, reverses mir-29b induced DNA demethylation, activates the AKT signaling
  pathway, and promotes T cell apoptosis. CircRNA is degraded by RNase L, and PKR
  enhances phosphorylation when the organism is infected by an associated virus or
  stimulated by Poly (I:C), leading to the development of SLE. (b) In patients with
  SLE, the decrease in the number of T cells and B cells with excessive proliferation
  of antinuclear antibodies result in granulocyte cell membrane damage or degradation,
  swelling of the nucleus, the formation of lupus corpuscle, the induction of macrophages
  and neutrophils chemotaxis by LE corpuscle, combined with the formation of the antibody
  specificity immune complex, deposited on the skin, blood vessels, and joints. In
  the presence of the complement, lupus cells form, leading to inflammation and tissue
  necrosis, directly through autoantibodies and tissue cell antigen interaction, causing
  cell damage.
