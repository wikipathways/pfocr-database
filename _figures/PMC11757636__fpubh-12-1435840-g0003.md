caption: Influence of autophagy on the progression of pneumoconiosis. PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway and AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway are involved in the silica-induced
  autophagy. The activation of Gas6/Mer would also promote autophagy. ZC3H4 is involved
  in autophagy by ER stress, which is promoted by ELK-1. The increase of monocyte
  chemoattractant protein-induced protein 1 could promote autophagy. FAS- caspase-8
  inhibits autophagy through TNF-α-TNFR signal pathway. Environmental factors, including
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS), nicotine etc., also exert influence on autophagy
