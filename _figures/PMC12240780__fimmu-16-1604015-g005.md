caption: Role of LLPS in mutant tumor suppressor genes driving carcinogenesis. Tumor
  suppressor genes dynamically regulate key tumor-suppressive or apoptosis-promoting
  pathways through LLPS. Their mutations disrupt condensate formation and alter phase
  separation properties, leading to loss of tumor-suppressive function or acquisition
  of oncogenic activity. (A) NF2 mutation inhibits LATS plasma membrane localization
  via LLPS and inactivate the Hippo pathway, while decreasing NF2 protein levels and
  promoting meningeal cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. NF2 mutation also inhibits
  cGAS-STING signaling via LLPS, eliminating anti-tumor immunity, and synergistically
  promote tumor progression. (B) Under physiological conditions, APC promotes axin
  LLPS, recruits GSK3β, CK1α, and β-catenin, assembles a multiprotein β-catenin destruction
  complex, and promotes GSK3β-mediated β-catenin phosphorylation and β-catenin degradation.
  Mutant APCs form condensates of different composition that fail to degrade β-catenin,
  and the accumulated β-catenin enhances the transcriptional activity of the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, leading to colorectal carcinogenesis. (C) Mutation in the tetrameric
  domain of P53 prevents tetramer formation and disrupts LLPS, reducing target gene
  activation and carcinogenesis. M237I and R249S mutated P53 accelerates the LLPS
  and liquid-solid transition process, forms aggregates with amyloid-like properties,
  and promotes the oncogenic gain-of-function. (D) Under physiological conditions,
  SPOP and DAXX form SPOP/DAXX bodies via LLPS, which reduce DAXX levels by ubiquitinating
  and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Disruption of LLPS and DAXX ubiquitination
  caused by SPOP mutations can drive tumorigenesis. Figure created in BioRender. (2025)

  description: Role of LLPS in mutant tumor suppressor genes driving carcinogenesis.
    Tumor suppressor genes dynamically regulate key tumor-suppressive or apoptosis-promoting
    pathways through LLPS. Their mutations disrupt condensate formation and alter
    phase separation properties, leading to loss of tumor-suppressive function or
    acquisition of oncogenic activity. (A) NF2 mutation inhibits LATS plasma membrane
    localization via LLPS and inactivate the Hippo pathway, while decreasing NF2 protein
    levels and promoting meningeal cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. NF2 mutation
    also inhibits cGAS-STING signaling via LLPS, eliminating anti-tumor immunity,
    and synergistically promote tumor progression. (B) Under physiological conditions,
    APC promotes axin LLPS, recruits GSK3β, CK1α, and β-catenin, assembles a multiprotein
    β-catenin destruction complex, and promotes GSK3β-mediated β-catenin phosphorylation
    and β-catenin degradation. Mutant APCs form condensates of different composition
    that fail to degrade β-catenin, and the accumulated β-catenin enhances the transcriptional
    activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, leading to colorectal carcinogenesis.
