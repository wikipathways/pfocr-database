caption: Schematic diagram of the pathogenic mechanism. (A) In the pantothenate and
  CoA biosynthesis pathways, the boxes represent protein molecules, the circles represent
  metabolic molecules, and the blue color represents decreases in the levels of substances.
  (B) Relationships among the gut microbiota, intestinal metabolites, number of peripheral
  blood cells and ESCC incidence are depicted; blue indicates a decrease, and red
  indicates an increase
