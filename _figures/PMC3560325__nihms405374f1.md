caption: 'At least four tissues contribute to immune responses against human pathogens,
  including fat body, hemocytes, and salivary gland and midgut epithelia. Upon recognition
  of the pathogen, proteinase cascades are initiated, which activate a number of downstream
  immune reactions. These include (i) the Toll pathway leading to antimicrobial peptide
  production, (ii) activation of phenoloxidases resulting in melanin production, and
  (iii) activation of thioester proteins as part of the complement pathway. Two mosquito
  serpins (SRPNs) act as acute-phase response molecules: SRPN6 (blue dots) and 10
  (red stain) are upregulated in epithelial midgut cells upon malaria parasite invasion.
  SRPN6 protein is also detectable upon malaria parasite invasion of the salivary
  gland epithelium. The only mosquito serpin with known molecular function is SRPN2,
  which regulates melanization by inhibiting the serine proteinase that activates
  prophenoloxidase. BL, basal lamina; CLIP, clip-domain serine proteinase; PAP, phenoloxidase-activating
  protease; PM; peritrophic matrix; PO, phenoloxidase; SPE, spaetzle-processing enzyme;
