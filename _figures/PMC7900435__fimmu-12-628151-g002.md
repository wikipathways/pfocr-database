caption: Model of the arms race of silkworm and baculovirus. Silkworms have several
  antiviral immune responses which they use against baculovirus infections. These
  include global protein synthesis shutdown, rRNA degradation, inactivation by gut
  juice antiviral proteins, host gene-encoded resistance, NF-κB antiviral pathway,
  apoptosis, melanization, and RNAi-based antiviral response. The prophenoloxidase
  (PPO) activation cascade causes melanization to block baculovirus infection, which
  is negatively regulated by serpins. RNAi antiviral defense of insects includes the
  major mechanism of the siRNA pathway and the minor contribution of the miRNA pathway.
  The silkworm-encoded miRNA bmo-miR-2819 and bmo-miRNA-390 inhibit BmNPV proliferation
  by downregulating viral genes. As a confrontation, baculovirus have developed several
  strategies to escape host immunity and promote their own replication and proliferation,
  including inhibition of antiviral apoptosis, melanization, RNAi and regulation of
  the cell cycle. For example, Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) induces Bmserpin2
  to inhibit host melanization. Meanwhile, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus
  (AcMNPV) p35 inhibits siRNA pathway. Additionally, baculoviruses exploit the miRNA
  pathway to encode their own miRNAs (such as BmNPV-miR-1 and BmNPV-miR-3) for viral
  propagation.
