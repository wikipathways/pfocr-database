caption: The metabolic pathways of FLS pyroptosis and ferroptosis are involved in
  the onset of pain in OA and the interplay between response components and those
  involved in other modes of cell deathThe left half shows the FLS pyroptosis-related
  signaling pathways. Many factors trigger, through the same or different pathways,
  the assembly of NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles and the subsequent activation of caspase-1
  or caspase-11/4/5, which cleaves GSDMD proteins and pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, leading
  to the release of IL-1β and IL-18 and the release of the cell through the channels
  formed by N-GSDMD. ROS upregulates TXNIP expression through the inhibition of Nrf2/HO-1,
  further accelerating the onset of pyroptosis. miR-20a overexpression inhibits FLS
  pyroptosis through the downregulation of TXNIP expression. SFRP1 is a Wnt signaling
  pathway antagonist. SFRP1 can bind to and downregulate the activity of the ADAM
  metallopeptidase domain 10 metalloprotein of the Notch signaling pathway, thereby
  blocking the activation of the Notch signaling pathway. SFRP1 may be involved in
  NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling pathways.
  The right half of the figure shows the FLS ferroptosis-related signaling pathway.
  Semaphorin 5A significantly upregulates GPX4 expression by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling pathway, which is attenuated by RSL3-induced ferroptosis. Activation of
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway also promotes GPX4 protein translation by inhibiting
  the downstream molecule 4E-BP1. Knockdown of SREBP1 and SCD-1 significantly abrogates
  the reduction in MDA levels caused by semaphorin 5A, while it has no effect on ROS
  levels
