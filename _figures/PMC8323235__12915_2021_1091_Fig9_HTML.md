caption: 'Schematic summary of the findings. We found that Hrs depletion strongly
  inhibits myogenesis. Mechanistically, Hrs silencing impairs MRFs in the early steps
  of differentiation through the upregulation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway concomitant
  with impaired Akt2 signaling network and activation of the downstream FOXO1 repressor
  of myogenesis. Upstream, degradation of EGFR, a regulator of the MEK/ERK signaling,
  was impaired in absence of Hrs. The activity of the myogenic repressors GSK3β was
  also found to be upregulated when Hrs was absent. Inhibition of GSK3β by the azakenpaullone
  GSK3β-specific inhibitor compound significantly restores the impaired differentiation
  observed in Hrs-depleted cells. In addition, functional autophagy that is required
  for myogenesis was also found to be strongly inhibited. Left panel: under normal
  condition. Right panel: upon Hrs depletion'
