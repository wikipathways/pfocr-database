caption: The signaling pathway model. (A) The activation process of Cry toxins and
  cell apoptosis in mid-intestinal epithelial cells. (i) Parasporal crystals are dissolved
  and released into insect intestinal fluid after ingestion by insects. (ii) Protoxins
  are hydrolyzed and activated to release active Cry toxins. (B) A series of cell
  signaling cascade pathways are activated by the binding of Cry toxins with the cadherin
  receptors, leading to cell apoptosis. (iii) Active Cry toxins bind to cadherin receptors.
  (iv) A series of Mg2+-dependent downstream cell signaling cascades are triggered.
  (v) G proteins are activated to synthesize GTP. (vi) Adenylate cyclases are now
  activated to synthesize cAMP. (VII) PKAs are activated after binding with cAMP.
  (VIII) Activated PKAs then destabilize ion channels in the mid-intestinal epithelial
  cell membrane (a), or trigger further downstream cell signaling cascades, leading
  to cell apoptosis (b).
