caption: The major pathways involved in lipid trafficking, compartmentalization and
  utilization are represented within boxes, each of which undergo regulation through
  a combination of host genetic factors and environmental interactions (). Obesity
  and insulin resistance are each complex genetic traits, with variants in more than
  1000 genes linked to altered susceptibility (106, 107). Variations in energy metabolism
  are linked to variants in mitochondrial genes including uncoupling protein 1, 2
  (UCP1, UCP2) as well as superoxide dismutase2 (SOD2), whose candidate genes are
  expressed in extrahepatic tissues (adipose, muscle) as well as the liver. Fatty
  acid uptake and metabolic channeling results in partitioning between de novo lipogenesis/energy
  utilization/lipid droplet pathways. Hepatic glucose uptake and utilization is also
  regulated by variants in glucokinase regulator (GCKR) (), which in turn regulate
  substrate flow for de novo lipogenesis. In addition, de novo lipogenesis pathways
  also interact metabolically with the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion
  pathway. The lipid droplet (LD) pathway includes many of the candidate genes implicated
  in NAFLD development and progression, including patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing
  protein 3 (PNPLA3), abhydrolase containing domain 5 (ABDH5), adipose triglyceride
  lipase (ATGL), hydroxysteroid 17-β-dehydrogenase B13 (HSD17B13). Those proteins
  are associated with LDs which contain a core of neutral lipids (triglyceride, TG
  and cholesterol ester, CE). The VLDL pathway includes gatekeeper genes (microsomal
  triglyceride transfer protein, MTTP and apolipoprotein B, APOB, variants of which
  impair VLDL assembly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). MTTP is an endoluminal
  ER protein that functions as an obligate heteromeric complex with protein disulfide
  isomerase (PDI) and together promote lipidation and correct folding of the APOB
  protein around a core of neutral lipid transferred from membrane associated and
  intraluminal LD. In addition, variations in another transmembrane ER associated
  protein, transmembrane 6 superfamily 2 (TM6SF2) are associated with defective VLDL
  assembly and secretion (, ).
