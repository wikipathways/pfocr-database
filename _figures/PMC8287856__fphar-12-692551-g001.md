caption: Different response from the epithelium to lung injury in normal and IPF lung.
  In normal lung, the depletion of alveolar epithelial cells 1 (AECI) that play a
  pivotal role in gas exchange with the adjacent blood vessels after injuries, is
  compensated/replenished by/upon the differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells
  2 (AECII) in AECI, restoring the alveolar epithelium. In lung epithelium of IPF
  patients, the regeneration of AECI by AECII progenitors is compromised, leading
  to impaired alveolar re-epithelialization. Together with the aberrant repair mechanisms
  the AECs start to secrete pro-fibrotic mediators that through different molecular
  pathway and down-stream effectors lead to fibroblast migration, proliferation, activation
  and differentiation into myofibroblasts with deposition of exaggerated ECM that
  drastically compromise the lung biomechanics properties.
