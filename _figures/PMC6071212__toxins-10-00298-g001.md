caption: Paracellular and transcellular transport in the intestinal epithelium. The
  enterocytes form a polarized single cell layer. The apical side, characterized with
  villi, is in contact with the intestinal lumen. The epithelial cells are tied together
  by the tight junction complexes. Several transporter pathways facilitate transport
  from the apical to the basolateral side. Transcellular transport is mediated by
  active transporters or by endocytosis–transcytosis–exocytosis. Paracellular transport
  is via either the pore pathway or the leak pathway.
