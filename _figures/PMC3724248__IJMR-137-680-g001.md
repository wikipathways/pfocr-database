caption: MicroRNA pathway is universal to all mammalian miRNAs. MiRNAs are generated
  through two step processing that converts primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) by
  RNA polymerase II or III and cleavage of the pri-miRNA by the microprocessor complex
  Drosha– DGCR8 (Pasha) in the nucleus. The resulting miRNA is exported from the nucleus
  by Exportin-5-Ran-GTP. In the cytoplasm the RNase Dicer, in complex with the double-stranded
  RNA-binding protein TRBP, cleaves the pre-miRNA hairpin to its mature length. Association
  of the miRNA-RISC with a target mRNA results in the repression of the target gene
  by promoting mRNA degradation and/or translational inhibition.
