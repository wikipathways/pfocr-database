caption: 'String analysis was performed to study the protein-protein interaction.
  Downregulation of proteins differentially expressed in immunological failure HIV-1
  subtype-C patients as compared to ART-R. Briefly, protein-protein interaction revealed
  four clusters with distinct biological functions. Group 1: Molecules involved in
  viral transcription, viral genome expression, and translation termination or inhibition.
  Group 2: Molecule involved in the cell cycle process. Group3: CD4-positive, alpha-beta
  T-cell differentiation, and activation. Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1).
  Group 4: Integrin-mediated signaling pathway.'
