caption: Role of SHIP1 in bone biology. TGF-β and IGF signaling can be mediated via
  the PI3K pathway where AKT is regulated by both the SHIP1 substrate PI(3,4,5)P3
  and product PI(3,4)P2. AKT signalling leads to GSK3β inhibition, which increases
  β-catenin levels, and subsequently increases Id2 levels. The Smad pathway is also
  activated by the TGF-β receptor complex, which represses cbfa1 and osteocalcin,
  and thus inhibits osteoblast differentiation. The Smad complex can upregulate SHIP1,
  which binds to USP1 and blocks Id2. In the absence of SHIP1, USP1 deubiquitinates
  Id2 and prevents its degradation leading to increased MSC proliferation and less
  differentiation to OB.
