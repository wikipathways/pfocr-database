caption: 'Schematic overview of the vitamin C biosynthetic pathway from glucose-6-phosphate
  to ascorbic acid. In species capable of vitamin C synthesis, glucose-6-phosphate
  (Glucose-6-P) is enzymatically converted into glucose-1-phosphate (Glucose-1-P),
  followed by its transformation into L-gluconate and subsequently L-gulono-1,4-lactone.
  This final intermediate is oxidized to produce vitamin C (ascorbic acid) via the
  enzyme L-gulono-1,4-lactone oxidase (GULO), with regulatory support from regucalcin
  (RGN). In humans, genetic mutations have rendered GULO non-functional, thereby halting
  the final step and making the dietary intake of vitamin C essential. Abbreviations:
  Glucose-6-P: glucose-6-phosphate; Glucose-1-P: glucose-1-phosphate; RGN: regucalcin;
  GULO: L-gulono-1,4-lactone oxidase'
