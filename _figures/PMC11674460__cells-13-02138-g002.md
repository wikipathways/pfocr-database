caption: Schematic illustration of the molecular mechanism underlying the pleiotropic
  anticancer activity of As2O3 against GBM cells. As2O3 primarily targets mitochondria
  by inducing loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) associated with an imbalance
  of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, as well as upregulation of mitoferrin-2, which in turn causes
  ROS accumulation, ultimately leads to apoptosis induction and/or cell cycle arrest.
  Impacts of As2O3 on ROS elimination system such as anti-oxidative enzymes and GSH
  also contribute to ROS accumulation, which has been closely linked to DNA damage
  and inhibition of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Silencing of mitochondrial
  glutaminase (GA) and xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC), inhibition of Nrf2/HO-1,
  and knockdown of X box-binding protein-1 (XBP1), all of which contribute to maintain
  the redox balance, sensitize GBM cells to As2O3. As2O3 also triggers necrotic and
  autophagic cell death as evidenced by LDH leakage and restoration of cell viability
  by the addition of autophagy inhibitors, respectively. Of note, As2O3 triggers a
  cytocidal effect against GBM cells regardless of different p53 status (p53-w/p53-mut).
  Inhibition of the Notch1 signaling pathway and downregulation of VEGF, along with
  suppression of MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-9), contribute to As2O3-mediated cell cycle arrest,
  inhibition of migration/invasion, and angiogenesis
