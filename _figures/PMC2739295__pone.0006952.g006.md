caption: Several key players of the canonical Wnt pathway (green panel) were reported
  by our microarray to increase (red quadrangles) or decrease (blue quadrangles) in
  transcript levels under conditions of enhanced γ-secretase activity compared to
  inhibited activity. β-Catenin is a central node connecting Wnt–Frizzled–Dishevelled
  to a downstream effect influencing the cell cycle (see also  and interactions of
  encoded proteins). For better understanding, selected genes that were not detected
  by the microarray are displayed as well (dashed lines black quadrangles). CycD was
  reported to be regulated by PTPRG, one of the top scoring candidates for γ-secretase
  affected gene transcription. Nkd, which we found to be increased in transcript levels,
  connects the canonical Wnt pathway with the planar cell polarity pathway (blue panel).
  CD44, a well-known γ-secretase substrate, interacts with SPP1. SPP1 and UPP1, two
  strong candidates are both under the control of the same transcription factor Oct3/4,
  as has been suggested for TERA . UPP1 directly interacts with Vimentin (see also
  ), a known player in AD and a cytoskeletal protein. Crucial genes of the Wnt/Ca2+pathway
  (grey panel) were also found to be differentially expressed in our array. All together,
  γ-secretase activity influences the transcript levels of genes of the canonical,
  the planar cell polarity and Ca2+ Wnt pathways.
