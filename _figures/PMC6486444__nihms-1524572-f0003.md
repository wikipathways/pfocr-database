caption: A representation of the intracellular signaling pathways known to be activated
  by differentiation stimuli used in  and . Following suspension in methylcellulose,
  phosphorylation and signaling activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK) decreases. Phosphorylation and signaling activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) increases. This leads to activation of AP-1 transcription factors and subsequent
  transcriptional expression of differentiation markers. For cells plated at low confluency,
  exposure to extracellular calcium activates the G protein Gαq, which in turn activates
  phospholipase C gamma (PLC-γ). PLC-γ hydrolyzes the second messenger phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and activates a series of reactions that lead to the transcription
  of AP-1 subunits, AP-1 signaling and subsequent transcriptional expression of differentiation
  markers. For cells plated at high confluency, exposure to extracellular calcium
  leads to E-cadherin clustering, activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. PI3K activates PLC-γ and here, the
  pathway converges with that of low confluency cells treated with calcium terminating
  in AP-1 signaling and transcription of differentiation markers.
