caption: A new miR-585-5p/(CREB1/MAPK1/MITF) signalling pathway inhibits GC (GC) proliferative/metastatic
  properties. MiR-585-5p was downregulated in GC development, resulting in increased
  CREB1, MAPK1 and MITF expression. Expression of CREB1, MAPK1 and MITF was upregulated.
  In particular, upregulated CREB1 activated MITF transcription, further promoting
  MITF upregulation. MAPK1 phosphorylates the MITF protein at serine 73, which activates
  MITF pro-cancerous activity, promoting GC proliferative/metastatic properties.
