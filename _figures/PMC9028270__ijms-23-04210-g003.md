caption: Probable effect of PBM on cellular Wnt/β-catenin signalling in fibroblasts
  during diabetic chronic wound healing. Wnt/β-catenin signalling is reduced (OFF)
  in fibroblasts from chronic diabetic wounds. PBM initiates fibroblast increased
  mitochondrial activity, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric
  oxide (NO) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which activates nuclear gene transcription.
  Increased release of cytokines and growth factors including Wnt ligands activates
  Wnt/β-catenin signalling (ON) and cytoplasmic accumulation and translocation of
  β-catenin into the nucleus. In the nucleus, β-catenin forms an active transcriptional
  complex with T cell-specific factor (TCF) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1
  (LEF1) for protein transcription, resulting in cellular proliferation, migration
  and survival.
