caption: Activation of insulin receptor family members results in activation of protein
  kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt). (i) PKB/Akt signalling influences cell death
  by reducing mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, increasing hexokinase II (HKII) and
  inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activities. This prevents opening of
  the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Inhibition of FoxO transcription
  factors reduces expression of pro-apoptotic proteins. Signalling via mTORC1 inhibits
  autophagy via Ulk1. Activation of eNOS may reduce cell death, acting to promote
  vasodilation and, thus, reduce workload. It also reduces vascular inflammation.
  Phosphorylation of cGAS and STING inhibits interferon production. Increased flux
  through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) increases antioxidant capacity in the
  cell by increasing production of NADPH and glutathione (GSH). (ii) PKB/Akt increases
  metabolism, providing the cell with options for reducing oxygen needs whilst sustaining
  energy production, and maintaining antioxidant capability via the NADPH/glutathione
  system. Glucose uptake is increased by translocation of GLUT4 to the membrane. HKII
  increases availability of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) for both glycolysis and the
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Phosphorylation of the cardiac isoform of phosphofructokinase
  2 (PFKB2) inhibits the phosphatase activity, increasing production of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate,
  an allosteric activator of glycolysis. Glycogen storage is increased by GSK3 inhibition,
  providing a source of glucose during ischaemia. FoxO inhibition increases glucose
  metabolism.
