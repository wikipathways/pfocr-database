caption: The apoptotic pathway mainly includes TNF and Fas-mediated exogenous apoptotic
  pathway and mitochondrial-dependent endogenous pathway. Activation of caspase-3
  is the key mechanism of apoptosis. Autophagy relies on lysosomes digesting damaged
  proteins or organelles contained in autophagosomes. LC3 is considered to be an essential
  protein involved in it. GPX4 and GSH have a synergistic effect. Moreover, GPX4 can
  inhibit the conversion of PUFAs-OH to PUFAs-OOH, thus inhibiting lipid oxidation.
  GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; GSH, glutathione.
