caption: 'In response to tissue damage, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
  molecules including alarmins such as HMGB1 (high-mobility group protein B1) and
  HSPs (heat shock proteins) bind to and activate the TLR4 receptor (toll-like receptor
  4) on the surface of innate immune cells. The TLR4 signaling pathway is also induced
  by binding of LPS (lipopolysaccharide) to the TLR4 receptor and to co-receptors
  CD14 (cluster of differentiation 14) and MD2 (myeloid differentiation factor 2).
  The TLR4 receptor engages a complex signaling cascade (only partially represented)
  leading to the activation of the p38 (phosphorylated P38 mitogen-activated protein
  kinase) and ERK/MAP (extracellular regulated kinase and mitogen activated protein
  kinase) and the NFκB (phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
  activated B cells) signaling pathways. Signaling proteins that changed significantly
  in response to surgery are indicated by blue circles. A subset of signaling proteins
  modulated after surgery (MAPKAPK2, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein
  kinase 2; rpS6, ribosomal protein S6; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein)
  overlapped with pre-surgical signaling responses that correlated with surgical recovery
  parameters and are indicated by red circles. Other abbreviations: MEKKs, mitogen
  activated protein kinase kinase kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; IκB, inhibitor of NFκB.'
