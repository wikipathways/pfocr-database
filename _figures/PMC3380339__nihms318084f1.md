caption: Recent evidence suggests that ASC has an inflammasome-independent role in
  the activation of MAP kinase and NF-κB signaling, which leads to the transcriptional
  activation of a panel of cytokines and chemokines. Inflammasome NLRs, including
  NLRP3 and NLRC5, and the inflammasome viral DNA sensors AIM2 and RIG-I have also
  been shown to influence the activation of NF-κB and subsequent activation of cytokine
  transcription. Additional evidence suggests that AIM2 may directly affect the induction
  of IFN-α by viruses through interaction with the RIG-I/MAVS complex. Recent evidence
  also suggests that caspase-1 may influence the production of additional cytokines
  that are processed through the unconventional secretory pathway.
