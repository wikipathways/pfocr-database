caption: A hypothetical model of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) intracellular
  cascade in the insecticide resistance of insects, according to the hypothetical
  pathway constructed for GPCRs in human cells [] and in mosquitoes [,,]. The constitutive
  expressed GPCR in resistant mosquitoes activates the G-protein alpha s-subunit (Gαs),
  which stimulates adenylate cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP. cAMP activates the protein
  kinase A, which is involved in the increased expression of cytochrome P450 genes
  [,], resulting in elevating the detoxification ability of insects to insecticides.
  Inhibitions of cAMP production or PKA activity can interrupt this regulation pathway;
  the decreased production of cAMP or PKA activity is strongly associated with the
  decreased expression of resistance-related P450 genes and increased sensitivity
  to insecticides in both mosquitoes [,].
