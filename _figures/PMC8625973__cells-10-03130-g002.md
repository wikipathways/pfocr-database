caption: 'Aberration of the core Hippo pathway components in cancer. (A) Aberrant
  expression of Hippo components in cancer. Tumour suppressor such as MST/LATS were
  found to be downregulated at the mRNA and protein level in various cancers, while
  oncogenic YAP/TAZ were found to be upregulated with tumour progression. (B) Genetic
  aberrations of the Hippo pathway in cancer. Examples of genetic aberrations: gene
  amplification, gene fusion, gene deletion and promoter methylation. Created with
  BioRender.com.'
