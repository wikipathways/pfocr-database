caption: Autophagy is a pro-tumorigenic pathway in transformed cells, helping them
  survive. Within cancer cells, autophagy removes detrimentally damaged mitochondria
  and helps relieve ER-stress. Autophagy is also responsible for the removal of toxic,
  misfolded proteins. The recycling of proteins, lipid droplets, glycogen and ribosomes
  by autophagy promotes energy metabolism and anabolic synthesis by providing substrates
  for metabolic pathways. In addition, certain cancer cells like pancreatic ductal
  adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells induce autophagy in neighboring stromal cells, pancreatic
  stellate cells (PSCs) in the case of PDAC. The degradation of proteins by autophagy
  in PSCs promotes alanine production and secretion. PDACs import alanine, which may
  be channeled into protein synthesis or, more importantly, be converted to pyruvate.
  This allows an external source for pyruvate and subsequent mitochondrial energy
  production, thereby allowing PDACs to utilize glycolytic intermediates for nucleotide
  synthesis and anaplerotic reactions that fuel growth (see text for details).
