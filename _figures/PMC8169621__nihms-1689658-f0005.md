caption: Schematic of the muscle spindle (top) and potential signaling pathway for
  synaptic-like vesicle released glutamate (bottom; modified from ()). Muscle stretch
  opens PIEZO2 which allows both Na+ and Ca++ entry into the cell and is likely one
  of the primary drivers of membrane depolarization during the dynamic phase of stretch.
  Ca++ can cause the fusion of glutamate containing synaptic-like vesicles and the
  released glutamate likely binds to a receptor on the afferent membrane. Potential
  candidates are a phospholipase-D coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor (PLD mGluR;
  ()) or metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5; ()). Glutamate binding leads to
  additional depolarizing current potentially by increasing the activity of voltage-gated
  sodium channels, possibly NaV1.6, NaV1.7, and/or NaV1.1, which are all located in
  the afferent endings (). Alternatively, glutamate increases depolarization via another
  unidentified mechanism. Figure created using BioRender.com.
