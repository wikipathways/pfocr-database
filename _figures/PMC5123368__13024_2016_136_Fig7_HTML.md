caption: Schematic presentation shows the Adiponectin signaling pathway in neuron
  under normal (left) and disease (right) conditions. We proposed that APN deficiency
  leads to decreased AMPK activation in neurons and increased IRS-1 phosphorylation
  at serine616 which inhibits the formation of pIRS-1Tyr. Cerebral insulin resistance
  is progressively developed and thereby causing the reduced level of pAktS473. The
  GSK3α/β become activated and may promote formation of Aβ oligomers and Tau phosphorylation.
  The accumulation of extracellular Aβ oligomers may induce M1 microglial reactivation
  and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that associated with neuronal apoptosis
  and synaptic loss, and subsequently cognitive decline in aged APN-KO mice

  impairments and pathologies through AMPK inactivation and cerebral insulin resistance
