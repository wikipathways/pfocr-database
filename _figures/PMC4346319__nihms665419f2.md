caption: '(A) Inflammation. HIF-1α and NF-κB crosstalk regulates essential inflammatory
  functions in myeloid cells. HIF-1α increases macrophage aggregation, invasion, and
  motility and drives the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. HIF-1α also increases
  neutrophil survival by inhibiting apoptosis and triggers NF-κB-dependent neutrophilic
  inflammation. (B) Infection. HIF-1α increases intracellular bacterial killing by
  macrophages and also promotes granule protease production and release of nitric
  oxide (NO) and TNF-α, which in turn further contribute in antimicrobial control.
  (C) Cancer. As a result of hypoxia, HIF-1α is stabilized in cancer cells, increasing
  the production of chemotactic factors like CCL5, CXCL12, VEGF, endothelins ET-1
  and ET-2, and semaphorin3A (Sema3A), which result in myeloid cell recruitment to
  the tumor. Once located in 31 hypoxic regions, tumor-associated macrophages stabilize
  HIF-1α, which contributes to tumor-promoting inflammation, angiogenesis, and impaired
  lymphocyte function. (D) Metabolism. HIF-1α in myeloid cells increases the transcription
  of key glycolytic enzymes, resulting on increased glucose uptake and glycolytic
  rate. Importantly, pyruvate entry in the citric acid cycle (TCA) is inhibited and
  converted to lactate, which is released to the extracellular compartment. This metabolic
  adaptation results in a decreased O2 consumption by limiting the rate of oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS). M1 and M2 polarized macrophages show different metabolic
  pathway preferences: whereas M1 rely on glycolysis as energy source, M2 have steady
  OXPHOS metabolism.'
