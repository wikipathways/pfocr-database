caption: Mechanisms of RS-induced accumulation of cytosolic (self-) DNA. Self DNA
  accumulates in the cytosol when mammalian cells are exposed to RS-inducing agents
  (e.g., HU, APH, CPT) or when cells are deficient for factors promoting replication
  fork stability (e.g., SAMHD1). The release of genomic DNA occurs in two different
  ways. (i) DNA fragments (ssDNA and dsDNA) are released from stalled forks by nucleolytic
  cleavage (MRE11 and MUS81). The mechanism by which these fragments exit the nucleus
  is currently unknown, but it is repressed by RPA and RAD51. TREX1 is the major cytosolic
  exonuclease that degrades DNA to prevent the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway.
  (ii) Incomplete replication, known as under-replication, induces chromosome segregation
  defects and leads to the formation of micronuclei and to other mitotic defects.
  Upon rupture of their membrane, cGAS localizes to micronuclei and activates STING.
  Whether TREX1 or other nucleases can access DNA inside micronuclei is not known.
