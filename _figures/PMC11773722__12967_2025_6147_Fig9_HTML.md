caption: Graphical summary of disrupted immune and structural milieu in the intestinal
  epithelium of Mpj and Lpr mice. A conspicuous imbalance in CD8 + IEL was observed
  in Lpr mice, characterized by a notable reduction in CD8αα + IELs and a significant
  elevation in CD8αβ + IELs. Additionally, intercellular communication patterns based
  on CellChat between intestinal epithelial immune and structural cells were found
  to be specifically altered in Lpr mice. pDC and cDC act as the central communication
  hub, engaging in interactions with IELs and structural cells. It was noted that
  the TGFb/IL16/CXCL signaling pathway, which is initiated by DCs and affects CD8 + IELs,
  demonstrated a reduced interaction in Lpr mice. KIT signaling, originating from
  enterocyte and targeting CD8αα + IEL, exhibited diminishing interactions in Lpr
  mice. WNT signaling, initiated by enteroendocrine cells and affects tuft cells,
  also demonstrated reduced interaction in Lpr mice. Augmented signaling in Lpr mice
  included SEMA3/ANGPTL/PARs signaling. Of note, the main sources of PARs signaling
  were cDC in Mpj mice and pDC in Lpr mice. Furthermore, a marked reduction in γδT
  cells was observed in Lpr mice, which was associated with reduced AHRR expression
  and subsequent oxidative stress and ferroptosis, and increased IFN-γ levels in the
  intestines of Lpr mice contributed to the reduced expression of AHRR. Antioxidant
  selenium effectively reversed the loss of γδT in Lpr mice. TGFb, transforming growth
  factor β; CXCL, C-X-C motif ligand; SEMA3, semaphorin 3; ANGPTL, angiopoietin-like
  proteins; PARs, protease-activated receptors; Ahrr, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor;
  DC, dendritic cells; Se, selenium
