caption: Schematic representation of the main therapeutic approaches against melanoma.
  (A) The RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway is often upregulated in melanoma, with a consequent
  increase in cell proliferation and survival. Pharmacological inhibition of mutant
  BRAF or kinase MEK1/2 blocks the MAPK pathway. (B) Activation of T cells requires
  presentation of the tumor antigen to the T-cell receptor (TCR) through the major
  histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the interaction of CD28 with B7 ligand, present
  on the surface of dendritic cells. T cells also express CTLA-4, whose binding to
  B7 triggers the signal to inactivate T cells. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies inhibit the
  interaction between CTLA-4 and B7, leading to T cell activation. (C) Melanoma cells
  can express high levels of PD-L1, which, through the interaction with the PD-1 receptor
  on the T cells, causes a reduction in T cell function. Blockade of the PD-L1/PD-1
  axis with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors restores the ability of
  T cells to recognize and destroy melanoma cells.
