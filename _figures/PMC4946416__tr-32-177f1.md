caption: The PI3K/PKB/mTOR signaling pathway regulates cancer cell metabolism. PKB
  upregulates glycolysis by affecting glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and activating
  hexokinase 2 (HK2) association with the mitochondria. Moreover, PKB regulates de
  novo fatty acid synthesis and the usage of fatty acid for β-oxidation. It phosphorylates
  ATP citratelyase (ACL) to supply downstream de novo fatty acid synthesis (). Phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) and PKB suppress the expression of the β-oxidation enzyme carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), suppressing β-oxidation and impairing mitochondria.
  mTOR, a downstream effector of the PI3K/PKB pathway, is regulated by AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK; the cellular energy sensor), the tuberous sclerosis 1 & 2
  (TSC1/TSC2) complex, and Ras homolog enriched in brain (RHEB). Most importantly,
  mTOR is an upstream activator of HIF-1α in cancer cells (), which is a subunit of
  a transcription factor that upregulates the expression of nearly all of the genes
  involved in the glycolytic pathway (See details in the text (Section 1-4-1)). Arrows
  represent stimulation/activation, and ends represent inhibition.
