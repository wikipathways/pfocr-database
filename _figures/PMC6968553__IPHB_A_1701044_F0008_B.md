caption: Schematic diagram of the potential ML-induced apoptotic pathway in ovarian
  cancer cells. ML inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway and nuclear translocation of NF-κB,
  activates p21 and p27, and induces downregulation of the antiapoptotic factors Bcl-2
  and Bcl-xL. The collapse of the MMP triggers an influx of cytochrome c into cytosol
  and induces activation of caspase-3 and -9 and PARP. Thus, ML induces cell cycle
  arrest and apoptosis via repression of the PI3K/Akt pathway and activation of the
  intrinsic apoptotic pathway via an imbalance in the members of the Bcl-2 family.
  Arrows indicate activation of the ML-induced signalling pathways; the closed lines
  indicate suppression by the ML-induced signal.
