caption: The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Multiple inflammatory stimuli
  activate the NFκB system and lead to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from
  innate immune cells. For example, interaction of bacterial LPS with Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) on the monocyte surface induces a pro-inflammatory response characterized
  by the production and release of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines[]. The α7
  nAChR-dependent cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, triggered endogenously by
  acetylcholine or exogenously by nicotine, can suppress the production of several
  pro-inflammatory cytokines in activated monocytic cells (see Figure )[,,,,]. Such
  nicotine-mediated suppression of TNF in vivo protects mice from endotoxic shock[,].
  The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway acts at both the transcriptional and post-translational
  levels. Engagement of the α7 nAChR results in the rapid suppression of the release
  of pre-formed pro-inflammatory cytokines[,,-]. Engagement of the α7 nAChR also results
  in inactivation of the NFκB system, preventing the upregulation of pro-inflammatory
  gene activity[]. There is a need to further explore the signaling within the cholinergic
  anti-inflammatory pathway. In macrophages, the nicotine-induced suppression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokine release involves recruitment of the tyrosine kinase Jak2 to the α7 nACh
  receptor, the subsequent phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3, and
  the activation of STAT3 and SOC3 signaling cascade[]. We have shown the potential
  convergence of the nicotinic anti-inflammatory and an endogenous, GSK-3-dependent
  anti-inflammatory pathway[] in monocytes (see Figure ).
