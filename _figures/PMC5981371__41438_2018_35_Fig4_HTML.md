caption: Three boxes that are arranged in the same row indicate comparisons of LM_LS4/LM_LS1,
  WD_LS4/WD_LS1, and LM_LS4/WD_LS4, respectively. The layers of boxes represent different
  gene copies, which are listed in a numerical order from top to bottom. LM_LS4/LM_LS1
  and WD_LS4/WD_LS1 represent comparison of gene expression levels in leaves of cvs.
  LM and WD, respectively, between stages 1 and 4, while LM_LS4/ WD_LS4 indicates
  comparison of gene expression levels at stage 4 between cvs. LM and WD. The arrows
  with broken lines indicate multi-enzymatic reactions. PEP phosphoenolpyruvate, E4P
  d-erythrose 4-phosphate, DAHPS 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase,
