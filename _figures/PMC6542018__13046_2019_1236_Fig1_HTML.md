caption: Estrogen receptor (ER) activity in breast cancer - canonical (classical;
  ligand-mediated) and non-canonical (alternative; ligand-independent) pathways of
  ER activation. a In the canonical model, estrogen binds to ER, which results in
  receptor dimerization, subsequent translocation to the nucleus and binding to specific
  genomic sequences i.e. estrogen responsive elements. Activated ER interacts with
  co-regulators, that modulate target genes expression. This is followed by ER ubiquitination
  and degradation via a 26-proteasome complex. In the non-canonical pathways (b-d),
  activity of ER is regulated in a ligand-independent manner by stimuli (FGFs) from
  the tumour microenvironment (TME). Binding of FGFs to their cognate receptors, FGFRs,
  induces FGFRS-triggered signalling, which targets ER. b FGF3/FGFR1-triggered signalling
  leads to induction of ER-FGFR1 complex formation, which binds to unknown genomic
  sequences and regulates expression of ER-dependent genes. c FGF10/FGFR2-activated
  pathway strengthens the interaction between ER and two transcription factors (NFIB
  and YBX1), which upon binding to ER-FOXA1 suppress ER-dependent gene expression,
  d FGF7/FGFR2-dependent activation of PI3K/AKT induces ER phosphorylation, enhanced
  ER transcriptional activity and increased ER degradation. E – estrogen; ER – estrogen
  receptor; ERE – estrogen responsive element; Ub - ubiquitin
