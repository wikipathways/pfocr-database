caption: Subcellular localization and roles of HO-1. 1. HO-1 locates in endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), mitochondria, plasma membrane, and the caveolae. HO-1 is fixed on
  the membrane by a transmembrane sequence (TMS) and stabilized by cytochrome P450
  reductase (CPR) to prevent relocation. It remains full protein structure and enzymatic
  activity and its function is achieved mainly through enzymatic activity. Its enzymatic
  products CO, BV, and BR have been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant,
  cell cycle regulation properties; 2. HO-1 will be truncated and relocated under
  pathological conditions or external stimuli which leads to cellular stress. Truncated
  HO-1 lacks enzyme activity to degrade heme and may act as a chaperone to regulate
  the activity of signaling pathway proteins or as a transcription factor regulator.
