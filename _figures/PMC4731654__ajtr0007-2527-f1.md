caption: Signaling pathways involved in the BMP induced osteogenesis, BMPs bind to
  receptors on cells to activate downstream signal molecules such as Smads, MAPK and
  JNK. In the classic Smads signaling pathway, Smads protein is phosphorylated, leading
  to its activation. Activated Smads cooperate with Runx2 and then translocate into
  the nucleus to induce the transcriptional expression of osteogenesis related genes.
