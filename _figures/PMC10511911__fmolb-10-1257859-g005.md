caption: The regulation of insecticide resistance mechanisms involves epi-transcriptome
  signals, detoxification signaling pathways, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).
  (A) lncRNAs influence miRNA-mediated insecticide resistance regulation. Regulation
  mechanisms include lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction and lncRNA-mediated regulation
  of miRNA expression. GSTu1, a detoxifying gene, is involved in the chlorantraniliprole
  resistance of P. xylostella. A long non-coding RNA, lnc-GSTu1-AS, interacted with
  GSTu1 by forming an RNA duplex, masking the binding site of microRNA, miR-8525-5p,
  at the GSTu1-3′ UTR. lnc-GSTu1-AS maintained the mRNA stability of GSTu1 by preventing
  its degradation, which could have been induced by miR-8525-5p and thus resulting
  in increased production of detoxification gene (GSTu1), increased the resistance
  of P. xylostella to chlorantraniliprole. (B) Detoxification enzyme induction pathway.
  This pathway involves upregulating detoxification enzymes, such as cytochrome P450
  monooxygenases, esterases, and glutathione S-transferases. They are the CncC/Keap1,
  NR, PKA, MAPK/CREB, and AhR/ARNT pathways. The activated molecules of these pathways,
  such as Cncc/maf, TF, CREB, Ahr/AHRNT, and HR96/HRE, respectively, in the cytoplasm,
  interact with their corresponding response element in the nucleus to regulate the
  expression of detoxification genes through transcription. The arrows indicate the
  cascade of effectors in the signaling pathway. (C) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a
  modified form of adenosine widely involved in gene expression regulation. Mutation
  (T to A at position-206 bp) was observed in the 5′UTR of CYP4C64 that was observed
  at a much greater frequency in the thiamethoxam-resistant strains compared with
  the susceptible strain. The T at 206 bp helps bind m6A, and the overexpression of
  the enzyme METTL (methyltransferase) led to the development of thiamethoxam-resistant
  insects. CncC, Cap‘n’ Collar isoform C; Maf, Musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma; ARE,
