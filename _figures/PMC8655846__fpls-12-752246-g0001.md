caption: Illustrative representation of crosstalk among Ca2+signaling components under
  the salt-stressed condition. During the salt-stressed condition, Na+ is transported
  into the cytoplasm through different plasma membrane-localized channels leading
  to a spike in [Ca2+]cyt, which activates SOS pathway and PA-mediated signaling,
  necessary for extrusion of Na+ from the cytosol to the vacuole and extracellular
  space and subsequent stress-responsive gene expression for production of osmoprotectants,
  ROS, nitric oxide, and polyamines. The solid arrow represents direct activation;
  the dotted arrow represents indirect activation via some intermediates. NCL-Na+/Ca2+exchanger
  like protein, HKT, high-affinity K+ transport, FER-FERONIA, PCphosphatidylcholine;
  SOS, salt overlay sensitive; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
