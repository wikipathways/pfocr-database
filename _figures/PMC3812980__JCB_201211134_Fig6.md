caption: Proposed schema of how the BMP signaling axis limits neurogenic muscle wasting.
  In muscles undergoing neurogenic atrophy, the transcription of BMP ligands GDF5
  (BMP14) and GDF6 (BMP13) is increased prominently within skeletal muscle, along
  with transcription of the type-IB BMP receptor (ALK6) and suppression of the endogenous
  inhibitor Smad6. The net effect is an increase in Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation. Expression
  of Smad6 in denervated skeletal muscle exacerbates wasting by suppressing Smad1/5/8
  phosphorylation, which in turn potentiates the HDAC4–myogenin pathway, leading to
  increased transcription of E3 ubiquitin ligases associated with muscle proteolysis,
  including MuRF1, atrogin1, and Fbxo30/MUSA1.

  muscle mass.
