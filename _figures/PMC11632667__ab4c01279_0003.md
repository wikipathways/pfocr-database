caption: 1) BMPs activates the SMAD pathway, which increases inflammatory cytokines
  VEGF, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6).104 2) BMPs
  recruit mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are differentiated into osteoblasts
  and chondrocytes, leading to increased endochondral ossification.105 3) BMPs induce
  the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway,
  which increases receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) and stimulates
  osteoclast activation.106 4) BMPs induce the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  gamma (PPARγ) signaling pathway, which increases adipogenesis and fat deposition.107
