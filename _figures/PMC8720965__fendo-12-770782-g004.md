caption: 'The alternative or “backdoor” pathway of androgen synthesis and the 11-oxygentaed
  androgens. In the “backdoor” pathway, progesterone is converted to 5α-dihydroprogesterone
  (DHP) by 5α-reductase type 1 (5α-Red 1) and subsequently reduced to allopregnanolone
  by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) encoded by either AKR1C2 or AKR1C4.
  Similarly, 17-hysroxyprogetserone (17OH-progesterone) is converted to 5α-17-hydroxy
  DHP and to 17hydroxy-allopregnanolone (17OH Allopregnanolone). Cytochrome P450c17,
  though its 17,20 lyase activity, catalyzes 17OH Allopregnanolone conversion to androsterone.
  Subsequently, androsterone can be metabolized by adrenal 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  type 5 (17βHSD5) to yield androstanediol, which is oxidized by 3α-HSD encoded by
  AKR1C2 and finally transformed to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 17βHSD type 6 (also
  known as retinol dehydrogenase or RoDH), without involving testosterone. Blockage
  of cortisol synthesis resulting in the accumulation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and
  androstenedione leads to the synthesis of 11-oxygenated androgens: the 11β-hydroxylase
  activity of cytochrome P450c11β catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione and
  testosterone to 11-hydroxyandrostenedione (11OH-androstenedione) and 11-hydroxytestosterone
  (11OH-testosterone), respectively. Subsequently, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  type 2 (11βHSD2) converts them to 11keto-androstenedione and 11keto-testosterone.
  Finally, 5α-Red 1 leads to the synthesis of 11-hydroxy-DHT and 11-keto-DHT.'
