caption: A diagram presentation of the molecular mechanism. In BC cells, adMSC-Exos
  convey miR-1236 to suppress the mRNA expression of SLC9AQ. SLC9A1 is a positive
  regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which promotes nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin and CCND1 expression, therefore leading to proliferation and DDP resistance
  of BC cells. The adMSC-Exos have anti-proliferation and anti-DDP resistance roles
  in BC.
