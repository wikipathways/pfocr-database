caption: 'Schematic representation of metabolite labeling from [1-13C]glucose during
  the first tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle turn. In astrocytes, [1-13C]glucose follows
  either the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH; ) or the pyruvate carboxylase (PC; ), but
  only the PDH pathway occurs in neurons. At the end of the glycolysis, [1-13C]glucose
  provides [3-13C]pyruvate which can take two paths: either pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH; ) or pyruvate carboxylase (PC; ). In the PDH pathway, [3-13C]pyruvate gives
  [2-13C]AcCoA which enters in the TCA cycle and leads to [4-13C]citrate, then to
  [4-13C] αKG. This intermediate αKG forms [4-13C]glutamate, which is metabolized
  in [4-13C]glutamine. Through TCA cycle, by the symmetry of some intermediates, [4-13C]αKG
  gives two isotopomers of OAA: [2-13C]OAA (50%) and [3-13C]OAA (50%). Then, it provides
  Asparate labeled in [2-13C] (50%) and [3-13C](50%). In the PC pathway (only in astrocyte
  compartment), [3-13C]pyruvate is converted in [3-13C]OAA which enters TCA cycle
  to form [2-13C]αKetoGlu which leads to [2-13C]glutamate and then to [2-13C]glutamine.
