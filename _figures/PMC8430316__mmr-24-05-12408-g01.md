caption: Possible mechanism of tumor-mediated CAA formation. () In tumor cells, overexpressed
  IL-6 binds to adipocyte gp130 and enhances ATGL-mediated lipolysis via the AMPK
  pathway. Furthermore, activation of the STAT3 pathway increases SOCS3 expression,
  which promotes lipid decomposition while inhibiting lipid synthesis. The activation
  of the STAT3 pathway also increases the expression of PRDM16. () Tumor-derived ZAG
  binds to β3AR to stimulate lipid decomposition by upregulating the levels of ATGL,
  HSL and phosphorylated ACC through the MAPK signaling pathway. () TNF-α induces
  iNOS/NO in adipose tissue, leading to an increased cAMP and cGMP levels. In addition,
  the ERK1/2 and JNK-mediated reduction of PDE3B and PLIN expression enhances the
  phosphorylation of HSL and decreases the number and size of lipid droplets. () PAI-1
  activates the LRP-1-dependent PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and promotes the activation
  of PLOD2 in CAAs, leading to collagen remodeling and extracellular matrix recombination.
  () Wnt3a enhances downstream Wnt10b transcription through ectopic accumulation of
  β-catenin in the nucleus. TNF-α can also upregulate miRNA-130 expression via the
  NF-κB pathway, which acts synergistically with Wnt10b to inhibit the transcription
  of PPARγ and dedifferentiate adipocytes. () Tumor-derived miR-105 activates MYC
  signaling and induces metabolic changes in adipocytes. miR-122 reduces the inhibitory
  effect of GEPK on glucose uptake. miR-126 upregulates HIF-1 and MCT4 protein expression
  and induces metabolic remodeling of adipocytes. The p38-ERK1/2-mediated lipolysis
  is induced by AE. ciRS-133 activates PRDM16 to promote adipocyte browning. () Adipocyte-derived
  IL-8 maintains the activation of CAAs, and adipocyte-derived MMP11 dedifferentiates
  adipocytes via blocking PPARγ. CAAs, cancer-associated adipocytes; gp130, glycoprotein
