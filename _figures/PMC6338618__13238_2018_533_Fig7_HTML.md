caption: Proposed model for the role of inhibition of BCLM by Ponatinib. By using
  gene signature based drug screen strategy, a series of potential anti-breast cancer
  lung metastasis (BCLM) drugs were found. Among these drugs, Ponatinib inhibits c-Jun
  function by repressing mRNA transcription and accelerating degradation of c-Jun
  protein via ERK/c-Jun signal pathway. Through c-Jun, Ponatinib down regulates 4
  BCLM related gene expression, finally inhibits BCLM in mouse models
