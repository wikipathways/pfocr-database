caption: (A) Oxidative stress response. Following entry of Mtb into host cells results
  in the generation of oxidative stress responses. Mtb employs several strategies
  to combat these stress mechanisms, which includes activation of anti-oxidant enzymes
  (like superoxide dismutase, catalase/peroxidase, etc.), redox-sensors (like DosR
  regulon system) and redox buffering system. Phagocytosis of Mtb leads to formation
  of superoxide radical via NADPH oxidase. As evasion strategy, Mtb genes reduce the
  superoxide radical into less toxic intermediates using anti-oxidant enzymes. The
  pathway eventually inhibits the process of autophagy, apoptosis and cellular damage.
  (B) Mycobacterial oxidative stress response gene family protein, WhiB, combats the
  redox and nitrosative stress via the Fe–S clusters while DosS and T gene from DosR
  regulon senses the redox imbalance and activates the DosR to furtheractivate the
  dormancy pathway.
