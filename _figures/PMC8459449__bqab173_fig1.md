caption: 'Intersection of the metabolic amplifying pathway of insulin secretion and
  β cell rest. Metabolism of nutrients through glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle feed pathways generating metabolites including phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP),
  ATP, isocitrate, as well as intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway and nucleotide
  biosynthesis pathways. The enzyme SCS-GTP generates succinate and GTP; this GTP,
  combined with oxaloacetate from the TCA cycle, is converted to PEP by PEP carboxykinase
  (PEPCK-M or Pck2). Recent work showed that membrane-localized pyruvate kinase (PKM2)
  converts this PEP to ATP, depleting local ADP concentrations, and promoting the
  closure of KATP channels and subsequent membrane depolarization. Another highlighted
  pathway is that of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), which converts glutamine to α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG) in the mitochondria. There, α-KG may fuel the generation of other TCA cycle
  intermediates or be converted into isocitrate to replenish the downstream reducing
  equivalent glutathione (GSH), which is required for deSUMOylation of exocytotic
  proteins. The glycerolipid (GL) cycle also feeds into metabolic amplification via
  supplying 1-monoacylglycerol, which acts directly on exocytotic machinery to promote
  secretion. Fatty-acyl-CoAs (FA-CoAs) are also released and/or reach the β cell from
  the circulation to activate the free fatty acid receptors 1/4 (FFAR1/4), GPCRs that
  promote ER calcium release. Additionally, glycerol-3-phosphate (Gro3P) derived from
  glycolysis can be degraded by glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase (G3PP) to regulate
  the impact of Gro3P on insulin secretion. There are direct and indirect therapeutic
  strategies that aim to reduce the insulin secretory demand on β cells (ie, β-cell
  rest, highlighted in yellow). These include, but are not necessarily limited to:
  (1) the use of diazoxide to open KATP channels and prevent membrane depolarization
  even in the face of increased glucose concentrations; (2) targeting of β-cell calcium
  channels to directly prevent calcium influx-mediated exocytosis; (3) glucokinase
  inhibitors (GKis) that could reduce metabolic flux of glucose into glycolysis and
  the TCA cycle, but also lead to improved secretory regulation; and (4) intensive
  insulin treatments or sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), each of
  which results in a decrease in circulating glucose and therefore indirectly alleviate
  the demand on β cells. Supporting references are provided in the text. The arrow
  from GKi to GK is red and green, indicating it suppresses β-cell insulin secretory
  activity but also enhances β-cell glucose dose-response.'
