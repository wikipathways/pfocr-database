caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of action of Piezo1 in cardiac fibroblasts.
  Mechanical stress induces Piezo1 opening in fibroblasts and promotes IL-6 expression
  via the p38α MAPK signaling pathway. Mechanical stretch induces fibroblasts to secrete
  natriuretic peptides and ECM, and the increase in matrix stiffness may further upregulate
  Piezo1 expression and promote fibrosis progression (created with https://www.figdraw.com/static/index.html
