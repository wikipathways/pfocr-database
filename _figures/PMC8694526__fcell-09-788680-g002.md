caption: 'Signal passways in the process of osteoclastogenesis under the stimulation
  of M-CSF. PI3K-Akt pathway: M-CSF binds to its receptor c-Fms, induces partial phosphorylation
  of key sites in the c-Fms tail, and recruits the tyrosine kinase c-Src. The partially
  phosphorylated receptor binds to c-Src to form a c-Fms/c-Src Protein complex. Then
  the complex recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase (c-Cbl) and causes it to undergo tyrosine
  phosphorylation. As a response, the phosphorylated c-Cbl causes receptor ubiquitination,
  which further causes the receptor to be completely phosphorylated. Subsequently,
  the c-Fms/c-Src protein complex recruits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to
  trigger the PI3K-Akt pathway for OCPs activation and proliferation. MAPK pathway:
  After the receptor was stimulated, the receptor associated Grb2/Sos activates the
  MAPK signaling cascade, which conclusively leads to the phosphorylation and activation
  of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to promote the formation of osteoclasts.
  Co-Stimulatory pathway: M-CSF also promotes the co-stimulatory pathway of nuclear
  factor activated T cells 1 (NFATc1). M-CSF can activate the Fc receptor common gamma
  subunit (FcRγ) and dnax activation protein 12 (DAP12), which further activate the
  tyrosine kinase Syk. Syk forms a complex with Btk/Tec, BLNK/SLP76. The complex further
  activates PLCγ, initiates the PLC pathway, and dephosphorylates the transcription
  factor NFATc1 to promote its entry into the nucleus and induce the differentiation
  of precursor cells into osteoclasts.'
