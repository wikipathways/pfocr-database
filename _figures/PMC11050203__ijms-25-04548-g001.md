caption: 'Schematic diagram of activated signaling pathways: (a) the Wnt signaling
  pathway is activated in the presence of Wnt. When Wnt binds to the Frizzled receptor,
  it dimerizes with LRP5/6, leading to the recruitment of the Axin/GSK3/APC/CK1 complex
  to the cell membrane. This results in the translocation of β-catenin from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus. In the nucleus, β-catenin interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors,
  thereby inducing the expression of downstream target genes. (b) The PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway is activated when a ligand binds to receptors such as RTK. Activated
  PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to convert it to PIP3. Then, PIP3 activates downstream
  genes, such as AKT and mTOR. (c) The MAPK signaling pathway is initiated when a
  ligand binds to RTK, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of MAP3K. Activated
  MAP3K phosphorylates the downstream MAP2K, which in turn phosphorylates MAPK. This
  phosphorylation cascade transmits signals from the cell surface receptor to the
  nucleus, influencing gene expression by activating various kinases, enzymes, and
  transcription factors downstream. (d) The TGF-β signaling pathway is activated when
  TGF-β directly or indirectly binds to TGF-βR II. TGF-βR II recruits and phosphorylates
  TGF-βR I, which, in turn, phosphorylates R-SAMD. The phosphorylated R-SMAD then
  forms a trimeric complex with Co-SMAD. This complex translocates to the nucleus,
  where it acts as a transcription factor, influencing gene expression. (e) The p53
  signaling pathway is initiated when p53 remains stabilized due to its failure to
  bind with MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This stabilization of p53 leads to the induction
  of downstream gene expression, resulting in the activation of the pathway. Wnt signaling
