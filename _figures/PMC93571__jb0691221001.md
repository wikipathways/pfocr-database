caption: 'The Met regeneration pathway. The cycle functions to recycle Met (top of
  figure) for use as an aminopropyl donor in polyamine synthesis. The enzymes involved
  are as follows: 1, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase; 2, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase;
  3, spermidine/spermine synthetase; 4, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase; 4a, methylthioadenosine
  nucleosidase; 4b, methylthioribose kinase; 5, undetermined isomerase; 6, undetermined
  dehydratase; 7a and 7b, bifunctional E-1 enolase-phosphatase; and 8a, E-2 dioxygenase.
  The reaction labelled 8 occurs nonenzymatically in K. pneumoniae and via the E-3
  dioxygenase in rat liver (). The reaction catalyzed by 4 occurs in eukaryotes, and
  those catalyzed by 4a and 4b occur in prokaryotes. The final step, labelled KMAT
  (KMTB to Met aminotransferase), is the subject of the present study.'
