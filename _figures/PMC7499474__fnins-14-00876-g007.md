caption: Venn diagram describing the different VIP metabolites in two distinctive
  brain tissues after traumatic brain injury (TBI) on day 7. (A) A Venn diagram indicates
  the different metabolites corresponding to two brain tissues, showing with blue
  arrows the upregulated or downregulated cortical metabolites and red ones for those
  of the hippocampus. The overlap display shows that the two metabolites are both
  in response to subacute TBI in the two brain tissues, with different trends. (B)
  Pathway topology analysis associated with betaine in glycine, serine, and threonine
  metabolism was carried out by a metaboanalyst. (C) Pathway topology analysis associated
  with palmitoylcarnitine in fatty acid metabolism was carried out by a metaboanalyst.
