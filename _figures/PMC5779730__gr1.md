caption: Metabolic pathways for production of muconate from glucose and lignin-derived
  aromatic compounds. In P. putida KT2440, glucose is metabolized through the Entner-Doudoroff
  (ED) and pentose phosphate (PP) pathways to produce phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and
  erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P), which can be condensed to enter the shikimate pathway
  for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. An intermediate in the shikimate pathway,
  3-dehydroshikimate, can be converted to PCA by the action of a 3-DHS dehydratase,
  such as AsbF from Bacillus cereus used here. Deletion of the genes encoding the
  PCA dioxygenase, PcaHG, and integration of genes encoding the PCA decarboxylase
  AroY from Enterobacter cloacae and two associated proteins, EcdB and EcdD, from
  enables PCA to be converted to catechol rather than entering the β-ketoadipate pathway.
  Two paralogous dioxygenases, CatA and CatA2, convert catechol to muconate, which
  accumulates due to deletion of the genes encoding CatB and CatC, two enzymes required
  for further metabolism of muconate. Lignin-derived aromatic molecules are metabolized
  through upper pathways to form catechol in the case of phenol or guaiacol while
  p-coumarate, ferulate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, and vanillate are metabolized to form
  PCA, which can then be converted to catechol by the action of the PCA decarboxylase
  for subsequent conversion to muconate.
