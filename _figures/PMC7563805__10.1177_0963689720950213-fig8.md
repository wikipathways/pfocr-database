caption: SB promotes G1/S transition in the cell cycle in cells through the mitochondrial
  fission dynamic pathway mediated by Drp1 in vitro. SB increased the expression of
  Drp1 in human AC16 cardiomyocytes, LO2 hepatocytes, and human proximal tubular epithelial
  HK2 cells, which lead to mitochondrial excessive fission and cell proliferation,
  thereby promotes G1/S transition in the cell cycle and increasing the expressions
  of CDK2 and cyclin E1. Blocking Drp1 inactivates mitochondrial fission in cells,
  decreases the G1/S transition in the cell cycle, and decreases the proliferation
  of cells. Our study suggests that SB can be exploited as a potentially useful herbal
  derivative for the daily prevention of various diseases caused by impaired mitochondrial
  fission.
