caption: Schematic diagram of cellular respiration. One molecule of glucose is metabolized
  into two molecules of pyruvate. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate enters mitochondria
  to be oxidized into acetyl-CoA by a process called pyruvate decarboxylation. Acetyl-CoA
  is then metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) or Krebs cycle. Here,
  acetyl-CoA undergoes a cycle of reactions where some ATP, as well as ETC substrates
  (such as NADH) are produced. These substrates, by virtue of electron exchange in
  the ETC, generate an electrochemical gradient at the internal mitochondrial inner
  membrane that is associated to the production of more ATP as protons move along
  this gradient. About 30 molecules of ATP are produced in this process. In contrast,
  in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic respiration or glycolysis respiration), the
  molecules of pyruvate are synthesized into two molecules of lactate in a process
  called fermentation. In this metabolic pathway only two molecules of ATP are produced.
  Anaerobic respiration, also called anaerobic glycolysis, is about 100-times faster
  than oxidative phosphorylation and therefore is preferred for some immune cells
  as a quick source of energy, even if oxygen is abundant.
