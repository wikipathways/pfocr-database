caption: The PD pathway has at least 5 interacting molecules. PD-L1 and PD-L2, with
  different expression patterns, were identified as ligands of PD-1, and the interaction
  of PD-L1 or PD-L2 with PD-1 may induce T cell suppression. PD-L1 was found to interact
  with B7-1 (CD80) on activated T cells and inhibit T cell activity. PD-L2 has a second
  receptor, RGMb; initially, this interaction activates T cells, but it subsequently
  induces respiratory tolerance. PD-L1 on tumor cells can also act as a receptor,
  and the signal delivered from PD-1 on T cells can protect tumor cells from cytotoxic
  lysis.
