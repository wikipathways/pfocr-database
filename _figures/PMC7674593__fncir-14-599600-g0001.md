caption: Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) modulation in the mammalian brainstem
  interaural level differences (ILD) pathway. Modulation of neuronal properties by
  mGluRs has been observed at the ILD-coding site lateral superior olivary (LSO),
  as well as the input nuclei, anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) and medial nucleus
  trapezoid body (MNTB). At the LSO, groups I and II mGluRs at the postsynaptic site
  generate Ca2+signaling. Presynaptic group II mGluRs regulate the inhibitory input
  from MNTB while groups II and III mGluRs regulate the excitatory input from AVCN.
  At the AVCN, the group I mGluRs facilitate the excitability of bushy cells. At the
  MNTB, besides facilitating the excitability, the group I mGluRs exert release-mode
  dependent modulation on both the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to MNTB. Group
  III mGluRs may also be involved in modulating the excitatory input to MNTB. The
  text boxes containing the subtypes of mGluRs indicate postsynaptic (within a particular
  nucleus) or presynaptic (outside of the nucleus) modulation.
