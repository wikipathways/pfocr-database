caption: 'Utility of SIL metabolites in absolute quantification and flux analysis:
  (a) Representative mass spectrum of lactate derived from a flux experiment using
  [1, 2, 3–13C3]glucose and [13C1]lactate spiked into the extraction buffer. The peak
  area of the internal standard is corrected to reflect the 3.3% arising from the
  natural 13C abundance of 1.1% per carbon atom. (b) Lactate M+3 derives from glycolysis
  (green), whereas lactate M+2 derives from the PPP (red), where C1 is lost as CO2.
  (c) Lactate isotopologue distribution informs activation or suppression of metabolic
  pathways, here glycolysis and PPP. PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; SIL, stable isotope
  labeled.'
