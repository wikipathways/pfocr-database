caption: The N-terminal ANK repeat domain of ILK binds to the LIM1 domain of PINCH.
  Together with parvin, they form a ternary complex referred to as the IPP complex.
  Through the LIM4 domain, PINCH interacts with Nck2, which may link the integrin
  signaling pathway with the growth factor receptor signaling pathways. Except for
  ILK and Nck2, PINCH also contacts with other key factors such as Rsu1. The LIM5
  domain of PINCH is responsible for the interaction with Rsu1.
