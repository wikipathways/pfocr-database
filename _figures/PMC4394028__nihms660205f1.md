caption: 'Overview of TLR/IL-1R, RLR, cGAS, and inflammasome signaling pathways. The
  TLR/IL-1R signaling pathway ➊. TLRs are responsible for recognition of various pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns. IL-1R binds to IL-1β and associates with IL-1RAcP to form a
  ternary active complex. Both TLRs and IL-1Rs contain intracellular Toll-IL-1R domains,
  responsible for recruitment of downstream signaling molecules. Upon activation,
  IL-1Rs and all TLRs except TLR3 recruit MyD88 for signal transduction. In the case
  of TLR4, Mal is required for the recruitment of MyD88. Upon recruitment by TLRs/IL-1Rs,
  MyD88 further recruits IRAK4 and IRAK1/2 to form the Myddosome, through death domain
  interaction. IRAKs phosphorylate and activate downstream substrates, leading to
  the activation of NF-κB and IRF3. TLR3 recruits TRIF and activates TRIF-dependent
  signaling pathways. Endosomal TLR4 also activates TRIF-dependent signaling pathways
  through recruitment of TRAM and TRIF. The RLR signaling pathway ➋. RIG-I and MDA5
  are responsible for detection of different types of viral RNAs. RIG-I recognizes
  viral RNA containing 5′-ppp, whereas MDA5 detects long viral dsRNA. Upon RNA stimulation,
  RIG-I forms a tetramer and nucleates MAVS filament formation in the presence of
  K63 polyubiquitin chains. MDA5 and RIG-I assemble into filamentous structures along
  long dsRNA and nucleate the filament assembly of downstream MAVS. MAVS filaments
  further activate downstream proteins, leading to the activation of IRF3 and induction
  of type I interferons. The cGAS/STING signaling pathway ➌. cGAS is a major cytosolic
  DNA sensor that synthesizes cGAMP upon activation by dsDNA. cGAMP acts as a second
  messenger to activate downstream STING. STING can also be directly activated by
  the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP. Upon binding to stimulators, STING undergoes
  a conformational change and activates downstream signaling molecules. The inflammasome
  signaling pathways ➍➎. NLRP3 is activated by diverse stimuli, including pathogens,
  extracellular ATP, ROS, and phagocytosed particulates such as uric acid crystals.
  NAIPs recognize bacterial proteins and activate NLRC4. The AIM2 inflammasome is
  activated by cytosolic dsDNA released by viruses or bacteria. Upon activation, both
  NLRP3 and AIM2 nucleate filament formation of pro-caspase-1 through the adaptor
  protein ASC, whereas NLRC4 may directly nucleate pro-caspase-1 filament formation.
  The caspase domains of pro-caspase-1 are brought into proximity, leading to dimerization
  and activation of caspase-1. Active caspase-1 processes pro-IL-1β to generate mature
  IL-1β. Abbreviations: AIM2, absent in melanoma 2; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like
