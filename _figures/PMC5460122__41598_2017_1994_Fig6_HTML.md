caption: 'Lipotoxicity-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in TEC. After uptake
  by TEC via LDLR and megalin, LDL particles are deliver to lysosomes for degradation
  releasing free-cholesterol and fatty acids (FA). FA can be directly uptaken by CD36
  and boost mitochondria oxidation. oxLDL is recognized by CD36 and TLR4-TLR6 heterodimers.
  Excessive phagocytosis and impaired lysosomal hydrolysis of LDL particles cause
  phospholipidosis and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) allowing the release
  of lipase, cathepsins and Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. Lipoproteins and FA palmitate
  loading and calcium efflux can drive mitochondrial damage and ROS accumulation dropping
  ATP production and ATP-dependent functions. These effects occur in consequence to
  native and oxidized LDL uptake. NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires 2 signals:
  the 1st for priming and the 2nd for assembly. Priming is accomplished by NF-κB nuclear
  translocation induced by TLR4/6 and Ca2+signaling. Lysosomal destabilization, mitochondrial
  damage, ROS, and saturated FA account for NLRP3 complex oligomerization and caspase-1
  activation that in turn cleaves pro-IL-1β (maturation) and SIRT1 (inactivation).
  When activated, SIRT1 can deacetylate LKB1 allowing LKB1-mediated phosphorylation/activation
  of AMPK, an essential fuel gauge and promoter of mitochondrial β-oxidation and lipid
  catabolism. Thus, the metabolic stress-NLRP3/CASP1-SIRT1 cleavage pathway suppresses
  catabolic processes worsening the intralysosomal lipid deposition in TEC. Red arrows:
  priming; orange: NLRP3 activation; green: process counteracting lipotoxicity.'
