caption: Molecular mechanisms of regulating Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway by ginsenosides
  in treating cognitive impairment in the pathological model. (1) Rg1 and Rb1 directly
  reduce the content of ROS in the cytoplasm. (2) Rb1, Rg1, Re, PF11, compound K,
  Rh2, and Rd promote the expression of Nrf2. (3) Rb1 inhibits the expression of Rb1.
  (4) Re and Rb1 promote the expression of HO-1. (5) Rb1 and PF11 increase the content
  of GSH; Rb1 and PF11 increase the content of SOD. All ginsenosides downregulate
  the oxidative stress in cells and further decrease Aβ deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation.
