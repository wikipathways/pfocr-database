caption: Mechanisms of rituximab-mediated cell death. Rituximab coated B cells are
  killed by at least 4 different mechanisms. (A) Binding of rituximab to CD20 on B
  cell surface causes activation of the complement cascade, which generates the membrane
  attack complex (MAC) that can directly induce B-cell lysis by complement-mediated
  cytotoxicity (CDC). (B) Binding of rituximab allows interaction with NK cells via
  Fc receptors III (FcRIII), which leads to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
  (ADCC). (C) The Fc portion of rituximab and the deposited complement fragments allow
  for recognition by both FcR and complement receptors on macrophages, which lead
  to phagocytosis and ADCC. (D) The crosslinking of several molecules of rituximab
  and CD20 in the lipid raft determine the interaction of these complexes with elements
  of a signaling pathway involving Src kinases that mediate direct apoptosis.
