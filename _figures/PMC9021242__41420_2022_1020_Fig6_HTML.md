caption: 'Exposure to air pollutants (cigarette smoke, diesel particles, etc.) and
  allergens (mold, pollen, animal dander, etc.) stimulates epithelial cells leading
  to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF, etc.) and chemokines
  (IL-8, CCL20, etc.). Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines act on congenital
  lymphocytes (ILC2s), neutrophils, and APC. Jag1 on APC binds to Notch receptors
  on T cells to activate Notch. Notch converts Treg cells into Th2 cells and Th17
  cells through hippo pathway-dependent mechanisms, thus damaging the stability and
  function of Treg cells. Th17 cells and Th2 cells release active mediators, leading
  to airway smooth muscle contraction, increased viscosity secretion, and inflammatory
  cell infiltration, which trigger severe asthma. Meanwhile, Th2 cells produce interleukin
  (IL-4, etc.) to activate B cells to synthesize specific IgE, which binds to IgE
  receptors on mast cells and eosinophils. If the allergen re-enters the body, it
  can cross-link with IgE binding to the cell surface, causing the cell to synthesize
  and release multiple active mediators, producing clinical symptoms of asthma. Interactions
  of respiratory viruses (RV and RSV) with specific receptors in epithelial cells
  lead to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and act on ILC2s
  and neutrophils, which promote differentiation of Treg cells into IL-13-producing
  Th2 cells in the absence of allergens. Notch and its downstream effector YAP were
  significantly increased in Treg cells of patients with severe asthma. Note: RV rotavirus,
  RSV respiratory syncytial virus, DEP diesel particles, CCL20 CC chemokine ligand
  20, TNF tumor necrosis factor, IL interleukin, TSLP thymic stromal lymphopoietin,
  ILC2s group 2 innate lymphoid cells, APC antigen-presenting cell, Jag1 jagged1,
  S1P sphingosine-1-phosphate.'
