caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanisms that lidocaine suppresses
  proliferation, migration, and induces apoptosis in cancer progression. As shown
  in the picture, lidocaine blocks tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)–dependent activity
  of Src tyrosine protein kinase (Src) via repressing function of TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1),
  thereby preventing Akt kinase (Akt) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) from activating
  caveolin-1 from phosphorylating (). Moreover, lidocaine inhibited the Src-dependent
  intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) phosphorylation to block the cancer cells
  adhesion and invasion (). These signaling subways play a critical role in cancer
  metastasis. Cancer cells can migrate to remote sites via breaking up the cytoskeletal
  structure [e.g. microtubules] and releasing of matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP) ().
  Lidocaine impairs cancer cells proliferation and cytoskeletal reorganization by
  acting on DNA methylation and repressing the (vascular endothelial growth factor)
  VEGF/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways (–). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and
  nitric oxide (NO) generation was also inhibited by lidocaine thereby reducing vascular
  dilatation and directly decreasing the cells migration (). Lidocaine depressed tumor
  angiogenesis via suppressing the VEGF/AKT/mTOR/ICAM-1 signaling pathway (, ). Consequently,
  AKT related signaling pathways were essential in cancer metastasis. Additionally,
  lidocaine may induce apoptosis by promoting caspase-3 production by up-regulating
  the Bax and decreasing of Bcl-2 associating with the signaling pathways of ERK1/2
  and p38 (). In particular, lidocaine may aggravate the apoptosis through directly
  inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR or influenced AKT/Bcl2/Bax signaling pathway (, , ). The
  other effects are related to molecules such as natural killer cells (NK) ().
