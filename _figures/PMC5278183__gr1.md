caption: 'Regulation of Ciliogenesis by Inputs from the Cell Cycle. Cilium length
  is indicated by axonemal microtubules (grey rods) bound by the ciliary membrane
  (green line) throughout the cell cycle (CC) in proliferating cells (S, G2, M, and
  G1 phases), and during exit into and entry from cell quiescence (G0 phase). The
  mother centriole is indicated by the grey cylinder; only two microtubule doublets
  are shown for clarity. Stable, acetylated tubulin is indicated at G1/G0 with acetyl
  groups (Ac) shown as tan circles. The various proteins that are discussed in the
  main text are highlighted in different colors: the Aurora A (AURKA)–HDAC6 ciliary
  disassembly pathway is shown in orange and browns, and the kinesin-13 family members
  (KIF2A and KIF24) that mediate microtubule depolymerization are colored in greens.
  ‘P’ in a yellow circle indicates protein phosphorylation. Other centrosomal proteins
  are colored in blues. The role of Kif24 throughout the cell cycle is unclear, and
  other regulatory proteins are likely to be involved in regulation of the CP110–Cep97
  scaffold and phosphorylation by Nek2 during G1/S. AURKA also appears to activate
  Kif2a during G1/S, but then negatively regulates it by phosphorylation during M.
  In this and other figures, the shorter arrow-headed lines indicate positive regulatory
  or activating effects, whereas bar-headed lines indicate negative inhibitory effects.
  Dashed arrows indicate an inferred physical translocation or post-translational
  modification of a protein. Purple bold arrows indicate additional regulatory inputs
  from the cell cycle (‘CC’, circular purple icon).'
