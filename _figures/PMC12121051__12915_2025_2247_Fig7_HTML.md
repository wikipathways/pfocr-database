caption: Interplay of JH and BMP signaling in the regulation of fat body cell fate.
  During the previtellogenic stage, activated BMP signaling stimulates the expression
  of CycB and Plk1, promoting cell proliferation and facilitating fat body remodeling.
  In the vitellogenic fat body, high levels of JH induce the Fzr-mediated ubiquitination
  and degradation of Medea, attenuating the BMP pathway. Inhibitory BMP pathway halts
  mitosis and shifts the cell fate towards Vg synthesis. Solid lines and arrow heads
  indicate positive regulation. Dotted lines and T-bars represent negative effect
