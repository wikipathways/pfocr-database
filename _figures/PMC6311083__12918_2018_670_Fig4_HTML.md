  Pathway (HBP) intersection with PI3K-mTOR-Myc signaling and P53-MDM2 signalling
  axis. b CTL observations used in [] to generate dynamic model in the form of stategraph
  (as shown in Fig. b. a HBP intersection is shown with PI3K-mTOR-Myc siganling nd
  P53-MDM2 signalling axis. The increased flux of HBP is responsible for hyper O-GlcNAcylation
  which is implicated in several types of cancers. HBP generates UDP-GlcNAC (Urdine
  diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine) which is consumed by OGT. Hyper O-GlcNAcylation
  of CMyc triggers PI3K-mTOR-MYC signalling axis which is involved in cross talk with
  Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1). FoxM1 is further regulated by OGT. The qualitative BRN
  shows interconnections of important entities. The nodes/circles represent biological
  entities whereas interactions between two entities are represented with arrows.
  There are two types of interactions: activations (labelled with pointed green arrows)
  and inhibitions (labelled with blunt red arrows). The weight of the arrows indicate
  threshold of interaction. (see Definition 1). b Three CTL observations used in []
  are listed. These CTL observations are used by parallel SMBioNet implementation
  for estimation of parameters'
