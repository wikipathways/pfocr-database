caption: Fig 1. Two-compartment model of self-cytoprotection against stress as a result
  of the feedback control interactions among heme-, iron-, porphyrin-, and NO/CO-dependent
  pathways. The latter interactions are presented in the form of 2 self-regulated
  feedback loops where coordinated regulation of heme-dependent metabolism can defend
  against negative stress-induced consequences, among them enhanced cellular oxidant
  injury, vasospasm, and local inflammation. The left compartment shows how the feedback
  cycle is capable of suppressing the stress-induced activation of heme oxygenase-1
  (HO-1 or HSP32). The right compartment shows how stress-induced activation of the
  HO-1-CO-cGMP pathway is capable of increasing intracellular cGMP as a protective
  response against vasospasm, whereas the NO-synthase- NO-cGMP pathway is suppressed
  by glucocorticosteroid hormones
