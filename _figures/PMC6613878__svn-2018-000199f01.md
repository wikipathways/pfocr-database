caption: 'Therapeutic strategies targeting NAMPT against stroke. There are two ways
  to maintain the cellular NAD level in mammals: the de novo pathway from tryptophan
  and the salvage pathway from NAM, NR and NA with different catalysing enzymes. NAMPT
  is the rate-limiting enzyme of NAD synthesis in the salvage pathway, thereby influencing
  NAD-dependent enzymes and regulating cellular metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis
  and the adaptive response to inflammatory, oxidative, proteotoxic and genotoxic
  stresses. Accumulating in-vitro and in-vivo studies indicate that NAMPT is a therapeutic
  target against stroke from five potential therapeutic strategies: NAMPT overexpression,
  recombinant NAMPT, NAMPT activators, NAMPT enzymatic product NMN, NMN precursors
  NR and NAM. In ischaemic stroke, targeting NAMPT can confer neuroprotection via
  regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, activating SIRT1, inhibiting PARP1 activity
  and mimicking IPC. And, NAMPT related treatment exerts biological function in EPCs
  and NSCs to promote neovascularization and neurogenesis after ischaemic stroke.
  Remarkably, there is positive evidence of NAMPT in ICH, wherein NMN treatment can
  attenuate brain injury by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway in the mouse model
  of cICH, and protect BBB integrity and attenuate brain infarction and haemorrhage
  in the mouse model of tPA-ICH, indicating NAMPT mediated neuroprotection in ICH.
  These preclinical evidences indicate targeting NAMPT can be a promising choice for
  developing novel and effective therapeutic interventions against stroke. BBB, blood–brain
