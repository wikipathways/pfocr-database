caption: Apoptosis signaling affects longevity following mtROS in C. elegans. After
  treatment of the superoxide generator paraquat or mutations in structural components
  of mitochondrial respiratory chain (isp-1, nuo-6) lead to increased longevity in
  C. elegans, which is mediated by mtROS. The intrinsic apoptosis pathway (CED-9,
  CED-4, and CED-3) is sensitive to mtROS and is utilized as a protective mechanism
  for organism survival. Although the components of the core apoptosis pathway are
  utilized, the BH3-only protein CED-13 is required for the longevity phenotype in
  response to mtROS (left panel), instead of EGL-1, which is required for apoptosis
  (right panel)
