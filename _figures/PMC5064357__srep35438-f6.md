caption: Our working hypothesis of regulatory mechanism of GLUT4 translocation to
  the PM is shown. In the absence of insulin (without insulin stimulation), insulin
  signal is not activated, and IRS-1 forms a ternary complex with DGKζ and PIP5K1α.
  The IRS-1-associated DGKζ inhibited GLUT4 translocation to the PM. In the presence
  of insulin, IRS-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by activated insulin receptor tyrosine
  kinases, and the DGKζ-PIP5K1α complex is dissociated from IRS-1. Then, IRS-1 can
  activate the canonical insulin signal, the PI 3-kinase pathway. In addition, the
  released DGKζ-PIP5K1α complex enhances GLUT4 translocation independently of PI 3-kinase
  pathway activation. In this paper, we show that both pathways are required for the
  GLUT4 translocation to the PM.
