caption: Steroid hormone biosynthetic pathways in ovary. In the ovarian theca cells
  androgen formation is stimulated by LH via the steroidogenic pathway. Androgen biosynthesis
  following stimulation by LH is modulated by cytochrome P450c17, which possesses
  both 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities in theca cells. Androstenedione formed
  in theca cells is also taken up by granulosa cells, where it can contribute to the
  formation of estrogens. Androstenodione in theca cells is converted to testosterone,
  which leads to hyperandrogenism. Insulin also stimulates androgen production by
  theca cells. LH, luteinizing hormone.
