caption: Tetrahydrofolate (THF)-mediated one-carbon metabolism is required for the
  synthesis of purines, thymidylate and the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine.
  The hydroxymethyl group of serine is the major source of one-carbon units which
  are generated in the mitochondria in the form of formate in a reaction initiated
  by the PLP-dependent enzyme mSHMT, or in the cytoplasm through the activity of cSHMT.
  Formate derived in mitochondria can enter the cytoplasm and function as a one-carbon
  unit for folate metabolism. The transsulfuration pathway is initiated by the PLP-dependent
  enzyme CBS. The one carbon is labeled in “bold”. MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase; cSHMT, cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase; mSHMT, mitochondrial
  serine hydroxymethyltransferase; TS, thymidylate synthase; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine;
  AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine; PLP, pyridoxal 5’ phosphate.
