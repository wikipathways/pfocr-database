caption: Different pathways in cancer targeted by p-PROTAC. (A) ErbB2PPPI3K and PROTACAKT
  inhibit breast tumor growth and promote apoptosis through the classic PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway. c-Src promotes the transcription of ERα in the nucleus through the MAPK
  signaling pathway. The degradation of ERα by TD-PROTAC inhibits the transcription
  of downstream target genes and mediates the killing effect on ERα-positive breast
  cancer. (B) Reduced expression of E-cadherin is closely related to disruption of
  cell-cell contacts and enhanced cancer cell invasion. When E-cadherin expression
  is suppressed, β-catenin is released and translocated to the nucleus, which can
  be antagonized by PROTACX-protein. (C) PRTC proficiently inhibits cell proliferation
  and motility in pancreatic by inhibiting transcription initiation upon Wnt signaling
  as well as downstream target gene cyclin D1 thus inducing cycle arrest and DNA damage.
