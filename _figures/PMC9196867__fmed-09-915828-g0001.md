caption: Model of pathogenic mechanisms in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). (A)
  In a person with a genetic background predisposing to CLE, the exposure to provocation
  factors such as UV light can induce cellular stress [reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  DNA alterations, cytokine secretion], apoptosis, and the release of DNA components
  in so-called “apoptotic blebs” in keratinocytes. Normally, these “blebs” are rapidly
  degraded and apoptotic cells are removed by macrophages (Mph). In CLE, delayed degradation
  and clearance leads to secondary, more pro-inflammatory, forms of cell death such
  as necroptosis, which results in the release of cell debris. Dendritic cells (DC)
  recognize this debris as potential autoantigens and migrate to nearby lymph nodes
  to present it to T and B cells. Upon activation, naïve B cells develop into plasma
  cells to produce autoantibodies (AAB). AAB form immune complexes with nucleic acids
  and can induce type I IFN production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). T cells
  mature into CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with the latter exerting cytotoxic effects against
  keratinocytes. (B) Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA motifs) released from dying cells
  can be recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) as so-called damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs), leading to activation of both Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent
  and TLR-independent inflammatory signaling cascades. In CLE, this leads to increased
  expression of several cytokines, particularly type I IFN. Type I IFN is known to
  bind to IFN-α/β receptors on keratinocytes in an autocrine loop and mediates increased
  expression of proinflammatory chemokines such as CXCL10 via the JAK-STAT pathway.
  This leads to the recruitment of CXCR3+ cells, which induce keratinocyte cell death,
  release of cytokines and a chronic reactivation of innate immune pathways.
