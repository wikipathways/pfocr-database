caption: Abnormal glycosylation associated with colorectal cancer is involved in cancer
  emergence and progression as well as in different anticancer therapy resistance
  mechanisms. These later include altered drug absorption (A), signaling activation
  disruption (B), apoptosis resistance (C), cell stemness acquisition (D) and altered
  drug metabolism (E). A) Mucins could generate steric hindrance, mask surface antigen
  of targeted therapy and decrease absorption of chemotherapy. In contrast, N-glycosylation
  can stabilize transporters responsible for efflux of chemotherapy drugs. B) On endothelial
  cells, aberrant β1,6-GlcNAc bearing-N-glycans of VEGFR could promote its interaction
  with galectins and activate angiogenic signaling in the absence of ligand resulting
  in decreased efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment. In tumor cells, the presence of α2,6-sialylated
  terminal structure on EGFR could also decreased activity of the receptor and efficacy
  of TKI. C) Abnormal glycosylation of β1 integrin prevents binding and pro-apoptotic
  activity of Gal. Both altered N- and O-glycosylation of cell death receptors TNFR1,
  FasR, DR4 and DR5 inhibit induction of apoptosis. Fucosylation of Lewis antigen
  structures on CD44 could protect this CSC biomarker from proteolytic cleavage occurring
  in early steps of apoptosis. Truncated O-glycosylation of mucins promotes their
  intracellular accumulation and outer mitochondrial localization of MUC1-C could
  affect activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. O-GlcNAcylation regulates
  expression of pro-apoptotic proteins. Altered O-GlcNAcylation could therefore induce
  resistance to apoptosis. D) The EMT process is supposed to generate CSC which have
  a slow proliferation rate and are thus less sensitive to chemotherapies. CRC CSC
  biomarkers CD44 and CD147 can be glycosylated. Expression of ST6GalT-1 is correlated
  with expression of ALDH1 and CD133 stem cell markers and proportion of CSC. The
  CRC CSC compartment could be regulated by the O-GlcNAcylation mediated-epigenetic
  down-regulation of MYBL1, a transcription activator of E-cadherin. O-GlcNAcylation
  also stabilizes the E-cadherin suppressor Snail1, essential for the loss of adherens
  junctions associated with EMT. E) O-GlcNAcylation may take fundamental part in regulation
  of 5-FU metabolism in colon cancer cells. OGT interacts with TET1 on promoter regions
  to activate transcription of antioxidant enzymes such as Nrf2. O-GlcNAcylation regulates
  both transcription factors Sp1 and E2F-1, which regulate a myriad of genes involved
  in nucleotide synthesis including enzymes involved in 5-FU catabolism and anabolism
  such as DHFR, TK and TS. E2F-1 is sequestered and inactived by binding to hypo-phosphorylated
  and O-GlcNAcylated Rb during early G1 phase of cell cycle. On the other hand, O-GlcNAcylation
  of E2F-1 was found to regulate its stability and its transcriptional activity but
  the specific biological effect in colon cancer cells has not been reported yet.
  TP was also found to be O-GlcNAcylated in breast tumors but the functional role
  of this glycosylation has not been studied. Finally, a Yin-Yang relation between
  phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation is expected to affect activity of TS, the target
  of active metabolite FdUMP. O-GlcNAcylation at Ser347 appears to decrease Thr344
  phosphorylation and stability of CK2α. CK2α is responsible for the phosphorylation
  at Ser124 and the decrease of catalytic activity of TS.
