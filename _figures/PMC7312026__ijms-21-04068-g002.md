caption: Canonical pathway enrichment analysis involving ERα+ BC essential genes.
  Network summarizing the canonical pathways involving key genes found essential in
  the genome-wide dropout screenings considered here. Edges between nodes (light blue
  lines) were generated using an overlap coefficient of 0.3 and their width is proportional
  to the number of shared genes.
