caption: Proposed mechanisms of BTKi-induced hypertension. Bruton tyrosine kinase
  inhibitors (BTKis) may promote the development of hypertension through a variety
  of interconnected signaling pathways. BTKi inhibition promotes the production of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) through NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation, resulting
  in decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and decreased nitric
  oxide (NO) utilization, which triggers endothelial dysfunction. In addition, BTKI-mediated
  inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway reduces eNOS activity and disrupts the balance between
  endothelin-1 (ET-1) and NO, further aggravating endothelial dysfunction. Inhibition
  of downstream MAPK signaling and NF-κB activation leads to impaired vascular smooth
  muscle proliferation and immunosuppression. BTKi treatment may also affect vascular
  homeostasis by affecting the Notch1/Dll4 signaling axis, leading to vascular dysplasia
  and pulmonary hypertension. Finally, activation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway leads to
  enhanced smooth muscle contraction and vascular remodeling by reducing eNOS activity
  and enhancing angiotensin II (AngII) signaling. These mechanisms work together to
  eventually lead to endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodeling, and the development
  of hypertension. Image created with BioRender.com (accessed on 9 May 2025)
