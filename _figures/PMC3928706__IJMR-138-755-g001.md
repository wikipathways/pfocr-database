caption: 'Mechanism underlying γδ T cell killing of tumours: γδ T cell receptor (TCR)
  interacts with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) generated through the mevalonate
  pathway in tumours. Bisphosphonates inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS)
  leading to increased endogenous pool of IPP and dimethylalleyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP)
  in tumour cells. γδ T cells recognize heat shock proteins (HSPs) and MHC class I
  chain-related molecules (MICA/B) or UL-16 binding protein ULBP expressed on tumour
  cells via their TCR and natural killer group 2, member D protein (NKG2D) receptors,
  respectively. Perforin released from activated γδ T cells lyse the tumour cell.
  γδ T cells can also kill tumour cells through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity
  (ADCC). γδ T cells expressing CD16 (FCγRIII) interacts with tumour associated antigens
  (TAA) via specific monoclonal antibodies and mediate ADCC. Cytokines like interferon-γ
  (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) released by γδ T cells can recruit other
  immune cells (bystander effect).'
