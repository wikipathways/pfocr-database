caption: The myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) pathway during skeletal muscle development
  and regeneration. Satellite stem cells remain in a quiescent state until activation
  upon muscle injury. Quiescent satellite stem cells expressing Pax7 are activated
  to committed progenitor cells expressing Myf5. However, a portion of the cells undergoesself-renewal
  to regenerate the stem cell pool. Proliferating myoblasts express Myf5 and MyoD
  while Pax7 is downregulated. MyoD is the master regulator of myoblast differentiation
  that initiates proliferating myoblast cells to exit the cell cycle. Differentiation
  and fusion precede to form myofibers under the regulation of MyoG and Mrf4.
