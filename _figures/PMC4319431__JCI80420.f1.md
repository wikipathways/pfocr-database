caption: There are several potential strategies to improve the clinical efficacy of
  these PARAs. One strategy would be to augment potency by increasing the oligomeric
  state of Apo2L/TRAIL or the affinity of agonistic anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibodies
  for Fcγ receptors (blue asterisks). Another strategy to improve efficacy would be
  the implementation of predictive and pharmacodynamic diagnostic biomarkers that
  might help predict or determine whether a patient’s cancer is sensitive (green asterisks)
  or resistant (red asterisks) to PARA treatment. A third approach would be to improve
  synthetic lethality against cancer cells by combining PARAs with pharmacological
  agents that target various other intracellular signaling components or modulators
  of the apoptotic pathways (black asterisks). BAX/BAK, BCL-2–associated X protein/BCL-2
  antagonist killer 1; BCL-2/XL, B cell lymphoma-2/extra long; BID, BH3-interacting
  domain death agonist; cFLIP, cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein; CUL3, cullin 3;
  DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; FUT3/6,
  fucosyltransferase 3/6; GALNT14/3, polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase
  14/3; SMAC, second mitochondria–derived activator of caspases; TRAF2, TNF receptor–associated
  factor 2; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis.
