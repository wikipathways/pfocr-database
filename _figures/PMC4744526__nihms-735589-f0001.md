caption: 'Key components searched for in five investigated immune related pathways.
  The tri-spine horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus model of clotting is redrawn
  from (), and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster models of signalling pathways
  are redrawn from (). Clotting: dark blue represents pathogen surface molecules that
  initiate the clotting pathway, brown represents cascade molecules, and grey represents
  end product. Toll: dark blue represents pathogen surface molecules that initiate
  the Toll pathway, dark green represents recognition molecules, blue represents signalling
  molecules, and red represents transcription factor. IMD: dark blue represents pathogen
  surface molecules that initiate the Toll pathway, green represents recognition molecules,
  orange represents signalling molecules, and purple represents transcription factor.
  JNK: light green represents signalling molecules, and light brown represents transcription
  factors. JAK/STAT: yellow represents ligand of domeless released upon infection
  (not searched for), pink represents signalling molecules, and turquoise represents
  transcription factor.'
