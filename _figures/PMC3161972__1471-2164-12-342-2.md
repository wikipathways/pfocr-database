caption: Monolignol biosynthesis pathway isoforms of A. auriculiformis and A. mangium.
  The number of isoforms found in A. auriculiformis (showed in red circle) and A.
  mangium (showed in blue circle) based on Blastx (E-value ≤ 1E-10) and conserved
  motifs. The number of orthologous isoforms shared by both species is indicated in
  the overlapping region. The figure is reprinted with permission from The Brazilian
