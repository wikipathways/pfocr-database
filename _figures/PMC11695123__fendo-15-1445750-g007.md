caption: 'Oxidative stress promotes the progression of diabetes toward diabetic cognitive
  dysfunction by figdraw: Hyperglycemia increases mitochondrial respiration, promotes
  ROS levels, increases NO and NOS in brain mitochondria, and decreases MnSOD GSH-Px
  activity. Meanwhile, ROS enhances inflammatory factors, leading to cognitive dysfunction
  (A). Hyperglycemia can promote Nrf2, NQO-1 and HO-1 downregulation, causing continuous
  oxidative stress, aggravating oxidative damage in the hippocampus, and causing cognitive
  dysfunction (B) and In the condition of hyperglycemia, POX and MDA increased and
  SOD activity decreased, which promoted the activation of IKKB/NF-κB and inhibited
  the activity of PI3K/PKB, further promoted chronic inflammation and impaired insulin
  signaling pathway, and led to cognitive dysfunction (C)'
