caption: Immune signaling pathway of infected cells. Transmembrane protease serine
  2 primes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike
  (S) protein. The activated S protein binds to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2),
  resulting in membrane fusion. Thereafter, SARS-CoV-2 RNA chain invades the cells
  and replicates. The binding of ACE2 to the S protein is blocked, resulting in mitochondrial
  damage and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage. S proteins can activate Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) 2 and 4 on the cell surface, whereas ssRNA and CpGDNA can activate
  endosomal TLR7/8 and TLR9, thereby activating the nuclear factor kappa light chain
  enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway and TRAF6 by MyD88 dependent pathway.
  TLR3 binds to dsRNA and activate TRAF3 and TRAF6 by MyD88 independent pathway, thereby
  activating interferon regulating factor (IRF) 3 and 7. MtDNA activates the cGAS-STING
  pathway, which in turn activates the NF-κB pathway and IRF3. NF- κB pathway regulates
  the expression of various cytokines and chemokines, whereas IRF3 and IRF7 regulate
  the expression of type I interferon. Secreted tissue-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-
  α) binding to TNF receptor cell surface activates the TNF pathway and enhances the
  NF- κB pathway. Interferon-1 and Interleukin-6 bind to responsive receptors to activate
  the JAK/STAT pathway, thereby promoting the secretion of proinflammatory factors.
  SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins participate in the regulation of cellular immune signal
  transduction. Non-structural protein (NSP)-5 and ORF7a can activate NF- κB pathway;
  3CL, ORF3a, ORF9b, and ORF10 can inhibit the activation of SRING protein, whereas
  ORF9b and NSP7 can inhibit the activation of TRAF3
