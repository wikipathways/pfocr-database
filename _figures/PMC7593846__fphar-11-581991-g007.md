caption: The signaling pathway analysis based on the potential biomarkers (A) Summary
  of ingenuity pathway analysis with MetaboAnalyst. The size and color of each circle
  were based on pathway impact value and p-value, respectively; (B) Construction of
  the main metabolic pathways related to differential metabolites. (down-regulated
