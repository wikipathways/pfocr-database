caption: a Aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer metabolism. During this process,
  most glucose-derived pyruvate is secreted extracellularly as lactate, and glutamine
  becomes a conditionally essential amino acid. Glutaminolysis sustains mitochondrial
  function, supplying TCA cycle metabolites such as αKG and generating diverse biomolecules,
  including NEAAs, NADPH, and nucleotides. Increased glutamine flux into the mitochondrial
  matrix via the SLC1A5 variant can enhance glutaminolysis and lead to metabolic reprogramming
  toward enhanced aerobic glycolysis. b Glutamine-derived α-KG activates the mTORC1
  signaling pathway, resulting in aerobic glycolysis and protein translation, which
  are crucial for tumor proliferation. c During glutaminolysis, ammonium ions are
  generated via a deamidation reaction catalyzed by glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase.
  Most ammonium ions are used as a nitrogen source for nucleotide biosynthesis and
  are disposed of via the urea cycle, but an excess of ammonium ions promotes autophagy.
  Augmented autophagy is associated with drug resistance by enhancing aerobic glycolysis
  and is involved in cancer cell survival, progression, and metastasis. Gln glutamine,
  Glu glutamate, α-KG a-ketoglutarate, PHD prolyl hydroxylase.
