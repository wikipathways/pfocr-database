caption: In basal-subtype breast cancer cells, expression of ARHGEF1-exon38(+) inhibits
  tight junctions, while expression of E-cadherin promotes expression of adherens
  junctions. Promotion of cell-cell adhesion by either pathway in this cell type leads
  to increased activity of signaling pathways that block apoptosis and increase proliferation,
  driving the malignant phenotype.
