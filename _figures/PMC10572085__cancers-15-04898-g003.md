caption: 'The signaling pathway activated by HA-CD44 interaction. (a) The signaling
  pathway from the promotion of the binding of ezerin-radexin-moesin (ERM), ankyrin,
  and adaptor proteins to the cytoplasmic tail. Binding activates the interaction
  of CD44 and RAS and RhoGTPase, leading to the promotion of actin polymerization,
  remodeling of the cytoskeletal architectures, and facilitating cell migration and
  invasion. In contrast, the oncogenic gene RAS activates mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) and promotes cell proliferation. (b) Signaling pathway activated by
  receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). HA-CD44 interaction activates RTKs, such as ErbB2
  and EGFR, which elevate the activities of the non-receptor kinases of the Src family
  or Ras family GTPase. Such intracellular signaling enhances the activity of downstream
  signaling pathways, such as MAPK, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and focal
  adhesion kinase (FAK). The former promotes cell proliferation, while the latter
  two enhance cell migration and invasion. *: activated gene.'
