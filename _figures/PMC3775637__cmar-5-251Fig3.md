caption: 'Targeting the PI3K and BTK pathways in NHL. The B-cell receptor-signaling
  pathway (purple) is initiated through phosphorylation of coreceptors that recruit
  spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), which then phosphorylates downstream kinases, including
  PLCγ, leading to activation of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK then binds phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), which in turn hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) into two second messengers – inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG) – that ultimately activate downstream proteins involved in B-cell signaling.
  In the PI3K pathway (orange), activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) through
  adaptor proteins phosphorylate subunits of PI3K, leading to conversion of PIP2 to
  PIP3. Phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor PTEN terminates PI3K. Accumulation
  of PIP3 leads to phosphorylation of AKT, which further activates downstream pathways,
  including mTOR (through the tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2)) and other essential
  pathways. Therapeutic inhibition of select pathway components that have been investigated
  in clinical trials for NHL are shown.Abbreviations: 4EBP-1, 4E-binding protein 1;
  GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; mTORC, mTOR
  complex; MDM2, mouse double minute 2 homolog; P, phosphorylation site; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; PLC, phospholipase C gamma; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; RHEB,
