  AJs are mediated through calcium-dependent cadherins linked to the actin cytoskeleton
  via α-and β-catenins. Chrodate-like classic cadherins were not observed in the cnidarian
  Nematostella, as well as in our studied corals, however, the cadherin genes found
  belong to the protocadherin subfamily of cadherin superfamily. Regulation of AJs
  can be by α-catenin interactions with actin-associated proteins (Afadin and VCL),
  via the small GTPase RAC1 and Cdc42, or alternatively through posttranslational
  modifications of AJ components. Cadherin-catenin complexes are negatively regulated
  by tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin by receptor tyrosine kinases or cytoplasmic
  tyrosine kinases; SRC, Fyn and YES1 and positively regulated by casein kinase II
  (CKII) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Additional regulation is through
  GTPase-activating protein IQGAP binding to RAC1, which is thought to displace the
  latter from interacting with β-catenin, thereby freeing β-catenin to interact with
  α-catenin. Dissociation of β-catenin is likely to render cadherin susceptible to
  proteasome-mediated degradation or recycling back to the cell surface. WNT signaling
  acts as a positive regulator, activating transcription factors by stabilizing β-catenin
  and promoting its binding to TCF (transcription factor3). Various growth factors,
  including: HGF, FGF, and TGFβ2, regulate cadherin expression indirectly via transcription
  factor SNAI2/Slug, which eventually inhibits cadherin expression. Transcriptional
  activation of β-catenin is stimulated via TGF-beta signaling by enhancing the interaction
  between CREBB-binding protein and SMAD3. Adhesion of neighboring cells can also
  be mediated via NOTCH and DLL1 or nectin, which results in lateral inhibition of
  cell differentiation and firm adhesion.'
