caption: The transcript encoding key molecules in this pathway, namely, RHOA, RHOH
  and Ras homologs were increased, whereas CREBBP, MYL3, Mlcp, and Ppp1r12 were decreased
  in aged Atp8b1 mutant mice. Symbols and Color Keys. In the Figures (-), upregulated
  genes are depicted in red and downregulated genes in green. The solid lines depict
  direct interaction and the dashed lines depict indirect interaction between genes.
  The arrow represents interaction between genes. The symbols represent the following.
  A= Activation, B= Binding, E= Expression, I= Inhibition, PP = Protein-Protein binding,
  P = Phosphorylation/Dephosphorylation, RB= regulation of binding, MB = Group/Complex
  membership.
