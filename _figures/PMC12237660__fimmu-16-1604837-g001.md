caption: Mechanism of MASH (Metabolism and immune response). The main sources of fatty
  acids in the liver include fat mobilization from white adipose tissue, dietary intake,
  de novo lipogenesis from carbohydrates (especially fructose), and SCFAs generated
  by gut microbiota through the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates. During the
  progression of MASH, due to the dual effects of insulin resistance and inflammation,
  white adipose tissue generates fatty acids through lipolysis, which enter the bloodstream
  and subsequently reach the liver. De novo lipogenesis requires the participation
  of a series of enzymes, including ACC, FAS, and SCD1. These enzymes are regulated
  by SREBP-1c. The fatty acids generated through these pathways enter the liver, leading
  to continuous lipid accumulation and the formation of toxic lipids. The accumulation
  of toxic lipids causes ER stress, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction
  in the liver, eventually resulting in hepatocyte death. DAMPs are molecules released
  during cell damage or death and serve as “signals” of cellular injury or stress.
  These molecules activate KCs, triggering liver immune responses and the release
  of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Kupffer cells can activate HSCs to release
  collagen fibers. Kupffer cells have another key characteristic that can phagocytose
  lipids and dead cells, ultimately leading to their exhaustion, while monocyte-derived
  macrophages from the bone marrow are recruited into the liver. On one hand, these
  monocyte-derived macrophages differentiate into CCR2+ pro-inflammatory macrophages
  and monocyte-derived KCs to replenish KC pool. On the other hand, with the focus
  of this review, they differentiate into TREM2+ macrophages, also known as LAMs,
  which regulate liver lipid metabolism, inhibit chronic liver inflammation and reverse
  the progression of MASH. Meanwhile, TREM2-expressing KCs are also present during
  MASH. MASH, Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis; SCFAs, short-chain
