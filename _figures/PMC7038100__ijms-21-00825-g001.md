caption: Functions of tight junction proteins at different subcellular localizations.
  Tight junction proteins are expressed at three different locations within epithelial
  cells with different functions including the apical membrane (a), the basolateral
  membrane (b), and in the nucleus (c). (a) At the apical membrane, tight junctions
  (TJs) are typically built by integral membrane proteins of the CLDN or Marvel-domain
  containing protein family (e.g., occludin—OCLN) that connect via C-terminus bound
  adapter proteins to intracellular actin filaments. (b) In the normal intestinal
  mucosa and in various cancer cell types, basolateral localized CLDNs have been found
  to regulate activation of pro-MMPs into MMPs and to interact with integrins at focal
  adhesion complexes, hereby affecting main intracellular signaling cascades such
  as the MAPK pathway. Investigations on colon cancer cell lines indicate EpCAM to
  specifically stabilize expression of CLDN1 and 7 at the basolateral membrane and
  to prevent their lysosomal degradation. (c) Nuclear localization has been reported
  for ZO1 and ZO2 as well as CLDN1-4 in various cancer cell types and is regulated
  by posttranslational modification. Within the nucleus, CLDN2 retains cyclinD1 and
  ZONAB hereby enhancing cell proliferation. Specific interaction of ZO1 with the
  transcription factor ZONAB regulates G1/S-phase progression by increasing cyclin
  D1, while ZO2 inhibits transcription of cyclin D1 by binding to c-myc. CLDN (Claudin);
