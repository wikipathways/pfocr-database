caption: Diagram showing metabolic relationships between selected peroxisomal proteins
  and enzymes upregulated by drought or ABA. Protein names are shown in black typeface
  and metabolites in green. 4CL1 and AAE17 activate (unknown) substrates for β-oxidation,
  which utilizes enzymes acylCoA oxidase (ACX)1 and multifunctional proteins MFP2
  and/or AIM1. ECH1a is a poorly characterized member of the enoylCoA hydratase/isomerase
  family. ACX (and other peroxisomal enzymes) produce hydrogen peroxide that is broken
  down by catalase (CAT). Acetyl CoA produced can enter the glyoxylate pathway; malate
  synthase (MLS) and isocitrate lyase (ICL) are the unique enzymes of this pathway
  which produces malate that is exported as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase (PEPCK) is the first committed step of this pathway, leading to production
  of sucrose and/or compatible osmolytes. Succinate produced by the ICL reaction is
  exported to mitochondria for further metabolism. In Arabidopsis, citrate can be
  exported directly for respiration (not shown). On the right hand side of the diagram
  a simplified representation of the ascorbate glutathione cycle is shown. Asc; ascorbate;
  DHA dehydroascorbate; GSH reduced glutathione; GSSG; oxidized glutathione. DHAR
  dehydroascorbate reductase. GR1 glutathione reductase; ICDH NADP+ dependent isocitrate
  dehydrogenase. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR)
  are membrane bound proteins that participate in removal of hydrogen peroxide and
  regeneration of ascorbate. PEX3 is involved in import of peroxisome membrane proteins
  (including the components of the import machinery for matrix proteins) and PEX11
  is involved in peroxisome division.
