caption: Signaling pathways for TLR-3 and TLR-4. The interaction of LPS with TLR-4
  that requires cooperation of two other proteins, CD14 and MD-2, initiates two major
  signaling pathways. The MyD88-dependent signaling pathway leads to the phosphorylation
  of IRAK, recruitment of TRAF-6, activation of NF-κB and JNK/p38, and release of
  proinflammatory cytokines. Another adapter, Mal/Tirap, participates in this pathway.
  The study of McWhirter et al. () focuses on the activation of the MyD88-independent
  pathway that results in the activation of IRF-3 and the induction of IFN-β and Rantes.
  TRIF and TRAM serve as adapter proteins in TLR-4 signaling that leads to activation
  of IRF-3. Association of TRIF with the noncanonic kinase TBK-1 results in a complex
  formation also containing IRF-3. Phosphorylated IRF-3 is translocated to the nucleus
  and stimulates expression of type I IFN and chemokine genes. The ligand for TLR-3
  is dsRNA, viral RNA, or its surrogate poly(IC). TLR-3 does not associate with Mal
  TRAM and MyD88, and thus TRIF alone can mediate the dsRNA-induced signaling pathway,
  leading to the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and the induction of IFN-β.
