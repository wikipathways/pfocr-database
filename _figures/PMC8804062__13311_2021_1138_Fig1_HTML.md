caption: Schematic summarizing RhoA, PTEN, and Rb1 signaling in the perikaryal and/or
  the growth cone. Within the perikarya, growth factor signaling including insulin
  or NGF will result in activation of PI3K and consequently, conversion of PIP2 to
  PIP3. This will activate PDK resulting in Akt activation and subsequent inhibition
  or activation of Akt targets. The overall neuronal response of Akt activation is
  regeneration and survival. PTEN antagonizes Akt activation by the conversion of
  PIP3 to PIP2 and therefore hinders Akt activation and regeneration. The pocket protein
  Rb1 in a hypophosphorylated state binds and sequesters the E2F family of transcription
  factors. However, upon hyperphosphorylation by cyclin-CDK complexes, Rb1 releases
  E2F where it can act in the nucleus to transduce genes. One such gene that may be
  upregulated by E2F is PPARϒ. Heightened PPARϒ expression or activation by agonists
  like thiazolidinediones (TZDs), overall result in cell cycle progression, increased
  glucose tolerance, axonal regeneration, and cellular growth. At the growth cone,
  Akt becomes activated through NGF/insulin signaling as described above. Akt will
  inactivate GSK3 which when active can collapse the growth cone. Akt will additionally
  activate mTOR resulting in growth cone formation, local protein synthesis, and generation
  of a pro-regenerative microenvironment. Within this pathway, Sema3a can activate
  neurophilin-1 receptors that enhance PTEN activity and reduce downstream Akt activity
  and collapse the growth cone. RhoA is a GTPase that is activated by exchanging GDP
  for GTP through action of a Rho guanine exchange factor (Rho-GEF). Conversely, RhoA
  becomes inactivated by Rho-GTPase activating proteins that cause the RhoA bound
  GTP to be hydrolyzed to GDP and phosphate. Activation of RhoA leads to ROCK and
  subsequently LIMK activation. Active LIMK phosphorylates cofilin rendering it inactive.
  This influences the growth cone by promoting actin remodeling and growth cone collapse.
  This pathway can be inhibited through H1152 or Y-27632 that inhibit RhoA and ROCK,
  respectively
