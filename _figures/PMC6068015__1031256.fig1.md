caption: 'Lymphoma immune evasion mechanisms. (Top left panel) “Hide”. Tumor cells
  may become “invisible” to the immune system by down-regulating MHC, co-stimulatory
  (CD80 and CD86) and/or adhesion (CD54) molecules. Downregulation of CD58 allows
  tumor cells to escape killing by natural killer (NK) cells, which are activated
  by self-missing signal (loss of MHC-I). (Right panel) “Defend”. Tumor cells are
  seen by the immune system but avoid destruction through resistance to apoptosis
  signals and/or expression of inhibitory receptors. Tumor cells may resist apoptosis
  by different means: loss of FAS and/or TRAIL receptors (extrinsic pathway), hyperexpression
  of anti-apoptotic molecules such as BCL-2 (intrinsic pathway) or PI9 (Granzyme pathway).
  T cells can be inhibited by inhibitory ligands which are expressed by lymphoma cells
  or cells from their microenvironment such as PD-L1 or PD-L2/PD-1, LAG-3/MHC-II,
  CTLA-4/CD80 or CD86 and HLA-G/ILT. CD47 sends a “don’t eat me” signal to macrophages
  and DCs by interacting with its ligand SIRPa. Tumor cells may also express FAS-L
  to induce death of immune cells. Some molecules expressed by lymphoma cells may
  have dual roles: expression of MHC-II allows antigen presentation but also binds
  to the inhibitory receptor LAG-3; CD80 and CD86 stimulate T cells through CD28 but
  may also inhibit T cells through CTLA-4. (Bottom left panel) Immunosuppressive microenvironment.
  The tumor cells interact with their microenvironment to contribute to lymphoma immune
  evasion. IL-10 is a potent immunosuppressive cytokine that inhibits priming by dendritic
  cells (DC), promotes Th2 and Treg differentiation and M2 macrophages; TGF-β induces
  exhausted phenotype of CTL and Treg differentiation; IDO suppresses cytotoxic T
  lymphocyte (CTL) and NK immune response through degradation of tryptophan and production
  of kynurenine. Trp: tryptophan; Kyn: kynurenine; Gal: galectin; Ag: antigen.'
