caption: '(A) Intracellular pathways mediated by D1- and D2-class DA receptors. Activation
  of D1-class receptors stimulates AC, increases the production of cAMP, and activates
  PKA. Activation of PKA phosphorylates I-1 and its homologue DARPP-32, potent inhibitors
  of PP-1 in their phosphorylated states. Activation of D2-class receptors inhibits
  AC and downregulates this cAMP-dependent pathway. D2-class receptors also couples
  to Ca2+ signaling through Gβγ subunits, which act on several types of ion channels
  and on intracellular Ca2+ stores, linking these receptors to downstream Ca2+-dependent
  effectors, e.g. calcineurin (PP-2B) and PKC. In addition, D2-class receptors can
  function through a novel protein kinase B (Akt)–GSK-3 signaling cascade. Downstream
  effectors of these multiple signaling pathways include, among others, voltage-dependent
  ion channels, ligand-gated glutamate receptors, and ion pumps. (B) Homologous desensitization
  process of GPCR. After ligand binding, GPCRs are rapidly phosphorylated by GRKs,
  followed by binding of the phosphorylated receptors to arrestins. The arrestin-GPCR
  interaction promotes recruitment of an endocytic complex, leading to receptor internalization
  via the dynamin-dependent, clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytic pathway. Arrestins
  also serve as adaptors and scaffolds that interact with numerous signaling molecules
  and organiz some G protein-independent signaling pathways. Black arrows represent
