caption: In response to acidosis stress, GSCs exhibited increased de novo purine nucleotide
  biosynthesis pathway, which is under the regulation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
  The overexpression G6PD/H6PD, supports the metabolic dependency of GSCs on nucleotides
  by enhancing the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In parallel, TCA cycle flux was
  also increased, lends support for the importance of mitochondrial metabolism in
  GSCs under acidic conditions. This reprogramming of GSCs metabolism driven by acidosis
  indicates that targeting G6PD/H6PD may serve as a promising therapeutic target for
  improved glioblastoma therapeutics.
