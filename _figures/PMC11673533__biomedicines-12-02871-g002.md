caption: Mechanisms by which artificial sweeteners affect breast cancer risk via the
  gut microbiome. Artificial sweeteners affect the composition of the intestinal microbiome,
  resulting in a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in harmful bacteria,
  thereby reducing the production of SCFAs. The reduction in SCFAs triggers intestinal
  inflammation, impaired intestinal barrier function, and increased intestinal permeability,
  causing endotoxins (such as LPSs) to enter the blood and trigger a systemic inflammatory
  response. The LPS-TLR4-NF-κB signaling pathway represents an inflammatory cascade
  activated by LPSs released from pathogenic gut bacteria. Upon binding to TLR4, LPSs
  triggers the MyD88-dependent pathway, leading to the activation of NF-κB signaling,
  which subsequently induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
  IL-6 and TNF-α. This chronic inflammatory response is closely associated with the
  initiation and progression of breast cancer
