caption: Liver plays a central role in methionine catabolism as up to half of the
  daily intake of methionine is catabolized to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) in the
  liver in a reaction catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). SAMe is the
  principal biological methyl donor and donates its methyl group to a large variety
  of acceptor molecules in reactions catalyzed by methyltransferases (MTs). S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH), generated as a result of transmethylation, is a potent inhibitor of all transmethylation
  reactions. To prevent SAH accumulation, it is hydrolyzed to homocysteine and adenosine
  is through a reversible reaction catalyzed by SAH hydrolase, whose thermodynamics
  favors biosynthesis rather than hydrolysis. Prompt removal of homocysteine and adenosine
  ensures SAH is hydrolyzed. Homcysteine can be remethylated to form methionine via
  methionine synthase (MS), which requires folate and vitamin B12 and betaine homocysteine
  methyltransferase (BHMT), which requires betaine. In hepatocytes, homocysteine can
  also undergo conversion to cysteine (Cys) via the transsulfuration pathway, a two-step
  enzymatic process catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionase,
  both requiring vitamin B6. Liver has the highest activity of transsulfuration, which
  allows methionine and SAMe to be effectively utilized as GSH precursor.
