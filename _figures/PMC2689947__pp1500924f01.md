caption: Biosynthetic pathway for the production of flavonoids, proanthocyanidins,
  and other classes of small phenolic compounds produced in poplar leaves (phenolic
  acids are represented by chlorogenic acid and phenolic glycosides are represented
  by tremulacin). The flavonone illustrates the basic 15-carbon flavonoid structure
  with three rings (A–C). The C-2 and C-3 carbons at which PA starter units differ
  in stereochemistry are labeled. PAL, Phe ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate CoA-ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H,
  flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase;
  DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; FLS, flavonol synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin
  reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; MATE, multidrug
  and toxic compound extrusion transporter; UFGT, UDP-Glc flavonoid glucosyltransferase.
