caption: Metabolic pathway of mainly differential metabolites under effect of chronic
  unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and Cuscutae Semen (CS). “CON” and “CUMS+CS” represented
  control group and CS treatment group, respectively. The color bar from blue to red
  represented low to high intensity after logarithmic transformation with a base of
  10. Each group contained six samples, maintaining consistency across all groups
