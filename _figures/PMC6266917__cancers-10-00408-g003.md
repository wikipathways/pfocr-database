caption: Systemic effects of increased adiposity on EC progression. (a) A high level
  of circulating leptin binds to its receptor OB-R to trigger a signaling pathway
  as well as recruit pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF, IL-1β, and LIF to induce
  cancer progression and metastasis. (b) Increased free fatty acids (FFA), resistin,
  and decreased adiponectin secretion contribute to insulin resistance, which leads
  to an increase in insulin synthesis. Hyperinsulinemia is associated with decreased
  bioavailability of IGFBP and the simultaneous increase in IGF-1 production. Insulin
  and IGF-1 signal through IR and IGFR respectively to promote EC progression via
  mTOR activation. (c) Hypertrophied adipocytes secrete an increasing amount of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-4, IL-7), ANGPT1, and VEGF to infiltrate endothelial cells, which
  facilitates angiogenesis. VEGF acts as a key mediator of the EC cell-adipocyte interaction
  and binds to its receptor, VEGFR2, on the EC cell surface. Phosphorylation of VEGFR2
  activates downstream targets and upregulates the mTOR pathway through a high pS6
  level.
