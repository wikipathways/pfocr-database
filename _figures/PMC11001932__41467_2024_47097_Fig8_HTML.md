caption: a, b Potential routes of ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) synthesis—SBPase-TKT, TAL-TKT,
  TKT-RuPE-RPI and oxiPPP-RPI pathways. R5P produced via PPP is a substrate for phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate
  synthetase (PRPS) to make PRPP, a crucial precursor for nucleotide biogenesis. c
  SBPase disruption enables the R5P synthesis through other routes. d The ΔsbpaseΔtal
  strain meets its need for R5P via the TKT-RuPE-RPI, oxiPPP-RPI and TKT-mediated
  pathways. However, None of these routes appear to be adequate for parasite growth.
  e The supply of R5P depends on the oxiPPP-RPI and TKT-mediated pathways in the ΔsbpaseΔtalΔrupe
  strain. f TKT cooperates with SBPase, TAL and RuPE-RPI pathways to satisfy R5P requirements.
  Mutants lacking TKT rely only on the oxiPPP-RPI pathway for supplying R5P, which
  may not be sufficient. g Deletion of PRPS blocks the biosynthesis of PRPP and parasite
  growth, even though PPP can provide R5P
