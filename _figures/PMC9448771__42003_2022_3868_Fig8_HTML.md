caption: The downregulation of NAT10 in neutrophils contribute to the progress of
  sepsis by exacerbating pyroptosis in neutrophils via promoting the ULK1-STING-NLRP3
  axis. The decreased expression of NAT10 resulted in the decay of ULK1 transcripts
  and therefore the reduced expression of ULK1. As a regulator of STING phosphorylation,
  the loss of ULK1 enhanced the activation of STING-IRF3 signaling and subsequently
  the elevated pyroptosis-inducing NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils, which promotes
  the development of sepsis. Neutrophil-specific over-expression of NAT10 can restrain
  pyroptosis as well as septic lethality in mice by reversing the ULK1-STING-NLRP3
  axis.
