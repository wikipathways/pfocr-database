caption: A hypothetical mechanism for the induction of repetitive behavior in QNP-sensitized
  mice. The acute stimulation of D2 receptors induces sedation mainly through the
  G-protein-mediated pathway. After repeated stimulation of D2 receptors, NOX1 expression
  was upregulated in the CS. In QNP-sensitized mice, no apparent repetitive behavior,
  Src activation, and synaptic facilitation were observed before stimulation of D2
  receptors. In contrast, once QNP was injected, activated Src accumulated in a NOX1-dependent
  manner. Under this condition, β-arrestin-mediated D2 receptor signaling was increased,
  resulting in the facilitation of excitatory inputs in CS iMSNs. Such signal modification
  shifted the behavioral response from sedation to repetitive behavior.
