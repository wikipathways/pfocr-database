caption: The theophylline metabolic pathway. Molar percentages of the metabolites
  analyzed in our preterm infant group are expressed in parentheses. CYP1A2 is a major
  hepatic enzyme involved in the decomposition of approximately 90–95% of theophylline
  in human adults. CYP1A2 mainly catalyzes the conversion of theophylline to 1‐methylxanthine
  and 3‐methylxanthine (N‐demethylation), while CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 catalyze the conversion
  of theophylline to 1,3‐dimethyluric acid (8‐hydroxylation). 1‐Methylxanthine is
  oxidized very rapidly to 1‐methyluric acid by xanthine oxidase
