caption: A schematic representation elucidating the transformations in the metabolic
  pathways of lipid metabolites amid ARDS. The metabolic pathways of lipidic substances,
  including eicosanoids, phospholipids, and phospholipidic cells, are notably transformed
  during ARDS. This diagram broadly illustrates that lipid constituents of the cellular
  membrane are compromised by various provocateurs, including oxygen-free radicals,
  leading to a perturbation and decomposition of lipid metabolism. This results in
  the generation of pro-inflammatory and ROS-inducing lipid secondary metabolites,
  in turn exacerbating DNA damage and cellular membrane detriment. Refer the main
