caption: 'Inhibition of host signalling pathways by VACV members of A46 and related
  families. TLRs are distributed in the plasma membrane and endosomes. When a pathogen
  is recognized by a TLR adaptor proteins are recruited which transmit the signal
  further downstream until specific transcription factors are activated and enhance
  the expression of genes encoding type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. VACV
  proteins belonging to A46 and N1 families interfere with the TLR signalling pathway
  at different levels. A46 targets all known adaptor proteins: MyD88, MAL (TIRAP),
  TRIF and TRAM. A52 targets IRAK2 and TRAF6, intermediary between adaptors and transcription
  factors. K7 inhibits IRAK2, TRAF6 and also DDX3, which is part of the complex that
  activates transcription factor IRF3. B15 targets the IKK complex by avoiding IKKbeta
  phosphorylation, what eventually causes the inhibition of NF-kappaB. N1 associates
  with several components of the IKK complex and with TBK1, inhibiting NF-kappaB and
  IRF3 activation, respectively.'
