caption: Schematic diagram of proposed metabolic pathways in peach roots in response
  to BA stress. Pathway was constructed based on the KEGG database and library reference.
  The abundances of DAMs and DEGs are shown by the heatmap at 0, 72, and 120 h post
  BA treatment. The color of the heatmap changed from green to red (blue to yellow),
  indicating that the abundances of DAMs (DEGs) ranging from low to high. INV, invertase;
