caption: Schematic representation of the WNT/β-catenin signal transduction pathway.
  (Left) In the “Off” state, β-catenin is bound in a so-called β-catenin destruction
  complex containing glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), axin, adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC) and casein kinase-1 (CK-1). The kinases in this complex phosphorylate
  β-catenin, thereby targeting it for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system.
  (Right) In the “On” state, the receptor complex consisting of frizzled and LRP5/6
  bind WNT, which recruits the disheveled (DVL) protein to the plasma membrane. Subsequently,
  several components of the β-catenin destruction complex are recruited to the membrane,
  which prevents the phosphorylation of β-catenin. Therefore, this protein can now
  accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus to associate with transcription
  factors and stimulate the transcription of WNT target genes such as cycline-D1,
  c-myc, and axin2.
