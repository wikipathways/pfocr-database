caption: 'Renin-Angiotensin System Pathway and Skeletal Muscle: A Complex Interaction.
  Schematic drawing shows the classical (blue) and non-classical (yellow) pathway
  of the renin-angiotensin system and their multiple effects on the skeletal muscle.
  The pro-fibrotic/atrophic stimuli of the Ang II/AT1R axis are counterbalanced by
  the positive metabolic effects on the muscular tissue induced by the Ang 1-7/Mas
  receptor (MasR) axis. Of note, the ACEIs/ARBs modulate such an intricate “biochemical
  tangle” at specific and multiple levels with different consequences from each other,
  especially as regards the neuromuscular system. In+IR; insulin and insulin receptor,
  ARB; angiotensin (Ang) II receptor type I (AT1R) blocker, IGF-R; insulin-like growth
  factor receptor'
