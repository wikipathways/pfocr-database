caption: Working model of IRE1-XBP1 signaling pathway during coronavirus infection,
  using IBV as an example. IRE1 mediates XBP1 splicing, which up-regulates UPR target
  genes to restore ER stress, and the spliced XBP1 may also modulate the IFN and cytokine
  secretion. IRE1 activation modulates the phosphorylation of Akt and JNK, thus affecting
  IBV-induced apoptosis. IRE1 is also responsible for basal activity of IKK, which
  phosphorylates IκBα to remove its inhibition on NF-κB, thus facilitating the production
  of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pointed arrows indicate activation,
  and blunt-ended lines indicate inhibition. The question mark indicates hypothetical
  mechanism.
