caption: During periods of homeostasis, the physiological range enables cells, tissues,
  and organisms to cope with minor changes in redox status. However, external or internal
  perturbations, that exceed the homeostatic range, trigger the transient activation
  of adaptive responses. Adaptive homeostasis is activated following exposure to sub‐lethal,
  non‐damaging amounts of a signalling event – such as exposure to nanomolar levels
  of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Although toxic amounts of a stressor can also induce
  adaptive responses, it is actually not the damage but rather the initial signalling
  that is important; this distinguishes adaptive homeostasis from hormesis (Davies,
  ). Initial exposure to low amounts of signalling agent or conditions triggers transcriptional
  activation, within minutes. One of the most notable pathways for adaptive homeostasis
  is the nuclear recruitment and binding of Nrf2 to antioxidant response elements
  (AREs), also called electrophile response elements (EPREs), located in the upstream
  activation sites of key stress protective genes. Following transcription, translational
  activation occurs over a period of hours, resulting in the upregulation of stress
  responsive enzymes, including the 20S Proteasome and the mitochondrial Lon protease.
  In turn, elevation in the levels of such protective enzymes better prepare cells,
  tissues, or organisms, to cope with future, potentially more harmful, stresses.
  Lastly, as the adaptive response is transient, adaptive homeostasis will gradually
  contract back to the basal homeostatic range.
