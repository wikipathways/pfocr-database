caption: Metabolic alterations in leukemia cells. Important reactions of the metabolic
  pathway in leukemia cells are summarized in the schematic, including glycolysis,
  glutaminolysis, lipogenesis, TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation (FAO), pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) (blue). Dominant nutrient transporters and metabolic enzymes are emphasized
  (brown). GLUT, glucose transporter; HK2, hexokinase-2; PKM2, pyruvate kinase isozymes
  M2; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MCT, monocarboxylate transporters; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; ASCT2, glutamine transporter encoded by Solute Carrier Family 1 Member
  5 gene; GLS, glutaminase; FASN, fatty acid synthase; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  I; IDH2, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2; IDO, Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase; α-KG,
  alpha-ketoglutarate; SucCoA, Succinyl-CoA; OAA, oxaloacetate. The figure was produced
