caption: 'Statistically significant differential expression (Log2-fold change, LFC;
  Wald test, P < 0.05) of methanogenesis genes in M. barkeri strain MS. Differential
  expression of each gene across 7 assessed conditions is indicated via heatmap. Averages
  are presented for multi-copy genes (for exact values, reference Tables  and ). Differential
  expression of genes in 0 °C perchlorate-amended transcriptomes are relative to the
  expression patterns of the 0 °C perchlorate-free control. Perchlorate-amended 30
  °C and 0 °C perchlorate-free control transcriptomes are relative to the expression
  patterns of the 30 °C perchlorate-free control. Crossed white boxes indicate no
  statistically significant difference in expression. Heatmaps are excluded from genes
  exhibiting no significant differential expression across all conditions. Genes involved
  in non-hydrogenotrophic (H2/CO2) pathways are encompassed in colored boxes with
  pathway directionality indicated by matching arrowheads (green: methylamines; pink:
  acetate; yellow: methanol). Full names of listed genes and metabolites are found
  in Tables  and , respectively.'
