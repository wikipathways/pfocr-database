caption: Long-patch BER pathway. The black star represents a 5′ end modification that
  is not a substrate for the lyase activity of POLβ. In this scenario, or in situations
  of low intracellular ATP concentration where ligation is impeded, strand-displacement
  synthesis is carried out by POLβ, or one of the replication-associated polymerases,
  POLε or POLδ, to generate a 5′ flap structure. This structure is processed by FEN1,
  and repair is completed, likely in cooperation with its interacting protein partners
  proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and LIG1.
