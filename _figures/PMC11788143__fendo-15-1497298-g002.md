caption: Signalling pathways in pancreatic and peripancreatic cells whose abnormalities
  cause diabetes of the young at maturity (MODY). 1. The influx of glucose to the
  β-cell through GLUT-2 facilitates the transition of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate
  by GCK enzyme. This results in increased ATP production in mitochondria after the
  entry of G6P to the Krebs cycle. The subsequent closure of ATP-sensitive potassium
  channels and opening of voltage-gated calcium channels permit the release of insulin
  from the β cell. 2. The regulation of gene expression within the nucleus is depicted
  by the arrows. These indicate that a specific gene is regulated by the corresponding
  transcription factor (TF) in mature beta cells. Additionally, the arrows illustrate
  that a given protein has a binding site for the corresponding TF and/or is regulated
  by it at some point during pancreatic development. 3. The synthesis of insulin occurs
  within the cytosol, where preproinsulin is produced. Subsequently, the signal peptide
  is cleaved by endopeptidases within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during the processing
  of preproinsulin. The final stages of proinsulin processing occur in the Golgi apparatus,
  including the formation of the final vesicle, the release of C-peptide from insulin
  within the Golgi apparatus and within the vesicles, and exocytosis. 4. The illustration
  depicts the binding sites of the insulin promoter to MODY-related transcription
  factors. The mutations in question are those that occur in the promoter region of
  the INS gene, which prevent transcription factors from binding to cis-elements.
  Another category of mutation is that which occurs in the start codon, which abolishes
  translation. Finally, changes in the non-translated regions of mRNA have been observed,
  which increase the sensitivity of the molecule to RNA degradation. MODY-related
  transcription factors (PDX1, NEUROD1, HNF1a, HNF4a, HNF1b, and RFX6) play a pivotal
  role in pancreatic development, B-cell identification, and mature B-cell function.
  5. Adiponectin (Ad) binding to the extracellular COOH terminus of adiponectin receptor
  1 (AdipoR1) recruits APPL1 to the intracellular NH2 terminus of AdipoR1 and activation
  of AMPK, p38 MAPK, and Rab5. Binding of adiponectin to AdipoR1 stimulates glucose
  transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation and glucose uptake through phosphorylated AMPK,
  phosphorylated p38 MAPK, and Rab5. 6. Serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor
  substrate (IRS) proteins has been demonstrated to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation
  and insulin signalling, thereby activating Akt and facilitating glucose uptake.
  7.The binding of adiponectin to its receptor results in the activation of AMPK,
  which, in turn, activates tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2). Upon activation,
  TSC2, in conjunction with TSC1, inhibits the activity of Ras homology enriched in
  brain (Rheb), thereby suppressing the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) and S6 kinase (S6K). The inhibition of S6K by adiponectin enhances the ability
  of insulin to stimulate IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, which in turn leads to Akt
  phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the insulin signalling pathway (20,
  94–99)
