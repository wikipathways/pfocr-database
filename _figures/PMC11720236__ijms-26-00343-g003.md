caption: 'Mechanisms of exercise modulation of renal fibrosis. Exercise exerts its
  beneficial effects on renal fibrosis through various mechanisms: Exercise suppresses
  NOX4-dependent ROS production in the kidney, thereby inhibiting the NF-κB/NLPR3
  inflammasome pathway, or by targeting Sirt1, which ultimately ameliorates renal
  fibrosis associated with diabetic nephropathy. Exercise inhibits the TGF-β/Smad
  pathway or reduces Ang II content, diminishes AT1R and Ang II binding, and inhibits
  the Ang II-AT1R-TGF-β pathway. These actions contribute to the mitigation of renal
  fibrosis development in hypertensive conditions. In aging kidneys, exercise improves
  renal fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-β1/TAK1/MKK3/p38 MAPK signaling pathway, enhancing
  autophagy activity, and delaying the epithelial–mesenchymal transition, or activating
  PPAR α to reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid accumulation by inhibiting
  the expression of miR-21 and miR-34a. TGF-β1: transforming growth factor-β1; TAK1:
