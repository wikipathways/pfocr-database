caption: Model summarizing the role of known BDNF–TrkB signaling pathways on long-distance
  BDNF signaling. The findings from our study suggest that BDNF in the axon activates
  TrkB receptors and PLC-γ, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration
  (Ca2+). This, in turn, promotes the endocytosis of the receptor and the formation
  of signaling endosomes. The first step in this process enables the retrograde transport
  of signaling endosomes to the cell body, contributing to an elevation in CREB phosphorylation
  and dendritic arborization. Notably, we observed that cell body PLC-γ activity was
  not essential for CREB phosphorylation induced by axonal BDNF. In previous research,
  we demonstrated that PI3K activity is not necessary for endocytosis or transport
  of signaling endosomes but plays a crucial role in mTOR-dependent translation of
  CREB target genes (). This process was also needed for dendritic arborization induced
  by BDNF in the axons.
