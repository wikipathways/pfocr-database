caption: Adrenal–gut–brain axis imbalance contributes to aggravation of diabetes-related
  depression. In diabetes, hyperglycemia and hypercortisolism are associated with
  gut microbiota dysbiosis, as well as with changes in the central nervous system.
  Furthermore, the dysbiosis favors disruption of the endothelial intestinal barrier
  and the translocation of bacterial products into the blood, activating inflammatory
  signaling pathways. In the central nervous system, alterations in the physiology
  of the hippocampus are observed, associated with an imbalance in the neurotransmitters
  and a decrease in BDNF levels. Together, the exacerbation of neuroinflammation and
  glutamatergic transmission in the brain results in the worsening of depressive symptoms
  and the development of the treatment-resistant depression in diabetic patients.
