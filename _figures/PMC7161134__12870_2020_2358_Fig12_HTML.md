caption: Proposed model of “plant hormone signal transduction” and “starch and sucrose
  metabolism” during drought stress. ABA controls the activity of BAM1 and AMY3 through
  the AREB/ABF-SnRK2 kinase-signaling pathway, and resulting a fraction of the maltose
  released from starch, and metabolized into sucrose and free hexoses. Then the sucrose
  exported to the root to enhance drought resistance. The solid and broken arrows
  indicate activation and speculative regulation, respectively, whereas lines ending
  with a bar show negative regulation
