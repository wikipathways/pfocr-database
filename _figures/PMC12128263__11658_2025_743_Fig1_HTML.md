caption: Schematic diagram of disulfidptosis mechanism in SLC7 A11 overexpressed cells.
  Under glucose-starvation conditions, the activity of the PPP is diminished, resulting
  in reduced production of NADPH. In this context, cells with high expression of SLC7
  A11 use NADPH as a substrate to take up excessive cystine and reduce it to cysteine.
  When NADPH is depleted, cystine cannot be reduced, resulting in cystine accumulation
  and disulfide stress. Disulfide stress exacerbates the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton
  network by activating the Rac-WRC-Arp2/3 signaling pathway, ultimately leading to
  disulfidptosis. The graphic was created by Adobe Illustrator
