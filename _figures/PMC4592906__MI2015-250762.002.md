caption: TNF-induced programmed cell death pathways. Cell death is induced by various
  stimuli that are recognized by specific sensors. These receptors recruit the complex
  I protein platform (TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, and cIAP1/2), activating the inflammatory
  response and survival. Deubiquitination of RIP1 induces complex II (FADD and caspase-8),
  activating the apoptotic pathway. Inhibition of caspase-8 and increase of RIP3 expression
  induces complex IIb (necrosome), activating the necroptotic pathway. TNF receptor
  1 (TNFR1); TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD); receptor-interacting interacting
  protein 1 (RIP1); receptor-interacting interacting protein (RIP3); TNFR-associated
  factor 2 (TRAF2); inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2); linear ubiquitin
  chain assembly complex (LUBAC); Lys63-linked polyubiquitination (Lys63-Ub); LUBAC;
  TAB-transforming growth factor-activated kinase 1 (TAK1); cylindromatosis (CYLD);
  Fas-associated protein with a death domain (FADD); mixed lineage kinase domain-like
  (MLKL); Dynamin-related protein (Drp1); dendritic cells (DCs); Damage-Associated
  Molecular Patterns (DAMPS).
