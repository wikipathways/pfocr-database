caption: Figure 3. TLR4 signaling (simplified). LPS binds the homodimeric TLR4 receptor
  with the help of MD2 molecule. Ligation of the receptor allows the cytoplasmic TIR
  domain to interact with accessory molecules. Generally, there are two pathways.
  One, through MyD88 leads to activation of the NFκB transcription factor, which induces
  expression of inflammatory cytokines. The second pathway, through TRAM, activates
  IRFs. IRF8 interacts with other transcription factors leading to inflammatory gene
  expression. IRF3 is phosphorylated, homodimerizes and induces IFNβ production, which
  in an auto- and paracrine way can stimulate cells to induce IRF1 and STAT1 in the
  JAK-STAT dependent manner.
