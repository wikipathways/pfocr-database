caption: Simplified representation of the MIA biosynthesis in C. roseus leaves highlighting
  the cellular organization of the pathway in internal phloem associated parenchyma
  (blue rectangles), epidermis (pink rectangles), laticifers/idioblastes (yellow rectangles).
  Known single enzymatic steps are indicated by grey/red arrowheads and abbreviation
  of enzyme names. Broken grey/red arrows indicate unknown enzymatic steps. Conversion
  of tabersonine may occur in two ways to generate vindorosine (red arrows) or vindoline
  (grey). MEP, methyl-D-erythritol phosphate; GPPS, geranyl diphosphate synthase;
  GES, geraniol synthase; G10H, geraniol 10-hydroxylase; 10HGO, 10-hydroxygeraniol
  oxidoreductase; IO, iridoid oxidase; IS, iridoid synthase; 7DLGT, 7-deoxyloganetic
  acid glucosyltransferase; 7DLH, 7-deoxyloganic acid 7-hydroxylase; LAMT, loganic
  acid O-methyltransferase; SLS, secologanin synthase; TDC, tryptophan decarboxylase;
