caption: Pathway on the left is that of an active cell. The non-functional complex
  GSK/APC/Axin (see text) allows the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and
  thus its entry into the nucleus, where it activates proto-oncogenes tcf /lef, which
  encode gene product potential oncoproteins TCF/LEF (see text). If the GSK/APC/Axin
  complex suffered loss-of-function mutations, the process continues constitutively
  expressed, and becomes irreversible. It renders the cell cycle non-responsive to
  negative control. The cell undergoes “malignant transformation”. If the fully functional
  GSK/APC/Axin complex switches itself on, phosphorylated β-catenin will be destroyed
  in the cytoplasm by ubiquitination and the cell rests (pathway on the right). Picture
