caption: Canonical TCR signaling pathway. Established signaling cascades in activated
  T cells with quantitative Zap-70 null/Zap-70 reconstituted SILAC ratio data represented
  as heatmaps besides individual proteins. Heatmaps represent averages of five replicate
  experiments. In the heatmap representation, green represents elevated phosphorylation
  in response to Zap-70 removal, whereas red represents a decrease in phosphorylation
  in response to Zap-70 removal. Black represents no change. Blanks in the heatmap
  indicate that a clearly defined SIC peak was not observed for that phosphopeptide
  in that time point. The utility of this visual representation is validated by the
  large number of red heatmap bars downstream of Zap-70 in the canonical pathway.
  Note that the * next to the phosphorylation site signifies that this site has been
  previously described in the literature.
