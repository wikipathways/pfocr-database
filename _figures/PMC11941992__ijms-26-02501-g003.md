caption: 'Summary of the mechanisms by which visceral obesity is a triggering factor
  for both systemic inflammation and insulin resistance (IR). Adopted from [28]. Strongly
  enlarged adipocytes in the obese visceral adipose tissue (AT) fail to maintain longer
  metabolic homeostasis because the lipid overload leads to endoplasmic reticulum
  stress, increased expression of the inflammation regulator NF-kB, and the production
  of inflammation-inducing signals [135]. This chronic metabolism-induced inflammation
  or meta-inflammation in obese AT activates the resident immune cells, including
  macrophages, B cells, T cells, and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [145]. A high-fat
  diet (HFD), an increased flux of free fatty acids (FFAs) accumulating damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) from necrotic AT, and hypoxia-induced factor 1 (HIF-1)
  trigger both innate and adaptive immune responses [135]. The resulting low-grade
  chronic AT inflammation manifests as significantly elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory
  adipokines and cytokines as well as through the overproduction of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) [117,126,130,146,147,148,149,150]. Such an inflammatory environment
  interferes with insulin signaling via the insulin receptor (INSR) through antibodies/autoantibodies
  against both insulin (INS) and INSR [151,152]; tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1)
  through the inhibition of tyrosine autophosphorylation (pY) within the INSR and/or
  serine/threonine phosphorylation (pS) of the insulin receptor substrates (IRSs)
  [152,153,154,155]; and receptors for other pro-inflammatory cytokines (Recs) through
  abnormal, similar to that observed for TNFR1 signaling, phosphorylation of the INSR
  and IRSs [153,154,156]. Disrupted downstream signaling via the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) and phosphoinositide
  3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathways
  eventually lead to IR. The resulting hyperglycemia may increase the inflammatory
  response by itself and lead to systemic inflammation [157,158,159]. The remaining
  abbreviations: ANGPTL2—angiopoietin-like 2 protein; IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18—the
  respective interleukins; MCP-1—monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (also known as
