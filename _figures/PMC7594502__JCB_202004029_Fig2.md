caption: Overview of the numerous receptors and pathways involved in mitophagy following
  different stressors. Depolarization drives mitophagy through the PINK1/Parkin pathway,
  which involves the adapters NDP52 and OPTN, whose activity is modified by TBK1 phosphorylation.
  PHB2 is an IMM protein that is exposed during depolarization following proteolytic
  cleavage of the OMM. Similarly, cardiolipin is a lipid predominantly localized to
  the IMM, but it translocates to the OMM after stress. Additional mitophagy pathways
  involve the mitophagy receptors, mitochondrial proteins which possess LIR motifs
  that allow interaction and recruitment of ATG8 members directly following stressors
  such as hypoxia, differentiation, and infection. LLO, listeriolysin O; P, phosphate;
  Ub, ubiquitin. Figure was created with BioRender.com.
