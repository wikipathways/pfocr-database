caption: Major management pathways for patients known to have Los Angeles grades C
  and D oesophagitis. The pathways shown do not take into account the special (and
  controversial) needs for management of Barrett's oesophagus (statements 28, 29, and
  53). Costs are minimised by the use of symptom response for guidance on the success
  or failure of therapy, rather than endoscopy (statement 62). Symptom control is
  defined in this setting as the reduction of symptoms to a level that does not impair
  health related quality of life (statements 11 and 62). For explanation of the exclusive
  use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) in this patient category, see the section of
  text entitled "Management pathways in patients with severe oesophagitis (Los Angeles
  grades C and D)". Anti-reflux surgery is an appropriate option at any point in the
  pathway, subject to patient preference and surgeon skill (statements 63-65), but
  especially should be considered once the patient has been evaluated by initial management
  strategies.
