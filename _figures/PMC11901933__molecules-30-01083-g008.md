caption: The reparative potential of LF in UVB-exposed HaCaT cells. LF demonstrated
  significant antioxidant properties by reducing ROS formation and inhibiting the
  expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9, which are enzymes linked to collagen
  degradation. Additionally, LF regulated the TIMP expression, contributing to the
  inhibition of MMP activity. LF also modulated the HAS2/HYAL1 signaling axis, essential
  for skin hydration, and activated the TGF-β signaling pathway, promoting collagen
  synthesis. These effects suggest that LF plays a key role in mitigating UVB-induced
  damage and enhancing the skin’s reparative mechanisms
