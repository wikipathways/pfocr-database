caption: Nonproliferating cells are capable of removing ICLs in a manner that is independent
  of DNA replication. Depending upon the type of ICL or whether the ICL has interfered
  with RNA transcription, the XPC/HR23B (global genome NER) or CSB (transcription-coupled
  NER) protein recognizes the lesion and stimulates ‘unhooking’ by the XPF-ERCC1 endonuclease.
  A single stranded DNA gap is formed that attracts Replication Protein A (RPA) which
  in turn promotes RAD18/RAD6-dependent monoubiquitination of PCNA. Monoubiquitinated
  PCNA recruits REV1/Polζ and/or Polκ to the site where they perform TLS opposite
  the unhooked lesion, the latter presumably removed by a second set of NER reactions
  to return the DNA duplex to its original state. If the lesion is not removed in
  G1 (left panel), convergence of DNA polymerases on an unrepaired ICL during DNA
  replication initiates the Fanconi anemaia (FA) pathway involving detection of the
  ICL by the FA core complex followed by ubiquitination of the FANCD2/FANCI heterodimer
  in the late S/G2 phase of the cell cycle (right panel). Ubiquitinated FANCD2/FANCDI
  promotes excision or ‘unhooking’ of the ICL by structure-dependent endonucleases
  and likely promotes TLS opposite the ‘unhooked’ ICL in preparation for homologous
  recombination (HR). MUS81-EME1, SNM1A, FAN1, XPF-ERCC1 and SLX1-SLX4 are structure
  specific endonucleases thought to be involved in unhooking the ICL, generating ICL-associated
  double strand breaks (DSBs) and nucleolytic processing of the ICL during repair.
  SLX4 has also been shown to be an endonuclease scaffold protein and mutations in
  the SLX4 gene cause Fanconi anemia. FAAP20 interacts with the FA core complex and
  directly binds to REV1. The mismatch repair protein MSH2 is implicated in ICL repair
  through an unknown mechanism. The FA pathway and REV1/Polζ can promote HR repair
  of a direct DSB. We speculate that REV1 and Polζ are not only involved in TLS across
  the ‘unhooked ICL’ but also perform DNA synthesis during HR repair when the template
  is incompatible for normal replicative DNA polymerases.
