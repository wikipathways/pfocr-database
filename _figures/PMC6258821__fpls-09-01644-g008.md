caption: 'Proposed initial routes of topramezone metabolism in multiple herbicide-resistant
  waterhemp (SIR population) and tolerant maize. The benzoic acid metabolite of topramezone
  was only detected in maize, desmethyl-topramezone was a major metabolite formed
  in maize but minor in SIR, and both hydroxytopramezone metabolites were major metabolites
  detected in SIR but very low in maize. Dotted lines indicate two possible structures
  of the hydroxytopramezone-2 metabolite from Figure : the hemiaminal metabolite that
  likely forms transiently in maize (; ) but possibly accumulates in the SIR population,
  and a putative isoxazole ring hydroxylation metabolite (positional isomer) that
  has not been previously reported in plants or animals ().'
