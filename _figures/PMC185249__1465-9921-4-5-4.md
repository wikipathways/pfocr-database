caption: Signal transduction in the Transforming Growth Factor β(TGFβ) family pathway
  is finely regulated at many levels. Outside the cell latent Transforming Growth
  Factor β (LTGFβ) is activated by plasmin (uPA) among other unknown extracellular
  proteases. Thrombospondin-1 and β6 integrin play key roles in assembly and activation
  of the proteolytic complex. Free TGF β ligand is bound extracellularly and may be
  sequestered by Decorin. Noggin and Gremlin play similar roles to Decorin, but for
  Bone Morphogenetic Protein ligands. The TGF β type III receptor (IIIR), also termed
  betaglycan, presents ligand to the preformed TGF β type I (IR) and type II (IIR)
  receptor tetrameric signaling complex. This is particularly important with TGFβ
  2, where betaglycan substantially increases its binding affinity for the receptor
  signaling complex. Non Smad signaling pathways activated by ligand binding include
  Ras-ERK, Rho-JNK, RhoA-p160RCCK, TAK1-p38MAPK and PP2A-S6 kinase. Ligand binding
  also facilitates phosphorylation and activation of the TGFβ IR serine-threonine
  kinase domain by the TGFβ IIR serine-threonine kinase domain. TGFβ IR in turn phosphorylates
  receptor Smads 2/3. The interaction of Smads with the TGFβ IR is facilitated by
  SARA. BAMBI is a dominant negative, kinase deficient isoform of TGFβ receptor. Smad
  7 is an inhibitory Smad that inhibits Smad 2/3 association with Smad4, the co-Smad.
  Smad7 is a rapidly inducible negative regulator of TGFβ signaling. Phosphorylated
  receptor Smads 2/3 then associate with the co-Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus,
  where they coactivate or corepress certain specific target genes by binding to their
  respective transcription complexes, with or without directly contacting DNA, depending
  on the promoter in question. Smurf mediate ubiquitination of preformed Smad complexes,
  thereby negatively regulating Smad signaling to the nucleus. C-Ski and Sno-N are
  transcriptional factors that negatively regulate Smad activity in the nucleus.
