caption: The energy stress pathway kinases LKB1 and AMPK are activated by TCR and
  CD28 co-stimulatory signals, with AMPK activity being mediated, in part, by the
  Ca2+–CAMMK2 pathway. Energy stress, such as deprivation of glucose or glutamine
  or an imbalance of AMP/ADP-to-ATP ratio, can also promote LKB1–AMPK signaling. Upstream
  nutrient-sensing proteins, such as the Fnip–Flcn complex and Roquin, can restrain
  AMPK function, although the contribution of Fnip and Flcn to AMPK signaling in T
  cells is still unknown. The activation of LKB1 is associated with changes in mitochondrial
  metabolism and fitness, as well as increased mevalonate metabolism under certain
  contexts. By regulating the activity of several downstream targets, AMPK signaling
  can impede metabolic programming toward glycolysis, glutaminolysis and fatty acid
  synthesis, while promoting catabolic processes, such as mitophagy and autophagy.
  AMPK also supports mitochondrial fitness by driving mitochondrial biogenesis and
  mitochondrial dynamics by promoting mitochondrial fission.
