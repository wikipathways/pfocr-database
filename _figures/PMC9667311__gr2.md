caption: 13C isotopologue analysis of IC-UHR-MS1and MS2data shows enhanced oxidative
  PPP in response to selenite in A549 spheroids or to arsenite transformation in BEAS-2B
  cells.A, A549 spheroids. B, BEAS-2B cells. 13C atoms were traced from [13C6]-Glc
  (A) or [13C5,15N2]-Gln (B) into the PPP and gluconeogenic products. Brackets in
  (A) denote 13C products of the reverse transaldolase (TALDO) reaction, while green
  curves and arrows delineate the recombination of R5P moiety with X5P (TKT reaction)
  or F6P moiety with E4P (TALDO reaction) to generate sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P).
  Due to space limitation, not all possible labeled products are shown. The same sets
  of extracts as in  were analyzed by IC-UHR-MS1 and DI-MS2. The X-/Y-axes and number
  of replicates are as in . 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate; G6PD/PGD,
  glucose-6-phosphate/6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; GPI, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate;
  S7P, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate; TK, transketolase; X5P, xylulose 5-phosphate; all
  other abbreviations and symbols are as in . ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01.
