caption: Methanogenesis pathway framework. (a) The basic structure of methanogenesis
  showing where the major growth substrates across all methanogens enter the pathway.
  The simplest methanogens are only capable of growing on CO2/H2 and/or formate while
  the most complex methanogens are also capable of methylotrophic and acetotrophic
  growth. H4S/MPT stands for tetrahydrosarcinapterin (H4SPT) and tetrahydromethanopterin
  (H4MPT). The former is found exclusively in Methanosarcinales whereas the latter
  is found in all other methanogens. (b) The hypothesized methanogenesis pathways
  for M. hungatei (iMhu428) []. Although it cannot use acetate as an energy source,
  the pathway to take up acetate is still present to shuttle it into gluconeogenesis.
  (c) The hypothesized methanogenesis pathway for M. acetivorans (iST807) []. The
  conventional CO2 reduction pathway is only run in reverse as this methanogen cannot
  metabolize CO2. (d) The hypothesized methanogenesis pathway for M. barkeri (iAF692)
  [] which bears great resemblance to that of M. acetivorans. The major differences
  between the two organisms' methanogenesis pathways lie in the electron transport
  chain (ETC). The specific pathways for each methanogen follow the same topological
  structure as the general methanogenesis illustration. Red circles are metabolites
  while green diamonds signify enzymatic reactions of the pathway.
