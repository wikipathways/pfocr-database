caption: The canonical Wnt/β‐catenin(WβC) signalling pathway. In WβC pathway, Wnt
  signal activation is tightly controlled by a dynamic signalling complex, constituted
  by class Frizzled (Fzd) of the G‐protein‐coupled receptor (GPCRs) superfamily, the
  LDL receptor‐related protein (LRP) 5/6 coreceptors and Dishevelled (Dvl) and Axin
  adapters. (a) In the absence of a Wnt ligand, (Wnt‐off) the signalling cascade is
  inhibited. Cytoplasmic β‐catenin is phosphorylated and degraded via proteasome mediated
  destruction, which is controlled by the “destruction complex”, consisting of glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), casein kinase 1α (CK1α), the scaffold protein AXIN,
  and the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (Janda et al., ). As a
  result, the translocation into nucleus is inhibited. Interruption of WβC‐signalling
  also occurs in the presence of the Dkk' and secreted FZD‐related proteins (sFRPs)
  families of Wnt‐antagonists, or Wnt inhibitory protein, WIF. (b) Conversely, Wnt
  ligand binding to Fzd receptors at the surface of target cells (Wnt‐on) triggers
  a chain of events aimed at disrupting the degradation complex via Dvl phosphorylation.
  Then β‐catenin is separated from the destruction complex, resulting in its accumulation
  and stabilization in the cytoplasm (Janda et al., ). Subsequently, β‐catenin is
  imported into the nucleus where it can interact with the TCF/LEF family of transcription
  factors and recruit transcriptional co‐activators, p300 and/or CBP (CREB‐binding
  protein), as well as other components to transcribe a panel of downstream target
  genes. The amplification of canonical WβC‐signalling can be achieved through the
  participation of another set of receptors, the leucine‐rich repeat‐containing G‐protein
  coupled receptors (LGR4, 5, 6) and their ligands, the R‐Spondins (Rspos) and the
  atypical FZD4/LRP5 agonist, Norrin
