caption: Model for the role of Mal connecting PI3K to TLR2/6. NFκB activation in response
  to di- and triacylated TLR2 ligands occurs in an MyD88-dependent fashion. The cytoplasmic
  TLR2 adaptor comprises Mal upstream of MyD88 in the TLR2/6-dependent NFκB pathway.
  Mal binds to PIP2-rich domains in the plasma membrane through its specific PIP2-binding
  domain. Mal furthermore binds directly to p85α, the regulatory subunit of PI3K,
  which uses PIP2 as its substrate for PIP3 generation. In addition, PI3K activates
  downstream events like Akt phosphorylation and macrophage polarization. In the case
  of TLR2/1 ligands (Pam3CSK4) another adaptor may mediate PI3K activation, as this
  process occurs in the absence of Mal and MyD88.
