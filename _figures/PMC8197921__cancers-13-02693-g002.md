caption: Trafficking of THs to the brain across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). T4
  is the main hormone crossing the BBB. It then enters astrocytes through both OATP1C1
  (green rectangles) and MCT8 (yellow ovals) transporters, as well as through other
  transporters (blue rectangles), such as LAT1/LAT2. T3 is much less represented in
  the blood; a few molecules can perhaps reach astrocytes through MCT8. Once in the
  astrocytes, T4 is converted to T3 by deiodinase 2 (DIO2). T3 can then exit astrocytes
  through transporters that are not well characterized (grey rectangles) and enter
  neurons through MCT8. In the neuron, T3 can enter the nucleus and bind its nuclear
  receptors (pathway a) or it can be catabolized by DIO3 (pathway b).
