caption: Pathway diagram of major metabolic pathways. This pathway is constructed
  based on the KEGG pathway. The color denotes the different expression levels. Dark
  red denotes upregulation in DSB vs. DSC, blue shows that DEGs or metabolites are
  upregulated in DSA vs. DSB and downregulation in DSB vs. DSC, strong green denotes
  downregulation in DSA vs. DSB and DSB vs. DSC. Blue denotes downregulation in DSA
  vs. DSB or DSA vs. DSC or DSB vs. DSC, red denotes upregulation in DSA vs. DSB and
  DSB vs. DSC, and purple denotes with upregulation in DSA vs. DSC and DSB vs. DSC.
