caption: 'Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to treat lymphoma. Pharmacological inhibition
  of mTORC1 with rapalogs has produced clinical responses in patients with relapsed
  non-Hodgkin lymphoma and classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Second-generation mTOR inhibitors
  and inhibitors of upstream molecules such as Akt and PI3K are currently in clinical
  trials. Frequently, cancer cells have several activated survival pathways, including
  the MEK/ERK, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT pathways. A combination of small molecules may
  be required to target these pathways. Abbreviations: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; JAK, Janus kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa-B; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;
  STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TSC, tuberous sclerosis
  complex. Reproduced from Hematology by Anas Younes. Copyright 2009 from the American
