caption: 'Cross talk of the Nodal/Cripto-1 signaling pathway with Wnt, hypoxia, Notch,
  Oct-4, and Nanog signaling pathways. Activated Smad-2/Smad-3/Smad-4 complex can
  bind to specific TGF-β binding elements within the Cripto-1 promoter and regulate
  Cripto-1 gene expression. Wnt signaling pathway: Cripto-1 is a downstream target
  gene of the Wnt/β-catenin canonical pathway. Non-canonical Wnt11 can also bind to
  Cripto-1 and, in a complex with Frizzled 7 (Fzd7) and Glypican-4, induces β-catenin
  activation. Hypoxia: Hypoxia through HIF-1α directly regulates Cripto-1 expression
  in ES cells through binding to specific HREs within the Cripto-1 promoter. ES cells
  specific transcription factors: Oct-4 and Nanog directly regulate Cripto-1 expression
  in ES cells by binding to the Cripto-1 promoter. Notch signaling pathway: Cripto-1
  directly interacts with Notch in ER/Golgi membranes and enhances cleavage of the
  Notch extracellular domain, potentiating the Notch ligand-activated signal. Nodal–independent
  Cripto-1 signaling pathway: Cripto-1, independently of Nodal, binds to Glypican-1
  and induces activation of c-Src/MAPK/AKT, leading to cell motility and EMT. TBE:
  TCF/LEF binding elements; HRE: hypoxia binding elements; SBE: Smad binding elements;
  CBP: CREB binding protein; TCF/LEF: T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor. EMT
  indicates epithelial to mesenchymal transition; Notch ICD, Notch intracellular domain;
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GDF, Growth and Differentiation Factor; LRP, low-density
  lipoprotein receptor-related protein; and MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase.'
