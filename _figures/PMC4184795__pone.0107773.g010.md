caption: PP-1, ADV-1, SNF-5, and RCO-1/RCM-1 are transcription factors required for
  CAT fusion. MIK-1/MEK-1/MAK-1 and NRC-1/MEK-2/MAK-2 are two MAP kinase pathways
  required for CAT fusion. HAM-2/HAM-3/HAM-4/MOB-3/PP2A/PPG-1 form the STRIPAK complex
  that regulates MAK-1 nuclear accumulation. HAM-1/SO and MAK-2 engage in Ping-Pong
  signaling behavior during CAT fusion. HAM-6/HAM-7/HAM-8 are required at the plasma
  membrane/cell wall for MAK-1 pathway activation. HAM-10 may regulate vesicular trafficking
  and could potentially respond to calcium signaling during cell fusion. AMPH-1 regulates
  vesicular trafficking and endocytosis during cell fusion. WHI-2 may regulate the
  MAP kinase pathways through a general stress response pathway. The role of HAM-9
  during CAT fusion remains to be determined.
