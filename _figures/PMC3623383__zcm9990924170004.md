caption: Cross talk between all the SPIs. The regulatory effects which may be explained
  through an indirect pathway have not been represented to make comprehension easier
  (i.e., the effects that HilD, HilC, HilE, PhoQ-PhoP, and SirA-BarA exert on either
  SPI-4 or SPI-5). According to the evidence reported in the text, the regulators
  marked with an asterisk are those proposed to act in this model on the SPI-2 genes
  via SsrA-SsrB. The roles reported for Lon and DnaK regarding systemic virulence
  have not been included in this model, since there is no specific information about
  their target genes. (A) Regulators positively influencing expression of the SPI
  genes. (B) Regulators leading to a repressor effect.
