caption: H. pylori CagA and peptidoglycan translocated by the type IV secretion system
  into GECs promote a suppressive environment. H. pylori CagA and peptidoglycan injected
  into GECs lead to a reduction of B7-H2 expression by activating the p70 S6 kinase
  pathway. H. pylori CagA also promotes PD-L1 (B7-H1) expression by GECs. Both of
  these responses combined promote a suppressive environment because the ICOS-L–ICOS
  interaction is critical for Th17 cell development, maintenance, and function and
  in the absence of the interaction Th17, cells fail to develop. PD-L1 provides inhibitory
  signals for effector Th cells and promotes differentiation of Treg cells ()
