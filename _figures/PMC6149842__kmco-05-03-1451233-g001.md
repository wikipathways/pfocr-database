caption: The “MTR safeguard mechanism” protects genomic integrity in response to stress-induced
  outbursts of transcription during S phase. Cells induce a conserved transcriptional
  signature known as the ESR upon environmental stresses such as osmo (NaCl), heat
  (37ºC), oxidative (H2O2) or low glucose as well as to mutations that reduce cell
  fitness. (A) Mrc1 is phosphorylated at the N-terminus by multiple signaling kinases
  (e.g. Hog1, Mpk1, Psk1 or Snf1), which delays replication to maintain genomic integrity
  upon stress. (B) The unphosphorylatable mutant of Mrc1 (mrc13A) fails to delay replication
  and accumulates TAR and genomic instability due to collisions between RNA and DNA
  polymerases. The role of Mrc1 in the MTR is fully independent of the DNA damage
  checkpoint pathway.
