caption: Stress-induced amino acid-sensitive pathway, GCN2 signaling is activated
  in CTI conditions at the very early stages, thus inducing Treg functions not necessary
  at that stage of wound healing, thus inhibiting/disrupting the natural course of
  the acute pro-inflammatory phase. Increased expression of Tregs at early stages
  delays wound healing through the GCN2 pathway.
