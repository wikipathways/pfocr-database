caption: Interleukin 1 (IL-1) binding to the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) and co-receptor
  (IL-1RAc) and formation of the signaling module containing MyD88, IRAK (IL-1 receptor
  associated kinase) and TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor). The Map kinase signaling
  module is activated, upstream of the Map kinase kinases (MKKs) and Stress Activated
  Protein kinases (SAPKs) JNK and p38. We have previously shown MyD88 and TRAF-6 mRNA
  is up regulated in the immature enterocyte [] Constitutive and IL-1β induced JNK
  and p38 phosphorylation, together with high expression levels of their target transcription
  factors, cJun and cFos results in increased IL-6 gene transcription in the immature
  enterocyte. Expression of JunD later in enterocyte development facilitates formation
  of the less potent JunD/cJun or JunD/cFos dimers which replace the activating cJun/cJun
  or cJun/cFos dimers resulting in lower IL-6 gene transcription. A JNK independent
  pathway involving JunB in the colon represses IL-6 gene transcription.
