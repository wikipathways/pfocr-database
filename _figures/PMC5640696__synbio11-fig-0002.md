caption: Design, analysis and application of synthetic microbial consortia composed
  of two species. (1) Electron transfer between G. metallireducens and M. harundinacea.
  (2) Metabolites exchange between B. megaterium and K. vulgare. (3) Distribute oxygenated
  taxanes metabolic pathway into E. coli and S. cerevisiae consortium. (4) Bacterial
  cell therapy systems in the future.
