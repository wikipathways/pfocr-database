caption: 'The membrane receptor tyrosine kinases-linked anti-BC effects of flavonoids
  as modulators of the MAPK signaling pathway, highlighting their capacity to function
  as sensitizers in chemoresistant BC and/or as chemopreventive agents. The MAPK cascade
  consists of three hierarchical levels: MAPK kinase-kinase (MAPKKK), MAPK kinase
  (MAPKK), and MAPK. This signaling axis integrates extracellular stimuli, primarily
  via Gprotein-coupled receptors, to elicit diverse cellular responses. Within the
  canonical MAPK/ERK pathway, MAPKKKs comprise A-RAF, B-RAF, and RAF-1 (C-RAF) kinases,
  which activate the MAPKKs, MEK1, and MEK2. These, in turn, phosphorylate and activate
  the terminal effectors, ERK1 and ERK2, thereby propagating downstream signaling.
  Additionally, membrane-associated molecular interactions involve the modulation
  of small GTPases such as Rac, CDC42, and Rho, which serve as upstream regulators
  of the MAPK-JNK and MAPK-p38 signaling branches, further contributing to the pathway''s
  complexity'
