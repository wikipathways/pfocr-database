caption: 'An overview of auxin, SL, and CK transport within the plant (left) and hormone
  interactions during the regulation of shoot and root development (right). Auxin,
  strigolactone (SL), and cytokinin (CK) transport are represented by black, red,
  and blue dotted line, respectively. For hormone interactions (right), arrows represent
  promotion, while flat-ended lines indicate inhibition. (A) Auxin, produced in the
  shoot apical meristem (SAM) and young leaves, is transported basipetally through
  the stem in the polar auxin transport (PAT) stream toward the root apical meristem
  (RAM). Here, but probably also throughout the entire vasculature of the plant, it
  positively regulates SL biosynthesis (Hayward et al., ). As shown by GR24 feeding
  experiments, SLs transported through the xylem from the root to the shoot down-regulate
  the free auxin level in young leafs in a MAX2-dependent manner hereby controlling
  their development (Ruyter-Spira et al., ). SLs in the vasculature negatively affect
  PAT capacity (Crawford et al., ), as observed for NPA (Ljung et al., ), which negatively
  feeds back on auxin levels at the sites of biosynthesis. This long distance SL-auxin
  feedback mechanism, affects plant developmental processes as described below. (B)
  During the regulation of bud outgrowth, SLs reduce the capacity of the PAT stream
  in the main stem, leading to enhanced competition between buds to release their
  auxin into the stem (Crawford et al., ; Shinohara et al., ). On the other hand,
  SLs and CK are transported acropetally through the xylem and act directly in the
  buds to control their outgrowth through the joint regulation of TCP transcription
  factor BRC1 (Braun et al., ; Dun et al., ). (C) SLs have a direct positive effect
  on secondary growth by activating cell division in the vascular cambium in which
  they act downstream of auxin. The fact that the max1 mutant still displays some
  residual cambium activity might point to a SL independent response to auxin. However,
  this remaining activity could also be due to residual SLs in these mutants (Agusti
  et al., ). (D) Hormone interactions during primary root (PR) elongation, lateral
  root (LR) initiation and development (1) and root hair (RH) elongation (2). (1)
  Auxin imported from the main PAT stream into the root stimulates SL production.
  SL export into the xylem and down regulation of the PAT stream feedback on auxin
  levels in the shoot as described under (A). SL biosynthesis genes are specifically
  expressed in vascular tissue and the cortex of the proximal meristem of the root,
  through which the lateral auxin reflux toward the main PAT stream takes place. Therefore
  it is likely that locally synthesized SLs are controlling the efficiency of this
  reflux. Primary root elongation and lateral root initiation are determined by the
  auxin gradient inside the root tip, which is determined by auxin levels imported
  through the PAT stream, auxin synthesized in the root tip, and local auxin transport,
  including the auxin lateral reflux. Lateral root development and emergence are controlled
  by auxin derived from the shoot for which the SL controlled PAT stream capacity
  and lateral auxin influx into the developing lateral root primordia (LRP) are the
  main determinants. Although in the flow diagram auxin is depicted as a positive
  regulator of root growth, auxin displays a dose-response curve with an optimum,
  such that supra-optimal auxin concentrations will have a negative effect (Ruyter-Spira
  et al., ). (2) The effect of SLs on RH elongation is dependent on both auxin and
  ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and signaling. It has been suggested that SLs negatively
  regulate auxin efflux (Koltai et al., ). If this would specifically occur in RH
  cells this would result in increased local auxin levels which stimulates RH elongation.
  This local action of SLs has not been proven yet. Alternatively, it may be that
  SLs affect auxin transport in the PAT stream and/or the root tip hereby indirectly
  affecting the auxin concentration in RH cells. ET acts downstream of SLs and has
  a direct effect on RH elongation but also interacts with the auxin pathway (Kapulnik
  et al., ). Abbreviations: P, primordium; DM, distal meristem; PM, proximal meristem;
