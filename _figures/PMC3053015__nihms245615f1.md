caption: (a) PtdIns 4-kinases and phosphatases of yeast and mammalian Golgi. In yeast,
  one PI4K, Pik1, localizes to trans cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. Membrane association
  of Pik1 requires a myristoylated protein, Frq1, which is constitutively bound to
  Pik1. There are two mammalian Golgi PI4Ks, PI4KIIα and PI4KIIIβ, and their distribution
  between Golgi cisternae has not yet been firmly established. Membrane association
  of PI4KIIα requires palmitoylation, but the basis of specific Golgi targeting is
  unknown. Targeting of PI4KIIIβ is mediated by binding to two myristoylated proteins,
  NCS1 (a Frq1 ortholog) and Arf1, which are reported to also associate with each
  other. Early Golgi cisternae are thought to be depleted of PtdIns4P, relative to
  late cisternae, by the Sac1 phosphoinositide phosphatase which traffics between
  the ER and early Golgi compartments. (b) Protein kinase D regulation of PI4KIIIβ
  and Golgi lipid homeostasis. Protein kinase D (PKD) is a master regulator of sphingolipid
  and sterol homeostasis through phosphorylation–dependent modulation of PI4KIIIβ,
  CERT, and OSBP1 activities. PKD is recruited to the Golgi by binding to diacylglycerol
  (DAG), which is produced during sphingomyelin synthesis and via other pathways (see
  text). PKD-mediated phosphorylation activates PI4KIIIβ, resulting in increased production
  of PtdIns4P on Golgi membranes, which should enhance recruitment of the PtdIns4P-binding
  proteins, CERT and OSBP1. CERT delivers ceramide to the Golgi from its site of synthesis
  in the endoplasmic reticulum to support sphingomyelin synthesis and OSBP1 is linked
  to sterol metabolism. Although DAG produced during SM synthesis favors recruitment
  of PKD and activation of PI4KIIIβ, phosphorylation of CERT and OSBP1 by PKD reduce
  their Golgi localization and inhibits SM synthesis. This regulatory loop balances
  flux through the SM synthetic pathway.

  description: (a) PtdIns 4-kinases and phosphatases of yeast and mammalian Golgi.
    In yeast, one PI4K, Pik1, localizes to trans cisternae of the Golgi apparatus.
    Membrane association of Pik1 requires a myristoylated protein, Frq1, which is
    constitutively bound to Pik1. There are two mammalian Golgi PI4Ks, PI4KIIα and
    PI4KIIIβ, and their distribution between Golgi cisternae has not yet been firmly

    are reported to also associate with each other. Early Golgi cisternae are thought
    to be depleted of PtdIns4P, relative to late cisternae, by the Sac1 phosphoinositide
    phosphatase which traffics between the ER and early Golgi compartments. (b) Protein
    kinase D regulation of PI4KIIIβ and Golgi lipid homeostasis. Protein kinase D
    (PKD) is a master regulator of sphingolipid and sterol homeostasis through phosphorylation–dependent
    modulation of PI4KIIIβ, CERT, and OSBP1 activities. PKD is recruited to the Golgi
