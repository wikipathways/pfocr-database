caption: The eNOS/NO signaling pathway in exercise-induced vascular adaptations and
  exercise-induced cardioprotection. Exercise can activate the eNOS/NO signaling pathway
  through either calcium-dependent or -independent ways. Exercise-induced shear stress
  leads to an increase of intracellular Ca2+ within endothelial cells, which then
  interacts with calmodulin and activates eNOS and NO generation. Exercise can also
  activate the PI3K/AKT, AMPK, and PKA signaling pathways and subsequently increase
  eNOS phosphorylation and NO generation. The NO promotes angiogenesis or diffuses
  into adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells or cardiac muscle cells to induce cGMP-dependent
  relaxation. In cardiac muscle cells, exercise promotes the association of eNOS to
  the mitochondrial membrane, leading to increased NO bioavailability and S-nitrosylation
  of proteins involved in mitochondrial respiratory function, electron transport,
  and mPTP opening. The NO can further inhibit ROS and Ca2+ interaction in the mitochondria
  and then protect cardiomyocytes from cell death. Meanwhile, the eNOS located in
  the caveolae within cardiac myocytes can also be activated by exercise-associated
  myocardial stress to facilitate the opening of sarcoplasmic reticulum RyR2. eNOS
