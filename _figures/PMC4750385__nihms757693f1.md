caption: 'Schematic representation of cytokine-mediated cascade associated with chemotherapy-induced
  cognitive dysfunction. Peripheral released cytokines can access the brain to initiate
  local release of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-α) and chemokines (MCP-1)
  by following mechanisms: (1) passive crossing through the leaky regions in the blood–brain-barrier
  at circumventricular organs; (2) active transporting cross the blood–brain-barrier;
  (3) stimulating the HPA axis independently or synergistically by directly binding
  to the receptors expressed in the HPA axis or indirectly through affecting the secretion
  of ACTH from the hypothalamus, ACTH from the pituitary or glucocorticoids from the
  adrenal cortex; and (4) stimulation of endothelial cells and perivascular macrophages,
  monocytes and T cells in the brain to produce similar local cytokines/chemokines.
  To respond to the local released cytokines/chemokines, microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes
  and neurons in the brain produce even more the similar types of cytokines/chemokines
  which in turn to influence neuronal neurotransmitters and integrity through (1)
  oxidative stress pathways to increase ROS and RNS (reactive oxygen and nitrogen
  species), which affect the synthesis of monoamines; (2) P38 MAPKs pathway to interfere
  with serotonin and dopamine transports (5-HTT/DAT) function; (3) affecting glutamate
  system by activation of IDO – QUIN – NMDAR/EAAT to lead to neuronal excitotoxicity;
  and finally (4) BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) and TrkB pathway to negatively
  affect neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. All the pathways either working alone or
  synergistically contribute to the development of cognitive decline after chemotherapy
  exposure in cancer patients.'
