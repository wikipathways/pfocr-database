caption: Potential mechanisms signaling pathways for the actions of irisin in musculoskeletal.
  During exercise, the elevated Ca2+ in muscle cytoplasm-induced activation of the
  AMPK–PGC-1α–FNDC5 axis is the main pathway for irisin synthesis. In addition, irisin,
  in turn, can stimulate muscle growth and myoblast differentiation via ERK1/2–IGF-1/MSTN
  and IL-6 signaling pathways, respectively. Multiple pathways mediated exercise-induced
  irisin and r-irisin–activated osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, e.g.,
  p38/ERK1/2, Akt-β-catenin, and Wnt-β-catenin–mediated activation of ALP/OCN/Col
  I pathways. In osteoclast, irisin induced its proliferation through activating the
  p38/JNK pathway. In addition, irisin also inhibited the NF-κB and NFATc1 levels
  in the nucleus, thus inhibiting the expression of osteoclast differentiation marker
  genes. As for osteocytes, irisin inhibited osteocyte apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-9
  and caspase-3 expression, which probably through activating p38/ERK1/2. Furthermore,
  moderate exercise-activated irisin or r-irisin could alleviate OA by maintaining
  ECM stabilization and reducing inflammatory response through p38/JNK-Akt and PI3K/Akt/NF-κB
  signaling pathway, respectively.
