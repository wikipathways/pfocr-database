caption: Schematic diagram showing the role of NDRG1 in inhibiting the EMT via regulation
  of the TGF-β/SMAD and Wnt pathways. Iron chelators up-regulate NDRG1 expression
  and increased NDRG1 inhibits the canonical TGF-β/SMAD pathway through decreasing
  expression of SMAD2 and pSMAD3. This decreases TGF-β-induced Slug expression which
  is responsible for E-cadherin repression. Notably, NDRG1 knock-down results in loss
  of membrane E-cadherin and β-catenin and their translocation into nuclei, thus activating
  the Wnt pathway and the transcription of cyclin D1 that plays an important role
  in cell cycle progression and proliferation. Taken together, NDRG1 plays a novel
  role in regulating the EMT through regulation of the TGF-β and Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathways.
