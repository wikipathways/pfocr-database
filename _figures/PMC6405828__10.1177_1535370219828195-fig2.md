caption: Schematic representation of TYRO3 signaling pathway. TYRO3 has been reported
  to mediate numerous cellular activities, including platelet aggregation, cell growth,
  invasion, cell proliferation, migration, immunosupression, cell transformation,
  and anti-apoptosis. Molecules in orange have been shown to associate with TYROS
  through either a direct or indirect interaction. (A color version of this figure
  is available in the online journal.)
