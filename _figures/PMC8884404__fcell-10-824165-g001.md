caption: 'The canonical pathway and non-canonical pathway of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis
  is a novel pro-inflammatory regulator of cell death. Depending on the key molecular
  patterns involved in the activation and execution steps, they can be divided into
  the canonical pathway and non-canonical pathway. In the caspase1-dependent pyroptosis
  pathway, cells can activate inflammatory vesicles to trigger pyroptosis in response
  to multiple factors, activating the respective inflammatory vesicles (including
  NLRP3, AIM2 or pyrin) through the action of PAMPs and DAMPs; NLRP3 recruits ASC
  and pro-caspase-1 through various pathways, causing activation of caspase-1 and
  maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18.
  GSDMD-N is formed by the cleavage of inflammatory cystathione, triggering the rupture
  of cell membranes and promoting the release of inflammatory factors, cell swelling
  and pytoptosis. In the non-canonical pathway, the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall
  fraction LPS activates caspase 4/5/11, which mediates pyroptosis by directly triggering
  pyroptosis through the cleavage of GSDMD. NLRP3: NOD-like receptor protein 3; AIM2:
  in melanoma 2; PAMPs: pathogen-associated molecular patterns; DAMPs: danger-associated
  molecular patterns; GSDMD: gasdermin D; LPS: lipopolysaccharide.'
