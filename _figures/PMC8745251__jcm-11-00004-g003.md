caption: 'Lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. This figure gives a simplified impression
  of the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins, which can be characterized by
  exogenous and endogenous pathways. Exogenous pathway: Dietary cholesterol and fatty
  acids (FA) are, with the help of bile acids, made available for uptake by epithelial
  cells of the small intestine. Here, these lipids are packaged in chylomicrons (CM),
  which are subsequently secreted into the lymph from where they reach the blood circulation
  via the thoracic duct. In the vasculature of peripheral tissues such as the heart,
  skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) catalyzes the lipolysis
  of triglycerides in CM, which allows for the uptake of FA by parenchymal cells.
  The resulting smaller so-called CM remnant particles are subsequently taken up by
  lipoprotein receptors such as LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor). Endogenous
  pathway: Dependent on the metabolic conditions, the liver can synthesize very-low-density
  lipoproteins (VLDL) to maintain overall lipid and energy homeostasis. After secretion
  into the systemic blood circulation, VLDL undergo the same metabolization as described
  for CM, which, in this case, renders smaller intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL)
  and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) that are primarily taken up by the liver.'
