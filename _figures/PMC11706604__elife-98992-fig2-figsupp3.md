caption: (A) Euler-Venn diagrams illustrating DEGs in SAP54 plants exposed to female
  or male or no leafhoppers compared to no insect exposed (empty cage-only) GFP plants.
  (B) Mapman diagram of DEGs involved in biotic stress in the cage-only SAP54 vs cage-only
  GFP plants. Pathways are indicated and each square is a gene with red versus green
  shades illustrating the level of up- or downregulation

  vectors by targeting plant MADS-box factor SVP
