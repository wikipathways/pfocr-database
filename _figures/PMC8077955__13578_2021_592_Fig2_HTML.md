caption: The molecular mechanism of microglial activation by galectin-3 (Gal-3). a
  Gal-3 activates microglia via IFN-γ and further induces the production of proinflammatory
  cytokines via the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) pathway. b Gal-3 binds to microglial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), triggering
  a proinflammatory response under acute neuroinflammatory conditions. c Gal-3 prevents
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from interacting with TLR4 by preferentially binding to
  LPS, which inhibits downstream proinflammatory cytokine production. d Gal-3/insulin-like
  growth factor 1 receptor (IGFR-1) interaction activates the IGF-mediated JAK/STAT
  pathway and microglial proliferation. e After secretion of sialidase to eliminate
  sialic acid from cell surface glycoproteins, Gal-3 binds the phagocytic receptor
  Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) and then contributes to phagocytosis by microglia. f
  Gal-3 interacts with advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) to degrade its toxicity
  by fusing lysosomes
