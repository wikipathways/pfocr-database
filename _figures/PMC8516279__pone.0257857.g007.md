caption: The upper illustration represents the potential signaling pathways of Ox-LDL/CD36
  that promote T2DM and dyslipidemia. The oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL)
  initiates the activation of CD36 which bounds to membrane-associated Src family
  non-receptor tyrosine kinases. This interaction enables three main cytoplasmic signaling
  domains; nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
  kinase 2 (MEKK2), and Vav-mediated signaling pathways. Activation of NF-κB contributes
  to inducing the levels of thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), which in turn
  activates the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and promotes the production
  of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF and IL-1). Also, by inducing microRNA (miR-204)
  expression which targets the insulin transcription factor (MafA), TXNIP contributes
  to inhibiting insulin production, and thus pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Activation
  of Vav-mediated signaling pathways results in complicated cellular mechanisms finished
  with increased in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), due to promoting
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activation, free fatty
  acid (FFA) uptake, and Ox-LDL uptake. Furthermore, through the c-Jun N-terminal
  protein kinase (JNK1/2) pathway, MEKK2 also promotes Ox-LDL uptake. Thereafter,
  the excessive generation of ROS causes oxidative damage, and thus results in pancreatic
  beta-cell dysfunction and evolution of dyslipidemia. The exacerbation of beta-cell
  dysfunction is involved in the progression of T2DM [–]. In the middle illustration,
  the edges indicate both functional and physical protein associations. Setting included
  minimum interaction score of 0.15. Max number of interactions is 10 in the first
  shell and 10 in the second shell. In the lower illustration, the edges indicate
  that the proteins are part of a physical complex. Setting included minimum interaction
  score of 0.4. Max number of interactions is 20 in the first shell, and none in the
  second shell. Line thickness indicates the strength of data support. Both the middle
  and lower illustrations were created using STRING database.
