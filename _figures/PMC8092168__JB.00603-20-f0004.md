caption: 'Effect of upregulation of NTD/kanosamine biosynthetic pathway on central
  carbon metabolism. The B. subtilis 168 (wild type), TI443 (zwf), TI444 (zwf glcP),
  and TI445 (zwf ntdABC glcP) strains were grown in LB medium for 16 h at 37°C. One
  milliliter of the overnight culture was inoculated in 50 ml of S7N medium and cultivated
  until the OD650 reached 0.2, and the cells were collected by filtration. The metabolites
  in each cell were analyzed using CE-TOF MS. The y axis indicates the amount of metabolites
  (picomoles per OD650 unit per milliliter of culture). 3PG/2PG and kanosamine/mannosamine/glucosamine
  were not differentiated by the CE-TOF MS method used. The average values from three
  independent experiments are shown. The error bars represent the standard deviations.
