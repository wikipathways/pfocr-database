caption: 'Opsonized epithelial apoptotic particles and ICs containing nuclear autoantigens
  bind to plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and RF B cells via TLRs and Fc receptors, respectively.
  TLR activation in pDCs leads to IFNa release that subsequently stimulates myeloid
  DCs (mDCs) to produce BAFF. The same apoptotic particles and ICs also bind to RF
  B cells via TLR and BCR, respectively. TLR activation in B cells results in enhanced
  BCR mediated signaling and upregulation of BAFF-R. BAFF, secreted by mDCs, further
  upregulates TLR expression, favors B cell survival, promotes immunoglobulin class-
  switching and plasma cell differentiation (MZ B cell maturation pathway). The activated
  mDCs also act as antigen presenting cells to T cells that help B cell responses
  (GC B cell maturation pathway). (pDC: plasmacytoid dendritic cell, mDC: myeloid
  dendritic cell, GC: germinal center, MZ: marginal zone, BAFF: B cell activating
  factor, TLR: Toll like receptor, BAFFR: BAFF receptor, BCR: B cell receptor, IFNa:
  interferon a).'
