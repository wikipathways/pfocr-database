caption: 'Figure 3 displays the mRNAs from the JAK-STAT pathway that encode for receptor,
  cytokine or hormone molecules, as there were too many genes in these categories
  to include in the overall pathway figure. Note that mRNAs that had a 0.67< FC <
  1.50 were included in this figure, to show where they fit in the pathway, even though
  they were not tested for miRNA associations. FC of the miRNA or mRNA is represented
  in the color of the molecule: green molecules have less expression in carcinoma
  tissue compared to normal mucosa and red molecules have higher; paler molecules
  have a less extreme FC. Also included in this figure are the miRNAs associated with
  these genes; only miRNAs with a seed region match were included, and these interactions
  were displayed with a stop (--|).'
