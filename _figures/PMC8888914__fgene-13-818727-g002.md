caption: Roles of DNA-methylation in environmental stress responses and memories in
  plants. Changes in DNA-methylation landscape are part of the response of plants
  to environmental stresses. De novo methylation, which is targeted at specific loci
  by small-RNAs, is established by the RNA-dependent-DNA-Methylation pathway (RdDM)
  whereas, DNA demethylation at specific loci requires functional DNA Glycosylase
  Lyase also called DNA demethylase such as Repressor of Silencing 1 (ROS1). Modification
  of DNA methylation patterns at genes may result in changes in gene expression level
  leading to gene induction or repression. In addition, stress induced DNA methylation
  variations may occur at transposable elements (TEs) and determine their inactive
  or active state. When hypomethylated and transcriptionally active, TEs may indirectly
  influence the expression of genes located in their vicinity, whereas their hypermethylation
  has the reverse effect. Additionally, the mobility of TEs may generate new regulatory
  patterns or mutations leading to loss of gene function when their insertion occurs
  in genes. Maintenance of stress induced patterns of DNA methylation through cell
  division (Mitosis or meiosis), results in an epigenetic memory. This memory requires
  the context-specific DNA-methyltransferases METHYLTRANSFERASE-1 (MET1), CHROMOMETHYLASE-3
  (CMT3) for CG and CHG sequence context, respectively. Methylation in the CHH sequence
  context is maintained by CMT2 or by the RdDM pathway in heterochromatic and euchromatic
  regions, respectively.
