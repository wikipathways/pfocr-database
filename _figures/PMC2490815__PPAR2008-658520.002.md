caption: Regulation of neuroinflammation by PPAR agonists in CNS diseases. CD40/TLR
  induce the activation of NF-κB pathway leading to expression of IL-12 family cytokines
  from APCs which in turn signal through Jak-Stat pathway in T cells leading to Th1/Th17
  differentiation and development of CNS diseases. PPAR agonists modulate signaling
  and transcription in APC and T cells thereby preventing CNS diseases.
