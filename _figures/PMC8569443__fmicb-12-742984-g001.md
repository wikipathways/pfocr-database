caption: Host lncRNAs regulate various steps of antiviral immune responses against
  IAV infection. Upon IAV invading host cells, the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
  signaling pathway is initiated to activate transcription factors, including NF-κB
  and IRF3/7. Then, the transcription factors bind to the corresponding active sites
  to induce the transcription of IFNs, which activates auto- or paracrine pathways
  to initiate ISGs to defend viral infection through JAK-STAT pathways. Many lncRNAs
  are involved in the cascades to regulate different steps of the signaling pathway
  to inhibit or promote IAV replication.
