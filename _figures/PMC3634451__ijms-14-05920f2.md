caption: Schematic model of the FGF signalling cascade in Drosophila melanogaster.
  FGFs bind to their FGFRs and this interaction is stabilized by heparan sulfate proteoglycans
  (HSPG). Activation of the FGFR leads to auto- and trans-phosphorylation of their
  tyrosine kinase domains and to phosphorylation of its adaptor protein Dof. Dof protein
  is O-GlcNAcylated (O-GlcNAc) and possesses multiple clusters of tyrosine residues
  directing the signal towards various cascades, three of which—the Csw/Shp2, Grb2/Drk
  and Src64B pathways—have been proposed to contribute to MAPK activation. This route
  of FGF signalling is responsible for inducing gene transcription, and executing
  proliferative and anti-apoptotic responses. Dof also contains a putative binding
  site for PI3K that could locally modify the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) composition
  of the plasma membrane and thus recruit downstream signalling components for example
  the RhoGEF Pbl. Pbl acts on the Rac pathway to promote the formation of actin rich
  protrusions in the mesoderm. Actin polymerisation is required for protrusion formation
  in a Rac-, Cdc42- and FGF-dependent fashion. Putative interactions are indicated
  as grey arrows and the putative component of the Drosophila FGF pathway, PI3K, is
  represented as a circle with no border.
