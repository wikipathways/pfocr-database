caption: The immature Notch receptor is processed in the Golgi network where a furin-like
  protease cleaves it to create the mature Notch receptor, comprising the large extracellular
  domain linked to the smaller transmembrane domain and intracellular domain (NICD).
  Notch-specific ligands Jagged-1/2 or Delta-like ligand-1/3/4 bind the extracellular
  domain and activate the sequential cleavage of the Notch protein by a member of
  the disintegrin and metalloprotease family (ADAM 10/17) and γ-secretase, releasing
  the NICD which then translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus NICD forms a transcription
  complex with the recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J
  region (RBP-J) transcription factors, the mastermind-like (MAML) proteins and other
  coactivators to stimulate expression of Notch target genes including the Hairy Enhancer
  of Split (HES) and HES-related proteins (HEY).
