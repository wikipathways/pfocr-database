caption: Overview of apoptosis and autophagy research on tick-borne obligate intracellular
  pathogens. (A) Manipulation of apoptosis. In the vertebrate host (left) the C-terminal
  fragment of the Anaplasma phagocytophilum effector Ats-1 localizes to the host mitochondria
  where it inhibits apoptosis. A large number of kinases and pro-/anti-apoptotic factors
  (shown in pale blue box) also show changes in expression during A. phagocytophilum
  infection. Rickettsia rickettsii infection leads to NF-κB activation, inhibiting
  cytochrome c release from mitochondria resulting in downstream inhibition of apoptosis.
  In the tick vector (right), A. phagocytophilum uses multiple pathways to inhibit
  apoptosis, including activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, down-regulation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MKK) and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), decreasing
  FAS expression, and reducing porin expression to inhibit cytochrome c release from
  the mitochondria. Rickettsia rickettsii prevents caspase 3 activation in order to
  inhibit apoptosis. Rickettsia parkeri infection is associated with increased mitochondrial
  cytochrome c release, leading to increased activation of apoptosis, which is essential
  to its infection of tick cells. (B) Manipulation of autophagy. Experimental evidence
  only exists from mammalian systems. The N-terminal portion of the A. phagocytophilum
  effector Ats-1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it interacts with
  Beclin1 to initiate autophagosome formation. Autophagosomes are prevented from trafficking
  to the lysosome and instead fuse with the bacterial vacuole to deliver membrane
  and nutrients to A. phagocytophilum. The Etf-1 effector secreted by Erhlichia chaffeensis
  interacts with Beclin1, Rab5 and the PI3K complex to induce autophagosome formation.
  The autophagosomes fuse with the Erhlichia-containing vacuole and are prevented
  from fusing with the lysosome by bacterial interference with the Wnt signalling
  pathway. During R. parkeri infection of macrophages, ompB shields the rickettsial
  surface protein ompA from polyubiquitination, preventing its recognition by the
  autophagy adaptors p62 and NDP52. (C) Challenges and future directions in the research
  of interactions of intracellular tick-borne pathogens with apoptosis and autophagy
  pathways.
