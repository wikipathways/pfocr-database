caption: In this regard, the E-ethylidene ketone 10 had been synthesized in enantiospecific
  fashion in five steps from D-(+)-tryptophan methyl ester 14 () via the asymmetric
  Pictect-Spengler reaction, Dieckmann cyclization, and palladium mediated cross coupling
  previously.– In addition, two other palladium-mediated enolate driven cross-coupling
  processes have been employed to provide ketone 10, as well as a copper-mediated
  method to generate related ketones (See below). This synthetic strategy was an efficient
  way to provide pentacyclic ketone 10 on gram scale. With the advantage of this method,
  attention turned to the synthesis of the Na-H axial aldehyde at C-16 in order to
  construct the two desired aldehydes 6 and 7 in an enantiospecific fashion.
