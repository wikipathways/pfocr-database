caption: A simplified schematic representation of the synthesis and metabolism of
  vitamin D.7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin is converted to previtamin D3 by UV-B
  and then is thermally isomerized to vitamin D3. Transport of vitamin D3 from the
  skin to the liver is mediated by vitamin D binding protein (DBP) where vitamin D3
  is hydroxylated at position 25 to 25(OH)D3, DBP then transports 25(OH)D3 to the
  kidney. 25(OH)D3/DBP is filtered by the glomeruli and 25(OH)D3 is taken up into
  the tubular cells, following DBP binding to megalin, a transmembrane protein. 25(OH)D3
  undergoes a second hydroxylation step by the 1-alpha-hydroxylase Cyp27B1, converting
  to the active 1α,25 (OH)2D3, while 24 hydroxylase Cyp27A1 converts to 24,25(OH)2D3.
  Keratinocytes contribute to the 3-epimerase activity, but the exact sites of activity
  remain unknown. 3epi25(OH)D3 is converted by Cyp27A1 to 24,25(OH)D3 and Cyp27B1
  to 1,25(OH)D3, in equal measure. Ergosterol (provitamin D2) is plant-based and is
  converted to ergocalciferol by UV-B light that then follows the same pathway as
  vitamin D3 that is depicted with the dotted line * to the liver to form 25(OH)D2
  and then transported to the kidney and epimerized to the D2 metabolites.
