caption: Cargo recognition and packaging in selective macroautophagy. Different types
  of selective autophagy are illustrated. The yeast cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting
  (Cvt) pathway is a biosynthetic process that delivers certain resident hydrolases
  to the vacuole. The propeptide of precursor aminopeptidase I (prApe1) is the key
  ligand that binds the Atg19 receptor. The latter interacts with the scaffold Atg11,
  and also contains an AIM motif for binding Atg8, connecting the cargo with the phagophore.
  A similar process occurs during mitophagy and pexophagy, where Atg32 and Atg36 act
  as receptors that bind both Atg11 and Atg8. During xenophagy in mammalian cells
  invasive bacteria may first be recognized by LGALS8 and subsequently by ubiquitin,
  which act as ligands. Receptors, including CALCOCO2/NDP52, SQSTM1 and OPTN bind
  the ligands and one or more of the Atg8 orthologs. Ams1, α-mannosidase; GBRP, GABARAP;
  PAS, phagophore assembly site.
