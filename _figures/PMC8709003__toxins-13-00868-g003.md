caption: Schematic representation of signaling pathways stimulated by Asp49 and Lys49
  PLA2s from B. asper snake venom to produce prostaglandins in macrophages. Asp49
  PLA2 induces AA and fatty acids release from macrophage membrane. Free fatty acids
  can act as DAMPs and activate TLR2 or other TLRs (still unknown), via activation
  of adapter protein MyD88, leading to COX-2 protein expression and release of PGs,
  Asp49PLA2 upregulates the 12-LO pathway, culminating the release of 12-HETE. 12-HETE,
  in turn, activates the ERK1/2 pathway, leading to COX-2 protein expression and PG
  release, independent on NF-κB translocation. Asp49PLA2 also activates the signaling
  protein PI3K leading to COX-2 expression and production of PGs independent on NF-κB
  activation. Asp49 PLA2 also activates PKC and p38 MAPK pathways promoting COX-2
  expression and production of PGs via NF-κB activation. In addition, Asp49PLA2 provides
  AA for activation of COX-1 activity which is followed by production of proinflammatory
  PGs. Asp49 and Lys49 PLA2s both produce PGs by pathways independent on iPLA2. Although
  both sPLA2 from bothropic venom produce PGs via crosstalk with cPLA2, only Lys49PLA2
  induces COX-2 expression dependent on this cytosolic PLA2. Lys49PLA2 activates signaling
  pathways mediated by p38 MAPK, PTK, PKC, and ERK1/2. All these kinase pathways,
  except for p38 MAPK, are involved in NF-κB activation and COX-2 protein expression
  and PG production. Full arrows indicate actions already studied and demonstrated.
  Dotted arrows indicate hypothesized or unknown effects.
