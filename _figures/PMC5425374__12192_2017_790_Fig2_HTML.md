caption: 'The role of Hsp70 in signal transduction pathways. a Role of Hsp70 in signal
  transduction pathways of NF-κB. Intracellular HSP70 may also involve in preserving
  I-κB complex by interacting with IKK (Uchinami et al. ). HSP70 forms a complex with
  IκBα, attenuating NF-κB activity. HSP70 might bind IκBα to prevent its phosphorylation
  by IκB kinase, or HSP70 might inhibit IκB kinase directly, thereby inhibiting the
  degradation of I-κB and the subsequent activation of the NF-κB pathway (Shimizu
  et al. ). NF-κB activation induced by various stimuli is mediated by members of
  the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) adapter family (le Luong et al. ). Intracellular
  HSP70 was demonstrated to inhibit NF-κB activation by binding TRAF6 via the TRAF-C
  domain and preventing its ubiquitination, thus resulting in inhibition of inflammatory
  mediator production (Cao et al. ). b Role of Hsp70 in signal transduction pathways
  of TGF signaling. HSP70 inhibits TGF-β signal by Smad-dependent and Smad-independent
  pathways. Upon TGFβ stimulation, Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by the activated
  TGFβ type I receptor kinase, forming a stable complex with Smad 4 in cytoplasm and
  then accumulating in the nucleus to regulate transcription of target genes. Moreover,
  in renal cells, TGF-beta direct or via TRAF6 stimulates rapid phosphorylation of
  the TGF-beta-activated kinase (TAK)1 and TAK1-binding protein, in turn activating
  MKK, which appears to function upstream of JNK and p38 (Schnaper et al.  ). In contrast,
  Smad7 inhibits the TGFβ receptor type I-dependent Smad2/3 activation. Intracellular
  HSP70 interrupting Smad2/3 protein phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation
  and accumulation increases Smad7 protein expression, binds TRAF6, and reduces the
  phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK, providing a protective effect (Zhou et al.
  ). c Role of Hsp70 in stress kinases (MAPK) signal transduction. The relative extent
  of MAPK activities, including JNK, p38, and ERK, has been proposed to determine
  cell fate after injury. Hsp70 downregulates also the activation of stress kinases
  (JNK and p38), and suppresses activation of caspases in renal cells (Suzuki et al.
  ) The activity of the MEK/ERK pathway that is upregulated by HSP70 may be relevant
  to renal protection. HSP70 provides most of the protective effects by activation
  of Raf, MEK, and ERK phosphorylation and cell survival (Wang et al. , Park et al.
  ). Abbreviations: TGF-β transforming growth factor beta, MAPK mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, JNK c-Jun N-terminal kinase, ERK extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases, MEK MKK–mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MKKK mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase, Raf a family of serine/threonine-specific protein
  kinases'
