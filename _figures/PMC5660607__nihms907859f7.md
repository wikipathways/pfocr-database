caption: Schematic of crosstalk of KDG molecular and network pathways. The icons represent
  multiscale datastreams from populations of patients with IBD, including DNA, RNA,
  and protein collected from blood and intestine of patients across different disease
  stages. KDG network nodes (diamonds) regulate other network nodes in subnetworks
  defined by the orange edges, depicting causal regulatory relationships among the
  network nodes. For example, the NF-κB pathway, RAC, and its actin cytoskeleton rearrangement,
  RAS, the NLRP3 inflammasome pathways, and TLR and chemokine receptors are modulated
  by the KDGs we identified, and all have been reported as associated with IBD.
