caption: Upon CDK4/6 inhibition, FGFR1 amplification can drive ERK signaling pathway
  activation, increasing CDK6, D-type cyclins and cyclin E expression. In addition,
  the activity of the MAPK signaling pathway or the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is activated
  or enhanced. The NF-κB pathway can upregulate HGF, which in turn activates the c-Met
  and TrkA-B pathways. Simultaneously, androgen receptor expression is increased to
  promote cell cycle progression in palbociclib-resistant breast cancer cells. In
  CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant ER+ breast cancer, loss of FAT1 can suppress the Hippo
  pathway to induce YAP/TAZ nuclear localization, increasing CDK6 expression. Upon
  inhibition of CDK4/6, MYC overexpression can reprogram tumor metabolism and activate
  the mTOR pathway. Loss of Foxb4 can increase the accumulation of cyclin D1 in the
  nucleus, which induces glutamine addiction and promotes tumor progression. In palbociclib-resistant
  breast cancer cells, the IL-6/STAT3 pathway is activated and promotes SPOP degradation,
  thereby increasing PD-L1 levels and enhancing the levels of double-stranded RNA,
  stimulating the production of type III interferon.
