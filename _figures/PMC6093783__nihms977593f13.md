caption: Asparagine and aspartate hydroxylation reactions mediated by αKG-NHFe enzymes.
  (A) L-Asn 136 hydroxylation is catalyzed by AsnO, to generate the building block
  137 for CDA 138 biosynthesis. (B) Biosynthetic pathway of ectoine 144. The hydroxylation
  of ectoine 144 to hydroxylectoine 145 is mediated by an αKG-dependent EctD.
