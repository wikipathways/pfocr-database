caption: Two major pathways to apoptosis. The mitochondrial pathway (right) is activated
  by cellular stress signals, including growth factor withdrawal and DNA damage, and
  often results in activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (Bad, Bid, Bim,
  and Bax). These pro-apoptotic proteins form dimers with anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and
  Bcl-2 at the surface of mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization
  (MMP) and subsequent release of cytochrome C (Cyto C). Consequently, Apaf-1 and
  procaspase9 associate with Cyto C to form an apoptosome, resulting in caspase9 activation.
  Procaspase3 is then cleaved by caspase9 to form caspase3, committing the cell to
  apoptosis. Inhibition of apoptosis is primarily mediated by components of the RTK/PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway. The death receptor-mediated pathway (left) is triggered by members
  of the Fas (or CD95) receptor superfamily upon stimulation by FasL. This interaction
  results in the formation of death-inducing complex, which comprises FADD (Fas-associated
  death domain protein) and procaspase8, and subsequent caspase8/3 activation. The
  activity of caspase3 is antagonized by IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis), which in
  turn are antagonized by SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase)
