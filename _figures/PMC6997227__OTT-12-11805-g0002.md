caption: PI3K/PIP3 signaling activates Akt signaling via Akt/PDK-1 activation, which
  results in the downregulation of apoptosis. However, the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3
  is reversed by PTEN. In addition, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R)
  and its ligand play an essential role in regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis.
  The binding of the ligand to IGF-1R triggers various downstream signaling pathways,
  including the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is essential for cell survival. In BCa, these
  miRNAs regulate the PTEN/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
