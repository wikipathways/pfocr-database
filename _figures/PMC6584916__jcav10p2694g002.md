caption: Slit/Robo protein proteolytic processing. (A). Slit protein proteolytic processing.
  Full-length Slit ligands are cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains
  to create an N-terminal fragment (Slit N) and a C-terminal fragment (Slit C), both
  of which combine with different receptors and serve strikingly different functions.
  (B). Robo protein proteolytic processing. Slit protein in the extracellular matrix
  binds to the first Ig of Robo1 at the second LRR structure and creates tension in
  the Robo juxtamembrane domain, allowing metalloprotease ADAM10 Kuzbanian to cleave
  the Robo ectodomain. The remaining segment may be hydrolyzed further by γ-secretase
  and enter the nucleus to initiate downstream molecules.
