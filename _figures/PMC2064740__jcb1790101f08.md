caption: Synthesis and transport of GSLs. (A) In the traditional model, ceramide moves
  to the cis-Golgi via vesicular transport and is converted to SM and GlcCer. GlcCer
  is further processed by transferases in the trans-Golgi and TGN. (B) In the updated
  model, most ceramide is transported to the trans-Golgi by CERT, SM is produced in
  the lumen, and GlcCer is produced on the cytosolic surface. Most GlcCer is transported
  back to the ER via FAPP2, whereas another fraction reaches the cytosolic surface
  of the plasma membrane (or endosome), where it is translocated. The ER GlcCer (our
  assays do not strictly exclude the possibility that this is actually the cis-Golgi)
  enters the secretory pathway and is converted to LacCer and GM3 in the trans-Golgi
  followed by further modification in the TGN, depending on cell type. It remains
  unclear whether any GlcCer translocates directly across the Golgi membrane.
