caption: MSCs enhance EC stability through direct EC-MSC interactions and the release
  of soluble factors. Working biological model showing how MSCs inhibit EC proliferation,
  migration, and sprouting via release paracrine factors and direct effects following
  EC-MSC contact. Inhibition of these processes stabilizes the endothelium and may
  improve outcome in pathological conditions characterized by unregulated assembly
  or disassembly of blood vessels. Color images available online at www.liebertpub.com/scd
