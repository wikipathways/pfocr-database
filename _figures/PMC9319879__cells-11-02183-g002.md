caption: 'KRAS downstream signaling activation cross-talk with apoptosis pathways
  regulation. KRAS can modulate apoptosis, through the regulation of the downstream
  effector pathways, which mainly results in cell survival, especially through the
  activation of PI3K pathway. After, KRAS activates PI3K and AKT: the last protein
  leads to the inhibition of Bad, a pro-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, preventing
  the inhibition of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Furthermore, PI3K
  can activate Rac, which consequently activates the transcription factor NF-kB, involved
  in the production of survival signals, as NF-kB promotes the transcription of several
  anti-apoptotic genes, including inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (IAPs). In addition,
  Rac can lead to the activation of NF-kB through Tiam 1, as also AKT can phosphorylate
  and activate IKK, thus stimulating NF-kB. Additionally, the induction of MAPK pathway
  contributes to the control of apoptosis, through MEK activity. Thus, KRAS leads
  to the downregulation of Par-4, a pro-apoptotic protein, and the expression level
  of several proteins that belong to Bcl-2 family is regulated. This includes the
  downregulation of Bim, a pro-apoptotic member, and the upregulation of the anti-apoptotic
  proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. In contrast, KRAS can engage pro-apoptotic signaling
  pathways, through the activation of RASSF1/Nore 1/Mst1 complex, stimulating caspase-3
  activation.'
