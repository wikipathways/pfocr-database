caption: 'The Cartoon: The activation of HIPPO/YAP1 can induce FSTL3 expression, which
  then promotes EMT and enhanced aerobic glycolysis to affect invasion, migration
  and metastasis formation of CRC cells by activating the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. FSTL3
  serves as a bridging molecule in the crosstalk between HIPPO/YAP1 and Wnt/β-Catenin
  pathways and is a crucial regulatory factor of the molecular mechanisms governed
  by Wnt/β-Catenin in CRC.'
