caption: (A) The phenylethylamine metabolic pathway is down-regulated (green) in the
  ΔtynA strain when compared to the wt strain in M9-lactose-PEA medium. (B) The oxidation
  of propionate to pyruvate is up-regulated (red) in the ΔtynA strain. Pathways are
  depicted according to Brock et al. and Zeng et al. [,].
