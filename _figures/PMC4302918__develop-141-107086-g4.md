caption: Effects of mitochondrial function on HSC maintenance and ROS production.
  Mitochondria in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized as having an immature
  morphology with lower metabolic activity, as determined by lower ATP output, O2
  consumption, total mass and membrane potential (ΔΨ) when compared with more differentiated
  cells. These attributes appear to be required for stem cell and especially for HSC
  maintenance. The balance between stem cell maintenance (green) and the loss of quiescence
  and self-renewal capacity (red) can be influenced by the abundance and activity
  of certain proteins (blue boxes). Knock out of the corresponding genes leads to
  disruption of normal mitochondrial status in stem cells and changes in ROS either
  by decreasing the function and health of the mitochondria (top), increasing mitochondria
  biogenesis (middle) or activating the mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation pathway
  (bottom). BIM, BCL2-like 11; DJ-1, Parkinson disease (autosomal recessive, early
