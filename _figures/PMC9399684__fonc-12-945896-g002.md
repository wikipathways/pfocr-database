caption: Ion channels involve in chemo-resistance through cancer stem cell. Blockade
  of Cav3.2 by either mibefradil or ES inhibits cell proliferation and GSC differentiation.
  1B50-1 positive HCCs exhibits tumor-initiating cells property, treatment of the
  monoclonal antibody of 1B50-1 activates ERK1/2 signaling pathway to result in apoptosis
  of TICs, thus overcome chemo-resistance. Voltage-gated calcium channels, sodium
  channels, or BK channels are over-expressed in ovarian CSCs. TM inhibits these ion
  channels’ currents, and reduces transcription factors of Oct3/4 and SOX2 via β-catenin
  signaling and ERK1/2 phosphorylation related to stemness and cell growth of ovarian
  CSCs, therefore abating chemo-resistance. Inhibition of KCa1.1 by its selective
  blocker of Paxilline can overcome antiandrogen acquired resistance due to MDM2 in
  human prostate cancer stem cells, meanwhile, this inhibition also overcomes acquired
  resistance of DOX due to MRP5 in LNCaP stem cells characterized with stemness markers
  of NANOG, CD44 and KLF4. CBD increases expression of AML-1a which subsequently binds
  to TRPV2 promoter to enhance transcription, and then induces GSCs differentiation,
  thus increasing the sensitivity to BCNU by triggering GSCs apoptosis. GSC, glioblastoma

  description: Ion channels involve in chemo-resistance through cancer stem cell.
    Blockade of Cav3.2 by either mibefradil or ES inhibits cell proliferation and
    GSC differentiation. 1B50-1 positive HCCs exhibits tumor-initiating cells property,
    treatment of the monoclonal antibody of 1B50-1 activates ERK1/2 signaling pathway
    to result in apoptosis of TICs, thus overcome chemo-resistance. Voltage-gated
    calcium channels, sodium channels, or BK channels are over-expressed in ovarian
    CSCs. TM inhibits these ion channels’ currents, and reduces transcription factors
    of Oct3/4 and SOX2 via β-catenin signaling and ERK1/2 phosphorylation related
    to stemness and cell growth of ovarian CSCs, therefore abating chemo-resistance.
    Inhibition of KCa1.1 by its selective blocker of Paxilline can overcome antiandrogen
    acquired resistance due to MDM2 in human prostate cancer stem cells, meanwhile,
    this inhibition also overcomes acquired resistance of DOX due to MRP5 in LNCaP
    stem cells characterized with stemness markers of NANOG, CD44 and KLF4. CBD increases
    expression of AML-1a which subsequently binds to TRPV2 promoter to enhance transcription,
