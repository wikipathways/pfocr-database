caption: Polyamines contribute to the repair of single-strand and double-strand breaks.
  Homologous recombination enables cells to achieve high-fidelity repair of double-strand
  breaks and other complex DNA damage. PARP1 is essential for single-strand break
  (SSB) repair by binding to DNA at the sites of SSBs and recruiting repair machinery.
  PARP repair via the base excision repair (BER) pathway is the default repair pathway
  in HR deficient cells, such as that which occurs with loss of BRCA1 or BRAC2 function.
  As a DNA damage sensor and master regulator, ATM phosphorylates CHK2 at residue
  Thr68 followed by autophosphorylation at residue Ser516, activating CHK2 that phosphorylates
  proteins involved in both base excision repair and HR. CHK2 phosphorylation of PARP
  facilitates nuclear localization of PARP and enhances PARP activity. CHK2 also phosphorylates
  XRCC1 at the Thr284 residue, enhancing its interaction with sites of DNA damage
  and promoting base excision repair. Polyamines are PARP1 cofactors and enhance PARP
  activity in ssDNA break repair. Polyamines enhance DNA strand exchange activity
  of Rad51 recombinase in HR repair and may also contribute to PARylation of dsDNA
  break repair proteins.
