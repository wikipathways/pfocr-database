caption: 'Simplified gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis and signaling pathway in plants,
  and abundance of GA profiles in aerial tissues derived from crown buds of glyphosate-treated
  leafy spurge. (a) GA biosynthesis occurs in three stages in different subcellular
  compartments: cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate by copalyl diphosphate synthase
  (CPS) and ent-kaurene synthase (KS) to produce ent-kaurene in the plastids; conversion
  of ent-kaurene into GA12 via cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (e.g., KO, KAO) in the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER); conversion of GA12 to bioactive forms of GA (e.g., GA1
  and GA4 indicated with blue text) in the cytosol via 13-hydroxylation pathway or
  non-hydroxylation pathway. Red italic text indicates the genes involved in particular
  step/s of the pathway. (b) Abundance of GA precursors (GA19, GA24, GA53) and catabolism
  products (GA34). Data represent the mean of four biological replicates obtained
  from lyophilized tissue (DW), ‘nd’ indicates ‘not detectable’; vertical bars indicate ± SE
  of the mean'
