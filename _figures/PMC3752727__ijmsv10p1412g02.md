caption: 'Possible mechanisms underlying the impairment of the HIF-1α pathway by hyperglycemia
  (2). A, B, C: the roles of hyperglycemia-induced ROS; A: The reaction between O2-
  and NO results in a decrease in steady-state NO concentration and thereby reduces
  NO-induced HIF-1α accumulation and activation; B: Rac1 contributes to HIF-1α expression
  and transactivation; ROS inhibits HIF-1 expression through repression of Rac1 expression;
  C: ROS degrade HIF-1α by activating a proline hydroxylase in the presence of iron
  and by increasing ubiquitin-proteasome activity; D: The inhibition of HIF-1α might
  be involved in the role of TNF-α, angiotensin II and the insulin pathway (insulin,
  IGF-1, IGF-2). HIF-1: hypoxia-inducible factor 1; IGF: insulin-like growth factor;
  NO: nitric oxide; O2-: superoxide; PHDs: prolyl hydroxylases; ROS: reactive oxygen
  species; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α.'
