caption: Oxidative inactivation of PTEN in insulin-related metabolism and muscle differentiation.
  Stimulation of growth factor receptors induces NOX2 activity and the production
  of ROS, which can oxidize PTEN and upregulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. As
  a result, glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity are increased. During muscle differentiation,
  mitochondria-derived ROS can also oxidize PTEN and promote mTOR-induced myogenic
  autophagy
