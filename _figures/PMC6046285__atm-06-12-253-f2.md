caption: Estrogen (E2) activates IGF-1R pathway in ACC cells. The phosphorylation
  of ER-α by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway led to ER-α translocation
  into nucleus. Once there, ER-α induces cell proliferation through regulation of
  CCDN-1 expression. ER-α non-genomic signaling stimulates IGF-1R phosphorylation,
  leading to a ligand-independent activation of the IGF-1R pathway. Moreover, the
  phosphorylation of IGF-1R by ER-α leads to phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element
  bindings (CREB) protein which regulates IGF-1R expression via binding to its promoter.
  IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor.
