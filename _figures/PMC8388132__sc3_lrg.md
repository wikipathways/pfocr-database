caption: Covid-19 and SUD vulnerability. SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19,
  enters the CNS and activates immune responses, increasing inflammation. The interplay
  between inflammation and dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway destabilize monoamines
  including serotonin, glutamate and dopamine, resulting in the increased vulnerability
  to drug use, misuse, and SUDs.
