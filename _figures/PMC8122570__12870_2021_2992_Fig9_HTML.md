caption: A proposed model explaining how GhWAKs regulate cotton resistance to V. dahliae.
  V. dahliae (VD) could secrete various toxins and carbohydrate active enzymes, which
  break plant cell wall (CW) integrity and generate some degradation products, such
  as pectin and oligogalacturonides (OGs). GhWAKs, plasma membrane (PM) localizing
  proteins with transmembrane domain (TM), potentially and directly interact with
  these cell wall fragments and some cell wall proteins (e.g. glycine-rich proteins,
  GRPs) by extracellular domains (EDs), and then activate jasmonate (JA) and salicylic
  acid (SA) signaling pathway via their cytoplasmic pkinase domain (PK). As a result,
  defence responses are activated, such as the accumulation of lignin, H2O2 and nitric
  oxide (NO), and the activity of peroxidase (POD)
