caption: ROP proteins are delivered into the cell during and after parasite entry
  and differentially activate host signaling pathways. Type I strains use ROP16 to
  phosphorylate and activate STAT3 and STAT6 leading to activation of an AAM-type
  gene expression profile (left). By contrast, the Type II ROP16 has a negligible
  effect on STAT3 and STAT6. Instead, GRA15 activates NF-κB to drive a CAM-type response,
  while the Type I GRA15 has a negligible effect on NF-κB activation in Type I strains
  where ROP16 activates STAT3 and STAT6. The parasite entry pathway and structure
  modified from .
