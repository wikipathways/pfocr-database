caption: GProX Pathway Analysis of the Cellular Response to EGF Stimulation. The regulation
  after 30 min stimulation with EGF was mapped to the ErbB KEGG signaling pathway.
  Nodes corresponding to proteins identified in the example data are color-coded according
  to regulation so up-regulated proteins are colored in shades of red, down-regulated
  proteins are colored in shades of blue and not regulated proteins are gray. This
  analysis illustrate that after 30 min of EGF stimulation the proteins upstream in
  the pathway have returned to the control state or are down-regulated while downstream
  effector proteins remain up-regulated.
