caption: 'Representation of the major players in the ceramide metabolism pathways.
  Enzymes are in italics with the genes characterized as part of this study in bold:
  serine palmitoyltransferase, 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase, ceramide glucosyltransferase,
  and acid ceramidase. Enzymes involved in the de novo synthesis of ceramide are in
  purple. Those implicated in the enzymatic break-down of ceramide are in green and
  the enzymes responsible for ceramide’s catabolic generation are in blue. Genes that
  were discovered in the Crassostrea gigas transcriptome using bioinformatics have
  a superscript “Cg” in orange. The pathway is adapted from [,].'
