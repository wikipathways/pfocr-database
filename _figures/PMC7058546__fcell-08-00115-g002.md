caption: Main biochemical pathways involved in lipid metabolism. (A–C) Pathways involved
  in lipid catabolism. (A) In order to be catabolized, free fatty acids (FFAs) must
  first travel to the mitochondrial matrix through the carnitine shuttle. IMS – inner
  mitochondrial space. (B) Once incorporated into the matrix, fatty acyl-CoA molecules
  undergo rounds of FAO, resulting in one molecule of acetyl-CoA (with two carbon
  atoms) and another molecule of fatty acyl-CoA with the original number of carbon
  atoms minus 2. This process is repeated until only two carbon atoms are left. (C)
  The resulting acetyl-CoA molecules are then incorporated into the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle, where the carbon atoms will be fully reduced into CO2, generating
  NADH, FADH2, GTP (and hence, ATP) and H+ protons to fuel the oxidative phosphorylation
  process in the mitochondrial cristae, regulated by the electron transport chain.
  (D) In order to make new FAs (i.e. lipid anabolism), citrate leaves the mitochondria
  to start the de novo lipogenesis pathway. In all diagrams, enzymes are in dark blue
  to the left [in panel (C), they are numbered]; main metabolites are in the middle
  in blue; and co-factors/resulting products are in light blue to the right. Mitochondrial
  membranes are represented in pink.
