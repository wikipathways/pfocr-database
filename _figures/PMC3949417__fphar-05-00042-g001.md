caption: Sensing of transferrin-bound iron and regulation of hepcidin expression in
  hepatocytes. The iron-sensing process involves binding of transferrin-bound iron
  to TfR1 causing a dissociation of Hfe from the Hfe/TfR1 partnership, relocation
  of Hfe to TfR2 and presumably the formation of a large membrane-bound complex composed
  of Hfe/TfR2/Hjv and BMPRII and I. This hepatocyte-membrane complex activates transduction
  cascade involving the phosphorylation of the Smad1/5/8 and subsequent binding of
  common Smad4 protein to form a transcriptional complex which directly activates
  hepcidin transcription. The Bmp/Smad signaling is the central pathway for the regulation
  of hepcidin transcription. Lack of Hfe and other components of the membrane-bound
  complex severely impair the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and consequently the transcription
  of hepcidin. Combined deficiency of Hfe and TfR2 results in decreased Erk/Mapk signaling
  activity in the liver, implicating that additional or parallel signaling pathway
  to Bmp/Smad may be involved in the control of hepatic hepcidin transcription.
