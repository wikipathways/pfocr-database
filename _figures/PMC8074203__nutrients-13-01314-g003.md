caption: Fructose pathway involved in oxidative stress and inflammation. In the hepatocyte,
  fructose sugar is rapidly metabolized by KHK, depleting ATP and resulting in uric
  acid accumulation. Uric acid activates NADPH oxidase with production of ROS, which
  activates mitochondrial ROS production and stimulates UPR in ER. ER stress may also
  activate mitochondrial ROS production and vice versa. Moreover, ER stress contributes
  to progression of hepatic steatosis activating lipogenic genes via PERK, ATF4, and
  IRE1 and inducing SREBP-1c that increases the activity of ACC and FAS. As a response
  of excessive oxidative stress, inflammatory and apoptotic pathways are activated
  through JNK, NFkB, and CHOP, resulting in an increased production of cytokines (IL1ß,
  TNFa, IL19), which plays an important role in the development of NASH. Fructose
  consumption may alter GUT microbiota and intestinal permeability, increasing endotoxin
  translocation of, for example, LPS, the most common PAMPs, into the liver via portal
  circulation. PAMPs may activate TLR4 that promotes the Kupffer activation and, subsequently,
  inflammatory pathways. Altered lipid homeostasis and fatty acids such as palmitate,
  in which production is promoted by fructose, may activate TLR4. TLR4, but also the
  excess of fat, activate the inflammasome involved in production of inflammatory
  cytokines. ACC, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ATF4, activating transcription factor 4;
  CHOP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding homologous protein; IRE1, inositol-requiring signaling
  protein 1; IL, interleukin; FAS, fatty acids synthase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  KHK, ketohexokinase; FFA, free, fatty acids; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NASH, non-alcoholic
  steatohepatitis; NFkB, nuclear factor kB; NLRP3, PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns; PERK, protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase; SREBP1c, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein 1c; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alfa; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4.
