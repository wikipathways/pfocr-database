caption: Regulation of cell proliferation and cell death by PKCε. PKCε can cause disordered
  cell growth by stimulating the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway downstream of Ras proto-oncogene.
  It can also send survival signal via the PI3K/Akt pathway. PKCε can increase phosphorylation
  of Akt at Ser473 by facilitating interaction of Akt with a putative PDK2, such as
  DNA-PK. PKCε has been shown to increase the levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2. It can
  interact with Bax and inhibit its activation, dimerization and translocation to
  mitochondria. It can also phosphorylate Bad and prevents its translocation to the
  mitochondria. An increase in the ratio of anti- to proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members
  in the mitochondria inhibits release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and prevents
  activation of procaspase-9. PKCε can also inhibit receptor-initiated cell death
  pathway by decreasing the level of Bid and thus decreasing the amount of truncated
  Bid in the mitochondria. PKCε is a substrate for caspase-7. In response to apoptotic
  stimuli, full-length PKCε is cleaved at the hinge region to generate the C-terminal
  catalytic domain, which is active in the absence of cofactors.
