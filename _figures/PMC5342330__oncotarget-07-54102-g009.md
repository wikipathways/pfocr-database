caption: MDA-9 regulates stem cell survival and pluripotency by regulating several
  molecular activities and promoting defined gene expression changes. The survival
  pathway is affected by the expression, degradation or activation of the constituents
  of the NOTCH1/C-Myc signaling pathway. Stemness is regulated by the STAT3/Nanog
  signaling pathway, which is likely regulated by p-p44/42 and IGF-R1. Ub = Ubiquitin,
  PDL = PDZ ligand, ICD = Intracellular domain, DLL1 = Delta-like protein 1, LNX1
  = Ligand of numb protein 1, RBPJK = Recombining binding protein suppressor of hairless.
