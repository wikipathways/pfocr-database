caption: The mechanism of high protein-induced diarrhea in weaned piglets. High-protein
  diets not only reduce the expression of tight junction (TJ), but also up-regulate
  the expression of genes related to MLCK and ROCK signaling pathways, thereby increasing
  the permeability of intestinal mucosa. The NF-κB pathway is also activated to increase
  the expression of cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8. When excessive
  protein enters the intestine, B cells differentiate into plasma cells. On one hand,
  IgA, IgG and IgM are secreted to mediate the intestinal immune response. On the
  other hand, IgE is secreted to promote mast cells to release active mediators such
  as histamine, and induce type I allergic reactions. Moreover, T cells differentiate
  into CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells after recognizing foreign antigen proteins, inducing
  type IV allergic reactions. For the regulation of microorganisms, the combination
  of protein and acid increases the pH value of the intestine, increasing the abundance
  of pathogenic bacteria and decreasing that of probiotics. MLCK = myosin light chain
  kinase; ROCK = Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinase; Ig = immunoglobulin;
  IL = interleukins; TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor-α; NF-κB = nuclear factor κB
