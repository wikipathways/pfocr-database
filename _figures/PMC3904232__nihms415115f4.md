  NRPS-PKS megacomplexes from B. subtilis []. The erythromycin pathway is shown from
  Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL 2338 and echinomycin pathway from Streptomyces

  TE = thioesterase, AT = acyltransferase, KS = ketosynthase, KR = ketoreductase,
  DH = dehydratase, ER = enoylreductase. Bacteriochlorophyll (bottom left) is incorporated
  into light harvesting complexes. FeMoCo (bottom right) is produced by a metabolic
  pathway () and incorporated into nitrogenase (image from []). All images reproduced
