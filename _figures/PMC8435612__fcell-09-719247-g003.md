caption: Molecular mechanism of lncRNAs and miRNAs mediated accumulation of dopaminergic
  neuron loss, α-synuclein aggregation and autophagy in PD. (A) LncRNAs regulate α-synuclein
  aggregation and autophagy. SNHG1 and lnc-MALAE1 are highly expressed in AD, promotes
  the α-synuclein aggregation. SNHG1 also can inhibit autophagy by reducing the expression
  of mTOR. Linc-P21 is down-expressed in PD and promotes aggregation through overexpression
  of miR-1277-5P. (B) LncRNAs regulate dopaminergic neuron loss. Overexpression of
  the H19 could prevent dopaminergic neuron loss in the 6-OHDA-induced PD model by
  activating HPRT1-mediated Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway via impairing miR-301b-3p-targeted
  repression of HPRT1 transcription. NEAT1 upregulation in dopaminergic neurons of
  PD may protect dopaminergic neurons from LRRK2-mediated damage under the oxidative
  stress. Overexpression of the ln_SNHG14 could promote dopaminergic neuron loss.
