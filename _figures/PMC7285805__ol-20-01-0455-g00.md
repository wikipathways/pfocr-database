caption: STAT6 modulates pro-colitis and pro-cancer responses. The IL-13/STAT6 signaling
  pathway appears to be detrimental to the function of intestinal epithelial cells
  in subjects with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, in which nuclear pSTAT6
  is significantly increased in the colonic epithelium. IL-13 signaling alters the
  expression of proteins, including the pore-forming tight junction protein claudin-2,
  matriptase, prostasin and serotonin, involved in epithelial barrier permeability
  and gastrointestinal barrier function via STAT6. In addition, IL-13 produced by
  CD4+ T helper 2 cells favors STAT6 phosphorylation in mast cells, B cells and macrophages
  during the development of colitis, suggesting that STAT6 signaling in immune cells
  favors the progression of the disease. In the tumor microenvironment, STAT6 coordinates
  both polyp cell proliferation and myeloid-derived suppressor cell expansion. Furthermore,
  the IL-4/STAT6 signaling pathway induces the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins
  and the growth of epithelial colon cancer cells. STAT6 activation prompts the differentiation
  of infiltrating macrophages into a tumor-associated phenotype with pro-tumoral functions;
  these M2 macrophages promote mucosal repair through the activation of the Wnt signaling
  pathway. However, mutations that cause aberrant Wnt signaling are responsible for
  polyp development in the small intestine and colon. Additionally, the exposure to
  IL-13 enhances the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-promoting
  factors, resulting in a decrease in adhesion, migration, invasion and metastatic
  colonization. pSTAT6, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription
  6; IL-R, interleukin receptor; TAMs, tumor-associated macrophages; MDSC, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cell.
