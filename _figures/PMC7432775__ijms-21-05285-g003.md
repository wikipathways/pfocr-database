caption: Working model of phospholipid signaling and SA role in the biosynthesis of
  the secondary metabolites in C. chinense cell suspensions. In this model, we propose
  that SA near the plasma membrane may be identified by a receptor and activate a
  signaling cascade through phospholipases (PLC and PLD). PAL genes expression is,
  in part, under the control of SA and is mediated by second messengers such as IPn
  (dashed black arrow). These second messengers may increase Ca2+-dependent signaling
  (solid black arrow), which results in the regulation of transcription factors or
  protein kinases (dashed black arrow), and therefore causing an increase in the expression
  levels of phenylalanine ammonia–lyase (PAL) genes. However, in the presence of U73122
  or neomycin (inhibitors of PLC signaling), the levels of DAG and IPn (second messengers)
  are reduced (solid red arrow), which leads to the alteration of intracellular Ca2+
  levels (dashed red arrow) that may affect the accumulation of PAL mRNA. The responses
  of cells to SA, result in the production of second messengers, such as DAG, IPn
  or PA, generated from the phospholipid-signaling pathway and are involve in the
  regulation of PAL activity and in the production of vanillin.  represents decrease
  of PIP2 in the presence of neomycin.  represents increase of PIP2 due to the inhibition
  in the enzymatic activity of the PLC by U73122.
