caption: PSME3 regulates host defense against bacterial pathogens by regulating the
  stability of the transcription factor KLF2. After bacterial infection or TLR ligands
  stimulation, PSME3, whose expression is upregulated via the NF-κB pathway, directly
  binds to and destabilizes KLF2, leading to augmented activation of NF-κB signaling.
