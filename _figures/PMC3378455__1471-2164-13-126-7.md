caption: 'Picrosides biosynthetic pathway in P. kurrooa (adapted from Kawoosa et al.
  and Dixon and Paiva [,]). Picrosides are iridoid glycosides derived from cyclization
  of geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) to iridoid moiety. Glucose and cinnamate/vanillate
  convert iridoid into picroside I and picroside II. These steps involve series of
  hydroxylation and glycosylation reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 and glycosyltransferases.
  GPP can be derived from mevalonate (MVA) or 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate
  (MEP) pathway. Enzymes of MVA pathway are as follows: AACT, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase;
  HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A reductase; MVK, mevalonate kinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; PMD, diphosphomevalonate
  decarboxylase. Enzymes of MEP pathway are DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase;
  DXR, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase; MCT, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; CMK, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  kinase; MDS, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; HDS, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl
  diphosphate synthase; HDR, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase. Isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate isomerase (IPPI) catalyzes the isomerisation of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate
  (DMAPP) to IPP whereas conversion of IPP to geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) is catalyzed
  by geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPS). Enzyme of phenylpropanoid pathway involved
  in biosynthesis of cinnamate are PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; 4-CH, cinnamic
  acid 4-hydroxylase; 3-CH, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; COMT, caffeoyl-CoA 3-O methyltransferase.
  Solid arrows indicate known steps, whereas broken arrows represent unknown intermediates
  and enzymes. Numerals in parenthesis indicate fold change in gene expression at
  15째C as compared to 25째C based on reads per exon kilobase per million (RPKM) values
  (detailed RPKM values are shown in Figure 8 and Additional file ).'
