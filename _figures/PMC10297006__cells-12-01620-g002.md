caption: Ezrin controls several major cellular functions through the regulation of
  downstream signaling transduction pathways. Ezrin is transcriptionally regulated
  by several transcriptional factors, such as SP1 and Six1. Ezrin can activate Rho
  signaling to augment cell motility and cell adherence. Ezrin can also activate the
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to enhance cell survival. Moreover, Ezrin plays a role
  in cell phagocytic and cannibalistic processes
