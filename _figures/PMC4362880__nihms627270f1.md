caption: '– beta amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) is a glycosylated integral trans-membrane
  protein of ~695–770 amino acids (~80 kDa MW) that is acted upon by a series of secretases
  to generate a range of neuroactive peptides. For example, α-secretase activity in
  association with tetraspanin (TSPAN12) proximity, distintegrin and metalloproteinase
  protein ADAM10, and other accessory proteins cleave βAPP to generate a ~621 amino
  acid neurotrophic sAPPα peptide via the neurotrophic signaling pathway. Interestingly
  sAPPα is very abundant in the vitreous of the eye and in healthy brain cells, particularly
  in the extracellular space (ECF) [Bhattacharjee, Zhao and Lukiw; unpublished observations].
  Alternate processing of βAPP by tandem beta- and gamma secretase (β, γ secretase)
  cleavage (in the presence of ancillary membrane proteins such as presenilin 1 (PS1)
  and other proteins can result in the generation of 37–43 amino acid Aβ peptides,
  the most common of which are the peri-vascular Aβ40 and peri-neuronal Aβ42; the
  Aβ40 and especially Aβ42 peptides self-aggregate to form dense senile plaque and
  retinal drusen deposits (yellow ovals); the natural accumulation and aggregation
  of Aβ40 and especially Aβ42 peptides are strongly amyloidogenic; certain neurotoxic
  trivalent elements such as aluminum and iron (Me+++) and perhaps other genotoxic
  metals in our environment appear to stimulate this aggregation while also promoting
  oxidative stress, inflammation and other neurotoxic effects [–]. Importantly, Aβ42
  peptides added exogenously and acutely may activate different cellular responses
  than the more chronic endogenous generation of these peptides [,–,,]. Normally Aβ42
  peptides are efficiently removed by a phagocytosis clearance system involving in
  part the triggering receptor for myeloid/microglial cells (TREM2), a variably glycosylated
  transmembrane sensor-receptor known to be enriched in the microglial cell plasma
  membrane. Signaling via the tyrosine kinase-binding protein (DNAX activation protein
  12) [TYROBP (DAP12)] accessory receptor results in phagocytosis and ultimately,
  removal of Aβ42 peptides (yellow ovals) from the extracellular space [–]; interestingly,
  TREM2 knockout/knockdown mice have attenuated immunological and inflammatory responses
  and/or increases in age-related neuroinflammatory markers and cognitive deficiency
  [,,]; TYROBP knockout mice exhibit immune system deficits and an impairment in microglial
  cell differentiation [,]; insufficient TREM2 may be in part responsible for the
  inability to adequately phagocytose Aβ42 peptides, resulting in their buildup and
  self-aggregation in the extracellular space. Aβ42 peptide sensing and clearance
  may also be accomplished in part through the microglial-enriched transmembrane CD33/Siglec
  protein and others (see text); interestingly, like TREM2, CD33/Siglec exhibits decreased
  expression in peripheral mononuclear cells in AD [,]. Upper right inset: miRNA-34a
  has been found to be significantly increased in AD hippocampal CA1, superior temporal
  lobe, in stressed microglial cells and in the retina of transgenic AD murine models
  overexpressing Aβ42 peptides [63,77; Bhattacharjee, Zhao, Lukiw, unpublished observations);
  miRNA-34a targeting of the TREM2 mRNA 3′-UTR and TREM2 down-regulation appears to
  be in part responsible for this defect [,–,,,,]. Because miRNA-34a is encoded on
  an NF-kB-sensitive transcript, natural or synthetic anti-NF-kB and/or anti-miRNA
  strategies may be clinically useful in the restoration of homeostatic phagocytosis
  and the clearance of excessive Aβ42 peptides from the brain, CNS and retina in AD
  and AMD [,,,]. Black hatched lines between ‘neurotrophic’ and ‘amyloidogenic’ and
  ‘amyloidogenic’ and ‘phagocytic (clearance)’ are drawn to delineate specific βAPP
  cleavage product pathways, however, in brain and retinal physiology these pathways
  are most likely to be highly integrated to achieve homeostasis in the βAPP-sAPPα-Aβ42
  trafficking system (see text).'
