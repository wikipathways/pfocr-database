caption: A simplified scheme highlighting processes in which PD-related proteins function
  in the endo-lysosomal pathway. Vesicles are recycled between the plasma membrane
  and the Golgi (and ER, not shown). LRRK-dependent phosphorylation of Endophilin
  A and Synaptojanin, and alpha-synuclein are important to facilitate in the endocytosis
  of vesicles. Recycling vesicles pass the retromer in conjunction with PLA2G6 to
  continue to the Golgi to recycle their cargo. A small number of vesicles will be
  transported to the lysosome to be degraded. In PD, the recycling of vesicles is
  disturbed by defective endocytosis or a dysfunctional retromer that is inhibited
  by alpha-synuclein. The effect of PD-related mutations on LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation
  remains unclear. The net effect is that the vesicles are not recycled to the Golgi,
  but are translocated to the lysosomes that expand and result in neurodegeneration.
