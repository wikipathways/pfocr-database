caption: 'A similar metabolic remodeling in heart failure and cancer. HIF1α is induced
  in both the failing cardiomyocyte and cancer cells, and can increase the expression
  of glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK),
  and the reductive glutamine pathway (shown in blue font). The increase in glycolysis
  is accompanied with the shuttling of glycolytic intermediates into the PPP and SBP,
  increasing nucleotide and amino acid synthesis, respectively. Furthermore, uncoupling
  of glycolysis with glucose oxidation results in an increase in lactate and H+ production
  in the cytoplasm. Inhibition of glucose oxidation is associated with closure of
  the MPTP, leading to apoptosis resistance. These metabolic alterations result in
  decreased cardiac efficiency and contractility in the heart and increased proliferation
  and apoptosis resistance in the tumor. HRE, Hypoxia Response Element; GLUT, Glucose
  Transporter; PPP, Pentose Phosphate Pathway; SBP, Serine Biosynthetic Pathway; PDK,
  Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase; PDC, Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex; ETC: Electron
  Transport Chain; MPTP, Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore.'
