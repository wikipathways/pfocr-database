caption: 'Interactive roles of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in TLR signaling. Pathogen exposure
  stimulates static cells, which activate the TLR signaling pathway (green). This
  leads to an initial outbreak of the proinflammatory cytokine, which are then greatly
  amplified in the feedforward loop through the cytokine receptor signaling pathway
  (yellow). Cytokine signaling also induces the up-regulation of TAM receptor expression,
  thereby driving TAM receptor signaling. Besides, TAM receptor signaling requires
  a synergistic interaction between IFNAR and transcription factor STAT1 (blue). The
  expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 are induced, which widely inhibits the cascade of
  TLR and cytokine receptors, thereby ending the innate immune response (blue). SOCS1
  and SOCS3 specific ways to inhibit TLR signaling: After LPS activates TLR4, signals
  are transmitted through the adaptor proteins including MyD88, MAL, TRIF and TRAM.
  Through MyD88 and MAL, NF-κB and MAPKs are activated by TRAF6 and TAK1, while IRF3
  is activated by TRAM and TRIF. The TRIF-IRF3 pathway can rapidly induce the production
  of cytokine and activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The JAK2/STAT5 signaling
  pathway is activated by LPS, which is connected with the IL-6 production. Besides,
  SOCS1 can inhibit the signaling of these JAK/STAT pathways. Phosphorylated MAL is
  connected with SOCS1, resulting in polyubiquitination and degradation of the MAL.
  Moreover, interactions between SOCS1 and p65 subunit of NF-κB can induce its degradation
  process to inhibit signaling. Besides, NF-κB-dependent transcription is inhibited
  by SOCS3 by binding inhibition between TRAF6 and TAK1. The figure is referenced
  from Figure 2 of Immunobiology of the TAM receptors (). IRAK, IL-1-receptor-associated
