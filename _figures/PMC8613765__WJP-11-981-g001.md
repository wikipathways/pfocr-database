caption: 'Supposed intracellular signaling pathway implicated in ketamine’s antidepressant-like
  effects. A: Ketamine antagonizes N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors in GABAergic
  interneurons, which in turn attenuate the inhibitory action of this system on glutamatergic
  tonus. Subsequently, the disinhibition of pyramidal cells results in a burst of
  glutamatergic transmission; B: The glutamate released in the synaptic cleft preferentially
  stimulates alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-5-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors,
  which promotes a transient sodium influx that depolarizes the neurons and activates
  voltage-dependent calcium channels. C: This event causes the exocytosis of synaptic
  vesicles containing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the synaptic cleft[,].
  BDNF culminates in protein kinase B activation that can phosphorylate and activate
  mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). In turn, mTORC1 phosphorylates
  the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase at Thr389, which regulates synaptic protein
  synthesis such as AMPA receptor subunit 1 and postsynaptic density-95, which contribute
  to dendritic spine formation and synaptogenesis[,]. NMDA: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid;
  AMPA: Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-5-4-isoxazole propionic acid; BDNF: Brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor; VDCC: Voltage-dependent calcium channels; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; Akt: Protein kinase B; TrkB: Tropomyosin receptor kinase B; GluA1: Glutamate
  AMPA receptor subunit 1; mTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; PSD-95:
  postsynaptic density protein-95 kDa.'
