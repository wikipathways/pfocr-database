caption: The more important lipids and metabolites associated with GVHD may indicate
  the main compensatory metabolic pathways modulated in hematopoietic cells pre-transplant.
  (A) Phospholipids metabolism are affected suggesting Phospholipase C activity to
  produce diacylglycerols (DAGs), and diacylglycerol lipase and monoacylglycerol lipase
  activity to produce monoacylglycerols (MAGs) and free fatty acids (FFA), respectively.
  Predominance of monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) free fatty acids
  are result of increased fatty acyl-CoA desaturases activity, increasing the anticancer
  activity of ω-3 fatty acids. This metabolic pathway is linked to elevated levels
  of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), produced in the
  tri-carboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and important on desaturases activity. (B) Glucose
  uptake is increased due to increased energy demands in hematopoietic cells, and
  increased aerobic glycolysis with increased NADH, providing NADH for the electron
  transport chain and resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS). (C) Oxidative stress
  compensation is achieved by activation of cysteine-glutathione pathway, and antioxidant
  action. Exacerbation of these mechanism leads to depletion of cysteine and glutathione,
  causing increased 2-aminobutyric acid-ophtalmate compensatory pathway activation
  originated from amino acids metabolism.
