caption: Possible mechanisms of action of targeted polyIC. Targeted polyIC is internalized
  upon activation of the targeted receptor, which is overexpressed on the tumor cells.
  The double-stranded polyIC is expected to activate TLR3, which is mainly found in
  endosomes. TLR3, via its adaptor Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing
  IFN-β (TRIF), induces the phosphorylation of IFN Regulating Factor 3 (IRF3) and
  its translocation into the nucleus, as well as the phosphorylation of IKK and nuclear
  translocation of NFκB. IRF3 and NF-κB activate transcription of IFN-α, IFN-β, and
  proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. Furthermore, upon endosomal release, polyIC
  can activate the cytoplasmic dsRNA receptors, PKR, MDA-5, and RIG-1. PKR and TLR3
  also activate the MAPK pathway, resulting in activation of AP-1 and apoptosis. PKR
  directly phosphorylates eIF2-α, arresting protein synthesis. IFN production leads
  to further feedback activation of the “antiviral” response. Thus, polyIC induces
  the production of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines, leading to apoptosis and
  immune recruitment by multiple pathways.
