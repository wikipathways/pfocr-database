caption: The translational pathways regulation during CoVs infection. (A) Double strand
  RNA (dsRNA) accumulation produced during the viral replication is one sensor of
  the interferon antiviral defense and leads to the phosphorylation and activation
  of PKR. Viral proteins accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) constitutes
  an ER stress and triggers the unfold protein response (UPR). As a result, PERK is
  phosphorylated and activated. Both PKR and PERK target the α subunit of eIF2 and
  its phosphorylation induces a global translational shutdown. The stress-activated
  phosphorylation of eIF2 can lead to the formation of stress granules (SGs) in which
  mRNAs stalled in translation initiation step are stored. SGs are connected with
  P-bodies structures as they share RNA and protein components. (B) Modulation of
  the p38MAPK and ERK pathways. ERK pathway controlled the phosphorylation state of
  4E-BP and promotes the dissociation between 4E-BP and eIF4E that enhances the cap-dependent
  translation. p38 MAPK pathway targets the MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase (Mnk) that phosphorylates eIF4E. As a consequence and in the context of CoVs
  infection, activation of this pathway is associated with a decrease of protein synthesis
  and viral replication. Viral components modulating the pathway are bolded in red.
