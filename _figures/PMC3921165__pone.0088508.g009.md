caption: APP is an integral membrane protein which undergoes post-translational modification
  such as glycosylation during its transfer through intracellular secretory pathway.
  The mature isoform of APP (i.e. APP holoprotein) is then acted upon by β- and γ-secretases
  to generate Aβ. The A2A receptor agonist, HENECA, induces production of Aβ42 in
  SH-SY5Y cells via cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. It enhances both synthesis and maturation
  processes of APP increasing total APP production. It also stimulates γ-secretase
  activity in mAPP cleavage resulting in Aβ generation. H2S not only interferes with
  the step of APP maturation, but also attenuates the production of APP holoprotein.
  By inhibiting AC (and subsequent cAMP production), H2S also inhibits γ-secretase
  activity. It ultimately leads to decreased production in Aβ.
