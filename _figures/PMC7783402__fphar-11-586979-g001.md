caption: Transportation of amino acids to placenta via mTOR signaling pathway Schematic
  diagram of mTOR pathway of placenta act as a nutrient sensor. It co-ordinates nutrient
  and growth factors to modulate transfer of maternal nutrients to the fetal circulation.
  MTORC1 modulates trafficking of AA transports by employing differential ubiquitination
  mediated by NEDD4-2. Inhibition of NEDD4-2 leads to enhanced localization of AA
  transporters in the plasma membrane.
