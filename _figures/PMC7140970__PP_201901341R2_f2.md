caption: Posttranslational modifications and interactions of LysM-RLKs determine symbiotic
  outcome. A, General themes of receptor regulation and activation towards symbiosis
  signaling. B, Known regulators of receptors. Signal cascades downstream of RLKs
  is best understood in Lotus japonicus (Lj)and Medicago truncatula (Mt). Nod-factor
  perception by LjNFR1/5/e complexes activate phosphorylation cascades and transduces
  signals to LjNiCK4, which then accumulates in the nucleus, positively regulating
  nodule organogenesis via an unknown mechanism. SYMRK activation can also directly
  activate transcription (e.g. via LjSIP1 to activate LjNIN expression) or suppress
  MAPK signalling (via LjSIP2). RLKs are also regulated by ubiquitination (such regulators
  denoted in gray), which may target RLKs to degradation via the 26S proteasome (e.g.
  MtPUB2), or alter RLK interactions/localization (e.g. LjSINA4, MtPUB1). Equally,
  they can be either positive or negative regulators of symbioses. Lotus PUB13, SINA4,
  and SIE3 and Medicago PUB1 and PUB2 are E3 ubiquitin ligases, but can either promote
  or suppress symbiosis. Deubiquitination of K63-linked ubiquitin chains by LjAMSH1
  is also required to coordinate infection and nodule organogenesis; although the
  differentially ubiquitinated targets are not clear. In Medicago, MtDMI2 was proposed
  to activate MtHMGR1 and hence the mevalonate pathway to produce a secondary messenger
  linking plasma membrane activation to perinuclear Ca2+-oscillations; however genetic
  data is still elusive. Cell biology and genetics also revealed that creation of
  nanodomains as potential signaling clusters are instrumental for infection. MtFLOT2/4
  and actin are primary nucleation sites, stabilising MtLYK3 while symbiosis-induced
  MtSYMREM1can further recruit MtNFP, DMI2 to the cluster. With the numerous possible
  downstream signals, how each of these pathways are activated in space and time and
  controlled during symbiosis will be important to fully understand the signaling
  processes in both RNS and AMS.
