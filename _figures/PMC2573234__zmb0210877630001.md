caption: Processing of RPM1-containing transcripts. (A) RPM1 is transcribed in a single
  transcription unit with both upstream  and downstream tRNAPro from the FP promoter
  (5′ end represented by *FP) or with only the downstream tRNAPro from the SP promoter
  (5′ end represented by *SP). 3′ tRNA endonuclease generates the high-molecular-weight
  precursor termed pre-RPM1-pro. The 5′ end of the precursor transcript is produced
  either by the SP promoter or by cleavage at the 3′ end of . The interval between
  the position of the SP promoter and  is indicated by a dotted line. RNase P processes
  the pre-RPM1-pro precursor RNA at the 5′ end of tRNAPro, generating the pre-RPM1
  intermediate. Further processing at the 5′ end of this intermediate in a Pet127-dependent
  reaction produces mature RPM1 RNA. (B) A Northern blot of total RNA extracted from
  the wild-type (wt) and htd2Δ strains was hybridized with a probe complementary to
  RPM1. A probe complementary to SCR1, the RNA subunit of the cytoplasmic signal recognition
  particle, was used as a loading control.
