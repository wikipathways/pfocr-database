caption: Two-step model of CD40 activation by CD40L (A) and anti-CD40 antibodies (B).
  In a first step, CD40L and anti-CD40 antibodies (αCD40) bind to monomeric (KDRm
  or KDα) or dimeric CD40 molecules (KDRd or KDα) with high affinity. The latter are
  formed to a small extent due to the weak autoaffinity of the CD40 pre-ligand binding
  assembly domain (PLAD; KDP). However, the trimeric (A) and dimeric CD40 complexes
  (B) resulting from CD40L and αCD40 binding are not sufficient, for example, to activate
  the classic NFκB signaling pathway. The latter requires the interaction of two (or
  more) trimeric TRAF adapter proteins and thus CD40 complexes with six or more receptor
  molecules, which can form in a second step by autoaggregation of CD40L- or αCD40-bound
  CD40 complexes. Due to the several powers of 10 increased local concentrations of
  trimeric and dimeric CD40 complexes that form in the cell–cell contact zone between
  CD40+ cells and membrane CD40L+ (A) or FcγR+ cells (B), respectively, membrane CD40L
  and FcγR-αCD40 complexes display a far stronger agonism than soluble CD40L and free
  αCD40 molecules. The micrographs shown in A illustrate the aggregation behavior
  of CD40, membrane CD40L, and CD40 in complex with memCD40L or soluble CD40L by help
  of fluorescent fusion proteins (CD40-YFP; CFP-memCD40L) or staining of Flag-tagged
  soluble CD40L with PE-conjugated anti-Flag antibody M2 (F-sCD40L). CD40 SC, CD40
  signaling complex. Dotted lines indicate plasma membranes.
