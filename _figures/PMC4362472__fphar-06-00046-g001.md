caption: Anatomical and pharmacological properties of the 5-HT2A receptors in the
  brain. (A) 5-HT2A receptors (5-HT2A-Rs) are located in brain regions involved in
  emotionality and epilepsy. (B) Interactions between 5-HT2A-Rs and beta-arrestin
  2. According to the nature of the 5-HT2A-Rs agonist (endogenous/exogenous), 5-HT2A-Rs-mediated
  signaling may recruit beta-arrestin2-dependant or -independent pathways (signaling
  phases). Such a beta-arrestin2 is also involved in the down regulation/internalization
  of the 5-HT2A-Rs (arresting phase). (C) Dimerization of the 5-HT2A-Rs with GPCRs
  is necessary to activate signaling pathway.
