caption: TJ, AJ, and desmosomes exist between two adjacent hepatocytes. TJ prevent
  mixing of blood (red) in sinusoid and bile (green) in canaliculi, and prevent mixing
  of blood from adjacent sinusoids. Dual loss of catenins at AJ affects TJ to disrupt
  hepatic tissue barrier, resulting in para-hepatocyte leaks allowing mixing of blood
  and bile, and blood from one sinusoid to another.A model depicting distinct mechanisms
  by which β-catenin regulates hepatic TJ integrity. At AJ, β-catenin or in its absence
  γ-catenin, stabilizes E-cadherin and in turn stabilizes TJ proteins occludin and
  plaque-forming claudins -3 and -5. As a component of the Wnt signaling pathway,
  β-catenin non-redundantly regulates expression of claudin-2 essential for biliary
  canalicular structure and bile flow. Loss of β-catenin alone affects claudin-2 expression
  only, but dual loss of catenins additionally affects occludin and plaque-forming
  claudins to affect TJ structure and barrier function.
