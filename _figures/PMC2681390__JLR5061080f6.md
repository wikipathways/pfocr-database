caption: Model of the DFA process based on the finding of TG storage in CLDs within
  enterocytes. Dietary TG is hydrolyzed in the small intestine lumen by pancreatic
  lipase to FFA and MG. These products are taken up by the enterocyte where they are
  rapidly resynthesized in ER (steps 1 and 2) to form TG. Within the ER, the TG is
  packaged in the core of CMs where it is secreted via the Golgi complex into lymphatics
  (steps 3 and 6). Alternatively, TG synthesized in the ER may be stored in CLDs (step
  4). TG stored in CLDs may be hydrolyzed by a lipase, such as pancreatic TG lipase
  or TG hydrolase. The hydrolyzed products of TG from CLDs may be transported back
  to the ER (step 5) and reenter the secretory pathway (steps 3 and 6) or excreted
  via the portal vein (step 7). Alternatively, hydrolyzed products may be catabolized
  within the enterocyte or used for other complex lipid synthesis, such as cholesterol
  esters or phospholipids (data not shown). DG, diacylglycerol; PL, pancreatic lipase.
