caption: A hypothetical model for the mechanism behind HCPro (helper component proteinase)‐mediated
  enhancement of Potato virus X (PVX) gene expression. (A) Schematic representation
  of the methionine cycle and how it is connected with the trans‐sulfuration and glutathione
  (GSH) biosynthesis pathways. S‐Adenosyl‐l‐methionine synthetase (SAMS) and S‐adenosyl‐l‐homocysteine
  hydrolase (SAHH), the major players of the methionine cycle, are at the heart of
  the model proposed. The role of SAMS is to convert methionine (MET) into S‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine
  (SAM). A methyl transferase (MT) [Hua enhancer 1 (HEN1) in this case] then uses
  SAM as its substrate to methylate its subject [small RNA (sRNA) in this case]. In
  this reaction, S‐Adenosyl‐l‐homocysteine (SAH) is produced as a byproduct. SAH is
  a potential feedback inhibitor for most of the MTs, including HEN1, and hence it
  needs to be hydrolysed by SAHH. As a result, adenosine and homocysteine (HCY) are
  produced. Methionine synthase (MS) further catalyses the conversion of HCY to MET,
  thus closing the circuit. However, there is another route for HCY to enter the methionine
  cycle. This is via the trans‐sulfuration pathway, where cysteine (Cys) acts as a
  precursor to HCY. Cys is also a precursor for GSH biosynthesis further downstream.
  (B) Putative alterations in the flow of metabolites in the concerned pathways on
  PVX–Potato virus A (PVA) mixed infection. In the context of potyvirus infection,
  HCPro has already been shown to interact with SAMS and to reduce its activity. The
  product of SAMS, SAM, is a universal methyl donor and an important metabolite, which
  takes part in various cellular pathways. PVX, being a capped virus, also depends
  on SAM for cap methylation. Interaction of HCPro with SAHH causes the overaccumulation
  of SAH in the system, HEN1 inhibition and the destabilization of small interfering
  RNAs (siRNAs), which is reflected as a higher PVX titre. Another direct effect of
  SAHH downregulation is debilitated conversion of SAH to HCY, which is predicted
  to pull Cys flux towards the methionine cycle via the trans‐sulfuration pathway,
  depriving GSH of its fair share of Cys. This is reflected in lower GSH production
  downstream, leading to a remarkably reduced GSH concentration. In addition, this
  condition upregulates PVX gene expression. Moreover, GSH reduction changes the cellular
  redox homeostasis, which may be reflected as the increased pathogenicity of PVX
  during synergistic PVX–PVA interaction.
