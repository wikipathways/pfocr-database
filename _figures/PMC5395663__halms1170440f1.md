caption: Throughout the AP axis, epithelial Shh induces Bmp4 expression in the adjacent
  mesenchyme, with the exception of the distal stomach where Bapx1 represses Bmp4
  and Wnt5a expression. In the distal stomach, Barx1, which is upstream of Bapx1,
  regulates the mesenchymal expression of the WNT antagonists sFRP1 and sFRP2 that
  inhibit WNT activity and Cdx expression in the gastric epithelium. In the small
  intestine, Foxf1 and Foxf2 activate Bmp4, leading to BMP activity in both mesoderm
  and endoderm. In the pyloric sphincter, Bmp4 activates the expression of Nkx2.5
  and Sox9 that induce the pyloric epithelial phenotype through modulation of mesenchymal-epithelial
  signaling. In addition, Bapx1, Gata3 and Isl1 regulate Sox9 expression in the pyloric
  structure. SOX9 controls Gremlin expression in the pyloric sphincter mesenchyme.
  Gremlin, a diffusible factor, modulates the activation of the endodermal BMP pathway
  to induce the specific pyloric epithelium differentiation.
