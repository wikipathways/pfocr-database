caption: Copper is passed (green arrows) to cuproproteins (dark green circles), including
  metallothioneins Crs5 and Cup1, in for example Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by copper
  metallochaperones (pale green circles, or ovals if membrane associated). Copper
  permeases (white ovals) import copper into the cell or deliver Cu(I) to compartments,
  such as the trans-Golgi network where secreted cuproproteins (such as Fet3) acquire
  copper. Fet3 oxidizes ferrous ions (curved brown arrow) to provide substrate for
  high-affinity iron import by Ftr1. P1-type ATPases (such as Ccc2) have one or more
  soluble N-terminal domains, which engage in regulatory interactions with copper
  metallochaperones (such as Atx1), but additional Cu(I) donation (hence two arrows)
  may supply the trans-membrane regions for Cu(I) transport. Metallation of the cytochrome
  c oxidase complex (CcO) in mitochondria (OM, outer membrane of mitochondria) involves
  a pathway via Cox11 for the CuB site of the Cox1 subunit, embedded in the inner
  membrane (IM), and via Sco1 for the CuA site of Cox2, protruding into the intermembrane
  space (IMS). Cox17 supplies both pathways. Nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins,
  such as Cox17 and Ccs1, are imported across the OM unfolded (pale green line) via
  the TOM translocase then captured in the IMS, following introduction of disulfide
  bonds (SS) through the actions of Mia40. A sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 generates a reactive
  disulfide on Mia40. A small copper ligand (CuL) supplies Cu(I) (dashed arrows) to
  the IMS copper metallochaperones.
