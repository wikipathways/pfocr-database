caption: LMW thiols and selenols in biology. (a) Select LMW thiols (SH), all known
  LMW selenols (SeH) formed by specific biosynthetic pathways, and the thio/selenoimidazole
  (TSI) family. LMW thiols are represented in primary and secondary metabolism, with
  tropodithietic acid, 6-thioguanine, gliotoxin, closthioamide, fluopsin C, and methanobactin
  serving as members of the latter group. (b) NHISS-catalyzed C–S/Se bond forming
  reactions involved in the biosynthesis of TSIs
