caption: Outline of the sterol biosynthetic pathway in yeast and comparison of sterol
  structure from yeast, plants, and mammals. (A) Overview of the sterol-specific part
  of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. Essential enzymes are underlined. (B) Comparison
  of the structure of the major sterols from fungi, mammals, and plants. The yeast
  sterol, ergosterol, differs from the mammalian cholesterol by i) the presence of
  a methyl group at position 24, ii) an additional double bond at position 22, and
  iii) an additional double bond at position 7 of the B ring. The plant sterols stigmasterol
  and sitosterol have an ethyl group at position 24, a B-ring configuration as cholesterol
  and the presence (stigmasterol) or absence (sitosterol) of a double bond at position
  22.
