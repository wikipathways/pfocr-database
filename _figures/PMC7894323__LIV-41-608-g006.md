caption: Proposed mechanism of infigratinib and ribociclib in inducing differentiation
  and preventing dedifferentiation. Infigratinib inhibits FGFRs and effectively blocks
  downstream Ras/Raf/Mek and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. This may lead to cell differentiation
  by reducing the expression of stem‐cell‐associated genes through the suppression
  of transcription factors such as SOX9. In addition, infigratinib reduces the expression
  of cell cycle proteins through the reduction in the Rb/E2F pathway. As cells gain
  resistance to infigratinib, cell cycle proteins are upregulated, leading to the
  inactivation of Rb and cell cycle progression. Ribociclib reverses resistance by
  blocking the CDK4/6/pRb axis, resulting in an increase in CYP3A4, albumin and HNF4α
  expression, forcing cells to remain in a differentiated state
papertitle: Ribociclib enhances infigratinib‐induced cancer cell differentiation and
  delays resistance in FGFR‐driven hepatocellular carcinoma.
