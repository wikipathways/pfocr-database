caption: 'Simplified schematic of the cAMP/CREB signaling pathway. Multiple pathways
  are capable of converging to phosphorylate CREB and initiate gene transcription.
  For standard G-protein coupled receptor signaling (GPCR), binding of a ligand such
  as norepinephrine (NE) or acetylcholine (ACh) to its receptor activates the α-subunit,
  which then in turn activates adenylyl cyclase (AC). AC catalyzes the formation of
  cAMP from ATP in an energy dependent manner. Cyclic AMP activates protein kinase
  A (PKA) by binding to the regulatory subunits and relieving auto-inhibition. Once
  activated, the catalytic units of PKA are free to phosphorylate cAMP response-element
  binding-protein (CREB) in the nucleus. Once phosphorylated CREB binds cAMP response
  element (CRE) promoter sites on the DNA. CREB then recruits several co-activator
  proteins (CBP, p300) that have histone-acetyl-transferase activity which loosen
  the DNA, allowing RNA polymerase II to initiate gene transcription for products
  such as brain-derived neurotrophic-factor (BDNF) and certain receptor subunits.
  Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyze cAMP and thus attenuate the effects of cAMP
  downstream. Glutamatergic signaling is also capable of activating the cAMP pathway
  through AMPA and NMDA receptors. Once the NMDA receptor is activated by AMPA induced
  depolarization, binding of glutamate, and expulsion of the magnesium ion, calcium
  flow through the NMDA receptor is capable of activating certain AC isoforms sensitive
  to calcium (I, III, VIII) which results in subsequent phosphorylation of CREB. In
  addition, CREB can also experience glutamatergic- and calcium-mediated phosphorylation
  via the Calmodulin-CamKIV pathway. Lastly, CREB is also capable of being phosphorylated
  via the mitogen-activated protein-kinase (MAPK) pathway which can be activated by
  binding of a trophic factor such as BDNF to its receptor tyrosine kinase b (TrkB).Abbreviations
  : Glutamate (Glu), 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid (AMPA),

  (RAS), ribosomal s6 kinase (RS6), RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), CREB binding protein
  (CBP).'
