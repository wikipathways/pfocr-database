caption: Intrinsic mechanisms of AA and ADA regulation on TCRαβ+ and TCRγδ+ DNT cells
  during NAFLD development. AA and ADA induced apoptosis of TCRαβ+ DNT cells and decreased
  their immunosuppressive function, which were mainly associated with the AKT signaling
  pathway during NAFLD development. AA also facilitated IL17A secretion by TCRγδ+
  DNT cells, which was mainly associated with the NF-κB signaling pathway.
