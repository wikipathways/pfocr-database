caption: 'Mechanisms of MET oncogenic activation. The mechanism of MET carcinogenic
  activation mainly includes gene mutation, gene amplification and fusion, etc. Through
  abnormal activation of MET receptor tyrosine kinase, downstream signaling pathways
  such as RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein
  kinase B and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription are triggered
  to promote cell proliferation, migration and anti-apoptosis. HGF: Hepatocyte growth
  factor'
