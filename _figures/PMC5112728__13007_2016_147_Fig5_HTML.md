caption: Endogenous levels of cytokinins, gibberellins and jasmonates in rice tissues
  at seedling stage, tillering stage, grain-filling stage and mature grain stage.
  The amounts of the hormones are shown as histograms with the SD (n = 3). The y-axis
  is concentration as ng g−1 FW. The x-axis represents the four growth stages. The
  details of each metabolic pathway are described by Hirano et al. []
