caption: Hypothetical model describing the roles of Rad18 and Polκ in the BPDE-induced
  S-phase checkpoint. Replication forks stalled by BPDE-adducted DNA activate the
  ATR/Chk1 pathway. ATR/Chk1 signaling inhibits firing of late origins and also stabilizes
  stalled replication forks. Stabilization of a stalled fork could facilitate PCNA
  ubiquitination and recruitment of TLS polymerases indirectly. Alternatively, Chk1
  signaling could stimulate PCNA ubiquitination directly, perhaps via Rad18 activation.
  Polκ is recruited to monoubiquitinated PCNA at the stalled fork. Polκ-mediated lesion
  bypass enables recovery of the stalled replication fork, and checkpoint signaling
  is attenuated. In the absence of Rad18/Polκ, stalled forks persist and eventually
  collapse, generating secondary forms of damage that activate ATM/Chk2.
