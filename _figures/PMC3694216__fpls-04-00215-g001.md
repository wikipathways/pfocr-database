caption: 'The impact of nitric oxide on salicylic acid, jasmonate (and ethylene signaling
  cascades. Schematic versions of salicylic acid (SA), jasmonate (JA), and ethylene
  (ET) signaling cascade. Biosynthetic enzymes are represented as gray ovals and signaling
  components are gray rectangles. Abbreviations in the jasmonate biosynthetic pathway
  are as follows: LOX, lipoxygenase; AOC, allene oxide cyclase; OPR, oxo-phytodienoate
  reductase; for the ethylene biosynthetic pathway: ACS, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
  acid synthase; ACO, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase. Genes and their
  regulatory promoters are represented as open boxes. For details of signaling cascades,
  see main text. The known NO-regulated steps are indicated: green arrows indicating
  that NO has a promontory effects via induction of gene transcription; S-nitrosylative
  steps are indicated via a solid black bar and whether this promotes (green arrows)
  or inhibit a signaling (red bar) step. Note that for and ACO and ACS4, the effect
  of S-nitrosylation has yet to be determined.'
