caption: Schematic representation of Dox- and AD198-induced apoptosis and chemosensitization
  by inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway with LY294002 in OSCCs in vitro. (A) Dox and
  AD198 treatments of SCC25 cells induced apoptosis through the generation of ROS,
  activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, and downstream activation of the caspase 3/7
  apoptotic pathway. Dox and AD198 increased the activity of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  and ERK1/2 signaling pathway. (B) Upon inhibition of PI3K, neither Dox nor AD198
  induced phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) or ERK1/2. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT induced
  a greater anti-proliferative effect of Dox or AD198 by further increasing the p38
  MAPK pathway and the caspase 3/7 apoptotic pathway.
