caption: The metabolites and genes involving in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway
  under different light intensity treatments in perilla leaves. The blue background
  indicates the major malonylshisonin biosynthetic pathway. The green background indicates
  the major flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. The blue color in the circle indicates
  the level of the metabolite under WL, ML, and RL treatment. The red color in the
  blocks represents the relative expression levels of genes under WL, ML12h, ML6d,
  and RL treatments. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H,
  flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3’H, flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase;
  ANS, anthocyanin synthase (leucoanthocyanin dioxgenase); 3-GT, flavonoid 3-glucosyltransferase;
  ACT, anthocyanin acyltransferase; 5-GT, anthocyanin 5-glucosyltransferase; MAT,
  anthocyanin malonyltransferase.
