caption: DEGs involved in JNK pathway in Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP). Using Agilent microarray
  analysis, compared with WT at 3dpf, it showed that RUNX1-Evi-1 could down-regulate
  some crucial genes in JNK pathway, including c-JUN, ATF-2, Elk-1, and GADD153. MKK7
  is a functional gene in MAPK pathway, which was also down-regulated in this model.
  The signaling pathways were analyzed and summarized by NIH-DAVID software (in KEGG)
  and the differentially expressed genes were marked with red star in the automatically
  generated figure. Western blot was further confirmed that JNK and cleaved p-JNK
  expression were inhibited in Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) F2 generation
