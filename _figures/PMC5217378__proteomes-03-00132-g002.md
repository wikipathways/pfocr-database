  3, Member C), FAM49A (Family With Sequence Similarity 49, Member A), GLOD4 (Glyoxalase
  Domain Containing 4), GORASP2 (Golgi Reassembly Stacking Protein 2, 55kDa), GSDMD
  (Gasdermin D), HEBP1 (Heme Binding Protein 1), HINT2 (Histidine Triad Nucleotide
  Binding Protein 2), HMHA1 (Histocompatibility- Minor-HA-1), MPST (Mercaptopyruvate
  Sulfurtransferase), NAA38 (N-Alpha-Acetyltransferase 38, NatC Auxiliary Subunit),
  NANS (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid Synthase), NCLN (Nicalin), NDUFC2 (NADH Dehydrogenase
