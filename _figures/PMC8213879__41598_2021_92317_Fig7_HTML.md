caption: Metabolic pathways of differentially expressed metabolite mapped in N. sibirica
  leaves under different NaCl concentration treatment. Blue box shows the differentially
  expressed metabolite between different treatments, red oval shows the metabolic
  pathway of differentially expressed metabolite mapped. (A) T100L vs T0L; (B) T400L
  vs T0L; (C) T400L vs T100L.
