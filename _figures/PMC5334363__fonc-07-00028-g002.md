caption: Overview of the molecular pathways involved in autophagy and its impact on
  pancreatic cancer metabolism. Constitutive nuclear import of MiT/TFE proteins by
  importin-8 (IPO8) upregulates the autophagic-lysosomal machinery in pancreatic ductal
  adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (). Autophagy fuels the TCA cycle by amino acid production,
  shifting the usage of glucose from glycolysis to Ser/Gly biosynthesis (). This mechanism
  is further strengthened by pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) secreting alanine upon
  autophagy stimulation by unknown PDAC factors (). Furthermore, the necessity for
  palmitate feeding oxidative phosphorylation is upregulated in PDAC. Citrate, produced
  during the TCA cycle, is used for fatty acid biosynthesis, leading to lipid droplet
  formation and microlipophagy (). This process, together with the macropinocytotic
  uptake of extracellular proteins, amplifies the autophagic system in PDAC (, ).
  Arrows and names in bold mark an upregulated pathway in PDAC.
