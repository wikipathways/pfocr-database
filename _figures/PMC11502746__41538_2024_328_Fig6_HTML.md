caption: a Effects on energy metabolism, showing disruptions in glycolysis, TCA cycle,
  and oxidative phosphorylation. b Effects on Nrf2/GSH axis, depicting activation
  of the Nrf2 pathway and upregulation of GSH levels. c Effects on amino acid catabolism,
  detailing disruptions in arginine biosynthesis and related impacts on the urea cycle
  induced by MGO. Red arrows indicate upregulation, blue arrows indicate downregulation,
  based on integrated omics analyses. Figure created with BioRender.com
