caption: (A) SPOP mutation is an early event in a subtype of prostate cancer associated
  with a high genomic rearrangement frequency. The MAP3K7 and CHD1 proteins are also
  lost when SPOP mutations occur, and are each independently associated with high
  rearrangement frequencies. Based on a clonality model SPOP mutation preceeds MAP3K7
  loss, which preceeds CHD1 loss. The frequency of loss for MAP3K7 (≅30%) is higher
  than that for CHD1 (≅15%) which is higher than the frequency with which SPOP mutation
  occurs (≅10%). (B) SPOP is an enzyme that enables homology-directed DNA repair (HDR)
  of double strand breaks. The substrate protein that is specifically involved in
  modulating repair is unknown. Mutant SPOP fails to promote HDR, and so the less
  stringent and more error prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway becomes
  the favored repair pathway. This results in a high degree of intrachromosomal breaks
  and hence more genomic rearrangements.
