caption: 'Impact of aging on brain glucose metabolism. Glucose (Gluc.), derived from
  nutritional sources, is transported to the brain through the blood flow. After entering
  astrocytes via glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), glucose is either metabolized via
  the glycolytic pathway to form pyruvate (Pyr.) or stored as glycogen. Pyruvate is
  then converted into lactate by the lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5) and, according
  to the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis, transported to neurons via the
  monocarboxylic acid transporters 1, 2, and 4 (MCT1 and 4 at the astrocyte membrane,
  MCT2 at the neuron membrane). Due to the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)-dependent
  inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), astrocytes have only limited oxidative
  phosphorylation (OxPhos) activity and rely on glycolysis for ATP production. Lactate
  entering in neurons is converted to pyruvate via the lactate dehydrogenase 1 (LDH1)
  and enters in the tricyclic acid cycle (TCA), generating substrates for OxPhos and
  ATP production. Glucose can also enter neurons via the glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3).
  However, due to the constant proteasome degradation of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose
  2,6-biphosphatase, isoform 3 (PFKFB3), neurons have low glycolytic capacity. Therefore,
  glucose is mainly metabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to generate
  reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). NADPH is then used
  to produce oxidized antioxidants such as glutathione, which are paramount to regulate
  the reduction/oxidation state in neurons. Of note, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  are by-products of OxPhos activity, which are neutralized by antioxidant defenses
  (e.g., GSH/GSSG system). The red arrows indicate proteins and molecules that are
  impacted (↑ increased/↓ decreased) in brain aging. Abbreviations: 6PG, 6-phos-phogluconate;
