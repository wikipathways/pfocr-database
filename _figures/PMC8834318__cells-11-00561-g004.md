caption: TME involvement in chemoresistance development. Tumor cell-extrinsic influence
  on therapy response can be divided into physical (1) and biological (2) factors.
  HNSCC cells can recruit surrounding fibroblasts (middle section) through TGFβ signaling,
  which induces an activation of the CAF phenotype (2.1). CAFs then further produce
  TGFβ establishing a positive feedback loop between cancer and stromal cells. TGFβ
  pathway activation promotes the deposition of matrix proteins (COL8A1, COL11A1,
  FN, HA) and remodeling enzymes (LOX/LOXL, MMPs), which help to reshape and shift
  the ECM composition. As a result, the matrix becomes stiffer (A), promoting cytoskeletal
  reorganization within HNSCC cells and thus cell–ECM interactions through increased
  FAP and integrin expression. Increased cell–ECM adhesion favors the activation of
  integrin-dependent signaling and mechanosensitive pathways (such as YAP/TAZ), which
  downregulate cell–cell interactions, enhancing motility and the acquisition of an
  EMT-resistant phenotype (B). CAFs can also secrete inflammatory cytokines such as
  IL-6, which can both induce CSC-like properties in HNSCCs (B) and recruit other
  TME populations, such as immune cells. TAMs (2.2) become active in response to proinflammatory
  cytokines to further secrete TGFβ, supporting the activation of this pathway. Together
  with infiltrated T regulatory lymphocytes (2.3), they help to maintain an immunosuppressed
  tumoral microenvironment which is likely to evade immunotherapy (C). Created with
