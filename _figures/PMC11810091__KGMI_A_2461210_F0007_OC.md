caption: Changes in mucosa branched N-glycosylation impacts gut microbial balance,
  leading to an intestinal inflammatory response. In a healthy gut glycocalyx, epithelial
  branched N-glycans sustain commensal gut microbiota composition, contributing to
  the integrity of the epithelial barrier. ILC3 subsets, including LTi-like ILC3 and
  CCR6−NCR−ILC3, promote gut homeostasis through IL-22 release. Short-chain fatty
  acids (SCFAs) produced by commensal microbiota regulate mucosal homeostasis through
  activation of Gpr43/Gp109a signaling pathways or entering cells through Mct1 and
  Smct1 transport. Intestinal epithelial fucosylation (via Fut2 expression) and microbiota
  recognition (through Nod2 expression) also support the symbiotic relationship between
  microbes and the intestinal immune system in homeostasis. During health to intestinal
  inflammation transition, there is an altered host glycome profile, characterized
  by a deficiency in the mucosa expression of complex branched N-glycans and exposure
  of mannose-enriched glycans, perturbing mucosal integrity. This imbalanced glycoenvironment
  leads to a dysbiotic gut microbiota and deficient SCFAs release. Signaling and transport
  of SCFAs is also impaired. Concomitantly, this mucosa glycan switch hampers a protective
  immune response, through decreased frequency of ILC3 subsets, reduction in homeostatic
  cytokines (IL-22 and IL-10) and downregulation of Nod2 and Fut2 expression in the
  intestinal mucosa. An ILC3-ILC1 plasticity occurs imposed by the mucosa glycosylation
  alteration, leading to a pathogenic ILC1 proinflammatory phenotype, with increased
  TNFα and IL-6 production and expression of inhibitory IL-22 binding protein, which
  has the ability to block IL-22. The frequency of dendritic cells (DCs) is also increased
  upon deficiency in Mgat5-mediated branched N-glycans. Taken together, this results
  in a pro-inflammatory environment in the gut and a consequent shift from health
  to inflammation. Prophylactic supplementation with GlcNAc, a key metabolite in the
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, restores the expression of the protective ILC3-IL-22
  module, suppressing health to intestinal inflammation transition. This ultimately
  highlights the beneficial impact of mucosa glycosylation remodeling through nutritional
  intervention in order to promote intestinal homeostasis
