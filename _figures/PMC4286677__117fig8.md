caption: A scheme of interactions hypothesized to connect the receptor protein Draper
  to the execution of the engulfment process. Solid arrows represent connections established
  by previous studies (see Discussion). Shaded arrows highlight the predominant interactions
  indicated in this study of genetic modifiers. The arrow connecting Ced-6/Shark to
  actin is dotted because the results do not distinguish whether the Draper pathway
  affects actin only through the small GTPases or also independently of them. The
  most parsimonious explanation of JNK activity in response to Draper is shown, whereby
  JNK is activated indirectly via changes in the actin cytoskeleton. An additional,
  more direct connection between Draper and Ced-6 or Shark and JNK cannot be excluded.
  The contribution of Yki activity to engulfment, if any, remains uncertain at present.
