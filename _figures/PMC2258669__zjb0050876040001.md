caption: 'Genomic and functional context of glycerate kinase enzymes in bacteria.
  In all panels, matching colors are used to mark components of distinct pathways
  related to glycerate metabolism. (A) Examples of chromosomal clusters containing
  GK-II genes in bacteria. Genes (shown by arrows) from the same metabolic pathway
  are marked by matching colors. Transcriptional regulators are shown in black. The
  species with experimentally characterized pathways and enzymes are underlined. The
  presence of a common regulatory site upstream of the serine degradation genes in
  T. maritima is shown by black dots. (B) Reconstruction of metabolic pathways involving
  d-glycerate. Abbreviations for pathway intermediates (in circles and ovals) are
  given at the top. ENO, enolase. Different metabolic pathways and their respective
  enzymes are denoted by background color arrows and boxes marked by the same matching
  colors. (C) Phylogenetic tree of selected GK-II family proteins in bacteria whose
  biological role was tentatively identified using genome context analysis. Background
  colors reflect chromosomal clustering of GK-II genes with the genes from the respective
  metabolic pathways. Clustering of GK-II with the pyk genes is marked by red lines.
  The branching point of GK-II proteins from eukaryotes and archaea are indicated
  and colored according to their biological roles reported elsewhere. Abbreviations
  for taxonomic groups: α, β, γ, and δ denote alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltaproteobacteria;
  Act., Actinobacteria; T/D, Thermus/Deinococcus group.'
