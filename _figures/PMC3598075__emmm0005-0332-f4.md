caption: Recent discoveries of noncanonical functions of human ARSs and their underlying
  mechanisms. IFN-γ-induced release of EPRS from the MSC and assembly of the GAIT
  complex that mediates translational silencing of inflammation-related mRNAs. UV-triggered
  phosphorylation of MARS inhibits global translation and activates tumour suppressor
  MSC p18. SARS directs transcriptional repression of VEGFA during vertebrate vascular
  development. WARS mediates crosstalk between IFN-γ and p53 signalling pathway to
  activate p53. LARS acts as a leucine sensor in mTORC1 signalling to regulate cell
  size and autophagy. Laminin-stimulated membrane localization of KARS promotes cell
  migration. Human macrophages secret GARS to suppress tumour growth. See details
  in the text.
