caption: Acsl1‐dependent changes in metabolites in the biochemical pathway involving
  cysteine and glutathione metabolism. Metabolite concentrations are identified as
  either increased (red) or decreased (blue) in Acsl1H−/− hearts relative to control
  hearts. Upregulated (yellow) and downregulated (green) genes in this pathway are
  also shown (see Table S1).
