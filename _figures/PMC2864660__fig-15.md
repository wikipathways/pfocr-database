caption: Ganglioside GD3 enhances apoptosis by suppressing the NF-κB–dependent survival
  pathway. Scheme showing NF-κB activation through the classic (A) and the c-Src–dependent
  pathways (B). GD3 is able to inhibit the translocation of the p50/p65–NF-κB subunits
  in both settings, resulting in suppression of NF-κB–dependent gene transcription
  and, thus, enhancing cell death. The classic pathway (A) involves the phosphorylation
  of IκB at serine residues by the IκB kinase complex (formed by NEMO, IKK1, and IKK2),
  followed by IκB-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, allowing translocation
  of the p50/p65–NF-κB subunits to the nuclei. In the noncanonic pathway (B), c-Src
  phosphorylates IκB at tyrosine residues, resulting in its release and in translocation
  of the p50/p65–NF-κB subunits to the nuclei.
