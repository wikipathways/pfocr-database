caption: Ghrelin and the liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) are endogenous
  ligands for GHS-R1a, with ghrelin acting as an agonist and LEAP2 acting as an antagonist.
  GHS-R1a is an αq G-coupled protein receptor that, upon activation, induces the activation
  of several intracellular signaling pathways including the activation and accumulation
  of phospholipase C γ (PLCγ), the activation of β-arrestin, and the accumulation
  of inositol phosphatase 3 kinase (IP3K). Activation of GHS-R1a also results in the
  production of diacylglycerol (DAG), an intracellular signal that in the presence
  of diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) is converted into the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol
  (2-AG). Increased concentrations of PLCγ stimulate the release of Ca+ from the endoplasmic
  reticulum, with higher Ca+ concentrations then facilitating calcium/calmodulin kinase
  (CaCMK)-catalyzed phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase
  (pAMPK). The presence of pAMPK is associated with many of the metabolic effects
  of ghrelin induced GHS-R1a activation. In the absence of ghrelin, GHS-R1a has relatively
  high constitutive activity that can be reduced by treatment with inverse agonists.
  Finally, GHS-R1a stimulation is also associated with increased phosphorylation of
  ERK via the β-arrestin pathway, and increase AKT phosphorylation via increased levels
  of PI3K.
