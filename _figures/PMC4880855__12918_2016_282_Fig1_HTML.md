caption: 'The (simplified) gene regulatory network controlling primary sex determination
  in placental mammals (see Additional file : Figure S1 for the more complete network).
  Ellipsoids and rectangles represent Boolean and multi-valued variables, respectively.
  Black nodes correspond to inputs. Normal green and blunt red arrows represent positive
  and negative interactions, respectively. Y stands for Y chromosome, which contains
  the gene Sry; AS stands for the developmental signal that allows Sry activation;
  AF stands for the developmental signal that activates Foxl2; and IW stands for the
  developmental signal that inhibits the Wnt4 signalling pathway; b-cat stands for
  ß-catenin. Description of these temporal signals is provided in the Additional file'
