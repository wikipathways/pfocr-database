caption: Leptin-induced pathways. The binding of leptin to its receptors (LepR), mainly
  expressed in the hypothalamus, leads to its dimerization and recruitment and auto-phosphorylation
  of Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2). JAK2 subsequently phosphorylates LepR on 3 distinct
  tyrosine residues (Tyr985, Tyr1077 and Tyr1138), facilitating the binding of Src
  Homology 2 (SH2) containing molecules. Depending on the phosphorylated tyrosine,
  different pathways will be activated. Phosphorylation at Tyr985 allows the binding
  of (i) Suppressor Of Cytokine Signalling 3 (SOCS3) inducing negative feedback to
  inhibit JAK2 and (ii) SH2 domain protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) to activate
  Extracellular-signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) pathways. The Tyr1077 permits the phosphorylation
  and activation of Signal Transducer And Activator of Transcript 5 (STAT5) leading
  to gene expression changes. Finally, the Tyr1138 allows the phosphorylation of STAT3
  altering gene expression and activating SOCS3, reinforcing the negative JAK2 feedback.
  Furthermore, the leptin pathway is interconnected with the insulin pathway, since
  JAK2 activation phosphorylates Insulin Receptor (IR) and Substrate (IRS), and subsequently,
  Phosphatidyl Inositol 3 Kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt) leading to the activation
  of Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and also mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal
  S6 kinase (S6K). Together, all these leptin-activated signalling pathways trigger
  energy homeostasis gene regulation, mainly consisting in over-transcription of anorexigenic
  Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and down-transcription of orexigenic Agouti Related
  Protein (Agrp) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) neuropeptides, as well as favouring energy
  expenditure genes, including thermogenic markers.
