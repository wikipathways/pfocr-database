caption: NER-related protein DDB2 in mediating DDR. On UV-induced DNA damage, the
  p53-mediated signaling pathway is activated. The NER protein DDB2 contributes to
  cell survival by the proteasome targeting of p53 and p21 in conditions of low UV-dose-induced
  DNA damage. When the DNA is severely damaged (high UV doses), DDB2 only affects
  p21 degradation, thereby allowing p53 accumulation and the transcription of p53
  apoptotic targets, thus promoting apoptosis. (To see this illustration in color,
  the reader is referred to the web version of this article at www.liebertpub.com/ars.)
