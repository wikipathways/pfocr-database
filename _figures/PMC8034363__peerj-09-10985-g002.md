caption: The numbers beside a node identifies the node. The color of the node and
  the number in square brackets identify the subnet to which the node belongs. The
  square nodes, round nodes, and elliptical nodes represent the orthologous enzymes,
  compounds, and pathways involved in metabolism, respectively. An arrow represents
  a metabolic association relationship. The shaft of the arrow connects the metabolic
  reactant, and the arrowhead connects the metabolites. The solid black line indicates
  the “activated” metabolic behavior, while the solid blue line indicates the “expression”
  metabolic behavior. Moreover, the red dashed line indicates “suppressive” metabolic
  behavior.
