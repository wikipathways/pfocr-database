caption: Small GTPase proteins of the RHO family support multiple behaviours necessary
  for metastasis, including extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, basement membrane
  invasion and cell migration. These proteins are active in their GTP-bound state
  and inactivated by hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. Reactivation is catalysed by
  guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which replace bound GDP with a new molecule
  of GTP. Depletion of GTP by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of inosine monophosphate
  (IMP) dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IMPDH1/2) or GMP synthase (GMPS), or by overexpression
  of GMP reductase (GMPR), inhibits RHO-family GTPase activity by decreasing the GTP-bound
  fraction and blocks cancer metastasis in various animal models. GOF-mut-p53, gain-of-function
  mutant p53; MPA, mycophenolic acid; PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; PurDNP,
  purine de novo pathway; XMP, xanthine monophosphate.
