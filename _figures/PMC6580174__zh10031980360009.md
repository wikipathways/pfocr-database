caption: The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Molecule Activity Predictor algorithm indicated
  that loss of nuclear matrix protein 4 (Nmp4) elevates protein folding and attenuates
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis. Molecules in pink-red are found
  in the data set and are upregulated. Molecules that are green are found in the data
  set and are downregulated. Molecules that are gray are found in the data set but
  did not pass any of the filter parameters originally established for the analysis.
  White molecules are not in the data set but part of the pathway. On the left side
  of this pathway is a heatmap of genes comprising the unfolded protein response pathway
  (UPR) derived from the RNA-seq data of WT and Nmp4−/− mesenchymal stem/progenitor
  cells (MSPCs) at day 3 (uncommitted) and day 7 (early osteogenesis) in culture.
  Red boxes indicate increased expression in the Nmp4−/− cells compared with the WT,
  with greater color saturation indicating higher expression, and green color indicates
  reduced expression. The star indicates Nmp4 binds proximal to the transcription
  start site or within the intron of the gene as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation
  sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis. AMFR, autocrine motility factor receptor; EDEM,
  endoplasmic reticulum-degradation-enhancing-α-mannidose-like protein; ERAD, endoplasmic
