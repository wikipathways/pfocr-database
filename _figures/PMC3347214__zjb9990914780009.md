caption: A schematic model outlining the regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis by
  Hfq in the rhizobacterium P. aeruginosa M18. Thick arrows, positive regulation;
  thick lines with flattened ends, negative regulation; thin arrows, biogenesis and
  transport. Three regulatory pathways of Hfq are (i) the negative regulatory pathway
  of Hfq on Plt production and its biosynthetic gene expression exclusively mediated
  by PltR, (ii) the positive regulatory pathway of Hfq on PCA production and the phz2
  operon expression, and (iii) the negative regulatory pathway of Hfq on PYO production
  and the phzM expression. Ellipses indicate the Hfq-dependent mediators of transcriptional
  regulation. In addition, the plt operon is transcriptionally activated by the LysR-type
  regulator PltR and autoinduced by Plt itself. The ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transport
  system PltHIJKNO is probably responsible for exporting Plt out of the cell (). Three
  important QS systems, Las, Rhl, and PQS, strongly repressed Plt biosynthesis in
  P. aeruginosa M18. The PCA biosynthesis was almost entirely inhibited by the Rhl
  or PQS inactivated mutant and was strongly repressed by the Las system (, , ). Furthermore,
  phzM and its regulatory genes lasI and ptsP were expressed in a temperature-dependent
  manner ().
