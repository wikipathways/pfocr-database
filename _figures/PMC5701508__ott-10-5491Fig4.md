caption: 'JAK–STAT signaling pathway.Notes: (A) Specific ligands bind to membrane
  receptors, leading to dimerization, which promotes JAK activation and transphosphorylation,
  which in turn phosphorylates STAT, prompting its dimerization. STAT dimers enter
  the nucleus and binds to specific DNA sequences, activating gene expression. (B)
  In breast cancer, constitutive activation of certain members of the pathway leads
  to the overexpression of genes that promote growth and apoptosis resistance.'
