caption: Bioenergetic coupling in normal brain. Glycolysis and oxidative metabolism
  via tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are key pathways in maintaining synaptic function.
  Both neurons and astrocytes undergo glycolysis even during aerobic conditions. Glucose,
  which feeds the glycolytic pathway, can enter cells through glucose transporters
  (GLUTs) or be derived from the breakdown of glycogen in astrocytes. Meeting the
  energy demand of neurons is highly reliant on the metabolic coupling of neurons
  to glycolysis and lactate production in astrocytes. There are several key enzymes
  in glycolysis, including hexokinase (HXK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This
  metabolic coupling also requires monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), which rapidly
  transport lactate generated by astrocytes into the extracellular space and into
  neurons. Here lactate is converted back to pyruvate by LDH, which may enter the
  TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation to generate 30–36 molecules of adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP). This net flow of energetic substrates from astrocytes to neurons
  to support neuronal activity is termed the “astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle.”
