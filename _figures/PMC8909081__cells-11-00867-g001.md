caption: 'Similarities in human and animal HFpEF pathophysiology. Metabolic stress
  and hypertensive stress impaired cardiomyocyte functionality. Obesity favors dyslipidemia,
  which leads to NO reduction and finally a reduced PKG activity by the NO-sGC-cAMP
  pathway. Reduced PKG activity is correlated with a decreased N2B phosphorylation.
  On the contrary, PKC activity is increased in HFpEF disease leading to an increased
  phosphorylation state of the titin’s PEVK domain. Moreover, reduced NO bioavailability
  promotes fibroblasts and myofibroblasts proliferation. These latter interact with
  infiltrated macrophages which are linked with the inflammatory state. Indeed, obesity
  favors systemic inflammation with an increased concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α.
  Increased plasma levels of Il-6 and TNF-α impair gene expression as well as the
  correct folding of proteins by the iNOS-IRE1α-XBP1 pathway. Both obesity and diabetes
  comorbidities are linked with insulin resistance, neurohormonal and cytokine imbalance
  affecting the cardiomyocyte environment. Finally, aging alters mitochondrial function
  by increased ROS production. ROS impact on mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial proteins,
  and TCA cycle. Impairment of TCA cycle is also due to the increased mitochondrial
  Ca2+ concentration. Impairment of the TCA cycle leads to an increased Acetyl-CoA
  concentration, due to a decreased expression of mitochondrial deacetylase Sirt3,
  and results in hyperacetylation of mitochondrial proteins. Furthermore, increased
  mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration results in increased PLB activity, which inhibits
  SERCA and promotes cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation, which passes into the mitochondria
  via the MCU. Altogether, these pathways lead to a deterioration of the cardiomyocyte
  state by promoting hypertrophy, stiffness, and diastolic dysfunction. NO: nitric
  oxide, PKG: protein kinase G, sGC: soluble guanylate cyclase, cAMP: cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate, PKC: protein kinase C, PEVK domain: proline-glutamate-valine-lysine
  domain, Il-6: interleukine 6, TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor α, iNOS: inducible nitric
  oxide synthase, IRE1α: inositol requiring endoribonuclease 1α, XBP1: X-box binding
