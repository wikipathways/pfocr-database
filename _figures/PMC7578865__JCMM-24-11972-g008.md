caption: A schematic illustration showing that puerarin has inhibitory effects on
  osteolysis in vivo and RANKL‐induced osteoclast formation in vitro. Puerarin suppressed
  the inflammatory response and maintained balance in the bone environment. In addition,
  puerarin attenuated the upregulation of p65 phosphorylation and the activation of
  the downstream transcription factor NFATc1. Our results showed that puerarin inhibits
  osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the NF‐κB signalling pathway
