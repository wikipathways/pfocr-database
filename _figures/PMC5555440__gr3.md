caption: 'Analysis of different glycolytic fluxes in a production strain. (A) Schematic
  overview of increased flux during mevalonate production and the Cra-dependent response.
  During mevalonate production, a higher flux through glycolysis is expected, resulting
  in higher FBP concentrations, lower Cra activity and, consequently, lower GFP/RFP
  values. Abbreviations: G6P: glucose-6-phosphate, FBP: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate,
  TCA: citric acid cycle, Mev: mevalonate (B) The GFP per RFP ratios obtained by flow
  cytometry in the absence (pZA41) and presence of the mevalonate pathway (pMevT).
  The cells were grown in M9 medium containing 5 g/l glucose. The wild-type (gray)
  and ∆cra strains (blue) were compared (n=3).'
