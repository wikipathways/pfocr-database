caption: Pathways for assimilation of ammonia in B. subtilis (only pathway A) and
  enteric bacteria (pathways A and B). (A) GS/GOGAT cycle. One mole of ammonia is
  assimilated into glutamate for each turn of the cycle (heavy arrows). A portion
  of the glutamine is withdrawn for biosynthesis. Because GS has a high affinity for
  ammonia and ATP hydrolysis is coupled to glutamate synthesis, this pathway operates
  efficiently even at low ammonia concentrations. (B) Biosynthetic glutamate dehydrogenase
  (GDH) pathway. Because GDH has a relatively low affinity for ammonia and the reaction
  it catalyzes is reversible, this pathway operates efficiently only at high ammonia
  concentrations. GS catalyzes synthesis of glutamine from the glutamate generated
  by GDH (not shown).
