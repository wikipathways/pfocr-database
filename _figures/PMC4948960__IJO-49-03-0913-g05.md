caption: '(A) Pathway analysis of network signaling of some of the identified proteins
  as represented in the ingenuity pathway analysis database. The analysis of the identified
  proteins is composed of 2 hematological disease related networks with over 100 associated
  molecules that were merged into one as shown above. The connections and the expression
  profiles of some of the identified proteins are as indicated. Red indicates an upregulated
  protein, and pink color is indicative of downregulation. A direct connection is
  by solid line and broken lines indicate an indirect interaction between different
  molecules. Other molecules outside the identified in this study are in grey color.
  (B) The functional characteristics and disease relatedness of some of the identified
  proteins were mapped in Ingenuity database. The majority of these molecules are
  located mostly in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and extracellular space, while
  only a few are located in the nucleus. Some these molecules functions as enzymes,
  transporters, transcription regulator, or G-protein coupled receptor. Others act
  as kinases, peptidase or growth factor. Furthermore, some of these molecules as
  represented in multiple sub-signaling networks mostly regulate among others: Cell-To-Cell
  Signaling and Interaction, Hematological System Development and Function. Other
  implicated functional annotations include, aggregation of blood cells, coagulation,
  quantity of aggregate cells as well as quantity of granulocytes. [The network analysis
  was done and figure generated in ingenuity pathway analysis program (IPA v8.7)].'
