caption: Isopimaric acid biosynthesis and localization of the participating enzymes.
  a Biosynthetic pathway of isopimaric acid from GGPP. The five enzymatic steps are
  catalyzed by diTPS-ISO and CYP720B4. b Schematic representation of the localization
  of the enzymes involved in the isopimaric acid pathway. DiTPS-ISO is located in
  the chloroplast, where it cyclizes GGPP to isopimaradiene, which is subsequently
  oxygenated by CYP720B4 in the ER. The electrons required by the CYP720B4 (CYP) are
  provided by a P450 oxido-reductase (POR) by oxidizing NADPH. The generic redox cofactor
  of the chloroplast ferredoxin (FD) is also indicated
