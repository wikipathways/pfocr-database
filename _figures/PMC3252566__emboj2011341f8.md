caption: A model for DST-mediated mRNA degradation pathways in plant. In the current
  knowledge, DST-dependent mRNA degradation relies on the presence of a conserved
  DST cis-element present in the 3′-UTR of target transcripts, and on two trans-acting
  factors DST1 and DST2. So far, three independent pathways are known to control the
  entry of DST-containing mRNAs for degradation. The first pathway (named constitutive
  DST pathway) involving the DST mRNA decay mechanism has been shown to constitutively
  degrade the AtSAUR-AC1 transcript, an unstable mRNA. Further genetic insights identified
  a second DST pathway controlling the proper oscillation of the accumulation of the
  circadian-regulated transcript CCL. Therefore, this pathway can be considered as
  a conditional DST pathway since clock is likely a signal controlling CCL half-life
  modulation. Finally, the present report demonstrates that the major ferritin transcript
  AtFER1 is processed only under oxidative stress conditions. In this third pathway
  (named oxDST pathway), Fe activates the entry of AtFER1 mRNA in the degradation
  pathway through ROS and the process involves an unstable protein. H2O2 also modulates
  AtFER1 decay, suggesting that not only Fe can promote this ROS-mediated AtFER1 decay.
  However, H2O2 can be produced in response to Fe through the Fenton reaction, or
  may trigger AtFER1 destabilization by an alternative pathway. Thus, the H2O2-mediated
  degradation of AtFER1 through the oxDST pathway is more hypothetical at that time
  (grey arrows). In addition to AtFER1, this study also revealed ANAC102 and WRKY18
  as two other potential direct targets of the oxDST pathway. However, the direct
  link between their decay modulation and the DST factors remains to be investigated
  (grey labelling). In the present model, the pathways are distinct beside a common
  dependence regarding DST1 and DST2 factors. In one hand, AtSAUR-AC1 is constantly
  destabilized and its decay is not affected by iron. On the other hand, AtFER1 is
  clock regulated but independently to the DST factors. Thus, several DST pathways
  can be distinguished. In regard to the differential involvement of DST1 and DST2
  depending on the transcript and the pathway considered, it appears that DST factors
  likely act as components of a selective machinery for mRNA degradation, in which
  they would be involved separately or collectively.
