caption: A schematic representation of the proposed pathway responsible for CDM combined
  with ASA in AML-MDS cells. (A) The predictive pathways of CDM and ASA in AML-MDS
  through network pharmacology. (B) CDM combined with ASA could inhibited the activation
  of PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, and then affected the expression of cell cycle and
  apoptosis-related proteins to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in AML-MDS
  cells through experimental validation.
