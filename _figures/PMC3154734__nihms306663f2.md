caption: The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER and/or liberation of BiP
  from IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, activate a series of down-stream events. IRE1 induces
  the splicing of the XBP-1 message, which is then translated into an active transcription
  factor. There are actually two isoforms of IRE1 (α and β) but for simplicity only
  a single, generic protein is depicted. PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, which inhibits
  general protein synthesis but the ATF4 transcription factor can still be translated
  because of the presence of a short, upstream ORF that is skipped when eIF2α is phosphorylated.
  In contrast, ATF6, when activated, is released from the ER and migrates to the Golgi
  where it is clipped, thus releasing an active transcription factor, ATF6-p50. The
  immediate effects of UPR induction help the ER cope with an increase in the concentration
  of misfolded proteins. However, prolonged UPR induction triggers apoptosis through
  the ATF4-dependent transcription of the CHOP/Gadd153 transcription factor. CHOP
  both increases the expression of pro-apoptotic genes and inhibits the expression
  of Bcl2, an antiapoptotic protein.
