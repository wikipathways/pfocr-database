caption: 'Protein ubiquitination, ubiquitin chains, proteasomal and aggresome-autophagy
  degradation. Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small, 76 amino acid protein present in all eukaryotic
  cells that plays a key role in the cellular defense mechanism by functioning as
  a proteolytic signal for the proteasome. The process of covalent Ub attachment to
  target proteins is called ubiquitination (also known as ubiquitylation). This post-translational
  modification forms by an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of Ub and
  a lysine residue on the target protein. First, Ub is covalently conjugated to the
  E1 (Ub-activating enzyme) in an active ATP-dependent reaction and transferred to
  the E2 (Ub-conjugating enzyme). The E3 (Ub–protein ligase) transfers the Ub from
  E2 to the target protein and determines the specificity. A monoubiquitinated protein
  can have the Ub chain elongated by E3 that creates Ub–Ub isopeptide bonds. Chain
  extension can happen through seven lysine (K) residues on Ub: K6, K11, K27, K29,
  K33, K48 and K63. Proteasomes recognize K48 chains leading to target protein degradation
  (upper part). Other lysine chains are involved in different biological functions.
  K63 chains do not specify degradation but usually facilitate the recruitment of
  other proteins in the formation of functional complexes involved in cellular signaling
  such as aggresome formation (lower part). HDAC6 can bind misfolded proteins entangled
  with Ub K63 chains and bridges to dynein motors, mediating transport to and formation
  of the aggresome compartment. Free poly-Ub chains, referred to as unanchored Ub
  chains, have been found in virus particles. Unanchored poly-Ub chains arise when
  a deubiquitinase (DUB) removes an intact chain from a protein, or they can be generated
  through E1/E2/E3 cycles. They can be recognized by HDAC6 and activate the aggresome
  pathway as well IAV capsid uncoating. Ub Protein Data Bank (PDB): 1UBI; NH2 and
  COOH termini are labeled N and C, respectively. HDAC6 zinc finger (ZnF) and catalytic
  domain (CD) PDB: 3C5K and 5G0I, respectively.'
