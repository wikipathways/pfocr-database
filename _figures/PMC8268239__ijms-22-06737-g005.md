caption: 'A mechanistic approach of potential targets for the treatment of Parkinson’s
  disorder (PD). The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is initiated by genetic
  mutations, aging, chemicals, etc., via mitochondrial dysfunction, which intervenes
  with ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and α-synuclein, resulting in the production
  of Lewy bodies. These further interfere with activation of microglial cells resulting
  in neuroinflammation and cell death. Calcium influx stimulates mitochondrial dysfunction,
  which further stimulates protein Abelson (c-Abl), further stimulating Parkin, followed
  by UPS dysfunction, PGC1, F16BP, and AIMP2. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also stimulated
  by glucocerebrosidase-1 (GBA-1), which elevated ER stress and aids in formation
  of neuromelanin pigments, resulting in neurodegeneration and cell death. Kynurenine
  is transformed to quinolic acid, stimulating tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and ROS,
  where the former blocks dopamine (DA) synthesis by hindering the enzymes, tyrosine
  hydroxylase (TH), and phenylalanine hydroxylase (PHA). Cocaine–amphetamine regulated
  transcript (CART) provides neuroprotection by protecting DA neuron. Chaperone binds
  to α-synuclein and blocks activation of microglia, production of Lewy bodies and
  UPS dysfunction, ameliorating production of proinflammatory cytokines, preventing
  cell death. Legend: PD—Parkinson’s disease, ROS—reactive oxygen species, UPS—ubiquitin
  proteasome system, c-Abl—protein Abelson, GBA-1—glucocerebrosidase, BH4—tetrahydrobiopterin,
  TH—tyrosine hydroxylase, PHA—phenylalanine hydroxylase, CART—cocaine–amphetamine
  regulated transcript, DA—dopamine, MPTP—1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine,
  OS—oxidative stress, Ca2+—calcium ions, PGC-1—peroxisome proliferator-activated

  protein 2, TNF-α—tumor necrosis factor, IL—interleukins, ER—endoplasmic reticulum,
