caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in drug resistance in cholangiocarcinoma. (A)
  Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway in drug resistance in cholangiocarcinoma: Wnt binds
  to its receptor-Frizzled to activate Dsh protein, which phosphorylate and inactivate
  GSK3β, facilitating the translocation of free and unphosphorylated β-catenin from
  the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where β-catenin binds to TCF/LEF to promote MDR1 expression.
  (B) Notch signal pathway in drug resistance in cholangiocarcinoma: After Notch activation,
  γ-secretase (Presenilin and Nicastrin) cleaves Notch COOH-terminal fragment. NICD,
  released into the cytoplasm, further translocate to the nucleus, where NICD interact
  with SKIP and CSL, leading to SMRT/HDACs dissociation and converting CSL to a transcriptional
  activator to initiate the expression of ABCC1, MRP1 and Sox9, which can further
  promote the expression of ABCB1 and ABCC4. (C) NF-kB signaling pathway in drug resistance
  in cholangiocarcinoma: NF-kB translocate into the nuclear to initiate the expression
  of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2.'
