caption: Astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle. Glucose can directly be transported into
  neurons and then converted into pyruvate via glycolysis. Alternatively, glucose
  can be transported into astrocytes, or astrocytes can mobilize stored glycogen as
  an endogenous source for glucose. Astrocytes convert glucose into lactate by lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDH). Lactate is then released into the extracellular space and taken
  up into neurons, which convert lactate into pyruvate. This alternative pathway constitutes
  the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle. Ketogenic diet therapy decreases glucose and
  increases ketones, which are transported into neurons and bypass glycolysis and
  thereby directly enter the neuronal TCA cycle.
