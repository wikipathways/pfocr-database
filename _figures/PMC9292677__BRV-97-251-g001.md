caption: 'Role of sphingosine kinase (SPHK)‐mediated sphingosine 1‐phosphate (S1P)
  signalling in organ morphogenesis. (A) Extracellular mode: activation of SPHK1 by
  hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), nitric oxide (NO), LIM‐domain only 2 (Lmo2) and
  tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) promotes S1P generation and subsequent export via
  transporters. Extracelluar S1P elicits signals through S1P receptors (S1PRs) to
  stimulate cell migration, stabilize cell adhesion and inhibit cell apoptosis. These
  cellular events are involved in organ morphogenesis including angiogenesis, bone
  morphogenesis, neurogenesis and heart development. Akt, protein kinase B; ERK, extracellular
  signal‐regulated kinase; JNK, c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase; NF‐κB, nuclear factor kappa
  light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3‐kinase; SAPK,
  stress‐activated protein kinase. (B) Intracellular mode: S1P binds to intracellular
  targets in different cellular compartments. In the cytoplasm, SPHK1‐generated S1P
  directly binds to the E3 ligases TNF receptor‐associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and cIAP2,
  promotes receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and interferon regulatory factor
  1 (IRF1) polyubiquitination, and activates the NF‐κB pathway and IRF1‐responsive
  genes, respectively. Upon endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress the S1P–TRAF2–RIP1 complex
  can associate with the stress‐responsive proteins, heat shock protein 90α (HSP90α),
  heat shock protein 90β family member 1 (GRP94) and ER to nucleus signalling 1α (IRE1α).
  S1P also binds with atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), β‐site amyloid precursor protein
  cleaving enzyme‐1 (BACE1) and peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ (PPARγ)
  to protect the cell from apoptosis, to stimulate amyloid‐β peptide (Aβ) production
  (the main cause of Alzheimer''s disease) and to promote tube formation in angiogenesis,
  respectively. In the nucleus, SPHK2‐generated S1P forms a co‐repressor complex with
  histone deacetylases (HDACs) and reduces HDAC activity. Reduced HDAC activity increases
  histone acetylation and regulates gene expression. S1P binding to nuclear human
  telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) contributes to inhibition of telomere damage
  and senescence, thus promoting cell proliferation. In mitochondria, SPHK2‐generated
  S1P binds to prohibitin 2 (PHB2) to regulate respiration, cardioprotection, ER stress
  and apoptosis. IL‐1, interleukin 1; Ub, ubiquitin. (C) Vesicular trafficking: SPHK1
  regulates membrane trafficking. Upon activation, SPHK1 targets to endocytic tubular
  invagination and Ras‐related protein (Rab5)‐positive endosomes. SPHK1/S1P‐mediated
  endocytic trafficking also converges with autophagy. SPHK1 enhances autophagy biogenesis
  and function, and autophagy, in turn, stimulates SPHK1 re‐localization to the endosome/autophagosome.
  SPHK1 is also localized to the membrane in a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (GAR‐3)‐induced
  calcium signalling‐dependent manner for release of acetylcholine. Gq, heterotrimeric
  G protein alpha subunit; TrioGEF, triple functional domain protein guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor.'
