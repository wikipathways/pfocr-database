caption: Schematic diagram of the interaction between TGF-β/SMAD4 signaling pathway
  and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), PI3K/AKT (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/AKT)
  and WNT/β-catenin pathways. The canonical TGF-β/SMAD4 signal initiates from the
  TGF-β ligand activation and its binding to the type II and I receptors (T-βR II
  and T-βR I), which then phosphorylates SMAD2/3. The phosphorylated SMAD2/3 form
  a heterodimeric complex with SMAD4 and translocate to the nucleus and bind to SBE
  directly and regulate target genes transcription with the help of transcriptional
  factors. These target genes are mainly involved in growth arrest and apoptosis.
  (A) RAS/RAF/ERK1/2 axis regulates the TGF-β/SMAD4 pathway by (1) phosphorylating
  SMAD2 and SMAD3 to prevent its translocation into the nucleus; (2) mediating SMAD4
  degradation; and (3) promoting AP-1 complex formation at the TGF-β1 promoter, thus
  boost the TGF-β1 transcription and secretion. As the substrate of JNK, c-Jun can
  directly bind to the transcriptional corepressor TG-interacting factor (TGIF) to
  inhibit SMAD2 dependent transcription. P38 can phosphorylate SMAD binding partners,
  such as activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), in nucleus and therefore facilitates
  TGF-β/SMAD4 induced genes transcription. (B) PI3K/AKT pathway suppresses the T-βR
  I mediated SMAD3 phosphorylation through its downstream molecule mTOR. AKT can directly
  phosphorylate FOXO and keep it in the cytoplasm to prevent its binding to the promoter
  of p27 and p21, thus blocks the TGF-β/SMAD4 mediated cytostatic signals. (C) β-catenin
  destruction complex consisting of AXIN, APC, GSK3β and CKIα causes SMAD7 ubiquitination
  and degradation. And in turn, SMAD7 can disassemble the complex by binding to AXIN,
  hence stablize β-catenin and promote its nucleus translocation.
