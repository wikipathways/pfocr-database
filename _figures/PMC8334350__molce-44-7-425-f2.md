caption: (A) DAF-16/forkhead box O (FOXO) is activated by genetic inhibition of EFL-1/E2F1
  while being inhibited by mutations in ercc-1/Ercc1. Activated DAF-16/FOXO delays
  aging by increasing target gene expression. (B) Reduced mechanistic target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) signaling by genetic inhibition or treatment with rapamycin activates adenosine
  5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via downregulating RSKS-1/S6K1
  and upregulates SKN-1/Nrf to induce protective genes, leading to longevity. (C)
  Kallistatin downregulates miR-34a leading to the activation of SIR-2.1/SIRT1 to
  delay aging. Increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels also delay
  aging through upregulation of SIR-2.1/SIRT1.
