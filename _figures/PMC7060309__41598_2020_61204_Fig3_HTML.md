caption: Global view of differently expressed genes (DEGs) involved in diverse metabolic
  pathways. DEGs genes were selected for the metabolic pathway analysis using the
  MapMan software (3.5.1 R2). The colored boxes indicate the Log2 of expression ratio
  of DEGs genes. The dys-regulated unigenes were assigned to 1,595 and 2,328 homologs
  in Arabidopsis, respectively. These genes were mapped to 905 pathways by MapMan,
  of which, 55 pathways were filtered enriched by the dys-regulated genes with the
  cutoff p-value <0.05.
