caption: Signaling pathway how PERK activation affects Akt-activation and synaptic
  function. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) activates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,
  whichin turn phosphorylates PERK and subsequently induces GADD34 expression by triggering
  ATF4. GADD34 interacts with an E3 ligase TRAF6 can interact with Akt to facilitate
  the phosphorylation of Akt at T308. The interaction between GADD34 and TRAF6 prevents
  the interaction between TRAF6 and Akt, and as a result, the phosphorylation of Akt
  was decreased significantly after TBI. Since Akt is essential for cell survival,
  the decrease in its phosphorylation leadsto its inactivation and induces neuronal
  death and synaptic dysfunction after TBI.
