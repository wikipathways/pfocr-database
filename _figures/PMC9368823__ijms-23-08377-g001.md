caption: (A) Diagrammatic representation of WNT/β-catenin pathway. APC and axin recruited
  β-catenin, and after sequential phosphorylations of specified amino acid residues
  in amino-terminal region, β-catenin is poly-ubiquitinated by β-TrCP and tagged for
  degradation by the proteasomal machinery. (B,C) β-catenin transcriptionally repressed
  FOXA2. FOXA2 stimulated the expression of lncRNA-NEF. LncRNA-NEF interacted physically
  with β-catenin and increased the binding of GSK3β with β-catenin and facilitated
  phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin by proteasomal machinery. (D) Baicalein
  also promoted GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin and subsequent degradation.
  (E) SNHG1 antagonized miR-3127-5p-mediated targeting of FZD4.
