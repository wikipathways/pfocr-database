caption: 'Short-term response to oxidative stress. The initial response to oxidative
  stress primarily relies on the activity of antioxidant molecules, which donate electrons
  to ROS to reduce the oxidative state. To continue functioning as antioxidants, these
  molecules must be replenished, by receiving electrons from NADPH. ROS, through the
  oxidation of cysteine residues on the ATM protein, leads to increased ATM activity.
  In turn, ATM activates the G6PD enzyme, which enhances the production of NADPH from
  NADP+. This process has two immediate consequences: the generation of more NADPH
  and the redirection of glucose-6-phosphate from oxidative phosphorylation in the
  mitochondria to the nucleotide synthesis pathway. Consequently, this results in
  reduced ROS production. Additionally, ROS has a direct impact on mitochondria by
  oxidizing cysteine residues in complexes I, III, and IV, leading to decreased oxidative
  phosphorylation. ROS: Reactive oxygen species; NADPH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; ATM: Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated; G6PD: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  NADP+: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate'
