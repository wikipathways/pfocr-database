caption: Regulation of TFEB nuclear export by mTORC1 and GSK-3β. Studies have shown
  that phosphorylation of TFEB at ser142 by mTORC1 and ERK primes TFEB for phosphorylation
  at ser138 by GSK-3β (panels 1–2) [,]. Phosphorylation of TFEB at ser142 and ser138
  facilitates the interaction of CRM1 and TFEB (panel 3), which leads to the translocation
  of TFEB from nucleus to cytosol (panel 4) [].
