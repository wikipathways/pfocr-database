caption: Regulation of miRNA with innate immune cells in cancer. In breast cancer,
  innate immune cells including tumor necrosis factor, transforming growth factor,
  interleukins and B cells are involved in regulation of miRNA in which their pathways
  are interrupted by tumor suppressor miRNAs to prevent further tumor metastasis.
  In contrast, oncogenic MiR-21 is involved in the mechanism by targeting B cell lymphoma,
  leading to abnormal cell accumulation and suppression of apoptosis
