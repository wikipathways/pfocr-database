caption: Inhibition of stemness by PTs. Lupane-type PT BA inhibits stem cell proliferation
  by interfering with Skp2-SCF-dependent degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase
  inhibitor p27. Oleanane-type PT β-escin suppresses the activity of ALDH1A1 and the
  downstream AKT pathway, which is thought to regulate the CSC transcriptome through
  the β-catenin pathway. The anti-stem cell activity of ursane-type PT UA is mediated
  through the EGFR pathway. Downward (↓) and upward (↑) arrows indicate downregulation
  and upregulation of expression, respectively
