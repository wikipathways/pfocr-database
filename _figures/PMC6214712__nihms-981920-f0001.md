caption: Studies over the past two decades have identified mitotic gene bookmarking
  as a broadly relevant epigenetic mechanism to coordinate cell proliferation, growth
  and identity in progeny cells. Several regulatory proteins and transcription factors
  involved in key cellular processes have been identified to bookmark target genes
  for post-mitotic reactivation/regulation. (A) A simplified representation of the
  differentiation potential of pluripotent stem cells. Only those lineages are shown
  for which a “master” phenotypic regulator has been identified to bookmark target
  genes in mitosis (labelled in red). In addition, recent findings demonstrate that
  key pluripotent transcription factors that include SOX2 and KLF4 mitotically bookmark
  genes in pluripotent stem cells. (B) Select signalling pathways, each involved in
  and essential for cell proliferation, growth and differentiation, are depicted.
  Dashed arrows represent multiple steps that are not shown for simplicity. For each
  pathway, downstream effectors that mitotically bookmark genes are shown in red (e.g.,
  FOXL1, RBPJ, REX, and FISF2). (C) Accruing evidence has established key properties
  of chromatin of mitotically bookmark genes. Shown here are chromatin architectural
  proteins, cohesin (blue ring) and CTCF (red triangles), histone variants H3.3 and
  FI2A.Z, as well as chromatin regulators that mediate histone acetylation (e.g.,
  p300), deposit methyl moieties on nucleosomal histones (e.g., MLL complex), methylate
  DNA (e.g., DNMT1), and facilitate nucleosome remodelling (e.g., lSWl).
