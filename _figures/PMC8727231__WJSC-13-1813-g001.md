caption: 'The stem cell secretome. After the interaction between host angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the spike S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2, the membrane is fused, and the viral genome is released into the
  cell or the virus enters the cell by clathrin-dependent/independent endocytosis.
  Most of the cells in human organs including the intestine, heart, kidney, and alveolar
  type II (AT2) cells of the lungs express ACE2 receptors. Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase
  inhibitor (EMMPRIN or CD147) and two proteases transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)
  are required for virus entry into the host cell. The lungs are damaged after direct
  destruction of capillary endothelial cells and AT2, the renin-angiotensin system
  is disrupted or the immune response is diminished indirectly. Following virus-induced
  infection, pathogen-associated molecular patterns lead to recognition of the virus
  by the innate immune system, activation of nuclear factor-κappa B and IRF3 pathways,
  type I interferon (IFN) expression and consequently activation of the JAK/STAT pathway
  and finally the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) which have anti-viral activity.
  The abovementioned effective immune response is required for successful virus clearance
  and clinical disappearance of the disease. Nonetheless, the IFN response may be
  delayed due to evasion of IFN and ISG mediated killing by the virus which in turns
  leads to hyper-inflammatory neutrophils and macrophage infiltration at the pulmonary
  site accompanied by pro-inflammatory cytokines including granulocyte-colony stimulating
  factor, tumor necrosis factor, MCP1, and interleukin-1b/2/6/7/8/17[]. This hyper-activation
  of T lymphocytes and the innate response is called the ‘cytokine storm’ and is responsible
  for lung disorders including acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonitis, viral
  sepsis, respiratory and organ failure. A high number of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  leads to hyaluronan synthase 2 induction which elevates hyaluronan production and
  fluid accumulation in the lungs[]. In critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019,
  the virus enters the peripheral blood and translocates to various target organs
  including kidney, heart, and intestine and can cause multiple organ failure. ACE2:
