caption: Parallel pathways synchronize peripheral clocks to the LD cycle. Light is
  the most important zeitgeber for circadian clocks and can reach peripheral clocks
  via several routes. In pathway 1, light from the retina reaches the SCN through
  the retino‐hypothalamic tract and entrains the SCN clock that then transmits the
  timing information to peripheral clocks along neuronal and/or endocrine pathways.
  Pathway 2 depicts additional routes for transmission of photic information that
  bypass the SCN clock and directly or indirectly reset peripheral clocks.

  peripheral clocks independently of the SCN clock.'
