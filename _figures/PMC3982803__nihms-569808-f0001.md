caption: Insulin signaling pathways that control gluconeogenesis. (a) The canonical
  insulin receptor (IR)-IRS-PI3K-PDPK1-AKT signaling pathway regulates gluconeogenesis
  by inhibiting the transcription factor FoxO1 and the transcriptional regulatory
  CREB-CBP-CRTC2 complex. After feeding, insulin receptor–IRS-PI3K-PDPK1-AKT signaling
  is stimulated (green), which phosphorylates and inactivates FoxO1 and the CREB-CBP-CRTC2
  complex, thus suppressing the expression of gluconeogenic genes (encoding PEPCK
  and G6Pase) (gray). During fasting, insulin receptor–IRS-PI3K-PDPK1-AKT signaling
  is less active than in feeding (gray), thus turning on the activities of FoxO1,
  the CREB-CBP-CRTC2 complex and gluconeogenesis (green). The P in the yellow circles
  denotes activating phosphorylation, and the P in the red circles denotes inhibitory
  phosphorylation. (b) Lu et al. suggest the existence of a hypothetical non-canonical
  pathway by which insulin controls gluconeogenesis. They suggest that the non-canonical
  pathway, which has yet to be identified, suppresses gluconeogenesis in parallel
  with the canonical pathway during feeding; however, activated FoxO1 during fasting
  or insulin resistance dampens the non-canonical pathway and stimulates the expression
  of gluconeogenic genes and glucose production. A comparison of TLKO mice and LTKOIRS
  mice implied that the divergent point of the non-canonical pathway from the canonical
  pathway could reside between IRS and AKT. (c) The PDPK1-aPKCl signaling cascade
  may be a potential candidate accounting for the non-canonical pathway. In response
  to insulin or stimuli after feeding, insulin receptor–IRS-PI3K-PDPK1 signaling activates
  aPKCλ, which, in turn, phosphorylates CBP and disrupts the CREB-CBP-CRTC2 complex
  and suppresses gluconeogenesis. However, in DLKO or TLKO mice, this pathway could
  remain active and contribute to the postprandial response.
