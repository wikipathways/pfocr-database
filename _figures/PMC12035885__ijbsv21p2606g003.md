caption: Main metabolites in the TME of breast cancer that affect NK cell function.
  a) IDO catalyzes the degradation of Trp into L-Kyn, subsequently downregulating
  the expression of the NK cell activation receptors NKG2D and NKp46. Additionally,
  IDO upregulates HLA-G expression, thereby diminishing NK cell functionality. b)
  In DNA-damaged tumor cells, uric acid activates the TAK1/NF-κB/ERK signaling pathway,
  ultimately resulting in the upregulation of NKG2D ligands (MICA/B) and enhancement
  of antitumor immune responses. c) ADO exerts immunosuppressive effects by engaging
  ADO receptors on NK cells. d) Disruptions in serine-sphingomyelin metabolism hinder
  synapse formation on NK cell membranes, compromising the tumor cell recognition
  and elimination capabilities of NK cells
