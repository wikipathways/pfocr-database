caption: The E. coli chemotaxis pathway depicted as a two state signaling system.
  Receptor/CheW/CheA complexes are shown in kinase-stimulating (green/magenta/green)
  and kinase-inhibiting (red/magenta/gray) states. The binding of attractant (filled
  triangles) inhibits the CheA kinase (gray A dimer) and stimulates the receptor methylation
  (black circles) via CheR (green R). Methylated receptors stimulate CheA (green A
  dimer). The two substrates of CheA, CheY (Y) and the methylesterase (B), are activated
  by phosphorylation (yellow). CheY-phosphate (green Y) propagates the tumble signal
  and CheB-phosphate (red B) provides negative feedback by demethylating (and deactivating)
  receptors. CheB dephosphorylates spontaneously. CheZ (blue Z dimer) dephosphorylates
  CheY-phosphate. Two features not represented in the figure are the packing of receptor
  dimers into hexagonal arrays with CheA and CheW, and the unknown receptor:CheA:CheW
  stoichiometry.
