caption: Model for APP trafficking in Aβ40 production. (A) For APP to be cleaved efficiently
  into Aβ40 in the TGN, newly synthesized APP (red) at the ER first traffics along
  the secretory pathway via the TGN to the plasma membrane. (B) APP is then internalized
  via endocytosis to reach early endosomes. (C) Next, the endocytic pool of APP (purple)
  is recycled to the TGN in a retromer-dependent manner, where Aβ is produced. (D)
  The biosynthetic pool of APP (red) in the TGN can also traffic directly to endosomes
  in a process mediated by the AP-4 complex (C) and be retrieved back to the TGN in
  a retromer-dependent manner for Aβ production.
