caption: ER stress signaling pathway was regulated by vancomycin in HK-2 cells. HK-2
  cells were treated with 50 μg/mL vancomycin for 24 h and the protein samples were
  subject to quantitative proteomic analysis. Green indicates a down-regulation. The
  intensity of green color indicates the degree of down-regulation. Solid arrow indicates
  direct interaction.
