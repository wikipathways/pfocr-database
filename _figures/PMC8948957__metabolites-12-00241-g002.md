caption: 'Accumulation of intermediates and their de-/phosphorylated forms along the
  PDNS pathway due to individual defects of enzymes. Enzyme defects are shown by a
  double red line across a particular reaction of the pathway. For a given metabolite,
  the blue/red color of a box represents decreased/increased level of the deficient
  cell line compared to controls according to ln (fold change), while the shade reflects
  −log10 (p-value) with a lighter/darker color for a statistically less/more significant
  difference (based on a t-test). Abbreviations: phosphoribosylamine (PRA), glycinamideribonucleotide
  (GAR), N-formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR), diphosphate form of FGAR (FGAr-2P),
  triphosphate form of FGAR (FGAr-3P), N-formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAMR),
  aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR), carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR),
  N-succinocarboxamide-5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (SAICAR), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
  ribonucleotide (AICAR), triphosphate form of AICAR (AICAr-3P), 5-formamido-4-imidazolecarboxamide
  ribonucleotide (FAICAR), inosine-5-monophosphate (IMP), glutamine (Gln), glutamate
  (Glu), pyrophosphate (PPi), adenosine-5-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine-5-diphosphate
  (ADP), glycine (Gly), phosphate (Pi), N10-formyl tetrahydrofolate (N10-formyl THF),
  tetrahydrofolate (THF), hydrogen carbonic acid (HCO3−), aspartate (Asp). Riboside
  forms of PDNS intermediates are marked with small letter r. Enzyme abbreviations
  are described in the second paragraph of the Introduction.'
