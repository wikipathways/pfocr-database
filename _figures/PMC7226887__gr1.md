caption: Role of PTEN in the control of cell signaling. PTEN coordinates cell growth,
  survival, proliferation, and metabolism by opposing activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. Two isoforms of canonical PTEN have been identified, PTEN-Long (PTEN-L)
  and PTEN-β. PTEN- L is a membrane-permeable lipid phosphatase that is secreted from
  cells and can be taken up by other cells directly. PTEN-L is also localized in the
  mitochondrial and can regulate mitochondrial functions and energy production by
  associating with canonical PTEN to increase PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)
  expression. PTEN-β localized in the nucleolus negatively regulates ribosomal DNA
  transcription and ribosomal biogenesis by physically interacting with and dephosphorylating
  nucleolin. Canonical PTEN can also be secreted and taken up by other cells, which
  together with PTEN-L secretion, contributes to the non-cell autonomous effects of
  PTEN [].
