caption: MiTF in osteoclast differentiation. MiTF is induced during osteoclastogenesis
  by both M-CSF, the cytokine responsible for the proliferation of osteoclast progenitors
  and their commitment towards an osteoclast fate, and RANKL, which induces the differentiation
  of osteoclasts through RANK signalling. M-CSF induces MiTF through the MAPK/ERK
  pathway, while RANKL signalling acts through the TAK1/p38 MAPK pathway. In parallel,
  RANKL also induces the expression of NFATc1, the other transcription factor essential
  for osteoclast differentiation. The MITF-PU.1 complex interacts with NFATc1 at osteoclast
  target gene promoters to initiate and maintain the expression of target genes. These
  genes encode markers of osteoclast differentiation, transmembrane proteins involved
  in the fusion of osteoclast precursors and enzymes involved in bone resorption
