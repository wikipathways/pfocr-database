caption: Hypothesized pathology of methionine deficiency in ileum mucosal immunity,
  and the latent pathway of liver and kidney injury. Methionine, an important methyl
  donor and source of sulfur, might influence protein synthesis and affect intestinal
  immunity. Under methionine deficiency, IELs and LPLs and submucosal T- and B-cell
  subsets were suppressed, which could be partially responsible for decreased levels
  of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, LITAF, and IFN-γ. These phenomena contribute
  to ileum mucosal immunosuppression. As intestinal immunity plays a central role
  in the gut–liver–kidney axis, uncontrolled harmful bacteria might lead to abnormal
  liver and kidney function due to secretion of endotoxins. IELs, intraepithelial
  lymphocytes; LPLs, lamina propria lymphocytes.
