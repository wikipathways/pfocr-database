caption: The molecular targets of flavonoids in TRAIL apoptosis pathway and the hypothetic
  impact of EEP in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in cancer cell. TRAIL binds to death receptors,
  TRAIL-R1 and/or TRAIL-R2 and promotes the recruitment of adapter molecule FADD (Fas-associated-death
  domain) to activate caspase-8, which trigger activation of downstream effector caspases
  (caspase-3, -6 and -7). Caspase-8 mediated also cleavage of Bid (BH3-interacting
  domain death agonist). Trucated Bid called tBid translocates to the mitochondria
  where it interacts with Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) and Bak (Bcl-2-agonist/killer),
  stimulating the release oh cytochrome c. Antiapoptotic members of Bcl-2 family could
  inhibit cytochrome c release. Cytochrome c liberated from the mitochondria then
  binds to the adaptor protein APAF-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor-1) and
  procaspase-9, forming the apoptosome and activating caspase-9, which in turn activates
  executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6 and -7) leading to cell death. Caspase-9 activity
  is controlled by IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) and survivin. Luteolin, apigenin,
  kaempferol, quercetin and baicalein increase expression of death receptor TRAIL-R2.
  Apigenin activate executioner caspases and block antiapoptotic Bcl-2 action. Quercetin
  promotes apoptosis by inhibition of survivin.
