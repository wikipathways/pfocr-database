caption: The insulin signaling pathways of mammals, D. melanogaster and C. elegans,
  respectively are shown from top to bottom. All of the pathways are triggered by
  insulin-like peptides binding to an insulin-like receptor. The binding event triggers
  tyrosine phosphorylation of an insulin receptor substrate (IRS, termed chico in
  Drosophila). This activates the PI3K leading to recruitment of PDK1, activation
  of AKT and phosphorylation of a Foxo protein (daf-16 in C. elegans). Phosphorylation
  of the Foxo protein leads to cytoplasmic ‘tethering’ of the transcription factor
  in the cytoplasm limiting its nuclear entry and transcriptional activation. Foxo
  may be O-GlcNAc-modified at the canonic AKT site leading to nuclear entry and transcriptional
  activation. In mammals, overexpression of OGT leads to insulin resistance by acting
  downstream of PI3K to modify key signaling molecules. Studies in both mammals, fly
  and C. elegans indicate that O-GlcNAc cycling impacts the insulin-signaling pathway
  at several points downstream of PI3K signaling (indicated by the red shaded area).
  In C. elegans (bottom panel) knockouts of ogt-1 and oga-1, the enymes of O-GlcNAc
  cycling causes changes in macronutrient stores as indicated. Genetic analysis suggests
  that ogt-1 is epistatic to oga-1 as expected. Insulin signaling in C. elegans controls
  the dauer diapause, longevity, and stress reponses, all of which are impacted by
  O-GlcNAc cycling (See table at bottom right).
