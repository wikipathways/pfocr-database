caption: Adaptation and habituation are separate processes that affect the behavioral
  response after preexposure to DA. (A) Under baseline conditions, the putative low-affinity
  DA receptor on AWC mediates a portion of the naive approach to 100% DA via an odr-1-dependent
  pathway. Although the ODR-10 receptor on AWA is not necessary for naive approach
  to DA, it can account for a portion of the response to 100% DA in the absence of
  AWC function. Preexposure to 100% DA causes excessive activation of the high-affinity
  odr-10 receptor on AWA which leads to a down regulation of the AWC mediated approach
  pathway causing adaptation. This interaction between AWC and AWA may be via a common
  downstream neuronal target. Lack of odr-1 in the AWC neuron partially eliminates
  baseline approach to 100% DA, but does not prevent the odr-10-mediated adaptation.
  Any sensitization that may be occurring in AWA is overshadowed by the adaptation.
  (B) Preexposure to intermediate DA concentrations causes less stimulation of the
  low-affinity DA receptor on AWC and strong stimulation of the ODR-10 DA receptor
  (but less stimulation than with 100% DA so that adaptation is less and/or sensitization
  is greater). This leads to the processes of adaptation and sensitization to be equivalently
  favored and the competition between these two opposing processes results in no net
  behavioral decrement in DA response. (C) Preexposure to low DA concentrations causes
  stimulation of only the ODR-10 receptor on AWA (and no activation of the low-affinity
  DA receptor on AWC), eliminating any possible response adaptation. This results
  in the nonassociative learning processes of habituation, dependent on AWA function.
