caption: 'Depiction of the most relevant CK2 interventions on cellular signaling pathways.
  Double arrows indicate a dynamic equilibrium that moves toward the longest arrow
  direction; inhibitions are indicated by bar-headed arrows. a PI3K/Akt pathway: CK2
  is known to directly potentiate Akt functions, but it also inhibits PTEN, thus preventing
  its downregulating functions. b IKK/NFκB pathway: CK2 induces IκBα degradation thus
  reducing its inhibitory action, and stimulates IKK and the p65 subunit of NFkB.
  c JAK2/STAT3 pathway: CK2 directly activates JAK2 and STAT3 and, in turn, CK2 expression
  is under the control of STAT3. d Wnt/β-catenin pathway: CK2 activates Dvl, thus
  inhibiting the GSK3-mediated degradation of β-catenin, and phosphorylates β-catenin,
  promoting its stability; moreover, its phosphorylation of TCF/LEF stimulates the
  β-catenin/LEF complex formation and transcriptional activity. e DNA damage response:
  CK2 phosphorylates the indicated proteins to improve their DNA repair activity.
  f Androgen receptor (AR) pathway: CK2 activity increases AR protein stability, leading
  to promote the AR-dependent transcriptional activity'
