caption: Schematic representation of the Notch signaling pathway. The interaction
  between Notch receptor on one cell and its ligands on the neighboring cell results
  in the proteolytic cleavage of Notch receptor and release of its inter-cellular
  domain (NICD) into the cytoplasm. NICD therefore translocates to the nucleus and
  interacts with cofactors to regulate the expression of downstream genes.
