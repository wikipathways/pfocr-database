caption: Signaling network in skin cancer stem cell niche. Overactivation of core
  signaling pathways, encompassing Shh, Wnt, YAP/ TAZ, and Notch, augments the expression
  of molecules associated with proliferation, thereby fostering the expansion and
  persistence of CSCs. Dysregulated expression of E-cadherin and α-catenin disrupts
  the cytoplasmic sequestration of β-catenin, potentiating Wnt signaling, while concurrently
  diminishing the association between 14–3-3 and YAP, thereby attenuating YAP proteasomal
  degradation. Stimulation of integrin-SRC signaling by stiff ECM promotes CSC proliferation
  by upregulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. Subsequently,
  these pathways facilitate the upregulation of YAP/TAZ and cell-cycle gene expression,
  disrupt adherens junctions, and prevent apoptosis in tumor cells. Within the CSC
  niche, modulation of inflammation, attenuation of Hippo signaling, and stimulation
  of Notch and JAK/STAT3 pathways potentiate the activity of YAP/TAZ. Hyperactivation
  of YAP/TAZ signaling induces cis-inhibition of Notch signaling, thereby impeding
  CSC differentiation. The maintenance of CSC quiescence by Notch signaling is reinforced
  by HIF-1α, which is stabilized within the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, along
  with regulatory crosstalk involving the Wnt/β-catenin, Shh, and YAP/TAZ signaling
  pathways. The migration and metastasis of skin cancers are facilitated by EMT, which
  is initiated by the switch from E-cadherin to N-cadherin. This shift is enhanced
  by factors secreted from CSCs and cellular compartments within the ECM, alongside
  the hyperactivation of key signaling pathways in the CSC niche. Notable pathways
  involved include Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, Shh/GLI, PTEN/PI3K, and JAK/STAT3 pathways.
  These pathways contribute to the upregulation of mesenchymal phenotype markers,
  such as SNAIL, SLUG, TWIST1, ZEB1/2, SIP1, and TCF3, facilitating the transition
  to a more invasive phenotype of skin tumors. CSC, cancer stem cell; SMO, smoothened;
