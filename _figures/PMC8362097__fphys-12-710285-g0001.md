caption: Graphical representation of the comparative review of NAFLD and AFLD signaling
  pathway and effectors. High fat and high carbohydrate diet-induced NAFLD can be
  modulated by Nrf2/FXR/LXRα/RXR/SREBP-1c, PI3K/AKT/SREBP-1c, AMPK/SERCA2b, LILRB4/SHP1/TRAF6/NF-κB/MAPK,
  and TAZ/Ihh signaling pathways. Ethanol-induced AFLD can be modulated by STING-IRF3-Bax,
  C3 /CYP2E1/Gly-tRF/SIRT1, LRP6/Wnt/β-catenin/CYP2E1, and miR-219a-5p/p66Shc signaling
  pathways. NAFLD and AFLD share two signaling pathways, SIRT1/AMPK/SREBP-1c and PI3K/AKT/SREBP-1c,
  while other pathways are owned by each other specifically. A variety of natural
  flavonoids can improve NAFLD, including fisetin, apigenin, puerarin, and curcumin;
  and AFLD, including magnolol, dihydromyricetin, gentiopicroside, and swertiamarin.
  In addition, NAFLD and AFLD can also be improved by probiotics and Akkermansia muciniphila.
  Ultimately, NAFLD and AFLD could be reversed to achieve a homeostasis of lipid metabolism.
