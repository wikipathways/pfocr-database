caption: The p53-MDM2 feedback loop is the “heart” of the p53 pathway. Under normal
  conditions, it maintains p53 levels and activity at constantly low steady state
  levels. A variety of stress signals (only a representative subset of p53-activating
  signals are depicted), related in many ways to carcinogenesis, impinge on this central
  loop to release p53 from MDM2-mediated inhibition. This increases p53 protein levels
  and activity, inducing various phenotypic changes. Many p53-activating signals are
  closely interrelated, as exemplified here for oncogenes, whose impact on p53 is
  partly due to their propensity to induce DNA replication stress. The downstream
  effects of p53 are largely due to its ability to transactivate and repress various
  subsets of target genes; however, at least in the case of apoptosis, protein-protein
  interactions (primarily with Bcl2 family members) also play an important role. It
  is generally believed that the nature of the phenotypic response to p53 activation
  is, at least partially, proportionate to the amplitude, duration and nature of the
  activating signal. Severe stress induces more extreme, usually irreversible responses,
  namely apoptosis and senescence, whereas milder stress would lead to a transient
  growth arrest coupled with an attempt to deal with the cause of stress and repair
  the damage caused by it. Recent evidence indicates that p53 also has an important
  role in enabling the cell to adjust its metabolism in response to mild normal physiological
  fluctuations, including those in glucose and other nutrient levels, oxygen availability,
  and reactive oxygen species levels (see Focus by Vousden).
