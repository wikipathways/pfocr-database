caption: 'Angiotensin II and T lymphocytes activation during COVID-19 best scenario.
  (A) 1: Reduction in tACE2 following SARS-CoV-2 infection. 2: ANG II will increase
  and 3: act as a co-stimulatory molecule in T lymphocytes activation acting via AT1R,
  which are expressed in CD8+ cells. 4: ANG II is also expressed by T lymphocytes,
  enhancing AT1R activation in an autocrine and intracrine manner. 5:AT1R activation
  stimulates CD8+ cells to produce both TNF-α and IFN-γ. 6: TNF-α will increase TH1
  differentiation, and, together with IFN-γ, activate the inflammatory response. 7:
  TNF- α will also activate ADAM-17 activity leading to 8: increase the biologically
  active sACE2 and, 9: maintaining ANG 1-7 levels. 10: ANG 1-7, which has anti-inflammatory
  characteristics, will counterbalance TNF-α and IFN-γ direct effects via MasR pathway.
  Taken together, these alterations would lead to a proper immune response to SARS-CoV-2
  infection. (B) Angiotensin II and T lymphocytes activation during COVID-19 worse
  scenario. 1: tACE2 levels are reduced following SARS-CoV-2 infection. 2: ANG II
  levels remain the same or are even low (see , COVID-19 Worse Scenario), 3: maintaining
  the AT1R activation in CD8+ cells at normal levels. 4: As a result, IFN-γ and TNF-α
  levels remain the same, 5: affecting the beginning of inflammatory response. 6:
  ADAM-17 activity is equal or reduced, 7: leading to reduced biologically active
  sACE2 levels. 8: consequently, ANG 1-7 levels are reduced. 9: This unbalanced immune
  response could not be adequate to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.'
