caption: a | Overall scheme for conversion of topoisomerase DNA–protein crosslinks
  (TOP-DPCs) into protein-free DNA breaks. Association of TOP-DPCs with replication
  or transcription complexes and phase of the cell cycle (S phase versus G1 phase)
  are likely determinants of pathway choice. Debulking of TOP-DPCs by the three ubiquitin–proteasome
  pathways includes the conserved SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) pathway,
  in which RNF4 is the human E3 ubiquitin ligase for TOP1-DPCs, TOP2A-DPCs and TOP2B-DPCs;
  the TRIM41 E3 ligase pathway for crosslinks between TOP3B and DNA or RNA; and the
  cullin pathway for TOP1-DPCs, (step 1). Non-proteasomal TOP-DPC proteolytic pathways.
  The proteases Spartan (SPRTN), GCNA (also known as ACRC), FAM111A and DDI debulk
  TOP1-DPCs and TOP2-DPCs (step 2). Non-proteolytic pathway for TOP2, driven by SUMO
  E3 ligase ZNF451 (ref.) (step 3). Nucleic-acid excision pathways for TOP1 and/or
  TOP2 include excision by the endonucleases MRE11, CtIP and XPF–ERCC1, or excision
  by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) and TDP2 (step 4). b | TDP1 is activated
  by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1),,, and upon cleaving DNA leaves a 3′-phosphate
  that is further processed by polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (not shown). TDP2
  leaves a 5′-phosphate that can be directly ligated or extended by DNA polymerases
  (not shown). Both TDP1 and TDP2 require debulking of TOP-DPCs to gain access to
  the tyrosyl–DNA links. Additional excision pathways involve endonucleases. c | Differential
  roles of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR) in
  repair of TOP1-induced single-ended DNA double-strand breaks (seDSBs) and TOP2-DPC-induced
  DSBs. Whereas seDSB repair by NHEJ is toxic, possibly by inducing large deletions
  owing to illegitimate end joining of distant seDSBs (Fig. ), NHEJ is crucial for
  repair of TOP2-DPCs. TOP1cc, TOP1 cleavage complex.
