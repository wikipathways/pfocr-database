caption: RUNX1 acts as a cytoplasmic attenuator of NF-κB signaling in respiratory
  epithelial cells. After respiratory epithelial cells exposure to LPS, RUNX1, the
  nuclear transcription factor, translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and
  competitively binds to IKKβ to form complexes, which resulted in partly inhibiting
  of the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway (left). The loss or inhibition
  of RUNX1 expression in respiratory epithelial cells can enhance LPS induced inflammatory
  response by promoting the activation of NF-κB signaling (right).
