caption: The transcription factor SP3 is an essential factor for expression of TNF-α
  and Smac mimetic (SM) killing of cancer cells. (a) In cancer cells, high expression
  of Specificity Protein 3 (SP3) cooperates with the classical (green arrows) or alternative
  (yellow arrows) Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway to induce strong and sustained
  expression of TNF-α by binding to the respective DNA recognition sites, GC-boxes
  (for SP3) and NF-κB responsive elements (NREs). The classical NF-κB pathway is activated
  by the binding of TNF-α to its cognate receptor 1, TNF-R1, in a ubiquitinated-Receptor
  Interacting serine/threonine Kinase 1 (RIPK1) dependent manner, which causes a feed-forward
  loop of TNF-α expression. In addition, the alternative NF-κB pathway is activated
  through SM treatment, resulting in accumulation of the NF-κB inducing kinase, NIK,
  which also transcriptionally induce TNF-α expression. Both the classical and alternative
  NF-κB family members bind to the same NRE promoter elements. Since SM treatment
  results in RIPK1 no longer being ubiquitinated, RIPK1 is free to associate with
  a ripoptosome death complex upon TNF-α stimulation, and thereby leads to the death
  of cancer cells (red arrows). (b) The levels of SP3 in normal cells are lower, which
  leads to less overall production of TNF-α as a result of non-optimal NF-κB activity
  at the TNF-α promoter. As well, SMs do not induce the death of normal cells. (c)
  In SP3-deficient cancer cells targeted by specific small interfering RNAs, TNF-α
  is not produced since SP3 is absolutely required for TNF-α expression. Consequently,
  the cancer cells are not susceptible to SM-induced cell death.
