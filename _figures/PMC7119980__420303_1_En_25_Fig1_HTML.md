caption: 'Outline of the coronavirus replicative cycle and replicase polyprotein organization,
  based on SARS-CoV. a Schematic overview of the coronavirus replicative cycle. Following
  entry by receptor-mediated endocytosis and release of the genome into the cytosol,
  genome translation yields the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins. Following polyprotein
  cleavage by multiple internal proteases, the viral nsps assemble into an RTC that
  engages in minus-strand RNA synthesis. Both full-length and subgenome (sg)-length
  minus strands are produced, with the latter templating the synthesis of the sg mRNAs
  required to express the structural and accessory protein genes residing in the 3′-proximal
  quarter of the genome. Ultimately, novel genomes are packaged into nucleocapsids
  that become enveloped by budding from smooth intracellular membranes, after which
  the new virions leave the cell by following the exocytic pathway. See text for more
  details. b The 14 open reading frames in the genome are indicated, i.e., the replicase
  ORFs 1a and 1b, the four common CoV structural protein genes (S, E, M, and N) and
  the ORFs encoding so-called ‘accessory proteins.’ The bottom panel explains the
  organization and proteolytic processing of the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins,
  the latter being produced by −1 ribosomal frameshifting. The nsp3 (PLpro) and nsp5
  (3CLpro) proteases and their cleavage sites are indicated in matching colors. The
  resulting 16 cleavage products [nonstructural proteins (nsps)] are indicated, as
  are the conserved replicase domains. Domain abbreviations and corresponding nsp
  numbers: PLpro, papain-like proteinase (nsp3); 3CLpro, 3C-like protease (nsp5);
  TM, transmembrane domain (nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6); NiRAN, nidovirus RdRp-associated
  nucleotidyl transferase (nsp12); RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12); ZBD,
  zinc-binding domain (nsp13); HEL1, superfamily 1 helicase (nsp13); ExoN, exoribonuclease
  (nsp14); N7-MT, N7-methyl transferase (nsp14); endoU, uridylate-specific endoribonuclease
  (nsp15); 2′-O-MT, 2′-O-methyl transferase (nsp16). Adopted with permission from
