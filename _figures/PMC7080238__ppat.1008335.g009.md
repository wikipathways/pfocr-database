caption: 'Left: In the mock infection, all these proteins are in the cytoplasm. NLRP3
  contains an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD), a NACHT-associated domain (NAD) and 7
  C-terminal leucine rich repeats (LRR). ASC (the apoptosis-associated speck-like
  protein with CARD domain) has two domains (PYD and CARD). The effecter protein pro-Casp-1
  has the three domains (CARD, p20 and p10). It has been demonstrated that the NLR
  protein NLRP3, together with the adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like
  protein with CARD domain (ASC), promotes the cleavage of the pro-Casp-1 to generate
  active subunits p20 and p10, which regulate the maturation of IL-1β.STING comprises
  5 putative transmembrane (TM) regions, predominantly resides in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and regulates innate immune signaling processes. Right: After the
  infection by HSV-1, everything has changed. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)
  belongs to the family of Herpesviridae, which causes various mild clinical symptoms.
  HSV-1 genomic DNA then induce the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway for the IFN-I production.
  Upon binding of cytoplasmic viral DNA, GAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) catalyzed the
  formation of the second messenger cGAMP, which is an endogenous second messenger
  by binding to STING and inducing STING’s dimerization. After that, HSV-1 infection
  also induced NLRP3 translocation to Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) by STING through
  the interaction between STING and NLRP3. Then STING promotes the deubiquitination
  of NLRP3 in K48-linked and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains and initiates the activation
  of NLRP3 inflammasome, promotes the cleavage of the pro-Casp-1 to generate active
  subunits p20 and p10, which regulate the maturation of IL-1β, and IL-1β then secreted
  outside the cells.'
