caption: 'The role of ectopic lipids in insulin resistance. Under conditions of overnutrition
  or defective adipocyte fatty acid metabolism, lipids can be redistributed from eutopic
  sites (adipose tissue) to ectopic storage sites (liver and muscle) and lead to impaired
  insulin signaling, insulin resistance, and T2D. Lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance
  may result from activation of the DAG–PKCε axis and the consequent inhibition of
  INSR signaling through inhibitory phosphorylation of INSR at Thr1160. This leads
  to impaired insulin stimulation of hepatic glycogen synthesis, impaired transcriptional
  upregulation of de novo lipogenic genes, and impaired transcriptional downregulation
  of gluconeogenic genes. Skeletal muscle insulin resistance, caused by increases
  in intramyocellular ectopic lipid, impairs insulin-stimulated glucose transport
  and glycogen synthesis through the activation of the DAG–PKCθ axis and the consequent
  inhibition of the PI3K pathway through inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS1. Abbreviations:
  DAG, diacylglycerol; FA, fatty acid; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; INSR, insulin receptor;
  IRK, insulin receptor kinase; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; LCCoA, long-chain
  CoA; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; Ser/Thr, serine/threonine;
  T2D, type 2 diabetes; TAG, triglyceride; Thr1160, threonine 1160.'
