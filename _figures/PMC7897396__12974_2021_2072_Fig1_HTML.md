caption: Hypothesized nucleus accumbens neuroimmune-glutamate interactions in addiction.
  Drugs of abuse (1) activate TLRs, which (2) triggers the NF-κB signaling pathway
  within microglial cells through activation of P38, which is expressed in activated
  microglia. Microglia then release pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β.
  These cytokines then (3) bind to their receptors (TNFR, IL-1βR) on astroglia, which
  activates NF-κB through JNK pathways. Specifically, binding of these cytokines leads
  to activation of the IKK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK, which leads
  to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. This then leads to (4) repression
  of GLT-1 transcription and ultimately downregulation of the GLT-1 transporter, as
  TNFα negatively regulates EAAT2 transcription. Downregulation of GLT-1 protein results
  in an inability of astroglia to clear excess glutamate from the synapse during reinstated
  drug seeking (5). Following exposure to drug-associated cues, (6) glutamate release
  from cortical afferents into the nucleus accumbens is potentiated, leading to (7)
  activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors (e.g., AMPA, NMDA), rapid, transient
  post-synaptic plasticity, and relapse. In females, estrogen receptors (ERs) are
  located on various cell types including microglia and astroglia, and can directly
  inhibit NF-κB. TLR = toll-like receptor; P38 = p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK); NF-κB = nuclear factor-kappa B; TNFα = tumor necrosis factor alpha; IL =
  interleukin; GLT-1 = glutamate transporter-1
