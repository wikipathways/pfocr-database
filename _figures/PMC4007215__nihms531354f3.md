caption: A) Imd signaling pathway. Transmembrane receptors PGRP-LCs and intracellular
  receptor PGRP-LE sense the diaminopimelic-containing peptidolglycan of Gram-positive
  bacteria and Bacillus. The receptor molecules multimerize upon activation and transmit
  the signal to the adaptor molecule IMD. IMD activation recruits dFADD which recruits
  a caspase, DREDD. Activation of DREDD leads to polyubiquitination of IMD. TAK1 binds
  to the polyubiquitin chain and is responsible for the assembly and activation of
  the IKK complex (IKKβ and IKKγ). The IKK complex mediates the phosphorylation of
  Relish. Phosphorylated Relish is subsequently cleaved by DREDD, leaving the C-terminal
  ankyrin repeats in the cytosol. The N-terminal DNA binding domain of Relish translocates
  to the nucleus and regulates transcription of effector molecules such as diptericin
  and diptericinB. B) Toll signaling pathway. Toll pathway responds to Gram-positive
  bacteria and fungi infections. Lys-type peptidoglycan on bacteria cell wall is detected
  by PGRP-SA, PGRP-SD and GNBP-1. GNBP-3 detects β-glucan on fungal cell wall. Protease
  Persephone can also sense foreign proteolytic activities result from fungal infection.
  Both signals from bacteria and fungi are integrated into the same proteolytic cascade
  and thus lead to the activation of the Toll ligand, Spätzle. Spätzle binds to the
  Toll receptors and transduce the signals to Cactus-Dif through Toll-induced-signaling
  complex which contains MyD88, Tube and Pelle. Cactus is phosphorylated and cleaved
  from Dif, allowing Dif to translocate into nucleus and regulate the transcription
  of effector genes. The point at which viruses interact with each of these pathways
  is currently unresolved.
