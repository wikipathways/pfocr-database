caption: Overview of the cGAS–STING signaling pathway. The cytosolic DNA receptor
  cGAS could be activated by both non-self DNA and self DNA including microbial DNA,
  released mitochondrial DNA, cytosolic micronuclei, and aberrant chromosomal DNA.
  Mn2+ is also able to activate cGAS, leading to an unconventional catalytic synthesis
  of 2′3′-cGAMP []. The second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP and other cyclic dinucleotides
  (CDNs) could cross the cell membrane through gap junction intercellular communication
  (GJIC) []. Then, 2′3′-cGAMP binds to STING dimers localized at the ER membrane,
  which leads to profound conformational changes that trigger STING oligomerization
  and liberation from anchoring factors. STING also can be activated by cGAMP from
  bacterial and GJIC sources, which establishes a role for STING as an independent
  pattern recognition receptor. Next, STING translocates from the ER to the Golgi
  apparatus through ERGIC. During transportation, STING recruits TBK1, thus promoting
  TBK1 autophosphorylation, and the phosphorylation of STING at the C-terminal tail,
  which provides a binding site for IRF3. The cGAS–STING signaling pathway not only
  induces type I IFN and inflammatory signaling responses but also activates other
  cellular processes including autophagy and apoptosis.
