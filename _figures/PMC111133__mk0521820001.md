caption: IP3-mediated ovulation pathway. Ovulation is dependent on an IP3-mediated
  pathway that is activated by LIN-3 EGF and LET-23 EGFR, which likely stimulates
  hydrolysis of PIP2 into IP3. LFE-1 encodes an IP3R homolog, which plays a known
  role in releasing intracellular calcium. LFE-2 encodes an IP3K that phosphorylates
  IP3 into IP4 (). IPP-5 encodes a 5-phosphatase (5-Ptase), which likely dephosphorylates
  IP3 into IP2.
