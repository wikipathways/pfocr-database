caption: PNPLA3 I148M promotes activation of HH signaling and its downstream target
  Yap. Summary scheme representing the major molecular steps characterizing the phenotype
  of I148M HSCs. The presence of the PNPLA3 genetic variant leads to disturbed PPARγ
  and LXR signaling (accumulation of total cholesterol = TC and free cholesterol =
  FC), resulting in activation of Hedgehog (HH) and Yap signaling and an increase
  in anaerobic metabolism (higher ECAR and diminished expression of GLUT1, PFKL, PKM).
  Both TGF-β and Leptin induce expression of Yap, as a target of the HH pathway, and
  its downstream effectors (Vimentin, FOXF1, AREG, CCND1). Inhibition of Yap by Rosiglitazone
  leads to decreased Yap transcriptional activity in HSCs carrying PNPLA3 I148M.
