caption: Metabolic pathway of ethylene glycol (EG) fermentation through the dehydratase
  route. The metabolization of EG through this pathway is dependent of a coenzyme
  B12-dependent diol-dehydratase (1), an aldehyde dehydrogenase (2), a phosphotransacetylase
  (3), an acetate kinase (4) and an alcohol dehydrogenase (5) (Hartmanis and Stadtman,
  1986; Toraya et al., 1979). Image adapted from Toraya et al. (1979). Created with
