caption: 'Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and antioxidant roles against CRC development.
  SCFA improves CRC through a reduction in oxidative stress, which enhances antioxidase
  release and attenuates inflammation. SCFA binding to its receptor, GPR43, and activates
  the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway. Keap1 dissociates from Nrf2, allowing Nrf2 to enter the
  nucleus and upregulate the transcription of antioxidant enzymes. This, in turn,
  reduces ROS concentrations to attenuate the onset of inflammation-induced CRC. On
  the right, butyrate is shown to enhance HDAC inhibitor activity, which reduces ROS
  production. Decreased ROS production leads to less activation of the NF-KB signaling
  pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome, again lessening the development of inflammation-induced
  CRC. Abbreviations: GPR43, G-coupled Receptor 43; Nrf2, nuclear erythroid factor
