caption: (A) Schematic pathway diagram of carbohydrate metabolism, and list of 51
  targeted enzymes. (B) Schematic overview of the combinatorial CRISPR-Cas9 screening
  approach. A dual-gRNA library in which each element targets either gene-gene pairs
  or gene-scramble pairs, to assay dual and single gene perturbations, was constructed
  from array-based oligonucleotide pools. Competitive growth based screens were performed,
  and the relative abundance of dual-gRNAs were sampled over multiple time points.
  The fitness and genetic interactions were computed via a numerical Bayes model and
  key hits were validated using both competitive cell growth assays and measurement
  of metabolic fluxes. See also  and .
