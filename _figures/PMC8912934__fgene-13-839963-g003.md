caption: Anoikis pathway is a barrier against metastasis and loss of PRP4K triggers
  anoikis resistance by promoting pro-survival signaling. (A) Anoikis pathway induces
  cell death (apoptosis) after cell detachment from the ECM (extracellular matrix)
  to prevent adherent-independent cell growth and attachment. Pro-survival pathways
  that regulate cell survival and proliferation are terminated once integrins disengage
  from the ECM. Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is one such pathway,
  and detachment triggers EGFR trafficking to the lysosome and its degradation to
  attenuate of EGFR signaling; a feedback loop that is dependent upon the presence
  of PRP4K. EGFR degradation consequently results in decreased ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  kinase activation to further suppress pro-survival signaling. In addition, PTEN
  (phosphatase-tensin) acts as a tumour suppressor to inhibit growth by negatively
  regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. (B) The depletion of PRP4K leads to anoikis
  resistance and cell survival in xenotransplanted mouse ID8 ovarian carcinoma cells
  under detached growth conditions. PRP4K depleted ID8 cells disseminate within the
  peritoneal cavity which then promote anchorage-independent growth and metastasis
  in the diaphragm and peritoneum. Loss of PRP4K results in impaired degradation of
  EGFR, which in turn results in sustained ERK and PI3K/AKT kinase activation to promote
  cell survival and anoikis resistance in PRP4K-depleted cells. Elements of this figure
