caption: Main receptors engaged to RIPK1 signaling are TNFR1, TLR3 and TLR4 (via TRIF
  pathway) and interferon receptors. TNFR stimulation recruits TRADD and RIPK1 thus
  leading to the formation of membrane bound complex I and subsequent NF-kB activation.
  At this step, NF-kB triggers transcription of proinflammatory (i.e. TNF and pro-IL1β)
  and survival factors (i.e. cFLIP; not shown). Deubiquitination of Complex I induces
  the formation of Complex II, which may induce apoptosis through activation of caspase-8
  (Cas-8). However, under conditions of caspase-8 inhibition, which can be induced
  by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (zVAD), a cell death-related platform called
  necrosome is formed. Necrosome formation is also associated to stimulation of TLR3,
  TLR4, and IFNAR through interaction and further oligomerization of RIPK1 and RIPK3,
  a process also requiring reduced caspase-8 activity. Necrosome formation induces
  the phosphorylation of MLKL, which then disrupts membrane integrity to cause necroptosis.
  This process can be prevented by kinase inhibitors of RIPK3, like GSK´872. Necroptosis
  is accompanied by concomitant release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS),
  which may amplify the inflammatory response through stimulation of pattern recognition
  receptors, including the ones depicted in the figure. In absence of RIPK1, necrosome
  formation (RIPK3 oligomerization) is achieved without the need of caspase-8 inhibition.
  Necrosome formation is inherently associated to strong inflammatory response, which
  can be partially prevented by RIPK3 kinase inhibition
