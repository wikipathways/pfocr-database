caption: CAMKK2 as a molecular hub downstream in the bone–prostate cancer (PCa) microenvironment.
  In PCa cells, the androgen receptor (AR) binds to androgen response element (ARE)
  on CaMKK2 promoter which is situated upstream of the transcriptional start site.
  Thus, CaMKK2 is a direct transcriptional target of AR and its expression is highly
  elevated in metastatic PCa. Once transcribed and translated, CaMKK2 binds to AR
  initiating a positive feedback loop to stimulate AR transcriptional activity in
  the activation of AR-dependent genes that regulate cell cycle progression such as
  cyclin D. Additionally, CaMKK2 through its activation of AMPK regulates PCa cell
  migration. CaMKK2-AMPK signaling pathway also regulates cellular glycolysis via
  the activation of phosphofructokinase (PFK). This drives PCa cell anabolism and
  in turn promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth. Furthermore, in CRPCs, CaMKK2
  binds to nucleoporin 62 (NUP62) to enter the nucleus, where it along with AR and
  NUP62 are recruited to the ARE in the promoters of downstream targets such as prostate
  serum antigen (PSA). PCa cells that metastasize to the bone physically interacts
  with OBs to alter their organization and function. Although both AR and CaMKK2 are
  expressed in OBs, whether CaMKK2 operates downstream of AR in these cells is not
  known. In OBs, CaMKK2 signaling inhibits cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production
  and protein kinase A (PKA) activation. PKA is an important regulator of OB differentiation.
  Thus, the inhibition of CaMKK2 would relieve this inhibition of PKA signaling and
  OB differentiation. In osteoclasts (OCs), CaMKK2 signaling through CaMKIV-pCREB
  activates nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), which is the master regulator
  of OC differentiation. In macrophages, CaMKK2 regulates cytoskeletal rearrangement
  via its regulation of Pyk2. Moreover, CaMKK2-CaMK1 signaling regulates cytokine/chemokine
  production by macrophages. Thus, CaMKK2 is a key component of AR signaling in PCa
  cells and additionally regulates multiple cell types that constitute the tumor microenvironment
  within the bone.
