caption: 'Interferon-γ signaling. Canonical IFN-γ signaling pathway requires activation
  of its receptor, IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR) and consequent, stimulation of JAK/STAT
  (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription) signaling. The
  binding of IFN-γ to the IFNGR complex results in tight association of IFNGR1 and
  IFNGR2 and a reorientation of their intracellular domains. Close association of
  JAK1 and JAK2 proteins facilitate auto- and transphosphorylation and enzymatic activation.
  Furthermore, activated JAK proteins phosphorylate the STAT1 binding site, activating
  his dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where it binds to γ-activated
  site (GAS) elements and promotes gene transcription. The JAK-STAT pathway is negatively
  regulated at multiple sites: SOCS suppresses JAK and STAT activation, while PIAS
  inhibits IFN-γ induced gene transcription. In a non-canonical pathway, IFN-γ stimulates
  STAT1-PI3K-Akt axis what leads to implication of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  in interferon signaling. Furthermore, mTOR/p70S6 kinase cascade promotes mRNA translation
  of effector proteins'
