caption: 'Influenza A viruses are enveloped, negative strand RNA viruses belonging
  to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Their genome consists of eight single-stranded RNA
  segments encoding 11 or 12 proteins: the receptor-binding haemagglutinin (HA); the
  sialic acid-destroying enzyme neuraminidase (NA), the ion channel M2, the matrix
  protein M1; the nucleoprotein (NP); the polymerase acidic protein (PA), polymerase
  basic proteins 1 and 2 (PB1, PB2) and the pro-apoptotic protein polymerase basic
  1 (PB1)-F2; the nuclear export protein (NEP; also known as NS2) and the host antiviral
  response antagonist non-structural protein 1 (NS1); the newly identified N40 protein,
  which is expressed from the PB1 segment and has an unknown function []. Within the
  virion, each of the eight RNA segments forms a viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex:
  in particular, viral RNA is wrapped around NP, and this structure is in turn bound
  to the viral polymerase complex, to constitute the viral nucleocapsid. In the initial
  stages of influenza A virus replication, the viral HA binds to host cell receptors
  that contain terminal α-2,6-linked or α-2,3-linked sialic acid (α-2,6-SA or α-2,3-SA)
  moieties, and the virus enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Cleavage
  of HA by cellular proteases is required to expose the HA peptide that is responsible
  for the fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane. Acidification
  of the late endocytic vesicles allows the viral HA to undergo a conformational rearrangement
  that produces a fusogenic protein. The H+ ions in the acidic endosome are pumped,
  via the viral M2 ion channel, into the virus structure allowing the virus uncoating
  and the release of RNP complexes into the cytoplasm. The viral RNA is then imported
  in an ATP-dependent manner into the cell nucleus for transcription of genomic and
  messenger RNAs which are transported to the cytosol for translation. Viral HA, NA
  and M2 are synthesized in the Endoplasmic Reticulum, transported by the trans-Golgi
  secretory pathway and the mature proteins are inserted in the plasma membrane. New
  viral RNA is encased in the nucleocapsidic proteins and, together with matrix protein,
  is transported to cell surface where HA and NA will be incorporated. Progeny virions
  are then released from cells by budding'
