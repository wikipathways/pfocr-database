caption: 'A. The siRNA pathway: Double-stranded “trigger” RNAs (hairpin), derived
  from the inverted terminal repeats of a DNA transposon in the case illustrated,
  are processed and then cleaved into 21 to 24 nt siRNAs by the dicer family of proteins
  (light green amorphous shape). A single-strand siRNA (short red line) complementary
  to the transposon mRNA is selectively incorporated into the Argonaute containing
  RISC complex (blue amorphous shape with short red line). The siRNA directs RISC
  to complementary sequences in transposon mRNA (long red line), leading to its post-transcriptional
  destruction. The figure was drawn based on concepts presented in the following reviews,
  , . B. The piRNA pathway: A primary piRNA transcript (wavy blue line) generated
  from a piRNA cluster (blue rectangle) that contains sequences derived from TEs (darker
  blue rectangle inset) is processed into mature 24–35 nt piRNAs (small blue line).
  Binding of the mature piRNA by the Piwi/Aubergine protein (color?…make different
  from Ago3 and panel A) allows it to be directed to complementary sequences in TE
  mRNA (red line). Endonucleolytic cleavage (scissor) 10 nt from the 5’ end of the
  small RNA and 3’ processing liberates a secondary sense strand transposon piRNA
  (red line), which associates with the Argonaute 3 protein (color?…make different
  from Aubergine and panel A). The binding of this complex to complementary sequences
  in the original precursor piRNA, followed by endonucleolytic cleavage and 3’ processing
  liberates, generates a secondary antisense piRNA that can be directed to TE mRNA.
  This reiterative cycle (e.g., a “ping-pong” cycle) can lead to the destruction of
  transposon mRNA in the germ line. The piRNA model was redrawn based on concepts
  and models presented in the following papers, , , and for the example illustrated
  is from Drosophila; however, a similar pathway likely operates in mammalian cells
  (see text for details).'
