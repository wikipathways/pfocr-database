caption: Flow chart describing the profiling of Akt1-regulated miRNAs in human PC3
  and DU145 PCa cells. Among the 827 miRNAs analyzed using the NanoString technology,
  222 miRNAs in DU145 cells and 125 miRNAs in PC3 cells were found to be modulated
  by Akt1 gene silencing. Out of the 61 matched miRNAs from DU145 and PC3 cells with
  Akt1 loss (26 up- and 35 downregulated), there were 7 upregulated cancer promoters
  and 11 downregulated cancer suppressors, which were subjected for bioinformatics
  analysis using the Ingenuity®, mirPath V.3, TargetScan, dbEMT, and cBioportal databases
  to identify miR-199a-5p and let-7a-5p as the key Akt1-regulated miRNAs modulating
  PCa cell EMT.
