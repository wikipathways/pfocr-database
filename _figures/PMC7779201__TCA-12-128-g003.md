caption: 'Hypothesis of Apatinib acquired drug‐ resistance mechanism caused by WRN
  point mutation. It is known that Apatinib inhabits the mutations of ALK and Pten,
  which activates the PI3K pathway, thus induced the apoptosis of tumor: we put forward
  a hypothesis, the binding rate of RQC structural domain in WRN gene and TP53 increased,
  which leads to the inactivation of TP53 again, then the apoptosis of tumor cell
  is controlled and the growth of tumor is promoted, thus the drug resistance appears,
  which is the unknown part., Known; , Unknown.'
