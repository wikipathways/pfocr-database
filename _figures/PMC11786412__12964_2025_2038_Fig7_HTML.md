caption: Reconstruction the sex determination regulatory pathway involving amhr2.
  A The dosage compensation effect of amhr2 in male and female gonads. Amh secreted
  by Spotted knifejaw germ cells binds to amhr2 on supporting cell membranes, driving
  sex differentiation. In males, amhr2y on the Y chromosome promotes the synthesis
  of multiple receptor variants (amhr2ay, amhr2by, amhr2cy), while females synthesize
  only amhr2a from the X chromosome. Dosage compensation effect highlights the role
  of amhr2 in promoting male sex differentiation. B Sex determination regulatory pathway
  of Spotted knifejaw. The amh/amhr2 system is positioned upstream in the Sex determining
  pathway. In male, amhr2 has three mRNA transcripts (amhr2ay, amhr2by, amhr2cy),
  while females have one (amhr2a). Amhr2 expression in male testes significantly boosts
  male-associated gene expression (sox9b, dmrt1), enhancing testosterone synthesis
  and promoting male sex differentiation. Similarly, Amhr2 expression in females boosts
  female-associated gene expression (wnt4, foxl2), leading to estrogen synthesis and
  facilitating female sex differentiation
