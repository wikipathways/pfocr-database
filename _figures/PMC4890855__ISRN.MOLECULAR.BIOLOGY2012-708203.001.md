caption: Models of β-barrel OMP assembly in Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria,
  and chloroplasts. In Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the outer
  membrane proteins (OMPs) are synthesized in the cytoplasm (Cyt) as precursors with
  an N-terminal signal sequence. Precursor OMPs exit the cytoplasm via the inner membrane-localized
  Sec translocon (not shown). Cleavage of the signal sequence during the translocation
  process leads to the transient appearance of the mature nascent OMPs in the periplasm
  (Peri) where they interact with chaperones, such as SurA and Skp. The chaperones-bound
  OMPs are then offloaded to the BAM complex, which assembles and inserts them into
  the outer membrane (OM) as β-barrel proteins. Like in bacteria, OMPs are synthesized
  in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. From there, OMPs are imported into the intermembrane
  space (IMS) via the TOM (mitochondria) and TOC (chloroplasts) complexes. In the
  IMS-side of the mitochondrial outer membrane, small Tim chaperones interact with
  the nascent OMPs and help their transfer to the SAM complex for assembly and insertion
  into the outer membrane as β-barrel proteins. The core component of the mitochondrial
  TOM complex, Tom40, is also a β-barrel OMP, whose biogenesis is dependent on additional
  assembly factors, including Mdm10, another β-barrel OMP. In case of chloroplasts,
  it is unclear whether after synthesis in the cytoplasm the nascent β-barrel OMPs
  are first imported into the IMS via the TOC complex for subsequent assembly or from
  the cytoplasm they interact directly with the Toc75-V, whose three POTRA domains
  are recently shown to be oriented towards the cytoplasm. Like small Tims of the
  mitochondrial IMS, Tic22 of chloroplasts may chaperone nascent β-barrel OMPs in
  the IMS if indeed they follow the IMS pathway. The oligomeric states of BamA, Sam50,
  and Toc75-V are arbitrarily drawn. See text for alternative protein/complex names.
  P and P1 to P5 denote the POTRA domains.
