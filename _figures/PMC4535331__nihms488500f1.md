caption: The inflammatory reflex controls innate immune responses by a mechanism that
  targets the regulatory transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Exogenous
  and endogenous molecular products of infection and injury interact with receptors
  that are expressed by cells of the innate immune system, including Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) and NLRs (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat-containing family,
  such as NALPs (NACHT-, LRR- and PYD-domain containing proteins) and nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors). Ligand–receptor interactions activate
  innate immune responses and induce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  These molecules also activate afferent sensory neurons, which constitute the sensory
  arc of the inflammatory reflex. Axons travelling in the vagus nerve relay this information
  as action potentials to the brain stem. This in turn activates the efferent arc,
  which is known as the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. This inhibits innate
  immune responses in the spleen through inhibitory signals that arise in the brain
  stem, traverse the vagus nerve and signal through nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
  subunit α7 (α7nAChR), which is expressed by cytokine-producing immune cells. This
  leads to the suppression of NF-κB activation and the inhibition of innate immune
  responses. Note that the initiation of the inflammatory reflex by many possible
  ligands through key receptors is a crucial point of innate immune control. So, information
  from many stimulating molecules is processed by a smaller number of pattern recognition
  receptors that transduce signalling information to a small number of transcription
  factors, including NF-κB, that regulate innate immune responses. Maximal control
  is thereby derived from a circuit in which the inflammatory reflex targets this
  restricted point of information processing. dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; HMGB1, high-mobility
  group  protein; IκB, inhibitor of NF-κB; IL-1α, interleukin 1α.
