caption: Simplified schema of major metabolic fluxes in (a) aerobic non-malignant
  cells and (b) hypoxic tumor cells of breast carcinoma. Thickness of arrows and bold
  text indicate relative intensity of fluxes. CL, citrate lyase; CS, citrate synthase;
  IDH1, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase. According to Metallo
  et al. [], the increased flux from glutamine into the Krebs cycle by mutation of
  IDH1 provides the acetyl-CoA for lipid biosynthesis under hypoxic conditions, because
  most pyruvate in cancer cells is converted to lactate. Increase in flux through
  the pentose phosphate pathway delivers ribose-5-phosphate needed for DNA synthesis
  and NADPH required for lipid biosynthesis. Conversely, less NADH is produced through
  pyruvate dehydrogenase or the Krebs cycle, as mitochondrial respiration for ATP
  production is less favored.
