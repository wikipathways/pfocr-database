caption: 'The anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway consists of six core genes (below the
  solid line). We also examined a gene upstream from the ABP, phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase (PAL), and a side-branch enzyme that produces flavonols, flavonol synthase
  (FLS). The ABP can be divided into early and late halves based on the step that
  produces flavonols (dotted line). The core enzymes are abbreviated as follows: chalcone
  synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone-3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) and UDP glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase
  (UF3GT).'
