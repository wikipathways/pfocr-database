caption: Pan-pathway inhibition. The janus kinase/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (JAK/STAT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways
  are both activated by a tyrosine receptor kinase such as the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR). The EGFR once activated leads to autophosphorylation, which in
  turn activates JAK proteins. The STAT protein is then activated and can activate
  the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) proteins to affect cellular physiology.
  In the MAPK pathway, the EGFR activates the growth factor receptor-bound protein
  2 (GRB2), which acts as an adapter protein to activate the son of sevenless (SOS)
  protein. SOS can directly facilitate the cycling of guanine diphosphate (GDP) on
  the rat sarcoma virus (RAS) protein for guanine triphosphate (GTP), inducing its
  active conformation. Active KRAS can continue signaling through the MAPK pathway
  by binding the rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) protein, or it can act bind
  phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and promote signaling through this pathway.
  RAF can then bind the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which can activate extracellular signal
  regulated kinase (ERK). In the PI3K pathway, phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase
  1 (PDK1) is activated, which activates protein kinase B (AKT). All three pathways
  are distinctly different but are interconnected; the inhibition at any of one these
  steps can easily be compensated and therefore requires multi-targeted inhibition
  for effect.
