caption: Viral infection suppresses autophagy. Viruses have evolved a variety of strategies
  to escape or manipulate autophagic steps to benefit their own survival. HIV-1 envelope
  up-regulates the mTOR pathway in DCs, resulting in autophagy exhaustion which promotes
  cell-associated HIV-1 and transfer of HIV-1 infection to CD4 T cells. KSHV viral
  protein, v-GPCR which also modulates the mTOR signaling pathway. Besides activating
  mTOR, v-GPCR can mimic the cellular homolog GPCR and suppress autophagy by blocking
  the expression of ATG14L. ICP34.5 encoded by HSV-1, binds to Beclin-1 and inhibits
  autophagy function. And the mutant HSV-1 virus lacking the Beclin-1-binding domain
  of ICP34.5 cannot block autophagy in neurons. HCMV proteins, TRS1 and IRS1, suppress
  autophagosome biogenesis by interacting with Beclin-1. In addition, the anti-apoptotic
  protein, Bcl-2, interacts with the evolutionarily conserved autophagy protein, Beclin-1.
  The majority of members of the gamma-herpesvirus family encode and express vBcl-2,
  their cellular counterparts (cBCL-2), and inhibit autophagy by directly interacting
  with Beclin-1. Like KSHV encodes orf16 and MHV-68 produces M11. There is a checkpoint
  of the autophagy pathway in which cellular and KSHV FLIPs limit the Atg3-mediated
  step of LC3 conjugation to regulate autophagosome biogenesis. In addition, KSHV
  K7 protein interacts with the Rubicon autophagy protein and blocks the autophagosome
  maturation step by suppressing VPS34 enzymatic activity. Red line, inhibition; green
  line, promotion
