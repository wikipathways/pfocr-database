caption: Modulation of both the NO/cGMP and PI3K/Akt antiapoptotic signals in MCF-10A
  human mammary epithelial cells, was elicited by pharmacological intervention using
  pathway inhibitors (e.g. LY294002 and KT5823) or pathway activators (e.g. 8-Br-cGMP).
  Attenuation of the antiapoptotic NO/cGMP signaling pathway revealed the ability
  of estrogens to elicit apoptosis via extranuclear ER. In the absence of NO/cGMP-mediated
  control, the activation of this extranuclear ER mediated a rapid estrogenic cell
  death signal that was blocked by inhibition of MPT or inhibition of caspase-3. For
  a full description of pharmacological agents, mechanisms of action, and abbreviations
  used, please see Materials and Methods.
