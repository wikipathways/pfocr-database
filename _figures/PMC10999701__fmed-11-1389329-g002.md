caption: 'This diagram shows AKT/PI3K function, (1) Cell development regulation: AKT
  pathway regulates cell development by stimulating protein synthesis and inhibiting
  apoptosis through the phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bad and caspase-9,
  promotes cell development, (2) glucose homeostasis: AKT activation facilitates glucose
  homeostasis by enhancing glucose utilization and absorption, ensuring ample energy
  for cellular functions, and preventing glycogen breakdown, (3) cell proliferation
  and protein synthesis: AKT promotes cell proliferation and protein synthesis by
  activating mTORC1, which phosphorylates key effectors (S6K and 4E-BP1), promoting
  cell growth. AKT activation advances the cell cycle by blocking inhibitors (p21
  and p27), permitting cell division, and (4) angiogenesis control: AKT/PI3K pathway
  controls angiogenesis by stimulating VEGF synthesis, promoting endothelial cell
  migration and proliferation for the formation of new blood vessels. Essential for
  tissue repair, growth, and efficient transport of nutrients and oxygen to tissues'
