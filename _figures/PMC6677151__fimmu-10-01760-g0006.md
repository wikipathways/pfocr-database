caption: A model of the inhibitory effect of Gal-3BP on TAK1-dependent NF-κB signaling
  pathway. TNF-α binds with its specific receptor, TNFR, and then recruits tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD), receptor-interacting protein
  1 (RIP1), and TNF receptor-associated factors 2/5 (TRAF2/5) to form a large receptor
  complex. Similarly, IL-1 and LPS bind with their specific receptors (IL-1R and TLR4)
  and recruit MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1/4 (IRAK1/4), and TNF
  receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is recruited
  by TRAF2/5 (in the TNF pathway) or TRAF6 (in the IL-1 and LPS pathways) and forms
  a complex with TAK1 binding protein 2 (TAB2) or TAB3, resulting in the phosphorylation
  and activation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinases (IKKs). Activated IKKs phosphorylate
  and degrade IκB proteins, leading to nuclear localization and activation of NF-κB.
  Here, we speculate on the inhibitory effect of Gal-3BP on the TAK1-dependent NF-κB
  signaling pathway. Gal-3BP interacts with TAK1 and inhibits its phosphorylation,
  leading to suppression of its kinase activity and protein stability. The effect
  of TAK1 inhibition eventually induces the inhibition of NF-κB activation by the
  suppression of IKKs and activation of IκB, respectively.
