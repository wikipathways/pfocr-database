  method) was considered significant; Disturbance of (B). Pyrimidine metabolism; (C)
  Purine metabolism after exposure to the mixture at several human-relevant levels
  (GM, 2GM, 5GM, Max, and 5Max); yellow and 1 represent GM, green, and 2 represent
  2GM; blue and 3 represent 5GM, orange, and 4 represent Max; black and 5 represent
  5Max;  represents up-regulation,  represents down-regulation and  represents nondysregulated.
  Complete pathway data are available in Table S9. Note: ADP, adenosine diphosphate;
  AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CDP, cytidine 5′-diphosphate;
  CTP, cytidine triphosphate; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate;
  UDP, uridine diphosphate; UDP-glucose, uridine diphosphate glucose; UMP, uridine
  monophosphate; UTP, uridine 5′triphosphate.'
