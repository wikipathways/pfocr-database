caption: Molecular, mechanical and regulatory models of the V-type H+  ATPase. (A)
  Molecular model. Subunits of catalytic complex V1 bear  capital letters; subunits
  of the V0 complex in the apical membrane  bear small letters. (B) Mechanical model
  of the proton pump consisting of a  stator and rotor. (C) Regulatory model. The
  phosphorylation of subunit C is  thought to be instrumental in the assembly of the
  two complexes to form the  active proton pump. Candidate kinases (PK) that might
  phosphorylate subunit C  are protein kinase A and/or protein kinase C.
