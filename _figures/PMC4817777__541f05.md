caption: Regulatory pathway leading to colon cancer–promoting splicing aberrations.
  ELK1 overexpression results from increased activity of the RAS-MAPK pathway due
  to hyperactivating KRAS mutations. This leads to increased transcription of MYC
  and PTBP1. Increased MYC levels also lead to increased PTBP1 levels. PTBP1 overexpression
  is one of the elements responsible for an alternative splicing profile associated
  with colon cancer. Among some of the alternative splicing pattern shifts induced
  by PTBP1 are the inclusion of RAC1 exon 3b, the increased inclusion of NUMB exon
  9, and the favoring of PKM exon 10 inclusion over exon 9 inclusion. These contribute
  to colon adenocarcinoma development by increasing cell proliferation and leading
  to genomic instability and epithelial–mesenchymal transition.
