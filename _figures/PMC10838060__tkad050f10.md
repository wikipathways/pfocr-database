caption: Regulation of cGAS-STING by metal ions. Both Fe2+ and Zn2+ increase the binding
  affinity of cGAS to DNA, thereby activating the cGAS-STING pathway. However, the
  action of Zn2+ can be inhibited by the Zn2+ chelating agent TPEN. Additionally,
  Zn2+ can increase the production of reactive oxygen species and inhibit autophagy,
  leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent activation of the cGAS-STING
  pathway. The ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) preparation of Zn2+ can also activate
  the cGAS-STING pathway. Similarly, Mn2+ can enhance the signaling of cGAS-STING
  by increasing the binding affinity between cGAMP and STING, promoting the release
  of mtDNA. Furthermore, excessive Ca2+ can cause the opening of the mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore, allowing mtDNA to escape and activate both the cGAS-STING
  pathway and NLRP3 inflammasomes. In the endoplasmic reticulum, Ca2+ mediates the
  transport of STING, blocking the localization of STING, leading to its transportation
  to the ERGIC and Golgi for activation. cGAS Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, cGAMP 2′3′cyclic
