caption: Overview of Modular Assembly of Drug Safety Subnetworks (MADSS). Orange boxes
  indicate data sources used in this analysis. Gray boxes indicate additional data
  sources not used in this study but supported by the method. Beginning with a human
  protein-protein interaction network (interactome) built from such data as experimental
  evidence, metabolic pathway databases, text mining, and interactions predicted from
  co-expression data, we isolate all medium-confidence interactions and above. Seed
  proteins with demonstrated genetic links to the adverse event (AE) are subsequently
  annotated. We next apply four adapted network analysis functions to score all proteins
  in the interactome on their connectivity to the seed set. Proteins with high scores
  embody an AE neighborhood (gray dotted circle); drugs targeting proteins in this
  subnetwork are predicted to elicit AEs. We assign positive and negative control
  drugs to their highest-scoring target. We then combine the four AE neighborhoods
  (one for each pairwise network function) by training a random forest classifier
  to generate a subnetwork (SubNet) model (red dotted circle). We integrate MWAS and
  systems pharmacology (SubNet) models using a logistic regression classifier to predict
  drug safety.
