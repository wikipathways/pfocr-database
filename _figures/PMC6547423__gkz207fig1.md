caption: (A) The VEGF promoter PQS and scheme of G oxidation to OG, as well as (B)
  the proposed APE1-dependent pathway for transcriptional modulation. The previous
  studies from our laboratory placed the G-rich sequence between –16 to –64 relative
  to the transcription start site of the SV40 promoter in the coding strand, and controls
  conducted with a G4-negative sequence support the non-canonical structure participates
  in gene modulation (,); however, the currently available data cannot speak to the
  role of the i-motif fold in the process.
