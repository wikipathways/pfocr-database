caption: Flux partitioning around threonine and isoleucine metabolism. The flux distribution
  through the metabolic routes around the threonine node was investigated using stable
  isotope tracer experiments with 13C-labeled threonine and 13C-labeled isoleucine.
  (A and D) Portion of consumed (cons) threonine (A) or isoleucine (D) recovered in
  proteinogenic (prot) threonine, glycine, or isoleucine. The labeled fraction (light
  color) corresponds to consumed threonine or isoleucine directly incorporated into
  proteins, while the unlabeled fraction (dark color) represents the amino acids in
  proteins synthesized de novo from CCM precursors. (B and E) Contribution of threonine
  (B) or isoleucine (E) catabolism to propanol synthesis. The labeled fraction (light
  color) corresponds to the fraction of propanol synthesized using the carbon backbone
  from consumed threonine (B) or isoleucine (E), while the unlabeled fraction (dark
  color) represents the part of propanol synthesized from CCM via aspartate. Isotopic
  enrichments (defined as the molar ratio of the quantity of labeled compound to the
  total quantity of compound) are shown above each bar. The raw data and details of
  the calculations are provided in the supplemental material. (C and F) Partitioning
  of fluxes involved in the use of threonine (C) or isoleucine (F) during fermentation.
  The fraction of consumed threonine or isoleucine catabolized through a pathway,
  reported in colored boxes, was assessed from the molar ratio of the amount of a
  labeled proteinogenic amino acid or volatile compound to the amount of consumed
  amino acid. The fluxes indicated by light blue arrows were not quantified because
  of the small amounts of metabolites produced, which prevented accurate measurement
  of labeling incorporation.
