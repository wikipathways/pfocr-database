caption: After DNA is damaged by cisplatin, and intrastrand crosslink is formed. If
  WT Pol β bypasses the lesion, it preferentially inserts the incorrect A opposite
  the crosslink. This mismatch is recognized by the mismatch repair pathway (MMR),
  but cannot be repaired leading to cell death. In contrast, if the intrastrand crosslink
  is bypassed by the P242R Pol β variant, the correct nucleotide, C, is inserted across
  the lesion. This is now recognized by the nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER),
  which properly excises and repairs the DNA, resulting in cell survival.
