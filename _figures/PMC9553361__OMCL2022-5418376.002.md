caption: Copper ion-mediated cell death in DCM. Copper can mediate various types of
  cell death in vivo, mainly including apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, and cuproptosis
  recently discovered via copper-mediated. The different apoptosis pathways are triggered
  by copper at different time points of the exposure period, as the increase in transcripts
  was sequential []. Apoptosis mainly occurs in mitochondria, nucleus, and endoplasmic
  reticulum. Autophagy is mainly due to the activation of mTOR-ULK1/2 signaling pathway
  by copper ion, which is a self-protection mechanism of the body, but excessive autophagy
  can cause pathological damage to the body []. Pyroptosis is caused by copper ion
  through Fenton/Haber Weiss reactions that occur and involve destructive cell death
  mediated by ROS [, ]. Cuproptosis mainly occurs in cells with high energy demand
  and abundant mitochondria. Excessive copper ions participate in TCA process under
  the action of FDX1, which can induce DLAT aggregation and lead to abnormal mitochondrial
  protein folding, followed by the loss of Fe-S protein, resulting in cell death due
  to energy metabolism defects []. Besides, copper ions can lead to redox imbalance,
  and the antioxidant defense of GSH and SOD is insufficient to resist the damaging
  effect of ROS [].
