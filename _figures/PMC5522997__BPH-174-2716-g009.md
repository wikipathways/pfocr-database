caption: Representative gene networks that were significantly regulated (P < 0.05
  with the Fisher's exact test) in response to cocaine in WT compared to SERT Met172
  mice. Gene expression was assessed using RNA‐Seq and figures were generated by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis Path Designer (Qiagen). (A) Network centred around the network
  hub genes Akt (Akt1) in the PrL after acute cocaine treatment (20 mg·kg−1). (B)
  Network centred around the network hub genes ERK1/2 (Mapk1 and Mapk3) in the NAc
  after chronic cocaine treatment (5 days, 15 mg·kg−1 daily). Seed molecules from
  the list of differentially regulated genes in WT compared to SERT Met172 mice are
  shown in the form of protein networks in red (upregulated in WT) or green (down‐regulated
  in WT), along with other molecules (grey and white) that connect smaller networks
  to make larger networks. Darker green or red indicates higher statistical significance
  for differential gene expression. Interaction or regulation between proteins or
  complexes is shown with arrows (activation) or blunt‐ended lines (inhibition). See
  Supporting Information  for subcellular network versions of panels A and B.
