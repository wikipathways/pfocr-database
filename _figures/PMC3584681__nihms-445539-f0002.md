caption: Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and signaling pathways that lead to
  differentiation of antifungal T helper (Th) cells. Recognition of fungal pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) is mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type
  lectin receptors (CLRs). The binding of fungi or β-glucan to Dectin-1 recruits SYK
  to the two phosphorylated receptors, which leads to the formation of a complex involving
  BCL10, Card9, and MALT1 (BCM). This results in the release of NF-κB, consisting
  of either p65-p50 or REL-p50 dimers, into the nucleus (). Syk activation also induces
  the noncanonical NF-κB pathway mediated by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and the nuclear
  translocation of p52-RELB dimers. Dectin-1 enhances TLR2- and TLR4-induced cytokines
  in a Syk-independent manner through the serine/threonine protein kinase RAF1 by
  Ras proteins, which leads to the phosphorylation of p65 (). These pathways lead
  to the production of, among other cytokines, IL-6 and IL-23, which induce Th17,
  and IL-12, which induces Th1. Dectin-1 recognition of Candidas albicans can also
  activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through a mechanism that involves Syk, ROS, and
  potassium efflux (). Fungus-induced pro-IL-1β is cleaved by active caspase-1 to
  bioactive IL-1β to favor Th17 development. Dectin-2 activation leads to FcR-γ-dependent
  recruitment and phosphorylation of Syk and activated NF-κB and MAPKs (p38, JNK,
  and Erk) (). Card9 is required for the activation of NF-κB and production of cytokines
  that lead to Th17 cell differentiation. However, MAPK activation that occurs independent
  of Card9 does not lead to cytokine production (). Recognition of α-mannose in Malassezia
  species by Mincle activates the FcRγ-Syk-Card9 pathway and translocates NF-κB into
  the nucleus to induce the activation of proinflammatory cytokines (). Asterisk denotes
  that, although fungal PAMPs have not been shown to induce a distinct Th subset by
  this pathway, the mycobacterial cord factor and its synthetic analog are potent
  adjuvants for the differentiation of Mincle-induced Th1 and Th17 cells (). The mannose
  receptor (MR) lacks a classical signaling motif in its short cytoplasmic tail, but
  it induces proinflammatory cytokines that have been implicated in Th17 and Th1 differentiation
  (). Although MR-dependent triggering of human memory T cells produced IL-17, further
  studies with naive T cells will be necessary to demonstrate the role of the MR in
  Th17 cell differentiation (). MyD88 is critical for the signaling of TLR2 and TLR4.
  Upon stimulation with phospholipomannan and O-linked mannan, TLR2 and TLR4, respectively,
  induce proinflammatory signals through the MAL-MyD88-mediated NF-κB and MAPK pathways
  (). TLR2 signaling is thought to generate weaker proinflammatory signals but to
  induce strong stimulation of TGF-β and IL-10 that induces Treg cells (, ). In addition,
  TLR4 triggers the MyD88-independent, TRIF-dependent signaling pathway via TRAM and
  IRF3 to induce type I IFNs.
