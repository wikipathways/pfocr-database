caption: The HBP combines various metabolic inputs to ultimately serve in the synthesis
  of UDP-GlcNAc, the donor substrate for OGT. Approximately 2–3% of cellular glucose
  (Glc) is funneled into the HBP. Glucose is first phosphorylated by hexokinase to
  produce glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) which is then converted into fructose-6-phosphate
  (Fruc-6-P) by phosphoglucose isomerase. Next during the rate-limiting step of the
  pathway, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate (GFAT) converts Fruc-6-P into glucosamine-6-phosphate
  (GlcN-6-P). Then a series of enzymatic steps leads to the production of UDP-GlcNAc,
  which can serve as a negative feedback inhibitor of GFAT. OGT is the enzyme responsible
  for the addition of a single N-acetylglucosamine residue (GlcNAc) to the hydroxyl
  groups of serine and/or threonine residues of target proteins, while OGA serves
  to remove the modification. Flux through the HBP and thus the production of UDP-GlcNAc
  and O-GlcNAcylation are influenced by various disease states including diabetes
  and cancer (purple arrows and teal arrows respectively) via their effects on metabolism
  (glucose “green”, amino acid “red”, fatty acid “orange”, and nucleotide “blue”).
  Insulin resistance resulting in an increase in glucose levels classically marks
  the diabetic condition. This increase in glucose can be funneled into the HBP causing
  an increase in HBP flux and consequently increasing O-GlcNAcylation. Due to cancer
  cells need for energy, a number of metabolites are often in excess and can be funneled
  in the HBP causing flux as well, namely glucose, glutamine, acetyl-CoA, and UTP.Glucosamine
  (Gln) treatment can bypass GFAT and result in an increase in O-GlcNAcylation. The
  HBP can by inhibited or slowed down by a couple mechanisms in addition to its negative
  feedback inhibition by UDP-GlcNAc. Gln treatment can also serve to decrease ATP
  levels thereby activating AMPK, which in turn can inhibit GFAT. Additionally, GFAT
  has two cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) sites at serines 205 and 235.
  Phosphorylation at serine 205 decreases GFAT activity while phosphorylation at serine
  235 has no effect.
