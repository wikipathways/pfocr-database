caption: 'Melanocyte activation integrated in the schematic view of the UV-induced
  pigmentation pathway in the normal skin. Once stimulated by UV light, p53 initiates
  the release by keratinocyte of melanogenic paracrine growth factors and cytokines:
  adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH),α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH),, endothelin-1
  (ET-1),– stem cell factor (SCF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), basic fibroblast
  growth factor (bFGF),, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and granulocyte macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)., The keratinocyte factors further interact with
  their corresponding receptors on melanocytes, and induce melanocyte activation,
  with subsequent stimulation of microphtalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF),
  and its downstream targets, the melanogenic enzymes Tyrosinase (TYR), Tyrosinase-related
  protein 1 (TYRP1), and Dopachrome tautomerase (DCT); this cascade leads to synthesis
  of melanin and melanocyte differentiation (see ). MITF, the master regulator of
  melanogenic pathway, is activated through three signaling pathways regulated by
  cAMP,, protein kinase C (PKC),,, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), to
  subsequently induce proliferation and differentiation of human melanocytes. Figure
  based and modified from [, ]. UVB was shown to induce all keratinocyte factors included
  in the figure. *Factors activated by both UVB and UVA.  was done by the medical
  illustrator Debbie Maizels.'
