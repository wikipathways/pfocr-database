caption: Mechanisms of Gasdermin D activation following canonical and non-canonical
  inflammasome stimulation. Left. Canonical inflammasome activation is a well-structured
  process involving several steps. Upon sensing specific inflammatory stimuli (microbes,
  danger signals, and environmental factors), the inflammasome sensor (i.e., NOD-like
  receptor protein 3, NLRP3) recruits the precursor of caspase-1 (pro-caspase-1) via
  the protein adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC).
  Upon inflammasome complex formation, pro-caspase-1 is activated by autocatalytic
  processing and converts the pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 precursors into their bioactive
  forms. Matured caspase-1 also cleaves the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD),
  generating the N-terminal domain of GSDMD (GSDMD-NT), which relocates to the plasma
  membrane and oligomerizes to form a pore. Pore formation allows the release of mature
  IL-1β and IL-18 and drives a type of inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis.
  Right. The non-canonical inflammasome pathway is activated by intracellular sensing
  of Gram-negative bacteria or lipopolysaccharides (LPS). It involves the activation
  of human caspase 4/5 or caspase-11 in mice. Active caspases directly process the
  pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 precursors and GSDMD. Like the canonical inflammasome activation
  mode, GSDMD pores allow the passive release of IL-1β/IL-18 cytokines and pyroptosis.
