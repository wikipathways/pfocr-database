caption: Wnt/β-catenin-c-Myc-miR-17∼92 axis. In cystic kidney cells, β-catenin escapes
  from degradation in the “Wnt signal-on” state. Free cytoplasmic β-catenin translocates
  to the nucleus and activates the transcription of target genes including c-Myc.
  c-Myc protein translocates into the nucleus and binds to the promoter of the microRNA-17∼92
  (miR-17∼92) cluster, leading to its transcription. In the cytoplasm, mature miR-17
  binds to messenger RNA of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (Pparα),
  a factor known to regulate the expression of key metabolic genes, which in turn
  causes reduced Pparα expression and then restrains mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) metabolism. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity is modulated
  by a number of positive and negative regulators, such as the recruiting of Akt through
  active phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which inhibits tuberous sclerosis complex
  (TSC)1/TSC2, thus subsequently removing the inhibitory effect of TSC complex on
  mTOR and eventually activating mTOR. mTOR initiates its influence on many downstream
  proteins, including p70S6K and 4EBP1, resulting in cell growth. Treatment with RGLS4326
  (a novel oligonucleotide designed to inhibit miR-17) remodels the gene expression
  pattern and is associated with upregulation of mitochondrial metabolism and suppression
  of the mTOR pathway because Pparα is released from repression and expression of
  mTOR, phosphorylated forms of p70S6K, and 4EBP1 is decreased. These ultimately contribute
  to impaired cyst growth.
