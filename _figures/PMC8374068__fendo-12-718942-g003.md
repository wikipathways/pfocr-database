caption: 'Potential cellular targets for metformin that affect healthspan and lifespan.
  The figure depicts how metformin may affect cell aging and indicates a potential
  action in the gut where, prior to absorption, merformin modulates the microbiome
  as well as enhances release of glucagon-like factor 1 (GLP-1). Important links are
  also indicated to the insulin (IRS: Insulin Receptor Substrate) and insulin-like
  growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathways as well as to tumor suppressors including
  p53, and inflammation and cytokine signaling. (PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase);
  (AKT: protein kinase B); (FOXO: Forkhead Box O3); (SIRT1: NAD-dependent deacetylase
  sirtuin-1); (Bax: Bcl-2-associated X protein). As a result of metformin moderating
  the cellular signaling pathways mediated by insulin, IGF-1, and cytokines, both,
  healthspan and lifespan are increased. Metformin also, inhibits the inflammatory
  pathway and increases AMPK activation, which inhibits mTOR, a primary target for
  cell aging modulation. Inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy, cell survival, and protein
  synthesis are all affected by these mechanisms and are all linked to accelerated
  aging.'
