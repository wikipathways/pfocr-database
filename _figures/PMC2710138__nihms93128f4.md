caption: 'Mechanistic model of enhanced activation induced by the E545K mutation in
  p110α. Based on the crystal structure of p110α, the following model has been proposed.
  The wild-type catalytic p110α subunit is stabilized by binding to the p85α-regulatory
  subunit through its p85 binding domain (BD). In addition, its activity is maintained
  at a low state through interaction of its negatively charged helical domain with
  the positively charged N-terminal inter-Src homology 2 (nSH2) domain of p85α. Receptor
  tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation and its subsequent phosphorylation recruits the
  p85α/p110α complex to the membrane, causing conformational changes that relieve
  the charge-inhibitory interactions of p85α on p110α and lead to high transitional
  p110α activity. In the presence of the E545K mutation, the negative charge is converted
  to a positive charge, resulting in the abrogation of the p85α/p110α charge-inhibitory
  interactions, sustained p110α activity at the membrane, and ultimately delayed dissociation
  of the p85α subunit from the phospho-RTK. Abbreviations: cSH2, C-terminal inter-Src
  homology 2; iSH2, inter-Src homology 2; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3—kinase; PIP2,
  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate.
