caption: Schematic representation of molecular mechanisms associated with acylcarnitine
  expression in substantia nigra 3 days post-TBI. Acylcarnitines were found to be
  associated with microglia and are specifically found by MALD MSI, 3 days post-TBI,
  in the subtantia nigra. Spatially resolved proteomics reveals the expression of
  proteins known to be involved in PD. Acylcarnitines are known to activate microglial
  through TLR4/MyD88 pathway leading to inflammatory cytokines and alarmins (Galectin-3).
  GAL-3 is a pro-inflammatory protein known to promote neuron inflammation leading
  to the expression of proteins which were recently shown to be involved in PD (GPR158,
  HMGB1, GAD1). Docking models between HMGB1 and α -synuclein as well as between HMGB1-osteocalcin
  and GPR158 are also presented. This putative physiological pathway could make a
  link between chronic TBI and PD.
