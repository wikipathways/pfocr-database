caption: A paradigm for testing the multiple independent mechanisms that reinforce
  IDO1-mediated immunosuppression in malignant glioma. 1 The high expression of IDO1
  leads to a commensurately high rate of tryptophan conversion and depletion. This
  induces cell cycle arrest and/or anergy in the effector (anti-glioma) T cell compartment
  via the eIF2α kinase GCN2-dependent pathway []. Simultaneously, the same mechanism
  activates Treg to become fully functional/mature in association with CTLA4:CD80/CD86
  co-inhibition []. Although both microglia and macrophages can express IDO1, their
  contribution to this mechanism has yet to be established. 2 A complementary pathway
  mediated by IDO1 produces kynurenine that interacts with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
  (AhR) leading to the expansion of glioma-resident Treg. Recent work has highlighted
  multiple interactions between the Ahr:Kyn. complex that may be required for Treg
  responsiveness. AhR interacts with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator
  (ARNT) to mediate specific transcriptional programming [] that may provide synergistic
  or independent impact to another recently identified heterodimeric partner, FOXO1
  []. 3 The final known pathway that IDO1 utilizes to reinforce immunosuppression
  is via the two intrinsic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs)
  []. Phosphorylation of ITIMs in IDO1 triggers a non-canonical NF-κB pathway, leading
  to phosphorylation of IKKα and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunits, p52
  and RelB; reinforcing immunotolerance and TGF-β production. While it is still unclear
  whether all three of these mechanisms are actively involved in glioma, current studies
  in our laboratory aim to determine the various contributions
