caption: 'Central metabolic pathway proteome at different growth conditions. Comparative
  abundances of (lumped) central metabolic pathway enzymes of E. coli BL21 grown in
  defined medium at exponential phase (A1 and B1) and in rich medium at exponential
  (A2 and B2) and stationary phases (A3 and B3). The thickness of the arrows and dotted
  borders represents the relative (lumped) abundances of enzymes belonging to the
  pathways at these growth conditions. A detailed direct comparison of pathway regulation
  at the proteomic level at different growth conditions (C1, defined versus rich media
  at exponential phase and C2, stationary versus exponential phase in rich medium)
  is given in a pathway map using different color coded arrows for the representation
  of the comparative Log2 ratios of the single enzyme abundances [code given in C1,
  C1: Log2(defined/rich), C2: Log2(stationary/exponential)]. An average of single
  enzyme abundances from cells grown in LB and TB media was calculated to represent
  the single enzyme abundance in cells grown in rich medium. The entire comparative
  proteomic (pathway) data are visualized in Additional file : Figures S7-S9 and the
  corresponding values are given in the Additional file : Table S1. The list of abbreviations
  is found at the end of the Additional file : Figure S9.'
