caption: Putative mechanisms of action of QAC. According to the literature, QAC have
  been reported in contact dermatitis (A) and in asthma (B). They own irritant properties
  (A1,B1), but have also been described as sensitizers (A2,B2). Other reports attribute
  adjuvant effect to QAC (C). (A1) In the irritant induced-contact dermatitis mechanism,
  QAC alter the skin by the production of ROS and the activation of the AA pathway.
  (A2) QAC can also activate the immune system in allergic contact dermatitis, by
  triggering a specific cellular response, with the recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T
  cells in the skin. ILC2 have also been reported in the pathophysiology and anti-QA
  specific IgE have also been described in response to QAC applied on the skin. (B1)
  Asthma symptoms of QAC can be attributed to irritant mechanisms, by the production
  of ROS, epithelial shedding, cell necrosis, the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages
  and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Direct histamine release has also
  been described. (B2) Allergic asthma is mediated by a specific immune response,
  mediated by Th2 lymphocytes, leading to the production of anti-QA specific IgE,
  the degranulation of mast cells and the recruitment of eosinophils. (C). The adjuvant
  effect is described as the increase of the allergenicity of other compounds. AA,
  arachidonic acid; DC, dendritic cell; DLN, draining lymph node; ILC2, type-2 innate
  lymphoid cells; LB, B lymphocytes; LT, T lymphocytes; QA, quaternary ammonium; QAC,
  quaternary ammonium compound; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Th, helper T cell; TSLP,
  thymic stromal lymphopoietin.
