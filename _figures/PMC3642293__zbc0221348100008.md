caption: Upon CpG stimulation, the canonical TLR9 machinery activates NF-κB, resulting
  in Syk-independent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNFα.
  These cytokines are packaged into secretory vesicles after synthesis. CpG also activates
  a Syk-dependent signaling cascade, resulting in calcium release through PLCγ2. Calcium
  binds to CaMKII, leading to its autophosphorylation, a step necessary for activation
  of its downstream targets. This signaling pathway is important for the trafficking
  of intracellular TNFα, but not IL-6, to the plasma membrane. Thus, Syk activation
  downstream of CpG stimulation results in differential trafficking of cytokines.
