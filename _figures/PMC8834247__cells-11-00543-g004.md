caption: Mechanisms of adhesion to the niche. The binding of CXCL12 expressed by mesenchymal
  stromal cells, CARs, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts to CXCR4 expressed by leukemic
  stem cells induces an increase in intracellular calcium ion levels, leading to the
  entrance of LSCs into the vascular or endosteal niche, which in turn induces prosurvival
  and proliferative signaling pathway mobilization. Bone remodeling is responsible
  for the high extracellular calcium level, which enables the binding of calcium to
  the CaRs expressed by LSCs, thus helping the cells adhere to the niche. RA present
  in the BM microenvironment can bind to its RARs expressed on LSCs, inducing the
  regulation of LSC growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune
  response; however, RAR activity can be modulated by CaMKII. The hypoxic environment
  of the BM seems to have proliferation-inducing and prosurvival effects on AML cells
  and upregulates CXCR4 expression on blasts, allowing them to adhere to the niche.
