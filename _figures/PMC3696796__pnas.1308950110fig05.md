caption: Schematic depiction of LB-205 effects on NGF stimulated pathways. (A) LB-205
  inhibits HDACs and increases acetylation of histones by histone acetyltransferases
  (HATs), which play a key role in regulating gene expression in the nucleus. Activated
  PI3K initiates the p-AKT pathway, which acts through NF-κB transcriptional modification
  and other targets to alter expression of NGF, TrkA, and NF-κB to promote cell survival,
  growth, and proliferation. In addition, BAX is blocked through increased Bcl-2 expression,
  inhibiting the apoptosis pathway. (B) Without LB-205 treatment, decreased NGF and
  increased p75(NTR) expression post-TBI induce p-JNK through the p75(NTR) receptor-mediated
  pathway and subsequent release of apoptosis associated factors from the mitochondria,
  triggering the caspase cascade through BAX activation, inducing cell apoptosis,
  and impairing the CNS injury repair response.
