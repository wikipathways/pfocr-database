caption: Diagram of the intracellular signaling pathways downstream of p75NTR and
  TrkA in sensory neurons. p75NTR plays an essential role in supporting NGF-triggered
  TrkA signaling pathways mediating neuropathic pain. After nerve injury, NGF is produced
  in damaged tissue and increases p75NTR expression in spared sensory neurons. p75NTR
  then interacts with the TrkA receptor and facilitates the ability of TrkA to respond
  to NGF. This enhanced TrkA signaling in sensory neurons increases the expression
  of TRPV1 and TRPA1 through the p38 MAPK pathway, increasing heat and cold hyperalgesia.
  Previous studies have demonstrated that both anti-NGF and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580
  not only reverse heat and cold hyperalgesia, but also diminish the induction of
  TRPV1 and TRPA1 in the spared DRG (; , ). The present study demonstrated that blockade
  of p75NTR also attenuated injury-induced hyperalgesia and upregulation of TRPV1
  and TRPA1.
