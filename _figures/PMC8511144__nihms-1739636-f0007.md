caption: Proposed mechanisms of CCh and PE-stimulated secretion of CTSS in LGAC. CTSS
  is enriched in both endolysosomes and SV in LGAC. CCh activates signaling through
  the MAChR in mouse LG leading to a large increase in intracellular calcium. We propose
  that the drastically increased intracellular calcium triggers (1) homotypic fusion
  between Rab3D-enriched SV and (2) fusion of primed Rab3D-enriched SV fusion with
  the APM. Other downstream events activated by M3AChR engagement which may be involved
  in priming of Rab3D-enriched SV include activation of phospholipase C β (PLC β)
  and protein kinase C (PKC) α, ε, and δ isoforms, and the formation of diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3)(). The stimulation of α1-adrenergic
  receptors with PE evokes a much smaller release in intracellular calcium associated
  with limited compound fusion and exocytosis of Rab3D-enriched SVs (3). (4) Other
  signaling mediators such as NO or cGMP may evoke increased recruitment of endolysosomes
  to the APM followed by their fusion, leading to increased release of CTSS and likely
  other endolysosomal markers. This pathway may be mediated by Rab27a.
