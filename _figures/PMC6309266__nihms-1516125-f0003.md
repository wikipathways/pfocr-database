caption: TGF-β upregulated miR-21 inhibits cancer cell apoptosis via posttranscriptional
  repression of proteins such as MSH2 and PDCD4, which are known to induce apoptosis,
  whereas miR-494 upregulated by TGF-β promotes proliferation of cancer cells. TGF-β
  downregulated miR-34a also promotes cancer cell proliferation. TGF-β upregulated
  lincRNAs have been shown to play opposing roles in cancer cell apoptosis. For example,
  linc-ROR promotes apoptosis whereas lincRNA-Smad7 inhibits apoptosis of cancer cells.
  LincRNA-HOX-D AS1 upregulated by TGF-β activated PI3/Akt promotes angiogenesis.
  miRNAs are denoted by blue ovals, black arrow and lines denote miRNA-mediated regulations
  of target genes, and lincRNAs are denoted by red rectangles, and red arrows and
  lines denote lincRNA-mediated control of the EMT process. Transcription factors
  are denoted by yellow rounded rectangles and canonical TGF-β pathway members such
  as Smads and non-canonical TGF-β members such as PI3/Akt, JNK and ERK1/2 are denoted
  by light blue or yellow rectangles and light green respectively.
