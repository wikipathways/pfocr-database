caption: Figure 8. Primer quality affects PRR pathway choice. The cartoon depicts
  the inherent differences between pol1–1 and mcm10–1 mutants in PRR pathway dynamics.
  (Left) In pol1–1, intrinsically inaccurate primer synthesis by the Pol1–1 enzyme
  leads to mismatches unsuitable for pol-δ extension. These primers are likely extended,
  at least initially, by pol-ζ, which is efficient in adding to terminal mismatches.
  It is possible that mismatched primers are also unsuitable to initiate template
  switching, explaining why the Rad5-dependent error-free pathway is not efficiently
  utilized in these mutants. (Right) Primers in mcm10–1 are synthesized by a wild-type
  Pol1 enzyme, allowing for engagement in template switching, which promotes cell
  survival. The dashed line denotes the actual switch from the lagging strand template
  to the nascent leading strand. *Although the translesion polymerase pol-ζ is activated
  in both pol1–1 and mcm10–1 mutants, it does not impact survival of either strain.
