caption: Parallels between 5′-end-dependent mRNA degradation pathways in eukaryotes
  and E. coli. In eukaryotes, cap removal by mRNA-decapping enzyme subunit 2 (Dcp2)
  bound to Dcp1 triggers mRNA decay (). The activity of Dcp2 is modulated by several
  protein factors, including Enhancer of mRNA Decapping (Edc1) (). The decapped RNA
  is then degraded by 5′-3′ exoribonuclease 1 (XRN1). In E. coli, the corresponding
  pathway begins with stepwise removal of the γ and β phosphates of a triphosphorylated
  transcript by the consecutive action of an unidentified enzyme and RppH (). RppH
  activity is stimulated by its interaction with the metabolic enzyme DapF. The resulting
  monophosphorylated RNA 5′ end potentiates internal cleavage by the endonuclease
  RNase E.
