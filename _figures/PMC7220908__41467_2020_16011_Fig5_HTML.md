caption: Pathways from the KEGG database that were most relevant for describing the
  classes are shown. We ranked the mean proportion of genes in each pathway (see Supplementary
  Results ), indicated by the size of the circles (Fig. ). Only classes with significant
  pairwise post hoc comparisons are shown. P. putida (grey) and Serratia (blue) classes
  appear to dominate orthogonal pathways. We therefore indicated how the pathways
  were influenced by the dominant community (indicated by the arrow colour). The link
  between the TCA cycle and amino-acid synthesis (black arrow) is unclear. We further
  illustrate the substrates and hypothetical environmental conditions expected for
  Serratia (rain/cold) and P. putida (dry/hot) communities. We suggest the other communities
  are intermediates between these two classes. The Paenibacillus class, with a large
  number of sporulation and germination genes, may reflect conditions of very low
  nutrient availability.
