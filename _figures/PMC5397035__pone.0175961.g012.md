caption: As a result of FcγR clustering, two separate pathways lead to phagocytosis,
  through a calcium independent way, or to the oxidative burst in a calcium dependent
  manner. Syk induce the activation of Vav and the downstream signaling that lead
  to the phagocytosis process. The main pathway for the activation of the oxidative
  burst consist in the activation of Btk by Syk and the consequent phosphorylation
  of PLCγ2. PLCγ2 activated produce DAG and IP3 from PIP3. DAG directly activate PKC
  while IP3 bind IP3R on endoplasmic reticulum inducing Ca2+ mobilization that lead
  to PKC activation and finally to the oxidative burst. The lack of BTK in XLA patients
  is effectively bypassed by the direct stimulation of PLCγ2 by Syk. The inhibition
  of Ca2+ mobilization by BAPTA-AM strongly reduce the oxidative burst. PMA is able
  to bind PKC to the same binding site of DAG and bypass both the production of DAG
  and the calcium flux from endoplasmic reticulum.
