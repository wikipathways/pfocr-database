caption: Caffeine metabolism pathway and metabolites. Caffeine is primarily metabolized
  in the liver, undergoing demethylation and oxidation. The main route of caffeine
  metabolism in humans is via CYP1A2 catalyzed N-3 demethylation to paraxanthine (around
  84%), N-1 demethylation to theophylline (around 8%) and N-7 demethylation to theobromine
  (around 8%). Other than theobromine, paraxanthine, and theophylline, the major metabolites
  in urine are 3-methylxanthine, 1-methylxanthine, 1-methyl uric acid, 5-acetylamine-6-formylamine-3-methyluracil
  (AFMU), 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil, 1,7-dimethyl uric acid and 3,7-dimethyl
  uric acid, which are secondary metabolites of theobromine, paraxanthine, and theophylline
  catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2A6, N-acetyltransferase 2 and xanthine oxidase
