caption: Contribution of microglial cells to vascular development in the retina. (A)
  The activation of the MAS receptor is involved in the recruitment of microglia and
  vascular growth in the developing retina by activating the Notch signaling pathway.
  (A’) Microglial cells secrete CD95L that binds to its receptor CD95 on endothelial
  cells. The phosphorylation of the death domain by Src-family kinase results in the
  activation of PI3K signaling pathways, leading to the activation of AKT or ERK (A’’).
