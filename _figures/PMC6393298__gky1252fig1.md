caption: Schematic of a RecBCD-dependent repair of a double-strand break and a genomic
  rearrangement that might result. (A) i. The dsDNA sequences are identical. The DSB
  is indicated by the gray arrow. ii. The bright green triangles indicate the Chi
  sites on each strand that are oriented so that they would be recognized by RecBCD
  as it proceeds along the dsDNA from the DSB. The Lχleft and Lχright are the separations
  between the position of the DSB and the nearest appropriately oriented Chi site
  on each initiating strand. iii. RecBCD creates the two initiating ssDNAs, while
  the complementary strands are degraded or looped (dotted circles). Lleft and Lright
  are the distances separating the DSB from the 3′ end of each initiating strand.
  Note that Lleft ≥ Lχleft and Lright ≥ Lχright. iv. RecA mediated strand exchange
  creates heteroduplex products that reach the 3′ ends of the filaments. v. DNA polymerase
  (orange rectangles) extends both initiating ssDNAs by copying the complementary
  strands beginning at the 3′ end of an initiating strand in a RecA filament. (B)
  The red and blue lines represent two identical dsDNAs that include two copies of
  a repeated sequence, Copy 1 and Copy 2 separated by a non-repeated region. i. A
  DSB occurs near the center of Copy 1.ii. After the DSB, RecBCD creates two ssDNA–RecA
  filaments by loading RecA onto the initiating ssDNA created by RecBCD. The two ssDNA–RecA
  filaments are indicated by the green horizontal arrows pointing toward the 3′ end.
  iii. Both filaments pair with the sequence matched regions in Copy 2 and form sequence
  matched heteroduplex products that extend to the 3′ ends of the initiating strands.
  DNA synthesis then completes two dsDNAs. The sequence region that includes the heteroduplex
  products and the newly synthesized DNA is shown in purple. The completion of the
  dsDNA is followed by Holliday junction resolution that is a crossover on the right
  side. As a result, the upper dsDNA lacks the sequence region between the two copies,
  and the lower dsDNA has two copies of the region between the two repeats. The duplicated
  regions are highlighted by the yellow rectangles. (C) Schematic of a DSB that occurs
  in Copy 1 of a repeated sequence. The appropriately oriented Chi sites are indicated
  by the bright green triangles, and the direction of RecBCD is shown by the black
  arrows. Copy 1 only includes appropriately oriented Chi sites in the dark red strand,
  so only the dark red strand can terminate in a region of Copy 1. (D) Same as C),
  but the DSB occurs to the left of Copy 1, which changes the number of correctly
  oriented Chi site in this region. The light pink filament cannot include a region
  of Copy 1 because RecBCD moves away from the DSB. (E) In a different sequence than
  C), Copy 1 includes appropriately oriented Chi sites on both strands, allowing the
  rearrangement shown in B); however, this never occurs in any of the 12 enteric bacteria
  we studied in this work.
