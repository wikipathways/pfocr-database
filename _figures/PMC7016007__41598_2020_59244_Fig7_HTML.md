caption: Crosstalk of metabolic pathways in AMD. Upregulation of PARP2 expression
  in AMD leads to negative regulation of SIRT1. Depletion of SIRT1 protein, a NAD+
  -dependent deacetylase, results in acetylation and inactivation of PGC-1α. SIRT1
  downregulation leads to TORC1 complex activation in AMD that negatively regulates
  autophagy by phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of Atg13 and ULK1. Activated mTOR
  is also a positive regulator of glycolysis. MAPK3 was downregulated in AMD RPE;
  which can result in higher expression of PMAIP1 mRNA coding NOXA protein. This protein
  promotes mitochondrial membrane changes and efflux of apoptogenic proteins from
  the mitochondria. MDH1, an important gene that plays a role in energy metabolism
  was upregulated in AMD RPE cells. This cytosolic isozyme plays a key role in the
  malate-aspartate shuttle that allows malate to pass through the mitochondrial membrane.
  It also performs NAD/NADH-dependent reversible oxidation of oxaloacetate to malate.
  The activity of the energy sensor protein kinase, AMPK, was reduced in AMD RPE cells,
  which may lead to dysregulation of catabolic and anabolic processes, and to further
  downregulation of PGC1α and SIRT1. Proteins are shown according to their localization
  in the cell (nucleus, mitochondria, cytoplasm). Blue arrows indicate regulation
  of expression; green arrows indicate protein modification or binding; dash arrows
  show indirect regulation, and black arrows represent direct regulation. The green
  color of protein or cellular process indicates downregulation in AMD vs. normal
  RPE cells. The red color of protein or cellular process indicates upregulation in
  AMD vs. normal RPE. The pathway analysis was performed using Pathway Studio.
