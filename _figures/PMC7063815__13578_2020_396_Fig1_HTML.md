caption: 'The relationship between mTOR and tumors. Overactivation of mTORC1 can promote
  tumor formation, proliferation, and metastasis, while mTORC2 can regulate the expression
  of mTORC1 through the mTORC2/AKT/TSC/Rehb pathway. Pathway 1: The extracellular
  growth signals and intracellular LKB1 mutations activate mTORC1, which reduces the
  ubiquitination of histone H2A and H2A after DNA damage by phosphorylating RNF168.
  This can lead to damage to DNA repair and promote the formation of tumors. Pathway
  2: The ubiquitination of Rheb reduces Rheb activity by promoting Rheb binding to
  TSC2. The down-regulation of Rehb reduces the activation of mTORC1, leading to the
  inhibition of tumor growth. Pathway 3: TRAF2 and Otud7B respectively regulate mTORC1/2
  activity by up-regulating or down-regulating the ubiquitination level of G beta
  L of mTORC2. TRAF2 enhanced the activity of mTORC1 and inhibited the activity of
  mTORC2. Although down-regulation of mTORC2 expression inactivates the AKT/TSC/Rehb/mTORC1
  pathway, overall mTORC1 activity is enhanced. However, Otud7B has the opposite effect
  on TRAF2. Pathway 4: Mutated Ras binds mTOR and MAPKAP1 of mTORC2 to promote mTORC2
  expression. The up-regulation of mTORC2 promotes tumor proliferation through the
  AKT/TSC/Rehb/mTORC1 pathway. Pathway 5: Deletion of the PTEN gene induces the expression
  of B7-H1 to increase tumor progression and invasion. Pathway 6: The PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR
  pathway is involved in the invasion and metastasis of liver cancer by up-regulating
  MMP-9'
