caption: A scheme showing proposed metabolic pathways for LCA in mice. The dark arrows
  indicate the major metabolic pathway. The number in the parenthesis indicates the
  average concentration of individual BAs in mouse livers. LCA (0.1→3.1) means that
  LCA was increased from 0.1 to 3.1 nmol/g in livers of male mice fed LCA. BA, bile
  acid; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; HDCA, hyodeoxycholic acid; LCA, lithocholic acid;
  MDCA, murideoxycholic acid; TCDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid; THCA, taurohyocholic
  acid; THDCA, taurohyodeoxycholic acid; TLCA, taurolithocholic acid; TLCAS, taurolithocholic
  acid sulfate; TαMCA, tauro-α-muricholic acid; TMDCA, tauromurideoxycholic acid.
