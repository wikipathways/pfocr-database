caption: Workflow from natural product discovery to enzyme utility in accessing complex
  molecules. The example shown illustrates the chronological order of research on
  platensimycin (PTM), from molecule discovery [] to biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC)
  identification [] to enzyme characterization []. This directly enabled the use of
  an enzyme from this pathway (PtmO6) in the synthesis of the complex natural products
  mitrekaurenone, pharboside aglycone, and fujenoic acid []. Pink dots represent carbons
  that are functionalized by PtmO6.
