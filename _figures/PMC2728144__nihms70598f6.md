caption: Schematic diagram depicting our findings on the post-transcriptional regulation
  of CXCR4 in MCF7-HER2 cells as a result of estrogen and HER2 cross-talk and the
  involvement of activated PI3K and MAPK pathways and TSC2 (tuberin). Disruption of
  TSC1 and TSC2 interaction is known to activate the mTOR pathway which phosphorylates
  two key downstream proteins, 4E-BP1 and p70 S6 kinase, which are responsible for
  increased translation and protein synthesis. Inhibitors used to assess involvement
  of different components of these pathways are indicated. See  for further details.
