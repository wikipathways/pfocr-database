caption: (A) The exon 4-excluded transcripts encode full length functional SRSF3.
  The exon 4-included transcripts were degraded via the NMD pathway, or may produce
  truncated SRSF3. In normal cells, SRSF3 regulates its own expression by inhibiting
  the exclusion of exon 4. (B) In cancer cells, overexpressed PTBP1 and PTBP2 bind
  to ESS motif and impair inclusion of exon 4, which then increases the expression
  of full length SRSF3 and promotes cell proliferation and transformation. Meantime,
  SRSF3, in turn, also promotes the expression of PTBP2.
