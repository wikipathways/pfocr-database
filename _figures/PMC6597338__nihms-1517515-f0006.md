caption: Model for the cellular mechanisms underlying the rapid antidepressant-like
  actions of ketamine. Ketamine induces a rapid glutamate burst via blockade of NMDA
  receptors located on GABAergic interneurons and the resulting disinhibition. This
  stimulates postsynaptic AMPA receptors, which causes depolarization and activation
  of L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs), leading to stimulation of BDNF
  and VEGF release. BDNF and VEGF stimulate TrkB and Flk-1, respectively, and the
  activation of TrkB and Flk-1 stimulates not only the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mechanistic
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, but also release of Ca2+ from intracellular
  stores via activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), which stimulates hetelorogous
  release of the other factor. The PI3k/Akt/mTORC1 pathway controls dendritic arborization
  and the translation and synthesis of synaptic proteins, including GluA1 and postsynaptic
  density protein 95 (PSD95), which are required for increases in synaptogenesis and
  spine maturation. These cellular events are associated with the rapid and sustained
  antidepressant-like actions of ketamine. Previous studies demonstrate that BDNF
  and VEGF also induce further glutamate release via presynaptic TrkB and Flk-1, respectively,
  resulting in further activity-dependent release of these trophic factors (see ).
