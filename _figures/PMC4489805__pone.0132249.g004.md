caption: Expression pattern and interaction of SDEG involved in canonical IFN signaling
  pathway in the cavitary granulomas with numerous (A) or scanty (B) AFB. For both
  (A) and (B), the up-regulated SDEG are in red and down-regulated SDEG are in green
  and the intensity of the color is proportional to their expression level (i.e.,
  stronger expression is represented as dark shades).
