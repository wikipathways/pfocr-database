caption: Molecular mechanisms of p53 loss of heterozygosity in breast cancer in response
  to DNA damage. Proposed model for the role of mutp53 in promoting tumorigenesis.
  Following DNA damage, p53 expression is induced. Wtp53 would induce cell-cycle arrest
  and suppression of the mTOR pathway. On the other hand, mutp53 would promote cell-cycle
  progression with unrepaired DNA, LOH and cell survival via activation of the mTOR
  pathway through HSF1-HS90 axis, eventually leading to genomic instability, tumor
  progression, and metastasis.
