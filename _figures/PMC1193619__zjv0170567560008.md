caption: Schematic representation of the putative signaling cascades mediating G2/M
  cell cycle arrest induced by Vpr protein. Previously described pathways, including
  those described by Zimmerman et al. (*) (), who reported the involvement of the
  ATR-Chk1-mediated checkpoint pathway; Goh et al. (**) (), who reported the direct
  inhibition of Cdc25C by Vpr; and Ussar and Voss (***) (), who reported that the
  MEK2 knockdown results in centrosome amplification and multipolar spindle formation
  through reduced phosphorylation of RSK, are indicated. In our model, blockade of
  MEK2 activity also leads to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint by decreasing
  ERK phosphorylation and abolishing the ability of the cells to recover from the
  G2/M checkpoint arrest.
