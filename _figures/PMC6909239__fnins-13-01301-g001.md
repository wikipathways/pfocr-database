caption: The Astrocyte to Neuron Lactate Shuttle. Astrocytes take up glucose from
  the blood capillaries via glucose transporters (GLUTs). In astrocytes, glucose is
  either stored as glycogen or metabolized to pyruvate in the glycolysis. Pyruvate
  is then converted to lactate by the oxidoreductase lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoform
  5 (LDH5). The lactate is transferred from astrocytes to neurons by the monocarboxylate
  transporters (MCTs) MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 in cotransport with a proton. MCT transport
  activity was found to be facilitated by interaction with the carbonic anhydrases
  (CAs) CAII and CAIV, which catalyze the equilibrium of H+, HCO3– and CO2 both intra-
  and extracellularly, and by the activity of the electrogenic sodium-bicarbonate
  cotransporter NBCe1. In neurons, lactate is converted back to pyruvate by LDH1 and
  transferred into mitochondria for aerobic energy production in the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA). In addition, glucose is directly taken up into neurons where it
  can either serve as energy source in the glycolysis or is shuttled into the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) for production of NADPH and cellular building blocks like
  ribose-6-phosphate.
