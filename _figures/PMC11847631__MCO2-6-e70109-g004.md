caption: "Schematic diagram of the expression of inflammatory mediators induced by
  pathogen invasion. Liposaccharide (LPS) and Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) are representatives
  of a concept that pathogens are recognized by a group of receptors called pattern
  recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect pathogen‐associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs) or damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). After PRRs recongnize PAMPs
  or DAMPs, the NF‐\U0001D6CBB signaling pathway is activated through TLR or NLR,
  kinase cascades, I\U0001D6CBB degradation, and NF‐\U0001D6CBB nuclear translocation,
  resulting in production of inflammatory mediators. This process is considered to
  be a key mechanism initiating the systemic inflammatory response in sepsis"
