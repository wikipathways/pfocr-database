caption: Tumor microenvironment-induced T cell stemness. (A) High K+ levels in the
  tumor microenvironment promote T cell stemness. High K+ leads to an increase in
  AcCoA within mitochondria while decreasing it in the nucleus, inducing autophagy
  and histone hypoacetylation. These alterations in gene expression reduce T cell
  differentiation into effector T cells by inhibiting the TCR signaling pathway. The
  inhibition of TCR by high K+ primarily occurs through reduced phosphorylation of
  Akt-targeted serine/threonine residues upon TCR activation. (B) Elevated lactate
  in the tumor microenvironment induces T cell stemness by increasing acetylation
  levels at the H3K27 locus within the TCF-1 gene during CD8+ T cell differentiation.
  This elevated acetylation preserves cellular stemness. (C) T cell stemness induced
  by high H+ levels in the tumor microenvironment. Elevated FAO results in increased
  AcCoA levels, leading to TCR inhibition, reduced T cell activation, and inhibition
  of methionine synthase MTR, thereby decreasing methionine synthesis. This reduction
  further lowers the synthesis of SAM and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAM is a critical
  methyl donor for DNA and histone methylation reactions. The decreased methylation
  levels, particularly the histone marker H3K27me3, enhance TCF-1 expression.
