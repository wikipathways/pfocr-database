caption: Effect of exosomes on macrophage differentiation. Toll-like receptor recruitment
  MyD88 mediates the activation of TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6). TRAF6
  promotes AP-1 signaling or NF-κB activity via the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. The
  IKK complex mediates the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα, while
  the IKKα dimer mediates the phosphorylation and degradation of p100, both of which
  can produce active NF-κB. Exosomes containing oxidized phospholipids activate Toll-like
  receptors and promote the production of active NF-κB. Inflammatory cytokines in
  exosomes bind to cytokine receptors, triggering the classical NF-κB pathway, activating
  TAK1, and inducing NF-κB activity. Exosomes containing miR-106b or lncRNA Hotair
  and those that are mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived promote IκBα phosphorylation.
  Exosomes containing miR-223 inhibit the phosphorylation of p100 by IKKα.
