caption: 'This calcification-related model is suggested based on previously reported
  studies [, , , ]. The ABC family transporters (yellow, upper-left) were mostly included
  in the ‘secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism’ of the KOG-enriched
  cluster. The LTRPC family cation channel (JGI ID 460292) and Ca2+-pump (JGI ID 466567)
  (red, upper-middle) were up- and down-regulated, respectively, at the ambient Ca2+
  concentration relative to limited Ca2+ concentrations. Furthermore the HCO3- transporter
  solute carrier 4 families (JGI ID 436956, 466232) (green, upper-right) are described
  in this study. The delta CA (JGI ID 195575) (dark red, upper-right) was the only
  up-regulated carbonic anhydrase in this study. The gene expression of the fibrillins
  and related proteins containing Ca2+-binding EGF-like domains (JGI ID 118025, 463266)
  (orange, upper right-hand corner) was also up-regulated at ambient Ca2+ concentration
  relative to the limited Ca2+ concentrations. The eukaryotic translation initiation
  factors (eIFs) (eIF4A: JGI ID 312754, eIF2α: JGI ID 366908) (orange, lower-right)
  were up-regulated at the ambient Ca2+ concentration relative to the limited Ca2+
  concentrations as well. The eIFs have the potential to regulate the signaling pathway
  related to calcification at different calcium concentrations. The molecular chaperones
  (orange, lower-middle) BiP (JGI ID 442092), BCS1 (JGI ID 369425) and Ero1 (JGI ID
  461210) are also possible factors in the calcification process.'
