caption: After infecting a host cell, RNA viruses replicate their RNA, which contains
  5′-triphosphate and double-stranded segments that are recognized by the cytosolic
  sensor protein RIG-I. RIG-I contains an RNA helicase domain and a C-terminal domain
  (CTD) that bind to viral RNA. The RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis induce the translocation
  of RIG-I on the RNA and a conformational change that exposes the N-terminal CARD
  domains, which recruit the ubiquitin E3 TRIM25 to synthesize unanchored K63 polyubiquitin
  chains. These ubiquitin chains bind to the CARD domains of RIG-I, enabling RIG-I
  to induce a prion-like aggregation of MAVS on the mitochondrial membrane. The MAVS
  aggregates then activate IKK and TBK1 through K63 polyubiquitination that involves
  the E2 Ubc5 and E3s such as TRAFs or MIB1/2. IKK and TBK1 activate NF-κB and IRF3,
  respectively, which enter the nucleus to induce type-I interferons and other antiviral
  molecules.
