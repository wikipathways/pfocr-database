caption: Main metabolic pathways related to myo-inositol transformation inside the
  cell. Myo-Ins is obtained from external sources (food) and produced by a biosynthetic
  pathway departing from glucose (Glu) and glucose-6-phosphate (Glu6p). Under the
  catalytic activity of myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase 1 (MIPS1)—encoded by the
  ISYNA1 gene—Glu6p is converted into inositol-1-phosphate (InsP1) and then dephosphorylated
  to myo-Ins under the action of inositol monophosphatase-1 (IMPA). Myo-Ins activates
  p53 synthesis, which in turn reinforce ISYNA1 expression, according to a positive
  regulatory loop. Myo-Ins can be converted into scyllo-Ins (sINS) or D-chiro-inositol
  (DCI) under the action of an insulin-dependent, tissue-specific epimerase. D-chiro-Ins
  and myo-Ins are incorporated as inositol phosphoglycan (IPG) in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
  proteins (GPI). Myo-Ins can be converted into phosphatidylinositol (PI) under the
  activity of phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS) in presence of CDP-diacylglycerol—inositol
  3-phosphatidyltransferase (CDP). The intervention of phosphatidyl-inositol kinase-4
  (PI4K) leads to the synthesis of phospathidyl-inositol-4,5-phosphate (PIP2). PIP2
  is transformed by phospholipase-C (PLC) into 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG)—that in turn
  activates protein kinase C (PKC)–and 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). By binding to
  specific InsP3-receptors, InsP3 induces calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER). PIP2 can be converted to phosphatidylinositol- 3,4,5 –trisphosphate (PIP3)
  by the activity of the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). PIP3 formation
  is antagonized by the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which acts by removing
  a phosphate group. PIP3 promotes the recruitment of (Akt) close to the membrane
  where the activity of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) catalyzes
  the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) to produce pAkt.
  InsP3 can be de-phosphorylated by inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (INPP), yielding
  inositol-2-phosphate (InsP2) and probably inositol-1-phosphate (InsP1). Alternatively,
  InsP3 can be phosphorylated by inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) into inositol-4-phosphate
  (InsP4), inositol-5-phosphate (Insp5), and finally, into inositol-6-phosphate (InsP6).
  From here, the sequential intervention of other kinases (inositol hexakisphosphate
  kinase 1-2-3, IP6K1-2-3; in yeast, DIPP = diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase;
  inositol hexakisphosphate and diphosphoinositol-pentakisphosphate kinase, PPIP5K)
  several pyrophosphates (diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate, IP7 and bis-diphosphoinositol
  tetrakisphosphate, IP8) are produced. Noticeably, IP6K1 inhibits p53.
