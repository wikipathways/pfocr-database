caption: Growth factors mediated mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation. The stimulation of
  growth factor receptors by their ligands leads to the activation of PI3K wich catalyzes
  the formation of phosphoinositide-3,4,5-tri-phosphate (PIP3). This triggers the
  translocation of Akt to the membrane where it gets activated by the phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1). In addition, the activation of Akt requires the phosphorylation
  by mTORC2. Once activated Akt positively regulates mTORC1 by either inhibiting PRAS40
  or TSC2, two negative regulators of mTORC1. mTORC2 activation requires its association
  to the ribosomes which is enhanced by PI3K activity. Finally, the lipid phosphatase
  PTEN acts as a negative regulator of this pathway by converting PIP3 into PIP2.
