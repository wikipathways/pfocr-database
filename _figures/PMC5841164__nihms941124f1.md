caption: PTEN signaling in Treg cells. The canonical PTEN-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway
  plays a central role in maintaining the identity of Treg cells and their lineage
  stability. PTEN antagonizes PI3K-mediated generation of the second messenger, PIP3,
  and subsequent AKT phosphorylation. Upon TCR engagement, activated AKT phosphorylates
  FOXO proteins (such as FOXO1) and prevents them from entering the nucleus. Nuclear
  exclusion of FOXO proteins abrogates their transcriptional activity as a partner
  for FOXP3, leading to Treg instability. Checkpoint molecules that mediate the PD-1-CK2-PTEN
  pathway and the NRP1-PTEN pathway help maintain the level of PTEN in Tregs. The
  PD-1 suppressive signal reduces the expression of CK2, which prevents CK2-mediated
  PTEN degradation. NRP1 is highly expressed on natural Treg cells. Upon interaction
  of NRP1 with its ligand, semaphorin-A, PTEN is recruited to the immunological synapse
  to antagonize PI3K and promote Treg stability.
