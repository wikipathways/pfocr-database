caption: GOLPH3 regulates the spatial distribution of glycosyltransferases within
  the Golgi cisternae. (a) Schematic diagram depicting the role of GOLPH3 in GSL synthesis.
  GOLPH3 localizes at the trans-Golgi through its interaction with locally synthesized
  PI(4)P. GOLPH3 simultaneously interacts with the COPI coat and the cytoplasmic tails
  of specific glycosyltransferases, thereby mediating retrograde transport of these
  enzymes into COPI-coated vesicles. Synthesis of complex GSLs requires action of
  several Golgi glycosyltransferases. LCS is one such enzyme and converts glucosylceramide
  to lactosylceramide. GOLPH3 acts as a component of the cisternal maturation mechanism
  and controls the balance between the sub-Golgi localization and the lysosomal degradation
  rate for LCS and other specific enzymes. GSLs, synthesized at the Golgi, are transported
  to the plasma membrane where they activate tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) and
  integrins. By enhancing the rate of enzyme retention in the Golgi, GOLPH3 promotes
  biosynthesis of GSLs, which, in turn, promotes cell growth through PI3K-Akt-mTOR
  signaling (blue circle, glucose; yellow circle, galactose; red square, sialic acid).
  (b) Schematic diagram depicting the role of GOLPH3 in integrin sialylation. GOLPH3
  accumulation at the trans-Golgi requires binding to PI(4)P, that is generated by
  phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-IIα [PI(4)KIIα]-mediated phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol
  (PI). PI(4)P-GOLPH3 forms a complex with α2,6-sialyltransferase-I (ST6GAL1) which
  is essential for sialylation of integrins. Proper sialylation of integrins activates
  the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. The integrin β1 downstream effector FAK stabilizes
  [PI(4)KIIα], ensuring PI(4)P accumulation at the trans-Golgi. In addition, by mediating
  ST6GAL1 incorporation into COPI-coated vesicles, GOLPH3 controls the correct distribution
  of sialyltransferases within the Golgi cisternae (red square, sialic acid; blue
  square, N-acetylglucosamine; green circle, mannose; yellow circle, galactose)
