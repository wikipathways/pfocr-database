caption: Model for AtWDR26s role in plant growth and defense response. AtWDR26 is
  one component in the signaling pathway controlling light-regulated growth and development.
  AtWDR26 could modulate auxin signaling through chloroplast function modification.
  Auxin signal can act downstream to regulate the adaptation response to light stress,
  as it modulates cellular pathways in cell wall flexibility and Zn homeostasis. Auxin
  also controls the ET/JA-mediated transcription regulation, which in turn governed
  by AP2/ERF transcription factors.
