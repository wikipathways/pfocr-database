caption: Enhancement of epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the loss of
  N‐myc downstream‐regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) activity. Because loss of NDRG2 expression
  has been reported to promote cancer development and metastasis, we conducted animal
  studies in an oral cancer model using NDRG2‐deficient mice. In Ndrg2‐deficient mice,
  the treatment of carcinogenic compound 4‐nitroquinoline‐1‐oxide (4‐NQO) induces
  development of oral cancer and cervical lymph node metastasis, which enhances the
  activation of the PI3K/AKT and nuclear factor kappa B (NF‐κB) signaling pathways
  via enhanced phosphorylation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
  10 (PTEN) by downregulating NDRG2. Activation of the NF‐κB signaling pathway promotes
  EMT via the upregulation of twist family bHLH transcription factors (TWIST) and
  SNAIL family of transcriptional repressors (SNAIL) transcription, which induces
  metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) because intercell adhesion is
  lost and motility is increased. Therefore, reduced NDRG2 expression contributes
  to cancer development and metastasis by regulation of EMT. This figure has been
