caption: '(A) Transduction of platinum-induced DNA damage: DNA repair or apoptosis.
  DNA-platinum adducts can result in DNA damage and replication fork stalling. This
  leads to the activation of PI3K-like kinases ATM and CHK, which induces activation
  of p53 resulting in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Cell cycle arrest and activation
  of ATM can initiate DAN damage repair. If the repair fails, the apoptosis will still
  happen. (B) Main repair pathways involved in platinum-induced DNA damage repair
  in breast cancer. DNA-platinum adducts can result in SSB and/or DSB breaks and stalled
  replication forks. MRN complex senses the DSBs and subsequently recruits ATM, which
  induces the following steps in error-free HR. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are main components
  in HR pathway. BRCA1 controls DSB resection and facilitates the transition from
  DSB resection to BRCA2-mediated RAD51 loading. SSBs are mainly repaired by BER pathway
  requiring PARP in breast cancer. FA pathway is important for replication-coupled
  repair of ICLs. If the repair is successful, the cancer cell will proliferate. If
  any part of these repair pathways changes, the repair will probably fail followed
  by apoptosis. Pt: platinum; CHK: checkpoint effector kinase; ATM: ataxia-telangiectasia
  mutated; SSB: single strand break; DSB: double strand break; BER: base excision
  repair; APE1: apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1; PARP: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase;
  MRN: MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 complex; PALB2: partner and localizer of BRCA2; FA: Fanconi
