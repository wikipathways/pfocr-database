caption: (1) The genomic AR signalling involves androgen crossing the plasma membrane,
  entering the cytoplasm, dissociation of chaperone proteins and binding to the AR.
  (2) Testosterone induced-ROS generation is followed by an increase in Nox1 and Nox4
  mRNA levels and p47phox protein expression. (3) Gas6 signalling induced by testosterone
  is mediated by phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and an increase of anti-apoptotic
  Bcl2 family proteins. (4) Hypertrophy induced by testosterone involves recruitment
  of NFAT through calcineurin activation and GSK-3β inhibition. (5) Testosterone down-regulates
  the AT2R receptor via AR-mediated ERK1/2 activation. (6) Hypogonadism is shown to
  decrease nNOS and α-actin expression and increase p38 phosphorylation and caspase
  3 cleavage. (7) Testosterone stimulation results in a concurrent increase in the
  production of H2S, and consequently vasodilation via TRPV4 and large-conductance
  Ca2+-activated K-channels.
