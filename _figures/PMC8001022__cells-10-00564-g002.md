caption: RAGE structure and signaling pathway. The receptor for advanced glycation
  endproducts (RAGE) has three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (V, C1, and
  C2), a single transmembrane helix, and a C-terminal short domain, and exists in
  lipid rafts. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) is created by alternative splicing or cleaved
  by protease and functions as a decoy receptor. When binding with high mobility group
  box 1 (HMGB1) and nucleic acid, RAGE internalizes into the cytosol and interacts
  with Toll-like receptors (TLRs). RAGE transduces down-stream signaling upon binding
  with ligands and adaptor proteins, including diaphanous homolog 1 (Diaph1), toll-interleukin
  1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), and myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88 (MyD88), resulting in type 1 interferon and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines production.
