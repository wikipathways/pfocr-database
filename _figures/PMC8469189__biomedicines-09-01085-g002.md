caption: The influence of MSCs on immune system cells. MSCs regulate local inflammation
  by interacting with innate and adaptive immune system cells. The antigen-presenting
  cell activity mediated by dendritic cells (DCs) is downregulated by MSCs through
  the inhibitory effect due to IL-10, IL-6, and PGE-2. This last also increases the
  release of IL-23, which stimulates Th17. MSCs inhibit the pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages
  through the activation of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway and promote
  M2 macrophages, increasing the release of PGE-2, IL-6, IL-10, and GM-CSF. M2 also
  activates T-regs through the TGF-β pathway. T and natural killer (NK) cell proliferation
  is inhibited by MSCs’ release of IL-10, IDO, and activation of the Fas/Fas Ligand
  pathway, resulting in reduced production of IFNγ and IL-17 by T helper 1 (Th1),
  whereas Th2 enhance their production of IL-4. The release of TGF-β1 hinders B cell
  proliferation. MSCs inhibit mast cells’ release of TNF-α through the activation
  of the PGE-2 axis. This regulation of the immune system exerted by MSCs is fundamental,
  since silencing the immune response during tissue repair is necessary to its remodeling.
