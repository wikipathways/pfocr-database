caption: 'ER stress and the UPR in insulin resistance and diabetes. Insulin resistance
  and diabetes involve dysregulations in multiple organs, and ER stress participates
  to all these dysregulations. Excessive dietary FA and glucose induce ER stress in
  the brain, beta cells of Langerhans islets, myocytes, hepatocytes, and adipocytes.
  In the brain, this triggers insulin resistance and leptin resistance, with the latter
  enhancing appetite and thus excessive nutrient intake. In hepatocytes, FA-induced
  ER stress induces the three branches of the UPR. The PERK arm induces VLDLR and
  CHOP; the IRE1 arm increases lipogenesis and the CREBH arm enhances neoglucogenesis.
  In myocytes, this induces the IRE1 arm of the UPR, which deregulates the insulin
  receptor signaling and thus leads to insulin resistance. In adipocytes, FA and glucose
  trigger the IRE1 and PERK pathways, which induce, respectively, insulin resistance
  via JNK induction, and adipokines, TNFα, and IL-6 secretion. These adipokines and
  cytokines are released into the bloodstream and trigger ER stress in beta cells.
  FA, IAPP, and insulin overproduction are other triggers of ER stress in this cell
  type. Consequences of ER stress in beta cell are apoptosis through the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP
  pathway and decreased GSIS via GLUT2 repression. Abbreviations: ERS, ER stress;
  GSIS, Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion; IR, Insulin Resistance.'
