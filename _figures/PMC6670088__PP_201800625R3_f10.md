caption: Model of how PexRD2 and Pi22926 suppress two parallel MAPK signaling pathways
  triggered by Avr4/Cf4 or AvrPto/Pto. The schematic diagram illustrates P. infestans
  delivering PexRD2 and Pi22926 into the host cell during infection. The cell death
  following recognition of the C. fulvum effector Avr4 by Cf4 and the P. syringae
  effector AvrPto mediated by Pto/Prf are dependent on MAP3Kε or MAP3Kβ2 is suppressed
  by the presence of PexRD2 or Pi22926, respectively. PexRD2 and Pi22926 specifically
  interact with MAP3Kε and MAP3Kβ2, respectively. In planta, MAP3Kε and MAP3Kβ2 confer
  enhanced resistance against P. infestans likely due to recognition of an unidentified
  pathogen-associated molecular pattern by a PRR or recognition of an effector/avirulence
  protein (AVR) by an R protein, as proposed by .
