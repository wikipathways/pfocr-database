caption: TNF stimulation activates a series of complex signalling cascades that drive
  cell-fate decisions. The intricate interplay between these signalling pathways plays
  a pivotal role in determining a cell’s response to TNF. There are several checkpoints
  throughout TNF/TNFR1 signalling where crosstalk can occur. 1 One of the primary
  components believed to govern the interplay between TNF/TNFR1 complex I- and complex
  II-mediated signalling occurs during the early stages of complex formation. The
  post-translational modification (PTM) profile of RIPK1 determines whether signalling
  will predominantly propagate from complex I or complex II [97]. Under specific conditions,
  RIPK1 can experience significant PTM alterations, causing it to dissociate from
  TNF/TNFR1 complex I and instead form complex IIa. 2 The PTM profile of RIPK1 is
  thought to be regulated by the antagonistic interactions of A20 and CYLD. A20 binds
  to M1-linked chains on RIPK1 and protects them from degradation by CYLD, thus stabilising
  complex I. If CYLD successfully removes M1-linked ubiquitin, RIPK1 is more likely
  to dissociate from complex I and form complex IIa. 3 TNF/TNFR1 complex I-driven
  activation of NF-κB leads to increased expression of pro-survival genes, such as
  cIAP1/2 and c-FLIP. c-FLIP directly inhibits activation of pro-caspase 8, thus reducing
  signalling downstream of complex IIa. A20 is also under NF-κB transcriptional control,
  adding another layer of complexity to TNF/TNFR1 signalling crosstalk
