caption: Redox signaling responses in DCs and T cells during T cell activation. (A)
  Redox signaling in DCs. The TCR-antigen•MHC complex interaction and the co-stimulatory
  signal results in an immediate early pro-oxidant response in DCs with ROS production
  e.g. by lipoxygenase and NADPH oxidase. Low levels of ROS act as signaling molecules
  to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and activate protein kinases. ROS
  also activates the NF-κB pathway, which stimulates the expression of γ-glutamylcysteine
  ligase, thus increasing GSH synthesis. GSH activates the AP1 signaling pathway and
  initiates an antioxidant response. We postulate that system xc--dependent cystine
  uptake, GSH export and degradation into extracellular cysteine are stimulated as
  part of this response. (B) TCR signaling in T cells. Stimulation of T cells by DCs
  via the TCR results in phosphorylation and activation of ZAP-70 by leukocyte-specific
  protein tyrosine kinase (LCK). ZAP-70 directly phosphorylates the adaptor protein
  LAT and causes the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes. Recruitment of
  the growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) and phospholipase C γ1 (PLCγ1)
  to LAT leads to activation of downstream Ras and calcium signaling pathways.
