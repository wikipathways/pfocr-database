caption: Possible signaling pathway activated by the phytol-based immunostimulant
  PHIS-01. PHIS-01 induces IFN-γ, leading to the activation of the transcription factor
  IRF-1 that transcribes genes resulting in Th1 polarization, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
  development, induction of apoptosis and also possibly the activation of NK cells.
  PHIS-01 induced apoptosis/necrosis can generate DAMPS leading to the activation
  of the Nlrp3 inflammasome and production of inflammatory cytokines. MyD88 and p38
  mediated activation of NF-KB is probably induced by PHIS-01 indirectly via the activation
  of Toll-like or Nod-like receptors.
