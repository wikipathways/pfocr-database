caption: Reconstructed signaling pathways in glioblastoma (WP2261) are predicted by
  PCSF are red, PRF are yellow, HDF are cyan, and nodes that are not found by any
  algorithm are colored light blue. Additionally, red rings represent the nodes that
  are incorrectly propagated. Green edges are the correct ones that are present in
  GBM pathway, while incorrect edges included by any algorithm are colored brown.
