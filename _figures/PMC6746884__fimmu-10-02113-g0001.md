caption: Simplified illustration of the kynurenine pathway in the gastrointestinal
  tract. Tryptophan (Trp) is predominantly converted into kynurenine (Kyn) pathway
  (KP) by the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO). A small amount of Trp is converted
  by gut microbiota through the action of the enzyme tryptophanase, into indole, and
  its derivatives and into tryptamine. Indole metabolites could be converted in the
  liver into indoxyl sulfate. Another fraction of Trp is converted through Trp hydroxylase
  1 (TpH 1) into serotonin.
