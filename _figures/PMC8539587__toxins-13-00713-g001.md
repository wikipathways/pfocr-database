caption: Pathogen evasion of host cell sensing. Pathogen recognition is essential
  to initiate an inflammatory response. Due to their specific LPS structure, Brucella
  spp., Bartonella spp. and C. burnetii are poorly recognised by TLRs. Furthermore,
  Brucella melitensis and Bartonella bacilliformis flagellin are weak activators of
  TLR5. By competing with the interaction of TLRs with MyD88, the Brucella effector
  protein BtpA is the only bacterial protein currently known to directly inhibit the
  TLR signalling pathway. BtpA also induces caspases 1, 4 and 11 degradation, impairing
  interleukin secretion. The C. burnetii effector protein IcaA actively modulates
  the inflammatory response by inhibiting the activation of caspase 11.
