caption: Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway maintains the BBB integrity.
  The presence of Wnt ligand or β-catenin activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
  regulating target gene expression. This activation upregulates Mfsd2a and downregulates
  Cav-1, thereby reducing endothelial transcytosis. It also increases the expression
  of junction proteins, strengthening tight junctions. Together, the reduction in
  transcytosis and the enhancement of tight junctions collectively maintain BBB integrity.
  In the disease state, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is compromised, resulting
  in weakened tight junctions, increased endothelial transcytosis, and subsequent
  BBB breakdown. Created with BioRender.com
