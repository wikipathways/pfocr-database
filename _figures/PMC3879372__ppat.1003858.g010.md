caption: Upon BCR engagement, multiple protein kinases including Src family kinases
  (Lyn,Fyn,Src,Blk,Yes), Syk, Btk get activated leading to the activation of PLCγ2.Activated
  PLCγ2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate [(PtdIns(4,5)P2]
  to DAG and IP3. Binding of IP3 to its receptor on the ER membrane leads to release
  of ER Ca2+ stores. However, this increase in Ca2+ is only transient and following
  depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, an influx of extracellular Ca2+ occurs (termed as SOCE-Store
  Operated Calcium Entry). This prolonged and sustained increase in Ca2+ leads to
  activation of the Calcineurin-NFAT pathway. In the case of M2, Miranda et al have
  shown that M2 can interact with Fyn and PLCγ2. Our model suggests that interaction
  of M2 with proximal membrane signaling molecules such as Src kinase and/or PLCγ2
  potentially mimics events that occur upon BCR engagement resulting in the Ca2+ mediated
  activation of the NFAT pathway. Induction of IRF4 by M2 is dependent, at least partially
  by the activation of NFAT pathway. IRF4 can activate regulatory elements in the
  IL-10 promoter locus (termed CNS-Conserved Noncoding Sequences) in T cells and in
  our case, in B cells as well. These series of events leads to eventual increase
  in the levels of IL-10 observed upon induction of M2.
