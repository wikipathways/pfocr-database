caption: Metabolic effects of hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives on the coenzyme Q biosynthesis
  pathway. Schematic biosynthetic pathway of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in humans, starting
  from precursors derived from the mevalonate pathway and tyrosine metabolism. The
  polyprenyl side chain is synthesized by the PDSS1/PDSS2 complex and attached to
  4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HB) by COQ2. Subsequent ring modifications involve a series
  of enzymes (COQ3–COQ9), resulting in the formation of CoQ10. Alternative ring substrates—vanillic
  acid (VA), protocatechuic acid (PCA), and β-resorcylic acid (β-RA)—are highlighted
  in colored boxes and shown entering the pathway at positions where they are hypothesized
  to bypass. PPHB = polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate; PPDHB = Polyprenyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate;
  PPVA = Polyprenyl-4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate; DDMQ10 = demethoxy-demethyl-ubiquinone-10;
  DMQ10 = demethoxyubiquinone-10; DMeQ10 = demethylubiquinone-10
