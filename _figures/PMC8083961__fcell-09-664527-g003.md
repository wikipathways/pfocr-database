caption: Oxygen metabolism-related pathways in exercise-induced cardiomyocyte regeneration.
  Exercise stimulates physiological signaling pathways, such as those involved in
  creating mild hypoxia, changes in fatty acid and glycolysis metabolism, elimination
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhancement of antioxidative capacity, and regulation
  of the oxygen metabolic molecular pathway in the heart. AMP- activated protein kinase
  (AMPK) enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism through Sirtuins1
  (Sirt1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α),
  which increase antioxidative enzymes to promote ROS elimination and mitochondrial
  biogenesis. Exercise-induced hypoxia and increase in ROS content promotes hypoxia-inducible
  factors 1α (HIF-1α) expression, which decreases fatty acid oxidation and increases
  glycolysis. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and neuregulin-1 activate phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) and downstream Akt signaling pathways. Akt activates 4EBP1 and S6K1,
  downstream of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which may promote protein
  and ribosomal synthesis. Akt, RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase; CDK1, cyclin
  dependent kinase 1; C/EBPβ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-β; CITED4, CBP/p300-interacting
  transactivator 4; DDR, DNA damage response; eIF4E, translation initiation factor
  eIF4E; GLUT4, glucose transporter 4; IGF-1R, IGF-1receptor; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase-1; PFK2, 6 phosphofructokinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase; S6K1,
  ribosomal protein S6 kinase-β1; SOD, superoxide dismutase; SRF, serum response factor.

  description: Oxygen metabolism-related pathways in exercise-induced cardiomyocyte
    regeneration. Exercise stimulates physiological signaling pathways, such as those
    involved in creating mild hypoxia, changes in fatty acid and glycolysis metabolism,
    elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhancement of antioxidative capacity,
    and regulation of the oxygen metabolic molecular pathway in the heart. AMP- activated
    protein kinase (AMPK) enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism
    through Sirtuins1 (Sirt1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator
    1α (PGC-1α), which increase antioxidative enzymes to promote ROS elimination and
    mitochondrial biogenesis. Exercise-induced hypoxia and increase in ROS content
    promotes hypoxia-inducible factors 1α (HIF-1α) expression, which decreases fatty
    acid oxidation and increases glycolysis. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)
    and neuregulin-1 activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and downstream Akt
    signaling pathways. Akt activates 4EBP1 and S6K1, downstream of the mechanistic
    target of rapamycin (mTOR), which may promote protein and ribosomal synthesis.
