caption: Generally, viral infection can induce both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic
  pathways. Viruses such as HSV-1, HSV-2, and PRV initiate extrinsic signals through
  cell death ligands (e.g., FasL and TNF), causing caspases-8 activation, which then
  triggers caspase-3 and caspase-6. HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, and BHV-1 directly trigger
  caspase-8; however, HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, and BHV-1 target the BCL-2 protein, which
  initiates the mitochondrial pathway. BHV-1 affects the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis
  through stimulation of p53 and ROS. Once p53 is activated or intracellular ROS increases,
  mitochondria-dependent apoptosis can be activated. HSV-1 and -2 can inhibit apoptosis
  through inhibiting caspase-8 activity and RIP1 binding to RIP3. Then, RIP3 activates
  the downstream factor MLKL, leading to necroptosis.
