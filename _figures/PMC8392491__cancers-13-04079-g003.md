caption: Summary of GPCR activity of constitutively active GPCRs or following binding
  of an agonist to a receptor. Top, the classical G protein pathway. GTP for GDP exchange
  in the G protein α subunit results in dissociation and modulation of downstream
  effectors such as Gαi inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and Gβγ activation of ion channels.
  Bottom, arrestin-associated signaling via activated GPCRs. Phosphorylation of the
  cytosolic C-terminus by a G protein–coupled receptor kinase (GRK) leads to arrestin
  (Arr) recruitment and activation. This promotes receptor endocytosis via interactions
  with the clathrin adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex and activation of extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Created with BioRender.com. Inspired by Weis et al.
  [] and Komolov et al. [].
