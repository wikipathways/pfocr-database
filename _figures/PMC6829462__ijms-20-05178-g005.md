caption: The proposed mechanism of S-equol in cerebellar development through both
  genomic and nongenomic actions. S-equol enters the cells and may bind (↓) to the
  cytoplasmic, nuclear ERs or GPR30 to induce gene transcription, which leads to cell
  growth and augmentation of dendrite arborization in neurons (A). These effects were
  suppressed by an ER inhibitor, (i.e., ICI (┴)). On the other hand, S-equol also
  activated the GPR30 (↓) signaling pathway through the activation of phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2, enhanced cell proliferation, and induced F-actin rearrangement to increase
  cell migration in astrocytes (B). These effects were suppressed by the GPR30 inhibitor
  G15 (┴).
