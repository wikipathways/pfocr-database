caption: The complement pathway. A schematic of the complement signaling pathway where
  all 3 pathways (classical, lectin, and alternative) converge on C3. The red, bolded
  inhibitory signs indicate points in the complement signaling cascade where pharmacologic
  inhibitors can be used to alter signaling within cells, while the red, unbolded
  inhibitory sign indicates regulatory proteins in the complement cascade.
