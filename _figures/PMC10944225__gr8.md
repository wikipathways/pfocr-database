caption: Schematic summary of the mechanism of the role of BMP2 and the BMPR/Smad1
  signaling pathway in the modulation of CGRP expression and progression of BCP. In
  the nociceptive DRG neurons of rats with BCP, upregulated BMP2 activated downstream
  BMPR/Smad1 signaling, and increased the release of CGRP, leading to neuroinflammation
  and contributing to the progression of BCP. This figure was created on Figdraw (www.figdraw.com)
