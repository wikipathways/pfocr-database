caption: Oxidative conditions and the PI3K/Akt pathway of insulin signaling. The large
  number of cysteinyl moieties in the IR and IRS renders them susceptible to oxidation
  (and activation) by H2O2; Akt is also redox sensitive. In NIH/3T3 cell lines, Akt
  translocation to the mitochondria is associated with a second phosphorylation, which
  is dependent on the mitochondrial [H2O2]ss (); in neuroblastoma cells, the translocation
  of Akt to mitochondria resulted in the phosphorylation of a mitochondrial constitutive
  form of GSK3β and of ATPase (). IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IRS, insulin
  receptor substrate.
