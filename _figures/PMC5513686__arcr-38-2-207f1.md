caption: 'Principal effects of chronic alcohol abuse on anabolic and catabolic mechanisms
  that maintain skeletal muscle mass. Protein synthesis and breakdown are regulated
  by multiple factors, including anabolic hormones, nutrients, and myokines. Alcohol,
  depicted here by its chemical formulation, influences multiple aspects of both the
  anabolic and catabolic arms of the pathway. Numerous regulatory components of these
  pathways are altered by chronic alcohol exposure (see boxes).NOTE: 4EBP1 = eukaryotic
  initiation factor 4E binding protein; FOXO1 = Forkhead box protein O1; IGF-1 = insulin-like
  growth factor; IL-1 = interleukin 1; IL-6 = interleukin 6; IRS-1 = insulin receptor
  substrate 1; JNK = c-Jun N-terminal kinase; mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin;
  MuRF1 = muscle RING-finger protein-1; P-I-3K = phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase; PTP1B
  = protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; S6K1 = S6 kinase 1; TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor
  alpha; UPS = ubiquitin proteasome system.'
