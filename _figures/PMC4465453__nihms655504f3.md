caption: 'Two main pathways of mitophagy are presented: (1) PINK/Parkin pathway. In
  healthy mitochondria, Pink1 is imported into mitochondria and degraded by the inner
  mitochondrial membrane protease PARL. In response to mitochondrial stress, mitochondrial
  membrane potential is dissipated, and full-length PINK1 accumulates on mitochondrial
  outer membrane. Pink1 then recruits Parkin to damaged mitochondria, and Parkin ubiquitinylates
  outer membrane proteins to induce and promote autophagic removal of mitochondria.
  (2) BNIP3/NIX pathway. In healthy cells, Bcl-2 interacts and inhibits Beclin 1.
  Under conditions such as erythrocyte maturation and hypoxia, Nix and BNIP3 are activated
  respectively. Both NIX and BNIP3 may interact with Bcl-2 to release Beclin 1, which
  induces autophagic removal of mitochondria.'
