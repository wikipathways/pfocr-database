caption: 'N-linked glycosylation pathways leading to complex-type N-glycans. A simplified
  lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) biosynthesis pathway is depicted in the top of
  the figure. LLO synthesis is initiated on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane
  by Alg7p. A Man5GlcNAc2 structure is assembled on the cytoplasmic side by the consecutive
  action of the mannosyltransferases Alg13/14p, Alg1p, Alg2p and Alg11p. This structure
  is flipped into the ER lumen, where the modification of the LLO is continued by
  Alg3p. The B-branch is completed by the action of Alg9p after which the C-branch
  is started by Alg12p and completed by Alg9p. The triglucosyl cap is added by Alg6p,
  Alg8p and Alg10p generating a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. This structure is transferred onto
  a protein by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex. Two glucose residues are removed
  and Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 mediates binding to calnexin. After release of the protein from
  calnexin and folding of the protein, the terminal mannose of the B-branch is removed
  (route A). N-glycans of glycoproteins undergo trimming and transfer reactions in
  the Golgi apparatus. First, α1,2 mannosidase activities (ManI) are trimming the
  α1,2 mannose residues, after which first GlcNAc residue is added by GnTI. The remaining
  mannose residues are trimmed off by ManII, which create the substrate for GnTII
  that adds a second GlcNAc residue. Route B) includes an α1,2 mannosidase activity
  in the ER that gives rise to the Man5GlcNAc2 glycan structure in the ER. This structure
  is modified in the Golgi apparatus by GnTI and route A and B converge. By deletion
  of ALG3 gene, LLO biosynthesis is abrogated creating a Man5GlcNAc2 that can be glucosylated
  to varying extent and is transferred onto a protein (route C). After removal of
  glucose residues and possible interactions with calnexin, an α1,2 mannosidase activity
  converts this structure into a Man3GlcNAc2 structure. Alternatively, the Man3GlcNAc2
  can be generated biosynthetically by deletion of ALG11 and ALG3 genes and this glycan
  is transferred onto a protein (route D). The Man3GlcNAc2 glycan structure directly
  serves as a substrate for GnTI and GnTII. The color gradient indicates the presence
  or absence of canonical glycan features involved in interaction with calnexin/calreticulin
  and Yos9p, respectively. Blue circles: glucose, green circles: mannose, blue squares:
  N-acetylglucosamine. Light blue circles indicate reduced glucosylation of the A-branch.
