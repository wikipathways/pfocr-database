caption: 'The proposed immunopathophysiological mechanisms of stress-limiting effects
  of 1,3,4-thiadiazine compounds in myocardial infarction (based on the compound L-17
  properties). Legend: blue—the main mechanisms of action of the substituted 1,3,4-thadiazines
  on the course of stress reaction are highlighted; red—mechanisms acting on the tissue
  damage; yellow—action of the compounds on the serotonin-mediated disorders of microcirculation.
  Systemic effects of 1,3,4-thadiazines included: (1) the increase in neuronal stress-resistance
  mediated through D2 receptors; (2) the increase in synaptic availability of 5-HT,
  mediated via SERT and M1 receptors; (3) the reduction in the levels of stress cytokinemia,
  mediated via NET, M1 and D2 receptors; (4) the reduction of stress hormonal response
  and sensitivity of pituitary-adrenal system mediated through blockade of M1 receptors;
  (5) the reduction of stress-mediated decrease in insulin production in the pancreas
  and prevention of stress hyperglycemia due to action on dopamine receptors; (6)
  the decrease in of blood glucose levels, which, on the background of M-cholinoreceptor
  blockade, led to the decrease inoxidative stress in tissues. Local effects of substituted
  1,3,4-thadiazines included: (i) the reduction of oxidative stress levels and the
  suppression of the intensity of the local inflammatory process by inhibiting chemotaxis
  and migration of leukocytes, which was mediated through the blockade of muscarinic
  receptors and the kinase signal pathway PI3K-AKT; (7) the increased apoptosis, increased
  macrophage infiltration, decreased macrophage release of proinflammatory cytokines
  via blockade of D-receptors; (8) the decreased platelet activation and aggregation
  preventing the development of microcirculatory disorders and, as a consequence,
  secondary damage to the myocardial tissues (9–10) through a synergistic blockade
  of the serotonergic and adrenergic systems.'
