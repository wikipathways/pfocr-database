caption: 'ChREBP regulates fructose metabolism in intestine and liver. Dietary fructose
  gets into absorptive enterocytes in small intestine through GLUT5 located at brush
  border, and is translocated into circulation via GLUT2. In enterocytes, fructose
  also undergoes fructolysis and gluconeogenesis, and consequently is absorbed into
  circulation in the form of glucose. As a positive feedback mechanism, dietary fructose
  activates ChREBP pathway, and thereby promotes fructose absorption and glucogenesis
  in enterocytes. In the liver, fructose-activated ChREBP promotes glucose production,
  lipogenesis, and FGF21 production and secretion. Long-term fructose overconsumption
  promotes the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis due to excessive activation of ChREBP
  pathway. ChREBP: Carbohydrate-responsive element–binding protein; FGF21: Fibroblast
  growth factor 21; GLUT: Glucose transporter.'
