caption: The fate of EVPs is maintained by the co-inhibitory relationship between
  SOX9 and RBPJ maintained in a progenitor state in homoeostasis. However, increased
  expression of SOX9, either through the loss of RBPJ, or activation of the hedgehog
  pathway results in the translation of SNAIL and SLUG, driving the expression of
  mesenchymal-related factors such as FSP1, αSMA and PDGFRA. Thus, triggering EndMT
  and excessive scar formation. Conversely, the deletion of SOX9 promotes Notch signalling
  and RBPJ activities, favouring endothelial differentiation and vascularisation.
