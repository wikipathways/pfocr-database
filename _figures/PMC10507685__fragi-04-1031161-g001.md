caption: Schematics of the metabolic pathway of dauer larvae in the presence of external
  ethanol. In dependence on SODH-1 and ALH-1 enzymes, external ethanol is broken up
  and activated to Acetyl-COA (part of the pathway shown in orange) which is the key
  element of the original unperturbed metabolic pathway. Importantly, the arrows now
  pointing from Acetyl-CoA to fatty acids show the possibility of lipid storage accumulation
  in the presence of ethanol.
