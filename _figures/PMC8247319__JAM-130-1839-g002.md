caption: A systematic approach for optimum metabolic engineering of Bacillus subtilis.
  The traditional approach involves fragment optimization including manipulation of
  genetic expression cassettes or protein engineering enzymes of the pathway (innermost
  frame). Selection of promoter and RBS would be required at this step. Protein engineering
  assists obtaining enzymes with desired catalytic activities (middle frame). Taking
  further, optimization might involve the flux tuning and manipulation on proximal
  biochemical process including co‐factor supply. In a comprehensive optimization
  process, the multilayer Omics analysis is required by combining information from
  genomics, transcriptomic, proteomics and metabolomics data (outmost frame). [Colour
