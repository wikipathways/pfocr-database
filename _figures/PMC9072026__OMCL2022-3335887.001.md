caption: Pathological signaling pathway involving mitochondrial damage, ROS production,
  and ER stress. Postischemic accident produces glutamate excitotoxicity, leading
  to increased influx of Ca2+ ions. The excessive influx of Ca2+ causes mitochondrial
  damage and an increase in ROS production, which further causes ER stress. Prolonged
  ER stress causes activation of unfolded protein response through protein kinase
  RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6
  (ATF6), and inositol-requiring kinase 1α (IRE1α). Activated PERK phosphorylates
  eukaryotic factor 2a (elF2α), which suppresses global protein synthesis and activates
  transcription factor 4 (ATF-4). PERK activation and subsequent elF2α phosphorylation
  elevate ATF4 which induces cell death by upregulation of Bcl-2 family members and
  the key transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), which in turn regulates
  transcription of Bcl-2 family members. Thus, CHOP plays a crucial role in determining
  the cellular fate by alternating the levels of Bcl-2 members towards apoptosis.
  Under the ischemic condition, neuronal apoptosis is instigated by Bcl-2 family members,
  including Bax and Bak, which cause mitochondrial structural damage and enable the
  release of cytochrome C. Release cytochrome C interacts with apoptotic protease
  activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) to form the apoptosome, and caspase-9 is activated.
  Caspase-12, an ER membrane-associated caspase, is upregulated by glutamate excitotoxicity,
  which facilitates caspase cascade, further provoking cellular death.
