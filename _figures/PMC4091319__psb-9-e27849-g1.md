caption: Figure 1. A proposed model for MYBL2/HAT1 functions in the BR pathway. The
  plants respond to BR signaling and maintain balanced levels of BES1/BZR1, MYBL2
  and HAT1 to regulate BR-repressed genes. BIN2 phosphorylation can inhibit BES1/BZR1
  functions but active HAT1/MYBL2 functions. Dephosphorylated BES1/BZR1 interact with
  phosphorylated MYBL2 and phosphorylated HAT1 to regulate BR-repressed genes expression.
  While MYBL2 does not bind DNA directly, BES1/BZR1 and HAT1 bind to BRRE and HB (Homeobox
  Binding) site, respectively, in BR-repressed gene promoters. On BR-induced gene
  promoters, BES1/BZR1 bound to E-box interact with other transcription factors (e.g.,
  BIM1, MYB30, and PIF4, not shown) or regulators such as ELF6/REF and IWS1 to activate
  gene expression.
