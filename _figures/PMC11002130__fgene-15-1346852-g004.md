caption: tsRNAs as inhibitors of MAPK pathway activation via targeting MAPK-related
  proteins. tsRNAs exert their inhibitory influence on the activation of the MAPK
  pathway through precise targeting of MAPK-related proteins, which notably include
  BDNF, c-Myc, cyclinB, cyclinD1, ERK, and p38, ultimately leading to a suppression
  in their expression. To clarify, within this context, abbreviations such as tsRNAs
  (tRNA-derived small RNAs), tRFs (tRNA-derived fragments), MAPK (mitogen-activated
  protein kinases), ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase), and p38 (38 kDa protein) are integral to understanding the molecular mechanisms
  at play
