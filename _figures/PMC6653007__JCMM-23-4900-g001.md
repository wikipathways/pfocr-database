caption: Mechanisms of ferroptosis induction. Inhibition of system x c− deprives cellular
  cysteine, leading to GSH deletion and GPX4 inactivation. GSH can be synthesized
  from methionine through the transsulphuration pathway which is inhibited by cysteinyl‐tRNA
  synthetase. RSL3 inhibits the activity of GPX4 by covalent binding with GPX4. GPX4
  inactivation leads to the accumulation of lipid peroxides and final ferroptosis.
  Enzymes (GLS2 and GOT1) involved in glutaminolysis regulate ferroptosis process.
  The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle promotes cellular GSH deletion and leads to ferroptosis
  in combination with cysteine deprivation. The mitochondrial genes (ACSF2, CS) are
  all involved in ferroptosis regulation. ER stress induced by ferroptotic reagents
  promotes ferroptosis through ATF4‐dependent CHAC 1 expression. Lysosome is also
  involved in ferroptosis induction through autophagy process or cathepsin B release.
  Lysosome ROS contributes to the lipid ROS production
