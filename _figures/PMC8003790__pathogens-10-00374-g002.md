caption: Biosynthetic pathway for lipid IVAsynthesis in the P. gingivalis W50 strain.
  The reactions are shown with detailed structures of substrates and products. Reconstruction
  and assignments were performed as described in the Materials and Methods section.
  The pathway enzymes (green) and genes (purple) are shown on the right, while EC
  numbers for the enzymes (blue) are shown on the left. Chemical compound names (red)
  are shown below the structures.
