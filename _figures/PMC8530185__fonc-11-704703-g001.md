caption: Biogenesis and release of exosomes (extracellular vesicles). The formation
  of exosomes is multistep, and the uptake of exosomes by recipient cells is also
  multimodal. Early sorting endosomes derived from bud formation at the plasma membrane
  maturate to multivesicular bodies (MVB) after the cargo sorting and exchange via
  an endosome-sorting complexes (ESCRT)-independent or ESCRT-dependent pathway. MVBs
  eventually directly fuse with lysosome and degradation or are transported to the
  plasma membrane for release. After secretion, recipient cells take up exosomes through
  fusion with the plasma membrane, receptor-mediated pathway, or endocytosis. ALIX,
  apoptosis-linked gene 2-interacting protein X; ILVs, intraluminal vesicles.
