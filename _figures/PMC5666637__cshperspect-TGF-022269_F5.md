caption: Roles of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic protein
  (BMP) signaling in bone homeostasis. Bone homeostasis is maintained through continuous
  cycles of bone resorption by osteoclasts and new bone formation by osteoblasts and
  osteocytes. Both TGF-β and BMP signaling participate in regulating this process.
  TGF-β can act as a chemoattractant and recruit both preosteoblast and preosteoclasts
  to areas of bone remodeling and also promotes proliferation, differentiation, and
  survival of osteoclasts. At low doses, TGF-β increases secretion of RANKL (receptor
  activator of NF-κB ligand) and suppresses expression of the inhibitor OPG (osteoprotegerin),
  thus promoting osteoclastogenesis by activating RANK signaling in preosteoclasts.
  At high doses, it suppresses RANKL and increases OPG expression and thus inhibits
  osteoclastogenesis. This biphasic effect limits excessive bone degradation in the
  presence of high levels of active TGF-β derived from conversion of latent TGF-β
  by proteases and acid secreted by osteoclasts during bone degradation. BMP signaling
  suppresses osteoclast differentiation by increasing expression of OPG in osteoblasts.
  It can, however, also promote bone resorption by increasing the expression of sclerostin
  (SOST), an inhibitor of Wnt signaling which is a pathway that normally promotes
  osteoblastogenesis and bone formation. M-CSF, Macrophage-colony stimulating factor.
