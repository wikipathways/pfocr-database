caption: Schematic of the synthetic pathway of the biotin pimeloyl moiety in E. coli.
  The pathway proceeds from A to D. The methyl groups are colored gray. A, the biotin
  synthetic pathway is initiated by BioC-catalyzed methyl transfer from SAM to malonyl-ACP.
  B, the malonyl ACP methyl ester enters the fatty acid synthetic cycle as the primer.
  Two rounds of the fatty acid chain elongation cycle gives pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester.
  C, pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester is hydrolyzed by BioH to form pimeloyl-ACP, which is
  a substrate for BioF. D, BioF begins assembly of the biotin rings by catalyzing
  the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent decarboxylative condensation of pimeloyl-ACP and
  l-alanine. KAPA, 7-keto-8-amino-pelargonic acid (also called 8-amino-7-oxononanois
  acid). The pathway is given in greater detail in Refs.  and .
