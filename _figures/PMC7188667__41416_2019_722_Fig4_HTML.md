caption: The glucuronidation pathway modulates the bioactivity of steroid hormones.
  The steroid-receptor-dependent activation of gene expression is in turn influenced
  by several UGTs whose activity is regulated by multiple factors, including germline
  deletions and transcriptional and translational regulation. Note that functions
  of UGTs unrelated to their glucuronidation activity discussed in the section ‘Metabolic
  influence of UGTs on cancer progression’ are not represented. In normal prostate
  tissues, UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 are predominantly nuclear enzymes, whereas in prostate
  tumour cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic distributions are observed., UGT expression
  is also reported to increase with prostate cancer progression and metastasis and
  influences patient outcome.,,,,
