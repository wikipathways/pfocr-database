caption: The corticolimbic circuit integrates motivationally salient information,
  including pain, and makes decisions about action selection. The NAc receives afferent
  nociceptive information through connections with the thalamus, parabrachial area
  (PB), amygdala (Amy) and ACC. Direct projections from the spinal cord to the NAc
  may be postulated on the basis of findings in rodents (red lines). VTA dopaminergic
  inputs to the NAc signal saliency, as well as the value of pain or relief. Corticostriatal
  connections from prefrontal, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices contribute
  to affective, emotional and cognitive control of pain perception and are involved
  in motivational decision-making. In the NAc, glutamatergic outputs from the amygdala
  converge on dopaminergic terminals from the VTA and influence motivated behavior
  in response to stress and anxiety (black lines). A descending pathway from the NAc
  that can modulate spinal nociceptive signals, possibly via the RVM, has been suggested
  (gold dotted line). Chronic pain states are characterized by anatomical and functional
  reorganization of the corticolimbic circuit, including changes in gray matter density
  in the PFC, ACC and NAc and increased functional connectivity between the PFC and
  NAc.
