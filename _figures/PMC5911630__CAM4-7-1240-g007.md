caption: The role of ACSS3 as a prognosis biosignature of GCa. The mitochondrial‐derived
  acetyl‐CoA (contributed by ACSS3) and intermediates of the lower‐mevalonate pathway
  enzymes are biosignatures of GCa prognosis (blue). Among them, ACSS3 is a GCa progression
  confounder. On the other hand, LDLR and related cholesterol bioflux are also key
  events responsible for GCa progression, by which steroidogenesis occurs .
