caption: Pim signaling in MM. Pim-2 is upregulated in MM. BMSCs, present in the microenvironment
  secrete IL-6 (depicted in grey) and increase Pim-2 transcription via STAT3 signaling.
  OCs release tumor necrosis factor family members TNFα, BAFF and APRIL (depicted
  in green), which then act via NFκB to increase Pim-2 transcription. Pim-2 has a
  role in prevention of apoptosis by phosphorylating MDM2 and reducing the degradation
  of p53, phosphorylation of ASK-1 and phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic BAD at
  serine 112. This latter effect on BAD is shared with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway also
  important in MM. These two pathways also converge on mTOR signaling. Pim-2 phosphorylates
  TSC2 to release the inhibitory effect of Rheb on mTORC1. Akt phosphorylates PRAS40
  to activate mTORC1. Downstream of mTOR activation, both cap-dependent and cap-independent
  translation is initiated. The ribosomal proteins 4EBP1 and S6 kinase are phosphorylated
  to initiate cap-independent translation. Following phosphorylation of 4EBP1, eIF4E
  is released and forms a translation initiation complex with eIF4A, eIF4G and eIF3.
  The ribosomal 40S subunit can then bind to ‘weak' mRNA transcripts which contain
  a GC-rich region and capped by 7-methylguanosine. Among the pro-myeloma proteins
  translated in this manner are MYC, cyclin D1, MCL-1 and the Pim kinases themselves.
  This forms part of the oncogenic collaboration between the Pims and MYC. The Pims
  cannot perform oncogenic functions in the absence of MYC expression, and in turn,
  the Pims phosphorylate and stabilize MYC. Pims complex with MYC and MAX and are
  recruited to the E-box of MYC where Pims phosphorylate serine10 of histone 3 (H3S10)
  to induce transcription of up to 20% of MYC target genes. A putative role for the
  Pim kinases in MM, as has been demonstrated in other hematologic malignancies, is
  phosphorylation of CXCR4 on serine 339 with resultant internalization and re-expression
  of CXCR4, facilitating homing and migration.
