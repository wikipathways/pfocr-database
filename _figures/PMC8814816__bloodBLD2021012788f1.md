caption: Regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by SREBP2 and LXR. (A) In conditions
  of low cholesterol levels, SCAP escorts SREBP2 to Golgi apparatus, where it is cleaved
  and activated. Subsequently, SREBP2 binds and activates the expression of genes
  regulating de novo cholesterol synthesis. LXRs remain in a repressive state. (B)
  In conditions of high cholesterol levels, oxysterols, cholesterol, or desmosterol
  keeps the trimolecular complex INSIG/SCAP/SREBP2 in the ER, not allowing cholesterol
  synthesis. Oxysterols engage LXRs, which activate expression of the cholesterol
  transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. These transporters induce the reverse cholesterol
  transport pathway, leading to elimination of excess cholesterol through bile acid
  formation and excretion.
