caption: Proposed crosstalk between the Nrf2-ARE pathway, HMGB1 and DNA damage response
  (DDR). The increase in oxidative stress causes multiple effects such as inflammation,
  DNA damage, and immunosuppression. The Nrf2-ARE pathway regulates time kinetics
  of HMGB1 level. The modification of oxidative stress by Nrf2-ARE also influences
  DDR. The MRN complex activated as a part of DDR may further augment p53. Under oxidative
  stress conditions the p21 interacts with Neh2 domain of Nrf2. During DDR, MRN complex
  activates p53, which in turn interacts with p21. The direct evidence of p21 mediated
  interaction of Nrf2 and MRN is lacking. The interaction of Nrf2 with p53-Chk2 is
  also not clear from the available literature.
