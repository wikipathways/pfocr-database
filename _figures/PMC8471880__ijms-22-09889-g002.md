caption: Predicted NAFLD alleviation model of muscle-derived IL-6. Muscle contraction
  promotes IL-6 production from muscle cells. The produced IL-6 is then secreted into
  the blood and it induces the phosphorylation of STAT3 in hepatocytes. Phosphorylated
  STAT3 translocates into the nucleus. Autophagosomes are formed due to the activity
  of autophagy-related genes, such as LC3 and Atg7, whose expression is regulated
  by phosphorylated STAT3 (Y705). Autophagy results in the breakdown of lipids in
  hepatocytes, leading to NAFLD alleviation. There is also a pathway in which IL-6
  that is derived from myeloid cells reduces fibrosis in hepatocytes. This is the
  pathway by which IL-6 acts on macrophages to secrete exosomes, including miR-233.
  The miR-233 reduces the inflammasome activity of hepatocytes. Whether muscle-derived
  IL-6 has a similar effect is unclear. Thus, the muscle-derived IL-6 signaling pathway
  is important in the prevention of NAFLD, and leukocyte-derived IL-6 is important
  from a therapeutic point of view.
