caption: Genes and signaling pathways involved in ureter development. Scheme of genes
  and signaling pathways involved in the development of the urothelial cells (green),
  the stromal cells (pink), the smooth muscle cells (yellow) and the adventitial fibroblasts
  (blue). The transcription factor Tbx18 is one of the major early genes in ureter
  differentiation. Tbx18 is expressed in undifferentiated ureter mesenchymal cells
  and promotes the differentiation of both urothelium and smooth muscle cells. Uroplakins
  (UPKs) are expressed on the apical surface of urothelial cells which also express
  Shh (sonic hedgehog) and Wnt molecules. Dlg1 plays an essential role in the differentiation
  of the stromal cells that express the marker gene Raldh2. The Hedgehog signaling
  (Shh and its receptor Ptch) plays a major role in the ureteric smooth muscle maturation
  through molecules in the TGF-β signaling pathway such as Bmp4 and Tshz3. Shh is
  also necessary for the differentiation of ureteric pacemaker cells by suppressing
  the Gli3 repressor (Gli3R) through Smo (Smoothened) which in turn activates the
  expression of Kit and Hcn3. The canonical Wnt signaling is necessary for the differentiation
  of smooth muscle cells and the repression of the adventitial fibroblast cell differentiation.
  The smooth muscle cells express the Wnt receptors Frizzled (Fzd) which activates
  β-catenin (Ctnnb1). Calcineurin b1 (Cnb1) is required in the mesenchyme and smooth
  muscle cells for the development of pyeloureteral peristaltic machinery. The Angiotensin
  pathway may activate Cnb1.
