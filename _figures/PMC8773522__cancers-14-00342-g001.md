caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in muscle wasting. Catabolic pathways of protein
  degradation: activation of inflammatory cytokines, particularly, TNF, IL-1, IL-6
  leads to the activation of NF-κB and FOXO. The binding of IL-6 to its receptor induces
  STAT3 expression, which leads to the activation of the NF-κB pathway. The autophagy–lysosome
  system is activated by the transcription factor FOXO Activation of p38 and JAK/MAPK
  leads to apoptosis mediated by caspases. Myostatin can also activate protein degradation
  through FOXOs and may decrease protein synthesis, inhibiting AKT through SMAD. The
  levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are decreased during muscle wasting,
  suppressing the IGF-1 pathway and therefore inhibiting protein synthesis. The ubiquitin-proteasome
  system(UPS) is initiated by the transcription of the E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF-1
  and MAFbx/atrogin-1. ActRIIB, activin receptor type IIB; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α;
  IL, interleukin; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription;
