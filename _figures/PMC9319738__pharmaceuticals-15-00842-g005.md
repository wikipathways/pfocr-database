caption: 'Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and pathway analysis of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) upon edaravone treatment of differentiated neuronal cells
  under the neurotoxic condition induced by TDP-43 and ethacrynic acid. (a) The top
  10 significantly enriched GO terms according to a hypergeometric test p-value adjusted
  with the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure. Green bars: GO terms in molecular function
  category; orange bars: GO terms in biological process category; blue bars: GO terms
  in cellular component category. (b) Significant pathways (BH-adjusted p-value ≤
  0.05). (c) The illustration of the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway
  is generated using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Red objects represent
  genes that were upregulated with the addition of edaravone to differentiated neuronal
  cells under the neurotoxic condition induced by TDP-43 and ethacrynic acid.'
