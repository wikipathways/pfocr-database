caption: Schematic representation of the pathways involved in the response to fluorizoline
  in HEK293T and U2OS. The Prohibitin-binding compound fluorizoline triggers the intrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis through alterations in the expression of BH3-only proteins,
  such as NOXA. This compound causes increased ER stress leading to the activation
  of the ISR and increases of ATF4 and CHOP, which have a pro-survival role in the
  cell types analyzed in the present study. However, this pathway could also explain
  the modulation of BH3-only protein expression. Fluorizoline can trigger increases
  in calcium concentration in the cytosol and the mitochondria that are required for
  the activation of apoptosis, as pre-treatment with calcium chelators, such as BAPTA-AM,
  can prevent the activation of the ISR, the increase in NOXA expression, and apoptosis
  in U2OS cells. Grey lines indicate positive regulation; red lines indicate negative
  regulation. Solid lines indicate described events; dotted lines indicate proposed
  events.
