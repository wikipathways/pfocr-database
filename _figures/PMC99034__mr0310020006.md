caption: Intramolecular signaling pathway. A section of the ScCM dimer is presented
  in the T state (top), R state (middle), or super R state (bottom). The polypeptide
  backbone is drawn in ribbon style. The residues which change their position during
  allosteric transition and thereby transduce the signal of effector binding from
  the allosteric to the active site are shown as stick models (green, carbon; blue,
  nitrogen; red, oxygen). Hydrogen bonds are indicated by black lines. The position
  of the catalytic site inhibitor in the T and R state is derived from a superposition
  with the super R state structure using residues 1 to 214 and 224 to 254. Tyrosine
  is colored blue, tryptophan is red, and the bicyclic inhibitor is green.
