caption: 'Canonical and non-canonical WNT pathways. Canonical WNT pathway: Extracellular
  WNT ligands bind to FZD and LRP5/6 on the cell membrane, and recruit DVL protein
  to promote dissociation of the β-catenin destruction complex, followed by accumulation
  of β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus to interact with target downstream
  signaling molecules, activating intracellular signaling cascades. WNT/PCP pathway:
  Extracellular non-canonical WNT ligands bind to FZD receptor and/or ROR/RYK co-receptors
  at the cell membrane, and recruit DVL protein to promote downstream effector components,
  such as RAC and RHOA signaling cascades, regulating tissue polarity and cell movement.
  WNT/Ca2+pathway: Extracellular WNT ligands bind to FZD receptor and/or ROR/RYK co-receptors
  at the cell membrane, and recruit DVL protein to promote PLC, leading to the formation
  of IP3 and DAG from PIP2, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ accumulation. Ca2+ can
  activate CAMK and NFAT transcription factor to regulate downstream cascades. Abbreviations:
