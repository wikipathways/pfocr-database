caption: AMPK Activation by ATIC Knockdown. Inhibition of ATIC expression by shRNAleads
  to an increase in endogenous AICAR, which activates AMPK and inhibits its downstream
  pathway mTOR-S6 K1-S6. Finally, ATIC knockdown leads to decrease in cell proliferation
  and migration and increase in cell apoptosis.

  by regulating AMPK-mTOR-S6 K1 signaling.
