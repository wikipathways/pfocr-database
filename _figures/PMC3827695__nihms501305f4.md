caption: Ligand binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) induces homo-and
  hetero-dimerization of the receptor, resulting in activation of downstream effectors
  including the Ras-MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase)-Akt, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways
  that lead to cell proliferation, survival and many other effects associated with
  carcinogenesis. The EGFR pathway is frequently activated in never smokers by mutations
  in the EGFR gene. In smokers, mutations of the KRAS gene often occur, resulting
  in the release of growth factors, including transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α),
  which is a ligand for EGFR. In addition, Ras directly activates the PI3K-Akt pathway.
  Thus, the end result of KRAS or EGFR mutations are virtually identical, and mutations
  of both genes in adenocarcinomas of the lung are rarely seen. Other methods of activation
  of these pathways include gene amplification and mutations in BRAF, PIK3CA (a subunit
  of PI3K), and ERBB2 (also known as HER2). Reprinted with permission 12.
