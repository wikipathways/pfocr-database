caption: Proposed model depicting cross-talk between Gq-coupled GPCRs and CLEC-2 pathways.
  CLEC-2 activation by rhodocytin leads to initial signaling downstream of CLEC-2
  resulting in thromboxane generation and secretion of ADP. TxA2 and ADP activate
  the Gqpathway, resulting in the activation of PKCα, which in turn can activate SFKs
  possibly through direct phosphorylation at Ser-12. PKCα can also regulate Syk directly,
  via phosphorylation on Ser-297 site, or indirectly, via activation of DUSP3 and/or
  inhibition of TULA-2 phosphatase. The activated SFKs or Syk can contribute and thereby
  potentiate the initial CLEC-2 signaling. The green arrows represent positive regulation,
  and red lines represent negative regulation.
