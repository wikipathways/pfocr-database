caption: a∣ In CBASS, phage infection triggers the synthesis of 3’,3’-cGAMP, which
  then activates phospholipase. The phospholipase degrades the bacterial membrane,
  leading to altruistic suicide prior to the completion of phage reproduction and
  thus preventing the further spread of infection. b∣ In the mammalian cGAS–STING
  pathway, cGAS senses the DNA of bacterial and viral invaders and synthesizes 2’,3’-cGAMP,
  which in turn binds and activates STING. STING activates transcription factors needed
  for downstream transcription of innate immune response genes. The bacterial cdNs,
  c-di-GMP and 3’,3’-cGAMP, also directly activate STING. Several bacterial signals
  bind to RECON, inhibiting its undefined oxidoreductase activity and leading to increased
  activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. CBASS, cyclic-oligonucleotide-based
  anti-phage signaling system; cGAMP, cyclic GMP-AMP; cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase;
  STING, stimulator of interferon genes; cdN, cyclic dinucletotide; RECON, reductase
  controlling NF-κB.
