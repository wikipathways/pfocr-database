caption: Mitochondrial FAO. The mitochondria represents the site of the majority of
  oxidation of cellular fatty acids, as acyl-CoAs, and the entry and initiation of
  fatty acid metabolism is controlled by the activity of CPT. Reduced expression and
  activity observed in steatohepatitis limits mitochondrial FAO and perpetuates excess
  cellular lipid levels. Fatty acids within the mitochondria undergo β-oxidation through
  a 4-enzyme pathway that produces acetyl-CoA and a 2-carbon shortened acyl-CoA that
  can undergo further oxidation. The produced reducing equivalents are utilized by
  the ETC, whereas the acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle resulting in the production
  of CO2 and additional reducing equivalents or reduced to produce ketone bodies.
  Decreased functioning of the enzymes of β-oxidation by oxidative modification or
  genetic manipulation has been shown to result in increased steatosis and is present
  in progressive steatohepatitis. KO, knockout.
