caption: Differential metaMIR analysis recovers miRNAs involved in cancer. The TGFβ
  signalling pathway exerts both tumour-suppressive effects during early stages of
  tumorigenesis and increased activity at later stages of development and progression,
  for example in neuroblastoma. A potential therapeutic approach addressing this later-stage
  upregulation of activity based on miRNAs would see the targeting of pathway components,
  while avoiding the targeting of tumor suppressors. In this positive analysis, hsa-miR-302a-5p
  is returned as the top-scoring candidate, predicted to target multiple members of
  the pathway from ligands to effectors, while not targeting the tumor suppressors
  NF1 and TP53. In contrast, the negative search to downregulate the suppressors while
  not targeting TGFβ returned hsa-miR-130a-3p as the sole candidate to fit within
  the targeting constraints. Targeted or non-targeted genes are highlighted in yellow,
  with targeting interactions depicted by red lines, non-targeting by dotted blue
  lines.
