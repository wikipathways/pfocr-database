caption: (a) Sustained exposure to AA is harmful for proximal tubular epithelial cells
  (PTEC) leading to incomplete proliferation of PTEC resulting in apoptosis inhibition.
  These surviving cells secrete transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) among several
  other pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic paracrine factors. In this microenvironment,
  kidney perivascular cells (resident fibroblasts and pericytes) expressing platelet-derived
  growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) are activated into interstitial myofibroblasts.
  Peritubular capillary damage can occur also after AA intoxication or secondary to
  dysregulation of pericytes homeostasis. (b) Design of study using anti-TGFβ antibody
  (1D11) evaluating the effects of TGFβ signaling pathway inhibition on tubular, endothelial
  and perivascular cells injuries in acute phase of AAN in Wistar rats.
