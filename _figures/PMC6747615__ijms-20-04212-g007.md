caption: Schematic map of metabolic pathway involved in different regions of wheat
  grain endosperm grown under high nitrogen and low nitrogen conditions. The 2 × 2
  heat map represent normalized (log10) relative metabolites abundance at different
  regions of endosperm under high and low nitrogen treatment with red color for a
  higher abundance and green color for a lower abundance. HN-IE and HN-RE are samples
  from innermost endosperm region and the remaining endosperm region under high nitrogen
  treatment, respectively. LN-IE and LN-RE are samples from innermost endosperm region
  and the remaining endosperm region under low nitrogen treatment, respectively. Metabolite
  in black color represent identified metabolite in this study.
