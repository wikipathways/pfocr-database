caption: Recognition of ligands by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) leads to signalling
  via the adaptor MyD88 and subsequent NF-κB activation. Caspase 8 and its adaptor
  Fas-associated death domain (FADD) contribute to this pathway, inducing transcription
  of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines, some of which such as pro-IL-1β and
  pro-IL-18 require further proteolytic processing -. Caspase 8 or FADD is also recruited
  to the NLRC4, NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome complexes activated by classical inflammasome
  activators (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, LPS plus ATP or nigericin,
  Citrobacter rodentium, Escherichia coli, Francisella novicida, dsDNA, or Aspergillus
  fumigatus), in which caspase 8 either activates caspase 1, leading to caspase 1-dependent
  processing of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, and/or modulates cell death , , , , . However,
  in the absence of caspase 1, caspase 8 may induce apoptosis in the inflammasome
  speck , . Caspase 8 also assembles a range of structurally diverse complexes to
  directly mediate processing of pro-IL-1β independently of caspase 1. Candida species,
  A. fumigatus and Mycobacterium leprae infection trigger dectin 1 and its adaptor
  SYK to engage a so-called “non-canonical caspase 8 inflammasome” complex that is
  composed of CARD9, BCL-10, MALT1, ASC and caspase 8. Caspase 8 directly processes
  pro-IL-1β in the absence of caspase 1 and does not require internationalization
  of the pathogen . In response to TLR3 or TLR4 activators, the adaptor TIR-domain-containing
  adaptor protein inducing IFNβ (TRIF) promotes assembly of a caspase 8 processing
  unit for direct cleavage of IL-1β in a manner that may require the kinases RIPK1
  and RIPK3, and the adaptor FADD , -. For example, TLR4-TRIF signalling via LPS and
  a yet-unidentified signal released as a result of stress in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) engage caspase 8-dependent processing of IL-1β with or without RIPK3 (Ref ).
  LPS-induced TLR4-TRIF signalling and release of second mitochondrial-derived activator
  of caspases (SMAC; also known as DIABLO) owing to exposure to proapoptotic signals
  delivered by doxorubicin, staurosporine or cycloheximide activate caspase 8-dependent
  processing of IL-1β , . Here, SMAC or SMAC mimetics suppress inhibitor of apoptosis
  proteins (IAPs) from blocking RIPK3. During Yersinia infection, RIPK1 and FADD are
  essential in mediating caspase 8 activation via TRIF- and RIPK3-dependent and -independent
  mechanisms, whereby activation of caspase 8 ultimately drives caspase 1-mediated
  processing of IL-1β , . Signalling via TLRs induces upregulation of FAS (also known
  as CD95 and TNFRSF6). Interaction between FAS and FASL licenses caspase 8-dependent
  IL-1β release via FADD, independently of RIPK3 or caspase 1 (Ref , ).
