caption: Positive effects of CDK8 at pre- and post-initiation steps. (A) CDK8 couples
  receptor-regulated SMAD (R-SMAD) transactivation and turnover. R-SMADs are activated
  by C-terminal phosphorylation and translocate to the nucleus with SMAD4 where they
  form transcription complexes at TGFβ-and BMP-regulated genes. In the cytoplasm,
  phosphorylation of their linker region is antagonistic and leads to proteasomal
  degradation. However, in the nucleus, agonist-induced linker phosphorylation by
  CDK8 and CDK9 enhances the transactivation potential of R-SMADs by facilitating
  interaction with coactivators (CoActs). Eventually, nuclear phosphorylation leads
  to transactivation-coupled turnover. (B) CDK8 is required for β-catenin-dependent
  transcription. In the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin is targeted for degradation
  by a complex of GSK3β, axin and APC. Wnt binding to Frizzled receptors leads to
  stabilization of β-catenin allowing its translocation to the nucleus and formation
  of transcription complexes with TCF/LEF at Wnt-responsive genes. The transactivation
  domain of β-catenin recruits Mediator by direct physical interaction with MED12.
  CDK8 contributes to β-catenin transactivation by targeting E2F1, the transcriptional
  machinery or the β-catenin/TCF/LEF complex itself. (C) CDK8 promotes elongation
  at serum-responsive genes. Mitogen-driven activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ER K pathway
  leads to transcription of ELK1-dependent serum responsive genes. CDK8 promotes the
  recruitment of P-TEFb providing a mechanism by which CDK8-Mediator can positively
  affect transcription at steps subsequent to RNAPII recruitment.
