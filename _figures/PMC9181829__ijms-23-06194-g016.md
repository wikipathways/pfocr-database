caption: Hypotheses for the regulation of VvHT1 and VvHT5 expression in glucose signaling
  pathways. In embryogenic cells (EC), characterized by low glucose content and low
  glycolysis flux, the HXK-dependent glucose signaling triggers the inhibition of
  both the studied genes. Mannose may be detected by the cytosolic sensor HXK, and
  produces the same effects as those of glucose. In grape, mannose may also be phosphorylated
  as a substrate of HXK catalytic activity, and the resulting mannose-6-P could be
  metabolized, thereby allowing a glucose signaling pathway dependent on glycolysis.
  The less pronounced effect of 2DOG-blocked isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate
  to fructose-6-phosphate could be explained by its minimal impact on low glycolysis
  activity. In non-embryogenic cells (NEC), by presenting a high glucose content and
  a high glycolysis flux, inhibition by 2DOG of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate
  isomerization leads to metabolic disruption. This metabolic switch results in VvHT1
  repression by glycolysis-dependent glucose signaling, which is mediated by its transcriptional
  regulator VvMSA. Inversely, the upregulation of the VvHT5 expression by glycolysis-dependent
  glucose signaling appears independent from VvMSA.
