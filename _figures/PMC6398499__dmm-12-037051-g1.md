caption: Key components and potential pharmacological targets of Wnt signaling implicated
  in orofacial clefts. Wnt proteins are lipid modified by Porcn and secreted in the
  extracellular matrix by Wls from the Wnt-producing cells. Wnt9b and Wnt5a are representative
  orofacial cleft-associated ligands in the canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling
  pathways, respectively. In the canonical pathway, Wnt9b may bind to receptor Fzd1/Fzd2
  and co-receptor Lrp6, which respectively recruit Dvl and Axin proteins, disrupting
  the β-catenin destruction complex that includes the glycogen synthase kinase Gsk3β
  in the Wnt-responding cells. This leads to intracellular accumulation of β-catenin
  and its translocation to the nucleus, where, together with the Tcf/Lef1 transcription
  factors, it regulates the expression of downstream target genes that are critical
  during lip and palate formation, such as Msx1 and Msx2. The Lrp6 co-receptor can
  be regulated positively by Rspo2 and negatively by Dkk proteins. In the non-canonical
  pathway, Wnt5a binds to co-receptor Ror2 and/or Ryk to suppress Prickle1, which
  in turn activates Dvl proteins (involved in both canonical and non-canonical pathways)
  and facilitates the cytoskeletal rearrangements during palatogenesis. It is unclear
  whether Wnt5a also binds to Fzd/Lrp proteins to regulate canonical Wnt signaling
  during orofacial development. The key components of the signaling cascade that are
  underlined in the diagram could be targeted by small molecules to modulate Wnt signaling.
  Orofacial cleft-associated signaling molecules are marked with symbols according
  to their resulting phenotype (see figure key).
