caption: TLR signalling leads to apoptosis in tumour cells. Following TLR3 and TLR4
  priming in MSCs, cascades of molecular interactions result in the secretion of various
  molecules in CM, known as secretome. It comprises different biomolecules, such as
  regulatory RNAs, miRNAs, and proteins. After removing cell derisions, CM was transferred
  to wells, including U87 cells. Evaluation of apoptotic markers showed us that secretome
  ingredients following TLRs preconditioning significantly induce apoptosis in treated
  u87 cell lines. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is triggered by the ligation of
  TNF-α to its DRs
