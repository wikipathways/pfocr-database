caption: 'Putative signals which stimulate CECs to migrate include: chemotactic factors
  such as soluble VEGF secreted by RPE, contact between CECs and RPE, or contact with
  RPE extracellular matrix. Rac1 GTPase is activated via a PI 3-K-dependent mechanism
  in response to any or all of these stimuli, with the end result being transmigration
  of CECs across the RPE.'
