caption: Galactose metabolism and CG pathophysiology. (A) The first step of the Leloir
  pathway involves the conversion of β-D-galactose to its stereoisomer α-D-galactose
  by galactose mutarotase (GALM). Then, α-D-galactose is phosphorylated to α-D-galactose-1-phosphate
  (Gal-1-P) by galactokinase (GALK1). Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT)
  catalyzes the 2-step reaction through which Gal-1-P and UDP-glucose are converted
  to α-D-glucose-1-phosphate and UDP-galactose. Finally, UDP-galactose 4′-epimerase
  (GALE) mediates the interconversion of UDP-galactose (UDP-gal) and UDP-glucose (UDP-glc).
  This enzyme is crucial to maintain the steady state UDP-galactose/UDP-glucose ratio
  in different cells, playing an important role in glycoconjugate formation. Accumulation
  of α-D-galactose due to GALT deficiency leads to the formation of galactitol and
  galactonate, mediated by aldose reductase (AR) and galactose dehydrogenase (GALDH),
  respectively. Additionally, Gal-1-P can be converted into UDP-Gal via the action
  of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP); however its affinity is much lower when
  compared to the main substrate, Glc-1-P. Except for GALK1, the enzymes in this pathway
  can work in both directions, depending on the substrate levels and energy demand
  of the cell. Please note that there are only two enzymes in humans that are capable
  of converting Gal-1-P to UDP-galactose, the GALT enzyme and the UGP enzyme. Additionally,
  while UGP is bidirectional in nature, the reaction usually goes in the direction
  of Glc-1-P to UDP-Glc because PPi is rapidly hydrolyzed. (B) The accumulation of
  toxic metabolites, aberrant glycosylation, myo-inositol deficiency, endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress, and signaling pathway alterations all
  seem implicated in the pathophysiological cascade elicited in CG. Increased levels
  of Gal-1-P can inhibit inositol monophosphatase (IMPase1), which converts L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate
  to free myo-inositol, thereby limiting the intracellular myo-inositol concentration.
  Accumulation of galactitol generates osmotic stress which may result in decreased
  transcription of the myo-inositol cotransporter SMIT1, further aggravating the intracellular
  myo-inositol deficiency. The myo-inositol deficiency and subsequent alterations
  in inositide signaling can impair calcium homeostasis and cause ER stress, which
  is associated with apoptosis and downregulation of PI3K/Akt signaling. Gal-1-P and
  aberrant glycosylation may also contribute to ER stress. Lastly, the role of epigenetics
  and modifier genes also needs to be considered in CG pathology. Dotted lines represent
  associations that are still under debate. (C) Classic Galactosemia (CG) patients
  can suffer from brain pathology in multiple domains, i.e., cognition, neurology,
  neuropsychology, neuropsychiatry and neuro-imaging
