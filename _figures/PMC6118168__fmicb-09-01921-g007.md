caption: Schematic representation of the effects of FMT on DSS-induced ulcerative
  colitis in mice through maintenance of the composition of intestinal microbiota
  and overview of the signaling pathways activated downstream of AHR. Upon treatment
  with FMT, homeostasis of the intestinal microbiota and metabolites will be restored,
  resulting in the activation of the AhR signaling pathway followed by AhR promotion
  of Treg cell differentiation, which is accompanied by the induction of expression
  of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β.
