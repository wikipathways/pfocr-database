caption: 'MiRNA synthesis pathway. Biogenesis of miRNA begins with transcription of
  a miRNA gene (Canonical pathway) or the intron region of a protein-coding gene (Mirtron
  pathway) mainly by RNA polymerase II, and sometimes by RNA polymerase III in the
  nucleus. Canonical pathway: The sequences from miRNA genes transcription self-anneal
  and make hairpin-like structures called primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). Pri-miRNAs
  are being cut by DGCR8/Drosha complex and become pre-miRNAs. Mirtron pathway: Pre-miRNAs
  which are the result of intron regions of protein-coding genes are not dependent
  on Drosha complex. They are divided by spliceosome from the primary transcript of
  mRNAs. Then, they will self-anneal and become pre-miRNAs directly. All Pre-miRNAs
  from both pathways leave the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm by Exportin-5. There,
  the pre-miRNAs are cleaved by the Dicer/TRBP complex, yielding an about 22 nucleotides
  long miRNA: miRNA* duplex molecule. Then, this molecule will be loaded into the
  Argonaute (Ago) part of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). After discarding one
  of the strands, the other one will remain in the RISC and binds to 3’ untranslated
  regions of target mRNAs. miRNAs binding to target mRNAs lead to their translational
  repression, deadenylation and cleavage'
