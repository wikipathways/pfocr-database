caption: 'LncRNA-mRNA expression correlation network (co-expression network) analysis
  of core mRNAs and their correlated lncRNAs. In the network, nodes represent mRNAs,
  boxes represent lncRNAs, and the size of the node''s area represents the value of
  betweenness centrality. Red indicates up-regulation, and blue indicates down-regulation.
  The lines between nodes indicate a correlative relationship within the group; solid
  lines represent positive correlations, and dotted lines represent negative correlations.
  In the lncRNA target pathway network, circles represent pathways, squares represent
  lncRNAs, and edges represent the relationships between them. lncRNA: Long noncoding
  RNA.'
