caption: Multiple mechanisms of T-cell exhaustion induced by neutrophils in the TME.
  (A) Isolated TANs induce apoptosis of CD8+ T cells in the TME via TNF-α and NO contact-dependent
  mechanisms. (B) Tumor-secreted nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase reprograms
  CD10+ALPL+ neutrophils via neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase 1, maintaining
  their immaturity and inhibiting their maturation and activation. These neutrophils
  induce T-cell exhaustion and resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment. (C) Release of granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor induces TAN activation, which is accompanied by the induction
  of PD-L1 expression on these cells via JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway activation. These
  activated neutrophils contribute to immunosuppression and cancer progression by
  inhibiting T-cell immunity in a PD-L1/PD-1-dependent manner. TANs, tumor-associated
  neutrophils; NO, nitric oxide; TME, tumor microenvironment; PD-1, programmed cell
  death 1; PD-L1, programmed cell death ligand 1; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; NAMPT,
  nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase; NTRK1, neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor
  kinase 1; TCR, t cell receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor; JAK-STAT3, janus kinase-signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3
