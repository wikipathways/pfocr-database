caption: The glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) pathway in the pancreatic
  β-cell. An increase in the intracellular ratio of [ATP] to [ADP] will inhibit KATP
  channels, leading to membrane depolarization. The increase in membrane potential
  activates voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCC) and the resulting influx of
  Ca2+ triggers insulin secretion. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue,
