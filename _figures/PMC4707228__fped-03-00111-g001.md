caption: Pathophysiology of edema formation in NS. In disorders with massive proteinuria
  and marked hypoalbuminemia but minimal or absent renal inflammatory infiltrate,
  as in most children with minimal-change disease (MCD), the reduction in capillary
  colloid oncotic pressure (πcap) favors net fluid exit from the vascular to the interstitial
  fluid compartment thereby reducing effective circulatory blood volume, denoted as
  “underfill.” This then triggers secondary, or compensatory, Na+ retention and hemodynamic
  alterations aimed at achieving blood pressure homeostasis. By contrast, various
  glomerulonephritides and inflammatory renal disorders, such as acute post-streptococcal
  glomerulonephritis, may be associated with variable degrees of proteinuria and with
  pathologic release of mediators, which promote primary renal Na+ and water retention,
  as well as vasoconstrictive hormones that are released despite an intact or even
  expanded intravascular volume. These factors together with reduction in glomerular
  ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf, or LpS in the Starling equation), lead to reduced
  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and combine to further limit Na+ excretion, resulting
  in an “overfill” state and rise in capillary hydraulic pressure (Pcap). In turn,
  this causes net fluid accumulation in the interstitial fluid compartment. Note that
  nephrotic urine may be a common pathway for primary Na+ retention in both undefill
  and overfill disorders (refer to text and Tables – for the mediators sub-serving
  each of these main mechanisms of edema formation).
