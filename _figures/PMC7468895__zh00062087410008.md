caption: Working model for the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) signaling pathway
  that stimulates sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive potassium (sarcKATP channels) in intact
  ventricular cardiomyocytes. Signaling components involved are shown in rectangular
  or oval shapes (shaded); pharmacological reagents employed in the present study
  targeting individual signaling components are also depicted (on left). Broken lines
  depict potential, alternative pathways. We suggest that ANP via activation of particulate
  guanylyl cyclase (pGC)-linked natriuretic peptide receptor type A (NPR-A) leads
  to cGMP generation, which in turn activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG)
  and triggers downstream signaling that consists of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
  ERK1/2, CaMKII, and ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2), resulting in functional enhancement
  of sarcKATP channels. mAIP, myristoylated autocamtide-2 related inhibitory peptide
  for CaMKII; mitoKATP, mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels; MPG, N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine;
  SURx, sulfonylurea receptors.
