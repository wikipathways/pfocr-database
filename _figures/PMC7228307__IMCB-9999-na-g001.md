caption: Graphical representation of the FcγR effector functions. (a) Natural killer
  cell antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity via FcγRIIIa. (b) Antibody‐dependent
  cell‐mediated phagocytosis, and/or trogocytosis of large immune complexes, by professional
  phagocytes via activating FcγR such as FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIa. Biological sequelae
  include the destruction of the ingested complexes which may also feed antigen into
  antigen‐presentation pathways of antigen‐presenting cells (APCs). (c) Inhibition
  of cell activation by FcγRIIb. The immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM)‐mediated
  signaling of B‐cell antigen receptors (left) or of activating FcγR (right) on innate
  immune cells such as macrophages and basophils is inhibited by IgG Fc‐mediated co‐cross‐linking
  of these activating receptors with the inhibitory FcγRIIb. This leads to phosphorylation
  of the FcγRIIb immunoreceptor tyrosine‐based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and consequently
  recruits the phosphatases that modulate the ITAM‐driven signaling responses leading
  to diminished cell responses. (d) Sweeping or internalization of small immune complexes
  leading to their removal and, in APC, to enhanced immune responses. (e) Scaffolding
  in which the FcγRs play a passive role. Typically involving FcγRIIb, no signal is
  generated in the effector cell but “super‐cross‐linking” of the opsonizing antibody
  by the FcγR on one cell generates a signal in the conjugated target cell, for example,
  induction of apoptosis or activation in agonistic expansion of cells and/or their
  secretion of cytokines. In extreme cases, this leads to life‐threatening cytokine
  storm. ADCC, antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity; Ag, antigen; BCR, B‐cell
  receptor; Ig, immunoglobulin; NK, natural killer.
