caption: 'A brief overview of the pathways involved in mediating cisplatin-induced
  effects in cells. Apoptosis as well as cell survival depend on the nature and intensity
  of the signals generated and the crosslinks between the pathways involved. Apoptosis
  is initiated following the recognition of DNA damage by candidate proteins that
  bind to physical distortions in the DNA induced by cisplatin. When DNA damage is
  detected and cannot be repaired, the activation of the irreversible intrinsic death
  pathway mediated by p53 occurs. Depending on the intensity of DNA damage, the cell
  cycle is arrested at checkpoints that prevent its progression for DNA repair and
  cell survival. Abbreviations: ATR: ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein;
