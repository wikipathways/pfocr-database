caption: A working model of β-Lap in acute pancreatitis. In caerulein-induced AP,
  the decreased SIRT1 activity, caused by PARP activation-mediated reduction of intracellular
  NAD+ and the p53-microRNA-34a (miR-34a) pathway, induced NF-κB acetylation and inflammasome
  activation. β-Lap inhibited HMGB1 and ROS production. This attenuation, in turn,
  attenuated NF-κB activation and inflammasome signalling. Subsequently, β-Lap elevated
  intracellular NAD+ levels through NQO1 enzymatic action, which attenuated the caerulein-induced
  decrease in SIRT1 activity, resulting in amelioration of acute pancreatitis.

  inflammasome signalling.
