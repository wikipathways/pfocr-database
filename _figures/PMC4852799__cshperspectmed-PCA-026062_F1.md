caption: Appropriate activation and feedback control of TP53 activity is critical
  to effective tumor suppression. (A) In the absence of a TP53-activating signal,
  TP53 protein levels are maintained at low levels in most cell types by the E3 ubiquitin
  ligase, MDM2 (HDM2), which ubiquitinates (Ub) TP53 and targets it for degradation
  by the proteosome. (B) The TP53 protein may also control gene expression in the
  absence of an activating stimulus, for example, by transcriptional repression. The
  extent to which basal TP53 activities contribute to the tumor-suppressor function
  is not known. (C) Stress stimuli, such as oncogene expression, DNA damage, and metabolic
  dysfunction, rapidly lead to TP53 protein accumulation and activation; this is in
  part owing to inhibition of MDM2 (HDM2), thus preventing TP53 ubiquitination and
  proteosomal degradation. Following activation, the TP53 protein acts as a sequence-specific
  transcription factor directing the expression of a large number of target genes,
  which are considered the primary determinants of the tumor-suppressor response.
  The specific mode of the TP53 response is influenced by extensive posttranslational
  modification, including acetylation (Ac) and phosphorylation (P).
