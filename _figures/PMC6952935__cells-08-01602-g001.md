caption: Schematic representation of the metastatic cascade. Inside the primary tumor,
  tumor cells produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibroblast growth
  factor 1 (FGF1) to increase vessel density and interact with endothelial cells via
  the VEGF and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) signaling pathways to enhance vessel
  permeability, which provides favorable conditions for tumor metastasis. Endothelial
  cells (ECs) and pericytes constitute the physical barrier for tumor vessels. Pericytes,
  in the resting state, suppress tumor intravasation; however, certain populations
  of activated pericytes and cells undergone pericyte–fibroblast transition (PFT)
  lose their role as barriers to tumor vessels and facilitate metastasis. Many other
  cells in the tumor microenvironment, including tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs),
  tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and Tie2-expressing macrophages (TEMs), are
  involved in the pro-metastatic effects, which contribute to angiogenesis and vascular
  permeability by secreting pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF-A, Wnt7B, MMP-9 and
  C–X–C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12). During the process of extravasation, tumor
  cells first adhere to ECs via various adhesion factors. Neutrophils potentiate tumor
  cell adhesion and transendothelial migration through the integrins/intercellular
  cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) signaling pathway. Endothelial to mesenchymal
  transition (EndoMT), under transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) enhances vessel
  permeability and contributes to the transmigration of metastatic cells. Platelets
  and metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs) also enhance extravasation through
  opening the endothelial barrier. Finally, only a minority of disseminating cells
  successfully form metastatic foci and colonize in distant organs with the help of
  angiogenesis. The neovessels provide the necessary oxygen and nutrients for metastatic
  tumor growth.
