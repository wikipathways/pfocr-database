caption: Schematic representation of the Hippo pathway. Oncoproteins are highlighted
  in red, tumor suppressors in yellow, and upstream activators in green. The LATS1/2
  complex phosphorylates YAP and TAZ, leading to their degradation through binding
  to 14-3-3 proteins. In both Drosophila and mammals, YAP (Yes-associated protein)
  is regulated by an upstream core kinase cascade that includes MST1 (also known as
  STE4) and MST2 (homologous to Drosophila Hippo [HPO]), along with large tumor suppressor
  1 (LATS1) and LATS2. Adaptor proteins, such as Salvador 1 (SAV1) and MOB kinase
  activator 1A/B (MOB1A/B), also play crucial roles in this signaling pathway. The
  Hippo pathway maintains tissue and organ homeostasis by modulating a serine/threonine
  kinase cascade that phosphorylates the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ,
  preventing their nuclear localization and transcriptional activation. This phosphorylation
  leads to 14-3-3 mediated sequestration and proteasomal degradation of YAP/TAZ in
  the cytoplasm, thereby controlling tissue growth. Key regulatory molecules include
  AMOT family proteins (angiomotin), PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A), NF2 (neurofibromin
  2), KIBRA (kidney and brain protein), TAO1 (thousand and one amino acid protein),
  and SCRIB (Scribble)
