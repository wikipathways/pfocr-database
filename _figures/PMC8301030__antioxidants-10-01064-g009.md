caption: Cellular signaling mechanism associated with the activation of isoflavone-induced
  cancer cell apoptosis. Isoflavones activate glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β)
  and p53 associated with apoptosis. In contrast, they inhibit the expression of β-catenin,
  protein kinase B (Akt), androgen receptor (AR), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB),
  and intracellular Notch, which regulate tumor cell proliferation. In various cancer
  cells, altered conformational changes of target proteins caused by endo/exogenous
  stimuli, including mutations and amplifications of genes, or other defects, affect
  cellular signal that modulate apoptotic cell death. NF-κB, Akt, mitogen activated-protein
  kinase (MAPK), Wnt, Notch, p53, and AR pathways are commonly changed in various
  cancers. Among them, the NF-κB signaling pathway plays crucial roles in regulating
  cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, stress response, and other
  physiological processes including diabetes. Several important molecules in the NF-κB-mediated
  signaling pathway, such as NF-κB, inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB), and IκB kinase (IKK),
  regulate apoptotic signal transduction; however, NF-κB is the key protein in the
  pathway and has been recognized as the major culprit and a therapeutic target in
  cancer. The constitutive activation of NF-κB observed frequently in cancer cells
  is likely owing to the involvement of multiple other signal transduction pathways,
  such as tyrosine kinase, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), and Akt pathways. NF-κB is
  known as a key modulator of apoptosis in various cell types. Activation of NF-κB
  inhibits apoptosis, whereas inhibition of isoflavones-induced NF-κB enhances apoptosis
  in human cancer cells, suggesting that isoflavones play critical roles in the apoptotic
  pathway by inhibiting NF-κB signaling []. Figure adapted from Kimet al. [].
