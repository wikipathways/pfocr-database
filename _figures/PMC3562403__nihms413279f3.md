caption: Phospholipids are in demand for membrane assembly and organelle biogenesis
  during the differentiation of antibody-secreting plasma cells. A. When B cells are
  stimulated to secrete antibody, lipid synthesis is up-regulated. Fatty acid (FA)
  synthesis increases and these are incorporated into diacyglycerol (DAG) and ceramide
  (Cer). DAG is used in synthesis of phospholipids, most prominently phosphatidylcholine
  (PtdCho), which is the product of the CDP-choline pathway and the most abundant
  membrane phospholipid. PtdCho can be converted into phosphatidylserine (PtdSer),
  which in turn, can be converted into phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). PtdEtn is
  also generated by the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. Cer and the polar headgroup of PtdCho
  are used to produce sphingomyelin (SM). All of these phospholipids are building
  blocks for cellular membranes. B. The differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting
  plasma cells is marked by expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the entire
  secretory apparatus. XBP1(S), a transcriptional activator generated by the unfolded
  protein response, plays a key role in up-regulating expression of ER protein folding
  factors and secretory machinery, enhancing lipid synthesis and driving ER biogenesis.
