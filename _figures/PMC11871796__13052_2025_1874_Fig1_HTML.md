caption: Overview of microglia M1 polarization–mediated tic onset. The activation
  of microglia mainly results from three processes, including increased chemokine
  ligand 5 (CCL5) levels in the blood, up-regulated immune-related genes, and a lack
  of histamine (HA). CCL5 in the blood may enter the brain and interact with its receptors,
  C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) and C-C chemokine receptor type 1 (CCR1). The
  activation of CCR5 promotes neuronal pyroptosis through the CCR5/PKA/CREB/NLRP1
  signaling pathway. The activation of CCR1 may result in neurological impairments
  through the CCR1/TPR1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Both of these pathways may cause
  neuronal impairment and induce the onset of tics. Up-regulated genes related to
  immunity and inflammation, including C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), intercellular
  adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), MYC proto-oncogene (MYC),
  and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), are related to the activation of
  microglia. The lack of HA may lead to a decrease in the number of IGF-1-positive
  microglia cells, which have the function of protecting the brain. As a result, HA
  deficiency increases the susceptibility of microglial cells to inflammation triggered
  by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). M1-type microglia are known as pro-inflammatory microglia.
  Microglia M1 hyperpolarization may lead to an increase in inflammatory cytokine
  levels and sustained neurotoxicity. Striatal dopaminergic neurons are then impaired,
  which may cause tic disorders, and tics may occur subsequently
