caption: Simplified conceptual model of the possible interactions between the mucilage,
  FA and GA metabolisms during flax seed tissues development. The most relevant results
  of this study from our multidisciplinary approach are shown in the diagram, including
  carbon allocation and mechanical forces from the pressure exerted by the embryo
  on the SCE. The red arrows indicate that not more carbon allocations between both
  tissues through the symplasmic pathways are not supposed to exist anymore at 10
  DPA. The most relevant tissues- and development stage-specific events are merged
  in the dark grey and grey boxes. The color code of the red bars indicates the importance
  of the transcriptional regulation processes for each specific biosynthetic pathway.
  Phenotypes of the RILs used in this study and corresponding to the mucilage-released
  as well as FAs contents and the seed size and shape are reported at the end of the
  seed development (right).
