caption: 'Pathways were reconstructed resorting to metabolic databases (MetaCyc and
  KEGG), genome annotations at NCBI and literature. Genes and intermediates involved
  in the galactose (Gal), mannose (Man), N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc), N-acetylgalactosamine
  (GalNAc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and fucose (Fuc) catabolism are shown. Initial
  steps of glycolysis are depicted. galM, aldolase 1-epimerase; galK, galactokinase;
  galT-1, galT-2, galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase; galE-1, galE-2, UDP-glucose

  6-phosphate isomerase subunit LacA; lacB, galactose 6-phosphate isomerase subunit
  LacB; lacC, tagatose 6-phosphate kinase; lacD, tagatose 1,6-diphosphate aldolase;
  manA, mannose 6-phosphate isomerase; SPD_1489, SPD_1163, N-acetylneuraminate lyase;

  Fucl1P, fuculose 1-phosphate; GalNAc6P, N-acetylgalactosamine 6-phosphate; GalN6P,
  galactosamine 6-phosphate. The upper glycolytic intermediates and gene annotations
  are as follows: G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; FBP, fructose
  1,6-biphosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
  gki, glucokinase; pgi, glucose 6-phosphate isomerase; pfkA, 6-phosphofructokinase;
  fba, fructose-biphosphate aldolase; tpiA, triosephosphate isomerase. The lower glycolytic
  pathway is represented by a dashed arrow. Pathways or steps present in other organisms
  but uncertain in D39 are represented in grey. Vertical arrows near the gene name
  indicate the upregulation during growth on mucin as compared to Glc, in S. pneumoniae
  D39.'
