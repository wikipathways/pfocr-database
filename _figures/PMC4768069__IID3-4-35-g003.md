caption: Bioinformatics analyses reveal changes in expression of genes associated
  with the Death Receptor Pathway. Data represent the mean fold change (n = 3) in
  expression following stimulation with TNF‐α for 1 h compared to untreated control
  measured using qPCR. Up‐regulated genes are shown in red and down‐regulated genes
  are shown in green, the analysis was generated using IPA (Ingenuity). Similar results
  were obtained when the RNA‐Seq data were analyzed in this way.
