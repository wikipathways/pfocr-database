caption: The bone remodeling cycle. The purpose of constant bone remodeling is to
  maintain normal bone mass as a dynamic equilibrium between resorption and formation.
  Mesenchymal progenitors trigger the activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  to promote the differentiation of osteoblasts. Osteoblasts produce runt-related
  transcription factor 2 (Runx2) as the earliest marker and various extracellular
  matrix proteins, such as ALP, type I collagen, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and ostenectin,
  to accomplish bone formation and mineralization. Mature osteoblasts produce RANKL
  to achieve osteoclast differentiation. Alternatively, osteoblasts also release OPG
  to attenuate the osteoclast stimulant pathway. Macrophage colony stimulation factor
  (M-CSF) is another modulator of osteoclast differentiation produced by osteoblasts.
  Osteoclasts secrete acid and enzymes to absorb the bone matrix and release transforming
  growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) to control the
  activity of osteoblasts. Moreover, osteoclasts express ephrin B2 ligand and sphingosine
  1-phosphate (S1P) to bind with the EphB4 receptor on osteoblasts, which can promote
  osteoblast differentiation and can suppress osteoclast differentiation. Thus, there
  is a close link between osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation.
