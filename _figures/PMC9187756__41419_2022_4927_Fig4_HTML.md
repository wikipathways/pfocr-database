caption: a P53 can further promote the upregulation of ALOX15 by promoting the expression
  of GLS2, PTGS2, and STAT1, and ultimately promote ferroptosis, or p53 can indirectly
  activate the function of ALOX12 by inhibiting the transcription of SLC7A11, leading
  to ALOX12-dependent ferroptosis after ROS stress, this pathway mediated by ALOX12
  and independent of ACSL4, promotes the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing
  phospholipids (PUFA-PLS). b P53 can also inhibit the generation of cellular lipid-reactive
  oxygen species by competitively binding to DPP4 with NOX1; at the same time, the
  P53-DPP4 complex promotes the expression of SLC7A11 and CDKN1A to inhibit ferroptosis.
