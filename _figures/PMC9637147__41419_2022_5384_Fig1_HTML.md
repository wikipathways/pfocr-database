caption: Ferroptosis is typically triggered by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation.
  The cystine/glutamate transporter (also known as system xc-) imports cystine into
  cells with a 1:1 counter-transport of glutamate. Once inside the cells, cystine
  can be oxidated into cysteine, which is used to synthesize GSH. Taken as a reducing
  cofactor, GSH is in the reaction of reducing lipid hydroperoxides to lipid alcohols
  under the capability of glutathione peroxidase GPX4. Transsulfuration pathway is
  involved in supporting the availability of cystine and reduced GSH. Respectively,
  the mevalonate pathway generates a series of biomolecules and then drives ferroptosis.
  Several proteins (including serotransferrin, lactotransferrin, Transferrin receptor
  (TFRC), ferroportin 1 (FPN1), nuclear receptor co-activator 4 (NCOA4)) control ferroptosis
  through the regulation of iron metabolism. Fe3+ could be internalized into cells
  through three distinct pathways including lactotransferrin, haemin and serotransferrin-TFRC-SLC11A2
  pathway, during which Fe3+ is reduced and storage in the liable iron pool. Cells
  have evolved at least four systems inhibiting ferroptosis with different subcellular
  localizations to decrease lipid peroxides. The GPX4-GSH system can collaborate with
  FSP1-CoQH2 system on the plasma membrane and can also cooperate with DHODH-CoQH2
  system on mitochondrial membrane. Of late, the impact of the hypoxia-inducible factor
  (HIF) system on fatty acid (FA) metabolism has been depicted. α-KG α-ketoglutarate,
