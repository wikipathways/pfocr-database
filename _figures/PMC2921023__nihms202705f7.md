caption: Based on our earlier studies, it was important to assess the impact of the
  Gab2 interaction and PI3K/Akt pathway activation in the pathophysiology of MPD induced
  by persistently activated STAT5. In the STAT5aS711F murine retroviral transduction
  model we were able to initiate MPD at the level of STAT5 without activating first
  the upstream receptor or non-receptor tyrosine kinases which would simultaneously
  activate PI3K/Akt at the receptor level. Using genetic deletion of Gab2 or pharmacologic
  inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin, we were able to interrogate this signaling axis
  and determine its importance in the development and progression of MPD. Note that
  this diagram is overly simplified regarding PLC γ and MAPK pathway activation in
  order to focus on STAT5 and PI3K/Akt activation.
