caption: Pathway level interaction network of 10 highly enriched pathways in the ginsenoside
  Rb2/Rg3 combination-treated cells annotated according to ConsensusPathDB compared
  to control, providing synergy hypotheses of the compound combination. Node size
  is based on number of genes represented in each pathway gene set, color is determined
  by statistical enrichment value (darker blue = higher p value) and edge thickness
  represents the total number of genes shared between each pathway. (Detailed information
  about each pathway and its p value can be seen in .) It can be seen that growth
  factor receptor-mediated pathways such as EGFR1 and PDGF are major signaling that
  may contribute promoting effects on endothelial cell proliferation. Also, other
  pathways which are AP1, autophagy differentiation pathways are also known to be
  involved in regulating cell growth.
