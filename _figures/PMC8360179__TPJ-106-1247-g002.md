caption: Proposed pathway for EPA biosynthesis and possible EPA import routes from
  the ER into the chloroplast of Phaeodactylum tricornutum.Red text indicates increased
  pool size of metabolite or activity of enzyme in knockout cells. Blue text indicates
  reduced pool size or activity of enzyme. de novo synthesized 16:0‐ACP enters the
  prokaryotic pathway where it can be used in the plastid for the production of MGDG,
  DGDG, SQDG and PG via a canonical prokaryotic pathway or desaturated by PAD to 16:1n7‐ACP
  and further by soluble ACP desaturases. When exported to the cytosol through the
  long‐chain acyl‐CoA synthases pathway to enter the eukaryotic pathway, C16‐ACPs
  are hydrolyzed by unknown FAT and FFA are exported through the plastidial membrane
  to enter CoA pool. 16:0‐CoA in elongated to 18:0‐CoA with further desaturation by
  homolog of Arabidopsis ADS1 to produce 18:1Δ9‐CoA, which is at the base of PUFA
  biosynthesis. Newly produced EPA could be incorporated into acyl‐CoA and imported
  from ER into the chloroplast for galactolipid synthesis. From the ER, EPA could
  be imported into the chloroplast as incorporated into PA or DAG. EPA can be converted
  into TAG by an acyl‐independent PDAT after acyl‐editing or enter the Kennedy pathway
  and be converted into TAG by DGAT. ACP, acyl carrier protein; ADS1, Δ9‐acyl‐CoA
