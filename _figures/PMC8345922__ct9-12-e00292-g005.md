caption: Association of biliary pathway and host immunity. (1) Primary bile acids
  (cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) are mainly synthesized and conjugated with
  glycine and taurine respectively in the liver and are then released into the gastrointestinal
  tract. (2) In the intestinal lumen, gut microbiota metabolize these primary bile
  acids to secondary bile acids (deoxycholic and lithocholic acid, respectively).
  Secondary bile acids can regulate immune response in gut by decreasing proinflammatory
  cytokines. (3) Subsequently, enterohepatic circulation reabsorbs 95% of bile acids
  in the terminal ileum, and they are deconjugated in the liver through the portal
  vein. Nonreabsorbed secondary bile acids (5%) in the terminal ileum will be then
  excreted in the feces. (4) In the liver, deconjugated secondary bile acids become
  primary bile acids that could inhibit hepatic tumor growth by the induction of CXCL16-activated
  NKT cells. (5) However, it is uncertain whether these primary bile acids are able
  to inhibit tumor growth in the bile duct. CXCL16, C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 16;
