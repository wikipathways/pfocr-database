caption: Proposed endocytic pathway and intracellular metabolism of fusion proteins.
  (1) Binding of a protein drug to its receptor is considered primary binding. Due
  to the high presence of endogenous carrier protein (i.e. albumin, Tf) in the blood,
  binding to the carrier domain is considered secondary binding. (2) The fusion protein
  will be internalized via RME, where (3) proteins that remain boind to the protein
  drug receptor will be degraded in the lysosome. (4) The relative strength of binding
  to the two receptors inside the endosome will determine the impact of each receptor
  on the plasma half-life of the fusion proteins, where (5) proteins that bind to
  the carrier protein receptor will be recycled and released from the cell.
