caption: 'A model illustrating TRAF6-mediated IL-1 receptor signaling. In this model,
  IL-1R signaling consists of two mechanistically and temporally distinct pathways:
  the RING pathway and the Zinc pathway. The RING pathway transduces signals by the
  TRAF6/MEKK3/TAK1 complex. The binding of TAB2/3 to the K63-Ub chain conjugated to
  TRAF6, and the binding of MEKK3 or its associated protein (designated as X) to the
  K63-Ub chain conjugated to TAK1 is likely to stabilize the signaling complex. In
  addition, NEMO binding to the K63-Ub chain conjugated to TRAF6 or IRAK1 results
  in recruitment of the IKK complex to the signaling complex. TRAF6 catalyzes these
  polyubiquitin reactions. Such ubiquitin chain mediated protein complex formation
  may trigger the MEKK3-TAK1-IKK kinase cascade, thereby leading to NF-κB activation.
  The Zinc pathway is independent of TAK1 but dependent on MEKK3, and the pathway
  is preceded by the RING pathway during the first hour after stimulation with IL-1.
  Cooperation of the two distinct pathways is required to produce sufficient amounts
  of inflammatory cytokines. The M1-Ub chain conjugated to NEMO is also involved in
  IKK activation.'
