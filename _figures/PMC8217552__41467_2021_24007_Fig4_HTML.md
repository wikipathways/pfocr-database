caption: 'Schematic representation of autophagy signaling indicating site of action
  of small-molecule compounds (orange columns) or siRNA knockdown (green columns)
  used for pathway modulation. VeroFM cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 0.0005)
  and treated with the indicated compounds: polyamines spermidine (spd, 100 µM) and
  spermine (spm, 100 µM), AMPK modulator AICAR (25 µM), mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin
  (rap, 300 nM), VPS34 and ULK1 inhibitors SAR405 (1 µM) and MRT68921 (5 µM), AKT1
  inhibitor MK-2206 (1 µM), BECN1-stabilizers SMIP004 (S004, 10 µM), valinomycin (val,
  5 µM), niclosamide (nic, 10 µM) or DMSO (vehicle, dashed lines). For siRNA knockdown,
  VeroFM cells were transfected with 60 nM siRNA targeting ATG5, ATG7, FIP200, BECN1,
  and infected with SARS-CoV-2 48 h later. SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus particle units
  (PFU) and genome equivalents (GE) per ml were determined by plaque assay and real-time
  RT-PCR at 24 h p.i., respectively. Data are presented as fold differences (see Supplementary
  Fig.  for unprocessed data). In all panels, error bars =SEM derived from n = 3 (n = 2
  for spd, spm, AICAR) biologically independent samples from one experiment. Statistics
  were done for experiments with n = 3 using a two-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s, and one-way
  ANOVA for siRNA knockdown experiments (green). Compounds with significant SARS-CoV-2
  inhibition (spm, spd, MK-2206, S004, val, nic) in VeroFM cells were confirmed in
  Calu-3 cells (see Supplementary Fig. f–g). p ≤ 0.05 (*), p ≤ 0.01 (**), p ≤ 0.001
