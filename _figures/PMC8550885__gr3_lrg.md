caption: 'A possible model how the mTOR pathway can integrate signals to achieve adequate
  lineage specification during immune responses. 1) Concomitantly with antigen uptake
  and processing, the mTOR pathway integrates cues received by pattern recognition
  receptors, such as DNA, RNA and monosodium urate to contextualize the antigenic
  signal. 2) The antigenic signal, along with co-stimulatory and inhibitory signals,
  is transduced and integrated via relative activity of mTORC1 and 2.3) Effector T
  cells, resulting from clonal expansion of adequate T cell lineages are guided by
  mTORC1 and 2 activation, execute the appropriate immune response to neutralize the
  pathogen or malignant cell.(Many additional important immune cell populations, not
  depicted here, participate in immune responses) AG: antigen, TCR: T cell receptor,
  MSU: monosodium urate.'
