caption: Schematic representation of the action of exogenous Prdx6 applied after exposure
  to X-rays. Ionizing radiation directly and indirectly (via ROS) causes single-stranded
  (SSBs) or double-stranded (DSBs) DNA breaks. The MRN complex (Mre11, Rad50, and
  Nbs1 proteins) recognizes DNA damage and activates ataxia telangiectasia-mutated
  (ATM) kinase. ATM phosphorylates histone H2AX at Ser139 (γH2AX), as well as checkpoint
  kinases CHK1 and CHK2, which phosphorylate p53. Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15
  leads to cell cycle arrest, while phosphorylation at Ser46 promotes apoptosis. In
  turn, p-p53 (ar Ser15) promotes the expression of p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
  p21 (CDKN1A)), which inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), thereby inhibiting
  phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and causing cell arrest. Exogenous
  Prdx6 prevents increase in the level of intracellular ROS by their elimination in
  the extracellular space, as well as directly inside the cell after Prdx6′s penetration
  into cytoplasm []. Thus, the recombinant Prdx6 inhibits an increase of DNA damage
  and p21 activation, preventing the development of senescence. Prdx6 also prevents
  apoptosis by suppressing ROS-mediated activation of the ASK-1/JNK/AP-1 signaling
  pathway and an increase in the level of p-p53 (Ser46). An important role in the
  suppression of apoptosis is played by NF-κB, which is activated with the participation
  of NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator), and stimulation of the TLR4 receptor by exogenous
  Prdx6.
