caption: 'Cancer cells utilize glucose through aerobic glycolysis and the pentose
  phosphate pathway; both pathways are interlinked and dominant in cancer cells. Aerobic
  glycolysis is meant to produce fast energy, and the pentose phosphate pathway is
  used for the biosynthesis of nucleotides and lipids. NADPH and pyruvate can act
  as antioxidants to regulate ROS generation and evade apoptosis in cancer cells.
  Inhibition of glycolysis reduces acetyl-CoA production, which could be compensated
  for by the fatty acid oxidation pathway. Alternatively, inhibition of glycolysis
  activates the compensatory glutamate pathway. The glutamate pathway has an antioxidative
  role and can supplement α-ketoglutarate into the TCA cycle. Cancer cells modify
  metabolic pathways to fulfill their metabolic needs. The alternative pathway activations
  sustain metabolic homeostasis, which helps in developing drug resistance. Therefore,
  targeting multiple metabolic pathways is attracting attention for cancer therapy.
