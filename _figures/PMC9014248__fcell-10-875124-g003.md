caption: Cellular Function of USP13. (A) In energy metabolism, USP13 promotes cell
  energy metabolism by removing OGDH and ACLY degradation signals. (B) In autophagy,
  USP13 is recruited by auto-ubiquitinated NEDD4-1 to remove VPS34 subunit degradation
  signal. On the other hand, USP13 deubiquitinated Beclin-1 and removed the degradation
  signal of Beclin-1. Consequently, the VPS34 complex initiates autophagosome formation.
  K27-linked Ub chains are green, K48-linked Ub chains are pink. (C) In DNA damage
  reaction, USP13 antagonizes E3 ubiquitin ligase hHYD to remove the TopBP1 degradation
  signal, then TopBP1 activates the ATR signaling pathway and ultimately activates
  the G1-S phase checkpoint, making cells remain in the G1 phase. In addition, phosphorylated
  USP13 by ATM is recruited to DNA damage sites to cleave the other Ub chains to facilitate
  K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which promotes RAP80 localization and ultimately activates
  the G2-M phase checkpoint, making cells remain in the G2 phase. K48-linked Ub chains
  are pink. Phosphorylation is yellow. (D) In ERAD, hyper-ubiquitination of UBL4A
  can induce the cleavage and inactivation of Bag6, causing ERAD inhibition and inhibiting
  the interaction of UBL4A with SGTA directly. USP13 interacts physically with gp78
  and Bag6, removing hyper-ubiquitination of UBL4A, controlling precisely the ERAD
  process. Unknown-linked Ub chains are orange.
