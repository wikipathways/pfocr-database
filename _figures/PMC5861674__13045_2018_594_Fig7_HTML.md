caption: MiR-16 affects the pro-tumorigenic properties of the fibroblasts by controlling
  the levels of HGF in an FGFR-1- and MEK1-dependent fashion. According to our data,
  miR-16 reduces fibroblast HGF secretion by direct targeting of HGF itself and by
  inhibiting the FGFR-1 pathway, which in turn promotes HGF expression. In fact, even
  if not directly targeting the FGFR-1 mRNA, miR-16 reduces FGFR-1 protein levels
  and directly targets MEK1, which is crucial for FGFR-1 downstream signaling. Moreover,
  HGF seems to contribute to FGFR-1 expression. When miR-16 is reduced or lost, HGF
  is secreted by fibroblasts and contributes to cancer cell aggressiveness through
  the stimulation of cMet pathway. This activation results in increased proliferation
  and motility of the cancer cells. Interestingly, the presence of HGF seems to favor
  the increased levels of FGFR-1 supporting the idea that a cross-talk exists between
  cMet and FGFR-1 receptors
