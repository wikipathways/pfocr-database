caption: Symmetric stem cell self-renewal leads to two daughter cells retaining stem
  cell function, and thus an expansion of the stem cell pool, which is necessary for
  tissue regeneration following injury or disease. In comparison, asymmetric stem
  cell self-renewal yields one daughter stem cell and one differentiated cell and
  therefore is sufficient to maintain the stem cell pool under homeostatic conditions
  (). While satellite cells could, in theory, arise from reversion of a differentiated
  cell back to a stem cell phenotype (), this schematic illustrates only the modes
  of quiescent satellite cell self-renewal supported by recent experimental findings
  using Cre-loxP-mediated cell lineage tracing (; ). In Myf5-Cre/ROSA26-YFP transgenic
  mice, cells that have expressed Myf5, a marker of satellite cell activation which
  is expressed concomitant with a substantial reduction in potential to contribute
  to muscle regeneration, express the fluorescent protein YFP. In myofibers isolated
  from these transgenic mice, quiescent Pax7+Myf5− satellite cells can give rise to
  either (i) two Pax7+Myf5− quiescent satellite cells (symmetric self-renewal); (ii)
  one Pax7+Myf5− quiescent satellite cell and one Pax7+Myf5+ activated satellite cell
  (asymmetric self-renewal); or (iii) two Pax7+Myf5+ activated satellite cells (commitment,
  not shown in diagram). Moreover, daughter cells from satellite cell divisions are
  orientated relative to the myofiber plasma membrane and basal lamina in a manner
  consistent with their commitment status. In the case of symmetric self-renewal,
  the two daughter quiescent satellite cells are in planar alignment with the myofiber
  and have been shown to localize components of the planar cell polarity pathway,
  including Vangl2, in a parallel pattern. In the case of asymmetric self-renewal,
  the quiescent daughter cell remains in contact with the basal lamina (basal position)
  and the activated daughter cell is adjacent to the myofiber plasma membrane (apical
  position), positioned for possible fusion with the myofiber. The apical activated
  satellite cells express the Notch ligand Delta-1 and basal quiescent satellite cells
  express the receptor Notch-3, suggesting that the more differentiated progeny activate
  Notch signaling in adjacent quiescent satellite cells that can contribute to maintenance
  of their quiescent state. Emerging evidence suggests that these modes of self-renewal
  are controlled by specific molecular components of the satellite cell niche (see
  ).
