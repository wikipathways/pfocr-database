caption: 'A Upregulated response clusters: in a good vs poor responder comparison
  of dentate gyrus transcriptomes, we plotted all 117 upregulated genes and performed
  a kmeans clustering cluster analysis. We could detect two response-associated clusters
  (blue and green), and we showed their respective protein–protein interaction (PPI)
  profile (average local clustering coefficient: 0.304, PPI enrichment p value: <1.0e−16,
  n = 19). B Downregulated response clusters: in a good vs poor responder comparison
  of dentate gyrus samples, we plotted all 94 downregulated genes and performed a
  kmeans clustering cluster analysis. We could detect two response-associated clusters
  (blue and green) and we revealed their respective protein–protein interaction (PPI)
  profile (average local clustering coefficient: 0.528, PPI enrichment p value: <1.0e−16,
  n = 19). Insets show higher magnification of the most interesting clusters for improved
  visualization.'
