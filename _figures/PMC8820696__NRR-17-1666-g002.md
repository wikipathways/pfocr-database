caption: 'The amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH).Whether by an increase in production
  (FAD) or an impairment in clearance (SAD), Aβ peptide accumulates through an aggregation
  pathway populated by different species, i.e. monomers, oligomers, fibrils, and amyloid
  plaques. Aβ oligomers are the most toxic species, and to a lesser extent fibrils,
  causing calcium disruption, mitochondrial failure, inflammatory response, oxidative
  stress, transcriptional impairment, synaptic loss and, finally, neuronal death.
  In addition, Aβ oligomers induce the hyperphosphorylation of tau, which aggregates
  into oligomers that evolve to paired helical filaments and finally to NFTs. Tau
  oligomers are also toxic for neurons, with a strong effect on synapses, and, in
  turn, induce the formation of Aβ oligomers. In addition to this positive feedback
  between Aβ and tau aggregation, Aβ and tau cooperatively work to lead to neuronal
  death. Although still controversial, the ACH covers the multifactorial nature of
  AD. Aβ: Amyloid-beta peptide; FAD: familial Alzheimer’s disease; NFTs: neurofilament
  tangles; PHF: paired helical filaments; SAD: sporadic Alzheimer’s disease.'
