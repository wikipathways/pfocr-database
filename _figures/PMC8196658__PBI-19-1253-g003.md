caption: 'Thiamin biosynthesis in plants and construct design. (a) Comprehensive schematic
  representation of thiamin biosynthesis in planta adapted from (Strobbe and Van Der
  Straeten, ). Synthesis of pyrimidine and thiazole moieties as well as their condensation
  occurs in plastids. Biosynthesis pathway is shown in blue, enzymes in black. Transport
  across membranes is proposed to be carrier‐mediated (barrels), of which the identified
  mitochondrial TPP carrier is indicated (red barrel) (Frelin et al., ). The chemical
  structure of thiamin is depicted, of which the free hydroxyl group can be pyrophosphorylated
  by the action of thiamin pyrophophokinase (TPK). End product feedback, performed
  by TPP on the THIC riboswitch, is depicted in red. Products: Gly, glycine; NAD+,
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; SAM, S‐adenosylmethionine; AIR, 5‐aminoimidazole
  ribonucleotide; HET‐P, 4‐methyl‐5‐β‐hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate; HMP‐P, 4‐amino‐2‐methyl‐5‐hydroxymethylpyrimidine
  phosphate; HMP‐PP, HMP‐pyrophosphate; TMP, thiamin monophosphate; TPP, thiamin pyrophosphate.
  Enzymes: THIC, HMP‐P synthase; THI1, HET‐P synthase; TH1, HMP‐P kinase/TMP pyrophosphorylase;
  TH2, TMP phosphatase; TPK, thiamin pyrophophokinase. (b) Simplified schematic representation
  of B1 vitamer biosynthesis, focusing on important steps in the light of biofortification
  strategies. Here, the pyrimidine branch (THIC and HMP) is indicated in blue, the
  thiazole branch (THI1 and HET) in orange and the downstream pathway towards B1 vitamers
  (TH1 and thiamin) in green. (c) Schematic representation of the T‐DNA inserts utilized
  in the endosperm‐specific thiamin biofortification approaches. Grey arrows represent
  promoters. Coloured arrows illustrate coding sequences (CDS) (THIC, blue; THI1,
  orange; TH1, green), in which the length of the arrow corresponds to the relative
  length of the CDS. Blocks depict terminators. Abbreviations: LB, left border; RB,
  right border; T35S, cauliflower mosaic virus 35S terminator; 35S, cauliflower mosaic
  virus promoter; Tnos, nopaline synthase terminator; HPTII, hygromycin phosphotransferase
  (conferring hygromycin B resistance); Glub1, Glutelin B1 promoter; Glob, Globulin
  promoter; THIC, Arabidopsis 4‐amino‐2‐methyl‐5‐hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate
  (HMP‐P) synthase (At2g29630); THI1, Arabidopsis 4‐methyl‐5‐β‐hydroxyethylthiazole
  phosphate (HET‐P) synthase (At5g54770); TH1, Arabidopsis bifunctional 4‐amino‐2‐methyl‐5‐hydroxymethylpyrimidine
  phosphate (HMP‐P) kinase/thiamin monophosphate (TMP) pyrophosphorylase (At1g22940).'
