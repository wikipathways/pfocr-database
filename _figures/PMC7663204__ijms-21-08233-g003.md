caption: Signal transduction mechanism of PACAP receptor. The PAC1 receptor is able
  to engage Gs/Gq signaling pathways. PAC1 receptor mediated Gs activation stimulates
  AC via cAMP to promote MEK/ERK activation. The intracellular cAMP formation is also
  responsible of EGFR phosphorylation. PAC1 receptor mediated Gq activation stimulates
  PLC leading to DAG and IP3 activation. DAG activates PKC stimulating PI3k/Akt signaling
  pathway, whereas IP3 causes the Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum. Both MAPK/ERK
  and PI3K/Akt pathways mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival
  by inducing transcription of different genes, such as CREB. AC, adenylyl cyclase;
  cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; IP3, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate; MEK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase; PACAP, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide;
  PAC1R, PAC1 receptor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; PLC, phospholipase C;
