caption: 'TIIME in PCa. MCs: A) The Janus behavior by MCs (production of IL-1, IL-6,
  and TNFα) depends on tumor staging: in early phase tumors, MCs acquire pro-tumorigenic
  properties; they became protective in late-stage cancer. B) MCs exert pro-tumor
  activities by producing MMP-9 and suppressing CD8+ T cell response. C) MCs have
  been found to acquire protective functions, via crosstalk with PMN-MDSCs, by interfering
  with de novo generation of neuroendocrine tumors. MDSCs: D) Brusa et al. [] showed
  that circulating monocytes-MDSCs (M-MDSCs) increase in frequency, before and following
  radical prostatectomy, whereas Hossain et al. [] showed higher frequency of blood
  PMN-MDSCs in PCa patients. E) Targeting Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)+ PMN-MDSCs,
  by STAT3 silencing, with cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG)-STAT3 small interfering
  RNA (siRNA) conjugate, Hossain et al. [] found that this approach is successful
  on blocking the immunosuppressive activity in vitro of MDSCs on CD8+ T cells of
  PCa patients. Neutrophils: F) Neutrophils within the PCa TME, expressed IL-6R and
  the high amount of IL-6 in TME induces STAT3 mediated activation of immunosuppressive
  features. G) An in vitro study showed that neutrophil elastase (NE), a serine protease
  stored in neutrophils, induces ERK signaling in a dose dependent manner and activation
  of the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) in PCa cell lines which showed increased
  migratory capability. H) Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) can also influence
  angiogenesis within TME of PCa and metastasis. NK cells: I) PCa tumor infiltrating
  NK are characterized by reduced expression of the activation receptor NK Group 2D
  (NKG2D), together with impaired degranulation capabilities and reduced production
  and release of cytolytic molecules, such as perforin, granzymes, and interferon
  gamma (IFNγ). J) Tumor infiltrating NK cells in PCa patients are enriched in immature
  CD56bright cells. K) PCa cancer cells support the expression of Ig-like transcript
  2 (ILT2)/leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor B (LILRB) inhibitory receptors,
  together with downregulation of NKG2D and NKp46 and CD16 on NK cells. L) PCa circulating
  NK cells were found to increase their expression of PD-1 and T-cell immunoglobulin
  mucin family member 3 (TIM-3; as cell exhaustion markers), together with decreased
  level of NKG2D and degranulation capabilities, compared to circulating NK cells
  from control subjects. M) M2-like/TAMs in tumor environment limit NK cells cytotoxicity
  against metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) cells, by enhancing the PD-L1 levels and reducing
  NKG2D ligands production, through the IL-6-STAT3 pathway. N) IL-6, another abundant
  cytokine present both at tissue and systemic levels in PCa patients, limit NK cell
  anti-tumor activities, via STAT3 activation, by decreasing major histocompatibility
  complex-class I chain related proteins A and B (MICA/B) and UL16 binding proteins
  (ULBPs) NK cell-activating ligands, resulting in decrease NK cell killing capabilities.
  STAT3 activation in NK cells also results in reduced expression of activating receptors
  NKG2D, DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1), IFNγ, and TNFα secretion. STAT3 was found
  to activate the rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (Raf)-mitogen-activated ERK kinase
  (MEK)-ERK-activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathway, which directly induces the expression
  of the T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), in NK cells. O) NK
  cells isolated from peripheral blood of PCa patients acquire the CD56brightCD9+CD49a+(C-X-C
  motif chemokine receptor 4) CXCR4+ decidual-like phenotype and exhibit pro-angiogenic
  functions, inducing tube formation by endothelial cells, due to increased production
  of VEGF, CXCL8, CXCL12 and M2-like/TAM polarization. Monocytes/Macrophages: P) The
  M2-like TAM phenotype is driven by different stimuli within TME which include C-C
  motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) as well as
  granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and TGFβ, produced by cancer and stromal cells,
  that strongly contribute to macrophages polarization and in the generation of an
  immunosuppressive environment, via CXCL12 and IL-6. Q) Cancer cell/macrophage crosstalk
  is also driven to the opposite direction, as TAMs promote cancer progression, by
  stimulating migration and invasion, trough CCL22-C-C motif chemokine receptor 4
  (CCR4) axis activation. R) TAM-derived CCL5 activates STAT3 signaling in cancer
  cells and increases cell migration, EMT, and cell invasion, as well as supports
  cancer stem cell self-renewal. Red arrows up and down: upregulation/increase and
  downregulation/decrease'
