caption: 'Different modes of cooperative tumorigenesis. Examples of different modes
  of cooperative tumorigenesis. Mutant cells are in pink, RasV12-expressing cells
  are in green, wild-type cells are in blue, delaminated mutant cells are in dark
  pink, and the basement membrane (basal lamina) is in purple. (a) Intraclonal cooperation
  with cell polarity mutants and RasV12: JNK activation in the tumour cells cooperates
  with oncogenic Ras signalling to promote tumour overgrowth and invasion. (b) Interclonal
  cooperation with cell polarity mutants and RasV12: JNK signalling and Hippo pathway
  impairment in the scrib mutant cells lead to the production of Upd, which induces
  Dome-Jak-Stat signalling in the surrounding RasV12-expressing cells, thereby inducing
  their overgrowth and invasion. (c) Interclonal cooperation with a mitochondrial
  mutant overexpressing RasV12 and RasV12-expressing surrounding cells: Upd and Wg
  are produced by the mitochondrial mutant RasV12-expressing surrounding cells (see
  ), which induce upregulation of Dome-Jak-Stat and Wg signalling, respectively, in
  the RasV12 cells to induce their neoplastic overgrowth and invasion. (d) Delaminating
  cells cooperation: in tumours generated by chromosome instability (CIN) mutants
  (rod, bub3,  and  asp) or mutants that effect spindle orientation (scrib, dlg, and
  mud), some cells delaminate, resulting in two populations of cells, which in the
  case of spindle orientation mutants are not genetically different. The delaminated
  cell population produces the Wg and Upd ligands to upregulate Wg and Dome-Jak-Stat
  pathways, respectively, in the nondelaminated cells, thereby inducing their proliferation.'
