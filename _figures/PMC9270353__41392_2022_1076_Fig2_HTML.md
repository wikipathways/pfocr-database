caption: LLPS supports various DNA damage response (DDR) mediator to form DNA repair
  foci in different pathways. (Left) MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 complexes bind to the exposed
  DNA damage sites to initiate the pathway. Subsequently, the damage-induced lncRNAs
  (dilncRNAs) and P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) are recruited to the DDR site to promote
  the formation of DNA damage repair foci via LLPS. (Right) Nucleation of PAR with
  FUS and 53BP1 at DDR sites forms liquid-like compartments and facilitates subsequent
  signaling and repair
