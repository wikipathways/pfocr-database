caption: Schematic overview of autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking at the synapse.
  Local regulation of protein turnover occurs via autophagy (either non-selective
  and selective, e.g., mitophagy and aggrephagy) and the endolysosomal system (Rab5/Rab35/Rab7-dependent
  pathway), which can be stimulated by neuronal activity and nutrient depletion. In
  particular, metabolic signals activated upon nutrient restriction lead to mTORC1
  inhibition and robust autophagy activation in many tissues. However, conflicting
  results have been raised as to whether starvation or mTORC1 inhibition are able
  to efficiently induce autophagy in neurons. mTORC1-independent pathways also exist
  (e.g., trehalose-induced) but are poorly characterized. At the presynaptic terminal,
  synaptic vesicle (SV) components retrieved after neurotransmitter release (e.g.,
  by clathrin-mediated endocytosis) can transit through the endosomal compartment
  to be recycled back as newly formed SVs or be directed via late endosomes to lysosomes
  for degradation. Alternatively, SVs can be degraded via autophagy with a Rab26-dependent
  mechanism. Several presynaptic endocytic factors (e.g., Endophilin A, Synaptojanin1,
  AP-2) are implicated in the regulation of synaptic autophagy. Autophagosomes fuse
  with late endosomes to generate amphisomes and are transported along microtubules
  back to the soma, where fusion with lysosomes allows the digestion and recycling
  of cargoes. Autophagosomes can also act as signaling organelles, e.g., modulating
  neurotrophin-mediated TrkB signaling. Postsynaptically, autophagy and the endolysosomal
  system regulate neurotransmitter receptor trafficking and degradation.
