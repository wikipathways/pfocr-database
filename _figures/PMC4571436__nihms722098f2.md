caption: CXCR3 Isoforms play functional roles in seemingly opposing directions. CXCR3A
  signaling mainly via Gαi or Gαq subunits activates phospholipase C-beta (PLC-β)
  to initiate calcium influx; mu-calpain (calpain-1) is subsequently activated to
  facilitate motility or even cause anoikis in endothelial cells (via β-3 integrin
  cleavage). Gα protein also activates PI3K-AKT and Src-Ras-ERK signaling pathways
  to promote cell migration and survival/proliferation. CXCR3B signaling via Gαs or
  Gαq subunits to trigger protein kinase A (PKA) to inhibit m-calpain (calpain 2)
  results in the inhibition of migration. CXCR3-B activates p38 MAPK-p21-Socs3 pathway
  to prevent JAK2-stats3 activation. In breast cancer, CXCR3-B activation promotes
  the activation of p38 MAPK and inhibition of ERK1/2 that associates with an increased
  nuclear localization of Bach-2 and nuclear export of Nrf2. The modulation of Bach-1/Nfr2
  nuclear localization down-regulates HO-1, and these events can promote increased
  apoptosis and reduced proliferation of breast cancer cells.
