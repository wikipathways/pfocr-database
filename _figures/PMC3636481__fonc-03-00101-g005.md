caption: Molecular response to a short telomere in the absence of telomerase in S.
  cerevisiae. In the absence of telomerase, three distinct, but non-exclusive scenarios
  can be envisaged. (A) In the G1 phase of the cell cycle, short telomeres incur a
  risk of being recognized by the DSB sensing factors. Although in budding yeast,
  this may not be sufficient to trigger a G1 checkpoint (Zierhut and Diffley, ; Symington
  and Gautier, ), this probably contributes to cell cycle arrest in G1 of senescing
  cells in mammals. The main risk in budding yeast cells is the NHEJ pathway and the
  formation of telomere–telomere fusions. This will pose a problem in the next S-phase,
  since palindromic telomeric fusions may generate a replication stress and subsequent
  activation of a replication checkpoint. Then, if fusions resist to replication,
  in the next mitosis, the segregation of dicentric chromosomes may contribute to
  a delay of the M phase. Their resolution may generate immediate unviability or,
  if it occurs within telomeric repeats, it recreates short telomeres with uncertain
  end structures. (B) Telomeres form natural replication pauses and in case of telomere
  breaks during replication, the preferential mode of repair is telomerase-dependent
  re-elongation. In the absence of telomerase, it’s not known whether replication
  is made more difficult at the shortest telomeres by a specific processing of DNA
  ends. Nevertheless, the activation of the replication checkpoint in senescent cells
  may reflect a myriad of different structures occurring at telomeres when replicated
  in the absence of telomerase. (C) Finally, short telomeres may be processed as DSBs,
  whereby an extended 5′–3′ resection may expose subtelomeric ssDNA resulting in Mec1
  activation as in Figure . Note that all of the three scenarios can contribute to
  the G2/M delay or arrest observed in senescent cells.
