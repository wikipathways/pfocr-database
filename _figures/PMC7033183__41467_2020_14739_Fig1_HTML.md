caption: 'a The whole system was constructed based on a cell-mimicking giant membrane
  vesicle. Driven by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the closed state DNA nanogatekeeper
  switches to the open state. Then, environmental ions diffuse through the opened
  channel, sequentially triggering a set of confined downstream cascade reactions,
  and an additional feedback pathway mediates the switching of nanogatekeeper back
  to the closed state. This process mimics the fundamental cellular signaling that
  contains reception, transduction, and response. b Schematic illustration of chol-o(open)-DNGK
  and chol-c(closed)-DNGK. A locker (cyan DNA strand) can plug the nanogatekeeper
  in the top region; similarly, a blocker (yellow DNA strand) can plug the nanogatekeeper
  in the bottom region, both locker and blocker can form a closed nanogatekeeper.
  c Modular design of AMSsys in giant membrane vesicles corresponding to a, consisting
  of membrane-spanning nanogatekeeper and the encapsulated signaling network, which
  is divided into the following modules: ion-mediated catalytic reaction, a DNA circuit
  signaling transduction, and a target degradation. The rolling circle amplification
  (RCA) in the end is used to detect the final product.'
