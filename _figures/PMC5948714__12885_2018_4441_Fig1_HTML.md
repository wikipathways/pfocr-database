  activation that outcompetes CD28 for binding to B7 on antigen presenting cells in

  T cell response. CTLA-4 is rapidly induced in T cells, following activation via
  MHC/TCR and B7/CD28 mediated signaling. In contrast, the major role of the PD1 pathway

  antigen in peripheral tissues. b Cancers can express the ligands for these checkpoint
  molecules, thus blocking T cell responses. Thus, the use of checkpoint inhibitors
