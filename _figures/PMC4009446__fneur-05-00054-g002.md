caption: 'The visual head-turn pathway: the cephalomotor premotor pathway from the
  intermediate and deep lamina of the superior colliculus. This diagram [adapted from
  Ref. () with permission] illustrates the brainstem pathways involved in the head
  turn in response to a salient environmental change. Magnocellular retinal ganglion
  cells form the retinotectal pathway (green arrow) to visual sensory cells in the
  SGS of the superior colliculus. The direct connection between the superficial and
  the intermediate and deep laminae of the superior colliculus (not drawn) is illustrated
  in Figure . The cephalomotor premotor neurons, originating in the SGI of the superior
  colliculus, form the tectospinal and tecto-reticulospinal tracts to reach the motor
  neurons in the upper cervical cord by two routes: (a) direct pathway (thicker red
  arrow): the decussating predorsal bundle pathway (medial longitudinal fasciculus
  in man) can access the upper spinal cord directly or via the MdRF; (b) indirect
  pathway (thinner red arrows): via (i) the rostral portion of the MRF adjacent to
  the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (piMRF, vertical gaze), and (ii) the caudal portion
  of the MRF, the central mesencephalic reticular formation (cMRF, horizontal gaze).
  The cMRF also provides feedback to the superior colliculus (blue arrows) in relation
  to head and gaze position. MdRF, medullary reticular formation; MRF, mesencephalic
  reticular formation; cMRF, central mesencephalic reticular formation; piMRF, peri-interstitial
  nucleus of Cajal mesencephalic reticular formation; SGI, stratum griseum intermediale;
  SGS, stratum griseum superficiale; SO, stratum opticum.'
