caption: G1-phase signaling pathways inferred with different heuristics. The membrane-bound
  proteins are depicted at the top, the TFs are depicted at the bottom, and the inferred
  proteins in between (except SWI5 which is an inferred TF). Proteins that occur in
  the KEGG pathway but are not inferred by any heuristic are depicted in gray. The
  core protein is CDC28 in all cases – its bow tie score is provided in the respective
  box. All recall and precision values are provided in Table 1.
