caption: Model of Met catabolism into VOSCs controlled by nitrogen catabolite repression.
  Exogenous Met functions as an inhibitor of glutamine synthase, inducing nitrogen
  catabolite repression. Met induces translocation of the transcriptional activator
  GLN3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in STR3 downregulation via the
  Msx-responsive regulatory pathway. Exogenous Met may cause stress. Met activates
  MSN2, mediating a general response to stress, and upregulates the expression of
  the Ehrlich pathway genes ARO8-2 and PDC, which is controlled by the rapamycin-sensitive
  TOR signaling pathway.
