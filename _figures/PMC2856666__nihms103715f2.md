caption: 'a) A network diagram of characterized phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
  events between kinases and their substrates (green arrows) and phosphatases and
  their substrates (red arrows), manually curated from the literature (see ). Below
  this are specific examples of kinase-substrate (1) and phosphatase-substrate relationships
  (2), and cases where two kinases (3), two phosphatases (4) or one kinase and one
  phosphatase (5) target one or more substrates. Blue and yellow edges correspond
  to negative and positive genetic interactions, respectively. The thickness of the
  edge correlates with the strength of the genetic interaction. b) Ratios of highly
  positive (S ≥ 2.0) to negative (S ≤ −2.5) genetic interactions (P to N ratio). Above
  dashed line: The P to N ratios of previously published datasets (early secretory
  pathway (ESP)() and chromosome function()), the signaling E-MAP, only protein kinases
  and protein phosphatases (K vs. K or P vs. P), and protein kinases versus protein
  phosphatases (K vs. P) are presented. Below dashed line: The P to N ratios for known
  kinase-substrate and phosphatase-substrate pairs (K → S, P → S) (out of these 252
  relationships that we genetically tested, we observed significant genetic interactions
  (positive and negative) for 25 of them (10%)), as well as kinase-kinase, phosphatase-phosphatase
  (K,K → S; P,P → S) and kinase-phosphatase pairs (K,P → S) that share one or more
  substrates are shown. To obtain these ratios and subsequent p-values, we also included
  regulatory subunits known to direct kinase/phosphatase activity towards specific
  substrates (see Methods and ).'
