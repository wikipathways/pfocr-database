caption: Targeting senescence as a therapeutic strategy. While an increase in ROS
  signals for senescence acquisition, there is also evidence that senescent cells
  exhibit aberrant redox signaling; a significant ‘pro-oxidant’ shift in the cellular
  environment. Redox modulators have shown promise as senomorphic or senolytic agents,
  such as the flavonoids, rapamycin, metformin and other repurposing approaches. In
  addition, senescent cells are refractory to death stimuli, and the possibility of
  exiting senescence to proliferate with an enhanced tumorigenic potential has also
  been demonstrated by multiple studies. SASP factors such as IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, osteopontin,
  chemerin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), CXCL11 are associated with tumor growth,
  vascularization, invasion, migration as well as metastasis. Also, CXCL-5, IL-6,
  IL-8 and IL-1β are known inflammatory cytokines found in SASP that promote inflammation
  and this can be inhibited through targeting with MMP inhibitors or cytokine inhibitors.
  mTOR pathway has been shown to regulate SASP through NF-κB activation, and their
  pharmacological targeting can potentially inhibit or limit SASP acquisition, as
  shown with Rapamycin or NF-κB inhibitors. Interestingly, senescent cells that bypass
  senescence retain the methylation landscape of a transformed cell, suggesting that
  this epigenome may promote malignancy if cells exit senescence or re-enter the cell
  cycle. As such, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors could be an effective senomorphic
  approach. Also, AKT overexpression or depletion of its negative regulator PTEN were
  also observed to induce senescence via mTOR kinase-mediated phosphorylation-dependent
  activation of p53 at serine-15. Also, p14ARF enables p53 to transcribe DUSP4 and
  DUSP7 that inactivate ERK1/2, thus limiting cell proliferation and inducing senescence.
  Various findings also suggest that increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins
  such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL direct cells into senescence by preventing apoptosis. As
  such, PI3K/AKT inhibitors and BH3 mimetics could be used as senolytics to eliminate
  senescent cells.
