caption: Trehalose metabolism in E. coli. Glucose is transported into the cell and
  activated by the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS).
  The biosynthetic pathway for trehalose is indicated by the thicker arrows (double
  arrows, synthesis of UDP-glucose; filled arrows, condensation and dephosphorylation).
  Genes deleted in JP10 and JP20 are shown in black boxes. JP20 also contains a functional,
  regulated ots operon (lacI-Ptac-otsBA) integrated into the ampH gene. Trehalose
  is degraded by both periplasmic (TreA []) and cytoplasmic (TreF []) enzymes. Trehalose
  biosynthesis is also controlled by the synthesis of TreC, which dephosphorylates
  trehalose-6-phosphate (). Stretch-activated proteins (SAP) in the plasma membrane
  facilitate the exit of trehalose under hypotonic conditions ().
