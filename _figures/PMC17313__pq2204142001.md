caption: Known genes of tryptophan metabolism in E. coli.  The five operons previously
  shown to be down-regulated by the  trp repressor are marked by arrows leading from  trpR,
  the structural gene for the trp  repressor. In the present study, aroF-tyrA, aroG,
  and  aroP also were down-regulated by tryptophan. These three  operons are regulated
  by TyrR, which can be activated by tryptophan.  These genes and the genes of the
  trp repressor regulon,  are shown in green. Genes of the tna operon that are  up-regulated
  by tryptophan are shown in red. Genes encoding other  enzymes of the common chorismate
  pathway are not shown.
