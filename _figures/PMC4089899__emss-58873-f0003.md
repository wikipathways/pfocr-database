caption: '(A) Left: normal joint structure; right: changes taking place in the synovial
  joint during the development of OA. (B) Bone cells (osteoblasts. osteoclasts and
  osteocytes), fibroblasts, macrophages and mast cells from the SCB invade the CC
  and the NCC, via microfractures in the bone–cartilage interface. The disruption
  of the osteochondral junction promotes production of enzymes, growth factors and
  molecules (ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, AGEs, BMPs, FGF-18, MMP-3, MMP-13, NGF, TGF-β and
  VEGF) by the invading cells and chondrocytes stimulating innervation and vascularization
  ultimately recruiting NVBs (BV and PNF) from the HC. (C) Inflammation in the synovium
  or synovitis causes joint swelling and effusion. Hyperplasia is seen in the synovial
  tissue resulting in the formation of a HSL followed by the infiltration of inflammatory
  cells – possibly owing to a systemic response or secondary to cartilage degradation
  or bone marrow lesion formation. Factors, enzymes and cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-1 family,
  IL-6 family, MMPs, NGF, TNF-α, and VEGF) stimulated via the cells encourage innervation
  and angiogenesis (NVB: BV and PNF). (D) Peripheral inflammation, cartilage degradation
  and bone marrow lesions produce numerous inflammatory mediators (e.g., sensitisers:
  bradykinin, a peptide which causes blood vessels to dilate; E2 stimulates osteoblasts
  to release factors that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts; PGE2; substance
  P, a neuropeptide belonging to tachykinin neuropeptide family; and TNFR-α) and growth
  factors (e.g., GDNF and NGF) activating their subsequent receptors (bradykinin receptor
  B2, EP2, GDNF-α, NK1, TNFR1 and TRKA). The sensitizers work by phosphorylating TRPs:
  TRPA1 and TRPV1, facilitating the trafficking of the channels to the membrane of
  the PT. Once in the membrane of the PT, TRPA1 modulates calcium exchange with TRPV1
  enhancing the nociceptive activity of both channels. The growth factors are transported
  down the neuron towards the DRG. Altered sensitization of such signaling pathways
  decreases the pain threshold in OA patients (RPT). (E) During ST, growth factors
  (GDNF and NGF) are transmitted into the cell body of the DRG, where they facilitate
  intracellular signaling pathways, for example, the MAPK cascade upregulating the
  expression of TRP channels (TRPA1/TRPV1), which are then transported via the neuron
  into the PNF and PT. Changes in this pathway during OA can switch the activity of
  the neurons to an altered state encouraging peripheral sensitization and RPT at
  the impaired site. Signaling pathways activated in the DRG then take effect in central
  processes.AGE: Advanced glycation end product; BMP: Bone morphogenetic protein;
