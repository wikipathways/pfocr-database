caption: 'The Nrf2/ARE pathway: activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling module At homeostasis,
  Nrf2 interacts with Keap1 (physically associated with a ubiquitin ligase), which
  results in constitutive ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Exposure to
  oxidant or electrophilic stress in the cytoplasm or microbially derived small molecules
  (e.g., 5-MIAA, indole acetic acid) results in transient and reversible modification
  of regulatory cysteine residues in Keap1, leading to Keap1 conformational change
  and Nrf2 release, stabilization, and cytoplasmic accumulation. Free Nrf2 translocates
  to the nucleus, where, as a dimer with the small DNA-binding protein Maf, it binds
  to antioxidant response element and transcriptionally activates the expression of
  a class of genes that includes cytoprotective factors and detoxification enzymes.
  Nrf2-induced gene products then act to reestablish cellular redox homeostasis and
  protect against subsequent insults. Nrf2, nuclear factor E2-related factor.'
