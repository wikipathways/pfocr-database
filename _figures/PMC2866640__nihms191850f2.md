caption: Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and immunoreceptors such as the T cell receptor
  (TCR) activate phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), which hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) releasing inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol (DG). InsP3
  and loss of calcium binding on STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) induces calcium
  release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Calcium-release-activated calcium channels
  (CRACs), including Orai1, are then opened, allowing a sustained influx of extracellular
  calcium. Calmodulin (CAM) binds calcium and in turn the phosphatase calcineurin
  (CaN). Binding of calcium to the calcineurin regulatory B subunit (CaNB) exposes
  the calmodulin-binding site on the catalytic A subunit (CaNA). An autoinhibitory
  sequence in calcineurin is then released from the catalytic pocket, and the phosphatase
  can dephosphorylate cytoplasmic nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Inactive
  NFAT is basally hyperphosphorylated; dephosphorylation promotes nuclear translocation
  and gene transcription. NFAT cooperates with multiple other transcription factors,
  including the activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex (Fos-Jun dimers). RTK and TCR activation
  also stimulates signaling through the MAPK pathway leading to AP-1 activation. The
  NFAT activation cycle is maintained through complex mechanisms of maintenance kinases
  that retain cytoplasmic hyperphosphorylated NFAT, such as casein kinase-1 (CK1)
  and dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2), as well
  as nuclear export kinases such as CK1, DYRK1 and GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase-3).
  These kinases are counteracted by negative regulators of calcineurin, such as DSCR1
  (Down syndrome candidate region 1). Pharmacological antagonists of calcineurin,
  such as FK506 and cyclosporin A (CsA) are potent inhibitors of NFAT dephosphorylation
  and nuclear accumulation.
