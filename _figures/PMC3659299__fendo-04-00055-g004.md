caption: A scheme depicting the current knowledge on PAC1-mediated signaling cascades
  resulting in a variety of neuronal outcomes. PKA was shown to induce ERK1/2 thereby
  contributing to PACAP neuroprotective (Villalba et al., ; Vaudry et al., ; Falluel-Morel
  et al., ; Stumm et al., ) and neurotrophic (Ravni et al., ; Botia et al., ; Monaghan
  et al., ) functions. Action potential (AP) firing induces a CRCT1/CREB mediated
  neuroprotective effect, presumably through NMDA receptor activation and was shown
  to be initiated by PKA activation (Baxter et al., ). NMDA receptor was also shown
  to be indirectly activated by PACAP (Llansola et al., ) or cAMP/PKA signaling (Costa
  et al., ). PAC1/PKA signaling controls cellular apoptosis through inhibition of
  potassium channels (Mei et al., ; Castel et al., ; Pugh and Margiotta, ) or induction
  of calcium channels (Pugh and Margiotta, ). PAC1/PKA-mediated activation of ion
  channels leads to activity-dependent neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity
  (Lee et al., ; Maturana et al., ; Grumolato et al., ; Nishimoto et al., ). The tumor
  suppressor gene Lot1 known as a negative regulator of neuronal precursor proliferation
  was shown to be controlled by PAC1/cAMP/ERK signaling pathway (Fila et al., ). PAC1/PKA-dependent
  phosphorylation of Tau is involved in the control of granule cell migration during
  cerebellar development (Falluel-Morel et al., ). PAC1-mediated cAMP/ERK-dependent
  neurite outgrowth was shown to be regulated via a novel neuritogenic factor NCS
  (Emery and Eiden, ) or Epac/ERK (Gerdin and Eiden, ) pathways. PAC1/Epac was shown
  to regulate neuronal differentiation via activation of p38 kinase along with mobilization
  of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Ster et al., ) as well as Epac/Rit-dependent
  pathway involving CREB signaling (Shi et al., ). PAC1 was demonstrated to induce
  Rit through TrkA/Shc/SOS signaling initiated by Src activation via dual Gs/Epac
  and Gi stimulation (Shi et al., ). PACAP also signals through Gq-linked PLC > IP3 > Ca2+/DAG > PKC,
  and PLD > phosphatidic acid (PA) pathways (Journot et al., ; Makhlouf and Murthy,
  ; Dejda et al., ). PAC1 is a mediator of gene transcription, neuronal differentiation,
  and synaptic development (Masmoudi-Kouki et al., ; Vaudry et al., ; Andero and Ressler,
  ). As an example of functional diversity caused by PAC1 alternative splicing two
  additional PAC1-hop1 signaling pathways are presented on the scheme. They depict
  PAC1-hop1/ARF dependent PLD activation (McCulloch et al., ) and internalization-dependent
  engagement of PI3Kγ/Akt activation (May et al., ). AC, adenylate cyclase; AGS, activator
  of G protein signaling; Akt, serine-threonine protein kinase PKB; cAMP, cyclic adenosine

  Epac, exchange factor directly activated by cAMP; ERK, extracellular signal-regulate
