caption: tmTNF-α induces DOX-resistance of breast cancer cells via its reverse signaling.
  tmTNF-α can be overexpressed in breast cancer cells and tends to induce chemoresistance.
  tmTNF-α constitutively activates both ERK and NF-κB pathways through reverse signaling.
  tmTNF-α promotes GST-π expression via ERK pathway, leading to degradation and detoxification
  of DOX in tumor cells, and tmTNF-α-induced GST-π in turn further activates ERK pathway,
  forming a positive feedback to promote DOX-resistance. tmTNF-α can also upregulate
  antiapoptotic molecules via NF-κB pathway and downregulate proapoptotic molecule,
  resulting in survival and anti-apoptosis of tumor cells. Targeting tmTNF-α may sensitize
  tumor cells to chemotherapy
