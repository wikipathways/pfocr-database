  exact growth rates for the top, middle, and bottom values were as follows: (A) 0.044,
  0.048, and 0.056 h−1, respectively; (B) 0.09, 0.09, and 0.11 h−1, respectively;

  Relative to the glucose uptake rate, assuming Gaussian error propagation, the confidence
  intervals were less than 40% for the TCA cycle, the glyoxylate shunt, and the lower
  part of the EMP pathway, while they were below 15% for all other fluxes. Arrowheads
  indicate the direction of a given flux. CoA, coenzyme A; DHAD, dihydroxyacetone-P;
