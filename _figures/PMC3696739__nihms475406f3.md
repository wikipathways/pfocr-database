caption: PTHrP is secreted from the mammary epithelium (pink) and acts on the mammary
  mesenchyme (blue) to activate signaling via β-catenin. This pathway directs sexual
  dimorphism, in part via regulation of AR expression, and possibly regulates the
  response to BMP signaling. PTHrP signaling, via PTHR1, also upregulates BMPR1a and
  sensitizes mammary mesenchymal cells to BMP4, possibly upregulating BMP signaling
  in the mammary mesenchyme. This pathway is required for bud outgrowth, via MMP2
  and for inhibiting hair folliculogenesis in the nipple, via Msx2. PTHrP signaling
  also maintains mammary epithelial identity via signaling in the mammary mesenchyme,
  although the exact mechanism remains unknown.
