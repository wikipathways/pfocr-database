caption: PC12 cell model of neuronal differentiation. This model shows how a biological
  response is specified by the kinetics and duration of ERK activity, which is achieved
  through the combinatorial integration of activating different Raf isoforms and crosstalk
  with the cAMP signalling system. PC12 cells differentiate in response to the nerve
  growth factor (NGF), but proliferate in response to the epidermal growth factor
  (EGF). Both growth factors utilise the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. The biological response
  is determined by the duration of ERK signalling. Sustained ERK activation results
  in neuronal differentiation. The sustenance of ERK activity is caused by the B-Raf
  isoform, which is activated preferentially by NGF. Differentiation is further enhanced
  by activation of cAMP signalling, which inhibits Raf-1, but promotes B-Raf activity.
