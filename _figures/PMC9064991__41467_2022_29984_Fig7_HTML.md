caption: Proposed reaction pathway involves a reductive quenching photoredox cycle
  for the generation of alkyl radical from dihydroquinazolinone, which is captured
  by Ni(II) oxidative addition complexes to form Ni(III) species for subsequent cross-coupling
  by reductive elimination. The photoredox and nickel catalytic cycles are simultaneously
  closed by electron transfer from reduced photocatalyst to Ni(I) species generated
  post-reductive elimination.
