caption: 'a | Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding to its receptor on
  endothelial cells activates nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) to produce the diffusible
  signaling molecule NO. NO acts in an autocrine manner to stimulate endothelial cell
  growth and motility leading to angiogenesis. VEGF signaling via NO also contributes
  to increasing vascular permeability. NO diffuses into vessel walls, causing arterial
  vessels to relax and increase blood flow. NO also acts in a paracrine manner to
  prevent thrombosis by inhibiting platelet adhesion and aggregation. b | Different
  vascular activities of NO occur on different time scales. c | In endothelial cells,
  VEGF signaling through VEGFR2 activates the phosphatidyinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
  pathway; Akt then phosphorylates human eNOS at Ser1177 , , activating eNOS and decreasing
  its calcium dependence. The kinase Src, which is activated by VEGF, also activates
  eNOS through two mechanisms: phosphorylation of Tyr,  and phosphorylation of heat
  shock protein 90 (Hsp90), which then binds to eNOS and activates NO synthesis .
  Simultaneously, VEGFR2 signaling through phospholipase-Cγ (PLCγ) mobilizes intracellular
  Ca2+, which further activates eNOS in a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent manner, and increases
  AMP kinase (AMPK)-mediated eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177161. NO produced by eNOS
  binds to the prosthetic heme on soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to stimulate cGMP
  synthesis, activating cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK-I) and cGMP-gated channels
  to regulate downstream targets that increase endothelial cell proliferation, migration,
  survival, and permeability. Additional parallel signaling through Src, Akt, and
  the protein kinase C-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (PKC-Raf1-MEK-ERK)
  synergizes with NO/cGMP signaling to support each of these endothelial cell responses.
  In VSMC and platelets, the same downstream pathways are activated by exogenous NO
  diffusing from endothelium.'
