caption: Several mechanisms have been proposed for CSPG-mediated neurite growth inhibition.
  CSPGs may inhibit neurite growth through binding to the receptors including the
  type IIa RPTPs (RPTPσ, LAR, RPTPδ), the Nogo receptors (NgR1 and NgR3) or other
  unknown receptors. CSPGs may suppress neurite growth through blocking or interfering
  other pathways regulating neurite growth, such as integrin pathway, semaphorin pathway,
  EGFR pathway or others. Several intracellular events have been reported to convey
  CSPG functions, including calcium, RhoA/ROCK, Akt, PKC, and MAPK signaling, which
  inhibit neurite growth by affecting microtubule or actin cytoskeleton organization,
  or by altering gene expression and protein synthesis. However, there is still lack
  of information pertaining to how binding of CSPGs to these receptors triggers those
  downstream signaling pathways. For instance, how do the CSPG receptor RPTPs, as
  tyrosine phosphatases, inhibit the serine threonine protein kinase Akt pathway?
