caption: 'The biological process of lactylation. In the cytoplasm, glucose is transported
  into cells and is converted to pyruvate and methylglyoxal. On the one hand, pyruvate
  is converted into L-lactyl-CoA, which then acts as a direct substrate for K (L-la),
  transferring lactyl groups to lysine residues on histones through histone acetyltransferases
  such as p300. On the other hand, methylglyoxal is converted to lactoylglutathione,
  which then generates D (L-la) via nonenzymatic mechanism. Additionally, pyruvate
  can directly produce acetate through two distinct pathways: keto acid dehydrogenases
  and ROS-mediated pyruvate decarboxylation. Furthermore, acetate can be converted
  to acetyl-CoA through ACSS2'
