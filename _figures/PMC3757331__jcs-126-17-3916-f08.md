caption: Revisiting MPF activation. MPF activation is initiated by the generation
  of a threshold level of active Cdk1 in response to progesterone. This step depends
  on the synthesis of Cyclin B and is negatively regulated by PKA. This starter amount
  of active Cdk1 phosphorylates its own regulatory enzymes, Cdc25 and Myt1, and induces
  the accumulation of Mos leading to the activation of the Mos/MAPK pathway. These
  reactions are under the control of PKA and are counteracted by PP2A. Therefore,
  the conversion of inactive pre-MPF into MPF cannot take place unless PP2A is inhibited.
  Gwl is activated by the threshold amount of Cdk1 activity. It phosphorylates ARPP19
  at S67, leading to PP2A inhibition independently of PKA. The MPF auto-amplification
  loop then becomes independent of PKA activity and protein synthesis, irreversibly
  driving the cell into M-phase.

  of MPF independently of PKA in Xenopus oocytes.
