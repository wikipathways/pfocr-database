caption: Mechanisms by which chlamydial infection alters mitochondrial dynamics. (A)
  Chlamydia infects host cells and releases virulence factors through T3SS effectors,
  resulting in potassium efflux from the cell membrane and activation of the NADPH
  oxidase. This induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytoplasm,
  which acts as a secondary signal to activate the NLRX1 protein in the outer mitochondrial
  membrane. The activated NLRX1 protein translocates and binds to mitochondrial complex
  3, resulting in massive mitochondrial ROS production and phosphorylation of the
  serine residue 5 8 5 of DRP1, activating DRP1. (B) Chlamydia triggers the PI3K-ATK-HMD2
  signaling pathway, which results in the ubiquitination of the P53 protein and subsequently
  suppresses the activation of the DRP1 protein. (C) Chlamydia increases host cell
  miRNA-30c-5p production, which binds to the mRNA of the P53 protein and blocks its
  translation, hence inhibiting DRP1 protein activation. (D) Chlamydia produces the
  cdu1 protein, which binds to Mcl-1 and shields it from ubiquitinated degradation,
  hence raising Mcl-1 protein levels and preventing DRP1 oligomerization. (E) C. pneumoniae
  infects host cells, resulting in mitochondria dysfunction and switch of OXPHOS to
  glycolysis, which enhances the bacteria growth.
