caption: 'Top: the 5-HT4 receptor engages Erk1,2 signaling in neurons through a Gs-
  and β-arrestin-independent mechanism that requires activation of the non-receptor
  tyrosine kinase Src. In the intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cell line, 5-HT4 receptor-mediated
  Src activation leads to phospholipase C (PLC)/Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent inhibition
  of the Na+/H+ exchanger. *Constitutively active receptors. Bottom left: the 5-HT2C
  receptor engages Erk1,2 signaling in neurons through a G-protein-independent, β-arrestin-dependent
  mechanism that requires physical association of calmodulin with the receptor’s C-terminal
  domain. Bottom, middle: the 5-HT6 receptor activates the cyclin-dependent kinase
  5 (Cdk5)–Cdc42 signaling pathway in an agonist-independent manner through a reciprocal
  interplay between the receptor and associated Cdk5, by which Cdk5 bound to the receptor
  C-terminal domain phosphorylates the receptor on Ser350, a necessary step in Cdk5-dependent
  activation of Cdc42. Bottom, right: the 5-HT7 receptor binds to and activates Cdk5
  signaling, a process leading to Tau hyperphosphorylation. APP, amyloid precursor
  protein.'
