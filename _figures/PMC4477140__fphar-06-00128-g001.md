caption: Receptor-dependent mechanisms that allosterically activate protein kinase
  C (PKC). G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
  activate distinct phospholipase C (PLC) family enzymes. While the regulatory controls
  for different PLC family enzymes differ, these enzymes act in a similar manner to
  hydrolyze membrane PIP2 leading to the generation of the calcium-mobilizing second
  messenger IP3 and DAG. The redox-sensitive elements in this pathway are highlighted
  in yellow (see text).
