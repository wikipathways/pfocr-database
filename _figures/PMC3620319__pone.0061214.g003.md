caption: The downstream genes with functional consequence in the KEGG “pathway in
  cancer” were selected. The purple arrows imply the relationship between driver gene
  and its downstream genes, and the dark arrows were collected from “pathway in cancer”
  of KEGG. The up-regulated genes are labeled with red color and the down-regulated
  genes are labeled with green color.
