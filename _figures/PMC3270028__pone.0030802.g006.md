caption: (A) Activation of sensors such as RIG-I induces interaction with the signaling
  complex including MAVS, STING, IRF-3 and TBK-1. Activated MAVS interacts with STING,
  which dimerizes, leading to the activation of IKK complex, TBK1 and IKKε . The activation
  of this complex leads to the ubiquitination of RIG-I, STING, IRF-3 and TBK1 and
  the phosphorylatin of STING and IRF-3. Activated the transcription factor IRF-3
  translocates to the nucleus inducing production of IFN. (B) Coronavirus papain-like
  protease domains (depicted here as PLP) interact with STING to block signaling by
  blocking assembly or stability of STING dimers and preventing the ubiquitination
  of signaling proteins, such as RIG-I, TBK1, and IRF-3.
