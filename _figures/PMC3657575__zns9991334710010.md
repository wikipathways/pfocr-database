caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways involved in calpain-mediated
  regulation of dendritic protein synthesis induced by BDNF. Activation of TrkB receptor
  by BDNF results in PI3K activation and subsequent phosphorylation of Akt, leading
  to hamartin/tuberin complex dissociation and degradation by the proteosome (including
  calpain-1 and calpain-2). This in turn relieves mTOR inhibition and stimulates dendritic
  protein synthesis. In parallel, BDNF receptor activation results in ERK-mediated
  phosphorylation/activation of calpain-2, which cleaves PTEN and thus further stimulates
  the PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway.
