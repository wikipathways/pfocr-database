caption: Model of ScuPA D2 of uPAR signaling in endothelial cells and the inhibitory
  role of HKa. ScuPA binds to D1–D3 of uPAR on HUVECs. Interactions with ScuPA with
  endothelial cells induces uPAR to communicate intracellularly through β1-integrins.
  Monoclonal antibody 6S6 to β1-integrin blocks this pathway. Cell stimulation through
  uPAR and integrins requires interactions with VEGFR2. Also, tyrosine inhibitors
  AG-1478 and PP3 to the EGF receptor (EGFR; HER1) block ScuPA signaling. The MEK
  inhibitor PD-98059 also blocks ScuPA-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. LY-294002,
  a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, blocks ScuPA-induced Akt phosphorylation.
  HKa blocks binding of ScuPA to endothelial cells and D2 of uPAR, which leads to
  inhibition of pERK1/2, pAkt (Ser473), and angiogenesis. Inhibition of any step of
  the ScuPA signaling pathways blocks cell proliferation and angiogenesis in HUVEC
  aortic segments in vitro and Matrigel plugs in vivo.
