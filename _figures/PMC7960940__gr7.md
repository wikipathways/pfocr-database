caption: 'IPA network analysis of differentially expressed proteins in G6PC3 deficiencyIngenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA)-based network 1 of the 148 differentially expressed protein
  panel. The network is displayed graphically as nodes (gene/gene products) and edges
  (the biological relationship between nodes). The node color intensity indicates
  the expression of genes: red is upregulated and green is downregulated in plasma.
  The fold change values of differentially expressed proteins are indicated under
  each corresponding node. Node shapes indicate the functional class of the gene product
  as shown in the key.'
