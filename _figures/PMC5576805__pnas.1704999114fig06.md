caption: A schematic representation of the mechanism by which 20E regulates PKCδ expression
  and EcRB1 phosphorylation. (1) 20E via ErGPCR1 and ErGPCR2, Gαq, PLC, calcium ion,
  and CaMKII signaling triggers USP1 phosphorylation and acetylation to modulate formation
  of EcRB1/USP1 transcription complex to bind on EcRE for 20E pathway gene transcription
  based on our previous studies (, ). (2) 20E rapidly up-regulates PKCδ expression
  via EcRB1 and USP1. The overexpressed PKCδ catalytic domain was autophosphorylated
  and localized to the nucleus to phosphorylate EcRB1 at T468. (3) The phosphorylated
  EcRB1 interacts with P-USP1-Ac to form the EcRB1/USP1 transcriptional complex to
  promote apoptotic gene expression and apoptosis. Through this positive feedback
  mechanism, 20E promotes apoptosis during insect metamorphosis.
