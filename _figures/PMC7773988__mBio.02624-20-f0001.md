caption: Modulation of LPS biosynthesis by YejM. The common precursor R-3-hydroxymyristol-ACP
  is used for both LPS synthesis and GPL synthesis in the cytoplasm. LPS synthesis
  begins with the synthesis of the Kdo2-lipid A subdomain that serves as the lipid
  anchor of LPS in the outer membrane. In E. coli, nine enzymes are required for Kdo2-lipid
  A synthesis, which begins with the acylation of UDP N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc)
  by LpxA. The second step of the pathway is catalyzed by LpxC, a deacetylase, and
  is the first committed step for lipid A synthesis. Thus, flux of fatty acids into
  each lipid synthesis pathway is tightly balanced through regulation of (a) LpxC
  which commits fatty acids to LPS synthesis and competes with (b) FabZ which continues
  fatty acid elongation, committing fatty acids to GPL synthesis. The canonical glucosamine
  disaccharide of lipid A is formed by LpxB, an inverting glycosyl transferase that
  condenses two di-acylated precursors to form the first disaccharide intermediate.
  The final steps include the addition of a second phosphate group by LpxK, incorporation
  of the characteristic Kdo sugars by KdtA (WaaA), and additional acylation events
  catalyzed by LpxL and LpxM. The core oligosaccharide is extended in the cytoplasm
  and then the dedicated LPS flippase, MsbA, transports core-lipid A to the periplasmic
  leaflet of the inner membrane (IM). When present, the long-chain O-antigen polysaccharide
  is added in the periplasm but is not shown here for simplicity. Translocation of
  complete LPS to the outer membrane (OM) is carried out by the LPS transport (Lpt)
  system that bridges the IM and OM. The membrane protease FtsH, along with the adaptor
  protein LapB, degrades LpxC and thus controls the rate of LPS synthesis and provides
  metabolic adaptation to various growth conditions. When the need for LPS is high,
  YejM is bound to LapB, thereby preventing proteolytic degradation of LpxC by FtsH.
  However, if LPS begins to accumulate within the periplasm (1), YejM binds to LPS
  to disrupt YejM-LapB interactions (2). This allows for FtsH/LapB degradation (3)
  of LpxC, thus disrupting lipid A synthesis and lowering LPS levels. As noted by
  Clairfeuille and coworkers (), in this model YejM functions as a “rheostat” to regulate
  LpxC levels.
