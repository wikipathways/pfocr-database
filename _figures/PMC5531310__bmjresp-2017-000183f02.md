caption: Arginine metabolism is increased in the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
  lung. (A) The classical arginine metabolic pathway. (B) In all graphs, the metabolic
  data for control lung (NL) are shown in green boxes, and data for IPF lung are represented
  in purple boxes. Quantities are in arbitrary units specific to the internal standards
  for each quantified metabolite and normalised to protein concentration (n=8 for
  each box; y-axis label of metabolic changes is shown as counts×106). We found significantly
  increased polyamines putrescine and spermidine as well as increased 4-hydroxyproline
  and creatine (p<0.05, increase highlighted in red open box and decrease in green
  open box). Increased polyamine levels indicate increased cell proliferation, and
  creatine may provide some of the energy required. Increased 4-hydroxyproline is
  a marker of fibrosis. Decreased aspartate and fumarate may indicate that arginine
  metabolism is shuttling intermediates away from the tricarboxylic acid cycle. 5-MTA,
  5′-methylthioadenosine; ECM, extracellular matrix; OAT,Ornithine aminotransferase.
