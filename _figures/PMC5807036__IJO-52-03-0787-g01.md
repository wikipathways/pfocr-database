caption: Tumorigenic proteins significantly upregulated in the IMR-32 cells mapped
  to the MYCN proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (MYCN) pathway. (A) STRING
  pathway analysis revealed interactions between molecules of activated upstream regulators
  in IMR-32 cells as predicted by IPA. Of importance are the various proteins with
  hubs (multiple edges, red circles), including Sp1 transcription factor (SP1), MYC,
  MYCN, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), high mobility group protein A1 (HMGA1),
  INSR, KIT ligand (KITLG), sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor
  2 (SREBF2) and SREBF1. (B) STRING pathway analysis also focused on the strong interactions
  between the activated upstream regulators which HMGA1, MYCN and BIRC5 mapped to.
  Of particular interest are the hubs, including MYCN, MYC, SP1, HIF-1α, SREBF1, BIRC5,
  HMGA1 and INSR that affiliated with one or more of our validated targets.
