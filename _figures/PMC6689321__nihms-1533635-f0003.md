caption: 'Extensive cross-talk exists between mitogenic signaling pathways and the
  CDK4/6 pathway in cancer cells. First, mitogenic signaling increases cyclin D1 levels
  to increase CDK4/6 activity via several mechanisms (red arrows): (a) PI3K pathway
  signaling reduces cyclin D1 turnover via GSK3β; (b) Ras pathway signaling promotes
  an ERK-dependent upregulation of transcription factors that drive cyclin D gene
  expression; (c) mTORC1 increases cyclin D protein translation; (d) CCND1 transcription
  is increased directly by activated ER (breast cancer) and AR (prostate cancer).
  In addition, these pathways also interact via their convergence on TSC2 and thus
  mTORCl: (a) ART, ERK, and p90RSK each directly phosphorylate TSC2 to activate mTORCl;
  (b) cyclin D-CDK4/6 also bind to and probably phosphorylate TSC2 to increase mTORCl
  activity (dashed line).Rationale for synergistic combination therapy regimens: CDK4/6
  inhibitors limit cell proliferation by reducing RB phosphorylation, but can also
  partially suppress TSC2 phosphorylation. Co-inhibiting the PI3K and/or Ras pathway
  not only reduces cyclin D1 levels (further enforcing RB activation), but also increases
  the suppression of TSC2 phosphorylation, maximizing mTORCl inhibition. Collectively,
  combined activation of RB and inhibition of mTORCl inhibition potently blocks progression
  of cells into S phase.'
