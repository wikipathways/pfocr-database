caption: The mechanism of the protective effect of GGQLD in HUA-induced renal injury.
  The increased UA led to PTEC mitochondrial apoptosis and assembled NLRP3 inflammasomes
  and facilitated IL-1β maturation and thus inflamed the cells, which damaged the
  mitochondria and caused pyroptosis to lead to renal tubule damage. GGQLD protected
  cells from inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways through capsase-9, caspase-8,
  and Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-3, thus alleviating inflammation via inhibition of NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β/GSDMD.
