caption: Proposed model for MALT1 function in NF-κB activation. B-cell receptor (BCR)
  stimulation induces formation of the CBM complex, which controls NF-κB activation
  through at least two different mechanisms. The scaffold function of BCL10 and MALT1
  are required for TRAF6 recruitment and ubiquitination-dependent activation of the
  IKK complex, which phosphorylates IκB proteins. The protease activity of MALT1 also
  contributes to NF-κB activation in an IKK-independent manner, through cleavage of
  an unknown substrate (???). This might control IκBβ degradation, which occurs with
  slower kinetics than IκBα degradation and is sustained (), possibly because it depends
  on additional signaling events. Alternatively, MALT1 protease activity might control
  NF-κB1 activation at the level of its nuclear translocation or transcriptional activity.
  The presence of oncogenic mutations in CARMA1 or its upstream regulators may render
  this pathway constitutively active in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the activated
  B-cell type (ABC DLBCL) (see text for details).
