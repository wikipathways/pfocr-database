caption: 'HIF-1α Signaling Pathways in control Fibroblasts. Colored nodes refer to
  differentially expressed genes found in our dataset control fibroblasts hypoxia
  vs. normoxia (green down-regulated; red up-regulated). Uncolored nodes were not
  identified as differentially expressed in our experiment and were integrated into
  the computationally generated IPA networks. This figure was created with Ingenuity
