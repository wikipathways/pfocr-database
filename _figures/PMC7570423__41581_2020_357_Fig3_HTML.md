caption: a | Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly
  infects endothelial cells owing to their high expression levels of angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). After binding by
  SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is internalized, and the lack of ACE2 on endothelial cells favours
  the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin
  II (Ang II) hyperactivity. Inhibition of ACE2 by binding of SARS-CoV-2 reduces the
  ACE2-mediated conversion of Ang II to Ang 1–7, the vasoactive ligand of the MAS
  receptor. The reduction of MAS receptor activation induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype
  through increased activation of type 1 angiotensin receptors (AT1R). Additionally,
  the reduction in levels of ACE2 limits the degradation of des-Arg9 bradykinin (DABK)
  into inactive peptides, ultimately leading to increased pro-thrombotic signalling
  via the activation of bradykinin receptors (BKRs). b | SARS-CoV-2 also activates
  the complement system — an integral component of the innate immune response. The
  complement cascade can be activated by three different pathways, the classical,
  the lectin and the alternative pathway, that resolve around the formation of the
  C3 convertases that cleave C3, generating the pro-inflammatory peptide C3a and large
  amount of C3b that opsonizes pathogens. C3b also forms the C5 convertase, which
  leads to release of the potent anaphylatoxin C5a, as well as the fragment C5b, responsible
  for the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) C5b–9 on target cells, which
  is considered to be the terminal event of complement activation. In addition, complexes
  of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and viral antigens might induce endothelial cell
  injury through activation of the C1 complex of the classical pathway and induction
  of antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADC). c | Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  released by activated macrophages amplify the vicious cycle of vascular integrity
  disruption, vessel coagulation and thrombosis by degrading the endothelial glycocalyx,
  activating the coagulation system and dampening anticoagulant mechanisms. The adhesive
  phenotype of endothelial cells induced by inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  promotes infiltration of neutrophils, which produce large amounts of histotoxic
  mediators, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular
  traps (NETs), ultimately leading to injury of endothelial cells. d | Activated endothelial
  cells initiate coagulation by expressing P-selectin, von Willebrand factor (vWf)
  and fibrinogen, leading to massive platelet binding, fibrin formation and clotting
  of red blood cells (RBCs), ultimately resulting in systemic thrombosis and disseminated
  intravascular coagulation.
