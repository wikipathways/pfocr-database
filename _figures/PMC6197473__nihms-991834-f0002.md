caption: Snapshot of protein-protein interactions involving p85α (the “p85α network”).The
  binding to PTEN and to BRD7-XBP1 has a negative effect on PI3K activity (red color),
  the first by stabilizing PTEN, the second via p85α depletion (, , –). The possible
  consequences of such a depletion on the p85α-PTEN interaction are not known. It
  is noteworthy that both p85α and p85β can bind to BRD7-XBP1. The interaction between
  p85α and SHP2 could impinge on the RTK-RAS pathway as well as on PI3K; molecular
  mechanisms remain to be determined (). The binding and GAP activity of p85α on small
  GTPases RAC, CDC42, and RAB5 affects the cytoskeleton and endocytosis (, , , , ).
  Failure of p85α to bind to RAB5 induces oncogenic cellular transformation (). The
  p85α splice variants p55 and p50 are discussed only briefly in this review. For
  the sake of simplicity, the figure ignores the distinction between p55α and p55γ.
