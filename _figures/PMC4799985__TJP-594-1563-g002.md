caption: 'Damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are endogenous TLR4 ligands
  that are among the factors released from stressed and dying cells. Chronic intermittent
  hypoxia increases several DAMPs that can bind TLR4 in microglia and activate canonical
  inflammatory signalling cascades. TLR4 signalling utilizes two different pathways:
  MyD88‐dependent and TRIF‐dependent. The MyD88‐dependent pathway increases pro‐inflammatory
  gene expression through activation of the MAP kinases ERK, p38 and JNK, and transcription
  factors including NF‐κB and AP‐1. The TRIF‐dependent pathway induces phosphorylation
  of IRF3, which then translocates to the nucleus and induces expression of type I
  interferons (IFNs) such as IFNβ and anti‐inflammatory cytokines. Both MyD88 and
  TRIF proteins are increased peripherally and centrally after CIH.'
