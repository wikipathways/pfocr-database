caption: Predicted mechanism of sialic acid-binding lectin (SBL)-induced apoptosis
  and proposed factors that influence the effects of SBL. SBL binds to the cancer
  cell surface and then internalizes into cell. It subsequently degrades RNA in the
  cytosol leading to the induction of an apoptotic signal. The existence of a SBL
  receptor, a sialylated glycoconjugate, has been speculated. SBL induces apoptosis
  in a caspase activation-dependent manner. SBL causes mitochondria perturbations
  and also endoplasmic reticulum stress independently. The mitochondrial pathway is
  intensely involved in apoptosis induced by SBL. The proposed factors that influence
  the effects of SBL are indicated on the right and their sites of action are shown.
  The extent of differentiation and expression of ER are also factors, but their sites
  of action remain to be elucidated.
