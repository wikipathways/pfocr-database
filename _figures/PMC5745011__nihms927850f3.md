caption: In the amyloid-β (Aβ)-independent pathway (pink box), a deficient PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ
  signaling leads to pericyte dysfunction and/or degeneration resulting in microvascular
  and cerebral blood flow (CBF) reductions and oligemia (brain hypoperfusion), from
  one hand, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown with accumulation of blood-derived
  toxic products in the brain, from the other. BBB breakdown leads to capillary edema
  contributing to capillary hypoperfusion and hypoxia. In the Aβ- pathway (purple
  box), oligemia leads to increased Aβ production, whereas BBB breakdown and deficient
  PDGFRβ signaling can both lead to faulty Aβ clearance, which in turn promotes Aβ
  accumulation in the brain. Synergistic action of Aβ-independent and Aβ pathway lead
  to accelerated tau hyperphosphorylation, formation of neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic
  dysfunction and loss, and neuronal degeneration, which altogether promotes behavioral
  deficits and dementia (blue box).
