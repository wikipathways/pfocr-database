caption: 'A, The cartoon represents the PI3K/AKT pathway. Upon activation of receptor
  tyrosine kinase (RTK), PI3K generates PI3Ps from PI at the inner leaflet of the
  plasma membrane. These PI3Ps binds the pleckstrin homology (PH) of AKT. In resting
  cells, AKT is in the cytosol in a closed conformation (PH-in). Upon binding the
  PI3Ps, the PH domain changes conformation, allowing AKT to be fully activated by
  phosphorylation on the threonine (Thr) 308 residue and the serine (Ser) 473 residue,
  resulting in the PH-out conformation. PTEN is the corresponding PI3 phosphatase
  which dephosphorylates PI3Ps. The red dot corresponds to the different AKT PH domain
  inhibitors that have been described to date: allosteric inhibitors which bind the
  PH-in conformation, sulfonamide based compounds which bind the PH domain within
  the PI3Ps binding pocket and compounds which inhibit AKT-TCL1 interaction at the
  hinge region.B, Fully activated AKT phosphorylates a wide variety of substrates,
  involved in apoptosis, translation and cell cycle, and cell survival.'
