caption: (A) UCA1 can enhance expression of AKT1 and activate it through phosphorylation.
  AKT1 activates mTOR, thus facilitating STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.
  These events lead to over-expression of HK2. In addition, mTOR inhibits miR-143
  which targets HK2. Therefore, mTOR has a prominent effect in enhancing HK2 expression
  (). (B) HK2 is located in the mitochondrial membrane and facilitates conversion
  of glucose to glucose-6-phosphte. Glucose-6-phosphate enters the pentose phosphate
  pathway to produce pentose phosphate for nucleic acid synthesis which is needed
  for proliferation of cancer cells. In addition, glucose-6-phosphate can be converted
  to pyruvate to enter tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and produce citrate which is
  needed for the synthesis of membrane components (phospholipids and cholesterol),
  thus being necessary for tumor proliferation ().
