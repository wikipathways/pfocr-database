caption: Dual MC4R signaling model to account for “rescue” of Ay phenotype by alterations
  in MC4R trafficking. A, MC4R is shown with constitutive cAMP-dependent and hypothetical
  cAMP-independent activity (possibly the signaling pathway activated by β-defensins
  and represented in the figure by pERK). B, α-MSH up-regulates both the cAMP-dependent
  and -independent signaling pathways (step 1) (arrow/text size indicates direction
  of effect). cAMP is generated only while the MC4R is on the plasma membrane; pERK
  remains up-regulated following receptor internalization (step 2) until ligand and
  receptor dissociate along the endocytic recycling pathway (step 3). Upon α-MSH withdrawal,
  cAMP and pERK return to basal levels (step 4). C, ASP antagonizes cAMP signaling
  through its C terminus (step 1) and pERK signaling through its N terminus (step
  2) (requiring MGRN1 and ATRN). pERK is only completely attenuated following ASP-dependent
  MC4R degradation in the lysosome (step 3). Loss-of-function mutations in ATRN or
  MGRN1 impair the ASP-dependent lysosomal trafficking of MC4R, preventing the full
  reduction of pERK signaling and allowing basal cAMP-independent activity to be maintained.
  The hypothetical pERK signaling pathway is analogous to that of the activated EGF
  receptor; ERK signaling initiated at the cell surface continues from within the
  cell until the EGF receptor enters the lysosome.
