caption: Proteins involved in chromosomal fragility. During replication fork progression,
  replication stress can uncouple the helicase complex from the DNA polymerase, allowing
  for single-stranded DNA to form stable secondary structure that can cause fork stall
  and collapse. Proteins in-volved in the ATR pathway (light green box) are important
  for fragile site stability, as loss of expression leads to an increase in breakage.
  Sever-al proteins able to recognize and resolve DNA secondary structures (purple
  box) are also essential for fragility. Repair pathway proteins, such as those in
  NHEJ (dark green box) and translesion synthesis (blue box), also stabilize fragile
  sites.
