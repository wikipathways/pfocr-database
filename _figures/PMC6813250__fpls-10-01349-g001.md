caption: The core components of the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway in rice,
  tobacco, and Arabidopsis. CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) protein, JASMONATE ZIM
  DOMAIN PROTEIN (JAZ), and MYC constitute the core signal transduction mechanism
  of JA signaling. Under control conditions, the endogenous level of JA–isoleucine
  (Ile) is very low plants. JAZ repressors bind to MYC2 to inhibit its transcriptional
  activation on downstream genes. Under stress conditions, the endogenous level of
  JA–Ile is largely activated, which is perceived by JA receptor COI1. Then SKP1/CULLIN/F-box
  (SCF)COI1 binds to JAZs for ubiquitination and degradation through the 26S proteasome
  pathway, resulting in the release of the downstream transcription factors (TFs)
  such as MYCs and the activation of JA responses.
