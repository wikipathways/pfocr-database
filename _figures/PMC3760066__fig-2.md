caption: Two TLR signaling pathways. LPS binds to coreceptors CD14 and MD2 that present
  it to TLR4, causing homodimerization and assembly of TIR domain-containing docking
  platforms that interact with sorting and signaling adapter proteins. TLR signals
  via Mal-MyD88 from the cell surface, leading to recruitment and activation of IRAK
  kinases and engagement of downstream adapters, kinases, and induction of proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines. After translocation to the endosomal compartment, TLR4
  associates with TRAM and TRIF, engages TRAF-3, and activates TBK-1 and IKK-ɛ kinases,
  leading to phosphorylation, activation, and translocation of IRF3. By engaging RIP-1
  and TRAF6, this pathway also leads to delayed activation of MAPKs and NF-κB. NF-κB
  and IRF-3 bind to consensus elements within the interferon (IFN)-β promoter, leading
  to expression of type I IFN and type I IFN-dependent genes.
