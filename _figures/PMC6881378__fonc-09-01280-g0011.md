caption: Proposed mechanisms for the role of MC mediators in response to tumor cells.
  MC mediators may alter hematologic tumor cell survival by modulating the histamine
  receptor expression differentially in different tumor cell lines, thereby causing
  opposing effects on downstream signaling events and molecules affecting survival,
  apoptotic pathway, mitochondrial health, and cell cycle in these tumor cells (A)
  In YAC-1 tumor cells, MCs cause down regulation of histamine receptors H1R, H2R,
  and H4R receptor. Out of these receptors H2R (inhibited by ranitidine) and H4R (inhibited
  by JNJ7777120) may be further involved in growth inhibition/reduced survival of
  YAC-1 cells. MC mediators cause further down regulation of β-catenin pathway. the
  combined effects lowers the expression level of COX-2, Survivin, Bcl-2, PARP protein,
  and enhance caspase-3 subsequently leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
  tumor cells (B) In EL4 cells, MCs cause up-regulation of histamine receptors H1R,
  H2R, and H4R receptor. Out of these receptors H1R (inhibited by pyrilamine), H2R
  (inhibited by ranitidine), and H4R (inhibited by JNJ7777120) may be further involved
  in proliferation and increased survival of EL4 cells. MCs mediators up regulate
  β-catenin pathway enhancing cell growth. The combined effects increase the expression
  level of COX-2, Survivin, Bcl-2, and downregulatecaspase-3 subsequently leading
  to increased cell growth. (C) In L1210 cells MCs cause up-regulation of H1R only
  while H2R and H4R were not affected. Also these receptors may not be involved in
  growth of these cells. MC mediators do not alter β-catenin pathway subsequently
  leading no effect on cell growth.
