caption: Schematic representation of the interactions between the Hippo and Wnt/β-catenin
  signalling pathways, based on ,  and this study. The Hippo pathway activation induces
  phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic translocation of YAP and TAZ, thereby
  suppressing TEAD-target gene transcription. At the same time, phosphorylated YAP
  and TAZ in the cytoplasm bind to Dvl and suppress its phosphorylation (). Moreover,
  YAP and TAZ bind to β-catenin and suppress its nuclear translocation (this study).
  In cardiomyocytes, YAP and β-catenin are recruited to common target genes (including
  Sox2 and Snai2) through TEAD and TCF transcription factors, respectively, and cooperatively
  activate these genes (). The Hippo pathway activation-induced cytoplasmic translocation
  of YAP suppresses expression of these genes (). Thus, the Hippo pathway activation
  suppresses Wnt/β-catenin signalling through multiple mechanisms.
