caption: Proposed model for the regulation of MLK3 by CDK1 and CDK2 in ovarian cancer
  cell cycle progression. Phosphorylation of MLK3 by CDK2 on Ser770 during late G1/S
  phase increases MLK3 activity, which causes activation of the JNK pathway. In late
  G2 and early M phases, phosphorylation of MLK3 by CDK1 on Ser548 inhibits MLK3 activity
  and causes inactivation of the JNK pathway, thereby allowing ovarian cancer cells
  to progress through the cell cycle. CDK1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1; CDK2, cyclin-dependent
  kinase 2; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MLK3, mixed lineage kinase 3.
