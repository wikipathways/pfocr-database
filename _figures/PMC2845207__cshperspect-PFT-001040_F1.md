caption: The main energy-generating metabolic pathways, and their regulation by p53.
  By promoting oxidative phosphorylation and inhibiting glycolysis, p53 might oppose
  the Warburg effect that is seen in many cancers. Promotion of the pentose phosphate
  pathway would also provide survival functions and may contribute to anabolic pathways
  necessary for damage repair.
