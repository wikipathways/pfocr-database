caption: A covalent interstrand cross-link (ICL) (red) results in a stalled replication
  fork, which is recognized by the FA core complex (cyan), including the subunit FANCL
  (yellow) that has E3 Ubiquitin ligase activity. FANCL pairs with the E2 conjugating
  enzyme, Ube2T (orange), and together they monoubiquitinate FANCD2 and FANCI (purple),
  resulting in their localization to the DNA, and recruitment of downstream repair
  factors (green) that coordinate resolution of the lesion and the stalled replication
  fork.
