caption: A, 1000 mM NaCl is deposited on airway surfaces following inhalation of nebulized
  ∼6% hypertonic saline. B, in NL airways, the increase in the NaCl concentration
  following HS deposition increases the electrochemical driving force for Na+ to move
  transcellularly through ENaC (orange arrows) as well as increasing the electrochemical
  driving force for Na+ to move through the paracellular pathway (not shown). Importantly,
  the unphysiologically large increase in the ASL Cl- concentration now generates
  a sufficiently large electrochemical driving force for transcellular Cl- absorption
  via CFTR, with the some Cl- also moving through the paracellular path (∼33%; not
  shown). The Na+ and Cl- that enters the cell in response to the HS-induced NaCl
  concentration gradient on the airway surface exits the cell through the basolateral
  Na+-K+-ATPase, a basolateral Cl- channel and the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (not
  shown). Concomitantly, H2O moves in the opposite direction from the serosa into
  the ASL both through aquaporins and paracellularly (green arrows) to increase ASL
  height, although due to the rapid, passive transcellular absorption of NaCl, the
  NaCl-dependent increase in ASL height is less than would be predicted if all 1000
  mM NaCl remained on airway surfaces. C, following this period of rapid equilibration,
  ASL height is moderately raised as compared to A. D, Due to dilution of sensor molecules
  in the ASL, isotonic Na+ led absorption returns ASL height to a depth of 7 μm. E,
  even though an increased electrochemical gradient for Cl- entry is also generated
  by HS addition in CF airways, Cl- cannot enter the cell due to the absence of the
  CFTR Cl- channel in the apical membrane. Since Cl- is not absorbed to preserve electroneutrality,
  this also retards Na+ absorption (orange arrows). Thus, NaCl absorption must occur
  in CF airways via the paracellular pathway (not shown) which has only ∼33% of the
  capacity of the transcellular pathway. This results in a smaller dissipation of
  available osmoles and a larger steady state ASL height (F). G, Isotonic Na+ hyperabsorption
  results in isonoic removal of this ASL with time.
