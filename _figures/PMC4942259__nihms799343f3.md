caption: ApoE4 is a major therapeutic target to prevent or slow Alzheimer disease
  and several other neurodegenerative disorders. ApoE4 is synthesized primarily by
  astrocytes but to a lesser extent by neurons (injury to neurons stimulates apoE
  production). I, ApoE4 synthesis by neurons triggers neuron-specific proteolysis,
  generating a series of neurotoxic fragments that escape the secretory pathway and
  stimulate tau-phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction. The unique structural
  feature of apoE4—domain interaction—is responsible for stimulating the proteolysis,
  and blocking apoE4 domain interaction with apoE4 structure correctors prevents the
  formation and the neurotoxic effects of the fragments and protects against neurodegeneration
  and impaired cognition. II, The accelerated degradation of apoE4 by astrocytes (and
  to a lesser extent the increased proteolysis of apoE4 in neurons) results in decreased
  apoE4 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and central nervous system (CNS).
  [It has been postulated that this contributes to decreased amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance.]
  In addition to lower levels of apoE4, apoE4 has a decreased lipid-binding capacity.
  ApoE4 domain interaction is also associated with decreased apoE4 levels and decreased
  affinity for lipids. ApoE4 structure correctors can restore the apoE4 levels and
  enhance lipid binding. ER indicates endoplasmic reticulum.
