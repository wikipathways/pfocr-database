caption: 'In PDA cells, E47 directed an integrated program of gene expression that
  controlled cell-cycle progression. (A–E) KEGG cell-cycle pathway reflecting E47-dependent
  alterations in expression of cell-cycle control genes in each cell line based on
  RNA-seq data. (F) Western blot analysis after induction of E47 showed increased
  CDKN1A/p21CIP1 protein. (G) Western blot analysis after induction of E47 showed
  increased CDKN1B/p27KIP1. (H) shRNA knockdown of CDKN1B/p27KIP1 in PANC-1/E47 cells
  resulted in an increased number of Ki67-positive cells after induction of nuclear
  E47. Data represent the mean of 6 separate fields, each with a minimum of 100 cells
  analyzed by an unpaired t test. Error bars are ± SEM. (I) Left: Western blot analysis
  showed increased p53-pSER15 in response to 2 × 1610 cGy of γ-irradiation (20 min
  of exposure on 2 consecutive days using a Gammacell40 Exactor, Research Irradiator
  with cesium 137 radiation source) to induce the DDR. Cells were harvested 3 hours
  after the second exposure. Right: Western blot analysis showed no increase in p53-pSER15
  in response to induction of E47. ∗∗P ≤ .01. ∗∗∗∗P ≤ .0001.'
