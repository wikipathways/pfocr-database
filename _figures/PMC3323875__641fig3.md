caption: Feedback inhibition mediated by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Pathway cross-talk
  and inhibitory feedback circuits induced by activated components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway are shown. Pathway connections that represent mechanisms of negative feedback
  are denoted by a red line. Disruption of the feedback circuits by inhibitor treatment
  can alter the effectiveness of drug therapy. Transcriptional events that occur downstream
  from S6K and FOXO are also indicated.
