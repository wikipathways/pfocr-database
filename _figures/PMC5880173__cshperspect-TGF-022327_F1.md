caption: The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway and potential strategies for
  therapeutic modulation. (1) Activation of the BMP pathway occurs via interaction
  between dimeric BMP ligands and complexes of type I (e.g., ALK-2 and ALK-3) and
  type II receptors (BMPRII, ActRII, or ActRIIB). This step may be inhibited by delivery
  of extracellular ligand traps such as naturally occurring antagonists, receptor
  decoys, or neutralizing antibodies. Alternatively, BMP ligand availability may be
  enhanced through delivery of exogenous ligands or inhibiting endogenous extracellular
  BMP antagonists by neutralizing antibodies or small molecules. (2) Ligand binding
  leads to activation of the type I receptors by type II receptors and subsequent
  phosphorylation of the receptor-activated Smads 1, 5, and 8 (R-Smads) along with
  other pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), and PI3K-Akt. The kinase activities of the type I receptors
  may be blocked by small molecule inhibitors such as LDN-193189. The BMP pathway
  inhibitors FKBP12 and casein kinase 2 endogenously limit the activities of the type
  I receptors and may be inactivated by delivery of FK506 and CK2.3, respectively,
  to increase BMP signal transduction. (3) R-Smads may perform Smad4-independent activities
  such as regulating microRNA processing or associate with Smad4 or other transcription
  factors to control gene regulatory networks. Persistence of BMP signaling may be
  modulated by regulating the Smurf1-mediated ubiquitylation of Smad effector proteins
  by disrupting Smurf1 interaction with R-Smads by small molecule inhibitors or by
  increasing Smurf1 protein levels. (4) R-Smad-dependent and R-Smad-independent events
  are integrated in a context-dependent manner to control cellular activity.
