caption: 'TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced signaling pathways.
  The interaction between TRAIL and its membrane receptors TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 may
  activate three different signaling pathways: non-death, leading to nuclear facotr
  κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) activation; death leading either
  to apoptosis or to necroptosis. In the absence of inhibitory signals, the apoptotic
  signaling pathway is activated and triggers apoptosis. In the apoptotic signaling
  pathway, binding of TRAIL to its membrane receptors TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 induces
  the recruitment of FADD (fas-associated protein with death domain) and Caspase-8
  at the level of the cytoplasmic tail of these receptors, forming DISC (death-inducing
  signaling complex) or Complex 1. In this complex pro-Caspase-8 is activated to Caspase-8,
  determining the release of active Caspase-8 in the cytosol initiating the induction
  of the Caspase apoptotic cascade. In some cells, the mitochondrial amplification
  loop is required to induce the activation of Caspase-3, through activation of Bid,
  mitochondrial activation with release of the apoptosome, containing activated Caspase-9,
  required for Capsase-3 activation. In some cells, TRAIL stimulation may result in
  the activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway, with production of inflammatory cytokines.
  NF-kB activation via TRAIL-R activation is promoted through the formation a FADDosome
  complex, containing FADD, Caspase-8 and RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine
  protein kinase 1); the ubiquitin linkages created by the c-IAPs assembled to the
  FADDosome lead to the recruitment of linear ubiquitin chains; modified RIPK1 then
  induces the recruitment of two protein complexes, the TAB/TAK (TGFβ-activated binding/TGFβ-activated
  kinase) complex and the IKK (I Kappa B kinase) complexes, with subsequent NF-kB
  activation and induction of inflammatory cytokines production. Under conditions
  where Caspase-8 activity is inhibited, the dissociated DISC complex can interact
  with RIPK1 and RIPK3 to form a molecular complex, which determines RIPK3 and MLKL
  (mixed lineage kinase domain-like) activation and then necroptosis.'
