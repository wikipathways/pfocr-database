caption: 'Overview of the differentially expressed genes and DNA (hydroxy)methylation
  levels within the TRP metabolic pathway and NAD pathway. Within the TRP metabolic
  pathway, a total of 12 genes exhibited significant differential gene expression,
  while 20 genes were differentially expressed within the NAD pathway. Genes exhibiting
  up-regulation in expression are highlighted with red box, whereas those with down-regulation
  are indicated by blue box. Genes with altered DNA (hydroxy)methylation levels are
  denoted by circular markers, with distinct colors representing specific modifications:
  5mC (green), 5hmC (purple), and 5uC (orange)'
