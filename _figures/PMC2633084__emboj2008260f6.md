caption: 'Stepwise pathway for secondary siRNA biogenesis and spreading of methylation.
  Proteins whose functions have been demonstrated in this study are shown in white
  letters on dark boxes. Top: in non-silenced plants containing the target locus (T)
  only, the targeted enhancer region (black box) is unmethylated and the nascent RNA,
  which normally does not interfere with GFP expression, is presumably transcribed
  by Pol II because it is still detectable in an nrpd1 mutant. Bottom: in the presence
  of the silencer locus (S), GFP expression is silenced by primary RdDM (blue ‘m''),
  which is induced by hairpin-derived, DCL3-dependent 24-nt primary siRNAs (blue dashes).
  Primary RdDM attracts the secondary siRNA-generating machinery, which includes Pol
  IV, RDR2 and DCL3. In this model, Pol IV transcribes the methylated template to
  produce the nascent RNA, which is copied and diced by RDR2 and DCL3, respectively,
  to produce 24-nt secondary siRNAs (red dashes) that guide secondary RdDM (red ‘m'')
  in the downstream region (black shade). Pol IV may also transcribe the double-stranded
  RNA to sustain secondary siRNA production once the cycle is initiated (). In both
  cases, Pol IV transcribes a precursor of secondary siRNAs. Whether AGO cleavage
  of the nascent RNA is required to provide substrates for RDR2 is still not known.
  siRNA-guided de novo methylation requires DRD1, DMS3 and Pol V () and is presumably
  catalysed by DRM2 ().'
