caption: '(A) Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomics network of Trp and nicotinamide
  metabolism in tumors from 12 patients. Major paths of Trp and NAD+ metabolism are
  marked: 1) Kyn generation upstream of kynurenate (Kyna) production and nicotinamide
  metabolism (blue lines); 2) serotonin and melatonin metabolism (red lines); 3) Preiss-Handler
  pathway for NAD+synthesis (brown); 4) de novo synthesis pathway for NAD+synthesis
  (purple); 5) salvage pathway for NAD+synthesis and nicotinamide metabolism (orange).
  (B) Correlation network of genes and metabolites in Trp metabolism and Nic metabolism
  pathways clustered by greedy maximization of modularity. Four clusters were identified:
  cluster Kyn, cluster Ser, cluster NAD, and cluster Nic. (C) Kyn reduction, serotonin
  elevation, and Nic elevation scores from D00 to D15 in samples evaluated by transcriptomics
  and metabolomics. (D) Linear regression analysis was performed for associations
  between changes in SAM:SAH ratio and scores were: the Kyn (R2=0.63) and Nic (R2=0.44)
  clusters, and serotonin cluster (R2=0.08).'
