caption: ROCK1 and ROCK2 may play role in several processes involved in NASH pathogenesis.
  In hepatocytes, lipotoxicity leads to cleavage-mediate ROCK1 kinase activation,
  which, in turn, promotes release of extracellular vesicles. Endocannabinoids increased
  upon high-fat diet stimulate endocannabinoid receptor on hepatocytes, leading to
  ROCK1 activation and subsequent inhibition of 5’ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
  which results in stimulation of the sterol regulatory element-binding transcription
  factor 1 (SREBP1c)-mediated lipogenic pathway. ROCK isoforms in myeloid cells may
  be involved in cytokine production and cell migration, as treatment with ROCK1/2
  inhibitors prevents these processes. In hepatic stellate cells, ROCK activation
  has been reported during cell activation, migration and contraction.
