caption: Cytokine signaling via the JAK/STAT pathway. A cytokine, such as leptin,
  binds to its receptor on the plasma membrane. The cytokine receptor is associated
  with the Janus kinase (JAK; “Just Another Kinase”). JAK phosphorylates two receptor
  tyrosines, after which JAK is recognized by STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator
  of Transcription). Subsequently, STAT is also phosphorylated by JAK. Two phosphorylated
  STATs form a dimer. The STAT dimer acts as a transcription factor. It binds to the
  promoter parts of genes affected by that cytokine (“target genes”). These genes
  are then transcribed into mRNA (DNA to mRNA) and translated into proteins (mRNA
  to protein). Proteins expressed via this JAK/STAT pathway have functions in proliferation,
  differentiation, growth and apoptosis. Together they form the products of the “Cytokine
  Inducible Genes” (CIG). Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) is also a CIG product.
  SOCS inhibits the JAK/STAT pathway and thus cytokine signaling. This creates a negative
  feedback loop. Modified from Morris, Kershaw and Babon [].
