caption: Brain–heart relationship in Parkinson’s disease. (A) Changes in cardiac sympathetic
  pathways. The decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) either at the brain or cardiac
  level, induces alterations in noradrenaline (NA) metabolism. In PD patients, alpha-synuclein
  aggregates can be found in the myocardial tissue and in cardiac-related brain regions,
  such as the locus coeruleus (LC), nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), and the
  rostro ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). Altogether, these abnormalities in the autonomic
  system are related to the development of cardiac dysfunction. (B) Schematic representation
  of the catecholamines’ biosynthetic pathway. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic
  amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH), phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase
  (PNMT), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), monoamine oxidase (MAO). Chemical structures
  were obtained from the DrugBank database.
