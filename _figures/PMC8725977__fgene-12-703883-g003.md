caption: Methylation and its function in the genome of healthy and cancer cells. Cytosine
  methylation in cells is regulated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). By switching
  methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), methylation
  is done in the CPG Islands in the promoter of genes. Normal cell promoters are immune
  to methylation, resulting in gene transcription. However, in mutant and cancerous
  cells in the promoter regions of the genes, hypermethylation is done and inhibits
  the transcription of such genes, such as tumor suppressor genes, as a result of
  gene silencing.
