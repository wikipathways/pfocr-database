caption: Regulation of metabolism and fertility by the CR. BMAL1, CLOCK and Per through
  SIRT1 pathway inhibit of insulin resistance. RORα, Per2, and Rer-erbα can inhibit
  adipogenesis, BAML1 promote adipogenesis by mTORC2/Akt signalling pathway. BMAL1-KO,
  Cry deficient, and Per1/2 mutation cause decreased fertility.
