caption: 'Effects of intestinal bacteria and their metabolites on physical barriers.
  The intercellular gaps between IECs are blocked by TJs, AJs and desmosomes. TJs
  are primarily composed of ZO-1, claudins, and occludins. Pathogenic bacteria and
  their cytotoxic byproduct, LPS, suppress occludin expression and induce ZO-1 aggregation
  by activating the TLR4/MyD88/p38 signaling pathway, upregulating Cdkn1a, and triggering
  NF‒κB signaling, ultimately disrupting intercellular junctions. C. jejuni-secreted
  HtrA compromises the epithelial barrier by inhibiting Cldn8 expression, thereby
  increasing paracellular permeability. In addition, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-13 further
  increase paracellular permeability by promoting the expression of Cldn2. The invasion
  of Fusobacterium nucleatum and the secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ activate
  MLCK1, leading to occludin internalization via myosin light chain phosphorylation,
  which increases intestinal permeability and facilitates gut microbiota translocation.
  Divertin, a small molecule, can specifically bind to the IgCAM domain in MLCK1 to
  inhibit its function. Conversely, probiotics such as L. reuteri and Bifidobacterium
  activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, promoting the proliferation of intestinal stem
  cells and restoring intestinal TJs. (Cdkn1a: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor;
  IECs: intestinal epithelial cells; TJs: tight junction; AJs: adherens junction;
  LPS: lipopolysaccharide; ZO-1: ZO1 tight junction protein; MLCK1: myosin light chain
  kinase)'
