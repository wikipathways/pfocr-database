caption: Nur77 in glucose metabolism. In the liver, Nur77 overexpression induces the
  expression of genes associated with gluconeogenesis in mice, such as fructose diphosphatase
  1 (FBP1) and enolase‐3 (Eno3), thereby stimulating glucose production in vivo and
  in vitro and raising blood sugar levels. In addition, the first and rate‐limiting
  step of gluconeogenesis is catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK1);
  Nur77 enhances gluconeogenesis by modulating p300 activity and preventing Ubc9‐PEPCK1
  interactions, which attenuate ubiquitination and maintain PEPCK1 stability—especially
  during energy restriction. In skeletal muscle, Nur77 is involved in the expression
  of glycolytic genes, including glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), phosphofructokinase
  (PFK), and phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (PGAM2). Nur77 also activates the sympathetic
  nervous system during acute stress, thereby promoting gluconeogenesis. In islet
  β cells, Nur77 may enhance insulin sensitivity by activating the p‐insulin receptor
  β (IRβ)/p‐insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/Akt/GLUT4 pathway and regulating autophagy.
  Overexpression of Nur77 induces β cell proliferation and enhances mitochondrial
  respiration, which promotes insulin secretion; it also increases the expression
  of the glycolytic gene Eno3. In the immune system, Nur77 participates in the activation
  of glycolytic and TCA cycle enzymes, thereby driving cellular energy production
  and activating the Akt/mTOR axis, which leads to a decrease in Treg differentiation.
  Transcriptional activation of glycolysis preferentially promotes Th17 differentiation
  rather than Treg via a hypoxia‐inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)‐dependent mechanism.
  In tumor cells, Nur77 binds to response elements on the promoter of the WAP four‐disulfide
  core domain 21 pseudogene (WFDC21P) to induce its transcription. WFDC21P inhibits
  liver cancer cell glycolysis through simultaneous interaction with phosphofructokinase
  (PFK) and the pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), a key glycolytic enzyme. Moreover,
  Nur77 interacts with PEPCK1 to promote gluconeogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma
  by reducing the SUMOylation and ubiquitination of PEPCK1, thereby effectively inhibiting
  glycolysis in hepatocellular carcinoma
