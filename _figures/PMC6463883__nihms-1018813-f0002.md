caption: 'Top: The pat pathway to patellamides, with an expansion showing the amino
  acid sequence of PatE1, the substrate for biosynthetic enzymes. The precursor peptide
  substrate may be demarcated as described in the Text Box. The order of the modification
  occurs such that heterocyclization occurs first, followed by proteolysis and macrocyclization.
  Late stage tailoring may further elaborate the modified peptides.'
