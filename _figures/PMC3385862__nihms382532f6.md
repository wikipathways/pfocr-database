caption: Illustration demonstrating key metabolites and the metabolic pathways that
  are altered after exposure of U-87 MG gliomas to ACCA. The key metabolites examined
  by MRS are outlined (green background). The primary glycolytic metabolic pathway
  (A ▶ B) is inhibited on exposure of cells to ACCA (red background), which blocks
  lactate efflux. The metabolism can then shift to the pentose-phosphate pathway (D)
  and towards mitochondrial respiration (C). Concomitant biosynthetic pathways for
  amino acids can be up-regulated (E–G) at least during the initial period of exposure
  to ACCA and before cells undergo metabolic crisis because of long-term exposure
  to ACCA. Key reducing cofactors (NADPH and NADH) are indicated (yellow background).
