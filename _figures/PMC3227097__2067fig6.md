caption: Network of core pathways that mediate commitment of cells to the division
  cycle. In the pathway model, the nodes in red are proteins that are present in the
  G1 and/or G1S modules. Nodes present in green are derived from the literature (they
  include intermediates or effectors of cellular processes captured by our merged
  modules). The gray arrows depict interactions taken from the merged G1 and G1S modules.
  The blue arrows are links added from the literature. The dotted orange boxes highlight
  cellular signaling pathways, and the dotted gray boxes group molecules involved
  in regulating similar cellular processes. The dashed blue arrows indicate a known
  role of the source node in regulating the target node, derived from the literature.
  AKT and PTK2B are G1-specific high-stress and betweenness nodes. SRC and GRB2 show
  high stress and betweenness in both modules. ABL and JUN are present as high-stress
  betweenness nodes only in the G1S modules. A detailed description of the pathways
  captured is given in the Supplemental Material.
