caption: The effects of MSC-derived immunomodulatory and growth factors on survival,
  migration, phenotype and function of immune cells and parenchymal cells in inflamed
  and injured lacrimal and salivary glands. MSC-derived HGF, TGF-β, IGF and bGFGF
  bind to their receptors on injured cells of the ocular surface, salivary and lacrimal
  glands, activate PI3K kinase which produces PIP3 that induces activation of Akt
  kinase. Akt then phosphorylates and inhibits pro-apoptotic factors Bad, FOXO, and
  ASK1, thereby preventing apoptosis of injured cells in the corneas, salivary and
  lacrimal glands. When MSC-derived IL-1Ra binds to IL-1R on endothelial cells of
  lacrimal and salivary glands, it blocks the interaction of IL-1β with IL-1R. Similarly,
  MSC-sourced sTNFR prevents TNF-α from binding to its receptor on endothelial cells.
  In this way, MSC-derived IL-1Ra and sTNFR reduce influx of circulating leucocytes
  in inflamed lacrimal and salivary glands of pSS patients. MSC-derived TGF-β prevents
  proliferation and expansion of inflammatory, IFN-γ-producing Th1 and IL-17-producing
  Th17 cells by inhibiting Jak-Stat signaling pathway, causing cell cycle arrest in
  these inflammatory cells. MSC-derived IL-10 promotes the development of tolerogenic
  DCs which support differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into immunosuppressive FoxP3+
  Tregs. MSC-sourced IDO prevents transdifferentiation of Tregs in Th17 cells and
  increases Tregs/Th17 cell ratio in inflamed and injured lacrimal and salivary glands,
  crucially contributing to the creation of immunosuppressive environment. MSC-sourced
  pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, angiopoietin, HGF, bFGF, PDGF) promote survival and
  proliferation of endothelial cells, increase blood flow and provide nutrients for
  enhanced regeneration of injured cells in the corneas, salivary and lacrimal glands
