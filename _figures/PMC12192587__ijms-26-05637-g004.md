caption: 'Pathway Analysis of Muscle Fiber Phenotype Shifts in Response to ECM Coatings.
  (a) Transition from oxidative to glycolytic muscle fiber phenotype in quadriceps
  muscles in patients with COPD. This complex pathway illustrates the molecular mechanisms
  underlying the transition from oxidative to glycolytic muscle fibers in patients
  with COPD. The capsule-shaped markers in the image represent gene expression levels,
  with red indicating upregulation and blue indicating downregulation. DEGs are grouped
  as follows: (1, 2) DEGs from Collagen I versus fibronectin and Geltrex™; (3, 4)
  DEGs from fibronectin and Geltrex™ versus Collagen I. (b) Selected region of the
  calcium signaling pathway from IPA analysis of DEGs (Collagen I vs. fibronectin).
  A focused view of the calcium signaling pathway derived from IPA analysis of the
  DEGs between Collagen I and fibronectin coatings, demonstrating how calcium ion
  (Ca2+) influx influences slow muscle fiber type development. Upregulated genes,
  highlighted in bright colors, include calmodulin, CaMK, Mef2, and Nfat, which promote
  slow muscle fiber development. Downregulated genes are indicated in blue. The arrows
  of varying colors, thicknesses, and line styles in the figure are explained in the
  MetaCore and IPA legends placed beside them'
