caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was utilized to generate functional network
  maps for the top altered genes following knockdown of SIN3A (A) and SIN3B (B). Red
  indicates genes that are up-regulated, green indicates genes that are down-regulated,
  and white indicates genes that are incorporated into the network through relationships
  with other genes. The intensity of color indicates the degree of up- or down-regulation.
  Shapes indicate the type of molecule: horizontal ovals are transcription regulators,
  vertical ovals are transmembrane receptors, diamonds are enzymes, triangles are
  phosphatases, double circles are part of complexes or groups, dotted squares are
  growth factors, and circles are listed as other.'
