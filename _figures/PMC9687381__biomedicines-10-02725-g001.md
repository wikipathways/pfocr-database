caption: Androgen receptors can modulate the splicing of XBP1s via the ERN1 pathway,
  which in response activates UPR signaling. We propose that Fin treatment in the
  paternal generation can also change the AR receptor balance in mature filial generation.
  (Upper panel) Effects of Fin in the paternal generation. (Lower panel) Effects of
  treatment of the paternal generation with Fin in mature filial generation. AR—androgen
  receptor; Fin—finasteride; XBP1s—X-box binding protein 1 (spliced), XBP1u—X-box
  binding protein 1 (unspliced), ERN1—endoplasmic reticulum-to-nucleus signaling 1,
  UPR—unfolded protein response.
