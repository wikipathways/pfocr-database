caption: Illustration of MEHHs’ phenolic acids mitigating the inflammatory response
  by modulating various pathways. The arrow (→) indicates enhancement, while the barred
  line (┤) signifies inhibition. Disruptions in glycolipid metabolism can result in
  the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and free fatty acids,
  which may bind directly to cellular receptors and activate inflammatory signaling
  cascades. In conditions of insulin resistance, insulin signaling is compromised;
  however, insulin levels remain elevated, promoting hyperinsulinemia, which can further
  stimulate the production and release of inflammatory mediators. MEHHs’ phenolic
  acids counteract inflammatory responses and improve glucose and lipid metabolism
  disorders by inhibiting signaling pathways such as TLRs, NF-κB, NLRP3, and MAPK
