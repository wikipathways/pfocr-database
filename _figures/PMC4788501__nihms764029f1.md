caption: Cellular components shown include mitochondria, plasma membrane, ER and vacuole.
  On the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM), the five respiratory chain components
  are shown and labeled sequentially as I – V. Their basic functions in Oxphos are
  also illustrated. Additionally, the alternative oxidase (AOX) is shown, which bypasses
  the bc1 by sending electrons from ubiquinol directly to oxygen. Inhibitors of cyt
  bc1 are shown as filled hexagons, whose uptake may require assistance of uptake
  transporters. Resistance to bc1 inhibitors can arise if the cellular accumulation
  of the inhibitors is reduced, which includes blockage of uptake pathway, active
  transport by efflux ABC transporters, getting pumped into vacuoles, or chemically
  modified by cyt P450s. Additionally, mutations in bc1 can lead to resistance.
