caption: Pentose phosphate pathways. The oxidative branch (top) and catabolic non-oxidative
  branch (middle) can be shown as one pathway releasing one CO2 molecule per glucose
  6-phosphate consumed. At the bottom, the catabolic non-oxidative PPP, as found in
  the Calvin–Benson cycle, is shown. DHAP = dihydroxyacetone phosphate, E4P = erythrose
  4-phosphate, F6P = fructose 6-phosphate, G6P = glucose 6-phosphate, GAP = glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate, PRPP = 5-O-phosphono- ribose 1-diphosphate, R5P = ribose 5-phosphate,
  Ru5P = ribulose 5-phosphate, RuBP = ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, S7P = sedoheptulose
  7-phosphate, SBP = sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate, SBPase = sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase,
  and Xu5P = xylulose 5-phosphate.
