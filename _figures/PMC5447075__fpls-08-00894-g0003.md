caption: 'Seven proteins identified in the aging leaf lipid droplet (LD) core proteome
  participate to secondary metabolism pathways. Enzymes identified in leaf LDs are
  represented in black circles. Pathways are represented by gray rectangles. Black
  arrows indicate direct reactions, white arrows represent indirect reactions, and
  gray arrows depict involvement of one component in a pathway. (1): 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate
  7-phosphate synthase (DAHP; AT1G22410), (2): Strictosidine synthase (AT1G74010;
  AT1G74020), (3): Farnesylcysteine lyase (AT5G63910), (4): Methionine adenosyltransferase3
  (AT2G36880), (5): 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily
  protein (AT2G25450), (6): Nitrile specifier protein5 (AT5G48180), (7): Peroxidase
  superfamily protein (Peroxidase70; AT5G64110). DMAPP, Dimethylallyl diphosphate;

  indole alkaloid biosynthetic pathway; PP, Diphosphate.'
