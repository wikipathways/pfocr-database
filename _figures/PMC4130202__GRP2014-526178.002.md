caption: New molecules targeting angiogenesis and crosstalks between angiogenesis
  and tumor microenvironment. Simplified and schematic view of how multiple cells
  contribute to the VEGF and PlGF pool in the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment
  (TME) consists of soluble molecules, immune, nonimmune fibroblastic, vascular, and
  malignant cells that interact in a paracrine and autocrine fashion to promote cancer
  growth and metastasis. Hypoxia is the most potent stimulus for inducing the main
  angiogenic factors, VEGF and PlGF. Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) might
  confer resistance to therapies that target VEGF by secreting additional proangiogenic
  factors and specifically by expressing VEGFR-1 (also known as FLT1). PlGF signals
  directly through VEGFR-1 in various cell types, including endothelial cells, angiogenesis-competent
  myeloid progenitors, macrophages, and tumour cells and thereby promotes tumour growth
  and the formation of the premetastatic niche. A substantial fraction of tumours
  is resistant or escapes antiangiogenic inhibitors that target VEGF-A signalling
  (bevacizumab) through therapy-induced injury, metabolic changes, inflammation, and
  possibly expansion of MDSCs. Differently from other antiangiogenic drugs, aflibercept
  targeting PlGF should reduce the source of the compensatory upregulation of angiogenic
  factors by inhibiting immune cells recruitment and/or polarization and the release
  of angiogenic factors by tumour and vascular cells. Regorafenib is a multikinase
  inhibitor against selected tyrosine kinases and signal transduction VEGFR2-3/RAF/MEK/ERK
  pathway.
