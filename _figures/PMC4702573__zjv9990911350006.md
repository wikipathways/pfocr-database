caption: Simplified model for CCC DNA synthesis and innate immune induction by HBV
  in AML12HBV10 cells. HBV NCs are destabilized in AML12HBV10 cells for reasons yet
  to be clarified. This leads to enhanced uncoating and delivery of RC DNA to the
  nucleus for CCC DNA synthesis. On the other hand, NC destabilization also leads
  to the exposure of RC DNA in the cytoplasm, which can be recognized by the cytosolic
  DNA sensor cGAS, leading to the activation of the STING-TBK1 pathway and IRF3 nuclear
  translocation. Innate antiviral factors (or proviral factors, at the early points
  of the time course, when viral levels are low) are then induced to modulate HBV
  gene expression (at the RNA and core protein levels). The inhibitors and manipulations
  used to dissect the antiviral response pathway are indicated where they are thought
  to act. Other factors/pathways are also likely involved but are not depicted for
  simplicity. See the text for details.
