caption: Top-scoring networks derived from the 325 genes differentially expressed
  in ageing. (A) Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) identified from cellular function
  and maintenance as the principal associated network functions with scores of 43.
  (B) The second top-scoring network was a cellular growth and proliferation, with
  scores of 32. (C) IPA identified cell cycle and skeletal and muscular system development
  function with a score of 32. (D) The fourth top-scoring network was cellular development,
  with a score of 28. Figures are graphical representations between molecules identified
  in our data in their respective networks. Green nodes indicate upregulated gene
  expression in older tendon; red nodes indicate downregulated gene expression in
  older tendon. Intensity of colour is related to higher fold change. The key to the
  main features in the networks is shown.
