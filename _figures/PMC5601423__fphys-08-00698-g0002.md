caption: The mechanisms of Ang II-induced AT1R-dependent regulation on BK channels.
  AT1R interacts with Gα after binding with Ang II, which leads to the activation
  of the PKC and enhances NOX-1 complex activity. In turn, the released Gβγ activates
  the c-Src/c-Abl-dependent signaling pathway, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation
  of Cav-1. ROS enhances c-Src/protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity, which results
  in an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. PKC also inhibits the anterograde
  trafficking of BK channels by influencing the function of Rab-GTPases. In addition,
  AT1R and BK channels closely co-localize at the cell membrane and have a close protein-protein
  interaction.
