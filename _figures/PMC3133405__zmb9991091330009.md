caption: Model of Spn1 regulation of the Toll-mediated innate immune response. Three
  separate side branches of the Toll signaling pathway are activated either by microbial
  cell wall PRRs (GNBP3, for fungi and yeasts; GNBP1, PGRP-SA, and PGRP-SD for Gram-positive
  bacteria) or danger-signaling (virulence factors). These three side branches of
  the pathway converge on SPE, which activates Spz (the ligand of Toll). The intracellular
  Toll pathway signals trough Dif to activate the expression of Drs and other antimicrobial
  peptides in the fat body. The GNBP3 and danger-signaling branches of the Toll signaling
  pathway are regulated independently by Spn1 and nec. Both of these serpins represent
  nonredundant genetic functions, and the lack activates Drs expression.
