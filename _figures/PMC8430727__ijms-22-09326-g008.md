caption: Common proposed ROS signaling pathways during plants’ response to salt stress.
  Under salt stress, ROS production induces mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP)
  cascades which mediate different adaptive responses. MAPs, nitric oxide (NO), Ca2+
  and other signaling molecules have been suggested to be connected in activating
  antioxidant defense, stomatal movement, membrane properties and ionic homeostasis.
  The salt overly sensitive signaling (SOS) pathway interacting with other pathways
  functions in maintaining ionic homeostasis. The ROS-induced ABA production and ROS-induced
  activation of MAPs and Ca2+ signal regulate stomatal opening and closing. ROS signal
  sensors/receptors can induce activation of biosynthesis/functioning of different
  hormones and signaling molecules such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA),
  gibberellic acid (GA), ethylene (ETH), auxin, brassinosteroid (BR), H2O2 and NO.
  These hormones/signaling molecules can interact with ROS, single or multiple hormones
  or signaling molecules; can interact with various signal cascades/pathways; and
  can regulate stress-responsive gene expression which modulates various metabolic
  and physiological functions, contributing to plant adaptation to salt stress. Dashed
  lines indicate the mechanisms which are not yet identified.
