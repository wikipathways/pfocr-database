  arrows indicate enzymes indirectly upregulated by expression of upc2-1. Green arrows
  indicate enzymes that were directly upregulated. The red repression arrow indicates
  that ERG9 was placed under the control of a methionine-repressed promoter, reducing
  flux to squalene synthesis. Green boxes indicate the exogenous enzymes ADS and CYP71AV1
  and the redox partner protein CPR (). CoA, coenzyme A; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA;
  IPP, isopentenylpyrophosphate; GPP, geranyl pyrophosphate.
