caption: Schematic representation of MIR4435-2HG functions in CRC. Increased level
  of MIR4435-2HG blocks miR-206 which leads to elevation of YAP1 and enhanced cell
  invasion, migration, proliferation and chemoresistance. In HCT116R cells, the activation
  of Nrf2 pathway leads to drug resistance; however, knockdown of MIR4435-2HG sensetives
  cancer cell to chemotherapy through inhibition of Nrf2. Furthermore, MIR4435-2HG
  can increase CRC progression via promoted GLUT-1
