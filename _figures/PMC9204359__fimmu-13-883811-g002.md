caption: Inflammatory Pathway in HIDS. Mevalonate kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation
  of mevalonic acid a key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway I, involved in cholesterol
  metabolism. Treg cell function is dependent on mevalonate pathway-orchestrated lipid
  oxidation. Defective cholesterol metabolism has also been shown to induce human
  B cell regulatory program by metabolic priming. As such, B cells of patients who
  are deficient in MVK are functionally impaired and have a reduced capacity to produce
  IL-10 upon stimulation. Impaired production of IL-10 results in the unabated induction
  of CD4 T cells by Th1. IL-10 also suppresses inflammation through paracrine and
  autocrine mechanisms, controlling the differentiation of B-cells into IgM or IgG
  secreting plasmablasts. Unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIDS
  patients produce increased amounts of pro-inflammatory mediators including cytokines,
  such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α.
