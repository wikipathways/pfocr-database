caption: Metabolic map of the phenolic and benzoxazinoid pathways in maize. Solid
  arrows represent enzymatic conversions for which experimental evidence is available,
  and dashed arrows represent suggested conversions. Two successive arrows represent
  two or more metabolic conversions. Metabolic shifts in C2-Idf mutants compared with
  C2 control plants (–) are indicated in color, where red represents a significant
  increase and blue represents a significant decrease in abundance. Only those metabolic
  sinks that have been measured in the C2-Idf mutants are shown. Reduced biosynthesis
  of anthocyanins in C2-Idf mutants has been reported by . The position of the CHS
  (C2) enzyme is emphasized in a blue boldface font. CAD, Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase;
  CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; CGT, C-glycosyltransferase;

  4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CSE, caffeoyl
  shikimate esterase; F2H, flavanone 2-hydroxylase; F3H, naringenin 3-dioxygenase;

  lyase; UGT, UDP-glucosyltransferase. The relation between TAL and PAL activity has
  been reported by  for maize and by  for brachypodium. Enzymes involved in the general
  phenylpropanoid (PAL, TAL, C4H, 4CL, HCT, C3H, and CCoAOMT) and monolignol-specific
  (CCR, F5H, COMT, and CAD) pathways are described by . Homologs for the Arabidopsis
  HCALDH () are present in maize (; ). PMT has been shown in rice (), brachypodium
  (), and maize (). The flavone biosynthesis pathway is shown according to , , and
  , . The enzymes involved in the metabolic route via F2H toward apigenin and luteolin
  conjugates has been described in rice, wheat, and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum;
  ; ). The biosynthetic routes via HCT and HQT have been described in switchgrass
  () and suggested to be present in maize (). In addition, HCT of sorghum (Sorghum
  bicolor) has been studied via in vitro activity assays (). The FOMT involved in
  the conversion of luteolin and selgin into chrysoeriol and tricin, respectively,
  in maize is described by  and is identical to the COMT involved in the conversion
  of 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde to sinapaldehyde described by , , and . Question marks
  indicate biosynthetic steps that are questionable; the reaction from p-coumaric
  acid toward caffeic acid via a C3H/C4H complex has so far only been shown by in
  vitro tests using poplar enzymes (). The activity of CSE has been described in switchgrass
  (; ), but the absence of close homologs with the reported Arabidopsis CSE (; ) makes
  it questionable whether this reaction is present in maize. For nomenclature of the
  oligolignols, see Supplemental Table S2.
