caption: Proposed Model of Starch Degradation Mechanism and Regulation during Osmotic
  Stress.In response to stress, ABA triggers BAM1 and AMY3 transcription through the
  ABA-dependent AREB/ABF-SnRK2 signaling pathway. This leads to rapid de novo BAM1
  protein synthesis and increased amylolytic activity, although posttranslational
  modifications are also likely to contribute. A fraction of the maltose released
  from starch by the synergistic action of BAM1 and AMY3 is exported to the cytosol
  and metabolized into sucrose and free hexoses. Sucrose is then exported to the root
  to support osmotic adjustment, water and nutrient uptake, and root growth. The remaining
  sugars, including some maltose and the additional sugars originating from carbon
  assimilation, are retained in the leaves for osmotic adjustment, energy supply,
  and to protect the photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative stress.
