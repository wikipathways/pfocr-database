caption: Our model proposes that cognitive resilience is driven by the maintenance
  of the excitatory/inhibitory neuronal balance (dark green), sustained by resilient
  excitatory neurons expressing MEF2C and ATP8B1. These neurons engage in resilience-relevant
  signaling pathways, including neurotrophin (BDNF/NTRK2), modulated by the down-regulation
  of LINGO1, and angiopoietin (ANGPT2/TEK). Protein folding and degradation processes
  are reorganized in resilience, with increased expression of Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp110
  in excitatory neurons and down-regulation of Hsp90, enhancing the degradation of
  pathological tau (mint green). SST+ inhibitory neurons, typically vulnerable in
  AD, are preserved in resilience, including subpopulations expressing RBFOX1 and
  KIF26B (blue), contributing to the balance of neuronal excitation. Additionally,
  SST release from these neurons promotes the degradation and clearance of pathological
  Aβ.In terms of glial response, resilience shows astrogliosis marked by increased
  GFAP in astrocytes (red), a feature shared with AD. However, it contrasts with AD
  by exhibiting a reduction or absence of microglial activation, characterized by
  decreased KLF4 expression, leading to reduced neuroinflammation (pink).Figure created
