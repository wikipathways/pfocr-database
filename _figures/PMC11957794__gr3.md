caption: Schematic diagram of different types of COL remodeling-mediated signaling
  pathways.A, (i) a high degree of wavy COL-III fibers maintains tumor dormancy via
  DDR1-mediated STAT1 signaling, while linear COL-III plays a reversed effect (50,
  51). (ii) the extracellular domain (ECD) of DDR1 which can be cleaved off by sheddase
  promotes COL fiber alignment to instigate immune exclusion possibly via LAIR1-induced
  CD8+ T cell exhaustion (52, 53, 54, 55). B, (i) the cleaved COL-I promotes mitochondria
  biogenesis and macropinocytosis via the DDR1-NF-κB-p62-NRF2 signaling pathway, leading
  to a poor patient outcome. In contrast, the intact COL-I has the opposite effect
  on mitochondria biogenesis, macropinocytosis, and patient outcome via inhibiting
  DDR1 and its downstream effectors (58). (ii) cleaved COL-I may induce CXCL5 production
  to promote tumor microenvironment (TME) inflammation via DDR1-PKCθ-SYK-NF-κB signaling
  (60). C, COL-I homotrimers, resulting from epigenetic suppression of the Col1a2
  gene, significantly promote pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor growth
  (63). These homotrimers bind to α3β1 integrin on cancer cells, activating oncogenic
  signaling pathways, including FAK-PI3K-AKT and FAK-MAPK-ERK. COL-I homotrimers are
  associated with a microbiota enriched in anaerobic Bacteroidales in immunosuppressed
  tumors
