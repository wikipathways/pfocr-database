caption: Synthesis steps are indicated by the gene (SPRG_xxxxx) predicted to encode
  the responsible enzyme. An asterisk (*) highlights those sterols which were previously
  extracted from Saprolegniales species. All sterols highlighted in grey boxes were
  identified in S. parasitica mycelium during this study. Zymosterol is shown larger
  than other sterols to highlight its role as a branching point between multiple synthetic
  routes.
