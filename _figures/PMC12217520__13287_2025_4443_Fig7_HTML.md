caption: Mechanisms whereby IL-1Ra overexpression in MSCs significantly improved the
  prognosis of HC through the HtrA3 signaling pathway. oeIL-1Ra overexpression in
  MSCs increased the ability of MSCs to migrate to damaged tissues, and secreted IL-1Ra
  inhibited inflammation in HC. In addition, oeIL-1Ra-MSCs inhibited the JNK–c-JUN
  pathway to promote HtrA3 expression and activated the ERK–Egr-1 pathway to initiate
  the transcription and high expression of HtrA3, which promoted angiogenesis and
  MSC migration
