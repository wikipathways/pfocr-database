caption: Potential mechanisms by which dysfunction of ubiquitin-mediated endosome-to-lysosome
  trafficking in spongiform disorders results in abnormal intracellular signaling,
  attenuation of lysosomal protein degradation, and impairment of autophagy. Exogenous
  PrPSc and ligand-bound receptors enter the cell via the endocytic pathway. Receptor
  signaling is modulated by lysosomal degradation, which is dependent upon correct
  ESCRT-mediated sorting of the receptors. PrPC trafficking is disrupted by PrPSc,
  which can mediate the conversion of endogenous PrPC into PrPSc in the MVB or other
  endocytic compartment and accumulates in the MVB/late endosome. Infection of a cell
  with retroviruses results in the production of viral gag proteins, which hijack
  the ESCRT sorting machinery to aid in viral budding at the MVB or at the plasma
  membrane (not shown). Viruses and PrP in the MVB can be released from the cell via
  the exosome pathway. Loss of Mgrn1-mediated ubiquitination and viral gag proteins
  disrupt normal ESCRT sorting of cell surface receptors, which interferes with receptor
  degradation by the lysosome, potentiating receptor intracellular signaling. Dysfunction
  of both the ESCRT sorting machinery and the lysosome impair degradation of cellular
  proteins by autophagy.
