caption: Schematic diagram of cognitive function impaired by abnormal lactate metabolism
  in Pdha1–/– mice. Due to decreased PDC activity, lactate abnormally increases, and
  excessive lactate transport through MCTs leads to tissue microenvironment acidification.
  Increased lactate also inhibits the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway by activating
  HCAR1, resulting in the decline of cognitive function in mice.
