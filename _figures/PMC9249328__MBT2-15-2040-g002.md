caption: Model of how VdASP F2 regulates the formation of melanized microsclerotia
  in Verticillium dahliae. Under adverse environmental conditions, cell wall protein
  VdASP F2 transmits external signals into cells, through interacting with membrane
  protein VdTRP, to activate melanin and microsclerotia biosynthesis pathway. The
  DHN melanogenesis pathway was drawn based on previous reports. The simplified MAPK
  signalling pathways was drawn according to the reports. The solid black arrows represent
  confirmed results, while dashed black arrows represent inference steps.
