caption: Schematic mechanism of EE treatment regulates post-ischemic pyroptosis. The
  NF-κB signaling pathway is activated following I/R injury, which stimulates the
  nucleus to induce transcription of NLRP1 and NLRP3 proteins to form the NLRP1 and
  NLRP3 inflammasome. Pro-caspase-1 is activated through NLRP1 and NLRP3 signal cleaving
  GSDMD into GSDMD-N and GSDMD-C. Then the pore-forming GSDMD-N domain causes membrane
  lysis inducing pyroptosis. Also, cleaved caspase-1 mediates the maturation of IL-1β
  and IL-18 which are released into the extracellular environment. EE attenuates pyroptosis
  resulting in ischemic stroke outcomes amelioration.
