caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed mechanism of TGF-β signaling and functions
  in high versus low MUC1 PDA. Left panel shows activation of SMAD-dependent canonical
  pathway in low-MUC1 PDA cells. TGF-β ligands bind to the membranous TGF-β receptor
  (TGF-βRII) homodimers with high affinity. TGF-βRII binding allows dimerization with
  TGF-β type I receptor (TGF-βRI) homodimers, activation of the TGF-βRI kinase domain
  and signal transduction via phosphorylation of the C-terminus of receptor-regulated
  SMADs (R-SMAD), SMAD2 and SMAD3. The SMAD2/3 dimer then forms a heterotrimeric complex
  with SMAD4 which translocates in the nucleus (; ). This leads to growth inhibition,
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of PDA cells, thus TGF-β acts as a tumor suppressor.
  Right panel shows activation of SMAD-independent non-canonical pathway in high-MUC1
  PDA cells. In this pathway, binding of TGF-β mainly to TGF-β-RII most likely increases
  phosphorylation of c-SRC which in turn phosphorylates MAPK, followed by JNK and
  c-Myc (). This phosphorylation cascade activates the MAPK/JNK pathway and stabilizes
  c-Myc which translocates into the nucleus to increase transcription of oncogenic
  proteins and leads to increased growth, invasion and EMT of PDA cells (). MUC1-CT
  also aids in the process by its oncogenic signaling. Thus, in high-MUC1 PDA cells
  TGF-β acts as a pro-tumorigenic cytokine. The schematic was created with BioRender.com.
