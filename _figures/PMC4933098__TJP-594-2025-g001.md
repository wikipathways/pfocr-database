caption: Pyruvate, generated from glucose by glycolysis in cytosol, undergoes oxidative
  decarboxylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to yield acetyl‐CoA. Ketone body
  metabolism is regulated by succinyl‐CoA transferase (SCOT) to yield acetyl‐CoA.
  Acetyl‐CoA generated by these pathways enters the TCA cycle to produce primarily
  NADH, which provides electrons to the electron transport chain to build up the proton
  motive force for ATP synthesis by complex V. Binding of insulin and IGF1 to their
  receptors activates the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and the downstream phosphatidylinositide
  3‐kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, which (1) facilitate the translocation
  of glucose transporters (GLUT3/4 in brain) to plasma membrane, (2) promote glycolytic
  reactions, and (3) enhance mitochondrial function through the translocation of Akt
  to mitochondria and the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase‐3β (GSK3β, an inhibitor
  of PDH). O2.− generated by the electron transport chain at complex I and III is
  reduced to H2O2, which is released to the cytosol where it modulates the redox‐sensitive
  insulin/IGF1 signalling (IIS) and c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) signalling. JNK
  can negatively regulate IIS by phosphorylating IRS at Ser307/312.
