caption: miRNAs were validated to modulate the metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA).
  In airway epithelial cells, RSVs are recognized by PAMPs such as TLRs, which subsequently
  activate signal pathways like NF-κB and affect the expression profile of miRNAs.
  MiRNAs regulate leukotriene synthesis by modulating AA metabolism, which mainly
  includes the LOX pathway and COX pathway. Thereinto, miR-219-2 can inhibit several
  enzymes such as cPLA2, 5-LOX, and LTA4H. Some miRNAs have been confirmed to inhibit
  the expression of 5-LOX, such as let-7, miR-19a, and miR-125. In addition, miR-146a,
  miR-135a, and miR-199 can regulate 5-LOX enzyme activity by downregulating FLAP;
  let-7 and miR-21 by downregulating p38 MAPK. Interference with these miRNAs may
  contribute to the consistently overexpressed leukotrienes. MiRNAs such as miR-16,
  miR-26, miR-30a, miR-143, and miR-146a may lead to the conversion of more AA to
  leukotriene by inhibiting the COX pathway. Besides, overexpression of miRNAs like
  miR-101 and miR-106a can suppress 12-LOX/15-LOX, which could disrupt the balance
  between pro-inflammatory and inflammation-resolving mediators. Among these miRNAs,
  let-7, miR-16-5p, miR-19a, miR-21, miR-26b, miR-30a-5p, miR-125a, miR-143, and miR-146a
  have been found abnormal expression in RSV infection.
