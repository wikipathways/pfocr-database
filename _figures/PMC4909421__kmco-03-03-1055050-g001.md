caption: Molecular mechanisms whereby RAS promotes cell senescence. In normal cells,
  RAS promotes the acetylation of p53 via NORE1A and HIPK2, which specifically activates
  p53 senescence activity (left panel) and serves as a protective mechanism to prevent
  unrestricted RAS-mediated proliferation. In the absence of NORE1A (right panel),
  the interaction of HIPK2 with p53 and concomitant p53 senescence-associated acetylation
  is reduced, resulting in bypass of this senescence signaling pathway and allowing
  RAS-mediated proliferative signals to predominate. Ac, acetylated lysine; P, phosphorylation.
