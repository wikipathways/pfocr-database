caption: (A) Dynamics of the motility machineries and their associated regulators
  during the reversal cycle. MglA (Red circle) is recruited by RomR (Blue circle)
  to the leading cell pole where it activates A- motility (Agl/Glt, T-shapes) and
  S-motility (Type-IV pili) at least partially through AglZ and FrzS, respectively
  (Crimson and Brown circles). At the lagging cell pole, MglB (green circle) co-localizes
  with RomR and FrzS where it prevents MglA accumulation by activating GTP hydrolysis
  by MglA. Frz signaling provokes the concerted polarity switching of MglA and MglB
  to opposite poles, allowing A- and S-motility activation at the new leading and
  movement in the opposite direction. (B) Genetic control of the reversal cycle. Schematic
  of the regulation cascade compiled from previous works. Frz signaling is thought
  to promote a phosphorylation cascade that activates reversals. In more details,
  activation of the FrzCD receptor by unknown signals activates the auto-phosphorylation
  of the FrzE kinase through the FrzA CheW-like protein. The exact function of FrzB,
  another CheW-like protein, is unknown, contrarily to FrzA it is not absolutely essential
  for the activation of FrzE. FrzE then transfers a phosphoryl group to up to three
  response regulator proteins, its cognate receiver domain (FrzERR), the FrzZ protein,
  a fusion of two RR domains, and the N-terminal RomR receiver domain. The outcome
  of these phosphorylation events is unknown but the phosphorylated output(s) is thought
  to interact directly with the polarity proteins and provoke their re-localization
  to opposite poles. Plain arrows indicate established interactions and dotted arrows
  indicate suspected interactions. The protein color code applies throughout the manuscript.
