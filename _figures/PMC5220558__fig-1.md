caption: Progression of traumatic brain injury. Schematic representation of changes
  in glutamate release, reuptake, and activity based on data from rodent models of
  traumatic brain injury. In normal brain (pre-injury), there is dense perisynaptic
  localization of glutamate transporters, which shapes synaptic transmission and neuroplasticity
  via the buffering and removal of glutamate from the synaptic cleft. During primary
  injury, several mechanisms may lead to diminished glutamate uptake, including changes
  in transporter expression, signaling pathway activation, and/or proteolytic degradation
  of transporter protein. We posit that transporter expression and localization is
  altered during secondary and chronic injury in a manner that serves to protect surviving
  neurons from additional injury. Finally, consolidation of neuroplastic changes during
  chronic injury may include alterations in glutamate release and reuptake, contributing
  to the cognitive defects found in chronic traumatic brain injury. MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; K+, potassium; Na+, sodium; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PKA, protein
  kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PI3K-Akt, phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase
  B; PSD95, post-synaptic density 95; TGFb, transforming growth factor beta; Ca2+,
  calcium; EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor;
