caption: Roles of ion channels in cell death regulation. In the ER Reduction of calcium
  by blockage of SERCA or increased activity of the receptors RyR and IP3R can lead
  to loss of chaperone function triggering the unfolded protein response pathway,
  caspase activation, and ultimately cell death (A). In the mitochondria, increased
  levels of calcium lead to activation of the permeability transition pore (PTP) which
  can cause leakage of cytochrome C and ultimately cause cell death (B). Chloride
  and sodium both regulate cell death by regulating cell volume. Extreme imbalance
  of chloride or sodium levels leads to cell shrinkage or volume increase and rupture,
  and both cause cell death (C).
