caption: A model for EPS-8 function during vulval fate specification. The inductive
  AC signal upregulates EPS-8 expression in the 1° VPC (P6.p), where EPS-8 associates
  with LIN-2 to retain LET-23 EGFR on the basolateral plasma membrane. In the adjacent
  2° VPCs (P5.p and P7.p) EPS-8 levels are low due to the lateral inhibition of the
  EGFR/RAS/MAPK signaling pathway by LIN-12 NOTCH, and LET-23 is therefore rapidly
  internalized and degraded in the 2° lineage.
