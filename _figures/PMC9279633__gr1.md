caption: Autophagy process and dysfunction in AD. The autophagy process starts with
  the formation of an isolated membrane to sequester the protein aggregates and intracellular
  organelles to form a double membrane structure called phagophore. During elongation,
  phagophore expands to form autophagosome. Upon the autophagosome formation, it directly
  fuses with lysosome and endosome to generate autolysosome and endolysosome, respectively,
  to digest and recycle cargo. Pathogenic proteins including Aβ aggregates and hyperphosphorylated
  tau, as well as damaged organelles including mitochondria can be efficiently cleared
  by autophagy to maintain neuronal homeostasis. The autophagy proteins highlighted
  with red rectangular lines are those downregulated in AD models. The proteins with
  red color are AD-associated proteins impairing autophagy–lysosome/later endosome
  pathway in different steps.
