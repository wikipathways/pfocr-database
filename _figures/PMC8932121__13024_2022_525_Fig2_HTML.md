caption: 'Major inflammatory pathways. A The JAK-STAT pathway regulates the cellular
  response to cytokines and growth factors and signals through dimerization of receptors
  upon binding of these molecules. Upon dimerization, a series of autophosphorylation
  and transphosphorylation events of the receptors and their associated JAK proteins
  results in an active STAT dimer that functions as transcription activator. B The
  MAPK and NF-κB pathway is characterized by a multi-step signaling cascade upon receptor
  activation eventually resulting in MAPK activation. In this cascade, generally a
  MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) phosphorylates and activates a MAPK kinase (MAP2K) which
  in turn activates the MAPK. Meanwhile, the MAP3K can also induce NF-κB signaling.
  Together with the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) activated by phosphorylation
  of the MAPK, NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and functions as a transcription
  factor. C The NLRP3 inflammasome pathway can be initiated by a plethora of different
  mechanisms that result in activation of the NF-κB pathway. The presence of additional
  cellular insults will result in the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome which is
  able to activate caspase 1. The activated caspase 1 dimer is subsequently able to
  process gasdermin D, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms causing the
  formation of a gasdermin D pore resulting in pyroptosis and the release of inflammatory
  cytokines. AP-1: activator protein 1; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; ASC: apoptosis
