caption: The photorespiration metabolic pathway in A. thaliana. Metabolic phenotypes
  of A. thaliana mutants affected in various steps of the photorespiration metabolic
  pathway (highlighted in bold) were used to test the performance of the PhenoMeter.
  By correctly matching query phenotypes to their most functionally closely related
  counterparts (e.g., matching the phenotypes of mutants affected in the same gene
  rather than different genes), phenotypic pattern matching tools like the PhenoMeter
  should ideally discriminate between phenotypes of functionally closely related perturbations
  such as disruption at different steps of a metabolic pathway like photorespiration.
  Steps performed by unknown gene products are indicated with a “?.”
