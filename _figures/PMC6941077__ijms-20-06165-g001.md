caption: A schematic diagram depicting the involvement of phytochromes in different
  stages of photomorphogenesis. The red dots represent phytochromes that are present
  ubiquitously in plants. Inactive phytochrome (red light-absorbing Pr form) can be
  converted to active phytochrome (far-red light-absorbing Pfr form) by absorbing
  red light. The Pfr form can be converted back to the Pr form upon absorbing far-red
  light or in the dark (known as dark reversion, or more recently, thermal reversion).
  The active Pfr form regulates various photomorphogenic development through other
  downstream components of the phytochrome- mediated light signaling pathway.
