caption: 'The intensity of information flow through the mTORC1-signaling pathway defines
  the fate of quiescent adult stem cells. A low intensity of mTORC1 signaling in adult
  stem cells decreases the extent of mitochondrial ROS production and release, thereby
  preventing the exit of these cells from the quiescent state and their excessive
  proliferation. An activation of mTORC1 signaling in response to hepatocyte growth
  factor, a cell-extrinsic pro-mitogenic signal, commits quiescent adult stem cells
  to cell cycle entry, proliferation, and differentiation. Proteins, metabolites,
  and processes whose activities, concentrations, and rates must be increased to maintain
  the quiescence of adult stem cells are displayed in red. Proteins, metabolites,
  and processes whose activities, concentrations, and rates need to be increased to
  promote the exit of adult stem cells from the state of quiescence are displayed
  in green. The red arrow defines the chemical reaction whose rate must be increased
  to maintain the quiescence of adult stem cells. The red inhibitory bar defines the
  inhibitory effect whose intensity must be increased to maintain the quiescence of
  adult stem cells. The green arrows define chemical reactions or processes whose
  rates or intensities must be increased to promote the exit of adult stem cells from
  the state of quiescence. See the text for more details. Abbreviations: Akt1, RAC-alpha
