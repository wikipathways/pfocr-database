caption: mTORC1 inhibition is protective during ischemia through the upregulation
  of adaptive mechanisms. On the other hand, mTOR is reactivated during reperfusion
  and takes part in the regulation of physiological processes. The pharmacological
  modulators of mTOR and the animal models with genetic modifications of the components
  of the mTOR signaling pathway that have been used in the studies focused on the
  role of mTOR in ischemia-reperfusion are displayed.
