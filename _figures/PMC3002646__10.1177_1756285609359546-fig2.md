caption: 'Incorporation of exogenous metabolites into sialic acid biosynthesis. Left
  panel shows the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway initiated within the cytosol, which
  starts with a series of steps whereby glucose is sequentially converted to UDP-GlcNAc.
  The succeeding essential steps involve the bifunctional enzymes encoded by GNE:
  UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase which epimerizes UDP-GlcNac into ManNAc, and ManNAc kinase
  which catalyzes the phosphorylation of ManNAc into ManNAc-6-P. The next two steps
  in the pathway eventually convert ManNAc-6-P into NeuAc. Activation of free NeuAc
  into CMP-NeuAc occurs in the nucleus. CMP-NeuAc is later transported to the Golgi
  apparatus. Sialic acids are ultimately transferred to oligosaccharide chains of
  gangliosides or sialoglycoproteins become sialylated (sialic acid conjugates). Right
  panel depicts a situation whereby the activity of the bifunctional enzyme is reduced
  because of mutations in GNE, resulting into decreased sialic acid production (and
  sialylation) of gangliosides or sialoglycoproteins, and reduced functional status
  of skeletal muscles in DMRV/hIBM. Middle panel shows the steps whereby exogenous
  sialic acids are incorporated into the pathway, improving sialylation status of
  sialic acid conjugates, and contributing to the improvement of skeletal muscle function
  in DMRV/hIBM.'
