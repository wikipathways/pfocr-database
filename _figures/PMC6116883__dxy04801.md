caption: 'Development of the IgE+ B-cell repertoire. Top-left: the primary repertoire
  of early B cells in the bone marrow acquires combinatorial and junctional diversity
  (shown in the box) through V(D)J recombination (only IgH illustrated), random paring
  of IgH with IgL (λ or κ) chains and N/P nucleotide editing at the CDR-H3 junctions
  (corresponding to the purple circle). Bottom-left: following activation by allergen
  in the periphery, GC B cells in the dark zone undergo clonal expansion and SHM.
  In the light zone, GC B cells can undergo CSR to IgE in two pathways: (1: green
  arrow) direct switching from IgM+ precursors or (2: blue arrow) sequential switching
  via IgG+ or IgA+ intermediates; the second pathway may occur outside lymphoid tissues,
  such as the ectopic GC in mucosal tissues. Following antigen selection in the presence
  of TFH cells and fDCs in the GC light zone, B cells are selected to either cycle
  in the GC for further affinity maturation (the red dotted paths) or differentiate
  into memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells (plasmablasts→plasma cells); unselected
  B cells undergo apoptosis. Bottom-right: IgE antibodies secreted from plasma cells
  can sensitize mast cells or antigen-presenting cells (APCs), i.e. DCs via FcεI and
  B cells via FcεII or CD23 (not shown). Cross-linking of IgE via FcεRI on mast cells
  induces degranulation of mast cells and release of histamine, proteases and metabolites
  that collectively effect the symptoms of allergy. Four antibody isotypes are coloured
  red for IgM, blue for IgA, purple for IgG and green for IgE. Selection processes
  are indicated ‘S’ in red for affinity-based selection in the GC and ‘S’ in grey
  for selection against non-autoreactive functional BCRs of the preimmune repertoire.'
