caption: '(A) Chemical structures of glucose, 2DG, and intermediates of the initial
  steps of glycolysis. Phosphorylation of 2DG yields 2DG-6P, which cannot undergo
  isomerization by glucose-6P-isomerase to fructose-6P, thereby preventing subsequent
  steps of glycolysis. (B) Schematic diagram of key steps of glycolysis illustrating
  the rate-limiting step involving phosphofructokinase which is inhibited by pyruvate,
  the end-product of the pathway. Oxidation of phosphoenolpyruvate (structure not
  shown) to pyruvate generates NADH prior to entry into the TCA cycle. Abbreviations:
  Glu, glucose; G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; GPI, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; 2DG,
  2-deoxyglucose; F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid.'
