caption: 'Chemoresistance pathways and chemosensitization in Ara-C chemoresistant
  cells. (a) Ara-C chemoresistance pathways. Leukemic cells develop different MOCs
  that determine the acquisition of resistance to Ara-C: the overexpression (red and
  bold) of oncogenes such as RAS, NFkB, MAPK and c-Myc, as well as key modulators
  of cell function such as AkT and mTOR lead to the activation of oncogenic pathways
  (CREB overexpression), antiapoptotic factors (Bcl2, Mcl1, Bcl-xL), changes in metabolism
  (blocking of NSP by dCK depletion and transition to DNSP via the RNP enzyme), and
  dysregulation of the cell cycle (via overexpression of CDKs and cyclines). This
  set of MOCs, in addition to the aberrant expression of ABC transporters, is responsible
  for the cell efflux of chemotherapy drugs and is the cause of chemoresistance and
  relapse. (b) Proposal to induce cytotoxicity in Ara-C chemoresistant AML cells.
  In the presence of standard doses of Ara-C, the addition of (i) MnKI-8e, (ii) emodin,
  (iii) metformin or (iv) niclosamide (blue boxes) produces either chemosensitization,
  a synergistic antitumor effect, apoptosis, blocking mutated pathways (mTOR and CREB),
  or negative regulation of oncogenes (NFkB, AkT, c-Myc) and key regulators of cell
  function (MAPK) compared to Ara-C alone, or in combination; (v) heteronemin or (vi)
  PD0332991 (blue boxes) sensitizes resistant AML cells to reduced or subtoxic concentrations
  of Ara-C. Standard therapeutic concentrations of Ara-C in the presence of (vi) hydroxyurea
  and azidothymidine (HU + AZT) (blue boxes) are antileukemic due to the blockade
  of the RNP enzyme, a key enzyme in the DNSP pathway. Nonmalignant cells are resistant
  to damage because they have a functional NSP pathway. The use of sorafenib or MK571
  efficiently blocks the efflux of Ara-C and Ara-CTP by inhibiting ABC transporters.
  Some MOCs prevail (metabolic switches), but the therapeutic effect of Ara-C is not
  compromised.'
