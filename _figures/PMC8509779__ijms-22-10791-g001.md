caption: SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (expressed following vaccination with either mRNA
  or adenoviral vector) binds to the ACE2 receptor followed by endocytosis. Binding
  of the adenovirus (including replication defective E1/E3 deletion variants) occurs
  via binding of the fiber-knob to the CAR (coxsackie and adenovirus receptor), followed
  by interaction between the arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif within the viral
  penton base with the integrins on the cell surface. In addition both, SARS-CoV-2
  and adenovirus bind and activate various Toll-like receptors (TLRs), leading to
  activation of the NFκB signaling pathway, including activation of IKK complexes,
  release of p50/p65 complexes from the inhibitor complex with IκBa, and translocation
  of the phosphorylated p50/p65 heterocomplex to the nucleus, where the transcription
  of proinflammatory genes, including those for cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1, and
  IL-6; chemokines, such as MCP-1 and MCP-3; adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 and
  VCAM-1; and complement components and coagulation factors, such as PAI-1, is induced.
  These processes are triggered in a broad variety of cell types that express the
  respective receptors, including epithelial cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells.
  Expression of TNFα and IL-1 and increased integrin expression can result in auto
  amplifying positive feedback loops, which may extend to other integrated systems
  such as complement and coagulation. Signaling of IL-6 via JAK/STAT3 pathway is expected
  to trigger additional amplifying loops. The release of chemokines, such as MCP-1
  and IL-8, will attract the migration and accumulation of inflammatory and immune
  cells to the site. In particular, neutrophils are attracted, releasing DNA chromatin
  nets, i.e., NETs. While these events are known to accelerate and amplify in the
  case of massive viral infection by SARS-CoV-2, the localized expression of the spike
  protein in the case of vaccination was not expected to result in levels inducing
  a major systemic symptomatic picture. However, in the case of adenoviral vector
  vaccines, additive and synergistic effects are possible. In addition to additional
  activation of the NFκB pathway, adenoviruses directly bind and activate platelets,
  which causes their activation/aggregation. Activation of platelets results in increased
  release of PF4—a tetramer with high positive surface charge—which can bind to the
  negatively charged glycosaminoglycan on endothelial cells. VITT-induced antibodies
  are induced by electrostatic binding of the positively charged PF4 tetramers to
  the negative surface of the adenoviral vector hexones forming highly immunogenic
  complexes, which trigger the formation of anti-PF4-directed antibodies. Binding
  of induced antibodies to the PF4-attached adenoviral surface facilitates uptake
  of these complexes via an Fc-gammaR-mediated process. Antigen presenting cells (APC)
  take up antibody-PF4 (adenovirus) complexes via different types of Fc-gamma receptors,
  resulting in cellular activation and complement activation. Additionally, platelets
  are able to bind such complexes via their FcgammaR2a receptor, resulting in further
  activation, release of PF4, aggregation of platelets, and thromboses. The supposed
  superantigen features of the spike protein may present an additional mechanism for
  accelerating the induction of anti-PF4 antibodies. Different from antigen-specific
  activation of single T-cell clones in the case of conventional antigens, with the
  antigen presented in the MHC-TCR groove, superantigens bind outside this groove
  to the MHC and/or TCR, resulting in polyclonal activation. Adapted from ref. [].
