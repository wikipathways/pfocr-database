caption: (A) Effect of l-NAME on the time course of changes in vessel diameter in
  response to agonists. ACh (10−4 M, n = 5), PE (10−5 M, n = 5), and KCl (250 mM,
  n = 5) were pressure-pulse ejected adjacent to a segment of the arteriole for a
  period of 2 min (▪). l-NAME (10−5 M) was added to the superfusion solution and allowed
  to equilibrate for 20 min, and had no effect on vessel diameter (Δ Diameter from
  64.5 ± 3.4 to 66.8 ± 3.4 μm, n = 15). Without changing the stimulation pipette position,
  the time course for each agonist was repeated in the presence of l-NAME. Values
  are means ± SE of paired responses before and after l-NAME. (B) Schematic of the
  proposed heterocellular Ca2+ diffusion pathway. Increases in smooth muscle [Ca2+]i
  stimulated by either PE or KCl diffuse radially to underlying endothelial cells
  through myoendothelial gap junctions. The secondary increase in endothelial cell
  [Ca2+]i stimulates NO synthase to generate NO and modulate smooth muscle [Ca2+]i
  and hence contraction. The extent of homocellular Ca2+ diffusion is limited by cell
  volume and distance.
