caption: (A) Initial model for the transcription system at RP promoters. Sfp1 localization
  is controlled by various signals and in turn influences the localization of Ifh1
  and Fhl1. As suggested by synthetic lethal interactions, Sch9 modulates RP transcription
  by a pathway parallel to Sfp1/Fhl1/Ifh1/Rgm1, perhaps by phosphorylating Rap1. Sfp1,
  Fhl1, and Rgm1 likely bind to the promoter directly via still uncharacterized sequence
  elements (gray box) (; ; ). Ifh1 and Fhl1 may activate RP transcription by switching
  Rap1 (or Abf1) between intrinsic transcriptional activation (A) and repressive (R)
  functions. (B) Summary of transcription factor localization correlated with active
  and inactive (carbon starvation) RP transcription. Two possible nonmutually exclusive
  models explain the nucleolar relocalization of Ifh1 and Fhl1 upon carbon starvation.
  (Left) In the first model, unbound Ifh1 and Fhl1 are sequestered in or near the
  nucleolus (nucl), where they may have additional functions, such as repressing rRNA
  transcription. In the second model, Ifh1 and Fhl1 and repressed RP promoters are
  drawn into the nucleolar region upon carbon starvation. (C) A model of Start entry.
  Ribosome synthesis rates and ploidy establish the critical cell size threshold,
  which represses the SBF and MBF transcription factor complexes by an unknown mechanism.
  Cell size or a parameter that correlates with size, such as translation rate, signals
  to Cln3 and/or Bck2 to activate SBF and MBF. The model is complicated by the effects
  of ribosome synthesis on translation and by increased Cln3 abundance in rich nutrient
  conditions (dashed line).
