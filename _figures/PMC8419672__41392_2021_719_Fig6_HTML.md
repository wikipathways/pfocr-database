caption: A schematic diagram depicts the possible mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 crossing
  the BBB. BBB is an intricate system of BMECs, pericytes, and astrocytes that can
  interact with neurons, microglia, and other brain components. Within BMECs, tight
  junctions (TJ) limit the paracellular diffusion of substances and pathogens. During
  infection, SARS-CoV-2 can infect the BMECs and cross the BBB to the brain via transcellular
  pathway by MMP9-mediated basement membrane (BM) disruption rather than a paracellular
  pathway. Neurons are relatively vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mitochondrial
  impairment and neuronal damage exist after infection accompanied by an inflammatory
  response, including activation of microglia/astrocytes and production of inflammatory
  factors. Further, the inflammatory factors produced by activated microglia, astrocytes
  and BMECs, in turn, exacerbate the damage of the BBB and neuronal injury
