caption: 'Role of APE1/Ref-1 in neovascular eye diseases. (A) APE1/Ref-1 redox function,
  inhibited by APX3330, APX2009 and APX2014, serves to regulate many transcription
  factors by reducing disulfide bonds of transcription factors to induce expression
  of various genes that play roles in angiogenesis, inflammation, oxidative stress
  and other pathways. APE1/Ref-1-regulated transcription factors that are linked to
  neovascular eye disease include HIF-1α, NF-κB, STAT3, AP-1 and p53. Analog RN7-58
  is similar to APX3330, APX2009 and APX2014 in structure, but it does not inhibit
  redox function. (B) APE1/Ref-1 redox activity and low oxygen levels induce expression
  of HIF-1α, which can then dimerize with HIF-1β to form HIF-1. HIF-1 can then induce
  the expression of genes, including VEGF and CA9. (C) NF-κB and STAT3 are transcription
  factors that can be activated by APE1/Ref-1 redox activity, are involved in inflammation
  and can induce expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines. (D) Transcription
  factor Nrf2, repressed by APE1/Ref-1 in many cell types, regulates cellular defenses
  against oxidative stress and induces expression of HO-1 and other proteins involved
  in detoxification and elimination of ROS. ROS can also induce oxidative stress by
  inducing expression of VEGF, HIF-1α and the JAK/STAT pathway, making these various
  pathways connected. (E) Increases in angiogenesis, inflammation and oxidative stress
  in a healthy eye can lead to neovascular eye diseases, such as PDR, ROP and nvAMD.
  APE1/Ref-1 inhibitors, such as APX3330, APX2009 and APX2014, block the redox ability
  of APE1/Ref-1 to oxidize transcription factors. Blocking APE1/Ref-1 redox activity
  in the eye can decrease angiogenesis, inflammation and oxidative stress via de-repressing
  Nrf2. Therefore, APE1/Ref-1 redox inhibitors interfere with pathways implicated
  in neovascular eye diseases such as PDR, ROP and nvAMD. Created with BioRender.com.
