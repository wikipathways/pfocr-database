caption: Model of cortex glia-MB neuron glucose shuttling during LTM consolidationDuring
  LTM formation, acetylcholine (ACh) activates nAChRa7 in cortex glia. Whether ACh
  comes from cholinergic MB neurons or from other neurons was not addressed in this
  study and remains to be determined. The resulting increase in intracellular calcium
  concentration in cortex glia triggers Ilp4 secretion and autocrine action on InR
  and its canonical interactors PI3K and Akt1. Insulin signaling results in an increase
  in glucose concentration through an undetermined glucose transporter. Subsequently,
  glucose is shuttled toward the somata of MB neurons via Glut1 in both cell types.
  Glucose is then used to feed the PPP.
