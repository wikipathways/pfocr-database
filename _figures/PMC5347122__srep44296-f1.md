caption: The mevalonate pathway enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (Hmr1), and the trichothecene
  biosynthetic pathway enzymes trichodiene synthase (Tri5), trichodiene oxygenase
  (Tri4), calonectrin oxygenase (Tri1), as well as Tri14 were tagged at the C-terminus
  with fluorescent proteins RFP or GFP. Hmr1 catalyzes the synthesis of mevalonate,
  leading to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which is utilized by essential metabolic
  pathways (e.g. biosynthesis of ubiquinone, steroids and terpenes) as well as the
  trichothecene pathway. After cyclization of FPP by Tri5, oxygenation of the trichodiene
  product by Tri4 creates the toxic epoxide moiety in isotrichodermol and subsequent
  pathway intermediates. Further reactions catalyzed by Tri101, Tri11, Tri3, Tri1,
  and Tri8 generate deoxynivalenol (DON) and 15- acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON). The
  reason why Tri14 is required for DON synthesis in planta is not known.
