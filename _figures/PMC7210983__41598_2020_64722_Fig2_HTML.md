caption: 'Baseline metabolomic profiles: AC have prominent sugar metabolism whereas
  EC exhibit strong purine and amino acid metabolism. The relationship of metabolite
  abundance between AC and EC during baseline conditions (NX + Glc) using two different
  pathway analyses. (a) Overview of metabolites highly abundant in AC (red) and EC
  (blue) embedded in their metabolic pathways using MetaboAnalyst (v.4.0) and KEGG
  metabolic pathways tool. The size of the circles represents the fold change with
  dark and light colors depicting significant and non-significant differences respectively.
  Purple lines represent carbohydrate metabolism, red lines nucleotide metabolism,
  dark green lines lipid metabolism, orange: amino acid metabolism. n = 4. (b) Heatmap
  shows the major metabolic pathway activity in different cell types, AC (red) and
  EC (blue), relative to each other. The -Log10(P) value for each pathway was calculated
  using the MetaboAnalyst v.4.0 enrichment analysis tool. n = 4.'
