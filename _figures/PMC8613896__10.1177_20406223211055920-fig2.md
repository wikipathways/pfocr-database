caption: 'Early stage HS: The first event in HS lesions is hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia
  of the infundibular epithelium (1), produced by chronic friction, genetic predisposition,
  and environmental factors. This leads to follicular ‘plugging’, follicular dilatation
  (2), and eventual rupture (3). Bacteria and cellular debris including pathogen-
  and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) are released to the dermis
  initiating an innate immune response when recognized by TLRs. PAMPs and DAMPs activate
  the inflammasome response involving the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in macrophages
  and neutrophils with subsequent activation of caspase-1 and activation of proinflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-1β. IL-1β provokes the production of chemokines by fibroblasts
  (CXCL1 and CXCL6) that will mainly attract neutrophils. TNF-α, secreted by macrophages
  and dendritic cells, induces the production by keratinocytes of a wide range of
  chemokines (CXCL8, CXCL11, CCL20, and CCL2), which attract neutrophils, subsets
  of T cells, and monocytes into the skin. Activated dendritic cells, through the
  production of IL-23 and IL-12, promote polarization of CD4+ T cells toward Th17
  and Th1 cells, respectively. Activation of the complement pathway contributes to
  neutrophil activation and recruitment by C3a and C5a.'
