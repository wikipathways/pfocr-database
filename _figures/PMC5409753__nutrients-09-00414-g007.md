caption: Curcumin induced autophagy via the ERK1/2 signal pathway to protect chondrocytes
  from apoptosis. IL-1β stimulates the IL-1β receptor, initiating an intracellular
  signal transduction cascade, which inhibits the cytoplasmic MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway, then activates proinflammatory and pro-apoptotic gene production. ERK1/ERK2,
  a downstream kinase of the MAPK pathway, regulates the expression and activity of
  various transcription factors. Specific inhibition of ERK1/ERK2 by U0126 or IL-1β
  results in cleavage of caspase-3 in primary chondrocytes in vitro. Since activation
  of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation are common features of apoptosis, the specific
  inhibition of the Ras-mitogen-activated kinase leads to chondrocyte apoptosis. Curcumin
  blocks the inhibition effect of U0126 or IL-1β on the MAPK pathway and activates
  autophagy in chondrocytes. Beclin-1 promotes LC3 activation. Recruitment and integration
  of LC3B-II into the growing phagophore, eventually results in the formation of autophagosomes.
