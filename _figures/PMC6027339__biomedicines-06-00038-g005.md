caption: Inactivating mutations in classical IκB proteins promote canonical NF-κB
  activation. (a) The canonical NF-κB pathway is induced by the ligand-dependent activation
  of a variety of receptors, such as antigen receptors, the IL-1 receptor, Toll-like
  receptors and members of the TNF receptor family. Stimulus-dependent activation
  of the IKK complex results in the phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation
  of IκBα and IκBε. This allows the nuclear translocation of transcriptionally active
  RelA/p50 or c-Rel/p50 heterodimers; (b) Genetic alterations resulting in the expression
  of non-functional truncated versions of IκBα and IκBε, which lack part of the ankyrin
  repeat domain and are thus unable to bind to the NF-κB transcription factors, promote
  constitutive NF-κB activation in a subset of lymphoid malignancies. Proteins that
  are affected by recurrent genetic lesions in lymphoid malignancies are denoted with
  a red asterisk. IκB, inhibitor of κB; IKK, IκB kinase.
