caption: Inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides(A) Inositol phosphates contain
  only inositol and phosphate and are therefore water soluble and cytoplasmic. Ins(1,4,5)P3
  can be converted to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 by InsP3K family members , , . InsP7 is a higher
  inositol phosphate containing energetic pyrophosphate bonds ,  and is formed by
  InsP6K family members , , . Phosphoinositides also contain inositol and phosphates,
  but in addition they contain two hydrophobic fatty acids and are therefore not water
  soluble and are mainly localized to membrane structures. (B) PI3K isoforms. Class
  I PI3Ks are heterodimeric proteins with a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit.
  Class IA PI3Ks consist of a catalytic subunit, p110 (α, β, or δ), and an adaptor
  subunit, p85 (α or β), and they are regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases. The
  only class IB member is p110γ, which is associated with p101 and p84/p87PIKAPregulatory
  subunits and is regulated by GPCRs such as chemokine receptors, C5a, and LTB4 ,

  mediating protein translocation via binding to their pleckstrin homolog (PH) domains.
  PH domain is a divergent protein module of approximately 120 amino acids found in
  many proteins involved in signal transduction , , , , , . There are more than 200
  PH domains identified in the human genome. PH domains often mediate protein–protein
  or protein–phosphoinositide interactions. A subset of PH domains, including those
  in Btk, protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, PLC-γ, Gab1, PDK1, and Grp1, drive membrane
  translocation of their host proteins through specific, high-affinity recognition
  of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Only the PH domain-containing protein molecules on the plasma
  membrane can be activated, which in turn elicit various signal transduction pathways
  mediating neutrophil functions.
