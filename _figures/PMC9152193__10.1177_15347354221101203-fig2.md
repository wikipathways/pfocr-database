caption: The functional mechanism of CK on different tumors. CK induces apoptosis
  and autophagy in non-small cell lung cancer cells through activating AMPK/mTOR and
  JNK pathways. CK induces bladder cancer cell apoptosis through activation of p38mapk
  pathway mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). CK induces apoptosis of colon
  cancer cells through the activation of CAMK-IV/AMPK pathway. CK induces autophagy
  and apoptosis of human colon cancer cells through increasing the level of ROS and
  activating JNK signal. CK induces osteosarcoma cell apoptosis and inhibits its proliferation
  and invasion through inhibition of PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K1 pathway. CK induces apoptosis
  of human multiple myeloma cells through inhibiting JAK1/STAT3 signal. CK inhibits
  TNF-α-promoted colon cancer metastasis in mice through inhibiting NF-κB signaling.
  Blue lines demonstrate the promotion (→) or inhibition (⊣) roles of signal pathways.
  Green lines indicate the promotion (→) or inhibition (⊣) roles of CK.
