caption: Signaling pathways of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis. The black
  arrow indicates positive regulation, and the red inhibitory arrow indicates negative
  regulation. The genes obtained from RNA-seq analysis are shown on a pink background,
  including GZMB, PRF1, and FYN, which mainly mediate cytotoxicity through the perforin–granzyme
  pathway in the LTBI state, and TNFSF10, TNFRSF10A, IFNR1, and IFNR2, which mainly
  mediate cytotoxicity through the death receptor pathway in the ATB state. The proteins
  obtained from the LC-MS/MS analysis are shown in a blue background and include HAVCR2,
  THBS1, PF4, HMGB1, MAVS, and HDAC2, which regulate the production of tumor necrosis
  factor in the LTBI state, and STX4, GSK3B, RFFL, and STK4, which are involved in
  the regulation of cytotoxicity mediated by extrinsic apoptosis in the ATB state.
  The genes that inhibit cytotoxicity obtained from RNA-seq analysis are shown on
  a gray background, including KIR2DL1, KIR2DL4, HLA_B, HLA_E, HLA_C, and PTPN11,
  which inhibit cytotoxicity and apoptosis in the LTBI state
