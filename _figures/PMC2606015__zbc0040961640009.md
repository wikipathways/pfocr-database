caption: A schematic view of the Vav family-regulated signaling pathways of DT40  B-cells.
  The main signal transduction molecules with positive roles in  downstream signaling
  are indicated in black (the ones analyzed in  this work) and blue (the ones not
  analyzed in our experiments).  Putative negative regulators of B-cell signaling
  that could be operating in  this pathway are shown in red. The main second messengers
  are  indicated in green. Black thick arrows highlight the  prevalence of a signaling
  pathway over the rest of the signaling connections  presented in the figure. Gray
  arrows indicate pathways that have not  been demonstrated yet in DT40 cells. See
  main text for further  information.
