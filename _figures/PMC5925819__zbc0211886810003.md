caption: Phosphatidylinositol cycle. The synthesis of PtdIns occurs in the ER or possibly
  in ER-derived vesicles termed PIPEROsomes. First, glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) is
  dually acylated by the actions of acyltransferases glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase
  (GPAT) and 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase (LPAT), which forms lysophosphatidic
  acid (LPA) and produces phosphatidic acid (PA), respectively. Next, PA in the ER
  or the PIPEROsomes is converted to CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) by the enzyme CDP-DAG
  synthases (CDS). Phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS) in the ER of PIPEROsome catalyzes
  the coupling of CDP-DAG to myo-inositol to form PtdIns. Once synthesized in the
  ER or the ER-derived vesicles, PtdIns is delivered to the PM by the secretory pathway
  (not depicted) or by the actions of either nonselective (TMEM24, E-Syts) or PtdIns
  (Nir2, PITP). The PtdIns serves as a substrate for generating the plasmalemmal phosphoinositides.
  PI4,5P2 is vital to facilitate many of the plasmalemmal transactions such as signaling
  in response to growth factors, exocytosis, endocytosis, and the polymerization of
  cortical actin. The activation of PLC isoforms converts PI4,5P2 into DAG, which
  can then be converted back to PA by one of 10 DAG kinases. To prevent the accumulation
  of PA and to replenish the plasmalemmal PtdIns pool, PA is transferred back to the
  ER via nonvesicular lipid transport proteins. Red arrows represent metabolic reactions;
  blue arrows represent intracellular transport process; enzymes. DGK, diacylglycerol
  kinase.
