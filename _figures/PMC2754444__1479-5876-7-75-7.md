caption: Protein Tyrosine Kinase and other Major Kinases involved in Angiogenic Pathways.
  Pathways were constructed by the direct Interaction Function Bioinformatics Programs
  of Stratagene Pathway Architect. ALL proteins mapped in this figure have been either
  upregulated or expressed de novo post-HIV-infection. Proteins were uploaded and
  function-specific pathways were generated automatically for protein tyrosine kinases
  expressed in HIV-infected cells. Note that the newly discovered angiogenic pathways
  involve distinct protein tyrosine kinases and signaling proteins as described in
  the text. These pathways are independent of VEGFR2-VEGFC interactions as they do
  not interact with any of the proteins expressed in HIV-infected cells. Full names
  of all protein abbreviations and accession numbers are listed in Table 1.
