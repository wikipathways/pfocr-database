caption: Model of how the ∆133p53 isoform regulates the JAK-STAT3 and RhoA-ROCK pathways
  to promote inflammation and invasion. Wt p53 is activated by some (as yet undefined)
  stress signal, which turns on ∆133p53. ∆133p53 increases IL-6, which, then binds
  to its receptor and signals through the JAK-STAT pathway to amplify the IL-6 signal
  further. The JAK-STAT pathway, now constitutively activated by ∆133p53, drives actin
  polarisation, cell migration via RhoA-ROCK signalling and alters migration of immune
  cells
