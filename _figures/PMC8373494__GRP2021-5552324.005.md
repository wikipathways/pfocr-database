caption: Mechanism diagram of TMEM100 inhibiting CRC. TMEM100 inhibits TGF-β activation
  by suppressing the interaction between TGF-β ligand and its homology type I and
  type II one-way transmembrane receptors, thereby inhibiting its Smad2/Smad3 phosphorylation.
  Ultimately, progression of CRC cells was hampered. Red circles represent phosphorylation.
  I and II represent TGF-β type I and type II receptors, respectively.
