caption: Influence of two haplotypes of GAME9 on the steroidal alkaloid pathway. GAME9
  activates the synthesis of SGAs in tomato. GAME9135A is mainly present in the PIM
  and CER populations and encodes a protein that can bind the GAME7 and GAME17 promoter.
  In contrast, GAME9135V is mainly present in the BIG population and encodes a protein
  that shows weak binding to the GAME17 promoter, and which might use an intermediate
  bHLH-like transcription factor, such as SlMYC2, to up-regulate SGA biosynthesis.
