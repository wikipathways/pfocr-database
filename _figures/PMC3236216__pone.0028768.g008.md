caption: In this figure, all entity relationships (protein-protein binding, promoter
  binding by transcription factor, known regulatory relationship, and other relationships)
  are shown for all up-regulated genes in the PS animals that were shown to be regulated
  by one of these five genes in the Sub-Network Enrichment Analysis. Green lines indicate
  promoter binding evidence; blue lines indicate regulation evidence only; all links
  reported by PubMed literature were obtained using Pathway Studio® (Ariadne). Note
  the large number of genes in common among the IFNG, SPI1 and CEBPB regulons, as
  well as that miR-155 negatively regulates both SPI1 and CEBPB.
