caption: In response to death signaling, activator BH3-only proteins are triggered
  to interact with BAX and BAK, inducing BAX and BAK oligomerization. This oligomerization
  is followed by MOMP, which releases proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c to
  the cytosol. Cytosolic cytochrome c forms a complex with apoptosis protease–activating
  factor–1 (APAF-1) and caspase-9 to make the holoenzyme known as the apoptosome,
  which in turn activates effector caspase-3, leading to widespread proteolysis. This
  pathway can be interrupted by antiapoptotic members, such as BCL2, which can bind
  activator BH3-only proteins, preventing their interaction with BAX and BAK. This
  inhibitory interaction can itself be antagonized by sensitizer BH3-only domains,
  which compete for the binding site in BCL2, displacing activators bound by BCL2.
  BFL1, BCL2-related gene expressed in fetal liver.
