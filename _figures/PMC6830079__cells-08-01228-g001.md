caption: Cyclic GMP AMP synthase-STING (cGAS-STING) pathway signaling as activated
  by genomic instability. Cells with ongoing chromosomal instability (CIN) produce
  structures that contain genomic DNA, known as micronuclei. Upon the rupture of its
  membrane, dsDNA contained in a micronucleus is exposed to the cytoplasm and bound
  by cGAS. The binding of cGAS to dsDNA triggers the production of its secondary messenger,
  cGAMP that in turn binds and activates STING. Activated STING kinase translocates
  from the ER to the Golgi and phosphorylates its downstream targets, initiating (1)
  a TBK1-IRF3-type I interferon response, (2) a canonical NF-kB response, or (3) a
  non-canonical NF-kB response. * indicates stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1).
