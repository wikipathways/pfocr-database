caption: Schematic representation of co-mutation-associated changes in the immune
  and non-immune microenvironment of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). (a) LKB1
  inactivation promotes epigenetic suppression of STING and insensitivity to cytosolic
  DNA that accumulates in the cytoplasm of KRAS- and LKB1-mutant (KL) cells due to
  dysfunctional mitochondria. KL tumors are further characterized by a pro-inflammatory
  cytokine milieu with accumulation of immunosuppressive neutrophils, marked paucity
  of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and evidence of T-cell exhaustion, . The potential contributions
  of immune cell metabolic restriction, altered angiogenesis and acidification of
  the tumor microenvironment (highlighted in blue) to the immune-inert phenotype of
  KL tumors remain as yet unexplored, but represent plausible directions for future
  study. (b) MYC fosters immune evasion of murine KrasG12D- driven LUADs through IL-23-
  mediated expulsion of T, B and NK cells and CCL9-mediated macrophage recruitment
  and secretion of immunosuppressive VEGF. (c) KEAP1 mutations, which frequently co-occur
  with mutations in LKB1, particularly in the context of KRAS-mutant LUAD, have also
  been associated with low intra-tumoral density of infiltrating T- and B- lymphocytes,
  although the possible role of KEAP1 loss on NK cell infiltration remains unclear.
  Stabilization of NRF2 as a result of KEAP1 inactivation may further promote reduced
  expression of STING through post-transcriptional regulation. (d) Finally, somatic
  TP53 mutations have been shown to mediate NF-κB pathway activation in Kras-mutant
  murine models of LUAD. Although TP53 mutations have been associated with reduced
  production of chemokines required for the recruitment of NK and T cells in some
  models and human tumors, in the context of KRAS-mutant LUAD TP53 co-alterations
  promote an inflamed tumor immune microenvironment with increased production of interferon
  γ (IFNγ) and increased expression of PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells, , .
