caption: Shigella virulence gene regulation. The diagram shows the simplified regulatory
  pathway of Shigella virulence and regulation of virF, with emphasis on the CpxAR
  two-component system, which plays a role in the virulence defect of the efp mutant.
  Proteins in circles are virulence effector proteins, which were found at decreased
  levels in the efp mutant. Note that although the proteins are depicted in the figure,
  the regulation shown occurs at the level of transcription.
