caption: 'The regulation of hepcidin expression (adapted from Silvestri et al.). Schematic
  representation of a model of hepcidin regulation by two branches of the bone morphogenetic
  protein (BMP)-SMAD pathway, based on BMP knockout models,,, in (A) iron overload,
  (B) iron deficiency, (C) erythropoiesis expansion and (D) inflammation. According
  to a recent study BMP2 and BMP6 work collaboratively in vivo, possibly as a heterodimer.
  (A) BMP2 produced by liver endothelial cells (LSEC) binds BMP receptor type II,
  which phosphorylates the BMP receptors type I (ALK3) to activate SMAD1/5/8. The
  latter associated with SMAD4 translocate to the nucleus to bind BMP responsive elements
  (BRE) in the hepcidin promoter. In iron overload increased diferric transferrin
  displaces HFE from transferrin receptor (TFR) 1 to enable iron uptake and stabilizes
  surface TFR2 potentiating ALK3 signaling. Hemojuvelin (HJV) acts as a BMP co-receptor,
  while the function of the other hemochromatosis HFE and TFR2 proteins in the pathway
  activation is still unclear. Iron increases the production of BMP6 by LSEC, thereby
  activating ALK2 and likely also ALK3 (indicated by a dotted arrow) in the pathway.
  (B) In iron deficiency TMPRSS6, stabilized on the cell surface, cleaves HJV and
  inactivates the BMP2-ALK3 branch of the pathway. TFR2 is destabilized by the lack
  of diferric transferrin and HFE binds TFR1. The BMP6 pathway is inactive in the
  absence of the ligand and also because ALK2 is inactivated by FKBP12 binding. Together
  with epigenetic regulation, this suppresses hepcidin expression. (C) Erythropoiesis
  enhanced by erythropoietin consumes a large amount of iron: low serum iron (and
  diferric transferrin) suppresses the BMP2-ALK3 pathway, while BMP6 and other BMP
  are sequestered by erythroferrone (ERFE) released by erythroid cells., The result
  is hepcidin inhibition. (D) Schematic representation of hepcidin regulation by inflammatory
  cytokines and of the pathogenesis of anemia of inflammation. Stimulated by inflammation
  [here indicated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)],
  macrophages produce interleukin-6 (IL6), which stimulates Janus kinase 2–signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2-STAT3) signaling to upregulate
  hepcidin in association with the BMP-SMAD pathway.'
