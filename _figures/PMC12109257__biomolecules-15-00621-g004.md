caption: RAS pathway mutation and its implications in oral cancer. The normal and
  mutated states of the RAS signaling pathway, illustrating how mutations at codons
  12, 13, or 61 in the RAS gene result in constitutively active RAS proteins. These
  mutations prevent RAS from switching off, leading to the continuous activation of
  downstream effectors such as RAF, PI3K, and RALGDS, promoting unchecked cell proliferation.
  In OSCC, although RAS mutations are less frequent compared to other cancers, their
  presence can contribute to resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, complicating
  treatment strategies
