caption: CRISPRi efficiently represses pck transcription, increasing l-glutamate production.
  (a) Central metabolic pathway. The notation in red represents the reduced transcription
  of pck due to CRISPRi-mediated repression (b) Gene and sequences targeted by dCas9.
  (c) Amino acid titers (g/L) of the control and test strains (N = 9 per strain) were
  determined upon glucose depletion. The error bars represent the standard deviation
  of samples. “NS” represents nonsignificant (p > 0.05), **p ≤ 0.01 and ***p ≤ 0.001.
