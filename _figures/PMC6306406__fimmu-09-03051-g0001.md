caption: 'The schematic elucidation of IL-33. (A) The schematic structure of IL-33
  protein and its critical domains. (B) The pathway involved IL-33 and its receptor.
  (A) IL-33 gene is constitutively located on the short arm of chromosome 9 at 9p24.1.
  The structure of IL-33 protein contains two evolutionary conserved domains: a chromatin-binding
  motif, and a cleavage site for inflammatory proteases and apoptotic caspases. (B)
  The release mechanisms of IL-33 can occur by mechanical and oxidative stress, necrotic
  cell death, or cell activation that functions as an alarmin. IL-33 is rapidly released
  from cells during necrosis or tissue injury, and signals through a cell surface
  receptor complex, ST2 (IL-1 receptor-like 1, IL1RL1) and IL1RAcP (IL-1 receptor
  accessory protein), to initiate inflammatory pathways in immune cells. This clustered
  domain recruits signaling adaptor and kinases (including MyD88, IRAK1/4, TRAF6)
  in order to activate the transcription factors in tumor cells. The possible results
  would be a generated cancer-related inflammatory microenvironment, with tumor-promoting
  effects.'
