caption: Working model for how ERα may modulate signaling by TLR-activated DCs. Activated
  DCs produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (ex. IL-23, IL-1β, IFNα) that promote ongoing
  inflammation via multiple mechanisms. As demonstrated, the expansion and stabilization
  of the Th17 subset of T cells via IL-6 and IL-23 and the upregulation of IL23R are
  all impacted by the presence of ERα. In the absence of ERα, TLR stimulation cannot
  fully induce IL-6, IL-1β, IL-23 or IL-23R upregulation on spleen cells (or DCs),
  leading to fewer IL-17-producing cells. Additionally, lupus-prone ERα−/−mice have
  decreased numbers of plasmacytoid DCs that feed into this pathway via production
  of IFNα.
