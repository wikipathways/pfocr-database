caption: Inhibition of IGF-I signaling is involved in neuronal death after H2O2. A
  competitive interplay between AKT and JNK in regulating FOXO3 activity dictates
  the neuronal response to an abrupt rise in ROS elicited by H2O2. Cytotoxic levels
  of H2O2 sequentially activate two independent pathways. A rapid route (1) includes
  activation of p38 MAPK to inhibit IGF-I signaling by interfering IGF-I receptor/IRS-1
  interactions through phosphorylation of serine residues in IRS-1. This leads to
  abrogation of AKT inhibition of FOXO. A delayed route (2) recruits JNK2 to activate
  FOXO. Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway is essential because JNK is unable to activate
  FOXO if AKT is active. Conversely, once JNK activates FOXO, it becomes refractory
  to inactivation by AKT. The different inhibitory drugs and stimulatory and inhibitory
  DNA constructs used in this study are indicated.
