caption: SARS-CoV-2 or endosome-encapsulated DNA, activates cyclic GMP-AMP synthase
  (cGAS), leading to the production of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP binds to the
  stimulator of interferon genes (STING), triggering a signaling cascade. STING activation
  recruits and stimulates transcription factors, including IRF3, NF-κB, and IRF7,
  resulting in the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-6 and TNF. This pathway is essential in mounting an innate immune response
  to viral infections and cytosolic DNA. The figure illustrates STING agonists, including
  diABZI diacylbenzimidazole), diABZI-4, CF501, mucoadhesive nanoparticles, SIAPA
  (stimulator of interferon genes-activating polymeric agents), and Mn Jelly (manganese
  jelly), which enhance antiviral immunity by activating the cGAS-STING pathway
