caption: Regulation of the sex determination cascade. The top line shows a schematic
  diagram of the regulatory relationships of the sex differentiation cascade. Solid
  lines represent definitively characterized interactions. Dotted lines represent
  possible additional relationships (, , ). Genetic data imply the existence of other
  genes that control behavior and neural development, which are under the control
  of tra and tra2 but not regulated by dsx (, ). One gene proposed as a candidate
  for such regulation is fruitless (fru; refs. , , and ). The work in this paper suggests
  dissatisfaction (dsf) as a second candidate for a member of a dsx-independent pathway
  controlling behavior.
