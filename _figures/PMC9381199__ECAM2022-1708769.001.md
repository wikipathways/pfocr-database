caption: The purinergic receptors' role in governing the secretion of insulin and
  the survival of β-cells. The GLUT2 facilitates the entrance of glucose. Glycolysis
  yields ATP. The ATP produced is used to close up the ATP-sensitive channel, KATP.
  The KATP channel is made up of 4 (four) Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits. When the KATP
  closes, the cell membrane potential depolarises and this leads to the opening of
  the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels, generating Ca2+ action-potentials. An increase
  in the cellular Ca2+ triggers ATP-insulin-containing secretory vesicles exocytosis.
  Parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves may also release ATP. Membrane depolarisation
  and Ca2+/Na+ influx are facilitated by P2X receptors. P2Y receptors elevate cellular
  Ca2+ and “turn on” protein kinase C (PKC) pathways. Also, other P2Y and adenosine
  receptors affect the cAMP pathway and possibly Epac signalling. High adenosine concentrations
  are a “force” that coerces adenosine translocation into the β-cell, thus exerting
  metabolic effects.
