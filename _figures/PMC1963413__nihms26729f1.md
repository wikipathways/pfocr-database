caption: 'The oval of iNOS-inducing signaling pathways. Several signal transduction
  pathways culminate by activating transcription factors, which upon activation, translocate
  to the nucleus and bind with co-activators like p300 and members of basic transcription
  machinery to form the transcription initiation complex (TIC). This TIC facilitates
  the bending of iNOS promoter. Segment A: Signal transduction of dsRNA is mediated
  by TLR-3 which subsequently recruits NF-κB and C/EBPβ via PKR and p38-MAPK. Segment
  B: Cross talk of iNOS signaling and cholesterol pathway. Geranyl-pyrophosphate and
  farnesyl-pyrophosphate, generated from mother carbon skeleton of isopendenyl pyrophosphate,
  modify membrane bound Rac and Ras, respectively, leading to their activation. Subsequently,
  MAP kinase pathways are employed to activate specific transcription factors. Segment
  C: The JAK-STAT pathway. Ligand-mediated engagement of receptor tyrosine kinases
  lead to their auto-activation and permits recruitment and phosphorylation of JAK.
  Thereafter, receptor bound JAK mediates phosphorylation, dimerization, and activation
  of STAT which bind to GAS elements in iNOS promoter. Segment D: MAP-kinase pathways.
  Activation of various receptors induces a downstream signal, which is mediated by
  one or more out of the three MAP-K cascades. Several transcription factors act downstream
  of specific MAPK. This figure indicates the central role of p38 MKP in iNOS induction.'
