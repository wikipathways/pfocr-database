caption: Mechanism of the antimalarial activity of the choline analog T3. This representative
  bis-quaternary ammonium compound is thought to enter the infected erythrocyte through
  the new permeation pathway or another (unknown) mechanism (represented by the question
  mark near the RBC membrane). This choline analog is then taken up into the intraerythrocytic
  parasite via an organic cation transporter present on the parasite plasma membrane.
  This perturbs choline uptake from the host cell compartment, thus disrupting the
  synthesis of the predominant membrane lipid, phosphatidylcholine. Additional effects
  on phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis enzymes have also been proposed []. T3 and other
  biscationic compounds also accumulate within the parasite, mostly in the digestive
  vacuole (DV, yellow) where they bind heme (ferriprotoporphyrin IX). This heme interaction
  has also been hypothesized to contribute to their antiplasmodial activity []. These
  compounds, therefore, might have multiple sites of action within the parasite. CCT,
  phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; CDP, cytidine diphosphate; CK, choline kinase;
  CPT, choline phosphate transferase; Hz, hemozoin; P, phosphate; RBC, red blood cell.
