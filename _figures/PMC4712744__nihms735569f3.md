caption: Transcriptomic analysis of kidney cortex from 24 wk old db/db diabetic mice
  and db/+ control mice for genes involved in ceramide metabolism identified altered
  expression of genes in ceramide synthesis and downstream sphingosine-1-phosphate
  signaling. Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis was used to visualize changes in both the
  canonical ceramide biosynthesis pathway and the sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling
  pathway. Green = significantly downregulated, pink = significantly upregulated,
  gray = unchanged.
