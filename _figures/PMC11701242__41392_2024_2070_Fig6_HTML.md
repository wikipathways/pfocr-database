caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of phase separation in TGF-β, NF-κB, and JAK-STAT pathway.
  a Phase separation in regulation of TGF-β signaling pathway: In canonical TGF-β
  signaling, in response to the secretion signal peptide, Smad transducer proteins
  (SMAD2/3) are phosphorylated by type I receptor kinase and translocate to the nucleus
  with the SMAD4 to regulate transcriptional responses. SMAD2/3-SMAD4 complex facilitates
  the DNA binding and activates the TGF-β signal. SFPQ LLPS isolated SMAD4 from the
  SMAD2/3 complex and impeded SMAD-dependent gene expression. SFPQ recruits TDP-43
  and FUS to the SMAD4, triggering the formation of paraspeckles and transcriptional
  regulation. Transcriptional condensates formed by signaling factors β-catenin, STAT3,
  and SMAD3 selectively engage with super-enhancer-associated genes, thereby driving
  cell-type-specific responses, while also interfering with TGF-β signaling. b NEMO
  Phase Separation in regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway: Upon cytokine activation,
  such as TNF, NEMO plays a crucial role in connecting NF-κB signaling pathways. NEMO
  recruits components of the IκB kinase (IKKα and IKKβ) and polyubiquitin chains,
  facilitating the phosphorylation of IKKβ by TAK1. This leads to autophosphorylation
  of IκB and subsequent degradation, allowing NF-κB dimers like p50 and p60/c-Rel
  to rapidly translocate to the nucleus and activate NF-κB signaling. c CNF1 phase
  separation and M1 macrophage polarization via JAK/STAT signaling: Bacterial toxin
  CNF1, produced during bacterial infections, forms condensates around cytokine receptors
  even without external stimuli. CNF1 directly binds to JAK1/2, significantly enhancing
  their phosphorylation. This activation subsequently induces phosphorylation and
  dimerization of STAT1. As a result, CNF1 promotes M1 macrophage polarization and
  contributes to inflammatory dysregulation through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway'
