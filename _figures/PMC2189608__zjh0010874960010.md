caption: Involvement of PAR2 and Casp-14 in corneocyte formation. Decreases in calcium
  in the outer stratum granulosum after barrier disruption stimulate lamellar body
  secretion, while transiently inhibiting keratinocyte differentiation. The SP/PAR2,
  pH-dependent pathway signals terminal differentiation and inhibits lamellar body
  secretion. Moreover, an increase in Casp-14 activity is essential for accelerated
  cornification in response to barrier disruption and for the formation of normal
  corneocytes.
