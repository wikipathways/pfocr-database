caption: The maturation pathway of dendritic cells. The dendritic cell (middle) drives
  the development of effector T cells or T-regs. The response against the microbiota-derived
  antigens regulates the phenotypic expression of costimulatory (CD80/CD86) molecules
  through Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and specific cytokine release from dendritic
  cells. Tolerogenic dendritic cells might shift the balance to restore self-tolerance
  and reach long-term remission in autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases.
