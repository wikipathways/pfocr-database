caption: . A schematic metabolic pathway showing arginine biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis.
  Logarithmic fold changes (log2 FC) of metabolites that were identified in untargeted
  metabolomics are shown on the left in red. Genes encoding enzymes of the corresponding
  reaction were shown in blue with the log2 FC in expression levels shown in black
  according to Kahramanoglou and colleagues. Pathway data acquired from KEGG pathway
  (; https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) and Mycobrowser (; https://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/).
