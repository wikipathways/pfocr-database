caption: 'Constitutive and oncogenic activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. In (A), several
  growth factors, hormones, and cytokines activate the receptor tyrosine-kinase (RTK)
  favoring the constitutive activation of RAS by switching GDP-GTP toward the activate
  state. The downstream signaling is regulated by RAS-GTP and additional proteins
  that are not shown in this figure. Ras activates BRAF which facilitates the phosphorylation
  of MEK, which in turn allows the phosphorylation and activation of ERK. The resulting
  signaling cascade culminates with translocation of ERK to the nucleus, and the activation
  of transcription factors that result in the expression of genes related to proliferation,
  differentiation, and survival. In (B,C), in the presence of oncogenic BRAF and KRAS,
  respectively, the constitutive activation is independent of extracellular factors
  and does not respond to biochemical signals that would normally regulate the activity.
