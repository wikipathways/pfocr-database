caption: Proposed model of ICAM-1-mediated changes in Ps in microvasculature. Under
  control conditions, there is a constitutive permeability pathway mediated via basally
  expressed ICAM-1 (independently of interactions with leukocytes; left) in a PKC-dependent
  manner. Following TNF-α treatment, the expression of ICAM-1 and consequent interactions
  with β2-integrins increase, resulting in ICAM-1 clustering and, hence, increasing
  Ps via a switch to a different, Src-dependent pathway. PMN, neutrophil; TNFR, TNF
  receptors; PM, plasma membrane.

  via ICAM-1-mediated signaling.
