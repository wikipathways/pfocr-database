caption: The left part of the model shows the transcriptional regulation of tyrosine
  hydroxylase gene (Th), encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of dopamine synthesis.
  Th is regulated by the nuclear receptors ROR, REV-ERB, and NURR1 via the regulatory
  promoter elements RRE and NR. The right part of the model depicts the regulation
  of the monoamine oxidase A gene (MaoA), encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of dopamine
  degradation. MaoA is regulated by BMAL1 (B), CLOCK (C)/NPAS2 (N) via an E-box element
  present in the MaoA promoter. PER2 can influence both arms of dopamine regulatory
  genes via interaction with REV-ERB/NURR1 and interference with BMAL1/NPAS2. The
  hatched lines illustrate a regulatory pathway for REV-ERB present in the liver,
  involving heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This pathway
  may potentially also be present in the brain
