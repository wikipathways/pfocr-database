caption: Model of flg22 effect on MPK6/ERF104 interaction. The ERF104/MPK6 complex
  disruption requires flg22 stimulation of MPK6 activity () that also positively affects
  ERF104 stability, as well as ET signaling (). The rapid ET signal may be upstream
  (A) or downstream (B) of MPK6 activation; but the inhibitor/mutant analyses support
  the latter. Yoo et al. reported bifurcate pathways downstream of ETR (ET receptors)
  and CTR1, one of which includes MKK9, to antagonistically control EIN3 stability
  (). Question marks denote the report that active MKK9 can raise ET levels to feedback
  positively into ET signaling (); but this conflicts with results reported by Yoo
  et al. (). The ERF104/MPK6 complex disruption by flg22 is independent of the MKK9
  pathway but dependent on EIN2 and EIN3/EIL (EIN3-like) proteins.
