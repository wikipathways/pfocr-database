caption: Applications of DRS. Stroma-rich PDAC tumors can be induced by Pdx1-Flp–
  mediated activation of an FRT-stop-FRT (FSF) silenced oncogenic KrasG12D allele
  in the pancreas. Middle, secondary genetic manipulation of tumor cells in the Flp
  lineage can be achieved by a FSF-silenced latent CreERT2 allele (FSF-R26CAG-CreERT2).
  CreERT2 can be activated by tamoxifen treatment at any time point during tumor formation
  and progression to recombine floxed sequences. In this way it is possible to model
  and analyze multistep carcinogenesis, manipulate tumor subpopulations, validate
  therapeutic targets in established tumors and analyze resistance mechanisms by genetic
  approaches. The use of various Flp driver lines or a Flp-expressing virus allows
  expression of oncogenic KrasG12D or any other Flp-FRT-regulated oncogene or tumor
  suppressor in various different tissue and cell types. Left, use of a CreERT2 deleter
  allele, which is expressed from the Rosa26 locus under the control of the CAG promoter
  in all cells of the body, allows whole-organism, time-specific deletion of a target
  or pathway, making it possible to mimic drug treatment and thus evaluate its value
  as a drug target for therapy of established PDAC. Right, Cre driver lines and expression
  models can be used to target subpopulations of the tumor microenvironment, such
  as fibroblasts (orange), stellate cells (yellow), endothelial cells, pericytes,
  adipocytes and mast cells (blue), as well as other immune cells. In addition, metastasis
  target organs and the metastatic niche and other host factors, tissues and cells
  can be genetically manipulated.
