caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of 6MSA and bostrycoidin. (A) 6MSA is synthesized by
  the PKS 6-MSA synthase (6-MSAS) from one acetyl-CoA and three malonyl-CoA units.
  (B) Bostrycoidin is synthesized from one acetyl-CoA and six malonyl-CoA units. The
  PKS FSR1 assembles the units into 6-O-demethylfusarubinaldehyde, and following the
  release of this intermediary product, incorporation of ammonia (non-enzymatically),
  oxygenation, and o-methylation by FSR3 and FSR2, respectively, yield bostrycoidin.
  Domain names: SAT, starter acyl transferase; KS, ketosynthase; AT, acyl transferase;
  PT, product template; ACP, acyl-carrier protein; TH, thioesterase; KR, ketoreductase;
  R, reduction domain for product release'
