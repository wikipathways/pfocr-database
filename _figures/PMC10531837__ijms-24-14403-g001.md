caption: Melanin production. (1) The production of melanin, a process called melanogenesis,
  is activated upon UV exposure. (2) UV radiation damages the DNA in the keratinocytes,
  activating the TP53 pathway, which results in the production of αMSH. αMSH is secreted
  from the keratinocytes and binds to the MC1R on the melanocyte. (3) cAMP levels
  are then increased within the melanocytes, activating protein kinase A (PKA). PKA
  activation induces the recruitment of CRE-binding (CREB) protein and thereby the
  transcriptional activity of MITF. (4) MITF activates the transcription of pigment
  genes, including TYR, TYRP1, DCT, and PMEL, which are transported to the membrane-bound
  melanosome. (5) Matured melanosomes are then transferred from melanocytes to keratinocytes
  to protect them against UV light. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 19 September
