caption: 'Activation of p38 MAPK in senescent CD4+CD28− T lymphocytes and its potential
  to drive a Th17-type SASP. Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38
  MAPK) in non-senescent CD4+ T lymphocytes can respond to two signaling pathways:
  classical and alternative. The classical signaling pathway can be activated by cytokines
  or by engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) and the costimulatory molecule CD28
  and depends on an upstream kinase cascade that relies on mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase (MAPKK) activation. In contrast, the alternative signaling pathway
  is activated by TCR engagement and depends on zeta chain-associated protein kinase
  70 (ZAP70). However, senescent CD4+CD28− T lymphocytes lack MAPKK and ZAP70 but
  show constitutive p38 activation, which responds to an intracellular sensory mechanism
  in response to DNA damage and is dependent on the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-Tab1
  and sestrin-MAPK activation complex (sMAC). It has been observed that p38 MAPK is
  able to inhibit autophagy and lead to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria,
  with the consequent increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In CD4+ T lymphocytes
  of elderly individuals, it has been shown that this process leads to the activation
  of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, responsible for
  the production of a Th17 profile of cytokines.'
