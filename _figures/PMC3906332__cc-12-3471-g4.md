caption: 'Figure 4. Reprogramming of non-genomic estrogen signaling by SOX2: A new
  driver of breast cancer stem-like cellular states with tumor-initiating capacity.
  SOX2 overexpression confers a tumor-initiating advantage to ERα-positive MCF-7 breast
  cancer cells in an estrogen-dependent manner, i.e. when s.c. injected into ovariectomized
  nude mice implanted with estrogen pellets, SOX2-overexpressing MCF-7/Rep cells formed
  more and larger tumors than MCF-7 parental cells, which mostly failed to produce
  tumor outgrowths in the absence of Matrigel. The previously unrecognized ability
  of the stemness factor SOX2 to promote estrogen-dependent tumorigenesis of ERα-positive
  breast cancer cells appears to depend on the activation of non-genomic estrogen
  signaling. E2 activates nuclear ERα (genomic pathway) and ERα in or near the membrane
  (non-genomic pathway). Membrane-associated ERα associates with growth factor signaling
  components (e.g., EGFR/HER2, INSR, IGF-1R), thus allowing E2 to activate the growth
  factor signaling by activating key molecules such as PI3K or Ras and downstream
  molecules such as AKT, mTOR, MEK, and MAPK. The crosstalk between the non-genomic
  estrogen signaling and the growth factor signaling is bidirectional, because a variety
  of kinases including MAPKs, AKT, and mTOR coordinately regulate the phosphorylation
  of specific sites of the ERα, leading to ligand (E2)-independent ERα activation.
  Moreover, phosphorylation of ERα co-regulatory proteins by growth factor kinases
  regulates the ERα signaling pathway to enhance the nuclear genomic ERα-mediated
  response. Our findings strongly suggest that reprogramming of non-genomic estrogen
  signaling by the stemness factor SOX2 is a key molecular feature that determines
  the tumor-initiating capacity of breast cancer stem-like cellular states.'
