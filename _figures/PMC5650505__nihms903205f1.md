caption: 'Folate one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) and methionine cycle (Met cycle) is
  a major metabolic pathway involving many biomolecules involved in multiple metabolic
  pathways vital to cell survival, cell growth and proliferation, and cell differentiation.
  The participating biomolecules include different forms of folates, B-vitamins, betaine,
  choline, serine, glycine, threonine, and methionine for FOCM/Met metabolism, and
  glucose to genearate energy for the metabolic processes. Biomolecules breaking down
  from food by maternal digestive enzymes will be absorbed by maternal enterocytes.
  Absorbed biomolecules will be transported into maternal circulation to supply maternal
  cells and organs and also to the developing embryo via the placenta during pregnancy.
  FOCM biomolecules transported into cells will be utilized by the FOCM/Met cycle
  enzymes producing important substrates for the downstream network of metabolic pathways
  including purine and pyrimidine synthesis, glycine cleavage, NADPH/NADP synthesis,
  peroxides transsulfuration, protein synthesis, phospholipid synthesis, and transmethylation
  of DNA, RNA and protein. Ser – serine, Gly – glycine, Thr –threonine, Met – methionine,
  Hcy – homocysteine, SAM – S-adenosyl-methionine, THF –tetrahydrofolate, fTHF– formyl-THF,
  CH2THF – methylene-THF, CH3THF- methyl-THF. B-vitamins: B2- riboflavin, B6 - pyridoxine,
  B9 – folic acid or THF, B12 – cobalamins, PE - phosphatidylethanolamine, PS - phosphatidylserine,
  PC - phosphatidylcholine.'
