caption: Figure 1. An illustration of the VanA resistance mechanism as it relates
  to normal cell wall synthesis. The top pathway denotes normal cell wall synthesis,
  and the mechanisms by which VanX and VanY disrupt this pathway. The shaded pathway
  denotes construction of a modified cell wall that is resistant to vancomycin. Adapted
  from Gold et al.
