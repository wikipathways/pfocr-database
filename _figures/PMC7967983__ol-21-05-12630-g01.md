caption: Glycolysis in tumor and tumor microenvironment is associated with immunotherapy
  resistance. STAT1 mediates tumor resistance to immunotherapy in the tumor microenvironment.
  Interferon regulates PD-L1 expression via the JAK1/JAK2-STAT1/STAT2/STAT3-IRF1 axis
  in tumor cells. STAT1 increases the expression of genes associated with glycolysis
  and oxidative phosphorylation. Wnt ligand inhibits mitochondrial function via the
  Wnt-β-catenin target gene, c-myc. However, PTEN loss can induce abnormal accumulation
  of β-catenin, and subsequently activate the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway. AKT
  also plays key roles in regulating immunotherapy resistance by decreasing PGC1α
  expression in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and upregulating membrane localization
  of GLUT1. During the lactate producing process, PTEN-loss acts as an activator in
  tumor cells, and increased lactate induces an extracellular acid environment that
  inhibits MCT-1, which disturbs the metabolism in T-cells. STAT, signal transducer
  and activators of transcription; PD-L1, programmed cell death-ligand 1; PGC1α, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α; GLUT, glucose and glucose
  transporters; MCT, monocarboxylic transporters; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  IRF1, interferon regulatory factor 1.
