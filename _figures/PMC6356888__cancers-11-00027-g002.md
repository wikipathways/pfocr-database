caption: TRPML1-3 and TPC1-2 in the endocytic pathway. Endosomal vesicles undergo
  cargo-dependent maturation (black arrows), membrane fusion (white arrows), and fission/budding
  (red arrow). The molecular identity of each intracellular compartment is defined
  by specific recruitment of small G proteins (Rab and Arf GTPases) and the composition
  of phosphoinositides (PIPs). Endolysosomal compartments are featured by a weak-to-highly
  acidic pH, which has therefore been indicated for each organelle. Many steps of
  the endocytic pathway are Ca2+-dependent due to the involvement of specific Ca2+-dependent
  decoders, such as calmodulin (CaM) and synaptotagmin VII (Syt), and Arf6. All the
  abbreviations are indicated on the left, with the exception of TGN (Trans Golgi
  Network).
