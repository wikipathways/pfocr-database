caption: MLCK signaling in endothelial hyperpermeability. MLCK activity is increased
  by multiple signaling pathways in response to inflammatory mediators, downstream
  of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activation. Activation of phospholipase C (PLC)
  leads to hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). IP3 triggers intracellular Ca++ release from
  intracellular stores (endoplasmic reticulum (ER)) via activation of the IP3 receptor.
  Stores Ca++ release activates MLCK directly through Ca++ binding to calmodulin (CaM).
  DAG and Ca++ together activate PKC-α and other classical PKC isoforms. PKC-α activates
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (inhibited by PKC-ζ mediated phosphorylation
  at T497) by phosphorylation at S1179, to increase nitric oxide (NO) production.
  NO activates many signaling processes, including NO combines with reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−); NO causes S-nitrosylation of numerous
  proteins; NO impairs function of complex IV of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
  system causing release of sequestered Ca++; and NO activates guanylate cyclase (GC)
  to increase conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into cyclic guanosine monophosphate
  (cGMP). cGMP can increase or decrease endothelial permeability through various mechanisms
  depending upon the cell type examined. cGMP activates MLCK through activation of
  PKG, which may be mediated through activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. cGMP may
  also modulate phosphodiesterase activity to increase or decrease abundance of cAMP
  and correspondingly affect PKA activity.
