caption: 'The lactate metabolism pathway and the regulatory mechanisms of lactylation
  are illustrated as shown. Lactylation modification targets include both histones
  and non-histones, and it is accomplished through two pathways: enzyme-catalyzed
  and non-enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The first pathway: l-lactate which is transported
  into the cell through MCT or synthesized from pyruvate is the primary substrate
  for enzyme-catalyzed lactylation. The catalytic process of lactylation by the writer
  requires the synthesis of lactyl-CoA, while AARS1 uses lactyl-AMP as an intermediate.
  The balance of lactylation modification is ultimately regulated by erasers and readers,
  with the former removing lactylation marks and the latter influencing the addition
  of lactyl groups. The second pathway: non-enzyme-catalyzed lactylation refers to
  the spontaneous interaction between lactoylglutathione and lysine residues, mainly
  regulated by GLO1 and GLO2. The substrate, lactoylglutathione, is derived from a
  specific metabolic pathway from glycolysis'
