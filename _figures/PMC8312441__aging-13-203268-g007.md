caption: 'Protein-protein interaction network of CDH23 and its target proteins (GeneMANIA).
  (A) Protein-protein interaction network of CDH23. The gene set enriched in the target
  network of CDH23 was explored via Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and
  functional analysis. Distinct colors of the network edge indicate the bioinformatic
  methods applied: physical interactions, co-expression, predicted, co-localization,
  pathway, genetic interactions and shared protein domains. The distinct colors for
  the network nodes show the biological functions of the sets of enrichment genes,
  including cell-cell adhesion, adherens junction organization, microvillus, neuromuscular
  process, sensory perception of sound and photoreceptor cell maintenance. (B) Protein-protein
  interaction network of CDH23 target proteins, including CDK1, CDK2, E2F1 and E2F4.
  Distinct colors of the network edge indicate the bioinformatic methods applied:
  physical interactions, co-expression, predicted, co-localization, pathway, genetic
  interactions and shared protein domains. The distinct colors for the network nodes
  show the biological functions of the sets of enrichment genes, including cell cycle
  checkpoint, regulation of cell cycle phase transition, DNA damage checkpoint, DNA
  integrity checkpoint, response to transforming growth factor beta, Ras protein signal
  transduction and nucleus organization.'
