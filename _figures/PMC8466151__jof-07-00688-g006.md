caption: Putative model of virulence inhibition in C. albicans by Molecule B and Molecule
  C. The inhibitory effects of Molecule B and Molecule C on upstream activator signaling
  proteins are shown. Molecule B and Molecule C inhibit Ras1 and affect the PAK kinase
  Cst20, thus affecting the Cek1 MAP kinase cascade, resulting in a decrease in the
  levels of the transcription factor Cph1. The level of Ume6, which is regulated by
  the signal of Cph1, also decreases as the amount of Nrg1 increases.
