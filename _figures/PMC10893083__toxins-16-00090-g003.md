caption: 'Mode of action of bioactive microbial compounds that modulate Fusarium mycotoxin
  production. Plant microbiomes contain beneficial or pathogenic microorganisms that
  produce compounds to modulate mycotoxin production by Fusarium. The wheat head microbiome
  bacterium Pseudomonas piscium (strain ZJU60) interacts with Fusarium graminearum
  [61]. P. piscium secretes phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN) that enters Fusarium cells
  and inhibits the histone acetyltransferase activity of FgGcn5, likely through direct
  binding. Subsequently, histone acetylation is deregulated, leading to transcriptional
  suppression of the trichothecene biosynthesis gene FgTri1, disruption of the DON
  biosynthesis toxisome and reduced production of DON [61]. It is possible that other
  genes in the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway were also deregulated, as these
  genes are activated by Gcn5-dependent histone acetylation under DON-inducing growth
  conditions [6]. When P. piscium is co-cultivated with Fusarium, PCN production is
  increased, suggesting that this fungal–bacterial interaction stimulates PCN production
  [61]. Interestingly, PCN biosynthesis by Pseudomonas species has been reported to
  be repressed by Fusarium mycotoxin fusaric acid in another Pseudomonas (P. chlororaphis)
  [60]. F. graminearum and the seed-borne bacterial pathogen Burkholderia glumae interact
  cooperatively to promote their dispersal and disease progression on rice plants
  [64]. Toxoflavin is produced by B. glumae during this interaction, and it increases
  the expression of genes in the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway and DON production.
  Recently, fungal VOCs have been shown to inhibit the expression of trichothecene
  biosynthesis genes and mycotoxin production [39,63], but their identities and their
  exact molecular effects remain to be determined. Lines represent known direct/indirect
  positive effect or positive activation (solid lines) and hypothetical activation
  of downstream components (dashed lines). Red downward arrows represent an activity
