caption: The interplay between resveratrol and PI3K signaling pathway in multiple
  human neoplasms. Resveratrol, a natural compound found in grapes, inhibits the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway in cancer cells and provides multiple protective effects across
  various organs—it acts as a cardiovascular protector in the heart, prevents Alzheimer’s
  in the brain, inhibits oral cancer cells in the mouth, prevents liver cancer by
  reducing inflammatory markers in the liver, enhances UVB-induced cell death in the
  skin, modulates hormone signaling to prevent prostate cancer in sexual organs, reduces
  oxidative damage in the stomach, induces colorectal cancer cell death in the intestine,
  prevents ROS-related cancer in the kidneys, decreases inflammation and oxidative
  stress in the lungs, and blocks estrogen toxicity to help prevent breast cancer
