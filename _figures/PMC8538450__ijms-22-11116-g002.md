caption: The regulatory pathway of anthocyanin biosynthesis in plants. NAC, WRKY,
  MADS-box can interact with MYB to form BMW complex and positively regulate the expression
  of anthocyanin synthetic genes. In the regulatory pathway, the expression of NAC,
  MYB is regulated by HY5, NAC, and WRKY, and the expression of WRKY is also regulated
  by HY5. However, some negative regulators such as VvMYBC2-L1, AtMYB4, FaMYB1 belonging
  to R2R3-MYBs, SlTRY, SlMYBATV, AtCPC, and AtMYBL2 belonging to R3-MYBs interact
  with bHLH to compete with MYB and disturb the MBW complex. Another negative regulator
  SPL can also interact with bHLH to affect MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex. The transcription
  factor HY5 and MBW complex which consists of different MYB proteins such as SlAN2
  and SlAN2-like and bHLH proteins such as SlAN1 and SlJAF13 in tomato can bind to
  the promoters of different anthocyanin synthetic genes to activate their transcription
  and accumulate anthocyanin in specific vegetative tissue or fruits.
