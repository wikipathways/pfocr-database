caption: '(A) Under normal physiological conditions (left panel), Yki shuttles between
  the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to phosphorylation (P) by Wts, which targets
  Yki to cytosolic tethers. Wing disc intrinsic signals (e.g., the morphogens Dpp
  and Wg) drive wing growth by down-regulating Wts activity, allowing a small proportion
  of Yki to escape phosphorylation-dependent tethering, enter the nucleus, and bind
  to its growth-promoting target genes in complex with Sd. Inhibiting the InR/TOR
  pathway results in up-regulation or activation of a putative NSF that sequesters
  unphosphorylated Yki in the nucleus and impedes binding of the Yki-Sd complex to
  its target genes, reducing Yki-Sd dependent growth. (B) Proposed integration of
  InR/TOR and Wts/Yki signaling to scale wing growth. In well-fed animals (left panel),
  TOR activation by wing disc extrinsic, nutrient-dependent signals facilitates Yki-dependent
  tissue growth by two parallel means: (i) by inhibiting NSF and thereby potentiating
  Yki nuclear access and target gene expression, and (ii), by up-regulating cell physiological
  functions such as dS6-Kinase and possibly many others, to match growth potential
  to the level of Yki target gene activity. Reductions in InR/TOR activity diminish
  both outputs, leading to reduced cell proliferation and tissue growth. (C) Excess
  growth caused by superphysiological activation of TOR is offset by Yki-independent
  down-regulation of the antiapoptotic factors DIAP1 and bantam, promoting cell death
  and safeguarding the developing wing against hyperplasia.'
