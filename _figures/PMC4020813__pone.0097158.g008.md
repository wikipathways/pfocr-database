caption: The drug discovery of high-throughput screening is monitored by activation
  of the calcium-sensitive photoprotein light production. Ligand-mediated activation
  of Gs-coupled receptors stimulates cAMP synthesis by adenylyl cyclase (AC) and opening
  of the cAMP-gated heteromultimeric cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel. Calcium
  ions from the extracellular solution enter the cell through the CNG channel and
  are detected by photoprotein luminescence measurements. Gq-coupled receptor activation
  stimulates the phospholipase C (PLC)/IP3 pathway detected via photoprotein luminescence
  stimulated by calcium released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
