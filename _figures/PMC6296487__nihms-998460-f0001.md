caption: In the absence of BR, several negative regulators (BKI1 and BIK1) act to
  inhibit BR signaling at BRI1/BAK1 receptors, and BIN2 phosphorylates BES1/BZR1 family
  transcription factors to inhibit their function through several mechanisms. BIN2
  also phosphorylates other transcription factors such as PIF4, MYBL2 and HAT1 to
  regulate their activities. Without BR signaling, expression of BR-induced genes
  is relatively low, whereas BR-repressed genes are more highly expressed, leading
  to suppressed BR responses. When present, BRs bind to receptor BRI1 and co-receptor
  BAK1, which leads to the disassociation of BKI1 and BIK1 as well as phosphorylation
  and activation of BRI1/BAK1, which activates BSK1, CDG1 and BSU1. BSU1 then functions
  to inhibit BIN2 kinase function while KIB1 ubiquitinates BIN2. PP2A activates BES1/BZR1
  by dephosphorylation and cytoplasmic BKI1 sequesters 14–3-3s that otherwise sequester
  BES1/BZR1 in the cytoplasm. These events lead to accumulation of dephosphorylated
  BES1/BZR1 in the nucleus. BES1/BZR1 binds to E-box elements and interacts with cofactors
  (such as histone-modifying enzymes REF6 and SDG8 and transcription elongation factor
  IWS1) and BR-related transcription factors (BR-TFs, such as PIF4 and BIM1) to activate
  BR-induced gene expression. On the other hand, BES1/BZR1 binds to BRRE sites and
  interacts with co-repressors (TPL and MYBL2), histone deacetylase (HDAC) and likely
  other BR-TFs to inhibit BR-repressed genes. The large number of BR-regulated genes
  (~5000) enables cell elongation and other BR-regulated processes.
