caption: Proposed Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway. Nrf2 is expressed  constitutively in
  the cell and translocates directly to the nucleus following  its synthesis. Following
  transactivation of its genes, Nrf2 is targeted for  degradation by Keap1 in the
  nucleus, a process that requires the transient  shuttling of Keap1 into this compartment.
  In cells under stress, stabilization  of Nrf2 is thought to be dependent on mechanisms
  that either prevent or reduce  access of Keap1 to Nrf2. This figure was reproduced
  from Ref.  .
