caption: Metabolic pathway of fungal saccharides and changes in differential metabolites
  in P. ostreatus under heat stress. The differential substances are shown in bold
  letters. The change in metabolites with temperature is represented by a line chart
  (average), in which the 28째C group is represented by a solid black line with black
  dots, and the 40째C group is represented by a red dotted line with black squares;
  the dots or squares indicate 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 48 + 6 h. The same scheme is
  used below.
