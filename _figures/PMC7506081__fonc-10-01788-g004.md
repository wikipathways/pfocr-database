caption: In tumor cells, the glucose uptake is significantly increased. SREBPs can
  promote glycogen production and accelerate glycolysis by activating the PFKFB. glycolysis
  leads to the massive production of pyruvate. Pyruvate can be converted into lactic
  acid and also participates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The tricarboxylic acid
  cycle produces citrate, which can be used as raw materials for lipid synthesis and
  cholesterol synthesis. Citrate transports mitochondria into the cytoplasm through
  SLC25A1. In tumors, activated SREBPs can promote the activity of multiple fatty
  acid synthases and accelerate the formation of fatty acids. Excess fatty acids can
  be converted into LDs and phospholipids. On the one hand, it is used for the proliferation
  of tumor cells and on the other hand to avoid lipotoxicity. SREBPs promote cholesterol
  absorption by activating LDLR, and mir-33, which is co-transcribed with SREBPs,
  can also inhibit the gene expression of transporters, thereby inhibiting cholesterol
  efflux. Natural drugs ultimately inhibit the activity of SREBPs through a variety
  of ways, including inhibiting gene transcription, reducing the transport of SREBPs,
  and reducing the maturation of SREBPs protein.

  description: In tumor cells, the glucose uptake is significantly increased. SREBPs
    can promote glycogen production and accelerate glycolysis by activating the PFKFB.
    glycolysis leads to the massive production of pyruvate. Pyruvate can be converted
    into lactic acid and also participates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The tricarboxylic
    acid cycle produces citrate, which can be used as raw materials for lipid synthesis
    and cholesterol synthesis. Citrate transports mitochondria into the cytoplasm
    through SLC25A1. In tumors, activated SREBPs can promote the activity of multiple
    fatty acid synthases and accelerate the formation of fatty acids. Excess fatty
    acids can be converted into LDs and phospholipids. On the one hand, it is used
    for the proliferation of tumor cells and on the other hand to avoid lipotoxicity.
    SREBPs promote cholesterol absorption by activating LDLR, and mir-33, which is
    co-transcribed with SREBPs, can also inhibit the gene expression of transporters,
    thereby inhibiting cholesterol efflux. Natural drugs ultimately inhibit the activity
    of SREBPs through a variety of ways, including inhibiting gene transcription,
    reducing the transport of SREBPs, and reducing the maturation of SREBPs protein.
