caption: Proposed mechanisms for mTOR signalling in the heart, mediated by α1‐ and
  β‐adrenoceptors. Activation of α1‐adrenoceptors (α1‐AR) results in increased levels
  of cytosolic Ca2+ through a classical pathway involving Gαq/11, PLC, phosphatidylinositol
  bisphosphate (PIP2), and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). Release of intracellular
  Ca2+ activates CaMKK and AMPK pathways. α1‐Adrenoceptors also activate mTORC2 via
  unknown mechanisms. AMPK and mTORC2 both play significant roles in GLUT4 translocation
  to the plasma membrane, resulting in increased glucose uptake. α1‐Adrenoceptors
  promote mTORC1 activation via diacyl glycerol (DAG), PKCδ, and Erk1/2, leading to
  increased activation of S6rp and 4EBP1, which promote protein translation. β1‐ and
  β2‐adrenoceptors (β1‐ AR, β2‐AR) both couple to Gαs, whereas β2‐adrenoceptors switch
  coupling to Gαi/o in pathological states such as heart failure. Overstimulation
  of β1‐adrenoceptors increases Ca2+ mobilization and mTORC1 activation leading to
  increased protein synthesis and inhibition of autophagy, resulting in apoptosis,
  fibrosis, and hypertrophy. In the later stages of heart failure, GRK2 overexpression
  results in adrenoceptor phosphorylation and interaction with β‐arrestin, thereby
  promoting receptor internalization. Activation of the β2‐adrenoceptor–Gαi/opathway
  inhibits cAMP production and counteracts the pro‐apoptotic effects of excessive
  β1‐ adrenoceptor stimulation. The β2‐adrenoceptors stimulate glucose uptake through
  mTORC2‐Akt activation
