caption: Summary of the potential treatments tested so far in EDMD. Schematic drawing
  representing several treatment strategies that have been developed for EDMD. The
  portrayed treatments target diverse mechanisms occurring either in the cytoplasm,
  e.g., autophagy in the lysosomes, or in the nucleus, including exon-skipping or
  trans-splicing strategies. The treatment strategies addressed to EDMD have generally
  been developed to target MAPK signaling pathway or to induce autophagy and these
  include different inhibitors of components of these pathways such as selumetinib
  or temsirolimus. To target apoptosis, the utilization of shRNA specific to Fox O1
  and 3 has been developed. Others treatments and strategies such as the use of paclitaxel
  to stabilize microtubules or gene therapy to convert the mutant transcript into
  a normal transcript or remove an in-frame exon containing a mutation have been studied.
