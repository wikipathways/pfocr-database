caption: The question marks indicate that it remains to be determined how nascent
  Rpl3 or Rpl4 are recognized by the regulatory machinery and how this leads to the
  degradation, presumably involving a component of the Ccr4-Not complex, of the RPL3
  or RPL4 mRNAs. Also included in the model and highlighted by an exclamation mark
  is the finding that surplus production of Rpl3 and/or Rpl4, for example, elicited
  by inactivation of the regulatory machinery, may lead to their aggregation when
  cells lack the E3 ubiquitin ligase Tom1, which is required for mediating the degradation
  of excess r-proteins by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) via the so-called
  ERISQ (excess ribosomal protein quality control) pathway. The α and β subunit of
  the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) are denoted as α and β, respectively.
