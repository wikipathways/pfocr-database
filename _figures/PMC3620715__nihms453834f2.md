caption: Networking and activation of a positive feedback loop by norepi-nephrine
  acting through the α1- and α2- adrenergic receptor pathways.When norepinephrine
  (NE) binds the α1 adrenergic receptor it activates the Gq pathway, leading to stimulation
  of the phospholipase C-β. This results in release of intracellular calcium and the
  activation of protein kinase C, which in turn can activate both Ras and Raf. When
  NE activates the α2-adrenergic receptor, which couples to the Gi/o pathway, release
  of Gβγ results in the activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Simultaneous activation
  of both pathways results in MAPK regulation of cytoplasmic phospholipase-A2 (cPLA2),
  which produces arachadonic acid (AA) that activates protein kinase C in the presence
  of basal levels of diacylglycerol (DAG). This sets up a positive feedback loop indicated
  by the circular arrow, resulting in sustained activation of MAP-kinase. Thus brief
  pulses of NE could lead to prolonged activation of MAP-kinase (MAPK) in cells where
  both α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors and other components of the network are present.
