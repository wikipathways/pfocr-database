caption: Frizzled (Fzd) Wnt receptors form ligand-dependent heterodimers with the
  LDL receptor related proteins LRP5 and LRP6 to convey canonical signals conveyed
  by nuclear β-catenin. Since GSK3 also inhibits Taz and mTOR, canonical Wnt activation
  is often associated with upregulation of these pathways. Inhibitory proteins of
  the sclerostin and Dickkopf (Dkk) families directly bind to LRP5/6. Other Wnt ligand-dependent
  Fzd receptor complexes signal via pathways that do not require LRPs and β-catenin;
  G proteins of the Rho/Rac/cdc42 and Gαq families, and intracellular calcium and
  cytoskeletal signals, utilize transcription factors of the NFAT, USF, and Jun/AP1
  to convey these noncanonical signals. Dishevelled (Dvl) platform proteins contribute
  to both canonical and noncanonical programs. The ROR/Ryk family of receptor tyrosine
  kinases (TK) can signal within the Fzd cell polarity pathway or via 14-3-3 platform
  proteins. The secreted frizzled related proteins (SFRPs) bind Wnt ligands as faux
  (decoy) receptors, and inhibit both canonical and noncanonical signals. Green asterix,
  phosphorylation increased with Wnt signaling; yellow asterisk, phosphorylation decreased
  with Wnt signaling.
