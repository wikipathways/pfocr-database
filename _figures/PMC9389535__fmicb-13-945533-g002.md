caption: Through external intervention measures, such as the use of probiotics, prebiotics,
  polysaccharides, pectin, polyphenols, plant fibers, bacterial metabolites, drugs,
  and diet, the richness of intestinal flora is increased, intestinal immunity is
  regulated, the immune response of the body is enhanced, the secretion of anti-cancer
  cytokines is increased, and the colorectal mucosa is protected, thereby effectively
  intervening in CRC. (A) Gut microbiota produce substances such as PGE2, TGF-β, and
  TSLP to inhibit the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). Immature DCs give weak
  co-stimulatory signals and secrete cytokines such as RA and IL-10 to induce CD4T
  cells to differentiate into Treg cells. (B) Gut microbiota induces the formation
  of T cells, secretes INF-γ, and activates NK cells. After contacting the intestinal
  epithelium, it enhances the phagocytic activity of macrophages through the receptor
  pathway, promotes cytokines such as TNF and IL, stimulates the body’s immune response,
  and exerts an anti-tumor effect. (C) Intestinal pathogenic bacteria penetrate the
  intestinal epithelium to activate DCs. The activated DCs express strong costimulatory
  ligands and induce CD4T cells to differentiate into effective TH1 and TH17 cells.
