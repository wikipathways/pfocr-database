caption: (A) Ligand binding and tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases
  (blue ball in green cup/stick), such as EGFR, leads to RAS activation at the plasma
  membrane via adaptor and RAS-GEF proteins (green arrows). GTP-loaded RAS signals
  through downstream effectors including the RAF–MEK–ERK kinase cascade and the RIN1–RAB5
  activation pathway. Active GTP-bound RAB5 recruits its own effectors including RABEP
  (rabaptin-5) with associated RABGEF1. The ZnF-A20 domain of RABGEF1 directs the
  addition of ubiquitin (Ub) to RAS. (B) Endosomes carrying RTKs include ubiquitinated
  RAS, which becomes uncoupled from the RAF–MEK–ERK pathway but may continue to signal
  through other effectors. RABGEF1 is retained on endosomes, where it maintains high
  levels of active RAB5 to promote endosome trafficking and fusion.
