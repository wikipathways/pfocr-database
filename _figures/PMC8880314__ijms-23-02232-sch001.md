caption: Impact of high-fat diet (HFD) and 2-week cannabidiol (CBD) administration
  on the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in rat’s cardiomyocytes. ↑, an increase; ↓,
  a decrease; red arrows represent high-fat feeding for 7 weeks; green arrows represent
  the effects of 2-week CBD treatment (the last two weeks of high-fat diet regime);

  acid transport protein 6 (FATP6), serine palmitoyltransferase, long chain base subunit
