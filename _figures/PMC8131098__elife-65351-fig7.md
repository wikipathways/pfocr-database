caption: NO and copper resistance is mediated by cell surface and cytoplasmic convergent
  signals that inactivate PdtaS/PdtaR. In basal conditions, PdtaS/R is constitutively
  active, and that activity holds virulence genes, including chalkophore biosynthesis,
  inactive. NO or copper directly inhibit PdtaS activity through direct sensing by
  PdtaS N-terminal GAF domain. NO shutoff of PdtaS kinase activity requires C53 and
  57, whereas Cu shutoff requires C53 with the role of C57 unknown. Sensing of NO
  at the cell surface contributes a second signal to relief of PdtaS/R by inducing
  Rip1-dependent expression of a hairpin containing small RNA at the 5′ end of the
  PPE1 gene (PPE1-5′), which binds directly to the ANTAR domain containing PdtaR.
  These signals relieve PdtaS/R repression of virulence gene expression, including
  chalkophore biosynthesis, to activate NO resistance. Although our data clearly implicates
  the upstream Rip1/PdtaS/PdtaR cascade in Cu resistance, the downstream targets that
  mediate Cu resistance are not known (indicated by ?). Despite the high Cu affinity
  of the isonitriles produced by the nrp locus, these molecules are involved in the
  NO resistance arm of the pathway rather than Cu. Figure constructed with BioRender.
