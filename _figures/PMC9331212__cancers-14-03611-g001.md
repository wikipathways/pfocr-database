caption: Targeting dysregulation of Cyclin D–CDK4/6 axis by CDK4/6 inhibition. Cyclin
  D-CDK4/6-mediated RB phosphorylation occurs upon activation of Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex
  in response to extracellular signals such as stimulatory mitogens, leading to ensuing
  cell cycle progression. Initially, upon Cyclin D-CDK4/6-mediated RB phosphorylation,
  RB affinity to E2F is reduced, promoting transcription of genes such as Cyclin E2.
  Subsequently, the Cyclin E2-CDK2 complex hyperphosphorylates RB, which induces full
  dissociation of the RB-E2F complex and transcription of genes encoding proteins
  playing critical roles in the next phases of the cell cycle. The p16INK4A (p16)
  tumor suppressor encoded by CDKN2A directly binds to CDK4/6 and inhibits the formation
  of the Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex and prevents Cyclin D-CDK4/6-mediated RB phosphorylation.
  A dysregulated Cyclin D–CDK4/6 axis, which leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation,
  can be inhibited by CDK4/6 inhibitors. Chronic inhibition of CDK4/6 can trigger
  the upregulation of PI3K and MAPK pathways to compensate for inhibitory effects
  of CDK4/6 inhibitors on cell cycle progression by activation of D type cyclins.
  Dual inhibition of CDK4/6 and PI3K/mTOR or MEK may be an efficient combination treatment
  to prevent the compensatory effect of the PI3K or MAPK pathways on the development
  of CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance.

    Cyclin D-CDK4/6-mediated RB phosphorylation occurs upon activation of Cyclin D-CDK4/6
