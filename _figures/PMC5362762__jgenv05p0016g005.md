caption: 'Top regulated Pathway Maps and Network processes. Small RNA-seq data from
  the tumor and metastasis cancer samples were entered into MetaCore and top regulated
  pathways and network processes were presented. A to E: Regulation of miRNAs in Colorectal
  Cancer: Top five highest scored pathway maps linked to colorectal cancers with involved
  in migration and angiogenesis. Upward thermometers have red color and indicate up‑regulated
  signals and downward (blue) ones indicate downregulated expression levels of the
  genes. F-H: Generation of biological networks using comparison Analyze Networks
  (cAN) algorithm common in both Colorectal Cancer groups: Comparison of the disease
  group enrichment analysis revealed three commonly affected pathways in both groups.
  I-K: Generation of biological networks using Analyze Networks (AN) algorithm in
  metastasis Colorectal Cancer group only: This is a variant of the shortest paths
  algorithm with main parameters of enrichment with enriched miRNAs prioritized based
  on the number of fragments of canonical pathways in the networks. Up‑regulated genes
  are marked with red circles; downregulated with blue circles. The ''checkerboard''
  color indicates mixed expression of the gene between files or between multiple tags
  for the same gene.'
