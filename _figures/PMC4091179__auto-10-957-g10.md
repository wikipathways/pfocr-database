caption: Figure 10. Conceptual schematic of 3BDO and FLJ11812 mechanism of action.
  3BDO can occupy the rapamycin-binding site, blocks the interaction of rapamycin
  and FKBP1A, and activates the MTOR signaling pathway and subsequent TIA1 phosphorylation.
  TIA1 phosphorylation and the reduced interaction between the 3′ UTR of TGFB2 and
  TIA1 by 3BDO might affect the production of an lncRNA, FLJ11812. FLJ11812, with
  decoy activity for MIR4459 and by sequestering MIR4459, regulates the level of MIR4459
  target, ATG13, and autophagy.
