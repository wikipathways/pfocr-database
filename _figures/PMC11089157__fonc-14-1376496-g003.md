caption: Transcriptional regulation of FOXK2. FOXK2 is regulated at transcriptional
  level by multiple mechanisms. Several miRNAs, including miR-140-3P, miR-1271-6P,
  miR-204, miR-30a-3p, miR-602, miR-148a-3p52, and miR-93-5p51 exert inhibitory effects
  on FOXK2 transcription. However, circRNAs such as circHIPK3, circITCH, and circUBAP2
  act as miRNA sponges, relieving their inhibitory effects on FOXK2. Conversely, transcriptional
  activation of FOXK2 can be facilitated by SOX9 and EGF. EGF activates intracellular
  signaling pathways, including NF-kB pathway, ultimately leading to the activation
  of FOXK2 transcription through recognition of EGFR. Notably, the transcriptional
  regulation of FOXK2 can elicit both promotive and suppressive impacts on cellular
  proliferation
