caption: 'Schematic depiction of the mTOR signaling network. (A) The most important
  upstream signals of mTOR signaling are cellular stress, growth factors, and amino
  acids for the mTORC1 complex, and the insulin/PI3K pathway for mTORC2. Genes of
  special interest for NGS, due to their mutation frequency, are shown with a red
  border. No prominent pattern of a section specifically affected by these mutations
  is obvious. To the best of our best knowledge, no companion diagnostic between a
  specific mutation and treatment is currently applicable. However, a variety of inhibitors
  (green) affecting the network at different points are known: Inhibitors affecting
  AKT, mTORC1/mTORC2, PI3K, PI3K/mTOR, and mTORC1 inhibitors like rapamycin and rapalogs
  [,]; and (B) the widespread downstream network of mTORC1 and mTORC2 is shown. mTORC1
  is involved both in supporting anabolic processes via influencing nucleotide, lipid
  and protein synthesis, as well as suppressing catabolic processes, mainly autophagy.
  mTORC2, under the coregulation of AKT, is known to mainly affect cell survival,
  proliferation and growth, and the specifically the regulation of the cytoskeleton.'
