caption: Catalytic cycle of bovine heart CcO and X-ray structure of the active sites.
  A, schematic representation of the catalytic cycle of CcO; Fea3 and CuB are the
  iron and copper ions in the O2-reduction site; Tyr–OH and Tyr–O• denote Tyr244 located
  in the O2-reduction site in its protonated and neutral radical states, respectively;
  the A-, P-, F-, O-, E- and R-forms are the six intermediate species in the catalytic
  cycle, and the oxidation and ligand-binding state are described in parentheses.
  The reaction steps coupled with proton pumping are indicated by straight arrows
  marked with H+. B, X-ray structure of the active sites. The large brown spheres
  are iron ions; the violet spheres are copper ions; the beige sphere is magnesium
  ions. The magenta stick models represent porphyrins of heme a and heme a3 as labeled.
  Within the stick models of the amino acid residues, dark blue portions are nitrogen;
  red portions are oxygen; and yellow portions are carbon. The proposed pathway for
  passage of electrons is indicated by a beige arrow, and those for protons producing
  water molecules are indicated by two black arrows. The hydrogen-bond network and
  the water channel of the H-pathway are indicated by the red and blue portions of
  the leftmost curved arrow, respectively. The hydrogen-bond network is connected
  with the Mg/H2O cluster (blue area) via a short hydrogen-bond network (gray area).
  The positions of water molecules in the Mg/H2O cluster are indicated by small blue
  spheres, and the other water molecule positions are indicated by small beige spheres.
  The formyl group and one of the propionate groups of heme a are hydrogen-bonded
  with Arg38 and a fixed water molecule in the hydrogen-bond network of the H-pathway.
  The locations of the redox-active metal sites and pathways for transportation of
  electrons and protons within the overall CcO structure, indicated by Cα-backbone
  traces, are shown in the inset. This figure was prepared from the X-ray diffraction
  data of PDB code 5B1A.
