caption: Cancer develops to some extent in a stepwise manner. Generally, oncogene
  activation and proliferative signals generate a pool of pre-malignant cells. Pre-malignant
  cells often activate p19 and are subject to DNA replication stress and DNA damage
  and therefore activation of the DNA damage response (DDR). The action of the DNA
  damage response, activated E2F and other pathways summarized in  can induce expression
  of NKG2D ligands. p19 activation and the DNA damage response activate the tumor
  suppressor p53, which imparts a potent barrier to transformation. Activated p53
  imparts cell cycle arrest and triggers the cellular senescence program (stream represented
  to the right in the figure). These events constitute an intrinsic tumor suppressor
  pathway, but senescent cells also mobilize a tumor surveillance pathway mediated
  by immune cells. In one example, CCL2 production induced by p53 acts to recruit
  NK cells into the tumors, whereas inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-15, also expressed
  in senescent cells, can enhance the activity of the recruited NK cells. Together
  these events enable NK cells to kill the senescent tumor cells via recognition of
  NKG2D ligands displayed on the tumor cell surfaces, and eliminate the potential
  for tumor advancement. In contrast, developing tumor cells with mutations in p53
  bypass these barriers and advance to malignancy (stream represented to the left
  in the figure). Although such tumor cells may express NKG2D ligands, the inadequate
  recruitment and activation of NK cells and other immune cells, coupled with the
  rapid growth of the tumor cells, result in failure to control the advancing tumors.
  Note that numerous other immune and nonimmune pathways regulated by p53, oncogenes
  and senescence also control tumor advancement, but the figure emphasizes the role
  of NK cells.
