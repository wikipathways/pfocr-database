caption: Hemp iron plays a role in muscle regeneration, lipid metabolism, and cholesterol
  management. Iron from hemp seeds that is coupled to transferrin and carried into
  the bloodstream raises BMP6 expression, which in turn triggers the BMP/SMAD signaling
  pathway, which ultimately triggers the transcription of hepcidin. Among the transferrin
  receptors, TFR1 and TFR2, which are coupled to iron, TFR2 regulates hepcidin by
  working with the HFE protein. This enhances cholesterol homeostasis, which further
  controls cholesterol levels and promotes the best possible muscle health and repair.
  At the same time, TFR 2 influences the enzymes involved in the manufacturing of
  cholesterol and controls the ideal amounts of iron (by author Avinash Kumar, 2025)
