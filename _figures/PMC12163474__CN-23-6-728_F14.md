caption: 'Possible mechanism of AP in the treatment of AD: inhibit BACE1 activity,
  reduce Aβ aggregation and deposition; inhibit GSK-3β to lower p-tau and reduce NFTs
  production; reduce glial cell activation, inhibit TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and
  reduce inflammatory factor release; improve mitochondrial dysfunction, activate
  NRF2 signaling pathway, increase antioxidant enzyme expression, reduce intracellular
  ROS levels and inhibit oxidative stress; increase Bcl2/Bax, downregulate apoptotic
  factors such as cytochrome C, Bax, caspase 9 and caspase 3 to exert anti-apoptotic
  effects; upregulate BDNF and its receptors TRKB and pCREB to restore the neurotrophic
  pathway ERK/CREB/BDNF; increase SYNI expression, inhibit glutamate release and promote
  synapse formation; inhibit HDAC activity and restores histone acetylation; inhibits
  AChE activity and increases cortical Ach levels; inhibits NO production and reduces
  nitrosylation'
