caption: Generalized schematic of the pathway of starch biosynthesis following granule
  initiation and hilum formation showing the major enzyme classes (in boxes) responsible
  for granule structure. ADP-Glc is the immediate soluble precursor for starch synthesis
  and is utilized by soluble SS isoforms which create extended α-(1,4) linear glucan
  chains in amylopectin by addition of Glc from ADP-Glc. ADP-Glc is also utilized
  by GBSSI for amylose synthesis, a process requiring MOS primers. MOS may arise from
  the activities of SP and DPE as well as DBEs during amylopectin trimming. Amylopectin
  arises through the combined actions of multiple isoforms of SS, SBEs (introduction
  of α-(1,6) branch linkages) and DBEs (removal of selected α-(1,6) branch linkages),
  with each enzyme class potentially using substrates and products of others. Typically
  starches contain approximately 75% amylopectin, although some of this material is
  made up of relatively long and sparsely branched α-(1,4)-linked chains (super-long
  chains) intermediate between amylose and amylopectin depicted as the area between
  the overlapping regions of amylose and amylopectin in the figure.
