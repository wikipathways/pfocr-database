caption: At initial stage (Stage One) of colonization, CarSR is activated by sensing
  HD-5 to promote the expression of tcpP and almE. At late stage (Stage Two) of infection,
  CarSR is inactivated due to the decreased HD-5 concentration, which lead to the
  repression of virulence genes expression.
