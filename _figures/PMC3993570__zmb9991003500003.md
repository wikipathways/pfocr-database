caption: ABL interactions with and modifications by ATM and Tip60 in DNA damage response.
  This model of ABL interactions and modifications is based on four reports (). Ionizing
  radiation (IR) or chromatin stress (CS) stimulates ABL interactions with ATM and
  Tip60. A PXXP motif in ATM binds the ABL-SH3 domain () and can thus disrupt the
  autoinhibitory assembly to activate the ABL kinase (step 1). IR also stimulates
  ABL interaction with Tip60 () and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Tip60 at Tyr44
  () in the N-terminal CHROMO domain (step 2) by ABL. Tyrosine phosphorylation (pY)
  of Tip60 stimulates its acetylation of ATM and the activation of ATM kinase () (step
  3). The activated ATM kinase in turn phosphorylates ABL at Ser465 (pS) () (step
  4). Ser465 phosphorylation is required for the acetylation of ABL at Lys921 by Tip60
  () (step 5). Because ABL knockout does not interfere with ATM activation, and because
  the loss of ABL does not cause radiosensitivity, which is the phenotype of ATM loss
  (), ABL is not an obligatory upstream activator of ATM. A simple linear pathway
  also cannot accommodate the findings that ATM loss causes radiosensitivity whereas
  ABL loss reduces the apoptosis response but does not cause radiosensitivity. Instead,
  these interactions are likely to be designed to alter the covalent modifications
  of ABL (S465 phosphorylation and K921 acetylation) in the DNA damage response.
