caption: In mammals, the main components of the Notch pathway include the 4 transmembrane
  Notch receptors (Notch1–4) and their cognate ligands, Delta-like (DLL) 1, -3, and
  -4, and Jagged1 and -2. Notch receptors expressed on the cell surface bind to the
  Delta and Jagged family of ligands on an adjacent cell, after which Notch undergoes
  a series of proteolytic cleavages. The first cleavage is mediated by either tumor-necrosis
  factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) or ADAM10, followed by a second cleavage mediated
  by the gamma-secretase complex. This final cleavage releases the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD) from the cell membrane, allowing this domain to translocate to the
  nucleus. Once in the nucleus, NICD binds to the transcription factor CSL, displacing
  corepressors and recruiting transcriptional activators, including the coactivator
  Mastermind-like1 (Maml). Gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) block the cleavage of
  Notch receptors by the gamma-secretase complex, inhibiting the release of NICD from
  the cell membrane.
