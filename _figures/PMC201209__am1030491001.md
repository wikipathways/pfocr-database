caption: Redox cofactors in the metabolic pathway for d-xylose fermentation. d-Xylose
  is converted to d-xylulose through an NADPH-utilizing reductase and NAD+-utilizing
  dehydrogenase. d-Xylulose is then phosphorylated to the pentose phosphate intermediate
  d-xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P). The products of the pentose phosphate pathway are
  fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and GAP. GAP is reduced through an NADP-GAPDH, encoded
  by GDP1, or by the endogenous NAD-GAPDH, depending on cofactor availability. In
  the following reactions involving an NADH requiring alcohol dehydrogenase, equimolar
  amounts of CO2 and ethanol are derived. A competing pathway for NADP+ is the oxidative
  part of the pentose phosphate pathway. Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is derived from
  fructose-6-phosphate and can enter the oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway
  through G6PDH, which is encoded by the ZWF1 gene. G6P is oxidized, thereby generating
  NADPH and CO2. The deletion of ZWF1 prevents this reaction.
