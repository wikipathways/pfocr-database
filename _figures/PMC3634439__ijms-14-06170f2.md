caption: Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1)/β-catenin upregulates StarD7 expression in
  JEG-3 cells. The proposed model shows SF-1/β-catenin mechanisms involved in StarD7-induced
  expression, based on current data. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a conserved cell-cell
  signaling mechanism in animals that regulates gene expression via the TCF/LEF1 family
  to coordinate many cellular processes. In the absence of Wnt signaling, the destruction
  complex remains in the cytoplasm, where it binds, phosphorylates, and ubiquitinates
  β-catenin via the β-transducing repeat-containing protein (βTrCP). Finally, the
  proteasome recycles the complex by degrading β-catenin (Wnt off). In the presence
  of Wnt signaling, the destruction complex captures and phosphorylates β-catenin
  but ubiquitination by β-TrCP is blocked. This results in accumulation and nuclear
  localization of the newly synthesized β-catenin. In the nucleus, β-catenin regulates
  target gene expression by interacting with TCF/LEF1 transcription factors []. Free
  β-catenin interacts with SF-1 to increase StarD7 transcription []. In addition,
  the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) may bind putative cAMP response
  elements that modulate gene expression. StarD7 mediates PC intracellular trafficking
  to the mitochondria [] and possibly to the plasma membrane [] and lipid droplets
  []. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CK1, casein kinase 1; Dvl, Dishevelled; LrP,
  low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.
