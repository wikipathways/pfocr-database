caption: Comparative overview of the inflammatory profiles induced by BaV and Kn-Ba
  in THP-1 macrophages. THP-1 macrophages were treated with BaV (left; blue) and Kn-Ba
  (right; red) resulting in the synthesis and secretion of the indicated cytokines,
  chemokines, and PGE2. The mediators highlighted in larger size were produced by
  both stimuli, but at higher levels at the evidenced side. Both stimuli induced the
  production and release of IL-1β, indicating the inflammasomes pathway activation
  during BaV envenomation. However, the highest production of this cytokine in response
  to BaV indicated the participation of other venom components in this process. The
  schematic art pieces used in this figure were provided by Servier Medical art. Servier
