caption: Whereas most tumors retain functional copies of the cGAS and STING coding
  genes (A) tumor cells have been shown capable of suppressing type I interferon signaling
  through a variety of mechanisms (B). Chromosome segregation errors can promote chromosome
  9p loss, which harbors the interferon gene cluster. Furthermore, they activate the
  p38 MAP-kinase pathway, which has been found to selectively inhibit ISG induction
  without affecting other STING-dependent inflammatory signaling, such as the SASP.
  Therefore, the consequences of cGAS-STING activation in cancer are context-dependent
  (C); acute STING activation in normal cells or near-diploid tumors is likely to
  exhibit an anti-tumor effect through the activation of type I interferon signaling,
  cellular senescence, and ensuing T-cell mediated immunity. As tumors become progressively
  chromosomally unstable, they adapt to tolerate chronic cGAS-STING signaling in response
  to cytosolic DNA by downregulating downstream interferon signaling and instead maintaining
  alternative pathways that promote tumorigenesis, senescence bypass, therapeutic
  resistance, and metastasis.
