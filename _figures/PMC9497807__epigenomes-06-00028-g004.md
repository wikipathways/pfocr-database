caption: Role of EZH2 in tumoral cells and tumor microenvironment (TME). (A) The blockage
  of EZH2 in tumoral cells reduces the immunosuppressive EZH2-mediated mechanisms.
  Therefore, upon EZH2, the inhibition double-stranded (ds) RNA-STING-IFN stimulated
  genes (ISG) pathway is activated, promoting the increase in MHC class I (MHC-I)
  expression, an increase in antigen presentation, Th1 chemokine signaling and interferon
  response, the release of chemokines implicated in immune cells recruitment such
  as CXCL9 and CXCL10, as well as PDL-1 expression. However, the inhibition of EZH2
  can lead to the accumulation of MDSCs in tumor sites. EZH2 is expressed in many
  immune cells, affecting cell function and differentiation. (B) In naïve CD8+ T-cells,
  EZH2-dependent gene repression silences both pro-effector and -memory genes to maintain
  developmental plasticity. In addition, in differentiated CD8+ effector T-cells,
  EZH2 selectively inhibits memory precursor signature genes, such as Id3, to restrict
  memory fate. In tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells, EZH2 regulates BCL-2 expression,
  inhibiting apoptosis (green box). EZH2 expression in naive CD4+ T-cells represses
  T-bet, EOMES and GATA3 expression, leading to the inhibition of Th1 and Th2 polarization
  (grey box). Moreover, EZH2 is required to stabilize FOXP3 expression in regulatory
  T-cells (purple box). (C) In the PCa tumoral context, it has been reported that
  EZH2 expression by tumoral cells promotes M2 macrophage polarization, but how EZH2
  regulates differentiation, polarization and migration in myeloid cells is unknown.
