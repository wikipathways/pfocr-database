caption: 'Graphical summary. Hypothetic physiologic changes that occur when replacing
  SFAs with PUFAs diet, as outlined in the Discussion. Annotations: bold grey, no
  difference; plain grey (nonbold), not measured; bold blue, increased/higher; bold
  red, reduced/lower; italics: gene names. Possible sequence of events: replacing
  SFAs with PUFAs changes the expression of LDLR, possibly via SREBP2 or other regulatory
  mechanisms. Higher expression of LDLR causes a higher hepatic uptake of apoB-containing
  lipoproteins, which reduces plasma lipoprotein subclasses, both apoB- and apoAI-containing
  types. This effect may be partially offset by higher expression of PCSK9. In PBMCs,
  controlled LXR activation may drive an increase in reverse cholesterol transport,
  which includes synthesis of fatty acids for efflux or to esterify free cholesterol
  to cholesteryl esters; normally, this would also correspond to an inhibition of
  β oxidation and modulation of inflammation-related gene expression. Higher hepatic
  cholesterol uptake both inhibits cholesterol synthesis, and activates cholesterol
  efflux to the gut. Cholesterol-derived oxysterols activate LXR, which activates
  the bile salt production. Other bile constituents are also produced, particularly
  from cysteine and other amino acids. Hepatic acetyl-CoA likely adjusts to a lower
  need for cholesterol synthesis, and directs energy surplus to production of primary
  ketone bodies. In addition, lower SFA influx requires less immediate neutralization
  via the β oxidation pathway, which could be reflected in lower hepatic oxidative
  stress. Abbreviations as in –.'
