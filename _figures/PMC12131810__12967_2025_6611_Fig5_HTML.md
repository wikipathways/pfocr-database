caption: 'Signaling pathways for axonal regeneration within neurons. A-D: Signaling
  pathways that promote mitochondrial energy metabolism in axonal regeneration. E-G:
  Signaling pathways that promote mitochondrial transport in axon regeneration. H-J:
  Signaling pathways promoting mitophagy, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress
  in axonal regeneration. (A) Following SCI, injury triggers Ca2+ influx into neurons,
  activating the CaMKK2/AMPK signaling pathway. This activation leads to an increase
  in mitochondrial abundance and enhances ATP synthesis function. (B) Injury-induced
  Ca2+ influx elevates intraneuronal Ca2+ concentration, activating the cAMP/PKA signaling
  pathway. Subsequently, this pathway triggers the downstream DLK/CEBP-1 signaling
  cascade, promoting mitochondrial replication and the synthesis of axon growth-associated
  proteins. (C) Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway facilitates the
  synthesis of axon growth-related proteins like GAP43 and p-S6 in neurons. This activation
  synergizes with the cAMP/PKA/DLK signaling pathway to further support axonal regeneration.
  (D) Activation of the JAKA/STAT3 signaling pathway in mitochondria during mitochondrial
  replication inhibits SOCS3 from functioning. (E) SNPH plays a crucial role in mitochondrial
  anchoring, maintaining their fixed position within neurons. Following neuronal injury,
  the PI3K/AKT/PAK5 signaling pathway is activated to release mitochondrial anchorage,
  facilitating their trafficking toward the axon terminals. This process promotes
  the substitution of damaged mitochondria with functionally intact ones, ensuring
  the requisite energy supply for axonal regeneration. (F) and (G) The collaboration
  between the PARKIN/MIRO1 phase and the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway synergistically
  enhances mitochondrial trafficking towards axon terminals in neurons. (H) Following
  neuronal injury, calcium influx activates the CaMKK2/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway,
  regulating inflammatory responses and suppressing the expression of inhibitory cytokines
  IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. (I) Neuronal injury triggers the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway, facilitating mitochondrial clearance of intra-neuronal ROS to
  counteract oxidative stress. (J) Neuronal injury induces activation of the PINK/PARKIN/MIRO1
  signaling pathway, which promotes mitophagy, eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria,
  and creates a conducive environment for axonal regeneration'
