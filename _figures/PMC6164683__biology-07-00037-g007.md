caption: Proposed model for uncoupling protein 2-acetylation by sirtuins signaling
  pathway on HepG2 treated with high glucose and M. oleifera extract. The solid lines
  indicate carbon skeletal main flux to mitochondria (a). While that punted lines
  indicates the secondary pathways. PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; CK, Krebs cycle.
  The numbers 1 and 2 indicates the dissociation and association of the mitochondrial
  supercomplexes. Red and green lines indicate inhibition and activation of metabolic
  process by high glucose (b) and M. oleifera extract (c), respectively. Glut 1 and
  Glut 9 as major contributors to glucose influx in HepG2 cells []. MP, plasma membrane.
  Red triangle indicates potential site of acetylation in mitochondrial complexes.
