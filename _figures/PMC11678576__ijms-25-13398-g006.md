caption: Signaling pathways of Na, K–ATPase and their consequences in cancer. The
  inhibition of Na, K–ATPase by ouabain (red boxes) and the combined treatment with
  digoxin and cisplatin (green boxes) activate the Src/EGFR pathway, which leads to
  the activation of ERK and increased ROS production in mitochondria. This activates
  NF-κB, resulting in transcriptional regulation. EGFR phosphorylated activates the
  PKC pathway. Ouabain decreases the expression of alpha and beta subunits, while
  the combined treatment with digoxin and cisplatin has antitumoral effects. Solid
  arrows indicate experimentally supported events induced by inhibitors mentioned,
  while broken arrows indicate events with limited or indirect support
