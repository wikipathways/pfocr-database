caption: ( A) Phosphate reabsorption in the PT is mediated by the transcellular pathway.
  Apical entry occurs through the sodium-phosphate exchanger family (NaPi) subtypes
  IIa and IIc and sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2 (PiT-2). The stoichiometric
  ratio and preference of phosphate species are depicted. The basolateral extrusion
  of phosphate may occur through the xenotropic and polytropic retroviral receptor
  (XPR1). ( B) Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) both
  attenuate phosphate reabsorption in the PT by inhibiting NaPi-II cotransporters.
  PTH in the tubular fluid and blood activates protein kinase A and C (PKA and PKC).
  These kinases phosphorylate the PDZ domain–containing scaffold protein sodium hydrogen
  exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1), leading to internalization and degradation
  of NaPi-IIa. FGF23 in the blood binds to its receptor complex (which includes the
  cofactor, klotho). This leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway, resulting in phosphorylation of NHERF1. This signal cascade
  also decreases NaPi-IIa abundance. How PTH and FGF affect NaPi-IIc is currently
  unknown.
