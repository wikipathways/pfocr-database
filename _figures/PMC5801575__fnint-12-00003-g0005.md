caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathways of Cat315+, Cat316+ and WFA+ aggrecan. The
  glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region is assembled on specific Ser residues of
  aggrecan. Although aggrecan core protein contains more than 100 potential CS attachment
  sites, only one attachment site is shown in the figure for simplicity. (A) HNK-1ST
  transfer a sulfate to the non-reducing terminal GlcA residue of the linkage region,
  generating a Cat315+ truncated CS chain that prevents further elongation of the
  repeating disaccharides. (B,C) Transfer of a GalNAc to the terminal GlcA residue
  in the linkage region by ChGn-1, 2 or chondroitin polymerases triggers the elongation
  of a CS chain. Cat316+ CS chains are mainly produced by a ChGn-1-dependent pathway
  (B). WFA+ and Cat316+ CS chains may have different sulfation pattern and/or chain
  length (C). Otx2 may selectively bind to Cat316+ CS chains.
