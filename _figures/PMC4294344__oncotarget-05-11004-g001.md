caption: Cancer cells show an increased flux through to the glycolysis, pentose phosphate
  pathway and high glutamine consumption. Moreover, they also show an increased uptake
  of glycine and serine. In particular, the serine synthesis pathway utilizes the
  glycolytic intermediate glycerate-3-phosphate, which is converted by PHGDH, PSAT-1
  and PSPH into serine. De novo synthetized serine and glycine fuel on-carbon metabolism.
  The one-carbon metabolism plays an essential role in the generation of proteins,
  nucleotides, GSH and substrates for methylation reactions. In red are the cancer-associated
  genes. PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PSAT-1, phosphoserine aminotransferase
