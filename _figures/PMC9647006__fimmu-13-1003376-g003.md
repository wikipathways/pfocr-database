caption: Gut-derived LPS translocates by chylomicrons and increase intestine permeability
  to promote liver regeneration. LPS induce the release of IL-6 and TNF-α in Kupffer
  cells through NF-κB signaling pathway. IL-6 promote the DNA synthesis and mitosis
  of hepatocytes by activating JAK/STAT pathway and Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway. IL-6 promote
  the DNA synthesis and mitosis of hepatocytes by activating JAK/STAT pathway and
  Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway. TNF-α activate JNK and MAPK-ERK, inducing cyclin D1 expression.
  Besides, LPS can enhance the effect of HGF on hepatocytes.
