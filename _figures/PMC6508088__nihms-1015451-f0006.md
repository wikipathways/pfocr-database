caption: 'Our results support a model in which multiple upstream regulatory pathways
  converge on dmd-3 and mab-3 to regulate the temporal (red), sexual (green) and cell-type
  (yellow) specificity of tail tip morphogenesis. Temporal specificity is imparted
  by the heterochronic pathway via let-7 and lin-41. Sexual specificity arises by
  the regulation of dmd-3 by tra-1, likely to be direct. At least two pathways can
  be thought of as cell-type determinants: the yellow 1 depicts the induction phase
  of dmd-3 expression in hyp8–11, while the yellow 2 indicates the maintenance and
  amplification phase. Downstream of dmd-3 and mab-3 lie multiple effectors of morphogenesis
  including eff-1. The targets that mediate hyp8–11 retraction are unknown, as is
  the upstream regulatory pathway that initiates dmd-3 expression (1) in the tail
  tip. Black arrows indicate regulatory events that are likely to be direct. The solid
  grey arrow indicates indirect regulation. Dashed arrows indicate steps for which
  the molecular mechanism is unknown. Thin grey arrows indicate that the function
  of mab-3 in tail tip morphogenesis is secondary to that of dmd-3.'
