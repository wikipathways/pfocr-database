caption: Schematic depiction of hypothesized biochemical mechanisms for corrosion-related
  titanium-tissue interaction of dental implants. Corrosion process of dental implants
  leading to Ti particle/ion release arises from the electrochemical attack of the
  reactive oral environment to the implant surface by disrupting the protective oxide
  passive layer (TiO2). As a consequence, there is an induction of inflammatory process
  in the soft tissue cells (e.g., fibroblasts) and bone cells, which is mainly led
  by signaling factors promoting the differentiation and recruitment of osteoclast
  cells responsible for peri-implant bone resorption (left panel). In a close look,
  there are several potential biochemical routes for the occurrence of these peri-implant
  inflammatory processes (right side). For instance, when dental implants are subjected
  to physical, chemical, and bacterial factors present in the reactive oral environment,
  it can be supposed that there is a multidirectional pathway loop for the Ti-tissue
  interaction. For example, once metallic particles/ions are released, the peri-implant
  inflammatory process may occur by activating the function of phagocytic cells such
  as (1) neutrophils and (2) macrophages, (3) stimulating some communication pathways
  of osteoblastic cells, or even promoting (4) microbial accumulation in the degraded
  rougher surface region. In particular, the phagocytosis of Ti ions may lead to a
  (5) higher expression level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL1β, IL6, and
  TNFα), and all of these mentioned processes (3 to 5) may induce (6) RANKL expression
  within osteogenic cells, thus indirectly promoting RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation
  and consequent (7) tissue inflammation and bone resorption. Once inflammation occurs,
  the pH level of the region is reduced with concurrent microbial dysbiosis, favoring
  the generation of bacterial acid products that, in the end, also negatively affect
  the corrosion resistance of Ti. Created and adapted from “Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic
