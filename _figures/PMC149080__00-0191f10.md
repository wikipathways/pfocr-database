caption: Outline Model for the Genetic Control of Appressorium Turgor Generation by
  the Rice Blast Fungus M. grisea.In this model, the mobilization of glycogen and
  triacylglycerol reserves to the developing appressorium occurs under control of
  the PMK1 MAPK pathway. Glycerol generation is achieved by degradation of triacylglycerol
  by triacylglycerol lipase, which is regulated by CPKA/SUM1-encoded PKA. Fatty acids
  are processed by β-oxidation and may be used to produce glycerol by way of the glyoxylate
  cycle and gluconeogenesis. Glycogen degradation, which is similarly regulated within
  the appressorium at the onset of turgor generation, is used to fuel glycolysis during
  glycerol accumulation and may contribute to glycerol production by the metabolism
  of dihydroxyacetone 3-phosphate (DHAP), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), or glyceraldehyde
  (GAD). Glycerol accumulation results in hydrostatic turgor and is translated into
  the force required for cuticle penetration by reorientation of the cytoskeleton,
  localized dissolution of the cell wall, and formation of penetration pegs. These
  processes are likely to be regulated by the action of PKA and stimulation of a signal
  transduction pathway involving the MPS1 MAPK (). In the model shown, genetic control
  points are shown in blue and putative enzymatic activities are given in green. GPH,
  glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1); TGL, triacylglycerol lipase (EC 3.1.1.3); GPD,

  glycerol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.77). Multiple arrows indicate several intermediate
  steps in pathway not shown.
