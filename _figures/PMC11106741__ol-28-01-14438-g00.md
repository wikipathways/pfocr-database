caption: The role of Esc in cancer cells was revealed to be related to apoptosis,
  which is governed by the mitochondrial pathway, ER stress and ferritinophagy. Esc
  induces mitochondrial apoptosis by stimulating cyt C release, activating caspase-3
  and caspase-9 and enhancing ROS generation across various cell lines. ROS further
  modulate the mitochondrial membrane potential and amplify pro-apoptotic molecules
  in the cytosol. ER stress, which is vital for cellular processes, responds to Esc
  by increasing mitochondrial Ca2+ levels in cancer cells. ER stress activates the
  UPR, activating signaling molecules (such as PERK, IRE1 and ATF6) and transcription
  factors (such as XBP1 and CHOP) that regulate UPR genes and trigger ER stress-induced
  apoptosis, particularly caspase-12 activation. Esc elevates ROS levels, suppresses
  antioxidants and downregulates NFE2L2, fostering ferroptosis in liver cancer cells
  by promoting NCOA4/LC3II/FTH1-mediated ferritinophagy. Esc-induced ferritinophagy
  enhances intracellular iron levels and inhibits liver cancer cell proliferation.
