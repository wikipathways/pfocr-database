caption: Proposed diosmin biosynthetic pathway from phenylalanine. The phenylpropanoid
  pathway (blue box) starts with phenylalaine produced by the shikimate pathway. The
  diosmin (red box) biosynthesis pathway starts with chalcone synthase (CHS) converting
  three molecules of malonyl-CoA and one molecule of 4-coumaroyl-CoA into naringenin
  chalcone. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate
  ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; FNS, flavone synthase;
  F3'H, flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase; F4′OMT, flavonoid 4′-O-methyltransferase; F7GT,
  flavonoid 7-O-glucosyltransferase; 1,6RhaT, 1,6-rhamnosyltransferase
