caption: 'Signaling mechanisms of CD271. First panel: in the absence or low expression
  of co-receptors, CD271 form homotetramers (homodimers are shown) and controls either
  cell survival via a RIP2-mediated activation of NFĸB and downstream pro-survival
  genes or apoptosis via TRAF6. The latter competes with RIP2 for binding to CD271
  and activates JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinases)/JUN signaling. Second panel: The activation
  of the typical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) is triggered by binding
  of neurotrophins to the complex of CD271 and tropomyosin-related kinases (TRKs),
  leading to signaling processes mediated by ERK1/2 (extracellular-regulated kinases)
  or PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases) promoting proliferation and cell survival.
  Third panel: the aggregation of CD271 with sortilin triggers apoptosis in response
  to neurotrophin precursors, e.g., pro-NGF. Apoptosis is induced via the recruitment
  of TRAF6 (tnf-receptor associated factor 6), NRAGE/MAGED1 and NRIF to the dead domain
  (DD) of CD271 via c-jun n-terminal-kinase (JNK) or via activation of NFĸB. Fourth
  panel: CD271 triggers the activation of RHOA (RAS-homolog family member A) and RHO-kinases
  which in turn activate LIM-kinase (LIMK1) and ERM proteins (EZR; ezrin, RDX, radixin
  and MSN; moesin) to control cell migration in conjunction with nogo receptor/RTN4R
  (reticulon 4 receptor).'
