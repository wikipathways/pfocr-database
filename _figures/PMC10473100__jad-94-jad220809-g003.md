caption: The interaction of necroptosis and Aβ formation and Tau. Binding of the death
  receptor TNF and the ligand TNFR1 stimulates the formation of necrosomes, which
  consist of RIPK1 and RIPK3 and allow autophosphorylation. Then, p-RIPK3 recruits
  and phosphorylates MLKL, promoting its translocation to the plasma membrane, leading
  to necroptosis. In this pathway, the RIPK1/RIPK3 complex forms amyloid fibril structures
  and increases cell surface levels of full-length AβPP and sAβPPβ, promoting Aβ plaque
  aggregation. Furthermore, Aβ plaques act as a reservoir for Aβo, and when Aβo is
  released, it stimulates microglia to secrete inflammatory factors, including TNF-α,
  and to undergo necroptosis. On the other hand, hyperphosphorylated Tau promotes
  necroptosis by activating the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL axis and simultaneously activates
  the NF-κB pathway, leading to M1microglial activation and neuroinflammation.
