caption: cGAS–STING. (A) 1) cGAS binds cytosolic dsDNA and they form a dimer. The
  cGAS–dsDNA dimer catalyzes the production of cGAMP, a ligand and secondary messenger
  for STING. 2) STING binds cGAMP and is ubiquitinated by TRIM56, inducing STING dimerization
  and translocation from the ER to the golgi. STING is then further ubiquitinated
  by TRIM32, allowing TBK1 to bind the complex. 3A) STING relocation to the golgi
  complex can activate autophagy in a pathway that is separate from the activation
  of IFN–related genes. 3B) TBK1 binding to STING triggers STING phosphorylation of
  S365 and the binding and activation of IRF3. Subsequently, IRF3 translocates to
  the nucleus and activates the transcription of IFN–1 and Interferon Stimulatory
  Genes (ISG). (B) HSV–1 has developed several mechanisms to sabotage cGAS-STING signaling.
  1) Viral proteins UL41 and VP22 interact with cGAS, preventing the synthesis of
  cGAMP. 2) UL46 acts on TBK1 and prevents autophagy induction.
