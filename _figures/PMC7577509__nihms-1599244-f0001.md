caption: Interactions between established and emerging clinical biomarkers suggest
  that more comprehensive molecular profiling would improve patient outcomes a. Detection
  of, and stratification based on genetic and/or clinical features associated with
  primary resistance, such as alterations in the MAPK signalling pathway, might improve
  responsiveness to targeted therapies and/or enable the identification of more effective
  drug combinations. b. The accumulation of low-prevalence ‘actionable’ alterations
  has the potential to increase the total use of biomarker-guided therapies c. The
  co-occurrence of more than one ‘actionable’ alteration might enable new treatment
  options when resistance develops, although the most appropriate treatment sequence
  and/or drug combinations need to be determined. BRAFi, BRAF inhibitor; ERBB2amp,
  amplification of ERBB2/HER2; Fusion+, positive for kinase gene fusions; MSI-H, microsatellite
  instability-high; RASwt, RAS wild-type.
