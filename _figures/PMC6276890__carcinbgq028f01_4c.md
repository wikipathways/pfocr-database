caption: Canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways of the AhR. ( A ) Schematic
  representation of canonical AhR signaling pathway. The cytosolic AhR is complexed
  by two molecules of Hsp90, XAP2 and the co-chaperone p23. Binding of a ligand, e.g.
  TCDD, leads to a conformational change, thereby allowing nuclear translocation of
  the AhR complex. In the nucleus, the AhR dissociates from the complex and dimerizes
  with ARNT. The AhR–ARNT heterodimer then binds to xenobiotic-responsive elements
  (XREs) in the promoters of genes encoding for several phase I and phase II metabolizing
  enzymes but also several other genes, e.g. CYP2S1, COX2 or Slug (  ). Recruitment
  of additional co-factors and factors of the basal transcription machinery (not shown)
  finally allows transcription of these genes. GSTM, glutathione- S -transferase M;
  NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1; UGT1A, uridine 5′-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase
  1A; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase ( B – D ) Schematic representation of examples
  of non-canonical AhR signaling. (B) In pRB-proficient cell lines, activation of
  the AhR by exogenous ligands may lead to direct interaction with pRB and via several
  mechanisms to inhibition of the transcription factor E2F (  ). As a consequence,
  progression from G 1 - to S-phase is blocked. Cell cycle arrest may also be induced
  by additional mechanisms, such as induction of p27 (  ,  ). (C) Reciprocal inhibitory
  effects between the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and the AhR pathway have been
  described. One consequence of inhibition of AhR signaling by NF-κB is attenuation
  of ligand-induced CYP1A1 expression. However, also cooperative effects of the AhR
  and NF-κB pathways are known (  ). (D) The ligand-activated AhR directly associates
  with estrogen or androgen receptors (ERα or AR) and modulates their function both
  positively and negatively. Recently, it was shown that the AhR promotes the proteolysis
  of ERα/AR through assembling a ubiquitin ligase complex, CUL4B(AhR) (  ).
