caption: Arginine methylation of G3BP1 regulates both Ctnnb1 mRNA and canonical Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling. In the absence of Wnt stimulation (–Wnt3a), the G3BP1of Dvl3-based supermolecular
  complex (signalsomes) binds and regulates Ctnnb1 mRNA (left). Stimulation of cells
  by Wnt3a activates PRMT1, which methylates G3BP1, provoking release of Ctnnb1 mRNA
  as well as release of G3BP1 from the signalsome. Increased Ctnnb1 mRNA provokes
  increased accumulation of β-catenin and activation of canonical Wnt pathway via
  Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene transcription.
