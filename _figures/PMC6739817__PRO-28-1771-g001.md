caption: Flowchart showing different reactions in the glycolytic pathway. Reactions
  in the glycolytic pathway are shown with chemical structures of the substrates,
  products and cofactors including metal ions at each step. Enzymes responsible for
  catalyzing the irreversible regulatory steps are indicated in red. *GAP and **DHAP
  are abbreviations for glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate,
  respectively. In some hyperthermophilic archaea, GAP is irreversibly oxidized to
  3‐phosphoglycerate (3PG) by glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate ferrodoxin oxidoreductase
  or nonphosphorylating GAP dehydrogenase. Nevertheless, in the last reaction in the
  modified glycolytic pathway of these organisms PyK catalyzes the conversion of PEP
  to PYR. PyKs of the Thermoproteales archaea are activated by 3PG
