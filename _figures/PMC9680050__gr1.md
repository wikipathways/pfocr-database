caption: Graphical description of the differences and similarities in the tissues
  and signaling pathways in the stress response between fish and mammalian models.
  When stress is perceived by sensory cells in both fish and mammals, the signal is
  sent to the hypothalamus, which then releases corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH),
  the first major signaling hormone in this pathway. When CRH is detected by receptors
  in the pituitary, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and α-Melanocyte-stimulating
  hormone (α-MSH) are released. The pituitary also releases growth hormones (GH) and
  prolactin (PRL). Additionally, ACTH stimulates the release of cortisol in the inter-renal
  cells of the fish head kidney, and the adrenal cortex of the mammalian adrenal gland.
  Alternatively, catecholamines are produced by the chromaffin cells of the fish head
  kidney and the adrenal medulla of the mammalian adrenal gland, the release of which
  is caused by signaling via acetylcholine (Ach). Superscripted values indicate the
  respective receptor type(s) for each hormone. The described hormones are, CRH-receptor
  (CRH-R), melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), melanocortin receptor (MCR), GH-receptor
  (GH-R), PRL-receptor (PRL-R), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor
  (MR), α adrenergic receptors (α-AR), β adrenergic receptors (β-AR). Some receptor
  notations were generalized due to the lack of standardized notation between different
  fish species.
