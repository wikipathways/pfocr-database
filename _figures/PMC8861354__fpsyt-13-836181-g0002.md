caption: Functions of IL-17A in the embryonic and adult brains. (A) MIA induces the
  production of IL-17A (IL-17A/A indicates the homodimer) in Th17 cells of the maternal
  intestine and placenta. IL-17A crosses the blood-placental barrier and affects embryonic
  brain development. (B) IL-17A is produced by γδT cells in the cranial meninges and
  regulates the mPFC, which controls emotion, and HPF, which regulates memory formation.
  This pathway may be activated in the Alzheimer's disease model. Direct injection
  of IL-17A into the S1DZ restores the ASD phenotypes of repetitive behavior or sociability.
  IL-17A also controls the gut microbiota, and its disruption causes autoimmunity.
  IL17A is involved in the destruction of the BBB in several neurological disorders.
  Intravenous injection of IL-17A affects the hypothalamus and alters systemic blood
  pressure. IL, interleukin; MIA, maternal immune activation; Th17, T helper 17; mPFC;
  medial prefrontal cortex; HPF, hippocampal formation; S1DZ, primary somatosensory
  cortex dysgranular zone; ASD, autism spectrum disorder; BBB, blood-brain barrier;
  HYP, hypothalamus; BP, blood pressure; EAE, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis;
  Tc17, IL-17-producing CD8+ T cells; NKT, natural killer T cells; NK; natural killer
  cells; ILC3, type 3 innate lymphoid cells; AMY, amygdala; TeA, temporal association
  area.
