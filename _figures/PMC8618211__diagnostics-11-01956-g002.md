caption: 'Pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy and neuropathic pain in connective
  tissue disease. (A) I L-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α are sensed by nociceptors, which then
  leads to the release of various neuropeptides, such as calcitonin gene-related protein
  and substance P, resulting in vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability.
  (B) The mediators released from sensory neurons in the periphery attract and activate
  immune innate cells and adaptative immune cells, release NGF and PGE2, inducing
  peripheral sensitisation and hyperalgesic phenomena. (C) (1) The invasion of anti-plexin
  D1 antibodies in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) on which the BBB and blood–nerve
  barrier are absent and binding to unmyelinated small DRG neurons (primary sensory
  neurons), cause neuropathic pain. (2) ET-1 (endothelin-1) causes BBB hyperpermeability
  and activates microglia and astroglia through the ET-1/EDNRB (endothelin receptor
  type B) pathway in allergic inflammation. Then glial activation triggers the activation
  of second-order sensory neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and induces
  neuropathic pain. (D) (1) Cell-mediated immunity: circulating T cells recognize
  antigens related to endothelial cells acting as antigen-presenting cells, Increased
  expression of cell adhesion molecules and release of chemotactic cytokines caused
  by this interaction, in turn, recruit and activate neutrophils and lymphocytes with
  subsequent inflammation and destruction of the vascular wall. (2) Deposition of
  immune complexes (IC): circulating antibodies binding to endogenous or exogenous
  antigens forms IC which deposits on the vascular wall and activates the complement
  system, then the factors C3a and C5a chemotactic for neutrophils are formed. Neutrophils
  could infiltrate the vascular wall, phagocyte the IC and release proteolytic enzymes
  and oxygen-free radicals that destroy the vascular wall. (E) Due to the substantially
  increased number of potential antigens and the crucial permeability of the blood–nerve
  barrier in nodal and juxta paranodal structures, nodes of Ranvier may be a vulnerable
  target for autoimmunity.'
