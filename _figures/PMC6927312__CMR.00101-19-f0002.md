caption: 'Central metabolic pathway requirement for UTIs. Protein designations are
  provided only for mutants that were tested in a mouse UTI coinfection model. See  and  for
  more-detailed information. The thick arrows indicate reactions required for a mouse
  UTI, and the dashed arrows indicate reactions that are not required. Double-headed
  arrows represent reversible reactions. The pentose cycle is simplified to show a
  linear sequence, when it is actually a sequence of eight reactions that interconnect
  with glycolysis. Metabolite abbreviations: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Fru-6-P,
  fructose-6-phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; Gal-1-P, galactose-1-phosphate;

  KDGP, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-phosphate; OAA, oxaloacetate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  Rib-5-P, ribose-5-phosphate. Enzyme abbreviations: AckA, acetate kinase; Acs, acetyl
  coenzyme A synthetase; Edd, phosphogluconate dehydratase; FrdA, fumarate reductase;
  FumC, fumarase C; GalK, galactokinase; Gnd, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; LacZ,
  β-galactosidase; PckA, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PfkA, phosphofructokinase
