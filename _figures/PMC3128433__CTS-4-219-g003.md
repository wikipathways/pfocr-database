caption: The complement cascade, hemolyisis, and eculizumab. CD55 and CD59 are complement
  regulatory proteins, CD 55 downregulates C3 convertase activity and CD59 blocks
  MAC formation. Deficiency of CD59 increases MAC formation and induces intravascular
  hemolysis, which is the primary cause of hemoglobinuria in PNH patients; deficiency
  of CD55 leads to increased C3 convertase activity and C3d‐associated extravascular
  hemolysis. Eculizumab blocks C5 activation, therefore prevents MAC formation and
  intravascular hemolysis. In the alternative pathway, C3 tickover and C3 convertase
  amplification generate membrane bound C3d, which may lead to significant extravascular
  hemolysis in some PNH patients receiving eculizumab treatment.
