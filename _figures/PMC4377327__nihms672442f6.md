caption: a | microRNAs (miRNAs) that promote neurogenesis are often integrated into
  positive transcriptional and epigenetic feedback loops. The transcription factor
  TLX recruits the histone H3K4 demethylase LSD1 to inhibit miR-9 and miR-137 in neural
  stem cells (NSCs). During differentiation, miR-9 and miR-137 levels increase and
  target TLX and LSD1, respectively. Similarly, the methylated DNA binding protein
  MBD1 inhibits miR-195 in NSCs. During differentiation, miR-195 levels increase and
  this represses MBD1. Additionally, the REST complex, which represses neuronal gene
  expression, is highly expressed in NSCs and represses miR-9 and miR-124. During
  differentiation, REST levels decrease and miR-9 and miR-124 levels increase. miR-9
  and miR-124 target components of the REST complex during differentiation. b | miRNAs
  enriched in oligodendrocytes (dark blue) promote oligodendrocyte differentiation
  by targeting transcription factors that are highly expressed in progenitors (HES5,
  SOX6, FOXJ3 and ZFP238) and signalling pathway components (platelet-derived growth
  factor receptor A (PDGFRA)). miRNAs upregulated during neuronal differentiation
  (let-7, miR-124 and miR-9*) (dark blue) promote cell cycle exit by inhibiting the
  cell cycle regulator cyclin D, chromatin remodeller BAF53A and transcription factors
  (such as SOX9) that are important for the progenitor state. c | miRNAs upregulated
  during neuronal differentiation (dark blue) promote derepression of neuronal gene
  expression (miR-26 and miR-124 targeting the REST complex, and miR-9/let-7 targeting
  TLX) and neuron-specific splicing (miR-124 targeting splicing regulator polypyrimidine
  tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1)). miR-9* and miR-124 also promote the formation
  of a neuron-specific chromatin remodelling complex by inhibiting a progenitor-specific
  subunit (miR-9* and miR-124 targeting BAF53A) of the complex. OPC, oligodendrocyte
  progenitor cell.
