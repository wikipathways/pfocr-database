caption: 'The role of miR-152 in hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma
  (A), AML-NPM1 (B), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (C), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (D),
  chronic myeloid leukemia (E), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (F). A miR-152 acts
  as an inhibitor of multiple myeloma by suppressing the expression of DNMT1, DKK1,
  and BRD4. B By suppressing the expression of ULK3, miR-152-3p can prevent the AML-NPM1
  development. C miR-152-3p can inhibit the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma development
  by targeting unknown oncogenic factors. D miR-152 acts as a suppressor of non-Hodgkin
  lymphoma by inhibiting the expression of DNMT1. E miR-152 may facilitate the chronic
  myeloid leukemia development by repressing the expression of the tumor suppressor
  P27. F miR-152 may support acute lymphoblastic leukemia development by repressing
  the expression of the tumor suppressor ATP2A2. As illustrated, enzyme DNMT1 and
  various types of lncRNAs affect miR-152 expression/activity in indicated hematologic
  malignancies. ATP2A2: ATPase Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2 + Transporting
