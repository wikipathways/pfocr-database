caption: Model of CENP-A containing chromatin throughout the cell cycle in animals.
  The levels of CENP-A at centromeres change with the cell cycle. Prior to S phase,
  CENP-A is fully loaded at the centromere, but upon replication, the number of CENP-A
  molecules present on each daughter strand are reduced to half per centromere copy
  as no new CENP-A protein is added. During G2, new CENP-A is synthesized and assembles
  into a soluble complex with its binding partner H4 and its chaperone HJURPScm3,
  but is not deposited at centromeres until G1. Cells progress through mitosis with
  half-loaded centromeres. During late anaphase/telophase, HJURPScm3 begins to deposit
  CENP-A to duplicate CENP-A protein levels.
