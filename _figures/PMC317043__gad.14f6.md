caption: A model for transcriptional regulation of Notch-activated genes. (Top) In
  the absence of activated Notch, gene transcription is repressed by binding of CBF1/RBP-Jκ
  and the recruitment of a corepressor complex containing histone deacetylase activity.
  (Bottom) Upon activation of Notch signaling by binding of the Notch ligand Delta,
  an intracellular form of Notch is released by proteolytic cleavage and translocates
  to the nucleus where it interacts with CBF1/RBP-Jκ. This interaction displaces the
  corepressor complex and results in activation of transcription presumably by removal
  of the histone deacetylase activity. It remains to be determined whether transcriptional
  activation by a Notch : CBF1/RBP-Jκ complex involves the recruitment of histone
  acetylases.
