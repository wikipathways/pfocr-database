caption: Proposed mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine
  and its metabolite (2R,6R)-HNK. In GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, ketamine is
  proposed to decrease GABA release onto glutamatergic presynaptic neurons by antagonizing
  NRG1/ErbB4 signaling pathway (1) and/or blockade of NMDARs (2), resulting in disinhibition
  of pyramidal neurons. Augmented glutamate transmission activates AMPARs and subsequently
  enhances BDNF release. In postsynaptic neurons, ketamine is proposed to augment
  BDNF/TrkB pathway by releasing the inhibition of BDNF translation from eEF2K (3),
  directly binding with its receptor TrkB (5), and/or by activating the PI3K-Akt and
  MEK-ERK signaling pathways (6). One of the downstream targets activated via PI3K-Akt
  and MEK-ERK signaling pathways is mTORC1, which is implicated in synaptogenesis-
  and synaptic plasticity-relevant processes. Besides direct activation by BDNF/TrkB
  signaling, blockade of NMDARs by ketamine is proposed to activate mTORC1 indirectly
  through compromising the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of mTORC1 activator Rheb
  (7), or by inhibition of extrasynaptic NMDARs (8). At rest, spontaneous vesicle
  release may play an important role in maintaining the activation of NMDARs at basal
  level. Reelin/ApoER2 may be implicated in this process and be modulated by ketamine
  (4). Inhibition of NMDAR by ketamine blockade may promote AMPAR insertion at postsynaptic
  sites as a homeostatic process (10). BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway may trigger phosphorylation
  of MeCP2, which is essential for sustained antidepression-like action of ketamine
  (11). In astrocyte, ketamine is proposed to trigger the translocation of Gas to
  non-raft domains, leading to enhanced AC activity and elevated BDNF expression (9).
  (2R,6R)-HNK may act on the presynaptic terminal to increase glutamate release, possibly
  via inhibition of mGluR2 receptors (A). Elevated glutamate release may activate
  postsynaptic AMPARs and enhance BDNF release (B). (2R,6R)-HNK may also facilitate
  the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway by directly binding with TrkB (C), or by disrupting
  the interaction between TrkB and AP-2, thus inhibiting the endocytosis of TrkB (D).
  These mechanisms may have different temporal spatial features and may function synergistically
  or complementarily, leading to a rebalanced excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission
  and restored integrity of neural circuits, which is indispensible for the antidepressant-like
  action of ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK.
