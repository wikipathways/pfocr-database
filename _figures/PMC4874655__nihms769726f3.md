caption: Currently, two discrete normal colon to colorectal cancer sequences have
  been identified. Both sequences involve the progression of normal colon epithelial
  cells to aberrant crypt foci, followed by early and advanced polyps with subsequent
  progression to early cancer and then advanced cancer. The ‘classic’ or traditional
  pathway (top) involves the development of tubular adenomas that can progress to
  adenocarcinomas. An alternate pathway (bottom) involves serrated polyps and their
  progression to serrated colorectal cancer has been described in the last 5–10 years.
  The genes mutated or epigenetically altered are indicated in each sequence; some
  genes are shared between the two pathways whereas others are unique (for example,
  BRAF mutations and CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) only occur in the serrated
  pathway). The signalling pathways deregulated during the progression sequence are
  also shown, with the width of the arrow reflecting the significance of the signalling
  pathway in tumour formation.APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; CIN, chromosomal instability;
