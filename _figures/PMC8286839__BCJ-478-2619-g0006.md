caption: (A) The canonical pathway. The mechanism of activation of canonical NF-κB
  signalling pathway is best characterised for inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1
  or, as described here, TNFα. TNFα binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor
  leads to translocation of TNFR1 to lipid rafts and recruitment of TRADD to the cytoplasmic
  death domains of TNFR1. TRADD, in turn, recruits RIPK1 kinase (RIPK1), and subsequently
  the TRAF2 or TRAF5 adaptor proteins and cIAP1 or cIAP2 to assemble TNFR1 complex
  I. cIAP1 and cIAP2 generate K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on RIPK1 and other components
  of the complex. This is necessary to recruit LUBAC, which stabilises complex I by
  catalysing the attachment of linear M1-linked polyubiquitin chains, typically to
  RIPK1. K63-polyubiquitylated RIPK1 also recruits the TAK1:TAB complex. LUBAC-mediated
  M1-linked linear polyubiquitylation of RIPK1 then promotes the recruitment of NEMO
  the critical regulatory scaffold of the IKK complex. Binding of NEMO to ubiquitin
  chains is thought to induce a conformational change that contributes to the activation
  of associated IKK kinases. Membrane proximal recruitment of IKK kinases also contributes
  to IKK activation through proximity to TAK1, which is thought to prime the activation
  of IKK via phosphorylation of S176/S177 of IKKα/IKKβ, and through oligomerisation
  of IKK complexes, which is thought to facilitate trans-autophosphorylation of the
  T loop, leading to full activation. The active IKK complex subsequently phosphorylates
  IκB proteins at S32 and S36 (in IκBα) and this phosphodegron recruits β-TrCP, which
  is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFβ-TrCP (S phase kinase-associated protein
  1 (SKP1)-cullin 1-F-box protein containing β-transducin repeat-containing protein).
  SCFβ-TrCP promotes the K48-linked ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of
  IκBα. This enables NF-κB complexes, such as p65-p50, to accumulate in the nucleus,
  where they activate NF-κB target genes involved in survival, proliferation, inflammation
  and immune regulation. (B) The non-canonical pathway. In the basal state (shown
  in the box), a TRAF2/3-cIAP1/2 complex catalyses the constitutive degradation of
  the protein kinase NIK. TRAF3 recruits NIK to the complex via dimerisation with
  TRAF2. cIAP1/2, recruited to the complex by interaction with TRAF2, catalyses the
  K48-linked polyubiquitylation of NIK, priming it for proteasomal degradation. This
  blocks the accumulation of NIK and hence prevents activation of non-canonical NF-κB
  signalling. Activation of the non-canonical pathway is driven by binding of ligand
  (e.g. CD40L, BAFF) to a subset of the TNF receptor superfamily members such as CD40
  and BAFF-R. Ligand engagement induces the recruitment of TRAF2, TRAF3 and cIAP1/2
  to the receptor. Here the K48-specific E3 ligase activity of cIAP1/2 switches from
  NIK to TRAF3, resulting in TRAF3 degradation. In some cases, TRAF2 is also targeted
  for degradation. In the absence of TRAF3, de novo synthesised NIK protein is stabilised,
  accumulates and phosphorylates IKKα at S176 to activate its kinase activity. NIK
  also recruits p100 to IKKα leading to IKKα phosphorylating p100. Phosphorylated
  p100 undergoes K48-linked ubiquitylation by β-TrCP and is targeted for limited proteolysis.
  A glycine rich region in p100 prevents complete proteasomal degradation. This releases
  the NF-κB subunit p52 and enables it to productively dimerise with RelB and translocate
  into the nucleus to regulate target gene expression. Notably, NIK-dependent activation
  of IKKα is proposed to be independent of NEMO.
