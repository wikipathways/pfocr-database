caption: 'Transcription, translation, and secretion of vIL-6. (A) Viral reactivation
  occurring during KSHV lytic replication initiates vIL-6 [open reading frame (ORF)
  K2] transcription via viral replication and transcription activator (RTA) and the
  cellular transcription factor recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin
  kappa J region (RBP-Jκ). mRNA of vIL-6 is a target of miR-1293 at a site also bound
  by the viral ORF57 protein. miR-1293 and viral ORF 57 protein compete with each
  other for binding to miR-1293. vIL-6 polypeptide undergoes N-linked glycosylation
  at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); N-glycan at Asp89 may facilitate intrinsic or
  chaperon-mediated protein folding. Immature vIL-6 may be glycosylated further at
  the Golgi apparatus and may relocated to ER by retrograde traffic. In the proximity
  of the ER, vIL-6 engages gp130 for autocrine signal transduction. In addition, vIL-6
  is secreted although inefficiently via an unidentified sorting pathway still undefined
  (?). (B) vIL-6 in KS tissue or normal endothelium. Primary infection of KSHV is
  associated with viral latency in vitro and in vivo, where KSHV DNA is maintained
  at a low copy number and vIL-6 expression is not detected or detected at very low
  levels. Hypoxia or other signals can induce KSHV lytic production associated with
  massive release of vIL-6 found in serum or culture supernatant. vIL-6 induces vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production, which promotes angiogenesis and vascular
  permeability. (C) vIL-6 in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). PEL cells contain a
  small population of cells undergoing lytic replication, which express vIL-6. vIL-6
  and other growth factors, particularly IL-10, are prominent survival factors for
  PEL. Lytic replication, induced by the hypoxic environment of effusions or other
  signals, leads to increased vIL-6 production: body cavity effusions and culture
  supernatants contain higher levels of vIL-6. Since vIL-6 promotes VEGF secretion,
  vIL-6 indirectly contributes to the accumulation of body cavity effusions. (D) vIL-6-producing
  cells in lymph node affected with multicentric Castleman''s disease. vIL-6-positive
  B-cells are located in the vicinity of germinal centers (GC) and marginal zones
  (MZ).'
