caption: Relationship between PAI-1 and IL-6 after SARS-Co-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2
  binds to ACE-2 on the target cell surface, resulting in the loss of ACE-2. ACE-2
  is a negative regulator that works by activating tPA. ACE-2 deficiency loses the
  effective ACE-2/angiotensin (1–7)/Mas receptor axis and increases the level of Ang1.
  ACE converts Ang I to Ang II and decreases tPA activity, causing endothelial cells
  and smooth muscle cells to synthesize and release PAI-1. Ang II binds to AT1/AT2
  to break the balance of PAI-1/tPA to its prethrombotic state. Elevated levels of
  PAI-1 in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients may upregulate IL-6 expression
  through TLR4/NF-κB pathway and activate macrophages to upregulate IL-6 and TNF-α
  expression. At the same time, TNF-α can also upregulate PAI-1 expression. IL-6 upregulates
  the expression of PAI-1 via STAT3/miR-29a.
