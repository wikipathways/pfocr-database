caption: Brief Description of Targets and their Pathways. Blue coloured boxes represent
  lncRNAs and grey coloured boxes represent their cis‐ and trans‐regulating mRNA targets.
  Red coloured lines with heads represent targets and arrows represent their relevant
  signalling pathways. The oval pink coloured boxes represent cellular mechanisms,
  regulated by these pathways. The dotted circle represents the target genes which
  are present in the HER2 positive subtype whereas the red star represents target
  genes common in both TNBC and HER2 positive subtype. LRP5L regulates the Wnt signalling
  pathway by binding to the Wnt ligand. This pathway has a crucial role in breast
  cancer. AL022324.3 and Z99916.3 were found to be breast cancer targets, but their
  pathways are not annotated yet. CYP4F3 and CYP4F8 genes regulate arachidonic acid
  (AA) metabolism and transform arachidonic acids to epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EETs)
  which are involved in angiogenesis and contribute to the tumour progression. TAF5L
  regulates pigment epithelium‐derived factor (PEDF) induced signalling and the G‐protein
  coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway which are also the major contributors to the breast
  cancer pathways
