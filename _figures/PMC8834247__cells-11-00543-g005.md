caption: Cancer cell immune escape. The binding of the target cell’s MHC or antigen
  to the T lymphocyte TCR complex induces the release of ER calcium stores, leading
  to Stim1 oligomerization and allowing calcium entry through plasma membrane CRAC
  channels. Capacitive Ca2+ entry induces the formation of the Ca2+–CaM–calcineurin
  complex, which in turn dephosphorylates the transcription factor NFAT, which, within
  minutes, translocates to the nucleus. When activated alone or with the other transcription
  factor AP1, NFAT allows T lymphocyte activation, and when paired with BATF or IRF4,
  NFAT can induce an exhausted phenotype. When bound to regulatory sequences, NFAT
  can modulate PD-1 expression and IFNγ cytokine secretion. When the link between
  PD-1 expressed by T lymphocytes and its ligand PD-L1 expressed by cancer cells is
  established, PD-1/PD-L1 signaling contributes to the modulation of effector functions
  of cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Cancer cells can also express other regulatory ligands,
  such as CD80/CD86 or Galectin-9, to provide a negative regulatory signal to T lymphocytes
  expressing their respective receptors CTLA-4 and TIM-3, resulting in T cell exhaustion.
  IFNγ secreted by T lymphocytes can bind to its receptor expressed by tumor cells
  and can thus activate the Ca2+/CaM/calcineurin pathway through the production of
  IP3, leading to the activation of NFAT, which can in turn activate the PD-L1 gene,
  inducing the inhibition of T cells presenting the surface molecule PD-1 and therefore
  preventing them from proliferating and secreting cytotoxic cytokines. Additionally,
  calcium influx activates NFAT1, which in turn activates the IFNγ gene promoter,
  inducing IFNγ production and thus regulating cytotoxic lysis and CSC survival.
