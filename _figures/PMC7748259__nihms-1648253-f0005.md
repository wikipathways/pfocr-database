caption: 'Feedback control systems in the actin cytoskeleton. (a) Rho-GTPases are
  localized to the cell membrane and cycle between an active GTP-bound state and an
  inactive GDP-bound state. The switching rates are determined by a large range of
  regulators (GEFs for activation and GAPs for inactivation). (b) A simplified diagram
  of the cross talks and feedback loops in the actin cytoskeleton controlled by the
  small GTPases of the Rho family. (c) Negative feedback control of protrusive activity
  in the lamellipodium controlled by the Rac pathway. (d) Positive feedback control
  of stress fiber assembly and contraction, downstream of the Rho pathway. (e) The
  actin cortex exhibits a mixture of contractile and protrusive activities downstream
  of the Rho and Rac pathways. Abbreviations: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GDP,
  guanosine diphosphate; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GTP, guanosine triphosphate.'
