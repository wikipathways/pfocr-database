caption: 'Differential regulation of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway in IR56 rice infested
  by TN1-BPH and IR56-BPH. This schematic illustrates the contrasting regulatory roles
  of lncRNAs in the JA biosynthesis pathway and flavonoid (e.g., proanthocyanidin)
  biosynthesis under infestations by TN1-BPH (left) and IR56-BPH (right) in IR56 rice.
  TN1-BPH infestation (resistance): Under TN1-BPH infestation, α-linolenic acid is
  metabolized into JA derivatives through the sequential actions of OsLOX (LOC_Os04g37430)
  and OsACX (LOC_Os06g24704), which are upregulated. The upregulation of these JA
  pathway genes enhances JA-CoA synthesis. These factors contributed to enhanced resistance
  of IR56 rice to TN1-BPH. IR56-BPH infestation (susceptibility): In contrast, IR56
  rice infested by IR56-BPH shows reduced partial JA biosynthesis. Specific lncRNAs,
  such as LNC_004240, LNC_000792, and LNC_001423, may suppress the expression of the
  JA biosynthesis gene OsLOX (LOC_Os04g37430), while LNC_003373 and LNC_000564 may
  inhibit OsACX (LOC_Os06g24704) expression, resulting in decreased JA-CoA production
  and weakened defense responses. Concurrently, the expression of the key enzyme OsLAR
  (LOC_Os04g53850) in the phenylalanine metabolic pathway was downregulated by LNC_002533,
  potentially reducing proanthocyanidin production. These metabolic changes may collectively
  contribute to the increased susceptibility of IR56 rice to IR56-BPH. Visual elements
  are represented as follows: red upward arrows for upregulation, blue downward arrows
  for downregulation, gray vertical bars for no significant change, and multiple arrows
  indicate greater fold changes in expression'
