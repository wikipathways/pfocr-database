caption: Mechanism of ADP Activity. Two enzymes in the Glutamate-GABA metabolic pathway
  are dependent on the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), Glutamic acid decarboxylase
  (GAD) and GABA transaminase (GABA-T). ADP binds to PLP and inhibits it is activity
  in a concentration-dependent fashion resulting in decreased GABA synthesis. Using
  a low concentration of ADP results in a small loss of GABA that may mimic conditions
  in individuals with low pyridoxine. Effects on GABA-T are thought to be small relative
  to GAD
