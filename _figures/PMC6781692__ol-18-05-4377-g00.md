caption: 'Shh signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma. Left (Off state): Ptch
  inhibits SMO activation. The signaling from SMO to Gli is blocked. SuFu binds to
  Gli for protein degradation via the proteasome. Therefore, the expression of Hh
  signaling pathway target gene turns off. Right (On state): Shh ligand bind to their
  receptor, PTCH. The binding of Hh ligands to PTCH weakens the inhibition of SMO
  and activates signal transduction via GLI transcription factor, activating downstream
  gene expression in cell migration/invasion/transition (SNAIL, MMPs, CHSY1), cell
  cycle/tumor growth (cyclin B1, CDK, Bcl2) and cancer stem cell marker (CD133). Shh,
  Sonic hedgehog; Ptch, protein patched homolog; SMO, smoothened homolog; Gli, glioma
  associated oncogene homolog; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.'
