caption: Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-NRAS-BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling
  stream is central in a large proportion of melanomas (mels), with BRAF and NRAS
  being the most commonly activated oncogenes. Upstream of RAS, KIT is amplified or
  activated in a substantial fraction of melanomas from acral, mucosal (muc), and
  chronic sun-damaged (CSD) sites. Stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K) pathway also occurs in melanomas either through loss of PTEN or activation
  of AKT3. In addition, GNAQ and GNA11, which encode G-α proteins, are preferentially
  mutated in ocular melanomas. Downstream effectors of the activated signaling network
  lead to increased transcription of survival genes by transcription factors and heightened
  prosurvival signals in the mitochondria (Mito) via regulation of apoptotic proteins
  (red, proapoptotic; green, prosurvival). In the nucleus, epigenetic silencing of
  tumor suppressor genes occurs through DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation,
  which are mediated by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deactylase (HDAC),
  respectively. Targeted agents listed in the light purple boxes inhibit the central
  pathogenetic pathways at specific points of action and potentially have a therapeutic
  impact on melanoma. Ac, acetylation (of Histone, Hi); cut, cutaneous; Me, methylation
  (of DNA); TF, transcription factor.
