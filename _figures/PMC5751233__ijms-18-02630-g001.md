caption: 'Putative biosynthetic pathway leading to triterpene saponins in Centella
  asiatica. The precursors, β-amyrin and α-amyrin, are converted by a series of oxidative
  reactions to oleanene- and ursane-type aglycones, respectively. In the ursane-type
  triterpenoid pathway, asiatic acid is converted by UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs)
  to asiaticoside. The following enzymes are represented: bAS, β-amyrin synthase;
  MFS, multifunctional triterpene synthase; CYP716A83, C-28 oxidase; CYPs, cytochrome
  P450 monooxygenases; UGT73AH1, 28-O-glucosytransferase.'
