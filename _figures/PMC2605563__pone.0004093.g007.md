caption: Arrows indicate activation of the signaling pathway; the “┤” signs indicate
  pathway inhibition. Exposure to Tat alone increases IκB phosphorylation/degradation
  and NF-κB transcriptional activity, and additionally increases [Ca2+]i in astrocytes
  . Although morphine treatment alone fails to significantly activate NF-κB in astrocytes,
  in combination with Tat it can potentiate Tat-induced increases in [Ca2+]i at sites
  upstream of NF-κB . How [Ca2+]i affects IκB degradation in the present study is
  uncertain (?), but may involve increased oxidative stress , and decreased proteasome
  activity.
