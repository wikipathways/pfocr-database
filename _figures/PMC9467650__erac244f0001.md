caption: 'The involvement of TaMYB31 in benzoxazinoid biosynthesis in wheat. The biosynthetic
  pathway of benzoxazinoids (BXDs) in monocot crop species. Genes that were functionally
  characterized in maize and wheat are written in blue, genes that to date had just
  been identified in maize are written in gray. The first step of BXD synthesis is
  catalyzed by the indole synthase BX1, which converts indole-3-glycerol phosphate
  to indole. Afterwards, the four cytochrome P450 monooxygenases BX2–BX5 oxidize indole
  to the simplest BXD DIBOA, which is subsequently converted to various storage forms
  by a series of glycosylation, hydroxylation and methylation reactions (BX6–BX14).
  Glycosylated BXDs can be deglycosylated by β-glucosidases on demand.  demonstrated
  the involvement of TaMYB31, whose transcription is induced upon both abiotic and
  biotic stresses, in BXD biosynthesis in wheat by activating the promoters of the
  BXD biosynthesis genes BX1 and BX4. Abbreviations: IGP, indole-3-glycerol phosphate;
