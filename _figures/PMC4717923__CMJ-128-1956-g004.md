caption: Co-expression network composed with differentially expressed transcriptomes.
  (a) Co-expression network composed with differentially expressed microRNAs and their
  correlated genes (Pearson's correlation coefficient minimum of 0.99). (b) Co-expression
  network composed with differentially expressed lncRNAs and their correlated genes
  (Pearson's correlation coefficient minimum of 0.99). (c) KEGG pathway analysis is
  a functional analysis that maps genes to pathways. The “Foxo Signaling Pathway”
  shows modulation in apoptotic signatures and may associate with onset of avascular
  osteonecrosis.
