caption: Schematic representation of the potential molecular mechanisms by which AP
  modulates UVB radiation-induced responses in keratinocytes. UVB radiation exposure
  induces oxidative stress (ROS), activates the MAPK signaling pathway (ERK1/2 and
  p38 phosphorylation), and increases the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (IL-1β,
  IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2). Furthermore, UVB reduces the expression of the transcription
  factors HIF-1α and PPARγ, which could contribute to the disruption of key metabolic
  pathways, such as glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism.
  AP treatment attenuated UVB-induced ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation, decreased the
  expression of inflammatory genes, and restored HIF-1α and PPARγ levels, thereby
  promoting the restoration of metabolic balance. UVB also reduced cell migration
  in the scratch assay, an effect that was reversed by AP, possibly through its anti-inflammatory
  action and the metabolic reprogramming that it induced. The dotted lines indicate
  potential effects or modulations that were not directly confirmed in this study.
  The solid lines indicate the effects experimentally confirmed in this study
