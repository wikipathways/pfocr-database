caption: Schematic diagram outlines a signaling pathway that may mediate ANG II- and
  AA-induced ERK activation and fibronectin synthesis from G protein-coupled receptors
  and receptor tyrosine kinase in rabbit proximal tubule cells consistent with our
  present and previous observations. Both ANG II and AA induce tyrosine phosphorylation
  of the autophosphorylation site and the SH2 domain of c- Src. However, ANG II, but
  not AA, leads to Gβγ-dependent c-Src activation, leading to association of Src kinase
  with EGFR via the SH2 domain. The association of c-Src (through Src SH2 domain)
  with EGFR results in the mutual stimulation of c-Src catalytic activity and enhanced
  phosphorylation of Shc/Grb2/Sos and p21Ras, which leads to the activation of ERK
  and increased fibronectin protein synthesis.
