caption: ROCK signaling pathway. Mechanical signaling acts via the integrin-RhoA-ROCK
  pathway, thereby triggering nuclear localization of the YAP/TAZ co-transcriptional
  activators, which activates a program that favors osteogenic differentiation over
  alternative adipogenic and chondrogenic cell fate. YAP/TAZ, yes-associated protein/transcriptional
  coactivator with PDZ-binding motif; ROCK, Rho-associated coiled-coil containing
  protein kinase; RhoA, Ras Homolog Family Member A.
