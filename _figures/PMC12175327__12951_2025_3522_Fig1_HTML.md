caption: Neutrophils interact with CTCs through both direct and indirect mechanisms.
  Direct interactions occur when CTCs express ligands such as ICAM-1/VCAM-1, CD47,
  MMP-9 and CD44v, which bind to neutrophil surface receptors, including integrins,
  SIRPα, NGAL, and selectins. Additionally, direct interactions can involve the formation
  of microtentacles (McTNs) between neutrophils and CTCs, leading to the formation
  of clusters. Indirect interactions are mediated by CTC-secreted cytokines, such
  as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), CXCL1, interleukin-8
  (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and apolipoprotein
  E (APOE), which regulate the phenotype and activation state of neutrophils to exert
  protumorigenic effects. Notably, neutrophils themselves secrete various cytokines,
  including IL-8, G-CSF, TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-6, EGF, HGF, PDGF, IL-1β, VEGF, IL-1RA,
  and IL-10, which modulate the behavior of CTCs and the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore,
  neutrophils release diverse proteases, such as neutrophil elastase (NE), cathepsin
  G (CG), proteinase 3 (PR3), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and arginase 1 (Arg
  1), which degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulate the activity of growth
  factors, cytokines, and chemokines, facilitating CTCs invasion and extravasation.
  Additionally, neutrophils can form NETs to indirectly capture CTCs. NETs mask surface
  antigens on CTCs, protecting them from natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity
  and macrophage phagocytosis. NETs also activate the TGF-β signaling pathway to induce
  epithelial‒mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CTCs and release proteases or reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) to degrade the ECM and increase vascular permeability, thereby
  promoting CTCs dissemination. Created in BioRender. Su, Y. (2025) https://BioRender.com/h54e244
