caption: Summary of steroidogenic pathways in primary trophoblast cells isolated from
  human term placenta. The arrows are labeled with the metabolizing enzyme isoform
  tested in the study. Placental trophoblast cells express the enzymatic machinery
  necessary for the synthesis, metabolism, and secretion of several steroids. Nonetheless,
  the relative and absolute enzyme expression differs and is indicated by the blue
  color intensity (lighter color depicting lower expression). Identified steroid species
  synthesized de novo and released by trophoblast cells are highlighted in green.
  Metabolites whose concentrations were below the detection limits are highlighted
  in yellow, whereas steroids not measured in this study are depicted in italics.
  We also detected the gene expression of enzymes associated with the androgen backdoor
  pathway, but their functional activity in primary cells remains to be determined.
