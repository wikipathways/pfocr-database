caption: Blood flow results in a cell free layer near the wall that is enriched in
  platelets due to margination. Exposure of matrix proteins like collagen and bound
  von Willebrand Factor (VWF) results in transient capture of platelets via GPIbα,
  strong activation via GPVI, and firm arrest via integrin activation. Calcium mobilization
  is central to platelet activation and drives shape change, integrin activation,
  dense granule release of ADP and serotonin (5HT), and cyclooxygenase-1 dependent
  thromboxane (TXA2) synthesis. Platelet deposition and autocrine-driven aggregation
  typically proceeds thrombin generation which is driven by plaque-derived tissue
  factor (TF) and potentially by contact pathway engagement of FXIIa and FXIa via
  wall derived activators or platelet polyphosphate. Thrombin is a potent platelet
  activator and at higher concentrations drives fibrin formation. In extreme flow
  typical of stenosis, shear forces can elongate VWF (particularly the large VWF)
  and drive shear induced platelet aggregation (SIPA). Soluble mediators such as ADP,
  thromboxane, thrombin, and fibrin mononmer are all diffusive and elute from the
  clot into the flow field as they are convected downstream. Shear forces can cause
  platelet erosion from the clot or larger scale embolism. (2°, secondary)
