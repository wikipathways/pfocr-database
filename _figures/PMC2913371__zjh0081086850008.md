caption: A signaling model for the effect of morphine on hypoxia-induced HIF-1α. Based
  on our current findings we propose that morphine alters the hypoxic activation of
  the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Hypoxia increased p38 MAPK activity, resulting in
  decreased HIF-1α hydroxylation and increased phosphorylation leading to an increased
  HIF-1α nuclear accumulation. Morphine treatment reduced hypoxia induced MAPK p38
  and thus HIF-1 activation.
