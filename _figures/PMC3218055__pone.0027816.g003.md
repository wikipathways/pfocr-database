caption: 'The network was generated by Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software using
  the list of differentially expressed proteins identified by 2-D DIGE/MS analysis.
  Individual proteins are represented as nodes, and the different shapes of the nodes
  represent the functional class of the proteins. The edges define the relationships
  of the nodes: the arrowheads indicate the direction of the interaction.'
