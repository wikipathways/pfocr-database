caption: Hypoxia pathway proteins-microRNA-phosphodiesterase crosstalk in steroidogenesis
  regulation. Hypoxia regulates steroid production through either direct binding of
  HIFs to the HREs in the promoter of steroidogenic enzymes or by a crosstalk of HIFs
  with other regulators such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and phosphodiesterases (PDE) (see
  further). The expression and activity of steroidogenic enzymes as well as steroidogenesis
  are regulated by miRNAs and PDE. MiRNAs and PDE are also regulated by each other,
  which ultimately impacts steroidogenesis either positively or negatively. MiRNAs
  may also target Hif1α. Hypoxia is able to alter the expression and activity of miRNAs
  and PDE, which ultimately affects steroid production
