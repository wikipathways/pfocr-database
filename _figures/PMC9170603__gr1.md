caption: miRNA biogenesis. The majority of genes, which encode the miRNAs, are in
  promoter regions of intronic genes. Firstly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the miRNA
  genes to the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) form. Drosha, a type III RNase, incorporated
  with the cofactor protein DGCR8, binds to the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcript
  and cleaves it, in the nucleus to form precursors-miRNAs. The pre-miRNAs are exported
  to the cytosol by Exportin 5 (whereas in the drosha independent pathway pri-miR
  are exported into the cytosol by Exportin 1 and then cleaved to pre-miRNAs form),
  and subsequently cleaved by Dicer (a type III RNase) to miRNA duplex form incorporation
  with TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP). The argonaute (AGO) family and its associated
  protein mediate the processing of the miRNA duplex. After unwinding and strand selection,
  the mature miRNA can target recognition. Next, mature miRNA binds to the RISC and
  so it is capable of targeting the mRNAs via complementary sites and results in translational
  repression or mRNA degradation.
