caption: 'Overview of the complement cascade and its regulators. Complement activation
  can be initiated by the classical pathway that is triggered by cross-linking, cell-bound
  subclasses of IgG and IgM antibodies (a), the mannose binding lectin (MBL) pathway
  triggered by carbohydrates present on bacteria surface (b), and the alternative
  pathway that undergoes spontaneous activation on cell surfaces (c). All three pathways
  converge into one key amplification step to form multimeric C3 convertases which
  cleave C3 to C3a and C3b, the latter initiating formation of the C5 convertase.
  Subsequently C5 cleavage yields C5a and C5b, ultimately forming the membrane attack
  complex (MAC, C5b-9) on the target cells. Complement activation/amplification is
  restrained on self-cells by several membrane-bound and soluble regulatory proteins.
  Surface-expressed regulators include Decay Accelerating Factor (DAF or CD55, accelerates
  the decay of cell-surface assembled C3 convertases), CD46 [membrane cofactor protein,
  MCP, co-factor for factor I (soluble) that inactivates C3b to iC3b], Crry, the murine
  homologue of CD46 that has both decay accelerating and co-factor activities, complement
  receptor 1, (CR1, CD35, binds to C3b/C4b and has co-factor activity) and CD59 (protectin,
  inhibits formation of the MAC). Factor H is a soluble complement regulator that
  exhibits both decay accelerating and co-factor activity. C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) disassociates
  the C1qrs complex (among other actions) limiting classical pathway activation. C1-INH:
  C1 inhibitor; CR1: complement receptor 1 (CD35); DAF: decay accelerating factor
  (CD55), fB: factor B; fD: factor D; fH: factor H; fI: factor I; fP: properdin; MAC:
  membrane attack complex C5b-9; MBL: mannose-binding lectin; MASP: mannan-binding
  serine peptidase.'
