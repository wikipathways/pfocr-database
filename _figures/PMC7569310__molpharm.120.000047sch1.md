caption: Scheme outlining the integrated ERS response, common stimuli, and common
  cellular responses. The overall ERS pathway is highlighted in blue, with bold text
  specifying the biomarkers that were used as indices of ERS in this study. The various
  ERS-inducing agents that were used are listed in the gray box. BiP, binding immunoglobulin
  protein; eIF2, eukaryotic initiation factor 2; p-eIF2, phosphorylated eukaryotic
  initiation factor 2; UPR, unfolded protein response.
