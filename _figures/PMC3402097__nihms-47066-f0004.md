caption: Upon entry into G1, cyclin D/cdk4 and cyclin D/cdk6 complexes phosphorylate
  the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), allowing release of transcription factor E2F family
  members. A major role for E2F in cell cycle progression is to upregulate cyclin
  E/cdk2. In a parallel pathway, upon stimulation of cells in the resting (G0) state
  with growth factors, LSF is immediately and quantitatively phosphorylated by Erk,
  a central kinase in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway. LSF
  is subsequently phosphorylated by cdk2, as well. One major target gene of active
  LSF is the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene. TS is essential for DNA replication in
  S phase. Expression of dnLSF prevents binding of LSF to target sites, and the lack
  of TS causes cells to undergo apoptosis. E2F, and presumably LSF, target additional
  genes for regulation during cell cycle progression into S phase. If growth factors
  are removed from the cellular environment, cells exit the cell cycle in G1, returning
  to the G0 state.
