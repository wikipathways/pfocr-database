  expressed >0.95). CM, Chorismate mutase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonialyase; C4H, cinnamate
  4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase;
  CCR, cinnamoyl CoA reductase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerise; F3H,
  flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3'H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; FS1, flavone synthase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydro-flavonol 4-reductase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin;
  ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase. Adapted from Winkel-Shirley
