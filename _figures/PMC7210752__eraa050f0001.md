caption: Proposed model for the regulation of pistil growth and ovule primordium initiation.
  A gynoecium of Arabidopsis is shown on the left while the image on the right depicts
  ovule primordia; in the centre, the interconnected gene network that regulates the
  two processes is shown. Auxin, through ETT, regulates gynoecium fusion and elongation
  by repressing IND, HECs, and SPT, which in turn modulate polarization of the auxin
  efflux carrier PIN1 via repressing PID. CK positively regulates PIN1 expression.
  In particular, the CK response mediated by CRFs and ARRs is directly required for
  pistil elongation and indirectly affects ovule primordium initiation. CRF2 regulation
  by MP further integrates the auxin–CK crosstalk. Moreover, MP directly regulates
  CUC1 and CUC2 expression. In turn, CUCs control PIN1 expression and PIN1 protein
  localization, which is required for correct ovule primordium development. CUCs positively
  influence the CK pathway by transcriptionally repressing the CK-inactivating glycosyltransferase
  enzymes (UGTs). ANT, whose expression is controlled by auxin and BRs, is required
  for cell division in ovule primordia. ANT is also regulated by auxin via MP and
  ARGOS. BR signalling also positively affects pistil elongation. GA has a negative
  effect on ovule number, but its connection with other hormones remains to be addressed.
