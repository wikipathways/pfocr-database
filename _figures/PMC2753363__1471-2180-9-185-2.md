caption: Metabolic Map of Energy and Cytotoxin Production. Proteins catalyzing each
  step are shown by their P. gingivalis PGN designation. Red up arrows indicate increased
  levels upon internalization, green down arrows decreased levels, and yellow squares
  no statistical change. Acetyl-CoA appears as a substrate and product at multiple
  points and is shown in purple. Metabolites and metabolic precursors discussed in
  the text are shown in bold.
