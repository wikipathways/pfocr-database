caption: Diagrammatic representation of known mechanisms of action of lithium in endocrine
  cancers. Lithium treatment inactivates GSK-3β by phosphorylating it. Inactivation
  of GSK-3β can promote cell death by increasing the expression of cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitors (p21, p15, p27) that promotes cell cycle arrest and/or by increasing
  the expression of transcription factors (NR4A1) which induce expression of pro-apoptotic
  genes. Depending upon the cell types and concentration, lithium can also promote
  cellular proliferation by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and its downstream
  mediators which have the ability to regulate the expression of various genes that
  play important role in cell growth and survival (e.g., Cyclin D1, TBX1). Lithium
  treatment can also promoter cell differentiation by increasing the expression of
  tissue specific transcription factors (TTF-1, PAX8). Also, lithium treatment at
  low concentration provide protective effects to the cells against toxic compounds
  by inhibiting the expression of BAX (pro-apoptotic gene) and promoting the expression
  of BCL2 (anti-apoptotic gene). Besides these, there might be other mechanisms of
  action involved which are currently unknown.
