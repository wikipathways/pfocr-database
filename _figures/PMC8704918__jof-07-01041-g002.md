caption: 'Pkc1 and Slt2 connections with the DNA damage response. This scheme represents
  the possible roles of Pkc1 and Slt2 related to the response to genotoxic stress.
  Pkc1 participates in the optimal activation of the DNA integrity checkpoint upstream
  or downstream of the Mec1/Tel1 apical kinases. Mec1/Tel1, in turn, mediate phosphorylation
  of Pkc1 by Hrr25 kinase after DNA damage. This regulation is involved in the expression
  of the RNR3 gene. Pkc1 is also linked to nucleotide biosynthesis, by regulating
  the CTP synthetase. Slt2 is activated by genotoxic stress through the inactivation
  of phosphatase Msg5. Possible Slt2 effectors include: Swe1, which is important for
  bud morphogenesis and G2/M arrest, whose DNA-damage induced degradation depends
  on Slt2; Cyclin C, an inducer of programmed cell death responsible for the hypersensitivity
  of slt2 mutants to genotoxic treatments; Whi7, a Start repressor regulated by Slt2
  whose overexpression suppresses the checkpoint mutation; and Mrc1, a DNA integrity
  checkpoint adaptor protein that is regulated by Slt2 to stop DNA replication under
  certain conditions. Although the details of most of these connections are unknown,
  a scenario is beginning to emerge in which Pkc1 and Slt2 are important players in
  the response to genotoxic stress.'
