caption: Schematic illustration of Ro inhibiting autophagic flux and sensitizing chemoresistant
  esophageal cancer cells to 5-Fu-induced cell death. Upon 5-Fu treatment, autophagy
  is activated to serve as a prosurvival function partly through the selective degradation
  of CHEK1 to assure timely release of cell cycle arrest after DNA repair. When the
  fusion process of autophagosome and lysosome is blocked by Ro via the ESR2-NCF1-ROS
  pathway, high level of CHEK1 persists, leading to accumulation of DNA damage and
  aberrant cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Genes important for DNA replication are
  also downregulated by Ro. As a consequence, 5-Fu-mediated cell death is enhanced
  by Ro in a apoptosis-independent and autophagy-associated manner.
