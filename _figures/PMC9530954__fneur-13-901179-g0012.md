caption: This schematic diagram describes the clinical characteristics, biological
  significance, and hub genes of three subgroups of AD. Subgroup I showed high CDR,
  NFT, and NPD, which were closely related to virus infection. Furthermore, subgroup
  I showed characteristic genes associated with hypoxia factors and angiogenesis factors.
  Subgroup II, low CDR, NFT, and high NPD, had minor synaptic damage. In subgroup
  II, spinous dendritic development and synaptic plasticity were upregulated, axonal
  vesicle transport and synaptic transmission were upregulated, autophagy and phagosome
  acidification were increased, and postsynaptic membrane transmitter receptors (especially
  NMDA receptors and AMPA receptors associated with long-term potentiation, post-scaffold
  protein PSD95) were upregulated, and intracellular signaling was active. Subgroup
  III presented high CDR, NFT, and NPD, which was similar to familial AD due to PSEN1-specific
  amplification. Subgroup III showed TGF-beta and active Hippo signaling pathway,
  self-renewal of neural stem cells, the proliferation of neural progenitor cells,
  differentiation and activation of glial cells, etc. We speculated that these changes
  in subgroup III were cross-talk.
