caption: Schematic of the fundamental aspects of the DNA damage response pathway.
  DNA damage triggers activation of ATM and ATR, which in turn activate p53, CHK1
  and CHK2. Activated p53 signals an apoptotic pathway through BAX and caspase-3-mediated
  PARP cleavage. p53 also signals through p21, cyclin-CDK and RB protein to cause
  cell cycle arrest. CHK1 and CHK2 can signal through BRCA2 to trigger DNA repair,
  or through the inhibition of cdc25 to cause cell cycle arrest. CHK1 and CHK2 are
  also able to activate p53. All signaling events in the DNA damage response ultimately
  serve to increase genomic stability in the cell.
