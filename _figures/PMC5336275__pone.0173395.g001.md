caption: (A) The current Sox pathway model. The pathway cycle starts with an unmodified
  SoxYZ Cys side chain (top of the panel). Released electrons are transferred to cytochrome
  c. SoxYZ conjugates with longer chain sulfur species are generated by competition
  between SoxAX and SoxCD for SoxY(S)Z (bottom of the panel). SoxYZ species that have
  been identified in extracts of thiosulfate-grown P. pantotrophus [] are marked with
  an asterisk (*). (B) A revised model for the Sox pathway. The canonical Sox pathway
  model shown in (A) is modified to accommodate the results of the current work. The
  reactions in gray allow the activation of unconjugated SoxYZ.
