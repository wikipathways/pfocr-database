caption: Signaling kinases involved in regulation of TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-6 in Kupffer
  cells. A TLR signal induced by LPS has been shown to activate p42/p44 MAPK (ERK
  1/2), p38 MAPK, PI3-K/PKB, and the tyrosine kinases Src and JAK-2 in macrophages
  (, , ). These signaling kinases are also important for Kupffer cell responses to
  LTA. Each box contains signaling kinases clearly involved in regulating the release
  of the cytokine shown below. The figure is based on the effects of specific signaling
  kinase inhibitors obtained in this report. Tyr-K, tyrosine class kinases; Ser/Thr-K,
  serine-threonine class kinases.
