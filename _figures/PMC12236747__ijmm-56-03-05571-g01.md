caption: Inhibition of the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Sleep deprivation
  impairs the gut by reducing the expression of tight junction proteins (occludin
  and ZO-1, increasing intestinal permeability and allowing the leakage of bacterial
  lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, pathogen-associated molecules and inflammatory
  factors into the bloodstream. This activates the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, triggering
  systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation. However, gut microbiota-derived metabolites
  can inhibit the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Figure support was provided
  by Figdraw. ZO-1, zonula occludens-1; TLR, Toll-like receptor; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  factor 88; IKK, IκB kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PAMPs,
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns; IL, interleukin; SCFA, short chain fatty
  acid
