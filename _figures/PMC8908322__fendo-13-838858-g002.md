caption: Function of the AR signaling pathway in SC proliferation, maturation and
  BTB integrity. By activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, the AR can promote SC proliferation
  by downregulating CK18 and upregulating Ki67 (shown in orange). MicroRNAs, including
  miR124a, miRNA130a and miRNA762, can inhibit SC proliferation by binding to the
  3’-UTR of Ar mRNA (also shown in orange). AR dimers can bind to the AREs of Rhox5
  and Amh to promote the expression of Rhox5 and inhibit the expression of Amh, leading
  to SC maturation (blue). Binding to the ARE of TUBB3 induces tubular restructuring
  and achieve proper SC nuclei location, another process that is important in SC maturation.
  Ube2b, activated by the classical signaling pathway, is able to induce GPI-anchor
  synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation (shown in red). Both the classical and the
  non-classical signaling pathways are necessary for BTB integrity. The expression
  of Claudin13 and tight junction protein 2 isoform 3 (ZO-2)is upregulated by classical
  AR signaling, together with upregulated expression of Claudin1, Claudin5, Claudin11
  and tPA by non-classical signaling. These molecules regulate BTB dynamics (shown
  in pink) and TJ dynamics (shown in green). In addition, AR dimerization binds to
  the promoter of GATA-2 to inhibit its expression. GATA-2 can induce Wt1 expression,
  while Wt1 inhibits the protein expression level of connexin 43 to regulate GJ dynamics.
  Ouabain increases the expression of connexin 43 via the ATP1A1/Src/EGFR/ERK/CREB
  signaling pathway (shown in purple).
