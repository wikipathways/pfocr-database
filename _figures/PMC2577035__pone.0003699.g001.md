caption: Linolenic acid synthesised by fatty acid desaturases (FAD) is released from
  chloroplast lipid in response to a stress such as wounding or attack by pests and
  pathogens, and it serves as substrate for jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis. 12-oxophytodienoic
  acid (OPDA) is sufficient for defence against pests and pathogens. Key enzymes in
  JA synthesis are allene oxide synthase (AOS) and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 3
  (OPR3). Lower case gene symbols indicate mutants used in this study. JAR1 couples
  JA to an amino acid which activates a signal pathway, involving COI1, which also
  contributes to defence. Specific wound responses are activated by a COI1-dependent
  signal that removes JAZ proteins that suppress the transcription factor MYC2/JIN1,
  leading to its activation.
