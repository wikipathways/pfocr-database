caption: '(A) FA signaling is mediated by phosphorylation: the illustration of localization
  of pTyr in an attached human fibroblast highlights FAs around the cell periphery.
  (B) Src-induced phosphorylation of FAK modulates adhesion dynamics, cell migration,
  survival, and anchorage-independent growth. Phosphorylated FAK results in actin
  stress fiber assembly and focal adhesion via activation of calpain, likely by linking
  calpain to the ERK/MAPK pathway. The Src-phosphorylated FAK also promotes cell survival
  and anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells. Adapted from Ref. . Copyright
