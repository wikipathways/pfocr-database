caption: 'Interplay of TrkB and GR signaling pathways in the CNS. In the presence
  of BDNF, the TrkB receptor homodimerizes and initiates several signaling pathways
  promoting neuronal survival, growth and differentiation (Akt and MAPK). Activation
  of the PLCy pathway leads to CAMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription
  factor CREB. In presence of a low amount of GC, the CREB-coactivator CRTC2 is dephosphorylated
  and translocates to the nucleus and binds to phospho-CREB. The phospho-CREB-CRTC2
  complex binds at the CRH promoter and drives basal CRH expression in the PVN. Upon
  occurrence of ELS, the HPA axis signaling pathway is activated, yielding increasing
  GC levels. GC pass the plasma membrane and enter in to the cytosol and binds to
  GR, thereby inducing homodimerization (GR-GC complex). The GR-GC complex targets
  the BDNF promoter and drives basal BDNF production. Exceeding GC levels evoke a
  translocation of the CREB-coactivator CRTC2 to the cytosol and its phosphorylation,
  thereby inactivating CREB-dependent CRH production. Thus, the GR and TrkB pathways
  are calibrated and a specific balance of both GC and BDNF levels is necessary during
  neurodevelopment to keep homeostasis. Abbreviations: CNS, central nervous system;
  TrkB, tyrosine kinase receptor type 2; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; CAMKII, Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent
  Protein Kinase II; CREB, cAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein; CRTC2, CREB Regulated
  Transcription Coactivator 2; ELS, early life stress; GC, glucocorticoids; BDNF,
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; HPA axis,
  hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis.'
