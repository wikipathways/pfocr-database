caption: RSV increases the transcriptional activity of Nrf2. Regulation of the expression
  of antioxidant genes is critical for controlling oxidative stress and maintaining
  physiological homeostasis. Of the various regulatory pathways, the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1
  axis is the most important regulator of Nrf2 activity []. The Nrf2 pathway is essential
  for modulating the inflammatory responses and oxidative stress []. Mechanistically,
  RSV decouples the connection between Nrf2 and its inhibitor Keap1 by increasing
  the interaction between p62 and Nrf2 []. This leads to increased Nrf2 translocation
  into the nucleus, resulting in increased transcriptional activity []. Under normal
  physiological conditions, Keap1 blocks Nrf2 by retaining Nrf2 in the cytoplasm,
  thereby targeting it for proteasomal degradation. However, oxidative stress affects
  the structure of Keap1, making it incapable of inhibiting Nrf2 and retaining it
  in the cytoplasm []. Nrf2 may also be activated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, particularly in response to RSV
  []. RSV can also activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway by boosting p38 MAPK and SIRT1/FOXO1
  signaling. Therefore, RSV enhances Nrf2 expression and potentiates Nrf2 signaling
  by changing Nrf2 mediators and its nuclear translocation through blockage of Keap1
  []. Figure generated with Biorender (https://biorender.com/accessed on 6 September
