caption: Curcumin, as a multitarget compound, induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest
  in neuroblastoma (NB) cells through the modulation of PTEN–Akt, NF-κB, and p53 signaling;
  mitochondrial dysfunction; and caspase activation. (A) Intracellular signaling mechanisms
  within NB cells favor proliferation. The proliferative Akt, NF-κB, and ERK 1/2 pathways,
  as well as the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Survivin proteins, are active and upregulated.
  Apoptotic signals via mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, p53, and
  caspases are downregulated. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p21 and p27) are
  inactive, allowing for cell cycle progression. (B) Curcumin modulates intracellular
  signaling in NB cells in favor of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Curcumin upregulates
  PTEN, which in turn downregulates Akt and NF-κB and upregulates FOXO3a and Fas pathway
  signaling. Moreover, curcumin-induced ROS generation elevates intracellular ROS
  levels and supports both FOXO3a and p53nsignaling. Together, p53n, Fas pathway,
  and Akt signaling, along with mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization,
  promote the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol, where
  it supports caspase activation. Mitochondrial dysfunction also involves the downregulation
  of Hsp60, which ultimately leads to the downregulation of Survivin—a protein that
  ordinarily inhibits caspase activity. Caspase 3 cleaves PARP-1, causing apoptosis,
  while FOXO3a and p53 activate cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, which induce cell
  cycle arrest.

  description: Curcumin, as a multitarget compound, induces apoptosis and cell cycle
    arrest in neuroblastoma (NB) cells through the modulation of PTEN–Akt, NF-κB,
    and p53 signaling; mitochondrial dysfunction; and caspase activation. (A) Intracellular
    signaling mechanisms within NB cells favor proliferation. The proliferative Akt,
    NF-κB, and ERK 1/2 pathways, as well as the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Survivin proteins,
    are active and upregulated. Apoptotic signals via mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome
    c release, p53, and caspases are downregulated. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors
    (p21 and p27) are inactive, allowing for cell cycle progression. (B) Curcumin
    modulates intracellular signaling in NB cells in favor of apoptosis and cell cycle
    arrest. Curcumin upregulates PTEN, which in turn downregulates Akt and NF-κB and
    upregulates FOXO3a and Fas pathway signaling. Moreover, curcumin-induced ROS generation
    elevates intracellular ROS levels and supports both FOXO3a and p53nsignaling.
    Together, p53n, Fas pathway, and Akt signaling, along with mitochondrial membrane
    potential (MMP) depolarization, promote the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria
    into the cytosol, where it supports caspase activation. Mitochondrial dysfunction
    also involves the downregulation of Hsp60, which ultimately leads to the downregulation
    of Survivin—a protein that ordinarily inhibits caspase activity. Caspase 3 cleaves
    PARP-1, causing apoptosis, while FOXO3a and p53 activate cyclin-dependent kinase
    inhibitors, which induce cell cycle arrest.
