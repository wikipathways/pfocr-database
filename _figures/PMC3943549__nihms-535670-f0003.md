caption: Graph shows entry point of gluconeogenic substrates, such as lactate, glycerol
  or amino acids. Both PEPCKs synthesize PEP from OAA that can feed the TCA cycle
  (anaplerosis) or serve for various biosynthetic processes (cataplerosis), such as
  gluconoegenesis. Alanine and glutamine are the main amino acids in the blood and
  arise during starvation from muscular protein breakdown (proteolysis). Likewise,
  fatty acids and glycerol are released from triglyceride breakdown (lipolysis) during
  fasting. Unlike glycerol, acetyl-CoA (fatty acid breakdown) does not contribute
  to cataplerotic OAA or PEP production or other gluconeogenic intermediates. Glycerol
  and glucose enter via glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Lactate forms in the muscle during
  anaerobic glycolysis and enters the gluconeogenic pathway via pyruvate and is the
  main gluconeogenic precursor in the kidney and liver.
