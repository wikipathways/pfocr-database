caption: GPCR signaling activates GEF-H1 by releasing it from microtubules. GEF-H1
  in turn promotes an increase in cellular RhoA activity. At the TGN, active RhoA
  binds to its effector PLCε, which hydrolyzes PtdIns(4)P to generate DAG and IP2.
  DAG recruits and activates nPKCs and PKD, which gets further activated by nPKC-mediated
  phosphorylation. The activation of PKD by RhoA is counterbalanced by the RhoGAP
  DLC3. Active PKD recruits Rab8 to TGN membranes and induces the fission of Rab6-positive
  vesicles containing cargo such as TNFα destined for FA-targeted transport along
  microtubules.
