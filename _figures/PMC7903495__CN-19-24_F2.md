caption: 'Stx cellular pathway, action and therapeutic strategies to block it. Black
  arrows show Stx cellular pathway and action: binding of Stx to Gb3, endocytosis
  process, the retrograde pathway to trans-Golgi network and endoplasmic reticulum.
  A1 subunit reaches cytosolic ribosomes, inhibits protein synthesis and leads to
  apoptosis. Red blunt arrows show specific Stx pathway and action blocked by each
  therapeutic approach. (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure is available
  in the electronic copy of the article).'
