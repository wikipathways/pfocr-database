caption: Model for the high-fidelity DNA synthesis by saPolX. The core polymerase
  domain, PHP domain and linker connecting these two domains are displayed in blue,
  orange and green colors, respectively. The schematic shows the interplay between
  the 5′–3′ polymerization and 3′–5′ exonuclease activities residing in polymerase
  and PHP domains, respectively. saPolXc incorporates either correctly paired nucleotide
  or mismatched nucleotide on gapped DNA substrate generated during BER pathway. The
  correctly filled DNA substrate is sealed by the ligase enzyme in the subsequent
  step. The DNA substrates with misincorporated deoxyribo-, ribo- and oxidized nucleotides
  are directed towards the PHP domain. The PHP domain removes these bases and redirects
  the gapped DNA substrate to the polymerase domain to repair it correctly.
