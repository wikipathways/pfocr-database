caption: (a) Distribution of GLUT1, the main glucose transporter of the retina. (b)
  Schematic representation of oxidative phosphorylation, anaerobic glycolysis, and
  aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). In the presence of oxygen, differentiated tissues
  metabolize glucose to pyruvate via glycolysis. Pyruvate is then metabolized in mitochondria
  by oxidative phosphorylation. The electron transport chain requires oxygen to completely
  oxidize glucose. When oxygen is scarce, cells redirect pyruvate away from mitochondria
  to produce lactate (anaerobic glycolysis). Anaerobic glycolysis allows glycolysis
  to continue by cycling NADH back to NAD+but limits ATP production compared to oxidative
  phosphorylation. Warburg observed that cancer cells convert most glucose to lactate,
  irrespective of the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis). The ‘Warburg effect’
  is also observed in non cancerous tissues, such as the retina, which, though non
  proliferative have continuous replacement of outer segments and behave metabolically
  as “proliferative” cells. Aerobic glycolysis which is less energy efficient may
  provide building blocks required for growth. In proliferating cells, glucose is
  in part diverted to biosynthetic pathways upstream of pyruvate production. (c) This
  schematic summarizes glucose metabolism including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation,
  the pentose phosphate pathway, and glutamine metabolism in “proliferating” cells.
  Growth factor signaling, such as VEGF, leads to both tyrosine kinase and AKT/PI3K
  activation. In doing so, growth factors promote glucose uptake and flux through
  the early part of glycolysis, while inhibiting the late steps; they force glycolytic
  intermediates towards biosynthetic pathways of macromolecules essential for cell
  “proliferation” and NADPH production. Metabolic pathways are labeled in purple,
  and the enzymes controlling critical metabolic steps are shown in blue boxes. Figure
