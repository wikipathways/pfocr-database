  spiny projection neuron. (A) Dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) are coupled to the stimulatory
  subtype of GTP binding protein (GolfGTP), and lead to production of cAMP via adenylyl
  cyclase (AC). cAMP activates Exchange Protein Activated by cAMP (Epac) and protein
  kinase A (PKA). Both metabotropic glutamate (mGluR1/5) receptors and acetylcholine
  muscarinic type 1 (m1) receptors are coupled to Gq subtype of GTP binding protein
  (GqGTP) which activates phospholipase C (PLC), which produes of diacylgycerol (DAG),
  which is a substrate for diacylclyercol lipase (Dgl) and also activates calcium
  bound protein Kinase C (PKC). Acetylcholine also activates muscarinic type 4 (m4)
  receptors, which are coupled to inhibitory subtype of GTP binding protein (GiGTP)
  and inhibit the production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase. Calcium (Ca) binds to various
  buffers including calmodulin which can activate protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin;
  PP2B), phosphodisterase 1B (PDE1B) to degrade cAMP, and calcium calmodulin dependent
  protein kinase type 2 (CamKII). There are several interactions between these pathways:
  CamKII phosphorylates and inactivates diacylclyercol lipase, which produces the
  endocannbinoid 2 arachidonylgycerol (2AG). PKA phosphorylation of DARPP32 inhibits
  the protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) that dephosphorylates CamKII. PLC: phospholipase
  C, PIP2: phosphoinositol bis-phosphate, PP2A: protein phosphatase 2A. (B) Morphology
  used for simulations, visualized using NeuroRDViz.py (https://www.gihub.com/neuroRD/NeuroRDviz).
  Most results used the 2 μm dendrite with single spine; simulations on spatial specifity
  used the 20 μm long dendrite with 10 spines (some attached to the same voxel). In
  both morphologies, the submembrane voxels are 0.1 μm high, the next layer of voxels
  are 0.2 μm high, and the central core voxels are 0.3 μm high. Diffusion is axial
  in the spines and two dimensional in the dendrite.'
