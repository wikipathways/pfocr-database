caption: IL-15 and its therapeutic applications. (a) The structure and downstream
  signaling of IL-15 and its receptor complex. IL-15 is trans-presented on antigen-presenting
  cells by IL-15Rα, which interacts with the β chain (IL-2/15Rβ) and common γ chain
  (γc) complex on effector cells. Upon activation, the β and γc receptor triggers
  the intracellular signaling of the Janus kinase pathway, which stimulates the signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins downstream. The phosphorylated
  STATs relocate to the nucleus, modifying gene expression. (b) IL-15 derivatives
  and their structure. From left, Escherichia coli-derived IL-15 monomer (sch rhIL-15),
  Receptor-Linker-IL-15 fusion protein consisting of IL-15 linked to the sushi domain
  of IL-15Rα (RLI), IL-15 heterodimer with soluble IL-15Rα (hetIL-15/NIZ985), another
  form of hetIL-15 where C-terminus of IL-15Rα is linked to the Fc region of human
  IgG1 (hetIL-15Fc), N72D mutant and human Il-15Rα sushi domain-Fc fusion protein
  (N-803/ALT-803) and polyethylene glycol-conjugate of rhIL-15 (NKTR-255). (c) IL-15
  armored immune cells. The starting population of T, NK, γδT, iNKT cells collected
  from healthy donors are engineered and differentiated into therapeutic cells armored
  with soluble IL-15 (sIL-15) and CAR, or membrane-bound IL-15 (mbIL-15) and CAR.
  Co-expressing IL-15 or mbIL-15 with CAR enhances immune cells proliferation and
  expansion, increases anti-tumor activity and effectiveness, improves viability and
  cellular fitness, and increases stem memory.
