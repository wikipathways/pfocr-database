caption: The extrinsic cell death pathway is typically triggered by members of the
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of death receptor ligands, comprising TNF itself,
  Fas ligand, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Hepatocytes express
  high levels of death receptors, possibly allowing efficient eradication of hepatocytes
  infected by hepatotropic viruses. Death receptor–mediated apoptosis is a key feature
  of many types of liver diseases. The high susceptibility of hepatocytes to death
  receptor–induced cell death is highlighted by the fact that Fas agonistic antibodies
  trigger rapid apoptosis in murine and human hepatocytes as well as acute liver failure
  and death in mice. and  In the liver, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are linked,
  because hepatocytes as “type 2 cells” require mitochondrial amplification via cytochrome
  c release-mediated activation of caspase-3 for cell death execution  ().
