caption: Suppositional pathway of AT together with PS-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells.
  AT together with PS induced mitochondrial signaling pathway-mediated apoptosis in
  HepG2 cells. ROS was also involved in this pathway. Short upward arrows symbolize
  the up-regulated mRNA or protein content, while short downward arrows symbolize
  the down-regulated mRNA or protein content. Solid lines symbolize direct action,
  while dotted lines symbolize possible actions.
