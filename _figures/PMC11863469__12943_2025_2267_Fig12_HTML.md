caption: Notch signaling in GBM progression. Notch signaling is activated through
  ligand-receptor interactions, where the Delta ligand binds to the Notch receptor.
  This binding triggers Notch cleavage by ADAM10 and Gamma-secretase, releasing the
  Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD). The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it
  interacts with Co-Repressors (Co-R) and the CSL transcription factor to regulate
  the expression of target genes involved in proliferation, differentiation, and survival.
  In contrast, when NICD is absent, Notch signaling is inhibited, and Co-R and CSL
  complexes suppress gene expression. Dysregulation of this pathway is associated
  with elevated VEGF and pAKT levels and decreased PTEN expression, promoting tumor
  growth. These changes drive increased tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and
  metastasis, contributing to the aggressive behavior of GBM
