caption: The presence of extracellular (or systemic) and intracellular nutrients are
  sensed by mTORC1 and stimulate its activation. In response to insulin, Akt inhibits
  TSC2, thereby allowing Rheb-GTP to accumulate and activate mTORC1. Nutrients and
  other factors influencing the energy status of the cell affect intracellular levels
  of AMP, which activates AMPK. AMPK exerts inhibitory effects on mTORC1 through activation
  of TSC2 and phosphorylation of Raptor. In addition, the presence of intracellular
  amino acids is sensed by mTORC1 through an undefined pathway affecting the Rag GTPases.
  Finally, the two best-characterized direct downstream targets of mTORC1, S6K1/2
  and 4E-BP1, are shown.
