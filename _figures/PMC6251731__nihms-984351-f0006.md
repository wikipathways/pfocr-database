caption: The proteins mapped by IPA to be part of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway are
  presented as gene symbols. The fold changes corresponding to each protein mapped
  to the pathway are calculated using the corresponding protein abundance ratios (MS1
  area from LFQ analysis), defined by the MC or DMC Treatment vs Control (untreated)
  in each sample. Proteins identified by LFQ proteomics are marked with purple while
  their selected fold changes (lower than “−1.4” or higher than “+1.4) are shown inside
  boxes. The protein expression profiles were normalized to cytoplasmic actin by the
  LFQ method built-in PEAKS Q module (version 8.0); green defines the down-regulated
  expression profiles; red defines the up-regulated. Details on the proteins from
  the pathway and their associated expression profiles are included in the .(a)IPA
  predicted effect of DMC in MCF-7. IPA predicted the DMC induced down-regulation
  of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells (IPA calculated activation z score
  for the pathway is “−1.5”, p<0.05). The Akt serine/threonine kinase 1 is predicted
  to have a “−1.462” fold change in DMC treated vs. control, untreated MCF-7.(b) IPA
  predicted effect of DMC in K562. IPA predicted no significant effect for the DMC
  treatment on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in K562 cells (the IPA calculated activation
  z score is +0.832, p>0.05).(c) IPA predicted effect of MC in MCF-7. IPA predicted
  no significant effect for the MC treatment on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in MCF-7cells
  (the IPA calculated activation z score is +0.782, p>0.05).(d) IPA predicted effect
  of MC in K562. IPA predicted no significant effect for the MC treatment on PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway in K562 cells (the IPA calculated activation z score is −0.277,
  p>0.05).
