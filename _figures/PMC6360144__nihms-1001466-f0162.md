caption: 'Calculated structures and relative energies of proposed intermediates in
  the oxidative phase of the catalytic cycle of CcO, from Noodleman and co-workers.
  The pathway from 2H (reduced binuclear center intermediate R) to 6 contains low-energy
  barriers and is overall energetically downhill. The three so-called “true peroxo”
  states (4, 5, and 6) are all calculated to be lower in energy that state 3 (intermediate
  A). Further descriptors of the various calculated intermediates are 2H: {H376H+,
  FeII_CuI, H282H, Y''OH}; 3: {H376H+, FeII–O2_CuI–H2O, H282H, Y''OH}; 4: {H376, H2O
  FeIII–O–O–CuII, H282H, Y''OH}; 5: {H376H+, FeIII–O–O–CuII, H282H, Y''O‒}; 6: {H376H+,
  FeIII–O–OH–CuII, H282H, Y''O‒}; 72: {H376, H2O FeIV=O, H2O–CuII, H282‒, Y''O·•}.
  H376 is a nearby histidine residue with H-bonding interactions with copper ligand
  H283 through an aspartate residue and water molecule. H282 is one of the histidine
  residues bound to Cub. Y''O(H) is the Tyrosine residue cross-linked to His233; it
  may be deprotonated (i.e., Y''O‒) or have lost an H atom and be in its oxidized
  radical form (i.e., Y''O•).'
