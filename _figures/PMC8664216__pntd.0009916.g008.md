caption: After binding of the virus to cell surface receptors (1), the virus is internalized
  and fuses from within early endosomes to release the nucleocapsid (2). The viral
  RNA is translated to produce P1234 (3), a polyprotein which upon processing facilitates
  genome replication (4). Thereafter, replication of a subgenomic RNA occurs which
  is translated into the structural proteins C, p62-E1. The C together with progeny
  genomic RNA form a nucleocapsid (5). The p62-E1 structural proteins are processed
  during transit via the secretory pathway and are finally expressed at the cell surface
  where virus assembly (5) and budding (6) occurs. Based on the obtained results (box)
  we hypothesize that tomatidine actively interferes with protein translation which
  reduces viral genome replication thereby limiting the chance to productively infect
  a cell. The effect of tomatidine on protein translation culminates in a reduced
  secretion of progeny virions. Fig was created by the authors in Biorender.com.
