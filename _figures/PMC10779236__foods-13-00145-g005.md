caption: Possible action mechanisms of sialic acid mediated by the signaling pathway
  and gut environment. Sialic acid (SA) exhibits various biological roles, such as
  brave development and learning improvement, anti-inflammatory effect, anti-oxidant
  activity, immune-enhancing ability, and so on. It is worked by the regulation of
  several signaling pathways, including GNE (UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine
  kinase), polysialyltransferase-2,8-sialyltransferase IV, polysialic acid (PolySA),
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  signal, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway,
  nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, etc. Meanwhile, SA shows
  significant functional properties in the host-microbe interactions. It modulates
  gut microbiota and microbial metabolites. There may be a possible relationship between
  gut microbiome and gene expression
