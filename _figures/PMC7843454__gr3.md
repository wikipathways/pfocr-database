caption: (A) Diagram depicting dysregulation of fatty acid oxidation in both peroxisomes
  and mitochondria. Genes in purple are those downregulated in early CKD (day 32)
  in the β-oxidation pathway in both peroxisome and mitochondria. Genes in blue are
  those downregulated at both stages of CKD in the TCA cycle and β-oxidation pathways
  in mitochondria. (B) Diagram showing the average predicted flux ratio for the metabolic
  pathways on days 32 and 100 compared with control (baseline); positive and negative
  flux ratios indicate increased and decreased flux at both stages of CKD, respectively.
