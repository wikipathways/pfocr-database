caption: 'Genomic and non-genomic mechanisms of AAS induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy
  and mechanisms of insulin signalling and resistance. Genomic pathway: Androgen binding
  of the AR complex causes translocation to the nucleus following dissociation of
  heat shock proteins (HSP). The androgen/AR complex regulates gene transcription
  on the androgen response element (ARE) of DNA. Non-genomic pathway: In addition
  to the AR, androgens can activate other membrane-bound receptors such as EGFR and
  SHBGR. This causes an increase in intracellular calcium (Ca2+), activation of several
  second messenger signalling such as extracellular regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK 1/2),
  protein kinase A (PKA), calmodulin (CaM) and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase
  (PI3K)/Akt/mTORc1 pathways and deactivation of myostatin pathway. Activation of
  these genomic and non-genomic pathways leads to skeletal muscle hypertrophy via
  upregulating gene transcription of anabolic genes, nutrient sensing, storage and
  transporting. While also upregulating satellite cell proliferation, differentiation,
  MPS and inhibiting muscle protein breakdown (MPB). Insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway:
  Insulin/IGF-1 bind to the insulin/IGF-1 receptor on the cell membrane inflicting
  tyrosine phosphorylation. The now activated receptor causes phosphorylation of insulin
  receptor substrate-1/2 (IRS-1/2) activating the PI3K/Akt signalling cascade leading
  to satellite cell proliferation; MPS via mTORc1, 4E-binding protein 1 (4E BP1) and
  p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) activation; glucose uptake via GLUT4 translocation and inhibition
  of forkhead O transcription factor (FOXO) leading to reduced MPB. Abnormal levels
  of circulating fatty acids and inflammatory cytokines result in serine/threonine
  phosphorylation of IRS-1 causing insulin resistance.'
