caption: A. Sequence of events leading to inflammaging and metabolic dysfunction in
  tissues. B. Schematic to describe the triggers of inflammation, the responding tissue
  resident myeloid cells in AT and liver, the pathways that are activated within those
  myeloid cells or in neighboring cells, the interacting cell types and the resulting
  metabolic and tissue dysfunction. C. Pathways of energy or nutrient sensing and
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Alterations in energy sources, including (1) sensing
  of DAMPs to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway or (2) changes in ATP/ADP and
  NAD+/NADH to drive activation of the sirtuin or AMPK pathway. Mitochondrial dysfunction
  that results in elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial (mt) DNA or
  altered NAD+/NADH levels are common themes that activate and alter these pathways
  in aging.
