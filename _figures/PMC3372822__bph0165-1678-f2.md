caption: Mechanism of OX1R-driven apoptosis. Activation of OX1R by orexins promotes
  the dissociation of Gq protein into αq and βγ dimers. The classical pathway resulting
  in phospholipase C activation by αq is not involved in OX1R-mediated apoptosis and
  is shown in grey. Freed βγ dimers stimulate the Src-tyrosine kinase resulting in
  the phosphorylation of the two ITIMs of OX1R. The phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2
  is then recruited by OX1R and activated thereby. Activated SHP-2 is mandatory for
  subsequent cytochrome c-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. PLC, phospholipase C;
  Cyt c, cytochrome c; DAG, diacylglycerol; SHP-2, SH2 domain-containing phosphotyrosine
  phosphatase-2. See text for details.
