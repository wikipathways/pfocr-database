caption: Role of the Spt4-Spt5m complex in the non-coding RNA pathway regulating DNA
  elimination. In cells depleted for Spt4 or Spt5m the remaining partner of the Spt4-Spt5m
  complex is not able to enter the germline nucleus. The Spt4-Spt5m complex most likely
  takes part in the synthesis of scnRNA precursors that can be detected as dsRNA and
  are processed into scnRNA. The Ptiwi01/09 proteins are loaded with scnRNA most probably
  in the MIC and are transferred to the maternal MAC where scnRNAs are compared with
  maternal transcripts representing the entire somatic genome. Silencing of SPT4 or
  SPT5m causes dsRNA levels to drop below detection and leads to lower amounts of
  scnRNAs. It also blocks the transfer of the Ptiwi09 protein from the MIC into the
  maternal MAC, presumably due to the lack of scnRNA cargo.
