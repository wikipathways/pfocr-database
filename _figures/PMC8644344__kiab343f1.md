caption: 'InsP and PP-InsP biosynthesis pathways in plants. Schematic pathways for
  the synthesis of InsP6 and PP-InsP in plants. The biosynthesis of InsP consists
  of a “lipid-dependent pathway” based on biochemical activities of homologous enzymes
  in Arabidopsis and a “lipid-independent pathway” identified in duckweed (Spirodela
  polyrhiza) (; ; ). There are two classes of kinases that synthesize the PP-InsP
  in eukaryotes: IP6K that phosphorylates InsP6 to generate 5PP-InsP5 (InsP7) and
  PPIP5K that can phosphorylate 5PP-InsP5 to produce 1,5(PP)2-InsP4 (InsP8) (). Plant
  genomes do not encode IP6K homologs and the InsP6 kinase activities of ITPK1 (and
  ITPK2) have been postulated to generate 5PP-InsP5 (; ; ). The plant PPIP5K homologs,
  VIP1/VIH2 and VIP2/VIH1 coordinately catalyze 5PP-InsP5 into 1,5(PP)2-InsP4 (; ;
