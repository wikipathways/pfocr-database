caption: Regulation of rice Hd3a and RFT1 expression by photoperiod. (a) The regulatory
  network controlling expression of Hd3a and RFT1. In rice, the critical day length
  required for floral induction is determined by two distinct pathways, Hd1-Hd3a and
  Ghd7-Ehd1-Hd3a/RFT1, which are regulated by the circadian clock and light signaling.
  The circadian clock regulates diurnal expression of Hd1 through OsGI function. Hd1,
  which potentially forms a complex with NF-Y, activates Hd3a expression in short
  days but suppresses it in long days. Red light converts Hd1 activity from activating
  to repressing Hd3a expression via PHYB. This repressive activity is enhanced by
  Hd6, which encodes the α subunit of CK2. Expression of Ehd1 and Ghd7 is controlled
  by the circadian clock and light signaling. Ehd1 activates expression of Hd3a and
  RFT1 independently of Hd1. OsGI regulates Ehd1 expression by activating OsMADS51
  expression, setting a blue-light-dependent gate around dawn. Ghd7 acts as a repressor
  of Ehd1 expression, and Hd16 promotes repressive activity of Ghd7, potentially through
  phosphorylation. The Ghd7 transcript is induced by light and increased by lengthening
  photoperiods. Phytochrome is required for light-dependent-induction of Ghd7. In
  short-day conditions, low induction of Ghd7 allows induction of Ehd1 to activate
  Hd3a expression. When day length increases above the critical short-day-length that
  is required for flowering, Ghd7 is highly induced and is sufficient to suppress
  Ehd1 and Hd3a expression. Disruption of the circadian clock by decreasing activity
  of OsELF3-1 and OsPRR37 affects daily expression of floral regulators. OsELF3-1
  negatively regulates expression of OsGI, OsPRR37, and Ghd7 in both long- and short-day
  conditions. OsPRR37 preferentially affects long-day flowering by suppressing Hd3a
  expression. Upstream regulators of Ehd1 and Ghd7, which contribute to flowering
  in long-day conditions, are indicated in the blue oval. Long-day-dependent induction
  of Ehd1 is promoted when OsMADS50 suppresses the negative regulators Ghd7 and OsLFL1.
  OsLFL1 is also negatively regulated by the OsVIL2-OsEMF2b complex, which is responsible
  for increasing repressive histone marks (H3K27me3). Lvp1/SDG724 activates OsMADS50
  expression by increasing H3K36 methylation. Two plant-homeodomain-containing proteins,
  OsTrx1/SDG723 and Ehd3, downregulate Ghd7 expression to activate Ehd1 transcription
  in long-day conditions. Clock marks on each protein symbol indicate that the circadian
  clock regulates its expression. (b) Diurnal expression of floral regulators. Ghd7
  has higher phytochrome-dependent, red-light inducibility around dawn in long-day
  conditions, shifting to midnight in short-day conditions (orange shaded area). Ehd1
  has higher blue-light-dependent inducibility around dawn in both long- and short-day
  conditions (blue shaded area). In long days, red light induces Ghd7 transcription,
  leading to suppression of Ehd1 and Hd3a expression. Accumulation of Hd1 transcript
  in the presence of light suppresses Hd3a expression through PHYB function. In short
  days, weak expression of Ghd7 allows induction of the Ehd1 gene, leading to activation
  of Hd3a expression. Under these conditions and through a parallel pathway, Hd1 expression
  occurs mainly during nighttime and also acts as an activator of Hd3a.
