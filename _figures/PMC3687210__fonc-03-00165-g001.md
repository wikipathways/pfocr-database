caption: The interactions and feedback loops between Akt and mTOR complexes and energy
  consuming and energy producing processes. Insulin/insulin growth factor signaling
  (IIS) activates PI3Kinase, which phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3. Binding of PIP3 to
  AH/PH domain translocates Akt to the membrane. FoxO transcription factors transcribe
  rictor leading to assembly of mTORC2 complex, which phosphorylates Akt S473. Activated
  by PIP3, the PIPDK (originally the PDK1) phosphorylates Akt T308. PI3K-Akt pathway
  can also be activated independent of IIS (see Mahajan and Mahajan, ). The phosphorylations
  are stabilized by high ATP:AMP ratio, Akt migrates into cytoplasm and nucleus. In
  the nucleus it phosphorylates FoxO, translocates it into the cytoplasm, and under
  low energy levels AMPK promotes its translocation into mitochondria. In cooperation
  with Sirtuin3, FoxO promotes mitochondrial OXPHOS (Peserico et al., ). Sestrins,
  transcribed by FoxO inhibit mTORC1 and the energy consuming processes come down.
  This up regulates ATP:AMP ratio. At basal level of activation, Akt inhibits AS 160
  and activates translocation of glucose transporter (GLUT4) to the membrane there
  by facilitating the glucose entry into the cells. Activated AMPK also promotes glucose
  transport under low energy conditions (Schwenk et al., ; Wu et al., ). The cycle
  continues under healthy environments. Under inflammatory environment, either due
  to the Dietary surplus environment or under stress activated conditions, the IIS
  is destabilized and causes insulin resistance (see Figure ).
