caption: LAMZ augments muscle and bone by mimicking calcium signaling to induce PGC-1α.
  Schematic of LAMZ function in the augmentation of muscle and bone. Exercise increases
  the calcium concentration in muscle and bone cells, inducing calcium signaling.
  Under this signaling, PGC-1α and Mef2c are activated and reciprocally drive their
  expression. Mitochondriogenic, myogenic and osteogenic genes are induced as well,
  together augmenting the muscle and bone. Thus, LAMZ facilitates the calcium signaling
  pathway and restores locomotor fitness
