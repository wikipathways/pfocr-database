caption: Apoptosis occurs through two pathways. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway occurs
  independently of p53 and requires the binding of pro-apoptotic ligands such as TRAIL.
  TRAIL can bind to four membrane-bound receptors (TRAIL-R1-4) and one soluble receptor
  (OPG). TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 contain a cytoplasmic death domain (DD) through which
  TRAIL can transmit an apoptotic signal. TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 also bind TRAIL, but
  because of the absence of a DD they are unable to initiate signaling. For this reason
  they are called decoy receptors. Binding of TRAIL to TRAIL-R1/2 leads to recruitment
  of the adaptor FADD and initiator procaspase-8 and 10 to rapidly form the DISC.
  Procaspase-8 and 10 are cleaved to form caspase-8 and 10 which activate effector
  caspase-3, 6 and 7 committing the cell to apoptose. At the DISC, variants of a protease-deficient
  caspase homolog called cFLIP inhibit the activation of caspase-8 and thus the propagation
  of apoptotic signaling. The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is initiated in response
  to cell stress such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This results in DNA damage
  causing the p53 oncogene to activate the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins BAK
  and BAX. Pro-apoptotic proteins cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO are released from mitochondria.
  Cytochrome c forms a protein complex, the apoptosome, with APAF-1 and activates
  caspase-9 which in turn activates effector caspase-3, 6 and 7 resulting in apoptosis.
  Smac/DIABLO inhibits apoptosis-inhibiting proteins such as XIAP, thus amplifying
  apoptotic signaling. APAF-1, Apoptotic protease activating factor-1; Bcl-2, B cell
  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/lymphoma 2; BAK, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer;
  BAX, Bcl-2-associated protein; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; cFLIP, cellular
  FLICE- inhibitory protein; DISC, Death-inducing signaling complex; SMAC, second
  mitochondria-derived activator of caspase; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
  protein.
