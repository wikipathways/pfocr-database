caption: 'Signaling pathways of glioma–astrocyte crosstalk associated with invasion.
  The major signaling pathways involved in glioma–astrocyte crosstalk that promote
  tumor invasion (Black arrows). The activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)
  and sonic hedgehog (SHH)-Gli signaling pathway induced normal astrocytes into reactive
  astrocytes (tumor-associated astrocytes (TAAs)). TAAs promote glioma cell invasion
  by activating some pathways, such as Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (STAT), phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and NF-κB pathways.
  The squared arrows show indirect pathways. Abbreviation: cGAMP; 2′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP,
  Cx43; connexin 43, EVs; extracellular vesicles, GBM; glioblastoma, GDNF; glial cell
  line-derived neurotrophic factor, IFN-α; interferon-α, IL; interleukin, RANKL; receptor
  activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, STING; stimulator of interferon genes,
  TNF; tumor necrosis factor.'
