caption: 'Metabolic pathway of thel-fucose system and its intersection with ethylene
  glycol (EG) metabolism. The metabolization of l-fucose is dependent of l-fucose
  permease (fucP), l-fucose isomerase (fucI), l-fuculose kinase (fucP), l-fuculose-1-phosphate
  aldolase (fucA), and NADH dependent l-1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase (fucO). Under
  anaerobiosis, FucO reduces l-lactaldehyde to propanediol which is excreted via a
  facilitator (Lu et al., 1998). Under aerobic conditions, l-lactaldehyde is instead
  oxidized to l-lactate by a NAD+-dependent oxidoreductase (aldA). l-lactate is further
  oxidized to pyruvate and enters central metabolism. Due to enzyme promiscuity, FucO
  can oxidize both propanediol and EG into their aldehydes, l-lactaldehyde and glycolaldehyde,
  respectively. Thus, when EG is available, it is oxidized to GA by the NAD+-dependent
  dehydrogenase function of FucO, and GA is converted to glycolate by AldA. Glycolate
  can then enter central metabolism via the oxidation pathway and/or the glyoxylate
  shunt. Abbreviations: EG, ethylene glycol; GA, glycolaldehyde; l-fucolose-1-P, l-fuculose-1-phosphate.
