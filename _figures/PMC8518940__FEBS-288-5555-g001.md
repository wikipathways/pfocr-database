caption: Dysregulated metabolic pathways of activated stromal fibroblasts. Fibroblasts
  in their nonactivated quiescent state maintain relatively high levels of energy
  production using glycolysis. However, activation via environmental stimuli such
  as inflammation results in an altered metabolic phenotype common to multiple fibroblast
  pathologies that increases key metabolic pathways including glycolysis, oxidative
  phosphorylation, lactate production, pentose phosphate pathway and glutamine metabolism.
