caption: Schematic representation of NUAK1 and NUAK2 upstream and downstream targets.
  NUAK1/2 downstream targets are indicated with blue arrows (NUAK1) and green arrows
  (NUAK2). The direction of the arrow indicates whether the regulation of NUAK1/2
  is direct (up arrow) or inverse (down arrow). Depicted in the cytoplasmic membrane
  are different protein receptors. Cytoskeleton proteins as well as cytoplasmic proteins
  and micro RNAs are represented in the cytosol. Proteins with square icons represent
  transcription factors. NUAK1 downstream targets involve different members of adhesion
  and cytoskeleton proteins such as vimentin and E-cadherin which share a similar
  role in invasion and metastasis. NUAK2 regulates different transcription factors
  related to pro-inflammatory cytokines which in turn activate the TGF-β signaling
  pathway ending a positive feedback loop. Conversely, NUAK1 protein negatively regulates
  TGF-β downstream signaling targets. Figure created in Biorender.com.
