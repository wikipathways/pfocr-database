caption: Deregulation of apoptotic pathways during the MDR development in cancer.
  The PI3K/AKT survival pathway is frequently overactive in MDR cancers, partly due
  to increased levels of growth ligands and receptors. Binding of growth factors to
  receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) stimulates PI3K by autophosphorylation; PI3K then
  catalyzes the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 while tumor suppressor PTEN has an opposing
  function. PTEN is often mutated and thus inactive in MDR cancers. PI3K mediates
  the activation of AKT via phosphorylation on Thr308 and Ser473 by PDK1 and PDK2,
  respectively. AKT can then activate MDM2 which blocks the function of p53. P53 regulates
  (among others) the levels and activation status of the Bcl-2 family of proteins.
  The balance between the levels of the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
  proteins, controls the release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria. Once
  released, cytochrome-c activates firstly caspase-9 and then the executioner caspases-3,
  -6 and -7. Furthermore, in MDR cancers, members of the IAP family are overexpressed,
  blocking caspase function. SMAC/Diablo are also released from the mitochondria during
  apoptosis and can inhibit the function of IAPs. NFkB is indirectly activated by
  growth factors via the PI3K/AKT pathway and up-regulates IAPs, e.g., survivin via
  regulation at the transcriptional level. Factors released by CAFs increase tumor
  cells survival via the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and inhibit apoptotic
  pathways. The cellular and non-cellular components of the TME as well as modifications
  in metabolic pathways and mechanical stress have been also implicated in resistance
  to cancer-cells targeting pro-apoptotic therapeutic agents. The composition and
  structure of stromal components in tumors increase interstitial fluid pressure (IFP)
  hindering the penetration of macromolecules through tissue and influence the sensitivity
  of tumor cells to therapy []. The hypoxic TME favours cells that have lost sensitivity
  to p53-mediated apoptosis and that are deficient in DNA mismatch repair leading
  to resistance to platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents []. Moreover, the low extracellular

  description: Deregulation of apoptotic pathways during the MDR development in cancer.
    The PI3K/AKT survival pathway is frequently overactive in MDR cancers, partly

    PI3K mediates the activation of AKT via phosphorylation on Thr308 and Ser473 by

    of p53. P53 regulates (among others) the levels and activation status of the Bcl-2
