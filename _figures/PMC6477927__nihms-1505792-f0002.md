caption: Ca2+signaling in T. gondii tachyzoites. Ca2+ enters the parasite likely through
  a Ca2+ channel that is sensitive to nifedipine. Inside the cell, Ca2+ is pumped
  either outside by a plasma membrane type Ca2+ ATPase or into organelles like the
  SERCA-Ca2+-ATPases localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The plasma membrane
  type Ca2+-ATPase in Toxoplasma also localizes to acidic stores (AS) like acidocalcisome
  or PLV. A signaling cascade that starts by an increase in cGMP level would lead
  to activation of a cGMP-protein kinase G that would result in cytosolic Ca2+ fluctuations
  that would activate biological responses like microneme (MIC) secretion. In this
  hypothetical scenario PKA could phosphorylate an unidentified phosphodiesterase
  (PDE) resulting in its inhibition and leading to an increase in cGMP levels. Downstream
  to PKG the pathway is hypothetical because the evidence is incomplete but CDPK3
  could be part of it together with PI-PLC. The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
  4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) by PI-PLC forms two second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 would act on an unknown release channel in the
  ER allowing Ca2+ to be released into the cytosol, which could activate CDPK1 stimulating
  microneme secretion. Changes in DAG levels would activate DAGK1 (DAG kinase 1),
  which converts DAG into phosphatidic acid (PA), which is sensed by the micronemal
  protein APH (acylated pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein) stimulating
  secretion. A Ca2+ /H+ exchanger that was characterized in the PLV could use the
  proton gradient to take-up Ca2+ into the acidic store []. How Ca2+ is released into
  the cytoplasm is not known. The bar at the upper right represents a Ca2+ concentration
  scale by blue color gradient (light to dark). Known pathways are shown by continuous
  lines, while hypothetical ones are represented by dashed lines.
