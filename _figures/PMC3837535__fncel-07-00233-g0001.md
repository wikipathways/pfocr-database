caption: The subcellular distribution of P2X receptors. P2X receptor subtypes differ
  in their trafficking properties and hence are localized to different subcellular
  compartments. P2X6 receptors are retained within the ER but can assemble with P2X4
  and P2X6 subunits to form heterotrimers that traffic to the cell surface. The predominant
  human allele of P2X5 lacks exon 10 and is also retained in the ER. P2X2 and P2X7
  receptors traffic relatively slowly through the secretory pathway but are stably
  expressed at the surface. P2X1 receptors are expressed at the cell surface but rapidly
  cycle to and from recycling endosomes. P2X3 and P2X4 receptors are consitutively
  internalized and delivered to late endosomes and lysosomes. Within the lysosomes,
  P2X3 receptors are rapidly degraded but P2X4 receptors resist degradation and can
  recycle back to the surface.
