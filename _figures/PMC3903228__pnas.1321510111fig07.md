caption: 'Consequences of coordinate activation of RHOA and ROCK1 by HIFs. Schematic
  diagram of hypoxia-induced and HIF-regulated RhoA/ROCK1 expression, which inhibits
  MYPT activity and increases MLC phosphorylation, leading to actin polymerization,
  cell motility, actin-myosin contractility, and the formation of focal adhesions
  which promote FAK activation. The pathways converge to promote cell motility, an
  essential step required for invasion and metastasis. Results from this study show
  that hypoxia promotes motility through the RhoA → ROCK1 signaling pathway. Blue:
  transcriptional regulation. Black: signaling mechanisms.'
