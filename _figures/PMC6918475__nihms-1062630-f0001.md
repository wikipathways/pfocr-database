caption: a | Bile acid (BA) synthesis occurs only in the liver. In the classic pathway
  of BA synthesis, cholesterol is hydroxylated in the 7α position by the enzyme CYP7A1.
  Alternatively, cholesterol is first converted to an oxysterol prior to being 7α-hydroxylated
  by the enzymes CYP7B1 or CYP39A1. These oxysterols can arise in the liver, through
  the enzyme CYP27A1, or they can arise in other cells — such as macrophages via CYP27A1
  or brain via CYP46A1 — then travel to the liver. After the initial step, which is
  considered rate-limiting, over a dozen enzymatic reactions proceed to generate the
  primary BA molecule chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). An intermediate in BA synthesis,
  7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, can undergo 12α-hydroxylation by the enzyme CYP8B1
  and subsequently proceed through the additional steps. This process results in the
  generation of the second primary BA found in humans, cholic acid (CA). BAs are conjugated
  to an amino acid such as glycine (G) and secreted into the bile. BAs enter the duodenum
  directly or are stored in the gallbladder until postprandial gallbladder contraction.
  Most BAs are reabsorbed from the terminal ileum by the active transporter apical
  sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). A minor fraction travel into the
  colon where they can be deconjugated and dehydroxylated by gut microorganisms, producing
  BAs that can be passively absorbed. From the portal vein, BAs are efficiently taken
  up into hepatocytes and recycled. A small fraction enter the systemic circulation.
