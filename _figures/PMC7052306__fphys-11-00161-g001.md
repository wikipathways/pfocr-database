caption: Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity at the Drosophila larval NMJ. (A)
  Calcium accumulation, along with neuronal activity, regulates the calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  adenylate cyclase, rutabaga. Dunce and rutabaga regulate the level of cAMP. Cell
  adhesion molecule Fas II and cAMP response element-binding proteins (CREB) are downstream
  of the cAMP pathway and responsible for increasing sprouting and pre-synaptic transmitter
  release. PKA and PP1 are also regulated by increased cAMP levels, and they, in turn,
  regulate CaMKII. The PKA-PP1-CaMKII interaction controls the withdrawal/retraction
  process through Plexin B receptor and Semaphorin-2a (Sema2a) chemorepulsion. The
  synaptic localization of Discs large (DLG) regulated by CaMKII controls the clustering
  of synaptic molecules, such as Fas II or Shaker. (B) The secretion of Wg proteins
  is enhanced in a calcium-dependent manner. The activation of a bidirectional Wg
  signaling pathway causes the nuclear import of the C-terminal fragment of Dfrizzled-2
  (DFz2, receptor of Wg) at the post-synaptic terminal of NMJ and the rearrangement
  of pre-synaptic terminal structures involving the Shaggy/GSK-3β kinase, which controls
  the organization of the cytoskeleton and number of boutons through Futsch at the
  pre-synaptic terminal of NMJ. Moreover, activated Wnt pathway at the post-synaptic
  terminal also regulates the localization of glutamate receptors (GluRs) around synaptic
  boutons.
