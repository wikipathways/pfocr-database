caption: Functional capacity and muscle mass are regulated by contractile and activity
  and the associated calcium signaling. Two parallel calcium-dependent pathways involving
  calcium-calmodulin kinase (CaMK) and calcineurin (Cn) can regulate MEF2 whereas
  Cn is the primary pathway that regulates NFATc. Since both NFATc and MEF2 activities
  are attenuated during chronic diabetes mellitus as well as in both CnAα and CnAβ
  knockout mice, we propose that reduced Cn signaling is predominantly responsible
  for the decreased level of PGC-1α expression. Consequently, mitochondrial biogenesis,
  and the expression of proteins associated with oxidative metabolism in skeletal
  muscle are likely to be affected. Suppression of Cn/NFATc/MEF2 signaling, and subsequent
  downregulation of PGC-1α may perpetuate the decrease in muscle functional capacity
  and mass that accompanies diabetes mellitus.
