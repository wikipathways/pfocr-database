caption: A) One arm of the hermaphrodite C. elegans gonad is represented, with a distal
  tip cell (DTC) acting as the major somatic niche component for GSCs, and somatic
  sheath cells influencing germline differentiation. Superoxide generated by membrane-bound
  globins in sheath cells are converted into hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutases
  both intra- and extra-cellularly, influencing germline differentiation through the
  activation of p38/JNK. B) In the Drosophila testis, ROS generated in early germ
  cells by the mitochondria (and possibly other sources) can activate the EGFR pathway
  non-autonomously in somatic cyst cells. EGFR activation promotes the cell-autonomous
  differentiation of cyst cells, and the non-autonomous differentiation of the germline.
  C) In the Drosophila ovary, Wnt signaling promotes the expression of glutathione
  S-transferase genes (Gst), which results in changes in the redox status of escort
  cells (ECs) that ultimately influence the differentiation of the germline. D) In
  mouse testis, Sertoli cell-derived GNDF and FGF2 signaling maintains basal ROS levels
  in SSCs, which are crucial for the maintenance of these cells through the activation
  of JNK and p38.
