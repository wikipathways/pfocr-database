caption: Proposed subfunctionalization of TSHa and TSHb, with potential role of TSHb
  in Atlantic salmon smoltification. In birds and mammals, the same gene (tshβ) is
  expressed by the “classical” TSH cells of the adenohypophysis and by the fewer TSH
  cells from the pars tuberalis (PT). PT-TSH is involved in the photoperiodic regulation
  of seasonal life traits,,, by increasing brain deiodinase 2 (DIO2) and stimulating
  the conversion of thyroxin (T4) into triiodothyronine (T3). Salmon tshβa and tshβb
  paralogs are expressed by distinct cell populations as shown by FISH. We propose
  that tshβb cells located in the dorsal region of the pars proximal distalis (PPD)
  may be related to the PT-TSH cells in birds and mammals, and infer a subfunctionalization
  of salmon tshβa and tshβb paralogs. We revealed a peak expression of tshβ at smoltification,
  concomitant to the inversion of rheotaxis initiating downstream migration. An increase
  in brain dio2b paralog was reported at smoltification in Atlantic salmon and we
  hypothesize that the peak expression of tshβb may be responsible for this activation.
  Salmon TSHb may play a key-role in the environmental and internal regulation of
  smoltification and downstream migration, via similar signalling pathway as bird
  and mammal PT-TSH.
