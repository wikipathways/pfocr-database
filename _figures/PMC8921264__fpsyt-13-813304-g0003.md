caption: The metabolism of Hcy and the relationship between vitamins and this metabolism.
  Hcy is located at the intersection of the methionine cycle and the transsulfuration
  pathway. The methionine cycle is responsible for producing the universal methyl
  donor SAM, which is used in various methyl transfer reactions. The transsulfuration
  pathway is related to the synthesis of GSH. Vitamin B12, Vitamin B6 act as cofactors
  in the enzymatic reactions in cycle.
