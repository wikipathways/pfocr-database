caption: Differential dependency network focused on the KEGG apoptosis pathway ().
  Recurrent breast cancers (uniquely featured by red edges) showed the imbalance between
  apoptosis and survival with only one route into the cell through IL1B-induced inhibition
  of proapoptotic CASP3. Non-recurrent breast cancer (uniquely featured by green edges)
  had a cascade of signaling pathways inside the cell that provides the balance between
  apoptosis and survival. Copyright Kanehisa Laboratories. Reproduced with permission
