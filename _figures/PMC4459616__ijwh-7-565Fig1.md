caption: 'Wnt signaling pathways and the biology of sclerostin.Notes: (A) Canonical
  Wnt signaling: in the absence of sclerostin, Wnt binds to LRP 5/6 and its co-receptor,
  frizzled. This results in phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of LRP 5/6, which
  allows axin to bind the receptor complex Axin binding leads to inhibition of GSK-3β,
  which normally functions to target β-catenin for degradation. Therefore, cytoplasmic
  levels of β-catenin increase and are translocated to the nucleus, where they bind
  to DNA binding proteins and activate target gene promoters. This results in osteoblast
  differentiation, proliferation and survival and hence, increased bone formation.
  (B and C) Loss-of-function of LRP5 and Wnt prevent canonical Wnt signaling: Loss-of-function
  of LRP5 and Wnt prevent formation of the active Wnt-LRP 5/6-frizzled complex and
  prevent Wnt signaling. The cytoplasmic tail of LRP 5/6 remains unphosphorylated.
  Therefore, axin does not bind the receptor complex. GSK-3β activity is uninhibited
  and therefore leads to phosphorylation of β-catenin, targeting it for degradation.
  Cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin decrease. Therefore, there is less translocation
  of the protein to the nucleus. Target gene promoters of the Wnt signaling pathway
  are not activated. This results in decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption
  and hence, skeletal fragility and fractures. (D) Inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling
  by sclerostin: sclerostin is secreted by osteocytes. It binds to LRP 5/6, which
  prevents Wnt from binding to LRP 5/6 and its co-receptor, frizzled. Therefore, Wnt
  signaling is inhibited. Through the mechanisms described above (B and C), this results
  in decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption.'
