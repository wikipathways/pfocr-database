caption: 'A) During periods of basal or brief stimulation purinergic (and other) receptors
  that inhibit voltage-gated Ca2+channels mediate autocrine regulation of exocytosis.
  Left panel: 1) Acetylcholine released from the splanchnic nerve depolarizes chromaffin
  cells opening voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. 2) The Ca2+ entry triggers exocytosis
  of catecholamines and other transmitters including ATP, opioids, and 5-HT. Right
  panel: 3) ATP activates P2Y autoreceptors. 4) Gβγ inhibits the Ca2+ channels, reducing
  Ca2+ entry and thereby exocytosis. 5) SERT mediated uptake of 5-HT opposes activation
  of the 5-HT1A receptors so this signaling pathway is not recruited. B) With sustained,
  stress-like stimulation 5-HT signaling becomes the dominant pathway for autocrine
  regulation. Left panel: 1-2) As in panel A, acetylcholine released from the splanchnic
  nerve depolarizes chromaffin cells opening voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and triggering
  exocytosis. 3) With sustained stimulation PACAP might also be released from the
  splanchnic nerve and become the main stress mediator activating the chromaffin cells.
  PACAP acts via PAC1 receptors which recruit additional Ca2+ entry pathways perhaps
  including CaV3 (T-type) channels and TRPC channels. Right panel: 4) ATP activates
  P2Y autoreceptors. 5) Inhibition of Ca2+ channels becomes ineffective with strong,
  sustained depolarization in part because Gβγ dissociates from the channels. 6) The
  stronger stimulation leads to greater increase in local 5-HT and activation of 5-HT1A
  receptors. 7) The 5-HT1A receptors inhibit exocytosis by an atypical mechanism independent
  from cellular excitability / Ca2+ entry that can persist during the sustained stimulation.
  In this manner, 5-HT signaling becomes the dominant pathway for autocrine regulation.'
