caption: During sepsis, homeostasis between the various biological systems of the
  inflammatory network is highly imbalanced. In the initiation of sepsis, the release
  of a large amount of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from invading
  microorganisms and/or damaged host tissue results in the overstimulation of pattern-recognition
  receptors (PRRs) on immune cells. Activated immune cells release excessive amounts
  of pro-inflammatory mediators (resulting in a ‘cytokine storm’), free radicals and
  enzymes, which converts the normally beneficial effects of inflammation into an
  excessive response that damages the host. Activation of the adrenergic branch of
  the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and/or decreased activity of the cholinergic
  anti-inflammatory pathway (of the parasympathetic branch of the ANS) further amplifies
  the pro-inflammatory responses of neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells in
  sepsis. The presence of invading microorganisms or their products in the blood can
  cause systemic activation of the complement system, which results in the excessive
  generation of complement anaphylatoxins, which, at high concentrations, induce numerous
  harmful effects. Simultaneous activation of the coagulation system and the inhibition
  of fibrinolysis as a result of the pro-inflammatory environment and/or damaged endothelium
  can result in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a major complication
  of sepsis, and in the amplification of the inflammatory response. The complement,
  coagulation and fibrinolysis systems are tightly connected through direct interactions
  of serine proteases, and imbalances in each cascade are intensified in a positive-feedback
  loop (). Finally, the sustained pro-inflammatory environment affects the functional
  state of immune effector cells, eventually causing the dysfunction of neutrophils
  and immunoparalysis. Alterations in leukocyte apoptosis in the later stages of sepsis
  further account for immunosuppression, which increases the susceptibility to secondary
  infections.
