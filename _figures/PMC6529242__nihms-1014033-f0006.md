caption: Col-GAG induces osteogenic differentiation of primary hMSCs via both an autogenous
  activation of the canonical BMPR signaling pathway with phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8
  and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Mechanism 1, green arrows). Col-GAG directly inhibits
  resorptive activity of osteoclasts even in the absence of differentiating hMSCs
  (Mechanism 2, red line). Although OPG expression is present in hMSCs differentiated
  on Col-GAG, a net activation of osteoclast mediated resorption occurs through unclear
  mechanisms (Mechanism 3, blue dashed line).
