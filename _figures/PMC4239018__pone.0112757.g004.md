caption: Overview of the fluxes through key metabolic pathways of hESCs cultured at
  physiological, 2%, and atmospheric, 20%, oxygen concentrations. At both oxygen concentrations
  glycolysis is disconnected from the citric acid cycle with majority of the glucose
  being converted to lactate, with some being diverted to glycogen production and
  the pentose phosphate pathway. The mitochondria is metabolically active with glutamine
  serving as the main carbon source for ATP aerobic respiration. The TCA cycle within
  the mitochondria is driven by the catabolism of amino acids. Values represent the
  minimum and maximum flux through the pathway at both physiological (P) and atmospheric
  (A) oxygen concentrations as determined by the MFA model developed within this study.
