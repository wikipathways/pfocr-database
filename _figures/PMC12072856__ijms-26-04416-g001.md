caption: Bacteria antagonize p53 protein by mechanisms of its destabilization or by
  reducing expression of its mRNA. Bacteria produce proteins (bps), which interact
  with cellular molecules interfering with the p53 pathway. For instance, one of the
  proteins (IpgD) produced by S. flexneri promotes activation of AKT kinase, which
  phosphorylates and activates MDM2, which is a major negative regulator of p53 inducing
  its degradation. Another S. flexneri protein (VirA) induces proteolysis of calpastatin,
  which is a negative regulator of calpain. Liberated calpain snips off the N-terminus
  of p53. Other bacteria also act through the activation of AKT. For instance, in
  H. pylori, this function is played by the CagA protein. On the other hand, C. trachomatis
  activates EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), which by its natural signaling
  pathway stimulates AKT. N. gonorrhoeae arrests the cell cycle and induces DNA breaks
  in host cells, which in normal conditions would activate p53, but infection with
  this bacterium, by an unknown mechanism, reduces expression of p53 mRNA. K. pneumoniae
  activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which indirectly activates the NF-κB pathway,
  which through mediators causes the destabilization of p53 mRNA. The only known bacterium
  that apparently activates p53 is Salmonella Typhimurium, which through its AvrA
  protein promotes p53 acetylation, which is associated with its stabilization and
  activation
