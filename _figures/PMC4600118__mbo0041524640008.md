caption: Regulatory mechanism of GlcNAc-induced cell death in C. albicans. GlcNAc
  constitutively activates the Ras1-cAMP signaling and GlcNAc catabolic pathways.
  This activation leads to high activity of mitochondrial metabolism, which is a major
  source of ROS. The Candida-specific mitochondrial protein Mcu1 is a master regulator
  of GlcNAc sensing and metabolism. The Mac1 transcription factor is also involved
  in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism (the TCA cycle pathway) and the production
  of ROS. Toxic ROS functions as a major fungicidal agent, and its accumulation ultimately
  leads to cell death.
