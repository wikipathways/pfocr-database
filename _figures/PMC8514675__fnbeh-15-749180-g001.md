caption: Proposed mechanisms of ketamine’s antidepressant action. The binding of ketamine
  to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) on GABAergic interneurons disinhibits
  glutamatergic neurons, which results in increased synaptic glutamate release. AMPAR
  activation by glutamate increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels.
  Although the exact source of BDNF is yet to be determined, local release of BDNF
  is thought to stimulate TrkB receptors. This activation activates intracellular
  signaling, such as the Ca2+pathway. Another mechanism is the direct inhibition of
  NMDAR by ketamine. Inhibiting postsynaptic NMDARs reduces eEF2 via the inactivation
  of CaMK (eEF2 kinase), which leads to enhanced local protein synthesis of BDNF.
  Increased intracellular Ca2+ stimulates CaMKs and their downstream targets, including
  MeCP2, MEF2, and HDAC5. MeCP2, a transcriptional regulator, binds to methylated
  CpG sites on the genomic region and interacts with other transcription repressors,
  including HDACs. CaMKII phosphorylates MeCP2, promotes its nuclear export, and increases
  activity-dependent transcription. MEF2 recruits HDAC5 and removes activating acetyl
  groups from histones, which results in a silenced or repressed state of transcription.
  CaMKII phosphorylates HDAC5, which promotes nuclear export and increases activity-dependent
  transcription. Ketamine is known to increase the phosphorylation of CaMKII, MeCP2,
  and HDAC5 (see detail in the main text). Thus, ketamine-mediated enhancement of
  intracellular Ca2+signaling is linked to epigenetic regulation of transcription,
  which leads to long-term synaptic plasticity and, consequently, prolonged antidepressant-like
  effects.
