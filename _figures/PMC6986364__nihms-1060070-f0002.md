caption: (A) Trained immunity as induced by β-glucan mediates a myelopoiesis bias
  in the bone marrow. CMP, common myeloid progenitor; GMP, granulocyte-monocyte progenitor;
  HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; MPP, multi-potent progenitor. (B) The β-glucan-dependent
  myelopoiesis bias is mediated by an early-activated IL-1β pathway associated with
  enhanced glycolysis and lipid metabolism changes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor
  cells (HSPC) resulting in enhanced cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains and thereby
  enhanced GM-CSF/CD131 signaling, which drives myelopoiesis. (C) Induction of trained
  immunity in HSPCs protects them from LPS-induced DNA damage and enables beneficial
  responses of the bone marrow to a secondary LPS challenge as well as to chemotherapy-induced
  myelosuppression.
