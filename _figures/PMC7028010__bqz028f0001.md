caption: UPR activation mediates beta-cell survival. BiP is sequestered by binding
  to ER-stress inducing unfolded/misfolded protein in the ER lumen, leading to its
  dissociation from PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6, which are ER membrane-localized stress
  transducers. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, which inhibits global protein
  translation and activates ATF4. ATF4 mediates the transcription of genes that encode
  chaperones, oxidoreductases, ERAD, and autophagy. IRE1α cleaves Xbp1 mRNA, and spliced
  Xbp1 (sXbp1) mRNA in turn mediates gene transcription of chaperones, lipid synthesis,
  ERAD, and autophagy. In addition, sXbp1 promotes proinsulin folding through various
  PDI family genes. When ATF6 is released from BiP, it translocates to the Golgi complex,
  where ATF6 is cleaved to generate ATF6f. ATF6f activates the transcription of genes
  encoding protein chaperones and ERAD. ATF6f also triggers beta-cell proliferation.
  When mild or tolerable levels of UPR are activated in beta cells, the UPR transducers
  PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6 mediate the transcription of genes for chaperones, ERAD components,
  and autophagy in an attempt to restore ER homeostasis. UPR activation also triggers
  mRNA decay and attenuates global gene translation to reduce the workload on the
  ER. Finally, the induction of AKT1 and reduction of TXNIP serve to inhibit cell
  death. Elements of the UPR pathway are essential to maintaining beta-cell homeostasis
  under normal conditions, due to the high secretory workload placed on the beta-cell.
