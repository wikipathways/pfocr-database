caption: MLKL-related pathophysiological events in the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus.
  Upon stimulation, MLKL is phosphorylated through the RIPK1/RIPK3 axis. Subsequently,
  phosphorylated MLKL translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, inducing
  structural disruption and promoting the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum
  into the cytoplasm. This leads to an increase in cytoplasmic ROS levels. Additionally,
  p-MLKL can activate UPR sensors such as IRE1α and PERK, which bind to GRP78, thereby
  initiating their phosphorylation and triggering an unconventional ERS response.
  The elevated ROS in the cytoplasm further enhances the activation of the PERK-eIF2α
  pathway. During necroptosis, RIPK3 and MLKL function as nuclear transport proteins,
  shuttling continuously between the nucleus and cytoplasm, while RIPK1 remains localized
  exclusively in either the nucleus or cytoplasm. Ubiquitination of nuclear RIPK1
  provides a platform for the activation of nuclear RIPK3. Phosphorylated RIPK3 then
  interacts with MLKL, leading to MLKL phosphorylation. Both phosphorylated RIPK3
  and MLKL then exit the nucleus together to form high-order oligomers, which further
  promote the formation of the cytosolic necrosome and ultimately lead to cell death.
  The activation of the PERK-eIF2α pathway and the increase in cytoplasmic ROS levels
  also facilitate the nuclear entry of MLKL
