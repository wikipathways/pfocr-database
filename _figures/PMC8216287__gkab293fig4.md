caption: Hypothetical model representing the complexity of UHRF1 known or potential
  roles/interactions in DNA damage repair. Numerous aspects remain to be investigated
  about UHRF1 interactions and roles during the DNA damage response, as some of its
  known epigenetic abilities could be also involved in the detection of DNA damage
  and choice of repair pathway. The model attempts to integrate these different functions
  to show the complexity that could hide behind every player in the DDR, specifically
  UHRF1. (A) Recognition and binding of H3K9me3 and H3R2me0 by the TTD and PHD domains
  could be critical to UHRF1 positioning on damaged DNA; the presence of H3K9me3 could
  reinforce UHRF1 binding to TIP60, blocking TIP60 interaction with P53 and avoiding
  the activation of the apoptosis process. TIP60 would be free to acetylate ATM, starting
  the DDR. (B) The RING domain-dependent ubiquitination of H3K18 and H3K23 could facilitate
  HR repair by blocking their acetylation, detected in DSB repair via NHEJ, or functioning
  as docking sites for HR proteins. Trimethylation of H4K20, performed in the presence
  of UHRF1 and PARP1, could prevent 53BP1 recognition of H4K20me1/2, further impairing
  the NHEJ repair pathway. (C) UHRF1 is a known RNA-binding protein via SRA domain.
  Following DNA damage, it could also bind the RNA:DNA hybrids formed in S/G2 phase
  together with BRCA1, possibly via TTD, facilitating HR; the hypothesised mechanism
  is similar to the binding of RNA:RNA duplex by the Tudor domain of 53BP1 that directs
  the repair towards NHEJ.
