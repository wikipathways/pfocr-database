caption: The multifunctional p62 protein is depicted with its essential domains and
  linked functions. Proteasome dysfunction transcriptionally induces p62 via undefined
  mechanisms, which dimerizes via the PB1 domain and binds to ubiquitinated proteins
  via the UBA domain to sequester them in protein aggregates. The LIR (LC3-interaction-region)
  binds to LC3 to bring ubiquitinated proteins and autophagic substrates into autophagosomes.
  p62 sequesters Keap1 via the KIR (Keap-1-interaction-region) to induce Nrf2 activation
  (not shown). Induction of p62 results in dephosphorylation of TFEB driven by TRPML1-mediated
  release of lysosomal calcium triggering activation of the calcineurin phosphatase.
  Dephosphorylated TFEB shuttles to the nucleus to drive transcription of autophagy-lysosome
  pathway proteins and triggers autophagy. The studies by Pan et al suggest that p62
  interacts with mTOR to sequester it in protein aggregates away from the lysosome
  surface, which induces TFEB activation by preventing its tonic phosphorylation.
  Whether p62 directly affects TRPML1 function activates TFEB via other pathways,
  is not known. TFEB-mediated induction of autophagy degrades ubiquitinated proteins
  and aggregates (not shown) and removes proteasomes via autophagic degradation. Red
  arrows indicate upregulation, ‘+’ and ‘-’ depict increased and decreased protein
  levels, respectively. Dotted arrows depict speculative pathways, and ‘?’ indicates
  unknown mechanisms.
