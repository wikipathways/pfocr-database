caption: Association of the Wnt pathway with stress responses and aging. Under stress
  conditions ROS is produced in the mitochondria, blocking the interaction of Nrx
  with Dsh and releasing Nrx inhibition of Dsh. β-catenin then preferentially interacts
  with FoxO to activate transcription. When no oxidative stress is present Nrx binds
  Dsh, and -catenin returns to its normal TCF preference.
