caption: Possible mechanisms of action of metformin in cancer therapy. Metformin increases
  the ratio of AMP to ATP by inhibiting mitochondria complex I, activates the adenosine
  monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, and represses the
  insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway. Furthermore, AMPK activation
  decreases the expression level of PD-L1, which allows cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated
  tumor cell death. Last, metformin could increase the number of CD8+ T tumor-infiltrating
  lymphocytes. IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor-1
  receptor; IR, insulin receptor; LKB1, liver kinase B1; mTORC1, mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 1; OCT, organic cation transporter; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase; PD-1, programmed cell death protein-1; PD-L1, programmed death ligand-1.
