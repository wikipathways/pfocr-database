caption: Responses of mammalian cells to DPCs. DPCs induce fork stalling and rapidly
  activate the ATR damage response pathway. Subsequently, forks stalled at DPCs undergo
  breakage, initiating HR that reestablishes replication forks. It is not clear whether
  the ATM damage response pathway is activated by fork breakage (DSBs) or ATR. Neither
  NER nor NER coupled with the proteasomal degradation of CLPs participates in the
  repair of DPCs. DSBs resulting from fork breakage are not repaired by NHEJ.
