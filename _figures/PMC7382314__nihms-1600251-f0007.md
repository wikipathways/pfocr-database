caption: The left panel shows the conventional concepts of the efferent arm of the
  cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). The efferent vagus nerve stimulates
  CD4-positive (CD4+) T cells in spleen via the splenic sympathetic nerve. Norepinephrine,
  released from the sympathetic nerve, binds to β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs) on
  CD4+ T cells, which then elicits release of ACh from these choline acetyltransferase-expressing
  T cells. Acetylcholine (Ach) binding to alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
  (α7nAChRs) on macrophages (MΦ) produces an anti-inflammatory response, such as tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF)–α suppression. The right panel summarizes our new findings
  on the CAP and suggests that the CAP-stimulated anti-inflammatory response may be
  mediated by a more complex interaction of immune cells than previously appreciated.
  Ultrasound- or VNS-induced protection of kidneys from ischemia-reperfusion injury
  (IRI) mediated by CD4+ T cells is β2AR-dependent. Ultrasound or VNS activates peritoneal
  macrophages that protect the kidney from IRI. Kidney protection by activated α7nAChR-expressing
  peritoneal macrophages is dependent on α7nAChRs. Hes1 expression in macrophages
  and the induction of Hes1 further elicits an M2 phenotype and produces an anti-inflammatory
  response. These studies identify Hes1 as a new anti-inflammatory mediator in this
  pathway and signaling molecule downstream of α7nAChRs, but other genes were also
  identified by RNA sequencing that will require further investigation. The finding
  that spleen or lymphocytes (B and/or T cells) are required for the anti-inflammatory
  effect of activated peritoneal macrophages in vivo and other results using Rag1-deficient
  mice introduce an expanded view of the mechanisms involved in CAP-induced protection
  from acute kidney injury and perhaps from injury of other organs, as well. Dashed
  lines, pathways not yet defined.
