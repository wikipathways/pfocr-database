caption: Schematic of the L3 eye disc spanning from the anterior proliferating progenitors
  (left) to the differentiated photoreceptors (right), showing the expression domain
  and activity of Dac, Hh, Ci, Dpp, and Yki/Hth (upper panel) and their molecular
  interactions to coordinate proliferation and differentiation of the retina (lower
  panel). Hh expressed by the differentiating PRs diffuses short-range, promoting
  a gradient of Ci activity. High levels of Ci promote the synchronized re-entrance
  in the cell cycle in the SMW [,–] and turns off its own signaling pathway via rdx
  expression [–]. Anterior to this domain, low Hh signaling initiates the expression
  of ato, which promotes the acquisition of a proneural fate [–]. In addition, in
  this domain, Hh signaling upregulates dap, which keeps precursor cells in G1-phase
  by inhibiting CycE [–], and activates dpp expression []. Together, Hh and Dpp induce
  MF formation and high dac expression []. In turn Dac, whose expression extends from
  the FMW to the SMW, straddling the MF, ensures the transition from proliferation
  to G1 arrest state by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the Yki-Hth complex
  in the FMW []. Moreover, together with Dpp, Dac represses Hth expression []. Finally,
  we show here that Dac potentiates Hh signaling in the MF, upstream of Ci. This positive
  feedback loop is essential to control all Hh functions, including the timing of
  MF formation, the accuracy of cell cycle control, the tissue changes associated
  to the MF, the correct specification of the founder PR8 cell and the attenuation
  of Hh signaling posterior to the MF, which allows the progression of the differentiation
  wave.
