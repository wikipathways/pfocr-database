caption: Graft-versus-host disease signaling pathway and miRNA interactions obtained
  using IPA. Classical GVHD signaling pathway was selected from the IPA knowledge
  base and eight miRNAs were identified to interact with the various components of
  the pathway. Chemokines and genes are represented as nodes of various shapes and
  the biological relationship and interactions between them are represented as a line.
  Direct experimentally proven interactions are represented with a solid line, while
  indirect interactions are shown as a dashed line. All the interactions are supported
  by at least one reference from either the literature or from the information available
  in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. The direction of the interaction is indicated
  with the arrow head. miR-146a-5p and miR-155-5p are mature miRNAs while miR-515,
  miR-346, miR-143, miR-373, miR-31, and miR-29 could be primary, precursor or even
  mature forms of miRNAs.
