caption: Canonical AR in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Common alterations
  in AR, including AR amplification or overexpression, AR mutations and truncated
  AR lacking ligand-binding domains (ARΔLBD), can increase its sensitivity to very
  low levels of androgens or lead to constitutive activation of AR signaling. There
  are two possible ways for the initial substrates to convert to intratumoral DHT
  in CRPC. The first way is that androgens are synthesized intratumorally via the
  de novo route and the second is that androgens are converted from adrenal androgens.
  Genomic and transcriptomic alterations in AR pathway coregulators are also associated
  with resistance to AR-targeted therapies in CRPC.
