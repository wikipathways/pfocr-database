caption: Overview of amino acid metabolism. The human body can obtain amino acids
  through food digestion and absorption, tissue decomposition, internal synthesis
  of three ways. Amino acids in amino acid metabolism pool can be deacidified to produce
  amino and carbon dioxide. Or participate in the synthesis of purine, pyrimidine
  and other nitrogenous compounds in the transformation of metabolites; Or deamination
  produces α-ketoacid and NH3. According to different enzymes and pathways, α-ketoacid
  can produce keto bodies, or participate in oxidative energy supply or sugar and
  lipid synthesis; NH3 enters the urea cycle. Created with BioRender.com
