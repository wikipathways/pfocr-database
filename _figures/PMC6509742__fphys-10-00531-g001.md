caption: IGF-PI3K-AKT-FOXO pathway of insulin signaling. The insulin-like signaling
  system includes different well-defined ligands, such as insulin-like growth factor
  (IGF), which regulate the activity of the homologous insulin receptor INSR. Insulin
  receptor substrate (IRS) proteins act as messenger molecule-activated receptors
  to signaling, and which is an important step in insulin’s action. Phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K), 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK), and protein
  kinase B (AKT), three major nodes downstream of IRS, and have been implicated in
  many of the metabolic actions of insulin. The forkhead transcription factor (FOXO)
  regulates transcription of genes involved in stress resistance, xenobiotic detoxification
  and DNA repair. FOXO is negatively regulated by insulin-like signaling when the
  PI3K → AKT cascade stimulates phosphorylation of FOXO and promotes its secretion
  from the nucleus and inactivation in the cytosol.
