caption: The molecular mechanism behind mitophagy after stroke. PINK, Parkin, NIX,
  BNIP3, and the newly-found FUNDC1 are mitophagy receptors in mammalian cells. Mitophagy
  regulated by PINK1-Parkin-mediated pathway is a multi-step process. Briefly, PINK1
  is accumulated on the outer membrane of dysfunctional mitochondria, subsequently
  to recruit parkin by activating parkin’s cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase, then proteins
  on the outer mitochondrial membrane such as VDAC1 and Mfn1/2 are ubiquitinated by
  parkin to induce mitophagy. Adapter proteins including p62 are accumulated in the
  outer mitochondrial membrane after the ubiquitination, leading to ubiquitylated
  cargo recruited into autophagosomes by binding to LC3. BNIP3 and NIX are related
  multi-functional outer mitochondrial membrane proteins. Bnip3 and NIX activated
  mitophagy by binding to Bcl-2 family proteins (including BCL2 and BCL-xL), and also
  by repressing mTOR or regulating the production of ROS. The molecular mechanism
  of FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy has not been reported in the pathologies of stroke
  so far. FUNDC1 phosphorylated at serine 17 under hypoxia stress, thereby to interacting
  with LC3 and promoting mitophagy. Bcl-xL can inhibit LC-3II conversion, thereby
  suppressing FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy. In response to the stress of stroke (both
  of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke), mitophagy is activated as a stress adaptation
  to removing dysfunctional mitochondria. Elongated mitochondria were divided into
  pieces, of which the process is preceded by mitochondrial fission, then autophagosomes,
  double-membrane vesicles are formed, and sequester targeted cell constituents and
  mitochondria. The mature autophagosomes then fuse with a lysosome to form the autophagolysosomes,
  where the mitochondria are subsequently degraded

  description: The molecular mechanism behind mitophagy after stroke. PINK, Parkin,
    NIX, BNIP3, and the newly-found FUNDC1 are mitophagy receptors in mammalian cells.
    Mitophagy regulated by PINK1-Parkin-mediated pathway is a multi-step process.
    Briefly, PINK1 is accumulated on the outer membrane of dysfunctional mitochondria,
    subsequently to recruit parkin by activating parkin’s cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase,
    then proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane such as VDAC1 and Mfn1/2 are
    ubiquitinated by parkin to induce mitophagy. Adapter proteins including p62 are
    accumulated in the outer mitochondrial membrane after the ubiquitination, leading
    to ubiquitylated cargo recruited into autophagosomes by binding to LC3. BNIP3
    and NIX are related multi-functional outer mitochondrial membrane proteins. Bnip3
    and NIX activated mitophagy by binding to Bcl-2 family proteins (including BCL2
    and BCL-xL), and also by repressing mTOR or regulating the production of ROS.
    The molecular mechanism of FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy has not been reported in
    the pathologies of stroke so far. FUNDC1 phosphorylated at serine 17 under hypoxia
    stress, thereby to interacting with LC3 and promoting mitophagy. Bcl-xL can inhibit
