caption: 'Part I: The use of STING agonists has the problem of poor targeting, which
  can induce systemic inflammatory responses, and cause damage to the cells. Developing
  new STING agonists with better specificity can improve their pharmacokinetic properties
  and reduce off-target effects. Identification of biomarkers enables STING-targeted
  therapies to be more refined and targeted. Distinguish which patients are better
  candidates for targeted STING therapy to make the treatment more effective and safer.
  Part II: There is genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity in tumor cells, and a single
  treatment method cannot solve the treatment resistance caused by tumor heterogeneity,
  and it is necessary to combine different treatment strategies to improve the treatment
  effect. Part III: The bioavailability of STING agonists is poor. It is rapidly degraded
  in the body and cannot be efficiently taken up by cells. The use of extracellular
  vesicles, organic polymers, and other materials to deliver agonists can effectively
  solve this problem. Created with Figdraw. STING, stimulator of interferon genes'
