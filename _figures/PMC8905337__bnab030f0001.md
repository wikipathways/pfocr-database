caption: Complexity of the TGF-β superfamily network. (A) General overview of the
  ligand-mediated signaling pathway starting with (1) secretion of the ligand:latency
  associated protein (LAP [prodomain]) complex and its association with binding proteins
  in the extracellular matrix. (2) Cytoskeletal forces and/or proteolysis release
  the ligand:LAP complex, often dissociating each. (3) Mature ligands are then free
  to associate with protein antagonists in the extracellular space or in circulation.
  (4) LAPs are also released with ligand binding to type II receptors followed by
  recruitment of type I receptors and their transphosphorylation by type II. (5) The
  serine kinase domain of type 1 receptors then phosphorylates receptor (R)-Smads
  that then bind Co-Smads allowing for (6) nuclear translocation, binding of transcription
  factors (TF) and coregulators and ultimately, (7) gene transactivation. (8) Inhibitory
  (I)-Smads are among the target genes and attenuate both receptor activation and
  Co-Smad complex formation. (B) Color-coding indicates the different ligands (purple
  and blue) that bind ActRII/IIb type II receptors (orange) that associate with different
  type I receptors (yellow and red) to separately activate distinct Smad signaling
  pathways.
