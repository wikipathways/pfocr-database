caption: Strategies for targeting the NKG2D/NKG2DL axis for cancer immunotherapy.
  A variety of cytokines, such as IL-2, -12, -15, and -18, can modulate the function
  of NK cells. Strategies, such as CH3SeH HDAC, microRNA, and targeting post-transcriptional
  mechanisms, also play an important role in NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity by regulating
  the NKG2DL expression on the tumor cell. Chemotherapy, irradiation and ionizing
  radiation, and current cancer therapeutic modalities induce DNA damage and upregulate
  the expression of NKG2DLs in cancer via the ATM/ATR pathway. Small molecule inhibitors
  blocking MMP and ADAM were developed to decrease shedding of soluble NKG2DLs. NKG2DL,
  NKG2D ligands; MMP, matrix metalloprotease; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloprotease;
  HDAC, histone deacetylase. This figure was created using Adobe Illustrator.
