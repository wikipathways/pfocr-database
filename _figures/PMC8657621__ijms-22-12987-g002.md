caption: Intracellular signaling pathways for GPCR. Inactive GPCR exists as a complex
  unit consisting of α subunit bound to GDP and the βγ subunits. The binding of external
  signal molecules to a GPCR makes it active and results in a conformational change.
  During conformation, the GDP of α subunits forms to GTP, and the separation of α
  and βγ subunits occurs. When an active Gα subunit dissociates from the GPCR, it
  may interact with other proteins, triggering a signaling pathway that leads to cell
  growth and motility, cell proliferation, tumor progression, invasion, metastasis
  etc., depending on the binding proteins. The figure was created using tools obtained
  from BioRender.com.
