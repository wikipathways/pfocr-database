caption: (a) Below is an illustration of the general case of sequential metabolism
  of substrate A to two products, primary metabolite B and secondary metabolite C.
  For the specific case of NR metabolism, NR = A, M1 = B, and M2 = C. The scheme assumes
  irreversible chemical steps and reversible binding. Equations for global analysis
  of NR metabolism were derived using the steady-state approximation according to
  the King-Altman method (). Because of the sequential nature of NR metabolism, the
  concentration of the [EB] species is not in rapid equilibrium; it thus depends on
  the catalysis rates k2 and k4, in addition to the dissociation rate constant for
  B, Kd,B = (k−3/k3). (b) Estimated rate constants for NR sequential metabolism with
  and without ANF. Catalytic rate constants are not microscopic rate constants because
  they include each of the rates in the P450 cycle, and so represent a flux through
  a pathway with multiple branching points rather than a rate constant.
