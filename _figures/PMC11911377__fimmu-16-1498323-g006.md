caption: Mechanisms of cGAS-STING pathway activation in MASLD/MASH. A high-fat diet
  contributes to mitochondrial damage and ER oxidative stress, leading to the release
  of mtDNA and other damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Cytosolic mtDNA
  activates the cGAS-STING pathway, resulting in the production of cGAMP. cGAMP acts
  as a second messenger, binding to and activating STING located on the ER membrane.
  Activated STING translocates to the Golgi apparatus where it recruits and activates
  TBK1. TBK1 subsequently phosphorylates IRF3, promoting its dimerization and nuclear
  translocation. Nuclear IRF3, along with NF-κB, induces the transcription of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, contributing to the inflammatory response characteristic of MASLD/MASH.
  Additionally, dead cells can release dsDNA, which further activates the cGAS-STING
  pathway, amplifying the inflammatory response
