caption: General anthocyanidin synthesis pathway and expression profile of DEGs involved
  in the pathway. Gene expression is normalized using FPKM and represents the means
  of three biological replicates. Expression values are presented as FPKM normalized
  log10-transformed counts. The color represents relative gene expression levels.
  While the horizontal direction shows the sample names, the vertical direction shows
  the names of genes involved in osmotic regulation. CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI,
  chalcone isomerase, F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FNS, flavone synthase; FLS, flavonol
  synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase.
