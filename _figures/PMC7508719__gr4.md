caption: 'Schematic of the KEGG “TGF-β Signaling Pathway” showing differentially regulated
  genes for the Alizarin (+) treatments (TCPS_OS, PCL_NF, PDLLA_NF). Values are from
  median normalization to 6-treatments (PCL_NF, PCL_SC, PDLLA_NF, PDLLA_SC, TCPS,
  TCPS_OS). Red boxes indicate up-regulation and green boxes indicate down-regulation
  of genes relative to TCPS. Shading of the boxes indicates the magnitude of the log2
  fold change relative to TCPS using values calculated in  (determined as follows:
  log2(Treatment) – log2(TCPS)). Arrows indicate activation and T-blocks indicate
  inhibition of a downstream component. Dashed arrows and dashed T-blocks indicate
  less recognized associations. Reprinted with permission from Ref. [].'
