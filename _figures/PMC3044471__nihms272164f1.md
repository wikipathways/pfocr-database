caption: Model of the hypoxia-sensing and signaling pathway based on the neutrophil
  macrophage NAD(P)H oxidase. It is likely that oxygen is sensed by a heme protein.
  Cobalt may simulate deoxy-heme by substituting for iron in the protoporphyrin of
  this heme protein. A flavin group (FL) is likely to participate in the transfer
  of electrons that enables oxygen to be reduced to superoxide (•O2−)via the oxidation
  of NADPH to NADP. In neutrophil/macrophage activation, cytosolic proteins p47, p67
  and Rac participate in a macromolecular assembly. However, there is no evidence
  that these molecules or gp91 or p22 participate in the oxygen-sensing and signal
  transduction pathway. The formation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) from
  peroxide is catalysed by iron in the iron-dependent Fenton reaction. It is likely
  that these oxidizing equivalents mediate the degradation of HIF-1α subunits in the
  proteosome, thereby preventing the formation of the activated HIF-1 heterodimer
  that is required for the induction of hypoxia-responsive gene expression.
