caption: Schema of the components and signal transduction of the Nodal/Activin pathway
  starting with different concentrations of ligands external to the ES cell lipid
  bilayer membrane and terminating with the pSmad2 transcriptional complex regulating
  Oct4 and different subsets of target genes in the nucleus. Red arrows show the signal
  transduction circuit, black arrows show transcription and translation of pSmad2
  target genes while green inhibitory lines indicate negative feedback. Protein names
  in red are targets identified in the microarray analysis and/or pSmad2 ChIP-Seq.
  Color gradients from red to green denote components exhibiting a dose-dependent
  response from high (+) to low (–) activity. Plots represent the graded, high and
  low signaling dominant models of pSmad2 binding during differential signaling with
  the vertical axis showing the level of binding against the horizontal axis with
  increasing signaling levels from left to right. Different cell fate decisions and
  the events triggering them are indicated by lines and arrows in red to green color
  gradients.
