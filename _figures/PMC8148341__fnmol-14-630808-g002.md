caption: 'Exosome formation and release. Endocytic pathway: Early endosomes are vesicles
  that originate by endocytosis at the plasma membrane. The membrane of the endosome
  then bud inwardly into the lumen of the endosome and form multivesicular bodies
  (MVBs). Secretory MVBs (sMVBs) are the cellular source of exosomes. sMVBs then fuse
  with the plasma membrane, releasing exosomes into the extracellular space. Secretory
  pathway: In the process of endosome and MVBs formation, the Golgi complex fuses
  with the membrane of endosome or MVBs and thus leading to the mixed membrane constituents
  of exosomes, including proteins from the plasma membrane or Golgi complex. Degradative
  MVBs (dMVBs) subsequently fuse with the lysosome, leading to MVBs content degradation,
  thus lysosome dysfunction directly influences the exosome release. Inhibiting E3
  ubiquitin ligase Peli-1 or mitochondria fission protein Drp-1 in activated microglia
  might help to improve lysosome function and restore autophagy flux, hence regulating
  exosomes release. Other key targets to regulate exosome release include sphingomyelinase-2
  (SMNase) and P2X7 receptors. SMNase is the receptor of small molecular GW4869 and
  the activation of which inhibits exosome release. P2X7 receptors can bind with ATP
  and promote the exosome release.'
