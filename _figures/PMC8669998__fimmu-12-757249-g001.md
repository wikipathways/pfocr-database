caption: Overview of type I interferon induction and signalling. Activation of PRRs
  such as TLR4, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and RIG-I results in signal transduction and activation
  of the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7, leading to production of IFN-I. IFN-I
  binds to the IFNAR1/IFNAR2 heterodimer and signals in both a paracrine and autocrine
  manner via the JAK/STAT pathway to upregulate interferon regulated genes which act
  to protect the host against noxious agents such as viruses and bacteria.
