caption: Proposed model for KAR trafficking in hippocampal neurons. GluR6-containing
  KARs are internalized in response to kainate or NMDA stimulation and rapidly targeted
  to the early endosomal compartment. They are then differentially sorted to either
  a recycling (in A, under basal conditions (dashed lines) and in B, following NMDARs
  activation) or a degradative pathway (in A, following direct KARs activation). The
  NMDAR-dependent GluR6 endocytosis requires Ca2+ (B), whereas direct activation of
  GluR6-containing KARs occurs in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. PKC plays a key
  role in the KAR endocytosis since its inhibition by calphostin C almost completely
  abolished both NMDA- and kainate-induced GluR6 endocytosis whereas its activation
  using PMA leads to an increase of GluR6 internalization only when neurons are stimulated
  with kainate (A). The inhibition of PKA using the specific inhibitor H89 also reduces
  the amount of GluR6 internalized in response to NMDAR activation (B).
