caption: 'Reactions are numbered according to the key. For the sake of brevity we
  refer to the reactions by their number instead of their name throughout this paper.
  The stoichiometry of each reaction is 1 to 1, except for reaction 1 where Glc +
  2ADP + 2NAD+ → 2Pyr + 2ATP + 2NADH and reaction 8 where 2Pyr ⇌ Aclac. Intermediates
  are abbreviated as follows: Ac: acetate; Acal: acetaldehyde; Acet: acetoin; Aclac:
  acetolactate; Acp: acetyl phosphate; Glc: glucose; Lac: lactate; But: 2,3-butanediol;
  Pyr: pyruvate; EtOH: ethanol; ϕA: ATP/ADP; ϕC: acetyl-CoA/CoA; ϕN: NADH/NAD+.'
