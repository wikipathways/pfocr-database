    Lactate (LAC) affects neuronal excitation as a signal molecule in the brain. (A)
    Exogenous lactate was excitatory to locus coeruleus (LC) neurons via an unknown
    receptor-mediated pathway (). (B) Lactate over physiological levels acted as an

    (over physiological levels) induced an outward current mediated by G protein–gated
    inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) through activating GPR81, resulting in hyperpolarization
    and epileptiform firing decrease in the subicular neurons (). (D) Lactate could
    regulate acid-sensing ion channel−1a (ASIC1a) by decreasing pH to Stimulate inhibitory
    neuronal excitation (). AC, adenylate cyclase; PKA, protein kinase A; cAMP, cyclic
