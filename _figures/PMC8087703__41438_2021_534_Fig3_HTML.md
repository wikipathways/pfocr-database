caption: a Venn diagram analysis of DEGs in chrysanthemum leaves. b DEGs involved
  in the Ca2+signaling pathway. c DEGs involved in the ABA signaling pathway. Expression
  values are presented as log2 (R20/WT fold change in induced expression). Blocks
  with colors indicate decreased (green) or increased (red) values. Each column represents
  the expression values at 0, 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 hpi from left to right. Each row
  represents a DEG, with its gene ID shown
