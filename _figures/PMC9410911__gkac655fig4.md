caption: The biosynthetic pathway of vitamin B12 in S.meliloti and different strategies
  to increase the production of vitamin B12. (A) Schematic of the vitamin B12synthesis
  pathway of S.meliloti. At the uroporphyrinogen III node, the metabolic pathway is
  divided into two parts, and different regulatory strategies are adopted. The red
  box shows the uroporphyrinogen III synthesis module. The first strategy is to increase
  the production of uroporphyrinogen III by overexpressing hemABCD to provide sufficient
  substrate for the synthesis of vitamin B12. The black box shows the siroheme by-product
  generation module. Strategy II aims to adjust the metabolic flow distribution of
  precirrin-2, reduce the generation of siroheme and avoid the consumption of precirrin-2
  to promote the synthesis of vitamin B12. (B) The process of strain construction,
  fermentation and vitamin B12 detection in cultures of the engineered strains.
