caption: Hyperglycemia inhibits antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase,
  glutathione (GSH)) and induces generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive
  nitrogen species (RNS) from different sources such as mitochondrial electron transport
  chain (ETC), NADPH oxidase, cycloxygenase (COX2), advanced glycation end products
  (AGEs), protein kinase C (PKC), polyol pathway and nitric oxide synthase (NOS).
  Hyperglycemia-induced generated ROS and RNS, cause lipid peroxidation and oxidative
  damage of protein and DNA resulting in production of biomarkers such as lipid peroxides
  and nitrotyrosin. Lipid and protein modification by hyperglycemia-induced oxidative
  stress leads to upregulation of VEGF and activation of NFκB. VEGF and NFκB-dependent
  signaling pathway causes retinal vascular and neuronal damage associated with diabetic
  retinopathy such as hyperpermeability, leukostasis, apoptosis and angiogenesis
