caption: Environment state and adipocyte’s changes in normal vs. obese conditions.
  (A) In normal conditions in the adipose tissue (AT), M2 macrophages are distributed
  evenly throughout the tissue. Lean AT also contains CD4+ T cells—TH2 and Treg cells—and
  preadipocytes that contribute to the anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitive state.
  As a result, adipokines such as adiponectin are increased, whereas leptin content
  is decreased. In adipocytes, the regulation of differentiation and proliferation
  occurs by activating the insulin receptor (IR), which also controls the incorporation
  of glucose. Moreover, IR regulates the activation of AMPK in an energy state-dependent
  manner, promoting β-oxidation and adiponectin expression, resulting in the control
  of inflammation. (B) In obese AT, specific immune cells such as macrophages increase
  their number by local proliferation and contribute to secreting pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and ROS. In addition, the content of other immune cells also changes with
  an increase in Neutrophils, CD4+ Th1, and CD8+ T cell numbers, a reduction in Treg
  cell as well as an increase in the number of preadipocytes. As a result, the production
  of pro-inflammatory adipokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and MCP1 increases; consequently,
  there is an increased immune cell infiltration and a polarization of the phenotype.
  Furthermore, in adipocytes, the augmented inflammatory state disrupts the regulation
  of signaling pathways such as JNK-ERK, which involves the inhibition of the IR by
  PTPB1, the up-regulation of PPAR-γ, and the synthesis of lipids as well as of the
  inflammatory NFkB pathway, which is also enhanced by overexpressed Leptin in an
  obese condition.
