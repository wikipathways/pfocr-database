caption: Cellular and molecular interactions between CLL cells and the tissue microenvironment.
  B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is a key pathway for promoting survival and growth
  of CLL B cells, mediated via upstream kinases SYK and PI3Kδ, and further downstream
  signaling detailed in Fig. . In addition, interactions between CLL cells and T cells
  are central for the expansion of the malignant CLL clone. Interactions via CD40,
  expressed on the CLL cells, and CD40 ligand (CD154), as well as cytokines (IL4,
  TNFα, IFNγ, CCL3, CCL4), play an important role in CLL-T-cell cross talk. CLL cells
  are attracted and retained in tissue microenvironments, such as the secondary lymphatic
  tissues and the bone marrow, by chemokines that are constitutively secreted by tissue
  mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and monocyte-derived nurselike cells (NLC). These
  stromal cells establish chemokine gradients, such as CXCL12 and CXCL13 gradients
  that attract CLL cells via the corresponding G-protein-coupled chemokine receptors,
  CXCR4 and CXCR5, respectively. Adhesion molecules on the CLL cells, such as CD49d
  (VLA-4), cooperate with chemokine receptors during this process. NLC also express
  BAFF and APRIL, as well as CD31 for activation of respective ligands on the leukemia
  cells, promoting growth and survival of the CLL cells
