caption: Histone variants and their importance in diverse biological pathways. (A)
  Histone variants, such as H3.3, shown in , are integrated into nucleosomes by a
  yet not understood mechanism. New data suggest that an ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling
  complex related to SWI/SNF is involved in the replacement of histones with their
  variant counterparts (shown here is the exchange of H2A with the variant H2A.X (depicted
  in blue)). (B) Importance of the histone variant H2A.X (depicted in blue) in DNA
  damage repair. Upon DSB, serine 139 in H2A.X is phosphorylated by phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase, a mark that is recognised by a complex of DNA repair proteins (DRP) that
  restore the structure of the DNA. After successful DSB repair, serine 139 is dephosphorylated
  by a yet unknown phosphatase. (C) Deficiency of histone variant H2A.X (blue circle)
  has critical implications for genomic stability. As shown in , H2A.X is important
  in DNA damage repair and needs p53 to arrest the cell to allow DSB repair. Alternatively,
  if the DNA damage is severe, p53 activates the apoptosis pathway, preventing thereby
  mutations and/or chromosome translocations (left site). Loss of both H2A.X and p53
  can lead to chromosomal rearrangements after DSB and result in cancer (right site).
