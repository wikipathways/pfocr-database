caption: The cGAS–STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing. (By Figdraw) cGAS-STING
  is part of the innate immune system activated by cytosolic DNA. The specific process
  is that when abnormal DNA is present in the cytoplasmic matrix, this kind of cytosolic
  DNA binds to and activates cGAS, which catalyzes the synthesis of 2 ‘ 3 ′ - cGAMP
  from ATP and GTP. 2 ‘ 3 ′ - cGAMP binds to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) adaptor
  STING, which traffics to the ER - Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the
  Golgi apparatus. STING then activates TBK-1 and IKK. TBK1 phosphorylates STING,
  which in turn recruits IRF-3 to be phosphorylated by TBK-1. Phosphorylated IRF-3
  dimerizes and then enters the nucleus, inducing the expression of type I interferon
  (IFN1) and other inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1b, and IL-6. STING also
  releases NF-kB into the nucleus through activation of the kinase IKK, which acts
  synergistically with IRF3 to amplify the induction of IFN, as well as other immunomodulatory
  molecules
