caption: Overview of the model reconstruction process. Pathway addition was based
  on the reported presence of products and/or enzyme activities reported for A. niger.
  This was supplemented with enzymes reported present in other aspergilli. Pathway
  databases (KEGG) were used where possible to fill gaps in pathways. If necessary,
  reactions were inferred to close the remaining gaps. Finally, ORFs were connected
  to reactions using the CBS 513.88 sequence annotation. No new reactions were added
  based solely on sequence information.
