caption: An illustration of glucose metabolism leading from the glycolytic pathway
  to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and electron transport chain (ETC). (A) Targets
  and inhibitors of the glycolytic pathway, TCA, and ETC. These inhibitors target
  key enzymes/components, thereby regulating glucose metabolism. The bold red lines
  with rounded ends indicate the inhibitory effect of the various agents on target
  enzymes/components. Classical anticancer drugs like cisplatin, As2O3, and doxorubicin
  can modulate glycolytic enzymes. Some natural compounds (shown in the green color
  font) such as resveratrol, genistein, and shikonin can modify the activity of these
  enzymes. The blue arrows represent how metabolites of the glycolytic pathway contribute
  to other key biosynthetic pathways that support cancer cell survival and growth.
  The precursors for de novo biosynthesis of nucleotides are derived from ribose 5-phosphate
  of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which is a side branch of glucose metabolic
  pathway. Likewise, 3-PG, a glycolytic intermediate, serves as a precursor for amino
  acid synthesis, thus fueling anabolic reactions necessary for cancer growth. Similarly,
  an enhanced lipogenesis controlled by an oncogenic signaling is often associated
  with an increased tumor glycolysis. Here, DHAP acts as an intermediate for lipid
  biosynthesis. (B) The various enzymes/components that contribute to drug resistance
  in cancers and how the non-glycolytic functions of these enzymes contribute to cancer
  progression is highlighted. The transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1
  (HIF-1), upregulates the expression of the key transporters and glycolytic enzymes,
  thereby promoting adaptive cancer cell metabolism and supporting tumor progression.
