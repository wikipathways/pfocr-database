caption: The name in bold between parentheses corresponds to the gene coding for the
  dominant isoform in adult liver. Constitutive deletion of E2F2 gene promotes increased
  phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) relative content, a low phosphatidylcholine (PC):PE
  ratio, increased expression of genes required for PE formation and deregulated expression
  of some genes involved both in the Kennedy pathway for PC synthesis and the deacylation:reacylation
  arm of PC turnover. Such permanent decrease in the PC:PE ratio may impact phospholipid-related
  biological responses. CTP, cytidinetriphosphate; CDP, cytidinediphosphate; LPC,
  lysophosphatidylcholine, PA, phosphatidic acid; TAG, triacylglycerol. The Lands
  (deacylation-reacylation) cycle consists of phospholipases A2 (or A1) and acyl:CoA
  lysophospholipid acyltransferases. We only show here the deacylation/reacylation
  of phosphatidylcholine. Transcript upregulations are shown in red and downregulations
  in green.
