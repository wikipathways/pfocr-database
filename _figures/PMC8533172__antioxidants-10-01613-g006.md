caption: Schematic representation of proposed pathway for formation of advanced glycation
  end products (AGEs). Early stages of AGE formation involve development of intermediate
  products. At this stage, free radicles are also released. The intermediate products
  disintegrate to form AGEs. The plant or conventional drug can inhibit the formation
  of AGEs at this stage and prevent their progression. The second stage involves interaction
  of AGE and receptor for AGEs (RAGE), leading to the activation of various genes
  such as NF-κB target genes involved in inflammation. NF-κB is an inducible transcription
  factor and when activated it can, in turn, stimulate other transcription genes which
  regulate inflammation. In the final phase, the inflammation and oxidative stress
  due to free radicles lead to diabetes complications.
