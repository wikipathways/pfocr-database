  oxidation; PUFAs, polyunsaturated fatty acids; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; Ac-CoA,
  acetyl CoA; αKG, α-ketoglutarate; NAD(H), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; MPC, mitochondrial
  pyruvate carrier; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; HBP,
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; SGOC, serine-glycine-one carbon pathway; ETC, electron
  transport chain.
