caption: (a) 5 h after r-I/R in the myocardial area subjected to r-I/R. A strong activation
  of cytokines, their receptors, and downstream signaling molecules of the JAK/STAT
  and other pathways were found. In particular, strong up regulation of hexokinase
  2 (HK2), the hepatocyte growth factor nuclear receptor (MET), interferon regulatory
  factor 1 (IRF1), alpha-crystallin B chain (CRYAB), and the glucose transporter Glut4
  (SLC2A4) resulted, all of which are enhancing either angiogenesis or energy consumption
  (glucose uptake and glycolysis). Upregulation of peptidases neprilysin (MME) and
  dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), both mediating substance P hydrolysis and inactivation,
  also indirectly regulates angiogenesis through NO production. (b) 5 h after r-I/R
  in the non-ischemic area. The genes with differential expression in the non-ischemic
  area are somewhat similar to those found in the ischemic area. A stronger activation
  of chemokines (CXCL9) and members of the JAK/STAT pathway (JAK3, STAT1) was detected,
  but no significant regulation of downstream modulators of angiogenesis and glycolysis.
  This indicates a weaker effect in the remote area, which is not directly affected
  by ischemia. (c) 24 h after r-I/R in the myocardial area subjected to r-I/R. At
  this time point, a strong up regulation of chemokines was encountered, with a less
  pronounced differential expression of components of the JAK/STAT pathway (upregulation
  of STAT1, but not STAT3 or JAK3) or of the NF-κB pathway. Downregulation of critical
  components of the regulation of collagen production was found, and reduced expression
  of peptidases MME and DPP4, which enhance angiogenesis through derepression of substance
  P. (d) 24 h after r-I/R in the non-ischemic area. In the non-ischemic area, lower
  regulatory effects were detected. The alterations in chemokines and the JAK/STAT
  pathway is similar to the ischemic area at this time point, but no effect on genes
  that are essential for collagen production or substance P inhibition was present.
