caption: Tumor-derived vesicles and induced signaling modulation in various immune
  cells. Tumor-derived vesicles play a critical role in modulating immune signaling
  pathways. These vesicles carry a diverse array of molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins,
  and lipids, which interact with various immune cell populations to alter their function
  and phenotype. Tumor-derived exosomes also exert immunosuppressive effects by interfering
  with immune responses and cytotoxic functions of immune cells. For instance, tumor
  cells secrete exosomes enriched with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which
  are taken up by macrophages. These EGFR+ exosomes modulate innate immune responses
  by deregulating interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) through mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase 2 (MEKK2), thereby dampening immunity. Furthermore, tumor-derived
  microvesicles and exosomes carrying ligands for the NK group 2 member D (NKG2D)
  receptor downregulate NKG2D expression on DCs, impairing their cytotoxic activity.
  This suppression of immune effector functions contributes to immune escape and enhances
  tumor survival within the microenvironment. One of the key mechanisms by which tumor-derived
  vesicles impact immune function involves their interaction with DCs. Cancer cells
  release tumor-derived exosomes carrying double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which are internalized
  by DCs, leading to their activation and the release of type I IFN. These findings
  highlight the role of tumor-derived vesicles in shaping DC-mediated immune responses,
  which can either enhance antitumor immunity or facilitate immune evasion. Another
  significant aspect of tumor-derived exosomes is their role in the recruitment and
  expansion of MDSCs, which are key players in tumor-induced immunosuppression. Prostate
  cancer-derived exosomes have been shown to promote the migration of MDSCs into the
  tumor microenvironment by upregulating CXCR4 via the TLR2/NF-κB signaling pathway.
  MDSCs exhibited enhanced migration toward exosome-enriched environments, an effect
  that was mitigated by the CXCR4-specific inhibitor AMD3100. Analyses further confirmed
  a marked increase in CXCR4 expression in MDSCs upon exosome stimulation, along with
  elevated TLR2 and NF-κB activation. Blocking TLR2 with a specific inhibitor (C29)
  significantly reduced the expression of phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) and CXCR4, reinforcing
  the notion that TLR2-mediated NF-κB activation is a key driver of MDSC recruitment
  via the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis. In addition to their effects on innate immune cells,
  tumor-derived exosomes have been implicated in modulating T lymphocyte function.
  Prostate cancer-derived exosomes have been shown to integrate with T lymphocytes,
  leading to the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
  Phosphorylated p38 MAPK subsequently triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,
  activating the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP signaling axis, which culminates in T cell apoptosis.
  Interestingly, the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) was upregulated following
  p38 MAPK activation, suggesting a potential negative feedback mechanism to regulate
  MAPK signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK using SB203580 attenuated
  ER stress, thereby protecting T lymphocytes from apoptosis. Further investigations
  into tumor-derived vesicle-mediated immune modulation have uncovered a link between
  IL-6 and the activation of the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway in tumor cells. Specifically,
  exosomes from TAMs were found to promote the expression of eukaryotic initiation
  factor 4A3 (EIF4A3) in breast cancer cells through JAK2-STAT3 activation. Gene set
  enrichment analysis (GSEA) confirmed the significant upregulation of genes associated
  with the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in breast cancer cells co-cultured with TAM-derived
  exosomes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays validated
  the direct interaction between STAT3 and the EIF4A3 promoter. In the context of
  neutrophil, gastric cancer-derived exosomes have been shown to prolong neutrophil
  survival and promote the expression of inflammatory factors, further enhancing gastric
  cancer cell migration. Gastric cancer-derived exosome -mediated neutrophil activation
  is primarily driven by the high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) protein, which interacts
  with TLR4 to activate the NF-κB pathway. This interaction triggers an autophagic
  response in neutrophils, reinforcing their pro-tumor activity. Blocking HMGB1/TLR4
  interactions, inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, or suppressing autophagy reversed gastric
  cancer-derived exosome-induced neutrophil activation. These findings suggest that
  gastric cancer-derived exosomes facilitate a tumor-supportive neutrophil phenotype
  through HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB signaling, shedding light on the complex interplay between
  exosomes and immune cells in shaping the tumor microenvironment
