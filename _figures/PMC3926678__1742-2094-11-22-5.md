caption: Repetitive hypoxic preconditioning suppresses adaptive immune responses in
  resident B cells prior to stroke. (A) Microarray analysis predicted a repetitive
  hypoxic preconditioning (RHP)-induced activation of IL-4 in B-T cell interactions
  to suppress downstream transcriptional regulators interferon regulatory factor (IRF)1,
  IRF4, and IRF8 and the cytokine TNF. Downstream molecules are coded for upregulation
  (red) and downregulation (green) according to expression in the data set. Blue lines
  lead to inhibition, whereas yellow lines indicate interactions inconsistent with
  the state of the downstream molecule. (B) Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related
  transcription and receptor responses in RHP-treated B cells. All molecules shown
  are significantly downregulated (green) or upregulated (red) by RHP and are identified
  by gene name with the human homolog in parentheses below. (C) Heat map showing downregulated
  (blue) and upregulated (orange) biological function pathways related to protein
  synthesis, including antibody production, in RHP-treated B cells compared to untreated
  control mice. Significance is only shown for pathways with z-score > −2. All significance
  and graphs generated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.
