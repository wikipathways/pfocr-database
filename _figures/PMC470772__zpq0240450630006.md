caption: Unified model explaining the role of polyamines in the response of wild-type
  and transgenic plants expressing Dadc under abiotic stress conditions. The model
  is considered in more detail in Discussion. Histograms show relative polyamine levels
  measured in each type of plant. Once putrescine levels exceed the threshold shown,
  the synthesis of spermidine and spermine is triggered, resulting in protection against
  drought and other forms of stress.
