caption: 'Translational challenges with systemic and local cell delivery. (A-D) Therapeutic
  cell production / conditioning (e.g., 2D vs. 3D culture and cytokine priming) and
  the mode of cell delivery (e.g., systemic intravascular infusion vs. local injection)
  have a major impact on the cell product''s immunogenic properties (shown in A),
  and consequent rapid triggering of innate and adaptive immune responses (shown in
  B,C), thus affecting its therapeutic efficacy, engraftment and tumorigenicity (shown
  in D). The MSC product''s immunogenic properties are affected by numerous cell-bound
  and secreted immunoregulatory mediators (e.g., complement regulators, coagulation
  regulator TFPI, or regulators of the adaptive immune response, such as co-stimulatory
  molecule expression, sHLA-G and galectin-1). The cells can also exhibit a number
  of immunogenic features, such as procoagulant TF-expression, cellular stress signals
  (e.g., PS), and immunogenic antigens (e.g., allo, xeno, and blood groups). (B) The
  innate coagulation and complement cascade systems are two of the major effector
  arms of the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) that can recognize
  blood-incompatible therapeutic cell features and thus trigger the detrimental thromboinflammation
  compromising cellular therapeutics. The innate immune cascade systems employ multiple
  sophisticated molecular sensors (e.g., FVII and FXII, or C1q and MBL, respectively),
  to recognize aberrant cell surface molecular features on infused therapeutic cells
  (e.g., TF and PS, respectively), which can trigger innate immune cascade activation
  and amplification by effector cells (e.g., platelets, PMNs, monocytes/macrophages,
  and T/B cells), potentially leading to adverse reactions (e.g., cell lysis, inflammation,
  sequestration and rejection). (C) Innate and adaptive effector cell modulation:
  triggering of IBMIR and therapeutic cell injury/disintegration promotes the release
  of various bioactive molecules, in itself and from dying MSCs, upon crosstalk with
  the responsive host immune system, such as activated clotting factors (e.g., thrombin),
  anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), opsonins (iC3b, and C3d/g), and MSC-derived constituents
  (e.g., microparticles, cytokines and growth factors) in a highly conditional manner,
  thus greatly amplifying the initial signal, leading to modulation of multiple effector
  cell types. This can result in alloimunization and consecutive cellular and humoral
  responses (e.g., T-cells and B-cells alloantibodies), but also in the induction
  and release of multiple immunoregulatory and regenerative cell types and mediators
  (e.g., Tregs, Mregs, TolDCs, MPs, and PMs). (D) A large fraction of the infused
  therapeutic cells is lost within the first hours to days of infusion due to the
  triggering of instant innate immune responses, which can be furthermore aggravated
  by triggering of adaptive immune responses in case of allogeneic cell products.
  Studies on MSC persistence in vivo have shown prolonged survival, dwell-time, and
  engraftment by alternative routes of delivery (e.g., local injection in conjunction
  with biomaterials), although long-term engraftment is very limited and ectopic tissue
  formation rarely reported. Currently, patient clinical responses are still sub-optimal
