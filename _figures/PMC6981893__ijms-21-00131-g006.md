caption: Inhibition of hypericin on ROS-mediated NF-κB signaling and target gene expression
  in 4T1 cells. Hyperoside inhibited the activation of the NF-κB pathway and reduced
  translocation of p-p65 in the nucleus by reducing ROS production in 4T1 cells. Inhibition
  of NF-κB down-regulates the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl-2
  and XIAP, but it also induced the accumulation of Bax, which leads to mitochondrial
  dysfunction and leads to apoptosis by activating caspase-3.
