caption: 'Proposed mechanism of action for metformin. Left: A low dose of metformin
  interferes with the vacuolar H+-ATPase in the lysosomal proton pump (v-ATPase).
  The interaction between metformin and PEN2 (presenilin enhancer protein 2) forms
  a complex involving ATP6AP1. The AMPK-dependent model of metformin-induced inhibition
  of gluconeogenesis is based on the activation of the LKB1–AMPK signaling pathway.
  Middle: Metformin causes a slight inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain
  complex I in the liver, which results in a moderate reduction in ATP production
  and an increase in AMP (inhibiting Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphatase Deficiency FBP1 and
  adenylate cyclase AC) levels in the cells. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is
  activated by the metformin-induced rise in the AMP-to-ATP ratio and increases GLP1
  and inactivates/inhibits G6Pase(glucose-6-phosphatase), PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase), and HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A). The inhibition
  of complex I by metformin is also accompanied by an increased ratio of lactate/pyruvate,
  and reduced glucose synthesis. Right: Mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (mGPDH)-dependent. Because metformin directly inhibits mGPDH, there is a decrease
  in lactate gluconeogenesis, a reduction in the activity of the glycerol–phosphate
  shuttle (which moves NADH from the cytosol to the mitochondria), and a rise in the
  cytosolic redox state (NADH:NAD+). “↑” increase, “↓” decrease. Parts of the figure
