caption: 'Experimental methods for validating CDCs using dot and bar stimuli. The
  disk labeled “eyeball” shows the equidistant projection of the eyeball surface ((C)),
  where O corresponds to the center of the visual field. (A) The cell response to
  the dot stimulus with a position (α,β) on the eyeball is recorded and then voted
  for the position (α,β) on the disk. Performing this voting by changing the (α,β)
  of this stimulus causes a ring-like pattern of cell responses, whose center and
  radius are (α0,β0) and r0, to occurs only for the cell CDC(α0,β0,r0). This pattern
  validates this recorded cell to be the cell CDC (α0,β0,r0). (B) A method for validating
  the network () that detects curvature circles is shown. This method is performed
  in two steps. In the first step, a bar with the orientation θ and position (α,β)
  is presented on the eyeball as a stimulus, and the cell response to it is recorded.
  Then, this bar is drawn on the disk, with its intensity equal to the cell response.
  Performing this drawing for all θ and (α,β) produces a ring-like envelope composed
  of the bars, only for the cell CDC (α0,β0,r0): the center and radius of this ring
  are (α0,β0) and r0, respectively. Thus, this ring validates this recorded cell to
  be the cell CDC(α0,β0,r0) that detects the circle corresponding to this ring. In
  the second step, this ring can be constructed by tracing back the network () from
  the cell CDC(α0,β0,r0) validated above, and thus confirming the coincidence between
  this constructed ring and the ring in (B) allows the execution of this network to
  be validated.'
