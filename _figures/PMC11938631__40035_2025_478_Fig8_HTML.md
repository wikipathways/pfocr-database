caption: 'Major common pathways regulating BBB integrity after TBI and in AD. The
  BBB relies on three key structures for its physical barrier function: the BECs,
  tight junctions between BECs, and the basement membrane. The BECs exhibit low levels
  of vesicle trafficking, limiting transcellular transport or transcytosis, while
  tight junctions prevent uncontrolled paracellular passage. The basement membrane
  connects BECs with pericytes and astrocytes, forming the neurovascular unit and
  facilitating communication within this network. The function and integrity of the
  BBB are governed by multiple interacting pathways. Dysregulation of these pathways
  following TBI or in AD leads to increased BBB permeability. APOE4 and mTOR signaling
  trigger the activation of MMP-9, which degrades junction and basement membrane proteins,
  promoting uncontrolled paracellular passage. In contrast, activation of TGF-β, Shh,
  or Wnt signaling upregulates the expression of junction proteins, enhancing BBB
  stability and reducing this passage. Mfsd2a, a lipid transporter, cell-autonomously
  suppresses transcytosis at the BBB. Loss of Mfsd2a expression increases transcellular
  transport, while promoting its expression—such as through overexpression or WNT
  signaling—reduces this transport. Created with BioRender.com'
