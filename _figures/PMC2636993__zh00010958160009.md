caption: 'RST inhibits the first step of cholesterol/isoprenoid biosynthesis by blocking
  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, thus reducing the formation
  of mevalonate from HMG-CoA. The production of 20 carbon isoprenoid geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate
  (-PP) branches off from the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway at farnesyl-PP by the
  activity of geranylgeranyl-PP synthase. Geranylgeranyl-PP is utilized by geranylgeranyl
  transferases (GGTs): Rab GGT (RGGT) and GGT 1. RGGT geranylgeranylates proteins
  of the Rab family, whereas GGT 1 is responsible for perhaps all other protein geranylgeranylation.
  GGTI-286 is a selective inhibitor of GGT 1, and (S)-(−)-PA inhibits both GGT 1 and
  RGGT. In the present study, RST induced resistance to OGD in cultured rat cortical
  neurons that was reversed by coapplication of mevalonate and GGPP, but not by cholesterol.
  Furthermore, PA, but not GGTI-286, exerted neuronal preconditioning similar to RST.
  Therefore, decreased RGGT activity due to geranylgeranyl-PP depletion appears to
  be important in the mechanism of RST-induced neuroprotection against OGD.'
