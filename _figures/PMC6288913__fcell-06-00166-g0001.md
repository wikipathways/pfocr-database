caption: 'Schematic model of the HCV life cycle and involved Rab proteins. The entry
  of the HCV lipoviroparticles (LVPs) occurs in a coordinated way by binding of the
  LVPs to specific (co)receptors. The LVPs initially bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans
  (HSPG) and the low density-lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) resulting in a local accumulation.
  After binding to scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SR-BI) a conformational change
  of E2 enables the binding to CD81 which then activates signal transduction via the
  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The LVP-loaded CD81 migrates by lateral
  diffusion to the tight junctions (TJ) where interaction with the TJ proteins occluding
  (OCLN) and claudin-1 (CLDN1) takes place and the LVPs are internalized via clathrin
  mediated endocytosis [Additional (co)receptors are: L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, ephidrin type
  A receptor 2 (EPHA2), Niemann-Pick C1-like receptor 1 (NPC1L1) and transferrin receptor
  (TnfR)]. After maturation of early endosomes to late endosomes the release of the
  viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm occurs in a pH-dependent manner. Hereby, Rab5A
  is required for acidification as it transports the vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase)
  ATP6v0a1 from the trans-Golgi (TGN) network toward endocytotic vesicles. The trafficking
  from early to late endosomes and finally lysosomes for degradation is regulated
  by Rab5 and Rab7. The TJ proteins OCLN and CLDN1 are recycled under control of Rab13.
  The uncoated positive-strand RNA is transported to the rough endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) where it serves as template for the viral polyprotein synthesis. HCV infection
  leads to a massive rearrangement of intracellular ER derived membranes leading to
  the formation of a specific microenvironment, the membranous web (MW). The MW consists
  of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and multi-membrane vesicles (MMVs) embedded in
  a membranous matrix where HCV replication occurs in replication complexes (RCs).
  Rab5A and Rab7 are associated with the RCs. Another Rab protein that controls HCV
  replication is Rab27a. HCV assembly occurs in close proximity to the RCs. Replication
  and assembly sites are linked via cLDs. The Rab GTPases Rab18 and Rab32 are involved
  in HCV particle assembly by tethering LDs toward ER derived membranes and facilitating
  the trafficking of HCV Core and NS5A toward membrane structures involved in particle
  assembly. The exact mechanism of LVP release remains enigmatic. There is growing
  evidence that viral particles are released via the endosomal pathway rather than
  the canonical secretory route. This novel pathway includes the Rab1b-dependent transport
  of HCV particles through the Golgi compartment. Here, the Rab proteins Rab8b, 13,
  23, 32, 33 are involved. Rab11a, a classical marker for recycling endosomes further
  directs the particles toward late endosomes (Rab7a-dependent) where the particles
  are sorted either for release by fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the
  plasma membrane (Rab9a and Rab7a-dependent) in parallel to the release of exosomes
  (Rab3d- and Rab27a-dependent) or for autolysosomal degradation. For this, Rab9 together
  with TIP47 is required.'
