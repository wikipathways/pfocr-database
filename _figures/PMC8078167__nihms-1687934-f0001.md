caption: 1A. Insulin-regulated pathways in adipocytes. See text for detailed discussion.
  The dotted arrow from insulin receptor signifies that signal transduction cascade
  from the receptor to Rab10 and control of lipolysis involves multiple signaling
  intermediaries. In control of GLUT4 we highlight Rab10 because that is the only
  protein along the pathway discussed in the text. GLUT4= Glucose transporter type
  4; Rab10= Ras-related protein 10; FFAs= free fatty acids; TG=triglycerides; DNL=de
  novo lipogenesis; ChREBP= Carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein; Acetyl-CoA=
  acetyl coenzyme A.1B. Insulin action in white adipose tissue (WAT) alters fuel metabolism
  in liver and muscle via inter-tissue communication. Insulin signaling in adipocytes
  suppresses WAT lipolysis, decreasing the flux of free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol
  to the liver, and thereby contributing to the suppression of hepatic glucose production
  (HGP). FFAs, once converted to acetyl CoA, act as positive allosteric modulators
  of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), the enzyme catalyzing the first step of hepatic gluconeogenesis.
  Glycerol is a gluconeogenic substrate. The reduced flux of these metabolites to
  the liver contributes to the reduction in liver glucose output in the fed state.
  HGP is also regulated by direct action of insulin to promote hepatic glycogen synthesis
  and by the effect of glucagon and other counter-regulatory hormones on glycogenolysis.
  Insulin exerts an anti-lipolytic effect in WAT which maintains insulin sensitivity
  in muscle by reducing the availability of fatty acids and their derivatives. In
  addition, insulin promotes de novo lipogenesis in WAT, indirectly by stimulating
  glucose transport through GLUT4 which activates the lipogenic transcription factor,
  ChREBP. This results in synthesis and secretion of metabolically beneficial signaling
  lipids which increase muscle insulin sensitivity. Adipocytes also synthesize and
  release adipo-cytokines which alter metabolism in liver and muscle. The role of
  insulin in the regulation of adipo-cytokines needs further investigation. Black
  arrows indicate insulin direct effects, green arrows indicate insulin indirect effects.
  GLUT4= Glucose transporter type 4; ChREBP= Carbohydrate-responsive element-binding
  protein; Acetyl-CoA= acetyl coenzyme A; PC= pyruvate carboxylase.
