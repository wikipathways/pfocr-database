caption: 'A schematic figure of the complement system. The figure shows the three
  complement activation pathways (yellow boxes), the components needed for activation
  (in black, like C3), the targets that activate complement (green), the different
  complement regulators (blue), and consequences of deficiencies of individual complement
  components leading either to infections (lilac boxes) or to complement deficiency
  syndromes (in red boxes). Explanations of the different arrow types are shown in
  the key box (bottom right). The classical pathway (top left) can be activated by
  C1q that binds to immune complexes or C-reactive protein. The lectin pathway (bottom
  left) becomes activated by mannan-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins that bind to
  carbohydrates or acetylated moieties. The alternative pathway (top right) becomes
  activated spontaneously upon interaction with a foreign surface (e.g., microbes)
  that lacks complement inhibitors. After binding of C1q, MBL, or ficolins to their
  targets, the serine esterases attached to them (C1r, C1s, MASPs) become activated
  and cleave the subsequent components C4 and C2. C4b and C2a together generate the
  classical pathway C3/C5 convertase. Activation of C3 is central to complement activation.
  It can become activated by the alternative pathway C3/C5 convertase C3bBb composed
  of C3b and the activated factor B. Factor D activates factor B and properdin (P)
  stabilizes the C3bBb enzyme. Because of involvement of C3b in C3 cleavage, a positive
  feedback is created and the alternative pathway can amplify complement activation
  regardless of the initial activation route. C3 activation products, C3b and iC3b
  are important opsonins recognized by the phagocyte C3b (CR1) and iC3b (CR3) receptors.
  After activation of C5, the five terminal plasma glycoproteins (C5b, C6, C7, C8,
  and C9) bind sequentially to each other to generate the cytolytic membrane attack
  complex (MAC). Regulation of complement activation occurs at all key steps of the
  cascade. C1r and C1s are inhibited by the plasma protein C1-inhibitor (C1-INH).
  C1-INH also inhibits analogous MBL-associated serine protease, MASP-2. Activity
  of the classical pathway C3/C5 convertase, C4b2a, is inhibited by the plasma factor
  C4b-binding protein (C4bp). The activity of the alternative pathway C3/C5 convertase,
  C3bBb, is inhibited by the regulators factor H, DAF, and MCP. On human cell membranes,
  the main inhibitor of MAC is CD59. Because of the importance of complement as defense
  and inflammatory mediator system, its deficiencies can predispose to serious diseases.
  The deficiency in the clearance part (classical pathway) can predispose to SLE,
  whereas the alternative and terminal pathway deficiencies predispose to microbial
  infections. Deficiencies of complement regulators predispose to autoreactive disorders,
  where complement is either excessively activated (HAE, DDD) or misdirected against
  self cell surfaces (C3GN, aHUS, PNH). Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is a rare consequence
  of CR3 defect. Abbreviations: SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; HAE, hereditary
  angioedema; C1-INH, C1-inhibitor; PNH, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; DDD,
  dense deposit disease; C3GN, C3 glomerulopathy; aHUS, hemolytic uremic syndrome;
  LAD, leukocyte adhesion deficiency; DAF, decay-accelerating factor; MASP, mannose-binding
  lectin-associated serine protease; CR, complement receptor; H, factor H; D, factor
  D; P, properdin; I, factor I; B, factor B; CD59, protectin; MCP, membrane cofactor
  protein.'
