caption: Rho GTPase signaling pathway represents a convergent approach to targeting
  fibrosis. Many current drugs being developed for fibrotic diseases are targeting
  specific receptors known to be involved in stimulating fibroblasts into myofibroblasts.
  Interestingly, many of these specific receptor systems converge onto Rho small GTPase
  signaling. GTP-bound active Rho can interact with downstream effector proteins,
  most notably Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) kinase
  and mouse diaphanous-related formin-1 (mDia1), which together initiate and stabilize
  actin stress fibers. This increase in F-actin and resulting decrease in G-actin
  monomers frees myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) to translocate into
  the nucleus where it cooperates with serum response factor (SRF) to induce gene
  transcription. Many MRTF/SRF target genes are known drivers of fibrosis including
  connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen;
  together this activation of gene transcription induces and maintains the activation
  of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; TGFβ, transforming
  growth factor-β.
