caption: The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-induced transcriptional program
  and its alterations in cancer. The diagram depicts mutations or alterations that
  occur in genes that encode mediators of the TGF-β signaling pathway in distinct
  types of human cancers. Shown are the transcriptional components underlying the
  principal TGF-β cytostatic responses in epithelial cells. Indicated in red are the
  targets of alterations present in distinct types of human cancers converging on
  the TGF-β target genes that mediate cell cycle arrest.
