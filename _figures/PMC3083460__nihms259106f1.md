caption: 'Schematic representation of the differences between conservative and catabolic
  methionine metabolism in normal non-proliferating hepatocytes. In the presence of
  high methionine, quiescent (differentiated) hepatocytes rely primarily on methionine
  adenosyltransferase III (MATIII), which is activated by methionine, to generate
  SAMe and maintain methionine homeostasis. Excess SAMe is then converted to homocysteine,
  by the combined action of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) and S-adenosylhomocysteine
  hydrolase, to avoid aberrant methylation reactions such as irregular methylation
  of histones and DNA. While GNMT is allosterically activated by SAMe, S-adenosylhomocysteine
  hydrolase is a reversible enzyme. Once formed, the excess homocysteine is used for
  the synthesis of cysteine and α-ketobutyrate as result of its transsulfuration (cycling
  homocysteine back to methionine is inhibited by SAMe). The transsulfuration pathway
  involves two enzymes that require pyridoxal phosphate as cofactor: cystathionine
  β-synthase (CBS), which is also allosterically activated by SAMe, and γ-cystathionase.
  Cysteine is then utilized for the synthesis of glutathione as well as other sulfur
  containing molecules such as taurine, while α-ketobutyrate is further metabolized
  in the mitochondria. We refer to this process as catabolic methionine metabolism.
  When methionine concentration is limiting MATI synthesizes most SAMe, which feeds
  the multiple methyl transferase (MTs) reactions required by the hepatic cells, to
  be then converted into homocysteine, and used primarily for the regeneration of
  methionine. This recycling of homocysteine when methionine is limiting allows normal
  methylation reactions to continue although results in reduced α-ketobutyrate and
  glutathione synthesis when compared with oxidative methionine metabolism. We refer
  to this process as conservative methionine metabolism.'
