caption: In the extrafollicular T cell-dependent (TD) pathway, marginal zone (MZ)
  dendritic cells (DCs) expressing DC inhibitory receptor 2 (DCIR2) capture protein
  antigens and present them to naive CD4+ T cells, which subsequently differentiate
  into T helper 2 (TH2) cells expressing CD40 ligand (CD40L) and interleukin-4 (IL-4).
  DCIR2+ DCs also expose antigens to MZ B cells, and signals from the B cell receptor
  (BCR) convert MZB cells into antigen-presenting cells. By establishing cognate interactions
  with TH2 cells, activated MZ B cells rapidly produce low-affinity IgGl but not IgM.
  ln an alternative pathway, lipid-reactive MZ B cells activate invariant natural
  killer T (iNKT) cells by presenting CDld-loaded glycolipids. The expression of CD40L,
  IL-4 and interferon-γ(IFNγ) by activated iNKT cells induces MZ B cells to differentiate
  into plasma blasts that secrete low-affinity IgM or IgG. In the follicular TD pathway,
  MZB cells downregulate receptors for sphin-gosine-1-phosphate (SIP) after capturing
  complement-decorated protein antigens via CD21 and CD3B. The interruption of MZ-retaining
  signals from SIP receptors stimulates MZ B cells to enter the follicle in response
  to CXC-chemokine receptor 5 (CXCRB) signals. In the follicle, MZ B cells deposit
  antigens on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and thereafter upregulate SI P receptor
  expression to exit the follicle and return to the MZ. Protein antigens displayed
  by FDCs enhance TD antibody responses by promoting the selection of follicular germinal
  centre (GC) B cells expressing a high-affinity BCR. This selection also involves
  cognate interactions between GC B cells and T follicular helper (TFH) cells expressing
  CD40L and IL-21. Ultimately, selected GC B cells differentiate into long-lived memory
  B cells or plasma cells that produce high-affinity IgG. Alternatively, MZ B cells
  capture protein antigens with or without the help of metallophilic macrophages and
  migrate to the border between the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) and the
  follicle to initiate a GC reaction after establishing a cognate interaction with
  TFH cells expressing CD40L, IL-4 or interferon-γ(IFNγ). These TFH cells probably
  emerge from the priming of naive CD4+T cells by either MZ B cells or DCs expressing
  DEC205. A subset of these TFH cells can also promote the generation of low-affinity
  extrafollicular IgM and IgG plasmablasts. CXCL13, CXC-chemokine ligand 13; TCR.
  T cell receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor.
