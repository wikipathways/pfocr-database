caption: 'The enterobacterial common antigen (ECA), O-antigen, and peptidoglycan (PG)
  biosynthesis pathways compete for a pool of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP-G) and undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P). E. coli K-12 strains do not normally
  produce O-antigen because of an insertion in wbbL. Short peptides (circles) are
  attached to the N-acetylmuramic acid (M) residue. ECA-lipid I is noted in blue.
  ECA-lipid II and III are noted in purple. PG-lipid I and II are noted in green.
  Note that the colanic acid synthesis pathway also utilizes Und-P, but this pathway
  is omitted from the schematic. Other abbreviations: Und-PP-G, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate
  N-acetylglucosamine.'
