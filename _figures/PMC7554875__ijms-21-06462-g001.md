caption: Schematic representation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Chaperone proteins are
  released by cardiac cells and bind to surface receptors on cardiac cell types activating
  specific signaling chronic inflammation. Cell surface toll-like receptors (TLR)
  are activated by Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) or Danger-Associated
  Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) to initiate intracellular signaling. Myeloid Differentiation
  Primary Response 88 (MYD88) binds to Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinase 4
  (IRAK4) and IRAK1/2. The IRAK complex interacts with TNF Receptor Associated Factor
  6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 forms a complex with Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase
  7 (MAP3K7 or TAK1), MAP3K7 Binding Protein 1 (TAB1) and 2 (TAB2). TAK1 then activates
  the IκB Kinase (IKK) complex, thus activating the Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB).
  The released NF-κB translocates into the nucleus and mediates the expression of
  a number of proinflammatory cytokine genes. In addition, TAK1 can activate the Mitogen-Activated
  Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The MAPK signaling pathway can activate
  the transcription factor Activator Protein 1 (AP-1). The activation of NF-κB and
  AP-1 contributes to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6
  and TNF-α.
