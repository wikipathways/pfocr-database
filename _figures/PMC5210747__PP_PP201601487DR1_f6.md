caption: 'Main metabolic fluxes connecting exchange metabolites Suc, Gln, Glu, and
  2-og. Panels are labeled according to cases on  (blue dots) and C, and show increasing
  growth rates from case A to case J. Exchange reactions are as follows: A, +Suc −Glu;
  G, +Glu −Gln; I, +Glu −Gln −2-og; J, +Suc +Glu −Gln −2-og. Ratio of Glu to Gln was
  unbound. Compounds in red indicate a sink or uptake of an external metabolite. Orange
  arrows in the heterocyst highlight reactions providing electrons (NADPH) for nitrogenase.
  BMG, Biomass (growth); BMM, biomass (maintenance). Enzyme names are highlighted
  in yellow. Upper cells, Heterocysts; lower cells, vegetative cells. oPPP, oxidative
  pentose-phosphate pathway; BMM, biomass (maintenance); G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate; S7P, sedoheptulose 7-phoshate; Xu5P, xylulose 5-phosphate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Pyr, pyruvate; AAT, aspartate aminotransferase; Mal, malate;
  Fum, fumarate; OAA, oxaloacetate; RuBP, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate; BMG, biomass
  (growth).'
