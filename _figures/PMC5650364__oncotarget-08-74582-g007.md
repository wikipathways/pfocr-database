caption: LPS directly promoted the TLR4 activation, triggering its inflammatory pathways.
  BPIS treatment promoted the ROS accumulation, and led to the increase of miR-149
  expression. Further, miR-149 directly targeted the 3′-UTR of Akt to block NF-kB
  nuclear translocation, and then attenuated expression of pro-inflammatory factors
  (IL-1β, IL-8 and IL-6) in LPS-induced HT-29 cells.
