caption: Schematic representation of the TGF-β/BAMBI pathway. (A) In the presence
  of TGF-β1, TCR-activated CD4+ T cells express both RORC and FOXP3. Enough Tregs
  keep effector T cells in check since RORC (a Th17‑specific transcription factor)
  activity is antagonized by FOXP3. (B) However, upon inflammatory insult or CSE exposure,
  BAMBI overexpression by the activated immune system in susceptible individuals will
  suppress the generation of TGF-β-induced Tregs and evoke pro‑inflammatory responses
  dominated by Th17 cells. BAMBI, BMP and activin membrane‑bound inhibitor; FOXP3,
  forkhead box P3; TCR, T cell receptor; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; RORC,
  retinoic acid-related orphan receptor C.
