caption: The one‐carbon metabolism pathway. Serine donates a methyl group to THF to
  create 5,10‐MTHF, leaving glycine. This (reversible) reaction is catalyzed by serine
  hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), using vitamin B6 as a cofactor. 5,10‐MTHF is converted
  to 5‐MTHF by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), with vitamin B2 as a cofactor
  and NADPH as electron donor (not depicted). 5‐MTHF, which can also be acquired from
  dietary folate (B9), donates a methyl group to B12 to create CH3•B12, a cofactor
  for the enzyme methionine synthase (MS), which catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine
  to methionine, by in turn transferring this CH3 group. Methionine is combined with
  ATP to become SAM, which maintains methylation reactions. When SAM donates a methyl
  group, it becomes SAH, which can be further hydrolyzed to form homocysteine and
  adenosine (by S‐adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase; SAHH). THF, left after CH3•B12 creation,
  can be converted back into 5,10‐MTHF. 5,10‐MTHF is a carbon donor for the enzyme
  thymidylate synthase (TS), which catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate
  (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP); hence, playing a role in de novo
  DNA synthesis. Upon this reaction, 5,10‐MTFH is converted into dihydrofolate (DHF),
  which can be reduced by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), using NADPH, regenerating
  THF. B‐family vitamins coming from food indicated in red. Based on Friso et al.,
  2017 and Green et al., 2017.[ ,  ]
