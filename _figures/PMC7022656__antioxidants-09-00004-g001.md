caption: Inhibition of Nrf1 N-glycosylation by tunicamycin (TU) in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER)- to-nuclear signaling responses. A topobiological model is herein
  proposed to explain the inhibition of N-glycosylation of Nrf1 by TU, serving as
  a classic ER stressor, which can also block the ensuing deglycosylation and proteolytic
  processing of this cap’n’collar (CNC)-basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) protein
  to yield a mature transcription factor. The resulting non-glycosylated Nrf1 and
  others are subjected to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway mediated by
  proteasomes. To the contrary, the non-glycosylated and unfolded proteins are accumulated
  insomuch as to stimulate ER stress. Thereby, inhibition of Nrf1 by TU is accompanied
  by the activation of a canonic ER-to-nuclear response signaling mediated by PERK,
  IRE1 and ATF6, three key transducers tethered to ER membranes as reviewed by the
  authors [,,,]. Of note, PERK was identified as a direct upstream kinase of Nrf2,
  as well as elF2α [], but Nrf2 is neither translocated nor N-glycosylated in the
  lumen of ER. As such, Nrf2 is generally accepted as a master transcription factor
  to regulate cognate genes driven by antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter
  regions. In such responses, ATF4 is selectively translated by the elF2α-controlled
  initiation machinery to regulate target genes (including Chop, Ero1, Gadd34) containing
  amino acid response elements (AARE) in their promoters. To get rid of ER stress,
  ATF6 is activated by its consecutive proteolytic processing by Site-1 and Site-2
  proteases (i.e., S1P and S2P, respectively) in the Golgi apparatus. The full-length
  mRNA of XBP is alternatively spliced to remove its 26 nucleotides at the nearly
  3′-end, such that the subsequent portion of its open reading frame is shifted so
  much as to yield another inducible protein isoform, called XBP-1s, that is longer
  in size than its original protein of XBP-1u. Consequently, distinct subsets of cognate
  genes containing cis-regulatory ESRE (ER stress response element) or UPRE (unfolded
  protein response element) are regulated transcriptionally by ATF6n (i.e., its active
  N-terminal portion) and XBP-1s, respectively. In addition, a putative micropeptide
  Nrf1u is likely generated by a translation of the upstream open reading frame existing
  in the full-length mRNA transcript of this CNC-bZIP factor, particularly under ER
  stress conditions. Certainly activated or blocked nodes in the some cascades are
  denoted by arrows (→) or bars (⊥), respectively. Scissors represent putative protein
  processing
