caption: 'Development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis and its molecular
  regulation at different stages. AM symbiosis facilitates mutual nutritional benefits:
  the plant provides carbon (C) to AM fungi in form of carbohydrates and fatty acids,
  while AM fungi provide minerals, mainly inorganic phosphate (Pi) and nitrogen to
  the plant. The availability of the different nutrients is a key factor determining
  the establishment and development of the interaction. AM symbiosis alters plant
  hormonal homeostasis, and phytohormones play a key regulatory role in the establishment
  and functioning of the AM symbiosis at different levels: regulating physiology and
  growth, as well as defense and stress adaptation in AM plants, and participating
  in the formation and turnover of AM structures. At initial stages (a), Strigolactones
  (SLs), secreted from host roots under Pi starvation, induce fungal spore germination
  and hyphal branching, facilitating the contact of the fungal hypha with the root
  and the formation of the hyphopodium. In response to AM perception, a complex of
  D14L receptor with a yet unknown D14L ligand is proposed to promote the degradation
  of SMAX1 and the downstream activation of target genes, including symbiosis-related
  and SL synthesis genes necessary for the accommodation of AM fungi in host cells.
  AM-released chitinaceous molecules (Myc-LCOs) are proposed to be detected by specific
  Lys-RLKs with the formation of a receptor complex that leads to the induction of
  the common symbiosis signaling pathway (CSSP)-dependent symbiosis responses, including
  transcriptional regulation of AM symbiosis-related genes, which promotes the successful
  colonization of host root cells by AM fungi. A number of CSSP-activated nuclear
  transcription factors including CCaMK and CYCLOPS form complexes with a large number
  of GRAS domain-containing transcription factors, including DELLA, MIG1 and SCL3
  that enable the downstream activation of symbiotic genes that facilitate the morphological
  accommodation of the root cell hosting the fungus, and possibility arbuscule development
  through the activation of RAM1 (b). Arbuscule functionality, maintenance and turnover
  (c) are also dependent on a number of nuclear transcription factors such as PHR,
  RAM1, DELLA, MYB1 and WRI5A/B that regulate transcriptional programs related to
  biosynthesis and the transport of nutrients, and biosynthesis of apocarotenoids
  compounds with regulatory roles. PHRs integrate phosphate starvation signaling,
  regulating mechanisms for both direct uptake of soil phosphate and AM symbiosis.
  DELLA and MYB1 regulate arbuscule degradation through activation of genes involved
  in hydrolysis processes. Receptor Kinase-2 from the subfamily of land plant-specific
  receptor-like kinases (rice ARK1, ARK2 and SPARK1), has been characterized as having
  a role in the post-arbuscule formation required for sustaining root colonization.
  After fungal colonization, root-derived CLE peptides (MtCLE53 and MtCLE33 in Medicago)
  have been proposed as activating signals that trigger a mycorrhizal autoregulation
  response (AOM) in shoots. The participation of CLV1-like receptors such as SUNN
  and the hydroxyproline O-arabinosyltransferase RDN1 required for post-translational
  CLE peptide modification in the AOM signaling process has been proposed.'
