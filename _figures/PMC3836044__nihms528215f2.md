caption: Signaling pathways interface with Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Akt and p38α can
  both activate the canonical pathway by inhibiting GSK3β activity, preventing it
  from phosphorylating β-catenin. Akt phosphorylates GSK3β at the N terminus on Ser9,
  while P38α phosphorylates the C-terminal residue Ser839. Conversely, activation
  of the non-canonical Wnt/JNK pathway has been observed to inhibit nuclear accumulation
  of β-catenin under some circumstances. Release of calcium from intracellular stores,
  such as occurs when the Wnt/Ca2+pathway is activated, can lead to activation of
  nemo-like kinase (NLK), which directly phosphorylates TCF to inhibit interaction
  with β-catenin. Induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) via the
  Wnt/Ca2+pathway has also been observed to promote GSK3β-independent degradation
  of β-catenin, but the mechanism is poorly understood. MKKK mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase, MKK MAPK kinase, PI3K phosphoinositide-3-kinase, PLC
