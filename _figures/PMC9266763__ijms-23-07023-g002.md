caption: 'Cell death signaling mechanism by DNA virus infection: Mechanisms responsible
  for apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, caused by RNA viral infections. Intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway mediates its signaling through NADPH oxidase (nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate oxidase), reactive oxygen species (ROS), caspases-3/8/9,
  Bcl-2-family protein truncated BID (tBID) promotes mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization (MOMP) in apoptosis. In pyroptosis, inflammasome complex contains
  NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  containing a CARD (ASC), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 18 (IL-18), gasdermin
  family (GSDMD). In necroptosis, inflammatory cytokines activate their signal through
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF), tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), TNFR-1 associated
  death domain protein (TRADD), TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase 3 (RIPK3), phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like (p-MLKL), high
  mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPS), pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS), hepatitis
  C virus (HCV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1),
  polyoma virus.'
