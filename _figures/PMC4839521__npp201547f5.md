caption: Septal GLP-1R regulates motivated behavior. GLP-1R-expressing GABAergic septal
  neurons modulate cellular activity following stimulation. GLP-1Rs are present in
  both somata and terminals of these neurons (; ) that form inhibitory synapses with
  GABAergic interneurons in the VTA (). Their inhibition, in turn, leads to activation
  of dopaminergic VTA neurons via disinhibition. Hence, this dLS–VTA pathway controls
  drug-induced behaviors such as locomotor sensitization and drug seeking. DA, dopamine.
