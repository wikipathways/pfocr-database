caption: The mechanism of Trp in alleviating MS. Trp altered the composition of the
  gut microbiota and reduced the abundance of BSH-producing bacteria in mice, leading
  to a decrease in bacterial deconjugation capacity and consequently an increase in
  the total amount of conjugated BAs. The accumulation of conjugated BAs directly
  inhibits FXR–FGF15 signaling. Reduced FGF15/19 acts on FGFR4 via the hepatic portal
  vein, which led to up-regulation of hepatic BA synthase CYP7A1, CYP7B1, and CYP27A1
  expression and increased hepatic synthesis of BAs from scratch. The classical pathway
  of BA synthesis is initiated by CYP7A1 and results in the production of CA and CDCA
  through the subsequent action of CYP8B1 and CYP27A1. The alternative pathway of
  BA synthesis is initiated by CYP27A1 and produces CDCA via CYP7B1. In the rodent
  liver, the majority of CDCA is converted to MCA. In the pig liver, CDCA is primarily
  converted to HCA. Elevated ratio of non-12-OH to 12-OH BAs in both pigs and mice,
  increased MCA species in mice, and increased HCA species in pigs indicated the importance
  of the BA alternative pathway. Hepatic TC consumption increased and lipid metabolism
  improved as a result of increased BA levels. The altered BA levels and composition,
  in turn, affect the composition of the microbiota, with crosstalk between gut microbiota
  and BA regulating metabolism. The red color in the picture represents up-regulation.
  The green color in the picture represents downregulation or inhibition
