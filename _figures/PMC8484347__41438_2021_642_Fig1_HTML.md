caption: Medium- to long-chain fatty acids undergo hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome
  P450-enzymes CYP703A2 and CYP704B1, and are then esterified to CoA thioesters by
  the fatty acyl-CoA synthetase ACOS5. The generated hydroxyl fatty acyl-CoA esters
  are subsequently condensed with malonyl-CoA by the chalcone synthase-like polyketide
  synthases PKSA and PKSB to yield tetraketide α-pyrones, which are further reduced
  by tetraketide α-pyrone reductases TKPR1 and TKPR2. The resulting polyhydroxylated
  tetraketide compounds then function as building blocks for sporopollenin
