caption: 'Cholesterol synthesis pathway and human malformation syndromes. The sterol
  ring structure and carbon position numbering are shown at the top of the figure.
  Human malformation syndromes are in boldface type. Cholesterol is synthesized from
  squalene in a series of enzymatic reactions denoted by numbers: 1, squalene monooxygenase
  and squalene cyclase; 2, lanosterol 14-α-demethylase; 3, 3β-hydroxysterol Δ14-reductase;
  4, C4 demethylation complex (C4-sterol methyloxidase, C4-sterol decarboxylase [NSDHL],
  and 3-ketoreductase); 5, 3β-hydroxysterol Δ8,Δ7-isomerase; 6, lathosterol 5-desaturase;
  7, 3β-hydroxysterol Δ7-reduct-ase; 8, 3β-hydroxysterol Δ24-reductase.'
