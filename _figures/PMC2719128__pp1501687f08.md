caption: Diagram showing the responses of Arabidopsis to microbial siderophores. Leaf
  infiltration of iron-free siderophores (CB or DFO) activates the SA-mediated signaling
  pathway leading to PR1 up-regulation, the basal defense marker PAD4, ferritin accumulation
  via AtFER1, and root iron uptake via IRT1 and FRO2. Up-regulation of IRT1 and FRO2
  appeared to be partially repressed by SA. Activation of the SA pathway and AtFER1
  up-regulation depends on iron availability to the plant (indicated with dashed arrows).
  Further details are discussed in the text.
