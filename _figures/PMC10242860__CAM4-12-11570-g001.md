caption: Ferritin for immune activation. Ferritin can target delivery of antigens,
  nucleic acids, and adenosine monophosphate analogs to enhance immune efficacy to
  ameliorate the above limitations of immune activators. The N‐terminal region of
  the heavy‐chain subunit a‐helix is directly involved in HFn binding to TfR1, which
  can mature DC to trigger T cell responses through hyper‐activation of NF‐κB signaling
  pathway. The interaction of CpG with TLR9 in DC can activate the NF‐κB pathway.
  This enables DC to release pro‐inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF‐α and IL‐1β,
  and triggers DC maturation to enhance their antigen‐presenting capacity. Upon activation,
  STING recruits and activates tank‐binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which phosphorylates
  the transcription factor IRF3 to induce increased secretion of type I interferons.
  Type I interferons can activate DC to promote the priming of cytotoxic T cells.
  In addition, the activation of the STING pathway also leads to the production of
  inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF‐α) through the NF‐κB pathway.
