caption: Mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in NMO. The autoimmune reaction in
  NMO arises in the secondary immune organs as a result of a failure of immune tolerance,
  pro-inflammatory antigen presentation, and emergence of anti-AQP4 antibody and Th17
  cells. The inflammatory reaction evolves in a cascade-like fashion and utilizes
  several points of augmentation, diversification and integration. Monoclonal antibody
  therapies target B-lineage cells (anti-CD19, anti-CD20) and the humoral effector
  molecules/receptors (anti-complement 5, anti-IL-6 receptor) mediating the principal
  pathway of the disease pathogenesis. Conventional immunosuppressants are non-specific
  and exert broader cytotoxic effects on the immune cells. APC, antigen presenting
  cells; Ab, antibody; B, B cell; C5, component 5 of complement; CX, cytotoxic agent;
  IL, interleukin; IS, immunosuppressant; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin; PL, plasma
  cell; PMN, polymorphonuclear cell; Th0, T helper 0 cell; Th1, T helper 1 cell; Th17,
  T helper 17 cell; Treg, T regulatory cell.
