caption: PRR regulation in carcinogenesis. The functional pleiotropy of PRRs in carcinogenesis
  is likely governed by cell type, the nature of the upstream activating ligand, the
  composition of multisubunit receptor complexes, downstream signaling pathways, disease
  stage, and tissue type. PRR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines play dual roles in
  tumor immunity, including antitumor immunity to inhibit tumor growth and immune
  evasion to promote tumor growth. For example, NLRP6 regulates the secretion of IL-18
  and antimicrobial peptides in enterocytes, as well as mucin production in goblet
  cells, which contributes to its ability to prevent the invasion of pathobionts that
  initiate colitis-associated colorectal cancer, thereby inhibiting tumor growth.
  The functional cytokine introduce by cGAS–STING pathway activates the production
  of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to an immunosuppressive TME. This
