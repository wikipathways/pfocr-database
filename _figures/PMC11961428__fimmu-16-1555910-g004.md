caption: The proposed inflammatory mechanisms hypothesized to underlie HACE. (A) HH
  triggers the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Hypoxia-induced NF-κB activation.
  Hypoxia triggers the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Hypoxia-induced
  NF-κB activation can upregulate AQP4 expression, trigger the release of inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, increase p62
  expression to inhibit caspase-1 activation, and increase HIF-1α levels, which subsequently
  further activate NF-κB. (B) HACE is mediated by microglia in a hypoxic environment
  at high altitude. Hypoxia triggers the activation of microglia, which can exhibit
  distinct yet overlapping phenotypes. Specifically, the M1 phenotype is characterized
  by the release of proinflammatory mediators, whereas the M2 phenotype is associated
  with the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors. Hypoxia can promote M1 polarization
  of microglia by upregulating the expression of Nrf1, releasing many proinflammatory
  factors to activate the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in astrocytes, upregulating
  the expression of AQP4, destroying the integrity of the BBB, and inducing HACE
