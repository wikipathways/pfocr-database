caption: 'Crosstalk between endothelial cells and pericytes during sprouting angiogenesis:
  The formation of newly endothelial tubules from pre-existent vessels begins with
  aberrations in endocytes (ECs)-pericytes (PCs) signaling networks, which induce
  PCs-ECs dissociation and degradation of basement membrane by mean of proteolytic
  activities to allow cell migration and for creating space in the matrix. New vessel
  maturation is characterized by pericyte recruitment, functional pericyte investment
  of the endothelium, and assembly of ECM components. In this context, PC release
  pro-angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), acid
  and basic fibroblast growth factor (βFGF and βFGF), transforming growth factor-β1
  (TGFβ1), hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1 and HIF-2) and mast cell-derived metalloproteinases
  (MMP), leading to degradation of the basement membrane, vasodilatation, increased
  vessel permeability and endothelial tube formation. The recruitment of pericytes,
  surrounding immature sprouting vessels with consequently pericyte coverage, is mediated
  principally by the release of TGFβ and platelet-derived growth factor β (PDGFβ)
  by ECs, which activates the corresponding receptor on pericytes. Conversely to ECs,
  tumor cell derived PDGFβ may induce the promotion of the pericyte to fibroblast
  activated cells (CAF) transition, inducing tumor invasion and metastasis through
  paracrine TGFβ signaling and mechanical pressure. It has also been showed that the
  angiopoietin (Ang1 and Ang2) signaling pathway may be crucial in the PCs-ECs crosstalk.
  Ang1 is secreted by periendothelial cells (pericytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle
  cells, macrophages) and induces vessel stabilization and pericyte coverage, while
  Ang2 is principally secreted by activated ECs and promotes pericytes detachment
  inducing ECs, sprouting and tumor cell intravasation.'
