caption: An immunometabolic circuit that dictates macrophage fate and function in
  tuberculosis. M1 macrophages that restrict Mtb proliferation are generally glycolytically
  active and utilize more glucose to meet increased energy demand as a result of enhanced
  proliferation. M1 macrophages skip the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and prefer
  energetically favored lactate production from pyruvate even in the absence of oxygen
  (Warburg effect) to which support rapid cellular turnover and generation of anti-mycobacterial
  oxidative burst. Instead of the TCA cycle, they utilize the pentose phosphate pathway
  and citric acid cycle for extra-mitochondrial utilization of available fatty acids
  to meet increased energy demands to support activation of pro-inflammatory genes
  including NF-κβ, IRF-3/5, STAT-1, and HIF-1α and their downstream effectors such
  as TNF-α, IL-12, IFN-β/γ, CCL-5, and CXCL-4/9/10/11 to restrict Mtb growth. In stark
  contrast, both AMs and M2 macrophages that support Mtb persistence/proliferation
  elect cost-inefficient mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty
  acid oxidation (FAO) pathways to meet cellular demands. Mtb exploit these pathways
  to hijack host cells and utilizes the host’s own lipids to thrive in hibernation
  for longer periods. In M2 macrophages, it induces the cellular expression of anti-inflammatory
  mediators including STAT-3/6, C-Maf, and HIF-2α that stimulate the production of
  downstream anti-inflammatory effectors including IL-10, IL-1Rα, IL-4Rα, Arg-1/2,
  and PPAR-γ among others and thus make a permissive environment for Mtb growth as
  well persistence.
