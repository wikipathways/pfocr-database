caption: As shown in the top panel, under unstressed conditions the major synaptic
  pathways to cardiac vagal neurons include an excitatory (denoted as +) glutamatergic
  pathway from the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius (NTS), likely essential for the baroreceptor
  reflex, and inspiratory-evoked inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic neurotransmission
  that likely mediates respiratory sinus arrhythmia. The increase in GABAergic, but
  not glycinergic activity during inspiratory activity is mediated by presynaptic
  β2 containing nicotinic receptors (nAChR). In response to hypoxia there is a biphasic
  change in GABAergic and glycinergic neurotransmission to cardiac vagal neurons with
  an initial increase, (illustrated by bolder lines) followed by a depression (illustrated
  by dashed lines) of inhibitory input. Hypoxia also recruits a serotonergic pathway
  that activates postsynaptic 5-HT3 receptors in cardiac vagal neurons, this serotonergic
  pathway is spontaneously active but not inspiratory related. In the recovery from
  hypoxia the depression (dashed lines) of inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic inputs
  persist. In addition, inspiratory-evoked excitatory pathways are recruited that
  are both glutamatergic and purinergic.After exposure to prenatal nicotine many of
  the activated receptors and synaptic pathways to cardiac vagal neurons are altered,
  as shown in the bottom panel. Prenatal nicotine exposure potentiates the GABAergic,
  but not glycinergic neurotransmission to cardiac vagal neurons (as illustrated by
  bolder lines). In contrast to unexposed animals in which hypoxia evokes a biphasic
  change in the frequency of inhibitory neurotransmission, prenatal nicotine exposure
  transforms this response to hypoxia from biphasic to a precipitous decrease in spontaneous
  GABAergic activity (dashed lines). An inspiratory related glutamatergic excitation
  is recruited during hypoxia and hypoxia/hypercapnia in prenatal nicotine exposed
  animals which is dependent upon activation of presynaptic α3β4 nicotinic receptors
  (bold lines), that is not present in unexposed animals. This long lasting inspiratory
  related excitation persists throughout recovery from hypoxia/hypercapnia in prenatal
  nicotine exposed animals and it is dependent upon activation of both glutamatergic
  and purinergic receptors. Thus, following hypoxia, prenatal nicotine exposure exaggerates
  the activity in cardiac vagal neurons as excitatory glutamatergic and purinergic
  pathways are facilitated while inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic neurotransmission
  is diminished.
