caption: 'Folates provide a backbone for the transfer of one-carbon units. Key outputs
  (in green) include nucleotide biosynthesis and methylation. Among methylation cycle
  intermediates, homocysteine may also be converted to cystathionine in the transulfuration
  pathway and S-adenosylmethionine is involved in polyamine biosynthesis. FOCM is
  compartmentalised: one-carbon units from the mitochondria enter cytoplasmic FOCM
  as formate while reactions of thymidylate biosynthesis also operate in the nucleus
  (catalysed by SHMT1, TYMS and DHFR). In loss-of-function mouse models, NTDs arise
  in mutants for Mthfd1l and genes encoding the glycine cleavage system (GCS). Shmt1
  and Mthfr null mice are viable to birth but may develop NTDs under folate-deficient
  conditions.'
