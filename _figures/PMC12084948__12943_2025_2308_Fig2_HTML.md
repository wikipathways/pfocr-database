caption: 'Roles of signaling networks downstream of SLAMF receptors in regulating
  immune cells. The homophilic interaction of SLAMF receptors between immune cells
  and target cells will trigger a cascade of downstream protein activation. Most signaling
  transmitted by SLAMF receptors needs the involvement of the SAP adaptor family having
  an SH2 domain, like SAP, EAT-2, and ERT. In contrast, some SLAMF receptors transmit
  signals in the SAP adaptors-independent manner but recruit inhibitory phosphatases
  containing the SH2 domain, such as SHIP, SHP-1, and SHP-2. Finally, these signaling
  pathways downstream of SLAMF receptors play different roles in regulating immune
  cells. However, the specific mechanisms of some roles are still unclear. The graph
  on the left shows the SAP-dependent signaling pathway of SLAMF receptors and their
  corresponding roles. The graph in the middle shows the SAP adaptors-independent
  signaling networks and their roles in regulating immune cells. The graph on the
  right shows the EAT-2-dependent signaling pathway of SLAMF receptors and their corresponding
  roles. Abbreviation: SAP, SLAMF-associated protein; EAT-2, Ewing’s sarcoma-associated
  transcript-2; ERT, EAT-2 related transducer; Th2, T helper 2; PKCθ, protein kinase
  C-theta; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; IFN-γ, interferon γ; Ca, calcium; c-CBL,
