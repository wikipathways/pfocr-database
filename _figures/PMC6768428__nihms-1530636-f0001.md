caption: The STING signaling pathway. Cytosolic DNA is primarily sensed by cyclic-GMP-AMP
  synthase (cGAS), which generates cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) from guanosine triphosphate
  (GTP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). cGAMP functions as a second messenger that
  binds to and activates STING, resulting in its trafficking from the ER to the Golgi
  and on to perinuclear endosomes where it mediates subsequent signaling via phosphorylation
  of tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), IRF3, and NF-κB, which induce transcription of
  type I IFNs and other inflammatory genes. DDX41, ZBP1, DNA-PK, and IFI16 can also
  act as sensors of cytosolic DNA with similar downsream effects on STING.
