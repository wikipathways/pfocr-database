caption: Targeting to the Sec and Tat pathways. (a) The Sec pathway transports unfolded
  proteins. During co‐translational targeting to Sec, the signal sequence is recognised
  at the translating ribosome by ribosome‐bound signal recognition particle (SRP)
  and the nascent chain is guided via the SRP receptor to the Sec translocon, where
  the energy of protein synthesis is harnessed to drive protein transport. In the
  post‐translational pathway, the substrate is maintained in an unfolded conformation
  and guided to the Sec translocon by the ATPase, SecA. ATP hydrolysis by SecA provides
  the driving force for Sec‐dependent post‐translational protein export (Collinson
  et al., ; Lycklama a Nijeholt & Driessen, ; Rapoport, Li, & Park, ; Tsirigotaki
  et al., ). The Tat pathway transports folded proteins without the requirement for
  targeting factors. (b) Signal peptides that target to Sec and Tat pathways share
  a similar tripartite organisation with a positively charged n‐region, hydrophobic
  h‐region and polar c‐region containing a signal peptidase cleavage site (AxA). Tat
  signal peptides have an almost invariant pair of arginines that are embedded within
  a SRRxFLK motif (Berks, ). A helix destabilising residue (#), often a glycine, serine
  or proline towards the C‐terminal end of the h‐region, provides flexibility at this
  region of the signal peptide (Hamsanathan et al., ). A basic residue (+) is frequently
  found in the Tat signal peptide c‐region and serves as a Sec avoidance motif (Bogsch
  et al., ). The arrow indicates the position of signal peptide cleavage. Amino acid
  sequences of two E. coli Sec signal peptides, OmpA (post‐translational Sec targeting;
  Fekkes et al., ) and DsbA (co‐translational targeting; Schierle et al., )—basic
  residues in the n‐region and the signal peptidase cleavage site in the c‐region
  are underlined and shown in bold. Two well‐studied E. coli Tat signal peptides,
  SufI and TorA, are also shown. Residues that match the twin‐arginine consensus are
  in red, the Sec avoidance signal in bold typeface and the signal peptidase cleavage
  site in underline
