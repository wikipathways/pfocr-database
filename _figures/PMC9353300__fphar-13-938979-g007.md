caption: (A)The enhanced microglia proliferation in the spinal cord and the infiltration
  of macrophages into the DRG and paw tissue of the CFA mice contribute to the development
  of inflammatory pain. (B) DI regulated and inhibited the imbalance between pro-inflammatory
  and anti-inflammatory responses. (C) DI suppressed the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome
  complexes and NF-κB, thereby inhibiting the secretion of IL-1β.
