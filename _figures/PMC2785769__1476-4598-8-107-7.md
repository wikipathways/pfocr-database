caption: 'Proposed pathways for promotion (A) and progression genes (B) influenced
  by TLR4. A. Promotion genes primarily signal through or are involved in EGFR signaling
  which may lead to cell growth and eventual tumor development. Thus, the EGFR pathway
  may drive the proliferative response in mice deficient in Tlr4 and concurrently
  inhibit communication between cells (Gja1), thus providing a growth advantage. References
  for gene interactions not described in text: Ran, []; Myc, []; Hmag1, []; Tnc, [];
  Mina, [], Timp2 []. Symbols: red, genes increased in BALBLps-d mice 1 day Protocol
  1; blue, genes decreased in BALBLps-d mice 1 day Protocol; green, genes increased
  in BALB mice 1 day Protocol 1. B. During progression, the combination of inflammation
  observed in BALBLps-d mice in concert with up-regulation of these and other immune
  response genes, the many inflammation and immune response genes that were down regulated
  in BALB mice, and the additional contribution of cell growth genes (e.g. SPP1; [],
  MCP-1; [], supports a role of TLR4 in protection against lung tumor progression.
  Symbols: red, genes increased in BALBLps-dtumors; blue, genes decreased in BALB
  tumors; green, genes increased in BALB tumors; grey, protein changes in uninvolved
  tissue from the BALBLps-d mice. *Also decreased in BALB uninvolved tissue; **Also
  increased in BALBLps-d uninvolved tissue. Abbreviations: Ccr2, chemokine (C-C motif)
  receptor 1; Chst1, carbohydrate sulfotransferase 1, Cxcl2, chemokine (C-X-C motif)
  ligand 2; Enpp2, ectonucleotide phosphodiesterase 2; Il1rn, interleukin 1 receptor
  antagonist; S100a8, S100 calcium binding protein A8; Timp2, tissue inhibitor of
  metalloproteinases; Utrn, utrophin.'
