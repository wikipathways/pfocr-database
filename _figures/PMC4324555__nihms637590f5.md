caption: Opposing effects of glucagon and insulin on the cyclic AMP-responsive element
  (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) pathway. a | Glucagon stimulates the protein kinase
  A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133. PKA also stimulates cAMP-regulated
  transcriptional co-activator 2 (CRTC2) activity via the phosphorylation and inhibition
  of salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2), leading to the dephosphorylation of CRTC2. Dephosphorylated
  CRTC2 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to CREB and promotes the recruitment
  of TBP-associated factor 4 (TAF4) and CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralogue
  p300. Nuclear CRTC2 is transiently stabilized by CBP/p300-mediated acetylation (Ac)
  at Lys628. b | Insulin signalling stimulates AKT, which phosphorylates and activates
  SIK2. Active SIK2 disrupts the CRTC2–CBP/p300 interaction by phosphorylating CBP/p300
  at Ser89, leading to the deacetylation and ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent degradation
  of CRTC2. SIK2 also promotes the cytoplasmic translocation of CRTC2 through phosphorylation
  at Ser171.
