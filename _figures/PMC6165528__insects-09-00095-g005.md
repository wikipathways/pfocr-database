caption: PIWI pathway in mosquitoes. Upon RNA virus infection, as the RNA strand reaches
  the cytoplasm of the host, it is either utilized by PIWI protein or the viral genome
  integrates into the host genome after reverse transcription, replication, and integration.
  In the first category, as viral RNA genome enters the host cells, it is bound with
  unknown PIWI protein (PIWI 1-7) and is directly fed into the ping-pong cycle, thereby
  amplifying the piRNAs. RNA from viral genome or mRNA binds to complementary antisense
  RNA bound to Piwi5. Viral RNA or mRNA is cleaved at 5′ end and trimmed at 3′ end
  by nucleases and methylated at 2′-OH. Antisense RNA is then released bounded to
  an unknown PIWI protein and binds to viral RNA inhibiting viral replication, whereas
  processed sense RNA binds to Ago3 and to precursor long-length antisense piRNA.
  Antisense precursor is then cleaved at 5′ end and 3′ end by nucleases and methylated
  at 2′-OH. The sense piRNA is released although its function is not known, whereas
  antisense piRNA binds to Piwi5 and starts another round of ping-pong cycle. In the
  second category, the viral RNA genome is reverse transcribed and replicated, which
  then enters into the host cell nucleus and then integrates into the genome. It is
  later transcribed and transported to the cytoplasm, and fed into ping-pong cycle,
  although it is not known whether it directly binds to complementary RNA bound to
  Ago3 or there is a role of Yb body as in the case of germinal cells.
