caption: The main PRRs involved in immunity to Candida. Cell surface TLR2, TLR4, and
  TLR6 sense mannans and intracellular TLR9 sense DNA, and they all signal to IRAKs
  through MYD88. Then, the phosphorylation of IRAK4/IRAK1/TRAF6 activates the NF-κB
  pathway. Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN also activate NF-κB signaling via the RAS-RAF-1 pathway.
  Moreover, the dectin-1 homodimer, the dectin-2 and dectin-3 heterodimers, and Mincle
  recruit Syk in a FcγR-dependent manner to form a CARD9/BCL-10/MALT1 scaffold, which
  activates NF-κB in a classical way. In addition, dectin-1 mediates the formation
  of the CARD9/BCL-10/MALT1 complex to promote IL-1β secretion via the non-classical
  caspase-8 pathway. In response to TLR4, the MAPK/c-Fos pathway is also activated
  by MYD88, while the transcription of IFN-α/β is promoted by TRIF-mediated IRF3.
