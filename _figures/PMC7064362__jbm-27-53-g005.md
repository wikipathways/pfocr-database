caption: . Schematic diagram of the effect of Rosae Multiflorae fructus extract (RMF-E)
  on receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis.
  The RANKL/RANK interaction may lead to mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
  activation, followed by induction of c-Fos expression, and it also leads to Bruton's
  tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCγ2) activation inducing calcium
  signaling, followed by induction of nuclear factor-activated T cells c1 (NFATc1)
  expression and activation. RMF-E may inhibit NFATc1 induction via suppression of
  c-Fos and modulation of the BTK/PLCγ signaling pathways regulating Ca2+ signaling,
  resulting in the inhibition of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. The red line indicates
  the inhibition pathway of RMF-E. TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated
  factor 6; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif.
