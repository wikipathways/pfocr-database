caption: Graphic scheme of the genes involved in the adsorption, distribution, metabolism
  and excretion (ADME) of fluoropyrimidines []. Capecitabine passes through the gut
  wall and is metabolised into 5-deoxyfluorocytidine (5′dFCR) and 5’-deoxy-5-fluorouridine
  (5′dFUR) by carboxyl esterases (CES) and cytidine deaminase (CDA), respectively,
  and activated into 5-FU by thymidine phosphorylase (TP). - 5-FU is metabolised mostly
  in the liver by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) (<80%) into dihydrofluorouracil
  (DHFU). The secondary elimination pathway is through urinary excretion or catabolism
  in extrahepatic tissues []. Its mechanism of action involves the methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR)—converting 5,10-methylentetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) into 5-MTHF,
  which is required for purine and thymidine synthesis, and thymidylate synthase (TS)
  enzymes—forming a complex with 5,10-MTHF and deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP),
  which in the end disrupts DNA replication and repair. Used with PharmGKB and Stanford
