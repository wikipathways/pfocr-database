caption: Schematic overview of the canonical Notch signaling pathway. The Notch receptors
  are produced as large proteins that are cleaved (S1) and inserted in the membrane
  as heterodimers. Upon ligand binding, two consecutive cleavages occur (S2 and S3),
  which release the ICN. In the nucleus, ICN forms a multimeric protein complex together
  with CSL and co-activators, and initiates transcription of target genes. See text
  for further details.
