caption: The network described in this work is indicated by black lines, while regulatory
  relationships described previously are indicated by gray lines. Solid lines indicate
  genetically determined steps and dashed lines represent hypothesized steps. (A)
  Activation of GNA3 results in increased cAMP levels, which regulates the PKAC1 to
  control vegetative growth . Morphogenesis is also regulated by GTPases TrRas1 and
  TrRas2, which probably act through cAMP-PKAC1 pathway and MAP kinase pathway to
  regulate filamentation, vegetative growth and sporulation. TrRas1 and TrRas2 possess
  similar roles in controlling these cellular processes. (B) In the presence of cellulose,
  TrRas2 senses extracellular signals (e.g., light) and acts through an unidentified
  pathway to modulate the transcript abundance of transcriptional regulators Xyr1,
  Ace1 and Cre1, which directly or indirectly regulate the cellulase gene expression.
  TrRas2 positively influences the transcription of xyr1 and cre1 but negatively influences
  ace1 expression. Xyr1 (activator) and Ace1 (repressor) subsequently regulate cellulase
  genes (cbh1 and cbh2) expression. Meanwhile, Ace1 negatively influences the xyr1
  expression , while Cre1 has a positive effect on the transcription of xyr1 . In
  addition, Xyr1 may also be repressed by an unknown element in the presence of glucose;
  while under cellulose-inducing conditions, the repressor departs from Xyr1 thus
  making this activator being unrepressing status.
