caption: Molecular and cellular mechanisms of immunogenic cell death. Cancer cells
  succumb to specific stimuli (e.g., anthracyclines, oxaliplatin, some forms of radiation
  therapy, photodynamic therapy) while emitting a spatiotemporally ordered combination
  of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These signals include (but are
  not limited to) the pre-apoptotic exposure of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone
  calreticulin (CALR) on the surface of dying cells, the secretion of ATP during the
  blebbing phase of apoptosis, and the release of the nuclear protein high mobility
  group box 1 (HMGB1) upon plasma membrane permeabilization. Upon binding to specific
  receptors, immunogenic cell death (ICD)-associated DAMPs promote the recruitment
  of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and stimulate their ability to take up particulate
  material and cross-present dead cell-associated antigens to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes
  (CTLs) while secreting interleukin (IL)-1β. The consequent adaptive immune response
  also involves γδ T lymphocytes that produce IL-17. Both γδ T cells and αβ CTLs mediate
  direct antineoplastic effects by secreting interferon γ (IFNγ) and via the granzyme-perforin
  pathway. In addition, some CTLs acquire a memory phenotype, underlying the establishment
  of long-term immunological protection.
