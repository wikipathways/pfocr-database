caption: Hypothetical model illustrating the relationship between the Jun kinase pathway
  and c-Jun expression and apoptosis in sympathetic neurons. After NGF withdrawal,
  Jun kinase activity, c-Jun levels, and c-Jun phosphorylation increase. Expression
  of c-Jun protein and apoptosis are blocked by the c-Jun dominant negative mutant
  FLAGΔ169, which inhibits AP-1 activity. NGF withdrawal-induced death is also blocked
  by injection of antibodies against c-Jun but not Jun B or Jun D (). These results
  suggest that c-Jun activates target genes that promote apoptosis, as well as the
  c-jun gene itself. In other systems, JNK/SAPKs are activated by SEK1, which in turn
  is activated by MEKK1. Overexpression of MEKK1 in sympathetic neurons increases
  the level of c-Jun protein and induces apoptotic cell death, suggesting that activation
  of the Jun kinase pathway is sufficient to trigger apoptosis. The induction of c-Jun
  expression and apoptosis by MEKK1 is blocked by co-expression of the SEK1 dominant
  negative mutant SEKAL. However, expression of SEKAL does not block the expression
  of c-Jun induced by NGF withdrawal or NGF withdrawal-induced death. This might be
  because NGF withdrawal activates a JNKKK and JNKK that cannot be inhibited by SEKAL
  (a pathway parallel to MEKK1 and SEK1 that would activate JNK/SAPKs) or because
  the expression of c-Jun and apoptosis do not require Jun kinase activity and are
  induced by a different signaling pathway that is not affected by SEKAL (? leading
  to the c-jun gene). This would not be the p38 kinase pathway, because p38 is not
  activated in sympathetic neurons after NGF withdrawal.
