caption: Interaction analysis of the differentially expressed proteins and metabolites
  involved in the top 10 enrichment pathways. (A) Distribution of the differentially
  expressed proteins and metabolites involved in the top 10 enrichment pathways. (B)
  The interaction between the differentially expressed proteins and metabolites involved
  in the top 10 enrichment pathways. The diamonds represent metabolites, while the
  circles represent proteins. The size and color of the figures indicate the number
  of interacting molecules with them, with larger and darker figures representing
  more interacting molecules
