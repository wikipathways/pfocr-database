caption: 'Schematic diagram of the multi-scale model of the immune response to Mtb
  infection in the lung. (A) An overview of selected cell- and tissue-level ABM rules
  based on known immunological activities and interactions (Mr, resting macrophage;
  Mi, infected macrophage; Mci, chronically infected macrophage; Ma, activated macrophage;
  Tγ, pro-inflammatory IFN-γ producing T cell; Tc, cytotoxic T cell). Example rules
  are: (I) infection of a resting macrophage after phagocytosis of extracellular Mtb,
  (II) intracellular growth of Mtb within an infected macrophage, (III) cytotoxic
  T cell-mediated killing of an infected macrophage, (IV) activation of a macrophage
  as a result of interaction with IFN-γ producing T cells and TNF, (V) secretion of
  TNF (and chemokines) from an activated macrophage and diffusion in tissue, (VI)
  TNF interactions with a macrophage and induction of feedback mechanisms that control
  TNF-mediated cell responses. For a full description of all ABM rules (see Fallahi-Sichani
  et al., ). (B) An overview of TNF/TNFR binding and trafficking interactions and
  reactions and the NF-κB signal transduction cascade at the level of individual cell.
  TNF/TNFR-associated processes are modeled in both macrophages and T cells. (C) Detailed
  description of the regulation of the TNF-induced NF-κB signaling pathway and NF-κB-mediated
  responses [expression of chemokines (CHEM), TNF, inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP),
  and macrophage-activating molecules (ACT)] for an individual macrophage.'
