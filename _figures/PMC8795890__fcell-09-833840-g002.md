caption: Potential mechanisms of MSC-Exos for treating IDD. (A) Inhibiting NPC apoptosis
  and promoting NPC proliferation. MSC-Exos alleviate NPC apoptosis induced by acidic
  pH through repressing caspase-3 expression and attenuating caspase-3 cleavage. BMSC-Exos
  can increase miR-155 expression to upregulate HO-1 expression and downregulate Bach1
  expression, subsequently activating autophagy in NPCs to inhibit the cell apoptosis
  in the state of low blood supply. MSC-Exos can deliver miR-532-5p, which targets
  RASSF5, and eventually inhibit TNF-α-induced NPC apoptosis. By delivering miR-142-3p
  to target MLK3 in NPCs, MSC-Exos inhibit the activation of the MAPK pathway and
  alleviate IL-1β-induced apoptosis and inflammation in NPCs. MSC-Exos can transfer
  miR-21, which directly targets PTEN; the PTEN silencing actives PI3K/Akt pathway
  and suppresses activation of Bad, Bax, and caspase-3 and inhibits TNF-α-induced
  NPC apoptosis. (B) Inhibiting ECM degradation. BMSC-Exos suppress the levels of
  MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13 in degenerative NPCs to inhibit ECM decomposition metabolism
  and evaluate expression levels of aggrecan, collagen II, SOX9, further inhibiting
  the ECM degradation. (C) Inhibiting inflammation response. MSC-Exos can decrease
  inflammatory factor expression including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, NF-κB-p65 and
  TNF-α in NPCs. MSC-Exos can inactivate the NLRP3 and inhibit the expression of NT-GSDMD,
  IL-18 and IL-1β proteins in degenerative NPCs, therefore inhibiting the NLRP3-mediated
  inflammatory pyroptosis. (D) Inhibiting oxidative stress. MSC-Exos can reduce the
  ROS and MDA level and inhibit oxidative stress-induced NPC apoptosis. MSC-Exos can
  activate Akt/ERK pathway to decrease CHOP protein expression, therefore inhibiting
  the cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-12 to treat AGEs-related ER stress-induced IDD.
  (E) Promoting chondrogenic differentiation. MSC-Exo treatment can induce chondrogenesis
  in degenerative NPCs earlier by increased the aggrecan, collagen II and SOX9 expression.
  (F) Protective effect on endplate chondrocytes. MSC-Exos containing miR-31-5p could
  negatively regulate ER stress by targeting ATF6, and further reducing caspase-3,
  caspase-7 and caspase-9 expression to inhibit apoptosis and calcification of endplate
  chondrocytes. (G) Protective effect on annulus fibrosus of IDD. BMSC-Exos can suppress
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway-mediated autophagy and inhibit the IL-1β-induced
  inflammation and apoptosis in annulus fibrosus cells.
