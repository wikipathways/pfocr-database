caption: 'Gene loci underlying MD (Gray) and/or AMD (Green) conditions were submitted
  to Ingenuity (http://www.ingenuity.com/) and String databases (http://string.embl.de/)
  to define potential functional interacting pathways. The generation of a single
  interactome suggests that the MD/AMD gene loci/gene products considered are functionally
  related. Ingenuity incorporated additional gene loci/proteins (yellow) as part of
  the pathway stemming from the initial input of the disease genes. Direct interactions
  are shown in solid lines (for example, protein to protein binding, phosphorylation,
  etc.); indirect interactions are shown in dashed lines (for example, effects through
  signaling pathways, expression); and undefined interactions are shown as red lines.
