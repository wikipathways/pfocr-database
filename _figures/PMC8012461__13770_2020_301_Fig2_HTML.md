caption: The Mammalian Core Hippo Signaling pathway. A When Hippo pathway is ON, YAP
  and TAZ are cytoplasmic and do not bind to TEAD (DNA binding transcriptional factor).
  Upstream signals from various cell surface receptors such as GPCR, WNT, TAO Kinases,
  tight junction (TJ), adhesion junctions (AJ) or mechanical forces (soft substrate,
  high cell density, small surface area for adhesion etc.) initiates a cascade of
  phosphorylation reactions of core Hippo pathway proteins. These signals and scaffold
  protein SAV1 phosphorylate MST1/2. LATS1/2 is phosphorylated by MST1/2 and MAP4K,
  facilitated by MOB1 and NF2 (also known as Merlin), which subsequently phosphorylates
  YAP/TAZ at various serine residues (refer Fig. ). After phosphorylation by LATS1/2-MOB1,
  YAP/TAZ either binds to 14-3-3 protein resulting in its cytoplasmic retention or
  binds to angiomotin (AMOT), casein kinase 1 isoform epsilon and delta (CSNK1E/D),
  β-transducing repeat-containing protein (BTRC), glycogen synthase kinase 3 Beta
  (GSK3B) or catenin beta (CTNNB) resulting in ubiquitylation and proteasomal-mediated
  degradation. YAP/TAZ cannot shuttle into the nucleus and bind to one of its DNA
  binding transcription factors such as TEAD when Hippo pathway is ON. B When Hippo
  pathway is OFF i.e. in absence of upstream signaling, MST1/2 and LATS1/2 are unphosphorylated
  and inactive. Unphosphorylated YAP/TAZ is active and is free to move into the nucleus,
  bind to transcriptional factors, such as TEAD, TP73, ERBB4, EGR1, TBX5, SMAD, or
  RUNX, and depending upon the binding partner promote specific gene expression
