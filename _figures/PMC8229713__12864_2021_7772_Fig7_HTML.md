caption: The association network between pathways and DEGs. Cycle nodes in the middle
  represents the detected DEGs, size of which corresponds to the number of links.
  Square nodes besides the genes are enriched pathways, the color of which denotes
  the p-value of the enriched pathway, the larger the square node, the more genes
  are annotated in this pathway
