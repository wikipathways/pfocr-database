caption: Mechanism of action of first-in-class drugs. (A) In pulmonary arterial hypertension
  (PAH), endothelin-1 (ET-1) activates ETA and ETB receptors leading to endothelial
  dysfunction, vasoconstriction, vascular remodelling (hypertrophy, fibrosis, and
  proliferation), inflammation, sympathetic activation, and increased aldosterone
  synthesis. Aprocitentan, the active metabolite of macitentan, prevents the binding
  of ET-1 to both ETA/ETB receptors and inhibits ET-1-mediated signalling. (B) The
  fixed-dose combination of macitentan, a dual ETA and ETB receptor antagonist, and
  sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDEI), simultaneously targeted the
  ET-1 and the nitric oxide (NO) pathways involved in the pathophysiology of PAH.
  NO produced in endothelial cells (ECs) enter the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle
  cells (PVSMCs) binds to soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) increasing its catalytic
  activity, and the conversion of guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP) into guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic
  monophosphate (cGMP), which causes smooth muscle relaxation and antiproliferative
  effects. This signalling pathway is counterbalanced by sildenafil, which blocks
  the degradation of cGMP to 5′-guanosine monophosphate. The simultaneous blockade
  of the ET-1 and NO signalling with macitentan and sildenafil allows to reach better
  outcomes in patients with PAH as compared with each drug in monotherapy. (C) Sotatercept
  rebalances growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting signalling. In PAH there is a
  down-regulation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor type II (BMPR2)–Smad1/5/8
  pathway in PVSMCs leading to an increased production of activin ligands and an up-regulation
  of the activin receptor type IIA (ActRIIA)–Smad2/3 pathway. Increased phosphorylated
  Smad (pSmad)2/3 activity promotes the expression of endogenous BMP antagonists,
  gremlin-1 and noggin, which further reduces BMP–Smad1/5/8 signalling. The result
  is a reduction in antiproliferative and an increase in proproliferative signalling
  pathways counteracting pulmonary vascular remodelling. Sotatercept acts to sequester
  excess of ActRIIA ligands, thereby reducing ActRIIA–Smad2/3 signalling to rebalance
  growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting signalling. ALK, activin receptor-like kinase;
  pSmad, phosphorylated Smad; Smad, small mothers against decapentaplegic protein
