caption: 'Complete RNM for the MAPK Cancer Cell Fate Network of Grieco et al.57(A–F)
  The MAPK Cancer Cell Fate GRN (A) has been decomposed into: (1) an input node layer
  (“DNA damage”, “EGFR stimulus”, “FGFR3 stimulus”, “TGFBR stimulus”, see (B); (2)
  a network core (all non-input and non-output nodes in A, not shown); and (3) an
  output node layer (“Apoptosis”, “Growth Arrest”, and “Proliferation” nodes in (C)),
  representing the output responses of the network that form 15 unique equilibrium
  states (C). Each input node variable represents an information bit, which taken
  together, form 16 input “words” where the colorbar indicates expression levels (B).
  Each equilibrium output state is associated with an equilibrium type (e.g., point
  attractor, limit cycle, and to a unique expression pattern of all output nodes ((C),
  where colorbar indicates expression levels). Nodes in (A) are color coded to their
  hierarchical level.58 We further associate output equilibrium states with no apoptosis,
  low cell-cycle arrest, and high proliferation as indicative of the cancer cell state
  (i.e., “Apoptosis” = 0, “Growth Arrest” = 0, and “Proliferation” = 1 represents
  the ideal cancer state with closest state matches indicated in (B)), whereas limit
  cycle cell states that cycle through proliferation, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis
  expression regimes are indicative of the health cell state (B). The pathway analysis
  of the G-NFSM showing sustained input interventions leading from a cancer-like State
  2 to healthy States 9, 10, 11, and 12 is shown in (D), where node color indicates
  the Euclidean distance of the equilibrium output state from the idealized cancer
  state. The complete set of E-NFSMs for the system are shown in (E), indicating temporary
  stimuli can lead to permanent transition to a cancer state (sub-graphs ‘Held at
  I8’ and ‘Held at I10’ in E), but that there are no temporary stimuli that can treat
  cancer. The full G-NFSM for the system is shown in (F), revealing all held interventions
  that allow for access and movement between states'
