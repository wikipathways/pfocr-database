caption: A reconstructed model for polarity control and apical branching in A. niger.
  The model rests on transcriptomic and phenotypic data obtained from ramosa-1 mutant
  and wild-type A. niger (this work and references  and ), as well as on assumptions
  deduced from conserved mechanisms in yeast and mammalian systems (see Discussion
  for references). Basically, TORC2 exerts at least three important cellular functions.
  (i) TORC2 plays a crucial role in maintaining actin polarization, among other things,
  via calcineurin inhibition. (ii) TORC2 is essential for cell wall biosynthesis and
  activates PKC, the initiator kinase of the CWI pathway. (iii) TORC2 inhibits expression
  of oxidative stress genes under nonstressed conditions (not indicated in the figure).
  RmsAY447N, however, negatively interferes with A. niger TORC2 function, resulting
  in actin depolarization, induction of apical branch formation, and derepression
  of oxidative stress genes. To counteract failure of TORC2, increased synthesis of
  important (phospho)lipid signaling molecules takes place (reactions 1 to 6) (Table  and
  Fig. ), resulting in (i) increased Rom2p/Rho1p activation (via PIP2) aiming to repolarize
  actin, (ii) reactivation of TORC2 (via PIP2), (iii) reinforced PKC activation (via
  DAG) and thereby amplified expression of cell wall-related genes, and (iv) repolarization
  of actin (via IP7).
