caption: Overview of the saponin biosynthetic pathway in Aralia elata and expression
  profiles of key enzyme encoding genes. The histogram shows the expression levels
  of different genes in different tissues. Green indicates the amount of expression
  in the leaves, red indicates the amount of expression in the stem, and blue indicates
  the amount of expression in the root. The most genes of enzymes involved in the
  saponin biosynthesis pathway were highly expressed in roots higher than in leaves
  and stems.
