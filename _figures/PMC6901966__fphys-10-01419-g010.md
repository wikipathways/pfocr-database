caption: Protective effects of farrerol on CDDP-induced AKI and the underlying mechanism.
  Cisplatin enters the kidney and induces the production of a large amount of ROS.
  On the one hand, ROS can directly cause oxidative stress, and on the other hand,
  ROS activate NF-κB and p53 via the MAPK pathway and thereby induce changes in inflammation
  and apoptosis. Farrerol alleviates the generation of ROS by activating Nrf2, which
  in turn regulates the oxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis signaling pathways.

  Pathways.
