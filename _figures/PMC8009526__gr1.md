caption: Cytokine Pathway Markers Networks for suicide attempters, suicide ideators,
  and healthy controlsNote. Between-network partial correlation comparisons diagrams
  for CPMs networks are provided below. Edges with significant differences (prior
  to multiple corrections) in between-network comparisons are provided. Blue lines
  indicate greater partial correlations and red lines indicate lower partial correlations
  in the first comparator group (e.g. SI in a) as compared to the second comparator
  group (e.g. SA in a). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
  legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
