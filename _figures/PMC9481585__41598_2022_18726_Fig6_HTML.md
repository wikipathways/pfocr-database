caption: Top) Proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of (–)-tatiomicin (3) based on
  homology with the biosynthetic gene cluster for the rishirilides. Enzymes shown
  in red have no direct congener in the rishirilide BGC and their biosynthetic role
  is hypothesised, based on BLAST analysis. Bottom) comparison of the rishirilide
  and (-) tatiomicin gene cluter based on BLAST analysis. (red; tatS = starter unit
  biosynthesis, tatK or rslK = chain biosynthesis), polyketide modification (blue;
  tatO or rslO = oxidoreductases, tatC or rslO = cyclases), regulation (yellow; tatR
  or rslR), transport (green, tatT or rslT) and others (grey; tatP or rslP = phosphorylase;
  tatM = methyltransferases, black; genes not assigned to the tatiomicin BGC based
  on homology to the rishirilide BGC and proposed biosynthetic pathway)).
