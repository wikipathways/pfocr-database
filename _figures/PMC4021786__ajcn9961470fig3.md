caption: Metabolic pathways featuring γ-Glu dipeptides and AHB. The metabolites in
  the γ-glutamyl peptide pathway (in the left box) were negatively related to alcohol
  consumption; 2-hydroxybutyrate and branched-chain α-keto acids (in the right bottom
  boxes, AHB-related metabolites) were positively related to alcohol consumption.
  BC, branched chain; AHB, 2-hydroxybutyrate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; γ-Glu, γ-glutamyl.
