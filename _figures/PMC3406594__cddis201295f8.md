caption: Schematic model showing role of AMPK-α1 as an upstream kinase of TAK1 in
  TLR4-mediated signaling pathway. Binding of LPS derived from bacterial components
  to TLR4 initiates intracellular signaling cascades, initially leading to the recruitment
  of adapter molecules such as MyD88, IRAKs, and Mal proteins. Two critical events
  for the activation of TAK1 may occur in the middle of signaling cascades. Upon TLR4
  stimulation, the activation of AMPK-α1 is simultaneously induced by LKB1 and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase, and then activated AMPK-α1 can induce activation of JNK/p38MAPK
  pathway, thereby inducing activations of AP-1 components such as c-Jun and c-fos.
  Simultaneously, activated AMPK-α1 specifically interacts with TAK1 through the molecular
  interaction between N-terminus of TAK1 and autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-α1, and
  then AMPK-α1 and TAK1 reciprocally induces phosphorylations of TAK1 for the activation.
  In turn, the activated TAK1 subsequently induces the phosphorylation of IKKβ, leading
  to IκB degradation and activation of NF-κB. Subsequently, proinflammatory cytokine
  genes such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 are expressed
