caption: 'Model of the σB signal transduction network. (A) Two independent signaling
  pathways converge on RsbV anti-anti-σ and RsbW anti-σ, the direct regulators of
  σB activity. Phosphorylated RsbV (RsbV-P) is the antagonist form in unstressed cells.
  When activated by the upstream elements shown in panel B, the environmental signaling
  phosphatase RsbU dephosphorylates RsbV-P, allowing it to bind RsbW and induce the
  release of σB. (B) In the environmental signaling branch, RsbS and RsbT are paralogs
  of RsbV and RsbW, respectively. RsbS is the antagonist form in unstressed cells,
  and RsbRA, RsbRB, RsbRC, and RsbRD are redundant coantagonists that make up a large
  environmental signaling complex with RsbS. This complex binds the RsbT phosphatase
  regulator and holds it inactive. Following environmental stress, RsbT phosphorylates
  RsbRA and RsbS, releasing RsbT to activate the RsbU phosphatase. The RsbX feedback
  respectively. RsbS is the antagonist form in unstressed cells, and RsbRA, RsbRB,
  RsbRC, and RsbRD are redundant coantagonists that make up a large environmental
  signaling complex with RsbS. This complex binds the RsbT phosphatase regulator and
  holds it inactive. Following environmental stress, RsbT phosphorylates RsbRA and
  RsbS, releasing RsbT to activate the RsbU phosphatase. The RsbX feedback phosphatase
  returns the system to its prestress condition. Phosphorylation of RsbRB, RsbRC,
  and RsbRD is not shown but is thought to resemble that of RsbRA. Here we present
  evidence that the blue-light receptor protein YtvA is also a constituent of the
  large environmental signaling complex. (C) Members of the RsbR family share a C-terminal
  STAS domain (shaded) with the smaller RsbS antagonist but have different N-terminal
  domains: either a nonheme globin domain thought to be important for signaling (RsbR
  coantagonist proteins) or a LOV domain with an FMN chromophore that forms a light-dependent
  photoadduct with LOV-C62 (YtvA blue-light receptor). Residues at conserved positions
  within the STAS domain are charged (RsbS D26, YtvA E168 and E202) or are phosphorylated
  by RsbT (RsbS S59, RsbRA T171 and T205).'
