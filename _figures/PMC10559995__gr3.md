caption: Estrogen metabolism pathway in humans. The diagram shows the metabolism of
  estradiol and other natural estrogens such as estrone and estriol. It demonstrates
  that conjugation (e.g., sulfation and glucuronidation) occurs in the case of estradiol
  and metabolites of estradiol that have one or more available hydroxyl (–OH) groups.
  Catechol and quinone formation from estrone is shown and how the derivatives are
  reacting with DNA to form depurination DNA adducts (adapted from Ref. [16]).
