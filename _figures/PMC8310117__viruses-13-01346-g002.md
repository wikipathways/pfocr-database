caption: Potential molecular mechanisms involved in coagulopathy during SARS-CoV-2
  infection. (1) When SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors expressed by endothelial
  cells (ECs), they damage the endothelial cell membrane, which leads to intracellular
  changes such as endothelium swelling, collagen exposure, and decreased junctional
  proteins. The collagen causes platelet aggregation and clot formation. (2) Since
  platelet expresses ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 binds to platelets and activates, as evidenced
  by the expression of activation and adhesion molecules, P-selectin and integrin,
  respectively. These adhesion molecules bind to circulating monocytes, which secretes
  tissue factor (TF) that is known to activate the extrinsic coagulation pathway and
  leads to clot formation. (3) The red blood cells (RBCs) that are recruited to the
  inflamed vasculature undergo changes in their symmetry and thereby expressed phosphatidylserine
  (PS), which might lead to thrombin formation. (4) SARS-CoV-2 induces caspase 8 in
  the endothelial cells, which expose PS on the cell surface. This attracts the FXIIa
  coagulation component to initiate clot formation. (5) The recruited neutrophil at
  the site of inflammation releases neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that contain
  TF and FXIIa. These NETs induce vessel resident macrophages to release IL-1β pro-inflammatory
  cytokine that acts on vascular endothelium to liberate von Willebrand factor (vWF).
  Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) are elongated secretory organelles specific to endothelial
  cells that contain von Willebrand factor (vWF) and a variety of other factors. (6)
  These vWFs further induce NETs that serve as the docking site for platelets and
  RBCs. (7) These changes in the vascular microenvironment induce a massive amount
  of cytokine cocktail called “cytokine storm,” which ultimately induces a coagulation
  pathway to form a clot. (8) Further, complement C5b act on endothelium to induce
  TF, which leads to clot formation. (9) Cumulatively, the molecular and cellular
  mechanisms that are coordinately responsible for inducing and reinforcing the fibrin
  clot in COVID-19 positive patients.
