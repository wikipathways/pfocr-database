caption: 'The canonical STAT3 signaling pathway is activated by multiple receptors,
  including interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) receptors, IL‐6 family cytokine receptors (such as
  IL‐11 and IL‐23 receptors), growth factor receptors, G protein‐coupled receptors
  (GPCRs), and Toll‐like receptors (TLRs). These receptors are stimulated by various
  ligands, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cytokines, sphingosine‐1‐phosphate,
  angiotensin, and hormones. Most of these receptors lack intrinsic kinase activity.
  Upon ligand binding, conformational changes occur, leading to the activation of
  Janus kinases (JAKs), which serve as docking sites for STAT3 via the SH2 domain.
  Additionally, oncoproteins with tyrosine kinase activity, such as SRC and BCR‐ABL,
  constitutively activate STAT3. Phosphorylated STAT3 molecules form dimers when the
  phosphorylated tyrosine residue at position 705 on one STAT3 molecule interacts
  with the SH2 domain of another STAT3 molecule. These dimers translocate into the
  nucleus, where they bind to DNA response elements within the promoter regions of
  target genes. These genes regulate various biological processes, including angiogenesis,
  cancer metastasis, immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment, metabolic
  alterations, exosome‐mediated signaling, cancer stem cell properties, and drug resistance.
  The noncanonical STAT3 signaling pathway exists in three distinct forms: Tyr705–phosphorylated
  STAT3 (alone or in combination with p‐STAT3 Ser727, mtSTAT3, and unphosphorylated
  STAT3). These variants modulate nuclear factor kappa B (NF‐κB), mitochondrial respiration,
  and other gene functions, some of which remain to be fully elucidated. Created with
  Biorender.com. EGF, epidermal growth factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor;
  CSF1, colony‐stimulating factor 1; mtSTAT3, mitochondrial signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3; NF‐κB, nuclear factor kappa B'
