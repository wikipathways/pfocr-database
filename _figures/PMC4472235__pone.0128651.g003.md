caption: In Braak alpha-synuclein 1 and 2, minimal cell loss is observed along with
  decreased endocytosis and anterograde trafficking, and increased immune response
  and microglial activation. In addition, we observed down regulation of mRNA levels
  of the upstream regulators in mTOR pathway. In Braak alpha-synuclein 3 and 4, a
  steep decline in cell loss and increase in alpha-synuclein pathology is observed
  together disturbed regulation of protein production and apoptosis of the nigral
  dopaminergic cells. In Braak alpha-synuclein 5 and 6 compared to controls, severe
  cell loss and alpha-synuclein aggregation is observed []. At this advanced stage,
  alterations in pathways related to dopaminergic signaling and immune response are
  still observed.
