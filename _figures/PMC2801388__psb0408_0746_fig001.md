caption: 'A condensed scheme of glycerol metabolism in plants. Glycerol is phosphorylated
  to glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) by glycerol kinase (GK; GLI1). G3P can also be generated
  by G3P dehydrogenase (G3Pdh) via the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)
  in both the cytosol and the plastids (represented by the oval). G3P generated by
  this reaction can be transported between the cytosol and plastid stroma. In the
  plastids G3P is acylated with oleic acid (18:1) by the ACT1-encoded G3P acyltransferase.
  This ACT1-utilized 18:1 is derived from the stearoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP)-desaturase
  (SSI2)-catalyzed desaturation of stearic acid (18:0). The 18:1-ACP generated by
  SSI2 either enters the prokaryotic lipid biosynthetic pathway through acylation
  of G3P, or is exported out of the plastids as a coenzyme A (CoA)-thioester to enter
  the eukaryotic lipid biosynthetic pathway. Other abbreviations used are: PA, phosphatidic
  acid; Lyso-PA, acyl-G3P; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; MGD, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol;
  DGD, digalactosyl-diacylglycerol; SL, sulfolipid; DAG, diacylglycerol; DHA, dihydroxyacetone;
  Gl-3-P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle. Enzymes as abbreviated
  as: ACT1, G3P acyltransferase; SSI2, stearoyl acyl carrier protein desaturase; GK,
  glycerol kinase; G3Pdh, G3P dehydrogenase; TPI, triose phosphate isomerase; DHAK,
  dihydroxyacetone kinase; F1,6-A, fructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase; PF6P-P, pyrophosphate
  fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase; G6P-I, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase.'
