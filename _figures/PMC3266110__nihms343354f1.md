caption: nIgM can maintain immune equilibrium through regulating the tissue homeostasis
  and by acting as a first line of defense against invading microbes and shaping the
  subsequent immune response. The role of nIgM in tissue homeostasis implicates activation
  of compliment pathways and helps to prevent inflammation, autoimmunity and malignancy.
  These functions include recognition of apoptotic cell membranes and promoting the
  clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytic cells such as DC and MΘ, clearance of
  altered or malignant cells or misfolded proteins, and regulation of the disease-associated
  IgG and B cell clones. Further, nIgM can confer protection against invading pathogens
  through direct neutralization of pathogens, activation of classical complement pathways,
  opsonization of pathogens and phagocytosis by DC and MΘ, and transportation of antigens
  to lymphoid organs for initiating the immune responses by innate immune cells. In
  addition, nIgM can also regulate the immune response to pathogens by influencing
  the T cell polarization and B cell class-switch.DC, dendritic cell; MΘ, macrophage;
  C1Q, complement C1Q (classical complement pathway); MBL, mannose binding lectin
  (lectin complement pathway); B, B cell; T, T cell. Further, recent reports have
  also highlighted the potential roles of nIgM in tissue homeostasis via multiple
  ways such as
