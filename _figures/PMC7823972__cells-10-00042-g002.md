caption: MSC-exosomes are capable of protecting against radiation-induced damage to
  hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic systems. In hematopoietic reconstruction post
  irradiation, MSC-exosomes enhance hematopoietic cell survival and proliferation
  by carrying functional molecules, such as the pro-regeneration miRNAs miRNA221,
  miRNA451 and miRNA654, the anti-apoptosis-related miRNAs miRNA210, miRNA106b and
  miRNA155, the hematopoiesis-related cytokines G-CSF and IL-8, and the hematopoiesis-related
  growth factor VEGF. In addition, MSC-exosomes can protect irradiated bone marrow
  MSCs from radiation-induced DNA and oxidative stress damage by activating the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. With regard to the non-hematopoietic system, MSC-exosomes reduce
  apoptosis of skin epidermal, lung alveolar epithelium and intestinal epithelium
  cells, as MSC-exosomal miRNAs likely mediate repair of DNA double-strand breaks
  in damaged cells. Oxidative stress reaction and DNA damage are the major processes
  in radiation damage. MSC-exosomes can overcome these crucial events effectively,
  and have potential to suppress the development of acute and chronic radiation damage
  from several aspects. MSC-exosomes also facilitate vascular endothelium proliferation
  owing to their bioactive cargo molecules, such as PDGF, FGF and EGF.
