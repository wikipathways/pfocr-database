caption: Salicylic acid biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway. The expression
  levels of DEGs were standardized, and the log10(Gene Expression) was calculated.
  Red represented genes with high expression. The black double line is the cell membrane
  and the grey dotted line is the nuclear membrane. The blue squares indicated that
  the metabolites were not measured. “?” indicated that an enzyme has not been confirmed.
  The pathway referred to the map00400, map00360, and map04075 in the KEGG database
  and we have obtained the permission from the Kanehisa laboratory
