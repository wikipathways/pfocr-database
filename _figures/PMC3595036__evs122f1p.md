caption: AI-2 biosynthetic pathway and Lsr-mediated transport and processing in Escherichia
  coli. (A) The precursor of AI-2 biosynthesis is SAM, an essential compound in central
  metabolism used as a methyl donor for DNA, RNA, and proteins. Following methyl transfer
  from SAM to its various substrates, the toxic compound SAH is formed. The Pfs enzyme
  removes adenine from SAH to form SRH. LuxS acts on SRH to produce homocysteine and
  AI-2 that released into the extracellular environment. (B1) AI-2 is bound by the
  periplasmic protein LsrB and internalized by the Lsr ATP-binding cassette transporter.
  Intracellular AI-2 is phosphorylated by LsrK, and the phosphorylated form of the
  signal (P-AI-2) induces lsr transcription by derepressing the repressor of the lsr
  operon (LsrR). This results in further assembly of the transporter and rapid AI-2
  internalization. LsrF and LsrG proteins are also encoded by the lsr operon and are
  required for the further processing of intracellular P-AI-2. (B2, B3) Shaded cells
  represent examples of strains that maintain production of AI-2 although they lack
  the ability to sequester and process the extracellular AI-2 signal through the Lsr
  system (B2) or lack the Lsr system completely (B3). Pentagons represent the AI-2
  signal.
