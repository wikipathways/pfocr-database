caption: H. pylori promotes ZEB1 stabilization and recruitment to PRTG promoter, and
  which resulted the upregulation of PRTG expression. Then, PRTG activated the subsequent
  cGMP/PKG signaling pathway to perform oncogenic activities. PKG inhibitor KT5823
  antagonizes the effect of PRTG-induced gastric cancer progression and enhance the
  effect of chemotherapy.
