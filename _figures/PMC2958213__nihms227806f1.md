caption: (A) The exon-intron structure of the human NRG-1 gene locus. The location
  of the core at-risk NRG-1 HAPice, HAPChinese and HAPPortuguese haplotypes, as well
  as the single nucleotide polymorphism SNP8NRG243177 and a missense mutation in the
  exon encoding the transmembrane domain (TM) identified in Costa Rica, are indicated.
  (B) Schematic view of differential promoters and splicing events underlying NRG1
  isoform diversity (adapted with permission from ()).
