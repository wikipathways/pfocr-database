caption: Working model of metabolic conversions in the jasmonate pathway upon Botrytis
  infection. All represented jasmonates accumulate in infected leaves, but with distinct
  pool sizes and possible differences in major routes compared with the wound response
  (). The hormone JA-Ile is oxidized/inactivated to 12-OH-JA-Ile and 12-COOH-JA-Ile
  by the CYP94B3 and CYP94C1 enzymes. Additional conversion routes were inferred after
  profiling CYP94 KO or OE lines. Tuberonic acid (12-OH-JA; TA) and 12-O-Glc-JA seem
  to be formed in infected WT plants by unknown enzymes (dashed line) with a minor
  contribution of CYP94 activity. In contrast, accumulation of 12-HSO4-JA is strongly
  CYP94B3 dependent. CYP94B3 and CYP94C1 overexpression enhances a metabolic route
  leading to increased 12-O-Glc-JA and 12-HSO4-JA formation that does not involve
  free 12-OH-JA accumulation. IAR3 and ILL6 expression is also induced in infected
  leaves, and these amidohydrolases may be recruited in OE plants to allow the formation
  of additional 12-O-Glc-JA and 12-HSO4-JA from 12-OH-JA-Ile. Such a route probably
  implies an uncharacterized UDP-glucose glucosyltransferase (UGT) and the sulfotransferase
  ST2a. JA-Ile signalling activity is strongly reduced by hydroxylation and abolished
  by further oxidation to 12-COOH-JA-Ile. In addition to JAZ induction as a negative-feedback
  loop, hormonal oxidation also reduces the timing and amplitude of the pathway defence
  output. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)
