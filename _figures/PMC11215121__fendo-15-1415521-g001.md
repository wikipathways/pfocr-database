caption: Insulin signaling transduction and insulin resistance. Insulin signaling
  pathways are complicated, among which the IRS/PI3K/Akt pathway has received much
  attention as it is well conserved and plays a role in many cellular processes. Firstly,
  as the capacity of insulin receptors to bind with ligands is a key factor in transduction,
  a downregulated number of insulin receptors and decreased insulin receptor affinity
  would significantly restrict normal insulin signaling. The latter could be due to
  mutations in insulin receptors and autoimmune antibodies against insulin receptors.
  Subsequently, any factors that reduce IRS phosphorylation or induce IRS phosphorylation
  at certain sites (such as serine IRS-1 phosphorylation at the 307 site) would impair
  downstream pathway transduction. Collectively, in this process, any abnormalities
  in these agents may impair normal insulin signaling transduction and lead to insulin
  resistance.
