caption: (A) Following internalization, Francisella resides in a vacuole that sequentially
  acquires markers of early endosomes (EE) and late endosomes (LE). Francisella escapes
  the original vacuole before lysosomal fusion to reach the cytosol. Once in the cytosol,
  the F. tularensis capsular and lipopolysaccharide O-antigen is an essential component
  of xenophagy avoidance. Francisella replicates rapidly in the cytosol of host cells
  and is found adjacent to autophagosomes. F. tularensis acquires amino acids generated
  via autophagy in an Atg5 independent manner. After extensive replication in murine
  macrophages, some bacteria are found in Francisella-containing vacuoles (FCVs).
  (B) Brucella exploits functions of the host secretory pathway to grow within membrane
  bound compartments called Brucella-containing vacuoles (BCV) throughout its intracellular
  life cycle. Brucella first traffics along the endocytic pathway in an endosomal
  BCV (eBCV), which acquires early endosomal (EE) markers then late endosomal (LE)
  markers, and partially fuses with lysosomes. Brucella then accesses the secretory
  pathway via interactions with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites (ERES) to access
  the ER. B. abortus requires the autophagy proteins ATG9 and WIPI, for biogenesis
  of the replicative BCV (rBCV) derived from ER membranes. After extensive replication,
  some rBCV are engulfed by autophagosome-like structures to become autophagic BCVs
  (aBCVs), which are involved in bacterial release and cell-to-cell spread. B. abortus
  selectively subverts several autophagy initiation complexes containing ULK1, BECN1,
  VPS34 and PI3P to generate an autophagic vacuole important for egress and cell-to-cell
  spread.
