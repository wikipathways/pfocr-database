caption: '(A) Kynurenic acid (KA) is the product of kynurenine pathway, the central
  metabolite of the tryptophan metabolism. (B) Inhibition of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase
  by Ro 61-8048 or by modulating KMO expression could increase the levels of KA. An
  increase in KA can inhibit α7nAChRs. (C) Genomic context of KMO gene located on
  the forward strand at GRCh38/hg38 genomic coordinates: chr1: 241,531,883-241,595,647
  and convergently paired to ncRNA uncharacterized LOC105373233 locus mapped on reverse
  strand at genomic coordinates: chr1:241,585,025-241,588,836. The LOC105373233 locus
  located at KMO 3′-region complement strand.'
