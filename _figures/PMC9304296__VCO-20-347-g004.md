caption: The role of BRCA1/2 in DNA repair via homologous recombination. After a DNA
  lesion occurs, sensor proteins attract 53BP1 to start the NHEJ. However, when BRCA1
  is recruited to the DNA lesion sites, it inhibits 53BP1‐TopBP1 interactions and
  promotes HR pathway instead. BCRA1 helps in the recruitment of Rad51. Then Rad51
  forms a complex with PALB2 and BRCA2, and the complex is relocated from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus. There, Rad51 binds DNA lesion site by interacting with RPA and replacing
  it. Finally, Rad51 forms nucleoprotein filaments on ssDNA that create a more stable
  platform for the repair machinery
