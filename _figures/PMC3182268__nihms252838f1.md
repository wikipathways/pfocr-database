caption: The apoptotic pathway to cell death from the perspective of the Bcl-2 family
  of proteins.1, The intrinsic pathway is initiated by various signals, principally
  extracellular stimuli. 2, The extrinsic pathway is activated by Fas ligand or TRAIL,
  subsequently activating caspase-8. Caspase-8 transforms Bid into truncated Bid.
  In addition, caspase-8 initiates a cascade of caspase activation. 3, BH3-only proteins
  (Bim, Bid, Bad, Noxa, Puma) engage with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to
  relieve their inhibition of Bax and Bak to activate them. 4, Next, Bax and Bak are
  oligomerized and activated, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.
  5, Once mitochondrial membranes are permeabilized, cytochrome c and/or Smac/DIABLO
  is released into the cytoplasm, wherein they combine with an adaptor molecule, apoptosis
  protease-activating factor 1, and an inactive initiator caspase, procaspase-9, within
  a multiprotein complex called the apoptosome. Smac/DIABLO inhibits inhibitors of
  apoptosis proteins to activate caspase-9. 6, Caspase-9 activates caspase-3, which
  is the initiation step for the cascade of caspase activation. Intrinsic and extrinsic
  pathways converge on caspase-3. Bcl-2 family proteins are also found on the endoplasmic
  reticulum and the perinuclear membrane in hematopoietic cells, but they are predominantly
  localized to mitochondria.
