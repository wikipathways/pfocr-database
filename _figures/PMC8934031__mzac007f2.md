caption: Examples of clinical decision trees in Oncoguide. (a) Hypothetical CDT for
  a specific population at a specific step in the care pathway. (b) All data-items
  (nodes) required by the CDT for this patient are available and filled in on each
  node, resulting in a single highlighted pathway, leading to a single leaf with CPG
  recommendation. (c) One data-item (white node) is missing, the CDT generates two
  possible leaves with CPG recommendations. (d) One data-item (white node) is missing.
  Since other data-items are known, the CDT generates two leaves with CPG recommendations.
  CDTs are composed of (I) a stem (defining the population and step in the care pathway
  the CDT applies to), (II) nodes (data-items representing patient and disease characteristics),
  (iii) branches (representing the possible values of the data-items) and (IV) leaves
  (representing recommendations from the CPG). By entering patient specific values,
  a single leaf with a recommendation applicable for this patient can be generated.
