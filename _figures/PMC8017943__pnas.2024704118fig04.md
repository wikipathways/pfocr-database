caption: GA biosynthesis and isoprenoid pathway mRNAs in SRB suspensor and embryo
  proper regions. (A) GA and MEP pathways, and fold-change levels (number in red squares)
  of pathway mRNAs. GA pathway, MEP pathway, and enzyme intracellular locations were
  taken from published information (–). Enzyme intracellular localizations were confirmed
  using the DeepLoc machine learning tool () (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods and
  Dataset S3). Suspensor and adjacent embryo proper cell model is based on representation
  of enzyme, receptor, and transporter mRNAs in these embryo regions (A and C). GA
  efflux and influx from the suspensor to the embryo proper is based on classical
  experiments with SRB embryos, suggesting that GA is transferred from the suspensor
  to the embryo proper (, ). (B) The interaction of GA, GA receptors (GID), and DELLA
  in GA signaling pathway (). (C) Representation of GA transporter, receptor, and
  DELLA mRNAs in suspensor and embryo proper. (D) GA biosynthesis enzyme, MEP pathway
  enzyme, and GA signaling protein abbreviations. Enzyme abbreviations are defined
  in SI Appendix, Table S1.
