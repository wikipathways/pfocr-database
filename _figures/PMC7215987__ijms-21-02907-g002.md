caption: Main components and crosstalk between the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein
  kinase-Ras- extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK) pathway, the
  spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) pathway and the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. All pathways
  respond to extracellular and intracellular signals to control cell survival, proliferation,
  motility, and metabolism, and are activated by the binding of a growth factor to
  a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) or integrins to receptors. In the Ras-MAPK pathway,
  this binding produces binding sites for the SHC and GRB2 adaptor molecules that
  recruit SOS to the membrane. SOS catalyzes the exchange of Ras GDP to Ras GTP, followed
  by the recruitment and activation of Raf. Protein kinase C (PKC) is directly bound
  and activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) through its mimicking of
  the natural ligand of PKC. The mechanism by which PKC activates ERK remains unclear.
  Following a Ras activation of MEK, ERK is activated through an activation loop phosphorylation.
  The pathway is further regulated by a negative feedback loop from ERK. Pathway crosstalk
  is regulated through cross-inhibition and cross-activation between the components
  of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways. Pathway crosstalk can also be
  regulated by binding of the p85 subunit of PI3K by phosphorylated SYK. When active,
  SYK increases the catalytic activity of PI3K, resulting in conversion of phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to PIP3. PI3K-Akt and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling networks
  exhibit examples of crosstalk between intracellular signaling proteins. Positive
  regulation (activation/stimulation) of the pathways is presented as black arrows,
  and negative regulation (inhibition) of the pathways is presented as red blunt-ended
  lines. PI3K and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling meet on mTORC1, which is the master controller
  of protein translation. PTEN acts as a strong negative regulator of both pathways.
  Akt can cross-react with among others the Forkhead box O (FOXO), B-cell lymphoma
  (BCL) 2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)
  and phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK2). The abbreviations shown in the figure can be found
  in the list of abbreviations.
