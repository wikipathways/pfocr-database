caption: Predicted pathways might be involved in the interaction between CSFV p7 and
  host cells. 1 JAK-STAT pathway. Our previous study revealed that the JAK-STAT pathway
  might play a significant role in CSFV infection (). In the present study, PIAS1
  (protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1) was found to be a potential binding partner
  of the CSFV p7, which suggested that p7 might regulate the JAK-STAT pathway by interacting
  with PIAS1. 2 The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). It was reported that p7 was
  a short-lived protein as it could be easily degraded by the proteasome (). PIAS1
  was involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis based on the results of the KEGG
  pathway analysis. POMP (proteasome maturation protein) was related to the proteasome
  assembly. COPS2 (COP9 signalosome subunit 2) might be related to the UPS as the
  COP9 signalosome could regulate the UPS (). Thus, PIAS1, POMP, and COPS2 might be
  involved in the UPS and CSFV p7 might have a close relationship with the UPS. 3
  The calcium signaling pathway. The calcium signaling pathway was also enriched based
  on the KEGG pathway analysis and VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel 1) was included
  in this pathway. Our previous work has demonstrated that the increase of [Ca2+]cyto
  mediated by CSFV infection could potently induce autophagy (). 4 The cGMP-PKG signaling
  pathway. The cGMP-PKG signaling pathway was predicted based on the KEGG pathway
  analysis and VDAC1 was included in this pathway. It was reported that the cGMP-PKG
  signaling pathway was associated with the replication of some viruses, such as spring
  viremia of carp virus (), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (),
  and HIV-1 (). Thus, we speculated that the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway might be related
  to CSFV replication. 5 Regulation of microtubule function. MAPRE1 (microtubule-associated
  protein RP/EB family member 1), was involved in protein localization to microtubule
  plus-end, regulation of microtubule polymerization or depolymerization. MAPRE1 was
  a potential binding partner of the p7, which suggested that p7 might be associated
  with the regulation of microtubule function. 6 Other pathways. CNTN1 (contactin
  1) or GGNBP2 (gametogenetin binding protein 2) associated pathway was unclear. The
  predicted pathways were drawn using Pathway Builder Tool 2.0.
