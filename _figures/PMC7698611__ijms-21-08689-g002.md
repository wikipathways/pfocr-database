caption: Angiopoietin-TIE signaling under normal conditions and inflammation. (a)
  Under normal conditions, when ANG2 expression is low, ANG2 is stored in Weibel–Palade
  bodies. ANG1, which dominates ANG2 levels, binds to and activates TIE2. Along with
  co-receptor TIE1, TIE2 is phosphorylated (p-TIE2), which in turn activates phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K/AKT) signaling. Phosphorylated AKT inactivates the forkhead transcription
  factor (FOXO1) via nuclear exclusion, inhibiting further ANG2 expression. As a result,
  vessel quiescence and vascular stability are maintained. (b) In inflammation, ANG2
  is upregulated and competes with ANG1 for TIE2 receptor binding. The ectodomain
  of co-receptor TIE1 is cleaved leading to p-TIE2 suppression and PI3K/AKT inactivation.
  Consequently, activated FOXO1 increases ANG2 expression, which sustains positive
  feedback of TIE2 signaling suppression and ultimately contributes to vascular destabilization
  and leakage.
