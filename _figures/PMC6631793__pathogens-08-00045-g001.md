caption: Iatrogenic interference with the initiation of antifungal immunity. Pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the fungal cell wall (e.g., β-glucan) are detected
  by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the plasma membranes of host phagocytes
  (e.g., Dectin-1). This initiates Syk-dependent assembly of the CBM (CARD9-BCL10-MALT1)
  signalosome, leading to NF-κB activation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  signalling and a calcium flux, resulting in antifungal cellular responses. Treatments
  for comorbidities, such as anti-cancer therapies plus antibiotics, can interfere
  with this fungal detection pathway, as highlighted by red inhibitory arrows. Syk,
  spleen tyrosine kinase; CARD9, caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9;
  MALT1, mucosa associated lymphoid tissue translocation protein 1; BCL10, B-cell
  lymphoma 10; IL, interleukin; Th, T helper; MAF, macrophage-activating factor; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; NFκB, nuclear factor kappa B.
