caption: The jasmonate core pathway and its modulating factors. A conceptual, non-exhaustive
  overview is presented. General and specific herbivore-associated patterns, including
  HAMPs, DAMPs and wounding, activate the jasmonate pathway (blue area). Increased
  accumulation of JA-Ile promotes the interaction of JAZ proteins with the SCF ubiquitin
  ligase SCFCOI1. Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of JAZs by the 26S proteasome releases
  transcription factors from their JAZ-bound repressed state, thereby activating the
  expression of transcriptional regulons that promote defense and inhibit vegetative
  growth. JA-independent hormonal pathways are also induced (purple area), and several
  hormones, including salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET), auxin, gibberellins (GA),
  cytokinins (CK) and brassinosteroids (BR) modulate JA metabolism and signaling (light-blue
  area). Herbivory also leads to oxidative stress, changes in intracellular pH and
  dessication, which modulate the JA pathway either directly or indirectly through
  other hormones. Together, this leads to complex phenotypic changes that comprise
  both specific and general responses, the majority of which can be linked back to
  the jasmonate pathway.
