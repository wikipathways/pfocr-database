caption: Proteins significantly altered by torcetrapib associated with aldosterone
  synthesis or function. Nodes represent gene symbol name, corresponding to protein
  measured. Degree of intensity of the node color (red) indicates degree of significance
  of the false discovery rate P value. Dashed lines correspond to the implicated function
  of the given proteins according to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis knowledge bank.
  Node shapes denote cytokine (□), growth factor (□), and other (○). ANGPT2 indicates
  angiopoietin-2; BMP6, bone morphometric protein 6; DKK3, Dickkopf-related protein
  3; NPPB, natriuretic peptide B; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin; PYY, peptide YY; and
  TGFB1, transforming growth factor-β1. *Given protein was represented in the modified
  aptamer assay more than once.
