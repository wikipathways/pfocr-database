caption: The classic and alternative bile synthetic pathways. CYP7A1, cholesterol
  7α-hydroxylase, is the rate limiting enzyme in the classic (neutral) pathway. HSD3B7,
  3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7, creates the common precursor, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one
  (C4), for both primary bile acids. CYP8B1, sterol 12-alpha-hydroxylase, initiates
  the pathway toward the formation of cholic acid. In the acidic pathway, CYP27A1,
  sterol 27-hydroxylase, catalyzes the first step toward the formation of chenodeoxycholic
  acid. The primary bile acids are conjugated to the amino acids, glycine and taurine,
  prior to excretion into the biliary system.
