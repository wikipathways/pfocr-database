caption: 'Examples of network refinements and reannotations. (A) Both B. cenocepacia
  (BC) and B. multivorans (BM) genomes include genes that allow for the degradation
  of ectoine. BCAS0031 and Bmul_6140, the products of which are currently annotated
  as hypothetical proteins, were identified as orthologs of Helo_3661 in H. elongata,
  which encodes DoeD. (B) Curation of the tryptophan degradation pathway identified
  a gap for the essential reaction catalyzed by Kmo, which led to the addition of
  Kmo to both iBC and iBM without an assigned gene. The gene for HaaO was present
  only in B. cenocepacia and allows for the synthesis of quinolinate. (C) B. cenocepacia
  has the rhlABC genes necessary for rhamnolipid synthesis, while B. multivorans does
  not. Abbreviations: DoeA, ectoine hydrolase; DoeB, N-α-acetyl-l-2,4-diaminobutyric
  acid deacetylase; DoeC, aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; DoeD, diaminobutyric
  acid transaminase; KynA, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.11); KynB, kynurenine
  formamidase (EC 3.5.1.9); KynU, kynureninase (EC 3.7.1.3); Kmo, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase
  (EC 1.14.13.9); HaaO, 3-hydroxyanthranilate-3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.6); RhlA,
  rhamnosyltransferase chain A; RhlB, rhamnosyltransferase chain B; RhlC, rhamnosyltransferase
