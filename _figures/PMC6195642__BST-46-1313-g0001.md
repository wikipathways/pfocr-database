caption: Summary of downstream signalling from the BCR and growth factor receptors
  (GF-R) is shown. Activation of these receptors results in phosphorylation and activation
  of Akt, which leads to the activation of mTORC1 (PRAS40, RAPTOR), thereby initiating
  cell processes such as protein synthesis and proliferation. The downstream target
  of mTORC1, S6K negatively regulates mTORC2 (PROTOR1/2, mSIN1, RICTOR), which is
  responsible for the activation of Akt. This creates a negative feedback loop, which
  regulates this pathway. mTORC1 and mTORC2 share the subunits mTOR, GβL, DEPTOR and
  Tti1/Tel2 (not shown). Akt negatively phosphorylates FOXO1/3, which regulates the
  cell cycle. Kinases such as AMPK are activated in stress responses and inhibit the
  mTORC1 pathway. Allosteric inhibitors such as rapamycin and other rapalogs partially
  inhibit mTORC1 activity, whereas ATP competitive inhibitors such as AZD2014 are
  pan mTOR inhibitors. All inhibitory and non-inhibitory signalling is represented
  in blue and green, respectively. PLC, phospholipase C; BLNK, B cell linker; BTK,
  Bruton tyrosine kinase.
