caption: Diagram of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication cycle. Attachment to the sodium
  taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) receptor, and possibly other receptors
  too, is the initiating event of infection (1); After uncoating and nuclear translocation
  of the capsid, relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) is delivered to the nucleus (2); rcDNA
  is then repaired to form covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) (3); which is the
  template for transcription of viral RNA (4); Viral mRNA is translated (5); The pre-genomic
  RNA (pgRNA) is then packaged into capsid particles together with the viral Pol (6);
  The pgRNA is reverse transcribed in the nucleocapsid (7); And the viral particles
  are secreted via the endoplasmic reticulum (8). Sites of action of licensed and
  potentially therapeutic agents are indicated in red text. Viral cccDNA may be disabled
  by methods that employ gene editing. Exogenous activators of the RNA interference
  (RNAi) pathway may be employed to inactivate viral RNA. Nucleoside and nucleotide
  analogues, which are currently licensed drugs, may be used to inhibit reverse transcription
  of pgRNA.
