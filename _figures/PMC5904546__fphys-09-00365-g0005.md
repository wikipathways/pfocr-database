caption: Comparative analysis of differentially expressed proteomic and differentially
  regulated metabolomic data. (A) Differentially expressed upregulated enzymes assigned
  to Fatty acid-β-oxidation pathway at 7 days (KEGG annotation), as indicated, (B)
  The same pathway was pinpointed with altered differential regulations of various
  metabolites, encompassing specifically Fatty acid metabolism (Acyl carnitine) and
  Medium Chain fatty acid functional modules. (C) The differentially regulated metabolites
  are indicated in subnetworks shown in rectangles on the right.
