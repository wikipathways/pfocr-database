caption: Epigenetic modifications in the livers of male young adult IUGR-N mice. (A)
  The four statistical analysis approaches indicated overlapping significant differential
  H3K4me3 peaks (adjusted p value < 0.05) between the 3-month-old male IUGR-N and
  control mice (n = 5–6 per group) as revealed by ChIP sequencing. Statistically significant
  differential peaks common to Trended_edgeR and DESeq2 (5490 peaks) were conserved
  for further analysis. (B) The heatmap of differential H3K4me3 peaks showed that
  the male controls (blue group) and IUGR-N (pink group) mice were segregated. (C)
  Protein interactions with high confidence illustrated with the STRING database for
  the subset of genes displaying differential enrichment (>1.5-fold) between the IUGR-N
  and control groups. Each node corresponds to one protein, and relevant connections
  are illustrated with connecting lines. The red core indicates proteins related to
  pathways in cancer, the blue core denotes insulin signaling pathway proteins, the
  yellow core represents axon guidance proteins, and the green core demonstrates Fc
  epsilon RI-mediated signaling pathway proteins according to the KEGG pathway analysis
  with the STRING database. The green circles indicate greater enrichment in the H3K4me3
  mark in the IUGR-N group and the red circles indicate higher enrichment in the control
  group.
