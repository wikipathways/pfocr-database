caption: Mitochondrial stress responses in cystic fibrosis. Schematic representation
  of mitochondrial stress response pathways in healthy and in CF. In healthy condition,
  compensatory mitochondrial stress responses are transiently triggered to restore
  the mitochondrial homeostasis during P. aeruginosa infection. Damaged mitochondrial
  portions are removed by mitophagy, where the PINK1-Parkin signaling pathway promotes
  ubiquitination of OMM proteins while the mitophagic receptors, optineurin (OPN)
  and NDP52, act as adaptors to recruit autophagosomal membranes to mitochondria,
  interacting with LC3. In CF, defective mitophagy leads to dysfunctional mitochondria
  accumulation with consequent release of mitochondrial DAMPs, which contribute to
  hyper-inflammatory responses in CF airway cells during the persistent P. aeruginosa
  infection. The mammalian UPRmt is regulated by the transcription factors ATF5, which
  in healthy condition is imported into mitochondria to be degraded. In CF, the persistent
  mitochondrial stress in airway cells induces abnormal UPRmt activation with consequent
  nuclear translocation of ATF5, which supports the regulation of innate immunity
  response during pathogen infection. At front of the mitochondrial Ca2+-overload,
  a higher susceptibility to irreversible damages in response to pathogen infection
  occur in CF airway cells, contributing to promote organelle dysfunction and cell
  death. In CF, the exacerbation of inflammatory environment is due also by mtDAMPs
  release and by accumulation of phagocyte cells that intervene to scavenge the dying
  cells and pathogens. PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK-1); Microtubule-associated proteins
