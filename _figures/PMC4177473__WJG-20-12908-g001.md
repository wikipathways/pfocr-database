caption: 'S-adenosylmethionine is produced from methionine by methionine adenosyltransferase.
  After donating its methyl group, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH), which is then converted to adenosine and homocysteine by S-adenosylhomocysteine
  hydrolase (SAHH). Homocysteine is used to regenerate methionine or to produce glutathione
  (GSH). The vitamin B6 dependent transsulfuration pathway produces GSH via reduction
  of homocysteine to cystathionine using cystathionine beta synthase (CβS), which
  can then be further metabolized to cysteine and GSH. Regeneration of methionine
  from homocysteine occurs by two pathways. The folate-dependent pathway regenerates
  methionine from homocysteine via transfer of a methyl group from N5-methyltetrahydrofolate
  (MTHF) to vitamin B12, which is then transferred to homocysteine by methionine synthase
  (MS) to form methionine. The second pathway is folate independent and uses betaine
  as a substrate for methionine synthesis from homocysteine via betaine homocysteine
  methyltransferase (BHMT). Alcohol may affect methionine metabolism via three mechanisms:
  alcohol inhibits MS, alcohol increases BHMT as a compensatory effect and alcohol
  may inhibit MAT activity, but this is still controversial.'
