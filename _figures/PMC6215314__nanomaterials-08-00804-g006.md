caption: 'Illustration of heterogeneous cancer death induced by dihydroartemisinin
  plus epirubicin liposomes through autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis. The nanostructured
  dihydroartemisinin plus epirubicin liposomes were internalized by cancer cells,
  escaped from the lysosomes, and existed in two states: the raptured and intact liposomes.
  Drugs, which either are from the raptured liposomes or are released from the intact
  liposomes, come into play actions: 1, dihydroartemisinin interacts with the BH3
  domain of Bcl-2, thus suppressing the binding of Bcl-2 with Beclin 1, activating
  the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex to produce phosphatidylinositol
  3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) in promoting the excessive autophagy. 2, dihydroartemisinin
  suppresses the binding of Bcl-2 with Bax, which allows Bax to attach onto mitochondria,
  to activate upstream caspase 9 and afterwards downstream caspase 3 in initiating
  a cascade of apoptosis via the mitochondria pathway. 3, Epirubicin intercalates
  DNA strands, resulting in necrosis of cancer cells.'
