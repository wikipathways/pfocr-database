caption: 'Patritumab and HER3 signaling pathway. (A) Binding of the ligand heregulin
  to HER3 induces a conformational change that allows for receptor dimerization of
  HER3 with HER family receptors, such as EGFR or HER2. (B) Heterodimerization initiates
  the transphosphorylation of HER3 at specific tyrosine residues by the kinase of
  its heterodimeric partner. (C) The phosphorylated tyrosine kinase residues create
  6 direct docking sites for PI3K, leading to the activation of other molecules further
  downstream in the PI3K–Akt pathway. EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; HER:
  human epidermal growth factor receptor; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.'
