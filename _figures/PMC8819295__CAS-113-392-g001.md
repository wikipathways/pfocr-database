caption: The porphyrin biosynthesis pathway in the cancer cell. In tumor cells, ferrochelatase
  is inactive, and heme production from protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is suppressed. Furthermore,
  the activity of ABCG2 is downregulated, and the excretion of PpIX is suppressed.
  On the other hand, PpIX production is promoted in tumor cells due to the activation
  of the porphyrin synthetic enzyme and peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1). As a result,
  PpIX accumulates in excess in the mitochondria of tumor cells. The basic biological
  property of tumor cells to rely on anaerobic metabolism is common across all cancer
  types and is known as the Warburg effect
