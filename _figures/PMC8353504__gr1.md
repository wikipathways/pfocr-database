caption: 'Role of CPT1 isoforms in the regulation of food intake by fatty acids. When
  the AMPK pathway is activated by grhelin, the resulting decrease of malonyl-CoA
  levels relieves its inhibitory action on CPT1a, and therefore, favours FA oxidation
  in mitochondria. Decrease of malonyl-CoA also favours the entry of FA through CPT1c
  in ER and their metabolism into ceramide. Both the increase of FA mitochondrial
  oxidation and de novo ceramide synthesis stimulate the expression of orexigenic
  neuropeptides AgRP and NPY, which increased food intake. In contrast, the inhibition
  of AMPK by leptin results in the increase of malonyl-CoA levels, and inhibition
  of FA oxidation and ceramide synthesis, and therefore, decrease food intake. Red
  arrow: inhibition; blue arrow: stimulation. AMPK: AMP-dependent protein kinase;
  AgRP: agouti-related protein; CPT1: carnitine palmitoyl-transferase; ER: endoplasmic
  reticulum; FA: fatty acid; NPY: neuropeptide Y.'
