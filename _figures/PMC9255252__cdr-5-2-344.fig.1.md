caption: 'Intracellular signaling pathways dysregulated in AML LSCs, including agents
  recently used in clinical trials inhibiting pathway activity. (A) JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway. Therapeutic agents either target elevated JAK1/2 levels or constitutively
  active STAT3. (B) NF-κB signaling pathway. Therapeutic agents recently used in clinical
  trials directly inhibit the constitutively activated NF-κB. (C) Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. Therapeutic targets prevent constitutive activation by inhibiting the interaction
  between β-catenin and CBP or TCF. (D) Hh signaling pathway. Small molecule inhibitors
  target Smoothened (Smo), decreasing pathway activation. (E) Notch signaling pathway.
  There are currently no clinical trials inhibiting or activating the Notch pathway
  as a treatment in AML patients. Created with BioRender.com. AML: Acute myeloid leukemia;
  LSCs: leukemic stem cells; JAK/STAT: Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; NF-κB: nuclear factor-kappa B; CBP: CREB-binding protein; TCF:
  T-cell factor; Hh: Hedgehog.'
