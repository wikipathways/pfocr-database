caption: 'Schematic representation of the intracellular signaling pathways modulated
  by somatostatin receptors. Antiproliferative effects of somatostatin (SST) and its
  analogs; SST and analogs binding to SST receptors activate different phosphotyrosine
  phosphatases (PTPs) SHP-1 and SHP-2 and PTPη. Activated SHP-1 triggers intracellular
  proapoptoptic signals involving the induction of caspase activation and p53/Bax.
  SHP-1 also cause apoptosis by activation of the transcription factor NF-κB leading
  to the inhibition of the MAP kinase JNK anti-apoptotic effects. SHP-2 activates
  Src that directly interacts with PTPη inducing its phosphorylation in tyrosine and
  activation. PTPη dephosphorylates intracellular effectors involved in the control
  of cell cycle progression, such as the ERK and the PI3K/Akt pathways, causing the
  upregulation of the cyclin kinase inhibitors p21cip1/waf1   and p27kip1 and the
  tumor suppressor gene Zac1. As a result, cells accumulate in G1 phase without entering
  S-phase and cell proliferation is blocked. Antisecretory effects of SST and its
  analogs; SST inhibits the secretion/synthesis of many hormones through the inhibition
  of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and activation of K+ channels, decreasing intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration, and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, lowering intracellular cAMP
  levels. Activated pathway: green arrows; inhibited pathway: red arrows.'
