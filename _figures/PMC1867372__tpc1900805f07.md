caption: Possible Roles of MPK6 Signaling in Arabidopsis.At least three cascades,
  MKK2–MPK6, MKK4/MKK5–MPK6, and MKK3–MPK6, function in Arabidopsis. Each plays a
  specific role in response to different stimuli, and the cascades transduce their
  signals to adapt to various environmental changes by crosstalking with each other.
  The MKK2–MPK6 cascade regulates cold and salt stress-responsive genes, the MKK4/MKK5–MPK6
  cascade regulates pathogen-responsive genes by activating ET biosynthesis, and the
  novel MKK3–MPK6 cascade regulates JA signaling. The JA-activated MKK3–MPK6 signal
  negatively regulates the JA pathway and affects JA-dependent gene expression and
  root growth sensitivity through ATMYC2.

  Part of the Jasmonate Signal Transduction Pathway in Arabidopsis.
