caption: Possible mechanisms for the synergistic immune stimulation of TLR2 and NOD2
  ligands. Stimulation with di- and triacylated Lpp triggers the TLR2-MyD88-dependent
  signaling pathway, resulting in NF-κB activation and induction of proinflammatory
  cytokines. The latter, particularly TNF-α, upregulate NOD expression as well as
  oligopeptide transporters, e.g., hPepT1 and SCL15A4, that also transport NOD agonists.
  PGN is also taken up in an endocytosis-like process, from where it can be translocated
  into cytoplasm by the endosomal transporter SCL15A4. How NODs are recruited to the
  plasma membrane is unknown. Lpp not only act as TLR2 agonists but are also able
  to cause membrane scrambling; whether this effect contributes to signaling or to
  facilitating PGN uptake is unknown. Both TLR2 and NOD activation lead finally to
  NF-κB activation, but the downstream adaptor molecules, RIP2 and MyD88, are different,
  thus excluding competition for a common adaptor protein and allowing synergistic
  NF-κB activation. PGN, peptidoglycan; Lpp, lipoproteins/lipopeptides; MyD88, myeloid
  differentiation primary response protein 88; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain
  enhancer; NOD, nucleotide binding oligomerization domain-containing protein; RIP2,
  receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2.
