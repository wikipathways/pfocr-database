caption: Working model of the mechanisms whereby PS-1 mutations render neurons vulnerable
  to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. PS-1 is localized in the ER. PS-1 mutations
  perturb ER calcium homeostasis in a manner that enhances calcium release when cells
  are exposed to various potentially toxic environmental signals (e.g., glutamate,
  amyloid β-peptide, or agonists that activate the IP3pathway). When mitochondrial
  electron transport is uncoupled, as in cells exposed to the irreversible succinate
  dehydrogenase inhibitor 3-NP, calcium efflux from the mitochondria occurs followed
  by ATP depletion. The elevation of [Ca2+]i in response to mitochondrial impairment
  is exacerbated in cells expressing mutant PS-1. High cytoplasmic calcium levels
  promote the production of intramitochondrial and extramitochondrial ROS that damage
  mitochondrial membranes and proteins resulting in membrane depolarization (Δ¥) and
  permeability transition (MPT). These mitochondrial alterations result in the release
  of apoptotic factors (AFs) from mitochondria that then promote nuclear apoptosis.
  The increased [Ca2+]i and oxidative stress in cells expressing mutant PS-1 may also
  promote aberrant processing of APP resulting in increased production of amyloidogenic
  forms of Aβ. Aβ, in turn, may perpetuate a vicious neurodegenerative cascade by
  inducing oxidative stress, disrupting cellular ion homeostasis and further impairing
  mitochondrial function. See Discussion for further details and references supporting
  different aspects of this model.
