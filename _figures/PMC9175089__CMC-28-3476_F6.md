caption: Cellular processes inhibited by the PCAIs suggest interactions with receptor
  tyrosine kinase (RTKs) signal transduction pathway intermediates. Polyisoprenylated
  proteins (blue circles) are the most likely direct targets of the PCAIs as they
  are depleted from cancer cells treated with the analogs. Fascin and vinculin that
  contribute to the formation of focal adhesion complexes are also depleted. In combination
  with the inhibition of F-actin, processes that depend on the filamentous actin cytoskeleton
  and focal adhesion, such as cell migration and angiogenesis, are largely abolished
  at low to submicromolar concentrations of the PCAIs. Cancers with such drivers as
  the growth factors EGF and VEGF and the RTKs, which occur upstream of the polyisoprenylated
  proteins, are also prone to inhibition by virtue of their dependence on the G-proteins
  as signaling mediators. (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure is
  available in the electronic copy of the article).
