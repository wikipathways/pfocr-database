caption: 'Cu homeostasis in the brain and its redox control. Regulation of Cu homeostasis
  is a complex process requiring intercommunication between endothelial cells of the
  BBB, astrocytes, and neurons. These three types of cells have the same protein machinery
  as other mammalian cells: CTR1 and DMT1 for Cu uptake; Atox1, CCS1, and GSH for
  Cu delivery to ATP7(A/B), SOD3, and MT, respectively; COX17 and COX19 for Cu delivery
  to mitochondria, where SCO1, SCO2, and COX11 load Cu into COX; while ATP7 (A/B)
  participates in Cu export through the secretory pathway (a–c). (a) Cp- and albumin-
  bound Cu enters into the brain by crossing endothelial cells of BBB, which are in
  tight communication with astrocytes. (b) Astrocytes serve as an interface to deliver
  Cu to (c) neurons. (d) Recently, a redox control of Cu efflux was elucidated in
  neurons during differentiation: the redox state of Atox1 controls Cu delivery to
  the secretory pathway. ATP7A, ATPase copper transporting alpha; ATP7B, ATPase copper
  transporting beta; Atox1, antioxidant protein 1; BBB, blood-brain barrier; CCS1,
