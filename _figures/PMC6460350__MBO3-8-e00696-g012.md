caption: Models of glucose utilization at the T. hominis–host cell interface. In the
  simplest scenario (left), glucose is metabolized by secreted HKs as part of a locally
  enhanced glycolysis. The ATP molecules generated are taken up into parasites through
  nucleotide transporters (Heinz et al., ). An alternative scheme (right) accounts
  for the consistent and intimate relationship of host ER with the parasite coat and
  suggests a more complex model for glucose dynamics. Glucose diffuses into the host
  cytoplasm and further to the vicinity of the parasite. PQM hexokinases then generate
  G6P, which is taken up into the ER lumen by transporters present in the ER membrane
  (G6P/Pi antiporter) and concentrates there. Gluconeogenesis pathways then generate
  glucose and Pi that are transported out of the ER. This cycle could then increase
  the concentration of glucose locally for the parasite, either for further entry
  into a cell surface glycolytic pathway for energy generation (described above) or
  for direct glucose uptake into the parasite for its own cytosolic glycolysis
