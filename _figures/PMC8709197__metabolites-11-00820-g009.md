caption: 'A postulated overview of Si-mitigated alleviation of salt stress effects
  on tomato plants via modulation of the primary and secondary metabolic pathways.
  (A) Scheme portraying the detrimental effects of salt stress on a plant. Excess
  accumulation of Na+ and Cl− ions in the soil, hence an increased absorption causes
  an imbalance in the uptake of other ions, water and nutrients. Subsequent ionic
  and osmotic stresses enhance synthesis of ROS, resultant in oxidative damage of
  macromolecules and photosynthetic equipment. (B) Si-based biostimulant treatment
  of the salt-stressed plants leads to modifications in the slightly overlapping primary
  (red) and secondary (blue) metabolic pathways for a coherent defence response. Upregulation
  of these pathways result in accumulation of osmolytes, enhanced synthesis of enzymatic
  and non-enzymatic antioxidants, ROS detoxification and repair of the salt-stress
  induced oxidative damage. Coherent activities of the Si-enhanced defence responses
  ultimately lead to conferred salt stress tolerance in plants (C). Primary metabolic
  pathways (blue): glycolysis (1), pentose phosphate pathway (2), tricarboxylic acid
  cycle (3), amino acid biosynthesis pathways (4) and the secondary metabolic pathways
  (red): including shikimate pathway (5), phenylpropanoid pathway (6, 7) and flavone
  and flavonol biosynthesis pathways (8). Abbreviations: G6P, Glucose-6-phosphate;
  EryP, Erythrose phosphate; PEP, Phosphoenol pyruvate.'
