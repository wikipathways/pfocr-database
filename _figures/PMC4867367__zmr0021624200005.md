caption: Cross talk of GR with the STAT signaling pathway. Binding of GR to DNA-bound
  STAT3 suppresses the transcriptional activity of STAT3. However, STAT3 acts as a
  coactivator for DNA-bound GR, enabling the recruitment of additional coactivators.
  Simultaneous binding of GR and STAT3 on composite elements leads to synergism. The
  synergism between STAT5 and GR enhances the expression of TLR2. STAT5 binding to
  DNA-bound GR may lead to either transcriptional repression or activation of GR target
  genes. GR enhances the transcriptional activity of STAT5 on the β-casein promoter.
