caption: Illustration showing different mechanisms underlying diabetic retinopathy.
  During hyperglycemia, the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  via polyol pathway, advanced glycation end product (AGE) pathway, and protein kinase
  C (PKC) pathway can lead to the development of local inflammation and cell death.
  This vicious cycle increases vascular permeability, neural dysfunction, retinal
  hypoxia, and neovascularization. Neurodegeneration, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction
  operate in parallel and closely, which ultimately leads to the development of diabetic
  retinopathy.
