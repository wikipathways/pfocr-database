caption: Proposed model for rice tapetum-related gene regulatory network. In the genetic
  pathway of the rice tapetal layer, the oval circles represent transcription factors.
  The genes in the box represent downstream enzymes. The black arrows represent positive
  regulation, and the black dots represent lipid synthesis in tapetal cells. This
  model indicates that OsMS188 acts as a core hub to modulate tapetum development
  and pollen wall and cuticle formation. C, cuticle; E, epidermis; En, endothecium;
