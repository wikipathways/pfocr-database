caption: Overview of metabolic changes in C. thermocellum ΔhydGΔech . When hydrogenases
  were inactivated (red X), flux to ethanol increased. Further, the alcohol dehydrogenase
  mutated, allowing use of NADPH as a cofactor for ethanol production (red pathway).
  Simultaneously, fluxes to H2, lactate, and acetate decreased or were eliminated
  (gray pathways).

  increases ethanol yield in Clostridium thermocellum.
