caption: Schematic diagram of the potential mechanism by which viridicatol (VDC),
  derived from deep‐sea fungus, enhances osteoblastogenesis through modulation of
  the Wnt/SHN3 signaling pathway. Bone‐targeting nanovesicles (BT‐NVs) were engineered
  from MC3T3‐E1 cells using a multi‐step process, including ultrasonic lysis, density
  gradient centrifugation, and hydrophobic surface modification. VDC was subsequently
  loaded into BT‐NVs via ultrasonic encapsulation, improving targeted delivery to
  osteoblasts. Once delivered, VDC enhances osteogenic activity by regulating key
  mediator SHN3 in the Wnt signaling pathway, manifested by promoting the expression
  of key genes involved in osteogenic differentiation, such as upregulating the expression
  of alkaline phosphatase (Alpl), Runt‐related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), Osterix
  (SP7), Integrin binding sialoprotein (Ibsp), Osteocalcin (Bglap), and downregulating
  the expression of human immunodeficiency virus type I enhancer binding protein 3
  (Hivep3), ultimately promoting bone formation. This innovative approach holds significant
  promise for treating osteoporosis, facilitating fracture repair, and addressing
  osteogenesis imperfecta
