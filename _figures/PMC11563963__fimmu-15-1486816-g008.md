caption: Antiviral mechanism of miR-130c-5p for SHVV infection. When SHVV invades
  cells, miR-130c-5p directly targets the viral n-gene to inhibit its replication;
  miR-130c-5p can activate TLRs and NLRs signaling pathways, mainly by inducing the
  expression of MyD88 and NLRC3, activating the NF-κB signaling pathway, up-regulating
  the key immune factors, such as IL-6, IL-22, and IL-1β, and significantly enhancing
  the host antiviral immune response; SHVV infection can activate the above signaling
  pathways to participate in the host antiviral immune response
