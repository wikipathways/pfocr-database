caption: Proposed AI-2 signaling with QS regulators LsrR and LsrK. During early and
  mid-exponential phases, AI-2 levels are low, insufficient for triggering rapid uptake.
  LsrR binds and represses many genes including lsr genes. As AI-2 accumulates extracellularly,
  it begins to be transported into the cells via a non-Lsr pathway or otherwise accumulates
  within the cells (or other pre-AI-2 anomers), which then bind to LsrR and derepress
  many QS genes including lsrR, flu, wza, and dsrA (crescents represent sRNA). Lsr-mediated
  AI-2 uptake remains repressed, as its derepression is due to phospho-AI-2. This
  temporal model is consistent with the activation of QS phenotypes that are switched
  on in late exponential phase. Finally, when the AI-2 concentration reaches the uptake
  “threshold” and cells sense nutrient depletion, lsr rapidly imports AI-2. Thereafter,
  cells phosphorylate the imported AI-2 signal, which results in the cessation of
  the LsrR/AI-2 regulation and amplification of LsrR/phopho-AI-2 regulation. Hence,
  a rapid QS switch is manifested by a change in the phosphorylation state of AI-2
  and its binding to LsrR.
