caption: . The mechanism of up-regulation of RIP1 phosphorylation and LC-3II in z-VAD-FMK-induced
  photoreceptor necroptosis. When cells undergo tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced
  apoptosis, RIP1 phosphorylation is inactivated by caspase-8. Caspase inhibitor,
  z-VAD-FMK, can switch the death receptor induced apoptotic response to necroptosis
  by inhibition caspases-8 activation and up-regulation RIP1 phosphorylation. Then
  RIP1 phosphorylation can induce the activation of autophagy marker LC-3II by a currently
  unknown pathway.
