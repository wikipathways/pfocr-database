caption: 'Gene expression pattern for Suc metabolism. a Schematic Suc metabolic pathways
  in oil-rich tubers of Cyperus esculentus. Enzyme or protein names are indicated
  in blue. For each enzyme or protein, the width of the arrow indicates the gene expression
  level (FPKM, average fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads).
  Black and purple arrows indicate respectively the common and different gene expression
  patterns in Cyperus esculentus tuber from those in other plant examined in this
  study. Transporter was marked by the black arrow across red oval. FPKM values of
  the different isoforms and/or subunits are average transcript levels. Red numbers
  in black bracket show the numbers of unigenes with more than 1 of FPKM for each
  enzyme or protein. Abbreviation: CIN, cytoplasmic invertase; CWIN, cell wall invertase;
  F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; FK, fructokinase; Fru, fructose; G1P, glucose-1-phosphate;
  G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; Glc, glucose; Hexose-P, hexose-phosphate; HT, hexose transporter;
  HXK, hexokinase; PD, plasmodesmata; PGI, phosphoglucoisomerase; PGM, phosphoglucomutase;
  S6P, succose-6-phosphate; SPP, sucrose-phosphatase.; SPS, sucrose-phosphate synthase;
  Suc, sucrose; SUS, sucrose synthase; SUT, sucrose transporter; T6P, trehalose-6-phosphate;
  TPS, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; TST, tonoplast sucrose transporter; SWEET,
  Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporter (hexose and sucrose transporter);
  UDP-Glc, uridine diphosphate glucose; UGP, UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase; VIN, vacuolar
  invertase. b Expression levels for Suc metabolism genes. Left, The distribution
  of transcript contents among the three pathways. Right, FPKM per protein in each
  pathway. Without regard to separation of close paralogs or allelic transcripts,
  multiple protein isoforms or subunits of a multi-protein complex were considered
  as a single protein and their transcripts were summed (Additional file : Table S3)'
