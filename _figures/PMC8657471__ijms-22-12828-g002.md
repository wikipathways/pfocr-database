caption: The EGFR/ERBB signaling pathway mediated by EREG leads to the cancer development
  and distinct drug response. G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation induces
  the cleavage of transmembrane epiregulin (EREG) protein and then secretes mature
  EREG. Soluble EREG binds to ERBB, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  and ERBB4, which initiate the downstream signaling cascade, whereas the ligand protein
  is cleaved by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase enzyme (ADAM). The homodimerized
  or heterodimerized ERBB activate RAS (rat sarcoma)/RAF (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma)
  and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT (a serine/threonine
  protein kinase) signaling cascades and synergistically activate, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 signaling pathways, which then induced the
  upregulation of EREG downstream signaling pathways. Oncogenic mutations in EGFR,
  KRAS, or BRAF genes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells lead to the constitutive
  activation of the downstream signaling, which in turn upregulates EREG expression.
  Treatment with anti-EGFR antibodies, such as cetuximab or panitumumab, in patients
  with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with wild-type RAS improved patient outcomes.
  EREG overexpression was found in wild-type, mutant EGFR (mtEGFR), or mutant BRAF
  (mtBRAF) NSCLC cells that are sensitive to anti-EREG antibodies or an EGFR-tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI, gefitinib or erlotinib). EREG might diminish TKI-induced
  NSCLC cell apoptosis through EGFR/ERBB2 and AKT signaling pathways. However, the
  low-level expression of AREG and EREG in CRC cells indicates that tumors are less
  dependent on EGFR, which is particularly prone to cause EGFR inhibitors resistance.
  Aberrant genetic alterations, including mutant RAS (mtRAS) and mtBRAF in CRC, induce
  resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. Low EREG expression was caused by aberrant histone
  modification and DNA methylation in a subset of cancer patients, such as those with
  gastric cancer, which cause resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. The miR-186-3p/EREG
  axis as a key regulatory pathway can induce the Warburg effect through EGFR signal
  activation, thereby increasing the expression of glycolytic genes, including glucose
  transporter 3 (GLUT3), hexokinase 2 (HK2), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1)
  in breast cancer cells resistant to tamoxifen. In addition, Rab27b mediates radioresistance
  in highly malignant glioblastoma (GBM) cells through the EREG-mediated paracrine
  pathway.
