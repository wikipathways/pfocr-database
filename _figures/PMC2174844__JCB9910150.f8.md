caption: Model of the FN-dependent matrix survival pathway activated in primary RSF
  when serum is absent. FN supports the organization of a pro-survival signaling complex
  based on a FAK/Cas scaffold located at focal adhesion sites. Paxillin (Pax) is thought
  to participate in the binding of FAK to focal adhesion sites (). Cas is recruited
  to the survival complex via a FAK PR-1–Cas SH3 interaction. Matrix survival signaling
  also requires an intact Cas SD. FN-FAK–associated survival signals activate Ras,
  and are propagated further via a Rac1/Pak1/MKK4/JNK signaling module, with pJNK
  detected in focal contacts as well as in the nucleus. This pathway is distinct from
  the serum-dependent survival pathway that is activated when matrix is withdrawn.
  The latter pathway requires FAK, but it also requires PI3-kinase, whereas the FN-FAK
  pathway described herein does not.
