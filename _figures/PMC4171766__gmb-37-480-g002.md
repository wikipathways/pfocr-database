caption: Top networks observed in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). (A) Network based
  on skeletal and muscular system development and function, cellular assembly and
  organization, cellular growth and proliferation. (B) Network based on connective
  tissue disorders, inflammatory disease, skeletal and muscular disorders. (C) Network
  based on cellular development, digestive system development and function, and embryonic
  development. The 267 genes differentially expressed among CAF, N+ and BMMC, as well
  as the fold change of CAF/BMMC, were used as input data for this analysis. Small
  circles identify proteins that act as hubs to interconnect groups of proteins to
  create protein clusters in pathways. Proteins in red were more expressed in bone
  marrow mesenchymal cells, whereas proteins in green were less expressed in bone
  marrow mesenchymal cells. Solid lines represent direct relationships. Lines connecting
  the proteins indicate known interrelationships obtained from the IPA database.
