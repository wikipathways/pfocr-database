caption: 'Androgen synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme CYP17. Binding of androgens
  to AR causes dissociation from HSP and AR dimerization. AR dimers translocate to
  the nucleus, associate with coregulatory proteins, and initiate transcription. In
  TNBC, AR signaling promotes cancer progression, and this can be blocked at various
  stages with pharmacological inhibitors (yellow). Cross-talk between AR and other
  signaling pathways is being used to establish rational drug combinations that are
  currently being explored for their effectiveness. Interconnecting lines are indicative
  of overall effects, positive or negative, on pathway activation. Abbreviations:
  AKT, protein kinase B; AR, androgen receptor; CREB, cAMP response element-binding
  protein; CYP17, cytochrome P450 17; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; ERK,
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HSP, heat shock protein; JAK, Janus kinase;
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; STAT,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription; TNBC, triple-negative breast cancer'
