caption: 'The BRAF signaling pathway and targeted therapies in the BRAF pathway. Description:
  Binding of ligands to transmembrane receptors, such as FGFR or EGFR, leads to receptor
  dimerization and phosphorylation of kinases, which leads to the recruitment of growth
  factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) to the phosphorylated receptor. The attachment
  of Son of Sevenless (SOS—GTP exchange factor) to GRB2 enables the activation of
  RAS-GDP to RAS-GTP. The active form of RAS-GTP causes downstream activation of MAPK,
  PI3K, and other effector pathways. BRAF inhibitors in yellow box and MEK inhibitors
  in blue box inhibit BRAF and MEK substrates and inhibit downstream pathway activation'
