caption: The TP53BP1 (53BP1)-RIF1-shieldin signaling with the choice of DSBR pathway
  in G1. RIF1 with phosphorylated TP53BP1 and assisted by MAD2L2 and TPIP, inhibits
  accumulation of phosphorylated CtIP and BRCA1 at DSB sites, preventing their interaction
  with MRE11 and end resection, and as a consequence, inhibits HRR. Shieldin, represented
  here by the SDHLD1–SHLD2 complex, promotes NHEJ by interaction with NHEJ proteins
  (not shown). It may be also involved in CtIP/BRCA1 inhibition (not shown). The CST
  complex inhibits end resection and HRR downstream of shieldin, so does the ASTE
  complex. Phosphorylation is marked by only single phosphate residue (P). All abbreviations
  are defined in the main text.
