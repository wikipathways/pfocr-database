caption: The schema representing recently discovered signaling pathway that is disrupted
  in M146V-KI mouse model of AD. M146V mutation in presenilin 1 (PS) causes loss of
  ER Ca2+ leak function of PS, that leads to downregulation of neuronal store-operated
  Ca2+ entry mediated by STIM2-dependent nSOC channels. nSOC is necessary for the
  stability of mushroom spines that store memory. Reduced nSOC causes decrease in
  expression of CaMKII (well-studied “memory” molecule) []. Lowering of CaMKII activity
  could underlie impaired late form of LTP observed in KI mice []. Eventually this
  leads to mushroom spine loss and cognitive decline.
