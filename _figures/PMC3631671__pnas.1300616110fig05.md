caption: Networks of BCR-regulated genes in PtC+ and PtC− cells from spleens and peritoneal
  cavity. Ingenuity pathways analysis (IPA) software was used to analyze identified
  genes involved in the BCR signaling pathway that were differently expressed in peritoneal
  PtC+ and PtC− cells (Left, n = 451, >1.5×), and PtC+ cells isolated from spleen
  and peritoneum (Right, n = 272, >2×). Genes labeled in red and green were those
  identified as up- and down-regulated and other genes were those related to the regulated
  genes on the basis of the network analysis.
