caption: The TG2-containing adhesive/signaling complexes on the cell surface. Solid
  black lines indicate TG2-mediated activation of cytoplasmic targets by transmembrane
  signaling receptors. Dotted black line marks binding of activated PKCα to the integrin
  cytoplasmic tails that causes their redistribution on the cell surface. Dashed gray
  lines outline the activation of syndecan-2 by intracellular PKCα and syndecan-2-mediated
  activation of ROCK that induces stress fiber and focal adhesion formation. Dashed
  black line marks the nuclear translocation of β-catenin that leads to its complex
  formation with Tcf/Lef and activation of gene transcription. Curved black line indicates
  the principal pathway of surface TG2 internalization. Dashed double black line depicts
  the unknown pathway of GPR56-induced Gαq activation that inhibits tumor cell growth
  and metastasis.

  description: The TG2-containing adhesive/signaling complexes on the cell surface.
    Solid black lines indicate TG2-mediated activation of cytoplasmic targets by transmembrane
    signaling receptors. Dotted black line marks binding of activated PKCα to the
    integrin cytoplasmic tails that causes their redistribution on the cell surface.
    Dashed gray lines outline the activation of syndecan-2 by intracellular PKCα and
    syndecan-2-mediated activation of ROCK that induces stress fiber and focal adhesion
    formation. Dashed black line marks the nuclear translocation of β-catenin that
    leads to its complex formation with Tcf/Lef and activation of gene transcription.
    Curved black line indicates the principal pathway of surface TG2 internalization.
    Dashed double black line depicts the unknown pathway of GPR56-induced Gαq activation
    that inhibits tumor cell growth and metastasis.
