caption: A. HOTAIR acts as a scaffold by binding the PRC2 complex or LSD1/coREST/REST
  complex, leading to gene regulation via histone modifications. B. HOTAIR guides
  the PRC2 complex to epigenetically repress the HoxD10 locus, which reduces miR7
  as well. Reduction of miR7 releases inhibition of SETDB1, which promotes the EMT-related
  pathway. C. MALAT1 negatively controls CD133 transcription via HuR. D. MALAT1 assembles
  serine/arginine splicing factors (SF) mainly in the nuclear spectacle. Losing MALAT1
  leads SR proteins to be abnormally distributed and abnormally phosphorylated, interfering
  with proper mRNA processing. E. BCAR4 binds with SNIP1 and PNUTS, inducing gene
  transcription associated with migration. F. BCAR4 could be suppressed by LNA. G.
  H19 is the origin of miR675. MiR675 could positively feedback to increase H19 expression
  by the SLUG/E-cadherin pathway. Alternatively, miR675 protects EGFR by degrading
  two ubiquitin ligase E3s, facilitating cell proliferation and metastasis through
  the AKT/ERK pathway. H. SRA, as a scaffold, links different complexes to progestin-induced
  genes when the progestin receptor is not liganded by progestin. I. SRA mediates
  chromosome organization cooperating with CTCF, P68 and the cohesion complex. J.
  LINP1 binds Ku80 and DNA-PKcs as a scaffold, contributing to their function in repairing
  of DNA double strand breaks. This process also includes molecular Ku70. K. LINK-A
  interacted with both BRK and LRRK2. This complex transfers signal from EGFR:GPNMB
  heterodimer to nuclear by phosphorylating HIF1α.
