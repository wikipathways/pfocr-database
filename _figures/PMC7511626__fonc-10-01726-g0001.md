caption: Conflicting role of PD-1 and PD-L1 in cancer management. (A) In the classical
  understanding of PD-1/PD-L1 regulation, PD-1 expressed on mature cytotoxic T lymphocytes
  reduces anti-tumor cytotoxicity via binding to tumor PD-L1. Both PD-1/PD-L1 CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
  PD-1 knockdown and blockade in T cells result in higher anti-tumor cytotoxicity.
  (B) Recent reports show that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and/or silencing lead to PI3K/AKT
  and MEK/ERK1/2 pathway activation, thus inducing tumor growth and survival. The
  opposite effect is observed when PD-1/PD-L1 are found overexpressed in cancer cells.
