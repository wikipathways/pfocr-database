caption: Growth factors such as insulin activate mTORC1 through the PI3K-Akt pathway.
  Following activation by insulin, insulin receptors stimulate and activate IRS-bound
  PI3K. Activated PI3K converts PIP2 to PIP3 and subsequently binding of PIP3 recruits
  Akt to the plasma membrane. The binding of Akt to PIP3 allows PDK1 to bind with
  Akt and phosphorylate it at Thr-308. Activated Akt phosphorylates TSC2 at multiple
  sites and inhibits its GAP activity on Rheb. Following inhibition of TSC2, Rheb
  is converted into an active GTP-bound state and activates mTORC1. mTORC1 could also
  be activated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40, a component of mTORC1. In
  presence of amino acids, mTORC1 translocates to the lysosomal surface and activated
  by Rheb. Rag GTPases, which form heterodimeric complexes comprised of RagA or RagB
  bound to RagC or RagD, are critical for recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomal surface.
  GATOR1 acts as a GAP for RagA/B and inhibits the translocation of mTORC1 to lysosome.
  GATOR2 acts as an upstream inhibitor of GATOR1 and subsequently facilitates mTORC1
  activation through Rag heterodimers. CASTOR1 homodimer and Sestrin2 are negative
  regulators of GATOR2. Sestrin2 binds to GATOR2 and inhibits mTORC1 activation. Following
  binding of leucine to Sestrin2, GATOR2 dissociates from Sestrin2. Similarly, CASTOR1
  homodimers bind to GATOR2 thus exerting an inhibitory effect. Arginine binds to
  CASTOR1 homodimers and dissociates it from GATOR. Following its dissociation from
  inhibitory regulators, GATOR2 inhibits GATOR1 activity and facilitates mTORC1 activation.
  Glutamine regulates mTORC1 translocation through Arf1 GTPases, a process which is
  independent of the Rag GTPases. In response to low cellular energy level, AMPK inhibits
  mTORC1 pathway to limit energy consumption as well as to facilitate recovery of
  cellular energy materials. AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 at Ser-1387 and activates its
  GAP activity, which subsequently converts Rheb into an inactive GDP-bound state.
  AMPK also phosphorylates Raptor at Ser-722 and Ser-792, which results in binding
  of 14-3-3 protein to Raptor and subsequent inactivation of mTORC1. Conversely, a
  high cellular ATP level inhibits activation of AMPK by AMP, which results in withdrawal
  of AMPK-mediated inhibitory signals on mTORC1 activation. Activated mTORC1 regulates
  the activity of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 by phosphorylating them. Following its activation,
  S6K1 phosphorylates multiple substrates including RPS6, eEF2K, SKAR, eIF4B and PDCD4.
