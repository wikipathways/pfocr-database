caption: (A) Reported scheme of A2AR agonist promoting Aβ production. Agonist binding
  to the receptor activates Gs protein leading to the activation of cAMP/PKA signal
  pathway. The elevated cAMP promotes APP expression and γ-secretase activity resulting
  into increased Aβ generation. (B) A scheme of A2AR antagonist-modulating Aβ generation
  revealed by our study. A2AR forms a complex with γ-secretase complex composed of
  PS1 (blue), APH1 (red), NCT (orange) and Pen2 (dark blue), and binds with PS1-CTF,
  restraining γ-secretase activity for Aβ production. Antagonist binding-induced conformational
  change of A2AR may attenuate the association with γ-secretase complex resulting
  in a “condensed” state of PS1, favoring Aβ generation.
