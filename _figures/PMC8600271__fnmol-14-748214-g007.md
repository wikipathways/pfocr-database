caption: A working model of intensity-dependent olfactory encoding in C. elegans.
  In this model, different receptors (GPCRs) with different affinities are expressed
  in olfactory neurons. Gα proteins ODR-3 and GPA-3 are differentially associated
  with the receptors. The CNG channel TAX-2/TAX-4 is constantly open in resting state
  in AWB and AWC neurons. In AWC neurons, binding of IAA to its receptor mainly activates
  Gα ODR-3, thereby inhibiting the activity of membrane GCs ODR-1/DAF-11. Consequentially,
  cGMP synthesis is reduced, thereby closing cGMP-gated CNG channel TAX-2/TAX-4 and
  hyperpolarizing AWC. PDEs set the basal level of cGMP in AWC and modulate the kinetics
  of IAA-induced response. Removal of IAA relieves the inhibition of GCs and leads
  to depolarization of AWC. In AWB neurons, low concentrations of IAA may bind to
  a high affinity IAA receptor, which is associated with Gα GPA-3, thereby inhibiting
  PDEs and increasing cGMP. Thus, more CNG channels open and AWB neurons get depolarized.
  High concentrations of IAA may bind to both high and low affinity IAA receptors.
  When Gα ODR-3-associated low affinity receptor is activated, the activity of membrane
  GCs are inhibited, thereby hyperpolarizing AWB via a pathway similar to that in
  AWC. In addition, a high affinity IAA receptor and a low affinity IAA receptor are
  likely expressed in AWA and ASH neurons, respectively, which are associated with
  ODR-3. Activation of ODR-3 leads to closure of TRPV channel OSM-9, thereby depolarizing
  and activating AWA and ASH neurons. Note that the IAA receptors expressed in AWB,
  AWC, ASH and AWA neurons may be different.
