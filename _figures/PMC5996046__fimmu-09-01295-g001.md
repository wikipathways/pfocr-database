caption: Interaction between elements of purinergic signaling and activation of the
  complement cascade (ComC) in the induction of sterile inflammation in bone marrow
  (BM). Stimulatory factors released during tissue/organ injury, systemic mediators
  of inflammation, and pharmacological inducers of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
  (HSPC) mobilization activate Gr-1+ leukocytes in BM to release danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMP) molecules, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a DAMP molecule, ATP is recognized by MBL, which
  activates the ComC and CoaC in an MASP-dependent manner (indicated on a graph as
  1). By contrast, ROS exposes neoepitopes, and neoepitope–IgM complexes are also
  recognized by mannan-binding lectin (MBL). This leads to activation of the ComC
  by the MBL-dependent pathway. Both classical C5 convertase, as a product of C3 cleavage,
  and C5-like convertase activity, provided by thrombin cleaving C5 to release cleavage
  fragments C5a and desArgC5a, are crucial in the egress of HSPCs from BM. In addition
  to serving as a DAMP (indicated on a graph as 2), ATP also activates purinergic
  receptors expressed on the surface of HSPCs, in which P2X7 plays an important role
  in promoting calcium influx into cells (indicated on a graph as 2). This facilitates
  intracellular actin fiber rearrangement that is crucial in cell migration and egress
  from BM.
