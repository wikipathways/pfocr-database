caption: Mast cells (MCs) respond to a wide range of pathologic and environmental
  stimuli owing to the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors
  (NLRs), and RIG-1-like receptors (RLRs). TLR-1, -2, -4, -5, and -6 respond to extracellular
  ligands mainly cell wall components of bacteria. Moreover, expression of endosomal
  TLRs including TLR-3, -7, -8, and -9 by MCs enables them to respond to intracellular
  pathogens including viruses. The expression of receptors for cytokines forms a complicated
  cytokine network around MCs and plays an important role in MC-immune cells cell-talk.
  Additionally, MCs express a variety of CCR and CXCR chemokine receptors by which
  respond to chemokines. IgE/FcεRI signaling has the central role in the degranulation
  of MCs in response to the allergen. Crosslinking of FcεRI by allergen bounded IgE
  triggers the signaling pathway and engaging intracellular signaling molecules including
  Lyn and SYK. Activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) results in the formation of second
  messengers including “diacylglycerol” (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)
  and the influx of calcium that induces the degranulation. The consequence of IgE/FcεRI
  signaling is releasing various mediators including preformed, de novo synthesized,
  and cytokines
