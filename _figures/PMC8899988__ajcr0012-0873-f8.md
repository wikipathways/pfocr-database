caption: The binding motif of transcription factors, TEAD1, p53 and Sp1 found in the
  promoter regions of TP53, TEAD1, KIF18A and TUBA1B genes. The promoter region of
  p53 has three different binding motifs for TEAD1 (CATTCCA), p53 (ACTTGC) and Sp1
  (GGGCGG). The binding motif sequences, TEAD1 (CATTCCT), p53 (GCTAGC) and Sp1 (GGGCGG)
  are found on the promoter region of TEAD1. The promoter region of KIF18A has two
  binding motifs, TEAD1 (CATGCA) and p53 (ACATGC). TUBA1B has TEAD1 (CATTCCC) and
  p53 (ACTAGT) binding motifs on its promoter region.
