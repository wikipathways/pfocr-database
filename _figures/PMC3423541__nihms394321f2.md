caption: Biological targets under investigation for treatment of SLE. Depletion of
  autoreactive B cells is achieved by treatment with monoclonal antibodies against
  CD20 and CD22. CD22 also depletes plasma cells, which can also be targeted through
  blockade of isotype-switching by proteasome inhibition or anti-IFNα antibodies.
  Activation of lupus B cells can be inhibited by targeting survival (BAFF targeted
  by Belimumab, APRIL targeted by TACI-Ig) and co-stimulatory signals. Lupus T cell
  activation is targeted by blockade of cytokine action (IL-6, IL-1, and IL-10), cytokine
  production (IL-17), and co-stimulation (CD28-B7 interaction by CTLA-4 Ig, ICOS-ICOS
  ligand interaction by anti-B7RP-1 antibodies).Activation of SLE T and B cells results
  in a rise of cellular Ca2+, which results from mitochondrial dysfunction, mTOR activation,
  and endocytic pathway activation. Intracellular Ca2+ can be modulated by treatment
  with calcium calmodulin kinase inhibitors, calcineurin inhibitors, and anti-PI3Kγ.
  Early endosome and mTOR activation in SLE T and B cells are inhibited with anti-malarials
  and rapamycin. Autophagy in SLE lymphocytes can be reduced by treatment with P140
  peptide and anti-malarial drugs.Of these targets, antimalarial drugs and Belimumab
  have been FDA-approved for SLE disease management. The other targets mentioned are
  under intensive investigation in pre-clinical and clinical studies.
