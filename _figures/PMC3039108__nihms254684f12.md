caption: 'Model diagrams outlining potential brain substrates and mechanisms that
  underlie sickness behavior in response to systemic inflammatory insult (LPS challenge).
  Panel A depicts the two parallel pathways arising in the caudal brainstem: one non-catecholaminergic
  that involves the PBel, CEA, and BSTov (in blue), and a catecholaminergic (noradrenergic
  and adrenergic) pathway aimed at the PVN with collaterals aimed at other regions
  (in red). The latter involves some of the brain regions that show inhibition of
  c-Fos expression such as the LH/PF, TMV, and VTA. Inhibition of c-Fos expression
  (indicated with lighter grey dots) also occurs in the caudate putamen (CPu) and
  hippocampus (HPC). Suppressed neuronal activity in all these regions may underlie
  the illness-associated reduced behavioral activity in the exploration task. Panel
  B shows the effect of DSAP lesion that destroys the ascending catecholaminergic
  pathway with loss of noradrenergic and adrenergic cell bodies in the NTS and VLM
  (indicated with red dots). This lesion results in suppression of LPS-induced activation
  in the PVN (light grey dots in B) and the prevention of suppression of behavioral
  task-related neuronal activation in LH/PF, TMV, VTA, CPu and HPC (indicated with
  black dots in B). Unlike after DVC inactivation that blunted the response of the
  non-catecholaminergic PBel-CEA-BSTov pathway to LPS, DSAP lesion did not affect
  the response to LPS by this latter pathway, which therefore does not seem to mediate
  behavioral inhibition.'
