caption: Proposed model illustrating 1O2-triggered EX1-independent and EX1-dependent
  chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling pathways. Under severe light stress,
  β-carotene from PSII RC enriched in grana core acts as a sensor of 1O2 generated
  by the excited triplet P680 chlorophyll (3P680∗) through the energy transfer from
  3P680∗ to stable oxygen molecule (3O2). The subsequent oxidation of β-carotene (β-carotene∗)
  by 1O2 concomitantly release β-CC, a volatile oxidized derivative, which functions
  as a messenger involved in the 1O2signaling pathway. MBS1 protein, a zinc finger
  protein located in cytoplasm and nucleus, acts downstream of β-CC. In grana margin,
  EX1 may sense 1O2 generated through an as yet unknown process and initiates 1O2signaling
  in an FtsH2-dependent manner. FtsH2-dependent proteolysis of EX1 appears to be essential
  in the induction of nuclear gene expression changes. β-CC-induced and EX1-FtsH2-dependent
  SORGs are reasonably distinct as evidenced that these transcriptomes share relatively
  a very small portion of genes, signifying the coexistence of these two 1O2signaling
  cascades in plants.
