caption: (A) PEDF blocks the survival, proliferation and migration of endothelial
  cells (ECs). PEDF binds to LRP6, an essential co-receptor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  which attenuates β-catenin nuclear translocation and subsequently the expression
  of angiogenic genes such as VEGF and MMPs. PEDF competes with VEGF for binding to
  KDR, inhibiting the downstream angiogenic Akt/MAPK and NFAT/c-FLIP pathways. The
  VEGF/Flt-1 signalling is critical for EC survival. PEDF elicits γ-secretase to cleave
  Flt-1, resulting in suppressed survival signalling of ECs. PEDF also binds to the
  β-subunit of F1-ATP synthase and inhibits the production of ATP, which is indispensable
  for EC angiogenic events. (B) PEDF promotes the apoptosis of ECs. PEDF activates
  JNKs through LR. Activated JNKs in the cytosol have higher binding affinity to NFATc2,
  resulting in cytosolic retention and thus less NFAT in the nucleus as a transcription
  factor that is required to promote the expression of an anti-apoptotic factor c-FLIP.
  PEDF also binds to LR to activate p38, which leads to activation of PPAR-γ. PEDF
  also activates PPAR-γ via the mediation of MEK5/Erk5. Activated PPAR-γ then stimulates
  p53 expression to induce EC apoptosis. NF-κB is another target gene of PPAR-γ. Increased
  NF-κB is able to up-regulate FasL expression to promote EC apoptosis via the Fas/FasL
  pathway. Moreover, NF-κB displaces NFAT and binds to the promoter of the c-FLIP
  gene, resulting in reduced levels of c-FLIP. Interestingly, PEDF also stimulates
  NF-κB via a PPAR-γ-independent pathway, i.e. by inducing IκB degradation. Red lines
  represent inhibition of pathways whereas continuous green arrows show activation
  of pathways. Broken green arrows illustrate activations of pathways whose detailed
  signalling cascades are currently not fully understood. Erk5, orphan MAPK; UCP-2,
  uncoupling protein 2.
