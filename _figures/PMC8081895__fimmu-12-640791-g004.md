caption: Schematic representation of the triggering protein-activation pathway for
  each disease, using as a target the protein defined as mechanistically highly related
  to the disease. The proteins that link these pathways with proteins with high mechanistic
  value for this specific disease appear in yellow.  represents the pathway scheme
  obtained by Pathlinker analysis using the Cytoscape V3.6.1 (https://cytoscape.org/)
  program. (A) Respiratory Allergy. (B) Allergic Asthma. (C) Non-allergic Asthma.
