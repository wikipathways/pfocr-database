caption: The role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of PF. PF, an interstitial lung disease,
  is characterized by fibroblast proliferation, EMT, lung inflammation and the formation
  of fibroids, producing lung scarring. Patients and animals with PF have been shown
  to have increased levels of airway HMGB1. HMGB1 may be involved in the pathogenesis
  of PF as it can produce fibroblast differentiation and proliferation, alveolar wall
  thickening or muscularization thickening, and collagen accumulation. HMGB1 binds
  to RAGE, TLR2, and TLR4, activating both NF-κB and MAPK/p38/ERK 1/2 pathways. NF-κB
  activation and the p38 pathway can increase the levels of proinflammatory mediators
  and TGF-β1. As a mediator of vascular remodeling, TGF-β1 can induce phosphorylation
  of SMAD2 and SMAD3, which phosphorylate the transcription factor STAT-3. STAT-3,
  when activated, induces cell proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation. STAT-3
  activation promotes EMT, where epithelial cells develop mesenchymal characteristics
  such as loss of cell/cell adhesion. The increased number of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts
  can stimulate the formation of fibrotic tissue. TGF-β1 can elicit the release of
  α-sma, upregulate HMGB1 expression, and induce secretion of the profibrotic factors
  FGF2 and PDGF. α-sma directly stimulates the EMT process, causing an increased accumulation
  of ECM proteins, which augments airway remodeling. ECM-mediated remodeling involves
  the dysregulation of ECM composition, cleavage of ECM components, increased collagen
  deposition, and stiffening of tissue. In addition to inducing remodeling, the binding
  of HMGB1 to RAGE and TLR4 stimulates the expression and secretion of TNF-α, MCP-1,
  IL-8, and IL-1β. These proinflammatory mediators recruit and induce the accumulation
  of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes into the airways, increasing the levels
  of proteases, ROS, and HMGB1, establishing a deleterious feedback loop. The release
  of these molecules contributes to epithelial and endothelial injury and death, dissolution
  of cell/cell junctions, and loss of barrier integrity, thereby increasing alveolar
  permeability. Thus, HMGB1-mediated airway remodeling and inflammation contribute
  to lung fibrosis, scarring, and decreased lung function. EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FGF2, fibroblast growth
  factor 2; PF, pulmonary fibrosis; STAT-3, signal transducer and activator of transcription
