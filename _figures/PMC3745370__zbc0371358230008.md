caption: High expression of the ppGalNAc-T13 gene enhances cancer metastasis by formation
  of trimeric Tn antigen. The schematic illustrates that expression levels of GM1
  decrease and that the ppGalNAc-T13 gene is up-regulated along with high metastasis,
  leading to the generation of trimeric Tn antigen on Sdc1 molecules. The trimeric
  Tn antigen on Sdc1 might enhance integrin α5β1 functions, resulting in increased
  adhesion to fibronectin via the FAK/paxillin pathway. Moreover, the trimeric Tn
  antigen on Sdc1 recruits MMP-9 to GEM/rafts, resulting in enhancement of cell invasion
  and metastatic potential. The structure of the trimeric Tn antigen on Sdc1 may provide
  a potential biomarker for the prediction of high metastasis and also a molecular
  target for the therapies of highly metastatic cancers.
