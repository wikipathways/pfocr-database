caption: 'Schematic representation of the possible molecular mechanisms of pomegranate-mediated
  chemoprevention of experimental hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2;
  DENA: diethylnitrosamine; HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma; NF-κB: nuclear factor-κB.
  DENA simultaneously activates Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling pathways, which
  in turn, result in an elevated expression of target genes, including cyclin D1,
  COX-2, and Bcl-2 and reduced expression of Bax. All these features contribute to
  accelerated hepatocyte proliferation and evasion of apoptosis, which results in
  development of preneoplastic lesions and subsequently HCC. Pomegranate phytochemicals
  block interconnected Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling pathways, which lead to antiproliferative
  and proapoptotic effects contributing to chemoprevention of HCC. ↓: Activation and
  ⊥: downregulation. 1 and 2 indicate results of this study and that from [], respectively.'
