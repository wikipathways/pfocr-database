caption: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr)-mediated cross talk between innate lymphoid
  cells (ILCs) and immune/non-immune cells. Ahr ligands derived from the diet or microbiota
  activate Ahr to promote group 3 ILCs (ILC3) homeostasis by enhancing the survival
  or proliferation of ILC3. MHC-II+ ILC3, which are mainly CCR6+, suppress pathogenic
  Th17 response to commensal bacteria, while T-bet+ ILC3, together with group 1 ILC
  (ILC1), promote Th17 cells. Both Th17 cells and ILC3 can produce IL-22 to control
  commensal/pathogenic bacteria through facilitating the production of antimicrobial
  peptides by epithelial cells. Ahr ligand could potentially regulate natural killer
  (NK) cells, ILC1, and group 2 ILCs (ILC2) through the Ahr pathway in the gut. NK
  cells and ILC1 can help the host to clear pathogens, like Salmonella typhimurium,
  by production of effector cytokine IFNγ. ILC2, through expression of MHC class II
  (MHC-II) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), enhance Th2 cells. ILC2 and Th2
  cells protect the host from helminth infection by secreting type 2 cytokines, including
  IL-5, IL-13, and IL-4. Ahr ligand enhances Cyp1a1 expression in gut epithelial cells,
  and as a feedback negative control loop, Cyp1a1 degrades Ahr ligand to prevent overt
  Ahr-mediated immune responses. Solid lines and arrows depict known regulation. Dotted
  lines and arrows depict to-be-determined regulation in the gut.
