caption: Glycolysis and related pathways fuel biosynthesis and energy metabolism in
  cancer cells. This schematic shows how the glycolytic pathway feeds into other pathways,
  including the Kreb's Cycle (which fuels amino acid synthesis and provides metabolic
  intermediates for the electron transport chain), the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP,
  which is involved in nucleic acid synthesis), and one-carbon metabolism (the folate-methionine
  cycle).
