caption: 'The double-edged role of SFTSV: activating or suppressing inflammation.
  (A) Activation of inflammation: Under physiological conditions, TBK1 attenuates
  NF-κB activity by inhibiting IKK complex. While under SFTSV-infected conditions,
  SFTSV NSs sequesters TBK1 into the viral inclusion bodies and then relieves the
  inhibitory effect of TBK1 on NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in the activations
  of NF-κB and its target cytokines or chemokines genes. (B) Inhibition of inflammation:
  SFTSV NSs binds and relieves the inhibitory effect of ABIN2 on both TPL2 and p105,
  so as to induce the MEK/ERK signaling, finally resulting in the production of anti-inflammatory
  factor IL-10 for viral pathogenesis. As mentioned above, SFTSV NSs isolates TBK1
  into virus inclusion bodies and eventually reduces downstream production of type
  I IFN. SFTSV, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome bunyavirus; NSs, nonstructural
  protein; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IKK, IkappaB kinase;
  ABIN2, A20-binding inhibitor of NF-κB 2; TPL2, tumor progression locus 2; IL-10,
