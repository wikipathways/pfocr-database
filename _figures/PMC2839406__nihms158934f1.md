caption: 'The involvement of HMGN1 in TCR. UV light induces photolesions (marked in
  red asterisk) within the genome, which can impose a blockage on transcription. Once
  elongating RNA polymerase encounters a transcription-blocking photolesion its interaction
  with CSB is stabilized to initialize the TCR pathway. CSB is required for recruitment
  of additional factors such as p300, CSA, XAB2 and HMGN1 to initiate the repair of
  the lesion. p300 may acetylate residues within histone tails in the proximate nucleosomes
  to the lesion to facilitate chromatin de-compaction and recruitment of repair factors.
  HMGN1 may be involved in unfolding of the chromatin within the damaged area or in
  preventing the chromatin from re-folding. HMGN1 can affect the chromatin folding
  in the following ways: HMGN1 may accelerate the acetylation rate by p300. HMGN1
  can prevent binding of histone H1 to the area of the lesion through competition
  with histone H1 for chromatin binding sites. HMGN1 can inhibit chromatin remodeling
  factors from re-positioning nucleosomes in the damage area. By these mechanisms
  HMGN1 may support chromatin de-compaction in the area of the lesion to facilitate
  repair of the damage. In addition p300 can acetylate HMGN1 directly to reduce the
  binding of HMGN1 to nucleosomes; a mode of regulation that may serve as a negative
  feedback loop. The dashed lines indicate hypothesized processes that have not been
  proven experimentally to occur following induction of DNA damage.'
