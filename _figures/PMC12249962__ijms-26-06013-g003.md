caption: 'Summary of multi-target promising compounds for prostate cancer (PCa) treatment.
  Compounds are color-coded based on their predominant metabolic or regulatory activity:
  blue-labeled compounds act on key enzymes of the glycolytic pathway; yellow-labeled
  compounds modulate enzymes involved in lipid metabolism; green-labeled compounds
  exert dual activity by targeting both glycolytic and lipid metabolic pathways. Purple-labeled
  compounds are linked to epigenetic regulation. Compounds such as ALCAR (brown label)
  represent substrate-modulating or broad-spectrum agents with multi-target potential,
  whose mechanisms require further elucidation. Met, histone methylation; Lac, histone
  lactylation; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine. * Indicates synthetic multi-target compound'
