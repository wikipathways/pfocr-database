caption: Model of L-proline-mediated differentiation of mESCs to EPL cells. L-Pro
  enters the cell via the SNAT2 transporter () where it (A) acts on various signaling
  pathways including the amino acid-sensing signaling mTOR pathway, ERK and P38 pathways
  to induce differentiation (; ; ). (B) L-Pro is metabolized to pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  (P5C) by proline oxidase (POX) via the proline cycle in the mitochondria. P5C can
  then be converted to glutamate (Glu) by P5C dehydrogenase (P5CD). Glu is further
  converted to alpha-ketoglutarate, which enters the TCA cycle with subsequent production
  of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Glu can also be converted to L-Pro
  via the sequential actions of P5C synthase (P5CS) and P5C reductase (P5CR). This
  conversion produces NADP+, which is required to stimulate the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) in the cytoplasm of the cell (; ). The PPP is required to generate
  the ribose components needed for DNA and RNA synthesis and is coupled with aerobic
  glycolysis to generate ATP in highly proliferative cells such as ESCs and cancer
  cells (). Stimulation of the PPP and glycolysis in the presence of L-Pro () may
  stimulate the differentiation of mESCs to EPL cells and support the increased proliferation
  rates observed in EPL cells. (C) When mESCs are starved of L-Pro, the amino acid
  response (AAR) pathway is activated to control L-Pro production and uptake into
  the cell. Free prolyl-tRNA (i.e., not loaded with L-Pro) binds to General Control
  Non-Depressible-2 (Gcn2) kinase which phosphorylates Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2
  (eIF2), resulting in Activating Transcription Factor-4 (Atf4) regulating the expression
  of genes involved in L-Pro transport and metabolism. The net result of this autoregulatory
  loop is self-limiting concentrations of L-Pro resulting in mESC self-renewal ().
  When L-Pro is added exogenously, this pathway is overwhelmed triggering differentiation.
