caption: ABA-mediated abiotic stress response. Overview of the molecular events in
  ABA-mediated stress tolerance. ABA accumulation, induced by stress signals, activates
  PYL ABA receptors to inhibit group A PP2Cs. PP2C inhibition in turn allows SnRK2
  activation through autophosphorylation. Active SnRK2s mediate the ABA response through
  the phosphorylation of downstream targets. In guard cells, SnRK2s phosphorylate
  the SLAC1 and KAT1 ion channels, resulting in stomatal closure to prevent transpirational
  water loss. In seeds, ABI5 phosphorylation by SnRK2s leads to the inhibition of
  seedling growth. The phosphorylation of the AREB1 (ABF2), AREB2 (ABF4), and ABF3
  transcription factors activates the transcription of target genes such as Late Embryogenesis
  Abundant (LEA)-class genes as well as transcription factors (TF) involved in stress
  tolerance. Transcriptional increases in the expression of group A PP2C genes may
  function as a negative feedback loop in the ABA response pathway by inhibiting SnRK2
  activity. Positive regulators of the ABA signaling pathway are shown in green, whereas
  negative regulators are shown in red.
