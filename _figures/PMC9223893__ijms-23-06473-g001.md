caption: Schematics of Rv biosynthesis, score and experimental design. (A) Lipid precursor,
  biosynthetic and inactivating enzymes and receptors involved in D-series Rv pathway.
  The chemical structure refers to RvD1. The illustration was created with SERVIER
  Medical Art templates (smart.servier.com). (B) Equation for the calculation of the
  resolvin score. (C) Diagram of the experimental strategy and analyses.
