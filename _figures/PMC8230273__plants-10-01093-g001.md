caption: 'Simplified pathways for fatty acid and triacylglycerol synthesis in lesquerella
  seeds. Blue arrows indicate reactions involved in the Kennedy pathway. Purple arrows
  indicate reactions involved in acyl editing by LPCAT. Brown arrows indicate PDAT-mediated
  pathways. Green arrow indicates reactions involved in PC-derived DAG synthesis.
  Dotted lines indicate PC-derived DAG utilized by DGAT and PDAT. The red arrow indicates
