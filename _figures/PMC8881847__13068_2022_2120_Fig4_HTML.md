caption: Proposed fatty acid and TAG biosynthetic pathways in V. galamensis seeds.
  The reconstructed pathway included the fatty acids de novo biosynthesis, fatty acid
  modification, triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly and storage process. The heatmap showed
  the FPKM value of each unigene in the initial, fast and final oil accumulation stages.
