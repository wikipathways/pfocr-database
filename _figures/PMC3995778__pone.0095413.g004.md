caption: 'SN gene composition (nodes) and interactions (edges) are shown for: Meta-SN1
  in the upper left corner with green edges (which includes GW and GATES modules,
  GNAZ* gene only present in GW); ADNI-GW SN3 in the bottom left corner with dark
  blue edges; ADNI-GW SN4 in the bottom right corner with blue edges and ADNI-GW SN7
  in the upper right corner with light blue edges. Genes shared by at least 2 SNs
  are located at the center in bold font and cross interactions between genes inside
  each module are denoted by light grey edges. Node color represents the OR behavior
  in a gradient from green to red values (i.e. green: OR<1; red OR>1; white: OR = 1),
  denoting protection and risk, respectively. Similarly, node size is proportional
  to the –log10 p-value obtained from the meta-analysis (if absent, node size is the
  minimum). Triangle shaped nodes marks genes belonging to the glutamate signaling
  pathway GO term (GO:0007215); Diamond shaped nodes denotes genes belonging to KEGG
  Glutamatergic synapse pathway (hsa04724); Squares Square shaped nodes denotes genes
  belonging to both gene ontology term GO:0007215 and KEGG hsa04724 pathway.'
