caption: The influence of RANKL, sclerostin, and DKK1 on glucose metabolism and the
  corresponding signaling cascade. RANKL exerts detrimental effects on glucose homeostasis
  through multiple pathways. By activating NF-κB signaling pathway, RANKL induces
  high level of TNF-α, IL-1 and CXCL1 expression, causing hepatic chronic inflammation,
  and reduces insulin sensitivity, glucose uptake, and possibly skeletal muscle mass
  and strength. Additionally, RANKL impairs β-cell survival and proliferation, potentially
  via activating RANK-TRAF6-induced NF-κB, TRAF3/NIK, p38 MAPK, and GSK pathways and
  by inhibiting CREB signaling. Additionally, RANKL stimulates DPP4 secretion from
  osteoclasts, which degrades GLP-1, leading to insulin resistance and decreased glucose
  uptake in the liver and skeletal muscle, and lower insulin secretion. Denosumab
  may mitigate the negative effects mentioned above by targeting RANKL. Both sclerostin
  and DKK1 inhibit the binding of Wnt and LRP5/6, thereby reducing the stability of
  β-catenin, which transfers into the nucleus and promotes expression of downstream
  genes. Sclerostin could induce skeletal muscle insulin resistance via upregulation
  of ER stress by mTOR-mediated suppression of autophagy. DKK1 is speculated to have
  a negative relationship with β-cell proliferation and survival. Romosuzumab and
  DKK1-Ab may improve glucose metabolism by inhibiting these processes, respectively.
