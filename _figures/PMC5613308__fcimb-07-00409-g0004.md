caption: (A) Metabolic pathway reconstructions of Pi-disease and Pn-disease. Pipelines
  colored in orange represent the common pathways shared by both samples. The pipelines
  colored in purple and green represent the specific pathway in Pi-disease and Pn-disease,
  respectively; (B) Metabolic pathway reconstructions of Pi-health and Pn-health.
  Pipelines colored in pink represent the common pathways shared by both samples;
  no specific pathway was seen in Pi-health or Pn-health.
