caption: The NAE inhibitor MLN4924 has utility in the treatment of lung cancer. It
  may affect the formation of the TME and promote tumor cell death by regulating a
  variety of proteins and various signaling pathways, such as the HIF pathway and
  NF-κB pathway. MLN4924 may also be combined with certain drugs to make chemotherapy
  and radiotherapy more effective. TME, tumor microenvironment; HIF, hypoxia-inducible
  factor; DSB, double-strand break; NAE, NEDD8-activating enzyme; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; MDM2, murine double minute 2; RBX1, ring-box 1; Cdt1, chromatin
  and DNA replication factor 1; NOXA, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein
  1; DR5, death receptor 5; PTX, paclitaxel; CRL, cullin-ring ligase.
