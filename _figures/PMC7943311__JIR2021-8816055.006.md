caption: Signaling pathways critical for the roles and differentiation of Th9 cells
  and Treg cells in solid tumor. Treg cells and Th9 cells receive signals through
  surface receptors such as TCR, CD28, and costimulatory molecules GITR and OX40,
  interacting with ligands on neighboring cells such as DCs and CD8+T cells. Engagement
  of the TCR complex and of the coreceptor CD28 activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-
  (PI (3) K-) Akt and mTOR pathways, which inactivate Foxo1. Expression of the Akt-insensitive
  Foxo1 mutant depletes tumor-associated activated Treg (aTreg) cells and activate
  CD8+T cell response in the mammary tumor model. In the mouse melanoma model, PI
  (3) K-Akt-mTOR signaling is activated by IL-7, which results in nuclear accumulation
  of Foxo1 and activation of STAT5 that binds to the p300 promoter to induce differentiation
  of Th9 cells and production of IL-9. OX40/OX40L engagement activates the AKT-mTOR
  pathway, which induces phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of Foxo1 to inhibit
  Foxp3 induction. Activation of OX40 induces Treg cell apoptosis and increases the
  CD8+T cell/Treg cell ratio. OX40L can be induced by the dectin-1 signaling pathway.
  Dectin-1 activates DCs and induces a potent antitumor response that is dependent
  on Th9 cells and CD8+T cells. Activation of GITR by its ligand upregulates NF-κB
  to induce a repressive chromatin structure of the Foxp3 locus and consequently inhibit
  Treg cell differentiation. GITR/GITRL engagement improves antitumor activity and
  differentiation of Th9 cells by activating the NF-κB pathway and STAT6/p300. GITR/GITRL
  engagement also promotes IL-9-dependent enhancement of CD8+T cytotoxic T lymphocyte
  (CTL) response and increases the crosspresentation capacity of DCs. FAS/FAS ligand
  (FASL) signaling activates NF-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)
  to promote Th9 cell differentiation, as well as IFN-γ producing CD8+T cell generation
  to enhance antitumor immunity in the Lewis lung carcinoma model. Activation of Fas
  by IL-2 and agonistic CD40 antibody (αCD40) results in Treg cell apoptosis in the
  renal adenocarcinoma (Renca) tumor model. Inhibition of the mTOR-hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α (HIF1α) signaling pathway by histone deacetylase sirtuin1 (SIRT1) negatively
  regulates differentiation of Th9 cells in the melanoma tumor model. Inhibition of
  HIF1α by microRNA miR-145 suppresses differentiation of Th9 cells in the liver cancer
  malignant ascites model. HIF1α endows Treg cells with metabolic property that allows
  them to endure within the tumor. Specific ablation of HIF1α in Treg cells results
  in enhanced CD8+T cell suppression in the glioblastoma tumor model.
