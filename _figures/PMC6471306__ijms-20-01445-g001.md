caption: Type I and III interferon production following pathogen sensing. Schematic
  representing the canonical pathway of pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) sensing
  of intracellular pathogens. Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized
  by PRRs leading to activation and phosphorylation of IRF3/7 which then translocate
  into the nucleus and drive the expression of both type I and III interferons. Both
  interferons are translated and secreted from the infected cell in an autocrine or
  paracrine manner. Upon binding of type I IFN to the IFNAR1/IFNAR2 and of type III
  IFN to the IFNLR1/IL-10R2 receptor, signal transductions are initiated leading to
  the formation of the ISGF3 complex (IRF9/p-STAT1/p-STAT2) which then acts as a transcription
  factor driving the expression of interferon stimulated genes.
