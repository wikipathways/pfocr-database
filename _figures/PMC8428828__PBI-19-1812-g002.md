caption: Schematic representation of reconstructed astaxanthin biosynthesis pathways
  in maize seed. Green indicates the enhancement of early precursor biosynthesis due
  to the expression of ZmPSY1 and PaCRTI. Grey represents a competitive metabolic
  pathway that converts lycopene into lutein; we aimed to limit lycopene conversion
  to lutein by down‐regulating the expression of LCY‐e. Red shows our attempt to produce
  astaxanthin through the elongation of the β‐carotene biosynthesis pathway. The box
  with the black dotted outline contains the details of the strategy highlighted in
  red. Hydroxylases (CBFD/P450/CrtZ) and ketolases (HBFD/BKT/P450) were employed to
  convert the β‐rings of β‐carotene into 3‐hydroxy‐4‐keto‐β‐rings. GGPS, geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate synthase; LCY‐e, lycopene ɛ‐cyclase; LCY‐b, lycopene β‐cyclase; ABA,
  abscisic acid.
