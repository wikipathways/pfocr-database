caption: 'Prediction of genetic targets for improved lysine production in C. glutamicum
  based on correlation of flux through metabolic reactions with lysine production
  flux among the calculated elementary modes: Optimal flux distribution for lysine
  production in Corynebacterium glutamicum on glucose as obtained from elementary
  mode analysis (A) and resulting target potential coefficients (B). In the flux map
  all fluxes are given as relative molar flux normalized to the uptake flux. The data
  shown display the average fluxes and deviations from the different elementary modes
  under optimum production conditions. The coloured arrows reflect amplification (green)
  and deletion/attenuation targets (red). In the heat map, listing the predicted targets,
  a positive value (green) relates to a reaction, which positively correlates with
  the production (amplification target), whereas negative correlation (red) displays
  a deletion/attenuation target. Black colour indicates statistically insignificant
  values.'
