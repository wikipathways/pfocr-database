caption: Involvement of mTOR-TFEB in mediating lysosomal stress responses (LSR). Under
  unstressed conditions, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is localized
  on lysosome membranes and phosphorylates transcription factor EB (TFEB), which is
  a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis. Phosphorylated TFEB is bound by 14-3-3
  protein promoting the sequestration of TFEB in the cytoplasm. Under stressful conditions,
  which can be caused by any drug, pathogen, or material that enters the endolysosome
  system (termed LSR inducers), lysosomes undergo lysosomal stress responses (labeled
  1–9). We posit that during LSR, stressed lysosomes can use various signals, one
  of which being mTOR-TFEB signaling pathway to promote lysosome biogenesis. When
  lysosomes are stressed, mTORC1 is released from lysosome membranes, calcium is released
  through calcium permeable channels (depicted by blue cylinder) into the cytosol
  where it activates the cytosolic phosphatase calcineurin. Activated calcineurin
  dephosphorylates TFEB allowing it to translocate into the nucleus where it binds
  at the coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) element of lysosome
  biogenesis genes. Subsequently, there is an increase of lysosome-related genes that
  lead to the possible restoration of stressed lysosomes. Thus, LSR may use lysosome
  biogenesis as one of the pathways to restore lysosome function.

  description: Involvement of mTOR-TFEB in mediating lysosomal stress responses (LSR).

    Under stressful conditions, which can be caused by any drug, pathogen, or material
