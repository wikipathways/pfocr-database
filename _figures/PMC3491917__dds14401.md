caption: Schematic representation of two Ca2+-mediated signaling pathways that have
  been shown to modulate muscle phenotype. One pathway (blue) is Cn-NFAT, whereas
  the second (pink) is CaMK—both are activated by CaM binding. Cn phosphatase acts
  on NFAT transcription factors, which activate transcription when dephosphorylated.
  CaMKs act on class II HDACs, which are transcriptional repressors when in the non-phosphorylated
  state. Phosphorylated HDACs bind adaptor proteins of the14-3-3 family, translocating
  them out of the nucleus, which releases repression of MEF2-regulated transcription.
