caption: Histone modification inhibitors and BRAF inhibitors in thyroid cancer. The
  combination of Dabrafenib and Tazemetostat inhibits c-Myc and EZH2 protein activity
  through H3K27me3 deacetylating, promoting the apoptosis of BRAFV600E mutant PTC
  cells. PLX4032 and AZD6244 increase the histone acetylene of NIS promoters, leading
  to apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells. Dihydroxamic acid and VA can increase the
  expression of HP1β by activating the Notch signaling pathway, increasing the expression
  of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21, and decreasing cyclin D1, which inhibits
  the growth of TC cells. HDACi combined PLX472, PD0325901 and atzolizumab inhibited
  PD-L1 expression for the treatment of BRAF mutations in thyroid cancer cell immunotherapy.
  BRAF mutations inhibit H3K9 acetylation of TTF-1 and promoting acetylation of H3K27ac
  in PLXNC1 then promote the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells
