caption: The role of Ang II and its metabolites in the adrenal gland vasculature.
  Ang II and Ang III dilate adrenal arteries by AT2 receptor-mediated NO release and
  constrict arteries by AT1 receptor activation. The metabolism of Ang II by aminopeptidases
  to Ang III augments the vasorelaxation of adrenal arteries. Alternatively, the metabolism
  of Ang II by carboxypeptidases to Ang (1–7) acts as an inactivation pathway in the
  adrenal gland by attenuating vasorelaxation. Amino acid sequence of each Ang peptide
  is indicated in parentheses. PRCP, prolylcarboxypeptidase; PREP, prolylendopeptidase;
  APN, aminopeptidase N; APB, aminopeptidase B.
