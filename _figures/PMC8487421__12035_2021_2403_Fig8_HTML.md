caption: Effects of SCH and OHT on NGF-mediated TrkA and p75NTRsignaling pathway.
  NGF induces TrkA signaling pathway to increase neuronal proliferation. Pro-NGF,
  the precursor protein of NGF, can combine with p75NTR preferentially to enhance
  neuronal apoptosis. CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; JNK, C-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; NGF, nerve growth factor; OHT, overt hypothyroidism; p75NTR, p75 neurotrophin
  receptor; SCH, subclinical hypothyroidism; TrkA, tropomyosin-related kinase A
