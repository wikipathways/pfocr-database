caption: A schematic model illustrating multiple signaling pathways in regulating
  StAR gene transcription. The interaction of trophic hormones [luteinizing hormone(LH)/adrenocorticotropic
  hormone(ACTH)] with specific membrane receptors results in the activation of coupled
  G proteins (G), which in turn activates membrane-associated adenylyl cyclase (AC)
  that catalyzes cAMP formation from ATP. cAMP then activates protein kinase A (PKA),
  which results in the phosphorylation of a number of transcription factors. The concerted
  action of multiple transcription factors, and their interaction with most, if not
  all, of the cis-regulatory elements, appears to be involved in regulating StAR gene
  expression. cAMP-dependent mechanisms predominantly regulate StAR expression and
  steroidogenesis in steroidogenic tissue. The PKC pathway is involved in regulating
  transcription of the StAR gene. Ca2+signaling has been shown to be effectively involved
  in modulating trophic hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis. Epidermal growth factor
  (EGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), prolactin (PRL), gonadotrophin-releasing
  hormone (GnRH) and macrophage-derived factors (MDFs) bind to specific membrane receptors
  (R), activate a cascade of protein kinases (Ras/Raf/others; MAPK/ERK) and have been
  demonstrated to function in the regulation of StAR expression and steroid biosynthesis.
