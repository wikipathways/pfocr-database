caption: The detailed cascades in the double-deck loop (DDL) which is a simplified
  model based on the biochemical reaction networks in . The orange stick is the gene
  in the “on” state and the blue one is the gene in the “off” state; ROCK is represented
  as the small green ball; Arrow 1 corresponds to the Rho/ROCK pathway in  and Arrow
  2 corresponds to the Rho/SRF pathway. The negative regulation from ROCK can push
  down the state of gene from the “on” state to the “off” state along Arrow 1 with
  rate k2. The positive regulation from RhoA* can also push up the state of gene along
  Arrow 2 with rate ak1. The Arrow 3 and 4 represent the basic switching of gene's
  state with rates kon and koff respectively. The synthesis and degradation of ROCK
  will drive the system move along the horizontal directions (i.e., Arrow 5 and 6)
  with rates ak3 and k4, respectively. Since two parallel loops (i.e., the blue and
  red loops) can be found in our model, it is so called DDL.
