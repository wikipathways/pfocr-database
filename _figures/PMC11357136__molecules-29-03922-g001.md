caption: 'An illustrative representation of caveolae associated with caveolin proteins.
  Caveolae may be a kind of platform for various signaling molecules including GLP-1
  and NMDA receptors as well as even for the development of certain exosomes, which
  may be interrelated to the scaffold domain of caveolins. Note that some critical
  pathways for the development of various disease-related signaling have been omitted
  for clarity. Abbreviation: GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate'
