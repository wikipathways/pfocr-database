caption: Major metabolite biosynthetic pathways regulated by R2R3-MYBs and simplified
  schemes are shown. a. The most intensively investigated regulatory metabolites are
  phenylpropanoid biosynthesis-derived compounds, including flavonoids and lignins.
  Typical groups of flavonoids are shown in the yellow box, several representative
  groups for specific branches of flavonoid biosynthesis are shown in the deep yellow
  box, and typical groups for lignins are shown in the light blue box. More information
  regarding the phenylpropanoid pathway has been reviewed recently []. b. R2R3-MYB
  regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis in S12 has primarily been studied in Brassicaceae.
  The synthesis pathway involves three phases, with two types of starting amino acids,
  that are regulated by different R2R3-MYBs. A fine review with more details has recently
  been published by Mitreiter and Gigolashvili []. c. The best-studied terpenoids
  regulated by R2R3-MYBs are floral volatiles.
