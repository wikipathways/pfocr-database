caption: Proposed signaling pathway in retinal detachment leading to rod terminal
  retraction. RhoA activation leads to phosphorylation of MLC, causing actomyosin
  contraction, and is responsible in part for axonal retraction. Components of the
  RhoA signaling pathway (red), as well as another Rho protein, RAC1, and myosin IIB,
  which contains MLC, were examined. MBS, myosin binding subunit; MLC, myosin light
  chain; PAK, p21-activated kinase; GDI, guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor;
  GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GTP, guanosine
  triphosphate; GAP, GTPase activating proteins.
