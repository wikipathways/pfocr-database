caption: 'A proposed diagram for the therapeutic effect of PRP improved bladder overactivity
  induced by OHD in rat model. Accordingly, the OVX group exacerbated bladder pathological
  damage and interstitial fibrosis through the NFƘB/COX-2 and the RAS/ERK1/2 signaling
  pathways. In contrast, PRP instillation for 4 weeks regulated the inflammatory fibrotic
  biosynthesis, promoted cell proliferation, matrix synthesis and enhanced mucosal
  regeneration through the HA/PI3K/AKT/SOX-9 signaling pathway to ameliorate OHD-induced
  bladder dysfunction. Moreover, PRP could promote angiogenic potential through the
  VEGF/VEGF-R and the PI3K/AKT/e-NOS signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of OHD
  for bladder repair. Note: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; CD44, cluster of
