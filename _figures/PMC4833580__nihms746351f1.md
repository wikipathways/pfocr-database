caption: 'Circles represent chance events whereas triangles represent outcomes that
  lead to recursive, Markov model () – Death, VTE recurrent, VTE no AC, VTE acute.
  In the initial pathway depicted above, there is first a risk of death from background
  causes or VTE. In the next branch point, we segregate patients into relative probability
  of being supratherapeutic, subtherapeutic, or therapeutic based on data from Free
  Care patients prior to Health Reform versus patients previously on Free Care who
  became newly insured post reform. The therapeutic category determines the subsequent
  risk for more VTE or major bleeding depicted by the next set of branch points. Finally
  a patient can continue anticoagulation during the first three month cycle versus
  complete anticoagulation if already having completed two cycles (6 months being
  the mean duration of therapy in our population)Abbreviations: VTE = venous thromboembolism,
  AC = anticoagulation'
