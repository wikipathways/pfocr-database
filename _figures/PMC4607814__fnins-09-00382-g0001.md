caption: A schematic diagram illustrating the mechanisms responsible for impairment
  of the arterial baroreceptor function in chronic heart failure. CHF-elevated endogenous
  Ang II (plasma Ang II and tissue Ang II in the nodose ganglion) with overexpression
  of AT1R in baroreceptor neurons might induce the mitochondrial superoxide overproduction
  and the latter upregulates expression of the phosphorylated IKK, phosphorylated
  IκBα, and phosphorylated NFκB p65. The phosphorylated NFκB p65 translocates to the
  nucleus, and down-regulates the mRNA and protein expression of Nav channels. Additionally,
  endogenous Ang II with AT1R also directly inhibits the activation of Nav channels.
  As a consequence, reduced expression, and activation of Nav channels in baroreceptor
  neurons contribute to the impairment of aortic baroreceptors and the arterial baroreflex
  dysfunction in the CHF state. Briefly, Ang II-superoxide-NFκB signaling pathway
  down-regulates the aortic baroreceptor function through influencing the expression
  and activation of Nav channels in CHF. CHF, chronic heart failure; Ang II, Angiotensin
  II; AT1R, Angiotensin II type 1 receptor; Nav, voltage-gated sodium channel.
