caption: Mechanisms of interaction between glioblastoma multiforme cells and the immune
  system. (A) Tumor cells produce PD-Ls (PD-L1 and PD-L2) that bind to the PD-1 receptor
  on the surface of T cells, which causes T cell anergy and blocks adaptive immunity.
  (B) The tumor produces a large amount of TGF-β, which activates macrophages along
  the alternative (M2) pathway; in response, macrophages intensively produce TGF-β,
  which prevents their activation along the classical pathway and turns off active
  immunity. (C) Tumor cells and damaged tissues produce a large amount of stromal
  cell-derived factor-1 (also known as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12), which is
  a chemokine of the C-X-C subfamily that interacts with the CXCR4 receptor on the
  membrane of HSCs and monocytes attracting them into the tumor, thereby enhancing
  immunosuppression and suppressing inflammation. (D) The production of CSF1 by tumor
  cells activates CSF1R on the membrane of normal stem cells and monocytes, which
  transforms them into macrophages activated by TGF-β through the alternative pathway.
  PD, programmed cell death; PD-L, PD ligand; HSCs, hematopoietic stem cells; CSF1,
  colony stimulating factor 1; CSF1R, CSF1 receptor; CXCR4, C-X-C chemokine receptor
  type 4.
