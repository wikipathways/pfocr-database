caption: Critical interactions between complement and antigen presenting cells. Macrophages
  and immature dendritic cells produce all of the components of the classical and
  alternative pathways of complement activation. In addition, they express receptors
  for C1q, C3b, iC3b, C3a, C5a and the Fc segment of antibodies. (A) C1q is critical
  to the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages and dendritic
  cells. The production of C3, factor B and factor D can result in deposition of C3bBb
  on the cell surface, which can cleave more C3b to form C3bBbC3b, the C5 convertase
  of the alternative pathway. This C5 convertase or other serine proteases produced
  by macrophages can cleave C5 into C5a and C5b. A feedback loop between C5a and FcR
  exists, in which C5 synthesis and cleavage is upregulated by antibodies engaging
  FcγRIII. Binding of the resultant C5a to receptors on macrophages in turn upregulates
  FcγRIII and downregulates the inhibitory FcγRIIB. (B) Complement regulatory proteins
  on macrophages and dendritic cells modulate interactions with T and B cells. Decay
  accelerating factor (DAF; CD55) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane
  regulator that accelerates the dissociation of Bb from C3b. This limits the amount
  of C3b bound to the surface of antigen presenting cells. Membrane co-factor protein
  (MCP; CD46) is a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein that regulates complement by
  acting as a co-factor for factor I to cleave C3b into enzymatically inactive iC3b
  and then C3d. DAF and MCP are also expressed by T cells and modulate their responses.
  As the result of alternative splicing, MCP is expressed with two different cytoplasmic
  tails that modulate T cell responses divergently.

  description: Critical interactions between complement and antigen presenting cells.
    Macrophages and immature dendritic cells produce all of the components of the
    classical and alternative pathways of complement activation. In addition, they
    express receptors for C1q, C3b, iC3b, C3a, C5a and the Fc segment of antibodies.
    (A) C1q is critical to the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages
    and dendritic cells. The production of C3, factor B and factor D can result in
    deposition of C3bBb on the cell surface, which can cleave more C3b to form C3bBbC3b,
    the C5 convertase of the alternative pathway. This C5 convertase or other serine
    proteases produced by macrophages can cleave C5 into C5a and C5b. A feedback loop
    between C5a and FcR exists, in which C5 synthesis and cleavage is upregulated
    by antibodies engaging FcγRIII. Binding of the resultant C5a to receptors on macrophages
    in turn upregulates FcγRIII and downregulates the inhibitory FcγRIIB. (B) Complement
    regulatory proteins on macrophages and dendritic cells modulate interactions with
    T and B cells. Decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
    membrane regulator that accelerates the dissociation of Bb from C3b. This limits
    the amount of C3b bound to the surface of antigen presenting cells. Membrane co-factor
