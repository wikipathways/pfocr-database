caption: 'Overview of the purinergic signaling cascade.The purinergic pathway is comprised
  by several purine-hydrolyzing enzymes expressed on the cell surface, generally known
  as ectoenzymes, including E-NTPDase, E-NPP and E-5′-NT, that sequentially degrade
  nucleotides in a series of coordinated reactions. The resulting nucleoside adenosine
  (Ado) can be subsequently converted to inosine (Ino) by adenosine deaminase (ADA).
  Signaling molecules bind to ionotropic P2X receptors and metabotropic P2Y receptors
  depending on the affinity of each receptor for their nucleotide agonists. The four
  subtypes of P1 types have affinity to adenosine and are all G-protein-coupled receptors
  (GPCRs). The binding of the purinergic mediators to their specific receptors on
  the cell surface can turn on or off downstream signaling cascades leading to different
  cellular outcomes. Source: Authors artwork.'
