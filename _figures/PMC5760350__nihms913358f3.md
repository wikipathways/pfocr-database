caption: PKA-mediated phosphorylation of activation of serine 1928 induces potentiation
  of LTCCs in response to hyperglycemia and during diabetes (). This leads to increased
  global Ca2+ influx and contraction. The increase in Ca2+ influx promotes activation
  of the AKAP150-targeted calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFATc3 and allows its
  nuclear translocation where the transcription factor can suppress the expression
  of KV2.1 (but not KV1.2 and KV1.5) subunits. This reduction in KV2.1 expression
  and function decreases voltage-gated K+ currents and the negative feedback membrane
  potential hyperpolarization, thus leading to membrane potential depolarization,
  further Ca2+ influx through LTCCs, vascular smooth muscle contraction and enhanced
  vascular tone. Whether changes in KV7.X subunits during diabetes proceed through
  the calcineurin/NFATc3 signaling pathway and similar changes occur in the human
  vasculature require further investigation. Illustration of the interaction between
  AKAP150 and LTCC does not necessarily reflect the native interaction between these
  proteins. The cartoon was drawn as such for simplicity.
