caption: In vivo labelling to study the biosynthesis of O. pumila apical cuttings
  by feeding with deuterated metabolites. a, b Selected deuterium intermediates in
  the CPT biosynthesis pathway and their chemoenzymatic synthesis. c O. pumila apical
  cuttings were given the deuterated metabolites d4-strictosidine and d4-strictosidinic
  acid as feeding precursors. d Labelled poststrictosidine metabolite products with
  pentacyclic pyrroloquinoline scaffolds detected by in vivo feeding experiments
