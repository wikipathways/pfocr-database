caption: '(a) Structures of a high fidelity replicative DNA polymerase and a low fidelity
  TLS polymerase (reprinted with permission from Nature Reviews Molecular & Cell Biology).The
  more restrictive nature of the active site in the replicative polymerase is apparent.(b)
  Model for polymerase switching during TLS. Replicative DNA polymerases (blue) stall
  at lesions (yellow triangle) in the DNA template. In the first polymerase switch,
  a specialized TLS polymerase (tan) is recruited to the sliding clamp PCNA at the
  stalled fork and replicates over the lesion. This TLS “patch” is then extended by
  the same or another TLS polymerase (green). The final switch restores the replicative
  DNA polymerase to the template and processive DNA synthesis continues.(c) Molecular
  interactions important for the switch from replicative to TLS polymerases. Following
  replication arrest, Rad6-Rad18 (E2–E3) ubiquitin enzymes are recruited to RPA bound
  single-stranded DNA. Following ubiquitination of PCNA by this complex, the TLS polymerase
  is recruited to the stalled fork. Polη interacts with three proteins at these sites
  via three different motifs: a ubiquitin binding domain (UBZ, green) which binds
  to the ubiquitin moiety on PCNA, a PIP box (purple) which binds to the hydrophobic
  pocket between the subunits of PCNA, and a carboxy-terminal domain (red) that mediates
  an interaction with Rad18. Whether the replicative polymerase (Polε) is actually
  displaced from PCNA as shown or moves aside and remains bound to PCNA is not clear.'
