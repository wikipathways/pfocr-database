caption: 'Prooxidant pathway for NP-induced toxicity: various NP exhibit oxidative
  stress dependent toxicity. Upon NP exposure, ROS generation is capable of inducing
  oxidative DNA damage, strand breaks, protein denaturation, and lipid peroxidation
  thereby demonstrating the mutagenic and carcinogenic characteristics associated
  with NP. Excess free radical production leads to mitochondrial membrane damage causing
  necrosis and cell death. Phagocytes including neutrophils and macrophages generate
  massive ROS upon incomplete phagocytosis of NP through the NADPH-oxidase enzyme
  system whereas NP-induced ROS triggers an inflammatory cascade of chemokine and
  cytokine expression via activation of cell signaling pathways such as MAPK, NF-κB,
  Akt, and RTK. Furthermore, oxidative stress mediated stimulation of these cellular
  mechanisms results in transcription of genes responsible for fibrosis, EMT, and
  carcinogenesis. NP-elicited ROS is at the center stage for majority of the ensuing
  adverse outcomes.'
