  immune genes identified in this study were highlighted in pink boxes. The up and
  down arrows in gene boxes referred to significant up and down-regulation in symbiotic
  condition. AIF: Apoptosis inducing factor; ALF: Anti-lipopolysaccharide factor;

  ECSIT: Evolutionary conserved intermediate in the Toll pathway; Hcy-PO: Hemocyanin
  with PO activity; MIP: Melanization Inhibitor Protein; PO: Phenoloxidase; PPAE:
  Prophenoloxidase activating enzyme; PXN: Peroxinectin; SOCS: Suppressor of cytokine
  signaling; SOD: Superoxide dismutase; TGase: Transglutaminase.'
