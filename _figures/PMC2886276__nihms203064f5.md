caption: Carbohydrate metabolism and fermentation in tumor cells. Glucose metabolism
  in malignant neuroblastoma occurs primarily through glycolysis where pyruvate is
  converted to lactate via LDH with NADH reduced to NAD+. NAD+ drives substrate-level
  phosphorylation through phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase producing energy
  in the form of ATP through glycolysis (). While tumor cells have a mitochondria,
  its function is expendable, resulting in meager amount of pyruvate converted to
  acetyl-CoA through mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). An absence of [formic
  acid] in this study indicates that conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA + formate
  through pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) is not likely. An absence of accumulated [isocitrate],
  [succinate], or [glyoxylate] suggests a lack of a functional glyoxylate cycle. Absence
  of [acetaldehyde] accumulation indicates that pyruvate conversion to acetaldehyde
  through pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) or acetaldehyde to [alcohol] through alcohol
  dehydrogenase (ADH) is unlikely events required for anaerobic fermentation. A lack
  of [acetoin] indicates that conversion of pyruvate through the diacetyl/acetoin
  biosynthetic pathway is unlikely, and a lack of quantifiable [aldehydes and/or ketones]
  in general suggests that butanoate fermentation is not likely involved with energy
  metabolism as well. The quantifiable accumulation of [L-alanine] in conjunction
  with several amino acids (yellow highlighted) such as [aspartate], [glutamate],
  and [α-ketoglutarate] suggests potential involvement of pyruvate–alanine transaminase
  (ALT) or L-alanine/oxaloacetate aminotransferase (ASPAT) pathway. L-alanine could
  be reconverted to pyruvate through L-alanine dehydrogenase (ALAD) to regenerate
  NADH to drive LDH. Evidence also suggests that pyruvate may be condensing with coenzyme
  A to form acetyl-CoA which is converted to acetyl phosphate by phosphotransacetylase
  (PTA) and [acetate] by acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) which is a reaction that could
  contribute to a second source of ATP production
