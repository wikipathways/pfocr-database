caption: Hypothetical scheme of the mechanism by which Dkk1 promotes osteolytic lesions
  in vivo. A, The cellular differentiation of osteoprogenitors, which can be monitored
  by Osterix and ALP expression, is governed in part by Wnt3a and BMP2 signaling.
  BMP2, which is inhibited by Noggin, is a strong inducer of Osterix and ALP, relying
  on an indirect mechanism that involves p53 and Cbfa1 (not included). Wnt3a/β-catenin
  signaling, which is antagonized by Dkk1 (and Dkk2), can have opposing effects on
  osteoblast development depending on BMP2 signaling. In absence of BMP2, Wnt3a weakly
  promotes osteoblast differentiation through the β-catenin pathway. In presence of
  BMP2, Wnt3a inhibits osteoblast differentiation by down-regulating the BMP2-p53-Cbaf1-Osterix-ALP
  axis (thick line). The molecular mechanism of the crosstalk has not yet been elucidated.
  Our scheme postulates that the Dkk1-dependent inhibition of Wnt3a's positive effect
  on osteoprogenitors in vitro may be outweighed by the abrogation of Wnt3a's negative
  effect on BMP2 signaling, such that, on balance, Dkk1 enhances features of early
  osteoblastogenesis. B, The differentiation of osteoclasts, which is strictly dependent
  upon interaction of osteoclast precursors with osteoblasts, is mediated in part
  by signaling pathways that emanate from the binding of M-CSF and RANKL to c-Fms
  and RANK, respectively. Osteoblasts stimulated by BMP2 express high levels of M-CSF
  and RANKL (positive regulators of osteoclastogenesis) but low levels of OPG (negative
  regulator of osteoclastogenesis), resulting in a positive signal for osteoclast
  formation. Osteoblasts exposed to Wnt3a exhibit the opposite phenotype with regard
  to M-CSF, RANKL and OPG expression, resulting in a negative signal for osteoclast
  formation. Osteoclastogenesis is further dampened by Wnt3a's ability to inhibit
  BMP2 signaling, as indicated in panel A (thick line). Constitutive expression of
  Dkk1 (and Dkk2) by bone marrow-homing tumor cells (e.g., multiple myeloma) may enhance
  osteoclastogenesis in vivo by inhibiting Wnt3a, thus shifting the balance of Wnt3a/BMP2
  co-signaling in favor of BMP2 signaling. The consequent increase in osteoclastogenesis
  promotes lytic bone lesions as long as the paracrine supply of Dkk1 by tumor (myeloma)
  cells is sustained.
