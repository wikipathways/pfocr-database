caption: Model of the signal transduction pathway affecting expression of pulse-dependent
  genes. (Modified from reference .) When cAMP binds to the surface receptor CAR1,
  both the adenylyl cyclase ACA and ERK2 are activated. cAMP accumulates as the consequence
  of inhibition of the phosphodiesterase RegA and stimulates PKA activity, which is
  necessary for induction of pulse-dependent genes. PKA subsequently inhibits ERK2,
  and RegA is reactivated, thereby terminating the response to the original cAMP pulse.
  In the absence of ACA activity (indicated by a cross), the minor adenylyl cyclase
  generates sufficient cAMP to activate PKA.
