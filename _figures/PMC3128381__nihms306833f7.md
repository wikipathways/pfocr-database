caption: (a) Hypothetical model showing the early signaling events and downstream
  signal transduction regulating the stability of SOS1 mRNA. Under Na+ stress, operation
  of SOS1 would cause extracellular pH elevation, which could be required for activation
  and/or maintenance of the plasma membrane-bound NADPH oxidase activity that produces
  extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Extracellular ROS could serve as signaling
  molecules to trigger gene regulation. The stability of SOS1 mRNA could be increased
  through a positive feedback regulation upon salt stress.(b) Redox cycling of paraquat
  (PQ) coupling with the plasma membrane NADPH oxidases. The plasma membrane-bound
  NADPH oxidase could be an enzymatic source of electrons for the formation of free
  radical paraquat (PQ+) from normal divalent cation paraquat (PQ2+). Rapid reoxidation
  of PQ+ causes production of ROS through transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen.
  The PQ redox cycling, which causes enormous extracellular ROS production deleterious
  to plant cells, could be dependent on SOS1 activity that would be required for activation
  and/or maintenance of the NADPH oxidase activity. See the Discussion in the text
  for a detailed explanation.
