caption: At different growth stages, the flavonoids metabolic pathway in A. pedunculata
  leaves. The orange dot indicates that the substance is present in the AP3/AP1 samples;
  the blue dots indicate that the substances are present in the AP6/AP1 samples; the
  purple dots indicate that the substances are present in both samples.
