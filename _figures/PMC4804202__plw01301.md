caption: 'Simplified version of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway showing the production
  of the three major types of anthocyanin pigments (the glycosides of anthocyanidins):
  those derived from pelargonidin (mainly red), from cyanidin (mainly purple) and
  from delphinidin (mainly blue). These are distinguished by their level of hydroxylation:
  one B-ring hydroxyl group for pelargonidin, two for cyanidin, three for delphinidin.
  Arrows indicate enzymatic reactions with enzymes shown in boxes, and products and
  precursors outside of boxes. ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase;
