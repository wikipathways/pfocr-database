caption: Schematic view of the sporopollenin synthesis pathway in Arabidopsis and
  peach. Arabidopsis proteins involved in sporopollenin synthesis and deposition,
  and the transcriptional regulation of late anther development are shown in black.
  Peach putative orthologs of the genes coding for these proteins are shown in green
  (cluster A and non-clustered genes with earlier expression) and red (cluster B with
  later expression). Discontinuous arrows indicate transcriptional interactions. This
  figure has been adapted from  [].
