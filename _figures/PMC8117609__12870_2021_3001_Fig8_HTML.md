caption: Response mechanism of ginseng to rusty root symptoms. “?” means not validated;
  The solid arrows indicate the direct action and the dotted arrows indicate the indirect
  action. Environmental stress induces oxidative stress, which activates the ETI system
  and stimulates the synthesis of SA, MeJA, and ABA in ginseng tissues. SA and MeJA
  induce the accumulation of phenolic, alkaloid, and alcohol metabolites. SA and MeJA
  also induce lipid and fatty acid metabolism and enhance membrane stability against
  stress. The production of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT and SOD and the peroxisome
  regulation affect ROS accumulation in tissues. Meanwhile, DEGs in PTI and ETI in
  ginseng epidermal tissues may promote PR proteins' production and hypersensitive
  responses against external stresses. The activation of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
  pathway enhances the production of phenolic metabolites on the one hand. It may
  increase the accumulation of lignin and promote the cell wall's reinforcement on
  the other hand. The reinforcement of the cell wall and the enhancement of membrane
  stability together constitute a physical defense in ginseng tissues
