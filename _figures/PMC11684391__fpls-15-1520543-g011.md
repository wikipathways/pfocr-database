caption: Mechanism of flavonoid synthesis in blue-grained wheat under UV-B. The figure
  is based on the flavonoid synthesis pathway, labelled as constructed by key nodes
  of metabolites and genes in colored wheat under UV-B irradiation, with key enzyme
  cleavage sites in blue font, and the red color of the gene heatmap of the enzyme
  cleavage sites representing higher gene expression, and the metabolites in the flavonoid
  synthesis pathway in black, with the degree of redness representing the higher metabolite
  content. FLS, flavonol synthase; CYP75A, flavonoid 3’, 5’-hydroxylase; CYP73A, trans-cinnamate
  4-monooxygenase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavonoid3’-hydroxylase; ANS, Anthocyanidin
  synthase; DFR, Dihydroflavonol reductase
