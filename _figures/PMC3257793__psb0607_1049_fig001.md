caption: Schematic representation of IKK/NκFB-like signaling pathway regulating NO
  levels in tomato seedlings. The sites of action of the pharmacological inhibitors
  as derived from existing mammalian models are indicated. The putative role of native
  SHR as a repressor of a NFκB-like molecule is also indicated. The mutation in shr
  presumably results in the removal of this negative regulator thereby resulting in
  the constitutive transcriptional activation of a NOS-like enzyme. The increase in
  NOS-like activity leads to increase in NO levels in the mutant resulting in inhibition
  of root elongation.
