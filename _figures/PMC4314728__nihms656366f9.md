caption: A schematic of the signaling pathways activated by the P2Y2R in endothelial
  cells that are thought to regulate vascular permeability. After activation by ATP
  or UTP, P2Y2R migrates to the cell-cell adherens junctions and transiently associates
  with VEGFR-2 and VE-cadherin, which are phosphorylated via a Src-dependent pathway.
  The kinase Src also phosphorylates VE-cadherin-bound p120 catenin, and possibly
  β- and γ-catenins as well, to further disrupt the adherens junctions. p120 then
  associates with the GEF vav2, activating Rac1, which is likely to induce cytoskeletal
  rearrangements to further facilitate the passage of macromolecules or leukocytes
  through the endothelial intercellular space. Grey ovals represent the phosphorylation
  sites, catenins are represented by light blue ovals and heterotrimeric G protein
  subunits are represented by pink circles.
