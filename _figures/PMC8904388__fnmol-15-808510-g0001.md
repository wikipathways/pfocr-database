caption: Downstream effectors and signaling pathways of neuronal cAMP. PKA, Epac,
  and CNG channels are the main downstream effectors of cAMP. The PKA holoenzyme has
  two regulatory (R) subunits and two catalytic (C) subunits. Each R subunit includes
  two cAMP-binding sites in the carboxy terminus. The C subunits are globular proteins
  that are responsible for ATP binding and peptide catalysis. When cAMP occupies the
  binding sites, the R subunits change their conformation and reduce the affinity
  with the C subunits. The PKA holoenzyme then dissociates into four subunits, and
  the disaggregated C subunits phosphorylate substrate proteins, such as the transcription
  factor cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB). pCREB recruits CBP/P300,
  which has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and facilitates gene transcription.
  In neurons, several downstream genes are involved in axonal regrowth, including
  arginase I (Arg I), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), interleukin-6
  (IL-6), and metallothionein I/II. Unlike PKA, which is a tetramer, Epac is a monomer
  in which the regulatory region sterically hinders the catalytic site to maintain
  an auto-inhibitory mode. The binding of cAMP induces a conformational change and
  promotes the removal of the regulatory lobe from the catalytic lobe, which exposes
  the GEF domain and allows the binding of Rap1. After binding Epac, Rap1 releases
  GDP to bind GTP and activates signaling cascades such as B-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt/PKB
  pathways. Activated PKA and Epac share similar downstream signaling pathways, including
  phosphorylating CREB and inhibiting the Rho-ROCK pathway. The tetrameric CNG channels
  anchored on the cell membrane are usually closed but undergo conformational changes
  after binding cAMP, leading to ion influx and biological reactions.

  description: Downstream effectors and signaling pathways of neuronal cAMP. PKA,
    Epac, and CNG channels are the main downstream effectors of cAMP. The PKA holoenzyme
    has two regulatory (R) subunits and two catalytic (C) subunits. Each R subunit
