caption: MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway of ginkgolides in the regulation of IIR.
  Lipopolysaccharide stimulates the dimerization of TLR4 and activates the conserved
  MAPK tertiary kinase cascade through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase,
  which leads to the activation of transcription factors. Finally, it promotes the
  expression of inflammatory factors in target cells, thus participating in the inflammatory
  reaction process induced by lipopolysaccharide. As shown in the figure, ginkgolides
  have effects on MAPK and TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB signaling transduction pathway. It can
  down-regulate MyD88, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1, IκB kinases,
  IκBα, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, extracellular signal-regulated
  JNK, and p38, ultimately reducing inflammation. MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; IIR, inflammatory immune response; MyD88,
