caption: Signaling networks induced in the spleen at 1 day post infection in wild-type
  mice (A) and STAT1 KO mice (B). Gene lists of significantly (fold change <2, p < 0.05)
  differentially expressed transcripts were used to construct functional signaling
  networks on the basis of know interactions using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  software. Only direct interactions were used to construct networks and only pathways
  with scores >5 (p < 10-5) were included in the merged networks.
