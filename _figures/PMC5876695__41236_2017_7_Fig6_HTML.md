caption: Meta-network illustrating synergistic interventions and resistance mechanisms
  to PI3K inhibitors. The colored rectangles correspond to the pathways introduced
  in Fig. , and the edges between them represent aggregated regulatory relationships
  between pathways. In these relationships, and also when referring to a pathway as
  active or inactive, we focus on the index (named) member of the pathway. Thus, when
  saying that the mTORC1 pathway is active we mean that mTORC1, EIF4F and S6K are
  active, TSC and PRAS40 are inactive. Thick continuous lines indicate active pathways/interactions,
  thick and dashed lines represent partially active pathways/interactions, thin and
  dashed lines mean inactive pathways/interactions. For the node names indicated inside
  the colored rectangles, blue indicates inhibition/inactivity and red indicates increased
  activity. a Signaling pathway activity in response to PI3K inhibition. ER signaling
  is still active (partly due to the release of its inhibition by AKT), while the
  apoptosis and proliferation pathways are partially active. Inhibition of the nodes
  indicated in blue font or constitutive activity of Rb is predicted to have a synergistic
  effect with PI3K inhibition. b Resistance mechanisms to PI3K inhibitors. Sustained
  activity of the nodes indicated with red font inside each pathway can (at least
  partially) restore the pathway’s activation and obstruct the effectiveness of PI3K
  inhibition. Sustained inactivity of the nodes indicated with blue font can have
  a similar effect. For simplicity, the HER2/HER3 resistance mechanism is not included
  in a separate RTK module but as part of the pathways activated by HER2/HER3, namely
  MAPK and PI3K
