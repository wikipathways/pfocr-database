caption: 'Concentrations of different sugars in litchi leaves during floral induction.
  a Dynamic changes in content of different sugars during low temperature induction.
  Bars represent the standard error (n = 3). * and ** for same time represented significant
  difference at 0.05 and 0.01 levels. b Simplified scheme of the sugar metabolism
  pathway. Key enzyme names in green color were abbreviated as follow: HK: hexokinase,
  SS: starch synthase, GBSS: granule-bound starch synthase, PFK: phosphofructokinase,
  SPS: sucrose phosophate synthase, SUS: sucrose synthase. The expression patterns
  are indicated on the side of each key gene, with the upside representing the relative
  log10 (RPKM + 1) respectively. The grids with different colors from green to red
  show the relative expression magnitude. Low temperature (15 °C, black circles) and
  the control (25 °C, white circles) leaves sampled at different time were used in
  the analysis'
