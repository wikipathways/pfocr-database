caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis cancer network from RNA-Seq breast cancer samples.
  The molecules color represents the expression levels: green/red stands for under/overexpressed
  in cancer samples respectively. Blue/orange color indicates a predicted inhibition/activation
  of the molecule respectively. Blue and orange lines are depicted with the same color
  code. Molecules color intensity is presented in log2 FC scale. Notice that molecules
  in the extracellular space are underexpressed, whereas the inner components, in
  particular those that belong to the nucleus are overexpressed.'
