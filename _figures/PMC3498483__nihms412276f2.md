caption: A schematic representation of the crosstalk between classical and non-classical
  mechanisms in female reproductive behavior. Classical mechanism of action by progesterone-
  and ring-A class of progestins, mediated by classical PRs, promotes interactions
  with coactivators and plays a predominant role. Progesterone effects mediated by
  second messengers (cAMP, cGMP) and extra-nuclear signaling kinases (PKA, PKC, PKG,
  CaMKII) activates MAPK signal transduction cascade, phosphorylation of nuclear transcription
  factors, PRs/ PR coactivators and CREB. Progesterone and progestins, can act via
  the Src kinase, interact with extra-nuclear PRs to activate MAPK cascade. Progesterone
  acting via the extra-nuclear PKA/MAPK/DARPP-32 pathway can cause a decrease in phosphatase
  activity and an increase in phosphorylation of PR and/or its coactivators. Mating
  stimuli (VCS), dopamine or other neurotransmitters can stimulate PKA activation,
  phosphorylates DARPP-32, leading to the activation of CREB/PR/coactivators. VCS-stimulated
  PKA activation can also interact with MAPK cascade. Neuropeptides, nucleotides,
  growth factors, GnRH and PGE2 can act through various receptor- and/or second messengers
  (cAMP, cGMP, NO) and transmit signals to the nuclear PRs or other transcription
  factors. Interactions between multiple pathways may serve as an amplification mechanism
  to converge on nuclear transcription factors and/or coactivators to regulate gene
  transcription and translation, to facilitate female sex behavior.
