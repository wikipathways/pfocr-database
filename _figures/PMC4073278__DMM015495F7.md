caption: Schematic of the changes that are induced in cells by a deficiency of RPs.
  The nascent rRNA cannot be processed correctly in the absence of some RPs, which
  hypothetically leads to replication stress and DNA damage. Alongside this stress,
  global changes in nucleotide metabolism arise from (i) the necessity to catabolise
  defective rRNAs; (ii) the need to produce more rRNAs; (iii) the need to produce
  more dNTPs for DNA repair; (iv) the decreased availability of ATP and precursors
  for biosynthesis, caused by suppressed glycolysis; and (v) ADA activity destroying
  ATP. Altogether, metabolism perturbations lead to dNTP imbalance and ATP depletion.
  These factors can further exacerbate replication stress and DNA damage. The pattern
  of p53 phosphorylation that we observed is consistent with inputs from several kinases
  from the ATR-ATM-Chk1-Chk2 pathway. In addition, the activation of AMPK, caused
  by low ATP levels, can contribute to p53 activation. During replication stress and
  DNA damage, ATR kinase activates RNR (de novo pathway) to increase production of
  dNTPs, which are necessary for DNA repair. At the same time, ATM kinase activates
  the salvage enzyme DCK to produce more dNTPs through salvage pathways. Salvage pathways
  are barely used in healthy cells, but for stressed cells they are much more important,
  as illustrated by the increased incorporation of radioactively labeled deoxycytidine
  into the DNA of zebrafish that are deficient in RPs. Exogenous nucleosides rescue
  cells that are deficient in RPs by decreasing replication stress through providing
  additional dNTPs for DNA repair.
