caption: 'MTA metabolism in R. palustris. (Blue) Oxygen-independent MTA-isoprenoid
  shunt MSP, which functions aerobically (this study) and likely anaerobically ().
  (Green) Aerobic DHAP-methanethiol shunt MSP (this study). (Gray) Anaerobic DHAP-ethylene
  shunt MSP (). Note that it is likely the same putative unknown alcohol dehydrogenase
  (adh) which functions both aerobically in the MTA-methanethiol shunt and anaerobically
  in the MTA-ethylene shunt MSPs. However, this step could be catalyzed by different
  enzymes in the two different scenarios. Compounds were as follows: 5-(methylthio)ribose-1-P
  (MTR-1P), 5-(methylthio)ribulose-1-P (MTRu-1P), 1-(methylthio)xylulose-5-P (MTXu-5P),
  2-(methylthio)acetaldehyde (MT-adh), 2-(methylthio)ethanol (MT-EtOH), 1-deoxyxylulose-5-P
  (DXP), glutathione (GSH), S-methylthio-glutathione (GS-MT), O-acetyl-l-homoserine
  (OAHS), acetate (OAc). γ-Glutamyl cycle, metabolism of glutathione adducts is initiated
  by γ-glutamyl transferase, resulting in recovery of glutamate, glycine, and cysteine,
  which are utilized to regenerate glutathione; the product has been observed to be
  constitutively expressed in R. rubrum, and the pathway is a proposed route for methanethiol
  release from S-methylthio-glutathione ().'
