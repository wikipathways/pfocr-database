caption: Major components of the TGF-ß signaling pathway. TGF-ß secreted from monocytes,
  macrophages, lymphocytes and fibroblasts is sequestered in the extracellular matrix
  in a biologically inactive latent form. Latent TGF-ß activation is catalyzed by
  αvß6 integrin on epithelial cell membranes. Active TGF-ß binds to serine/threonine
  kinase cell surface receptors that phosphorylate downstream SMAD2/3. Phosphorylated
  SMAD2/3 complexes with SMAD4 and accumulates within the nucleus, where it collaborates
  with other trancription factors, and recruits cofactors such as p300 to target genes,
  resulting in transcription. SMAD7 is a TGF-ß-inducible endogenous SMAD inhibitor
  that negatively regulates TGF-ß signaling. TGF-ß can also induce cellular responses
  such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via Smad-independent pathways involving
  the kinases Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, phosphoinositide 3 (PI3) kinase, c-Abl
  and TGF-ß-activated kinase TAK1. The duration of the TGF-ß signal is regulated by
  the uptake of the TGF-ß receptor–ligand complex into caveolin-lined endosomes that
  promote degradation. Excessive TGF-ß activity, or deregulated receptor trafficking
  or intracellular SMAD signaling result in collagen overproduction and fibrosis.Abbreviation
