caption: Estrogen Receptor Signaling. The nuclear estrogen response element (ERE)
  pathway is depicted. 17β-Estradiol (E2), the predominant endogenous estrogen and
  estrogen receptor (ER) ligand, binds to the ligand binding domain (LBD/AF2) domain
  of the ER to undergo a conformational change. This conformational change enables
  the dimerization, activation, and nuclear translocation of the ER to the nucleus,
  where the ER complex binds to EREs in the promoter region of the target gene via
  the DNA-binding domain (DBD). Subsequently, this facilitates the recruitment of
  co-activators such as PCAF and CBP histone acetyltransferases and steroid coactivator-1
  (SRC-1), thus promoting various cellular activities, including cell division, survival
  and proliferation. Further, E2-bound ER can also result in non-classical genomic
  signaling where liganded ER regulates the expression of genes in an ERE-independent
  manner through the direct interaction with transcription factors, including specificity
  protein 1 (SP1), activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription complex, and the signal
  transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors.
  Without E2, ER monomers remain predominantly in the cytoplasm in an inactive (non-DNA-binding)
  state, sequestered in multiprotein chaperone complexes organized around heat shock
  proteins bound to the ER hinge domain. The activation factor 1 (AF1) domain primarily
  contributes to ligand-independent activation of the ER (43–45, 47, 48). Figure generated
