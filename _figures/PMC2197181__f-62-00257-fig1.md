caption: The multistep biosynthetic pathway in R. serpentina plant cells leading to
  the antiarrhythmic ajmaline via the intermediate vomilenine. This intermediate can
  be formed by deglucosylation of the glucoalkaloid raucaffricine, which is catalyzed
  by raucaffricine glucosidase (RG). Other enzymes involved in the pathway and whose
  three-dimensional structures have recently been elucidated are strictosidine synthase
  (STR1), strictosidine glucosidase (SG) and vinorine synthase (VS).

  X-ray analysis of raucaffricine glucosidase, a plant enzyme specifically involved
  in Rauvolfia alkaloid biosynthesis.
