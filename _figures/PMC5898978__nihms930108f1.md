caption: Phospholipases release arachidonic acid (AA) from the phospholipid membrane.
  Free AA can then be modified by the cyclooxygenase or the lipoxygenase pathway to
  produce prostaglandins and leukotrienes, respectively. During the cyclooxygenase
  pathway, to the left, COX enzymes modify AA to produce PGH2, which can then be modified
  by specific enzymes to produce PGI2, TXA2, PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α. COX enzymes can
  be blocked by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indomethacin and aspirin.
  Prostaglandins are known inhibitors of the antimicrobial function of both macrophages
  (Mϕ) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). The lipoxygenase pathway, to the right,
  leads to the production of LTA4 which can then be modified by specific enzymes to
  produce LTB4 or LTE4. Leukotrienes are known to promote Mϕ and PMN antimicrobial
  functions.
