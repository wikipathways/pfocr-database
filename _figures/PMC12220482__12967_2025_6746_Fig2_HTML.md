caption: The mechanism of NUSAP1 in cancer. A The elevated expression of NUSAP1 may
  lead to abnormal cell division and increase the instability of genes. B (1) Silencing
  the expression of NUSAP1 can inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and promote
  their apoptosis; (2) Glycosylated NUSAP1 inhibits the apoptosis of bladder cancer
  cells; (3) The high expression of NUSAP1 promotes the stem cell growth of cervical
  cancer. C Upregulation of NUSAP1 promotes the metastasis of cervical cancer cells
  by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. D The expression of NUSAP1 may
  affect the infiltration of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. MDSC myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells, TFH follicular helper T cell, NK cell natural killer cell
