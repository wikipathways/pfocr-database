caption: Dysregulated metabolic pathways related to AD pathology. Hexagonal nodes
  indicate altered metabolites in the study and circular nodes represent metabolites
  involved in the pathway not identified in the study. Color codes represent the log2
  FC values, with red representing upregulated metabolites and blue representing downregulated
  metabolites. Mapped metabolites are based on KEGG IDs. (For interpretation of the
  references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version
  of this article.)
