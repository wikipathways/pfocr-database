caption: Diagram depicting the interaction between ISL and Nrf2 that results in protection
  against pancreatic injury and intestinal dysfunction after SAP. SAP induced by cerulein
  combined with LPS, which produces oxidative stress and an inflammatory response,
  leads to pancreatic injury and intestinal disorders. ISL inhibits NF-κB activation
  through the Nrf2/NF-κB pathway to inhibit inflammation. ISL also activates Nrf2
  to inhibit oxidative stress and maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier
  thereby reducing the injury associated with SAP.
