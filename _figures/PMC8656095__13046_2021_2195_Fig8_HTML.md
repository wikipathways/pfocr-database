caption: A schematic model of mannose killing thyroid cancer cells by inhibiting cellular
  glycolysis. Mannose enters the cell and converts into mannose-6-phophate which inhibits
  the enzymes of glycolytic pathway, such as hexokinase and phosphoglucose isomerase,
  thereby hindering cellular glycolysis. However, when PMI is highly activated by
  ZIP10-mediated extracellular Zn2+ influx, mannose-6-phosphate can be converted into
  fructose-6-phosphate by PMI, promoting cellular glycolysis and malignant phenotypes
  of cancer cells. Thus, ZIP10 is a negative determinant for the response of thyroid
  cancer cells to mannose
