caption: Flow diagram illustrating the main idea of this study. Activation of signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signaling in CD11b+ cells increases
  the secretion of IL-4, promotes differentiation to M2 myeloid cell, and suppresses
  M1 polarization. M2 myeloid cells promote cancer cell proliferation and interleukin
  (IL)-4 secretion in tumor cells, which creates a positive feedback loop. IL-4 binding
  to the IL-4 receptor begins the next positive feedback loop. The black arrow indicates
  the promotive effect, and the red line indicates the suppressive effect. CD11b+
  cells are represented by the red cells among the tumor cells.
