caption: (A) Innate-like B cells, that is B-1 and marginal zone B cells, are most
  crucial for T-independent immune responses. Upon TLR ligation these cells downregulate
  integrin receptor expression, resulting in redistribution of the cells from the
  peritoneal cavity to the blood, lymph node and spleen. (B) Subsequently, B-1 and
  marginal zone B cells start to proliferate and secrete immunoglobulins and cytokines.
  Up-regulation of B cell-activating factor (BAFF) receptor expression leads to prolonged
  survival of these cells. Increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules also enables
  activated innate-like B cells to act as antigen-presenting cells, thereby linking
  T-independent and T-dependent immune responses. Most of these functional responses
  have been demonstrated to occur in response to direct TLR engagement in vitro; however,
  in vivo, these events probably require synergistic B cell receptor (BCR) and TLR
  engagement. (C) Recent data demonstrate the direct involvement of MyD88 in transmembrane
  activator and CAML interactor (TACI)-dependent nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signals.
  This can result in activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID; an enzyme that is
  required for somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination (CSR) in the germinal
  centre) expression and extrafollicular CSR, independently of T cell help. This pathway
  might also be directly activated by TLR signals, as in vitro stimulation of B cells
  with TLR ligands induces AID expression. Moreover, because TLR stimulation leads
  to upregulation of BAFF receptors, signaling via this pathway and induction of extrafollicular
  CSR might be enhanced by dual TACI and TLR engagement.
