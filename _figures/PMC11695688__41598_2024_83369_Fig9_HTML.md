caption: A simple signaling pathway diagram. FN1 plays both oncogenic and tumor suppressive
  roles combined with p53 signaling pathway owing to the alternative splicing of EDB
  domain and its subcellular location. The isoform EDB(−)FN1 intracellularly inhibited
  tumor proliferation by upregulating p21 expression, whereas extracellular EDB(+)FN1
  that was up-regulated by ZMAT3 promoted lymph node metastasis via the VEGF signaling
  pathway
