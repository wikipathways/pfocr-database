caption: A model for cell cycle reentry–mediated apoptosis. Neurotoxic signals might
  trigger aberrant activation of the MEK-ERK pathway, resulting in an increase in
  cyclin D1 levels, which can be by transcription factor STAT3. Cyclin D1 prevents
  p35-mediated cdk5 activation, which might facilitate the increase in MEK-ERK signaling
  activity. These events can contribute to cell cycle reentry of neurons, which results
  in their death.
