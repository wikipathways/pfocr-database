caption: ATM signaling pathway in response to DSBs. ATM is recruited to sites of DSBs
  by the MRN complex. At the DSB site, ATM undergoes activation through acetylation
  by TIP60 and autophosphorylation. Direct interaction between the ATM and MRN complex
  is essential for ATM activation and monomerization. Activated ATM then phosphorylate
  H2AX surrounding the DSBs, which recruits more of the MRN complex to the site and
  forms a positive feedback loop between the MRN complex and ATM. ATM phosphorylates
  and activates a number of downstream targets that are essential for DNA damage repair
  (NHEJ and HR), cell cycle inhibition, and apoptosis. DNA damages are repaired through
  either NHEJ or HR in context of the cell cycle state.
