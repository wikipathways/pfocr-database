caption: Effects of CD36 in diabetes cardiomyopathy. In healthy heart, insulin activates
  the PI3K-Akt pathway, thereby promoting the transportation of CD36 from the endosome
  to the cell membrane. At the same time, FOXO1 transcription factor promotes the
  expression of CD36. LCFA absorbed by CD36 acts as a mitochondrial substrate for
  oxidation and storage as lipids. In diabetes, increased insulin strongly activates
  the PI3K-Akt pathway, promoting more CD36 from the endosome to the cell membrane,
  and FOXO1 transcription factor also leads to a robust expression of CD36. In addition,
  down-regulated mir-200b-3p and upregulated mir-320 also accelerate the transcription
  and translation of CD36, thus further increasing the distribution of CD36 on the
  cell membrane, which facilitates the uptake of LCFA in cardiomyocytes. LCFA promotes
  the transfer of CD36 in the endosome to the cell membrane, further increasing the
  distribution of CD36 on the cell membrane. Intracellular LCFAs either enter the
  mitochondria for aerobic oxidation producing energy and the byproducts-ROS or forms
  triglycerides for energy storage, and the accumulation of triglycerides would trigger
  insulin resistance. Insulin resistance and ROS assembly deteriorate cardiac function
  and result in diabetic cardiomyopathy.
