caption: 'Hypothetical scheme describing: (a) ROS-mediated interaction of the light-harvesting
  and electron transfer machinery with hormone-responsive gene expression: (b) Abnormal
  production of ROS in various light-harvesting mutants under normal GL (stn7) and
  under HL (tap38 and npq4) conditions as described in the text. Fluent excitation
  energy transfer in the LHCII system minimizes the production of 1O2 from excited
  chlorophylls (WT). This is dependent on control over the interactions between LHCII
  with other LHC molecules, PSII and PSI (through LHCII phosphorylation), and on relaxation
  of excited chlorophylls via thermal dissipation of excitation energy (through PSBS
  protonation). The redox state of PSI depends on the availability of light energy
  and on regulation of light-harvesting efficiency and linear electron transfer (reviewed
  in []). Based on results of this study and available literature, we propose that:
  (i) the redox state of the PSI acceptor side controls H2O2 production that triggers
  the abiotic stress pathway proceeding through OPDA signalling; (ii) increased production
  of 1O2 from excited chlorophylls upregulates JA synthesis and promotes biotic stress
  responses. Under increases in light intensity, these two pathways are upregulated
  in parallel and they must be balanced by light-harvesting regulation to ensure proper
  acclimation to biotic and abiotic stresses that overlap in nature. Proper function
  of H2O2- and OPDA-based signalling is not dependent on the regulation of excitation
  energy transfer. By contrast, proper 1O2- and JA-dependent signalling is dependent
  on fluent and properly regulated excitation energy transfer and distribution, provided
  by the STN7 kinase, TAP38/PPH1 phosphatase and the PSBS protein.'
