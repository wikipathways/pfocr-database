caption: Proposed pathway of the pyomelaninlike AKU pigment based on the formation
  of benzoquinone enzymatically or by auto-oxidation and then subsequent dimerisation
  as well as alternative metabolic routes to, HGA mercaptouric acid and HGA glucuronide
  and subsequent protein binding. NB the relative proportions of these processes are
  not known (Williams et al. ; Zannoni et al. ). NB the enzyme “polyphenol oxidase”
  cited in the figure is reported in protein database as the enzyme EC:1.10.3.1, catalysing
  the oxidation of ortho- but NOT para-diphenols. Polyphenol oxidases are enzymes
  generally found in plants but not in humans, as this enzyme does not exist in the
  sequenced human genome. An enzyme able to oxidise p-diphenols is the “laccase” (EC:1.10.3.2),
  acting both on o-quinols and p-quinols and often acting also on aminophenols and
  phenylenediamine
