caption: 'Hypothesized schematic representation of the intracellular signaling cascade
  that mediates the mER-induced attenuation of ORL1 receptor- mediated spinal antinociception
  via rapid non-genomic mechanisms. Activated ORL1 receptor in the spinal cord couples
  to inhibitory G-proteins which decrease calcium channel conductance and facilitate
  receptor-operated potassium channel conductance to hyperpolarize neurons and produce
  analgesia. Estrogen-induced activation of mERs (GPR30, Gq-coupled mER, ERα, but
  not ERβ) non-genomically abolishes ORL1-mediated antinociception via (yet to be
  elucidated) intermediary signaling molecules that subsequently activate MAPK/ERK
  kinase (MEK) which phosphorylates (activates) ERK 2. ERK 2 can antagonize hyperpolarizing
  currents via one of the hypothesized mechanisms: (1) phosphorylate G-protein coupled
  inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels to decrease channel activity, (2)
  phosphorylate voltage-gated potassium channels to decrease their conductance and/or
  (3) phosphorylate the ORL1 receptor to decrease its coupling to inhibitory G-proteins
  resulting in decreased coupling of ORL1 to GIRK channels. We initially hypothesized
  mER activation-induced increase in PKA or PKC activation could potentially regulate
  hyperpolarizing currents via ERα and GPR30 activation coupling to Gαs proteins that
  activate adenyl cyclase (AC) which produces cAMP, the regulatory molecule for protein
  kinase A (PKA) activation; and Gq-mER coupling to Gαq proteins, which activate the
  phospholipase C (PLC) pathway to increase intracellular calcium and activate protein
  kinase C (PKC). However, our data suggests that mER activation abolishes ORL1-mediated
  spinal antinociception via a PKA and PKC-independent mechanism. Taken together,
  activation of mER can decrease or abolish the ORL1-mediated hyperpolarization of
  dorsal horn neurons leading to reduction or abolition of ORL1-mediated analgesia.
