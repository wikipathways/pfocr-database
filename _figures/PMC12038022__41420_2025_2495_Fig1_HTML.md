caption: Cysteine is imported through the excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3)
  and the alanine, serine, and cysteine transporter (ASCT). Its oxidized form cystine
  is transported by the transporter system xc−. Once inside the cell, cystine is rapidly
  reduced to cysteine by thioredoxin reductase 1 (TRR1) or glutathione (GSH). Cysteine
  is consumed via various metabolic pathways such as protein synthesis and the production
  of sulfur-containing molecules such as glutathione, taurine, lanolinothioneine,
  coenzyme A, and the gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Methionine
  is converted to cysteine via sulfur transformation. This figure was created with
