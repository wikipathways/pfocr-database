caption: A schematic model representation of the proposed mechanism of ebselen on
  FAC-induced iron overload associated with senescent-like neuronal cells, SH-SY5Y.
  FAC facilitates an increased intracellular iron levels via DMT1, the main pathway
  responsible for cellular iron uptake in neurons. Subsequently, increasing intracellular
  ROS formation via the Fenton reaction that mediates proinflammatory cytokine release
  leads to the damage of mitochondrial membrane and DNA. Excessive intracellular iron
  levels are undoubtedly one of the main causes of cellular senescence, leading to
  organismal aging. Ebselen is a DMT1 inhibitor that could decrease intracellular
  iron levels by increasing the expression of FPN1 iron exporter and decreasing FT-L
  iron storage. Furthermore, ebselen could rescue neuronal senescence by reducing
  ROS levels and by improving ΔΨm and cellular senescence markers, including SA-β-gal,
  SASP profile, and p53/p21 via inhibiting the mTORC1 signaling pathway.
