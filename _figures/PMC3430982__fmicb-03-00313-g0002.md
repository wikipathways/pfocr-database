caption: Numerous biomonomers can now be produced as a result of metabolic and pathway
  engineering; examples discussed in this review are depicted here. “Boxed” names
  signify molecules that have been produced directly from renewable resources, whereas
  others have been produced via a hybrid, biocatalytic-chemocatalytic approach.
