caption: 'Components of canonical Wnt signaling pathway: FZD (frizzled), transmembrane
  receptor for Wnt ligand; DSH (dishevelled), transduces the Wnt signal to the cytoplasm;
  APC (adenomatosis polyposis coli), promotes the degradation of β-catenin; GSK3β
  (glycogen synthase kinase 3β), constitutively active protein kinase targeting β-catenin
  for degradation; Axin, component of β-catenin destruction complex; β-catenin, key
  mediator of canonical Wnt-signaling pathway. Components of canonical Hh-signaling
  pathway: Ptch (patched), transmembrane receptor for Hh ligands; Smo (smoothened),
  transmembrane receptor associated with Ptch and transducing Hh signal; Sufu (suppressor
  of fused homologue), negative regulator of Hh signaling; Gli (glioma-associated
  oncogene homologue), key transcription factor downstream of Hh signaling; GliA,
  active form of Gli that binds to DNA and serves as a transcriptional activator.
  (ii) Emerging proteins/pathways. Components of Sema3-Nrp signaling: Sema3 (Semaphorin
  3), a member of a secreted ligand family; Nrps (neuropilins), transmembrane receptors
  for Sema3; PDE4D (phosphodiesterase 4D), translocating to cell membrane when recruited
  by Nrps; PKA (protein kinase A), cross-talk with Hh signaling through Gli. LSD1
  (lysine demethylase 1), physically interacting with methylated lysines and Gfi1.
  HDAC (histone deacetylase) and BET (bromodomain and extraterminal domain), physically
  interacting with acetylated lysines. FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription),
  a histone chaperone to promote H2A/H2B dimer dissociation from the nucleosome and
  allow RNA polymerase II transcription on chromatin. PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase),
  controlling Akt phosphorylation and activation status; Akt (protein kinase B), controlling
  mTOR phosphorylation and activation status; mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin),
  key regulator downstream of PI3K-signaling. CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase), controlling
  the phosphorylation status of retinoblastoma. CK2 (casein kinase 2), involving p53
  and MAPK phosphorylation status. Chk1 (checkpoint kinase 1), controlling Cdc25A
  phosphorylation status. ROCK (Rho-associated protein kinase), key regulator of Rho/ROCK-signaling,
  controlling MYPT1, MLC and LIMK1/2 phosphorylation status. Wee1, controlling Chk1/2
  phosphorylation status. Src, controlling a wide range of protein phosphorylation,
  including PI3K. DDX3, a member of RNA helicase. PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase),
  interacting with single and double-strand DNA breaks. Sp1 (specific protein 1 transcription
  factor), binding to GC-boxes, CACCC-boxes and basic transcription elements. HMGCR
  (β-hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), a key component of the mevalonate pathway
  that envolving a number of essential cellular functions. ABC (ATP-binding cassette)
  transporter, responsible for the translocation of multiple substrates across membranes.
  COX-2 (cyclooxygenases 2), envolves in tumor cells apoptosis and cell growth. DNA
  polymerases, catalyzes the synthesis of DNA molecules from nucleoside triphosphates.
  PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase enhances anticancer
  immunity. mGPD (mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase), a component of the
  glycerophosphate shuttle.'
