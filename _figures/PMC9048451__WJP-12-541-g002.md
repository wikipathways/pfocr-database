caption: 'Neurotransmission in dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic neurons.
  Each pathway step is supplemented with associated genes according to KEGG. A: Dopaminergic
  pathway. Dopamine is synthesized from tyrosine through two steps: (1) Tyrosine hydroxylase
  catalyzes the tyrosine to L-DOPA by hydroxylation; and (2) L-DOPA converts to dopamine
  by DOPA decarboxylase (DDC). Dopamine can be stored into synaptic vesicles by the
  vesicular monoamine transporters and release to the synaptic cleft. Dopamine as
  a neurotransmitter, can directly bind to its receptor to activate downstream signaling
  cascades and influence cell survival, synaptic plasticity, and gene transcription.
  Besides, dopamine also can be transported back to the presynaptic membrane by the
  DAT and eliminated. DRD2, an auto-receptor, can inhibit the release of dopamine
  in the presynaptic membrane; B: Serotoninergic (5-HTergic) pathway. The synthesis
  of 5-HT needs two enzymes: Tryptophan hydroxylase and DDC. After synthesizing, 5-HT
  can be transported into synaptic vesicles and release to the synaptic cleft. Some
  of the 5-HT directly binds to its receptors (e.g., HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2A, HTR4, and
  HTR6), activates downstream signaling pathway to activate ion channels, and influences
  synaptic plasticity and gene expressions, and others are re-uptaken into the presynaptic
  membrane by the serotonin transporter; C: Glutamatergic pathway. Glutamate is converted
  from glutamine by phosphate-activated glutaminase in mitochondria and packaged into
  synaptic vesicles by vesicular glutamate transporters. Sequentially, the glutamate
  is released to the synaptic cleft and binds to the glutamate receptors, and then
  activates the downstream pathway or is repacked into presynaptic membrane by excitatory
  amino acid transporters. Signaling cascade activation might lead to the change of
  neural excitability and finally has effects on long-term potentiation or long-term
  depression. MAO: Monoamine oxidase; COMT: Catechol O-methyltransferase; 3-MT: 3-Methoxytyramine;
  HVA: Homovanillic acid; 5-HIAA: 5-Hydroxy indole acetic acid; EAATs: Excitatory
  amino acid transporters; 5-HT: Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine; GPCR: G protein-coupled
  receptor; GLS: Glutaminase; NMDA: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; AMPA: α-Amino-3hydroxy-5methyl-4-isox-azolepropionic
