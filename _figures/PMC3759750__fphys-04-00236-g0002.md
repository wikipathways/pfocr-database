caption: Regulation of prosurvival and apoptotic pathways by ER stress. Cells cope
  with ER stress by activating the unfolded protein response. This response is mediated
  via the dissociation of BiP from three ER transmembrane proteins IRE1α, PERK, and
  ATF6. Following dissociation of BiP, IRE1α becomes activated and induces splicing
  of XBP1 mRNA to XBP1s. IRE1α also activates JNK via TRAF2 and ASK1. Furthermore,
  activation of IRE1α has been linked to downstream NF-κB activation and RIDD, which
  can lead to the degradation of prosurvival mRNA. Finally, IRE1α controls the activation
  of the caspases signaling pathway. Like IRE1α, PERK becomes activated following
  BiP dissociation. Active PERK mediates its response via phosphorylation of eIF2α
  leading to a translational block and cap independent translation of ATF4. ATF4 induces
  CHOP which has multiple downstream targets that stimulate apoptosis and cell death.
  Following BiP dissociation, ATF6 is transported to the Golgi where it is cleaved
  into an active transcription factor. ATF6 regulates the expression of several genes
  involved in the unfolded protein response such as XBP1, CHOP, BiP, PDI, and EDEM1.
