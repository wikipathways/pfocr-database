caption: Illustration of AHR activity in pituitary cells. The AHR may act through
  two pathways in the pituitary cells which can either be distinct in activity or
  influence each other by sequestering AHR protein. Pathway 1 illustrates the standard
  canonical xenobiotic signaling by AHR which is activated by exogenous or endogenous
  ligands to translocate to the nucleus together with ARNT and transcribe target genes
  such as CYP1A1, AHR among others. The second pathway involves the influence of AHR
  on cell cycle regulators. Through its interaction with Rb protein, AHR is able to
  maintain it in its hypo-phosphorylated state where it inhibits E2F activity and
  hence represses cell cycle progression. Alternatively, AHR may also increase expression
  of CDKN1A and CDKN1B genes resulting in increased p21 and p27 protein levels which
  also repress cyclin/CDK activity and maintain the hypo-phosphorylated state of Rb,
  thereby also reducing cell cycle progression.
