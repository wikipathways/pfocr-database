caption: Illustration of the bionic dormant body timed-triggering to treatment PD
  by suppressing p38MAPK/NF-κB-mediated signaling pathway in microglia [284]. aL.
  plantarum is coated with L30D-55 and taken orally to avoid the insult of gastric
  fluid and decipher in the intestine. b GABA synthesized by L. plantarum in the intestine
  enters the brain by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reduces neuroinflammation
  by inhibiting the p38MAPK/NF-κB-mediated signaling pathway in the microglia to rescue
  the loss of dopaminergic neurons for treatment PD. Copyright © 2022, American Chemical
