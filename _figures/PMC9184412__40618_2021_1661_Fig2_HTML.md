caption: A Main molecular signalling pathways induced by dopamine and DAs. Dopamine
  (or DAs) binding to D1-like and D2-like receptors, via interaction with Gαs or Gαi/o
  proteins, stimulates or inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, cyclic AMP (cAMP)
  and protein kinase A (PKA), modulates K+ channels and Ca2+ currents in an opposite
  manner, regulating hormone secretive effects in neuroendocrine cells. D2-like receptors
  activation modulates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) increasing apoptosis
  and inhibiting cell growth. Moreover, D2-like receptors are involved in receptor
  desensitization and degradation signals recruiting β-arrestin via GRKs and protein
  kinase C (PKC) activation. B Main molecular signalling pathways specifically triggered
  by D2 receptor (D2S and D2L) and D5 receptors. D2S activation induces hormone secretion
  inhibition by the suppression of AC activity, cAMP and PKA. However, in lactotroph
  cells, extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
  pathways are oppositely regulated by D2S and D2L, with D2S stimulating both and
  D2L inhibiting both pathways involved in cell growth, proliferation, and lactotroph
  homeostasis. D2 receptor is also involved in apoptotic process through the activation
  of ERK1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and early growth response protein 1 (EGR1),
  and specifically by D2S via p38 MAPK. Cell proliferation and growth are also inhibited
  by the induction of autophagic dependent cell death triggered by D5 receptor via
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. (Created with BioRender.com)
