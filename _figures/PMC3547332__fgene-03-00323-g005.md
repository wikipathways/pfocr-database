caption: MicroRNA involvement in the inflammation, innate immunity, and oxidative
  stress pathways in AD and cancer. This pathway has been validated by several studies
  in AD; however, additional evidence from cancer research points to more molecules
  which may be involved. Blue lines indicate interactions and effects found in AD
  research, orange lines indicate interactions and effects found in cancer research,
  and black lines indicate findings common to both diseases. Dashed lines indicate
  downstream effects.
