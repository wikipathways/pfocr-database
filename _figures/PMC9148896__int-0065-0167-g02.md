caption: Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and the treatment strategies
  for COVID-19 pandemic. An infected person with COVID-19 can infect another person
  through their respiratory droplets, sneezing, and coughing. The SARS-CoV-2 life
  cycle includes (1) binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2 receptor on the
  host cell's surface with the aid of the host protease enzyme TMPRSS2; (2) virus
  entry by fusion with the plasma membrane or by endocytosis mediated by endosome
  formation; (3) translation of the viral machinery of replication at cytoplasmic
  membranes; (4, 5) genomic and sub-genomic mRNA transcription through coordinated
  processes of continuous/discontinuous RNA synthesis determined by the viral replicase
  and mediated by viral proteases (e.g., 3CLpro and PLpro) and RdRP; (6) translation
  of structural and nonstructural proteins by viral-encoded enzymes and host cell
  machinery; (7) virions components are assembled at the ERGIC and obtain their membrane
  envelope; and (8) viruses are directed through the host secretory pathway and released
  by budding from the plasma membrane. The treatment options for COVID-19 include
  (a) viral entry and membrane fusion inhibitors (e.g., umifenovir, camostat mesylate,
  ACEi, ARBs, rhACE2, hydroxychloroquine); (b) protease inhibitors (e.g., LPV/r, darunavir/cobicistat,
  and disulfiram); (c) RdRp inhibitors (e.g., RDV, favipiravir, and ribavirin); and
  (d) immunomodulatory agents (e.g., tocilizumab and sarilumab, anakinra, nitazoxanide,
  thalidomide, and corticosteroid). Blue arrows for the subsequent step and a red
  “T” sign for inhibition. ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi intermediate compartment.
