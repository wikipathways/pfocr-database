caption: 'Karrikins may regulate seed germination and hypocotyl elongation by affecting
  endogenous phytohormones crosstalk. A hypothesis about the interaction between KARs
  and endogenous phytohormones: KARs can accelerate seed germination by enhancing
  GA biosynthesis. At the same time, KARs may inhibit the signals of ABA and IAA.
  In the following process of seedling establishment, KARs showed significant promotion
  effect and the expression of IAA1 was down-regulated. It indicates that KARs may
  promote seedling establishment by inhibiting the IAA signaling pathway. In the gray
  block schemes, the components of the three phytohormones signaling pathway are showed.
  They are all composed of biosynthesis genes, phytohormones, receptors, E3 ligases,
  repressors, transcription factors and response genes.'
