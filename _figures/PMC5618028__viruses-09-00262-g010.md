caption: 'A schematic model of dengue 2 virus (DENV2) infection in mosquito cells,
  showing the PERK-mediated modulating web involved in dynamic protein synthesis,
  cell survival and virus replication in cells derived from the mosquito vector. Virus-induced
  unfolded protein response (UPR) generally activates the PERK signal pathway. Subsequently,
  global cellular proteins are shut down via impairment of the recruitment of ribosomes
  binding to the mRNA 5′-cap structure. In the meantime, reduction of endoplasmic
  reticular (ER) stress helps infected cells survive continuous amplification of the
  virus as a result of activating antioxidant defense and anti-apoptotic effects.
  Yellow: virus infection initiates the UPR and its downstream pathway; Light green:
  Cellular response to the virus-induced UPR; Light red: Cell fate in response to
  virus infection; Orange red: Protein translation regulation by the virus infection.'
