caption: Potential roles of BLM and its interaction partners in human cells Schematic
  diagram indicating alternative pathways for the repair of stalled replication forks
  that arise as a result of DNA damage. Leading and lagging strand synthesis is shown
  in green and blue, respectively. (a–c) Following fork blockage, RAD51 recombinase
  can promote strand exchange between paired sisters, such that the DNA synthesis
  can bypass the damage in the leading strand by use of the sister chromatid. (c,d)
  The resulting recombination intermediate may then be dissociated by BLM–TopoIIIα
  to give rise to a noncrossover product. (e) Alternatively, BLM could promote fork
  regression to produce a chicken foot structure, or HJ, with the newly synthesized
  strands annealed with each other. (f) The newly synthesized strand from the undamaged
  parental strand can then serve as a template for lesion bypass. (d) The HJ may then
  be dissociated back to a replication fork allowing replication to continue. (g)
  A further possibility is that the 5′-end of the newly synthesized single-strand
  of DNA could fold back and reanneal to its original parental strand. DNA synthesis
  and branch migration could also give rise to dHJs (h), which in turn can be dissociated
  by BLM complex back to a replication fork structure without crossover formation
  (d). On the other hand, in the absence of a functional BLM complex, HJs formed by
  either fork regression (e) or by RAD51-dependent strand exchange reactions (c) could
  be resolved by HJ resolvases leading to DSB formation, which in turn can be repaired
  by homologous recombination to restore the replication fork with crossover (i).
  The involvement of BLM in each pathway is indicated, as are the potential roles
  of BLM interacting proteins (red). In some cases, the roles of BLM-interacting proteins
  are unknown (gray).

  description: Potential roles of BLM and its interaction partners in human cells
    Schematic diagram indicating alternative pathways for the repair of stalled replication
