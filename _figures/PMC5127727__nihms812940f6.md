caption: G3M9-DLO, the oligosaccharide donor for protein N-glycosylation, is synthesized
  in the ER in a multi-step, topologically split pathway. The first 7 steps convert
  dolichyl-P (dol-P) to M5-DLO on the cytoplasmic face of the ER. Then, M5-DLO is
  flipped into the ER lumen and extended in 7 further steps to G3M9-DLO. The sugar
  donors for these luminal reactions are MPD and GPD that are synthesized on the cytoplasmic
  face of the ER and must be flipped to the luminal side. In addition to its role
  in N-glycan biosynthesis, MPD is required in the ER lumen for GPI anchor biosynthesis,
  O-mannosylation, and C-mannosylation. Oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) transfers
  the oligosaccharide from G3M9-DLO to Asn residues within glycosylation sequences
  in translocating proteins as they emerge from the translocon into the ER lumen.
  The dolichyl-PP product of the OST reaction is recycled. The multistep synthesis
  and transfer of the oligosaccharide require at least 40 gene products.
