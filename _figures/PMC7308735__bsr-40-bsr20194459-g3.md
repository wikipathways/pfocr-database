caption: (A) Pathways linking GPNMB and COPD as reconstructed from analysis of previous
  literature. (B) Partial mega-analysis of the expression levels of the genes included
  in the reconstructed pathways. (C) Control mega-analysis of the expression levels
  of the genes included in the reconstructed pathways performed on datasets excluded
  from partial mega-analysis. The pathways in (A) was generated in Pathway Studio
  environment (www.pathwaystudio.com). Each relation (edge) in the figure has one
  or more supporting references. The colorbar is for the panels (B) and (C) only.
  Red represents increased expression level, and blue decreased.
