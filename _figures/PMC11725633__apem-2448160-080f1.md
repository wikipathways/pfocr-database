caption: Fatty acid metabolism in T cells. Free fatty acids enter immune cells either
  directly through simple diffusion or via CD36. Once inside the cell, fatty acids
  bind to proteins such as fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) that facilitate their
  transport. Alternatively, fatty acids can signal directly through cell surface receptors
  known as free fatty acid receptors (FFARs), where short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
  are known to act on FFAR2 and FFAR3, while MCFAs and LCFAs act on FFAR1 and FFAR4.
  Within the cell, (1) fatty acids enter the mitochondria via CPT1, where they undergo
  fatty acid oxidation (FAO), are broken down into acetyl-CoA, and enter the TCA cycle
  to produce adenosine triphosphate. (2) Fatty acids can also be incorporated into
  plasma membranes such as ER or cell membranes, regulating their fluidity or interaction
  with other cellular components. (3) Within T cells, fatty acids are modified by
  many different enzymes (e.g., ACC1, FAS, SCD) to form a wide variety of lipids such
  as phosphatidic acid (PA), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and phosphatidylinositol
  bisphosphate (PIP2). Fatty acids are modified by enzymes like desaturases to produce
  diverse lipid forms. All intermediates and products generated during intracellular
  fatty acid metabolism can epigenetically, structurally, or through specific signaling
  pathways, induce various changes in T cells. This positions fatty acids as novel
  mediators of immune diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancer. SCFA, shortchain
