  lipolytica. Mevalonate pathway genes (upstream of GGPP) are naturally present in
  Y. lipolytica. Phytoene, lycopene, and β-carotene are synthesized by expression
  of genes encoding heterologous enzymes McCarRP and McCarB. Synthetized βcarotene
  is stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, along with triacylglycerols (TAG),
  transported to peroxisomes [32]. (A) PaCrtZ_KDEL protein targeting ER; (B) PaCrtZ_SKL
  protein targeting peroxisome; (C) Two PaCrtZ_RIDD and one PaCrtZ_RIAD proteins creating
  PaCrtZ_DAD multienzyme homotrimer complex; (D) unmodified cytosolic PaCrtZ protein.
  Ac-CoA: acetyl coenzyme-A; pyr: pyruvate; MVA pathway: mevalonate pathway; GGPP:
  geranylgeranyl diphosphate; McCarRP: bifunctional phytoene synthase/lycopene cyclase
  from Mucor circinelloides; McCarB: phytoene dehydrogenase from M. circinelloides;
  LD: lipid droplets (filled with βcarotene); β-ox: β-oxidation; TCA: the citric acid
  cycle (the Krebs cycle)'
