  profiling data (U133plus2.0) from 10 normal colon mucosas were compared to those
  from 118 MSS colon adenocarcinomas. Transcripts of KRT23, DACH1, and CEBPB were
  strongly upregulated in MSS tumors (red), while SMAD3 and CDKN1A (p21/CIP) were
  downregulated (green) compared to normal mucosa (extracted from Supplementary Figure 4a).'
