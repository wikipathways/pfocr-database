caption: Pathways involved in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) pathogenesis.
  Molecular alterations, which drive cSCC development, have been identified in pathways
  involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, senescence, differentiation, and mitogenic/survival.
  (A) The tumor suppressor genes p16INK4A and p14ARF control retinoblastoma (pRb)
  and p53 pathways, respectively. Their loss of function promotes cell cycle counteracting
  senescence or apoptosis. Aberrant activation of E2F transcription can also be due
  to cyclin D activation or pRb expression loss. pRb and p53 inactivation is also
  mediated by E6 and E7 (red hexagons) human papilloma virus (HPV) proteins. (B) EGF-R
  aberrant activation, p53 inactivation, or NOTCH gene mutations inactivate the NOTCH
  pathway. Inactivation of NOTCH abolishes the direct or IRF6-mediated suppression
  of ﾎ年p63, favoring proliferation, survival, and stemness. NOTCH inactivation also
  counteracts senescence and apoptosis mediated by its targets (HES1 and p21). Moreover,
  ﾎ年p63 upregulation represses the expression of HES1, p21, and p16INK4A. (C) RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK
  and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways share the up-stream proteins, such as tyrosine kinase
  receptors (RTK) and RAS. Activating mutations in RTK, RAS or inactivation of negative
  regulator RASA1 promotes cell proliferation and survival through constitutive activation
  of both pathways. Aberrant activation of these pathways can also derive by B-RAF
  or PI3K/AKT activation, or Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) inactivation. The
  RTKs and the downstream pathways can be targeted with several drugs (blue hexagons)
  to inhibit cSCC progression. However, both pathways can be activated by RAS mutations,
  present in photodamaged skin, as part of a compensatory mechanism that could drive
  resistance to therapeutic targeting strategies. Proteins with commonly accepted
  tumor promoting and suppressing functions are highlighted in orange and green, respectively.
  Activated or downregulated processes (circles, squares and arrows) are highlighted
  in dark orange and green, respectively. Block and dash arrows indicate direct or
  indirect interactions, respectively.
