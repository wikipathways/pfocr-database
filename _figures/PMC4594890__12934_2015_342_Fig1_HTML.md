caption: 'Metabolic pathway involved in central metabolism and 3-HP production from
  glycerol. Dashed arrows represent conditionally repressed reactions. Bold arrows
  represent the introduced synthetic pathway for 3-HP production. The inset indicates
  the structure of MTS. When IPTG was absent, LacI repressed the transcription from
  PllacO1. In the presence of IPTG, TetR repressed the transcription from PltetO1.

  1,3-BPG 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, 3-HPA 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, 3-HP 3-hydroxypropinic
  acid, 1,3-PDO 1,3-propanediol. Metabolic enzymes: GlpK glycerol kinase, GlpD glycerol-3-phosphate
