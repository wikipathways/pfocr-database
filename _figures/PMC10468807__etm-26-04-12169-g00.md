caption: 'lncRNAs are involved in tumor cell lipid metabolism by targeting different
  signaling pathways. Colorectal cancer: SNHG16 targets the Wnt signaling pathway
  to promote lipid synthesis and tumor growth. Liver cancer: HULC downregulates the
  expression of tumor suppressor p18 and promotes tumor cell growth. The aberrant
  lipid metabolism regulated by HULC promotes cancer cell proliferation and rapid
  tumor growth, a process that requires the involvement of ACSL1 and cholesterol throughout.
  Cholesterol synthesized from acetyl CoA upregulates HULC expression through the
  activation of RXRA, and high HULC expression downregulates miR-9 expression, which
  in turn upregulates the expression of the transcription factor PPARα in hepatocellular
  carcinoma cells to activate ACSL1, thereby significantly upregulating ACSL1 and
  promoting tumor growth. Acetyl-CoA also synthesizes FAs and palmitic acid is an
  FA that produces diglycerides, which may be interconverted with triglycerides. NEAT1
  activates the PPARα signaling pathway directly through ATGL or indirectly through
  free fatty acids and DAG, thereby increasing FA oxidation and thus, the tumor keeps
  growing. Prostatic cancer: Low expression of PCA3 upregulates miR-132-3P expression,
  while high expression of miR-132-3P inhibits SREBP-1 expression, thereby suppressing
  TG and cholesterol levels in prostate cancer cells and slowing down the tumor cell
  growth. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: Knockout of HAGLROS inhibits intrahepatic
  cholangiocarcinoma proliferation and growth, inactivates the mTOR axis and promotes
  autophagy. ACSL1, long-chain acyl CoA synthetase 1; ATGL, adipose tissue triglyceride
  lipase; CHOL, cholesterol; DAG, diacylglycerol; HAGLROS, HAGLR opposite strand long
  non-coding RNA; HULC, highly upregulated in liver cancer; miR, microRNA; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; NEAT1, nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1; PA, palmitic
  acid; PCA3, prostate cancer antigen 3; PPARα, peroxisomal proliferator-activated
  receptor α; RXRA, RXR-α; SNHG16, small nucleolar RNA host gene 16; SREBP-1, sterol
