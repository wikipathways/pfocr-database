caption: The PI3K signaling pathway profoundly influences immune responses triggered
  by cancer vaccines by modulating the tumor microenvironment and immune cell activities.
  Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in Tregs and MDSCs promotes their proliferation
  and immunosuppressive functions, facilitated by factors like TGF-β, PD-1, CTLA-1,
  IL-6, Arg-1, and iNOS, which inhibit APCs and T cell activation. PI3K inhibitors
  can counteract these effects by inhibiting Tregs and MDSCs, thereby enhancing APC
  function and promoting T cell activation. When combined with cancer vaccines, PI3K
  inhibitors foster early synergy, improving antigen presentation and stimulating
  prolonged immune responses. Moreover, combining PI3K inhibitors with immune checkpoint
  inhibitors can reduce T cell depletion and boost sustained immune responses, thereby
  enhancing the efficacy and durability of cancer vaccines
