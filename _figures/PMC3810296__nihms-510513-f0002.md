caption: Multiple pattern-recognition receptors such as TLRs and NLRs are activated
  at different stages of bacterial invasion, at the cell surface or in the cytoplasm.
  Prolonged activation of these receptors lead to enhanced unwarranted inflammation
  and may promote tissue-damage. NLRP6 inhibits canonical NF-κB signaling thus hindering
  the TLR pathway activated by the extracellular recognition of bacterial ligands
  and thus maintaining immune homeostasis.
