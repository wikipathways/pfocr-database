caption: 'Intracellular signaling pathways involved in the antitumor activity of the
  GnRH-R in CRPC cells. The binding of GnRH analogs (both agonists and antagonists)
  to locally expressed GnRH-Rs triggers the activation of the Gαi/cAMP pathway. By
  decreasing cAMP levels, GnRH-R ligands activate the MAPK kinase cascades (i.e.,
  p38MAPK and JNK), deeply involved in their anticancer effects. GnRH-R analogs also
  trigger the activation of a PTP, an enzyme responsible for the dephosphorylation
  (i.e., inactivation) of growth factor receptors (RTK), thus leading to the suppression
  of the expression/activity of their intracellular signaling mediators (i.e., ERK1/2
  and AKT). In addition, AKT inhibition also leads to the stimulation of the JNK signaling
  pathway, further potentiating its antitumor activity. Abbreviations: cAMP, cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate; p38, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; ERK1/2, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase 1/2.'
