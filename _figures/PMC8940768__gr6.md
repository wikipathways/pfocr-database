caption: Graphical abstractHydrogels modified with the extracellular matrix of costal
  cartilage (ECM-Gels) loaded with Lenti-Sphk2-cartilage endplate stem cells (CESCs)
  near the cartilage endplate (CEP) produced Lenti-Sphk2-exosomes (Exos) continuously
  and steadily. Lenti-Sphk2-Exos could cut across the annulus fibrous and carry Sphk2
  into nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs). After entering the cytoplasm, Sphk2 phosphorylates
  sphingosine and generates sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), thus activating the intracellular
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and increasing autophagy. Activation of autophagy could
  inhibit senescence of NPCs by reducing SASP protein expression. Ultimately, Lenti-Sphk2-Exos
  ameliorated intervertebral disc degeneration by balancing autophagy/senescence.
