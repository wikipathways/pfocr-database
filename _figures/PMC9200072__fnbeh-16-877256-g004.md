caption: 'Circadian timing system regulation of gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis.
  (A) Left and right panels show steroidogenic pathways in the testes and ovaries
  respectively while the middle panel represents steroidogenic pathways common to
  both glands. In the ovary, the box with white long-dashed border refers to thecal
  cell steroid synthesis and the one with a green short-dashed border indicates granulosa
  cell steroidogenesis. Symbols: Blue arrows = regulated by gonadotropic hormones.
  (B) From left to right panels: steroidogenic pathways in adrenal zona fasciculata,
  zona glomerulosa and zona reticularis respectively. Boxes delineated with dashed
  lines are pathways in humans that don’t occur in rats and house mice. Symbols: magenta
  arrows = regulated by corticotropic hormones; orange arrows = regulated by the autonomic
  system; purple arrows = melatonin regulated steroidogenic molecules; (H) in the
  middle panel denotes primary subtype of 3βHSD in human zona glomerulosa and (R)
  denotes the primary 3βHSD in rodents. In both (A,B), pink clockfaces refer to steps
  under circadian regulation; solid arrows point to primary steroid synthetic pathways
  in humans; dashed arrows point to a hormone that is a minor product of that pathway.'
