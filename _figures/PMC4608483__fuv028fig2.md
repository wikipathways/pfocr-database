caption: The RNR regulation in S. cerevisiae. The transcription of RNR genes in the
  cell cycle is MBF dependent, and occurs in G1 reaching the maximum near G1/S transition.
  When Stb1 is unphosphorylated, it binds the Swi6 subunit of the MBF complex causing
  repression of RNR genes. In early G1 phase, Stb1 is phosphorylated by CDK which
  turns on RNR transcription. In late G1, Nrm1 promotes the MBF-dependent repression
  of RNR genes. In response to DNA damage in the S phase, the Mec1/Rad53/Dun1 kinase
  cascade activates RNR transcription. Hyperphosphorylation of Crt1 repressor turns
  on the expression of RNR2,3,4 genes. Moreover, phosphorylation by Rad53 of Nrm1
  causes its release from RNR promoters; and phosphorylation of Ixr1 activates the
  transcription of RNR1 gene. Additionally, the Mec1/Rad53/Dun1 pathway activates
  RNR activity by promoting the phosphorylation and degradation of the RNR inhibitor,
  Sml1 and enhancing the relocalization of small RNR subunits to the cytoplasm via
  modifications of Wtm1 (nuclear anchor protein for RNR small subunits) and Dif1 (importin).
  Protein names in white refer to transcription factors, in black to proteins with
  other functions.
