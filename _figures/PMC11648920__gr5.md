caption: Schematic representation of various signalling pathways and resistance mechanisms
  in wheat in response to Puccinia infection. During infection process, the pathogen
  is sensed by the pattern recognition receptors (PRR) or recognised by R proteins.
  It activates early signalling pathways involving mitogen associated protein kinases
  (MAPK) and Calcium dependent protein kinases (CDPK). MAPK enhances defense related
  transcription factors (TF) while the CDPKs enhances reactive oxygen (ROS) species
  production which in turn enhances reactive nitrogen (RNS) species production. The
  signal transduction results in enhancement of secondary signal molecules like salicylic
  acid (SA), ethylene (ET) and down regulation or no change in the genes involved
  in jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) production. Also, reduced photosynthesis
  and developmental process in response to Puccinia infection
