caption: The working model. In the resting state, Lys136-acetylated PP2Ac means abundant
  phosphatase activity to promote the dephosphorylation of IKKβ and p65, indicating
  the closure of NF-κB pathway. The LPS or TNFα treatment could enhance the HDAC5
  deacetylase activity to reduce the acetylation of PP2A, leading to decreased phosphatase
  activity. Phosphorylated p65 was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
  to activate the expression of target genes.
