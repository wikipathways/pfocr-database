caption: ESX-1 secretion system damage Mtb-contained phagosome and resist from xenophagic
  pathway. Parkin1 and Smurf1 ubiuitinate damaged Mtb-contained phagosome to control
  Mtb survival. During Mtb infection, cGAS binds Mtb DNA and then activate type I
  interferons through STING pathway. In addition, damaged phagosome recruits Galectin-3,
  resulting in Galectin-3-TRIM16-ULK1-Beclin-1-ATG16L1 complex and initiation of autophagy.
  Galectin-8 suppresses mTOR activity in response to lysosomal damage. In IFN-γ-activated
  macrophages, ubiquilin 1 promotes ubiquitin, p62, and LC3 around Mtb and IFN-γ-induced
  IRGM interacts with autophagy machinery such as Beclin 1, ULK1, and ATG16L1. Mtb
  eis gene play role in regulating of autophagy. Furthermore, CpsA, protein of Mtb,
  evades from LAP and inhibits LAPosome formation during Mtb infection. In mouse and
  guinea pigs model, agonists for both CLEC4E and TLR4 activate autophagy, thereby
  reducing bacterial load. Sirtuin 3, enhances autophagy through TFEB and PPARA.
