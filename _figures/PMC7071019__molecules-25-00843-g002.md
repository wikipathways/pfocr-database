caption: 'Cellular response: APCs and T-lymphocytes. TAA-displaying phages are processed
  inside an APC via the endosome-lysosome pathway. The TAA is exposed on the APC surface
  complexed with MHC molecules. Naïve T lymphocytes carrying a TAA-specific TCR are
  activated by interaction with the TAA-MHC complex: binding to MHC class II leads
  to activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes and differentiation in Th cells, while binding
  to MHC class I leads to activation of CD8+ T lymphocytes and differentiation in
  CTLs. Both types of effector T cells release chemokines and cytokines to mount an
  immune response against the TAA. Abbreviations: APC, antigen-presenting cell; TAA,
  tumor-associated antigen; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TCR, T-cell receptor;
  Th, T helper; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; IL-2, interleukin 2; IFN-γ, interferon
  γ; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α.'
