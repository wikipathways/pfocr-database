caption: '(a) Genetic organization of hok/sok of plasmid R1, a type TA module. sokT
  denotes the Sok-RNA target in hok mRNA (indicated by a small grey box). The mok
  reading frame (black filled box) is required for hok to be translated but the mok
  gene product itself has no known function. The hok reading frame is out of frame
  with that of mok and terminates just downstream of m. FL denotes the full-length,
  inactive hok mRNA; TR denotes the 3′-truncated, active hok mRNA that can either
  bind the antisense RNA or be translated. Sok-RNA is the 65 nt long antisense. The
  hokB/sokB locus of E. coli K-12 has all the regulatory elements present in hok/sok
  of R1. (b) hok mRNA folding pathway: (i) the nascent transcript contains the metastable
  hairpin that prevents Sok-RNA and ribosome binding during transcription; (ii) the
  full-length hok mRNA in which the fbi–tac elements base-pair to form the stable,
  inactive mRNA. The full-length mRNA functions as a reservoir from which the active
  truncated version of hok mRNA can be generated by 3′-end processing. tac denotes
  the translational activator sequence that sequentially base-pairs with three different
  sequence elements within hok mRNA: in the metastable hairpin, with the upstream
  complementary box (ucb) and with a fold-back inhibition (fbi) element. The ucb element
  is complementary to both tac and SD of mok; see text for a further explanation;
  (iii) truncated, active hok mRNA is generated by 3′ processing of the full-length
  mRNA. Removal of 40 nt at the 3′ end of FL hok mRNA disrupts the fbi–tac interaction
  and triggers refolding into the truncated, active version of the mRNA that can either
  bind the antisense or be translated. Everted bases indicated with dashes symbolize
  the U-turn loop structure present in the refolded hok mRNA, which functions as the
  initial recognition element for antisense RNA binding and thereby increases the
  recognition reaction approximately 10-fold []. SD, Shine and Dalgarno elements.
  (iv, v) The two fates of activated hok mRNA are that it can either bind the antisense
  (iv) or be translated (v).'
