caption: Hypothetical model of NMN-mediated longevity and the main reasons for decreasing
  NAD+ level with age. NMN may exploit the mechanism for lifespan extension by mitohormesis,
  which may depend on the AMPK/SIRT1/FOXO pathway. On the other hand, NAD+ degradation
  accelerates due to DNA damage, chronic oxidative stress, inflammation and consumption
  of higher NAD+ enzymes such as sirtuins, CD38, CD157, TNKS, poly-adenosine diphosphate
  ribose polymerase, etc. When NAD+ levels decrease, dysregulation of mitochondrial
  energy production may occur, leading to aging and decreasing lifespan extension.
  Supplementation with NMN reverses the aging process, promotes NAD+ levels, and prevents
  age-related disorders
