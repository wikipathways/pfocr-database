caption: HCK as a key target of CXCL12, CXCR4, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway,
  modulating chemotaxis and cytoskeleton activity. CXCL12 is secreted by bone marrow
  mesenchymal stromal cells and binds and triggers its receptor, CXCR4 on hematopoietic
  cells. This interaction results in the activation of HCK and, consequently, PI3K/AKT/P70S6K
  and MAPK/ERK pathways, regulating processes as chemotaxis, cytoskeleton (actin polymerization)
  and gene expression (CXCR4). Thus, HCK could control the leukemic cell homing to
  the protective BM niche by a migratory advantage of leukemic cells and could represent
  a potential target for new therapeutical approaches for AML. Figure was produced
