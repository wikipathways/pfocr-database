caption: Outline of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling. Initiation of
  the TGF-β signaling cascade occurs upon ligand binding to TGF-β receptor type II
  (TβRII) and subsequent TβRI–TβRII heterotetrameric complex formation. TβRII is a
  constitutively active receptor kinase and phosphorylates Ser/Thr residues in the
  cytoplasmic GS domain of TβRI, which turns on the kinase activity of TβRI. Activation
  of TβRI transmits its signal to the various intracellular Smad-dependent and Smad-independent
  signaling pathways. The canonical Smad pathway involves activation of Smad2/3 through
  recruitment and phosphorylation by activated TβRI, and requires kinase activity
  of TβRI. The recruitment of Smad2/3 to the receptor complex is mediated by auxiliary
  proteins, such as SARA. Smad2/3 is subsequently released from the receptor complex
  to interact with Smad4 to transmit TGF-β1 signals. TGF-β1 also activates various
  Smad-independent signaling pathways, including TAK1, Ras, PI3K/AKT, RhoA, and PP2A,
  which in turn triggers the activation of various downstream signaling cascades.
