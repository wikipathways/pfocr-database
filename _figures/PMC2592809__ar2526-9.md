caption: 'The scheme summarises different intracellular pathways during osteoblast
  differentiation which include promoting (blue) and inhibiting (red) factors and
  are mainly mediated by Smad proteins. Based on recent studies it can be assumed
  that not only the TGFβ/BMP, the Wnt/beta-catenin, the Notch pathway or direct gene
  activations by steroids but also prostaglandins are involved in osteoblast differentiation.
  Prostacyclin and its related molecules, such as iloprost, play a crucial role in
  various cellular mechanisms and control intracellular signals: the IP receptor mediates
  the actions of its ligand via Gs (or Gq, G11, Gi) protein activation leading to
  adenylate cyclase activation followed by an intracellular increase of cAMP. Moreover,
  the human IP receptor gene presents various bindings sites such as glucocorticoid
  response element (GRE) and it can be concluded that glucocorticoids also regulate
  its expression. In addition, the human EP receptors with its various subtypes such
  as EP1–4 and their isoforms are also activated by iloprost. One major EP-related
  effect is the mobilisation of intracellular Ca2+ but also a down-regulation of intracellular
  cAMP concentration as described for the EP4 receptor. However, the complex intracellular
  effects that are triggered by iloprost and the importance in osteoblast differentiation
  are poorly understood to date.'
