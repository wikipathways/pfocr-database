caption: A model of enzymatic and chemical acetylations on the lysine residues of
  a putative protein substrate. For the enzymatic mechanism, an acetyltransferase
  (AcuA in B. subtilis) takes the acetyl group (Ac) from a donor such as acetyl-CoA
  and adds it to a lysine residue on a target protein. This reaction can be reversed
  by the activity of a deacetyltransferase (AcuC or SrtN in B. subtilis). Chemical
  acetylation uses acetyl-phosphate, an intermediate in the acetate metabolic pathway,
  as the donor of the acetyl group to directly acetylate lysine residues of the target
  protein. “+” represents the positively charged lysine residue on the target protein.
  Pdh, pyruvate dehydrogenase; Pta, phosphotransacetylase; AckA, acetate kinase; AcsA,
  acetyl-CoA synthetase.
