caption: Model of activation of Nrf2-mediated ARE pathway by phytochemicals. Phytochemicals
  may act directly on the Nrf2-Keap1 complex, or alternatively on upstream kinases
  such as PI3K, p38, ERK, PKC, JNK, causing the release of Nrf2 from the inhibitory
  complex. Additionally, certain phytochemicals may act at the level of the proteasome
  to inhibit proteolytic degradation of Nrf2 and prolong its half-life. Activated
  Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus where it interacts with small MAF family proteins
  bound to the antioxidant response element (ARE), allowing transcription of target
  genes including those including antioxidant and phase II enzymes.
