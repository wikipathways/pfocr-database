caption: The FA pathway and inter-strand crosslink (ICL) repair. DNA crosslinking
  damages generally include intra-strand and inter-strand crosslink damages, which
  are repaired by NER and FA pathways, respectively. (a) In the FA pathway, the ICL
  damage is recognized by FANCM accompanying some other FAAPs at converging replication
  fork, which results in FA core complex loading along with FAAP100, FAAP20, and FAAP24,
  as well as MHF1 and MHF2. (b) FA core complex activates the ID2 complex by monoubiquitylation
  of FANCI and FANCD2. (c) Monoubiquitylated ID2 complex activates several endonucleases,
  such as FAN1, to stimulate unhooking processing of the ICL. (d) The unhooked ICL
  is removed by the NER pathway and bypassed by translesion synthesis polymerases
  REV1/pol ζ. (e,f) The HR pathway is recruited to repair the DSB on the other strand.
  After detection of DSB by PARP1, ADP-ribose molecules recruit the MRN complex to
  produce single-strand DNA and bind sister chromatid through a tail-to-tail link
  with another MRN complex. (g) Some FA members, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, and
  PALB2, in addition to the BCDX2 complex, induce the attachment of FANCR/RAD51 to
  ssDNA, which promotes strand invasion and DNA synthesis.
