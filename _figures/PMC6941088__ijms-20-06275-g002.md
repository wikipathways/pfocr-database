caption: The classical and alternative nuclear factor--κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways.
  The classical (canonical) pathway is activated by a large number of agonists, such
  as the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), the interleukin (IL)-1β, lipopolysaccharides,
  and T-cell receptors. Activation of this pathway depends on the IκB kinase (IKK)
  complex, which phosphorylates the inhibitor of κBα (IκBα) to induce rapid degradation.
  This pathway is essential for immune responses, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and
  cell survival. The alternative (noncanonical) pathway is activated by a limited
  number of agonists, which are involved in secondary lymphoid organogenesis, mature
  B-cell function, and adaptive immunity. This pathway requires NF-κB-inducing kinase
  (NIK) and IκB kinase α (IKKα) to promote the processing of the p100 precursor into
  p52, which results in dimerization and activation of the p52/RelB heterodimer.
