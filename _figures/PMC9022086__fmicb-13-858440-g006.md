caption: cKD24 mutant showed DEGs in the canonical cell division pathway for alphaproteobacteria.
  DEGs in the cKD24 mutant that were downregulated (blue ovals) or upregulated (red
  ovals) with a cutoff threshold of log2FC ≥ 1.5 and P-adj/FDR ≤ 0.02. Non-DEGs are
  shown in yellow ovals. TolB (in white letters) was the only downregulated gene in
  the Tol-Pal complex (light blue oval). The cell division pathway was based on the
  KEGG pathway map for Cell cycle in C. crescentus.
