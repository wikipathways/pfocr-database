caption: 'Circles designate chemical compounds, rectangles the corresponding enzymes
  catalyzing their transitions. Enzymes are numbered from 1 to 10 according to their
  hypothesized order in the pathway, and asterisks correspond to the respective number
  of characterized genes whose depicted function has been empirically demonstrated
  through targeted knockdown studies listed in Table . Reactions and interactions
  in the CHC biosynthesis pathway that are not completely understood are marked with
  dashed arrows and question marks. Acetyl-CoA as the initial reactant of CHC biosynthesis
  is mainly provided by the citric acid cycle. Note that the distinction between microsomal
  and cytosolic fatty acid synthase is hypothetical and has not yet been unambiguously
  confirmed. Abbreviations: CoA: Coenzyme A, ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase, MCD: malonyl-CoA
  decarboxylase, LaAT: lipoamide acyltransferase, LCF(A): long-chain fatty (acid),
  VLC(F): very-long chain (fatty), mb: methyl-branched, un: unsaturated. Figure adapted
  and synthesized from Howard and Blomquist (), Blomquist and Bagnères (), Chung and
  Carroll (), Ginzel and Blomquist ().'
