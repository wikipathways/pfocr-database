caption: Survival mechanisms of ovarian cancer spheroids in ascites. Several signaling
  pathway are involved in anoikis resistance, such as AKT pathway, Bcl-2 pathway,
  and Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs may be due to spherical
  structure, drug resistance-related proteins, CSCs and other non-tumor cells present
  in spheroids. Other mechanisms such as immune escape may also contribute to survival
  of spheroids. FZD7, Frizzled family receptor 7; PIK3R3, phosphoinositide-3-kinase
  regulatory subunit 3; COL4A2, type IV α2 collagen; TrkB, tropomysin related kinase
  B; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAK,
  focal adhesion kinase; CSC, cancer stem cell
