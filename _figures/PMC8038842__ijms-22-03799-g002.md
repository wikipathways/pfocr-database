caption: The human mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis (mtFAS) pathway. The mFAS
  pathway is shown in blue, and the lipoic acid biosynthesis pathway is shown in green.
  The end product of mFAS is octanoyl-ACP, which is used as a substrate for the biosynthesis
  of lipoic acid. Acyl-ACP actively participates in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
  assembly. CII, complex II of the electron transport chain; LA, lipoic acid; ACSF3,
  acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3; MCAT, malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase;
  OXSM, 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase; CBR4, carbonyl reductase 4; HSD17β, 3-ketoacyl-ACP
  reductase alpha subunit; HTD2, hydroxyacyl-thioester dehydratase type 2; MECR, mitochondrial
  2-enoyl thioester reductase; LIAS, lipoic acid synthetase; Lipt1, lipoyltransferase
  1; DLAT, dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase; PDHX, pyruvate dehydrogenase protein
  X component; DLST, dihydrolipoyllysine residue succinyltransferase component of
  2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex; DBT, dihydrolipoyl acyltransferase.
