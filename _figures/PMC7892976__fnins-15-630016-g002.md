caption: Hypothetical model of Se transport across blood–brain barrier (BBB) and blood–cerebrospinal
  fluid barrier (BCB). Circulating SELENOP present in blood and CSF is taken up by
  LRP8-positive cells in the epithelial (BBB) and ependymal (BCB) layers, resynthesized
  in neighboring astrocytes, and released to supply LRP8-positive neurons with Se.
  In the astrocytes, SELENBP1 sequesters Se from selenoprotein synthesis and thus
  negatively regulating SELENOP production. There is also evidence indicating the
  existence of the SELENOP-independent Se uptake pathway (). Reproduced from  with
  modification.
