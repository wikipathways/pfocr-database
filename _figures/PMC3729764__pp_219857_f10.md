caption: 'A simplified scheme of changes in metabolic pathways after blocking mitochondrial
  electron transport chain. Detected metabolites are colored: blue indicates decrease
  after antimycin A, red indicates increase after antimycin A, green indicates no
  changes, and gray indicates not detected. Enzymes are given as arrows, with orange
  arrows indicating the putative pathway leading to ethanol production involving the  shunt
  after addition of antimycin A. Identified enzymes were labeled. SSA, Succinic semialdehyde;
  GDH, Glu dehydrogenase; GAD, Glu decarboxylase; -T,  transaminase; SSADH, succinic
  semialdehyde dehydrogenase; PDC, pyruvate decarboxylase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase.
  See Supplemental Table S3 for identified enzymes.'
