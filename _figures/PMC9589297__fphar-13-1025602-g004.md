caption: The HS inhibitory mechanism of TCM (Panax notoginseng saponins, corilagin,
  and baicalein) by promoting extracellular matrix degradation. Panax notoginseng
  saponins (PNS), corilagin (Cor), and baicalein (BAI) could promote the degradation
  of the extracellular matrix to reduce HS. PNS inhibited HS formation potentially
  by inhibiting TRPM7 and regulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to inhibit extracellular
  matrix deposition. Cor inhibited TGF-β1, reduced the expression of p-Smad2/3, affected
  the levels of MMPs and TIMP1 proteins, inhibited the deposition of extracellular
  matrix, and thus attenuated HS. Up-regulation of miR-29 by BAI could inhibit TGFβ1-induced
  accumulation of total soluble collagen, collagen I, and α-SMA to alleviate HS.
