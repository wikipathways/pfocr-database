caption: ANXA1-FPR-STAT3 and ERK1/2-STAT1 signaling in breast cancer to brain metastasis.
  ANXA1 is involved in an autocrine/paracrine signaling network between metastatic
  mammary cancer cells and microglial cells. Exogenous ANXA1 from tumors (red) or
  microglia (green) promotes microglial migration via regulation of the expression
  of several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes, and this in turn, benefits
  cancer migration through its immune-modulatory effects on microglial cells via formyl-peptide
  receptors (FPRs) 1 and 2. Meanwhile, the endogenous ANXA1 expression (yellow) was
  triggered simultaneously in microglia, leading to enhanced activation of STAT3 induced
  by activated FPRs, and thus antagonizes the anti-tumorigenic ERK1/2-STAT1 pathway
