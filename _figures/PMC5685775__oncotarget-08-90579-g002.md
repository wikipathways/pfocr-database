caption: In the absence of WNT ligands, Smad7 associates with β-catenin and Smurf2
  to degrade β-catenin. Smad7 also binds phosphorylated YAP and Smurf to form a high
  affinity complex for TGF-β type 1 receptor to decrease TGF-β signaling expression.
  In the absence of WNT ligands, phosphorylated YAP and TAZ are associated with the
  β-catenin destruction complex. Phosphorylated YAP is also associated with β-catenin
  to inhibit its nuclear translocation and promote its degradation. Upon WNT stimulation,
  the beta-catenin destruction complex is inhibited and then beta-catenin accumulates
  in the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus. TAZ inhibits the phosphorylation
  of DSH and dissociates it from the β-catenin destruction complex. The destruction
  complex is inhibited because YAP and TAZ dissociate from the complex. β-catenin
  accumulates in the cytosol and then translocates to the nucleus for activating WNT
  targets. Upon TGF-β stimulation, Axin promotes the tail-phosphorylation of Smad2/3.
  Axin also forms a complex with Arkadia and Smad7 for enhancing TGF-β signaling.
  The activated Smad complex associates with TAZ and YAP and then translocates to
  the nucleus for activating Smad targets.
