caption: Intracellular signaling pathways recruited by leptin. The full-length isoform,
  ObRb, contains intracellular motifs required for activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signal
  transduction pathway. ObRb contains 4 important tyrosine residues that provide docking
  sites for signaling proteins with SHP2 domains. Activation of JAK2 occurs by transphosphorylation
  and subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region of
  the receptor. Phosphorylation of STAT3 leads to their dissociation from the receptor
  and the formation of active dimers, which translocate to the nucleus to regulate
  gene expression, binding to the promoter regions of target genes. The leptin-regulated
  STAT3 signaling may interact with STAT5, which may regulate STAT3-dependent gene
  expression. The ability of SOCS3 to inhibit leptin-stimulated phosphorylation of
  JAK2 provides a negative-feedback mechanism on the leptin signaling system. The
  ERK members of the MAPK family are components of the well-defined AMPK-Ras/Raf/MAPK
  signaling cascade and have become activated by leptin. Leptin activates PI3K signaling
  via IRS-1 and/or IRS-2 phosphorylation. The PTP1B inhibits leptin-stimulated phosphorylation
  of IRS-1/2 and/or JAK2. Leptin administration results further in Akt/mTOR phosphorylation
  followed by regulation of FOXO and S6 expression.
