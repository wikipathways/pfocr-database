caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of proteins displaying alterations in expression
  patterns following infliximab treatment in patients deemed to be non-responders.
  (See Results for response definitions.) A network analysis of the differentially
  expressed proteins in the non-responder group indicates that, as with the responder
  network shown in Figure 2, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is at the centre of the
  network but the down-regulated proteins are more distal, whereas more proximal proteins
  such as C-reactive protein (CRP) are up-regulated.
