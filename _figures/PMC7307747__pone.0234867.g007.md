caption: Therapeutic use of electric current has been practiced for various kinds
  of inflammation, and the mechanism was thought to be its analgesic effect or by
  blood flow improvement []. It is well known that in an electrolytic reaction, electrical
  current generates H2O2 from water [], and as shown in our study, this reaction might
  also occur in electrical stimulation used for therapeutic purposes. While many reports
  indicate that reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H2O2, exerts pro-inflammatory
  effects through activation of NF-κB, more recent studies have shown that ROS are
  not only responsible for inducing inflammation, but also have potent anti-inflammatory
  properties [, ]. Increase in intracellular concentration of H2O2 have been demonstrated
  to diminish TLR4-induced activation of NF-κB and production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines in neutrophils, epithelial cells and other cell populations []. Aside
  from T cells and primary splenocytes, MES5500 was also able to reduce the inflammatory
  cytokine expression in other cells such as MG6 (microglia), SHSY5Y (neuroblastoma
  lineage) () and HeLa cells (). MES5500 did not have any effect at the basal state
  of these cells, indicating the safety of the treatment, and it modulated the excess
  reaction after inflammatory reagent stimulation. Moreover, MES5500 reduced the induction
  of IL-1β upon stimulation of these cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an immune
  activator that binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (). These data consolidate our
  findings that MES5500 has immune suppressor effect.
