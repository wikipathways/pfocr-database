caption: Pathway 1 shows the canonical TLR2 MyD88-dependent signaling pathway that
  activates NF-kB after S. aureus. Pathway 2 shows TLR4 MyD88-dependent signaling
  to NF-kB and MyD88–independent signaling to TRIF/TRAM. Both MyD88 pathways have
  been excluded as causes of the Ppargc1a gene expression. Pathway 3 shows a putative
  TLR2-TLR4 heterodimer interacting with TRIF/TRAM. Pathway 4 indicates TLR2 in the
  TLR4 null state, as a homodimer or a heterodimer involving a non-TLR4 partner such
  as TLR1 or 6, interacting with TRIF/TRAM and unmasking the innate immune regulation
  of Ppargc1a expression. Pathway 5 shows canonical TLR3 endosome signaling also excluded
  in Ppargc1 gene regulation after S. aureus; however, independent TLR3 activation
  partially rescues the Ppargc1 phenotype in mice. TIRAP is Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
  domain-containing adapter protein (MAL); IRAK4 is Interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 4; TRAF3 and TRAF6 are TNF receptor-associated factor 3 and 6; TAK1 is TGF-beta-activated
  kinase 1 and TBK1 is NF-kappa-B-activating kinase.
