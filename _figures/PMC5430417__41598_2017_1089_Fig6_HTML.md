caption: 'Mechanisms involved in the antagonist effect of sinapic acid against UVA-induced
  attenuation of stemness and differentiation properties of stem cells. (A) UVA irradiation
  induces the production of PGE2 and its downstream molecule, cAMP, through the activations
  of AP-1 and NF-κB. The cAMP molecule sequentially reduces the expression of the
  HIF-1α gene through the CREB activation that consequently downregulates the expression
  of the stemness genes such as NANOG, SOX2, and OCT4. In the UVA-irradiation-induced
  signaling pathway, sinapic acid attenuates the UVA-induced effects on the expression
  of the stemness genes by inhibiting p38 MAPK and NF-κB, which is upstream of the
  PGE2 production. AC: adenylate cyclase. (B) Under adipogenic condition, UVA irradiation
  induces the expression of MIF through the activations of p42/44 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB.
  The MIF molecule then induces the phosphorylation of the AMPK protein, consequently
  upregulating the expression of KLF gene. The KLF protein downregulates the expression
  of PPARγ, an adipogenic factor. In the UVA-irradiation-induced signaling pathway
  under adipogenic condition, sinapic acid attenuates the UVA-induced inhibition of
  adipogenic differentiation of stem cells by inhibiting the production of MIF through
  the suppression of NF-κB.SA: sinapic acid, UVA: ultraviolet.'
