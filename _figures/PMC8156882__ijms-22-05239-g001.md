caption: RUNX1 is involved in inflammation-mediated NAFLD. Harmful eating habits lead
  to high levels of circulating triglycerides (TAG), which accumulate in the liver,
  causing oxidative stress and inflammation. These two processes activate RUNX1, which
  turns on the angiogenesis pathway to try to repair injuries. At the same time, there
  is a growth of the adipose tissue that releases free fatty acids (FFA) that reach
  the liver, leading to lipotoxicity that promotes inflammation. A persistent inflammation
  state inhibits the tissue remodeling and promotes the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, which leads to liver tissue damage and enhances the progression of NAFLD
  to NASH [,,,,]. On the other hand, it was also shown that RUNX1 is a positive regulator
  of TLR4, signaling for the induction of the inflammatory response []. TLR are involved
  in the NAFLD pathogenesis [].
