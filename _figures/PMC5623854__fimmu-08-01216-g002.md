caption: 'Non-apoptotic signaling pathway induced by CD95. Left panel: Cancer cells
  exposed to s-CD95L induce the recruitment of RTKs (i.e., EGFR or PDGFR) by CD95
  leading to the binding and activation of src. In turn, src kinases can phosphorylate
  caspase-8 neutralizing its enzymatic activity and promoting its role in the activation
  of the PI3K signaling pathway (i.e., recruitment of p85) and cell migration. Right
  panel: CD95 favors RTK activation leading to Src recruitment. s-CD95L interaction
  with CD95 induces binding of PLCγ1, which is activated through a src-dependent phosphorylation.
  Activated PLCγ1 hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), releasing
  inositol triphosphate (IP3), which activates IP3Rs on endoplasmic reticulum promoting
  calcium release into the cytoplasm that contributes to the CD95-mediated cell migration
  signaling pathway.'
