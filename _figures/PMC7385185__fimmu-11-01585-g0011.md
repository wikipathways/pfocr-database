caption: Schematic of the two-way communication between AMs and AECs in LPS-induced
  airway inflammation. LPS induced the production of inflammatory factors such as
  TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β by AECs through p38 MAPK signaling. AECs also produced TGF-β
  in response to LPS stimulation. TGF-β induced IGF-1 production by AMs through the
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. IGF-1 prevented LPS-induced p38 MAPK activation and
  MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-1 β production in AECs, and it also promoted AEC phagocytosis
  of apoptotic cells through PPARγ.
