caption: Mitochondrial Apoptosis and Inflammation. Components within the IMS or matrix
  can trigger apoptosis or inflammation if leaked into the cytosol, primarily due
  to the mPTP and MOMP. Upon MOMP formation and mPTP opening, cytochrome C, SMAC,
  and mtDNA are released into the cytosol. Cytochrome C interacts with APAF1, activating
  caspase 9 to initiate the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis. SMAC accelerates
  this process by inhibiting XIAP. After binding with mtDNA, the cGAS enzyme produces
  cGAMP from ATP and GTP, activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and inducing
  type I interferon expression and NF-κB activation. The NLRP3 inflammasome can also
  bind with (oxidized) mtDNA to promote IL-1β and IL-18 cleavage. However, caspase
  3 cleaves cGAS and IRF3 during apoptosis, inhibiting inflammation. MOMP mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization; mPTP mitochondrial permeability transition pore;
  SMAC second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases; APAF1 apoptosis protease
  activating factor 1; XIAP X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; cGAS cyclic GMP-AMP
  synthase; STING stimulator of interferon genes; cGAMP cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine
  monophosphate; TBK1 TANK binding kinase 1; IKK IκB kinase; IRF3 interferon regulatory
