caption: A conceptual model describing the response of Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 to
  gamma irradiation. The circular diagram represents a cell with the key genes and
  proteins up regulated after irradiation in Red and the down regulated ones in Bleu.
  Gamma irradiation leads to ROS production and Redox imbalance. Glutathione molecules
  are used as key antioxidant molecules for ROS scavenging (the glutathione cycle
  and the related enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis were highlighted). Also
  enzymatic antioxidants such as peroxiredoxin are used. ROS causes DNA damage, which
  activates DNA reparation, involving a number of different genes (uvr, rec, gyrA,
  mut, nudix). Oxidative stress activates the Fur regulon which controls iron homeostasis
  and enhance isiA gene expression for protection of the photosystems PSI and PSII.
  In parallel, there is shutdown of all genes related to the synthesis of photo-pigments
  (cpc, apc, chl), the degradation of phycobilisomes by protein NblA is activated,
  and there is a coordinated repression of all the genes required for photosynthesis
  (psa, psb, atp). There is an induction of the photosensor Cry-DASH gene and the
  biosynthesis pathway of pterine which are involved in signalling and phototactic
  movement. And there is an activation of several new genes, coding for conserved
  hypothetical proteins (Arh) in response to gamma rays. ROS, reactive oxygen species.
