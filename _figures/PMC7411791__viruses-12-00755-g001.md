caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in response to viral infection. The TLRs
  engage the viral RNA signal in a MyD88-dependent (TLR7 and TLR8) and TRIF-dependent
  manner (TLR3). The MyD88 dependent pathway proceeds via formation of “Mydossome”
  with TRAF6 activating TAK1 kinase via polyubiquitination. The activated TAK1 activates
  IKK kinase complex and various MAP kinases by phosphorylation. The activation of
  IKK complex leads to the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (by targeting
  inhibitor IκBα for proteasomal degradation) and IRF7; the MAPK kinases, however,
  activate AP-1 family of transcription factors followed by their nuclear translocation.
  The TRIF-dependent pathway, on the other hand, directly recruits TRAF3 and TRAF6.
  The TRAF6 then activates RIPK1 by polyubiquitination, which in turn activates TAK1
  by phosphorylation leading to activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, IRF7,
  and AP-1 family of transcription factors. TRAF3 on the other hand activates IKK
  complex by polyubiquitination which in turn activates IKKε/TBK1 by phosphorylation
  leading to activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. Of note, TLR4 recognizes
  endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) secreted by influenza-infected
  cells and signal via both adaptors, MyD88 and TRIF. Signaling by various TLRs thus
  culminates with the induction of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines.
