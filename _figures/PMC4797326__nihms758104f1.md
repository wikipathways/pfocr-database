caption: 'PPCM as a hormonal and vascular disease: The peripartum period causes secretion
  of hormones from the pituitary (e.g., prolactin (PRL)) and placenta (e.g., sFlt1).
  PRL is converted to 16-kD Vasoinhibin by CathepsinD (CathD) secreted from cardiomyocytes.
  Vasoinhibin then both triggers endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis and the secretion
  from ECs of miRNA146a encapsulated in exosomes. These exosomes are internalized
  by cardiomyocytes, where miRNA146s targets the ErbB4 pathway and others, causing
  dysfunction and apoptosis. At the same time, sFlt1 binds to and inhibits VEGF signaling,
  leading to EC dysfunction and apoptosis. Ultimately, dwindling vascular support
  leads to metabolic insufficiency in cardiomyocytes and cardiomyopathy.'
