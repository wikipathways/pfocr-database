caption: Osmotic stress evokes rapid increase of Ca2+, which is perceived by OSCA1
  osmosensor proteins localized at plasma membrane. Question marks in violet objects
  depict possible downstream components activated by OSCA1 in response to osmotic
  stress. Raf-like kinases are activated in response to osmotic stress likely via
  other uncharacterized osmosensor proteins depicted as question mark in black box.
  B4 Raf-like MAPKKKs phosphorylate and activate subclass I SnRK2s, which are not
  responsive to ABA, and in turn SnRK2s phosphorylate mRNA binding proteins, such
  as VCS, which forms a protein complex with the decapping proteins DCP1 and DCP2
  and are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA in p-bodies. B2/B3 Raf-like
  MAPKKKs phosphorylate and activate subclass III SnRK2s, which are ABA-responsive.
  In the presence of ABA, PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors form protein complexes with PP2C,
  resulting in the release of subclass III SnRK2s from inhibition by PP2Cs. Subclass
  III SnRK2s, phosphorylate SLAC1, KAT1 and RBOHF membrane proteins, which are essential
  for stomatal aperture regulation. Subclass III SnRK2s phosphorylate AREB/ABF transcription
  factors, which in turn activate the expression of stress-responsive genes. DREB2A
  transcription factor is activated through an ABA-independent signalling pathway.
  Question mark pink box depicts plausible upstream regulators of DREB2A still unknown.
  Straight arrows indicate direct interaction and phosphorylation, dashed arrows (black)
  indicate putative interactions not fully experimentally validated in vivo, and dashed
  arrows (grey) depict ion flux through membrane channel proteins. Double arrowhead
  dashed arrow indicates association–dissociation of PP2C with SnRK2s in the absence–presence
  of ABA.
