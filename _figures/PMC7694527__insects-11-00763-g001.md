caption: 'The hypothetical molecular relationships of LmPrx6 (Prx6 of Locust migratoria)
  in ISP in an adult female: Female adults sense the short photoperiod (SP) and cause
  enhanced LmPrx6 that inhibits ROS. The reduction of ROS leads to the phosphorylation
  of PTP1B. The phosphorylated LmPTP1B inhibits IR, which could phosphorylate AKT.
  The attenuation of AKT leads to the dephosphorylation of FOXO. Then, the dephosphorylated
  FOXO transfers to the nucleus to induce the expression of genes of stress tolerance
  (catalase and Mn-SOD) and genes of storage of energy reserves (phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxy kinase (PEPCK) and glycogen synthase).'
