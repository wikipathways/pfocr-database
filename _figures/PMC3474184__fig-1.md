caption: The mitochondrial energy–redox axis and generation of redox- and energy messengers.
  Mitochondria maintain a fine tuning of NAD+/NADH ratios, generate H2O2 involved
  in the regulation of redox-sensitive signaling and transcriptional pathways, and
  ATP to meet the energy demands of the cell. The regulation of redox-sensitive signaling
  is exemplified with the 2-electron pathway ( and  in the text). Activation of PGC1α
  is given as an example of regulation by NAD+/NADH ratios and of interaction with
  the energy demands/energy sensors panel. There is also interaction between the latter
  panel and the regulation of redox-sensitive signaling by H2O2, for its generation
  reports the mitochondrial energy charge to cytosol () and is implicated in the regulation
  of the cell's redox status. oA-ADPr, 2’-o-acetyl-ADP-ribose; Ac, acetyl moiety;
  Nic, nicotinamide.
