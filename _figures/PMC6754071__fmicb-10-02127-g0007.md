caption: Proposed model of the PolS-PolR regulatory role in poly-P metabolism and
  Pi transport. (A) The diagram of poly-P metabolic pathway in M. phosphovorus NM-1
  (He and McMahon, ; Kawakoshi et al., ). The locus tags and gene symbols related
  to the metabolism of Poly-P were annotated. The target genes of PolR were marked
  in red. (B) The putative mechanism of PolR regulating poly-P metabolism and Pi transport.
  The regulation of target genes by non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated PolR is
  indicated by gray lines and red lines, respectively. The relative degree of promoter
  binding is indicated by the number of “+,”and “–” indicates that PolR does not bind
  to the promoter.
