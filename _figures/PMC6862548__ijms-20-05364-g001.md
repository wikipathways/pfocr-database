caption: The pathways activated by several dysregulated hormones in central obesity.
  The green arrow stands for activation and the red line for repression. Leptin binds
  to the Ob-Rb receptor, and activates several signaling pathways. The JAK2-STAT3
  pathway is activated; which will result in the stimulated transcription of the SOCS3,
  and ultimately AROMASE (CYP19A) genes. The JAK-STAT5 pathway results in the increased
  expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which leads to angiogenesis.
  The IRS1/2-PI3K-AKT is also stimulated by Ob-Rb receptor which increases the NO
  level, and activates BCL2 associated agonist of cell death - BAD. The IRS1/2-PI3K-AKT
  stimulation also leads to the activation of mTOR which increases the proliferation,
  and stimulates the expression of HIF-1α, respectively, it initiates the angiogenesis
  process. The AKT interaction with the IKBKB/CHUK/IKBKG complex is followed by the
  activation of RELA/REL/NFκB1 which will lead to the increased expression of BCL2
  Like 1- BCL2L1, and BCL2-associated X, apoptosis regulator-BAX, two genes which
  form a complex involved in apoptosis. The AKT activation phosphorylates the mTOR
  pathway, leading to the stimulated transcription of HIF1α, IL-1β, and increased
  proliferation. The leptin – Ob-Rb interaction causes the activation of COX-2 – PGE-2,
  and the prostaglandin and in EP2/4 receptor. This is followed by the cAMP-PKA-CREB
  activation. CREB will bind to the Promoter 1.3/II of aromatase and it will stimulate
  the AROMASE (CYP19A) gene transcription. The adiponectin interaction with one of
  its two receptors, AdipoR1 or AdipoR2 leads to the adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine,
  interacting with PH domain and leucine zipper 1 APPL1 phosphorylation, which will
  activate protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor Type 1-PTP1B. The PTP1B represses
  Janus kinase-JAK by direct interaction or through the activation of suppressor of
  cytokine signaling 3 - SOCS3. The tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type
  1, also known as protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), also leads to the repression
  of RAF, and the ERK/PIASX alpha/SRF complex, thus inhibiting proliferation. The
  APPL1-PPARα or APPL1/AMPK-IKK causes the NFκB inhibition, leading to apoptosis.
  The overstimulation of the ER leads to the activation of GRB2, AKT, and mTOR.
