caption: Coregulation of gene transcription by p53 and Smad complexes. In the absence
  of cellular stress p53 is maintained at a low concentration by its negative regulator
  MDM2 [, , ]. MDM2 acts to poly-ubiquitinate p53, which targets the tumour suppressor
  to the proteasome for degradation. In response to DNA damage p53 is phosphorylated
  at defined Ser/Thr residues resulting in its stabilisation and dissociation from
  MDM2 []. In addition signalling via the Ras/MAPK pathway CK1δ/ε can also result
  in the activating phosphorylation of p53 []. Activated wild-type p53 can act synergistically
  with Smads to increase the transcription of a subset of genes for example, p21,
  PAI-1 [, ]. The model depicted was originally proposed by Piccolo and colleagues
  and elegantly demonstrates how p53 and Smads may interact [–]. For synergism to
  occur, the target gene must possess both a DNA-SBE and a p53 response element (RE)
  to which the activated Smad complex and p53 bind respectively. Once bound at their
  respective sequences a direct interaction between Smads and p53 may occur in which
  the N-terminal MH1 domain of Smads2/3 binds the N-terminal transactivational domain
  (TA) of p53 [–]. Association within the gene promoter acts to maximally induce gene
  transcription.
