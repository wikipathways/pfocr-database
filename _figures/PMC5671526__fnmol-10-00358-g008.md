caption: Schematic representations of potential mechanisms of PEBP1 in enhancing inflammatory
  response and neuron apoptosis after I/R injury. Under normal condition, PEBP1 binds
  to Raf-1 and inhibits the Raf-1/MEK/ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway indirectly. Following
  MCAO/R, I/R stimulus induces an increase in the protein of PEBP1 and activates PKC,
  which in turn promotes the phosphorylation of PEBP1. The phosphorylation of PEBP1
  inhibits the interaction between PEBP1 and Raf-1, and relieves the Raf-1/MEK/ERK/NF-κB
  signaling pathway. Subsequently, the released p-PEBP1 from Raf-1 binds to another
  binding partner PC-PLC. The phosphorylated PEBP1 promotes PC-PLC activation, which
  further enhances NF-κB signaling pathway and regulates autophagy negatively. Finally,
  excessive NF-κB signaling and abnormal autophagy enhance the inflammatory response
  and neuron apoptosis, and aggravates cerebral I/R injury. The switch of PEBP1 from
  Raf-1 to PC-PLC was inhibited by mutation the Ser153 of PEBP1 to alanine.
