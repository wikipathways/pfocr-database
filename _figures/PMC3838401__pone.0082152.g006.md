caption: 'The expression of stlA is increased in response to nutrient limitation and
  we have identified 3 nutrient-associated regulators that all affect stlA expression.
  TyrR is required for stlA expression whilst σS and Lrp are needed for normal levels
  of stlA expression. Lrp also affects the levels of BCFA in the cell, presumably
  through a regulatory affect on bkd expression. The BarA/UvrY two-component pathway
  contributes to the post-transcriptional regulation of stlA expression, as described
  in the text. ST: 3’-5’-dihydroxy-4-isopropylstilbene; Phe: phenylalanine; CA: cinnamic
  acid; Leu: leucine; Bkd: branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase; BCFA: branched-chain
  fatty acids; IV-CoA: isovaleryl-CoA.'
