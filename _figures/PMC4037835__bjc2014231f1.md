caption: The MDC–MMSET–UBC9–53BP1–BRCA1 pathway. In response to DNA double-stand breaks,
  MDC1 directly binds to histone H2A variant H2AX, regulating cellular responses to
  DNA repair by BRCA1 and 53BP1. Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 needs to be SUMOylated
  through the activity of UBC9-PIAS1/4 at sites of DNA damage to increase its ubiquitin
  ligase activity. Multiple myeloma SET domain is required for the recruitment of
  53BP1 to DNA damage sites.
