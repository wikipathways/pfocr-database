caption: 'Crosstalk between the Hedgehog (Hh) and PI3K pathways in hematological malignancies.
  T-ALL: Red lines indicate a direct interaction between the two pathways. Inhibition
  of phosphorylated Akt downregulates Gli1 via GSK3ß, and dual inhibition of Akt and
  Gli1 synergistically induces cell death Additionally, FOXC1 and Gli1 form a positive
  feedback loop, where FOXC1 stabilizes Gli1 while Gli1 upregulates FOXC1 via Akt.
  CLL: green lines highlight a potential crosstalk between the two pathways. Dual
  inhibition of Gli1 and PI3K or mTOR leads to enhanced cell death compared to single-agent
  therapy, suggesting a cooperative effect. AML: yellow lines depict the interplay
  between the two pathways in AML. Triple inhibition of FLT3, PI3K, and GLI1 synergistically
  inhibits cell proliferation. Moreover, Gli1 inhibition downregulates Akt, sensitizing
  AML cells to targeted therapies. These findings suggest that targeting the crosstalk
  between the Hh and PI3K pathways may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for
  various hematological malignancies'
