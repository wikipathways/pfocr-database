caption: ERα and ERK2 up-regulate hsa-miR-196a2* upon cell treatment with E2, resulting
  in the down-regulation of TP63, with consequent decrease in cell proliferation.
  Although E2-ERα, in collaboration with ERK2, is overall pro-proliferative in ERα-positive
  breast cancer cells, this model, based upon our findings, reveals that E2-ERα-ERK2
  does regulate a pathway that has a net antiproliferative and tumor-suppressive effect.
  Potential modulation of this hsa-miR-196a2*-TP63 circuit might be capable of reducing
  the growth stimulatory actions of estrogens in ERα-positive breast cancer. Our findings
  also suggest that enhancement of this axis in ERα-negative breast cancers by alteration
  in miR-196a2* expression might also suppress cancer cell invasiveness and the aggressiveness
  of these breast cancers in a manner independent of ERα.
