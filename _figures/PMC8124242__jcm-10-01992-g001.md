caption: 'The probable atherogenic role of electronegative LDL (LDL(−)/L5) in patients
  with AIRDs. The increased levels of LDL (−) may be produced by lipolysis with non-esterified
  fatty acid (NEFA) loading in patients with diabetes. Cigarette smoking is associated
  with L5 formation and LOX-1-induced atherosclerosis. C-reactive protein induces
  LOX-1 expression. L5/LDL (−) and the LOX-1 signaling pathway lead to atherogenesis,
  vascular inflammation, and platelet activation/aggregation. LDL: low-density lipoprotein;
  LOX-1: lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1; HTN: hypertension;
  DM: diabetes mellitus; NSAIDs: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Abs.: autoantibodies;
  oxLDL: oxidized LDL; IL-1β: interleukin 1β; CVD: cardiovascular disease.'
