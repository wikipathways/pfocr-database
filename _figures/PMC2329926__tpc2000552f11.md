caption: Model for the Activation of the HSP70A Promoter by MgProto and Heme.A strongly
  abbreviated pathway for the synthesis of heme and chlorophyll, starting with Glu,
  is indicated. (1) Feedback inhibition of GluTR by heme; (2) feedback regulation
  from the Mg-tetrapyrrole branch of the pathway mediated by the Flu protein (); (3)
  a direct activating effect of light on the first steps of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis.
  Details of the model are presented in the Discussion.
