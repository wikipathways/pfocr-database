  the signaling efficiency of the Hog1 MAP kinase cascade in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

caption: Proteins that are only involved in the SHO1 branch are shown in light green.
  Proteins that are specific to the SLN1 branch are colored light blue. Pbs2 and Hog1
  are common to both the SHO1 and SLN1 branches. The proteins separated by a thrash
  (/) are functionally redundant. The yellow horizontal bar represents the plasma
  membrane (PM). Arrows indicate activation, whereas the inverted T-shaped bars represent
  inhibition. Double-headed arrows indicate the physical interactions of the proteins.
  Not all the known components or interactions are shown.
