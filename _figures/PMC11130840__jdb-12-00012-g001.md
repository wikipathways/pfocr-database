caption: PCP-mediated signaling pathway in Drosophila and mouse. Planar cell polarity
  (PCP) signaling in flies and mice is organized similarly. Orthologous genes (have
  similar colors) are shown. Observe the heterophilic interactions between the proteins
  fz/Fzd and vang/Vangl, and the homophilic interactions between the fmi/Celsr pair.
  While the mechanism of Drosophila frizzled activation is yet unknown, at least some
  of the ligands in vertebrates are known. Not every paralog of vertebrates has been
  linked to PCP signaling. Ankrd6, also known as Diversin, is Ankyrin repeat 6 and
  may be orthologous to Diego
