caption: LncRNAs play a ceRNA regulatory role in RA (by Figdraw). This figure delineates
  the intricate interplay between lncRNAs, miRNAs, and their downstream target genes
  or signaling pathways, with a focus on apoptosis regulation. These networks were
  curated from experimental and bioinformatic analyses, underscoring lncRNAs as central
  regulators of apoptosis-associated pathways. The diagram highlights potential therapeutic
  targets for RA, where dysregulated ncRNA interactions contribute to pathogenic mechanisms
