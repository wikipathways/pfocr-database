caption: 'The biosynthetic pathway: nucleic acid detection from within the cytosol.
  (a) The RLRs detect pathogen-derived RNA within the cytosol to induce the production
  of IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. The TBK1, IKK, and MAVS pathways lead to activation
  of the transcription factors for the induction of IFN and other cytokine genes.
  ➊ RIG-I signal transduction is regulated by TRIM25- and RIPLET-mediated ubiquitination
  and translocation to the site of signaling by 14-3-3ε. ➋ MAVS activity is regulated
  by polymerization, and signaling from mitochondria results in production of type
  I and III IFN, whereas peroxisomal signaling induces the production only of type
  III IFN. (b) cGAS and the ALRs detect pathogen-derived DNA from within the cytosol
  and nucleus to induce the production of IFN. ➌ In the presence of DNA, the enzyme
  cGAS converts ATP and GTP to the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP. ➍ Production of cGAMP
  induces the activation and trafficking of STING to poorly defined sites of signaling
  in an ATG9- and VSP34-dependent manner. TBK1 is recruited to this site of signaling
  to induce the production of type I IFN. ➎ Viral DNA within the nucleus can be detected
  by IFI16 for the production of type I IFN in a STING-dependent manner. Therefore,
  the trafficking of this receptor or another factor from the nucleus to the cytosol
  may regulate IFI16-dependent signaling. (c) The inflammasome-mediated response to
  DNA within the cytosol. ➏ AIM2 detection of cytosolic DNA activates inflammasome
  formation, which induces cell death and the maturation of IL-1β. ➐ Secretion of
  this cytokine requires a noncanonical route that is independent of trafficking through
  the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Several possibilities have been proposed
  for IL-1β release that include routes through lysosomal compartments, multivesicular
  bodies, or pores created during pyroptotic cell death. (Solid lines indicate signal
  transduction; dotted lines indicate trafficking events.) (Abbreviations: AIM, absent
