caption: Schematic representation of the different experimental approaches for the
  study of the metabolism of stem and progenitor cells. In the left panel are depicted
  the untargeted metabolic analysis, metabolic fingerprint (upper left) and single-cell
  metabolomics (lower left). The study of the whole metabolite content (untargeted
  metabolic analysis) of the samples can be performed by using mass spectrometry (MS)
  and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In the right panel are figured the targeted
  metabolic approaches, metabolic flux analysis (upper right) and in vivo cell metabolism
  (lower right), which focus on the study of metabolites possibly involved in a specific
  pathway. Several techniques can be applied to study targeted metabolic analysis,
  including MS, NMR, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectrometry
  (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission tomography (SPECT),
  oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and Biosensor.
