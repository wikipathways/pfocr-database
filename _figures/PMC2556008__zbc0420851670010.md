caption: Hypothetical mechanism whereby FRNK inhibits TGF-β-induced  α-SMA expression
  in the presence and absence of FAK.  TGF-β-induced α-SMA expression and myofibroblast
  differentiation  requires the involvement of multiple signaling initiated through
  the  integrins, extracellular matrix (ECM) environment, and TGF-β  receptors (TGF-βR).
  Recent evidence demonstrates that  certain integrins, in cooperation with the cytoskeleton,
  are capable of  activating latent TGF-β through binding to latency-associated protein  (,  ,  ).
  TGF-β induces  α-SMA expression through two pathways; the major pathway through
  ERK  MAPK is FAK-dependent, and the minor pathway through p38 MAPK is  FAK-independent.
  FRNK can inhibit TGF-β-induced α-SMA expression  through inhibition of FAK activation
  and inhibition of the FAK/ERK-mediated  pathway. FRNK also can inhibit the pathway
  of TGF-β-induced α-SMA  expression mediated by p38, potentially through inhibition
  of critical  signaling proteins upstream of p38 (i.e. Src kinase).
