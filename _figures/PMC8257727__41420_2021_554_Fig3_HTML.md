caption: 'Taxane treatment blocks cell proliferation, induces apoptosis and different
  types of cell responses to stress—autophagy, senescence and inflammation. Low-dose
  PTX treatment induces p53-mediated translocation of p21 into the cytoplasm where
  it is phosphorylated by Akt [] and inhibits the cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis
  via binding PCNA []. PTX induces a downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2
  and an upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Bax [, ]. These alterations are
  responsible for the triggering of MOMP and the stimulation of the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway []. In addition, PTX promotes ER stress []. Possibly, ER stress derives
  from gene expression modulation caused by direct paclitaxel-mediated p53 activation.
  Damage of the ER may cause a release of Ca2+ that provokes Ca2+ overload and subsequent
  mitochondrial damage, leading to increased ROS production []. PTX stimulates nonlethal
  cell response to stress like autophagy via upregulation ATG5 []. In addition, senescence
  is induced by PTX manifested in increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase
  (SA-βgal) activity, depressed cell proliferation, increased p16 INK4a expression,
  and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors such as (Il1α, Il6,
  Mmp3, Mmp9, Cxcl1, Cxcl10, and Ccl20), as well as downregulation of Lamin B1 [].
  The latter is an E2F target gene [] and a decrease of its expression during senescence
  is induced by oncogenic Ras and mediated by p53 and a retinoblastoma protein pRb
  []. Dashed arrow demonstrates translocation. Different types of cell death induced
  by taxanes are highlighted in different colors: intrinsic apoptotic pathway is marked
  in green; extrinsic apoptotic pathway—in light brown; p53-dependent apoptosis is
  marked in blue; autophagy—in dark green; senescence—in light blue.'
