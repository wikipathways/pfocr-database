caption: Neutrophils reprogramming to PMN-MDSCs. GM-CSF attaches to the neutrophil
  receptor, which undergoes gene rearrangement via STAT5 phosphorylation, leading
  to scl27a2 gene transcription and FATP2 expression. This mechanism leads to the
  conversion of neutrophils to PMN-MDSCs. Once the reprogramming is complete and FATP2
  is attached to the membrane, the PMN-MDSCs will absorb the arachidonic acid, which
  will be responsible for the synthesis and the secretion of PGE2. The latter, as
  well as iNOS (produced in response to STAT1 signaling pathway) and arginase (produced
  in response to STAT3 signaling pathway) will induce the suppression of CD8 T lymphocytes
  and therefore lead to the proliferation of cancer cells.
