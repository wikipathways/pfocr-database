caption: Basic pathway of mGluR5 agonist in PD. Post activation of microglia by the
  presence of αS at the membrane inactivates membrane receptor mGluR5 and its downstream
  G-protein. Sequentially activated transcription factors NFκB p65 and TNFα enhance
  inflammatory cytokine release and induce neurodegeneration. Agonists such as CPHG
  could ameliorate this pathway by increasing mGluR5 expression via reducing lysosomal
  degradation, further downregulating related inflammatory signalling activation and
  subsequent inhibition of microglia-mediated inflammation to prevent neurotoxicity.
