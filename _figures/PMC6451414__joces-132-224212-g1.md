caption: 'Exosome and microvesicle biogenesis. (A) Exosomes are formed in the lumen
  of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) through two biological signaling cascades: (1) the
  endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent, and (2) the
  ESCRT-independent pathways. In the ESCRT-dependent pathway, exosomes are produced
  by the action of four different ESCRT complexes (ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and III). In
  the ESCRT-independent pathway, exosomes are created by the accumulation of ceramide
  when acid sphingomyelinases (aSmases) and neutral sphingomyelinases (nSmases) hydrolyze
  sphingomyelin. Rab proteins mediate the transport of the MVB, and SNARE molecules
  drive the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane. Fusion of membranes leads
  to the secretion of different subpopulations of vesicles (e.g. Exo-L, Exo-S and
  exomeres), which exhibit distinct DNA, RNA and protein signatures. (B) Microvesicles
  are secreted through the invagination of the plasma membrane. Flippases and floppases
  rearrange the lipid content of the outer layer of the plasma membrane, resulting
  in the enrichment of phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and
  ceramide. Lipid remodeling changes the curvature of the plasma membrane, thereby
  forming the budding of the microvesicle, which is triggered by increases in Ca2+
  concentration. The exact mechanism of microvesicle excision remains mostly unknown.
  However, the ESCRT-III complex and changes in actin dynamics driven by the small
  GTPase RhoA and cofilin 1 may be involved.'
