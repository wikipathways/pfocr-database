caption: Blood-cell development progresses from a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) through
  sequential stages of differentiation, ultimately giving rise to the individual mature
  cell types found in the circulation, including platelets, erythrocytes, monocytes,
  neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells.
  Cytokines and growth factors that support the survival, proliferation, or differentiation
  of each type of cell are shown. The highlighted sequence shows the differentiation
  pathway for granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils). Granulocyte–macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) supports the differentiation of common myeloid
  progenitors (CMP) into common granulocyte–monocyte progenitors (GM). Granulocyte
  colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) supports the differentiation of committed granulocyte
  progenitors (GP) into mature granulocytes. BCP denotes B-cell progenitor, CLP common
  lymphoid progenitor, EP erythrocyte progenitor, EPO erythropoietin, IL interleukin,
  M-CSF macrophage colony-stimulating factor, MEP megakaryocyte–erythrocyte progenitor,
  MkP megakaryocyte progenitor, MP monocyte progenitor, NKP natural-killer-cell progenitor,
  SCF stem-cell factor, TCP T-cell progenitor, TNK T-cell–natural-killer-cell progenitor,
  and TPO thrombopoietin.
