caption: Schematic representation of actin regulatory proteins and their interactions
  with components of innate immunity. Under homeostatic conditions multiple innate
  immune sensors are directly or indirectly linked to the actin cytoskeleton. Deregulation
  of actin cytoskeleton occurring during tumor progression or following viral infections
  leads to the activation of RLR signaling activation. (a) Focal adhesions kinase
  (FAK) associates with the actin cytoskeleton in resting cells, but, upon actin reorganization
  due to virus entry, FAK relocalizes to the mitochondria where it interacts with
  MAVS, acting as a scaffold between immune signaling and actin cytoskeleton at the
  mitochondrial membrane. (b) The antiviral sensor RIG-I directly binds F-actin by
  the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) in resting cells
  and rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton lead to its rapid relocalization to
  the mitochondria, where it interacts with MAVS. (c) Zyxin partially co-localizes
  with MAVS at mitochondria, where it sustains and stabilizes physical interactions
  between RLRs and MAVS by its N-terminal domain. (d) Fascin 1 (FSCN1) constitutively
  binds IKKε, restraining RIG-I signaling pathway. Upon actin reorganization, IKKε
  is released and associates with TBK1 which in turn phosphorylates IRF3. (e) In uninfected
  cells, Filamin A sequesters a pool of inactive RNase L in the cytoskeleton preventing
  viral entry by maintaining a barrier. Viral infection alters actin cytoskeleton
  and activates RNase L, which cleaves single-stranded viral and host RNAs, leading
  to the activation of the antiviral response by RIG-I and MDA5. (f) PKR binds gelsolin
  (GSN) under homeostatic conditions and in turn sequesters it in an inactive conformation,
  reducing its association with actin. Upon virus entry, PKR is activated by double
  stranded viral RNA, releases GSN, which can promote actin depolymerization, and
  activates RLRs signaling. (g) NOD2 binds RAC-1 and co-localizes with F-actin in
  membrane ruffles. Upon actin cytoskeleton rearrangements such as membrane ruffles
  disruption, NOD2 is released and can interact with RIP2 leading to NF-kB activation
  and IL-8 production. The activation of RLR signaling culminates with the production
  of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines.
