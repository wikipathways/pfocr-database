caption: CSCs alter the composition and functional properties of immune cell subsets,
  which results in an impaired CSC recognition and elimination by the immune system.
  CSCs produce soluble molecules such as periostin, CCL2, MIC-1, CSFs, and TGF-β to
  attract macrophages and drive their M2 polarization. The secretion of CCL2 and CCL5
  recruits Tregs into the TME, and IDO and TGF-β facilitate the generation of Tregs
  from naïve CD4+ T cells. The extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C inhibits T
  cell proliferation by interfering with the T cell receptor signaling pathway. Additionally,
  the immunomodulatory enzyme IDO impairs the expansion of effector T cells through
  accumulation of tryptophan catabolites, which also increases the generation of Tregs.
  VEGF produced by CSCs supports the induction of angiogenesis, which is critical
  for tumor growth, and promotes the expression of PD-1 by CD8+ T cells. Additionally,
  CSCs avoid the recognition by CD8+ T cells and NK cells by reducing the surface
  expression of HLA class I molecules and NKG2DL, respectively. The ligation of PD-L1
  expressed by CSCs to PD-1 on effector T cells decreases their proliferation and
  IFN-γ production or leads to apoptosis. Furthermore, CSCs express the coinhibitory
  molecule CD47, which inhibits phagocytosis by macrophages due to repositioning of
  its ligand SIRPα.
