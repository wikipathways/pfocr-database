caption: Schematic description of the Kavain mediated PGC-1α-adiponectin-HO-1-MnSOD
  in adipocyte infected with P.gingivalis. P. gingivalis induces adipocytes expansion
  and remodeling evidenced by an increase in adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy
  leading to pro-inflammatory molecules TNF-α, NFkB and iNOS pathway induction, which
  are associated with a decrease of PGC-1α and adiponectin. On the other hand, Kavain-mediated
  stimulation of PGC-1α signaling increases HO-1-adiponectin that is associated with
  the reduction of ROS and pro-inflammatory molecules TNF-α, NFkB and iNOS and normalization
  of adipocyte function.
