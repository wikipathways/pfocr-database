caption: 'Glucose oxidation pathways in Ralstonia solanacearum strains highlight the
  absence of key pathway genes. Central metabolic pathways consisting of glycolysis,
  the Entner-Doudoroff (ED), and the pentose phosphate (PP) pathways among 63 strains
  of Ralstonia spp. were mapped for the annotation of relevant genes based on comparative
  genome analysis (see ). All Ralstonia solanacearum strains (53) lacked glycolysis
  and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OxPPP) genes pfk and gnd that code
  for phosphofructokinase and 6PG dehydrogenase, respectively. Among all the 63 strains
  of Ralstonia spp. studied, only R. pickettii () showed the presence of pfk. The
  missing genes are highlighted in yellow boxes (gnd and pfk). Reactions between metabolites
  in the pathways, namely, glycolysis, ED pathway, OxPPP, non-OxPPP, and fructose
  metabolic pathway are indicated. Genes coding for the respective enzymes to catalyze
  the reactions and metabolites are presented in abbreviated form. The abbreviations
  used are the following: G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; FBP,
  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; G-1,5-6P, glucono-1-5-lactone-6-phosphate; 6PG, phosphogluconate; KDPG,
  2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate; Ru5P, ribulose 5-phosphate; R5P, ribose 5-phosphate;
  glk, glucokinase; pgi, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; pfk, phosphofructokinase;
  tpi, triosephosphate isomerase; pgk, phosphoglycerate kinase; gpm, phosphoglycerate
  mutase; eno, enolase; pyk, pyruvate kinase; zwf, G6P dehydrogenase; pgl, phospho-gluconolactonoase;
  edd, phosphogluconate dehydratase; gnd, 6PG dehydrogenase; eda, 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphogluconate
  aldolase, tkt, transketolase; rpe, ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase; rpi, ribose 5-phosphate
  isomerase; tal, transaldolase; fbp, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase I; fruK, 1-phosphofructokinase;
