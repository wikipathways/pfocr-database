caption: The KEGG calvin cycle and starch synthesis pathway for T. pseudonana during
  N depletion compared to N replete conditions (ND vs. NR). The serial number represent
  the related enzyme and the negative number indicate the down-expressed fold change
  of the genes (The opposite is up-expressed). The Inside the parentheses is the protein
  fold change.
