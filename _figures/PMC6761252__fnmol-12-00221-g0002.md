caption: Neural circuitry of olfactory fear conditioning (OFC). Olfactory conditioned
  stimuli (CS-O) travel through the ORNs to the OB then via the mitral cell axons
  (forming the olfactory tract), information is carried to the amygdala. Evidence
  suggests that the likely regions of termination in the amygdala are either the MeA,
  CMe or BLA. From here, the proposed pathway to the lateral amygdala (LA) is through
  the periamygdaloid complex (PaC). All CS information is then processed through the
  central (CeA) amygdala to elicit a fear response. The BLA and LA project heavily
  to the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus (Hip). The LA also sends afferents
  to the EC.
