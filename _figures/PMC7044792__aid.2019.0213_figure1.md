caption: Extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. (A) FasL/Fas interaction leads to the activation
  of Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD). FADD binds to the receptor death
  domain, c-FLIP, and sequentially activates caspase-8. The multiprotein complex formed
  by the receptor death domain, FADD, and caspase-8 is called the DISC. Conformational
  changes of activated caspase-8 result in activation of the effector downstream caspase-3
  and caspase-7, which in turn leads to cleavage of vital cellular proteins, activation
  of DNase, and consequent cell death. (B) TNF/TNFR1 interaction leads to FADD recruitment
  as well as activation of a protein called TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD).
  TRADD recruits RIPK1. When RIPK1 is deubiquitylated, the TNF pathway outcome is
  apoptosis. RIPK1 assembles in the cytosol with TRADD, FADD, procaspase-8, and a
  long isoform of c-FLIP generating autocatalytic cleavage and activation, releasing
  active caspase-8, and culminating in cell death. (C) TRADD by itself can also activate
  the mitochondrial (intrinsic pathway). In addition, the generated caspase-8 downstream
  to TRADD promotes proteolysis of BID, generating tBID, which can also engage the
  mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway to amplify the apoptotic response. Effects of
  individual HIV proteins are annotated. TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HIV, human immunodeficiency
  virus; BID, BH3 interacting domain death agonist; tBID, truncated BID; c-FLIP, cellular
  FLICE (FADD-like interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein; DISC,
  death-inducing signaling complex; RIPK, receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein
  kinase.
