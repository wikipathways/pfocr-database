caption: Schematical representation of the protective mechanism of H2O2 preconditioning
  for improving the therapeutic potential of BMSCs. A low dose of H2O2 (50 μM) acts
  in the signaling pathways as a second messenger. H2O2 preconditioning-induced BMSC
  protection seems to involve augmenting the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  and inhibiting GSK-3β activity, leading to enhancing abilities of BMSC proliferation,
  migration, angiogenesis, and anti-apoptosis. And the PI3K/Akt pathway is also one
  of the downstream pathways that activated the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis [, , –]. In addition,
  low-dose H2O2 directly activated this pathway through diffusion into the cytoplasm
  as a second messenger may be another activation pathway [, ]. The PI3K inhibitor
  (LY294002) could block the protective effect induced by 50 μM H2O2 preconditioning
