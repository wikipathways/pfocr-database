caption: A model for the regulation of T cell-mediated adaptive immune responses to
  apoptotic cells. (A) At the resting state, no activation of the TCR or the costimulatory
  pathway takes place. (B) In immunostimulatory contexts (such as AC ingestion by
  APCs in the presence of LPS, TLR ligands, or mycobacterial antigens), TCR binding
  to AC antigens presented in the context of MHC-I/II and the costimulatory signaling
  mediated by binding of CD28 by mainly CD86 (or CD86 and CD80) take place. Thus,
  activation of the costimulatory pathway ensures effector T cell (Teff) activation
  and proliferation, leading to mounting of an immune response to AC antigens. (C)
  In non-immunostimulatory contexts, such as AC ingestion by APCs in the absence of
  additional immunopotentiating stimuli (e.g., TLR ligands or mycobacterial antigens),
  the costimulatory signaling mediated by CD28 is downregulated. Rather, CD80 is upregulated,
  which binds mainly to CTLA-4 (CD80 binds CTLA-4 with much higher affinity than CD28),
  initiating the coinhibitory signaling that leads to Teff suppression and apoptosis.
  Even if some costimulatory signal is conveyed (by binding of some CD80 molecules
  to CD28), the CTLA-4-mediated coinhibitory signal predominates and usually overrides
  costimulation. Other signals are possible (e.g., binding of CD80 to PD-L1 on T cells
  or binding of PD-L1 on APCs to PD-1 on T cells) and might have some contribution
  to the overall coinhibitory signaling delivered to T cells, although their significance
  and relative contribution have yet to be established. Overall, the coinhibitory
  signaling to T cells triggers the inhibition of Teff functions; and in this context,
  differentiation of Tregs may also be enhanced.
