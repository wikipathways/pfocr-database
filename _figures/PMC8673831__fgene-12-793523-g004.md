caption: 'SNPs in 3′UTR of target genes associated with diabetes: (A) Downregulation
  of WFS1 due to SNPs rs1046322 (G>A) and rs9457 (G>C) via miRNAs miR185 and miR668
  induces β-cell apoptosis and declines insulin secretion due to ER Ca+2 stress. (B)
  SNP rs13702 (C>T) in LPL gene disrupts binding site for miR410. Its overexpression
  has pathological impact on liver and muscles leading to insulin resistance; whereas
  in adipose tissue it increases glucose metabolism. (C) SNP rs2229295 (C>A) of HNF1B
  creates new binding site for miR214-5p and miR550-5p, increasing glucose metabolism.
  (D) CDKN2B’s downregulation due to SNP rs1063192 (T>C) by miR323-5p maintains glucose
  homeostasis and promotes proliferation of β-cells. (E) Over-expression of FABP2
  due to SNP rs11724758 (G>A) activates PPAR signaling pathway which in-turn leads
  to lipid metabolism.'
