caption: A, In ALKF1174L-mutant NB cells, AKT is phosphorylated at T308 and S473 by
  ALK-activated PI3K and mTORC2, respectively, promoting cell survival, transcriptional
  activation through release of 4E-BP1 from eIF4, and ribosome biogenesis through
  activation of RPS6. Activation of RPS6 in turn leads to inhibition of PI3K, creating
  a feedback loop that permits fine-tuning of proliferative and survival signaling.
  In MYCN-amplified, ALKF1174L-mutated NB cells, MYCN drives cellular proliferation,
  leading to increased dependence on RPS6 and 4E-BP1 activity. B, Treatment of these
  cells with crizotinib as a single agent inadequately inhibits mutant ALK, leading
  to marginally reduced PI3K (pAKTT308) and mTORC2 (pAKTS473) activities and a modest
  reduction in cell survival. Although the reduction in pAKT levels leads to a minimal
  reduction of pRPS6 in MYCN-amplified cells, this response is not sustained, as deregulated
  MYCN maintains upregulated mTORC1 activity. C, Single-agent treatment with specific
  ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors, such as Torin2, blocks both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity,
  downregulating pRPS6 and pAKTS473, although amplified MYCN continues to promote
  persistent mTORC1 activation and some level of PI3K feedback inhibition. D, The
  combination of crizotinib and Torin2 in MYCN-amplified cells targets the activities
  of PI3K, mTORC1 and mTORC2 simultaneously; continued loss of feedback inhibition
  of PI3K activity via incomplete suppression of MYCN/mTORC1/RPS6 signaling synergizes
  with crizotinib-driven inhibition of ALK to downregulate PI3K activity and, in turn,
  AKTT308 phosphorylation.
