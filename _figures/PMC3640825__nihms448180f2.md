caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for gliotoxin. Following the condensation of
  l-Phe and l-Ser by GliP, the oxidation of the α carbon of l-Phe was catalyzed by
  GliC. A series of subsequent reactions including a GliT-mediated tailoring reaction
  result in gliotoxin formation. Compound 3 was isolated as a stable shunt metabolite
  following co-expression of GliP and GliC. aCompound 5 is a hypothetic product which
  has not been detected in HPLC-DAD-MS.
