caption: Schematic representation for the role of α-toxin in the inhibition of macrophage
  apoptosis by S. aureus. S. aureus is recognized by TLR2 (1), initiating a signaling
  cascade via the NFκB pathway (2). Simultaneously, phagocytosed bacteria (3) escape
  from phagosomes through α-toxin-mediated lysis of the membrane (4). The cytoplasmic
  bacteria then interact with intracellular/cytoplasmatic receptors (5), triggering
  signaling pathways that lead to NFκB activation (6). Activated NFκB either directly
  (7), or indirectly, via IL-6-dependent autocrine signaling (8), stimulates Mcl-1
  expression, which results in cytoprotection of the infected cells.
