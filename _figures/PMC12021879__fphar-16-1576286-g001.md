caption: 'Mechanistic map of metabolic bone disease: The pathogenesis of MBD primarily
  involves four key pathological dimensions: abnormal bone resorption, abnormal bone
  formation, abnormal mineral deposition, and metabolic factors. ① the core regulatory
  pathways for abnormal bone resorption are the RANKL/RANK/OPG system, NF-κB and Ca2+-NFATc1
  signaling pathway. PTH and vitamin D hormones also significantly influence bone
  resorption. ② Abnormal bone formation mainly involves osteoblast dysfunction. The
  Wnt/β-catenin and BMP/Smad signaling pathway play key roles in osteoblast differentiation
  and function. Other signaling pathways such as Hedgehog, Notch, and FGF also participate
  in the regulation of osteoblasts. ③ Abnormal mineral deposition is primarily manifested
  as disorders in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency and parathyroid
  dysfunction can lead to imbalances in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Additionally,
  FGF23 plays a crucial role in the regulation of mineral metabolism. ④ The impact
  of metabolic factors mainly involves the effects of abnormalities in sugar, fat,
  and protein metabolism on bone metabolism'
