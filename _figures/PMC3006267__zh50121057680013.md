caption: 'Model for the turnover of P63 on the surface of type II cells. SP-A binds
  to P63 on the PM of type II cells (“a”) resulting in the: blockage of basal or stimulated
  surfactant secretion (“b”); initiation of a signaling cascade involving PI3-kinase
  and Akt (“c”); and internalization of the SP-A-P63 complex via a clathrin-mediated
  pathway (“d”). PI3-kinase is also stimulated by cAMP interaction with Epac, the
  exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (“e”). Activation of Akt results in
  the forward transport of P63 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the PM (“f”) and
  the stimulation of P63 recycling (“g”). The end result of the latter 2 pathways
  is the presence of a constant or elevated level of P63 on the cell surface necessary
  to maintain SP-A-mediated lipid uptake (“h”) and block further lamellar body (LB)
  exocytosis (“h”). E.E., early endosome; S.E., sorting endosome; R.E., recycling
  endosome; AC, adenyl cyclase.'
