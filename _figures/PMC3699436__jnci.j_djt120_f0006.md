caption: Model for MyD88 inhibition alone or in combination with cisplatin in Ras-dependent
  cells. A) Ras pathway optimal activation in presence of MyD88 induces DNA repair
  enzyme ERCC1, enabling efficient DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells. B) Absence
  of MyD88 leads to the inactivation of the canonical Ras/Erk pathway, therefore decreasing
  the expression of DNA repair enzyme ERCC1 and reducing cellular DNA repair abilities,
  leading to an accumulation of DNA damage and activating the apoptotic program via
  p53. C) Combining MyD88 inhibition with cisplatin enhances DNA damage accumulation
  and increases cell death.
