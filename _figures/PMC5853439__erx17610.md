caption: A model depicting the involvement of InsP and G-protein signaling in flg
  evoked plant innate immunity. PAMPs and Pep bind to plasma membrane localized cognate
  PRR receptors and triggers cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. In the flg:FLS2 signaling pathway,
  flg-induced full Ca2+ elevation requires InsP-dependent Ca2+ release from the vacuole.
  The Ca2+ conducting channel on the tonoplast facilitating this conductance is not
  known. Additionally, previous findings indicate an extracellular Ca2+ influx mediated
  by an unidentified plasma membrane Ca2+-conducting channel. G-proteins AGB1 and
  XLG2 are involved in flg evoked innate immune signaling, in which AGB1 and AGG form
  the G-protein complex with XLG2, which is also physically associated with FLS2.
  In contrast, Pep-dependent Ca2+ elevation is primarily sourced from apoplastic Ca2+
  that is mediated through a plasma membrane CNGC channel. Molecular mechanisms responsible
  for Ca2+ elevation induced by another PAMP elf are still unrevealed, but the pathway
  is different from that induced by either flg or Pep. Although there is specificity
  for the mechanisms facilitating cytosolic Ca2+ elevation, both PAMP and Pep triggered
  signaling cascades share similar downstream events such as NO and ROS generation,
  MPK phosphorylation and defense gene activation, eventually leading to basal defense.
