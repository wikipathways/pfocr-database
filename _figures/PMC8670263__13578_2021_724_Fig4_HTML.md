caption: The cGAS–STING pathway is associated with diabetes through DsbA-L. A Adiponectin
  promotes the expression of PPAR-regulated genes and improves insulin sensitivity
  in diabetic mice [, ]. Adiponectin activated the AMPK pathway increases fat oxidation
  and glucose transporter localization to the membrane [, ]. AMPK activation inhibits
  PPAR expression and TNF-α and IL-6 emission in adipose tissue []. In addition to
  directly promoting adiponectin multimerization, DsbA-L also facilitates energy homeostasis
  in mice, promoting energy expenditure and reducing obesity, and this regulation
  is independent of adiponectin. B Emerging evidence indicates that DsbA-L directly
  participates in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial homeostasis and inhibits
  the cGAS–STING pathway []. Obesity can promote mitochondrial damage and leak mtDNA
  by inhibiting DsbA-L. The leaked mtDNA, in turn, activates the cGAS–STING pathway,
  which in turn causes IR and metabolic syndrome. Conversely, increased DsbA-L inhibits
  mtDNA leakage, which in turn inhibits the cGAS–STING pathway. In the same metabolic
  syndrome as diabetes, we believe that this is likely to be the case as well, but
  experiments are still needed to confirm this. In addition, whether DsbA-L inhibits
  the cGAS–STING pathway exclusively by suppressing mtDNA leakage still needs to be
  further explored. DsbA-L disulfide bond A oxidoreductase-like protein, IR insulin
