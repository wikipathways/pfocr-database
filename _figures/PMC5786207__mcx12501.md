caption: Plant pathogens produce molecular mimics that modulate plant signalling pathways.
  Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) produces coronatine, a structural and functional
  mimic of jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile). Coronatine binds the plant JA receptor,
  COI1/JAZ, to activate the JA signalling pathway, which suppresses salicylic acid
  (SA)-mediated signalling and inhibits the immune response. Nematodes secrete a mimic
  of a plant peptide called CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION-related (CLE), which
  is perceived by the plant CLAVATA1 (CLV1)/CLV2 heterodimer or a tracheary element
  differentiation inhibitory factor (TDIF) receptor (TDR). It is hypothesized that
  nematode CLE peptides subvert plant CLE-mediated shoot and root meristem development
  to instead produce feeding cells for the nematode. Another class of nematode effectors
  mimics the plant C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDEs (CEPs). Plant CEPs are produced in
  the roots under nitrogen starvation and then move through xylem vessels to shoots,
  where they are recognized by two receptors, CEPR1 and CEPR2. Activation of CEPRs
  induces nitrogen-demand signals, which increase expression of nitrogen transporters,
  inhibit primary root elongation and initiate lateral root development to take up
  nitrogen. The benefit to the nematode is that nematode CEPs induce more nitrogen
  uptake and keep the size of the feeding site small for biotrophic interaction with
  plants. Nematodes need to maintain small feeding sites to prevent excessive nutrient
  drainage and allow host plants to survive. The fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum
  secretes a mimic of the plant rapid alkalinization factor (RALF) peptide. Plant
  RALF targets the FERONIA (FER) receptor to activate a plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase
  2 (AHA2) and thus alkalinizes the extracellular space in planta. RALF-induced extracellular
  alkalinization regulates the plant cell expansion required for plant growth and
  development. Fungal RALF-induced alkalinization in the plant apoplast is beneficial
  to fungal infection and multiplication but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.
  The sulphated RaxX (RaxX-sY) peptide from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) mimics
  the plant peptide hormone PSY (plant peptide containing sulphated tyrosine). RaxX-sY
  activates PSY signalling and promotes plant growth. Rice XA21 recognizes and responds
  specifically to microbial RaxX to activate the immune response. Straight lines indicate
  the secretion of pathogen molecules. Dashed lines indicate products of the endogenous
  factor from the plant. Question marks indicate pathways that have not yet been fully
  elucidated.
