caption: Mechanism of COVID-19 replication and potential cytokines-related therapeutic
  targets. In the upper part of the figure is depicted the complex mechanism of COVID-19
  infection followed by (bottom part) its replication. The cartoon also presents an
  overview of IL-6 and IL-17A (and cytokine-related available antibodies) signalling
  pathway. IL-17A binding a heterodimer receptor composed of IL-17RA and IL-17RC induces
  cytokines production. IL-17A signalling can.be blocked by antibodies targeting IL-17A
  (Secukinumab or Ixekizumab) or the A chain of its receptor (Brodalumab).
