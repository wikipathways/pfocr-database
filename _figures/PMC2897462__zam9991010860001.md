caption: Metabolic pathway of the glycine cleavage enzyme system. This system is a
  multimeric assembly of four loosely associated proteins known as P protein (GcvP
  pyridoxal phosphate-containing glycine decarboxylase), H protein (GcvH, lipoic acid-containing
  carrier), T protein (GcvT, tetrahydrofolate requiring aminomethyltransferase or
  glycine synthase), and L protein (GcvL, lipoamide dehydrogenase). 3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate;
  N5,N10-mTHF, N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate; C1 pool, pool of compounds containing
  only one carbon.
