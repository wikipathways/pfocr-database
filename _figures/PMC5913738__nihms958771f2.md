caption: Increased excitatory synaptic activity triggers Ca2+ influx through plasma
  membrane channels, resulting in the activation of multiple kinases, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  kinases (Ca2+/CaMK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nitric oxide
  synthase (NOS) and the protein phosphatase calcineurin. Neurotrophic factor signalling
  pathways are also engaged in response to fasting and exercise, resulting in the
  activation of signalling pathways involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
  RACα serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) and MAPKs. These activity-dependent and
  neurotrophic-factor-dependent signalling pathways converge on transcription factors,
  including cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), nuclear regulatory factor
  2 (NRF2; also known as NFE2L2), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and myocyte-specific enhancer
  factor 2 (MEF2), which induce the expression of many different genes that encode
  proteins involved in cellular stress adaptation. Three genes that may be particularly
  important in the enhancement of neuroplasticity and stress resistance in response
  to intermittent metabolic switching are those encoding brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF), NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α). SIRT3 localizes to the
  mitochondria, where it deacetylates proteins involved in antioxidant defence (superoxide
  dismutase [Mn], mitochondrial (SOD2)), energy production (isocitrate dehydrogenase
  [NADP], mitochondrial (IDH2); acetyl CoA synthase 2 (AceCS2; also known as ACSS1);
  and electron transport chain (ETC) proteins) and protection against apoptosis (cyclophilin
  D). PGC1 α is a key transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis that acts,
  in part, by upregulating NRF1 and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which,
  in turn, upregulate oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication
  and transcription and mitochondrial protein import. CREB, NRF2 and NF-κB induce
  the expression of antioxidant enzymes, DNA repair enzymes, anti-apoptotic proteins
  and protein chaperones and Ca2+-handling proteins. The ketone β-hydroxybutyrate
  (BHB), which is elevated during fasting and extended exercise, provides an energy
  substrate for neurons and induces the expression of BDNF. The reduction in availability
  of glucose and amino acids during fasting and exercise results in a reduction in
  the AMP:ATP ratio, which activates AMP kinase (AMPK) and, in turn, stimulates autophagy.
  The reduction in glucose and amino acid availability also reduces activation of
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and further enhances the AMPK-driven autophagy
  pathway. AMPK activates the serine/threonine-protein kinase ULK1 (ULK1) complex,
  which stimulates engulfment of damaged proteins and organelles in autophagosomes,
  which, in turn, fuse with lysosomes. Collectively, activation of these different
  pathways in response to the metabolic switch bolsters neuronal bioenergetics, improves
  Ca2+ handling and protects against oxidative, excitotoxic and proteotoxic stress.
