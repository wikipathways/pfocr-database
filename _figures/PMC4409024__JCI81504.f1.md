caption: Mutant RAS activates several canonical growth factor signaling pathways,
  including the MAPK pathway (RAF/MEK/ERK) and the PI3K pathway (PI3K/AKT/mTOR). MAPK
  and PI3K signaling events take place in part on the surface of autophagic vesicles
  and lysosomes, respectively. Autophagy consists of the sequestration of damaged
  organelles within autophagic vesicles followed by fusion with the lysosome. A subset
  of known transcriptional regulators of autophagy genes are depicted, along with
  their regulation by growth factor kinase signaling pathways under the control of
  RAS. In this issue, Cheong et al. demonstrate that RAS-driven PI3K signaling increases
  levels of CK1α, which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits nuclear localization of
  FOXO3A, a transcription factor that positively regulates the expression of key autophagy
  genes (this pathway is denoted in yellow). Dashed lines indicate pathways described
  in other reports. Arrows indicate activation; lines ending in T indicate inhibition.
  UPR, unfolded protein response; TF, transcription factor.
