caption: A model describing the neural circuitries by which the vSub may modulate
  DA neuron activity. Stimulation of the vSub by infusions of NMDA activates glutamatergic
  afferents to the NAc. This in turn is proposed to inhibit the activity of neurons
  in the VP. As a result, there is a removal of tonic inhibition of neurons in the
  VTA. In this model, we propose that the VP–VTA projection provides sufficient inhibitory
  influence to hold a subpopulation of DA neurons in an inactive state. Thus, inhibition
  of VP firing would lead to an increase in the number of VTA DA neurons firing spontaneously.
  The question mark beside the VP to VTA path indicates that, although this pathway
  is known to be present in the rat, its involvement in this response remains speculative
  at the present time.
