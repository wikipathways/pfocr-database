caption: Cross talk between the SphKs-S1P-S1PRs axis and the TGF-β1signaling pathway
  in fibrosis. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) converts sphingosine (Sph) to sphingosine
  1 phosphate (S1P), which is exported out of the cell by a number of transporters
  including the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. (1) S1P binds to its receptors
  S1PR2 and S1PR3 to activate Smad complex signaling. (2) The TGF-β1/Smad pathway
  stimulates the expression of SphK1 to activate the SphKs-S1P-S1PRs axis. (3) S1P
  gradient guides the infiltration of immune cells, such as macrophages and lymphocytes,
  which leads to the increased secretion of TGF-β1. Thus, interactions between the
  SphKs/S1P/S1PRs axis (shown in blue) and TGF-β1signaling may form a vicious cycle
  to amplify the fibrogenesis in CKDs. Interruption of this cycle using modulators
  of this axis represents a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment or prevention
  of CKD.
