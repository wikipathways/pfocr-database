caption: GP‐pathways enrichment networks. Each network is composed of glycan peaks
  (GP) indicated by oval nodes and wikiPathways gene sets indicated by rectangle nodes.
  An edge in the network represents a significant association between the GP and the
  connected pathway. Red edge indicates a significant positive correlation between
  the GP and the pathway genes, and blue edges indicate a significant anti‐correlation
  between the GP and the pathway genes, all at FDR <10%. The width of an edge is correlated
  to the associated −log(enrichment p‐value). Each pathway node is coloured according
  to the sum of −log(enrichment p‐value) of edges connected to it. Glycan structures
  contributing to each peak are listed, underscoring the structure contributing most
  to the peak.
