caption: 'Scheme of metabolic pathways where enzymes upregulated in specific growth
  phase during antibiotic production are highlighted. Enzymes related to the synthesis
  of spinosad precursors were in red rectangles; the enzymes were underlined when
  the total PAI value more than 3 which revealed it is a abundant protein in S. spinosa
  proteome. Black dot indicated a enzyme owned a peak in T2 when compared to other
  three phases; black triangle signified a protein up-regulated in T2, T3 and T4 while
  compared to T1 and had a peak in T4. Reactions are reported according to KEGG metabolic
  pathway databases and Gallo et al. []. Enzyme name abbreviations refer to Additional
  file : Table S5.'
