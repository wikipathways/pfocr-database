caption: '(A) c-Jun/activator protein-1 (AP-1) regulation and biological activity.
  (A) c-Jun/AP-1 regulation via phosphorylation: application of various extracellular
  stimuli (UV irradiation, cytokines, growth factors, stress and CD8 signaling) activates
  JNK of the MAPK pathway through phosphorylation. Activated JNK (p-JNK) potentiates
  c-Jun via phosphorylation at sites in the N-terminal domain, which triggers either
  homodimerization of c-Jun or heterodimerization with c-Fos. P-JNK also phosphorylates/activates
  ATF-2 which forms dimers with c-Jun. The dimers bind to TRE elements along with
  co-factors (not shown) in order to activate transcription of the c-jun gene, thereby
  setting up an auto-regulatory mechanism of c-Jun/AP-1. On the other hand, GSK-3
  phosphorylates c-Jun at sites in the C-terminal domain, thus, reducing respective
  gene transcription. (B) c-Jun/AP-1 biological outputs: in different types of mammal
  cells, c-Jun/AP-1 binds to TRE elements, along with co-factors (co-activators or
  co-repressors), in order to activate transcription of genes that regulate proliferation,
  differentiation, apoptosis, survival, migration of normal and malignant cells, as
  well as immune checkpoint function for cells of the immune system (upper scheme).
  In T cells, c-Jun/AP-1 forms ternary complexes with NFAT and binds NFAT/AP-1 composite
  sites present in the regulatory regions of cytokines and effector genes (middle
  scheme). In CD8 T cells, Jun/BATF form ternary complexes with IRF4 and AICE composite
  sites present in the regulatory regions of genes controlling effector differentiation
  of Ag-activated CD8 T cells (lower scheme).'
