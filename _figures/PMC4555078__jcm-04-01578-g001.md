caption: 'Schematic representation of RTK signaling pathways and representative regulatory
  microRNAs. Several biochemical signaling pathways are simultaneously activated upon
  binding of a growth factor (GF) to a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Shown are two
  major cascades of protein kinases: the RAS-ERK pathway, which culminates in translocation
  of active ERK molecules to the nucleus, and the PI3K-to-AKT pathway, which requires
  phosphorylation of the inositol ring of phosphatitylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate at
  carbon position number 5. Both pathways regulate transcription factors, such as
  AP1, which comprises dimers of JUN and FOS. Note that many components of the signaling
  pathways are modulated at the mRNA level by microRNAs. Likewise, several microRNAs
  are induced or inhibited by RTK signals. They include a large group of microRNA
  molecules that undergo immediate down-regulation upon activation of EGFR (termed:
  ID-miRs) and several groups of microRNAs that are up-regulated immediately following
  RTK activation. For example, the group of IU-miRs is induced as early as 20 min
  after stimulation of EGFR.'
