caption: Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) attaches to
  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptors present on the vascular endothelium
  and damages it by direct infection, which leads to apoptosis and release of tissue
  factor (TF) and von Willebrand factor (vWF). This leads to activation of the complement
  pathway and activation of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, which lead to
  the release of interleukin-l (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10),
  and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). SARS-CoV-2 also directly activates platelets
  and megakaryocytes, which activates the extrinsic coagulation pathway, which leads
  to the formation of fibrin from fibrinogen. Fibrin degradation products (FDPs) are
  also released. Vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), intercellular cell adhesion
  molecule (ICAM-1), and E-selectin present in the endothelium play an important proinflammatory
  role. Therefore, a combination of endothelial damage and inflammation leads to a
  hypercoagulable state that leads to microvascular or macrovascular clots, which
  cause blockage of vessels and infarction or gangrene
