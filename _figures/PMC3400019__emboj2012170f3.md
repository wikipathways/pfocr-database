caption: Mitochondrial functions of PINK1 and parkin. (A) A linear pathway with PINK1
  acting upstream of parkin is implicated in mediating degradation of damaged mitochondria
  via mitophagy. (B) PINK1 and parkin also affect mitochondrial functions via parallel
  pathways, possibly by acting on mitochondria independently from each other.
