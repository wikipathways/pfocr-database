caption: Network analysis using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was
  conducted using selected genes that were differentially expressed and their close
  relationships. IPA results show two core networks consisted of Spp1-(red line) and
  Rgs4-associated interactions (blue line). Genes that were differentially expressed
  are indicated in pink, and predicted interacting genes (not contained in the microarray
  data) are indicated in white. Axon guidance signaling pathway-related genes are
  outlined in magenta. Molecular interactions between connected genes represent direct
  (solid line) or indirect (dotted line) functional relationships based on the IPA
  database. Green indicates negative fold changes, while red denotes positive fold
  changes, according to color intensity.
