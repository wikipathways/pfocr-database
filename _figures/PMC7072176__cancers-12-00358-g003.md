caption: Viral miRNAs affect the pathways involved in the carcinogenesis of host cells.
  The picture depicts changes to cellular fate because of viral miRNAs. Genomic instability
  due to viral infection can induce activation of the p53 pathway, which in turn supports
  both DNA damage responses and cell cycle arrest. In relation to viral infection
  context, viral miRNAs can affect abortive cell fates such as programmed cell death
  with consequent cancer transformation. Arrows signify that the factor or process
  promotes the effect it points to, while blocking arrows signify inhibition. Orange
  ellipses represent viral proteins, grey ellipses represent host cell proteins, green
  boxes represent stages of the lytic phase of viral life cycle and blue boxes represent
  cellular processes affected by viral miRNAs during the viral latent phase.
