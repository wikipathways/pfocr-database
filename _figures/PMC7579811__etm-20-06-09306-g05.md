caption: Pathway analysis of the proteins co-expressed with KRT80 in colorectal cancer.
  A total of 112 co-expressed proteins with absolute Spearman's r≥0.4 were loaded
  into the Reactome database for pathway analysis. The figure shows a genome-wide
  overview of the results of pathway analysis. Reactome pathways are arranged in a
  hierarchy. Each step away from the center represents the next level lower in the
  pathway hierarchy. The yellow color denotes that the proteins co-expressed with
  KRT80 were significantly enriched in that pathway (P<0.05), whereas light grey signifies
  pathways that were not significantly enriched. KRT80, Keratin 80.
