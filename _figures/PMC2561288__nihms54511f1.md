caption: PGE2 formation and its signal transduction pathways. Arachidonic acid (AA)
  is transformed into unstable intermediate PGG2, which is promptly converted into
  PGH2 by cyclooxygenases (COXs). PGE2 is generated from PGH2 by cytosolic PGE2 synthase
  (cPGES) and membrane-bound PGE2 synthase-1 and -2 (mPGEs-1 and -2). Cytosolic PGES
  is mainly involved in COX-1, mPGES-1, however, is preferentially coupled with COX-2,
  and mPGES-2 is linked with both COX-1 and COX-2. Once synthesized, PGE2 diffuses
  immediately and activates its specific membrane receptors (EP1–4), which belong
  to the family of seven transmembrane-segment G-protein-coupled receptors. EP1 receptors
  couple with the Gq-phospholipase C(PLC)-inositol trisphosphate (IP3) pathway and
  its activation results in the release of intracellular Ca2+. EP2 and EP4 receptors
  couple with the Gs-adenylyl cyclase (AC)-cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. EP3
  couples with a pertussis toxin–sensitive Gi protein to inhibit AC resulting in a
  decrease in cAMP.
