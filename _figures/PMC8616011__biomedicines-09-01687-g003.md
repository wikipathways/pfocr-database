caption: 'Intrinsic mechanisms of tumor resistance to immunotherapy: (A1) The tumor
  cells have the ability to not respond to immunotherapy by the development of different
  mechanisms that have been described in different studies. One of the mechanisms
  that can lead to the resistance are the alterations of some signaling pathways in
  tumor cells that can cause the reduction or loss of antigens expression, preventing
  immune cell infiltration or function. The WNT signaling is one of these pathways
  that can be aberrantly activated in a variety of tumors and act in the tumor cell
  genesis, proliferation, invasiveness, metastatic and immune microenvironment regulation.
  In some studies, it was demonstrated that the WNT signaling can control the expression
  of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 and can reduce the expression of chemokine that attracts CD103+
  DC (CCL4), decreasing the DC migration into the TME and contributing to the inhibition
  of activation and cytotoxic effects of T cells; The PI3K pathway is one of the responsible
  pathways that contributes to the development and growth of tumors and alterations
  in their intermediaries, like tumor suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin homolog
  (PTEN) loss can cause the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as C-C Motif
  Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2) and VEGF that reduce the infiltration of CTL cells in
  tumors, decrease IFN-γ and granzyme B expression; MAPK signaling is very involved
  in the tumors development, wherein alterations in this pathway can suppress the
  expression of MHC-I and MHC-II and the induction of the expression of VEGF and a
  variety of inhibitory cytokines, such as the interleukin (IL)-8 proteins that inhibit
  T cell function and recruitment. (A2) The mutational load that tumors present can
  influence the expression of neoantigens and the tumors with low levels of TMB are
  considered less immunogenic, since they present low expression of neoantigens and
  a low number of TILs in TME, decreasing the immune response against the tumor. In
  a study with melanoma patients the expression of a group of transcriptomic signatures,
  referred as innate anti-PD-1 resistance signature (IPRES), by the tumors can regulate
  different processes, like mesenchymal transformation, angiogenesis, extracellular
  matrix remodeling and others, leading the tumor to not respond to anti-PD-1 therapy.
  The IFN- γ pathway is essential for the immune response, since the IFN- γ secreted
  by the T cells and APC directed for tumor cells contributes to the immune cell activation
  and regulation of T cell responses, and can also directly induce tumor cell death.
  The downregulation or mutations in the molecules involved in the IFN-γ signaling
  pathway, like JAK1/2 mutations by tumor cells, cause the survival of the tumor cells
  by resisting the antiproliferative effects of IFN-γ can lead to the tumor’s resistance
  to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-γ to escape the influence of IFN-γ; Tumor
  cells can realize immune-suppressive cytokines, like the transforming growth factor
  (TGF)-β, that can stimulate Treg cells, promoting the angiogenesis and immunosuppression
  of immune response. The CD73 can form adenosine by the dephosphorylation of adenosine
  monophosphate (AMP) and the adenosine and CD73 can inhibit the proliferation and
  function of T cells; (A3) the B2M protein is essential to transport MHC class I
  to the cell surface and mutation in this protein, disrupt the antigen presentation
  and, consequently, the recognition of CTL fails, which can lead to acquired resistance
  to immunotherapy. The IDO enzyme liberated by the tumor can reduce the T cell proliferation,
  inhibiting the activity of T-cell against tumor cells by the degradation of tryptophan
  into the kynurenine, and kynurenine stimulates the proliferation of Treg cells.
  The lactate produced by the tumor cells due to metabolic reprogramming can cause
  the acidification of the TME, affecting the IFN-γ production, NK activation and
  the amount of MDSC, causing the decrease of the immune response and contributing
  to the tumor growth. Abbreviations are as follows: T cell Receptor (TCR), Major
  Histocompability Complex 1 (MHC-I), Major Histocompability Complex 2 (MHC-II), Beta-2-Microglobulin
  (B2M), Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ), Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Protein-4 (CTLA-4),
