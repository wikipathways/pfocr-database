caption: Schematic of model showing how attachment and/or invasion of epithelial cells
  by adherent-invasive E coli (strain LF82 depicted) can lead to fragmentation of
  the mitochondrial network via DRP1 activation, and possibly loss of OPA1-L, and
  mitochondrial disruption as defined by movement of cytochrome C from mitochondria
  to the cytosol. Infection with E coli–LF82 was not accompanied by evidence of caspase-3
  activation. The cell stress experienced results in reduced epithelial function and
  may have implications for cell activation (ie, alarmin release) and viability (red
  lines indicate pathway supported by data in the current study).
