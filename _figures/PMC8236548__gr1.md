caption: Homologous recombination pathway activated in response to double-strand DNA
  breaks. Homologous recombination repair (HRR) is activated in response to the generation
  of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). A set of genes recently associated with significantly
  increased risk of developing breast cancer (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2,
  RAD51C and RAD51D) is heavily implicated in modulating HRR and cell cycle progression.
  After DSB recognition by the MRE11-RAD50-NBS11 complex, activated ATM and ATR phosphorylate
  BRCA1 that in turn binds BRIP1, BARD1 and PALB2. The latter protein will then connect
  with BRCA2. The BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex recruits RAD51 and its paralogs RAD51C
  and RAD51D on the DSBs in order to finalize their repair.
