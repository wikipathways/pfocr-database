caption: The entry of glucose into the cell is mediated by the glucose transporter
  Glut1. Glucose is then metabolized to pyruvate, which enters the mitochondrial tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle and generates reducing equivalents for ATP production via oxidative
  phosphorylation (OxPhos). During aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate is fermented into
  lactate in the cytoplasm despite the availability of oxygen for complete glucose
  oxidation; this process is called the Warburg effect. Glutamine enters cells using
  alanine, serine, cysteine-preferring transporter 2 (ASCT2), and it is converted
  into glutamate by glutaminase (GLS) and into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) by glutamate
  dehydrogenase (GDH), which enters the TCA cycle for ATP production via OxPhos. Fatty
  acid molecules are catabolized into acetyl-CoA via fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and
  acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle for ATP production. Sirtuins are metabolic sensors
  that modulate a variety of metabolic pathways. Sirt1, Sirt3, and Sirt6 restrain
  the glycolytic pathway through hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) inhibition
  or direct effects. Sirt3 upregulates the OxPhos pathway by enhancing the activity
  of mitochondrial complexes I, II, and III and dampening reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production. Sirt1 is also able to increase FAO by activating PPAR-α and PGC1,
  while Sirt3 upregulates FAO under caloric restriction conditions. Sirt2 deacetylates
  and inhibits the activity of many metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis, glutaminolysis,
  the TCA cycle and FAO. Sirt3 and Sirt4 activate and inhibit glutaminolysis, respectively,
  by regulating GDH activity. Sirt6 impacts the glutaminolysis pathway by regulating
  c-Myc transcriptional activity. Sirt5 increases glycolysis by increasing the activity
  of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH. Sirt7 can also repress HIF-1α and, therefore, may
  inhibit the transcription of glycolytic genes.
