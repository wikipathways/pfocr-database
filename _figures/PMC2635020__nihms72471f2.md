caption: CD is synthesized in rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as preprocathepsin
  D. In ER/Golgi pathway, signal peptide sequence is cleaved off and procathepsin
  D (pCD) is glycosylated at asparagine residues. Subsequently, procathepsin D is
  targeted to intracellular vesicular structures (lysosomes, endosomes). Upon entering
  these acidic compartments, the cleavage of propeptide (AP) results in a single chain
  intermediate enzymatically active form. Further proteolytic processing yields the
  mature CD which is composed of linked heavy and light chains [–]. Enzymatically
  inactive pCD is secreted by cancer cells into extracellular space []. It was proposed
  that pCD can be converted in acidic extracellular milieu to enzymatically active
  pseudocathepsin D (form that retains residues 27–44 of the propeptide) by autocatalytic
  processing []. Pseudocathepsin D can be hypothetically processed by other proteases
  to single chain CD or further to mature two-chain CD. In tumors, active forms of
  CD can also be released from necrotic cells. The existence of particular active
  CD forms in extracellular space of solid tumors in vivo is therefore assumed but
  has never been directly evidenced.
