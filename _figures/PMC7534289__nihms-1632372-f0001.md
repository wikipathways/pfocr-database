caption: Initiation of a productive T-cell response involves integration of a primary
  signal delivered through the T-cell receptor (TCR) and major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC)–peptide, followed by a second signal delivered through the CD28–CD80
  or CD28–CD86 pathway (Panel A). After initiation of T-cell activation, other inhibitory
  checkpoint interactions can shut down T-cell activity (Panel B). Pathways that may
  be affected as a consequence of both positive and negative second signals are listed
  at the bottom of the figure. CTLA-4 denotes cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein
  4.
