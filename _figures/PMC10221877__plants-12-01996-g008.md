caption: 'Response of DA metabolic pathway to Cd stress in duckweed. Using normalization
  [log2 (FPKM+1)] and standardization (Z-score), cluster heatmaps were created to
  demonstrate the variations in unigene expression between the two groups. Colors
  ranging from red to blue denote high to low expression. The expression of the genes
  dictates the color of an arrow. Red and green denote increased and decreased regulation,
  respectively, while yellow denotes mixed regulation. The arrow’s value indicates
  the average change in DEGs’ expression. Abbreviations: PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  EMP, glycolysis; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate; DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosanate-7-phosphate;
  DHQ, 3-dehydroquinate; DHS, 3-dehydro shikimate; SKH, shikimate; S3P, shikimate
  3-phosphate; EPSP, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate; CHA, chorismite; PPA, phenylpyruvic
  acid; L-phe, L-phenylalanine; 4-HPPA, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid; L-tyr, L-tyrosine;
  DQ, dopaquinone; L-NA, L-noradrenaline; DAHPS, 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate
