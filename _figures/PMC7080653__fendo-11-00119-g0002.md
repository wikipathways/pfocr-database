caption: Innate immunity (especially the type 1 IFN signaling pathway) and cytokine-induced
  apoptosis together contribute to beta-cell death. (1) When PAMPs are bound by PRRs,
  including the cytosolic receptors RIG-1 and MDA5 and endosomal TLRs, the interactions
  can promote the synthesis and secretion of type 1 IFNs. IFN-α/β bind their receptor
  IFNAR and induce the production of cytokines and chemokines that can cause and worsen
  insulitis and apoptosis. (2) The signaling pathways underlying cytokine-induced
  apoptosis mainly include (i) JAK/STAT signaling induced by IFN-γ binding to its
  receptor IFNGR and (ii) NF-κB and MAPK signaling induced by IL-β/IL-R and TNF-α/TNFR.
