caption: Models on the dualism of G protein signaling in the pheromone response pathway
  in C. neoformans. Under nutrient limiting conditions, Gpa3 mainly serves to repress
  Gβγ signaling and prevent induction of pheromone response. On pheromone activation,
  the expression of Gpa2 is induced and in addition to functioning passively through
  releasing the Gβγ subunit, the active form of Gpa2 also plays a positive signaling
  role, contributing to the pheromone response that leads to mating, whereas the activated
  form of Gpa3 inhibits mating. The RGS proteins Crg1 (in the pheromone activated
  state) and Crg2 (in the basal and activated states) both function to constrain Gpa2
  and Gpa3 signaling by stimulating GTPase activity.
