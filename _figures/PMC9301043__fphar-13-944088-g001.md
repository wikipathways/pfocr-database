caption: 'Proposed mechanism of NASH and NASH-driven HCC. Insulin resistance causes
  a compensatory increase in insulin in the body, leading to hyperinsulinemia and
  a marked increase in IGF-1 levels. These conditions can promote hepatocyte proliferation
  and inhibit apoptosis. Therefore, they can exacerbate the development of HCC. Insulin
  resistance also directly triggers HCC by promoting hepatic neovascularization. When
  insulin resistance occurs, IRS binds to insulin or IGF and induces HCC through the
  PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways. Insulin resistance promotes lipolysis in adipose tissue,
  which leads to increased serum cholesterol and FFA levels. High levels of FFA in
  the serum travel to the liver, causing a significant increase in FFA in the liver.
  Insulin resistance can also directly promote DNL, which leads to an increase in
  hepatic FFA levels. Increased FFA levels in the liver promotes the synthesis of
  TG and triggers lipotoxicity. Lipotoxicity induces apoptosis, which activates liver
  macrophages and triggers inflammation through the NF-kB pathway, further inducing
  the development of HCC. Lipotoxicity also leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and
  ER stress, both of which further induce ROS production. This further promotes inflammation,
  apoptosis and fibrosis, thereby contributing to the development of NASH and NASH-HCC.
  ER stress can also directly promote inflammation and apoptosis. Dietary factors,
  obesity and the gut microbiota also contribute to elevated serum cholesterol and
  FFA levels, and diet and obesity alter the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota promotes
  inflammation and fibrosis through PAMPs, which further induce NASH and NASH-HCC.
  Changes in the gut microbiota can also directly trigger HCC through elevated levels
  of MTOR, proinflammatory factors and protumor factors. IGF: insulin-like growth
