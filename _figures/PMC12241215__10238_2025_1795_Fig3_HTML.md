caption: 'The diagram represents various therapeutic strategies targeting AML through
  different molecular mechanisms. The key treatments include monoclonal antibody–drug
  conjugates, Hedgehog pathway inhibitors, Tp53-targeted therapies, BCL-2 suppressors,
  and CAR-NK cell therapy. Monoclonal Antibody–Drug Conjugates: This approach involves
  antibodies conjugated with cytotoxic drugs targeting CD33-positive AML cells. The
  antibody binds to the CD33 antigen, delivering the drug (e.g., calicheamicin) directly
  to the cancer cell, causing cell death. Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitors: Drugs like
  Glasdegib target the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which plays a role in maintaining
  leukemia stem cells. Tp53 Targeted Therapies: AURK inhibitors (AURN-6924) are depicted
  in this strategy, which targets MDM2 to stabilize the tumor suppressor protein Tp53,
  leading to apoptosis in cancer cells. BCL-2 Suppressors: BCL-2 inhibitors (e.g.,
  Venetoclax) induce apoptosis by disrupting interactions between BCL-2 and pro-apoptotic
  proteins like BIM and BAX, leading to increased cell death in AML cells. CAR-NK
  Cell Therapy: Genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified NK
  cells target AML cells by recognizing tumor-associated antigens (TAA), triggering
  immune-mediated cytotoxicity. AML Acute Myeloid Leukemia, CD33 Cluster of Differentiation
