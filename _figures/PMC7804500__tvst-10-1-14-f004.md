caption: The PPI network of the 37 enriched genes from KEGG pathway analysis by Cytoscape.
  (a) “Degree” was set to represent the centrality of the PPI network. Purple nodes
  represent that their degree values were higher than or equal to the mean. The darker
  the color, the higher the value. (b) “Betweenness” was set to represent the centrality
  of the PPI network. Red nodes represent that their betweenness values were higher
  than or equal to the mean. The darker the color, the higher the value.
