caption: Posttranslational modulation of FoxO proteins is associated with intricate
  cellular signal transduction pathways. Posttranslational modulation of FoxO proteins
  involves pathways associated with phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitylation.
  Protein kinase B (Akt) can prevent cellular apoptosis through the phosphorylation
  of FoxO proteins and phosphorylation (p) of FoxO proteins will inhibit FoxO transcription
  factors through cytoplasmic localization by association with 14-3-3 proteins and
  prevent the transcription of target genes that lead to apoptosis. If activated,
  FoxOs can prevent inflammatory cell activation through the inhibition of nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) and may control inflammatory cell activation through membrane
  phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. FoxO proteins can lead to apoptotic death
  pathways that involve mitochondrial (Mito) release of cytochrome c (Cyto c) and
  caspase activation through a Fas-mediated ligand (Fas L) death pathway, tumor-necrosis-factor-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), BH3-only proteins Noxa and Bim, or p53. Cell
  cycle inhibition that blocks tumor growth through FoxO protein activation may require
  c-myc, p27, and NF-κB.
