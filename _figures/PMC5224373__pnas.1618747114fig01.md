caption: Regulation of CRISPR-Cas activity by QS. At low cell density, low autoinducer
  (pink dot) concentrations result in the repression of CRISPR-cas loci through the
  QS pathway, keeping the CRISPR-Cas immune response at a minimum. In contrast, at
  high densities of bacteria (when they are most susceptible to phage attack) the
  increase in the concentration of autoinducer triggers the de-repression of CRISPR-cas
  loci. Expression of the Cas protein complex and crRNA guide prepares the cell for
  the cleavage (arrowhead) of incoming viruses.
