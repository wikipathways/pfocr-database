caption: Ozone-induced energy (A) and lipid (B) metabolic pathway alterations. Top
  altered pathways suggested by the KEGG were plotted along with the significantly
  altered metabolites. Those metabolites that are altered at 1-hour are marked with
  blue arrows and those that are altered at 24 hours are marked with red arrows.
