caption: The reverse transcription pathway of HBV. (a) The pgRNA (thin line) is the
  template for the synthesis of minus-strand DNA. As the minus-strand DNA (thick grey
  line) is synthesized, the RNase H activity of the P protein degrades the pgRNA.
  (b) The final RNase H cleavage leaves the 5′ end of pgRNA, which will then serve
  as primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis. (c) Primer translocation. The RNA primer
  translocates to a complementary sequence at DR2, which is near the 5′ end of the
  minus-strand DNA template. (d) Plus-strand DNA synthesis (thick black line) begins
  and proceeds to the end of the template. (e) Circularization. The 3′ end of the
  nascent plus-strand DNA anneals to a complementary sequence, 3′ r, on the minus-strand
  template and plus- strand DNA synthesis resumes. RC DNA subsequently is made. (f)
  In situ priming. Less frequently, plus-strand DNA synthesis initiates at DR1. DL
  DNA is synthesized.
