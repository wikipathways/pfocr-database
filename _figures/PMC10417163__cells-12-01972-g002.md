caption: Signaling pathways play an essential role in organizing the Golgi apparatus
  and maintaining neuronal polarity during neurogenesis. First, lipid transfer proteins
  (PITPNA/PITPNB) augment GOLPH3 recruitment to the Golgi apparatus via PI4P signaling;
  which promotes its positioning towards MYO18A’s target compartment. Secondly, STK25
  and Mst4, two downstream effectors of LKB1, possess the capacity to co-immunoprecipitate
  with STRAD and bind to Golgi matrix protein GM130, acting as key organizers within
  its organelles. Reelin and Dab1 also regulate the expansion of Golgi bodies into
  pyramidal neurons’ apical processes. Finally, the BIG2-ARF1-RhoA-mDia1 signaling
  pathway plays an integral role in controlling dendritic Golgi deployment and growth
  in newly created hippocampal neurons in adults
