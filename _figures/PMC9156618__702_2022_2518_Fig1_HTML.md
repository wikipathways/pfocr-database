caption: 'Functional protein–protein association networks of (A) COVID-19 and (B)
  MS-related genes were analysed by STRING. Genes associated with the two disease
  entities (disease id: C000657245, version 5, N.PMIDs ≥ 7; MS, disease id: C0026769,
  Gene-Disease Association Score ≥ 0.3) were retrieved from DisGeNET, acknowledge
  platform for disease genomics. Only highly confident interactions derived from “Experiments”,
  “Databases”, “Co-expression” and “Co-occurrence” with the minimum required interaction
  score of 0.900 were shown. The Markov cluster (MLC) algorithm with an inflation
  parameter of 3 was used for network clustering'
