caption: Nucleic acid sensors and downstream signaling pathways induce type I IFN
  production. Cytoplasmic sensors for RNA (RIG‐1) and DNA (cGAS) signal through the
  adapters MAVS and STING, respectively, and activate the kinases TBK1 and IKKε, as
  well as downstream IRF3 (left). IRF3 translocates to the nucleus, cooperates with
  NF‐κB, and drives IFN‐β transcription in a variety of cell types including macrophages
  and epithelial cells. In pDCs producing large amounts of IFN‐α, nucleic acid‐containing
  immune complexes are endocytosed and delivered to the nuclear endosomes via the
  Fc receptor (FcR), which then activates TLR sensors in RNA (TLR7, TLR8) or DNA (TLR9)
  (right). These endosomal TLRs signal through the junction MyD88 and activate the
  IKK kinase complex, which in turn activates downstream transcription factors, including
  IRF7 and the NF‐κB subunits p50 and p65. IRF5 is activated by an unknown mechanism.
  These transcription factors translocate to the nucleus and drive IFN‐α transcription
