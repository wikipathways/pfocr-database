caption: Xmrk signaling in the zebrafish hepatocellular carcinoma model. In transgenic
  zebrafish models of HCC, Xmrk signals through kinases and transcription factors
  that modulate liver cancer progression. PI3K activation may modulate apoptosis through
  the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), although mTOR expression may be decreased
  in HCC, making its effect on apoptosis uncertain. STAT5 signaling can promote proliferation,
  as does MAPK via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). MAPK
  also has a dual role in signaling through the transcription factors, Snail and Slug,
  to inhibit E-cadherin activity. The formation of focal adhesions is increased through
  a pathway that is currently uncharacterized. Xmrk is also associated with increased
  expression of the tumor suppressor, p53, and the Fas receptor (FasR), which regulates
  apoptosis during HCC, but the details of their associated signaling mechanisms are
  not currently understood.
