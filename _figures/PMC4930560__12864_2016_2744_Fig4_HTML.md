caption: Pathway analysis for different organisms. Thick black or gray arrows – enzyme-dependent
  subpaths; thin black arrows – enzyme-independent conversions; dashed arrows – other
  metabolic paths. Ovals – intermediate products; rectangles – enzymes of interest;
  rounded rectangles – major metabolic paths. a Part of nicotinate and nicotinamide
  metabolism pathway (KEGG:ko00760). This subpath is present in Anaplasma, Ehrlichia,
  Francisella, and Coxiella spp. In Francisella and Coxiella – from L-asparate to
  nicotinate D-ribonucleotide. In Anaplasma and Ehrlichia – from glycerone-P to nicotinate
  D-ribonucleotide. The path is absent in Bartonella, Rickettsia, and Borrelia spp.
  b, c Two subpaths of arginine and proline metabolism pathways (KEGG:ko00330). Both
  are present in Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Francisella, and Coxiella spp. while absent
  in Rickettsia, Borrelia, and Bartonella spp., which can complete only the gray arrow
  path in B. d Part of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathway (KEGG:ko00250).
