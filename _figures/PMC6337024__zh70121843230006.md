caption: Schematic diagram of interrelationship among selected identified proteins
  and genes differentially expressed in MFM vs. control horse muscle at rest and after
  exercise. MFM horses have significantly higher activity of CPTB1 (3.5 log2 fold),
  which transports fat into mitochondria and lower expression of 2/24 subunits of
  mitochondrial Complex 1, which is a site of free radical generation. The 4.14 log2
  fold lower content of cysteine-dependent peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) in MFM vs. control
  muscle at rest and lower expression of enzymes required to synthesize cysteine following
  exercise indicated that the oxidoreductase pathway plays a central role in the pathogenesis
  of MFM. We hypothesize that protein misfolding, myofibrillar disarray, and aggregation
  of desmin in MFM horses arise from protein oxidation due to excessive generation
  of reactive oxygen species (H2O2), decreased postexercise cysteine synthesis, and
  depletion of cysteine-dependent antioxidants such as PRDX6.
