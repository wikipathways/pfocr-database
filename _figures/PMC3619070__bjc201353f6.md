caption: A signalling model for the induction of non-targeted responses in the out
  of field lung tissues after lower abdomen irradiation. Lower abdomen irradiation
  induces TGF-β ligands and receptors in non-targeted lung tissues but not released
  forms in the blood. TGF-β in stromal regions binds to its corresponding receptors
  on bronchial epithelial cells and activates a range of signalling pathways involving
  ERK, JNK, AKT, NFκB and Smad2, which lead to the upregulation of COX-2 in non-targeted
  lung tissues. COX-2 further induces prostaglandin production, oxidative DNA damage
  and mutagenesis in the non-targeted lung tissues.
