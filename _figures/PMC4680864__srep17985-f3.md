caption: (Left) Hexokinase (HK) and Phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) enzymes become activated
  in response to the sharply increased glycolytic flux, which resulted in increased
  flux into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for nucleotide synthesis. mTOR and
  PI3K signaling pathways controlled glycolysis-regulating enzymes that included HK
  and LDH. (Right) Glycolytic flux and lactate production drop rapidly and flux into
  the PPP decreased. Increased ROS due to decreased in expression level of antioxidant
  enzyme (Sod1) promoted cell proliferation in the serum condition.
