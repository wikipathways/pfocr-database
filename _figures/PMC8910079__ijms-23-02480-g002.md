caption: Schematic representation depicting the proximal metabolic interactions between
  adipocytes and breast cancer cells. Fatty acids are the unit molecules of fat, present
  in excess in the blood plasma of obese individuals. As free FAs can be toxic at
  higher concentrations, they are stored in the cytosolic lipid droplets of white
  adipocytes in the form of triglycerides following the triglyceride synthesis pathway.
  Due to excess energy demands and metabolic requirements, breast cancer cells can
  mobilize these stored fats from surrounding adipocytes and use them to compensate
  for their energy needs. Breast cancer cells use the fat in the form of fatty acids
  that are derived from the triglycerides stored in white adipocytes. Free fatty acids
  released from white adipocytes are then taken up by breast cancer cells through
  the transmembrane channel protein CD36A present on its cell surface. Apart from
  that, breast cancer cells are also able to generate fatty acids from blood-derived
  glucose following de novo lipogenesis pathways. Breast cancer cells then use the
  unit molecule of fatty acids to fulfill their ever-expanding metabolic needs, to
  synthesize new macromolecules and membrane lipids.
