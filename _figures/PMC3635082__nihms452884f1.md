caption: A, schematic flow diagram of functional genomic approach to identify chromosome
  3p12 pathway genes. Three expression platforms are denoted that were screened to
  identify candidates for validation in plasma as potential pancreatic cancer biomarkers.
  B, putative gene network derived from IPA software. Edges are displayed with labels
  that describe the nature of the relationship between the nodes. The lines between
  genes represent known interactions, with solid lines representing direct interactions
  and dashed lines representing indirect or hypothetical interactions. Color highlighting
  (red, upregulation; green, downregulation) indicates pathway-associated genes discovered
  by this study and nonhighlighted genes are those identified by IPA.
