caption: Metabolic pathway diagram of hypoxanthine. The blue arrow represents the
  introduction of heterologous genes, the yellow arrow represents the weakening gene,
  the green arrow represents the overexpressed gene, and the red arrow represents
  the deletion of related genes. purF, glnA, and pur (FDNTSQLMKECB) were from Bacillus
  subtilis, and isn1 were from Saccharomyces cerevisiae
