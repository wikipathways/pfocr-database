caption: The role of EVs in macrophage polarization within the ovarian tumor microenvironment.
  Tumor-derived EVs from ovarian cancer cells and associated stromal cells (like cancer-associated
  adipocytes) carry various bioactive molecules, including miRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNAs,
  which influence macrophage behavior. EV-encapsulated components drive macrophages
  toward an M2 immunosuppressive phenotype, promoting immune evasion, tumor progression,
  chemoresistance, and metastasis. Key pathways involved include the CD24/Siglec-10
  axis and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, activated by transferred miRNAs and regulatory
  proteins, enhancing tumor-supportive functions of macrophages and contributing to
  a microenvironment conducive to cancer survival and invasion
