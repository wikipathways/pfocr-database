caption: Drug metabolism. A chemical compound that is administered orally is subjected
  to several metabolic pathways that can be subdivided into three phases. The liver
  is the main organ implicated in drug metabolism. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT)
  also takes part in the first two phases of drug metabolism. Phase I is characterized
  by oxidation reactions, which are mainly catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes.
  Phase I transforms lipophilic drugs into soluble metabolites. Here, activation and
  inactivation of the drug can occur. In addition, toxic by-products can also be generated
  through this process. Phase II is known as the detoxification pathway. This phase
  implicates the conjugation of phase I–derived metabolites via UDP-glucuronosyltransferases
  (UGTs), resulting in formation of highly soluble metabolites. These hydrophilic
  metabolites can then be eliminated from the body during phase III.
