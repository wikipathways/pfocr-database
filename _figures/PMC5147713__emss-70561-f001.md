caption: 'tRNA-isopentenyltransferases (tRNA-IPTs) catalyze the prenylation of adenine
  (A) 37 on specific (UNN-)tRNAs leading to the formation of isopentenyl adenine (IP)-containing
  tRNA. In A. thaliana, the isopentenyl group is derived from the mevalonate (MVA)
  pathway in the cytosol; but predicted localization of enzymes in other plants suggest
  the use of isoprene moieties derived from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway
  (broken arrow). The MEP pathway also contributes to IP and trans-zeatin (tZ) biosynthesis.
  Once isoprenylated tRNA is synthesized, it can be further modified and the CKs can
  be released by unknown enzymes (“?” in a black box; e.g. tRNA degrading enzymes).
  Hydroxylation of the prenyl side chain is suggested to occur on the IP-containing
  tRNA (i6A37-tRNA), leading to the formation of cZ-containing tRNA (c-io6A37-tRNA).
  Inactivation and catabolism of cZ is mediated by cZ-O-glucosyltransferases (cZOGT),
  cZ-N-glucosyltransferases (cZNGT), and cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX). Glucosylated
  forms of cZ-type CKs: cZOG (cZ-O-glucoside), cZROG (cZ-riboside-O-glucoside) and
  cZ7G/cZ9G (cZ-N9/N7-glucosides). Multiple arrows indicate multiple biochemical steps;
  dotted-lines show unexplored metabolic flow. DMAPP (dimethylallyl-diphosphate),
  IPR (IP-riboside), cZR (cZ-riboside), A (adenine).'
