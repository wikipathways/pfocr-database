caption: Schematic illustration of the PTEN regulated PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathways
  in CNS axon regeneration. AKT is positively regulated by the PI3K/PDK1 pathway through
  phosphorylation of T308, and negatively regulated by the PI3K/mTORC2 pathway through
  phosphorylation of S473, through at least partially regulation of GSK3β phosphorylation
  and inhibition. Both AKT downstream effectors, activation of mTORC1 and phosphorylation/inhibition
  of GSK3β, synergistically promote axon regeneration; inhibition of GSK3β alone is
  also sufficient for axon regeneration, at least partially through eIF2B    . The
  activation of mTORC1 and its substrates 4E-BP and S6K is necessary but not sufficient
  for potent axon regeneration. The question mark represents unknown effectors downstream
  of PTEN that are AKT-independent and sufficient to initiate CNS axon regeneration,
  and which potentially interact with the translational targets of mTORC1 to promote
  potent axon regeneration. Green color-coated molecules are pro-axon regeneration
  and dark color-coated molecules are anti-axon regeneration.
