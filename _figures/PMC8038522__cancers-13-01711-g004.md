caption: Integrin internalization, sorting, and recycling. Integrin internalization
  occurs either clathrin-mediated or caveolar involving the dynamin GTPase to form
  vesicles. Rab GTPase family members and Arf GTPases are intimately involved in integrin
  trafficking, implicating ACAP1 in rapid integrin recycling from Arf6-positive endosomes.
  Integrin endocytosis to early endosomes is triggered by Rab5 and Rab21. Integrin
  recycling proceeds either through a short/rapid-loop by fusion to early endosomes
  implicating Rab4 signaling, or a long/slow-loop pathway, involving Rab11 signaling,
  delivering integrins back to the plasma membrane and into filopodia. This facilitates
  cell adhesion and enhances cell migration. Early endosomes mature to late endosomes/multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) via the invagination of the endosomal membrane resulting in intraluminal
  vesicles (ILVs), which may be prone to degradation in lysosomes. Other receptors
  are recognized by specific coat proteins and sorted either to the plasma membrane,
  the trans-Golgi network, or in some cases to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus
  evading degradation. Constitutive exocytosis of ILVs carrying integrins occurs upon
  their fusion with the cell membrane. Formed exosomes carrying integrins are taken
  up by recipient cells where they enrich the cell surface integrin density and thereby
  increase cell migration. Thus, the proportion between integrins depends on the balance
  between either their recycling or degradation exerting tremendous consequences for
  integrin signaling and the biological events arising thereof.
