caption: Schematic representation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway and its downstream regulators in the granulosa
  cells (GC) and oocyte. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ½ (ERK1/2)
  activates mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) in pre-GC to initiate the activation of primordial
  follicles. mTORC1 activates cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB),
  which promotes stem cell factor (SCF) transcription and stimulates PI3K signaling
  but also affects pre-GC proliferation and oocyte apoptosis. mTOR signaling negative
  regulators TSC1 and TSC2 suppress mTORC1 activity. PI3K signaling pathway is activated
  by SCF in the oocyte. PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2)
  to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which interacts with 3-phosphoinositide
  dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) for subsequent phosphorylation of protein kinase
  B (Akt) and forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) with its downstream mediator, cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor 1B (p27). Upon phosphorylation, the inhibitory effect of FOXO3
  and p27 on cell cycle progression and oocyte growth is inhibited, and the primordial
  follicle is recruited. Akt also activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1)
  through inhibition of TSC2 with subsequent mTORC1 activation and further ribosomal
  protein S6 (rpS6) phosphorylation, which leads to protein translation and ribosome
  synthesis. Factors indicated in red are associated with follicle dormancy; molecules
  indicated in green are associated with follicle activation. Created with BioRender.com,
