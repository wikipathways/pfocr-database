caption: Working model of FMDV 3A regulation of the G3BP1-mediated RLH signaling pathway.
  Following FMDV infection, 3A, LRRC25, G3BP1, and RIG-I/MDA5 formed a complex. 3A
  inhibited the expression of G3BP1 by upregulating the expression of LRRC25, which
  resulted in a reduction in the expression of RIG-I and MDA5. Ultimately, this reduced
  the production of IFN-β.
