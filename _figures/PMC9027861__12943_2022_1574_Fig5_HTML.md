caption: 'A schematic diagram of the proposed mode of action of a TEDbody in cancer
  immunotherapy. A TEDbody delivers a fused MHC-I-restricted viral CTL epitope peptide
  into the cytosol of integrin αvβ5-expressing cancer cells to be processed for surface
  presentation by cognate MHC-I, thereby rendering the marked cancer cells recognizable
  and killable by pre-existing antiviral CTLs arising from common human viral infections
  in cancer patients as follows: 1) binding to the tumor-associated receptor, integrin
  αvβ5, for cellular internalization; 2) cytosolic localization through endosomal
  escape; 3) proteasomal cleavage and degradation generating CTL epitope precursor
  peptides; 4) ER uptake by TAP and N-terminal trimming of the precursor peptides
  to generate the mature CTL epitope, followed by its binding to cognate MHC-I; 5)
  cell surface presentation of the pMHCI through the ER-to-Golgi pathway; 6) recognition
  and lysis of pMHCI-presenting cells by pre-existing pMHCI-specific antiviral CTLs'
