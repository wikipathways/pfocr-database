caption: Models that have been proposed to explain the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation
  by metformin. (A) metformin prevents tumor cell proliferation in a cell non-autonomous
  fashion through blocking the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling
  axis. (B) Metformin-induced blockage of tumor cell proliferation is cell autonomous
  and is mechanistically associated with the inhibition of complex I of the oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS). (C) The substrate limitation model. According to this
  model, metformin acts in an AMPK-independent manner to block the usage of glucose
  and glutamine by oxidative reactions (Krebs cycle) in mitochondria (mt) of tumor
  cells. Besides, it promotes a shift towards reductive rather than oxidative α-ketoglutaric
  acid (α-KG) metabolism. The reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-KG that
  takes place either in cytosol (mediated by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, IDH1) or
  in mitochondria (mediated by IDH2) is being boosted by metformin. Although the presence
  of metformin favors the production of citrate the reductive carboxylation of α-ΚG,
  the hindrance of OXPHOS in mitochondria induced by the drug results in a decrease
  of total citrate derived from either mitochondrial or cytosolic reactions. The drop
  of lipogenic citrate leads in the prevention of tumor cell proliferation which requires
  de novo lipogenesis. The red “X” symbol denotes inhibition of a signaling pathway
  while upward and downward pointing arrows denote up- and downregulation, respectively.
