caption: GPR and HDAC co-regulation network related to epithelium metabolism. The
  functions of the first neighbors were predicted by the KEGG pathway analysis. The
  genes colored in red were the genes that were significantly upregulated after 4 weeks
  of 30% NFC feeding, and the genes colored in blue were the significantly downregulated
  genes after 4 weeks of 30% NFC feeding. The lines in the same color indicate the
  genes regulating the same metabolic function. The lines in the same shape indicate
  that the low-level metabolism was grouped in the same high-level metabolism by KEGG
