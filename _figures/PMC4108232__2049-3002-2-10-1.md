caption: Mitochondrial dysfunctions in cancer. Schematic representation of mitochondrial
  enzymes involved in cancer, focusing on enzymes of the TCA cycle (A) and of the
  respiratory chain and ATP synthase (B). The type of cancer associated with each
  individual enzyme is listed in boxes. The color of the text indicates if the enzyme
  has been found upregulated (red), downregulated (blue), or mutated (black) in the
  given tumor type. CS citrate synthase, Aco aconitase, IDH isocitrate dehydrogenase,
  IDH* mutant IDH, OGDH oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, SDH succinate dehydrogenase, FH
  fumarate hydratase, ME malic enzyme, MDH malate dehydrogenase, PDH pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  OG 2-oxoglutarate, 2HG 2-hydroxyglutarate, HLRCC hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal
  cell cancer, PGL/PCC hereditary paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma, CI–CV complex
  I–V, Cyt c cytochrome c, UQ ubiquinone, UQH2 ubiquinol, ROS reactive oxygen species,
  ATPIF ATP synthase inhibitory factor. Dashed lines indicate a series of reaction
  in a complex pathway, whereas solid lines indicate a single step reaction.
