caption: Cytokines that upregulate the MHC class I expression and assembly pathway,
  such as IFNs and/or TNF-α, may trigger an UPR in antigen-presenting cells of HLA-B27-expressing
  individuals when a critical threshold of misfolding is reached. ERAP1 polymorphisms
  could influence the efficiency of HLA-B27 folding, its propensity to misfold, and/or
  its peptide repertoire, through its effect on peptide trimming in the ER. The UPR
  will polarize cells responding to PRR agonists toward the production of greater
  amounts of IL-23 over IL-12, which in turn provides a stimulus for Th17 survival
  and activation in individuals with permissive IL23R polymorphisms. Th17 cells are
  shown producing IFN-γ, which has been documented in several situations, but would
  also be expected to come from Th1 cells. IL-1 locus polymorphisms (possibly IL1A)
  could play a role in Th17 development as well as in other inflammatory processes.
  This schema is meant as a framework to provide testable hypotheses regarding the
  role of various polymorphic susceptibility genes in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis.
  Additional susceptibility genes that fit within this schema are being identified
  (unpublished data). This figure is reproduced in a modified form from “Molecular
  Mechanisms of Spondyloarthropathies”, edited by Carlos López-Larrea and Roberto
