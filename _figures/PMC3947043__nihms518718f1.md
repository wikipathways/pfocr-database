caption: Colorectal carcinogenesis progresses by at least two well-recognized pathways.
  The chromosome instability (CIN) pathway is characterized by classic tubular adenoma
  histology and the early acquisition of APC mutations that lead to deregulated WNT
  signaling, frequent activating mutations of the KRAS oncogene at the early adenoma
  stage, loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 18q (18qLOH) in late adenomas, and TP53
  mutations that facilitate the transition to frank malignancy. By contrast, tumors
  that harbor microsatellite instability (MSI) frequently acquire BRAF mutations and
  are not associated with 18qLOH or TP53 mutations. Sporadic MSI cancers appear to
  commonly arise via the serrated neoplasia pathway, in which sessile serrated adenomas
  are the most frequently observed pre-cancerous lesions. (Modified from Pritchard
