caption: 'A model for the role tRNAfMet abundance in translation initiation from CATam1
  mRNA. As per the established pathway, the 30S pre-initiation complexes form from
  30S subunits, mRNA, initiator tRNA and the initiation factors (Step 1). Subsequently,
  the 50S subunit docks on to the 30S pre-initiation complex to form 70S complex (Step
  2) which can then enter the elongation step (Step 3) to translate an mRNA. (A) A
  high occupancy of the P-site of the 30S subunit by the wild-type tRNAfMet is facilitated
  by its structural features (which include the 3GC base pairs in the anticodon stem)
  and the initiation factors. Lack of the correct pairing between the anticodon (CAU)
  of the P-site bound tRNA and the initiation codon, UAG of the reporter CATam1 mRNA
  (in the vicinity of S.D. sequence, not shown) disallows formation of a productive
  30S pre-initiation complex, and the subsequent steps of initiation leading to a
  CmS phenotype. (B) Under the conditions of low abundance of tRNAfMet, a low occupancy
  of the ribosomal P-site by tRNAfMet allows for a finite probability of the P-site
  occupancy by tRNAs lacking the 3GC base pairs (e.g. the 3GC or the supE tRNAs),
  and initiation by them leading to the synthesis of CAT and a CmR phenotype (see
  ‘Discussion’ section for further details). Symbols for the various factors are as
  indicated. Letters E, P and A in gray refer to the E-, P- and A-site on the 30S
  and 50S subunits. The L-shaped molecules are tRNAs (blue: tRNAfMet; light green:
  3GC or supE tRNAs), and the red crosses in (A) indicate failure of the 50S subunit
  docking and transition of the complexes into the elongation phase.'
