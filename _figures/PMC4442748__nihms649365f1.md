caption: A broad array of stimuli can induce an M1 pro-inflammatory response. TLR3
  binds double stranded DNA (dsDNA). TLR7 binds single stranded RNA (ssRNA). TLR9
  binds unmethylated CpG islands in stretches of DNA. Broadly, TLR3, 7, and 9 defend
  against viral infection. TLR2 binds lipoteichoich acid (LTA) and some other microbial
  products. TLR4, along with co-receptors MD2 and CD14 (not shown), binds lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS). TLRs signal through MyD88 and/or TRIF to activate the IRAK family of kinases.
  IRAKs then cause the translocation of several transcription factors to the nucleus,
  namely NFkβ, AP1, STAT5, and IRFs. Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) binds and activates a
  heterodimer of the IFNγ Receptor 1 and 2 (IFNγR1/2). Activation then leads to JAK1/2
  activation which leads to STAT5 translocation to the nucleus. Granulocyte modifying-
  colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) binds a dodecamer of subunits that forms the
  GM-CSF Receptor (GMCSF-R), which in turn activates JAK2, RAS and SFK. In addition
  to causing STAT5 translocation to the nucleus, GM-CSF alters the RAS pathway to
  increase protein translation, proliferation, and differentiation in innate immune
  cells. NFkβ, AP1, STAT1/5, and IRFs translocation to the nucleus leads to up-regulation
  of iNOS as well as the cell surface markers MHCII, CD86, and CD16/32. The production
  and release of cytokines TNF, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-12 and chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10
  are also up-regulated.
