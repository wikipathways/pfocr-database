  activity is regulated at different levels. Its substrate Trp and cofactor heme are
  positive regulators of the enzyme, whereas antioxidants and NO act as inhibitors.
  Phosphorylation at tyrosine side chains and ubiquitination modulate IDO activity
  and half life. At the level of transcription several cis regulatory elements of
  the IDO promoter collect regulatory signals via binding of transcription factors
  and epigenetic regulators, which respond to signals arriving from receptors that
  are activated by cytokines and other immunomodulatory molecules. Extracellular signals
  produced by other cells or pathogens and intracellular signals, such as cytosolic
