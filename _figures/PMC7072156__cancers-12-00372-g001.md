caption: Bacteria-associated mechanisms involved in the development and progression
  of CRC. (a) Enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) secretes B. fragilis toxin (BFT)
  to interact with the E-cadherin and β-catenin of host cells at adherent junctions,
  activate the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway, and drive the transcription of genes
  related to apoptosis, cell proliferation, or transformation. Meanwhile, BFT can
  activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway to enhance
  uncontrolled proliferation of epithelial cells. Furthermore, ETBF stimulates IL-17
  and IL-23 production, and induces mucosal immune response in the colonic epithelium
  to promote the proliferation and metabolism of colonic epithelial cells through
  the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) / signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) pathway. Besides, ETBF also induces spermine oxidase (SPO) to generate
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby inducing DNA damage; (b) Recognition of microbe-associated
  molecular patterns (MAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Porphyromonas spp.
  can activate macrophages via binding its Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to activate
  the STAT3 or NF-κB pathway to transmit signals to the nucleus for regulating cellular
  growth, apoptosis, angiogenesis, migration, and cellular invasion; (c) Fusobacterium
  adhesin A (FadA) of F. nucleatum can bind E-cadherin of intestinal epithelial cells
  to activate β-catenin, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and acquisition of a
  stem cell-like phenotype. Furthermore, F. nucleatum is shown to modulate autophagy
  of intestinal epithelial cells by activating regulatory microRNAs. F. nucleatum
  also contributes to proinflammatory effects via recognition of MAMPs by TLRs, leading
  to the activation of the NF-κB or STAT3 pathway and accelerating CRC development;
  (d) C. jejuni can promote colorectal carcinogenesis through the production of cyto-lethal
  distending toxin (CDT), which then induces the DNA double-strand breaks, resulting
  in mutagenesis and chromosomal instability; these processes are also involved in
  cancer initiation and development; (e) D. desulfuricans can reduce sulphur or sulphur-containing
  compounds to hydrogen sulphide (H2S), which can promote oxidation and DNA damage
  to promote cancer development when hydrogen sulphide is present in high concentrations;
  (f) E. coli strains harboring the pks island for encoding polyketide synthases can
  produce genotoxin colibactin to induce DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in cancer
  initiation and development. E. coli can also promote vascular endothelial cell migration
  and increase vascular permeability by increasing the production of vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF). All of these effects are necessary for tumor vascularization,
  proliferation, and migration; (g) S. gallolyticus can promote the production of
  inflammatory factors such as IL-1, IL-8, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), thereby accelerating
  CRC development through chronic inflammation; (h) C. septicum can produce α-toxin
  to induce apoptosis in neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment, thereby downregulating
  tumor immune response and accelerating CRC development.
