caption: 'Latency reversing agents (LRAs) that induce HIV expression in latently infected
  cells include histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), bromodomain and extra-terminal
  (BET) inhibitors, methylation inhibitors and protein kinase C (PKC) agonists. HDACi
  promote histone acetylation and chromatin remodelling at the HIV promoter to support
  access for transcription initiation. Methylation inhibitors prevent deleterious
  hypermethylation of CpG islands near the HIV promoter to foster HIV transcription
  initiation. PKC agonists (eg. prostratin, bryostatin) promote the accumulation of
  active cellular NF-κB transcription factor in the cell nucleus to promote HIV transcription
  initiation. Bromodomain inhibitors (eg. JQ1) prevent PTEF-b binding to bromodomain
  proteins, releasing free PTEF-b to interact with HIV Tat protein for efficient HIV
  transcription elongation. Apoptosis-inducing compounds act on various pathways leading
  to caspase activation and apoptosis and could also be administered with LRAs to
  sensitise cells for apoptosis. For instance, acitretin triggers retinoic acid-inducible
  gene I (RIG-I) that in turn detects viral RNA for subsequent interferon-induced
  apoptosis. SMAC mimetics block inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, preventing
  IAPs from inhibiting apoptosis and sensitizing cells towards apoptosis. Similarly,
  inhibitors of BCL-2 (eg. Venetoclax) block this BCL-2 inhibitor of apoptosis, sensitising
  cells towards apoptosis. Inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt pro-survival pathway both culminate
  in preventing Akt activation (which inhibits apoptosis), thereby also sensitising
  cells towards apoptosis. Immune-based therapies such as immune checkpoint (IC) inhibitors
  and toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists may enhance immune-mediated killing of HIV-expressing
  cells. IC inhibitors (e.g. anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA-4) also block negative signalling
  to T cells and may potentially also reverse latency. TLR 7/9 agonists bind to receptors
  on endolysosomes in antigen-presenting cells and other immune cells, activate dendritic
  cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells and induce release of interferon-α.SMAC:
  second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase, PI3Ki: phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  inhibitor, Akti: Akt inhibitor, BCL-2i: B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor, BETi: bromodomain
  and extra-terminal protein inhibitor, P-TEFb: positive transcription elongation
  factor b, LTR: HIV long terminal repeat promoter, Ac: acetylation, Me: methylation.'
