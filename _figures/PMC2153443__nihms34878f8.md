caption: 'A. Diagram showing the potential sites of modulation of the TGF-β signaling
  pathway by IL-1β or TNF-α in articular chondrocytes. Modulation may occur through
  mechanisms other than NF-κB/Smad7 activation including: 1 and 2. Enhancement of
  ubiquitination and/or proteosome-mediated degradation of Smad proteins and type
  I TGF-β receptors. Smad proteins can be targeted for ubiquitination at different
  points in the TGF-β signaling pathway; in the cytoplasm by Smurf E3 ligases, or
  in the nucleus by SCF class of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. Type I TGF-β receptors
  can be ubiquitinated by Smurf E3 ligases interacting with I-Smads. Further degradation
  by the 26S proteosome follows the ubiquitination process (–,,). 3. Interfering the
  interactions between Smad-activated TGF-β target genes and other transcription factors,
  co-activators and co-repressors. Transcription factors that interact with Smads
  include the JNK-dependent activated AP-1 (c-Jun) (,), as well as, co-repressors
  such as cSki/SnoN, c-Myc, Evi1, ATF3, TGIF, SNIP1, SIP1 and Tob (,). 4. Inhibitory
  effect upon Smad 3 phosphorylation. B. Postulated mechanisms responsible for inhibition
  of Smad pshosphorylation. TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) can directly inhibit Smad3
  phosphorylation or can activate the JNK pathway leading to the formation of a cJun-Smad3
  complex not compatible with Smad3-DNA interaction (,).'
