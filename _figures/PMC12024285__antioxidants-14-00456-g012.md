caption: Mechanism of 1-DNJ alleviating OS in porcine GCs. (A) When OS occurs in porcine
  GCs, the ERS pathway is activated, leading to ER damage and the triggering of ERS.
  Meanwhile, mitochondrial function is impaired and the level of mitochondrial OS
  is increased. During this process, OS affects the communication between the mitochondria
  and ER through MAMs, resulting in an increase in the content of Ca2+ in the mitochondria
  and changes in the activities of apoptosis-related proteins Bax, Bcl2, and Caspase3.
  Ultimately, this leads to an increase in apoptosis of porcine GCs. (B) When OS occurs
  in GCs, the addition of 1-DNJ can inhibit the activity of the PERK-ATF4 signaling
  pathway, relieve ERS, restore ER and mitochondrial functions, prevent ER calcium
  inflow from the ER into the mitochondria by regulating the expression of MAMs-related
  proteins and MCU, reduce mitochondrial OS levels, and restore MMP and ATP synthesis.
  Moreover, MFN2 is a potential target gene downstream of ATF4. Ultimately, 1-DNJ
  promotes the expression of the anti-apoptosis-related protein Bcl2, inhibits the
  expression of pro-apoptosis proteins BAX and Caspase3, and finally, alleviates the
  apoptosis of porcine GCs caused by OS. This figure was drawn by Figdraw
