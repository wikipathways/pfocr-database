caption: 'Putative schematic diagram of the role of NRF2 in NTM infection.Mycobacterium
  avium (M. avium) infection induces ROS and activates NRF2, which induces HO-1 and
  NRAMP1 and promotes granuloma formation and P-L fusion. NRAMP1 is also induced by
  IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling pathway during mycobacterial infection []. ROS not only kills
  M. avium directly, but also induces apoptosis of infected cells. On the other hand,
  M. avium has a way to counteract ROS. NRF2 is activated by NAC and SFN. It has also
  been reported that aging suppresses the function of NRF2. Abbreviations: ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; NRF2, nuclear erythroid 2 p45-related factor; NRAMP1, natural resistance-associated
  macrophage protein 1; P-L fusion, phagolysosome fusion; HO-1, heme oxygenase 1;
  SFN, sulforaphane; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase
  1; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TLR, Toll-like receptor;
  MCP-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1; CCR2, chemokine receptor 2, IFN-γ, interferon-gamma;
  STAT1, signal transducers and activators of transcription.'
