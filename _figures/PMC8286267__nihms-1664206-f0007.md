caption: (A) The HBV replication cycle, from virus entry to secretion, is shown schematically.
  Following virus entry into hepatocytes and cccDNA formation in the nucleus, pgRNA
  and subgenomic viral mRNAs are transcribed from the cccDNA. During translation of
  the 3.5 kb precore mRNA, the N-terminal signal peptide of the precursor protein
  p25 is cleaved by the ER-associated signal peptidase during translocation to the
  ER lumen, resulting in the production of p22 in the lumen, which then traffics through
  the secretory pathway, where the CTD of p22 is cleaved off by preprotein convertases
  such as furin, to generate HBeAg secreted into the blood. Other than HBeAg, the
  PreC protein, retaining the signal peptide but having the CTD cleaved, is also secreted
  into the blood. Due to rapid processing of the precore precursor p25 to the intracellular
  p22 or the secreted PreC proteins, p25 may not actually exist or be detectable in
  the cell. On the other hand, pgRNA is the template for translation of HBc and viral
  polymerase. pgRNA binds to viral polymerase and both are packaged into the assembling
  capsid formed by HBc, a process known to be blocked by IFNα. A delayed silencing
  effect on HBV gene expression by IFNα was also observed in some cases (dashed line).
  pgRNA is subsequently reverse transcribed into rcDNA and the resulting mature nucleocapsid
  is enveloped by the viral envelop proteins (L-HBs, M-HBs, and S-HBs) to form virions
  for secretion. The reverse transcription step is targeted by NUC treatment. Empty
  virions, which composes HBs and HBc, are secreted to the blood at ca. 100-fold excess
  over DNA virions. The current HBcrAg assay detects HBeAg, PreC protein, and HBc
  from complete and empty virions. (B) Summary of potential clearance mechanisms that
  likely contributed to peripheral viral marker clearance, as characterized in the
  current study. *, HBsAg may continue to be expressed from the integrated HBV DNA.
