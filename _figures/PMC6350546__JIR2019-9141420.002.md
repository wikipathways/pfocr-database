caption: Targets and the simplified downstream effects of their autoantibodies encountered
  during dermatomyositis. (a) MDA5 recognizes the long double-strand RNA leading through
  the RIG1-MDA5 pathway to the cleavage of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein
  (MAVS), the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and the production of type I interferon.
  (b) Transfer RNA (tRNA) (Jo-1, PL-7, PL-12, EJ, OJ, KS, Zo, and Ha) helps the ribosome-recruiting
  aminoacyl to the site of translation. (c) Small ubiquitin-like modifier-activating
  enzymes (SAEs) are members of an enzyme complex leading to the SUMOylation of targeted
  proteins leading to either their translocation to the nucleus or the inhibition
  of transcription. (d) Mi-2 is a component of the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase
  complex (NuRD) which actively deacetylates histones leading to the compaction of
  chromatin and subsequently to the inhibition of transcription. (e) The nuclear matrix
  protein 2, which localizes in the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, binds
  to mRNA in the nucleus and can subsequently lead to RNA metabolism inhibition. Transcription
  intermediary factor family antigens have been deliberately omitted in this figure
  due to their broad mechanism of action.
