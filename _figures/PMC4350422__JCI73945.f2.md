caption: Autophagy affects self-renewal of HSCs, plasma cell survival, IgG secretion,
  survival of a special type of B cell, B1, and maintenance of memory B cells (not
  shown). Autophagy affects T cell survival following TCR activation and controls
  stability of immunologic synapses; it also controls innate immune cell (e.g., macrophage)
  signaling by suppressing ROS via the removal of depolarized mitochondria and inhibition
  of IL-1 release that influences, along with the durability of immunologic synapses,
  polarization of T cells into a Th17 phenotype. Autophagy also affects selection
  of naive T cell repertoire in the thymus by self antigen processing and presentation
  and survival and functionality of maturing T cells by trimming mitochondria and
  ER, thus ensuring Ca2+ homeostasis. Red crescents symbolize the entire autophagy
  pathway.
