caption: 'Upregulation of AMH production in testicular Sertoli cells. Left: onset
  of AMH expression in early fetal life is independent of gonadotropins and depends
  on transcription factors SOX9, which triggers AMH expression, and SF1, GATA4, and
  WT1, which further increase AMH transcription by binding to specific response elements
  on the proximal AMH promoter. Right: increase of testicular AMH production in response
  to FSH, involving the FSH receptor-Gsα protein-adenylate cyclase (AC)-cyclic AMP
  (cAMP) pathway, which activates protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated induction of SOX9,
  SF1, NFκB, and AP2. These factors bind to their specific response elements on the
  AMH promoter. Reproduced with permission from ref. (). Copyright© 2011 the American
