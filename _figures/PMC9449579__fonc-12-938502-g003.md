caption: Pathways regulated by SQLE. SQLE can activate multiple oncogenic pathways,
  such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and the ERK pathway, via cholesterol/cholesteryl
  ester accumulation. Knockdown of SQLE can also reduce calcitriol, the active metabolite
  of VitD3, leading to a reduction in cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member
  1 (CYP24A1) levels, which suppresses the phosphorylation and activation of ERK.
  The exhaustion of NADPH during the conversion of squalene to 2,3-epoxysqualene by
  SQLE can induce oxidative stress and subsequently activate DNA methyltransferase
  3A (DNMT3A), leading to the epigenetic silencing of PTEN. Loss of PTEN activates
  AKT/mTOR pathways, contributing to SOAT-mediated cholesteryl ester accumulation
  and NAFLD-induced HCC. However, there is also a report that depletion of SQLE can
  dissociate GSK3β and p53 and upregulate Mdm2, promoting the degradation of p53 and
  activation of β-catenin in colorectal cancer.
