caption: Dual Aspects of Altered Bone Remodeling in Psoriatic Arthritis. In the presence
  of certain differentiation signals, mesenchymal stem cells are induced to become
  osteoblasts, bone forming cells. Osteoblasts are then stimulated by via pathways
  including BMP, PGE2 and Wnt signaling. This leads to activation of the master transcription
  factor RUNX-2 and subsequent new bone formation. The natural antagonist of BMP is
  Noggin and of the Wnt pathway is DKK1 and Sclerostin; antibodies to these molecules
  are currently in development to promote bone formation. In bone resorption, osteoclasts
  derived from precursors receive signaling from inflammatory molecules such as TNF,
  IL-1, and IL-6. This activates the master regulator RANKL and subsequent bone erosion.
  A natural inhibitor of osteoclast formation is osteoprotegrin (OPG). Several therapeutic
  agents (dark red) are used to block steps in these pathways. Additionally, new molecules
  and pathways such as Btk, Plexin-B1/Sema4D, and TFG-Beta1 are being studied as their
  specific roles in bone remodeling have yet to be clarified.
