caption: 'Models of replication-coupled ICL repair. In replicating cells, ICLs are
  efficiently repaired by cooperative action of FA pathway proteins and the proteins
  involved in the NER, TLS, and HR pathways. Other than the classical ICL repair model
  of single fork convergence, there are different proposed mechanisms by which crosslinks
  can be repaired in a replication-dependent manner, enabling forks stalled at ICLs
  to resume DNA synthesis. (A) Dual fork convergence model. Crosslink repair is triggered
  when two replication forks converge at an ICL. The leading strands of two converging
  forks initially stall at ~20 nucleotides away from the lesion due to the steric
  hindrance imposed by the CMG complex (Cdc45/MCM2-7/GINS). Ubiquitin signaling promotes
  chromatin unloading of the CMG complex, which allows one of the leading strands
  on either side of the ICL to approach to within one nucleotide of the lesion. The
  FA pathway is simultaneously activated through the monoubiquitination of the FANCI‒FANCD2
  complex. Ubiquitylated FANCI‒FANCD2 in turn promotes recruitment of SLX4 (FANCP),
  which acts as a molecular scaffold to recruit structure-specific endonucleases SLX1,
  XPF (FANCQ)-ERCC1, and MUS81 at the ICL site. Nucleolytic incision and subsequent
  unhooking of the ICL by the coordinated actions of these enzymes creates a DSB in
  one sister chromatid. FAN1, another endonuclease, is also implicated in the incision
  step. TLS polymerases, Pol ζ and REV1 subsequently extend the leading strand past
  the unhooked ICL and generate an intact DNA template suitable for HR repair. The
  DSB is finally repaired by HR and the unhooked ICL is removed by NER process. (B)
  Replication traverse model. In living cells, the majority (~60%) of replication
  forks encountering ICLs bypass the lesions without unhooking them in a manner dependent
  on the translocase activity of FANCM/MHF complex. The “X-shaped” DNA structures
  generated through the traverse process are subsequently processed by endonucleases
  followed by lesion bypass and post-replication repair as in dual fork convergence
  model. (C) Replication fork reversal at ICL. Following CMG complex unloading, one
  of the two converging forks undergoes reversal. The opposite fork is subsequently
  incised by the endonucleases leading to ICL unhooking. The lesion is then bypassed
  by the action of TLS polymerases and DSB intermediate generated during the incision
  process is finally repaired by HR. ICL: Interstrand cross-link; FA: Fanconi anemia;
  NER: Nucleotide excision repair; TLS: Translesion; HR: Homologous recombination.'
