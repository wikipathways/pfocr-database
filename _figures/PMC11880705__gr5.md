caption: Oncolytic influenza viruses directly lyse tumor cells as well as activate
  the innate and adaptive immune systems in patients to kill tumor cells(A) NS1-modified
  influenza produces a large amount of ssRNA and dsRNA during replication in infected
  tumor cells, which activates the RIG-I, TLR3, and TLR7 signaling pathways, and promotes
  the nuclear translocation of transcription factors such as NF-κB, IRF3, IRF7, and
  so on. Genes encoding various cytokines and chemokines, including interferon, are
  transcribed and expressed. (B) Oncolytic influenza virus replicates in tumor cells,
  directly lyses tumor cells, and releases progeny virus. In this process, a large
  number of cytokines and chemokines are produced, which attract and recruit natural
  killer cells, mast cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, T effector
  memory cells, tumor-associated macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, B
  cells, and T cells to participate in the killing of tumor cells
