caption: Important genes involved in sia synthesis, activation, conjugation and breakdown
  are depicted in the boxes. Sialic acid synthesis starts in the cytosole and then
  sia is activated in the nucleus. Activated sia is transported to Golgi for conjugation
  and modification. These sialylated conjugates are cleaved by neuraminidases found
  in the lysosomes, cytosole and the cell membrane. The genes expressed in Holstein/Jersey
  milk are underlined. Among the expressed genes only ST8SIA1 (marked with an asterisk)
  had a higher expression in the transition milk. All other genes had higher expression
  in late lactation.
