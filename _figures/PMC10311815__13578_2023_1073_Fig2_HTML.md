caption: Graphical summary that explains underlying mechanism of acquired resistance
  to ICIs in terms of tumor cell-intrinsic and tumor cell-extrinsic factors. Tumor
  intrinsic mechanisms of acquired resistance involve loss of immunogenic antigens,
  defects in antigen processing and presentation, and mutations of IFN‐γ/JAK signaling
  pathway. Tumor extrinsic mechanisms of acquired resistance mainly include activation
  of alternate inhibitory immune checkpoints, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment,
  epigenetic modification, and dysbiosis of the gut microbiome
