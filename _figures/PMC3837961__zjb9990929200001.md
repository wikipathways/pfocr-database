caption: The Syp pathway and conserved syp enhancer sequences. (A) The syp locus contains
  18 genes (gray arrows) involved in the regulation, production, and transport of
  a polysaccharide necessary for biofilm formation and host colonization. The syp
  locus contains four operons with σ54-dependent promoters (bent arrows) located upstream
  of sypA, sypI, sypM, and sypP. The syp locus is transcriptionally controlled by
  the sensor kinase RscS (dark gray rectangle with white letters on the top of the
  diagram) and the response regulator (RR) SypG (gray rectangle, black letters). The
  RR SypE (gray hexagon) inhibits biofilm formation by inhibiting the activity of
  SypA (black oval), which functions downstream of syp transcription and is required
  for biofilm formation. Upon activation, RscS inactivates SypE's inhibitory activity,
  and SypA is able to promote biofilm formation. The gene directly upstream of the
  syp locus, VF_A1019 (white block arrow), also has an SE sequence associated with
  it (not shown). (B) The nucleotide sequence of each syp enhancer is shown, with
  the inverted repeat underlined and in bold. Note that sypI contains two tandem SE
  sequences (SE-I-up and SE-I-down).
