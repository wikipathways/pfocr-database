caption: 'a.Catechin biosynthetic pathways in Camellia sinensis.F3′H and F3′5′H are
  two key enzymes controlling the hydroxylation of naringenin and dihydrokaempferol
  at either the 3′ position or at both the 3′ and 5′ positions in the B ring. Abbreviations
  of enzymes are as follows: CHS, chalcone synthase (EC 2.3.1.74); CHI, chalcone isomerase
  (EC 5.5.1.6); F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.9); F3′,5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase
  (EC 1.14.13.88); F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.21); FLS, flavonol synthase
  (EC 1.14.11.23); DFR, dihydroflavanol 4-reductase (EC 1.1.1.219); ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase (EC 1.14.11.19); ANR, anthocyanidin reductase (EC 1.3.1.77); LAR, leucocyanidin
  reductase (EC 1.17.1.3); FGS, flavan-3-ol gallate synthase (EC number not assigned).
