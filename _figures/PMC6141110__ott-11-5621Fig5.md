caption: 'Schematic showing the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of low-frequency
  ultrasound in PTX-resistant PC-3 cells.Notes: Ultrasound induces apoptosis and enhances
  chemotherapy sensitivity through ER-mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in
  PTX-resistant PC-3 cells. Ultrasound-induced autophagy acts as a cytoprotector during
  low-frequency ultrasound-mediated reversal of drug resistance. Ultrasound induces
  autophagy by ER-mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in PTX-resistant PC-3 cells.
  However, inhibition of autophagy can promote PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.Abbreviation:
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum.'
