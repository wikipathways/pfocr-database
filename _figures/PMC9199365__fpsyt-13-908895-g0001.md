caption: Schematic diagram of NO function in the brain. NO can relax vascular smooth
  muscle, thereby regulating cerebral blood flow. Arg is catalyzed by different NOS
  to generate NO under physiological and pathological conditions. NO activates soluble
  guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP which interacts with many intracellular proteins
  such as PKG. PKG leads to CREB phosphorylation which leads into transcriptional
  activation of different genes. NO, directly and indirectly, leads to S-nitrosylation
  (SNO) of many proteins and receptors. SNO of proteins can alter the receptor activity,
  protein-protein interaction and protein localization leading to alteration in signaling.
  Increased level of NO increases proxynitrite formation, tyrosine nitration of proteins,
  which ultimately may lead into cell death.
