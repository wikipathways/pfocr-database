caption: 'The one carbon cycle and the transsulphuration pathway. The one carbon cycle
  (upper part) provides activated methyl groups for transmethylation reactions: methionine
  is the carbon unit donor, being activated by adenosylation to SAMe. Release of the
  carbon unit to any acceptor generates S-adenosyl-homocysteine and then Hcy. Hcy
  is subsequently remethylated (recycled) to methionine. Alternatively, Hcy may enter
  the transsulphuration pathway (lower part) by forming a complex with serine by the
  highly regulated cystathionine β-synthase (4), leading to the synthesis of GSH.'
