caption: Schematic of the nuclear signaling pathway of RIP-mediated EpCAM. Initially,
  it is still unclear how the EpCAM dimer dissociates into monomers, which undergoes
  two-step enzymatic cleavage by RIP, resulting in a functional intracellular EpICD
  fragment. This fragment subsequently complexes with FHL2 and β-catenin and enters
  the nucleus to form a nuclear signaling complex with transcription factor LEF1.
  Finally, the nuclear signaling complex binds to the promoter of target genes to
  initiate transcription
