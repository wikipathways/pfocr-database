caption: Role of Argonaute (AGO) proteins in plant immunity. A, MicroRNA (miRNA)/miRNA*
  pair contributes to plant antibacterial immunity through two distinct AGO proteins,
  miR393 and miR393b*, which are induced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato infection,
  specifically associate with AGO1 and AGO2, respectively. The miR393/AGO1 complex
  contributes to pathogen-associated molecular-pattern-triggered immunity by targeting
  TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1 (TIR1) and related proteins, thereby suppressing auxin
  signaling; the miR393*-AGO2 complex targets a Golgi-localized SNARE gene, MEMB12,
  resulting in increased exocytosis of antimicrobial proteins which directly confer
  resistance against bacteria. PR1, pathogenesis-related protein 1. B, Hierarchical
  and synergistic contribution of AGO proteins to plant antiviral immunity. AGO1 acts
  as a major antiviral RNA slicer in antiviral defense against Cucumber mosaic virus
  (CMV) and Turnip crinkle virus (TCV), while AGO2 functions as a surrogate of AGO1.
  AGO5 is known to bind to CMV-derived virus-derived siRNAs (viRNAs), although its
  function in antiviral defense is not clear. AGO7 has a different mode of action
  from AGO1 in antiviral defense against TCV. AGO2 mediates viRNA-directed defenses
  against Potato virus X (PVX) in Arabidopsis. Some DNA viruses are targeted by AGO4
  for the methylation of viral DNAs. AGO1-associated 21- and 22-nucleotide viRNAs
  are also considered to be involved in antiviral defense against DNA viruses. Thickness
  of the lines indicates relative hierarchical contribution of each AGO protein to
  antiviral immunity.
