caption: Crosstalk among signaling pathways involved in axonal migration and posterior
  pituitary development. Four of the genes found affected in our study cohort, CDK5,
  HESX1, ROBO1, and RIPPLY2, have a known involvement in signaling pathways regulating
  the embryonal development of the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary gland.
  Under physiological conditions, DLL1/JAG1 ligands activate the NOTCH receptor NOTCH2,
  resulting in cleavage of its intracellular domain (NOTCH intracellular domain, NICD).
  NICD is then translocated to the nucleus, where it associates with the Rbpj/Mastermind
  (MAM) complex and induces transcription of the HES and HEY genes. Loss of the effector
  gene HES1 results in hypopituitarism and a hypoplastic posterior lobe. NICD also
  induces transcription of the MESP2 gene via its interaction with RBJP and TBX6.
  In turn, MESP2 induces the transcription of RIPPLY2, which is a negative regulator
  of TBX6, and therefore, of the NOTCH pathway. In addition, the ROBO1 and ROBO2 receptors
  are implicated in the regulation of proliferation and transition of primary to intermediate
  neuronal progenitors through a poorly characterized crosstalk with the NOTCH pathway.
  Binding of these receptors by their ligands leads to CDK5 phosphorylation, which
  phosphorylates presenilin, thereby inducing NICD cleavage. This ligand-receptor
  interaction also results in activation of the WNT pathway, via β-catenin, resulting
  in the increased transcription of genes implicated in pituitary development, such
  as HESX1. The lower part of figure indicates potential anatomical and functional
  implications on midline structures, such as hypothalamus, infundibulum, and pituitary,
  with consequent loss of axonal guidance, ectopic posterior pituitary, and anterior
  pituitary hypoplasia.
