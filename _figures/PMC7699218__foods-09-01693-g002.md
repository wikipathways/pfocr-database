caption: Scheme of the amino acid and the urea and polyamine pathways. The metabolic
  pathway was adopted from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG database.
  Changes in the levels of MG metabolites produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 245
  during fermentation were detected by capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass
  spectrometry (CE-TOF-MS). Each bar represents the relative metabolite abundance.
  Red, yellow, green, blue, and purple squares indicate MG (a grain mixture before
  steaming), FMG-0hr (a mixture of grain steamed for 30 min at 100 °C), FMG-8hr (a
  mixture of grain fermented for 8 h), FMG-12hr (a mixture of grain fermented for
  12 h), and FMG-36hr (a mixture of grain fermented for 36 h), respectively.
