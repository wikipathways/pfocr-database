caption: Major mechanisms underlying induction of the host immune response by VPM1002
  and M. tuberculosis (Mtb) (for further details see text). (A) VPM1002. VPM1002 (rBCGΔureC::Hly)
  expresses listeriolysin and lacks urease C activity. Following phagocytosis, VPM1002
  ends up in a phagosome. Principally phagosomes become acidic after uptake of particles,
  but BCG and Mtb actively keep the phagosomal pH neutral. Due to the absence of ureaseC
  in VPM1002, acidification takes place. This facilitates perturbation of the phagosomal
  membrane by biologically active listeriolysin. (1) Membrane perturbation allows
  egress of antigens into the cytosol for processing through the MHC class I pathway.
  (2) Perturbation can lead to apoptosis. (3) Double-strand DNA released into the
  cytosol is sensed by absence in melanoma 2 (AIM2). (4) AIM2 activates the inflammasome
  to generate IL-1β and IL-18. (5) Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is formed which
  is then transformed into cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate
  (cGAMP). (6) The latter molecule is sensed by stimulator of IFN genes (STING) which
  induces autophagy and type I IFN responses. (7) Antigen egress into the cytosol
  allows stimulation of CD8 T cells in addition to CD4 T cells. (8) Apoptosis promotes
  crosspriming. (9) Autophagy accelerates elimination of VPM1002 and improves antigen
  presentation and T cell stimulation. (10) IL-1β and IL-18 induce an inflammatory
  response. Through these mechanisms, VPM1002 induces an immune response with more
  depth and breadth than parental BCG (B) Mtb. The genome of Mtb comprises the region
  of difference 1 (RD-1) which encodes numerous virulence factors which are absent
  in BCG. Notably genes for Esx dependent mechanisms cause perturbation of phagosomal
  membranes, very similar to VPM1002. For further details see (A). Because the RD-1
  encoded gene products are not degraded after their egress into the cytosol, pathologic
  consequences prevail. Moreover, RD-1 encoded gene products are not controlled by
  pH. Hence, inbuilt safety mechanisms of VPM1002 are absent from Mtb (see also ).
