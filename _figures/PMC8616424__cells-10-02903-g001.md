caption: Aβ induces the release of mitochondrial DAMPs in cerebral endothelial cells
  (ECs) inducing vascular activation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is induced by Aβ,
  at least in part, through the binding and activation of TRAIL Death Receptors (DRs)
  and activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Amyloid β has been
  shown to induce loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm), increase in the generation
  of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), and permeabilization of mitochondrial
  membranes leading to the release of cytochrome C and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into
  the cytoplasm of endothelial cells. The increase of mtROS leads to the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome, activation of caspase-1 and NFκB, resulting in the release
  of IL-1β and IL-18. Permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and
  outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) lead to the release of mtDNA to the cytoplasm.
  The presence of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, toll-like
  receptor 9 (TLR9) on the endolysosomal compartment, and the cGAS/STING pathway on
  the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, which lead to the activation
  of NFκB and upregulation of more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Amyloid β can also
  activate the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the CD36 membrane receptor, or increase
  the production of ROS through the RAGE receptor. The exponential increase in pro-inflammatory
  cytokines leads to blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, through activation of matrix
  metalloproteinases (MMPs), downregulation of tight junction (TJ) proteins, EC activation,
  and expression of cell adhesion molecules. Figure created with BioRender.com.
