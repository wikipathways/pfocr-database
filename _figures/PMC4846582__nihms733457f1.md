caption: Syncytin-1 regulation of syncytium homeostasis. The left panel illustrates
  that under physiological conditions, or early stage of preeclampsia, low levels
  of hypoxia and ROS will activate syncytin-1 expression through cAMP and GCMa-mediated
  pathway. A sufficient level of syncytin-1 leads to upregulation of CDK4, E2F1, and
  C-Myc, which ensures G1/S transition, promoting cytotrophoblast proliferation. At
  the same time, syncytin-1 mediates cell fusion and the formation of syncytiotrophoblast
  and keeps the trophoblast apoptosis at low levels. These actions work together to
  achieve the syncytium homeostasis, which supports the normal pregnancy. The right
  panel depicts the pathological situation. High levels of ROS, severe hypoxia, genetic
  predisposition, or a combination of these factors, may overwhelm the feedback mechanism
  for upregulation of syncytin-1. At a late stage of preeclampsia, the detrimental
  factors may affect DNMT expression, leading to hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing
  of syncytin-1 promoter. An insufficient level of syncytin-1 leads to blocking of
  G1/S transition, inhibition of trophoblast proliferation, and a reduced cytotrophoblast
  pool. The low level of syncytin-1 and reduced cell fusion will affect the repair
  of syncytium. Furthermore, a low level of syncytin-1 causes apoptosis of syncytiotrophoblasts,
  increases the syncytial deportation, and ultimately, the syncytium deficiency, which
  contributes to the development of preeclampsia. On the other hand, some preeclamptic
  conditions may further aggravate the syncytium deficiency, leading to the deterioration
  of the disease
