caption: 'During ANS development, transcription factors act in a network to induce
  other transcription factors. BMP is an inductive cue for the SNS lineage and activates
  the expression of the transcription factors Phox2b (; ), Mash1 (; ) and Hand2 ().
  The bHLH factor Mash1, is able to cross-activate the paired homeodomain transcription
  factor Phox2b (; ) which is required for maintenance of Mash1 expression () and
  for expression of another bHLH factor Hand2 (). Hand2 activates Phox2b (), itself
  and Mash1 (this study). These three factors together activate the expression of
  the neuronal structural genes. Each factor activates different pathways that converge
  during autonomic neuronal development.Generic neuronal pathway: Expression of Mash1
  is sufficient for the expression of generic neuronal structural genes such as TuJ1
  and NF160 (). Mash1 is required for the expression of the noradrenergic biosynthetic
  genes TH, DBH () and peripherin () but transcription regulation of these genes must
  be indirect since Mash1 expression stops at mid-gestation (). Neuronal type selection:
  Phox2b regulates expression of the zinc finger factor GATA3 () and Phox2a (). Phox2a/b
  and Gata3 directly regulate the expression of noradrenergic biosynthetic enzymes
  TH and DBH in sympathetic neurons (; ; ) and may regulate other neuronal genes in
  parasympathetic and enteric neurons. Peripheral pathway: Hand2 is only expressed
  in the ANS lineages of the nervous system suggesting a role in its specification
  (; ). Ectopic expression of Hand2 activates the PNS program and regulates the expression
  of TH in the SNS. The ability of Hand2 to activate Mash1 is p300/CBP dependent.'
