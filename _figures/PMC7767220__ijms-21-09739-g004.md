caption: Roles of MMPs and TIMPs in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory diseases.
  Abnormal regulation and expression of MMPs and TIMPs within specific tissues is
  related to the development of inflammatory-related diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,
  osteoarthritis, psoriasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. At the cellular
  level, the transcription of MMPs and TIMPs is regulated by growth factors, cytokines,
  and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions that can induce the activation
  of signaling pathways, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT),
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB), jun proto-oncogene–fos proto-oncogene/activator protein
  1 (Jun-Fos/AP-1), mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR), and the janus kinase–signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Their abnormal activation
  may generate tissue breakdown. Some elements of this figure were taken from the
  Mind the Graph platform, available at www.mindthegraph.com. ↑ Means overexpressed.
