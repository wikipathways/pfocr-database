caption: SMAD signaling and regulation in adipogenesis. Black arrows represent the
  proposed pathway of BMP/TGF-β signaling that leads to adipogenesis. BMPs and the
  type I receptor kinases, including ALK2, and ALK3 () activate SMAD1/5/8 signaling
  (orange rectangles labeled S158) by C-terminal phosphorylation (red circled P).
  Activated SMAD1/5/8 form a trimeric complex with SMAD4 (grey rectangles labeled
  S4), which translocates to the nucleus to directly or indirectly regulate expression
  of adipogenic genes, including Pparg, Plin1, Cidec, Fabp4 and Adipoq. SMAD2/3 signaling
  (light blue rectangles labeled S23) is inactive in adipogenesis. Blue arrows represent
  the proposed pathway of BMP/TGF-β signaling in adipogenesis arrest. Differentiating
  3T3-L1 cells treated with anti-adipogenic traps and ligands show both SMAD2/3 activation
  and SMAD1/5/8 inhibition. SMAD2/3 activating kinases or SMAD2/3 regulated genes
  could negatively regulate SMAD1/5/8 signaling by inducing its hyperphosphorylation
  (blue circled P), which may lead to reduced SMAD1/5/8 nuclear translocation and
  transcriptional activity.
