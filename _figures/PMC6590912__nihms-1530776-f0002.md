caption: Proposed mechanism by which TBI alters hypothalamic-pituitary growth hormone
  (GH) Axis. TBI-induced chronic growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is characterized
  by metabolic abnormalities associated with decreased IGF-1 synthesis. The presence
  of low plasma GH decreases the hepatic IGF-1 synthesis via dysregulation of the
  GH receptor, JAK2 and STAT5 pathways. Early hepatic inflammation after TBI also
  activates the hepatic toll like receptors (TLR-4) that leads to nuclear translocation
  of the transcription factor NF-κB, TNF-αreceptor upregulation and TNF-α increase.
  This systemic inflammation could induce insulin resistance by stimulating cytokines
  receptors and JNK pathway that leads to serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS1,
  TNF-α and mitochondrial ROS production. It is recognized that the growth hormone
  GH/IGF system is involved in metabolism manifestations. In turn, TBI-induced GH/IGF-1
  deficiency may be associated with visceral obesity that leads to systemic inflammation
  and ROS production. Low plasma IGF-1 induces β-cell exhaustion and consequently
  peripheral insulin resistance by dysregulation of the IGF-1 receptor, PDE and PKA
  pathway.
