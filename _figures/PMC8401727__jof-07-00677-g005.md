caption: 'Proposed defense response in P. patens infected with C. gloeosporioides.
  (A) Salicylic acid synthesis mechanism and signaling pathway during the salicylic
  acid-dependent defense response; also, the downregulated genes from photosynthesis
  and chloroplast functions. (B) Defense strategies of P. patens during infection.
  Pink ovals indicate enzymes and proteins involved in the defense response. Red,
  blue and black letters indicate upregulated, downregulated and non-differentially
  expressed genes, respectively. Green arrows indicate activation, the red trunked
  line indicates inhibition, the double-headed orange arrows indicate possible interaction,
  the dotted arrows represent movement from an intracellular space to another and
  the consecutive black arrows indicate various intermediate reactions. C: conidium;
  GT: germination tube; A: appressorium; PH: primary hyphae; CW: cell wall; PM plasmatic
  membrane; HR: hypersensitive response; ROS: reactive oxygen species; ICS: Isochorismate
  synthase; MAPKKK1: Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1; NPK1: Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase NPK1; eff: fungal effectors. For other abbreviations,
