caption: Activation of complement system by the amyloid plaques and its dual role
  in neuronal death. C1q binds to the boxed sequence in aggregated amyloid peptides
  and activates classical pathway of complement system. This leads to cleavage of
  C3 to C3b which could bind to a different sequence from the amyloid peptide (boxed).
  C3b initiates generation of C5-convertase cleaving C5 into C5a and C5b. C5a interacts
  with the C5a receptor (C5aR) on the surface of neurons and activates the neuroprotective
  mitogen activated protein kinases. On the other hand, C5b initiates the terminal
  pathway of complement cascade which forms MAC which integrates into membrane of
  the weakly protected neurons resulting in their death.
