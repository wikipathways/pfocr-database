caption: 'The plant’s reaction to biotic stress involves a few steps: after the initial
  signal input from the pathogen which is recognized by the related receptors (putative
  R genes), transcription of the cascade of the plant defense mechanism is triggered,
  including oxidative stress changes. Inside the cell, signals are transmitted to
  lead to the production of defense molecules (PR-proteins, heat shock proteins, and
  secondary metabolites). Genes with an experimental indication of involvement in
  the biotic stress are gathered on the main panel (colored with blue), while genes
  and pathways that are putatively involved in the biotic stress pathway are shown
  on the left and right sides (adapted from).'
