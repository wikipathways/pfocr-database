caption: Integrated functional association analysis of protein and genetic interactions
  on alanine and aspartate. Pathways, co-expression, co-localization, and protein
  domain similarity were analyzed by the bioinformatics resource GenMANIA (genemania.org)
  for the 5 candidate genes [alanine also known as glutamate pyruvate transaminase
  (GPT) and GPT2], aspartate [also known as glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT)1
  and GOT2, (Table )], isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 (IDH1), IDH2 and HNF4 (gray circles)
  and the predicted related genes by systems biology (open circles). List of gene
  symbol and gene function is shown in Table . Predicted functional pathways and Q
  values are shown in Table .
