caption: Overview of the proposed mechanisms for differential modulation of gut function
  by enteral glutamine and arginine in the hypoperfused gut. Following gut ischemia/reperfusion
  (Gut IR), the proinflammatory transcription factor, AP-1, is increased, as is the
  downstream, proinflammatory enzyme iNOS. Both are associated with gut inflammation,
  mucosal injury, and dysfunction. When the enteral nutrient, arginine, is added to
  the hypoperfused gut, iNOS expression and AP-1 DNA-binding activity are increased
  further. Arginine is a known precursor to iNOS, but the mechanism by which arginine
  increases AP-1 is unknown. There is a recently described, NO-mediated PKG pathway
  that may explain the increase in AP-1 by arginine. PPARγ is believed to inhibit
  the proinflammatory pathway at the level of AP-1, protecting the hypoperfused gut.
  Glutamine increases PPARγ DNA-binding activity and may be a novel PPARγ agonist.
  When PPARγ is activated, it heterodimerizes with the retinoic acid receptor (RXR)
  and then binds to the peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE), resulting
  in target gene expression.
