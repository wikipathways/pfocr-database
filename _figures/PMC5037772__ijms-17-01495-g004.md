caption: 'Pin1 has biphasic effects on insulin signaling. Pin1 associates with IRS-1
  and enhances insulin signaling through upregulation of tyrosine phosphorylation
  in animals fed normal diets or under lean conditions. Additionally, Pin1 binds to
  JNK and S6K, thereby triggering insulin resistance, and both are activated by HFD
  feeding. Pin1 also increases the kinase activities of JNK and S6K. Positive effects
  exerted by Pin1 on IRS-1 can be nullified by both JNK and S6K under HFD feeding
  conditions, despite Pin1 expressions being increased. (P): phosphorylation of substrates;
  (+): Pin1 enhances phosphorylation, activity and protein stability; (T): Both JNK
  and S6K downregulates tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. (↑) Glucose is effectively
  incorporated into the tissues; (↓) Glucose uptake is impaired.'
