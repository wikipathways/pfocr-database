caption: Schematic representation of a new signaling mechanism that connects Panx1/P2X7R
  signaling with lipid metabolism and lipid-mediated ROCK signaling and regulation
  of myoblast blebbing/migration/fusion which is important for efficient muscle regeneration.
  Panx1-regulated P2X7 receptors can signal through PLD and A2 (PLA2); the resulting
  lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) then causes dynamic membrane blebbing via a pathway
  dependent on Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). Interaction between Panx1 and P2X7 receptors
  leads to further activation of the pannexin channel through a positive feedback
  loop that has been reported previously (; ). Perturbation of any component of these
  signaling pathways results in decreased blebbing and reduced myoblast migration
  and fusion.
