caption: Diacylglycerol has a central role in TCR signaling. Engagement of the TCR
  leads to the activation of tyrosine kinases and the formation of a multimolecular
  complex including adapter proteins. PLCγ1 is recruited to and activated by this
  complex and in turn hydrolyses the phospholipid PIP2 to form membrane-diffusible
  diacylglycerol (DAG) and cytosolic IP3. DAG activates proteins including RasGRP1,
  PKCs, and PKD. Activation of RasGRP1 leads to Ras and AKT pathway activation. Activation
  of PKCs leads to the activation of NF-κB and cytoskeletal repolarization. Activation
  of PKD leads to integrin activation. IP3, Ras, and PKC-θ signaling cooperate to
  promote T cell activation through the transcription factors NFAT, AP-1, and NF-κB,
  respectively. Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) phosphorylate DAG to form phosphatidic
  acid (PA), thereby potentially regulating a broad set of signaling pathways downstream
  of the TCR.
