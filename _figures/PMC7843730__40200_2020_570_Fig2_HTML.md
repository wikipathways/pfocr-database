caption: ADAM18 interactome. One of four hypothetical proteins (ADAM18, CAC2PBS, vimentin
  variant III, FAM81B) was further analyzed using bioinformatics tools including BLAST
  and functional domain search. ADAM18 interactome was established using PPI map software
  STRING 11.0 (http://string-db.org/) by adding a seed (ADAM18) in the query and applied
  50/50 first and second shell interactions. The ADAM18 interactome shows a functional,
  indirect association and direct physical interactions. ADAM18 interactions in DR
  are derived from eight sources, including neighborhood, gene fusion, co-occurrence,
  high-throughput interaction experiments, and published knowledge (PubMed). ADAM18-UBE3A
  interaction shows a potential ubiquitin signaling by ubiquitin ligase E3A. Our ADAM18
  interactome implies that phosphorylation signaling through ADAM18 may go through
  ADAM18-TGFA-EGFR-RHOA for one direction, as well as ADAM18-ESR1-PI3K-RAC1-CDC42-RAC2
  pathway for the other direction
