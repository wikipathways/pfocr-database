caption: Urine metabolic pathway visualization of rice bran group compared to control
  at 4 weeks. There were 8 metabolic pathway enrichment scores that show metabolites
  that are significantly different between the rice bran group and control at 4 weeks.
  Each metabolite was represented by a closed, colored node extending from a metabolic
  pathway node, which connects to a chemical class hexagonal node. A red node represents
  metabolites with significantly higher expression in rice bran group at 4 weeks compared
  to control group (p≤0 05). A dark blue node represents metabolites with significantly
  lower expression in rice bran group at 4 weeks when compared to control group. Nodes
  colored pink or light blue represent metabolites trending towards significance with
  higher expression in rice bran group at 4 weeks and lower expression at 4 weeks,
  respectively (0 05≤p≤ 0 1). Node size is proportional to fold-difference magnitude
  at week 4 for rice bran group compared to control group. Bolded metabolites indicate
  previously reported evidence for cancer chemoprevention.
