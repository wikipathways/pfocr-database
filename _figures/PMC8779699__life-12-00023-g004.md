caption: D. radiodurans TCA pathway. Triangles represent metabolites; rectangles represent
  non-significant proteins; octagons represent significantly changed proteins. Red
  = increased abundance proteins, blue = decreased abundance proteins of D. radiodurans
  exposed to microgravity during the parabolic flight.
