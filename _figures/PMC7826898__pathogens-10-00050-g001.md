caption: 'N-glycosylation pathways and end products in piroplasmids. (A) Predicted
  pathway for the N-glycosylation of an exported protein in Theileria equi and Cytauxzoon
  felis: (1) Synthesis of dol-P-NAcGlc by Alg7; (2) synthesis of dol-P-P-(NAcGlc)2
  by Alg13/Alg14 (both processes occur at the cytoplasmic leaflet of the rough endoplasmic
  reticulum (RER) membrane and utilize UDP-NAcGlc as sugar donor); (3) synthesis of
  dol-P-P-(NAcGlc)2-Man by Alg1; (4) flipping to the luminal leaflet of the RER by
  a flippase; (5) transfer of (NAcGlc)2 to a signal peptide-bearing nascent protein
  by oligosaccharyl transferase activity (OST); (6) cleavage of signal peptide liberating
  the recently synthesized N-glycosylated protein (green); (7) dephosphorylation of
  dol-P-P to dol-P; (8) flipping of dol-P to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the RER for
  reuse. Babesia s.s. lack step 3, while Theileria s.s. and B. microti lack steps
  3 and 5. SP: Signal peptide. (B) End products resulting from three different N-glycosylation
  enzyme sets: dol-P-P-(NAcGlc)2, and (NAcGlc)2 or Man-(NAcGlc)2 modifying a protein.
  (C) graphical references.'
