caption: Overview of the mitochondrial matrix UPRmt in mammals. Upon mitochondrial
  stress, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)2 and dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)
  contribute to the activation of transcription factor c-Jun, which binds to AP-1
  elements and activates transcription of the transcription factors CHOP and C/EBPβ.
  Dimers of CHOP and C/EBPβ then bind to the CHOP element on the promoter of UPRmt
  genes that encode mitochondrial protein quality control proteins, such as HSP60
  and ClpP, and mitochondrial import components. Two other conserved elements in promoters
  of UPRmtresponse genes, MURE1 and MURE2, are presumably bound by factors that have
  not yet been identified. PKR inhibits cytosolic protein translation by mediating
  phosphorylation of eIF2α.
