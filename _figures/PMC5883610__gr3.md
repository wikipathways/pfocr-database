caption: 'The effective cell stiffness, and thus the direction of topotaxis, are governed
  by the interplay between two parallel signaling pathways diverging from the same
  input and converging on the same target, both activated by the biochemical input
  from the extracellular matrix: PI3K and ROCK (see text for details). The PI3K pathway
  decreases, and the ROCK pathway increases, the effective cell stiffness by regulating
  the cortical cytoskeleton. The relative balance of activity of these pathways determines
  the direction of topotaxis and can be affected by cell identity, genetic mutations,
  or application of pharmacological agents. The balancing interplay between these
  two pathways is partially affected by signaling cross talk.'
