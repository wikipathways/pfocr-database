caption: A The proline metabolic pathway. The NEAA L-proline is formed through reduction
  of precursor P5C that is obtained via two pathways, from glutamine in the mitochondria
  and from ornithine in the cytosol. B Chemical structures of the proline metabolic
  pathway intermediates. Note the secondary amine group in proline is different from
  that of other amino acids. Produced in Chemdraw.
