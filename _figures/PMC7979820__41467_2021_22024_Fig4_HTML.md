caption: 'Blue and yellow panels: the PI3K/AKT pathway can phosphorylate DNMT1, which
  stabilizes it on the chromatin, leading to maintenance of DNA hypermethylation.
  EZH2 is also phosphorylated by PI3K/AKT, which depletes H3K27me3 genome-wide. In
  addition, KMT2D phosphorylation by PI3K/AKT depletes H3K4me1/2, which decreases
  FOXA1 (and therefore, also ERα) chromatin binding, leading to hormone therapy resistance.
  These aberrant epigenetic pathways can be targeted by PI3K inhibitors. Furthermore,
  DNMT1 stabilization and EZH2 inhibition can be targeted by DNA hypomethylating agents
  and HDAC inhibitors, respectively. Purple panel: HDAC recruitment to the ESR1 promoter
  leads to reduced H3K27ac, which results in DNMT1-mediated promoter hypermethylation
  and drug resistance via ESR1 downregulation. HDAC inhibition (entinostat) can be
  used to reverse HDAC-mediated ESR1 downregulation. Orange panel: KDM5 (KDM5A/B)
  is a family of histone H3 lysine 4 demethylases associated with therapeutic resistance
  in different cancer types. Increased activity of KDM5 enzymes leads to reduction
  in H3K4me3 levels and, as a result, increased transcriptional heterogeneity. Particularly,
  high KDM5B expression levels are associated with poor prognosis in ER+ breast cancer.
  Inhibitors to modulate the activity of KDM5 family members can improve the response
  to endocrine therapy agents such as fulvestrant. Green panel: loss of KMT2C redistributes
  ERα to AP-1-regulated genes to promote hormone-independent but ERα-dependent transcription,
  suggesting that treatment with SERDs (fulvestrant) and CDK4/6 inhibition may be
  viable therapeutic options. Red panel: ARID1A is a component of the SWI/SNF complex,
  and its mutation leads to limited chromatin accessibility for ERαα and FOXA1 at
  genes that regulate luminal cell fate, as well as promotes a switch from a luminal
  phenotype to a basal-like phenotype. ARID1A mutations can be targeted with EZH2,
  HDAC, BET, and PI3K/AKT inhibitors.'
