caption: Independence of the signaling pathways of ANF/ATP and of NCδ. The trajectory
  of the ANF pathway (maroon dashed arrow) originates at the ExtD and passes through
  the TM, ARM and signaling helix domain (SHD) in its course to CCD. In contrast,
  the trajectory of the NCδ pathway (blue dashed arrow) lies within the CCD. The ANF-RGC
  dimer is thought to bind a dimer of NCδ, but only a single subunit is shown. Both
  pathways are the physiological regulators of the mouse blood pressure.
