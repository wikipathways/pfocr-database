caption: Metabolic pathways as described in the KEGG Database, with mean relative
  values of detection for parental control strain (left bar in graphs) and degenerated
  strain (right bar in graphs) samples. Graphs highlighted in red indicate significant
  differences between the parental control and degenerated strain samples, as determined
  by both t-test with FDR correction, and having VIP values > 1. Error bars show 95%
  confidence intervals. Arrows between metabolites present pathway steps.
