caption: The BER pathway is essential in the nervous system. The BER system is required
  to correct SSBs and oxidative damage and is a critical main DNA repair pathway in
  the nervous system. The BER components listed in red have been identified in human
  neurodegenerative disease. The scaffold protein XRCC1 is key for efficient BER,
  and the repair enzymes aprataxin (APTX) and tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase-1 (TDP1)
  modify the 5′ and 3′ DNA ends, respectively, after damage to allow for religation/repair
  of the DNA break. Polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP) has a dual kinase/phosphatase
  activity and can process both ends of a DNA break. Mutations in PNKP can result
  in different neurologic disease characterized by either microcephaly or neurodegeneration.
