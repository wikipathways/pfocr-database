caption: Cdc37 is able to bind to a wide spectrum of protein kinases through their
  highly conserved catalytic domain. Depicted here is Cdc37 regulation of the ERK-MAP
  kinase pathway, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-K) pathway, Unc-51-like
  kinase (ULK-1) activity and the activity of AR. The interactions with ERK and PI-3-K
  are not direct but involve other members of these cascade reactions. In this way,
  Cdc37 is able to control a wide spectrum of intracellular metabolic pathways involved
  in cell growth, survival, autophagy and carcinogenesis. AR seems to be exceptional
  in being a non-kinase client of Cdc37.
