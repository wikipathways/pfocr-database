caption: p38α directly phosphorylates more than 100 proteins and can indirectly modulate
  a wider network of targets, explaining the versatility of this pathway. The top
  bar shows the relative distribution of p38α substrates according to their biological
  function. The panels illustrate key substrates and targets in three main p38α-regulated
  processes. In the stress response, p38α has been connected to many protein phosphorylation
  changes, which probably reflects the suitability of this mechanism for cellular
  adaptation by facilitating a rapid control of processes such as cell cycle progression,
  DNA damage repair or mRNA processing. In the immune response, p38α controls the
  phosphorylation of kinases, transcription factors and regulators of mRNA stability,
  which collectively regulate the expression of cytokines and other factors involved
  in inflammatory processes. In addition, the p38α pathway controls the phosphorylation
  of RIPK1 and the IFNα/β receptor IFNAR1, which are important in the response to
  pathogens and inflammation, as well as GSK3, which upon p38α phosphorylation regulates
  lymphocyte fitness and the adaptive immune response. In cell differentiation, and
  in agreement with the irreversible character of this process, p38α phosphorylates
  many transcription factors and chromatin modulators that will directly or indirectly
  control the gene expression programmes driving cell differentiation in different
  tissues. Dashed arrows represent indirect regulation by p38α. MK2, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase 2; RB, retinoblastoma protein;
  STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.

  description: p38α directly phosphorylates more than 100 proteins and can indirectly
    modulate a wider network of targets, explaining the versatility of this pathway.
    The top bar shows the relative distribution of p38α substrates according to their
    biological function. The panels illustrate key substrates and targets in three
    main p38α-regulated processes. In the stress response, p38α has been connected
    to many protein phosphorylation changes, which probably reflects the suitability
    of this mechanism for cellular adaptation by facilitating a rapid control of processes

    response, p38α controls the phosphorylation of kinases, transcription factors
    and regulators of mRNA stability, which collectively regulate the expression of

    p38α pathway controls the phosphorylation of RIPK1 and the IFNα/β receptor IFNAR1,
