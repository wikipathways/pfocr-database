caption: 'Schematic diagram of the genetic and molecular signal dynamics that ZEN
  mainly affected during PF assembly. The figure above shows that ZEN exposure led
  to germ cell DNA damage and granulosa cell apoptosis, thereby inhibiting the process
  of PF assembly. The figure below shows that the main interaction pathway between
  germ cells and granulosa cells was activated during this process. The main regulatory
  factors during the period include: Bmpr1b, Bmp2, Wnt4, Fzd2, Yap1, Tead1, Tead2,
  Smad4, Axin1, and Id1.'
