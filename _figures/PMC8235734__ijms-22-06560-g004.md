caption: TAM-targeted therapy in tumors. Targeting TAM strategies consists of (a)
  the inhibition of the recruitment of macrophages to tumor mass; (b) reprogramming
  TAMs into M1-like macrophages to strengthen antitumor ability (c) the activation
  of “phagocytic checkpoint” to restore macrophage phagocytic function; and (d) targeting
  cGAS-STING pathway in TAMs is a potential anti-tumor approach.
