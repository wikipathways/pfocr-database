caption: Amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing pathways of APP. In the amyloidogenic
  pathway, BACE1 first cleaves APP at the Asp1 site to generate sAPPβ and a 99-amino
  acid membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF) C99. Subsequently, γ-secretase cleaves
  C99 to release Aβ and CTFγ. Under physiological conditions (non-amyloidogenic pathways),
  APP is mostly cleaved first by α-secretase within Aβ domain at the Aβ Leu17 site,
  generating a secreted form of APP (sAPPα) and an 83-amino acid membrane-bound C-terminal
  fragment (CTF) C83, thus precluding Aβ production; BACE1 predominantly processes
  APP at the Aβ Glu11 β-secretase site to generate C89, and γ-secretase cleaves C89
  to produce a truncated Aβ11-40; BACE2 cleaves APP at the Aβ Phe20 θ-secretase site
  to generate C80 and precludes Aβ generation. APP amyloid precursor protein, BACE1
  β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1, sAPP secreted APP, CTF C-terminal fragment, Aβ amyloid-β,
  tAβ truncated amyloid-β, BACE2 β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 2
