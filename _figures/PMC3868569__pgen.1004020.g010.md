caption: Shown is the daf-2/IGFR signaling pathway and eak genes from  with the addition,
  shown in blue, of the effects of tyrosine identified in this work and the control
  of TATN-1 expression by daf-2/IGFR signaling and by dietary and environmental cues
  as demonstrated in . In summary, worms sense the available diet and environmental
  temperature and these factors both contribute to the dauer decision and the regulation
  of TATN-1 protein levels. Conditions which promote the dauer decision also tend
  to reduce the expression of TATN-1. The reductions in TATN-1 expression lead to
  reduced removal of tyrosine through degradation and increase free tyrosine levels
  in the animal. These increases in tyrosine activate aak-2/AMPK and disrupt the effects
  of normal daf-2/IGFR signaling through positive effects on daf-16/FOXO and perhaps
  inhibitory effects on crh-1/CREB. The effects of tyrosine are particularly pronounced
  when the daf-2/IGFR pathway is compromised, such as through mutations in the daf-2/IGFR
  gene or the eak genes which lie in a parallel pathway. This may be due to further
  reductions in TATN-1 expression or reductions in inhibitory regulators of daf-16/FOXO
  activity.
