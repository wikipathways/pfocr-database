caption: Biosynthesis, autoinduction, and virulence regulation by 4-alkyl-quinolones
  in P. aeruginosa. Biosynthesis of PQS starts with the conversion (by the PqsABCD
  proteins) of anthranilate (which originates from either the kynurenine pathway or
  the PhnAB anthranilate synthase) into HHQ, which is finally converted into PQS by
  the PqsH monooxygenase. Both HHQ and PQS bind the PqsR regulator, and the complex
  activates the transcription of the pqsABCDE and phnAB operons, increasing the levels
  of PQS (autoinduction) and pyocyanin production. Additionally, transcription of
  the PQS operon results in an increase in the levels of PqsE, an enzyme of uncharacterized
  function that increases the levels of pyocyanin, lectin, HCN, and rhamnolipids.
