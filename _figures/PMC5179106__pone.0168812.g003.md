caption: 'A) Protein-protein interaction analysis of 524 AD-related proteins revealed
  two large protein clusters: the APP network (14 yellow nodes) and the CAD network
  (11 red nodes). B) The functional enrichment analysis found that five proteins (labeled
  with red stars) of the CAD network are involved in the “Alanine, Aspartate and Glutamate
  Metabolism” pathway (CAD, GAD1, GAD2, GFPT1, GFPT2). The figure was generated based
  on the results obtained by the David online tool and the KEGG database.'
