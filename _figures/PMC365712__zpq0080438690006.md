caption: Possible signaling pathways controlled by PAMH. The activity of PAMH is blocked
  by staurosporin and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG490, implicating serine, threonine
  kinases, and tyrosine kinases, respectively, in the signaling pathway controlled
  by PAMH. PAMH drives nuclear export of HDAC5 and nuclear import of NFATc and stimulates
  the expression of MCIP1 and other genes involved in cardiac growth and remodeling.
  Signaling events that appear to play dominant roles in PAMH signaling are shown
  in bold. Those that are documented, but for which the relative importance remains
  to be established, are shown by thin lines, and those that remain hypothetical are
  shown by dashed lines. Prohypertrophic effectors are in green, and antihypertrophic
  effectors are in red.
