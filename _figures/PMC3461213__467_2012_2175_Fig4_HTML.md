caption: 'Overall picture of the physiology of FGF-23 and its role in phosphate homeostasis.
  FGF-23 inhibits renal Pi reabsorption by reducing the apical expression and activity
  of NaPi-IIa in the proximal tubule epithelium. FGF-23 also reduces intestinal absorption
  of dietary Pi through a vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent decrease in NaPi-IIb
  activity. The latter phenomenon is most likely secondary to FGF-23-mediated reduction
  of circulating 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis through suppression of 1α(OH)ase expression
  in the kidney. The proteins required for mineralization [osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein,
  vitronectin, and dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP-1)] are in dynamic balance with the
  ASARM peptide, an inhibitor of mineralization. In vitro, data indicates that PHEX-sequestered
  matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) is protected from matrix proteases.
  The PHEX sequestration is likely reversible, and free unbound-MEPE is vulnerable
  to cleavage by extracellular matrix proteases/cathepsin B. Cleavage of MEPE would
  result in the release of the protease-resistant stable ASARM peptide (aspartic acid-rich
  motif). Free ASARM peptide may also sterically inhibit the NPT2 co-transporter by
  direct binding. PHEX is expressed in the parathyroid glands and may have a role
  in the normal regulation of PTH. The full-length uncleaved FGF-23 molecule may indirectly/directly
  downregulate the proteins required for mineralization. Thus, FGF-23 and/or other
  cytokines are likely directly/indirectly responsible for the changes in expression
  of these proteins. FGF-23 indirectly or directly suppresses expression of the NPT2
  phosphate co-transporter, suppresses expression of 1α-hydroxylase, and increases
  expression of 24-hydroxylase [decrease in 1,25(OH)2D3]. FGF-23 and Klotho might
  function in a common single transduction pathway. (Modified from R. Pawel et al.:
