caption: Posited future direction to elucidate the epigenetic basis of alcohol-cannabinergic
  pathway associations. We have demonstrated that alcohol induces cannabinoid receptors
  activity in monocyte-derived dendritic cells. In addition, our group has preliminary
  evidence on the ability of chronic alcohol exposure to induce H4K12 acetylation.
  However, whether this increase in acetylation is in turn associated with the regulation
  of cannabinoid receptors and cannabinoid signaling pathways need further investigation.
  Therefore, the epigenetic basis of alcohol-cannabinergic pathway association’s need
  continued examination.
