caption: Infection of RAW macrophages induces caspase-3-apoptosis through the extrinsic
  pathway by manipulating host signaling through type III secretion system effectors
  YopJ and YopK. YopK is located at the plasma membrane where it may control injection
  of effector Yops but may also be required to induce formation of the DISC death
  receptor complex, composed of pro-caspase-8 and -10, FADD and cFLIP, which is necessary
  for activation of caspase-8. In the absence of DISC complex formation, small amounts
  of active caspase-8 can cleave Bid to tBid in the absence of anti-apoptotic factors
  whose expression is repressed through the action of YopJ (green X). Formation of
  the DISC complex is regulated by YopJ. The small molecule SP600125 inhibits JNK
  phosphorylation, thereby causing reduced production of anti-apoptotic genes. Yellow
  background denotes the signaling pathway that may be specific to RAW cells and perhaps
  other immune cells.
