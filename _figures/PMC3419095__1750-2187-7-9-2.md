caption: Molecular mechanisms of the pro- and anti-oncogenic properties of ERK3, ERK4,
  and MK5. (1,2) Oncogenic Ras mutants can increase the transcript levels of ERK4,
  but also results in constitutive activation of Raf. (3) Activated Raf or oncogenic
  BRAFV600E also stimulates transcription of the erk3 gene. (4) The RNA binding protein
  IGB2BP can inhibit translation of ERK4 mRNA. (5) ERK3 and ERK4 proteins can activate
  MK5. (6) Active MK5 can phosphorylate Hsp27, which will affect actin remodelling
  and cell migration. (7) MK5 can also phosphorylate transcription factor FOXO3a,
  which in turn will trigger transcription of microRNA mir34b/c. mir34b/c inhibits
  the cell cycle and prevents translation of c-myc mRNA and hence the production of
  c-MYC, a protein that is important for cell cycle regulation. C-MYC binds to the
  promoter of the mk5 gene and enhances transcription of this gene. FOXO3a also reduces
  expression of VEGF and may thus hamper angiogenesis. (8) MK5-mediated phosphorylation
  of p53 at Ser-37 stimulates the transcriptional activity of p53, resulting in enhanced
  expression of p21Cip1. p21Cip1 inhibits cell cycle progression. (9) ERK3 can sequester
  cyclin D3. By usurping cyclin D3, it may cause cell cycle arrest.
