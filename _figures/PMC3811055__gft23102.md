caption: (A) mTOR pathway. IL2 binds to CD25 located on the surface of activated T
  cells (Signal 3). Signal 3 activates the mTOR pathway, which promotes cellular proliferation
  via induction of the cell cycle. (B) Mechanism of action of mTORI. The mTOR inhibitors
  (sirolimus and everolimus) bind to FKBP12, forming a complex that binds to and inhibits
  mTOR. This results in decreased T-cell signaling and proliferation.
