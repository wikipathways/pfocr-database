caption: Fate of glucose. The major pathways shown in this diagram are glycolysis,
  the TCA cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Additionally, glucose can be used
  as sources for fatty acid synthesis and lactate and alanine formation and can also
  be stored as glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle (not shown in the diagram). The
  pathways in blue (the polyol pathway and the hexosamine pathway) can be significant
  ones for glucose utilization under diabetic conditions.
