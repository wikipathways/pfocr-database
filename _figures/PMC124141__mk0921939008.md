caption: Schematic diagram showing distinct but complementary mechanisms of activation
  of the MAPK cascade in response to classic mitogens and corticosteroids. Classic
  mitogens using a posttranslational mechanism affect the GTP-binding state of Ras
  compared with steroids, which through genomic actions lead to stoichiometric increases
  in total and active Ki-RasA levels without changes in GTP-binding kinetics. Once
  stimulated by either mechanism, Ki-RasA then activates effector kinases through
  a common pathway with the distinction being that the genomic response compared with
  the posttranslational mechanism has a delayed onset and prolonged signal.

  description: Schematic diagram showing distinct but complementary mechanisms of
    activation of the MAPK cascade in response to classic mitogens and corticosteroids.
    Classic mitogens using a posttranslational mechanism affect the GTP-binding state
    of Ras compared with steroids, which through genomic actions lead to stoichiometric
    increases in total and active Ki-RasA levels without changes in GTP-binding kinetics.
    Once stimulated by either mechanism, Ki-RasA then activates effector kinases through
    a common pathway with the distinction being that the genomic response compared
    with the posttranslational mechanism has a delayed onset and prolonged signal.
