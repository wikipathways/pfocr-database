caption: 'The signaling of Wnt and calcium ions through MCOLN: CUR can activate Wnt
  signaling way by increasing the stability of β-cyclin, leading to its accumulation
  in the cytoplasm. Following this, the Wnt signaling pathway triggers the activation
  of Wnt target genes within the nucleus, which ultimately contributes to neuroprotection.
  CUR also can facilitate the entry of calcium ions into the cell through MCOLN, activate
  TFEB, and the activated TFEB enters the nucleus, promoting the transcription of
  related genes.6. Nicotine'
