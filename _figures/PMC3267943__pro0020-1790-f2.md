caption: 'Conformational dynamics of the SRP and SR GTPases drive and regulate protein
  targeting. All the steps are numbered to be consistent between parts (A) and (B).
  The SRP GTPase is in blue, the SR GTPase is in green. T and D denote GTP and GDP,
  respectively. (A) Conformational changes during the SRP-SR interaction and their
  allosteric regulation by biological cues. The catalytic loops are highlighted in
  red, and the GTP analogues are in spacefill. “⊥''” denotes the pausing effect from
  cargo. Top panel: the crystal structures of the free SRP and SR GTPases from T.
  aquaticus (1JPJ and 2Q9B, respectively). “G” and “N” denote the two subdomains in
  SRP and SR''s GTPase module. Right panel: a molecular model of the early intermediate
  (2XKV). Bottom panel: Cocrystal structure of the T. aquaticus SRP-SR GTPase complex
  (1RJ9) in the closed/activated state. Left panel: Active site interactions mediated
  by the catalytic loops. The GMPPCP molecules from SRP and SR are in blue and green,
  respectively, active site Mg2+ are in magenta, nucleophilic waters (W) are in blue,
  and the side chains of catalytic residues are in red. (B) GTPase rearrangements
  provide multiple regulatory points during protein targeting, as described in the
  text. At each step, the cargo can be either retained in (black arrows) or rejected
  from (red arrows) the SRP pathway.'
