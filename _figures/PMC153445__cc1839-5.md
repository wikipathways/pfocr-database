caption: Schematic diagram of NF-κB activation circuits and oxygen-signaling mechanisms.
  Reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to glutathione (GSH), which is blocked
  by 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), leads to increasing intracellular
  stores of GSSG, a potent inhibitor of NF-κB transcription factor DNA binding. The
  pathway leading to the formation of GSH by the action of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase
  (GCS) is blocked by L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), inducing an irreversible
  inhibition of NF-κB activation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key components
  of the pathways leading to the activation of NF-κB, whose binding activity is obliterated
  by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), potent scavengers
  of ROS. Although NAC is elevating reduced GSH, it is unknown whether this mechanism
  induces NF-κB activation independently from the antioxidant effects of this inhibitor.
  PDTC elevates GSSG concentration by GSH oxidation, a pro-oxidant effect characteristic
  of dithiocarbamates, thereby mediating NF-κB inhibition. Upon NF-κB DNA binding,
  cascades of hyperoxia-responsive genes are activated, which have the potential to
  modulate cellular response to oxidative injury. ROOH, highly reactive peroxide.
