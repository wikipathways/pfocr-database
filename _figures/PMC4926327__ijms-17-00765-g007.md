caption: The mechanism of stimulated VSMC proliferation through the Wnt4/Dvl-1/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. External stimuli could increase the expression of Wnt4 and the
  elevated Wnt4 activate the cytosolic protein Dvl-1 by interacting with its receptor,
  Frizzled receptor 1 (Fzd-1). Then, the activated Dvl-1 may influence the functional
  state of the complex APC-Axin-GSK-3β (consisting of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC),
  Axin, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β) and cadherins, resulting in the rapid increase
  of free β-catenin in the cytoplasm. The free β-catenin would translocate to the
  nucleus and bind members of the T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)
  transcription factor family, regulating the expressions of downstream signaling
  molecules, including p21 and Cyclin D1.
