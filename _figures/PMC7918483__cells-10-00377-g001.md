caption: Overview of thiol-based metabolic glycoengineering (MGE). (a) Thiol groups
  can be metabolically installed into cell surface sialic acids by incubating cells
  with exogenously-supplied ManNAc analogs that have thiol groups masked by acetyl
  esters [,]; these protecting groups facilitate uptake into cells and then are removed
  (along with the analog’s hydroxyl esters [,]) by intracellular esterases [,]. The
  resulting thiol-modified ManNAc analogs intercept the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway
  and replace naturally-occurring sialic acids (e.g., Neu5Ac, the predominant form
  of this sugar in humans) in cell surface glycans with their thio-glycosialoside
  counterparts. (b) In previous work, we described the “scaffold-dependent” activity
  of thiol-modified sialic acids with short linker lengths between the thiol group
  and core sugar; an example of a ManNAc analog that installs such a sialic acid into
  cellular glycans is Ac5ManNTGc [] (). (c) In the current report, we describe thiol-modified
  analogs (e.g., Ac5ManNTProp and Ac5ManNTBut, also shown in ) with longer linkers
  (i.e., with 3 or 4 carbon atoms in the N-acyl linker) between the thiol and core
  sugar that have enhanced scaffold-independent biological responses.
