caption: Autophagy regulation by the mTOR signaling pathway. Autophagy can be regulated
  by both mTOR-dependent as well as mTOR-independent pathways. mTOR phosphorylation
  can lead to ribosomal P70S6K1 phosphorylation, which is an mTOR substrate protein,
  thereby preventing autophagy initiation. Autophagy can additionally be stimulated
  by certain other elements for example starvation, chronic stress, as well as GCs
  through mTOR inhibition. Furthermore, TRPML1/PPARγ/AMPK/mTOR and PI3K/Akt/mTOR are
  positive and negative autophagy regulators, respectively, and stimulation as well
  as prevention of these pathways may trigger autophagy. Also, dihydroceramide is
  a regulator of mTOR-mediated autophagy induction. However, ROS stimulates autophagy
  via mTOR-dependent (inhibit Akt) as well as mTOR-independent pathways directly activate
  autophagy. Besides, inflammatory stimulation of microglia plays a role in autophagy
  initiation. TRPM7, CaMKKβ, AMPK as well as TyrRS, PARP1, and SIRT1 are the most
  important positive modulators in mTOR-independent autophagy regulation.
