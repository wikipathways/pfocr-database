caption: A schematic model for the role of ANXA2 in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis.
  A, uterine endometrium under normal conditions. B, under elevated E2 concentration,
  endometrial epithelial cells undergo EMT process and acquire increased migration
  potential. C, molecular events during E2-induced EMT in adenomyosis development.
  Increased E2 level in females might lead to overexpression of ANXA2 in endometrial
  epithelial cells that causes EMT. This process involves E-cadherin suppression and
  vimentin induction in ANXA2-overexpressing cells. Loss of E-cadherin expression,
  together with inhibition of GSK-3β, results in nuclear localization of β-catenin
  that activates β-catenin/Tcf signaling. Hence, these cells may acquire increased
  capacity of proliferation, motility, invasion, and anoikis resistance in the new
  microenvironment. Moreover, ANXA2-expressing cells could activate the HIF-1α/VEGF-A
  signaling pathway that contributes to neovascularization in the new microenvironment
  that supports the ectopic growth of endometrium during the pathogenesis of adenomyosis.
  D, ectopic growth of endometrium supported by neovasculature in adenomyosis.
