caption: Heme biosynthesis. Schematic representation of the heme biosynthetic pathway.
  Heme synthesis starts with the condensation of Succynil-CoA and glycine to form
  ALA. ALA is then transported through the two mitochondrial membranes in the cytosol
  where it is converted to CPgenIII through a series of enzymatic reactions. Briefly,
  the aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD) catalyzes the condensation of two molecules
  of ALA to form one molecule of the monopyrrole porphobilinogen. Then, the hydroxymethylbilane
  synthase (HMBS) catalyzes the head-to-tail synthesis of four porphobilinogen molecules
  to form the linear tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane which is converted to uroporphyrinogen
  III by uroporphyrinogen synthase (UROS). The last cytoplasmic step, the synthesis
  of CPgenIII, is catalyzed by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD). CPOX is a homodimer
  weakly associated with the outside of the inner mitochondrial membrane and it converts
  CPgenIII to protoporphyrinogen IX. The following oxidation of protoporphyrinogen
  IX to PPIX is catalyzed by PPOX, located on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial
  membrane. Finally, ferrous iron is incorporated into PPIX to form heme in the mitochondrial
  matrix, a reaction catalyzed by FECH. In hematopoietic tissue, iron is imported
  into mitochondria by MFRN1. FECH is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane
  in association to MFRN1 and ABCB10. SLC25A38 and ABCB10 have been proposed as mitochondrial
  ALA exporters on the inner mitochondrial membrane. The ALA transporter located on
  the outer mitochondrial membrane has not been identified yet. ABCB6 has been proposed
  as a putative mitochondrial CPgenIII importer. However, this role is still controversial.
  Finally, several data suggest that FLVCR1b is a mitochondrial heme exporter.
