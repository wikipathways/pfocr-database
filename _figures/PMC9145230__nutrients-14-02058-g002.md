caption: 'Metabolic pathways directly or indirectly related to the methylcobalamin.
  Notes: Methylcobalamin is a cofactor for methionine synthase, which is the central
  enzyme of the one-carbon metabolism (metabolites in bold) that includes the folate
  cycle (left) and the methionine cycle (right). Two methionine salvage pathways are
  not represented in this figure: a first salvage pathway allows methionine synthesis
  from homocysteine and betaine thanks to the cobalamin independent betaine-homocysteine
  methyltransferase, and a second salvage pathway allows the methionine synthesis
  from SAM via the polyamine pathway. B9: vitamin B9; AMP: adenosine monophosphate;
  DHF: dihydrofolate; GMP: guanosine monophosphate; IMP: inosine monophosphate; MAT(A2):
  methionine adenosyltransferase (notably MATA2); mB12: methylcobalamin; MS: methionine
  synthase; MT: methyltransferases; MTHFR: methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; SAH:
  S-adenosylhomocysteine; SAHH: SAH hydrolase; SAM: S-adenosylmethionine; THF: tetrahydrofolate;
  TMP: thymidine monophosphate; UMP: uridine monophosphate. Figure created with BioRender.com
