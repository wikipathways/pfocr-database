caption: During inflammation, MMP9 expression is elevated and we have shown previously
  that MMP9 activates Notch1. Active Notch1 (NICD) then translocates to nucleus and
  activates p53. Activation of p53 activates p21WAF1/Cip1 which promotes cell cycle
  arrest and thereby promoting the protection from CAC and/or activates caspase cascade
  leading to an increase in apoptosis and thereby resulting in protection from CAC.
  Thus MMP-9 acts as a tumor suppressor during CAC, likely through p53 activation
  via activation of Notch1.
