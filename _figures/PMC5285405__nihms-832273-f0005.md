caption: Viral regulation of host proteins via post translational modifications. HSV-1
  US3 protein can hyperphosphorylate IRF3 and RelA to prevent their nuclear localization
  and transcription activation functions. HCMV can inhibit the Jak-mediated STAT1
  phosphorylation in an SHP2-dependent manner, preventing STAT1-mediated induction
  of IFN-inducing genes. E4orf4 of adenovirus, together with PP2A, reduces phosphorylation
  of DDR proteins to inhibit DNA damage response. HPV infection enhances HDAC3-mediated
  RelA deacetylation by upregulating IFRD1 via the EGFR pathway, which decreases the
  duration of NF-κB signaling. HCMV IE1 binds to PML and limits its SUMOylation, repressing
  the formation of PML-NBs. Phosphorylation, P; acetylation, Ac; SUMOylation, SUMO.
