caption: Working model for cross-pathway regulation between competence and biofilm
  in B. subtilis. Competence development is initiated when the quorum-sensing (QS)
  peptide derived from ComX (ComX*) is sensed by a membrane histidine kinase ComP
  (). The response regulator ComA then activates an srfAA-AD operon and an embedded
  small gene, comS. The latter encodes a positive regulator, ComS, for the competence
  activator, ComK (). ComKON cells express late competence genes, which ultimately
  differentiate into competent cells ready for DNA uptake. Here, we propose that ComK
  simultaneously and negatively regulates the biofilm pathway by repressing the key
  biofilm regulatory gene sinI (shown as 1). SinI antagonizes the biofilm master repressor
  SinR to derepress genes for the biofilm matrix production (epsA-O, tapA, etc.).
  Negative regulation of sinI by ComK is expected to inhibit biofilm formation. SlrR
  is another antagonist of SinR that forms a double-negative loop with SinR. Under
  biofilm-inducing conditions, sinI is activated by the developmental master regulator
  Spo0A in response to sensory kinases (e.g., KinC) sensing various environmental
  signals. Here, we also propose that the biofilm regulator SlrR negatively regulates
  competence development through several distinct mechanisms. First, SlrR activates
  matrix production, which physically blocks sensing of the quorum-sensing peptide
  signal ComX* (shown as 4) (); second, SlrR-induced cell chaining may block DNA uptake
  since DNA uptake machinery was shown to be pole-localized (, ) (shown as 3); and
  third, SlrR negatively regulates the srfAA-AD operon and comS (shown as 2). Red
  arrows and blue lines represent positive and negative regulation, respectively.
