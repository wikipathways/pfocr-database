caption: Diagrammatic representation of pathological phenotypes (depression, dementia,
  inflammation, oxidative stress, amyloid plaque, neurotransmitter deficits, Lewy
  aggregation, ER stress, mitochondrial deficits, and cell death) and underlying molecular
  pathways that could be involved in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Pathways
  regulated by isoliquiritigenin (ILG) and liquiritigenin (LG) were labeled as green
  and red lines, respectively. Pathways targeted by both ILG and LG were colored as
  black line. Arrows (↓) denote stimulation and bars (⊥) denote inhibition by ILG
  (green), LG (red), and both (black). PD related pathways include MAO (monoamine
  oxidase), and Lewy aggregation. AD related pathways include amyloid plaque formation
  and AChE (acetylcholine esterase). Other pathological processes are related to both
  AD and PD, thus could be therapeutic targets by ILG or LG. The scheme was generated
  by using Pathway Builder Tool.
