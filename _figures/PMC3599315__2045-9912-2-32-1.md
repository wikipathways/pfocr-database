caption: Proposed mechanisms of effect of CO on presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic
  neurons on change to lactate as metabolic substrate. Ca2+signaling has been proposed
  as the primary determiner of change from glucose to lactate metabolism in the brain.
  CO could block both NMDA R and VGCC allowing less Ca2+ to reach the cytoplasm. This
  would decrease the amount of glucose available for the mitochondrial TCA cycle in
  both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Physiologic cystosol Ca2+ also binds
  to aralar which allows an increase in malate transfer into the mitochondria and
  a change to the CiMASH pathway.
