caption: The metabolic characteristics of the glioma microenvironment, along with
  changes in the activity of metabolic enzymes induced by abnormal gene expression,
  are key factors contributing to the increased lactylation modification in gliomas.
  Lactylation-mediated regulation of gene expression promotes glioma progression through
  various pathways. Firstly, enhanced interconnection of JNK and NF-κB pathways promotes
  the tumor cells’ inherent proliferative capacity, while abnormal vascular proliferation
  provides the necessary external conditions for the unlimited growth of tumor cells.
  Together, these factors synergistically enhance the cell’s motility and invasiveness.
  Additionally, lactate accumulation in advanced gliomas leads to an increase in the
  proportion of Treg cells and M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, which
  mediates immune suppression and hinders the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Lactylation
  modification also contributes to tumor cell resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy
  by regulating DNA repair processes
