caption: 'Stimulation of B cells with NHL-a101 and NHL-a102 vp17s induces the activation
  of several signaling molecules involved in promoting cell survival, cell proliferation,
  cell cycle progression, G1/S and G2/M phase transition. STRING database and literature
  data mining were used to identify known and experimentally verified interactions.
  The several kinases involved in the pathway are represented by diamonds, the other
  proteins by ellipses. The proteins represented in cyan are the ones activated by
  both NHL-a101 and NHL-a102. The molecules activated by NHL-a101 are in magenta,
  the ones stimulated by NHL-a102 in yellow. PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase;
  Akt: protein kinase B; CDK1: cyclin-dependent kinase 1; ABL1: tyrosine-protein kinase
  ABL1; CDK2: cyclin-dependent kinase 2; CDK4: cyclin-dependent kinase 4; CDK6: cyclin-dependent
  kinase 6; CHEK1: serine/threonine-protein kinase Chk1; CHEK2: serine/threonine-protein
  kinase Chk2; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; eIF-2A: interferon-induced,
  double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase; hMSH2: DNA mismatch repair protein
  Msh2; JAK-1: tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1; MAPK 8: mitogen-activated protein kinase
  8; NPM: nucleophosmin; p53: cellular tumor antigen p53; PTP-1B: tyrosine-protein
  phosphatase non-receptor type 1; RAC1: ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate
  1; RAF1: tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1; Rb: Retinoblastoma-associated protein; STAT1:
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta.'
