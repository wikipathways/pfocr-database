caption: Proposed model for regulation of neuronal differentiation by DUSP4. This
  study is the first to demonstrate that DUSP4 regulates the ERK pathway through a
  negative feed-forward system for neuronal differentiation and is linked to Ca2+signaling.
  Thus, DUSP4 knockdown seems to be responsible for the hyperactivation of ERK as
  well as the perturbation of calcium-related signaling.
