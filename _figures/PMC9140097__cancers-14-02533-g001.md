caption: Mechanisms and effect of chromosomal instability in CML. The BCR::ABL fusion
  oncoprotein leads to a state of genomic instability, along with multiple metabolic
  changes in the cells, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). There is an increased sensitivity to ROS in the cellular microenvironment
  in view of defective assessment of genetic stress and aberrations, and a skewed
  DNA damage response towards error-prone repair pathways such as NHEJ and alternate
  NHEJ. These ultimately lead to multiple chromosomal changes, such as point mutations
  in the DNA affecting the genetic and epigenetic pathways alike. Additional chromosomal
  abnormalities, not limited to the changes in the above figure, are a fallout of
  these pathological processes which further destabilize the genome. These intertwined
  steps promote leukemogenesis through proliferation advantage, inhibition of apoptosis,
  and differentiation block, which results in CML developing more TKI resistance and
  progression to the advanced phases. G—guanine; A—adenine; T—thymine; C—cytosine;
  O—oxygen radical; HRR—homologous recombination repair; NHEJ—non homologous end joining;
  alt NHEJ—alternate pathway of NHEJ; SSA—single-strand annealing; MMR—mismatch repair;
  NER—nucleotide excision repair; DNA DSB—DNA double-strand breaks; and SSB—single-strand
  breaks.
