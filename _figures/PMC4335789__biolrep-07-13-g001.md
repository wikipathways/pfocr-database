caption: More than 30 small molecule inhibitors targeting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K) pathway are currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy. PI3K inhibition
  can promote anti-tumor responses, but drug resistance mechanisms frequently limit
  the efficacy of PI3K pathway inhibition. Mechanisms of resistance to the PI3K pathway
  inhibitors involve the incomplete inhibition of pathway activity, reactivation of
  the PI3K pathway or activation of alternative pro-survival pathways.GF, growth factor;
  mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; mTORC1, mTOR complex 1; mTORC2, mTOR complex
  2; PDK-1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate;
  PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RTK, receptor
  tyrosine kinase.
