caption: A) Normal baroreflex response following activation of inflammatory reflex
  pathway. B) Proposed SARS-CoV-2 mechanism for baroreflex impairment.A) A profound
  increase in parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity through the inflammatory
  reflex pathway would be anticipated to suppress the inflammatory response. Increased
  PNS activation would reduce heart rate (HR) while the inflammatory response would
  cause vasodilation. Baroreceptor (BR) unloading would reduce afferent firing to
  the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), eventually leading to reduce PNS and increase
  sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. Tachycardia and vasoconstriction would
  increase HR and blood pressure (BP).B) If the severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infiltrate the NTS and affect the central baroreflex
  arc then the efferent SNS outflow to the heart and vasculature may be impaired.
  The bradycardic effects of PNS activation and the vasodilatory responses to inflammation
  would persist, leading to reductions in HR and BP, and increase potential for syncope.Abbr.
