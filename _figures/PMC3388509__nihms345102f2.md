caption: Damage of the gut epithelial layer leads to invasion of commensal bacteria
  into submucosa and lamina propria, and rapid activation of inflammasome complex
  in the epithelial cells and macrophages. Inflammasomes activate proinflammatory
  cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 as an early response of injury and inflammation. These
  two cytokines, particularly IL-18, play regulating roles in colitis and colorectal
  tumorigenesis depending on their concentration and context of the disease. In general,
  IL-18 protects colitis by inducing proliferation of epithelial cells to repair the
  damaged epithelia during acute colitis and inhibits tumorigeneis by activating STAT1
  antitumor signaling pathway. Defects in IL-18 production leads to increased epithelial
  barrier permeability and hyperproduction of other proinflammatory cytokines including
  IL-6, TNF-α, chemokines KC, MIP2, eotaxin, and tumor promoting factors COX2, reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and matrix metaloprotineases
  (MMPs). Although cytokines, chemkines, ROS and RNS exerts antimicrobial and healing
  functions, they also contribute to chronic inflammation and neoplastic transformation
  of epithelial cells.
