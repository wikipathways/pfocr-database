caption: A functional riboflavin synthesis pathway is found in commensal and pathogenic
  species, which can lead to MR1-dependent presentation of metabolites to MAIT cells.
  (A) A TCR signal alone is not sufficient to elicit robust effector function, thus
  commensal-derived antigen in the absence of additional inflammatory cues is not
  sufficient to elicit MAIT cell effector function (B) Proinflammatory cytokines including
  IL-12/15/18 are elicited following infection and synergize with the TCR signal to
  elicit robust effector function.
