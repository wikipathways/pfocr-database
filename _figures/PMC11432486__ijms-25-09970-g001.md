caption: A proposed schematic representation of the progression from inflammation
  to fibrosis in heart tissue following exposure to an external pathogen. Dendritic
  cells recognize the pathogen, triggering the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB/p50
  signaling pathway, leading to the expression of type I interferon (IFN-α/β) genes.
  This interaction further activates T helper (Th) cells, with Th1 promoting inflammation
  via cytokines such as IFN-γ and Th2, mediating anti-inflammatory responses through
  interleukin (IL)-6, IL-23, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and Th17, contributing
  to chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Macrophages also amplify the inflammatory
  response through cytokine release. Mangiferin inhibits the NF-κB pathway, thereby
  reducing immune cell activation. Trolox reduces oxidative stress by decreasing reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and preventing apoptosis, while Prednisone is used to decrease
  inflammation. Additionally, the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) initiates
  the PI3K/Akt pathway, driving cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis, ultimately
  leading to tissue remodeling and fibrosis
