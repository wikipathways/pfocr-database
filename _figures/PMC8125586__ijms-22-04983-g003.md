caption: 'The physiological pathway of vitamin D synthesis and activation. (A) Ultraviolet
  radiation promotes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to pre–vitamin D3, which
  isomerizes to vitamin D3 (also called cholecalciferol) in the skin, due to sun heat.
  Diet supplements directly provide Vitamin D3, also called ergocalciferol. In the
  liver, a 25-hydroxylation by CYP2R1 is carried out, thus leading to the formation
  of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. In the kidney, CYP27B1 further hydroxylates 25-hydroxyvitamin
  D3 at the 1-α position, resulting in the formation of the active hormone 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin
  D3. The active form of vitamin D then enters into the cell via diffusion or endocytic
  receptor for transcription. Inside the cell, vitamin D binds to both vitamin D receptors
  at the nucleus and cell membrane. In the nucleus, both active forms of vitamin D
  and its receptor form a regulatory complex that finally leads to the beginning of
  the transcription process. In the cell membrane, binding to vitamin D receptors
  lead to several intracellular signal transductions. (B) An alternative pathway has
  been described. In this case, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
  metabolites are hydroxylated by other two cytochromes: on the one hand, a dominant
  gain-of-function mutation in CYP3A4, mainly located in the liver, leads to acceleration
  in vitamin D inactivation; on the other hand, hydroxylation by CYP24A1, mainly located
  in the mitochondria, gives rise to the formation of an active metabolite, 24R,25(OH)2D3.
  This molecule has been described to bind to FAM57B2 in fractured bones. This leads
  to the production of lactosylceramide (LacCer), which is essential for the callus
  formation and fracture healing.'
