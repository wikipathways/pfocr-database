caption: 'Candidate driving genetic alterations and their druggability in AYA cancers.
  An analysis of WES/WTS and OncoScan™ with our heuristic annotation identified level-1
  candidate genetic alterations. By analyzing DAVID and DGIdb, the representative
  pathway of AYA cancers and druggability were also identified. The druggability is
  indicated by illustrations of pills; red indicates a direct inhibitor of a candidate
  target gene, and blue/yellow indicates an inhibitor of a pathway that includes the
  candidate alterations. AYA07 was excluded from the candidate gene search due to
  the hypermutation. All candidate genetic alterations are described in Additional
  file : Table S3'
