caption: Roles of N-acetyl-l-glutamate synthase (NAGS) and of its homologous enzyme
  N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase (NAGK) in arginine biosynthesis. Two arrows in succession
  indicate the existence of two steps that are not detailed. Double and triple green
  arrows and green-encircled plus signs denote activation, whereas double red arrows
  and red-encircled minus signs denote inhibition. OTC, ornithine transcarbamylase.
  ARG1, arginase 1. (A) Schematic representation of the arginine biosynthetic pathway
  of P. aeruginosa and of many other bacteria and plants. The dotted arrows for the
  NAGS reaction indicate an anaplerotic role of NAGS in those organisms, like P. aeruginosa,
  in which the N-acetyl group is recycled by transacetylation from acetylornithine
  to glutamate (). However, some organisms, like E. coli, deacetylate acetylornithine
  hydrolytically, and in these cases, NAGS makes one NAG molecule per arginine molecule
  synthesized (). The structures of the NAGS from N. gonorrhoeae () (PDB accession
  number 2R8V) and of the NAGK from P. aeruginosa () (PDB accession number 2BUF) are
  shown next to the steps catalyzed by them to grossly illustrate their structural
  similarity. They are viewed along their 3-fold axes, with each dimer colored differently
  and with both subunits of each dimer in different hues. NAGK and the AAK domain
  of NAGS are shown in a cartoon representation. In NAGS, to avoid occluding the view
  of the AAK domains, the GNAT domains are shown in a surface semitransparent representation,
  and those in the background are fainter. (B) Arginine and urea biosynthesis in urea-making
  terrestrial animals such as humans. Animals do not make ornithine through N-acetylated
  intermediates, and they lack NAGK and other enzymes of the route except NAGS ().
  The large green triple arrow stresses the essentiality of the activation of carbamoyl
  phosphate synthetase (CPS I) by NAG.
