caption: Various factors could cause DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs). SSBs are repaired
  by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) through the base excision repair (BER) mechanism.
  Therefore, the application of PARP inhibitors will enable BER and cause many SSBs.
  These lesions will transfer to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during cell proliferation.
  DSBs are repaired by BRCA through the gene conversion (GC) pathway in normal cells.
  However, in BRCA-loss cancer cells, DSBs cannot be repaired and will lead to fatal
  genomic instability
