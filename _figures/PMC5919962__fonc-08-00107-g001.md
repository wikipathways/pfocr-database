caption: Platelet targeted therapeutics. The platelet plasma membrane displays multiple
  receptors that can interact with agonists, antagonists, matrix proteins, collagen,
  other platelets, endothelial cells, immune cells, and tumor cells. (A) Platelets
  adhere to the damaged vascular endothelium via GPIb-IX-V complex to von Willebrand
  factor (vWF) and via GPVI and GPIa/IIa (α2β1) to collagen. (B) Focal adhesion kinase
  (FAK) helps mediate GPVI binding to collagen among other integrin-mediated interactions.
  FAK inhibitors could also potentially inhibit GPIIb/IIIa (αIIbβ3) interactions that
  stimulate calcium and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB-1) or paxillin that is linked
  to Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rho-GEF) signaling. Alternatively, FAK
  inhibition may also alter actin-related protein 2/3 complex interactions during
  actin polymerization and shape change. Direct inhibition of GPIIb/IIIa interactions
  with fibrinogen or fibronectin during platelet aggregation can be disrupted by receptor
  antagonists. Similarly, direct inhibition of avb3 interactions with vitronectin
  can also be inhibited. (C) Thrombin Gq-protein-coupled receptors involved in platelet
  activation are protease-activated receptors (PAR) 1 and 4. PARs are stimulated by
  tumor cell tissue factor-factor VII-factor X complex. Thrombin stimulation of PAR
  1 acts through the Rho-GEF pathway while PAR4 Gq activation occurs through beta
  arrestin-2. Signal transduction targets include Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) or
  the cytoskeletal protein myosin II. Tumor cell podoplanin interacts with platelet
  C-type lectin domain family 2 (CLEC-2) that transduce signals through spleen tyrosine
  kinase (Syk) and phospholipase C gamma2 (PLCγ2). Tumor cell mucins and other carbohydrate
  moieties interact with P-selectin are also targets. These P-selectin targets include
  interactions with lymphocyte L-selectins or endothelial cell E-selectins. (D) The
  release of alpha granules leads to localized increases in growth factors such as
  platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor
  (VEGF) and tyrosine kinase receptor stimulating molecules such as fc receptor stimulating
  molecules FcgammaRIIa. (E) The activation of platelets by ADP (adenosine diphosphate)
  released from dense granules mainly involves P2Y1 or P2Y12 receptors. P2Y1 signals
  through Gag-protein-coupled receptors that stimulate PLCγ followed by phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and inositol trisphosphate 3 (IP3) that stimulates its receptor
  embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which causes calcium ion release (Ca2+).
  Alternately, diacylglycerol (DAG) interacts with protein kinase C (PKC). These interactions
  impinge upon DAG-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor I (CalDAG-GEFI)-Ras-related
  protein 1 (Rap1) releasing Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) leading
  to actin changes. (F) Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is also released from dense
  granules that act through 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors (5HT2AR) that activate the
  Gaqpathway and Ca2+ release. (G) An important antiplatelet agent is aspirin that
  is well known to prevent cancer progression. Aspirin irreversibly acetylates cyclooxygenase
  1 (COX-1) eliminating all prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. COX-1 enzymatically adds
  two oxygens to arachidonic acid to produce PGG2 and then PGH2, which is converted
  to various PGs by synthase enzymes. Key platelet PGs are the potent pro-aggregatory
  agent thromboxane (TX)A2 synthesized by TXA2 synthase. (H) Also, PGE2 synthesized
  by PGE2 synthase. TXA2 and PGE2 cause different platelet responses by stimulating
  various isoforms of G-protein-coupled TP or EP receptors. TP signals through G12/13
  and Rho-GEF followed by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), LIM domain kinase (LIMK),
  and cofilin and subsequent interactions with actin. Additional interactions include
  those with myosin light chain kinase followed by myosin. Similarly, EP3 receptors
  stimulate the same signal transduction pathways as Gaq-calcium release linked receptors.
  (I) An important Gas-protein-coupled receptor is the IP for prostacyclin (PGI2)
  that prevents aggregation by stimulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production
  by adenylate cyclase (AC) and is influenced by phosphodiesterase 3 or 5 activity.
  Another abundant eicosanoid produced from arachidonic acid by platelets is 12(S)-HETE
  [12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid] via the activity of the platelet-type lipoxygenase
  (p12-LOX). Recently, 12-(S)HETE is proposed to activate orphan receptor GPR31.
