caption: PAC-1 enhances the apoptotic signal as induced by cytotoxins such as doxorubicin.
  (a) Doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II, resulting in canonical intrinsic pathway
  apoptosis. (b) PAC-1 induces apoptosis through chelation of labile inhibitory zinc
  from procaspase-3, and PAC-1 also relieves zinc-mediated inhibition of caspase-3
  activity. (c) The combination of PAC-1 and doxorubicin induces amplified levels
  of apoptosis due a primed (nonzinc inhibited) population of procaspase-3 that is
  more responsive to upstream proteolysis (see data in b and Supporting Figures 5b
  and 6). In addition, PAC-1 enables any caspase-3 generated by doxorubicin to be
  more active, through chelation of inhibitory zinc from caspase-3 (see data in c
  and Supporting Figure 5c). Elevated caspase-3 activity leads to enhanced cleavage
  of the endogenous protein substrate PARP-1 (b,e and Supporting Figures 5b and 6),
  and higher levels of apoptotic cell death (a and Supporting Figure 5a).
