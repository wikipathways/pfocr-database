caption: Some examples of 13C-labelling patterns in brain metabolism, based on results
  with singly labelled substrates (). Turquoise fills indicate 13C atoms. Yellow highlight
  indicates the metabolic pathway by which 13C-labelled lactate is processed via the
  TCA cycle, emerging as 13C-labelled glutamate or 13C-labelled glutamine that can
  be recovered in brain microdialysates. (For interpretation of the references to
  colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
