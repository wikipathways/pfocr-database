caption: Upregulated glycolysis in lung myofibroblasts is mediated by the elevated
  GLUT1, HK2, PFKFB3, PFK1, LDHα, etc. Augmented glycolysis leads to TCA cycle dysregulation
  and increased succinate, which stabilizes HIF-1α and thereby promoting myofibroblast
  differentiation. A glycolysis diverting pathway, the de novo serine/glycine synthesis,
  is also upregulated in myofibroblasts, which is mediated by ATF4 dependent transactivation
  of PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH. The newly synthesized glycine contributes to collagen
  translation. Glutaminolysis in myofibroblasts is upregulated by Gls1, which leads
  to increased α-KG that promotes collagen proline hydroxylation. This modification
  increases nascent collagen stability. Augmented glutaminolysis also leads to elevated
  glutamate, which in turn increases de novo proline and glycine synthesis and thereby
  promoting collagen translation.
