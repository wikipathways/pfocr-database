caption: Schematic showing the role of CNPase/Notch signalling pathway in modulating
  EMT and fibrosis. During the EMT process, CNPase activates EMT through the canonical
  Notch signalling pathway. After ligand binding, the Notch receptor is cleaved by
  γ‐secretase, and NICD is released and subsequently translocates into the nucleus
  to regulate the expression of downstream target genes, leading to EMT and fibrosis.
  During this process, CNPase can target the regulation of Notch‐1 to upregulate Notch
  signalling pathway activity, thus promoting EMT and fibrosis. Moreover, DAPT, a
  specific inhibitor of the Notch pathway, can reverse EMT and fibrosis
