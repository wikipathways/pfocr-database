caption: Activation of the D1–D2DR heteromer leads to intracellular calcium mobilization
  from IP3 receptor-sensitive stores through a cascade of events involving rapid translocation
  of Gαq to the plasma membrane and activation of PLC. The increase in the calcium
  concentration leads to the promotion of PKC γ, CaMKII, MAPK, and CREB activation,
  which could increase the excitability of spinal neurons to promote the development
  of chronic neuropathic pain. l-CDL inhibits the formation of the D1–D2DR complex
  and downstream PKC γ, CaMKII, MAPK, and CREB signaling to alleviate CCI-induced
  neuropathic pain.
