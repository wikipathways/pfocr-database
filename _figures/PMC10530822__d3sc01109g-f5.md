caption: The proposed outcome for N-terminal acetylation of HMGB1. Circulating bacteria
  stimulate the JAK/STAT1 signalling pathway. Afterwards, HMGB1 undergoes hyper acetylation,
  leading to its secretion. In the extracellular environment, N-terminal region acetylation
  impairs the targeting efficiency of heparin towards HMGB1. On the other hand, acetylation
  of Lys6 promotes rapid degradation of HMGB1 by thrombin, resulting in cleaved HMGB1
  that fails to stimulate more severe inflammatory responses. BioRender was used to
  generate this figure.
