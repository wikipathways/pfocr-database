caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed T835M-UNC5C- and V642I-APP-induced
  neuronal death-signaling pathways. The UNC5C-induced death-signaling pathway is
  mediated by DAPK1, PKD, ASK1, JNK, NADPH oxidase, and caspases (–), and the APP-induced
  death-signaling pathway is mediated by Go, Rac1/Cdc42, ASK1, MAPKK, JNK, NADPH oxidase,
  and caspases (). The T835M mutation of UNC5C and a London-type mutation of APP,
  V642I, intensify each death signaling () (). CLSP binds to the heterotrimeric Humanin
  receptor and induces expression of SH3BP5, which inhibits the UNC5C- and APP-mediated
  death signaling by inhibiting JNK () (, , , ). Netrin1 binds to UNC5C and inhibits
  the UNC5C-induced death signaling (). Netrin1 binds to APP and partially inhibits
  the APP-induced death signaling and reduces the production of Aβ () ().
