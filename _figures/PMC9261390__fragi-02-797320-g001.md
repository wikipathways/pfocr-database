caption: Sphingolipid synthesis pathways. Sphingolipid biosynthesis pathways. (A)
  The De novo sphingolipid pathway occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where
  the condensation of serine and palmitoyl CoA by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)
  generates the backbone required for the synthesis of ceramide. Ceramide generated
  by the de novo pathway is then shuttled to the golgi apparatus (B) to be used as
  building blocks for the synthesis of sphingomyelin and other complex sphingolipids.
  (C) Exit from the sphingolipid synthesis pathways is initiated through S1P lyase
  where S1P cleavage results in hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine which is further
  metabolized into palmitoyl CoA. (D) Catabolism of sphingolipids occurs in the lysosome
  where complex sphingolipids is broken down into ceramide which then is ultimately
  deacylated to sphingosine by acid ceramidase. Sphingosine then exits the lysosome
  and is synthesized back into ceramide to be further used where needed.
