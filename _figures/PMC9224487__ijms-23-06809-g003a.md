caption: Differential expression of genes (fold change > 1.5 and p < 0.05) involved
  in glycolysis (A), hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (B), and fatty acid oxidation
  (C) in volume-overloaded rats in the heart failure (HF) phase and in volume-overloaded
  rats after correction of volume overload in the HF phase (HFCOV). The ovals in the
  maps represent enzymes in each metabolic pathway, with red and green denoting upregulation
  and downregulation of gene expression, respectively. n = 4 per group.
