caption: Proteins of acute-phase signalling at stage II compared with stage I in non-responders
  to autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). Several synovial fluid proteins that
  are downstream of acute-phase response signalling were differentially abundant between
  stages I and II of ACI. Proteins edged in purple, orange and blue were identified
  using isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) nano LC-MS/MS,
  label-free quantitation (LF) LC-MS/MS or both techniques, respectively. (Adapted
  from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.)
papertitle: Two independent proteomic approaches provide a comprehensive analysis
  of the synovial fluid proteome response to Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation.
