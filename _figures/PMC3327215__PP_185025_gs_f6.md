caption: Proteins identified in this study represent the four enzyme classes of the
  proposed algal Met-DMSP synthesis pathway (adapted from ; ) and active methyl cycle
  proteins that are important for regenerating the SAM methyl donor for the penultimate
  step in DMSP synthesis. Underlined proteins increased with hypersalinity-induced
  DMSP accumulation. Based on lack of de novo Met synthesis proteins, presence of
  chloroplast-targeting preseqences on potential DMSP pathway enzymes, coupled with
  decreases in FCPs, we propose FCPs provide MET/CYS precursors for chloroplast-localized
  DMSP synthesis to help protect photosynthetic machinery from osmotic and oxidative
  damage.
