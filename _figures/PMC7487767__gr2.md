caption: Illustration of resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies and effective
  combinatorial treatments. (A) The identified mechanisms of resistance to targeted
  inhibition of signaling through an oncogene ,  include the reactivation of the oncogene
  or of nodes that mediate its effect on a cancer phenotype, alterations that drive
  the same cancer phenotype through an overlapping or parallel pathway, or alterations
  that drive different cancer hallmark phenotypes. All of these resistance mechanisms
  can be mapped to relevant intra-cellular networks through systems biology methods.
  Panel B illustrates a network-based view of a cancer emergence, evolution and finally
  eradication trajectory. Cancer cells may develop adaptive (e.g. negative feedback-driven)
  or acquired resistance to a targeted treatment. Adaptive resistance may also aid
  the selection of certain alterations in the population of cancer cells. Dynamic
  modeling of the relevant intra-cellular networks can anticipate these resistance
  mechanisms and predict the most effective targeted therapy.
