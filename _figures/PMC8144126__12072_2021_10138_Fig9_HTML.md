caption: PNS modulated gut-liver axis in NAFLD via interference with LPS-induced TLR
  4 and AMPKα signalling pathway. PNS improved the gut intestinal barrier at multi-pathways
  including enhancement of intestinal tight junction permeability and inhibition of
  TLR-4 inflammatory response. These resulted in decreased translocation of microbial
  production (SCFAs) from gut to liver through the portal circulation. In addition
  to decreased levels of FFAs, the AMPKα signalling pathway was activated, and fatty
  acid oxidation was promoted by PPARα, CPT-1 and ACOX, as well as lipogenesis was
  reduced via ACC, FASS and SREBP-1C. PNS blocked LPS induced-CD14-TLR-4 activation
  in liver where inhibited the production of TNFα and IL-6, further improved hepatic
  fibrosis via α-SMA and Collagen I/IV
