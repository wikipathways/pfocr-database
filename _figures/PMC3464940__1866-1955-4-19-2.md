caption: Schematic illustration of cellular mechanisms of neurotransmission in the
  mesolimbic dopamine (DA) reward pathway. Shown is a synapse between a ventral tegmental
  area DA neuron axon terminal and a medium spiny neuron (MSN) in the nucleus accumbens
  (NAc) in the ventral striatum. Transmission begins with an action potential that
  arrives to the terminal, inducing synaptic vesicle fusion and release of DA. The
  release of DA into the NAc stimulates various populations of MSNs, whose response
  to the transmitter depends on the types of DA receptors they express. DA stimulation
  of neurons containing D1 or D5 receptors (so-called D1-like receptors) results in
  activation of heterotrimeric Golf/Gs proteins, which activate the enzyme adenylyl
  cyclase, resulting in the synthesis of the second messenger cAMP. In contrast to
  this mechanism, DA stimulation of MSNs that express D2, D3 or D4 (or D2-like receptors)
  activate sheterotrimeric Gi/Go proteins, which inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity
  to decrease cAMP. The level of intracellular cAMP controls the activation of protein
  kinase A, which regulates additional signaling molecules including dopamine- and
  cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) and the transcription
  factor cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein, both of which can modulate
  gene expression and additional cellular responses. The response to DA is generally
  terminated when DA is removed from the synapse by reuptake via the DA transporter
  (DAT). After reuptake, the transmitter can be repackaged into synaptic vesicles
  or may be degraded by the enzyme monoamine oxidase, resulting in the DA metabolite
  homovanillic acid. In addition, the enzyme catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) may
  also control DA levels by breaking down DA to 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), AC, adenylyl
  cyclase; ATP; adensosine triphosphate; cAMP; cyclic adenosine monophosphate; HVA,
  homovanillic acid; MAO, monoamine oxidase; VTA, ventral tegmental area.
