caption: Strategies for pharmacological manipulation of glucocorticoid activity. (A)
  Therapeutic manipulation of glucocorticoid generation and action. Synthesis of active
  glucocorticoids (predominantly cortisol in man and corticosterone in rodents) can
  be targeted by inhibiting key enzymes in the pathway. Action of glucocorticoids
  on corticosteroid receptors can be blocked using selective antagonists of glucocorticoid
  (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors. (B) Manipulation of glucocorticoid metabolism.
  Glucocorticoid generation in target tissues can be targeted using inhibitors of
  11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) which interconverts active steroid and
  its inert 11-keto metabolite. Clearance of glucocorticoids by 5α-reductase is also
  inhibited by compounds used to inhibit conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone.
