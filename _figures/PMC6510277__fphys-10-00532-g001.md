caption: The role of lipotoxicity in promoting insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
  Insulin upon binding to its receptor activates a signal transduction pathway culminating
  in the PDK1 and mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation and activation of AKT, which, by
  modulating its downstream effectors, promotes glucose uptake, glycolysis and glycogen
  synthesis in skeletal muscle. Diacylglycerol inhibits insulin signalling by activating
  protein kinase C θ (PKCθ) which phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate (IRS)
  on serine residues, thereby inhibiting it. Ceramide impedes insulin signalling via
  two separate mechanisms involving PKCζ-induced phosphorylation and protein phosphatase
  2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylating of AKT.
