caption: 'TSHR-mediated GPCR signal transduction pathways leading to TH synthesis
  and secretion and thyrocyte proliferation. Multiple feedforward motifs operate here.
  TSH activates TSHR leading to the dissociation of G proteins into Gα and Gβγ subunits.
  TSH can activate Gαs to stimulate the production of cAMP, which then activates PKA.
  PKA can sequentially activate PI3K, p70s6k and AKT, as well as Rap1, Ras, and MAPK.
  High-concentration TSH can activate Gαq/11 and Gαi/o. Gαq/11 can activate PLC to
  convert PIP2 into DAG and IP3, which activate PKC and PKC activates MAPK. Both Gαi/o
  and PLC inhibit the cAMP/PKA pathway, which can in turn inhibits PLC/PKC. Gα13 can
  activate the MAPK pathway, and Gβγ activates the PI3K/AKT pathway. MAPK and p70s6k
  can stimulate DNA synthesis and proliferation of thyrocytes. By regulating thyroid
  specific functional genes directly or through TTFs, PKA, AKT, PKC, and CREB regulate
  TH synthesis and secretion. Colors of molecule blocks are arbitrary. Solid lines:
  direct regulation, dotted lines: direct regulation not established, solid arrow
  heads: activation, blunted arrow heads: inhibition, dotted arrow heads: activation
  or inhibition, open arrow heads: mass flux, asterisk: phosphorylation. Unless otherwise
  specified, similar color scheme and denotations apply to all other figures.'
