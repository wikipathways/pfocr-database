caption: Functions and mechanisms of stem cells and exosomes in necrotizing enterocolitis
  (NEC). Stem cells and exosomes exert beneficial effects to NEC via various signaling
  pathways. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete cytokines and growth factors including
  interleukin (IL)-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hepatocyte growth
  factor (HGF). Downregulation of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) activates the nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling in MSCs, which increases the paracrine release of insulin-like
  growth factor (IGF)-1 and transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-β2). MSCs increase
  the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in stromal cells by the paracrine manner.
  Exosome (Exs) contains non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) beneficial to NEC injury. Milk-derived
  Exs increase goblet cell expression markers trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) and mucin 2
  (MUC2), as well as the expression of endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein glucose-regulated
  protein 94 (GRP94). Both MSCs and MSC-derived Exs can activate the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, which increases ISC viability and intestinal regeneration
