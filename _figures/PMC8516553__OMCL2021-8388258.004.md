caption: Transduction mechanism of the OS-mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
  in OC. Growth factors interact with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) leading to PI3K
  activation, which can be inhibited by PTP [, ]. Fully activated PI3K phosphorylates
  phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PIP3).
  This conversion results in the activation of AKT by phosphorylation of its kinase
  domain (Thr308) by PDK1 and phosphorylation of its C-terminal domain (Ser473) by
  PDK2. AKT can further activate mTOR, which includes mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and
  mTORC2. Activation of mTORC1 leads to cell survival, growth, and angiogenesis, while
  mTORC2 has been implicated in cytoskeleton formation and cell survival [, ]. PTEN
  reverses the effects of PI3K by dephosphorylating PIP3 []. ROS can inhibit the activity
  of PTP and PTEN by oxidizing cysteine residues, thus activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway [–] leading to the proliferation, migration, and chemotherapy resistance
  in OC.
