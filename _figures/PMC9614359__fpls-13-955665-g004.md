caption: A central role of AOX in the multifaceted and intertwined biological processes
  during floral thermogenesis of M. denudata. When an increase of AOX activity produces
  remarkable heat in the major themogenic tissue gynoecium, the flower enters the
  TM stage. Meanwhile, the increased activity of AOX respiration pathway leads to
  a higher flux rate of the TCA cycle, which supplies more citrate to floral VOC biosynthesis.
  Due to the heat produced by AOX activity and a change in the cell wall property,
  including a decrease in lignin content, floral VOCs get emitted from the gynocecium
  cells to the air. There is a structural change in the cells during thermogenesis,
  which results in more intercellular space and promotes VOC release. Thus, the AOX
  plays a central role in coupling heat production and floral odor production and
  emission in thermogenic plants.
