caption: Signaling pathways associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Although many pathways
  are associated with cardiomyopathy, up-regulation of transcription and induction
  of apoptosis are major mediators of pathogenic responses in the heart. The GPCR-associated
  pathway (dark red) can be activated by ET-1 and AngII, which are released in response
  to reduced contractility, and mediates contractile adaptation through increased
  calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Increased intracellular calcium
  activates calmodulin and induces activation of the transcription factor MEF2. Incorporation
  into the sarcomere of mutant proteins that exhibit reduced ATP efficiency inhibits
  the sequestration of calcium from the cytosol and further enhances increases in
  intracellular calcium concentration. GPCR signaling is also associated with activation
  of the Akt signaling pathway (light green) that induces fetal gene expression and
  the cardiac hypertrophic response through inhibition of GSK3β. Apoptotic pathways
  (light blue) are induced by cytochrome c (CytC) release from mitochondria and activation
  of death receptors (like FasR) by cytokines such as TNF. Calcium overload and myocyte
  loss significantly contribute to reduced contractility in many forms of cardiomyopathy.

  description: Signaling pathways associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Although many

    The GPCR-associated pathway (dark red) can be activated by ET-1 and AngII, which
    are released in response to reduced contractility, and mediates contractile adaptation
    through increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Increased intracellular

    enhances increases in intracellular calcium concentration. GPCR signaling is also
    associated with activation of the Akt signaling pathway (light green) that induces
