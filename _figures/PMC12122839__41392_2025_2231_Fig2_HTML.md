caption: Generation and metabolism of sulfur-containing biomolecules. The metabolism
  of methionine begins with its breakdown by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT),
  producing S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Subsequently, SAM is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH) through the action of methyltransferase (MT). SAH is then hydrolyzed by adenosylhomocysteinase
  (AHCY) to homocysteine (Hcy). Hcy can enter the transsulfuration pathway or be recycled
  back into methionine via the methionine synthase (MS) pathway or the betaine-homocysteine
  S-methyltransferase (BHMT), completing the methionine cycle. Within the MS pathway,
  Hcy also participates in the folate cycle. Additionally, SAM can contribute to methionine
  salvage pathways via MAT to replenish methionine levels. In the transsulfuration
  pathway, Hcy can be converted to cysteine (Cys) via cystathionine β-synthase (CBS)
  and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), leading to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production. Hcy
  can also be directly converted to H2S by CSE. Furthermore, Cys and cystine can interchange
  with each other. D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), located in peroxisomes, can utilize
  D-cysteine (D-Cys) as a substrate to produce 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP), which can
  then be converted to H2S by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). The metabolism
  of H2S in the body can occur through simple gas exhalation, as well as via oxidation
  (which occurs in the mitochondria), methylation, and clearance by methemoglobin.
