caption: Mechanisms of self-sacrifice in neutrophils. Pyroptosis mainly relies on
  inflammasome to activate caspase family, caspase family could cleave and activate
  gasdermin protein, which is transferred to the membrane to form holes and thus leads
  to cell membrane rupture. NETs components DNA and histones can act as DAMPs molecules
  to directly initiate or amplify inflammatory responses. NETosis induced by LPS in
  neutrophils can elicit caspase-11 and GSDMD-dependent histone H3 citrullination.
  NETosis is a multi-step process involving the destruction of neutrophil nuclear
  and cytoplasmic granular membranes, chromatin relaxation, chromatin interaction
  with granular proteins, and chromatin release from the cells. A variety of stimulants,
  such as PMA, microflora, LPS, eubacteria, activated blood plates, IL-8 and immune
  complexes, can induce the formation of NETs through the PKC signaling pathway. Autophagy
  is a process enveloping bacteria and viruses escaped from the phagosomes or damaged
  mitochondria into vesicles, fusing with lysosomes to form autophagosomes and degrading
  their encapsulated contents. Neutrophil autophagy could subsequently activate NETs.
  NETs, neutrophil extracellular traps; DAMPs, damage‐associated molecular patterns;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GSDMD, gasdermin D; PMA, phosphor myristate; IL, interleukin;
  PKC, protein kinase C.
