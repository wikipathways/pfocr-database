caption: 'Diagram of the main intracellular signaling pathways triggered by agonist
  binding to somatostatin (SRIF) receptors to exert anti-secretory and anti-proliferative
  effects. (A) Anti-secretory activity of SRIF is regulated by: i) the inhibition
  of adenylyl cyclase (AC), lowering cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels;
  ii) the inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels; and iii) the activation of
  outward K+ channels, leading to cell membrane hyperpolarization. (B) Anti-proliferative
  effects of SRIF are mediated by the activation of the protein tyrosine phosphatases
  Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 and 2 (SHP-1 and
  SHP-2) and the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ). SHP-1 triggers
  intracellular pro-apoptotic signals involving the induction of p53 and Bax, while
  SHP-2 activates the tyrosine kinase Src that induces the phosphorylation of PTPη,
  which, in turn, dephosphorylates PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2, impairing cell proliferation.
