caption: Screen shot of the user interfaceofSimmune2.0. The image shows how the software
  keeps track of the investigator’s entries of molecules and complexes (far left)
  and provides a dynamic graphical view of the pathway being input with precise definition
  of the sites of interaction for molecules with multiple interaction sites (center
  panel). Linked windows that are called up by highlighting specific entries in this
  window allow the user to input parameters for the molecules and complexes, such
  as numbers of molecules, kinetic constants, and so on.
