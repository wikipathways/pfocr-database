caption: 'Polysaccharides modulate Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty
  acids (SCFAs) related signaling pathways in intestines. Polysaccharide intervention
  attenuates the activation of the TLR4-NF-κB-tight junction protein signaling pathway
  located on the surface of epithelial cells, reducing the presence of LPS-producing
  bacteria within the intestines, decreasing LPS levels and reducing the entry of
  LPS into the bloodstream by reinforcing TJs. Polysaccharide intervention increases
  the production of SCFAs to activate GPR41 and GPR43 receptors, which further stimulate
  the release of GLP-1 and PYY by intestinal L cells, meanwhile, it could also bolster
  TJs and fortify the integrity of the intestinal barrier through AMPK-related signaling
  pathways, enhancing the population of Tregs while reducing B cells, macrophages
  and dendritic cells to reduce proinflammatory factors into the bloodstream. All
