caption: 'Effect of A. phagocytophilum infection on apoptosis pathways in tick cells.
  (A) In I. ricinus IRE/CTVM20 cells, A. phagocytophilum inhibits apoptosis through
  up-regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway and up-regulation of FAS coding genes in the
  extrinsic pathway; (B) A. phagocytophilum inhibits apoptosis in I. scapularis ISE6
  cells by down-regulation of the the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, modulation of protein
  processing in the ER and glucose metabolism. Down-regulation of α-fodrin and Neogenin
  has also been observed in ISE6 cells. Up-regulated in green, down-regulated in red.
  ASK1: apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; MKK: mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  SOCS: suppressor of cytokine signalling.'
