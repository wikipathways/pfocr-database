caption: An overview of the innate response to Ad vectors. (A) Upon Ad infection,
  the genomic DNA of Ad can serve as a PAMP, leading to the activation of TLR2 and
  TLR9. TLRs subsequently trigger the activation of NF-κB and IRF7. This cascade of
  activation culminates in the regulation of the production of IFN-I and ISGs [].
  (B) DsDNA within the Ad genome propels the engagement of the cGAS-STING signaling
  pathway [].
