caption: Important steps in cholesterol synthesis and homeostasis. Cholesterol synthesis
  occurs via the mevalonate pathway and involves over 20 enzymes. It starts from acetyl-CoA
  in the cytosol, but all steps downstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A (HMG-CoA) occur in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Lanosterol, the first sterol,
  feeds either into the Bloch pathway or the Kandutsch–Russell pathway. In these pathways,
  cholesterol is produced from either desmosterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC),
  by the enzymes 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) and 7-dehydrocholesterol
  reductase (DHCR7), respectively. Gene mutations of the enzyme DHCR7 result in Smith-Lemli-Opitz
  syndrome, SLOS, with increased levels of cholesterol precursors and reduced levels
  of cholesterol. In the skin, 7-DHC can be converted to vitamin D by UVB light. Diverse
  oxysterols are produced enzymatically from cholesterol, its precursors but also
  during subsequent steroid hormone synthesis. The rate limiting step in cholesterol
  synthesis is catalyzed by 3 HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). Cellular homeostasis of cholesterol
  is maintained by three distinct mechanisms (red arrows). (1) Regulation of HMGR
  activity and levels to control cholesterol biosynthesis occurs by feed-back inhibition,
  control of gene expression, rate of enzyme degradation, and phosphorylation–dephosphorylation.
  For example, the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein
  2 (SREBP2) positively regulates the gene expression of HMGR. Rising cholesterol
  and oxysterol levels reduce the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis by modulating the
  activities of insulin-induced gene (INSIG) proteins. When activated, INSIG both
  promotes the ubiquitination and consequent destabilization of HMGR and inhibits
  the transcriptional activity of SREBP2 by retaining it in complex with SREBP cleavage-activating
  protein (SCAP) in the endoplasmic reticulum. (2) Rising cholesterol levels also
  activate acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which esterifies cholesterol
  leading to its sequestration in cytosolic lipid droplets. Through hydrolysis via
  the cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) enzyme system, the cholesteryl esters can
  be reused later. (3) Regulation of cholesterol uptake and export via low-density
  lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor-mediated uptake and high-density lipoprotein HDL-mediated
  reverse transport, respectively. Oxysterols activate liver-X receptor (LXR) transcription
  factors, which positively regulate the transcription of proteins that drive cholesterol
  efflux from the cell (ABC transporter, ABCA1 and ABCG1), and sequester it in lipoprotein
  particles containing Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in the circulatory system. Activation
  of oxysterol binding protein-related proteins (ORP) by oxysterols negatively regulates
  cholesterol efflux by promoting ABCA1 ubiquitination and degradation. Following
  binding of lipoprotein particles (LDL and HDL) to their respective receptors [LDLR,
  Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1)], they are internalized into endosomes.
  Alternatively, HDL particles can transfer cholesteryl esters to the plasma membrane
  (selective lipid uptake) without requirement for endocytosis. Within endosomes,
  Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and NPC2 are critical for the egress of internalized cholesterol
  from endosomes; they act together to redistribute cholesterol to the ER. Statins
  are HMGR inhibitors. The net result of statin treatment is an increased cellular
  uptake of LDLs, since the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol is inhibited and
  cells are therefore dependent on extracellular sources of cholesterol.
