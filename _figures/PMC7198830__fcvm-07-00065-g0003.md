caption: Effects of HDL on DOX-induced cytotoxicity of cardiomyocytes. HDL binds to
  SR-B1 leading to activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (). In addition, HDL is able
  to activate ERK1/2-JAK-STAT3 signaling via a pathway involving HDL mediated delivery
  of the bioactive lipid, S1P acting via the S1P2 receptor (). Together these pathways
  prevent DOX-induced apoptosis and atrophy.
