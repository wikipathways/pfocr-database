caption: Summary of the main differences between NE high and low subtypes of SCLC.
  The NE high subtype usually has classic SCLC morphology, a high NE cell score with
  high expression of ASCL1 and most or all NE markers, expression of NKX2-1, the Notch
  inhibitors DLL3 and DLK1, and an epithelial phenotype. NEUROD1 expression is more
  variable. By contrast, the low NE phenotype has low or absent expression of ASCL1
  and NEUROD1 (“dual low”), low or absent expression of NE cell markers, activation
  of Notch, HIPPO and TGFβ pathway genes and profound epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT)
  transition resulting in a mesenchymal phenotype. REST, an inhibitor of NE differentiation,
  is expressed while MYC is often over-expressed. Some but not all dual negative cases
  express ASCL2, possibly acting as an alternative driver transcription factor. Many
  dual negative tumor cells exhibit the variant form of SCLC. NE, neuroendocrine;
  SCLC, small cell lung cancer.
