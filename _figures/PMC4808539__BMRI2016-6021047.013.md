caption: Predicted analysis of the mechanism by which the photosynthesis rate is reduced.
  (a) In normal condition, RuBisCO activase removes the RuBP from RuBisCO and photosynthesis
  is not affected. (b) During drought stress, RuBisCO activase and ATP-dependent zinc
  metalloprotease are downregulated and CA1P (2-carboxyarabinitol 1 phosphate, a potent
  inhibitor of RuBisCO) is upregulated; thus no removal of RuBP from RuBisCO occurs,
  and with that the Calvin cycle and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) enzymes are downregulated
  which ultimately results in reduced level photosynthesis and retarded growth.
