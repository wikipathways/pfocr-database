caption: Deeply characterized cellular processes affected by miRNAs in MB. The brain-enriched
  miR-124a and miR-218a participate in cell cycle control by modulating the expression
  of CDK6, the cyclin-dependent kinase 6 crucially implicated in cell cycle progression.
  MiR-125b, miR-326, miR-324-5p, and MiR-17/92 cluster is included in the regulatory
  axis between the SHH and the BMP signaling, participating in the cell choice between
  proliferation and differentiation. MiR-125b, miR-326, and miR-324-5p guide the SHH
  pathway, modulating Smo and Gli1, respectively activator and effector of the cascade.
  MiR-199-5p is involved in CSC maintenance by modulating the CSC marker CD15 and
  Hes1, the main Notch downstream effector with which a negative regulative feedback
  loop is established. Notch signaling is also controlled by miR-34a, at the level
  of the ligand Dll1. The retinal miR-183 is part of the regulative axis between mTOR
  pathway, from which it is activated, and AKT pathway involved in cell migration.
