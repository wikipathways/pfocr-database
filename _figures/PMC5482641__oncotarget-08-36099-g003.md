caption: Gene networks for COL4A1 (top) and COL13A1 (bottom) and several of their
  interaction partners were generated through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Black
  arrowheads indicate COL4A1 and COL13A1. Colored nodes are shaded by their relative
  expression (green with low expression and red with higher expression), with color
  intensity indicating relative expression. The shape of the node indicates the major
  function of the protein. Lines denote biding of the products of the two genes, while
  a line with an arrow denotes that one protein acts on another. A dotted line denotes
  an indirect relationship, and a solid line denotes a direct relationship.
