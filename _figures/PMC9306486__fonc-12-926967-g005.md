caption: Schematic view of NTRK signaling. Ligands (NGF in squares, BDNF in triangles,
  and NF3 in circles) and their respective receptors (TRK1/2/3) are represented. The
  main neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) fusion products (TRK-BCL1 and
  TRK-EV6) are represented as ellipticals as they do not need any ligand to be active.
  All the receptors trigger the MAPK pathway, leading to the indicated consequences.
  Two drugs, entrectinib and larotrectinib, can inhibit the NTRK aberrant forms as
  shown.
