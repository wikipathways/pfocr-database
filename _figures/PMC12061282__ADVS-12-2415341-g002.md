caption: Schematic depicting the mechanisms by which miR‐31‐5p regulates M1/M2 balance
  in autoimmune dry eye. The upregulation of FTO in autoimmune dry eye suppresses
  the recognition of pri‐miR‐31 by DGCR8, thereby inhibiting the maturation of miR‐31‐5p
  and reducing its inhibitory effect on the target gene P2RX7. The activation of P2RX7
  subsequently triggers the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and increases the level of
  M1‐related genes, thus exacerbating the development of autoimmune dry eye. Conversely,
  overexpression of miR‐31‐5p converts M1 macrophages into an M2 phenotype, which
  secretes anti‐inflammatory mediators and alleviates the symptoms of autoimmune dry
  eye
