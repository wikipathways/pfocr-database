caption: Inhibition of YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators by LATS1/2. (A) When Hippo
  signaling is off, YAP/TAZ enters the nucleus, competes with VGLL4 for TEADs, and
  recruits other factors to induce gene transcription. YAP/TAZ may bind proximal promoters
  or distal enhancers of target genes to induce transcription. (B) When Hippo signaling
  is on, YAP/TAZ is phosphorylated by LATS1/2 on multiple sites, resulting interaction
  with 14-3-3 and cytoplasmic retention; phosphorylation also leads to YAP/TAZ poly-ubiquitination
  and degradation. VGLL4 interacts with TEADs and represses target gene transcription.
