caption: LPS shows significant toxicity in renal tubules, which is attenuated by OPC.
  LPS inhibits the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT, which causes the activation of downstream
  apoptosis-related signaling molecules and accelerates cell death. It also stimulates
  the NFκB signaling pathway, increases the production of inflammatory cytokines,
  and aggravates the inflammatory response. OPC reverses these alterations. Additionally,
  OPC mitigates LPS-induced oxidative stress injury by recovering SOD activity, CTA
  activity, GSH content, and inhibiting the overproduction of MDA. OPC, oligomeric
  proanthocyanidin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; GSH, glutathione;
  SOD, superoxide dismutase; CTA, catalase; MDA, malondialdehyde; TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor-alpha; IL-1β, interleukin-1 beta; IL-6, interleukin-6; IL-10, interleukin-10;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species
