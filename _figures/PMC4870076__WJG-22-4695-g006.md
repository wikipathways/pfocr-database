caption: Potential mechanism underlying Qinggan Huoxue Recipe-mediated inhibition
  of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in alcoholic liver fibrosis rats. TGF-β1
  stimulates responsive cells through binding and activating the transmembrane receptors
  TGF-β type I (TGF-βR-I) and type II (TGF-βR-II). Receptor ternary complexes phosphorylate
  and activate Smad2/3. Once activated, Smad2/3 forms heterocomplexes with Smad4,
  and these translocate to the nucleus and activate TGF-β1 signaling. Snail, a gene
  associated with the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, inhibits E-cadherin expression,
  increases vimentin and fibronectin levels, promotes EMT and decreases the levels
  of occludin, ZO-1 and claudin. QGR, HXR and QGHXR suppressed the effects of ALF-induced
  modulation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway and ameliorated EMT-induced alcoholic
  fibrosis. QGR, HXR and QGHXR affected molecules associated with the TGF-β/Smad signaling
  pathway in the same manner. However, QGR and HXR exerted no significant changes
  in vimentin mRNA expression, QGR exerted no significant changes in fibronectin mRNA
  expression, and HXR exerted no significant changes in Snail and TGF-β1 mRNA expression.
