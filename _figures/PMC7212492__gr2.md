caption: Classical mechanisms of androgen signaling in a target cell. In circulation,
  testosterone is bound to the serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Testosterone
  dissociates from its binding carrier protein and diffuses freely through the cell
  membrane. Once in the cytoplasm, testosterone can be converted to its active metabolite
  5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Testosterone or DHT can directly bind to the androgen
  receptor (AR) leading to the dissociation of heat shock proteins (hsp) from the
  inactive receptor. The ligand-bound receptor then exerts its effects by rapid nongenomic
  effects by modulating the activity of the Src/Raf-1/Erk-2 pathway or the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, or by genomic mechanisms involving the activated AR
  translocation into the nucleus. In the nucleus the androgen receptor binds as homodimer
  to specific DNA elements present as enhancers in upstream promoter sequences of
  androgen target genes. Upon AR binding, coactivators are recruited and the basal
  transcription machinery (BTM) (e.g. RNA-polymerase II [RNA-Pol II], TATA box binding
  protein [TBP], TBP associating factors [TAF's], general transcription factors [GTF's])
  is activated. The interactions between AR, coactivators and the BTM results in gene
  transcription.
