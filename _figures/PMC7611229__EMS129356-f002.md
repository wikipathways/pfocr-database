caption: A) Schematic cross section of Drosophila brain with the known circadian clock
  neurons and clock machinery. Clock neuron subsets are named based on their anatomical
  location in the brain. Small ventrolateral neurons (s-LNvs, blue), large ventrolateral
  neurons (l-LNvs, yellow), dorsolateral neurons (LNds, red), lateral posterior neuron
  (LPN- green), and dorsal neurons (DN1- orange, DN2-blue open circle, DN3-black).
  Core clock proteins, such as PER, TIM, and CLK, are expressed rhythmically in the
  clock neurons. Peripheral metabolic clocks present in the fat body, muscle, and
  gut regulate various physiological processes, including metabolism. SIFamide (SIFa)
  expressed in neuronal subsets of the pars intercerebralis (PI) drives the feeding
  rhythm. Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs) produced by insulin producing cells
  (IPC) in the PI regulates the rhythmic expression of metabolic transcripts in the
  fat body. While the central and peripheral circadian clocks regulate various metabolic
  pathways, food and energy status send feedback signals into the clock. Square brackets
  collectively represent all the metabolic peripheral clocks. Solid and dashed arrows
  represent known and putative pathways involved in this cross talk. B) A schematic
  cross section of an adult mammalian brain. In mammals, the central clock suprachiasmatic
  nucleus (SCN) is located at the base of the hypothalamus. Core clock proteins PER,
  CRY, and BMAL1 are rhythmically expressed in the SCN. Light input is conveyed to
  the SCN through intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Neural
  and endocrine signaling from the central clock and the peripheral clocks in metabolic
  tissues, such as liver, pancreas, adipose tissue, stomach, and gut, regulate glucose,
  lipid metabolism, and nutrient absorption in a rhythmic manner. Stomach oxyntic
  cells produce the hunger hormone ghrelin that stimulates food intake. However, leptin
  hormone secreted by adipocytes and insulin from pancreas suppress food intake. Nutrient
  status sends feedback signals to the central and peripheral clocks. A high fat diet
  alters the phase of the adiponectin signaling pathway components in the liver, and
  the food intake pattern can alter the microbiota rhythmicity in the gut. SIRT1 transduces
  the signal back to the circadian clock, and AMPK phosphorylates the core clock components.
  Square brackets collectively represent all the metabolic peripheral clocks, and
  blunt end lines represent inhibitory effects. Solid and dashed arrows represent
  known and putative pathways, respectively, involved in the interaction between clock
  and metabolism.
