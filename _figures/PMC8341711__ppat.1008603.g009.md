caption: DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) induces MMP-9 expression through activating
  the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Additionally, NS1 interacts with
  MMP-9 and facilitates the enzyme to alter the adhesion and tight junctions and vascular
  leakage in human endothelial cells and mice tissues. Moreover, NS1 recruits MMP-9
  to interact with β-catenin and Zona occludens protein-1/2 to degrade the important
  adhesion and tight junction proteins, thereby inducing endothelial hyperpermeability
  and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mice tissues.
