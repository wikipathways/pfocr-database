caption: The main CSCs signaling pathways regulation by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic
  deregulation of CSC-related signaling pathways enables cancer cells to obtain self-renewal
  properties and drug resistance characteristics. Hedgehog signaling pathway can be
  activated by Shh promoter hypomethylation and enhance HDAC1 expression. Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling can be strengthened by reduced DKK1 inhibitor expression of it via promoter
  hypermethylation and enhanced H3K27me3 and reduced acetylation at H3K16. Notch signaling
  focus on genes including Hes1 and Hes5 which can be active by STRAP at their promoter
  region

  description: The main CSCs signaling pathways regulation by epigenetic mechanisms.
    Epigenetic deregulation of CSC-related signaling pathways enables cancer cells
    to obtain self-renewal properties and drug resistance characteristics. Hedgehog
    signaling pathway can be activated by Shh promoter hypomethylation and enhance
    HDAC1 expression. Wnt/β-catenin signaling can be strengthened by reduced DKK1
    inhibitor expression of it via promoter hypermethylation and enhanced H3K27me3
    and reduced acetylation at H3K16. Notch signaling focus on genes including Hes1
    and Hes5 which can be active by STRAP at their promoter region
