caption: APP processing procedure and cleavage products. The non-amyloidogenic APP
  processing pathway (right) involves proteolytic cleavages by α- and γ-secretases
  resulting in the generation of sAPPα and carboxyl terminal fragments including P3,
  CTF83 and AICD. The alternative amyloidogenic APP processing pathway (left) involves
  proteolytic cleavages by β- and γ-secretases resulting in the generation of sAPPβ
  and carboxyl terminal fragments including Aβ, CTF99 and and AICD. Aβ peptides could
  oligomerize and fibrillize leading to AD pathology. sAPPα could function to promote
  neurogenesis and survival, while AICD could have effects to inhibit neurogenesis
  possibly via forming complex with Fe65 and leading to transcriptional regulation.
