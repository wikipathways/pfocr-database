caption: ACE pathway and role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the inflammatory
  Response. The lung loses ACE2-mediated protection following endocytosis of the enzyme
  with SARS-CoV-2 virus, as it enters cells in the lung and other organs [A]. The
  angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE enzyme cleaves Angiotensin I (Ang 1), generating
  Angiotensin 11 (Ang 11), which acts though the angiotensin 11 receptor (AT1R), to
  increase vasoconstriction, increase blood pressure and promote inflammation [B].
  In the counter-regulatory pathway, ACE2, hydrolyses Ang 11 into heptapeptide angiotensin
  Ang (1–7), that acts through the ACE2/Ang1–7/MAS/G receptor pathway to downgrade
  the constrictive proliferative effect of Ang 11, and induce vasodilation, and reduce
  inflammation and fibrosis [C]. The ACE2 gene influences the renin angiotensin system
  (RAS) function by modulating blood pressure, sodium and fluid balance and may thereby
  be important in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular and renal disease. ACE2, Angiotensin
  converting enzyme 2; AT1R, Angiotensin 1 Receptor; ACEi, Angiotensin converting
  enzyme inhibitors; ARBs, Angiotensin converting enzyme receptor blockers; MAS/G
  receptor, Mas-related g protein-coupled receptor.
