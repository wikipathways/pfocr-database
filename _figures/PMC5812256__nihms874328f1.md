caption: BAs are produced from cholesterol, enter bile canaliculi via BSEP and MRP2,
  empty into the duodenum upon stimulation of the gallbladder with CCK, get mostly
  reabsorbed in the terminal ileum via ASBT, then shuttled into the portal vein via
  OSTα/β where they are recycled back to the hepatocyte. Gut microbiota deconjugate
  BAs into LCA and DCA. LCA is insoluble and excreted in feces but DCA can be reabsorbed
  into the portal vein and recycled. BAs act on FXR in the liver to induce SHP to
  downregulate gene expression of CYP7A1/Cyp7a1 and CYP8A1/Cyp8b1. BAs also downregulate
  their own synthesis via a SHP-independent pathway involving FGF15 (FGF19 in humans)
  produced in the ileum. FGF15 leads to phosphorylation of FGFR4, which then activates
  ERK1/2 pathways to downregulate gene expression of CYP7A1/Cyp7a1 and CYP8B1/Cyp8b1.
  FGFR4 requires a cofactor, βklotho, to function. Green arrows indicate upregulation
  or stimulation. Red lines indicate downregulation. Broken arrows indicate that multiple
  steps are involved but not depicted.
