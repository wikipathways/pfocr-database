caption: GEFT function and signalling pathway. GEFT comprises the Dbl and pleckstrin
  homology domains and regulates cytoskeleton and cellular processes. GEFT has specific
  exchange activity for Rac, Cdc42 and GST-PAK. GEFT selectively couples with Gαq/11
  to activate RhoA in blood vessels and cultured cells; it also mediates Ca2+ sensitization
  of the force induced with Gαq/11-coupled agonists. GEFT activates the Rac1/Cdc42
  signalling pathway and promotes the tumourigenicity and metastasis of RMS by influencing
  the expression of EMT-related proteins of RMS cells.
