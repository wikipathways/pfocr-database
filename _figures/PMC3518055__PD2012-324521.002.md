caption: 'Possible mechanisms by which LRRK2 may regulate events related to endolysosomal
  and autophagic function. Modulation of rab5 function could cause changes in endocytosis
  and/or autophagosome formation. Altered endocytosis could also modulate signalling
  events occurring at the plasma membrane or on intracellular organelles, thereby,
  indirectly impacting upon autophagy through phosphorylation events of distinct proteins
  required for the process. At later stages, through modulating rab7 function, LRRK2
  may alter the fusion of autophagosomes/endosomes with lysosomes or impair lysosome
  reformation, which would impact upon autophagic-lysosomal clearance in both cases.
  As most of the abovementioned membrane fusion/reformation steps require intraluminal
  calcium, LRRK2 may further regulate endolysosomal clearance by modulating NAADP-sensitive
  calcium channels (NAADP-R) located on endosomes and lysosomes. The increasing intraluminal
  calcium concentrations along the endocytic/lysosomal pathway are indicated by the
  progressively darkened blue color. Ligand binding to receptors, followed by endocytosis
  and interaction with signalling complexes are schematically indicated. EE: early
  endosome; AV: autophagosome; LE/MVB: late endosome/multivesicular body; LYS: lysosome.
