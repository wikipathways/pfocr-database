caption: ROS signaling pathways involved in wound healing and metastasis. Extracellular
  ROS activate intracellular signaling pathways. ① Nrf2 pathway. In unstressed conditions,
  Keap1 retains Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. When ROS are produced, Keap1 is oxidized and
  ubiquitinated thereby leading to its proteasomal degradation. Consequently, Nrf2
  is free to translocate to the nucleus and binds to the anti-oxidant response elements
  (AREs). This binding inhibits NOX2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines transcription
  and enhances the anti-oxidant defense response expression. ② NF-κB pathway. In normal
  conditions, NF-κB is associated with IκB and retained in the cytoplasm. In the presence
  of ROS, IKK is activated and can phosphorylate IκB to induce its dissociation with
  NF-κB and its proteasomal degradation. Then, free NF-κB translocates to the nucleus,
  binds to NF-κB Response Elements (NREs) and induces target genes transcription leading
  to a global inflammatory response. ROS are able to directly act in the nucleus inhibiting
  NF-κB binding to the NREs. ③ HIF pathway. In homeostatic conditions, HIF-1α is hydroxylated
  by PHDs and targeted for proteasomal degradation. HIF-1α is also regulated by FIH,
  which blocks the interaction between HIF-1α transactivation domain and coactivators
  on HREs. During hypoxia or when ROS are produced, PHDs are inactivated which stabilizes
  HIF-1α and FIH is inhibited. HIF-1α then translocates into the nucleus where it
  binds to HIF Response Elements (HREs). Transcription of target genes is induced
  leading to hypoxic and angiogenic response. Nrf2, NF-κB and HIF pathways are closely
  interlinked. Nrf2 can inhibit IκB proteasomal degradation and NF-κB nuclear translocation,
  NF-κB pathway induces anti-oxidant response regulating iNOS and COX-2 transcription
  and HIF-1α expression is regulated by NF-κB.

  description: ROS signaling pathways involved in wound healing and metastasis. Extracellular
    ROS activate intracellular signaling pathways. ① Nrf2 pathway. In unstressed conditions,
    Keap1 retains Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. When ROS are produced, Keap1 is oxidized

    normal conditions, NF-κB is associated with IκB and retained in the cytoplasm.
    In the presence of ROS, IKK is activated and can phosphorylate IκB to induce its
    dissociation with NF-κB and its proteasomal degradation. Then, free NF-κB translocates

    of target genes is induced leading to hypoxic and angiogenic response. Nrf2, NF-κB
    and HIF pathways are closely interlinked. Nrf2 can inhibit IκB proteasomal degradation
    and NF-κB nuclear translocation, NF-κB pathway induces anti-oxidant response regulating
    iNOS and COX-2 transcription and HIF-1α expression is regulated by NF-κB.
