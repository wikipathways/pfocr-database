caption: Aβ inhibits binding of Wnt ligand to the frizzled receptor and promotes β-catenin
  degradation. The figure illustrates that the quiescent radial glial cells (q-RGL)
  can be activated (a-RGL) which can give rise to newborn neurons through the generation
  of neuroblasts in the hippocampus of the normal brain responsible for learning and
  memory. In AD, the pathogenic Aβ plaques and their toxicity suppress the neurogenic
  process leading to dementia. The enlarged view represents the Aβ mediated proposed
  pathomechanism in a neuronal cell during AD at different levels. 1) Aβ antagonizes
  the Wnt signaling by binding to LRP5/6 and Frizzled receptors in the cell surface
  of the neurons, 2) Aβ deactivates Dvl, which in turn facilitates β-catenin degradation
  in the cytoplasm, 3) simultaneously, Aβ promotes the generation of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), driving the cell toward apoptosis via p53 expression, and 4) Further,
  Aβ promotes phosphorylating of GSK3β and degrades β-catenin.
