caption: Bacterial degradation of trimethylamine (TMA) for trimethylamine N-oxide
  (TMAO) formation. TMA is generated when the gut microbiota metabolize dietary carnitine,
  choline and choline-containing compounds. After gut absorption, at the hepatic level,
  TMA undergoes conversion into TMAO through flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO)
  isoforms 1 and 3. Then, TMAO enters the systemic circulation. During obesity, plasma
  TMAO levels are elevated. TMAO is associated with adipose tissue and endothelial
  inflammation, along with insulin resistance. The intracellular signaling pathway
  initiated by TMAO involves protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERPK),
  leading to a pro-inflammatory status
