caption: Model for ethylene regulation of cell proliferation at the root meristem.
  Ethylene negatively regulates cell proliferation through action of the ethylene
  receptors, which feed into two pathways. The primary regulatory pathway (thick arrows)
  involves CTR1, EIN2, and the EIN3/EIL transcription factor family. CTR1 is related
  to the Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (Raf) protein kinases, and EIN2 is related
  to the Natural Resistance Associated Microphage Protein (Nramp) metal transporters.
  A secondary pathway (thin arrows) makes use of a two-component signaling pathway
  involving ARR1, a type B ARR transcription factor.
