caption: The physiological role of ACE and ACE2 in the RAS pathway. During hypotension,
  the juxtaglomerular cells of the renal system releases renin into the blood that
  circulates into the body. Renin subsequently breaks down Angiotensinogen to Ang
  I. The Ang I, with the help of ACE is further converted to Ang II, which leads to
  elevated blood pressure, vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion and downstream
  pathophysiological effects through AT1R pathway. Alternatively, these effects would
  be inhibited if Ang II mediates its effects through AT2R pathway (resulting in vasodilatory
  effect). The Ang II is further broken down to Ang 1-7 by ACE2 that elicits antagonistic
  effect to Ang II as Ang 1-7 that binds with Mas receptor (MasR) resulting in anti-inflammatory,
  antiproliferative, and vasodilatory effects. ADAM17 is known to be responsible for
  shedding membrane anchored proteins, thus releasing soluble ACE2
