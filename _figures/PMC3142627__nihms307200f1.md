caption: Panel (A) depicts the pathogenic steps that bacteria must undergo to gain
  access to and persist within the circulatory system, with pathogen interaction with
  the host innate and adaptive immune system highlighted. Bacteria often initiate
  the infection process through colonization of the mucosal surface of the intestine,
  respiratory tract, or urogenital tract (1), after which, bacteria can traverse the
  epithelial barrier transcellularly, paracellularly, or as intracellular passengers
  within granulocytes and mononuclear cells (2). Bacteria must then survive in connective
  tissues (3), cross the endothelial-blood barrier (4), and survive and persist in
  the circulatory system (5). Bacterial pathogens have evolved multiple mechanisms
  to avoid clearance by professional phagocytes, like neutrophils and macrophages,
  by synthesizing the immunosuppressant nucleoside adenosine, assembling sialic acid
  or haluronic acid capsules to inhibit phagocytosis and dampen the immune response,
  limiting deposition of complement factor C3b, and coating themselves with incorrectly-oriented
  IgG antibody to limit opsonophagocytosis. Bacteria have evolved mechanisms to survive
  within the systemic circulation by scavaging metals, eg. iron, with high-affinity
  molecules called siderophores. Finally, bacterial pathogens can exit the circulatory
  system, causing end-organ dissemination and/or failure (6). Panel (B) illustrates
  host mechanisms employed to contain infection, including phagocytosis and innate
  pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognition through the Toll-like receptors
  (TLR) and intracellular nucleotide oligomerization domain/caspase recruitment domain
  (NOD/CARD) proteins, such as Nod1/2. Phagocytosis and lysosomal fusion are typically
  part of a unified pathway to clear pathogens, but bacteria have evolved countermeasures
  to avoid being killed. Panel (C) demonstrates antigen-dependent (MHC presentation)
  and –independent (superantigen) activation of the adaptive immune system by phagosome-contained
  and cytoplasmic bacteria. Successful activation of the adaptive immune branch is
  a key step in bacterial clearance; however, non-antigen-dependent activation of
  T helper cells via bacterial superantigens elaborates a destructive cascade of cytokine
  release and non-specific T cell proliferation. Antigens from intracellular pathogens
  are processed through the proteasome into peptides, transported into the endoplamic
  reticulum (ER), captured by MHCI molecules, and presented to CD8+ T cells that elicit
  a barrage of cytotoxic effectors. Alternatively, antigens from extracellular pathogens
  are captured by MHCII molecules after digestion in the phagolysosome and presented
  to CD4+ that elicit a burst of cytokines that activate B cells to produce an antibody
  response. Abbreviations and notations; bold arrow () indicates steps during the
