caption: CD28 signaling in FOXP3 expression and the effects of belatacept. CD28 costimulatory
  signaling is essential for the induction and maintenance of FOXP3 by activating
  the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RelA/NFκB signaling pathways. RelA binds to the FOXP3 promoter
  region to induce FOXP3 expression, whereas the PI3K pathway regulates chromatin
  remodeling to enhance FOXP3 expression. FOXP3 is the key transcription factor in
  Treg cells, promoting the expression of suppressive functional markers such as CD25,
  CTLA-4, IL-10, TGF-β, CD39 and CD73, which collectively suppress alloreactive conventional
  T cells. However, belatacept blocks this CD28 signaling pathway by inhibiting CD28
  binding to CD80/86 on APCs, thereby reducing FOXP3 expression. APC, antigen-presenting
  cell; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Treg, regulatory T; TCR, T cell receptor;
  mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4; IL,
