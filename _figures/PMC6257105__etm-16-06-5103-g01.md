caption: Pathway relationship network of TGF-β1 and −2 treatment-related DEGs. The
  red nodes represent pathways involving upregulated DEGs, and the yellow nodes represent
  pathways involving both up- and downregulated DEGs. The arrows represent regulatory
  direction. DEG, differently expressed gene; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1.
