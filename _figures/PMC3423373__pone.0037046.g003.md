caption: (A) mRNAs encoding TF/SMs that increased from E17.5 were functionally enriched
  in regulation of angiogenesis. Vegfa was identified as an important regulatory hub.
  (B) mRNAs encoding TF/SMs regulating angiogenesis were highly correlated with Vegfa
  expression (Pearson's correlation coefficients r>0.85). (C) TFSMs induced from E18.5
  or later was functionally enriched in genes regulating immune/defense response,
  cell differentiation and phosphorylation. (D) Biological association networks of
  TF/SMs indicate that the JAK/STAT1 and AP-1 complexes form important hubs. Cytokine-cytokine
  receptor interaction was the most enriched signaling pathway at this gestational
  age. Genes/proteins are represented as nodes, and the biological relationships between
  two nodes are represented as an edge (line). Solid lines denote direct interactions
  and dotted lines indirect interactions between nodes. TFs are outlined in red. Cytokines
  and cytokine receptors are outlined in blue. TF/SMs decreasing from E17.5 to PN0
  were functionally enriched in (E) cell cycle and (F) chromatin assembly/organization.
  In the proposed cell cycle related sub-network (E), Foxm1, Myc, Nfyb and Tfdp1 formed
  important TF-hubs (red nodes). The Plk1 signaling pathway was a highly enriched
  pathway (blue nodes). In the chromatin assembly and histone modification related
  sub-network (F), the high mobility group family, chromobox family, SWI/SNF family
  and mini-chromosome maintenance proteins formed important hubs (red nodes).
