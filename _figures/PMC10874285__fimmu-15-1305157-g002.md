caption: 'Interplay between HCV-induced autophagy and host innate immune response.
  HCV-induced autophagy removes DAMPs to inhibit the formation of inflammasomes and
  hence pyroptosis. HCV-induced autophagic degradation of TNFR1 also inhibits the
  activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis. However, host cells in response to HCV infection
  also express TNF-α and IFNAR2 (also see Figure 1). TNF-α at a low concentration
  causes the generation of ROS to initiate autophagy. However, it, at a high concentration,
  can also put a halt on the completion of autophagy via caspase-8-mediated cleavage
  of p62, ultimately activating the cGAS/STING/TBK1 pathway and apoptosis. TNF-α-induced
  cleavage of p62 also disrupts Nrf2 signaling, which is activated by HCV to induce
  the expression of antioxidant genes to alleviate oxidative stress. HCV also delays
  the maturation of autophagosomes by inducing the expression of Rubicon for the accumulation
  of autophagosomes to support its RNA replication, which can also lead to the accumulation
  of DAMPs. Mitochondrial dynamics are closely related to the regulation of innate
  immune response. On the other hand, mitochondrial fusion supports inflammasome activation
  and pro-survival pathways that, if prolonged, can contribute to tumorigenesis. On
  the other hand, mitochondrial fission, which is coupled with mitophagy and promoted
  by HCV, supports the formation of MAM which can serve as the platform to mediate
  IFN response. RC: HCV replication complex'
