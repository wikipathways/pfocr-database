caption: 'Regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis pathway during Z. bungeanum ripening.
  This pathway was constructed based on the KEGG annotation results. Blue letters
  indicate structural genes; heatmap color blocks represent gene expression patterns
  (FPKM value). Black letters represent metabolites; the histogram displays changes
  in the main metabolites (relative content) during ripening. Gene abbreviations are
  as follows: CYP73A (trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase), CHI (chalcone isomease), CYP75B1
  (flavonoid 3′-monooxygenase), DFR (flavanone 4-reductase), F3H (flavonoid 3-hydroxylase),
  HCT (shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase), CYP98A (coumaroylquinate (coumaroylshikimate)
  3′-monooxygenase), CCoAOMT (caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase), CHS (chalcone synthase),
  PGT1 (phlorizin synthase), ANS (anthocyanidin synthase), FLS (flavonol synthese),
  LAR (leucoanthocyanidin reductase), ANR (anthocyanidin reductase), PAL (phenylalanine
  ammonia-lyase), CYP75A (flavonoid 3′, 5′-hydroxylase)'
