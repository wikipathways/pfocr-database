caption: Activation of IFN-I/III responses in TME lead to enhanced anti-tumor response
  and tumor control. Poorly immunogenic (“cold”) tumors might be converted to highly
  infiltrated tumors (“hot”) through the activation of IFN-I/III responses. This might
  be accomplished through several strategies, such as genotoxic therapies and triggering
  of innate immunity receptors involved in antiviral responses. IFN-I/III mediate
  this phenomenon by its actions on tumor cells, inducing immunogenic cell death and
  enhanced antigen presentation as well as by its effects in activating anti-tumor
  immune cell populations, such as dendritic cells, T lymphocytes and natural killer
  (NK) cells. Created with BioRender.com.
