  feasible, stationary flux distribution matching the flux data; (2) a sub-network
  of flux-carrying reactions is exported, (3) consistent values of all metabolite
  concentrations and equilibrium constants are determined, (4) kinetic constants appearing
  in the sub-network are balanced, (5) kinetic rate laws and associated kinetic constants
  are inserted into the model, and (6) the maximal reaction rates are adjusted to
  reproduce the steady-state fluxes calculated before. The laboratory data feeding
  into “Flux” can include quantitative metabolomic measurements of metabolites, and
  also dynamically calculated flux values for the network. The lower half of the diagram
  shows a cycle of experimentation and modelling: here the result of the MCA can be
  used to target which rate laws should be measured in vitro after measurement, this
  rate law can be substituted into the model, with a view to better fit the observed
  perturbation behaviour. All grey arrows refer to aspects of the workflow where additional
  data can be added in as knowledge increases. The pathway shown is a truncated version
  of the trehalose pathway. Abbreviations: T6P = trehalose 6-phosphate; aaT = - trehalase;
