caption: Network analysis identified RABEP2 as an important protein in inflammatory
  and signaling pathways implication in the development of inflammation and cancer.
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to determine significant networks that
  were significantly altered in H. pylori-infected animals, as compared with uninfected
  controls. RAPEP2 was significantly up-regulated by iTRAQ and mapped to disease pathways
  and networks directly involved in inflammation, cancer, and gastrointestinal disease.
  Green designates proteins that were significantly downregulated, whereas red indicates
  proteins that were significantly up-regulated. Shapes indicate different functional
  categories of proteins, as defined in the inset. Lines indicate interactions among
  proteins within the network, as defined in the inset. Arrowheads indicate stimulatory
  interactions, whereas endcaps indicate inhibitory interactions. Solid lines indicate
  direct interactions, whereas dashed lines indicate indirect interactions.
