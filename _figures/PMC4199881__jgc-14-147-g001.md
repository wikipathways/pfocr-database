caption: 'Role of GKN1 in gastric cancer. GKN1 induces apoptosis through the death
  receptor dependent pathway and inhibits Helicobacter pylori CagA injection into
  gastric epithelial cells. GKN1 also reduces reactive oxygen species production by
  up-regulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as MnSOD and catalase.
  At the intracellular level of gastric epithelial cells, GKN1 induces miR-185 expression
  by down-regulating c-myc, which in turn inhibits epigenetic modification of genomic
  DNA and stimulates the expression of negative cell cycle regulators, including p53,
  p21, and p16. In addition, GKN1 inhibits epithelial mesenchymal transition by inactivating
  PI3K/Akt and β-catenin signaling pathway, resulting in the disruption of invasion
  and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. Blue line: stimulator, Red line: inhibitor.
  GKN1 = gastrokine 1; ROS = reactive oxygen species; NF-κB = nuclear factor-κB; COX2
  = cyclooxygenase-2; CASP3 = caspase 3; CASP8 = caspase 8; CDH1 = cadherin 1; DNMT1
  = DNA methyltransferase 1; EZH2 = enhancer of zeste homolog 2; PI3K = phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; IKKα/β = IκB kinase α/β.'
