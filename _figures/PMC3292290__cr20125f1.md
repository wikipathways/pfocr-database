caption: A metabolic switch in carbon source for lipid synthesis. (A) Under conditions
  when mitochondrial respiration is fully functional, glucose is the major source
  of carbons for acetyl-CoA to synthesize lipids. The yellow block arrow indicates
  the route of carbons from glucose to lipids. The blue block arrow indicates oxidative
  glutamine metabolism (anaplerosis). The green block arrow shows the metabolic pathway
  of citrate generated from glucose-derived acetyl-CoA and glutamine-derived oxaloacetate.
  (B) Under conditions where HIF is stabilized (such as hypoxia or upon VHL deletion)
  or when mitochondrial respiration is limited, glutamine predominantly provides carbons
  for lipogenic acetyl-CoA either via cytoplasmic IDH1 (yellow block arrow) or mitochondrial
  IDH2 (orange block arrow). This pathway is referred to as reductive glutamine metabolism.
  The exact route of glutamine to acetyl-CoA most likely depends on the extend of
  mitochondrial respiration. In red and green are processes or compounds that promote
  or prevent reductive glutamine metabolism, respectively. Key enzymes are represented
  in blue boxes and their name abbreviations are described in the text.
