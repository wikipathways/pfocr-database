caption: Simplified model for CO2-induced stomatal movements in Arabidopsis. CO2 enters
  guard cells through PIP2;1, and likely other aquaporins and perhaps also passively.
  It is then converted into bicarbonate () via the action of ßCA4 at the plasma membrane
  and ßCA1. MPK4/12, HT1, and CBC1/2 are proposed to function in a signaling pathway,
  but the detailed mechanisms and whether they act in the same pathway remain unknown
  (dashed lines indicate need for more research and possible intermediate steps).
  CBC1 and CBC2 function at the convergence of blue light signaling and low CO2-induced
  stomatal opening pathways in guard cells. By interacting and phosphorylating the
  VK channel TPK1 at the tonoplast, KIN7 favors the exit of K+ cations that are crucial
  for stomatal closure. GHR1 interacts with SLAC1 at the plasma membrane, thereby
  positively triggering the export of anions. It is hypothesized that GHR1 could act
  as a scaffolding protein, potentially bringing important components around SLAC1.
  Anion export via the action of both S-type (SLAC1) and R-type (QUAC1) anion channels
  is required for stomatal closure in response to elevated CO2. Red arrows = inhibition;
  blue arrows = activation.
