caption: TRPC1 channel is a major regulator of EGFR signaling. Activation of EGFR
  by its natural ligand, EGF, induces autophophorylation of the receptor on several
  tyrosine residues (e.g. Tyr-1068, Tyr-1045, and Tyr-992). Autophosphorylated EGFR
  recruits phospholipase Cγ directly and PI3K via the adaptor protein Gab1. Triggering
  of the MAPK pathway requires activation of a transduction cascade leading to phosphorylation
  of p44/p42 by MEK1. In the A549 model of NSCLC, MAPK pathway has a minor role in
  cell cycle progression. In contrast, PI3K/Akt cascade controls the expression of
  cyclins D1 and D3 and permits G1 to S phase transition. Activation of phospholipase
  Cγ induces IP3-dependent release of Ca2+ from the ER. Subsequent decrease of [Ca2+]
  in the ER could activate TRPC1 and Orai1 via the Ca2+ sensor STIM1. Other mechanisms
  could link EGFR stimulation and TRPC1 opening (question mark). Ca2+ entry through
  TRPC1 exerts a positive feedback on EGFR autophosphorylation and therefore enhances
  activity PI3K and MAPK. The effect of Ca2+ on EGFR is calmodulin-dependent (Cam).
