caption: Misfolded protein aggregates bind to toll-like or scavenger receptors which
  triggers the expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 to prime the cell for inflammasome
  assembly in a MyD88-NFκB signaling dependent manner. Extracellular misfolded protein
  aggregates may be internalized by the phagolysosomal pathway but can escape lysosomal
  degradation and trigger assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome (step 1). The NLRP3 inflammasome
  catalyzes the maturation of interleukin-1β and interleukin-18 which can be transported
  extracellularly or released into the extracellular environment during pyroptosis
  for inflammatory signaling (step 2). Assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome may progress
  to the formation of the ASC speck, a supramolecular complex with enhanced inflammatory
  signaling capacity, which may then be released into the extracellular environment
  following pyroptosis or some other non-pyroptic mechanism (step 2). Once in the
  extracellular space, the ASC speck remains functionally active for inflammatory
  cytokine maturation, pro-aggregatory modifications of other proteins, and cross-seeding
  of neuronally derived misfolded protein aggregation (step 3). The ASC speck can
  also propagate inflammation from one microglial cell to another by inducing a pro-
  inflammatory phenotype in cells that phagocytose the ASC speck but fail to degrade
  it (step 4). Together, these activities of the ASC speck implicate its role in the
  propagation of inflammation and spreading of protein aggregation in a vicious cycle
  that contributes to the chronic progressive nature of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s
  disease (step 5).
