caption: Main signaling cascades of the IGF-1R. Binding of IGF-I or IGF-II to IGF-1R
  causes autocatalytic phosphorylation of the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase domain, which
  also phosphorylates additional IGF-1R tyrosine residues important for the recruitment
  of adapter molecules like Shc and IRS. These in turn activate kinase cascades, primarily
  the MAP kinase pathway and the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway, that ultimately lead to signal
  transduction to the nucleus and mitochondrion.
