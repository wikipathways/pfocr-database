caption: ODC is the first rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis and produces
  putrescine; AdoMetDC is also rate-limiting and its activity provides the aminopropyl
  donor for the synthesis of both spermidine and spermine; SMOX is an inducible FAD-dependent
  oxidase located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm that can produce DNA damage
  by its production of H2O2; PAOX is generally a constitutively expressed, peroxisomal
  oxidase that is rate-limited by the availability of N1-acetylated polyamines; SSAT
  is an inducible enzyme that is critical for the maintenance of polyamine homeostasis
  and is implicated in the cytotoxic activity of several polyamine analogs; MTA is
  produced from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine by the activity of both spermidine
  and spermine synthases.
