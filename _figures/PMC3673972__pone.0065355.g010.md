caption: 'Well documented effects are indicated by solid lines, whereas effects involving
  yet unidentified mediator(s) or events are represented by dashed line. Lines with
  pointed end denote activation, whereas lines with a flat end indicate inhibition.
  Activating or inhibitory effect of malvidin is indicated by a circled + or − next
  to the line, respectively. LPS induces activating phosphorylation, nuclear translocation
  and DNA binding of NFκB, induction of ROS production, PARP activation, activation
  of MAPKs, MKP-1 expression, activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-Akt
  pathway and destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane systems. Malvidin attenuates
  ROS production, mitochondrial destabilization, and activation of PARP and MAPKs.
  It also augments Akt activation and MKP-1 expression resulting in diminished activation
  of NFκB. AP-1: activator protein-1; Akt: Protein Kinase B (PKB); Ask1: apoptotic
