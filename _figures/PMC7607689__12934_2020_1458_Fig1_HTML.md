caption: Engineered taxadiene biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae. Genes highlighted
  in red represent native genes which have been overexpressed through the integration
  of one additional copy. Genes highlighted in blue are exogenous genes which were
  heterologously expressed. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (mvaS) and Acetyl-CoA
  acetyltransferase (mvaE) from Enterococcus faecalis. Geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  synthase (crtE) from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous and Taxadiene synthase (TASY)
  from Taxus cuspidata
