caption: 'A schematic representation of glucose (Glc) signaling wherein AtRH57 acts
  as a crucial player in the feedback inhibition of ABA accumulation within the sugar-mediated
  ABA signaling pathway during Arabidopsis seed germination and early seedling growth.
  HXK1, hexokinase1; ABA, abscisic acid; ABA biosynthesis genes: ABA2,ABA3, and AAO3;
  ABA signaling genes: ABI3,ABI4, and ABI5.'
papertitle: AtRH57, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, is involved in feedback inhibition of
  glucose-mediated abscisic acid accumulation during seedling development and additively
  affects pre-ribosomal RNA processing with high glucose.
