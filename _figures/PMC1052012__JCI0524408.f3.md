caption: Transcriptional gene regulation by the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α. HIF-1α
  protein undergoes rapid prolyl hydroxylation under normoxic conditions by specific
  cellular prolyl hydroxylases. Direct hydroxylation by ROS is a purported alternative
  pathway. Hydroxylated HIF interacts with the VHL, a critical member of an E3 ubiquitin
  ligase complex that polyubiquitylates HIF (Ub, ubiquitin). Polyubiquitylation targets
  HIF-1α for destruction by the proteosome. Under hypoxia (¬O2) hydroxylation does
  not occur and HIF-1α is stabilized. Heterodimerization with ARNT forms the active
  HIF complex that binds to a core hypoxia response element in a wide array of genes
  involved in a diversity of biological processes germane to cardiovascular function.
  Transcriptional activation of iNOS expression is shown as an example of how HIF-mediated
  gene expression can affect ROS generation by generating NO that interacts with O2––
  to form ONOO––. NOX2 is shown as a cellular source of O2––.

  description: Transcriptional gene regulation by the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α.
    HIF-1α protein undergoes rapid prolyl hydroxylation under normoxic conditions
    by specific cellular prolyl hydroxylases. Direct hydroxylation by ROS is a purported
    alternative pathway. Hydroxylated HIF interacts with the VHL, a critical member
    of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that polyubiquitylates HIF (Ub, ubiquitin).
    Polyubiquitylation targets HIF-1α for destruction by the proteosome. Under hypoxia
    (¬O2) hydroxylation does not occur and HIF-1α is stabilized. Heterodimerization
    with ARNT forms the active HIF complex that binds to a core hypoxia response element
    in a wide array of genes involved in a diversity of biological processes germane
    to cardiovascular function. Transcriptional activation of iNOS expression is shown
    as an example of how HIF-mediated gene expression can affect ROS generation by
    generating NO that interacts with O2–– to form ONOO––. NOX2 is shown as a cellular
