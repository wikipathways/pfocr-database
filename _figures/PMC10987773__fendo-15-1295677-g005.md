caption: Hepatic protein and amino acid metabolic pathway during pregnancy. Pregnancy
  results in insulin resistance that increases protein synthesis from amino acids
  (AAs) by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), PI3K phosphoinositide-3-kinase
  (PI3K) and AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) signaling, and ribosomal protein
  S6 kinase B1 (RPS6KB1) responds to mTOR signaling to promote protein synthesis.
  In addition, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2) is involved in
  the regulation of mTOR signaling. Furthermore, γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) modulates
  the availability of AAs for intracellular glutathione synthesis. Moreover, the content
  of hepatic AAs from the small intestine through the blood circulation alters, which
  leads to changes in the production of glucose and urea from AAs
