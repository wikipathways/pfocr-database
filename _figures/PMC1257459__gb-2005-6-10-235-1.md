caption: A hypothetical multi-step signaling cascade. The diagram shown is based on
  the classical MAP kinase activation pathway. The core of such signaling cascades
  comprises a series of enzymes (protein kinases) that sequentially activate each
  other (shown as A1, A2 and A3 in the unphosphorylated and inactive state, and as
  A1*, A2* and A3* in the phosphorylated and active state) so as to propagate a cellular
  response to a signal, as well as the opposing enzymes (for example, phosphatases)
  and other factors (such as ubiquitin-mediated degradation) that inactivate them
  (shown as I1*, I2* and I3*). Upstream and downstream factors in this schematic multi-tiered
  signal transduction cascade are not shown. The in silico analyses discussed in this
  article indicate that activating processes primarily control the strength of both
  the basal and signal-induced output (indicated by bars), whereas inhibitory processes
  control both output strength and the rate and/or duration of signal propagation
  (indicated by clocks). These studies conclude that, compared with single-step pathways
  (like the TGFβ- and PKA-mediated transcription factor activation described in the
  text), a cascade exhibits ultrasensitivity (resistance to stochastic noise and switch-like
  responsiveness), signal amplification and optimized signal transmission speed (see
  also Table 1). In addition, in a cascade, there is the opportunity potentially to
  exert very fine-tuned regulation of pathway output because there are multiple points
  at which different factors can be used to control the amount and/or level of activity
  of the pathway constituents and their temporal response characteristics.
