caption: Hormonal regulation of the UPR by ABA, JA, and SA. This diagram illustrates
  how ABA, JA, and SA can directly or indirectly modulate the UPR. SA, through the
  NPR1 pathway, activates antiviral defense genes, including RDR1, which, alongside
  RDR6, degrades viral RNA. In addition, SA likely limits viral replication and movement
  through the glycolysis enzyme GAPDH. SA also influences ROS production in mitochondria
  and retrograde signaling via AOX and glutathione. ABA induces the expression of
  RDR1 and RDR6, linking it to antiviral silencing, and further represses the JA signaling
  pathway while limiting viral movement by promoting callose deposition at plasmodesmata.
  CPR5 plays a crucial role in balancing plant growth and ER stress response by utilizing
  the UPR to repress the bZIP28 and IRE1–bZIP60 pathways. ABA, abscisic acid; AOX,
  alternative oxidase; bZIP28, basic leucine zipper 28; bZIP60, basic leucine zipper
  60; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme 1; JA, jasmonic acid;
  NPR1, Nonexpressor of Pathogenesis-Related 1; RDR1, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
  1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SA, salicylic acid; UPR, unfolded protein response
