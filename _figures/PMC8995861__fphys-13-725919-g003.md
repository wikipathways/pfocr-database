caption: 'The schematic diagram of coping with RNA oxidation. (A) The oxidized RNA
  may lose its normal function, it would be degraded into nucleoside monophosphate
  by ribonucleases, PNPase or APE1. The nucleoside monophosphate can be reused in
  RNA synthesis. PNPase: Polynucleotide phosphorylase; APE1: Apurinic/apyrimidinic
  endonuclease 1. (B) The pathway of RNA repair has not been reported yet, but there
  are many studies speculating that it exists. Under the action of some substances,
  the oxidative damage of RNA will be repaired to perform its normal function. (C)
  Oxidized RNA molecules can be labeled with specific binding proteins. Once identified,
  oxidized RNA can be separated from normal RNA. Sequestration may help recruit repair/degradation
  activities that will eventually eliminate oxidized RNA. The orange ovals indicate
  binding proteins. (D) 8-oxoGuo containing RNA can be generated by oxidizing RNA
  and a few can be synthesis by 8-oxo-GTP. 8-oxo-GTP can be generated by oxidation
  of GTP as well as by phosphorylation of 8-oxo-GDP by NDK. 8-oxo-GDP can be generated
  by oxidation of GDP as well as by phosphorylation of 8-oxo-GMP by GK. MTH1, MTH2,
  MTH3 could hydrolyze 8-oxo-GDP and 8-oxo-GTP to 8-oxo-GMP. NUDT5, NUDT15, NUDT18
  could hydrolyze 8-oxo-GDP to 8-oxo-GMP. GK: Guanylate kinase; NDK, nucleotide diphosphate
  kinase; MTH1, MutT homologue 1; MTH2, MutT homologue 2; MTH3, MutT homologue 3;
  NUDT5, Nudix type 5; NUDT15, Nudix type 15; NUDT18, Nudix type 18. OS, oxidized
  stress; The red blot in the 8-oxoG containing RNA indicates the oxidized nucleotide.
  Blue lines represent RNA molecules. Red “X” represents oxidized residues in RNA.'
