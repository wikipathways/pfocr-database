caption: Engineered biodegradation pathway for paraoxon. Organophosphate hydrolase
  (Opd) from Flavobacterium sp. initially hydrolyzes the pesticide into two primary
  intermediates, DEP and PNP. DEP is further converted to orthophosphate by a phosphodiesterase
  (Pde) from D. acidovorans and an alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) from P. aeruginosa.
  PNP is converted to β-ketoadipate by five enzymes (encoded by pnpA to pnpE) from
  Pseudomonas sp. strain ENV2030. β-Ketoadipate enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle
  as succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA after conversion by P. putida's native β-ketoadipate:succinyl-CoA
  transferase (TR) and β-ketoadipyl-CoA thiolase (TH). LD50, 50% lethal dose.
