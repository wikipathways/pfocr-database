caption: Crosstalk between dysregulation of metal ions and pathological proteins in
  neurodegenerative diseases. Excessive iron affects α-synuclein aggregation, while
  misfolded α-synuclein accelerates iron deposition. There are two copper-binding
  sites in the N-terminus of α-synuclein that increase its aggregation. Silencing
  CTR1 can decrease the phosphorylation and aggregation of α-synuclein. PARK9 deficiency
  induces increased zinc levels and α-synuclein aggregation. Manganese can indirectly
  stimulate the expression of α-synuclein through activating the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway.
  On the other hand, α-synuclein aggregation could enhance manganese-induced neurotoxicity
  through the NF-κB pathway. The binding of IRP to iron inhibits the IRE, which increases
  the expression of APP. APP can be cleaved by β- and γ-secretase in early endosomes
  to form Aβ in the amyloidogenic pathway. On one hand, excessive metal ions induce
  increased levels of Aβ monomers; on the other hand, metal ions can bind to Aβ and
  promote its aggregation. Iron, copper, and zinc enhance tau phosphorylation by activating
  CDK5, GSK-3β, or MAPKs and inactivating PP-2A activity to accelerate the formation
  of NFTs. Manganese exposure promotes the development of ALS. Additionally, partial
  deficiency of SOD2 significantly exacerbates motor deficits. Iron dysregulation
  induced by SOD1G93A is mediated by impairment of the Akt/FOXO3a signaling pathway.
  Meanwhile, increased levels of copper, zinc, and metallothioneins-I/II/III are observed
  in SOD1G93A mice. Copper has the ability to bind with the N-terminus of HTT proteins,
  thereby promoting their aggregation. Mutant HTT can lead to a deficiency in neuronal
  manganese, which affects arginase activity. Additionally, mutant HTT inhibits the
  binding of Sp1 to the promoter of the ZnT3 gene, resulting in decreased levels of
  synaptic vesicular zinc in the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum. This figure was
