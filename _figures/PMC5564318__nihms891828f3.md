caption: 'Schematic illustration of up and down-regulated metabolic proteins in PANC-1
  cells. Several enzymes for Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid
  β-oxidation pathways were down-regulated (green arrow), and enzymes for pyruvate
  fermentation, pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis, protein synthesis,
  purine synthesis, pyrimidine synthesis, and cholesterol synthesis were up-regulated
  (red arrow). Abbreviations: FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; PFK, phosphofructokinase;
  PGK2, phosphoglycerate kinase 2; ENO2, enolase 2; PK, pyruvate kinase; LDH, L-lactate
  dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; A, aconitase; ICDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase;
  SCAL, succinate-CoA ligase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; FH, fumarate hydratase;
  MDH, malate dehydrogenase; GPDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGDH, phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase; ATPCL, ATP citrate lyase; ACAAT, acetyl-Coenzyme A acetyltransferase;
  DHCR, 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase; G, glutaminase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase;
  GPRS, glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthase; GCL, glutamate-cysteine ligase; GS, glutathione
  synthetase.'
