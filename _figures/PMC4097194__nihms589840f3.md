caption: (a) Examples of genes directly regulated by the two-component pathway PhoQ-PhoP
  in S. enterica and Y. pestis. The gene slyB is conserved, and directly regulated
  by PhoP, in both species. The genes rstA and psiE are conserved, but directly regulated
  by PhoP in only one of the two species. The directly regulated genes ugtL and y4126
  are unique to S. enterica and Y. pestis, respectively. (b) Schematic of S. bongori
  and S. enterica chromosomes, each harboring a srfN ortholog. The horizontally-acquired
  SpiR-SsrB system, encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 (SPI-2) in S. enterica
  but not S. bongori, evolved to transcriptionally activate srfN. (b) De novo evolution
  of a response regulator binding site. SPI-2 encodes the two-component pathway SpiR-SsrB,
  which was acquired after the divergence of S. enterica from S. bongori. The gene
  srfN, ancestral to the Salmonella lineage, accumulated promoter mutations that enabled
  activation by SsrB, a transcriptional link that contributes to Salmonella virulence.
  The relevant portion of the srfN promoter is shown with conserved positions shaded
  grey and the region bound by SsrB in S. enterica underlined.
