caption: The role of VE-PTP in phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177. VE-PTP and VEGFR2
  (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) form a complex in resting cells,
  which VE-PTP acts inhibiting the VEGFR2 pathway. Although, when VEGFR2 is activated
  by VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) the complex is interrupted, which induces
  the VEGFR2 dimerization and activation, leading to the AKT phosphorylation at Ser473
  and consequently on eNOS at Ser1177. On endothelial junctions, the activated junctions
  complex formed by VE-cadherin, VEGFR2, and CD31 acts in the same signaling pathway
  of VEGR2, although, VE-PTP acts inactivating this pathway
