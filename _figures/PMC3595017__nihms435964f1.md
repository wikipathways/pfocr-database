caption: 'RIG-I and MDA5 helicases are both represented in open conformation upon
  recognition of intracellular viral RNA, and MDA5 is shown to be interacting with
  the adaptor molecule MAVS at the mitochondrial outer membrane. The initiation of
  downstream signaling occurs via the recruitment of the regulatory proteins TRAF2
  and 6, TRADD, FADD, RIP1 and caspase-8 to MAVS. This leads to the formation of the
  IKK complex, which in turn is responsible for the translocation of active NF-κB
  dimers into the nucleus and the subsequent production and secretion of proinflammatory
  cytokines. The branch of downstream signaling causing the activation and nuclear
  translocation of IRF3 and IRF7, which promote the induction of type I IFN, is thought
  to be regulated by TRAF3 protein binding to MAVS. Interference of this pathway by
  picornanaviruses is highlighted, with the name of the viral protease and virus involved
  in the red outlined rectangles. Virus-induced cleavage of proteins of interest is
  highlighted with a scissors icon (red: viral proteases; orange: host cell caspases).
  The scheme also depicts the possible regulatory roles of cellular FLIP isoforms
  on intersections of innate immune responses to picornavirus infection. We have adopted
  from Kemball et al. the hypothesis that during picornavirus infection mitochondria
  act as a bridge between the RIG-I pathway, the intravesicular TLR receptors and
  autophagy []. TLR3 is known to be a major player in innate responses to picornavirus
  infection, and has the ability to interact with TRIF, which in turn is known to
  recruit the ripoptosome – a cell-death inducing complex of RIP1, FADD, caspase-8
  and cellular FLIP isoforms []. Although activation of the ripoptosome during any
  viral infection at TLR3 or any other organelle has yet to be shown, it is possible
  that the ripoptosome is connecting the innate responses with apoptosis and necroptosis
  [,]. Both caspase-8 and c-FLIP were shown to specifically regulate the formation
  and downstream signaling of the ripoptosome []. The caspase-8–c-FLIPL complex was
  shown to have enough catalytic activity to cleave the RIP1 kinase, thereby destabilizing
  the ripoptosome and suppressing necroptosis. By contrast, c-FLIPS, which lacks the
  caspase-8 activation domain, was shown to suppress the cleavage of RIP1, leading
  to its accumulation and the further induction of necroptosis. In the absence of
  any cellular FLIP, procaspase-8 homodimers within the ripoptosome could undergo
  activation by autoproteolysis and consequently induce apoptosis. Interestingly,
  c-FLIPS was also shown to downregulate the autophagosome formation [].C-FLIPL: Cellular
