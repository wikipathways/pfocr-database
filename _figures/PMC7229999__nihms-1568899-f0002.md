caption: Shown here are the different rearrangement outcomes that may arise due to
  breakage-fusion-bridge cycles post telomere crisis. If the chromosome harboring
  an uncapped telomere undergoes DNA replication, then the result is the generation
  of sister chromatids that each have an uncapped telomere end. These uncapped telomere
  ends are recognized as DNA double strands “breaks” and can be “fused” together creating
  a dicentric chromosome. During mitosis, the spindles can attach to both centromeres
  and the dicentric chromosome can be pulled in opposite directions forming an anaphase/chromatin
  “bridge”. Such force renders the dicentric chromosome prone to breakage at random
  positions along its length. Such breakage can be accompanied with asymmetric inheritance
  of the chromosome fragments by the daughter cells. If the daughter cell acquires
  a portion of one chromosome and activates telomerase, it can lead to telomere acquisition
  by the derivative chromosome. However, due to the loss of genetic information caused
  by the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, the resultant event involves loss of heterozygosity.
  In contrast, the daughter cell can also resect a telomeric end to reveal homologous
  sequences to another chromosome. Repair of such ends by the break-induced replication
  pathway can be a mechanism of telomere acquisition, but also generate a non-reciprocal
  translocation, where genetic information is gained by only the derivative chromosome
  and the donor chromosome remains intact. Additionally, if the daughter cells do
  not activate telomerase, then the cell may continue to harbor a chromosome with
  an uncapped telomere. Subsequent replication result in the generation of another
  sister chromatid fusion and a dicentric chromosome. Such a chromosome can once again
  enter the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle. If a chromosome is broken at similar positions
  during several cycles of BFB, then the derivative chromosome can harbor gene amplifications,
  but with inverted repeats.
