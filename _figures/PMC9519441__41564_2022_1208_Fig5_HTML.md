caption: 'a, Synthesis pathway of UP. The enzyme encoded by SP_1205 catalyses the
  condensation between isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and geranyl diphosphate (GPP)
  into farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), which is then converted to UPP by enzyme SP_0261,
  after which UPP is dephosphorylated by SP_0457 into its active form UP. b, Disaccharide
  metabolism and bacitracin resistance related genes are involved in bypass mechanisms
  of SP_1205. Suppressor mutations of SP_1205 essentiality were identified with WGS
  (boxes with white background) and synthetic lethality interactions (boxes with pink
  backgrounds) identified with Tn-seq using libraries constructed in a PG06-SP_1205
  knockout. The identification of three functionally related suppressive SNPs (SP_1176
  A17P, SP_1884 I34T and SP_1885 H182N) suggests that transport of the disaccharide
  trehalose (or a similar compound) is a central hub for bypassing SP_1205. Gene SP_1205
  has a synthetic lethal interaction with two enzymes (SP_1883 and SP_1724) that hydrolyse
  the disaccharides trehalose and sucrose to produce glucose-6-phosphate (which feeds
  into glycolysis), the pentose-phosphate pathway and capsule biosynthesis (left panel).
  One of the genes with synthetic lethality with SP_1205 is the UPP phosphatase BacA
  (SP_0457). Interestingly, a TIGR4-derived SP_1205 knockout presented two compensatory
  mutations associated with the cell wall: one mutation is located in murE (SP_1530
  A430S), which is involved in peptidoglycan synthesis, and the second mutation is
  located in a non-characterized membrane protein coding gene (SP_0454 H581N), which
  forms a complex with BacA (right panel).'
