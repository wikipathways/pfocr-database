caption: Diagrammatic elucidation of the molecular mechanism of Metformin-mediated
  restoration of dysregulated Bmal1/Nrf2-dependent antioxidant protective pathway
  leading to cytoprotection and cataract prevention in response to Aging/oxidative
  stress. Oxidative stress/aging causes increase in ROS accumulation-driven dysregulation
  of AMPK/Bmal1/Nrf2 pathways. Our results demonstrated that organic cation transporter
  (OCTs) present in LECs and upregulated by Metformin treatment. This phenomenon evoked
  by Metformin can facilitate its increased cellular abundance, and thereby, promoting
  cellular health through the regulatory interactions of AMPK/Bmal1/Nrf2 and antioxidant
  genes within the conditions of cellular status and microenvironments during aging
  and oxidative stresses. We conclude that aging/oxidative stress induced injurious
  signaling pathways due to deterioration of antioxidant defense mechanism(s) during
  aging that underlies age-associated diseases; Metformin holds a great promise for
  combating aging-or oxidative-related pathobiology.
