caption: Antigen stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) activates the cytosolic
  protein kinase AKT, which inhibits GSK-3 by phosphorylation at a conserved N-terminal
  serine. Inhibition of GSK-3 allows the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)-associated
  splicing factor (PSF) to modulate the splicing of CD45 pre-mRNA, as described in
  detail in  (). Growth factor signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
  also activates AKT and inhibits GSK-3, allowing activation of diverse downstream
  effectors, including glycogen synthase. (Both Akt and GSK-3 have multiple targets
  not shown here for the sake of clarity). This pathway could also modulate GSK-3-dependent
  phosphorylation of splicing factors in the cytosol or within the nucleus (). The
  Wnt pathway is also suppressed by GSK-3. In the absence of Wnts, GSK-3 phosphorylates
  β-catenin, promoting its proteosomal degradation. Wnt signaling inhibits GSK-3 through
  a distinct, AKT independent mechanism, stabilizing β-catenin, which then activates
  Wnt target gene expression. Wnts could also regulate splicing factor phosphorylation
  through inhibition of GSK-3 as well as through other downstream effectors of Wnt
  signaling (; ).
