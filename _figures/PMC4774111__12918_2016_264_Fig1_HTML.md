caption: Main parts of the biochemical regulation of the G1/S restriction point in
  normal (non-leukemic) cell cycle. The presence of growth factors leads to the constitutive
  activation of Cyclin D:Cdk4,6 complexes, which in turn favors the hypo-phosphorylation
  of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) in early G1 phase. The hypo-phosphorylated pRb maintains
  the ability to inhibit E2F transcription factors. Growth factors also stimulate
  the metabolic machinery of the cell, leading its mass to gradually grow. When cell
  growth reaches a critical threshold, the Cyclin E:Cdk2 and Cyclin A:Cdk1,2 complexes
  are activated resulting in hyper-phosphorylation of pRb in late G1 phase (where
  the differentiation potential is lost), liberation of E2F transcription factors
  and increased Cyclin A (and Cyclin E, E2F) expression, whose levels are indicative
  of the passage to the S-phase
