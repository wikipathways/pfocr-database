caption: Mechanism of Rho-associated salt-sensitive hypertension in vascular smooth
  muscle cells (VSMCs) and representative vasoactive peptide coupling to G-protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs) Gq/11 and G12/13. There are three mechanisms of Rho-associated
  salt-sensitive hypertension in VSMCs. These include the stimulation of VSMCs by
  increased responsible vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II (Ang II), endothelin-1
  (ET-1), and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) in the blood (★1), abnormal activations of Rho-guanine
  nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (★2), and aberrant activation of Rho/Rho-associated
  protein kinase (ROCK) by, for example, Wnt noncanonical pathway in aging (★3). These,
  via Ca2+ influx into the cells (★1) and increased Ca2+ sensitivity (★1–3), induce
  VSMCs contraction and increase vasoconstriction, which increases peripheral vascular
  resistance and decreases renal blood flow, resulting in salt-sensitive hypertension.
  In VSMC, phosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLCs) is induced by two mechanisms,
  intracellular Ca2+ entry and Ca2+ sensitivity. While MLC is phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  MLC kinase (MLCK), it is dephosphorylated by Ca2+-independent MLC phosphatase (MLCP)
  []. The receptors binding vasoactive peptides including norepinephrine, acetylcholine,
  serotonin, Ang II, ET-1, and TXA2 are coupled to GPCRs Gq and G11, and the subsequent
  stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC)-β and generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and
  protein kinase C (PKC) activates numerous plasma membrane Ca2+ channels and promotes
  calcium influx resulting in the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation of MLCK [].
  Stimulated PLC-β also stimulates the second messenger inositol triphosphatase (IP3)
  and induces the intracellular Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).
  The receptors of vasoconstrictors such as Ang II, ET-1, and TXA2 are coupled to
  G12 and G13 to activate the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway, resulting
  in the inhibition of myosin phosphatase [,]. G12- and G13-mediated activation of
  RhoA is induced by a subgroup of Rho GEFs, which are activated directly through
  the interaction with Gα12 and Gα13 []. GEFs promote the exchange of guanosine diphosphate
  (GDP) to guanosine triphosphatase (GTP). The inactivation of the GTPase is induced
  by the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (GDI) inhibits
  dissociation of GDP from Rho and hydrolysis of GTP by GAP and keeps Rho in an inactive
  state []. In the Ca2+ sensitization of myosin phosphorylation, Rho activates ROCK,
  and ROCK stimulates phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1),
  a regulatory subunit of MLCP. Phosphorylation of MYPT1 inhibits the binding of MLCP
  to MLC and sustains MLCP phosphorylation to promote contraction. ROCK also inhibits
  MLCP by phosphorylating the C-kinase-enhancing protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor molecular
  weight 17 kDa (CPI-17), a smooth muscle-specific inhibitor of MLCP that is activated
  via the DAG-PLC-PKC pathway [].

  description: Mechanism of Rho-associated salt-sensitive hypertension in vascular
    smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and representative vasoactive peptide coupling to
