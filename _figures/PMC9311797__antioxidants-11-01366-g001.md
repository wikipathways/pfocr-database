caption: SARS-CoV-2 infection interferes with the bidirectional flux of cellular thiols
  (cystine-cysteine cycle) and glutathione metabolism. Cells actively control their
  redox state and the redox homeostasis of the extracellular environment, synthesizing
  the tripeptide glutathione and maintaining it in its reduced form (GSH). This latter
  process relies on the glycolytic activity of the Pentose Phosphate Shunt (PPP) that
  supports reducing equivalents (under the form of the pyridine coenzyme NADPH) to
  GSH-reductase (GR). The de novo biosynthesis process of glutathione depends on the
  cellular availability of Cys. Adequate Cys levels are provided through the diet
  and the trans-sulfuration pathway and reach the cells by means of the cystine-cysteine
  cycle. This cycle and the efflux mechanisms of cellular thiols maintain GSH, Cys,
  and the other LMW thiols available in the extracellular milieu for the reaction
  with protein thiols (left insert) and for the intercellular metabolism of GSH. At
  the same time, this cycle participates in the homeostatic control of the redox gradient
  existing between cells and extracellular fluids of tissues (right insert). The viral
  replication process implies an increased incorporation of cellular Cys in the viral
  proteins, thus reducing its availability for the biosynthesis of GSH and the redistribution
  of cellular thiols to the extracellular compartment. Aging conspires with SARS-CoV-2
  infection to promote these changes in the metabolism of thiols, which may increase
  the risk of degenerative complications and severe COVID-19.
