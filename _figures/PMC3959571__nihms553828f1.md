caption: 'Q6 biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae proceeds from either 4HB or pABA. The classic
  Q biosynthetic pathway is shown in blue emanating from 4HB (4-hydroxybenzoic acid).
  R represents the hexaprenyl tail present in Q6 and all intermediates. The numbering
  of the aromatic carbon atoms used throughout this study is shown on the reduced
  form of Q6, Q6H2. Coq1p synthesizes the hexaprenyldiphosphate tail, which is transferred
  by Coq2p to 4HB to form HHB (3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid). Alternatively,
  the red pathway indicates that pABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) is prenylated by Coq2p
  to form HAB (3-hexaprenyl-4-aminobenzoic acid). Both HHB and HAB are early Q6-intermediates,
  readily detected in each of the coq null strains (Δcoq3-Δcoq9). Subsequent ring
  modification steps are thought to occur in the sequences shown, including hydroxylation
  by Coq6 in concert with ferredoxin (Yah1) and ferredoxin reductase (Arh1). Coq3
  performs the two O-methylation steps, Coq5 the C-methylation step, and Coq7 performs
  the penultimate hydroxylation step. The functional roles of the Coq4, Coq8, and
  Coq9 polypeptides are elaborated in this study. Coq8p over-expression (hcCOQ8) in
  certain Δcoq strains leads to the accumulation of novel intermediates [], suggesting
  these branched pathways. For example, in the presence of hcCOQ8, coq6 or coq9 mutants
  accumulate 4-AP (derived from pABA), and 4-HP (derived from 4HB) [], indicating
  that in some cases decarboxylation and hydroxylation at position 1 of the ring may
  precede the Coq6 hydroxylation step. Purple dotted arrows designate the replacement
  of the C4-amine with a C4-hydroxyl and correspond to a proposed C4-deamination/deimination
  reaction, resulting in a convergence of the 4HB and pABA pathways. A putative mechanism
  to replace the C4-imino group with the C4-hydroxy group is shown in purple brackets
  for IDMQ6 but could also occur on IDDMQ6 (not shown). Several steps defective in
  the Δcoq9 strain are designated with red asterisks. Intermediates previously detected
  are shown in bold: 4-AP (3-hexaprenyl-4-aminophenol); DDMQ6H2, the reduced form
  of demethyl-demethoxy-Q6; DMQ6, demethoxy-Q6; DMQ6H2, demethoxy-Q6H2 (the reduced
  form of DMQ6); HHAB, 3-hexaprenyl-5-hydroxy-4-aminobenzoic acid; HMAB, 3-hexaprenyl-5-methoxy-4-aminobenzoic
  acid; 4-HP (3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxyphenol); IDMQ6, (4-imino-demethoxy-Q6); IDMQ6H2,
  4-amino-demethoxy-Q6H2 (the reduced form of IDMQ6). Intermediates shown in parentheses
  indicate that they have not yet been detected: DHAP, 5-hydroxy-4-aminohexaprenylphenol;
