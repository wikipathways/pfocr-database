caption: Mechanisms underlying our results. Astaxanthin (Ax) decreased the severity
  of experimental steatohepatitis via mechanisms likely to involve the up‐regulation
  of FGF21/PGC‐1α. Treatment with astaxanthin substantially ameliorated mitochondrial
  biogenesis and functionality by restoring the OXPHOS complexes and ATP levels, which
  reduced ROS production and increased the mtDNA copy number. Thus, astaxanthin alleviated
  inflammation, cell apoptosis and fibrosis induced by lipid overload
