caption: The impact of a negative regulator on pathogenesis and the development of
  sepsis, secondary to acute insults. Sepsis is a condition that results from a harmful
  or damaging host response to infection. The principal mechanism is that LPS is sensed
  via an LBP–LPS complex and then signaled through the TLR4-MD2 complex. NF-κB plays
  a central role in regulating the transcription of cytokines, adhesion molecules,
  and other mediators involved in sepsis. Recently, it has been proposed that anti-inflammatory
  effect of lots of important regulators during anti-bacterial response resulted from
  suppression of T-cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production most
  likely due to inhibition of NF-κB/p50 transcription and subsequent reduction of
  NF-κB activity. These include TIPE2, A20, HSP, CD163, and so on. LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  LBP, LPS-binding protein; AP-1, activator protein-1; MD2, myeloid differential protein
  2; MyD88, Myeloid differential factor 88; IRAK, interleukin receptor associated
  kinase; HIF-1α, hypoxia inducible factor-1α; TRAF, TNF receptor associated factor.
