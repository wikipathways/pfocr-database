caption: 'PD-1 signaling in T cells and macrophages. A Mechanisms of PD-1 signaling
  in T cells. PD-1 inhibits T cell function by recruiting phosphatases SHP-1/SHP-2
  to the ITIM/ITSM domain in the PD-1 tail and increasing the expression of transcription
  factor BATF. In addition, PD-1 inhibitory signaling antagonizes positive T cell
  signaling events triggered by (1) TCR interacting with MHC and (2) CD28 interacting
  with CD80. (3) PD-1 signaling inhibits ZAP70 and the RAS-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
  pathways. B Mechanisms of PD-1 signaling in macrophages. PD-1 inhibits macrophage
  function by recruiting phosphatases SHP-1/SHP-2 to the ITIM/ITSM domain in the PD-1
  tail, leading to inhibition of the PI3K-NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, PD-1
  signaling suppresses IFN-γ-activated M1 macrophage polarization by reducing the
  phosphorylation of STAT1 and the secretion of IL-12, while promoting IL-4-activated
  M2 macrophage polarization by increasing STAT6 phosphorylation. Red lines ending
  in a bar represent inhibitory signaling, and black arrows indicate positive signaling.
