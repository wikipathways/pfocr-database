caption: Functional cycle of the Ca2+-ATPase from the SERCA, with an indication of
  the steps that probably are subject to modulation by noncovalently bound ATP. The
  upper part of the branched pathway for processing of the HnE2-ATP intermediate shows
  the classical scheme (binding of Ca2+ followed by binding of ATP), whereas the lower
  branch, retaining the previously bound ATP, shows a more direct pathway to the Ca2E1-ATP
  intermediate, that precedes phosphorylation of the ATPase.
