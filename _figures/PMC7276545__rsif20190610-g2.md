caption: Examples of life science networks. (a) Protein–protein interaction networks.
  Transient interactions occur in signalling pathways. Shown is the RAS signalling
  pathway, which is initiated by a tyrosine kinase located in the cell membrane. Each
  protein of the pathway activates the next one and eventually causes particular reactions
  in the cell; each cascade can lead to a different outcome such as cell survival,
  apoptosis or membrane trafficking. (b) Metabolic networks. They represent a series
  of biochemical reactions within cells. Shown is the citric acid cycle (adapted from
  []), which is important for gaining energy from food (carbohydrates, fat, proteins),
  which are metabolized via oxidation of acetyl-CoA into ATP and CO2. (c) Gene regulatory
  networks. Shown is an abstract example of a TF that is binding to the promoter of
  a target gene to turn on its expression. From the genomic information of the target,
  a messenger RNA (mRNA) is created that gets translated into a protein. If that protein
  is another TF, it can turn on the expression of another target gene and so on. (d)
  Ecological networks. Shown is a food web with producers (plants), preys, predators
  and detriments. Nutrients from one organism are used to gain nutrients and energy
  by the next one in the cycle. (e) Disease networks. Shown is the genetic and functional
  overlap between several diseases. CMTD, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease; SAP, spastic
  ataxia paraplegia; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; SMA, spinal muscular atrophy;
  SSPS, silver spastic paraplegia syndrome; LD, lipodystrophy. (f) Psychometrics networks.
  Shown is an abstract example in which symptoms of two disorders (blue and green)
  mainly cluster by disorder, albeit with a bridge symptom (S5—salmon node) that occurs
  in both disorders.
