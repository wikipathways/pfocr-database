caption: Pathway for synthesis of ceramide, sphingomyelin, and sphingosine-1 phosphate.
  (A) The de novo synthesis of ceramide starts with palmitoyl-CoA and serine in endoplasmic
  reticulum. Ceramide is then converted to sphingomyelin, which is the structural
  component of outer leaflet of plasma membrane. (B) Enhanced ceramide concentration
  in lungs results in inflammation and cell damage therefore dynamic balance of sphingosine/S1P/ceramide
  is important for pathological manifestation during TB infection.
