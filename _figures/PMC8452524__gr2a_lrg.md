caption: Potential of hsa-miRNAs in targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome, modulating the
  pro-inflammatory pathways, and reinforcing the IFNs-I-related ones. a) Based on
  the bioinformatics assessments, multiple hsa-miRNAs can preclude the generation
  of the viral proteins including nsps, ORFs, and structural ones through targeting
  the SARS-CoV-2 genome leading to the removal of their inhibitory effects on IFNs-I
  production pathways and augmentation of antiviral defence. Moreover, the ability
  of a wide spectrum of these molecules has been confirmed in binding to the pro-inflammatory
  mRNAs. Targeting the proteins with a central role in cytokine storm development
  such as ADAM17, AT1R, IL-6, IL-6R, gp130, STAT3, NF-κB, etc. by hsa-miRNAs is followed
  by progression reduction of pro-inflammatory events and cessation of IL-6 Amp cycle.
  In addition, cPLA2, COX-I, -II, and mPGES-1 can be targeted by hsa-miRNAs contributing
  to the reduction of pro-inflammatory responses and virus replication. Most importantly,
  some hsa-miRNAs can reinforce the IFNs-I generation and antiviral defence through
  phosphorylation induction and nuclear translocation facilitation of IRF3 and IRF7.
  b) Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 proteins-coding genes by hsa-miRNAs leads to the elimination
  of their inhibitory effects on IFNs-I signaling pathways, higher expression of ISGs,
  and subsequently strengthening the antiviral defence. Moreover, the hsa-miRNAs with
  the capability of targeting the enzymes, involved in the eicosanoids production
  pathways, cause upregulation of ISGs expression and downregulation of ROS procreation
  resulting in the elevated efficiency of antiviral responses. Targeting each of pivotal
  pro-inflammatory molecules such as NLRP3, NF-κB, ADAM17, AT1R, TAB2 and 3, RhoB,
  MMP-9, etc. by hsa-miRNAs also provides the basis for abrogating the vicious cycle
  of pro-inflammatory reactions. Furthermore, the MyD88-independent pathway in TLR4
  signaling and the production of IFNs-I are augmented following the neutralizing
  of the SARS-CoV-2 genome by hsa-miRNAs leading to the limitation of cytokine storm
  development.
