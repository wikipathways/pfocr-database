caption: 'Possible mechanisms underlying modulation of TLR-induced DC activation by
  MARCO. Alternative scenarios by which MARCO may mediate dendritic cell (DC) activation
  via Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling: MARCO receptor interacts with TLRs expressed
  on the cell surface; MARCO binds ligands and brings them in close proximity to TLRs;
  MARCO shuttles ligands from the surface to the endosome to elicit TLR3, 7/8 and
  9 signaling; MARCO recruits Src-homology 2 domain (SH2)-containing (SHP-2) and induces
  inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and other downstream
  signaling events; MARCO expression results in modulation of tumor growth factor
  β) receptor (TGFβ) /SMAD pathway; MARCO-induced effect on gene expression results
  in morphologic changes that affect cell migration; MARCO-induced signals affect
  the DC inflammatory signature, subsequently impacting T-cell responses to their
  cognate antigens.'
