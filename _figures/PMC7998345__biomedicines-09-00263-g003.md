caption: 'CircRNA- and lncRNA-mediated regulation of therapeutic resistance in PaC.
  Tumor-suppressive lncRNAs in rounded rectangles are shown in blue. Oncogenic circRNA
  and lncRNA are indicated in red within rounded rectangles. Round brackets denote
  miRNAs, the signaling pathway, or a protein molecule affected by ncRNAs and then
  therapeutic agents influenced by ncRNAs. Activation is indicated by an arrow. Inhibition
  is denoted by a perpendicular line. GEM: gemcitabine; 5-FU: 5-fluorouracil; CIS:
  cisplatin.'
