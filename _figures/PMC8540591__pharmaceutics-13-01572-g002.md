caption: Schematic diagram of autophagy-derived regulation on the differentiation/function
  of osteoclast/osteoblast and osteoimmunology. On the one hand, autophagy can facilitate
  the differentiation/function of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts; on the other hand,
  autophagy induces the phenotype switch from M1 (inflammatory phenotype, which facilitating
  osteoclastogenesis by producing IL-6 and iNOS) to M2 (tissue-regenerative phenotype,
  which facilitating osteogenesis by producing IL-10 and TGF-β) in the macrophage
  population, thereby generating an immune microenvironment favoring bone formation.
  Furthermore, autophagy induction on osteoblasts can reduce osteoblast-originated
  RANKL production, hence, reducing osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the RANKL–RANK
  signaling pathway.
