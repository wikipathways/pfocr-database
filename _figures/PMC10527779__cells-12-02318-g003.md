caption: 'Schematic presentation of various common neuronal biochemical pathways perturbed
  or compromised in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, PD, and ALS.
  The key points in the pathway and the selected disease-associated proteins are demonstrated
  in this picture. 1. Protein Quality Control (PQC) proteostasis network: molecular
  chaperones, including heat shock proteins (Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp40), regulate protein
  folding and maturation. Ubiquitin-proteosome system (UPS) is a crucial protein degradation
  pathway and is important for PQC and homeostasis. Any defect in the PQC leads to
  neurodegeneration (AD, PD, ALS). Decline of proteostasis is the hallmark of ageing
  and it decreases with age, leading to the accumulation of toxic and non-functional
  aggregates. 2. Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway (a,b,c,d,e.): Perturbations throughout
  the pathway, from initiation of autophagosome formation to degradation in the autolysosomes,
  have been suggested to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases like AD, PD, and
  ALS and further, could build an accumulation of pathogenic and toxic protein aggregates
  and defective mitochondria. a. Autophagy initiation defects due to decreased expression
  of protein Beclin1 in case of AD. b. Loss of sequestration into autophagosomes due
  to mutations in the gene-encoding p62/optineurin in the case of ALS, and mitophagy
  defects due to mutations in the gene-encoding protein PINK1/Parkin in the case of
  PD c. Defects in the maturation of autophagosome are due to decreasing expression
  of PICLAM protein in the case of AD, whereas mutation in SIGMAR1 gene in the case
  of ALS. c. Defects in vesicle trafficking (lysosome to membrane) are due to the
  mutations in the gene-encoding protein dynactin/profilin in case of ALS. 3. Dysregulation
  of mitochondrial quality control (MQC): including a (mitochondrial damage), b (mitochondrial
  fusion and fission dynamics), c (selective autophagy of mitochondria called mitophagy)
  results in decreased ATP production and dysfunctional proteostasis network. 4. Axonal
  transport defects in AD, PD, and ALS and underlying mechanisms: Defective axonal
  transport is due to perturbed anterograde and retrograde transport mechanisms involving
  mitochondrial kinesin and endosomal transport protein dynein. Further, disrupted
  neurofilament (NF) in forms of phosphorylated NF in the case of AD, PD, and ALS
  and microtubules (including α-Tubulin and β-Tubulin) are involved in the impairment
  of transport across neurons. 5. Protein Seeding and Propagation: Dysfunction of
  Intracellular propagation and seeding of toxic protein aggregates involved in the
  disease progression in case of AD, PD, and ALS. Created with BioRender.com.'
