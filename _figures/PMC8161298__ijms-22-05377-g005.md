caption: An overview of the crosstalk between P53 and autophagy. Autophagy can repress
  P53 through the inhibition of upstream activating proteins as well as P53 itself.
  This forms a negative feedback loop (red) as P53 induces autophagy through the inhibition
  of the IGF–AKT–mTOR pathway and subsequent increase in BECLIN-1 levels, which plays
  a role in autophagosome formation. P53 also induces the expression of autophagy-related
  genes (ARG). Autophagy induces cell survival, which is effectuated by the binding
  of ATG7 to P53, ultimately leading to P53-dependent P21 expression and subsequent
  cell cycle arrest (green). The loss of ATG-7 results in apoptosis (blue), as P53
  induces the expression and activation of pro-apoptotic proteins. Apoptosis and autophagy
  have mutually inhibitory effects on one another.
