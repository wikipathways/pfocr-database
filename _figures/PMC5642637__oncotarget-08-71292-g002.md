caption: (A) Pro-oncogenic signaling of CD44, NNAT, the PI3K pathway, and KPNA4. CD44
  activates MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, potentially suppressing CHOP expression.
  NNAT mitigates ER stress while KPNA4 shuttles pro-oncogenic transcription factors
  (NF-kB, NICD) into the nucleus. Collectively, CD44, NNAT, the PI3K pathway, and
  KPNA4 promote invasion, proliferation, and survival in prostate cancer. (B) Proposed
  metformin anti-tumorigenic activities. Metformin increases miR-708-5p expression,
  possibly by inhibiting PI3K signaling, which in turn derepresses CHOP. Increased
  CHOP expression potentially promotes miR-708-5p expression in prostate cancer cells.
  (C) Restoration of miR-708-5p (exogenous source/long term metformin treatment) suppresses
  various pro-oncogenic signaling pathways. miR-708-5p directly targets KPNA4 to suppress
  transcription factor shuttling. miR-708-5p suppression of NNAT results in exacerbated
  ER stress. ER stress may further propagate CHOP and miR-708-5p expression through
  the UPR. PI3K signaling is mitigated through miR-708-5p targeting of CD44 and AKT2.
  miR-708-5p activities culminate with decreased invasion, proliferation, and survival
  in prostate cancer cells. Black solid lines indicate activation (arrows) or suppression
  (blocks) while red solid lines indicate miR-708-5p targeting. Dotted lines represent
  loss of signaling within a pathway.

    CD44 activates MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, potentially suppressing CHOP
    expression. NNAT mitigates ER stress while KPNA4 shuttles pro-oncogenic transcription
    factors (NF-kB, NICD) into the nucleus. Collectively, CD44, NNAT, the PI3K pathway,

    Proposed metformin anti-tumorigenic activities. Metformin increases miR-708-5p
    expression, possibly by inhibiting PI3K signaling, which in turn derepresses CHOP.
    Increased CHOP expression potentially promotes miR-708-5p expression in prostate
    cancer cells. (C) Restoration of miR-708-5p (exogenous source/long term metformin
    treatment) suppresses various pro-oncogenic signaling pathways. miR-708-5p directly
    targets KPNA4 to suppress transcription factor shuttling. miR-708-5p suppression
    of NNAT results in exacerbated ER stress. ER stress may further propagate CHOP
