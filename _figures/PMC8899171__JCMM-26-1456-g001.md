caption: Summary diagram/Graphical Abstract. A, Mechanisms of ERK‐induced smooth muscle
  cell contraction with ageing. (i) MLC Kinase is a Ca2+/Calmodulin‐dependent kinase
  and can be activated by increases in cytoplasmic ionized calcium ([Ca2+i]) levels,
  induced by depolarization or G‐protein‐coupled receptor‐mediated agonists, such
  as alpha adrenergic (α) agonists. (ii) agonists have also been demonstrated to promote
  the PKC‐dependent activation of MEK that subsequently phosphorylates ERK, resulting
  in its activation. ERK activation induces phosphorylation of the actin‐binding protein
  caldesmon, which releases its inhibitory action on actin, resulting in enhanced
  actomyosin cross‐bridge cycling. B, Diagrammatic summary of the effects of miR‐34a
  and −137 on ERK signalling. These miRs reduce the expression of both activators
  of and scaffolding proteins for ERK signalling. Src activates ERK through the direct
  phosphorylation of Raf.,  Paxillin functions as a scaffolding protein for the organization
  and activation of the ERK‐activating proteins FAK, Raf and MEK at focal adhesions
