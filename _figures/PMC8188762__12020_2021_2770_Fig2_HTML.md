caption: SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated Graves’ disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism).
  The illustration shows the outline of various factors and steps possibly involved
  in the SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated development of autoimmune hyperthyroidism,
  Graves’ disease. Specific lymphocyte production and pro-inflammatory pathway activation,
  and Treg downregulation may promote thyrocytes for the generation of thyroid antibodies
  that induce apoptosis, which leads to thyroiditis on one side, and on the other
  side, the antibodies trigger cell proliferation that results in hyperthyroidism
