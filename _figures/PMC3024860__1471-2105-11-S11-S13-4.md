caption: 'The Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis pathway of human (left) and C.parvum
  (right). The host gene expression response was indicated for each gene in the pathway.
  Each rectangle, standing for a enzyme in the pathway, is divided into five parts
  that represent five infection time points: 6, 12, 24, 48, 72hr after infection.
  Red color indicates an up-regulation of this enzyme at the corresponding time point,
  and blue indicates a down-regulation. The green background boxes indicate the ortholog
  genes shared by human host cell and C.parvum.'
