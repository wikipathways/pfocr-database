caption: Roles of ZBTB proteins in B-cell development, differentiation, and function.
  (A) A schematic view of the stages most affected by ZBTB proteins along the B-cell
  development program. ZBTB7A, ZBTB17, ZBTB1, and BCL6 regulate early B-cell development
  in the bone marrow, while ZBTB7A, BCL6, ZBTB17, ZBTB1, ZBTB20, ZBTB24, and ZBTB32
  function in mature B-cell compartments. Positive/negative regulators are indicated
  in red/blue, respectively. (B) Regulation of the IL-7R signaling pathway by ZBTB17
  in pre-pro-B cells. ZBTB17 plays a dual role by inducing BCL2 while repressing SOCS-1.
  (C) Transcriptional regulation of genes important for the GC-B or plasma cell (PC)
  development. Dotted lines represent data obtained in cell lines, and the in vivo
  functional relevance remains to be confirmed. Tran-B, transitional B cells; LL-PC,
  long-lived PC.
