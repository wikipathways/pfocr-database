caption: Diagram of major TLR pathways. Upon ligand binding and receptor dimerization,
  TLRs interact with a TIR domain-containing adaptor protein. (Left) Canonically,
  TLR signal transduction occurs through the MYD88-dependent pathway. (Right) In some
  cases, such as with TLR3 and TLR4, TLRs require other TIR domain-containing adaptors
  to signal successfully for cytokine expression. SARM1, a TIR domain-containing negative
  regulator for TCAM1-dependent signaling pathways, is not shown. Red ellipses denote
  conserved TIR domains.
