  description: Abnormal metabolic processes in melanocytes during oxidative stress.
    Oxidative stress triggered abnormal glycolipid metabolism within melanocytes,
    disrupting metabolic pathways. Melanocytes with mitochondrial disorders, abnormal
    melanin biosynthesis, and dysregulated metabolic pathway produce abnormal ROS,
    exacerbating oxidative stress. The orange-boxed portion of the figure shows outlier
    segments, as reported in recent literature. In addition, melanocytes interact
    with different immune cells in innate and adaptive immunity, leading to melanocyte
