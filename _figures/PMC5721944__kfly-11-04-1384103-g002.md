caption: Hypothetical schematic connecting basal IP3R mediated Ca2+ release to protein
  translation, via AMPK and the TOR signalling pathway. Basal transfer of Ca2+ from
  the ER to the inner mitochondria via Porin and Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU),
  promotes ATP synthesis and inhibits phosphorylation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK).
  Reduced IP3R mediated Ca2+ release decreases ATP production, leading to increased
  levels of AMP and ADP, that activates AMPK, which inhibits protein synthesis via
  its negative regulation of the TOR pathway. Thus, even under nutrient-rich conditions,
  overall protein synthesis levels would be lower in cells with reduced IP3R function.
  However, cell survival is not affected as nutrients can keep the insulin/TOR signalling
  pathway active, thereby over-riding the inhibitory effects of pAMPK on protein synthesis.
  In conditions where both nutrients are withdrawn as well as IP3R function is compromised,
  the net reduction in protein synthesis assumes physiological significance.
