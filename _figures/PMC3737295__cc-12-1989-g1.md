caption: Figure 1. Model of glucose-TOR signaling in transcriptional regulation of
  cell cycle. Leaf photosynthesis-derived glucose is indispensable for activating
  TOR kinase via glycolysis and mitochondrial bioenergetic relay to control a host
  of effectors and transcription factors for the concerted activation of the proliferation
  of progenitor and stem cells in meristems. ETC, electron transport chain; RGF, root
  growth factors; UPB1, UPBEAT1 transcription factor; GSH, the glutathione synthesis
  pathway; TFs, transcription factors.
