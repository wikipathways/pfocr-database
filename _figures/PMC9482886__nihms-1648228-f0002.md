caption: 'AMPK and signaling via PI 3-K/Akt, for example by growth factors, act as
  antagonistic modulators of the mTOR pathway to control cell phenotype. AMPK activates
  the TSC1/TSC2 complex to drive conversion of Rheb-GTP, an activator of the mTORC1
  complex, to Rheb-GDF. This conversion effectively inhibits mTORC1 complex activity
  (which includes mTOR and associated proteins) and thus suppresses mTOR pathway function.
  Akt is inhibitory to TSC1/TSC2 thus suppressing formation of Rheb-GDP and enhancing
  mTORC1 activation. The mTOR pathway when active drives protein synthesis (including
  ribosome biogenesis), nucleotide and lipid synthesis. mTOR activation is a negative
  regulator of autophagy and acts antagonistically to AMPK, which also acts as a direct
  activator of autophagy. The mobilization of these anabolic pathways augmented cell
  growth and proliferation under conditions of sufficient energy and metabolite supply.
  AMPK activation, via detection of lowered energy and metabolite supply, suppresses
  these activities toward a more catabolic phenotype. Abbreviations: 4E-BP1, translation
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; Akt, protein kinase B; AT4, activating transcription
