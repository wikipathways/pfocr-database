caption: '(A) Basic idea of DoL: a two-step pathway converting a substrate S to a
  product P via the two reactions R1 (catalyzed by enzyme E1) and R2 (catalyzed by
  enzyme E2) in a single strain is split into two parts each being performed by one
  dedicated strain. (B) Assuming an identical total amount of biomass, the metabolic
  burden (enzyme cost per biomass) is identical for the single strain and the DoL
  solution.'
