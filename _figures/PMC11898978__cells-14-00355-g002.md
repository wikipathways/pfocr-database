caption: Tissue fragmentation and mechanical manipulation disrupt the ovarian Hippo
  signaling pathway, promoting follicle growth. In dormant primordial follicles, Hippo
  signaling maintains follicular quiescence by activating the MST1/2-SAV1 and LATS1/2
  kinases, which phosphorylate YAP/TAZ in pre-granulosa cells (pre-GCs), leading to
  their cytoplasmic retention or degradation. This prevents YAP/TAZ from interacting
  with TEAD transcription factors, thereby suppressing growth-promoting gene expression.
  Ovarian fragmentation disrupts Hippo signaling by inducing actin polymerization,
  allowing YAP/TAZ to translocate into the nucleus. Once inside, YAP/TAZ proteins
  bind to TEADs to upregulate CCN growth factors and BIRC apoptosis inhibitors, stimulating
  granulosa cell proliferation, enhancing follicular survival, and promoting follicle
  activation. Created with BioRender.com
