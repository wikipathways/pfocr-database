  cycle. The size of the pie chart represents the relative abundance of the metabolic
  pathway. Arrows indicate chemical reaction pathways. The direction of the arrows
  is from substrate to product in the chemical reaction. Different colors represent
  different pathways. Bidirectional arrows indicate reversible chemical reaction pathways.
  Dashed arrows indicate that there is no relevant gene (KO) information, hence there
  is no abundance for this pathway, and no pie chart is drawn. Arrows without pie
  charts represent that no relevant genes (KO) for this pathway were detected in the
  sample'
