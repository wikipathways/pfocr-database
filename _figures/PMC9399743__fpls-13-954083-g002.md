caption: 'Engineering approaches utilizing metabolic channeling for improved terpenoid
  formation. (A) Enzyme fusion strategy: fusion of prenyltransferases (GGPPS, FPPS)
  with phytoene synthase (PSY) and terpene synthases (epi-aristolochene synthase EAS,
  amorpha-4,11-diene synthase ADS), respectively, leads to increased substrate (IPP,
  DMAPP) conversion to product formation. (B) Synthetic scaffold protein strategy:
  scaffold proteins carry multiple protein-protein interaction domains (GBD, SH3,
  PDZ) in various ratios (x: y: z) to organize multiple sequential pathway enzymes
  (e.g., AACT, HMGS, HMGR) tagged with specific small peptide ligands (indicated by
  a square, triangle and circle) to increase metabolic flux through a pathway. (C)
  Lipid droplet strategy: engineered cytosolic lipid droplets serve as scaffold to
  co-localize terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes, e.g., diterpene synthase abietadiene
  synthase (ABS), cytochrome P450 (CYP), and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), that
  are expressed as fusion constructs with a lipid droplet surface protein (LDSP).
  It will result in increased production of terpenoid compounds (e.g., diterpenes)
  and additionally in their sequestration in the engineered lipid droplets.'
