caption: The overview of Hippo-YAP1/TAZ pathway and its role in cardiac biology. The
  Hippo-YAP1/TAZ pathway mainly consists of MST1/2, SAV1, LATS1/2, MOB1 and two downstream
  effectors. The Hippo pathway, as conserved pathway in organ-size control, plays
  pivotal role in cardiomyocyte growth, cardiac development, cardiac disease and so
  on. Line arrows indicate activation, whereas dotted lines mean translocation.
