  oncogenic activation or LKB1 loss of function are known to control glucose metabolism,
  partly via AMPK. However, the co-occurrence of these oncogenic events in pancreatic
  cancer leads to increased de novo serine biosynthesis from glucose and to hyper-methylation
  and transcriptional silencing of retrotransposon elements. These events are required
  for tumorigenesis and hence they generate dependencies on serine biosynthesis and
  DNA methylation processes and, with that, potential stratified therapeutic strategies.
  Red or green boxes indicate proteins that are activated or inhibited, respectively.
