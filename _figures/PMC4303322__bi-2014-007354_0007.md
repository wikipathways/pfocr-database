caption: Model for effects of the clock on apoptosis. Circadian regulation of the
  extrinsic pathway occurs via regulation of the synthesis of TNFα and the phosphorylation
  of GSK3β, both of which regulate NF-kB signal transduction to caspase 8, which in
  turn activates executioner caspases, including caspase 3. In the intrinsic pathway,
  DNA damage causes the upregulation of p73 (in a circadian-regulated manner), which
  activates transcription of Bax and Bak causing the release of cytochrome c (c) from
  the mitochondria, apoptosome assembly, and the eventual cleavage and activation
  of transducer caspase 9, which in turn cleaves and activates executioner caspase
  3.
