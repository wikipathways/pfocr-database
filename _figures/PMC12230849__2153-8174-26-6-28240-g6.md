caption: 'Autophagy in VSMCs and its influencing factors. VSMCs exhibit  three autophagy
  modes: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated  autophagy. In VSMCs,
  cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH)-hydrogen sulfide (H2S) increases VSMC autophagy
  through sulfhydration,  hydration, and activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB).
  The activation of P2RY12 downregulates the  expression of ATG5, inhibiting the formation
  of autophagosomes in VSMCs. Small  heat shock protein Hsp27 promotes autophagy to
  exert its anti-atherosclerosis  effect. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) inhibits DUSP5
  and autophagy related proteins  (LC3 II/I, p62 and Beclin 1), and increases the
  expression levels of H19,  p-ERK1/2, and p-mTOR to inhibit autophagy of VSMCs in
  AS. miR-130a inhibits VSMC  autophagy by inhibiting ATG2B. Downregulation of miR-145-5p
  promotes the  expression of CAMkiδ and development of AS by activating autophagy
  in  human VSMCs through the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway. lncRNA CTBP1-AS2  promotes
  the expression of ATG14 and autophagy of VSMCs by inhibiting miR-195-5p.  Capsaicin
  induces autophagy by activating transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily
  V member 1 (TRPV1). The red arrow represents promotion, the blue round head represents
  inhibition, the black arrow represents up-regulation or down-regulation, and the
  gray arrow represents the direction of the process. Created by Figdraw'
