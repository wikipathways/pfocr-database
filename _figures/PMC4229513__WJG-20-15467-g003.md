caption: 'Outline of the targeted therapies, which are currently available or under
  development for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, and the molecular targets
  on which they are believed to act upon. AKT: A protein kinase family of genes involved
  in regulation of cell survival, Bcl-2-associated agonist of cell death promoter
  (BAD), Bcl-2-associated death promoter; Disheveled (DSH) protein, downstream effector
  Disheveled; EGF: Epidermal growth factor; EGFR: EGF receptor; ERK: Extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; Frizzled: A family of G-protein coupled receptor proteins
  that serve as receptors in the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway; once activated:
  Frizzled leads to activation of Disheveled in the cytoplasm; GSK-3β: Glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β; HER2/neu: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, a cell membrane surface-bound
  receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in the signal transduction pathways leading
  to cell growth and differentiation; MEK: Kinases that phosphorylate mitogen activated
  protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK); mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin; PDGFR: Platelet-derived
  growth factor receptor; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; PTEN: Phosphatase and
  tensin homolog, regulates cell-survival pathway; RAF: A MAP kinase kinase kinase
  (MAP3K) that functions in the MAPK/ERK signal transduction pathway; a serine/threonine-specific
  kinase; RAS: Prototypical member of the RAS superfamily of proteins; activation
  of RAS signaling causes cell growth, differentiation and survival; the dysregulation
  of RAS signaling can lead to oncogenesis and cancer.'
