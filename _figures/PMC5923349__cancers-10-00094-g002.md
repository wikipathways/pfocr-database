caption: Overview of the Hippo signaling pathway in modifying the anti-neoplastic
  immune response. The Hippo pathway effectors YAP/TAZ regulate gene targets that
  direct immune cell function. Cytokines upregulated by YAP including CXCL5 and TNFα
  recruit myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MSDCs) to the tumour microenvironment
  while others (CSF1 and CCL2) direct tumour-associated macrophage (TAM) M2 polarization.
  YAP/TAZ act downstream of Hippo signaling (as well as GPCR signaling) to directly
  enhance PD-L1 expression and disrupt T cell function through PD-L1/PD-1 binding.
  Finally, LATS, YAP and TAZ affect the nucleic acid content of extracellular vesicles
  that modify Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, the type 1 interferon (IFN) response
  and antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs). Interactions that have been described
  in human cells are shown in colour while those that have been demonstrated in murine
  cell lines are shown in greyscale.
