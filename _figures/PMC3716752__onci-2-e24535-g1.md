caption: Figure 1. Genes with variants associated with ovarian cancer survival. Normal
  functions of genes involved in the biology of regulatory T cells (Tregs) are shown.
  (A) Tregs express more RGS1 than effector T cells (Teffs), resulting in reduced
  chemotactic migration. SNPs in RGS1 may increase the responsiveness of Tregs to
  chemotactic signals, allowing them to accumulated within tumors and to establish
  an immunosuppressive microenvironment. (B) Garpin (GARP) is a surface-bound receptor
  for latency-associated peptide (LAP)-bound transforming growth factor β (TGFβ).
  TGFβ-bound GARP can promote the acquisition of a regulatory phenotype by naïve T
  cells (Tnaïve) cells, hence converting them in induced Tregs (iTregs) and upregulate
  the transcription factor FOXP3 in Tregs. SNPs in LRRC32 (encoding GARP) may increase
  its expression levels, stability or activation status, resulting in the propagation
  of an immunosuppressive phenotype in the microenvironment of mucinous tumors. (C)
  The ligation of OX40 on the surface of Tregs results in decreased FOXP3 expression
  and limits their survival. SNPs in TNFRSF4 (encoding OX40) may abrogate this process,
  resulting in increased Treg survival and functions in mucinous tumors. GITR ligation
  may affect Tregs directly or indirectly. The ligation of GITR expressed on Tregs
  increases their proliferation and immunosuppressive functions. The activation of
  GITR expressed on effector T cells also increases their proliferation, which in
  turn can prevent the expansion of Tregs. SNPs in TNFRSF18 (encoding GITR) may increase
  GITR levels or activity, amplifying the immunosuppressive phenotype of mucinous
  tumors. Alternatively, SNPs in TNFRSF18 may reduce downstream Teff functions, resulting
  in decreased tumor clearance. (D) CD80 expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
  can bind CTLA4 on the surface of Tregs, triggering multiple mechanisms of immunosuppression,
  including a decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation
  of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway. SNPs affecting CD80 may increase
  the affinity of CD80 for CTLA4 in endometrioid tumors, while SNPs in MAD1L1 (which
  are linked to CD80 expression), may influence the CD80 levels in ovarian cancer
  patients at large.
