caption: Intrahepatic network and metabolic signaling in NAFLD. The most important
  reason for the alteration of the metabolic signaling network in the liver is the
  abnormalities in the hepatic lipid synthesis pathway and/or lipid metabolism pathway,
  which leads to the abnormal accumulation of intrahepatic lipids, the generation
  of large amounts of lipotoxic substances in the liver, affects multiple metabolic
  pathways, disrupts the mitochondrial homeostasis, inhibits the clearance of lipid
  autophagy, and promotes the ER stress. DNL, Lipid de novo synthesis; GLUT 2, Glucose
