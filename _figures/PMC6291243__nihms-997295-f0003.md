caption: Biosynthesis of the ADR-GlyU disaccharide core 17a. Enzymes from the 4 biosynthetic
  pathway (annotated as Lip proteins in bold) were previously functionally assigned
  using the probable native substrates with the lone exception being LipN, which was
  characterized using a surrogate sugar acceptor, uridine. The Mur proteins involved
  in 7-9 biosynthesis have moderate sequence homology to the corresponding Lip protein
  and hence putatively catalyze the same reaction.
