caption: Key signalling pathways involved in muscle atrophy and hypertrophy. Resistance
  exercise training and muscle disuse (e.g. following injury and/or bed rest) stimulate
  muscle hypertrophy (green arrows) and atrophy (red arrows), respectively, and are
  dependent on positive and negative regulation of a number of key signalling pathways.
  Resistance training can increase skeletal muscle hypertrophy by activating the Akt
  and mTOR signalling pathways via both IGF-1 signalling and mechanical stimulation
  of cell membrane integrins. Activated mTOR increases muscle protein synthesis by
  phosphorylating a range of key protein substrates, such as GSK-3β, p70S6K and 4E-BP1.
  In contrast, muscle disuse results in atrophy by increasing myostatin expression,
  that in turn, regulates downstream myostatin signalling pathways. Myostatin negatively
  regulates muscle protein synthesis by inhibiting the Akt pathway, which in turn
  negatively regulates the mTOR signalling pathway via TSC1/2 and Rheb. Increased
  myostatin also leads to FOXO translocation to the cell nucleus, increasing transcription
  of genes involved in muscle protein breakdown. Simultaneously, myostatin signalling
  inhibits satellite cell proliferation and differentiation by inhibiting MRF4 and
  activating the Smad2/Smad3 complex, switching on genes involved in muscle wasting
  and leading to muscle fibrosis. Akt, protein kinase B; 4E-BP1, eukaryotic initiation

  description: Key signalling pathways involved in muscle atrophy and hypertrophy.
    Resistance exercise training and muscle disuse (e.g. following injury and/or bed
