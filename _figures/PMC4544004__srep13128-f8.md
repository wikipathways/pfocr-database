caption: Green arrows shows that TRIF- and MyD88-dependent paths cannot be activated
  simultaneously due to shared binding sites on TLR4-dimer or steric hindrance. Blue
  arrows demonstrate that TRAF6 and TRAF3 bind to overlapping interfaces on MyD88
  DD (downstream of endosomal TLRs). Pink arrows shows that IRAK4 and FADD will have
  steric clash when they bind to MyD88 at the same time. The three branches of TLR
  pathway, namely pro-inflammatory, interferon and anti-inflammatory, and apoptotic
  paths are mutually exclusive.
