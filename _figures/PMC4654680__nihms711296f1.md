caption: Schematic of a subset of the Hippo pathway with known roles in the liver.
  The primary activity of the Hippo pathway is to restrict yorkie (YAP in mammals)
  to the cytoplasm. Reduced activity of the Hippo pathway results in translocation
  of yorkie to the nucleus where it binds to the TEAD family of transcription factors
  to upregulate gene expression. Known target genes of the pathway in Drosophila and
  Mammals are indicated after the arrowhead in the nucleus. Known roles for the pathway
  are indicated below the diagram of the transcriptional element.A. The Hippo pathway
  in Drosophila. Colored shapes represent known effectors of the Hippo pathway. Selected
  effectors have homologous partners in mammals that are associated with liver proliferation/cancer.
  These are color/shape-matched for clarity.B. The Hippo pathway in Mammals. Colored
  shapes represent known effectors of liver proliferation/cancer in the mammals. Open/dotted
  shapes represent potential/expected partners of the Hippo pathway that have yet
  to be functionally demonstrated in the liver, but have evidence from other tissues
  for their interaction.
