caption: In the traditional pyroptosis pathway, cells activate the formation of inflammatory
  vesicles such as NLRP3 in response to danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
  and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), as well as a decrease in potassium
  ions. This activates caspase-1, which then binds to GSDMD, resulting in the release
  of pore-forming activated GSDMD-N, ultimately leading to rupture of the plasma membrane.
  In contrast, in the non-traditional pathway, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers caspase4/5/11
  to initiate cellular focal death. Additionally, cysteinyl aspartic acid protease
  8 activates caspase3 in response to death signals, which then binds to GSDME, initiating
  cell death
