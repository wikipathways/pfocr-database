caption: 'IL-17 and Th17 involvement in vasculitis. (A): Large vessel vasculitis (LVV)
  include giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK) and are characterized
  by a chronic granulomatous inflammatory reaction. Vascular adventitial dendritic
  cells are activated and induce the recruitment, the activation and the polarization
  of CD4+ T cells. Among CD4+ T cells, T-helper (Th)-17 cells and Th1 cells are involved
  in the local inflammatory process. Then, CD8+T cells and monocytes are recruited
  and finally, vascular remodeling occurs. Th17 cells are also circulating and patients
  harbor increased frequency of them. IL-17A promotes neutrophil recruitment. There
  is a decrease of regulatory T (Treg) cells at the expense of the Th17 lineage. (B):
  Medium vessel vasculitis (MVV) comprise polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and Kawasaki
  disease (KD). There are few data on Th17 involvement in PAN pathogenesis but patients
  harbor defective Tregs and increased frequency of Th17 cells. KD is characterized
  by necrotizing arteritis with neutrophil infiltration. Lymphocytes, eosinophils
  and myofibroblastic proliferation participate in KD arteriopathy. Th17 cells and
  their related cytokines are increased in KD and there is a dysregulation of the
  Th17/Treg balance. (C): Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis
  (AAV) are composed of three variants: microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis
  with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). They
  are characterized by fibrinoid necrosis, thrombus formation and immune cell infiltration.
  GPA and EGPA are associated with granulomatous inflammatory reaction where Th17,
  Th1 cells and macrophages play a role. EGPA is characterized by the involvement
  of eosinophils, Th2 cells and their related cytokines. GPA and MPA, and sometimes
  EGPA, are associated with ANCA. There is a loss of B and T tolerance toward MPO
  and PR3 antigens, that are found primary in neutrophils. PR3 and MPO-specific Th17
  responses occur in the course of the disease. IL-17A also favors the recruitment
  of neutrophils at the site of injury. There is a dysregulated Th17/Treg cells balance.
  (D): Variable vessel vasculitis (VVV) can affect any type and any size of vessels.
  Enhanced innate immune response, early tissue infiltration and late adaptive immunity
  are the different steps that occurred in Behçet’s disease (BD) pathogenesis. This
  results in thrombosis, occlusion and aneurysms. Th17 cells are found at the site
  of tissue injury and interact with other immune cells. There is an hyperactivation
  of Th17 and Th1 cells at the expense of Treg population.'
