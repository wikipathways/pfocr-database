  overview of the re-programmed actinorhodin pathway where ActVI-2, ActVI-4, ActVA-5,
  ActVB (native Act pathway enzymes) were functionally replaced with enzymes Med-9,
  Med-29, Med-7, Med-13 respectively (from medermycin biosynthetic pathway) to test
  the programmability of the heterologous pathway. Enzymes are listed in blue and
  Act pathway enzymes which were replaced in grey; enzymes which were newly integrated
  in to yeast genome shown in red. Blue arrows depict chemical reactions catalysed
  by listed enzymes and produced compounds are depicted in blue or red shade. (B)
  Chromatograms from comparative LC-MS metabolomics showing investigated metabolites
  in reprogrammed yeast strains. Main products or intermediates were investigated
  by LC-MS: bicyclic intermediate, (S)-chiral alcohol, (S)-hemiketal, (S)-DNPA, dihydrokalafungin
  (DHK). Metabolites from the natural actinorhodin producer S. coelicolor (abbreviated
  Strep) was used as a standard (positive control) for comparing metabolites produced
  in wt and engineered yeast strains: TC-3, TC-158, TC-175, TC-177. Red vertical lines
  on chromatograms depict the peaks of listed compounds based on known mass and positive
  control. Intensities of the peaks and elution times are shown on the corresponding
  axis.'
