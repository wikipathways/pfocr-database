caption: 'A potential mechanism of radiation-induced abscopal effect. Radiation triggers
  the release of nuclear DNA into the cytoplasm, and cGAS can recognize the damaged
  DNA and activate the cGAS-STING pathway to induce the secretion of IFN-I that can
  bind to the cell surface receptor INFR to activate the axis of Janus kinase/signal
  transducer and activator of transcription/interferon regulatory factor (JAK/STAT/IRF).
  Meanwhile, the DNA damage also stimulates the ATM/ATR/Chk1 signaling followed by
  the STAT-IRF pathway. The phosphorylated STAT/IRF complex can be translocated to
  the nucleus and targets the promoter of PD-L1 to boost the expression of PD-L1.
  Alternatively, the expression of PD-L1 is upregulated by EGFR receptor activation
  through JAK/STAT signaling upon radiation. The combination of anti-PD-L1 and PD-L1
  breaks the connection between PD-L1 and PD-1, making tumor cells unable to escape
  from the immune supervision of T cells. Abbreviations: cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase;
  STING, stimulator of interferon genes; IFN-I, type I interferon; PD-L1, programmed
  death ligand 1; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor.'
