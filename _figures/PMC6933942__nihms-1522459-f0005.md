caption: Activation of S1PR1 signaling stimulates IL-1β expression and induces NLRP3
  inflammasome-dependent post-translational processing of IL-1β. In turn, mature IL-1β
  promotes further proinflammatory cytokine production and activation of endogenous
  production of S1P through activation of SphK1. The release of S1P forms a “feed-forward”
  loop of additional enhancement of proinflammatory cytokine and S1P formation that
  ultimately leads to the development of mechano-hypersensitivity. Strategies that
  disrupt this loop and shift the spinal cord toward an anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective
  state.
