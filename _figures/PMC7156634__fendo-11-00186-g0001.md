caption: Graphical Abstract of the proposed signaling scheme. Oxytocin binds its receptor,
  which transactivates different types of calcium channels, leading to calcium influx
  from the extracellular space. Calcium activates protein kinase C, and subsequent
  MAPK pathway activation, i.e., MEK1/2-ERK1/2, which translocates to the nucleus
  and activates the transcription factor CREB. Calcium also activates the calcium-dependent
  phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates and therefore activates MEF2. Active
  MEF2 increases gene transcription of negative regulators of synaptic structures,
  causing decreased neurite outgrowth, synapse number, and hypoconnectivity between
  neighboring neurons. As oxytocin receptor positive neurons are located within brain
  regions of the salience network, MEF2 activity regulates the connectivity within
  those regions, dampening or increasing the activity in the whole network. Depending
  on the emotional context of external stimuli, those changes in the salience network
  can cause alleviating or adverse behavioral responses. The schematic art pieces
