caption: 'Extracellular signals such as EGF, TNF, IL-1, and other growth factors (1)
  bind to their respective receptors (2), and induce phosphorylation cascades through
  signaling pathways, such as PI3K-Akt-mTOR, MAPK, and IKK (3). Upon activation of
  these intermediary kinases, IκB becomes phosphorylated and ubiquitinated (4), leading
  to degradation via the 26S proteasome (5). NF-κB subunits then translocate to the
  nucleus (6) where they regulate transcription of many genes (7) and subsequent translation
  of proteins that promote HNSCC (8). Several HNSCC chemoprevention agents are able
  to inhibit this process at a number of different steps, as depicted. Abbreviations:
  EGFR= epidermal growth factor receptor, GFRs= growth factor receptors, TNFR=tumor
  necrosis factor receptor, TLR= toll like receptor, IKK= IκB kinase, IκB= inhibitor
  of κB, PI3K= phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mTOR= mammalian target of rapamycin,
  TRAF= TNFR associated factor, GTE= green tea extract, TKI= tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
  COX= cyclooxygenase, PPARγ= peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.'
