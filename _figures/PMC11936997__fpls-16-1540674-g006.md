caption: Regulatory co-expression network analysis for flavonoid biosynthetic pathway.
  Transcription factors affecting key enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway
  were predicted using iRegNet. Arrows represent positive correlations, while T-shaped
  ends indicate negative correlations. Node colors reflect direction of regulation;
  Red for up-regulation and blue for down-regulation. Dotted lines suggest the association
  between the key enzymes and their corresponding secondary metabolites
