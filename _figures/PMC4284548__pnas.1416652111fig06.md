caption: CK1 exerts both positive and negative roles in Hh signaling by phosphorylating
  multiple targets. (A) CK1 regulates Hh signaling at multiple levels. In the absence
  of Hh, CK1 phosphorylates Ci/Gli to promote Slimb/βTRCP-mediated proteolytic processing
  that generates the repressor forms of Ci/Gli (step 1). In Hh-stimulated cells, CK1
  phosphorylates Smo to promote Ci/Gli activation (step 2) and protects the activated
  Ci/Gli from HIB/SPOP-mediated degradation (step 3). (B, Left) Under normal circumstances,
  CK1 attenuates HIB/SPOP-mediated degradation of Ci/Gli, allowing CiA/GliA to accumulate
  above certain thresholds necessary for the expression of Hh target genes. (Right)
  When CK1 activity is reduced, CiA/GliA no longer is protected, leading to accelerated
  degradation of CiA/GliA by HIB/SPOP and premature loss of Hh pathway activity. See
  text for details.
