caption: The different mechanisms exploited by different strains of ZIKV to establish
  infection and develop neuropathogenesis. The molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV
  infection and neuropathogenesis have shown to be lineage specific. (A) Apoptosis.
  Both Asian lineage strains (HAITI/1225/2014, H/PF/2013 and FSS13025) and African
  lineage strain (MR766) induce apoptosis via activation of caspase-3. However, only
  the Asian strains showed upregulation of p53 and they have shown to induce intrinsic
  cell death pathway through regulation of Bcl-2 (–). On the other hand, the apoptosis
  induced by the African strain could be via JNK pathway through activation of γH2AX
  (, , ). (B) Cell cycle arrest. Unlike other Asian lineage strains PRVABC59 and HAITI/1225/2014
  showed induction of cell cycle arrest through upregulation of p53 and p21Cip1/Waf1,
  and downregulation of cyclin B1 and cell cycle kinase CDK1 (, ). (C) Immune response.
  Zika virus infection has demonstrated to activate type II IFN, and supress type
  I and type II IFN signaling. This differential modulation of IFN signaling which
  is associated to destabilization of STAT2 has resulted in selective expression of
  ISGs and differentiated activation of immune and proinflammatory response (). Zika
  virus structural proteins (NS5, NS2A, NS2B, NS4B, NS4A and NS2B-NS3) have demonstrated
  to modulate immune response through distinct pathways (–).
