caption: 'Hypothetical model of wild and cultivated rice varieties in response to
  pathogen attack. a Defense responses of wild rice roots in response to Magnaporthe
  oryzae. In the roots of wild rice, fatty acids were degraded and served as precursors
  for diterpenoid synthesis. Fatty acids were desaturated by an ω-3 fatty acid desaturase
  to produce unsaturated fatty acids that were then used to promote linolenic acid
  synthesis. The linolenic acid subsequently promoted jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis
  which then induced systemic resistance and could promote chitinase activity. Starch
  was metabolized to produce shikimic acid for phenylpropanoid synthesis. The phenylpropanoid
  was then used to produce lignin that was subsequently infused into the cell walls
  of roots in order to increase resistance to M. oryzae. b Defense responses of cultivated
  rice roots in response to M. oryzae. In response to M. oryzae, roots of cultivated
  rice induced genes related to elongation of fatty acids. Elongated fatty acid is
  then promoted synthesis of wax and cutin which are infused into cell walls of roots
  to promote resistance to M. oryzae. Phenylpropanoid metabolism was elevated in response
  to the pathogen, and was directed to flavone synthesis rather than lignin synthesis.
