caption: 'Multiple mutations can drive cancer through at least four mechanisms. From
  left to right: 1) Multiple mutations in different proteins along the same signaling
  pathway can strengthen oncogenic signals. 2) Multiple mutations in different proteins
  in parallel pathways. 3) Multiple mutations in different proteins in complementary
  pathways. 4) Multiple mutations incis, that is, on the same protein, can also activate
  oncogenic signaling more potently than their single driver components.'
