caption: Summary of changes in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
  β-Catenin activation in the form of cytoplasmic stabilization and nuclear translocation
  occurs secondary to increased Wnt-1 or frizzled-2 proteins or mutations in β-catenin
  gene (CTNNB1). This is complemented by failure of increases in β-catenin's degradation
  complex proteins, such as axin and APC. GSK3β increase appears inadequate as reflected
  by decreased phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser45 and Thr41. The E-cadherin-β-catenin
  complex's contribution to cytoplasmic or nuclear β-catenin appears highly unlikely
  due to continued association and absent tyrosine phosphorylation. A more protective
  response of this complex to sequester some of the stabilized cytoplasmic β-catenins,
  especially in nonmetastatic tumors, could be an alternative explanation.
