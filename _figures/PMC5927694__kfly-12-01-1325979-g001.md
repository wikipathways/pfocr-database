caption: 'A conserved parallel pathway for telomere protection. The 2 branches are
  centered around 2 related proteins: the ATM and the ATR checkpoint kinases. Both
  kinases act with their interacting proteins to control telomere integrity: ATM with
  the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs (MRN) complex and ATR with ATRIP. Contrary to the pathway relationship
  for the response to DNA damage, the downstream kinases CHK1 and CHK2 are not part
  of the pathway essential for telomere protection as indicated by the strikethrough.'
