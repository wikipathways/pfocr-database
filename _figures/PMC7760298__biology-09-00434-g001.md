caption: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthesis. Arachidonic acid (AA) is a polyunsaturated
  fatty acid that constitutes the phospholipid domain of most cell membranes and is
  released from the cellular membranes by cytoplasmic phospholipases A2 (PLA2). Free
  AA can be metabolized to PGE2 through the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. In this
  pathway, the key step is the enzymatic conversion of AA to the intermediate prostaglandin
  G2 (PGG2), which is then reduced to the intermediate PGH2 by the peroxidase activity
  of COX. PGH2 is sequentially metabolized to PGE2 by specific PGE synthases (cytosolic
  PGE synthase (cPGES), microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES1), and mPGES2). PGE2 exerts
  its effects through ligation with four G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), EP1–EP4.
  Each E-type prostanoid (EP) receptor couples to distinct signaling pathways. This
