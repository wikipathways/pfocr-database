caption: MTHFR, a critical branch point of one-carbon metabolism. A, one-carbon metabolism
  encompasses the folate cycle, methionine cycle, and transsulfuration pathway. The
  folate cycle plays a crucial role in nucleotide biosynthesis (purines and thymidine)
  and redox balance (by utilization and production of NADPH at various steps). Folate
  metabolism is linked to the methionine cycle via 5-CH3THF, a folate intermediate
  synthesized by the activity of the MTHFR enzyme. MS remethylates homocysteine to
  methionine by expending 5-CH3THF, which enters the methionine cycle. The methionine
  cycle, in addition to providing methionine for protein translation, is the major
  source of SAM, the cellular methylation currency. SAM also yields polyamines via
  the methionine salvage pathway or enters the transsulfuration pathway via hydrolysis
  of SAH to homocysteine. The transsulfuration pathway synthesizes GSH via a series
  of steps. GSH is the major anti-oxidant moiety in the cell. SHMT, serine hydroxyl
  methyltransferase; TYMS, thymidine synthase; GART, glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase;
  AICART, aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. B, schematic
  representation of eukaryotic MTHFR. Shown is the domain organization of the yeast
  MTHFR, Met13p, with ∼300-amino acid-long catalytic domain at the N terminus and
  an equally large regulatory domain at the C terminus.
