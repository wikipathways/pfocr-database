caption: Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog signaling pathways regulate normal and stem cell
  fate. (a) Notch signaling pathway. Upon binding of Notch ligands (Jag / Delta) to
  the Notch receptor, the cleaved intracellular domain (NICD) translocates to the
  nucleus where it binds with co-activators to induce transcription of its target
  genes. Notch 1 and 3 show higher expression in luminal committed progenitors, whereas
  Notch4 is expressed in bipotent MaSCs, and significantly downregulated upon luminal
  and myoepithelial cell differentiation. (b) Wnt signaling pathway. Canonical Wnt
  signaling occurs through the stabilization and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin.
  One of the 19 secreted Wnt ligands binds to the frizzled receptor and the LRP co-receptor.
  This activation recruits the Axin degradation complex to the LRP receptor and away
  from β-catenin, preventing its degradation. β-catenin is then free to translocate
  to the nucleus and associate with the transcription factors LCF / LEF and co-activators
  (e.g., CBP) to initiate transcription of target genes, which are essential for normal
  mammary gland development and stem cell renewal. (c) Hedgehog signaling. Hedgehog
  is a secreted ligand that binds to its receptor, Patched (Ptch). When Ptch is activated
  by Hh binding, its inhibition of the Smoothened (Smo) receptor is relieved, which
  allows the Smo receptor to localize to the primary cilium. Smo is then able to inhibit
  the phosphorylation and cleavage of Gli (by GSK3, CK1α, and PKA), which prevents
  the formation of repressive Gli (GliR) and instead promotes the formation of activated
  Gli (GliA). GliA then translocates into the nucleus and initiates transcription
  of target genes, which play a role in stem cell regulation
