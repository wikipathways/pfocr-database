caption: Portions of the pathway utilized in β-branching are highlighted with color
  in this depiction of the bryostatin biosynthetic pathway. BryC, BryX and BryD are
  not shown []. Though the complete structure of the PKC modulator, bryostatin 1 is
  shown here, the full suite of bryostatin molecules contains acyl chain variability
  at both C7 and C20. ACP, acyl carrier protein; AT, acyltransferase; DH, dehydratase;
  FkbH, homolog to FkbH []; HMGS, HMG-CoA synthase homolog; KR, ketoreductase; KS,
  ketosynthase; KSDC, decarboxylative ketosynthase; MT, methyltransferase; Unk, domain
  with unknown function. Refer to  for more information.
