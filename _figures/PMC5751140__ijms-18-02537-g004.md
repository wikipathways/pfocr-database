caption: Interactions between WNT/β-catenin pathway and aerobic glycolysis. WNT ligands
  bind both Frizzled and LRP 5/6 receptors to initiate LRP phosphorylation of the
  AXIN/APC/GSK-3β complex. β-catenin phosphorylation is inhibited and this prevents
  its degradation in the proteasome. β-catenin accumulates into the cytosol and then
  translocates to the nucleus to bind TCF-LEF co transcription factors. WNT-response
  gene transcription is stimulated (PDK, c-Myc, cyclin D, MCT-1). MCT-1 promotes the
  release of lactate out of the cell. WNT/β-catenin pathway activates tyrosine kinase
  receptors (TKRs). Activation of PI3K/Akt increases glucose metabolism. Akt-transformed
  cells induce HIF-1α stabilization, which largely diminishes the glucose entry into
  the TCA cycle. Stimulate HIF-1α activity increases expression of glycolytic enzymes
  (GLUT, HK, PKM2, LDH-A). Elevated aerobic glycolysis is observed with increased
  production of lactate and decreased mitochondrial respiration. HIF-1α induced PDK
  phosphorylates PDH, which results in cytosolic pyruvate being shunted into lactate
  through induction of LDH-A. PDK inhibits the PDH complex into mitochondria. Thus,
  pyruvate cannot be fully converted into acetyl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle. c-Myc
  and cyclin D also activate LDH-A which converts cytosolic pyruvate into lactate.
  Activated PKM2 translocates to the nucleus through Pin1, then binds β-catenin and
  induces c-Myc expression. This activates GLUT, PKM2 and LDH-A in a positive feedback.

  description: Interactions between WNT/β-catenin pathway and aerobic glycolysis.
    WNT ligands bind both Frizzled and LRP 5/6 receptors to initiate LRP phosphorylation
    of the AXIN/APC/GSK-3β complex. β-catenin phosphorylation is inhibited and this
    prevents its degradation in the proteasome. β-catenin accumulates into the cytosol
    and then translocates to the nucleus to bind TCF-LEF co transcription factors.
    WNT-response gene transcription is stimulated (PDK, c-Myc, cyclin D, MCT-1). MCT-1
    promotes the release of lactate out of the cell. WNT/β-catenin pathway activates
    tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs). Activation of PI3K/Akt increases glucose metabolism.
    Akt-transformed cells induce HIF-1α stabilization, which largely diminishes the
    glucose entry into the TCA cycle. Stimulate HIF-1α activity increases expression
    of glycolytic enzymes (GLUT, HK, PKM2, LDH-A). Elevated aerobic glycolysis is
    observed with increased production of lactate and decreased mitochondrial respiration.
    HIF-1α induced PDK phosphorylates PDH, which results in cytosolic pyruvate being
    shunted into lactate through induction of LDH-A. PDK inhibits the PDH complex
    into mitochondria. Thus, pyruvate cannot be fully converted into acetyl-CoA and
