caption: (a) Effect of ECT on MAPK, AhR, and NF-κB signaling pathways in CS-induced
  lung injury in mice. CS upregulates the expression of MAPK and NF-κB proteins but
  inhibits expression of AhR protein in the lung. It also induces secretion of proinflammatory
  cytokines. CS also induces oxidative stress and inflammation, causing lung injury.
  However, ECT ameliorated the lung injury. (b) Effect of ECT on MAPK, PXR, AhR, and
  NF-κB signaling pathways in CS-induced liver injury in mice. CS activated the MAPK
  and NF-κB signaling pathways, inhibited the expression of PXR and AhR proteins and
  the expression of CYP450-related genes, released proinflammatory cytokines, and
  disrupted metabolic detoxification processes in the liver. However, ECT may enhance
  the hepatic metabolic detoxification.
