caption: Seasonal Timing of Flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana.(A) A winter annual
  Arabidopsis line without prolonged cold exposure. FRIGIDA activates the expression
  of the floral repressor FLC (for FLOWERING LOCUS C), which directly represses the
  expression of the florigenic FT (for FLOWERING LOCUS T) gene to inhibit flowering.(B)
  After experiencing winter cold, Arabidopsis winter annuals in temperate regions
  flower in late spring in response to increasing day length. Winter cold, through
  the vernalization pathway, represses FLC expression and thus relieves FT repression.
  This enables long-day induction of FT expression by the photoperiod pathway to promote
  flowering. FT feedback represses FLC expression.
