caption: 'IFNG-induced autophagy is regulated by HMOX1. IFNG can induce autophagy
  through multiple pathways namely: IRGM/LRG-47, MAPK14, JAK1/2, EIF2AK4, IRF1 (interferon
  regulatory factor 1) or CEBPB. The model depicts the autophagic induction by IFNG
  through above-mentioned pathways and highlights the new signaling axis identified
  in the current study (Pathway depicted with red arrows). IFNG leads to the induction
  of HMOX1 and hence its product CO. The HMOX1-generated CO leads to the increase
  in cytoplasmic calcium levels that activates PPP3. This phosphatase dephosphorylates
  TFEB which leads to the transport of TFEB into the nucleus and hence the increase
  in autophagic flux and lysosomal biogenesis.'
papertitle: Antimycobacterial effect of IFNG (interferon gamma)-induced autophagy
  depends on HMOX1 (heme oxygenase 1)-mediated increase in intracellular calcium levels
  and modulation of PPP3/calcineurin-TFEB (transcription factor EB) axis.
