caption: A model for the regulation of ACS7 protein stability. The stability of ACS7
  is regulated by a complex network of reversible phosphorylation events and proteasomal
  degradation. Phosphorylation of ACS7 by kinases (CDPK16 and 14–3‐3 protein) leads
  to activation of ACS7 and an increase in ethylene biosynthesis. Protein phosphatases
  2C, ABI1, ABI2 and HAB1, which are important components of the abscisic acid signalling
  pathway, interact with ACS7. Dephosphorylation of ACS7 reduces its stability. UPL1,
  UPL2 and XBAT32 act as E3 ligases that recognise ACS7 and add ubiquitin, targeting
  the protein for proteasomal degradation. Lysine residues critical for ubiquitination
  are located at positions 238 and 384 in the amino acid sequence of ACS7
