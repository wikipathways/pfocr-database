caption: Overview of the Mechanism of Mutant-Selective AKT1 Targeting Therapy and
  the Therapeutic Effects of Synthetic Compounds on Cancer. a Cellular functions of
  the downstream AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. The AKT-mTOR pathway regulates several
  key cellular processes, including tumor growth, cell cycle progression, energy metabolism,
  and translation control. b Chemical structures of Compounds 1–3 and their mechanism
  of action against AKT1(E17K). Compounds 1–3 are based on the imidazopyridine core
  of ARQ092 and feature different linker structures. These compounds demonstrate enhanced
  targeting of the AKT1(E17K) mutant. The unique AKT1(E17K)-salicylaldehyde-Zn2+ complex
  (the ASZ complex in the article) stabilizes the binding affinity between the compounds
  and the mutant AKT1. c In vivo evaluation of mutant-selective compounds. Compound
  4 effectively inhibits the growth of AKT1(E17K)-mutant tumors in vivo, with minimal
  side effects on blood glucose and body weight
