caption: The first and common step in all mechanisms is the 5′ to 3′ degradation of
  the DSB ends, to generate to invasive 3′ ssDNA tails (arrowhead). In the DSBR pathway,
  after priming DNA synthesis (dashed lines), second end capture allows formation
  of a double Holliday junction, whose resolution can lead to either crossover or
  non-crossover products. In the SDSA pathway, the 3′ end is displaced, it pairs with
  the other 3′ single stranded tail and DNA synthesis completes repair. The SSA pathway
  is restricted to DSBs that occur between direct repeats. Extensive resection of
  the ends reveals the complementary sequences, which can then anneal resulting in
  the deletion of one of the repeats and the intervening sequences.
