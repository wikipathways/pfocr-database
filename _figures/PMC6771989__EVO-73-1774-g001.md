caption: Clinal candidates in the insulin/TOR signaling pathway. Overview of the insulin/insulin‐like
  growth factor signaling (IIS)/target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway in Drosophila melanogaster
  (Oldham and Hafen ; Giannakou and Partridge ; Teleman ). Genes that harbor strongly
  clinally varying SNPs across latitude, identified by Fabian et al. (), are highlighted
  in red; arrows indicate activation and bar‐ended lines represent inhibitory effects.
  In response to nutrients, IIS is activated by binding of ligands, called Drosophila
  insulin‐like peptides (dilps 1–8), to the insulin‐like receptor (InR) at the cell
  membrane. Inside the cell, signaling is transduced by an insulin receptor substrate
  (IRS) protein called chico. This activates phosphoinositide‐3‐kinase (PI3K) that
  converts phosphatidylinositol (3,4)‐bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5)‐trisphosphate (PIP3). In turn, PIP3 stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
  (PDK) and activates protein kinase B (AKT/PKB). The action of PI3K is antagonized
  by phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) that converts PIP3 back to PIP2. AKT/PKB
  suppresses the forkhead (FKH) box O transcription factor FOXO by phosphorylating
  it; upon reduced IIS, FOXO becomes dephosphorylated and moves into the nucleus where
  it regulates the expression of hundreds of target genes. Target genes of FOXO include
  InR, controlled via a transcriptional feedback loop, and initiation factor 4E‐binding
  protein (4E‐BP); another target gene of IIS is target of brain insulin (Tobi), which
  encodes a glucosidase, but the details of its regulation remain poorly understood.
  FOXO is antagonized by 14‐3‐3ε AKT/PKB antagonizes the activity of the tuberous
  sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/TSC2); TSC1/2 in turn inactivates RAS homologue enriched
  in brain (RHEB). The inactivation of RHEB disinhibits, that is, activates, target
  of rapamycin (TOR). TOR then activates the effector gene S6 kinase (S6K) and inhibits
  the negative regulator 4E‐BP. The phenotypic effects of naturally occurring alleles
  of the genes in the IIS/TOR pathway remain poorly understood, but clinal polymorphisms
  in InR (Paaby et al. ; Paaby et al. ) and foxo (this study) have pleiotropic effects
  on life history in Drosophila.
