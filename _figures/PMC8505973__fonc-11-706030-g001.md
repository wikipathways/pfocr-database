caption: The influence of HMAs on bone marrow cells. (A) 5-AZA and 5-AZA-dC are transported
  into blast cells or immune cells (T cells, NK cells and DCs) by hENT1, hENT2, and
  hENT1-2, hCNT1 and hCNT3, respectively, part of which are catalyzed by CDA and result
  in degradation. The remaining AZA and 5-AZA-dC are catalyzed into 5-AZA-CMP and
  5-AZA-dCMP by UCK and DCK, separately. In the following process, NMPK and NDPK play
  a role in the formation of 5-AZA-CTP and 5-AZA-dCTP. 5-AZA-CTP is mainly incorporated
  into RNA and possibly promotes the formation of 5-AZA sensitive chromatin structure,
  which consists of hnRNPK, DNMT2, NSUN3, CDK9/p-TEF-b and TF. 5-AZA-dCTP depletes
  DNMTs and increases gene expression, degradation of DNMTs is processed by proteosome
  pathway or by upregulating TRAF6 that leads to DNMTs ubiquitination, 5-AZA-dCTP
  is also activated and becomes hydrolyzed by SAMHD1 in leukemia. Simultaneously,
  5-AZA-dCTP activates the transcription of ERV, induces dsRNA formation and facilitates
  type III interferon response. (B) 5-AZA-dC and 5-AZA inhibit NK cells by upregulating
  the inhibitory receptor KIR, or activate the antitumor activities by secreting some
  cytokines (IFN-Gamma or TNF-Alpha). HMAs induce the expression of CD40 and CD86
  on DCs, which interact with CD8+ T cells by CD80/86-CD28 and TCR-MHC I CD8+ T cells
  communicate with blast cells by TCR-MHC I, PD-1-PDL1, and CTLA-4-CD80. HMAs increase
  the secretion of IFN-Gamma and antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells, and the expression
  of PD-1 and CTLA4 is upregulated as well, which participate in immune suppression.
  HMAs decrease the percentage of MDSCs in the bone marrow, which may promote the
  function of HMA. MSCs secrete IL-6, IL-10, IDO-1, etc., to inhibit CD8 T cells or
  directly interact with blast cells by VCAM1-VLA4. Leukemia cells express high level
  of CXCL4 and CXCL7 to promote the survival of leukemia cells under the treatment
  of HMAs. MSC can also secret CXCL7. These interactions and secretion of chemokines
  or cytokines in the bone marrow, which potentially mediate the resistance to HMAs,
  are still not completely understood.
