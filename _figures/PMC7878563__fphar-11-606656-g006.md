caption: Signaling pathways coupled to the M4 mAChR. Upon activation, the M4 mAChR
  is principally coupled to Gαi/o proteins that inhibit adenylate cyclase (AC) to
  decrease cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. The M4 mAChR also
  couples to Gαs proteins, when activated by high (100 μM) concentrations of agonists.
  Gαs directly activates adenylate cyclase to convert cytosolic adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) to cAMP, a second messenger that can activate protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange
  protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC). PKA phosphorylates and activates cAMP
  response element binding protein (CREB), which increases gene transcription from
  cAMP response elements (CRE). Phospholipase A (PLA)2 is activated by the M4 mAChR
  via a mechanism involving Gαi/o and protein kinase C (PKC). PLA2 increases intracellular
  arachidonic acid (AA) levels, which promotes amyloid precursor protein (APP) release,
  amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque formation and Tau protein hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer's
  disease. Phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated by Gβγ-subunits, and PI3K
  activates protein kinase B (Akt), which in turn inhibits glycogen synthase kinase
  (GSK) 3β affecting the production of toxic Aβ plaques and Tau hyperphosphorylation.
  Receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK) one is recruited to the M4 mAChR and scaffolds
  PKC, which may be involved in Aβ plaque formation and Tau hyperphosphorylation.
  Gα15 coupling links M4 mAChR activation with increases in intracellular IP3 levels
  and related signaling responses. The M4 mAChR is phosphorylated by GRK2 and recruits
  β-arrestin to terminate G protein-mediated signaling events. M4 mAChR cell surface
  expression levels are regulated by internalization, either by recruitment of β-arrestins
  and internalization via clathrin-coated pits or by caveolin-dependent mechanisms.
  Dashed arrows indicate pathways requiring further work to characterise the signaling
  proteins involved in the pathway. Solid arrows represent experimentally determined
  interactions. Proteins that are disrupted in Alzheimer's disease are colored in
  purple, those disrupted in schizophrenia are colored in blue and those disrupted
  in both diseases are colored in green.
