caption: Overview of cannabinoids' pharmacology. (A) Synthesis of endocannabinoids
  from membrane lipids. (B) TRPM8 and TRPV1, ionotropic receptors of cannabinoids.
  (C) Cannabinoid (CB) receptors 1 and 2 coupled to g protein and adenylyl cyclase,
  cannabinoids; their respective ligands are shown in the image. (D) GPR55 receptor
  coupled to g protein, Rho GTPase, and MAPK pathway; its respective ligands are shown
  in the image. (E) Ceramide synthesis de novo induced by endocannabinoids. (F) Reuptake
  of endocannabinoids and subsequent metabolism. (G) Apoptosome assembly during the
  mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Executioner caspase is cleaved, and the cell
  undergoes apoptosis. (H) Rimonabant increases β-catenin breakdown and decreases
  the activity of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF). Other
  studied effects of cannabinoids not included in the figure are cytotoxic effects
  (antiproliferative effects), upregulation of estrogen receptors, reduction of proinflammatory
  markers, antiangiogenic effects (inhibition of proangiogenic factors), induction
  of chromosomal abnormalities, and mitotic catastrophe.
