caption: 'Regulation of eIF4F complex formation by PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK/MNK, and AMPK
  pathways and drugs targeting these pathways. mTOR, a downstream effector of PI3K/Akt
  pathway, is a serine/threonine kinase which is the core of two protein complexes:
  mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 phosphorylates 4E-BP and the S6K1 kinase. 4E-BP phosphorylation
  leads to 4E-BP1/eIF4E dissociation and consequently formation of the eIF4F complex.
  S6K1 phosphorylation leads to its activation which in turn phosphorylates eIF4G,
  eIF4B, and PDCD4. Once phosphorylated, PDCD4 is degraded thus freeingeIF4A which
  can then join the eIF4F complex. Phosphorylated eIF4B stabilizes unwounded mRNA
  and stimulates eIF4A RNase and helicase activities. Phosphorylated S6K1 also inhibits
  the PI3K/Akt pathway by a feedback loop (dotted red line). mTORC2 can phosphorylate
  and activate Akt which inhibits IRES-dependent translation. MNKs are downstream
  effectors of the MAPK/MNK pathway able to phosphorylate eIF4E which then promotes
  mRNA translation initiation. Finally, the AMPK pathway modulates protein synthesis
  by inhibiting mTORC1 and consequently blocking 4E-BP/eIF4E dissociation and eIF4F
  complex formation. Drugs acting as activators or inhibitors of these different pathways
  are represented in green or in red, respectively. mTOR—mechanistic target of rapamycin;
  PI3K—phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt—protein kinase B; mTORC—mechanistic target of
  rapamycin complex; 4E-BP—eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein;
  S6K1—S6 kinase 1; eIF—eukaryotic initiation factor; PDCD4—programmed cell death
  4; IRES—internal ribosome entry site; MAPK—Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK);
  MNK—MAPK interacting protein kinases; AMPK—AMP-activated protein kinase. Phosphorylation
