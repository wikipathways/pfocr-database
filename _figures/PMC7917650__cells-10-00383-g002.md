caption: '(A) Balanced agonism. Binding of IGF-I to the IGF-IR induces stimulates
  both the β-arrestin-1 pathway that leads to MAPK activation and proteasome degradation
  of the IGF-IR through an ubiquitin-mediated mechanism resulting in a loss of the
  number of IGF-IRs at cellular membrane. IGF-I binding to the IGF-IR also induces
  phosphorylation of tyrosine residues and this stimulates the kinase pathway which
  finally activates AKT. (B) β-arrestin-1-biased agonism. Binding of a biased agonist
  preferentially increases β-arrestin-1 signaling and this simultaneously inhibits
  the IGF-IR kinase pathway. Thus, β-arrestin-1-biased agonism results in down-regulation
  of the IGF-IR and inhibition of AKT signaling, but increases MAPK-mediated cell
  proliferation and growth (Modified from Salisbury & Tomblin. Insulin/Insulin-like
  growth factors in cancer: new roles for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, tumor resistance
  mechanisms, and new blocking strategies [].'
