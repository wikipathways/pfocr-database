caption: Comparison of cellular sulfur trafficking related to thiouridine formation
  of tRNA anticodon in S. cerevisiae and E. coli. (A) Proposed sulfur flow system
  for 2-thiouridine formation of mcm5s2U. Nfs1p accepts sulfur from Cys to form a
  persulfide using PLP as a cofactor. The persulfide sulfur is mainly transferred
  to the RLD2 (Cys259) of Tum1p, and partially to the RLD (Cys397) of Uba4p. Uba4p,
  as an E1-like enzyme in the ubiquitin-related pathway, activates the C-terminus
  of Urm1p to form the acyl-adenylated intermediate, then transfers the persulfide
  sulfur from the RLD to form thiocarboxylated Urm1p (Urm1p-COSH) by releasing AMP.
  Urm1p-COSH is a substrate of 2-thiouridine formation catalyzed by Ncs2p and Ncs6p.
  For protein urmylation, Urm1p-COSH is conjugated with Uba4p, then the putative E3
  enzyme transfers Urm1p to target proteins such as Ahp1p. (B) Sulfur-relay system
  by Tus-proteins in E. coli. IscS accepts sulfur from Cys to form a persulfide using
  PLP as a cofactor. TusA interacts with IscS to stimulate its desulfurase activity,
  and accepts the persulfide sulfur. The sulfur is transferred to TusD in the TusBCD
  complex. It is then transferred to TusE. TusE interacts with MnmA to transfer the
  sulfur. MnmA recognizes the tRNA and activates the wobble uridine by forming an
  adenylated intermediate, then the persulfide sulfur attacks this position to release
  the AMP resulting in the synthesis of the 2-thiouridine of mnm5s2U.
