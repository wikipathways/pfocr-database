caption: Schematic representation of the adverse effect of BPA during porcine early
  embryonic development. BPA exposure causes the generation of oxidative stress, which
  results in DNA and mitochondrial damage. Apoptosis was induced by the release of
  cytochrome c from the mitochondria because of mitochondrial damage. The DNA damage
  led to the activation of the p53-p21 pathway. In addition, the oxidative stress
  induced the adaptive response, autophagy.
