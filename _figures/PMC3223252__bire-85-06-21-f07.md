caption: A refined model shows MEHP-decreased TIMP2 expression in Sertoli cells is
  mediated by the inactivation of CEBPA and the activation of MYC and is dependent
  upon the FSH-stimulated cAMP signaling pathway. MEHP exposure causes a decrease
  in Sertoli cell TIMP2 expression in the seminiferous tubules through transcriptional
  gene regulation. First, MEHP exposure disturbs cAMP-dependent FSH signaling, leading
  to the decreased CEBPA observed in the nucleus. Inactivation of CEBPA suppresses
  TIMP2 levels in Sertoli cells. Second, MEHP exposure activates MYC and contributes
  to the decrease in TIMP2 expression. MEHP-suppressed TIMP2 allows for activation
  of MMP2, change in the TIMP2:MMP2 ratio results in stimulating germ cell apoptosis
  and germ cell detachment.
