caption: Model of CC-122 costimulation of T cells and tumoricidal activity through
  degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros. Binding of CC-122 to CRBN promotes the interaction
  with Aiolos and Ikaros to CRL4CRBN leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent
  proteasomal destruction. Degradation of Aiolos and Ikaros results in costimulation
  of T cells and anti-DLBCL activity. Ai, Aiolos; Cul4, cullin 4; DDB1, DNA damage
  binding protein-1; Roc1, regulator of cullins 1; Ub, ubiquitin.
papertitle: CC-122, a pleiotropic pathway modifier, mimics an interferon response
  and has antitumor activity in DLBCL.
