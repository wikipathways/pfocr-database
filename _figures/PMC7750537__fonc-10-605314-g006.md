caption: Crosstalk between the coagulation cascade and autophagy on tumor-associated
  endothelial cells. Thrombin-induced endothelial hyperpermeability and endothelial
  secretion of thrombosis-promoting factors are dependent on autophagy. Activation
  of the coagulation cascade and PAR1 induces an increase in intracellular Ca+2, which
  allows activation of AMPK by CaMKKB. Thus, the activation of AMPK induced by PARs
  could induce autophagy. Disassembly and degradation of VE-cadherin and the formation
  of actin stress fibers promoted by thrombin through autophagy could allow endothelial
  hyperpermeability. The secretion of vWF and P-selectin is mediated by the secretory
  pathway autophagy. Autophagosomes contain vWF and allow its release from endothelial
  cells. The secretion of vWF and P-selectin stimulated by ox-LDL is mediated by the
  inhibition of Sirt1/FoxO1 signaling by preventing fusion of autophagosome with lysosome.
  These factors allow adhesion of cancer cells and platelets to the endothelium, thus
  promoting cancer-related thrombosis and metastasis. FVII, factor VII; FX, factor
