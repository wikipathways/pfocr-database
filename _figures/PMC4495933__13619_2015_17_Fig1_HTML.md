caption: The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In the Wnt-off state, defined by the
  absence of an active Wnt ligand, β-catenin is phosphorylated by the destruction
  complex (formed from the two kinases Gsk3 and Ck1, the scaffolding protein Axin,
  and the tumor suppressor Apc) and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
  In the Wnt-on state, active Wnt ligands interact with the Fz receptors and the Lrp5/6
  coreceptor. Phosphorylation of Lrp5/6 by Gsk3 and Ck1 recruits Dvl and Axin to the
  receptor complex and hence inhibits the destruction complex. This, in turn, inhibits
  β-catenin phosphorylation and stabilizes β-catenin in the cytoplasm. β-catenin is
  then translocated into the nucleus, by a complex including Fam53b/Smp, and regulates
  target gene expression with the Tcf/Lef transcription factors. Many modulators including
  the inhibitors sFrps and Wif are known to tightly regulate the signaling cascade
