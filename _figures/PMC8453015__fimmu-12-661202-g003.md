caption: Palmitoylation in the cGAS-STING pathway. Cytoplasmic DNA recognized by cyclic
  GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) triggers the production of the second messenger cyclic GMP–AMP
  (cGAMP), which binds and activates the cyclic-dinucleotide sensor, stimulator of
  interferon genes (STING). cGAMP promotes the translocation of STING from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) to the Golgi where palmitoylation of the STING cytoplasmic proximal
  cysteine residues occurs. This facilitates the recruitment of TANK-binding kinase
  1 (TBK1) and transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), triggers
  IRF3 nuclear entry and induces type I interferon (IFN) transcription. The non-specific
  Zinc finger aspartic acid-histidine-histidine-cysteine domain-containing protein
  (zDHHC)- palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) covalent inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP)
  and the STING-selective palmitoylation inhibitors (nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs),
  nitrofurans) all block STING palmitoylation and inhibit production of type I IFN.
  D-ceramide-C6, which disrupts lipid rafts, inhibits the activation of TBK1 and IRF3
  also.
