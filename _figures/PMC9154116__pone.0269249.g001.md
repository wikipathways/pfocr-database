caption: Two types of samples (Lung epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial
  cells) were collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells and both are
  included in the GSE147507 dataset. GSE147507 dataset contains a sample of SARS-CoV-2
  infected lung epithelial cells and the TCGA-LIHC dataset contains hepatocellular
  carcinoma samples. R programming language was used to identify the Common DEGs from
  both datasets. From the common DEGs, GO identification, KEGG pathway, PPIs network,
  TF and miRNA analysis, hub gene identification and module analysis were designed
  and based on those analysis drug molecule identification was performed.
