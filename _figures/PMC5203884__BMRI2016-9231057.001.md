caption: p53 suppresses the cell proliferation mediated by the Rb-E2F pathway. Phosphorylation
  of Rb by CDK4/6-cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E causes the dissociation of Rb from E2F
  to promote cell cycle progression. In response to DNA damage, ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM) or ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) are activated
  and phosphorylate p53 either directly or through Chk1/2. Phosphorylated p53 dissociates
  from Mdm2 and is thereby stabilized. Active p53 then induces the transcription of
  its target genes involving p21 WAF1, resulting in the inhibition of CDK2-cyclin
  E activity.
