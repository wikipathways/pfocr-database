caption: Peripheral blood monocytes (Mo) were cultured with control medium or with
  conditioned medium from HCT116 or Hke-3 colon cells for 48 hours. As shown here,
  soluble factor(s) from HCT116 and Hke-3 cells induced maturation of normal peripheral
  blood monocytes (Mo), demonstrated by phalloidin/DAPI staining, coupled to the release
  of IL-1β. IL-1β, through activation of NF-κB, induced phosphorylation of PDK1 and
  AKT, which inactivates GSK3β, leading to enhanced β–catenin/TCF4 transcriptional
  activity, and increased expression of Wnt target genes in tumor cells, including
  c-myc and c-jun (adapted from []).
