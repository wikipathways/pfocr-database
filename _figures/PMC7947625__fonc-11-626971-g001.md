caption: The mevalonate (MVA) pathway and its connection with the intracellular energy
  metabolism signaling. Diagram of the different steps of the intracellular MVA anabolic
  pathway, from the entry of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to the production of isoprenoid
  metabolites. Acetyl-CoA is transformed into hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA)
  which is used by the enzyme hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) to synthesize
  MVA. MVA is further metabolized to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), a precursor of
  cholesterol and sterols. FPP is also converted to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP),
  and these lipids are used for post-translational modification of proteins, including
  N-glycosylation and protein prenylation.
