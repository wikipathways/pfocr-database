caption: A, one of the major networks identified by unsupervised analysis of genes
  differentially expressed in post-MI vs. sham myocardium. Genes in red and green
  are up- and downregulated after MI, respectively. Genes in white, such as calcineurin,
  are not changed in expression but represent hubs between a large number of differentially
  expressed genes. The data show that a number of genes of the β-adrenergic pathway
  are changed in expression. B, simplified β-adrenergic signalling pathway identified
  by supervised data analysis, with upregulated genes in red and downregulated genes
  in green. Colour intensities correspond to the degree of change, with a deeper colour
  indicating a greater change. PP1 has been depicted with a red outline to indicate
  that we previously found an increase in PP1 protein level. Data are from Kuster
  et al. (unpublished).
