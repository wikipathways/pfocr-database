caption: Impaired efferocytosis in aging. Senescent cells have increased expression
  of CD47 and CD24, which bind to SIRPα and Siglec‐10 on the macrophage surface, respectively.
  This leads to phosphorylation of ITIM structural domain proteins in macrophages,
  which results in recruitment and activation of SHP‐1. Activated SHP‐1 inhibits cytoskeletal
  rearrangements through downstream signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting efferocytosis.
  Furthermore, senescent cells secrete SASP to cleave MerTK on the macrophage surface,
  shedding its extracellular portion and thus preventing it from performing its normal
  function. In aging, macrophages have decreased expression of TAM receptors (including
  MerTK, Axl, and Tyro3) and Gas6, which impairs macrophage binding to dying cells.
  In addition, mitochondrial fission promotes Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum,
  driving phagosome–lysosome fusion and vesicular transport. However, Drp1 protein,
  a key protein involved in mitochondrial fission, has decreased activity in aging,
  leading to dysregulation of mitochondrial fission. The resultant combination of
  the above events leads to impaired efferocytosis in aging, resulting in tissue inflammation
  that promotes further aging
