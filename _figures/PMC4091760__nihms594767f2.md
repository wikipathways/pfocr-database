caption: 'In its quiescent state, the AhR is bound to various repressive factors in
  the cytoplasm. Ligand (L) binding to the AhR activates the AhR and induces a conformational
  change which exposes a nuclear localization signal. After nuclear translocation,
  the AhR dimerizes with ARNT. The AhR: ARNT transcription factor complex binds to
  XRE sequences in target gene promoters. Interaction with multiple transcriptional
  coactivators is necessary to induce transcription. GTF: general transcription factors;
  hsp90: heat shock protein 90; PolII: RNA polymerase II; p23: prostaglandin E synthase
  3/ hsp90 co-chaperone; TBP: TATA-box-binding protein; XAP2: AH receptor-interacting
  protein/ hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2; XRE: xenobiotic response element.'
