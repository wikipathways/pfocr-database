caption: Interaction between tumor necrosis factor and tumor necrosis factor receptor
  2 signaling. Up-regulated genes were extracted from the intersection of severe acute
  respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)- and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. These
  genes were examined by an Ingenuity pathway analysis for interacting networks. Downstream
  molecules are shown on the right side. Up-regulated genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected
  cells are marked with a red star, including multiple cytokines and intracellular
  proteins. CCL = C-C chemokine ligands, CSF = colony-stimulating factor, CXCL = C-X-C
  motif chemokine ligand, IκB = inhibitor of κB, IL = interleukin, NF-κB = nuclear
  factor-κB, PTGS2 = prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, TNFR1 = tumor necrosis
  factor receptor 1, TNFR2 = tumor necrosis factor receptor, TRAF1 = tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated factor 1.
