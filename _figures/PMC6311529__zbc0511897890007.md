caption: Proposed model of LUBAC-mediated ubiquitination on cFLIP in the TNFα receptor
  signaling pathway. In normal conditions, linear ubiquitination of cFLIP induced
  by LUBAC inhibits Lys-48–linked ubiquitination of cFLIP, thereby suppressing caspase
  8 activity and apoptosis process. When LUBAC is deficient, cFLIP cannot be ubiquitinated
  by LUBAC. Instead, cFLIP degrades through Lys-48–linked ubiquitination in a dependent
  manner, thereby promoting apoptosis process.
