caption: 'The canonical and non-canonical pro-fibrotic pathways of transforming growth
  factor β (TGFβ) and Wnt and the pro-fibrotic interleukin 11 (IL-11) pathway. (A)
  Canonical TGFβ pathway: TGFβ binds to the type I/II TGFβ receptor. The Smad2/3 complex
  is then phosphorylated, at this point the pathway can be inhibited by Smad6/7. In
  the cytoplasm Smad2/3 binds Smad4 and the whole complex transfers to the nucleus,
  where it binds to GAGAC motifs, promoting gene expression. (B) Non-canonical TGFβ
  pathway: TGFβ binds the TGFβ receptor type I/II, resulting in tyrosine residues
  and Shc (Src homology 2 domain containing) transforming protein phosphorylation.
  This promotes the binding of Grb2 (Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) and Sos
  (son of sevenless). This complex can activate Ras, launching the MAPK cascade and
  further gene regulation. (C) Wnt canonical pathway: Wnt (wingless-related integration
  site) binds transmembrane protein frizzled (Fz). Fz bound WNT can then bind LPR5/6
  protein (low-density-lipoprotein-related protein) which undergoes phosphorylation
  of its tail by GSK3 and CK1 proteins. Following this, low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein (LRP) interacts with Disheveld (DVL), Axin, and GSK3 via Pro-Pro-Pro-(Ser/Tyr)-Pro
  repeats. This complex is responsible for β-catenin attenuation. (D) Wnt non-canonical
  pathway: Wnt binds transmembrane protein Fz at the site of a membrane invagination.
  The complex then becomes part of the membrane of an early endosome. LPR5/6 is phosphorylated
  at its tail by GSK3 and CK1 proteins. Following this, LRP interacts with DVL, Axin,
  and GSK3 via Pro-Pro-Pro-(Ser/Tyr)-Pro repeats. The membrane of the early endosome
  can form a second invagination, eventually leading to the whole complex being locked
  down inside a multivesicular body. (E) The IL-11 signaling pathway activates the
  MAPK cascade, promoting gene regulation [,,].'
