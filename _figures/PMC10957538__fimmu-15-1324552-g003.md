caption: Impact of particulate matter (PM) on airway remodelling. Exposure to PM leads
  to airspace enlargement and thickening of the airway walls via upregulation of matrix
  metalloproteinase (MMP) 9,12 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 followed by
  elastin dysfunction, and activation of the Wnt5a/β-catenin pathway, respectively.
  On the other hand, the increase and recruitment of immune cells like neutrophils
  and eosinophils through activation of CCL5, CXCL1, and CXCL6 can occur in the presence
  of air pollutants, followed by the expression of neutrophil elastase and various
  MMPs (2, 8, 9 and 12), and inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-6,
  IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and TGF-β1. PM exposure also triggers extracellular
  matrix (ECM) components deposition (collagen I, III and fibronectin) and fibrosis
  by activation of the TGF-β signalling pathway, and the impairment of oxidant/antioxidant
  balance
