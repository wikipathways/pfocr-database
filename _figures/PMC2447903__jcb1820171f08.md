caption: Model for TWEAK killing. TWEAK binding to FN14 induces the recruitment of
  a cIAP1–TRAF2 complex. This complex is then targeted for lysosomal degradation by
  the MVB pathway. The loss of cIAP1 or TRAF2 induces the stabilization of NIK and
  subsequent activation of noncanonical NF-κB. The canonical NF-κB pathway is also
  activated in response to TWEAK. Activation of NF-κB drives autocrine TNFα production
  in TWEAK-sensitive cell lines. The loss of cellular cIAP1 and TRAF2 by FN14 signaling
  prevents their recruitment to TNF-R1 upon autocrine TNFα binding, and this promotes
  the formation of a death-inducing complex and apoptotic signaling.
