caption: Mechanistic models of AS. Fibrosis is a core process that can be affected
  by other factors to accelerate or slow down the onset of AS, which is caused by
  abnormal fibroblasts synthesizing excessive ECM, Some ECM components, such as Fbln1c,
  CCN2, POSTN, MMP, have been found to affect the occurrence and development of AS.
  In terms of inflammation, inflammation‐related signaling pathways and several immune
  cells and their secreted cytokines can affect fibrosis. Metabolic reprogramming
  contributes to AS altering fibroblast metabolic characteristics and metabolites,
  and targeted metabolic drugs have curative effects. Genetic characteristics of AS,
  and the identified functional SNPs. EMT can produce fibroblasts and myofibroblasts,
  accompanied by a decrease in epithelial markers and an increase in mesenchymal markers
  and transcription factors. Microbial species associated with AS were identified
  by sequencing. Other factors, such as epigenetic modifications, hypoxia, autophagy,
  and cell cycle participate in the development and progress of AS. Many preclinical
  treatments have been developed based on these mechanisms and can be divided into
  drug therapy, gene therapy, stem cell therapy, growth factor therapy protein therapy,
  and photodynamic therapy
