caption: Mechanism diagram of byakangelicin attenuating the progression of liver fibrosis.
  byakangelicin inhibits the proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cell
  by inhibiting the TGF/Smad3 signalling pathway and PDGF‐ERK, AKT and Stat3 signalling.
  In addition, byakangelicin could inhibit 4‐HNE–induced apoptosis and reduce death
  signalling through the ASK/JNK pathway in hepatocytes

  and fibrosis in mice.
