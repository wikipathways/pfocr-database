caption: ʟ-Ornithine biosynthesis metabolic pathways in C. glutamicum and strategies
  to improve ʟ-ornithine accumulation. The red × represented this pathways were inactivated.
  The blue font and arrows represented that pathways were attenuated. The green font
  and arrows indicated that pathways were overexpressed. The genes encoding enzymes
  involved in catalytically relevant reactions. pgi, encodes glucose-6-phosphate isomerase;
  zwf, encodes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; pgl, encodes 6-phosphogluconolactonase;
  tkt, encodes transketolase; tal, encodes transaldolase; opcA, encodes the putative
  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assembly protein; pfkA, encodes ATP-dependent
  phosphofructokinase; gap, encodes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; pyk,
  encodes pyruvate kinase; pta, encodes phosphotransacetylase; ackA, encodes acetate
  kinase; cat, encodes succinyl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase; ncgl2228, encodes a putative
  branched amino acid transporter protein; odhA, encodes a subunit of 2-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase; gdh, encodes glutamate dehydrogenase; ncgl1221, encodes glutamate
  transporter; proB, encodes gamma-glutamate kinase; cg3035, encodes N-acetylglutamate
  synthase; argB, encodes N-acetylglutamate kinase; argC, encodes N-acetyl-gamma-glutamylphosphate
  reductase; argD, encodes acetylornithine aminotransferase; argF, encodes ornithine
  carbamoyltransferase; argJ, encodes ornithine acetyltransferase; argR, encodes arginine
  repressor; lysE, encodes lysing transporter
