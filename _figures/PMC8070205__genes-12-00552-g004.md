caption: Mechanisms of replication forks restart. During progression, a functional
  RF might encounter obstacles, which will generate replication stress as a result
  of, for example, single strand breaks, blocking lesions, or fork arrests (a). This
  lesion will trigger the slowing of the RF or, in worst case scenario, its stalling
  and collapse (b). Protection of stalled/collapse fork from nuclease degradation
  (d), might allow replication to complete by merging with a converging fork (e).
  Persistent collapse fork will require remodeling and processing to permit the restart
  of the replication (c). One key step is fork reversal/regression, forming a 4-branch
  structure commonly called “chicken foot”, which will protect from extensive nuclease
  degradation (d) but also mediates both DSB-dependent or DSB-free fork restart. Controlled
  resection of newly synthetized DNA on a reversed fork or stalled fork, and backtracking
  of the fork, form a 3′-protuding end, which coated with RAD51 can mediate D-loop
  formation and homology search to initiate a DSB-free HR restart (f). One-ended DSB
  can arise from encounter of single strand break with the replication machinery,
  but also from nuclease cleavage of persistent stalled fork or reversed fork (d).
  Such one-ended DSB are then taken in charge by BIR, a specialized homology-directed
  repair pathway (f). Other types of lesions, such as blocking lesions, can trigger
  DNA damage tolerance pathways, which permit the bypass of sources of replication
  stalling and comprise three main mechanisms (h). Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS)
  involves specific DNA polymerase able to traverse a blocking lesion. Template switching
  is the re-annealing of the nascent strand to sequence in the newly synthetized DNA.
  Repriming consists of reinitializing replication downstream of the blocking lesions
  (h). Fork restart is schematized by red lines and arrows.

  description: Mechanisms of replication forks restart. During progression, a functional
