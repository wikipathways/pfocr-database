caption: Ratios of gene expression and metabolite concentration related to the pentose
  phosphate pathway in soybean roots or nodules after 24 h of the 5-mM nitrate treatment.
  (A) Ratios of gene expression and metabolite concentration in the roots. (B) Ratios
  of gene expression and metabolite concentration in the nodules. The model shows
  the metabolic map of glycolysis in the root or nodule cells. The color of squares
  above enzyme name and the number under the compound abbreviation indicate the same
  as .
