caption: Proposed pathway for grisechelin A (4) biosynthesis in S. griseus CB00830,
  featuring 7-chlorotryptophan and 7-chloro-3-hydroxyquinaldic acid as key intermediates
  and a NRPS biosynthetic machinery incorporating 7-chloro-3-hydroxyquinaldic acid
  and two molecules of l-cysteine to afford the nonribosomal peptide backbone, as
  supported by the isolation of shunt metabolites grisechelins B (5), C (6), and D
  (7), 4-chloroanthranilamide (8), and methyl 4-chloroanthranilate (9) from the same
  strain. “–S-Enz” depicts biosynthetic intermediates covalently tethered to the peptidyl
  carrier protein of the NRPS.
