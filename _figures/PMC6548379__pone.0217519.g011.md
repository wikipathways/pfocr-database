caption: Up or down arrows next to a metabolite or a protein show how the concentration
  or the activity changes in response to FLX, A-769662, or MET. After uptake into
  MLTC-1 cells MET and FLX accumulate in mitochondria where they inhibit the respiratory
  chain, lowering cytoplasmic ATP and increasing ADP and AMP. Increase of the AMP/ATP
  ratio activates AMPK, which in some way inhibits AC activity. Moreover, the decrease
  in ATP (AC substrate) also slowers cAMP synthesis. Unlike MET and FLX, treatment
  with A-769662 activates AMPK without inhibiting cellular ATP levels. As a consequence,
  the effect on the LH-stimulated cAMP pathway is decreased in MLTC-1 cells incubated
  with FLX, A-769662 or MET, the effect being AMPK-dependent and/or AMPK-independent;
  dashed black arrows mark are used for hypotheses.
