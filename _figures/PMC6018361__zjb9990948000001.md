caption: Pathway for guanine nucleotide synthesis. IMP is synthesized from successive
  enzymatic steps catalyzed by the Pur enzymes. IMP is then converted to xanthine
  monophosphate (XMP) by IMP dehydrogenase (GuaB). XMP can also be synthesized by
  xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Xpt) during xanthine uptake. GMP synthetase
  (GuaA) converts XMP to GMP, which is then phosphorylated to GTP by guanylate kinase
  (SAR1185, similar to B. subtilis YloD) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (SAR1478,
  similar to B. subtilis Ndk). GMP can also be formed via the guanosine salvage pathway
  by the concerted action of guanosine/deoxyguanosine-inosine/deoxyinosine phosphorylase
  (PupG) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hpt).
