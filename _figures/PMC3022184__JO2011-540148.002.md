caption: A proposed mechanism of TGF-α/EGFR/ras-MAPK activation loop in HNSCC. TGF-α
  binding to EGFR leads to dimerization and phosphorylation on lipid rafts. Phosphorylation
  of Y1068 and Y1086 is required for Grab2 binding and consequent ras activation.
  Activated EGFR dimmer is internalized via clathrin-coated pit. Cbl and CIN85 (overexpressed
  in 40% of HNSCC samples) are recruited at pY1045 and facilitate EGFR internalization.
  Phosphorylation of S1046/1047 is also necessary for EGFR internalization, albeit
  the precise role remains elusive. Recent evidence suggests that TGF-α-bound EGFRs
  signal in the cytosol, activating ras-MAPK cascade. Ras-enriched small cytosolic
  nanoparticles, “rasosomes,” might contribute to this signaling. Internalized TGF-α-bound
  EGFRs are sorted to early endosome. TGF-α dissociates from EGFR in the acidic environment
  of endosome. Free EGFR is recycled back via fast recycling back pathway to plasma
  membrane and is activated by TGF-α in a autocrine manner, resulting in constitutive
  activation of TGF-α/EGFR/ras-MAPK.
