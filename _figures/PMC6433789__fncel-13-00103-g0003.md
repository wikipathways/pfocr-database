caption: Model for p53-HSF1-PGC1α integrated responses in HD. Crosstalk between the
  transcription factors p53, HSF1 and PGC-1α regulate transcription, protein homeostasis,
  mitochondrial function and apoptosis. Different pathways (CREB/TAF4, CK2α’/Fbxw7
  and Mdm2) are altered in the presence of mutant HTT (mHTT) that independently lead
  to the deregulation of the levels and functions of all three transcription factors.
  However, HSF1 becomes a key player in the subsequent regulation of the levels of
  both p53 and PGC-1α by directly regulating transcription of PGC-1α and controlling
  p53 protein stability in HD. The potential role of p53 in the regulation of the
  HSF1 degradation pathway in HD would add a positive feedback into the p53-HSF1-PGC-1α
  axis triggering mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death.
