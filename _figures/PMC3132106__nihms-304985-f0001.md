caption: A summary of the extracellular interactions between Wnts, Wnt receptors and
  Wnt regulatory proteins. This simplified representation of the known extracellular
  interactions governing Wnt signaling depicts how secreted Wnt ligands can interact
  with receptors that trigger either the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway or other pathways
  like the Wnt/Ca pathway that act via other signaling mediators. As indicated in
  the figure, activation of Wnt/Ca receptors can inhibit the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.
  The portrayal of RYK reflects data suggesting that this receptor may be able to
  activate both the Wnt/beta-catenin as well as beta-catenin-independent Wnt signaling
  cascades (). Extracellular levels of Wnt ligand are titrated by binding to sFRPs,
  which exhibit homology to the cysteine-rich Wnt-binding domains of the FZD receptor.
  The secreted protein DKK antagonizes Wnt signaling via binding to the canonical
  Wnt co-receptor LRP5/6.
