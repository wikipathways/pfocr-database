caption: Metabolic reprogramming by mutp53. Mutp53 GOF activities are involved in
  different critical points of tumor metabolism. Mutp53 favors glucose uptake and
  hence the Warburg effect through membrane translocation of the glucose transporter,
  GLUT1, via the RhoA/ROCK1/2 axis. Moreover, mutp53 can induce the Warburg effect
  by directly inhibiting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major cellular energy
  sensor and a master regulator of metabolic homeostasis. AMPK downregulates fatty
  acid synthesis by inhibiting transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein 1 (SREBP1). Mutp53 increases the activity of SREBP1, a master regulator
  of fatty acids and cholesterol biosynthesis, and thus, the mevalonate (MVA) pathway.
