caption: Possible effects of Ascaris lumbricoides infection on atopy and asthma. The
  human response to exposure to A. lumbricoides is likely to be modified by host genetic
  factors and other factors including the intensity of infection and the age at which
  first infections occur. Exposure to A. lumbricoides could affect the development
  of allergen skin test reactivity in 4 ways (shown by paths 1-2-3, 1-2-4-7 and 1-4).
  Pathway 9-10 represents the effect of chronic infections - a high IgG4/low IgE response
  to A. lumbricoides or modified Th2 response [reference ] develops and may lead to
  the suppression of allergen skin test reactivity. The pathways leading from step1
  would be associated with a high IgE/low IgG4 response to A. lumbricoides. Pathway
  7 represents the enhancement of allergen skin test reactivity by an unknown mechanism.
  Exposure to A. lumbricoides could cause or increase asthma symptoms and bronchial
  hyper-reactivity via enhanced allergen skin test reactivity (paths 7-6, 1-2-3-6,
  and 1-4-6) or be independent of allergen skin test reactivity (paths 1-5 and 8)
  or independent of both anti-Ascaris IgE and allergen skin test reactivity (8). Suppression
  of asthma symptoms and or BHR could occur via path 9-11, although there is very
  limited evidence in support of this. Shown are published associations from cross-sectional
  studies and presumed causal directions (arrows). Reference numbers are shown in
  brackets.
