caption: Mechanism for the synergistic effects of BKM120 and olaparib on the death
  of MDA-MB-231 cells. BKM120 directly induces DNA damage through increasing cellular
  ROS. Meanwhile, BKM120 downregulates the expression of PARP1 and PARP2 to synergy
  the inhibition of olaparib in the repair of DNA single damage. Moreover, BKM120
  inhibits the HR repair of DNA double damage to sensitize cells to olaparib through
  regulation the PI3K/Akt/NFĸB/c-Myc pathway and PI3K/Akt/ /FOXM1/Exo1 pathway.
