caption: 'The dual role of Nrf2 in cancer.Notes: As long as it is kept under homeostatic
  control, Nrf2 activation protects cellular components like DNA from damaging insults
  arising from acute/temporary oxidative and xenobiotic stress. In this way, Nrf2
  prevents tumor development. When deregulated by 1) epigenetic and genetic alterations
  affecting the Keap1–Nrf2 pathway, 2) persistent stress conditions, and/or 3) oncogenic
  pathways, Nrf2 activation facilitates the growth and survival of transformed cells,
  thus promoting tumorigenesis.Abbreviations: ROS, reactive oxygen species; DNA, deoxyribonucleic
  acid; tBHQ, tert-butylhydroquinone; SFN, sulforaphane.'
