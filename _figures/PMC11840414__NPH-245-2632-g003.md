caption: The enzymatic activity of reductase for potato glycoalkaloid biosynthesis
  1 (RPG1) and RPG2. (a) Liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry (LC‐MS) analysis
  of the reaction products from the recombinant RPG1 and RPG2 proteins with 16‐iminiumsolanine
  and 22‐iminiumchaconine as substrates. The total ion current chromatogram obtained
  in positive ionization mode with a full‐scan range of 350–1250 m/z is shown. (b)
  The reaction time course of RPG1 and RPG2 using zwittersolanine as a substrate was
  also studied. (c) The biosynthetic pathways for α‐solanine/α‐chaconine from zwittersolanine/zwitterchaconine
  in potato (Solanum tuberosum) predicted based on the results of the in vitro assay.
  Red solid arrows indicate the primary reaction pathways, while gray dashed arrows
  represent minor reaction pathways
