caption: Environmental enrichment largely prevented age-SNCA-dependent disturbances
  and activated topologically relevant genes in the SNCA interactome with respect
  to both disturbance modes. (A) DEGs identified in response to EE for 12-month-old
  TG animals compared to 2162 age-SNCA-regulated DEGs (see ). (B) Distribution of
  265 overlapping DEGs (see A) with respect to their cluster/class assignments (see
  ). (C) Gene expression modulation of 265 DEGs overlapping with class 2 or 3 (254
  total) that significantly responded to the EE in TG animals. Expression medoids
  and standard deviation as well as cluster cardinalities shown. (D) Interaction network
  of DEGs attributed to the most significantly overrepresented pathway per cluster
  in class 2 and 3 (see ) and their relations to DEGs identified in TG12EE/TG12SE.
  Node colour indicates expression change of a gene in TG12SE/WT12SE and TG12EE/WT12SE.
  Node stroke reflects origin of a DEG, and node size its topological relevance in
  the network. Edges according to IPA knowledgebase (see Methods for details). (E)
  Characterisations of network genes (see D) with respect to their topological relevance
  and class 2 / 3 neighbourhood ratio. Node colour indicates relative compensation
  of gene expression change observed in TG animals through provision of EE. DEGs not
  significantly responding to the EE in TG animals shown in dark purple.
