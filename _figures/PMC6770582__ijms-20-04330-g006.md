caption: Schema of the present study. PCA based on mRNA levels analyzed by RNA sequencing
  was conducted in CCC and HGSC groups. The top three most highly expressed genes
  were chosen from the genes contributing to the first principal component of PCA
  in CCC and HGSC. Knockdown experiments for the selected genes showed that CPNE8
  and BHLHE41 promoted the proliferation of CCC- and HGSC-derived cells, respectively.
  Functional enrichment and pathway analyses also showed that these two genes were
  related to cancer cell growth signaling.
