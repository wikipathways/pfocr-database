caption: 'Simplified schematic of biosynthetic pathways (showing end-member compounds),
  central metabolic pathway precursors, and hydrogen sources for the five amino acids
  investigated in this study (proline, phenylalanine, leucine, valine, isoleucine).
  Hydrogen atoms are visually tracked from source to amino acid through colors: green
  indicates hydrogen from NAD(P)H, light blue from water, and the remaining colors
  correspond to hydrogen from organic precursors. Solid arrows denote single metabolic
  reactions; dashed arrows encompass multiple steps. Although NAD(P)H is used to reduce
  substrates in all amino acid biosynthetic pathways, some NAD(P)H-derived hydrogen
  is subsequently lost due to elimination or equilibration with water (see detailed
  biosynthetic pathways in Supplementary Figures S16–S19). EMP, Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas;
  ED, Entner-Doudoroff; PP, pentose phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid'
