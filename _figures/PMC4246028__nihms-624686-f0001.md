caption: 'Activated GRs rapidly enhance the translation of Arc and may influence trafficking
  of TrkB to the membrane surface and/or BDNF release. BDNF binding to its receptor
  TrkB leads to its phosphorylation, which results in the activation of ERK1/2, Akt
  and PLCγ. In parallel, activated GRs, via transcription-dependent mechanisms, also
  rapidly lead to CaMKIIα phosphorylation. The activation of ERK1/2, Akt, PLCγ, and
  CaMKIIα pathways independently or in concert can converge in CREB phosphorylation,
  which leads to the synthesis of BDNF. The newly synthesized BDNF sustains the activation
  of the pathways and results in persistent phosphorylation of CREB, CaMKIIα, and
  a downstream pre-synaptic target of CaMKIIα, phosopho-synapsin-1. Thus, GR activation
  recruits pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms to mediate memory consolidation []. Abbreviations:
  GR, glucocorticoid receptor; TrkB, tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor; BDNF,
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CaMKIIα, Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase α; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; ERK, extracellular signal
  regulated kinases; Akt, protein kinase B; PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ; Arc, activity
  regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein; GluA1, AMPA receptor subunit A1; DAG,
  diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol triphosphate. Figure adapted from Finsterwald and
