caption: 'The “circulating wound” model. Clonal platelets and microvesicles generate
  an excessive release of tissue factor (TF), which occurs after tissue and vascular
  lesions. The triggering of the coagulation cascade results in an increased generation
  of thrombin, which acts as a protease and activates protease-activated receptors
  (PARs). PARs perform multiple functions: they rapidly convert functional fibrinogen
  into fibrin (by making the fibrinogen binding sites on platelets disappear, PFR),
  promote vasoconstriction, and ensure the platelets are activated. Signalling crosstalk
  with the TGF-beta pathway contributes to the genesis of inflammation and fibrosis.'
