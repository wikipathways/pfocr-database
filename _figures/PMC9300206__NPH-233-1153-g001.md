caption: Working model for molecular function of RXR1/RabD2c in plants. RXR1/RabD2c
  is a novel module that represses root hair (RH) elongation independently of the
  stimulating effect of the phytohormone auxin and its downstream signaling pathway
  (Bhosale et al., ). When environmental phosphorus (P) nutrient is limiting, PHR1/PHL1‐dependent
  RXR1 expression and protein strongly increase. RXR1 interacts with GTP‐bound RabD2c
  through its conserved DUF506 domain (indicated in dark gray), whereas RXR1‐specific
  sequences (in light gray) are required to inhibit RH elongation growth. Biochemical
  and co‐localization evidence further suggest RXR1 might interact with UGE4, through
  RXR1‐specific sequences. RXR1 interaction with other proteins may modulate additional
  P‐limitation responses. Solid line, experimentally supported; broken line, hypothetical.
  Blunt‐ended line, inhibition; arrow, activation.
