caption: L-DOPA Biosynthetic pathway (A) L-DOPA is synthesised through hydroxylation
  of tyrosine. Further hydroxylation by CYP76AD1, in beetroot, for example, results
  in cyclo-DOPA. (B) Melanin formation is initiated through enzymatic oxidation of
  L-DOPA to dopaquinone. This is followed by enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidation
  reactions that result in the formation of leucodopachrome that is further oxidised
  to melanin, via several non-enzymatic steps.
