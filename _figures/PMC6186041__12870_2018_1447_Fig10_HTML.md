caption: Simplified scheme showing limonoid biosynthesis in neem tree being contributed
  by isoprene units formed through MVA pathways evident from the labeling experiment
  with 13C glucose. C-seco and ring intact limonoid are represented in yellow and
  green boxes respectively. (Alternate isoprene units of the limonoid skeleton are
  shown in pink and blue, dotted arrow shown here are the uncharacterized steps in
  the pathway)
