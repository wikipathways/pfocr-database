caption: Metabolic pathway of the citric acid cycle, urea cycle, and amino acid metabolismAmino
  acid metabolism is biochemical processes by which the various amino acids are produced
  from other substances. Pyruvic acid (pyruvate) is prepared from glucose through
  glycolysis. Pyruvate is metabolized to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. Acetyl-CoA
  is also from the breakdown of sugars by glycolysis that yield pyruvate that in turn
  is decarboxylated by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). The citric acid cycle
  (also known as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or the Krebs cycle) begins with
  the transfer of a two-carbon acetyl group from acetyl CoA to the four-carbon acceptor
  substance oxaloacetate to form six-carbon substance (citrate). In the citric acid
  cycle, α-ketoglutarate is synthesized from isocitric acid (isocitrate) by isocitrate
  dehydrogenase (IDH2/3), and is metabolized to succinyl-CoA by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent
  dioxygenase (2-OGDO). N-acetylglutamic acid is synthesized from glutamic acid and
  acetyl-CoA by N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS). Arginine is synthesized from citrulline
  in the urea cycle, and plays a role in the production of nitric oxide (NO). β-alanine
  is synthesized from aspartate by aspartate 1-decarboxylase, and is also the rate-limiting
  precursor of carnosine. Substances in the dark box are significantly altered in
  the serum from bipolar disorder (BD) patients.
