caption: TP4-mediated macrophage reprogramming. G. vaginalis-secreted virulence factors
  cause macrophages to exhibit a pro-inflammatory M1 type polarization. Treatment
  with TP4 switches the M1 macrophages toward resolving (M2c) or tissue repair (M2a)
  phenotypes. Direct application of TP4 to macrophages induces IL-10 expression via
  the MAPK/ERK pathway, which results in activation of downstream STAT3 signaling
  and promotion of M2c-related phenotypes. On the other hand, TP4 promotes vaginal
  epithelial cells to secret TSG-6, which in turn induces activation of downstream
  STAT6 signaling and promotes M2a-related phenotypes.
