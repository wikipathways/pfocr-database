caption: The schematic illustration of the potential molecular mechanism of miR‐148a‐3p
  as a tumour suppressor in PC. miR‐148a‐3p was remarkably down‐regulated in PC and
  negatively regulated Wnt1, which was a direct functional target of miR‐148a‐3p.
  miR‐148a‐3p suppressed EMT and stemness properties as well as the proliferation,
  migration and invasion via inhibiting Wnt1‐mediated Wnt/β‐catenin pathway in PC

  properties via Wnt1‐mediated Wnt/β‐catenin pathway in pancreatic cancer.
