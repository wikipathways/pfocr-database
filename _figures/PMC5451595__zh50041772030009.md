caption: 'Model for CFTR-mediated regulation of the airway glucose barrier. A: in
  normal airway epithelia without insulin stimulation, nutrients like glucose (red)
  slowly traverse the tight junction-regulated paracellular pathway (purple) while
  constitutive glucose transporters (blue) mediate baseline glucose metabolism and
  clearance from the paracellular space. Activity of CFTR (green) is normal, whereas
  Glut4 transporter (yellow) is stored in GSVs near the apical plasma membrane. B:
  airway epithelia stimulated with insulin decrease the rate of paracellular flux
  while simultaneously reducing the amount of glucose in the apical space through
  the activity of translocated Glut4 in the apical plasma membrane. C: in cystic fibrosis
  airway epithelia, the paracellular route is less stringent (dashed purple box) compared
  with normal epithelia. This results in more glucose being transported through the
  tight junction-mediated barrier, where the constitutive glucose transporters act
  to reduce the amount of glucose in the apical space. CFTR activity is reduced, effectively
  changing the fluid and ion balance of CF airway epithelia. D: in CF epithelia, insulin
  fails to activate GSV translocation, effectively reducing insulin-stimulated Glut4
  activity while simultaneously allowing small molecules <10 kDa through the paracellular
  barrier, effectively allowing nutrient accumulation in the apical space.'
