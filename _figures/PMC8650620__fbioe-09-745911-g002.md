caption: 'Main cellular populations in bone, role and NADPH oxidases isoforms expressed,
  paramount for ROS-mediated differentiation, activity and fate of osteoblasts and
  osteoclasts. Under mechanical loading, Nox2 is activated in osteocytes, producing
  ROS and leading to ROS-mediated decrease in sclerostin and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. Bone marrow macrophages express Nox2. During RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation,
  Nox2 is suppressed and Nox4 is upregulated by RANKL. Overexpression of Nox4 increases
  adipogenesis and not osteogenesis. Osteogenic differentiation involves parathormone
  (PTH) and Wnt signalling pathways. Nox1 and Nox2 are inducible and thought to have
  a role in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Osteoprotegerin expression
  is induced by physiological mechanical stimulation and inhibits osteoclasteogenesis.
  Nox4 synthetizes H2O2 and drives cell differentiation. Insert: bone cell regulation
  and mechanotransduction involves several ROS-sensitive pathways.'
