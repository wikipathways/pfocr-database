caption: 'In the protective model of live-attenuated sporozoite vaccines [irradiated
  sporozoites (irrSPZs) or genetically attenuated parasites (GAPs)], elimination of
  pre-erythrocytic-stage parasites is primarily dependent on antigen-specific and
  major histocompatability complex (MHC)-restricted CD8+ T cells, whereas recombinant
  vaccines, such as the CSP-based RTS,S vaccine, are primarily dependent on CD4+ T
  cells. Naive CD8+ T cells can be primed by dendritic cells (DCs) that encounter
  SPZs at skin-draining lymph nodes, by parasite-traversed or -infected hepatocytes
  in the liver (direct priming), or by other DCs that uptake antigens provided by
  traversed and infected hepatocytes, or hepatocytes that die in the liver (crosspriming).
  Primed CD8+ T cells will then proliferate and differentiate to effector (TEM) or
  central memory (TCM) CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells can mediate killing of liver stage
  (LS)-infected hepatocytes via several mechanisms: (a) release of perforin and granzyme
  B, which causes necrosis of the infected hepatocyte; (b) apoptosis, a programmed
  cell death through the Fas–FasL signalling pathway; (c) release of IFN-γ, via signal
  transducers associated with transcription (STAT) to activate inducible nitric oxide
  synthase (iNOS), which then induces the NO pathway to destroy the infected hepatocyte;
  (d) IFN-γ can also promote IL-12 release from DCs, macrophages or other cells to
  activate the natural killer (NK) and CD4+ T cells that consequently increase the
  IFN-γ-dependent killing of LS-infected hepatocytes'
