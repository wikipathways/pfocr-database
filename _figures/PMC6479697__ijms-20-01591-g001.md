caption: Physical activity as an mTOR suppressor can alleviate cognitive dysfunction
  and rescue abnormal miRNAs in AD for regulating functional status of autophagy,
  tau hyperphosphorylation, and the accumulation of Aβ and NFTs, thus accomplishing
  the mitigation of AD. Meanwhile, mTOR could be considered as the preventive and
  therapeutic target to develop novel and effective intervention strategies for AD
  and other neurodegenerative diseases. The solid arrows present the activation and
  the dotted arrows present the suppression, as well as question symbols presents
  the uncertainty.
