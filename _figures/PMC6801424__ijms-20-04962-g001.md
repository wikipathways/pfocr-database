caption: Schematic summary of the metabolic network. ATP can be generated from glucose
  though two integrated pathways. Glucose enters the cell via Glut1 and undergoes
  to enzymatic breakdown to pyruvate in the glycolysis pathway in the cytoplasm. The
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle encompasses the second pathway, where pyruvate is
  converted to acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria to fuel oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).
  Anaerobic glucose catabolism transforms pyruvate into lactate that is transported
  out of the cell. Other substrates can also be metabolized in the TCA cycle, such
  as fatty acids via β-oxidation and glutamine via glutaminolysis.
