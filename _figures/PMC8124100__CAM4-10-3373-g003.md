caption: ONC201 increases endoplasmic reticulum stress in both high‐grade and low‐grade
  ovarian cancer cells; overwhelming pro‐survival signals and activating the pro‐death
  arm of the unfolded protein response pathway. In addition, a weekly oral dose of
  ONC201 lowers the tumor burden in mice. This is a promising therapeutic agent in
  OVCA treatment and should be considered for clinical translation
