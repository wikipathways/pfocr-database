caption: Regulation of FOXO1 protein activation. A) Regulatory network revealed in
  paleo-ESF of the opossum Monodelphis domestica (for evidence, see ). Progesterone
  leads to the inhibition of degradation of FOXO1 protein, which leads to its accumulation
  in the cytoplasm. Presence of ROS and cAMP, as well as PGE2 through the activation
  of PGE2 receptor 4 (PTGER4 aka EP4) stimulation, inhibits the nuclear export of
  FOXO1 and thus retention of FOXO1 in the nucleus, where it positively influences
  the transcription of anti-oxidant enzymes like catalase and gluthathione peroxidase.
  In this model we assume that PGE2 acts through PKA and cAMP to induce the NADPH
  oxidase 4 (NOX4) to produce the cytoplasmic ROS, which is parsimonious but not yet
  directly shown. B) Ancestral activation of FOXO1 in response to ROS, through activation
  of ERK1/2 signaling found in many other cells. The network in the opossum ESF, as
  shown in A), is likely derived from this generic oxidative stress pathway by two
  evolutionary events. First, the evolution of NOX4 activation by PGE2, though this
  also could be a generic pathway because PGE2 has been shown to activate NOX4 through
  PTGER4 in liver cells[]. Second, the inhibition of FOXO1 degradation by progesterone
  through its receptor isoform A, PGR-A. In this way, the activation of FOXO1 through
  the generic oxidative stress reaction becomes internalized, i.e., activated through
  physiological signals rather than stressors.
