caption: Regulation of YAP/TAZ in epidermal cells. Hippo signalling via MOB1A/MOB1B
  and LATS1/LATS2 inhibits YAP/TAZ via serine phosphorylation (yellow) to promote
  cytoplasmic retention. The kinases activating MOB1A/MOB1B and LATS1/LATS2 are not
  known. Integrin (ITG)–SRC signalling promotes YAP/TAZ nuclear localisation and TEAD
  binding. SRC can directly phosphorylate YAP/TAZ on tyrosine residues (orange) but
  may also act indirectly to activate Hippo signalling. A contractile F-actin-myosin
  cytoskeleton helps stabilise ITGβ1 adhesions and thus may contribute to SRC activation,
  while ITGβ4 adhesions are part of hemidesmosomal complexes that are stabilised by
  keratin intermediate filaments (not shown). At adherens junctions, α-catenin controls
  YAP/TAZ activity and phosphorylation by modulating its interaction with 14-3-3 and
  the PP2A phosphatase. In proliferating cells of the sebaceous gland, activation
  of caspase-3 cleaves α-catenin, thus facilitating the activation and nuclear translocation
  of YAP/TAZ. α-catenin can also inhibit ITGβ4-mediated direct activation of SRC.
  Putative nuclear interactions of YAP/TAZ with other transcription factors are also
  indicated.
