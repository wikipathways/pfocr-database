caption: The effects of hypoxic or oxygenated TME on the fate, functionality, and
  antitumor activity of T cell or CAR T cells. The upper panel shows the hypoxic TME.
  In this condition, the low level of O2 leads to the stabilization of HIF-1α which
  elevates the expression level of CD39 and CD73 leading to the excessive production
  of adenosine. Adenosine binds to A2AR causing an elevation in the level of cAMP,
  and cAMP activates PKA. Further on, PKA inhibits TCR and CAR signaling and upregulates
  the expression of immunosuppresion contributors via CRE. Moreover, HIF-1α elevates
  the expression level of immunosuppressive genes through HRE. The activated CRE and
  HRE signaling cascades together reduce the level of INF-γ, IL-12, and IL-2 expression
  and upregulate TGF-β, IL-10, PD-1, CTLA-4, COX-2, and Treg expression. In the lower
  panel, supplemental oxygenation or using oxygenation agents elevates the level of
  O2, therefore, the downstream signaling pathway cannot proceed as it would in the
  case of a hypoxic microenvironment. TME, tumor microenvironment; HIF-1α, Hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1α; A2AR, A2A adenosine receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; CRE, cAMP Response
  Element; CREB, cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein; HRE, Hypoxia Response Element;
  TCR, T cell receptor; CAR, chimeric antigen receptor.
