caption: Staphylococcus aureus prevents Nrf2 pathway activation in THP-1 macrophages
  through upregulation of MAPK/p38 and downregulation of p62/SQTM1, scheme modified
  from [35]. (1) During the initial phase of infection, S. aureus causes an increase
  in ROS that activates Nrf2. (2) Upon internalization, S. aureus induces the expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and CCL2) by activating the MAPK
  signaling pathway. This causes p38 phosphorylation that promotes bacterial cell
  survival and decreases the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. (3)
  S. aureus manages to suppress the cellular antioxidant response by sequestering
  the p62/SQSTM1-Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathways. This bacterium causes a decrease in
  p62/SQTM1 phosphorylation at Ser349, which diminishes its affinity for the Keap1
  protein, thereby preventing formation of the p62-Keap1 complex and its degradation
  through the autophagy pathway. The final outcome of this mechanism is the repression
  of Nrf2. (4) Selective activation of Nrf2 decreased MAPK/p38 phosphorylation that
  increases p62 phosphorylation at Ser349 and its affinity for Keap1. Then, Keap1
  is degraded via autophagy and Nrf2 translocates to nucleus to activate the antioxidant
  response, which could aid in S. aureus clearance. (5) Keap1 negatively regulates
  NF-κB by interacting with IKKβ. Ultimately, this stabilizes IκBα. CCL2, chemokine
