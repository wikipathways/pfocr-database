caption: Angiogenic signaling pathway and angiogenesis. Tumor cell induces a complex
  cascade of angiogenic signaling and activates downstream cellular events in multiple
  cell types, especially the endothelial cells, leading to angiogenesis. Pro-angiogenic
  factors include fibroblast growth factor (FGF) families, vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factors-alpha/beta
  (TGF-α/β), and angiopoietin (Ang 1,2) and the associated receptors. The detachment
  of the perivascular cells from the mature blood vessels initiates vessel remodeling
  and endothelial cell proliferation. Platelets become activated and recruited to
  the sites of the exposed basement membrane. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) produce
  angiogenic factors such as VEGF, MMPs and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA).
  On the other hand, precursor endothelial cells move to the perceived wound site
  and release angiogenic factors. The activated endothelial cells release proteases
  and lead to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, followed by directional sprouting.
  The signaling cascades activate tube formation and branching, followed by vessel
  arterio-venous patterning and maturation. Cancer progenitor/stem cells can differentiate
  to endothelial cells, and thereby participates directly in angiogenesis.
