caption: Schematic of innate immune signaling triggered by WNV infection through cytosolic
  RLRs or endosomal TLRs. Solid lines indicate the primary response. Broken lines
  indicate the amplification response driven by IRF-7 after initial IFN production
  by the infected cell. P denotes phosphorylation; Ubq denotes ubiquitin modification.
  Infection by WNV produces RNA intermediates in the cytosol that are detected as
  non-self by the host RLR. RIG-I acts as the main sensor for WNV during the early
  steps of infection. RIG-I activation promotes interaction with IPS-1 that leads
  to the recruitment of TRAF3, TBK1 and Iκκ-ε or NEMO, Iκκ–α, and Iκκ–β, which results
  in activation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3 and NF-κB, respectively. Small
  amounts of constitutively produced IRF-7 also may be activated via this pathway.
  IRF-3, IRF-7, and NF-κB bind the IFN-β gene promoter and induce transcription. Secretion
  of IFN-β by the infected cells results in paracrine type I IFN signaling through
  IFNAR. Activation of IFNAR induces phosphorylation of JAK1 and Tyk2, which can promote
  the formation of the heterotrimer ISGF3 formed by STAT1, STAT2 and IRF-9. Ultimately,
  translocation into the nucleus of ISGF3 induces hundreds of interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISG), including IRF-7. During late phases of infection, detection of WNV
  also relies on MDA5, whereas Iκκ-ε promotes specific ISG induction through phosphorylation
  of STAT1 on serine 708. Induction of IFN-α genes (except IFN-α4) occurs mainly via
  the transcriptional activity of IRF-7. Putative mechanisms by which WNV antagonizes
  the type I IFN response are marked and include (a) a delay in recognition of WNV
  RNA by RIG-I []; (b) attenuation of TLR3 signaling by the NS1 protein []; (c) reduction
  in IFN-β gene transcription by the viral NS2A protein []; (d) blockade of phosphorylation
  of Tyk2 []; (e) down-regulation of IFNAR expression through virus-induced protein
  degradation pathways []; and (f) inactivation of the IFN-regulated JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway [] through redistribution of cellular cholesterol [].
