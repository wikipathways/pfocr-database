caption: Scheme illustrating the potential mechanism of anandamide uptake and degradation.
  Anandamide can be internalized by neurons through a yet unidentified transport mechanism,
  “the endocannabinoid transporter”. Once inside a neuron, AEA is rapidly cleaved
  by the hydrolytic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), releasing arachidonic
  acid (AA) and ethanolamine (EA). Alternatively, different lipoxygenases (LOXs) and
  cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) can metabolize AEA, generating hydroxyl derivatives of
  AEA (HAEAs) and prostaglandins-ethanolamides (PG-EAs), respectively. On the other
  hand, in FAAH (-/-) mice, AEA is converted into PC-AEA by an unidentified biosynthetic
  pathway, and PC-AEA can in turn be catabolized to AA by choline-specific phosphodiesterase
  (NPP6). AMT, anandamide membrane transporter.
