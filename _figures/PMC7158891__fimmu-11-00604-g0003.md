caption: An integrated overview of the immunosuppressive signaling pathways involved
  in the interaction between exosomal PD-L1 and T cells. Tumor-derived exosomal PD-L1
  can bind to PD-1 on T cells to inhibit T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Interactions
  between PD-L1 and PD-1 can induce phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor
  tyrosine based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and the immunoreceptor tyrosine based switch
  motif (ITSM). The phosphorylated ITIM and ITSM recruit the SHP-1 and SHP-2 protein
  tyrosine phosphatases to attenuate activating signals of T cells. Exosomal PD-L1
  blocks TCR-mediated T cell activation. Exosomal PD-L1 can deliver inhibitory signals
  to activate T cells by downregulating CD69, CD28, and CD80 expression on the surface
  of T cells. Exosomal PD-L1 inhibits CD3/CD28-triggered T cell activation signaling
  pathways, including CD3/CD28-induced ERK phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. Exosomal
  PD-L1 inhibits the proliferation, cytokine production and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T
  cells by inhibiting the expression of granzyme B (GzmB) and inhibiting the production
  of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). GzmB is the effector molecule
  of cytotoxic activity in T cells, and IL-2 and TNF can enhance cytotoxic T lymphocyte
  (CTL) activation and survival via the JAK1/JAK3-STAT5 pathway. Exosomal PD-L1 may
  also affect immunosuppression through other unknown mechanisms, which are worth
  further study.
