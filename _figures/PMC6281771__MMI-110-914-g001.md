caption: 'Streptococcus mutans regulates genetic competence through multiple layers
  of control (Smith and Spatafora, ; Tian et al., ; Shanker and Federle, ). Two quorum
  signals (CSP and XIP), together with other environmental inputs, drive the master
  competence regulator ComX, which is post‐translationally regulated by the MecA/ClpCP
  proteolytic system. The peptide CSP (competence stimulating peptide) is detected
  by the ComDE two component system, leading to phosphorylation of the response regulator
  ComE, which activates transcription of bacteriocin genes such as cipB. Through a
  pathway not yet understood, activation of cipB is integrated with other environmental
  cues to stimulate the ComRS system, which is the immediate regulator of comX. ComX,
  also called SigX, is an alternative sigma factor that directly controls the nine‐gene
  operon comYA‐I and other genes required for transformation. The ComRS system includes
  the peptide ComS and the cytosolic receptor ComR. ComS is the precursor for the
  quorum‐sensing peptide XIP (SigX‐inducing peptide). In defined growth medium (lacking
  assorted small peptides), extracellular XIP is imported by the Ami/Opp permease
  and interacts with ComR to form a transcriptional activator for both comS and comX.
  As a result comX is uniformly (population‐wide) activated in defined media containing
  XIP. In complex media, which are rich in assorted small peptides, extracellular
  XIP does not activate comS and comX; in this case XIP (or possibly its precursor
  ComS) is proposed to interact with ComR intracellularly, so that both comS and comX
  are driven by the bistable, intracellular transcriptional feedback loop involving
  comS and the ComRS complex (Son et al., ). As a result comX is heterogeneously (bimodal
  in population) activated in complex media. The MecA/ClpCP system provides posttranslational
  regulation of ComX: The adapter protein MecA interacts with ClpC to target ComX
  for degradation by the protease ClpP. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]'
