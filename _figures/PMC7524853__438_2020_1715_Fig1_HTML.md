caption: The carbon catabolite repression pathway. a When hexoses are absent, the
  Snf1 kinase is active and phosphorylates Mig1, which localizes to the cytoplasm.
  This enables expression from promoters, such as the SUC2 and HXK1 promoter. b Available
  hexoses are transported into the cell by hexose transporters and subsequently phosphorylated
  by Hxk1, Hxk2 and/or Glk1 enzymes. All hexose-phosphates are isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate
  and enter glycolysis. Snf1 kinase is inhibited through unknown mechanisms, which
  relieves the inhibitory phosphorylation of Mig1 and allows it to act as a transcriptional
  repressor of SUC2 and HXK1 expression in the nucleus. Hxk2 takes part in repression
  of SUC2 in the nucleus
papertitle: Mig1 localization exhibits biphasic behavior which is controlled by both
  metabolic and regulatory roles of the sugar kinases.
