caption: The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway is active (left side) in the context of
  s-Cadherin interactions that promote epithelial cell:cell polarity. Under these
  conditions, E-Cadherin signaling maintains TAZ phosphorylation (gray circle) and
  localization in the cytosol. Upon induction of oncogenic events (right side), which
  include sE-Cad production and cooperation with HER2 receptors, the Hippo pathway
  is inactivated promoting TAZ translocation (black hashed arrow) to the nucleus where
  it can interact with transcription factors, such as RUNX2, which are responsible
  for activation of genes that promote cell invasion, survival, and tumorsphere formation.
  Several therapeutic targets are indicated (pink) that inhibit the tumorigenic phenotype
  described in this study (tumorsphere formation), including Herceptin/Lapatinib targeting
  of HER2, DECMA-1 targeting of sE-Cad, and CADD522 targeting of RUNX2.
