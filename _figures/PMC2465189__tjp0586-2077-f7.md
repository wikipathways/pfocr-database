caption: A, in DAB, the glia no longer supply adequate alanine. The photoreceptors
  can oxidize alanine, pyruvate, lactate and perhaps proline. The glial pathway from
  glucose to alanine is blocked. B, measurements of [NH4+]e show that MeAIB inhibits
  the alanine/ammonium shuttle. Another substrate, perhaps lactate, is supplied by
  the glia. C, suggested major metabolic traffic in vivo. The alanine/ammonium shuttle
  dominates. Proline and glycogen are involved in ways that are not fully understood.
