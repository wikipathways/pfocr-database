caption: Germinal-center B-cell-like (GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) derived
  from normal germinal-center centroblasts. BCL2 is deregulated by t(14;18) translocations.
  PTEN deletions and amplification of miR-17-92 lead to deregulation of the PI3K/mTOR
  pathway. ING1 deletions, p53 mutations, and MDM2 gain/amplification are associated
  with genomic instability. Addiction to these signaling pathways conveys vulnerability
  to specific inhibitors.
