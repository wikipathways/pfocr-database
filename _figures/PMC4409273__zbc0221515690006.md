caption: Modulation of glycogen stores in astrocytes by insulin and IGF-1. After the
  binding of insulin or IGF-1 to their receptors, several mutual signaling pathways
  may be activated. The pathway leading to glycogen synthesis is the PI3K/Akt pathway.
  Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway inactivates GSK-3β. GSK-3β is also inactivated
  through the PKA and PKC pathways. Inactivated GSK-3β results in less phosphorylated
  and thus more active glycogen synthase (GS), which in turn depletes intracellular
  glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and lowers the glucose concentration. GLUT1 and GLUT3
  are major glucose transporters in astrocytes; GLUT4 is also present. Glucose is
  phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) to produce glucose 6-phosphate, which in turn
  negatively regulates the activity of hexokinase. The effect of IGF-1 is inhibited
  by a selective IGF1R inhibitor, PPP, and the PI3K/Akt pathway is inhibited by wortmannin,
  a selective PI3K inhibitor.
