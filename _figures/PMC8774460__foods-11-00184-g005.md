caption: Manually linked metabolic pathway map based on the KEGG database involving
  glycerophospholipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism,
  and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis metabolism. Beneath each
  metabolite, red represents HF versus CT group and green represents HF4H versus HF
  group. The up arrows showed the metabolites were up-regulated and the down arrows
  showed the metabolites were down-regulated. Horizontal lines showed no significant
  difference in metabolites.
