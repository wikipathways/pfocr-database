caption: Model illustrating how nonneuronal 5-HT acts through the Hh signaling pathway
  to regulate PTHrP. Alteration of the methylation status of the Shh gene promoter
  by 5-HT increases Shh mRNA expression, which then initiates signal transduction
  through Smo and the Glis, culminating in the regulation of Hh target genes, including
  PTHrP. Secreted PTHrP exerts its paracrine effects in bone, leading to OC activation
  impacting blood calcium (Ca2+) levels. M, methyl group.
