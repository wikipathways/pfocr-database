caption: Cross-talk between growth factors and integrins in endothelial cells. VEGF
  binding to VEGFR-2 results in receptor dimerization and phosphorylation of specific
  tyrosine residues within the intracellular domain of the receptor. PLCγ, Sck, and
  VRAP (not depicted) all interact directly with VEGFR-2. The mechanism of activation
  of FAK, Src, MAPK, PI 3-kinase, and AKT by VEGFR-2 is less clearly understood. Recent
  work indicates that VEGF-mediated Src activation promotes FAK association with αVβ5.
  The extracellular domain of β3 directs association of αVβ3 with VEGFR-2. Engagement
  of either VEGFR-2 or αVβ3 enhances the function of the reciprocal receptor. Binding
  of ECM proteins to αVβ3 triggers phosphorylation of tyrosine residues located in
  the intracellular domain of the β3 chain and induces receptor clustering. Signaling
  molecules activated by ligation and/or clustering of αVβ3 include FAK, Src, MAPK,
  PI 3-kinase, and Rho family members. Recent evidence suggests a role for an unidentified
  arachidonic acid (AA) metabolite in αVβ3 activation of Rac. Phosphorylation of intracellular
  tyrosine residues of VEGFR-2 occurs in response to αVβ3 ligation. The p53/bax pathway
  linked to apoptosis is suppressed by αVβ3 engagement. The proapoptotic mediator
  caspase 8 may be activated by unligated αVβ3-dependent membrane recruitment. Additionally,
  ligation of either αVβ3 or αVβ5 may influence the function of the reciprocal receptor.
