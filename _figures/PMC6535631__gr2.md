caption: Detailed neuronal connections in modules of the amygdala network. Triangles
  represent excitatory neurons and circles inhibitory neurons. A. The LA module. This
  consists of principal excitatory neurons (LA) that project out of the module, and
  which receive inputs from the US pathway, the CS pathway, as well as specialized
  inhibitory inputs from SOM-containing and PV-containing inhibitory interneurons
  as shown. The SOM neurons receive specialized inhibitory inputs from both PV- and
  CCK-VIP- containing inhibitory neurons; the PV neurons receive the CS input as well
  as inhibitory input from the CCK-VIP containing inhibitory neurons that in turn
  receive input from the US pathway. The specialized inhibitory neurons in this module
  amount to 75% of all the inhibitory neurons (the remaining 25% inhibitory neurons
  are not shown), that receive collateral connections from the principal excitatory
  neurons and which in turn synapse on these (). B. The BAF module. This consists
  of principal excitatory neurons (BAF) that project out of the module and which receive
  inhibition from specialized PV-containing inhibitory neurons. (The specialized inhibitory
  neurons in this module amount to 20% of all the inhibitory neuronsin the module
  and these receive collateral connections from the principal excitatory neurons,
  which in turn synapse on these (the remaining 80% inhibitory neurons are not shown)).
  Both the BAF and the inhibitory neurons receive inputs from the LA output neurons,
  as well as from the output of BAE principal excitatory neurons (). The output from
  this module is mainly to the CEM module. C. The BAE module. This consists of principal
  excitatory neurons (BAE) that project out of the module and which receive inhibition
  from specialized CCK-containing inhibitory neurons (the specialized inhibitory neurons
  in this module amount to 20% of all the inhibitory neurons, which receive collateral
  connections from the principal excitatory neurons and which in turn synapse on these
  (the remaining 80% inhibitory neurons are not shown)). Both the BAE and the inhibitory
  neurons receive inputs from the LA output neurons. The infra-limbic cortex (IL)
  projects to BAE principal excitatory neurons. The output from this module is to
  the ITC and BAF modules. Specialized mechanisms upon which the output of this module
  is dependent are the strengthening of previously weak LA to BAE synapses by LTP
  following concomitant excitation of the BAE principal neurons by IL at the time
  of LA input to BAE and the release of endocannabinoids from excited BAE principal
  neurons to decrease the release of GABA from inhibitory interneurons of the CCK
  variety. Together these mechanisms can greatly increase the output of the BAE principal
  neurons in response to a LA input. D. Neurons of two ITC modules are shown. Each
  of these consists only of intercalated inhibitory (ITC) neurons that are distinguished
  on the basis of their geographical position as dorsal (ITCd) or ventral (ITCv).
  The neurons in the ITCd module receive input from LA (see ) whereas those in the
  ITCv module receive input from both ITCd neurons and the BAE module, with the ITCv
  neurons then projecting to the CEM module (not shown). Each of these modules could
  have been represented by a separate figure, but have not to save space E. Neurons
  of two CEL modules are shown here. Each of these consists only of CEL neurons, CELon
  and CELoff, that mutually inhibit each others module. The CELon module exclusively
  receives inputs from the LA, whereas the CELoff module receives inputs from the
  ITCd module. The output of the CELoff module is to CEM and is of course inhibitory.
  The CEM module (not shown) contains principal excitatory neurons and inhibitory
  interneurons with recurrent collaterals as specified in the Methods.
