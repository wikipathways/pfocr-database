caption: Hippo pathway. (a) During signaling pathway; the upstream components (MST1/1,
  LATS1/2) phosphorylate the downstream components and result in inactivation of pathway.
  (b) During GC; the expression of MST1/2 and LATS1/2 decreased and failed to phosphorylate
  YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ translocates to the nucleus and binds to the TEAD, resulting in
  transcription of target genes.
