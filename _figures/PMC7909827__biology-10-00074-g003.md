caption: Paracrine interaction between β-cells and δ-cells. (A) δ-cells are directly
  coupled to β-cells via gap junction. (B) Insulin (grey) secreted by β-cells promotes
  somatostatin secretion via stimulation of sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter
  2 (SGLT2). Na+-dependent glucose uptake induced by SGLT2 triggers a small depolarizing
  current and leads to action potential firing and opening of VGCC. (C) Urocortin3
  (Ucn3, green, co-secreted with insulin, which is marked as grey) potentiates somatostatin
  release by activating type 2 corticotropin releasing hormone receptor (Crhr2) on
  δ-cells. The action of Ucn3 is mediated through both the cAMP-dependent pathway
  and epigenetic regulation of a super-complex comprising cullin 4B-RING E3 ligase
  (CRL4B) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). In response to Ucn3 stimulation,
  the decreased expression of cullin 4B (CUL4B) and subunit histone-lysine N-methyltransferase
  EZH2 releases the repressive role of the CRL4B-PRC2 complex in the expression of
  Cav1.2 and adenylyl cyclase 6 (AC6), thereby increasing levels for second messengers
  Ca2+ and cAMP and ultimately leading to increased somatostatin secretion. (D) γ-Aminobutyric
  acid (GABA, yellow, co-secreted with insulin, which is marked as grey), via GABAA
  receptors (GABAARs), induces membrane depolarization and facilitates Ca2+ entry
  via VGCCs. (E) Upon serotonin (purple, co-secreted with insulin, which is marked
  as grey) binding, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 5A (5-HT5A receptor) signals via
  Gαi to inhibit AC, thus diminishing intracellular cAMP and inhibiting somatostatin
  secretion. (F) The downstream signaling of somatostatin (SST, red) activation of
  somatostatin receptor (SSTR) on β-cells involves activating the coupled Gαi protein
  leading to decreased cytoplasmic levels of cAMP; hyperpolarizing the membrane potential
  and inhibiting action potential firing via G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying
  K+ (GIRK) channels; inhibiting Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated P/Q-type Ca2+ channels.
