caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of ROS-dependent CO-mediated survival pathway in brain
  endothelial cells stimulated by TNF-α. TNF-α activates Nox4 resulting in ROS-mediated
  cell death by apoptosis. Simultaneously, TNF-α initiates ROS-mediated survival pathways
  that attenuate oxidative stress: 1) PKB/Akt signaling negatively regulates Nox4
  activity; 2) Nox4-derived ROS activate constitutive HO-2 and increase endogenous
  CO production, 3) CO inhibits Nox4 and reduces oxidative stress; 4) Akt, ERK1/2,
  and p38 MAPK linked to the Nox4 inhibition by CO. The key element of the ROS-dependent
  CO-mediated cytoprotection against TNF-α-induced apoptosis involves the CO inhibition
  of Nox4 that requires an Akt-dependent suppression of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK.'

  monoxide, promote survival of brain endothelial cells during TNF-α-induced apoptosis.
