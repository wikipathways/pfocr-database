caption: Proposed model of the involvement of Spry2 and Spry2 siRNA in TLR, IFNγ receptor,
  and growth factor signaling pathways for suppression of M1 polarization and enhancement
  of M2 polarization in macrophages. Upon Pg LPS and IFNγ binding to their respective
  receptors and activating the respective signal pathways, Spry2 becomes activated
  and interacts with various components of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Spry2 siRNA
  inhibits endogenous Spry2, thereby promoting growth factor‐induced Rac1 activation.
  Spry2 siRNA enhances the efferocytosis of apoptotic cells, leading to polarization
  into M2 macrophage activation. Pg LPS stimulation increases IκB degradation and
  NFκB p65 phosphorylation, and IFNγ stimulation promotes STAT1 phosphorylation. Stimulation
  with both IFNγ and LPS shifts macrophages toward the M1 phenotype by activating
  iNOS expression. PI3K and AKT activation by Spry2 siRNA interferes with IκB degradation
  and NFκB p65 phosphorylation, resulting in suppression of M1 polarization. Polarized
  M2 macrophages release various growth factors. See the Discussion for a more in‐depth
  explanation. MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response 88. ISRE, interferon‐stimulated
  response element.
