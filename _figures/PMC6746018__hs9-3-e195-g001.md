caption: The PI3K/Ras signaling pathway. This illustration of the Ras signaling pathway
  highlights proteins affected by mutations in KMT2A-rearranged leukemia (pink). Growth
  factor (GF) binding to cell surface receptors results in activated tyrosine kinase
  receptor (TRK) complexes, which contain adaptors such as GRB2 (GF receptor bound
  protein 2) and Gab (GRB2-associated binding) proteins. Upon binding of a GF, such
  as G-CSF, to a receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the RTK is autophosphorylated.
  This creates docking sites for adaptor molecules (eg, GRB2) and for the phosphatase
  SHP2. These molecules recruit and activate guanosin exchange factors (eg, SOS1)
  that catalyzes the GDP/GTP exchange on RAS. The GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin
  (NF1) binds to Ras-GTP and accelerates the conversion of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP which
  terminates signaling. RAS-GTP activates several pathways and some are described
  here. The BRAF–mitogen-activated and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)–extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade primarily determines proliferation via activation
  of expression of genes important for cell cycle entry. RAF phosphorylates MEK1 and/or
  MEK2, which in turn activates ERK1 and/or ERK2. Activation of ERKs prompts a cascade
  of events that culminate in the activation of transcriptional regulators such as
  MYC, ELK1, FOS, ETS and expression of proteins regulating the cell cycle entry such
  as cyclin D1. This pathway also regulates the transcriptional activity of CREB/HOX/MEIS
  complex, which specifically regulates the proliferation and survival of KMT2A-leukemic
  cells via HOXA9 activity. Ras also activates the PI3K–3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase 1 (PDK1)–Akt pathway that frequently determines cellular survival
  via inhibition of apoptosis. Active RAS is also able to activate PI3K/Akt pathway
  by a direct interaction with the PI3K p110 catalytic subunit. This leads to activation
  of downstream kinases such as PDK1 and AKT. AKT is a Ser/Thr kinase that promotes
  survival by phosphorylating, and therefore inactivating, several proapoptotic proteins
  such as BAD and BAX and regulators of cell cycle such as p27 and p21 and also regulates
  the activity of GSK3. PI3K = phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
