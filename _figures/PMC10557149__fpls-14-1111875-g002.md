caption: 'Simplified illustration of the starch biosynthesis pathways in cereal endosperm
  (A) and photosynthetic leaf (B) cells, with key enzymes that can be targeted for
  manipulation shown in blue. (A). The cytosolic and amyloplastic compartments are
  demarcated by the light gray longitudinal dashed line. Sucrose is converted into
  starch (mainly amylose and amylopectin) through a series of enzymatic steps, involving
  glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), glucose 1-phosphate (G1P) and adenosine diphosphate glucose
  (ADP-Glucose). The enzymes are abbreviated as follows: SuSy, sucrose synthase; UGPase,
  UDPglucose pyrophosphorylase; FK, fructokinase; PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase; PGM,
  phosphoglucomutase; AGPase, ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase; SS, starch synthase; SBE,
  starch-branching enzyme. The red pods identified in red font denote sucrose transporters
  as follows: GIF1, GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1; GPT, glucose 6-phosphate transporter;
  and BT1, BRITTLE1 (an ADPglucose/ADP antiporter transporter). The dotted arrows
  signify a series of steps of the fructose-mediated pathway. Adopted from (Comparot-Moss
  and Denyer, 2009; MacNeill et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2021). (B). Sucrose is converted
  into starch through a series of enzymatic steps, involving Uridine diphosphate glucose
  (UDP glucose), G1P, G6P, and ADP-Glucose. Meanwhile, G6P in the chloroplast can
  also be converted into fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). Triose-phosphate (Triose-P) generated
  from the Calvin cycle is converted through a series of events into sucrose and stored
  in sinks. Other enzymes GWD, glucan water dikinase; PWD, phosphoglucan water dikinase;
  ISA1/2, isoamylase 1/2; GBSS1, granule-bound starch synthase 1; ALD, aldolase; FBPase,
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Adopted from (Comparot-Moss and Denyer, 2009; Geigenberger,
  2011; Hasan et al., 2023).'
