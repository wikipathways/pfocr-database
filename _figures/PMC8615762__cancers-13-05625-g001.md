caption: Chemokine networks in cutaneous melanoma. Immune cells are recruited via
  the networks outlined on the left of the figure. Chemokines enable an immunosuppressive
  microenvironment (TME) to be created via the preferential recruitment of immunosuppressive
  cells such as MDSCs, TAMs, and T-regs, which reduce the T-cell effector function
  and enhance the further recruitment and expansion of immunosuppressive cells. Cancer
  growth, invasion, and angiogenesis are promoted by the factors secreted by cells
  recruited to the TME via chemokines such as neutrophils and TAMs, as well as directly
  via CXCL8; lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis are enabled through CXCL5/CXCR1-2
  signalling, and cancer cells are able to migrate to lymph nodes using the CCL21/CCR7
  pathway. EMT-like processes are enabled through CCL5 and CXCL5 signalling through
  their respective receptors. Transendothelial migration is promoted via the CXCL9-10/CXCR3
  pathways, and cancer cells are able to move to specific sites using chemokine networks,
  e.g., CCL25/CCR9 to the gut, CCL22/CCR4 to the brain, and CXCL12 CXCR4 to the liver
  and lungs.
