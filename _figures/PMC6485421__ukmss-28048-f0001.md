caption: Various factors have been suggested to activate the pro-tumor phenotype of
  TAM; extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as hyaluronan (HA) and versican,
  pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNFα, and tumor hypoxia activates both HIF-1
  and NF-κB. Collectively these signaling pathways favor the transcription of genes
  promoting angiogenesis, malignant cell survival, invasion and metastasis. Engagement
  of TLRs or the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) triggers expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and anti-apoptotic genes through the adaptor protein MyD88 and classical NF-κB activation.
  TLR/IL-1R signaling also triggers MAPK and AP-1 activation, co-regulating the expression
  of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes. TLR4 also triggers a MyD88-independent
  pathway, through the adaptor molecule TRIF, to induce the phosphorylation of TBK
  and the downstream activation of IRF3, which regulates the transcription of type
  I interferons (IFN). M1 macrophages are characterized by IFN-mediated expression
  of STAT1/2-dependent genes including NOS2, IL-12 and MHC II. Whereas, the M2 phenotype
  is associated with IL-10, IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through STAT3 and STAT6. There
  are several levels of cross-talk between these pathways that regulate macrophage
  activation; over-expression of p50 negatively regulates NF-κB dependent pro-inflammatory
  gene transcription, STAT3/6 antagonize STAT1 activation, and NF-κB was also recently
  shown to inhibit STAT1 activity.
