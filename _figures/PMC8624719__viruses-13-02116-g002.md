caption: NF-κB signaling in response to mosquito-borne flavivirus infection and its
  antagonism in mosquitoes. The Toll pathway is activated when the ligand spätzle
  binds Toll receptors, which recruits MyD88, Tube, and Pelle, resulting in proteasomal
  degradation of the negative regulator Cactus; therefore, leading to the nuclear
  translocation of Rel1A and its co-activator Rel1B [,]. The IMD pathway is activated
  through peptidoglycan receptors (PGRP-LC), which promotes the recruitment of adaptor
  molecules such as IMD and Fas-associated death domain (FADD) proteins which, in
  turn, leads to the activation of the caspase Dredd []. Then, the NF-κB family transcription
  factor Rel2 is cleaved by Dredd []. IMD is cleaved by caspases which allow IMD to
  bind the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP2), activating the IKK complex, allowing the
  nuclear translocation of the N-terminal domain of Rel2 []. Caspar is the negative
  regulator of Rel2 []. Rel1A and Rel2, homologs of Drosophila Dorsal and Relish respectively
  [], induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides and other immune-regulated genes
  [,]. How the Toll and IMD pathways detect viral infection is not yet known. Although
  a cGAS-like receptor (cGLR)-STING signaling pathway has recently been characterized
  in D. melanogaster [,,,], this pathway appears to be absent from mosquitoes [].
  sfRNA of DENV, in purple, is able to antagonize the Toll pathway. See main text
  for details.
