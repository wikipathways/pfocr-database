caption: (A) Atherogenesis is influenced by the LT-pathway. T cells expressing LTα1β2
  induce the expression of CXCL13 and CCL21 from medial smooth muscle cells in the
  initial phases of atherogenesis. As a result, tertiary lymphoid structure formation,
  which is characteristic of atherosclerotic plaques can occur through the LT-mediated
  cellular recruitment (B) Hepatic lipid homeostasis can be regulated by the LT-pathway.
  T-cells transgenically expressing LIGHT, a ligand for LTβR, down regulate hepatic
  lipase production and contribute to hyperlipidemia. (C) Weight gain and glucose
  intolerance are influenced by the LT-pathway. HFD induces agonism of the LT pathway
  (VU and YXF unpublished data). RORγt+ cells expressing LT induce production of IL-23.
  The IL-23 and IL-22 pathway results in antimicrobial peptide production, which changes
  the composition of the microbiome and contributes to host weight gain.
