caption: (a) The generic biosynthesis pathway of RiPPs. RiPP precursor peptides contain
  a leader peptide and a core peptide. After post-translational modifications in the
  core peptide, the leader peptide is cleaved. (b) The lactazole biosynthetic gene
  cluster contains six proteins. LazA is the precursor peptide. LazB (tRNA-dependent
  glutamylation enzyme) and the eliminase domain of LazF form a serine dehydratase
  while LazD (RRE-containing E1-like protein),16 LazE (YcaO cyclodehydratase),17 and
  the dehydrogenase domain of LazF comprise a thiazole synthetase. LazC is a pyridine
  synthase. (c) Serine dehydration catalyzed by LazBF. (d) Thiazole formation catalyzed
  by LazDEF
