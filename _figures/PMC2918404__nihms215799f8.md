caption: The model depicts several well-known aspects of the FGF signaling cascade
  including the synergy between FGF signaling and proteoglycans, as well as downstream
  effects on FGF signaling on MAPK and CDK related pathways. We propose that Runx2
  may participate in two distinct feed-back loops. In actively dividing cells, FGF2
  is mitogenic and activates MAPKs and CDKs. This activation may both promote and
  attenuate Runx2 activity to generate short-term changes in proteoglycan expression
  that transiently modulate responsiveness to FGF2. In post-proliferative cells, FGF2
  functions anabolically and CDK effects on Runx2 are blocked by CDK inhibitors (CKIs).
  Consequently, the FGF/MAPK/Runx2 pathway may generate a long-term sustained response
  in which Runx2 modulates a program of proteoglycan expression to promote osteoblast
  maturation. The ideas presented in the model are consistent with references presented
  in the main text, but remain to be experimentally tested.
