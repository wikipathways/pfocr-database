caption: The B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway and molecular interactions in
  the CLL microenvironment. Upon engagement with antigen (and independent of antigen
  in some cases), the BCR activates LYN and SYK kinases, which stimulate several downstream
  mediators. BTK activation leads to a variety of downstream effects that eventually
  regulate key transcription factors for B cell survival and proliferation. PI3K stimulation
  leads to activation of mTOR and AKT. mTOR promotes cell cycle progression from G1
  to S and activates important pro-survival transcription factors. AKT has an anti-apoptotic
  effect, the mechanism of which remains incompletely defined. The microenvironment
  promotes CLL survival in a variety of complex ways. CLL cells can produce chemokines
  such as CCL3 and CCL4, which recruit immune cells such as T cells, which exert pro-survival
  signals through CD40/CD40L interactions. Nurse-like cells (NLC) have anti-apoptotic
  effects on the CLL cell through a variety of mediators, including APRIL, BAFF, and
  CD31, the latter of which interacts with CD38 and ZAP-70 to drive CLL cell proliferation.
  Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) contribute to CLL survival both through direct
  cell-cell contact and by producing soluble factors. Ligands such as VCAM-1 and fibronectin
  (FN) on the BMSC cell surface interact directly with integrins such as CD49d (VLA-4)
  on the CLL cell. BMSCs also produce chemokines such as CXCL12, which recruit CLL
  cells into the microenvironment through interactions with receptors on the CLL cell
  such as CXCR4.
