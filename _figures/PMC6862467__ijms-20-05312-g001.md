caption: The importance of mitochondrial dysfunction, α-syn aggregation, and the autophagy-endo-lysosomal
  system dysregulation in PD (Parkinson’s disease) pathogenesis. The clearance of
  damaged mitochondria and denatured α-synuclein (α-syn) are through autophagy-lysosome
  pathways. Minor mitochondrial damage is fixed via dynamic fission and fusion, complementing
  the damaged organelles and mitochondrial proteins. Medium amounts of damaged mitochondrial
  proteins and mitochondria parts are delivered to the lysosome via mitochondrial-derived
  vesicles (MDVs). The whole mitochondrion is trafficked to the lysosome for degradation
  via the mitophagy process (this figure depicts the most well-known PINK1/parkin
  dependent mitophagy pathway). Mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation leads
  to PINK1 kinase stabilization on the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) and recruits
  cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase, parkin, to the mitochondria. Parkin subsequently
  ubiquitinates mitochondrial OM proteins, tagging them for autophagy receptors (such
  as p62) recognition. These autophagy receptors bind with LC3-II-positive phagophores
  and the double-membraned structure closes up around the mitochondrion to form autophagosomes.
  Autophagosomes eventually fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes where damaged
  mitochondrion is degraded. Upon initiation of the PINK1/parkin dependent pathway,
  the dynamic fusion and motility of the damaged mitochondrion is disabled by targeting
  Mitofusin (Mfn) and Miro for ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. Native α-syn monomers
  are able to transition into toxic beta-sheet containing oligomers, which further
  converts into insoluble amyloid fibrils and are eventually deposited into Lewy bodies.
  α-syn monomers are degraded via the chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA) under physiological
  conditions. In this process, the heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hsc70) chaperone
  recognizes the KFERQ domain of α-syn and targets the protein for the lysosome. At
  the lysosome membrane, the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP2A)
  receptor assists in α-syn docking and internalization into the lysosome, where α-syn
  is degraded by hydrolases. Toxic α-syn oligomers and non-toxic monomers can both
  be degraded via the macroautophagy process.
