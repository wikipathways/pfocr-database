caption: Leptin signaling pathways. Leptin binding to LepRb activates JAK2, thus leading
  to phosphorylation of LepRb on Tyr985, Tyr1077 and Tyr1138. Phospho-Tyr985, -Tyr1077
  and-Tyr1138 bind to downstream molecules and activate the JAK2/STAT3, JAK2/STAT5,
  PI3K/IRS/AKT, and SHP2/MAPK pathways. Phosphorylated STAT3 dimers translocate to
  the nucleus and induce the transcription of target genes (POMC, SOCS3). SOCS3 inhibits
  the JAK2/STAT3 pathway by interacting with phospho-Y985 or JAK2 and acting as a
  feedback inhibitor of leptin signaling. PTP1B also inhibits leptin signaling through
  dephosphorylation of JAK2. After JAK2 activation, SHP2 binds to phosphor -Y985 in
  the LepRb and recruits the adaptor protein Grb2, causing activation of the ERK signaling
  cascade. Leptin also regulates PI3K signaling through IRS phosphorylation. Leptin
  has also been shown to stimulate the POMC neurons, while inhibit NPY/AGRP. FoxO1
  is an important downstream target of PI3K in the leptin signaling pathway. These
  pathways act coordinately to regulate food intake, energy balance and body weight
