caption: '(A) Signal transduction pathway from integrin receptors to actin cytoskeleton
  built from individual proteins (red shapes) using relationships found in ResNet
  6 database. Entrez official gene symbols are used for protein names. (B) Example
  of how a relation between two groups (functional classes) is formed in the Atlas
  of Signaling. (C) Same pathway as in (A) built with ontological groups: functional
  classes (orange hexagons) and cell process “actin-based cytoskeleton assembly” (yellow
  rectangle). The description of relationships between entities on the pathways is
  provided in the legend to .'
