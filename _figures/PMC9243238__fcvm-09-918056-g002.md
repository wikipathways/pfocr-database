caption: Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) promotes vascular calcification (VC) by
  inducing the osteogenic differentiation, autophagy, and apoptosis of vascular smooth
  muscle cells (VSMCs). In response to ERS, VSMCs differentiate into calcifying VSMCs
  via multiple mechanisms, including osteogenic differentiation, apoptosis, and autophagy.
  Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) can promote osteoblastic differentiation via
  nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), the IRE1α-XBP1 axis, and RUNX2 signaling pathways
  and aggravate apoptosis by the IRE1α-ASK-JNK and caspase-12 pathways. PKR-like ER
  kinase (PERK) induces apoptosis via the PERK-eIF2α-CHOP signaling pathway and osteogenic
  differentiation via ATF4 activation. Extracellular vesicles, induced by increased
  expression of Grp78 and ATF4, attract inflammatory cells and induce VC. Figures
  were created using BioRender.com.
