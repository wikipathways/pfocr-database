caption: General model for the RsmA-mediated global regulation in P. aeruginosa. P.
  aeruginosa RsmA is a part of the LadS/RetS/GacS/A/RsmY/Z/RsmA regulatory pathway
  in which LadS, RetS, and GacS/A modulate RsmA activity by regulating transcription
  of two small regulatory RNAs, RsmY and RsmZ. RsmY and RsmZ antagonize RsmA activity
  by competing with target mRNAs for RsmA binding. RsmA controls expression of more
  than 500 genes. Transcript levels of about two thirds these genes increase in the
  rsmA mutant or when RsmA is antagonized by RsmY and RsmZ. We propose that many of
  these genes are regulated by RsmA directly. On the other hand, we propose that the
  genes that are downregulated in the rsmA mutant or in the presence of high levels
  of RsmY and RsmZ are controlled by RsmA via indirect mechanisms. We propose that
  these mechanisms are specific to individual groups of genes and involve regulatory
  factors that are regulated by RsmA directly. Dashed lines – indirect regulation;
  Solid lines – direct regulation; white background – directly regulated genes; grey
  background – indirectly regulated genes.
