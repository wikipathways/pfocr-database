caption: The role of Nrf2/ARE pathway in antioxidant response and its regulatory mechanism.
  In unstressed condition, Nrf2 synthesized in the cell is primarily bound to a complex
  with Keap1 and degraded by the 26S proteasomes. After oxidative or electrophilic
  stress, Keap1 molecules become saturated with Nrf2, and the number of newly synthesized,
  free Nrf2 is increased and promotes its translocation to the nucleus. In the nucleus,
  binding of Nrf2 to the ARE is facilitated and transcription of a wide variety of
  downstream are stimulated, which play an important role in cytoprotection and metabolism.
