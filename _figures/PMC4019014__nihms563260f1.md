caption: 'Diagram of the sphingolipid metabolism. The de novo synthesis pathway starts
  at the endoplasmic reticulum by the condensation of palmitate and serine to produce
  3-ketosphinganine, which is then reduced to sphinganine, and converted to DhCER
  by the addition of a fatty acid. CER is the core molecule of SPL metabolism and
  is formed by the desaturation of DhCER. CER is the precursor of SPH, C1P, and a
  collection of complex SPLs: SM, GlcCer, GalCer and its derivatives. The SPL groups
  analyzed and quantified in this work are depicted in blue. (For interpretation of
