caption: Lipid metabolism enzymes and P2X7R modulation. a Backbone of a glycerol phospholipid,
  indicating the biochemical site of cleavage by each phospholipase enzyme and the
  resulting products. b Backbone of sphingomyelin, indicating the biochemical site
  of cleavage of neutral sphingomyelinase to generate the product ceramide. The site
  phosphorylated by ceramide kinase is also indicated. c Representation of P2X7R activation
  by endogenous ATP or specific purinergic agonists, triggering different lipid enzyme
  pathways in several cell types. The response specificity of each lipid pathway depends
  on cell type, and the details of these pathway steps are unclear
