caption: Schematic illustration of the used inhibitors and the signal transduction
  pathways involved in BDNF and C3 effects on SGN. The neurotrophin brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF) binds to its high-affinity receptor TrkB and its low-affinity
  receptor p75NTR. The main interactions of BDNF are depicted in blue and mediate
  neurite outgrowth and survival. Binding to p75NTR leads to the activation of the
  JAK/STAT pathway and also of RhoA inducing apoptosis and growth inhibition. C3 inhibits
  the activity of RhoA which results in the inactivation of the ROCK signaling pathway
  and diminishes growth inhibition. Rac1 activates the PI3K to activate Akt and thereby
  enhances neuronal survival. The used inhibitors of this study are depicted in red.
  Inhibition of Rac1 by NSC23766 and p38 by SB203580 leads to no outgrown neurites
  in SGN. Wortmannin (inhibition of PI3K) seems also to reduce the survival rate of
  SGN after combined treatment with C3 and BDNF.
