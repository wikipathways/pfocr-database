caption: Overview of B cell-targeted antigen delivery strategies. (A) Albumin-binding
  amph-vaccine accumulates in dLN by albumin hitchhiking. (B) Intranasally delivered
  amph-vaccines are transported to the nasal associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) through
  a mucosal epithelial layer mediated by neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). (C) Highly glycosylated
  self-assembled HIV nanoparticle antigens activate the mannose-binding lectin (MBL)
  complement pathway and are acquired by SSM cells from the subcapsular sinus (SCS)
  for antigen delivery to the B cell follicles. (D) Two-stage nanoparticles accumulate
  at the SCS (left), and release small-molecule drug to the B cell follicle as the
  linkers degrade at predetermined kinetics (right). (E) When antigens are administered
  with CL-lipo or SMNP(left), the SSM barrier cells are depleted and antigens are
  accumulated in the B cell follicles (right).
