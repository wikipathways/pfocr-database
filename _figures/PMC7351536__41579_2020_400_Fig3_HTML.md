caption: a | Infection with Borrelia burgdorferi activates the immune deficiency (IMD)
  pathway in Ixodes scapularis. On activation, p47 is polyubiquitylated by X-linked
  inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) in complex with the Bendless–Uev1a heterodimer. Downstream
  signalling through Kenny results in phosphorylation of Relish and transcription
  of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). b | Uninfected I. scapularis can ingest mouse
  interferon-γ (IFNγ) along with the bloodmeal when feeding on B. burgdorferi infected
  mice. Mouse IFNγ signals in the tick gut through an unknown receptor, resulting
  in STAT-mediated activation of a Rho-like GTPase (IGTPase) and production of the
  AMP Dae2. c | Certain microbiota compositions enable activation of the JAK–STAT
  pathway by an unknown molecular signal and in turn induce the expression of peritrophin
  genes. Peritrophins are crucial for the formation of a structurally intact peritrophic
  matrix. B. burgdorferi uses the peritrophic matrix as a shield or barrier protecting
  it from toxic contents during colonization of the gut epithelium. STAT-induced immune
  effectors, as well as environmental changes, can alter the microbiota composition.
  Certain changes in the microbiota composition impair JAK–STAT signalling, and this
  results in decreased expression of peritrophins, leading to a thinner and compromised
  peritrophic matrix. A compromised peritrophic matrix no longer functions as a protective
  shield and thus impairs B. burgdorferi colonization of the gut epithelium.
