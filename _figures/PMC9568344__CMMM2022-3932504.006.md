caption: Summary of the cellular response and potential molecular mechanism of stretching
  training treatment on AS model. Stretching training treatment improved the viability
  of synovial cells in vitro and downregulated the expression of target genes in the
  Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, inhibited inflammation and cell apoptosis, and
  relieved pathological damages in bone tissue in DBA/1 mice of AS.
