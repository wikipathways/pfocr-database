caption: Oncogenic function of Orai1 and STIM1. Intracellular Ca2+ signals are in
  the forms of spike, wave or oscillation, which require G-protein coupled receptor-PLC-IP3R
  pathway and Orai1/STIM1-mediated SOCE. Orai complex is composed of six subunits,
  coupling with STIM1 with 2:1 ratio for optimal channel regulation and activation.
  In cancer cells, elevated expression of Orai1 (Orai3) is not always accompanied
  by upregulation of STIM1, which raises the question whether Orai1 (Orai3) channel
  is activated without coupling with STIM1. Nevertheless, the overall increased SOCE
  result in hyperactivity of intracellular Ca2+ signals, which in turn stimulate cell
  proliferation, migration/invasion and develop apoptotic resistance in cancer cells.
