caption: 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biosynthesis proceeds from guanosine triphosphate
  (GTP) via 7,8-dyhydroneopterin triphosphate and 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin.
  The first and rate-limiting step in the pathway is GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH).
  The following steps are catalyzed by the enzymes 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase
  (PTPS) and sepiapterin reductase (SR). An alternative pathway for BH4 synthesis
  has been documented by which 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin is converted
  into sepiapterin by an enzyme termed “sepiapterin synthase”. Exogenous sepiapterin
  can be reduced in all cells by SR to BH2, and further by dihydrofolate reductase
  (DHFR) to form BH4, the so-called “salvage pathway.” The principle oxidant species
  leading to BH4 oxidation to BH2 is peroxynitrite. As a cofactor for the aromatic
  amino acid hydroxylases (AAAH) in the liver and neurons, but not as a cofactor for
  NOS, BH4 is converted into tetrahydrobiopterin-4a-carbinolamine, which is recycled
  to BH4 by the actions of pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) and DHPR. To
