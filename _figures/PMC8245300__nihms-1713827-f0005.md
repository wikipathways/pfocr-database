caption: Aa ∣ α-Thalassaemia mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) is recruited
  to heterochromatin regions marked by H3K9me3, where it deposits H3.3 (together with
  death domain-associated protein (DAXX))and contributes to chromatin compaction by
  binding to heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α), promoting its stabilization on chromatin.
  Ab ∣ ATRX has also DAXX-independent function, whereby it antagonizes deposition
  of macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2. Ac ∣ These activities are particularly important
  at telomeres, where ATRX functions to resolve G-quadruplex (G4) DNA during replication
  and is also important for the maintenance of telomeric heterochromatin (maintenance
  of high levels of H3K9me3). Ba ∣ ATRX is commonly mutated in cancers that activate
  a telomerase-independent mechanism of telomere maintenance via the alternative lengthening
  of telomeres (ALT) pathway. ATRX mutations in cancer are both missense and truncation
  mutations and are observed along the length of the gene,. These mutations in ATRX
  can cause loss of function of the protein and lead to the loss of telomeric heterochromatin,
  replication stress caused by G4 stabilization (see parts Aa and Ac) and subsequent
  DNA damage at telomeres as well as increased homologous recombination-dependent
  telomere sister chromatid exchange (T-SCE) downstream of macroH2A1 accumulation
  (see part Ab). Bb ∣ Large deletions of ATRX around the coding region are associated
  with in-frame fusion of the protein, which leads to the generation of truncated
  protein products that are redistributed to sites of active transcription — marked
  by H3K27ac — and display neomorphic function in activating gene expression. One
  of the targets of in-frame fusion ATRX is the transcription repressor REST, which
  on activation leads to repression of genes involved in neuronal differentiation,
  concomitant activation of neurogenesis programmes and increased cell proliferation.
  This function was found to be DAXX independent. C ∣ ATRX mutations associated with
  α-thalassaemia X-linked mental retardation syndrome are generally missense mutations
  affecting key functional regions of the protein. α-Thalassaemia X-linked mental
  retardation syndrome-related loss of ATRX activity was linked to increased deposition
  of macroH2A1 variants (see part Ab) at the α-globin locus, leading to heterochromatinization
  and silencing of the gene, thereby driving α-thalassaemia pathology. ATRX loss in
  the brain is linked to increased replicative damage and subsequent cell death, which
  was attributed to the role of ATRX in supporting replication through G4 (see part
  Ac). Of note, whether replication stress associated with α-thalassaemia X-linked
  mental retardation syndrome-causing mutations relies on aberrant H3.3 deposition
  is not clear. RNAPII RNA polymerase II.
