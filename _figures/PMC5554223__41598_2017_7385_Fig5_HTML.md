caption: Model for the alternative routes of pyruvate metabolism in Carassius. Model
  for pyruvate handling in Carassius non-ethanol producing tissues (left), contrasted
  with pyruvate handling in ethanol producing tissues (right). Combined areas of similarly
  colored circles correspond to mRNA levels in brain (left) and red skeletal muscle
  (right) from crucian carp. In case of dimers, total transcript levels were halved,
  and represented as dimers in the figure, together representing the total transcript
  level of the corresponding gene. Bubble size is scaled according to mRNA transcript
  level. In non-ethanol producing tissues, pyruvate from glycolysis is either converted
  to acetyl-CoA and CO2 (with oxygen) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc)
  or to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; without oxygen), as evident from the
  lack of expressed PDC components. In ethanol producing tissues, pyruvate from glycolysis
  is either processed to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by PDHc for further metabolism in the
  TCA cycle when oxygen is present, or converted into ethanol through the PDC-ADH
  pathway during anoxia.
