caption: Schematic representation of sucrose roles along the hypothetical evolutionary
  pathway of cyanobacteria. The phylogenetic relationships among species are depicted
  according to rDNA 16S sequence analysis. Sucrose metabolism is likely to be originated
  in freshwater habitat and multiple sucrose synthesis genes might have been present
  in a cyanobacterial ancestor []. Sucrose synthesis is found in G. violaceus that
  has ancestral characteristics and diverged early within the radiation of cyanobacteria.
  A fusion of primordial GTD and PHD might have given rise to a hypothetical common-ancestral
  SPS (GTD-PHD) gene, which is found mostly in the marine Prochlorococcus/Synechococcus
  clade. Sucrose has been identified as a primary compatible solute in Prochlorococcus,
  and as secondary osmolyte in Synechococcus strains and in Synechocystis sp. PCC
  6803 []. The involvement of sucrose in glycogen and polysaccharides production seems
  to be due to the emergence of SuS (dotted line), crucial in filamentous heterocyst-forming
  strains [,], as well as in strains (such as G. violaceus, Thermosynechococcus elongatus
  and Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806), where SuS are likely to be acquired by lateral
  gene transfer (dashed lines). In heterocystic strains, sucrose is a key molecule
  during nitrogen fixation and it was proposed as a carrier molecule to transport
  carbon along the filament. It is also involved in glycogen synthesis and in other
  polysaccharide accumulation. Plant sucrose metabolism has been acquired during the
  endosymbiotic origin of the chloroplast at the time of the cyanobacterial phylogenetic
  radiation.
