caption: A schematic diagram of artemether confers neuroprotection on cerebral ischemic
  injury. Artemether stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in PC12 cells, primary cultured
  cortical neurons and MCAO mouse model, which results in activation of CREB/Bcl-2
  pathway and inhibition of apoptosis pathway. All these findings indicate the potential
  application of artemether in the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke.
