caption: Schematic representation of the model for stasis-induced, developmental,
  induction of the heat shock regulon. The model is very much the same as the proposed
  signal-response transduction pathway for heat shock induction presented by  with
  the addition of DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE, as negative modulators of the response (for
  review, see ; ). Central to this model is that the heat shock proteins DnaJ, DnaK,
  and GrpE, have dual functions; one is to aid refolding of denatured or misfolded
  proteins and the other is to promote proteolytic degradation of the heat shock regulator
  σ32. An increase in the cellular level of denatured proteins as a consequence of
  heat or ethanol treatment will sequester the DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE components (provided
  at least one of them is limiting) through binding to their denatured substrate.
  This will allow stabilization of σ32, which will trigger increased transcription
  of the heat shock genes (e.g., ). During stasis, we propose that oxidative damage
  of target proteins will similarly sequester these heat shock modulators allowing
  induction of the regulon. This notion is supported by the fact that heat shock induction
  is markedly suppressed by overproducing SodA during stasis. In addition, the fact
  that DnaK appears to be specifically sensitive to oxidative carbonylation opens
  up the possibility that oxidative damage of DnaK itself may be involved in stasis-induced
  heat shock gene expression. Presumably, oxidation of DnaK will destroy or reduce
  its ability to participate in the degradation of σ32 which, in turn, will activate
  heat shock promoters.
