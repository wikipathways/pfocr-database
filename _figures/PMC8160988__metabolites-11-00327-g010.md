caption: Curated metabolic pathway of key metabolism changes in a SARS-CoV-2 ferret
  model infected with the SA01 isolate during virus shedding. Note, red-colored metabolites
  are significant features that are upregulated during viral shedding when infected
  with SA01 isolate. Key metabolic pathways identified from the pathway enrichment
  and impact analysis are annotated green. The data for individual metabolites is
  presented in the .
