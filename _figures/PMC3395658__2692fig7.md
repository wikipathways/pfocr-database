caption: Models of CO2 mediated morphogenesis in C. albicans. The unidentified pathway
  represents the major pathway involved in CO2-induced responses. The cAMP signaling
  and the unidentified pathway converge on the key regulator Flo8 in the regulation
  of white-to-opaque switching, whereas the two pathways converge on the Flo8–Efg1
  complex in the regulation of filamentous growth. HSG, hyphal-specific genes; OSG,
  opaque-specific genes. (A) A model of CO2-induced filamentation. (B) A model of
  CO2-induced white-to-opaque switching. Wor1 contains a conserved potential PKA phosphorylation
  site and has been proven to function downstream of the cAMP pathway.
