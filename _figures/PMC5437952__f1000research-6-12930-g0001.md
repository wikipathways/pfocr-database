caption: '( A) The endosomal TLR7 pathway in human blood-derived PDC promotes early
  glycolysis (within minutes following TLR7 triggering; green font and green arrows),
  as attested by increased ECAR (extracellular acidification rate; a reflection of
  lactate excretion). This implicates the HIF-1α molecule that increases the GLUT1
  glucose transporter expression allowing extracellular glucose entry. HIF-1α stimulates
  some enzymes involved in glycolysis (HK or PFK). Glycolysis in human PDC is required
  for TLR7-induced type I IFN production. A potential link with the activation of
  the mTORC1 complex (orange arrows) can be seen, since this complex is activated
  by the endosomal TLR7 pathway and induces HIF-1α in human PDC. Inhibitors of mTORC1
  (RAP.), of TLR7 signaling (chlor.), and of glycolysis (2-DG) are written in blue
  font. All these inhibitors block TLR7-induced type I IFN production. ( B) The TLR9
  pathway in mouse bone marrow-derived PDC promotes late glycolysis (after 24 hours)
  (grey font and grey arrows) via a type I IFN/IFNAR loop (violet arrows). Through
  this loop, the TLR9 pathway also promotes fatty acid synthesis, FAO coupled with
  OXPHOS to generate ATP in a PPARα-dependent mechanism (violet font and violet arrows).
  This TLR9 pathway implicates the activation of mTORC1 in mouse PDC (orange arrows,
  as depicted in ). Specific inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis (C75), pyruvate entry
  in the mitochondrion (UK5099), TCA cycle (TOFA) or FAO (etoxomir) are written in
  blue font and have been used to demonstrate the promotion of fatty acid synthesis,
  FAO and OXPHOS in TLR9-induced type I IFN production, respectively. For more details,
  please refer to the main text. Abbreviations (not defined in the main text): HK,
  hexokinase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; RAP., rapamycin; chlor., chloroquine.'
