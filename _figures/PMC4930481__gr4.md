caption: 'Isotopic Labeling Experiments Demonstrate the Biosynthesis of Sugars and
  Other Biomass Components from CO2(A) Isotopic labeling analysis, in which evolved
  clones were grown with isotopically labeled 13CO2 as an inorganic carbon source
  and non-labeled pyruvate as an energy source, showed almost full labeling of all
  CBB intermediates and the derived biomass building blocks. In marked contrast, TCA
  intermediates and biomass components originating from the energy module show low
  levels of labeling, as predicted for a hemiautotrophic growth mode. This indicates
  that the evolved strain synthesizes CBB module biomass precursors from CO2 using
  the non-native CBB cycle, while the biomass precursors originating from the energy
  module are synthesized from the supplemented pyruvate.(B) In a reciprocal setup
  in which non-labeled CO2 was supplied in addition to uniformly labeled pyruvate,
  the labeling pattern was again in agreement with hemiautotrophic growth expectations:
  CBB intermediates and the derived amino acids were mostly non-labeled (as the supplied
  CO2), while metabolites in the energy module were mostly labeled.(C) Metabolically
  unperturbed BW25113 E. coli in which RuBisCO and prk were not recombinantly expressed.
  As expected when lacking the gpm metabolic cutoff and RuBisCO, when uniformly labeled
  13C-pyruvate was supplied as a carbon source, the intermediates of glycolysis and
  the pentose-phosphate pathway were fully labeled. TCA cycle intermediates and the
  derived biomass components were not fully labeled due to the usage of non-labeled
  bicarbonate in anaplerotic reactions (denoted CO2 for simplicity). The mean percentage
  (±SD) of three replicates is shown.'
