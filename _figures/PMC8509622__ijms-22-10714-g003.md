caption: Anti-cardiac fibrosis mechanisms of EETs. EETs could diminish fibrosis associated
  with cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, as well as apoptosis and inflammation.
  EETs block the fibrotic response in Ang II-infusion hearts by inhibiting CaN/NFATC3
  signaling. The increase of EETs is shown to reduce cardiac fibroblast activation,
  proliferation, migration, and secretion capacity by inhibiting the Gα12/13/RhoA/ROCK
  pathway via NO/cGMP activation. Additionally, enhanced EET formation minimizes cardiomyocyte
  hypertrophy and remodeling, while limiting collagen accumulation through the inhibition
  of the oxidative-stress-mediated NF-κB pathway via PPAR-γ activation.
