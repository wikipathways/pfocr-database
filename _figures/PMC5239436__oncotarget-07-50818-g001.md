caption: 'The stages of autophagy are depicted in the middle; initiation, maturation
  (elongation), and degradation; with intersections of both the apoptotic and necroptotic
  pathways. On the left, binding of TRAIL to its receptor normally leads to formation
  of the DISC (Death-inducing Signaling Complex). However, loss of MAP3K7 (Mitogen-Activated
  Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase 7) leads to formation of the necrosome on the autophagosome
  and signals cell death through necroptosis. This is also accomplished if pan-caspase
  inhibitors z-VAD-fmk or QVD-OPH are applied. If the necrosome is prevented from
  forming, or signaling, apopotosis and downstream MOMP (Mitochondrial Outer Membrane
  Permeablization) can alternatively induce cell death. Numerous other known interactions
  with autophagy and apoptosis, on the right, are shown at each stage of the autophagy
  pathway. Protein abbreviations: TRADD (TNFRSF1A-Associated Via Death Domain), TRAF
  (TNF Receptor Associated Factors), p62/SQSTM1 (Sequestosome 1), Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma
  2), BAX (Bcl-2 Associated X protein), VPS34 (Vacuolar Protein Sorting 34), ATG (Autophagy-related
  protein), Beclin1 (human orthologue of yeast ATG6), IAP (Inhibitors of Apoptosis
  Proteins), and PUMA (p53 Upregulated Modulator of Apoptosis).'
