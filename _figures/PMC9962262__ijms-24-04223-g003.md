caption: 'Mammalian circadian clockwork model. Three transcription-translation feedback
  loops are known to operate in the mammalian circadian clock. In the first loop,
  the CLOCK: BMAL1 heterodimer activates the expression of target genes, including
  Per genes (Per1, Per2, and Per3) and Cry genes (Cry1 and Cry2) via binding to E-box
  (5′-CACGTG-3′) in their promoter regions, whereas the PER: CRY heterodimer interferes
  with the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and turns off their
  own expression. In the second loop, Rorα/β and Rev-erbα/β are regulated by CLOCK
  and BMAL1 via E-box, whereas their proteins RORα/β and REV-ERBα/β activate and suppress
  Bmal1 by competing for binding to the RORE (retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor
  response element). In the third loop, Dbp, Hlf, Tef, and E4bp4/Nfil3 are all regulated
  by CLOCK and BMAL1 via E-box, whereas their proteins DBP, HIF, TEF, and E4BP4/NFIL3
  bind to D-box in the promoter regions of their target genes, where DBP, HIF, and
  TEF activate D-box-containing genes and E4BP4/NFIL3 represses them. Among these
  three circadian clock-controlled cis-elements-mediated transcriptional feedback
  loops, the E/E’-box-mediated loop plays the dominant role in the circadian clock.
  In addition, the mTOR pathway has been shown to contribute to circadian regulation.
