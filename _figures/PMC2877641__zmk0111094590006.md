caption: Provisional schematic representation of pathways controlling cell death in
  Dictyostelium. The ACD phenotype is light blue boxed, pathways controlling this
  phenotype and the NCD phenotype are shown as black arrows, and inducers are in blue.
  In red, mutations and pathways whose positions have been clarified in this report.
  Both ACD and NCD required a first signal provided by starvation and cAMP (bottom),
  which was impaired by GbfA () or ugpB/glcS () mutations. Mutations of atg1 suppressed
  ACD (unpublished data) and led to the induction of NCD (; ; ). A second signal provided
  by exogenous DIF-1 led to either ACD or to NCD when atg1 was mutated. DIF-1 was
  recognized by distinct structures, designated here as S1 and S2, at the onset of
  either ACD or NCD (). More specifically, the control of ACD is detailed in the top
  of the figure. It included induction of paddle cells, spared by the iplA (), talB
  (), and DhlMins mutations, which impaired the rest of ACD. DhkM mutations affected
  the ACD control pathway at two distinct steps. At a location in the ACD pathway
  not easily separable so far from those of iplA and talinB, the DhkMins mutation
  inhibited the paddle-to-round transition normally leading to rounding and cellulose
  synthesis (itself under the control of the DcsA cellulose synthase; ; ). More downstream,
  the round-to-vacuolar transition normally led to vacuolization and cell death. The
  DhkMdel mutation inhibited vacuolization and morphological (defined by cell membrane
  rupture) but not clonogenic (defined by inability to regrow) cell death. Dotted
  red lines show primary or secondary pathways to clonogenic cell death. To facilitate
  graphic representation, the temporal sequence of ACD subcellular events and its
  control molecular sequence are shown here as colinear, but they need not be so.
  More specifically, the molecules involved in the ins and del mutations may be in
  spatial proximity.
