caption: Signaling pathway of HMGB1-mediated ischemia reperfusion injury. HMGB1 is
  an early mediator of injury and inflammation in liver, kidney, heart, and brain
  ischemia reperfusion injury and implicates TLR-4, TLR-9, and RAGE as receptors that
  are involved in the process. HMGB1's extracellular function partly through activation
  of MAPKs and NF-κB pathway. (For interpretation of the references to color in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article at www.liebertonline.com/ars).
