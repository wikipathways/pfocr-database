caption: Through the pentose phosphate pathway, glucose can indirectly produce NADPH,
  which confronts excessive intracellular ROS to maintain CSC in the quiescent state.
  Second, when nutrients in the TME are in short, nutrients excluding glucose are
  decomposed and go through OXPHOS to effectively produce ATP to sustain basic biological
  demand. Third, glutathione also can be synthesized from glutamine (an important
  and rich non-essential amino acid) and participate in the self-defense mechanism
  in response to excessive ROS and reduce its related adverse outcomes. Meanwhile,
  the intermediates in glycolysis, pyruvate, and lactate further can abnormally activate
  ALDH, initiating or strengthening CSC stemness.
