caption: Mechanism of action of FSH-FSHR in OC proliferation and EMT. Cyclin D1 expression
  is induced by gankyrin-mediated HIF-1α via a gankyrin-established PI3K/AKT signaling
  feedback loop (91). FSH stimulates the phosphorylation of both sphingosine kinase1
  and sphingosine kinase2 and thus regulates the survival and growth of OC cells by
  activating Sphk1 and Sphk2 through ERK1/2 (92). High levels of β-arrestin 2 are
  positively correlated with the expression of the gonadotropin receptors FSHR. β-arrestin
  2 expression significantly facilitates the proliferation of OC cells (93). FSH induces
  epithelial OC invasion via the regulation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, resulting
  in the upregulation of OCT4 expression and subsequently, EMT and invasion (94).
  FSH-induces EMT of epithelial OC cells through FSHR PI3K/Akt-Snail signaling pathway
  (95). FSH receptor binding inhibitor (FRBI), as an FSH antagonist, blocks FSH binding
  to FSHR8 and changes the role of FSH at the receptor level. FSH receptor binding
  inhibitor upregulates ARID1A and PTEN genes associated with OCs in mice (96). A
  high dose of FRBI reduces the production of c-Myc and K-Ras, which probably prevents
  or blocks tumorigenesis and progression of OC (10)
