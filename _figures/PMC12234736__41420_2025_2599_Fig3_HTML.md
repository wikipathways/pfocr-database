caption: 'Left panel: Physiologically, TRAF6 is dispersed in the cytoplasm and does
  not mediate inflammation by effectively activating the transcription of NF-κB signalling.
  Right panel: Upon the activation of LPS signalling, TRAF6 condenses through the
  mechanism of LLPS, a previously undefined phenomenon. In addition, Sufu, an important
  member of the Hh signalling pathway, negatively regulates TLR-related inflammatory
  damage by disrupting the LLPS and droplet formation of TRAF6 upon LPS signalling.
  TRAF6 autoubiquitination and oligomerization are required for TRAF6 LLPS'
