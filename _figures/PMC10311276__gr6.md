caption: Spastin regulates lysosomal degradation of intracellular Gag by specifically
  interacting with the ESCRT protein IST1. ① After the synthesis of HIV-1 Gag, part
  of the Gag protein is directly transported to the cell membrane for viral assembly,
  budding and release. ② The other part is transported to the late endosome/multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) (; ) and released by the viral exosomal pathway (; ; ; ). ③ If the
  late endosomes/MVBs fuse with lysosomes, the internal proteins will be degraded.
  By interacting with increased sodium tolerance 1 (IST1), spastin inhibited the entry
  of HIV-1 Gag into the lysosomal degradation pathway. ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  ESCRT, endosomal sorting complex required for transport.
