caption: Proposed model of LH-mediated regulation of MTOR signaling in luteal cells.
  The results described are consistent with the model in which LH activates the LH
  receptor and adenylyl cyclase, which leads to an increase in cAMP. As a result,
  there is an increase in the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3B. At the same
  time, there is a reduction in the activation of AMPK. These events reduce the activity
  of the TSC, allowing MTOR to phosphorylate components of the translational apparatus,
  S6K1 and 4EBP1. Treatment with rapamycin inhibits MTOR activation without altering
  progesterone secretion. Treatment with AICAR activates AMPK, inhibits MTOR phosphorylation
  of S6K1, and inhibits progesterone secretion. The results suggest that LH uses a
  unique pathway to activate MTOR signaling in bovine luteal cells, but the rapamycin-sensitive
  MTOR signaling pathway does not contribute to corpus luteum progesterone synthesis.
