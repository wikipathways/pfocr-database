caption: Representative apoptosis pathway and associated factors. The two pathways,
  namely intrinsic and extrinsic pathway, functions via mitochondria and death receptors,
  respectively, as shown here. In the extrinsic pathway, death ligands, such as Fas-L
  or TRAIL, bind to their specific receptors to initiate the formation of the DISC
  complex, resulting in activation of caspase-8 and subsequent activation of the effector
  caspases-3/6/7. In the extrinsic pathway, procaspase-9 binds to cytochrome c bound
  APAF-1, forming the apoptosome complex. The truncated and activated form of Bid
  is indicated as tBid here. Arrows indicate induction of apoptosis. Blunt arrows
  indicate inhibition of apoptosis. Dashed arrows are used to show cytochrome c release
  from mitochondria. Fas-L, CD95-ligand; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand; TRAIL-R, TRAIL receptors; FADD, Fas associated death
  domain; DISC, death inducing signaling complex; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma 2; BH, Bcl-2
  homology; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
