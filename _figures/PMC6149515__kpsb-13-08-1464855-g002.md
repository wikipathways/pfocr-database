caption: 'Scheme of defence responses activated by tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) in
  the presence of a complex native soil microbiota. (1) According to the models proposed
  by Chialva et al., in native soils microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs)
  such as flagellin (flg22) and chitin are perceived by tomato plant. Those events
  elicit the PTI pathway (Plant-triggered Immunity) as a first defence level with
  the activation of calcium signalling (CNGCs, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels; CaM/CaM-like
  (CML), calmodulin-like proteins; CDPKs, calcium-dependent protein kinases) and WRKY
  transcription factors. This brings to the downstream activation of pathogenesis-related
  proteins genes (PR), such as PR1, and to cell-wall fortification and lignin synthesis.
  (2) Since PTI-related defence is elicited, a “continuative priming” by soil microbiota
  components occurs, maintaining plant defence active. (3) When plant is attacked
  by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp lycopersici (FOL) the plant is already primed and activates
  stronger ETI (Effector-triggered Immunity) defence. In both genotypes, effectors
  are strongly perceived (e.g. by RIN4): only in the FOL-resistant one a specific
  resistance mediated by I-2 is activated leading to the activation of the downstream
  ETI responses (such as UDP upregulation). However, in the susceptible genotype even
  if I-2 upregulation was not observed, FOL-suppressive soil induced the activation
  of downstream ETI pathway with the upregulation of a marker UDP gene.'
