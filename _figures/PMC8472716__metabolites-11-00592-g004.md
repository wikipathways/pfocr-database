caption: Anti-inflammatory effect of um-PEA in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein challenged
  murine alveolar macrophages depends upon PPARα-mediated control of NF-κB and NLRP3
  inflammasome signaling pathways. Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-induced
  inflammasome activation and relative proposed anti-inflammatory mechanism of um-PEA
  in mice alveolar macrophages. Spike protein interacts at TLR4 and ACE-2 receptor
  sites, activating phosphorylation of p38MAPK and consequent NF-κB activation. This
  is accompanied by cytokine release (IL-6 and TNF-α) and inflammasome pathway activation,
  featured by NLRP3 and Caspase-1/IL-1β upregulation. Um-PEA acting at PPAR-α receptor
  site inhibits NF-κB transcription and NLRP-3 inflammasome signaling leading to a
  significant anti-inflammatory effect in spike protein-challenged alveolar macrophages.
