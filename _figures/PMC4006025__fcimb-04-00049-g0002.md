caption: 'Signals derived from non-intestinal epithelial tissues control intestinal
  homeostasis in Drosophila. (A) Physiological Homeostasis: Basal proliferation is
  controlled via the EGFR and the Wg pathways, whereas JAK/STAT controls differentiation.
  Vn secreted by the VM, as well as Krn and Spi coming from the EC and the EB, respectively,
  activate the EGFR pathway. Wg coming from the VM and the EB activates the Wg pathway.
  Dilp3 secreted from the VM and systemic Dilps activate InR signaling in response
  to nutrition. Dpp secreted by the VM and possibly by the ECs and the trachea activates
  the BMP pathway, which inhibits EGFR. Differentiation is regulated by JAK/STAT with
  the Upd cytokines coming mainly from the ECs. (B) Regenerative inflammatory signaling:
  Enteric infection and ingestion of chemicals induce intestinal damage that promotes
  regeneration via compensatory ISC proliferation. The EGFR, the Wg and the JAK/STAT
  pathways control ISC proliferation. JNK signaling is a stress sensor induced in
  the ECs. It activates EGFR signaling in ISCs and induces Wg in the EBs that activates
  Wg signaling in the ISCs. The EGFR ligands come from the VM (secreted Vn), the ECs
  (Krn) and the EBs (Spi). The JNK and JAK/STAT induce proliferation by activating
  EGFR signaling. Upd3 derived from damaged ECs induces the JAK/STAT pathway in the
  ISCs and the VM. In the VM, Vn is induced by JAK/STAT activity. BMP signaling is
  required for the shift from regeneration to basal maintenance; it inhibits EGFR
  signaling. The BMP ligand Dpp comes from the VM. Additionally, Dpp is expressed
  in the trachea but this source seems dispensable. Although the InR promotes proliferation,
  the source and identity of its ligands remain unclear. Signaling pathways are shown
  in bold and underlined. Abbreviations: EC, enterocyte; ISC, intestinal stem cell;
  EB, enteroblast; Vn, Vein; Spi, Spitz; Krn, Keren; Wg, Wingless.'
