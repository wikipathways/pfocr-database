caption: 'NaW does not directly activate IR, or other tyrosine kinase receptors, such
  as EGF or IGF receptors in hepatocytes. Rather, it activates Gαi2 and Gβγ subunits
  of GPCR, to stimulate the activity of the small GTPase Ras, initiating the signaling
  transduction through sequential phosphorylation of Raf-1, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, which
  in turn phosphorylates GSK3β and p90rsk. Phosphorylated GSK3β is inactive and alleviates
  the inhibitory phosphorylation over GS, favoring activation of glycogen synthesis.
  Although it has not been demonstrated for NaW action, p90rsk is known to be involved
  in GSK3β inactivation, PP1 activation and negative feedback upstream in the pathway
  through inactivation of SOS. PP1 is the main phosphatase activity participating
  in GS dephosphorylation and stimulation of glycogen synthesis, but the actual participation
  of NaW in PP1 activation remains to be established. In parallel, NaW-madiated ERK1/2
  activation stimulates c-fos and c-jun, and inhibits PGC-1 transcriptional expression
  through yet unknown mechanisms. Since PGC-1 is a positive modulator, whereas c-fos
  and c-jun are negative regulators of the transactivation of gluconeogenic genes,
  NaW action finally induces down-regulation of gluconeogenic enzymes and, hence,
  the gluconeogenic pathway. In IRS2 KO mice, NaW was unable to exert consistent effects
  on glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis, highlighting the importance of IRS2 in
  NaW signaling pathway in hepatocytes. White letter: proteins are modified after
  NaW treatment. Black letter: proteins involved in the normal pathway, which are
  expected to participate in NaW signaling, although it has not been determined; Yellow
  letter: evidence supports these proteins as potentially involved in NaW signalling;
  ?: regulatory mechanisms that have not been confirmed for NaW signalling; P: phosphorylation.'
