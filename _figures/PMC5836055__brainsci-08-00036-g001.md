caption: 'Effects of acute and repeated administration of propofol on the mesolimbic
  system. (A) Homeostatic state of body: The Ventral Tegmental Area-Nucleus Accumbens
  (VTA-NAc) circuit is a part of mesolimbic pathway and in homeostatic state of the
  body is involved in mediating individual’s responses to natural rewards like food,
  water, sex, and nurturing. This circuit comprises of dopamine neuron cell bodies
  in the Ventral Tegmantal Area (VTA) and their axons terminate in the Nucleus Accumbens
  (NAc) []. (B) Acute administration of propofol: Nanomolar (0.1–1 nM) concentrations
  of propofol enhanced VTA dopamine neuron activity by increasing the glutamatergic
  transmission to VTA dopamine neurons via presynaptic D1 dopamine receptors. This
  increased Dopaminergic (DA) neuron’s activity may cause increase dopamine levels
  in the NAc []. As such, acute intraperitoneal administration of sub-anesthetic and
  anesthetic doses of propofol resulted in increased dopamine levels in NAc []. Dopamine
  release in the NAc has been associated with motivation, reinforcement and reward
  processing [,]. (C) Repeated administration of propofol: Repeated intraperitoneal
  injection of propofol resulted in upregulation of dopamine receptor D1 and its downstream
  signaling molecules phosphorylated-EKR (p-ERK) and thereby the oncogene homolog
  B delta variant (ΔFosB) in the NAc [,]. The neuronal and synaptic plasticity in
  the VTA-NAc circuit, as seen with other drugs of abuse [,], may play a role in development
  of these changes. However, any experimental verification to support this theory
  remains to be elucidated. ΔFosB has been demonstrated to contribute to drug addiction
  by regulating expression of target genes in the reward pathway [,]. This evidence
  may hint towards a similar mechanism underlying propofol addiction and thus needs
  further research supporting this proposition.'
