caption: Proposed regulatory model for rhizomania development. In healthy Arabidopsis
  plants, auxin controls lateral root (LR) development through multiple auxin signalling
  modules. Two modules involved in LR development are shown in the left panel (modified
  from Lavenus et al.,  and Lee et al., ). LR founder cell priming involves the AtIAA28‐AtARF5,
  6, 7, 8, 19 module. LR emergence is controlled by the AtIAA14‐AtARF7, 19 module.
  AtLBD16, 18 regulate LR emergence downstream of AtARF7, 19. In sugar beet, following
  Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) infection, the P25 virulence factor is produced.
  P25 inactivates BvAUX28 transcriptional repressor leading to the derepression of
  BvARF7, 19 transcriptional activators. Subsequently, the expression of a number
  of their target genes is turned on, including BvLBD16 and BvLBD18 transcription
  factors (TFs) involved in LR formation. BvLBD16, 18 activate the expression of two
  EXLA1 genes to facilitate cell wall (CW) relaxation and remodelling during LR initiation
  and emergence. The up‐regulation of the positive regulators of LR formation, BvLBD16
  and BvLBD18, as well as EXPANSIN genes (EXPs), leads to the uncontrolled formation
  of LR, giving a ‘hairy root’ appearance of rhizomania‐afflicted sugar beet taproot.
  Meanwhile, another pathway is turned on leading to the activation of root hair (RH)‐specific
  EXPs, BvEXPA4L and BvEXPA7, to promote RH initiation and elongation. The formation
  of LRs and RHs is beneficial for the propagation of Polymyxa betae, the formation
  of zoospores and, ultimately, the efficient transmission of BNYVV. Auxin and P25
  are shown in blue. The proteins encoded by homologous genes in Arabidopsis and sugar
  beet are shown by similar colours.
