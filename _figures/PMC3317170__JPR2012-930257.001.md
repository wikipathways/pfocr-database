caption: Model for the activation of TLR2 by Leishmania sp., leading to a proinflammatory
  (left), or anti-inflammatory arm (centre and right). In early studies, L. major
  stimulated the transcription of IL1α through a MyD88-dependent pathway, but not
  the IL1α production at the protein level, suggesting the triggering of anti-inflammatory
  stimuli negatively controlling IL1-α production []. LPG or additional undefined
  TLR2 ligands promote the synthesis of cytokines, nitric oxide (NO), and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) that are related to parasite killing and to the development
  of a protective Th1 response, through MyD-88-dependent pathways [–]. L. major LPG
  also induces the production of suppressors of the cytokine signaling family proteins
  SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 [], whose activities are associated with diminished cytokine production
  and prevention of TLR4 signaling []. Lack of TLR2 increased the resistance to infections
  with L. braziliensis [] and L. amazonensis [] decreased lesion formation and parasite
  burdens, suggesting that TLR2 is required for disease promotion. In RAW macrophages,
  the infection with L. amazonensis promotes the phosphorylation of PKR and the activation
  of the PKR promoter and enhances the synthesis of both PKR and of type 1-IFNs, and
  those events require TLR2 []. The levels of SOD1 expression are elevated in association
  with PKR activation and IFNβ production, resulting in increased parasite replication
  []. L. donovani downmodulates TLR2 responses in macrophages by inhibiting MAPp38
  kinase, leading to IL10 production []. The dashed lines indicate that intermediate
  steps of the pathways are either not identified or not represented in the figure.
