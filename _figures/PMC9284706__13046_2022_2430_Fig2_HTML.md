caption: The role of purinergic pathway in RT-induced ICD. A ATP in RT-induced T-cell-mediated
  ICD. Tumor cells release ATP (via cell lysis, channels such as PANX-1, and P2X7R),
  chemokines, and tumor antigens following RT to recruit immature DCs to TIME. ATP
  then binds to its receptors (P2XR/P2YR) on immature DCs leading to their activation.
  These DCs can take up and process tumor antigens released from dying tumor cells
  to transform into mature DCs. Mature DCs can then migrate to tumor-draining lymph
  nodes (TDLN), where DCs secret IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ and cross-present tumor
  antigen peptides by MHC I to stimulate T-cell differentiation to CD8+ CTLs. CTLs
  can then migrate to the tumor site and maybe remote sites to recognize and kill
  residue tumor cells by releasing perforin, granzyme B, and/or through the interaction
  of the Fas/FasL signaling. B Production of ADO leads to a post-RT immunosuppressive
  TIME. Hypoxia induced by RT upregulates the expression of HIF1-α, leading to the
  overexpression of CD39 and CD73 of cancer cells to hydrolyze large amounts of ATP
  to ADO in TIME. ADO is contributed to an immunosuppressive TIME to enable tumor
  cells to escape immune-surveillance by suppressing the effector immune components
  including Teff, DCs, NK cells, and neutrophils, while enhancing the activity of
  immunosuppressive cell subsets including Treg, M2-macrophage, and MDSC, in which
  pharmacological antagonists against A2AR and/or A2BR as well as blockades inhibiting
  CD39 and CD73 can reverse ADO-induced immunosuppressive TIME to favor antitumor
  immunity. A2AR, A2A adenosine receptor; A2BR, A2B adenosine receptor; ADO, adenosine;
