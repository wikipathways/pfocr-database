caption: Essential factors promoting AN biosynthesis. Endogenous and exogenous factors
  that positively affect AN biosynthesis. Different abiotic factors inducing plant
  defense, trichome proliferation and, consequently, AN production. Seven transcription
  factors have been identified so far in the positive regulation of any of the AN
  pathway enzymes. Plant hormones ABA, GA, JA, and SA also positively affect both
  trichome proliferation and artemisinin biosynthesis. Dashed, colored arrows indicate
  TFs that directly regulate hormone biosynthetic pathways.
