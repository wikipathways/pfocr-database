caption: Schematic diagram of vasodilation induced by BSO. Steps 1 to 5 represent
  the signaling pathway through which BSO affects vascular relaxation. BSO induces
  vasorelaxation via endothelium-dependent signaling; its mechanisms are related to
  the activation of the PI3K-Akt-eNOS-NO signaling pathways in the endothelial cells
  and the activation of the NO-sGC-cGMP-K+ channel signaling pathways in the vascular
  smooth muscle cells. In addition, SOCE-eNOS pathways and the inhibition of Ca2+
  mobilization from intracellular stores are associated with BSO-induced vasorelaxation
