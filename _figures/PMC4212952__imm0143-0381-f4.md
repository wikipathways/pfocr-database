caption: Network pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in different subgroups
  of patients and controls. (a) Untreated patients with generalized form of disease
  compared with controls; (b) untreated patients with generalized form of disease
  compared with treated patients; (c) untreated patients with generalized form of
  disease compared with patients with the localized form of the disease. Genes and
  gene products are represented as individual nodes whose shapes represent the functional
  class of the gene products.
