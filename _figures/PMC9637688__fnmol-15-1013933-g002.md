caption: Disruption of BBB recruits the immune cells and cytokines into CNS. In healthy
  status, the integrity of BBB protects the CNS from toxins, pathogens, inflammatory
  cytokines, and immune cell infiltration. However, during inflammation, neutrophils
  and T cells from outside of CNS are recruited into CNS through transcytosis or paracellular
  pathway, which secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to further disrupt
  the integrity of BBB and deteriorate the CNS disease or injuries. Moreover, ACs
  and microglia are further activated by the cytokines, chemokines, and immune cells
  outside of CNS, which integrated with inflammatory factors outside of CNS will eventually
  lead to neurodegeneration and may induce cognitive impairment.

  description: Disruption of BBB recruits the immune cells and cytokines into CNS.
    In healthy status, the integrity of BBB protects the CNS from toxins, pathogens,
    inflammatory cytokines, and immune cell infiltration. However, during inflammation,
    neutrophils and T cells from outside of CNS are recruited into CNS through transcytosis
    or paracellular pathway, which secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
    to further disrupt the integrity of BBB and deteriorate the CNS disease or injuries.
    Moreover, ACs and microglia are further activated by the cytokines, chemokines,
    and immune cells outside of CNS, which integrated with inflammatory factors outside
    of CNS will eventually lead to neurodegeneration and may induce cognitive impairment.
