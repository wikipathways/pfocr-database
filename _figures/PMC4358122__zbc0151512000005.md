caption: Model for reciprocal regulation of AMPK and PLD. Two scenarios are presented
  for the regulation of PLD by AMPK and the regulation of AMPK by PLD. A, AMPK is
  activated by the presence AMP and phosphorylation by LKB1. AMPK then phosphorylates
  TSC, which stimulates the GAP activity of TSC for Rheb, resulting in the hydrolysis
  of bound GTP to GDP and inactivation of Rheb. As a consequence, PLD is not activated
  (), and the PA needed for stabilization of mTORC1 () is not generated, so mTORC1
  is inactive. B, Rheb is GTP-bound and promotes the production of PA by PLD and the
  stabilization of mTORC1. Active mTORC1 then causes suppression of AMPK in a manner
  that is likely dependent on S6 kinase in that rapamycin has been reported to activate
  AMPK () at concentrations that suppress S6 kinase (). Other signals promoted by
  oncogenic stimuli contribute to the activation of this pathway, such as mTORC2-Akt,
  which suppresses TSC (), and Ras, which leads to PLD activation (). It is also important
  to note that mTOR is an integrator on nutrient and growth factor signals (), both
  of which are required for cell cycle progression and proliferation. mTOR requires
  amino acids (), glucose (), and possibly lipids () for activity.
