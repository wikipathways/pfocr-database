caption: Schematic representation of the potential mechanism by which PTS alleviates
  renal fibrosis. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) induces significant damage
  to kidney tissue, leading to the release of various inflammatory mediators, including
  TNF-α, TGF-β1, and IL-6. This, in turn, triggers the phosphorylation of Smad2/3
  within the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway. PTS attenuate these effects by inhibiting
  the inflammatory response and reducing the expression of fibrosis markers, such
  as Col-I α-SMA, and FN
