caption: Diagram illustrating the contribution of pivotal microbial members to nitrogen
  transformations in the MAS system. Three key pathways, nitrification, denitrification,
  and DNRA, with the key enzymes detected in metatranscriptomic data, are shown. The
  thickness of each continuous arrow indicates the transcription level of an assigned
  metabolic pathway of nitrogen transformation in the community. The microbial members
  responsible for each pathway are appended and colored according to phylum/class.
  The numbers in parentheses show the transcripts (> 45 TPM) of the key enzymes from
  each microbial member under control (left) and high DO (right) conditions. The remarkable
  gene upregulation under a high DO condition is highlighted by a vertical arrow
