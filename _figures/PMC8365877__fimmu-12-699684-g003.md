caption: Molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs promote B cell hyperactivity in SLE
  patients. These aberrant expressed miRNAs promote B cells abnormal activation and
  autoantibodies production in SLE by affecting important protein molecules in the
  B cell signaling pathway. MiR-15a interacts the Bcl-2 gene directly, which leads
  to the decrease of Bcl-2 and activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway of regulatory
  B-10 cells. MiR-7 mediates the suppression of PTEN/AKT signaling, and then promotes
  B cell differentiation into plasma cells and spontaneous germinal center formation.
  Decreasing miR-155 in B cells contributes to the SHIP-1 reduction, which leads to
  the production of serum IgG anti-dsDNA antibodies. MiR-155 also suppresses PU.1
  and TNF-α, and then inhibits BAFF and CD19 protein expression, and promotes the
  B cell proliferation and antibody production in SLE. MiR-30a increases in B cells
  of SLE patients and directly decreases the expression of Lyn, an important mediator
  of B cell activation, via targeting with the 3’-UTR of Lyn mRNA. MOMP, Mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization; BAX/BAK, Bcl-2-associated X protein/Bcl-2 homologous
  antagonist killer.
