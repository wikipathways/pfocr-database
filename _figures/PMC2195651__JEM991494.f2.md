caption: Inhibition of death receptor signaling as a mechanism of tumor immune escape.
  CTLs use two major pathways (perforin/granzyme granule exocytosis and Fas) to induce
  target cell (tumor) death by apoptosis after TCR–MHC–peptide complex engagement.
  By downregulating Fas surface expression or by producing FLIP, tumor cells can escape
  immune destruction mediated by the Fas death receptor signaling pathway in vivo,
  despite the persistence of a functional perforin/granzyme granule exocytosis pathway.
