caption: Cell extrinsic recognition of infected cells. A virally-infected non-antigen
  presenting cells recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) (blue
  lines indicate viral nucleic acids) within the cytosol via the RIG-I-like receptors
  (RLRs), leading to secretion of type I interferons (IFNs) and other factors that
  activate dendritic cells. Infected dead cells are taken up by non-infected dendritic
  cells and viral PAMPs (blue) are recognized through endosomal Toll like receptors
  (TLRs). Viral antigens (red) are processed and presented on major histocompatability
  (MHC) class II (via the conventional endosomal pathway) or MHC class I (via cross-presentation).
  TLR signaling leads to the induction of costimulatory molecules and cytokines necessary
  for activation and differentiation of T lymphocytes.
