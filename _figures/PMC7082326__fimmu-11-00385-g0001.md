caption: The mitochondrial PTEN-succinate axis promotes P. aeruginosa airway infection.
  (A) Once interacting with surface TLR4 receptor, P. aeruginosa LPS triggers inflammation.
  Mitochondria become depolarized producing ROS and succinate (yellow circles). This
  is a tightly regulated process by the CFTR-PTEN complex, which signals through Akt
  and PI3Kγ/δ to suppress LPS-TLR4-driven inflammation. Succinate leaked into the
  cytoplasm inhibits PHD, which activates HIF-1α to induce production of pro-IL-1β.
  In parallel, P. aeruginosa release soluble LPS in the cytoplasm, flagellin or inject
  T3SS toxins. These activate different inflammasomes, priming caspases and cleavage
  of pro-IL-1β to produce IL-1β. Gasdermin D form pores in the cell membrane releasing
  mature IL-1β and causing cell death. Once extracellular, IL-1β induces recruitment
  of more immune cells to clear infection. (B) Laboratory and P. aeruginosa clinical
  strains derived from acutely infected patients (e.g., ICU) are more immunostimulatory
  than host-adapted isolates, such as in CF. (C) The immunosignaling metabolite succinate
  induces crc-dependent polysaccharide production by repressing glucose catabolism
  in P. aeruginosa. Extracellular ROS and surface contact also induce c-di-GMP generation,
  which promotes the synthesis of Pel, Psl and alginate and biofilm production. The
  pro-gluconeogenic glyoxylate shunt pathway contributes with extracellular polysaccharides
  production by shunting carbon atoms into glucose synthesis. (D) Insufficient CFTR-PTEN
  interaction induces excessive succinate release (yellow circles) by immune cells
  and P. aeruginosa airway adaptation. In healthy individuals (upper panel), the CFTR-PTEN
  complex regulates the oxidative state of mitochondria. In cystic fibrosis patients
  (lower panel), lack of membrane CFTR-PTEN induces mitochondrial deregulation, producing
  ROS and more succinate release. Cytoplasmic succinate is excreted into the extracellular
  milieu feeding P. aeruginosa. Succinate-stressed P. aeruginosa upregulate anti-oxidant
  genes, causing metabolic adaptation, extracellular polysaccharide synthesis (color
  lines) and biofilm production. Biofilm-producing P. aeruginosa attach to the airway
  parenchyma, which protects them from phagocytes, antibiotics and antibodies.
