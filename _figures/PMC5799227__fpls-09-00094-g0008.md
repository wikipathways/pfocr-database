caption: A model for OsDRAP1-Mediated Stress Tolerance. Through a set of plant hormones
  pathways, the rice feels the stress signal and induce the expression of OsDRAP1.
  Interacting with other stress related proteins, including OsCBSX3, OsRACK1A, OsRZFP34,
  OsAPX2, and OsCATC, OsDRAP1 activate stress responsive genes which regulate water
  balance, redox homeostasis and vascular development directly or indirectly. Several
  stress responsive TFs (OsEATB, OsERF5, OsMYB4, and OsWRKY89) and a gene encoding
  cellulose synthase-like family A (CSLA11) induced by OsDRAP1 complex are likely
  to mediated by JA signaling pathway (OsJAZ8, OsJAZ13, Jasmonate-zim-domain protein
  1, and Jasmonate O-methyltransferase). OsDRAP1 mediate stress tolerance especially
  DT via its regulation of these stress responding genes.
