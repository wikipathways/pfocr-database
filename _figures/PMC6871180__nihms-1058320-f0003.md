caption: a | In the healthy cardiomyocyte, both desmosomes and adherens junctions
  in the area composita form strong intercellular connections with neighbouring cells.
  Likewise, both the gap junction, formed by connexin 43 (Cx43), and the sodium channel
  (Nav1.5) are appropriately positioned as a result of coordinated trafficking and
  membrane tethering. Catenin-β1 has a structural function in adherens junctions as
  well as a role in modifying transcriptional activity through activation of WNT-dependent
  gene expression. Cytoplasmic catenin-β1 is quickly degraded through proteosomal
  targeting by the destruction complex (DC), which contains glycogen synthase kinase
  3β (GSK3β). The Hippo pathway is appropriately ‘off’, allowing for transcription
  of genes that promote cardiomyocyte survival, function (‘pro-myocyte’) and growth.
  Calcium flux is well regulated in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through functioning
  sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), phospholamban and
  ryanodine receptor 2. b | In arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), multiple signalling
  pathways seem to be perturbed. (1) Disruption of the desmosomes and adherens junctions
  leads to increased mechanical stress on the cardiomyocyte. (2) Plakoglobin can dissociate
  from the desmosome, further destabilizing the intercalated disc and (3) inhibiting
  WNT-dependent gene transcription. (4) Activation of the Hippo pathway, potentially
  through neurofibromin 2 (NF2), results in inhibition of gene targets and promotes
  a pro-apoptotic and adipogenic phenotype. (5) Likewise, microRNAs can modulate both
  Hippo and WNT signalling. (6) Active Hippo signalling leads to phosphorylation of
  Yes-associated protein (YAP), which potentially associates with both plakoglobin
  and catenin-β1 at the plasma membrane, sequestering catenin-β1 and further inhibiting
  canonical WNT signalling. (7) Increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ
  (PPARγ) expression has been associated with WNT inhibition, potentially through
  a direct relationship that promotes catenin-β1 degradation. (8) GSK3β translocates
  to the plasma membrane, although the relevance of this change in localization is
  uncertain. (9) Dysregulation of calcium handling in the SR is thought to contribute
  to arrhythmogenesis in a subset of patients. (10) Abnormal shuttling and tethering
  of both the sodium channel and gap junction components (Cx43) have been suspected
  to be involved in arrhythmogenesis. (ii) Increased pro-inflammatory and profibrotic
  cytokine production, including transforming grown factor-β1 (TGFβ1) and TGFβ3, is
  thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of ACM via canonical and non-canonical
  pathways. LATS, large tumour suppressor homologue; MST, mammalian STE20-like protein
  kinase; TEAD, transcriptional enhancer factor TEF.
