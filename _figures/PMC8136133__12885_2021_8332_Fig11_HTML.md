caption: a Interaction network of PDE9A gene derived from GeneMANIA. GeneMANIA shows
  the interactions for genes linked with each other according to physical interaction,
  genetic interactions, co-expression, pathway, co-localization, and shared protein
  domain. b Protein-protein interaction network for PDE9A gene from STRING database.
  The interaction network shows that these 20 proteins significantly interact with
  PDE9A. According to the website, colored nodes represent query proteins and first
  shell of interactors; white nodes represent second shell of interactors; empty nodes
  represent proteins of unknown 3D structure; filled nodes represent some 3D structure
  is known or predicted
