caption: Roles of miRNAs in modulating the autophagy process in human breast cancer.
  MiR-486-5p is said to downregulate PTEN and this activates PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
  to inhibit autophagy activity []. An in vitro study reported eighteen miRNAs were
  involved in downregulating the signaling hub which covers ULK1 and these miRNA include
  miR-30c-1, miR-149, miR-611, miR-615-5p, miR-659, miR-636, miR-638, miR-659, miR-675,
  miR-1303, miR-1308, miR-1908, miR-1914, miR-1915, miR-2861, miR-3184, miR-4292 and
  miR-4259 []. This group of miRNAs was also found to downregulate the signalling
  hub which involves Beclin-1 by inhibiting the MAPK/JNK1 signalling pathway []. Another
  five miRNAs were reported to inhibit the ULK kinase complex and these include miR-20a
  and miR-20b [], miR-25 [], miR-489 [] and miR-1275 []. On the other hand, Beclin-1
  expression was found to be negatively correlated to the expression of miR-20a [],
  miR-21 [] and miR-221 []. MiR-20a could also suppress ATG16L1 expression [] while
  miR-567 and miR-638 could negatively regulate ATG5 expression [, ]. Overexpression
  of miR-101 was linked to ATG4 downregulation [] whereas upregulation of miR-1275
  was related to ATG7 suppression [], and both ATG4 and ATG7 are important in the
  LC3-II production []. Other miRNAs which were involved in suppressing cellular LC3-II
  production include miR-21 [], miR-27a [] and miR-96-5p [] while miR-638 was found
  to be involved in promoting LC3-II production []. Four miRNAs were reported to be
  involved in suppressing SQSTM1/p62 expression and these miRNAs include miR-20a [],
  miR-27a [], miR-96-5p [] and miR-638 []
