caption: 'Relationship between type 2 diabetes and oxidative stress. Hyperglycemia,
  dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance play key roles in oxidative stress and diabetes
  development. Briefly, increased glucose levels promote different mechanisms, such
  as autoxidation of glucose, accumulation of advanced glycation-end products (AGE)
  and nitric oxide (NO), activation of diacylglycerol (DAG), activation of polyol-sorbitol
  pathway, and an increase in protein kinase C (PKC), which, in turn, lead to the
  generation of oxidative stress, impairment of mitochondrial function, and induction
  of inflammatory events. The figure summarizes the most relevant involved processes
  and signaling pathways. Up and down arrows indicate an increase and decrease, respectively.

  kinase; ETC, electron transport chain; FoxO1, Forkhead box protein O1; GPx, glutathione

  NF-кB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; NO, nitric
