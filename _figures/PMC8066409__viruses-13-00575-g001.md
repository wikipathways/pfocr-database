caption: The transcriptional and non-transcriptional activation of IRF3 by virus-activated
  signaling pathways lead to host antiviral response. The PRRs, e.g., TLR3, RIG-I,
  MDA-5, and cGAS, present at different cellular locations, recognize the viral nucleic
  acids (RNA or DNA) upon their entry into the host cell. In the transcriptional activation
  of IRF3, the PRR-mediated signaling pathways activate the downstream kinases, TBK1
  and IKKε, and directly phosphorylate the cytosolic IRF3. The phosphorylated IRF3
  translocates to the nucleus to transcribe the antiviral genes, e.g., IFNβ and ISG.
  In the non-transcriptional pathway, IRF3 gets activated by ubiquitination and translocates
  to the mitochondria to activate the intrinsic caspases, leading to apoptotic cell
  death. The transcriptional and non-transcriptional pathways of IRF3 contribute to
  the overall antiviral response of the host. A dsRNA-binding protein PKR can also
  trigger cellular apoptosis by activating eIF2α, which inhibits protein synthesis.
