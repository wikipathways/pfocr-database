caption: Schematic representation of how coronavirus disrupts signaling pathways (autophagy,
  ER stress, cytokine storm, and hypoxia) and induces cell death. Autophagy is initiated
  by the formation of ULK1/2-ATG13-FIP200 complex and then generation of Beclin1 complex
  and initiation of autophagy vesicle formation. Coronaviral proteins can regulate
  autophagy through modulating function of autophagy regulatory protein at different
  stages of autophagy. Viral infection can inhibit ER function and induces ER stress
  and cell death. Viral protein expresses in ER and upregulates downstream ER stress
  signaling through modulation the function of ATF6, IRE1 and pERK, and elF2a. Upstream
  kinases in the JNK and p38 signaling pathways are activated upon infection with
  SARS-CoV. This activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKK3/6, MKK4,
  and MKK7). Mkk3/6 and Mkk4 activate p38. SARS-CoV can also directly activate p38
  or the SARS-CoV E protein can activate syntenin, which in tune activates p38. These
  pathways activate proinflammatory cytokine production. MKK4 and MKK7 can also activate
  JNK. SARS-CoV s, N, 3a, 3b, and 7a proteins can also directly activate JNK. This
  pathway activates proinflammatory cytokine production and induction of apoptosis.
  Also, due to viral infection in the lungs, there is restricted supply of O2 in the
  blood, which generate hypoxia and cell death and major organ dysfunction; CQ, chloroquine
  and HCQ, hydroxychloroquine.
