caption: 'a A model showing the possible role of βA3/A1-crystallin in the PITPβ/PLCγ
  signaling axis and PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 turnover, and consequently in EGFR
  activation and internalization. Top: RPE cells lacking βA3/A1-crystallin have increased
  PLCγ1 and PKC activity, which leads to decreased PI(4,5)P2. EGFR activation is inhibited
  by the PI(4,5)P2 deficiency and activated PKC through a negative feedback loop.
  Bottom: overexpression of βA3/A1-crystallin attenuated phosphorylated PLCγ1, possibly
  by influencing PITPβ activity. The PI(4,5)P2 level may be temporarily increased.
  Having sufficient PI(4,5)P2 promotes EGFR activation. On the other hand, decreased
  PKC activity may not affect EGFR dimerization. Due to the activation of EGFR, more
  PI(4,5)P2 was converted to PI(3,4,5)P3 because of the activation of AKT by PI3K,
  which may subsequently lead to PI(3,4,5)P3 upregulation and PI(4,5)P2 downregulation.
  b Cartoon depicting the pathway initiated by the βA3/A1-crystallin deficiency leading
  to RPE apical surface disruption and impaired EGFR endocytosis. Loss of functional
  βA3/A1-crystallin prevents its interaction with PITPβ causing a modification of
  PIP metabolism that eventually impairs both EGFR endocytosis and ezrin phosphorylation,
  thereby altering the actin cytoskeleton and affecting RPE cell polarity.'
