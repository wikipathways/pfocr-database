caption: Proposed model for PIM biosynthesis and regulation. A, chemical structure
  of PIM. One Manp residue (in beige) is attached to position 2 of myo-inositol (in
  red), whereas the total number of Manp residues attached to position 6 may range
  from zero to five. In PIM2, the myo-inositol ring is glycosylated with a Manp unit
  at each of positions 2 and 6 (beige). In PIM4, a dimannosyl unit, t-α-Manp(1→6)-α-Manp(1→6)
  (yellow), further extends the Manp linked to position 6 of the myo-inositol ring
  of PIM2. PIM6 results from the elongation of PIM4 by the dimannosyl unit t-α-Manp(1→2)-α-Manp(1→2)
  (orange). AcylT, acyltransferase; n.d., not determined. B, topology model for the
  biosynthesis of PIMs, LM, and LAM in mycobacteria. See text for details. The precise
  identity of the PIM intermediate(s) translocated from the cytosolic to the periplasmic
  side of the plasma membrane, whether (Ac1/2)PIM2, (Ac1/2)PIM3, or (Ac1/2)PIM4, remains
  to be determined. The biosynthesis of PIMs takes place on both sides of the inner
  membrane. Synthesis is initiated on the cytoplasmic side, where Manp is transferred
  from GDP-Manp to PI, followed by one to three additional Manp residues. On the periplasmic
  side, the mannolipid is extended by additional Manp residues up to PIM6. The enzymes
  involved belong to the GT-C fold family of GTs, which are predicted to have between
  8 and 13 transmembrane α-helices with the active site located on an extracytoplasmic
  loop. Subsequent mannosylation and arabinosylation steps in LM and LAM biosynthesis
  (light blue, Manp residues; dark blue, Araf residues; white, Manp-capping residues)
  are thought to all take place on the periplasmic side of the plasma membrane, requiring
  polyprenyl-phosphate-sugar donors. As an important part of the literature on the
  biosynthesis of PIM, LM, and LAM refers to the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genes, the
  Rv numbers of the proteins required for the different catalytic steps of the pathway
  are indicated. The M. tuberculosis CDC1551 nomenclature was used in the case of
  pimC (MT1800), as this gene lacks an ortholog in H37Rv.
