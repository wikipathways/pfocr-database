caption: Proposed model of mode of action of M. tuberculosis Rv0297PGRS domain. Expression
  of the PGRS domain of Rv0297 in human cells leads to its ER localization, which
  results in the expression of proteins involved in the unfolded protein response
  (UPR) pathway, i.e., GRP94, GRP78, and ER stress markers, i.e., CHOP and ATF4. Induction
  of ER stress is followed by disruption of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and increased
  NO and ROS production. These ER stress responses result in apoptosis of macrophage
  cells, which may lead to dissemination of infection from lung granulomas.
