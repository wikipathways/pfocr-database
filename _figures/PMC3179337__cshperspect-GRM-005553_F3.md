caption: Gap junctional communication between the oocyte and the surrounding somatic
  cells regulates oocyte meiotic maturation. (A) High levels of cyclic adenosine 3′,
  5′-monophosphate (cAMP) in the oocyte inhibit meiotic maturation in mammals. The
  inhibitory cAMP is produced by the oocyte itself via the activation of the GPR3/Gs/adenylyl
  cyclase pathway. Guanosine 3′, 5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) produced by the cumulus
  somatic cells flows through gap junctions into the oocyte to inhibit PDE3A, the
  phosphodiesterase responsible for the hydrolysis of cAMP. The oocyte stimulates
  the expression of natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) (red), a guanylyl cyclase,
  in the cumulus cells. Mural granulosa cells induce the generation of cGMP by secreting
  the NPR2 ligand, natriuretic peptide precursor type C (NPPC) (green). Binding of
  luteinizing hormone (LH) to its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (blue) reverses
  the inhibition of meiotic maturation by decreasing the synthesis of cGMP in the
  somatic follicular layer and by blocking its diffusion through gap junctions. (B)
  In C. elegans, the Gαo/ipathway in gonadal sheath cells (blue) leads to the inactivation
  of adenylate cyclase 4 (ACY-4) and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA) in the absence
  of sperm. This inhibition is postulated to stabilize gonadal sheath-to-oocyte gap
  junctions composed of innexin (Inx) proteins (Inx-22 and Inx-14), and thereby allow
  the influx of a negative regulatory signal into the oocyte, which blocks MAP kinase
  (MAPK) activation and meiotic maturation. In parallel, the VAB-1/Ephrin Receptor
  in the oocyte inhibits MAPK and oocyte maturation. Sperm-derived major sperm protein
  (MSP) antagonizes both the sheath Gαo/i and oocyte VAB-1 signaling pathways, while
  simultaneously activating the sheath Gαspathway, resulting in MAPK activation and
  meiotic maturation. It is hypothesized that the Gαspathway destabilizes sheath-oocyte
  gap junctions. The nuclear POU homeodomain protein is required for proper differentiation
  of gonadal sheath cells. (B, Adapted from  and ; reprinted with express permission
