caption: DNA double strand break (DSBs) repair. (A) DNA DSBs repair pathways in the
  context of cell cycle regulation. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) can be performed
  throughout the cell cycle and is indicated with the red line. Homologous recombination
  (HR) can only be employed in S/G2 phases of the cell cycle and is indicated in green.
  (B) The key steps in HR repair pathway are indicated. After DSB recognition, 5′–3′
  end resection is initiated by the MRN (Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1) complex and CtIP. Subsequently,
  further resection by the Exo1, DNA2, and Sgs1 proteins is conducted to ensure ‘maintained’
  resection. Then, resected DNA-ends are bound by replication protein A (RPA). The
  actual recombination step within HR repair, termed strand exchange, is executed
  by the recombinase Rad51. Rad51 replaces RPA to eventually assemble helical nucleoprotein
  filaments called ‘presynaptic filaments.’ This process is facilitated by other HR
  components, including BRCA1 and BRCA2. Final step of junction resolution is executed
  by helicases including Bloom syndrome, RecQ helicase-like (BLM) helicase.
