caption: (A) AKAP5 mediates cardiac glucotoxicity. Elevated extracellular glucose
  induces the up-regulation of AKAP5 and favors DAG synthesis. This increases plasma
  membrane anchoring and activation of PKC, which, in turn, phosphorylates p47phox
  and the p65 subunit of NFκB. p47phox phosphorylation leads to the assembly of Nox
  at the plasma membrane, ROS production, oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte damage.
  P65-NFκB phosphorylation leads to NFκB in nuclear translocation, and the consequent
  transcriptional activation of inflammatory and pro-apoptotic genes, which further
  enhance myocardial dysfunction. (B) AKAP12-mediated inhibition of Ang-II and TGFβ1
  signaling in cardiac cells. Ang-II, a ligand that is locally produced by the myocardium
  in stressed hearts, activates type I Ang-II receptors, which promote TGFβ1 gene
  activation. Increased TGFβ1 levels, favor the activation of the TGFβ receptor pathway,
  which leads to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the Smad2/3 complex,
  and the consequent increase in inflammatory and pro-apoptotic gene expression. AKAP12
  reduces inflammatory and apoptotic responses in cardiac muscle cells by exerting
  an inhibitory effect on Ang-II induced TGFβ1 expression, and TGFβ1-induced Smad2/3
  activation. (C) The role of AKAP12 in aldosterone-induced oxidative stress in cardiac
  fibroblasts. Aldosterone, via its mineralocorticoid receptor, decreases AKAP12 mRNA
  and protein expression. AKAP12 down-regulation is associated with a decrease in
  PGC-1α, which impairs mitochondrial biogenesis and induces ROS production leading
  to oxidative stress.
