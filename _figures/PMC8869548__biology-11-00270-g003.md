caption: 'Glutamine metabolism in the mitochondrion and malonate metabolism in the
  cytosol. The Figure shows glutamine metabolism, which eventually leads to the formation
  of lactate in the cytosol. This process is dependent on two groups of enzymes: mitochondrial
  and cytosolic. Inside the mitochondrion, glutamine is deaminated by GLS1 or GLS1
  to glutamate and a waste product (ammonia). Then, glutamate is dehydrogenated by
  GLDH to α-ketoglutarate, which could be directly incorporated into the TCA cycle
  or indirectly incorporated after carboxylation to isocitrate. Some α-ketoglutarate
  in mitochondrion is converted to malonate. This molecule crosses the mitochondrial
  membrane and reaches the cytosolic space. Here, the last pathway step occurs: malate
  dehydrogenation by LDHA, leading to the formation of lactate. GLS1, GLS2—glutaminase
  1, glutaminase 2; GLDH —glutamate dehydrogenase; LDHA—lactate dehydrogenase A; TCA—tricarboxylic
  acid.'
