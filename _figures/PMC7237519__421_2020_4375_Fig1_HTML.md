caption: Simplified illustration of the kynurenine pathway and related immuno- and
  neuro-modulatory properties. While TRP and KYN can cross the blood-brain barrier
  and can be further degraded to neuroactive metabolites, QA and KA are not able to
  cross the blood-brain barrier. Concerning interactions of the KYN pathway with the
  immune system, KYN was described to suppress the proliferation of effector cells.
  Additionally, KYN and KA are ligands of the AhR, which enhances the differentiation
  of naive CD4+ T-cells to regulatory T-cells, thereby mediating immunosuppression.
  TRP tryptophan; KYN kynurenine, QA quinolinic acid; KA kynurenic acid; NAD+ nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide+; NMDAN-methyl-d-aspartate; AhR aryl hydrocarbon receptor
papertitle: Acute hypertrophic but not maximal strength loading transiently enhances
  the kynurenine pathway towards kynurenic acid.
