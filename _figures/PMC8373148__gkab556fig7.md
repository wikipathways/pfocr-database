caption: Long-term potentiation (LTP) pathway in the context of schizophrenia. The
  figure depicts the overlap of the LTP pathway with the schizophrenia co-expression
  network in addition to the normal co-expression network. Protein-protein interactions
  and associations between proteins and/or protein complexes are displayed as colored
  edges, while black edges denote membership of proteins to protein complexes. Edges
  that were common to both the LTP pathway, the disease co-expression network and/or
  the normal co-expression network are bolded, while grey edges denote correlations
  exclusively from the schizophrenia co-expression network. Differential gene expression
  analysis was performed and genes that were up- and down-regulated are colored orange
  and blue, respectively, with those that were significantly differentially expressed
  (i.e. adj. P value < 0.05) given less transparency. Protein complex nodes are then
  additionally colored if all members are in agreement with the direction of regulation.
  The code to generate this figure for any combination of disease co-expression network
  and pathway can be found at https://github.com/CoXPath/CoXPath/blob/main/analysis/3.5_analysis.ipynb.
