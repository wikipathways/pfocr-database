caption: eIF2B and the VLCFA functional pathways. (A) Diagram showing the GEF pathway
  of eIF2B that is required for recharging eIF2 with GTP to begin a new round of translation
  initiation. (B) Diagram showing the cyclical VLCFA elongase pathway and the genes
  required for the catalytic steps. Also depicted is the pathway utilizing VLCFAs
  by the ceramide synthase complex LAC1/LAG1 and LIP1 to make ceramide. Ceramide is
  later modified to generate various sphingolipids.
