caption: Ferroptosis is triggered by excessive lipid peroxidation. ox-LDL induces
  iron accumulation. Free iron has strong endothelial cytotoxicity and, at the same
  time, lipid-laden macrophages accumulate in the arterial subendothelial space, which
  promotes the inflammatory response of the arterial wall. Iron deposition in plaques
  causes ox-LDL to activate the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and promotes foam cell
  formation. Ferric iron retention in atherosclerotic plaques promotes oxidative stress,
  lipid peroxidation and increases the instability of plaque. The occurrence of ferroptosis
  is involved in numerous processes of atherosclerosis. Lipid peroxidation, plaque
  hemorrhage and iron deposition are important characteristics of advanced atherosclerotic
  plaques. LDL, low-density lipoprotein; ox-LDL, oxidized LDL; MMPs, matrix metalloproteases;
  CRP, C-reactive protein; SMC, smooth muscle cell.
