caption: H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses differentially regulate the acute-phase response
  during infection. The diagrams show transcriptional changes for cytokine signaling
  pathway molecules in mouse lungs infected with either H5N1 virus () (A), 1918 virus
  () (B), or seasonal H1N1 virus () (C). Microarray data were background corrected
  and normalized by LOESS and quantile normalization. Expression values were represented
  as log2 ratios of infected to respective mock-infected samples, where biological
  and technical replicates for a given condition were averaged. PathVisio was used
  for data visualization () of the acute-phase response signaling pathway from IPA
  (Ingenuity Systems). Official gene symbols are shown. Serum amyloid (Saa2 and Saa3)
  and serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor (Serpina1d and Serpina3a) represent
  acute-phase response proteins. Red indicates that the gene expression is increased
  relative to that for the uninfected reference. Green indicates that the gene expression
  is lower than that for the uninfected reference. White indicates no change in gene
  expression, and gray indicates that a molecule was not detected by microarray analysis.
  inf, infected; d, days postinfection.
