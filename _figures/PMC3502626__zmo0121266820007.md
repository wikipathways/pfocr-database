caption: A theoretical model of synergistic interactions between resveratrol and HDAC
  inhibitors is presented. Resveratrol triggers multiple actions in human leukemia
  cells, including Sirt1 activation, ROS induction, and S-phase synchronization. Activation
  of Sirt1 blocks cytoprotective NF-κB activation by preventing HDACI-mediated p65
  acetylation. In addition, resveratrol induces ROS generation, which, in conjunction
  with HDACIs, promotes up-regulation of DR5 and activation of the extrinsic apoptotic
  cascade, followed by release of mitochondrial death proteins (e.g., cytochrome c),
  thus fully engaging apoptotic signaling cascades. Alternatively, ROS may directly
  cause mitochondrial damage. Resveratrol synchronizes cells in S-phase and they may
  be particularly susceptible to HDACI- and/or ROS-mediated DNA damage, which contributes
  to the activation of cell death pathways. Casp, caspase; DSB, double-strand breaks;
  c, cytochrome c; Apaf, apoptotic protease-activating factor. Solid lines, prodeath
  signals; dashed lines, prosurvival signals.
