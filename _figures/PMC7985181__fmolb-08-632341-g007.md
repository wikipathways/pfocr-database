caption: The relationship among some significantly changed pathways and differential
  metabolites involved in each metabolic pathway. The red arrow indicates the growth
  stage from young mushroom to marketable mature mushroom, the blue arrow indicates
  the growth stage from marketable mature mushroom to physiological maturity mushroom.
  The directions of the arrow indicate the up-regulation and down-regulation of metabolites.
