caption: Host immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 proteins. SARS-CoV-2 triggers IFN signaling
  pathway after being recognized by RIG-1 and MDA5. Different SARS-CoV-2 proteins
  interfere with these pathways in different ways. NSP8 and NSP13 inhibit TBK1 phosphorylation.
  NSP6, NSP8, NSP13, OR9b, and M inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation. NSP12, NSP14, NSP15,
  ORF6, and ORF9b inhibit the nuclear translocation of IRF3. NSP1, NSP6, NSP13, ORF3a,
  and ORF7b inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation. ORF9b inhibits TOM70. NSP6, NSP13, ORF7a,
  and ORF7b inhibit STAT2 phosphorylation. NSP13 and ORF6 inhibit the nuclear translocation
  of STAT1 to antagonize IFN signaling. ORF6 blocks STAT1 nuclear translocation by
  interacting with the Nup98-RAE1 complex and disrupts the interaction between Nup98
  and importin-β1/importin-α1/PY-STAT1 complex, thus preventing the docking of this
  complex at the nuclear pore. ORF8 inhibits MHC-I to impair antigen-presenting cells.
  [NSP, non-structural protein; ORF, open reading frame; TOM70, translocase of outer
  membrane 70 KDa Subunit; IFN, interferon; STAT, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; IRF9, interferon regulatory
  factor 9; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; ISGs, interferon-stimulated genes; MHC-I, major
  histocompatibility complex I; Nup98-RAE1 complex, nucleoporin 98 (Nup98)–ribonucleic
  acid export 1 (RAE1)].
