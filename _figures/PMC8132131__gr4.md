caption: H2S interacts with other signaling molecules in the guard cell signaling
  network.Exogenous H2S can pass through the phospholipid membrane, and the synthesis
  of HSNO with NO may enhance membrane permeability. In the cytoplasm, DES1 uses cysteine
  as a substrate to produce H2S, which amplifies the signal by inducing DES1 persulfidation and
  initiates downstream signaling through persulfidation of SnRK2.6, RBOHD, and ABI4.
  H2S directly or indirectly enhances K+out and Cl−out transport and inhibits K+in
  transport on the plasma membrane, and the opposite regulation of ion currents may
  exist on the vacuolar membrane. In addition, H2S promotes the production of H2O2
  indirectly by increasing ATP production and secretion, PLD synthesis, phospholipid
  acid signaling, Ca2+signaling, and NO synthesis. Notably, H2S, NO, and H2O2 can
  promote one another and function together in the regulation of stomatal closure.
