caption: 'Schematic summary of glucose uptake via GLUT1 and GLUT4 transporters and
  entry of glucose into the glycolytic pathway (purple arrows) leading to the generation
  of pyruvate. In heart failure, impaired entry of pyruvate into mitochondria or decreased
  mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism leads to accumulation of glycolytic intermediates
  and increased flux into accessory pathways (blue arrows) such as the polyol pathway,
  pentose phosphate pathway, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, mannose and galactosamine
  synthetic pathways and one carbon metabolism pathways, products of which have been
  linked to the activation of signaling pathways that may contribute to left ventricular
  modelling. Regulatory steps in glycolysis that have been implicated in heart failure
  include phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PKM1), the mitochondrial pyruvate
  carrier (MPC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). (Illustration credit: Ben Smith).'
