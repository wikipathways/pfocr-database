caption: The role of liver macrophages in liver fibrosis repair. Apart from KCs, MoMφs
  play a crucial regulatory role in liver inflammation and fibrosis. When the liver
  suffers from external damage, a substantial influx of peripheral monocytes can be
  recruited to the liver and subsequently differentiate into mature Ly-6Chi subgroup
  macrophages. These Ly-6Chi subgroup macrophages exhibit pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic
  characteristics. In the stage of liver injury repair, Ly-6Chi subgroup macrophages
  can be transformed into Ly-6Clo subgroup macrophages by activating STAT3/IL-10/IL-6
  signaling pathway, and then engulfing hepatocyte fragments. Ly-6Clo subgroup macrophages
  can promote ECM degradation by secreting MMP9, MMP12, and MMP13. Ly-6Clo subgroup
  macrophages can also induce the apoptosis of activated HSCs by expressing TRAIL,
  thus inhibiting the formation of liver collagen and accelerating the repair process
  of liver fibrosis
