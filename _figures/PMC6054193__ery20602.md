caption: Genes encoding enzymes of the SL biosynthetic pathway are differentially
  regulated in roots of CS/RGM in response to N availability. Transcript levels are
  presented as heatmaps of mean values of reads per kilobase per million mapped reads
  (RPKM; RNA-seq) or normalized values (RT–qPCR) for each condition as described in
  the map (top right). For each gene, data were transformed to range from 0 (blue,
  minimum value) to 1 (red, maximum value). RPKM values were obtained from RNA-seq
  data in . Mean values of normalized expression obtained using RT–qPCR are presented
  for putative CCD7, CCD8, and MAX1 genes, n=3 individual plants. LN0, roots at 0
  hpt (grown with LN nutrient solution); LN3 and LN24, roots from the side with LN
  solution harvested at 3 and 24 hpt, respectively (after the addition of HN solution
  to the other side); HN3 and HN24, roots harvested at 3 and 24 hpt on the side to
  which HN was added. CCD7, CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 7 (9-CIS-BETA-CAROTENE
  9ʹ,10ʹ-CLEAVING DIOXYGENASE); CCD8, CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 8 (ALL-TRANS-10ʹ-APO-BETA-CAROTENAL
  13,14-CLEAVING DIOXYGENASE); Crt-ISO, PROLYCOPENE ISOMERASE; PSY, PHYTOENE SYNTHASE;
  D27, DWARF27 (BETA-CAROTENE ISOMERASE); LBO, LATERAL BRANCHING OXIDOREDUCTASE; LCY-β,
  LYCOPENE BETA-CYCLASE; MAX1, MORE AXILLARY BRANCHES 1 (CYP711A1); PDR1, PLEIOTROPIC
  DRUG RESISTANCE 1; PDS, PHYTOENE DESATURASE; ZDS, ZETA-CAROTENE DESATURASE; Z-ISO,
  ZETA-CAROTENE ISOMERASE.
