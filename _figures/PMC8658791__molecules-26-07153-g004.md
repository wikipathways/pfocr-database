caption: Integrative model of crosstalk between metabolism and resistance to quinolones.
  Metabolites, such as sugars and amino acids energize antibiotics efflux pumps through
  increasing proton motive force. In a different manner, these metabolites produce
  genomic effects, such as increasing inner membrane permeases, porins and metabolic
  pathway components that in turn may modulate the resistance to quinolones. Besides
  antimicrobial effects and expression of genes involved in quinolones resistance
  itself, quinolones may increase the expression of genes involved in resistance to
  other biocides. Figures were drawn from scratch using Freehands 10 (Macromedia,
  San Francisco, CA, USA).
