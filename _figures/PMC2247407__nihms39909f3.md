caption: The Wnt-Frizzled signaling pathway regulates PS exposure and apoptosis. The
  Wnt protein binds to its Frizzled receptors resulting in the activation of Dishevelled
  followed by the inhibition of GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase), Axin and APC (adenomatous
  polyposis coli) tumor suppressor protein complex. The suppressed GSK-3β, Axin and
  APC complex prevents phosphorylation (p) of β-catenin and leads to the accumulation
  of β-catenin. β-catenin enters into cellular nucleus and contributes to the formation
  of Lef/Tcf (lymphocyte enhancer factor/T cell factor) and β-catenin complex that
  may cooperate with factors activated by other signaling pathways resulting in cellular
  proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis through the induction of
  target nuclear gene transcription. In addition, the binding of Wnt to Frizzled receptors
  also can directly activate Akt that prevents the activity of GSK-3β and blocks Mito
  (mitochondrial) Cyto (cytochrome) c release. The inhibition of Cyto c release from
  Mito leads to the reduction of caspase activity followed by the decrease of DNA
  fragmentation and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure resulting in the prevention of
  apoptosis.
