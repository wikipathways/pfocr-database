caption: 'The canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signalling pathways. Simplified diagrams
  of NF-κB signaling, (left): Stimulation of TOLL-like receptors (TLRs), infection
  or ligand binding (e.g., TNF) to cell surface receptors (e.g., TNF-R1) trigger c-REL,
  NF-κB1 (p105/p50) or p65/RelA and activation of the inhibitory IKK (IκB kinase)
  complex. This complex is recruited to adaptor proteins (TRAFs or RIP kinases (dashed
  arrows)), activating the IKK complex, resulting in phosphorylation of Iκ proteins,
  priming them for ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. NF-κB dimers (NF-κB1
  (p50) and c-Rel pairing with RelA/p65) enter the nucleus and bind to target gene
  κB sites. The non-canonical NF-κB pathway, (right); is activated by members of the
  TNF-R family (e.g., LTβR, BAFFR, CD40, RANK) by NIK mediated activation of an IKK
  kinase complex which in turn phosphorylates p100-NF-κB2 leading to its limited proteolysis
  to produce the p52 form of NF-κB2. Entry of p52-NF-κB2/RELB heterodimers into the
  nucleus follows, regulating target gene expression. AgR (antigen receptor), LTβR
  (lymphotoxin β receptor), BAFF/R (B cell activating factor), RANK (receptor activator
  for NF-κB).'
