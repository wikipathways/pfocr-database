caption: Simplified demonstration of decarboxylation events with associated position-specific
  isotopomers used in this study. Locations of decarboxylation events in central carbon
  pathways (A), and the associated C position in the 13C-labeled compounds used in
  these experiments (B). C1 from glucose is lost as CO2 in the pentose phosphate pathway
  with the synthesis of ribulose 5-phosphate by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase or
  after multiple rounds in the TCA cycle. C1 from pyruvate is lost as CO2 in the formation
  of acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase. C2 and C3 of pyruvate are lost in multiple
  cycles of the TCA cycle. C1 from acetate is lost as CO2 in the 2nd cycle of the
  TCA cycle, while half of C2 is lost in each subsequent cycle. All CO2 producing
  reactions can produce 13CO2 from uniformly labeled 13C glucose. This example assumes
  a glycolytic flux through the central carbon pathways. TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
