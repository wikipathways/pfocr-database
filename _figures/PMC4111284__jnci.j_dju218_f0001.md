caption: IGF signaling pathway. Genes included in this analysis were SST, SSTR1-5,
  GHRH, GHRHR, GHR, IGF1, IGF1R, IGFBP1-6, IGF2-AS, IGF2R, IGFALS, INSR, IRS1, IRS2
  (shown in ) and POU1F1, GNRH1, and GNRHR (not shown); the insulin receptor is encoded
  by a single gene, INSR, from which alternate splicing during transcription results
  in either IRA or IRB isoforms; the insulin gene (INS) was not genotyped, and genes
  in PI3k/Akt/mTOR and Ras-MAPK pathway were not included in this analysis.
