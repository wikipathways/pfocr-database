caption: Proposed model of the direct and indirect effects of CTRP2 deficiency on
  adipose tissue and liver. CTRP2 deficiency stimulates lipolysis in adipose tissue
  by both activating PKA signaling pathway and up-regulating lipolytic enzymes (ATGL,
  HSL, MGL) expression. It also promotes TG secretion from liver by increasing phospholipid
  synthesis, enhancing VLDL assembly and secretion. Although the direct effects of
  CTRP2 on adipose tissue and adipocytes have been noted, the direct action of CTRP2
  on liver still remains to be demonstrated. β3-AR, beta-3 adrenergic receptor; AC,
  adenylyl cyclase; DAG, diacylglycerol; MAG, monoacylglycerol.
