caption: Schematic model for the chemokine responses of microglia to RV infection.
  The model is based on the data in the present study and previous publications (see
  the text for the appropriate references). RV infection of microglia is initiated
  by the uptake of virions into endosomal-lysosomal compartments. Although microglia
  allows RV uncoating and expression of virus-encoded proteins, the replication of
  the viral genome and the production of virus progenies are impaired. RV infection
  of microglia leads to the activation of cellular signaling pathways mediated by
  MAPKs and IκB-NF-κB, and this process is triggered at the stage after viral gene
  expression. NF-κB signaling, which is additively augmented by p38 activation, is
  crucial for the expression of CXCL10 and CCL5 in the RV-infected microglia. The
  ERK1/2 pathway also participates in the induction of CXCL10 expression, while it
  acts as a down-regulator of the excessive production of CCL5 upon RV infection.
