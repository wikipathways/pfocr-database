caption: Model for methionine recycling pathways in K. aerogenes. The formal cysteine-biosynthetic
  pathway is shown in green, with genes identified in Klebsiella noted. Similarly,
  the methionine-biosynthetic pathway is shown in blue. The inferred pathway of homocysteine
  recycling via the transsulfurylation pathway is shown in red, and a possible pathway
  for methionine recycling via methanethiol is shown in magenta; both these pathways
  await rigorous biochemical confirmation. Regulatory interactions inferred from studies
  of E. coli and S. enterica are shown in gray, and regulatory interactions inferred
  from this work are shown in yellow. Ellipses, regulatory proteins. Arrows with open
  heads direct compounds serving as effectors to their cognate proteins. Dotted lines,
  proteins, steps, and interactions without experimental evidence for Klebsiella.
  SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; CoA, coenzyme A.
