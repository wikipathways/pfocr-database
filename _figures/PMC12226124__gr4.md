caption: Association of the inflammasome cascade with AD immunopathology. Components
  of the inflammasome signaling pathway are increased in the skin of AD patients.
  In the skin of patients, inflammasome receptors can be activated by exposure to
  ultraviolet radiation, by contact with S. aureus antigens, and by possible DNA molecules
  released by cell damage. These receptors promote the oligomerization of ASC and
  caspase-1, leading to the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18, which are also elevated
  in AD patients. In addition, activation of the inflammasome leads to an increase
  in GSDM-D and promotion of pyroptosis. The release of pro-inflammatory and cell
  death cytokines contributes to tissue damage and local and systemic inflammation
  during the disease. UVB, ultraviolet radiation; S. aureus, Staphylococcus aureus;
  dsDNA, double stranded DNA. Figure generated with BioRender
