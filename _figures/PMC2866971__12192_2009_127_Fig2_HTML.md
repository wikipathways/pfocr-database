caption: Proposed mechanism of HSPB6-induced smooth muscle relaxation. Activation
  of adenylate cyclase (AC) by prostaglandin (PG), forskolin (FSK), or isoproterenol
  (ISO) increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Activation
  of guanylate cyclase (GC) by nitric oxide (NO), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), or natriuretic
  peptides leads to increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Cyclic
  AMP and GMP can be degraded by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Increased cAMP and cGMP
  levels activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cGMP-dependent protein kinase
  (PK), respectively. HSPB6 is phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent or cAMP-dependent
  protein kinase on serine 16 (pHSPB6). Phosphorylation of HSPB6 on serine 16 is associated
  with vasorelaxation. The HSPB6 phosphopeptide (YARAAARQARAWLRRApSAPLPGLK) treatment
  of precontracted isolated smooth muscle tissue circumvents the cyclic nucleotide
  signaling pathway by first directly crossing the cell membrane (1). Endogenous phosphorylated
  HSPB6 or the HSPB6 phosphopeptide displaces phosphocofilin from a complex with 14-3-3
  forming phospho-HSPB6-14-3-3 complex (2). The displaced phosphocofilin is dephosphorylated
  by phosphatases such as slingshot or chronophin (3). Dephosphorylated cofilin induces
  actin depolymerization resulting in stress fiber disruption in smooth muscle cells
  and induces relaxation in smooth muscle (4)
