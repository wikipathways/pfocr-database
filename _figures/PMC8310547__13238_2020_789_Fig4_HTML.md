caption: 'SLC7A11 regulates glucose and glutamine dependencies in cancer cells. (A)
  SLC7A11 functions to import extracellular cystine in exchange for intracellular
  glutamate. Extracellular glutamine is imported into the cell and converted to glutamate
  by Glutaminase. Subsequently, glutamate serves to fuel the TCA cycle via its conversion
  to α-ketoglutarate and acts as a precursor for GSH synthesis. The other arm of SLC7A11
  transporter function imports extracellular cystine. Once imported into the cell,
  cystine is reduced to cysteine by the consumption of NADPH. Cysteine then serves
  as the rate limiting precursor for GSH synthesis, and GSH suppresses ROS. NADPH
  is mainly supplied from glucose via the PPP. Consequently, an imbalance in this
  metabolic network leads to specific metabolic dependencies in SLC7A11highcancer
  cells. (B and C) Glutamine dependency: In SLC7A11highcancer cells, increased glutamate
  export results in a partial depletion of intracellular glutamate that can feed into
  the TCA cycle. This pushes SLC7A11highcancer cells to uptake more glutamine and
  activates glutaminase to promote glutamine conversion to glutamate, resulting in
  glutamine dependency (B). When SLC7A11highcancer cells (with increased glutamate
  export) are challenged with low glutamine availability, intracellular glutamate
  is inadequate to fuel the TCA cycle, resulting in anaplesrosis defect and cell growth
  arrest (C). (D and E) Glucose dependency: In SLC7A11highcancer cells, large amount
  of extracellular cystine is imported into the cell. Due to its low solubility, buildup
  of intracellular cystine is likely toxic, forcing cells to quickly reducing cystine
  to much more soluble cysteine in the cytosol. Because this reaction requires NADPH
  and cytosolic NADPH is mainly supplied from glucose via the PPP, SLC7A11highcancer
