caption: 'Overview of glucose and fatty acids metabolism in a healthy heart: The glucose
  transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4 are responsible for glucose uptake into the cardiomyocyte.
  Once inside the cell, glucose is then phosphorylated to Glucose-6-P. Glucose-6-P
  is the common intermediate for HMP, HBP, or pyruvate through glycolysis. Pyruvate
  is then interred to the mitochondria, where it is decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA.
  Fatty acid transporters (FAT/CD36) transfer non-esterified fatty acids into the
  cell. Fatty acyl-CoA is formed by intracellular fatty acid activator enzymes and
  can either be esterified into TAG or reach the mitochondria. Fatty acyl-CoA from
  mitochondria enters the β-oxidation pathway, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA.
  Glucose or fatty acid-derived acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle, where it undergoes
  ETC, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP formation.'
