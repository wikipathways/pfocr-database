  description: Involvement of sirtuins in lifespan/healthspan elongation pathways.
    Sirtuins modulate multiple pathways involved in mediating positive effects of
    some anti-ageing interventions, such as calorie/diet restriction (CR/DR) or exercise.
    Such effect can also be mimicked by sirtuin activating compounds (STACs). Prolonged
    activation of IGF1 pathway, involving PI3K-AKT, leads to phosphorylation and inhibition
    of FOXO and to inhibition of SIRT1 activity resulting in increased level of acetylated
    p53. Acetylation stabilizes p53, increases its activity and leads to premature
    cell senescence. Sirtuins contribute to life extension in animals with overactivated
    insulin/IGF1 signaling by increasing FOXO activity. Furthermore, sirtuins activate
    LKB1/AMPK pathway by deacetylating LKB1. AMPK downregulates mTOR/S6K activity
    preventing onset of senescence in cell cycle arrested cells. Moreover, AMPK can
    increase NAMPT activity, the enzyme indispensable in a salvage pathway, leading
    to NAD+ upregulation, which promotes sirtuin activity. Arrows indicate positive
    regulation. Lines with T-shaped ending indicate inhibition. Targets of lifespan/healthspan
