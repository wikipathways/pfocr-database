caption: Data flow diagram illustrating the relationship between the operational data
  store (ODS, in bold), the pathway and analysis engine, the carcinoma of the prostate
  visualization and interpretation system (CaP VIS), and other interactions including
  lookup databases (DB) for International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and OPCS
  (Office of Population Censuses and Surveys) coding. The two main processes that
  feed information into the CaP VIS system are enumerated. The pathways data follows
  steps 1a to 5a, while other information follows steps 1b to 3b. Secondary processes
  are highlighted with dotted lines.
