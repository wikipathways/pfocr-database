caption: 'Mechanisms of ncRNAs contributing to CRC cell radiosensitivity. Radiation
  induces several types of DNA damage, and double-strand breaks (DSBs) are lethal.
  DNA damage activates the DNA damage repair pathway and the homologous recombination
  (HR) and the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) are the most classic mechanisms for
  DSB repair. DNA damage repair results in two pathways: apoptosis and DNA repair,
  which lead to radiosensitivity or radioresistance. LncRNAs and circRNAs downregulate
  the expression levels of miRNA-targeted mRNAs by sponging their targeted miRNAs.
  mRNAs can directly regulate the DNA damage repair and indirectly modulate repair
  mechanisms through several onco-signaling pathways, such as Wnt/β-catenin, epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT), and DNA damage response. Taken together, the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA
  and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction networks modulate the radiosensitivity of CRC
  cells by regulating DNA damage repair pathways.'
