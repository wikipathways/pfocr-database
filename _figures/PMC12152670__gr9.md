caption: The effect of N-GlcNAc2 on protein secondary structure(A) Amino acid sequence
  of amino-Im7 shows helices I–IV and 7 glycosylation sites.(B) On the left is the
  structure of chitobiose-ASN, and on the right is the Band diagram of Im7, showing
  positions 29 and 59 that mutate to cysteine, thus enabling a linking strategy for
  the introduction of glycosyl ASN. The native Im7 residues on each selected glycosylation
  are also shown in the space fill plot (black).(C) On the left is the chemical structure
  and sequence of glycopeptide, and on the right is the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  and O-GlcNAc glycosylation
