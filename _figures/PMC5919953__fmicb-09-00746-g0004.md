caption: 'Nitrogen and sulfur metabolic pathways identified in the six Microcystis-epibiont
  communities. (A) Nitrogen metabolism; (B) Sulfur metabolism. Diagrams are based
  on KEGG pathway maps. Available enzyme classification numbers for each step are
  included in boxes. Each column represents a different community. DA, TA, DF, TF,
  DW, and TW are the abbreviations for the six Microcystis-epibiont communities. Box
  colors indicate bacteria from different classes: dark green, Cyanobacteria (Microcystis);
  pink, Alphaproteobacteria; gold, Betaproteobacteria; light green, Gammaproteobacteria;
  and blue, other phyla such as Bacteroidetes or Gemmatimonadetes. Gray indicates
  absence of the corresponding enzyme from the community.'
