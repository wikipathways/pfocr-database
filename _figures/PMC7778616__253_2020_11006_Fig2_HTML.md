caption: The melleolide I biosynthesis pathway. The pathway begins with the cyclization
  of farnesyl diphosphate to 6-protoilludene (Engels et al. ) and then oxygenation
  catalyzed by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. The final step is the attachment of
  an orsellinic acid, produced, and transferred by the polyketide synthase ArmB (Lackner
  et al. ). Subsequent chlorination of the side chain is carried out by halogenases
  ArmH1–ArmH5 (Wick et al. ). In contrast to the main metabolite melleolide I, the
  structures of armillyl orsellinate and armillane (Bohnert et al. ) differ in the
  presence/absence or position of the double bond in the six-ring system and the number
  and position of hydroxyl groups
