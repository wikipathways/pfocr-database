caption: PD-1 and PD-L1 interactions and mechanism of T cell inhibition. (A) PD-1
  ligation to PD-L1 leads to recruitment of SHP2 by its intracellular signaling motif,
  ITSM. SHP2 exerts its inhibitory action on proximal signaling molecules of T cell
  receptor (TCR) such as LCK, ZAP70 resulting PI3K pathway inhibition. PI3K pathway
  is also inhibited through PTEN by inhibiting CK2. PLC-γ1 and PKCθ are also inhibited
  results in RAS pathway inhibition, decrease production of IL-2, and reduce expression
  of several transcription factors such NFAT, NFκB, and AP-1. (B) PD-1 also up-regulate
  Cbl-b and transcription factor BATF.  (C) The outcome is inhibition of two main
  signaling pathways PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RAS-MEK-ERK which results in decreased cell
  division, growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. (D) Inhibition of
  these pathways also lead in altered T cell metabolism with increased inhibition
  of glycolysis, mitochondrial and amino acid metabolism, and increased fatty acid
  oxidation. (E) Reverse signaling through PD-L1 can also occur in tumor cells and
  antigen presenting cells (APCs) resulting in PI3K pathway up-regulation and enhanced
  glycolysis in cancers, and increased IL-10 production in DCs.
