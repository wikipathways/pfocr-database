caption: Force-induced E-cadherin signaling for increased metabolism. In response
  to external forces, E-cadherin stimulates AMPK via its upstream activator, LKB1,
  both of which are activated and recruited to the E-cadherin adhesion complex. Increased
  AMPK signaling has two effects. It acts on a series of kinases to increase phosphorylation
  of vinculin at Y822; this triggers activation of the RhoA–ROCK–MLCK–MLC pathway,
  culminating in reinforcement of the actin cytoskeleton. AMPK also signals for increased
  glucose uptake and its conversion into ATP. The ATP produced provides the energy
  to polymerize new actin filaments in order to reinforce the actin cytoskeleton.
  ROCK, Rho-associated protein kinase; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; MLC, myosin
  light chain.
