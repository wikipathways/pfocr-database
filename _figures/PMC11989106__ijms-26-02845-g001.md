caption: 'Overview of mTOR signaling pathway: The mTOR signaling network consists
  of two branches, each mediated by a specific complex, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The GATOR1
  complex inhibits rapamycin-sensitive mTOR by acting as a GTPase-activating protein
  for Rag GTPase and, therefore, inhibits mTORC1 by converting the active GTP-bound
  Rag proteins to inactive GDP-bound forms. GATOR2 is a positive regulator of mTORC1
  by inhibiting GATOR1 [15]. Once mTORC1 is activated, it leads to the phosphorylation
  of LARP1, S6Ks, and 4E-BP, promoting translation [86,87]. Activated mTORC1 also
  leads to the activation of transcription factors and nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling
  of the complex, leading to the upregulation of genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis,
  lipid biosynthesis, ribosomal biosynthesis, hypoxia, and others [27,86]. Conversely,
  activated mTORC2 regulates cell survival, metabolism, and cytoskeletal dynamics
  by directly phosphorylating AKT (protein kinase B) and others [27,88]. The energy-sensing
  PI3K-PTEN-AKT-TSC pathway also activates AKT and is a positive regulator of mTORC1
  by inhibiting the TSC1/2 (Tuberous Sclerosis) complex [88]. The TSC complex inhibits
  mTORC1 by serving as a GTPase-activating protein for the Ras homolog Rheb, a small
  GTPase. Rheb contributes to the activation of mTORC1 by promoting lysosomal surface
  translocation [16]. Solid lines indicate a direct interaction, and dotted lines
  indicate an indirect interaction, either from an unknown mechanism or other effectors'
