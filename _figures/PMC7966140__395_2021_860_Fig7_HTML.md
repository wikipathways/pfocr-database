caption: Schematic representation of the NOS-dependent NO transient and its effect
  on the Ca2+ transient. In normal cardiomyocytes (left side; WT) in which dystrophin
  is present, nNOS and iNOS are responsible for diastolic NO production, and nNOS
  is responsible for the systolic NO transient. The NO transient is produced after
  membrane depolarization (red), and it exerts its effect by reducing the next Ca2+
  transient via the sGC-PKG signaling pathway. In dystrophic cardiomyocytes (right
  side; mdx), the absence of dystrophin reduces the expression and activity of nNOS
  and enhances iNOS, thus regulating diastolic NO production. During systole, iNOS
  and eNOS are responsible for the NO transient modification of the next Ca2+ transient
  via SNO modifications
