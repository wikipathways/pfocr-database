caption: 'The mechanism of HO-1 in ovarian cancer. In OC cells, the combination of
  VEGF and VEGFR, plus the abnormal activation of MAPK and PI3K/ AKT signaling pathways
  can cause Nrf2 to dissociate from the Nrf2-Keap1 complex and increase the translocation
  of nucleus. Within the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to ARE, activating the transcription
  of its downstream gene HO-1. High levels of LC3-I, vimentin, Zeb1 and Bcl-2 can
  be observed in OC cells, while the level of LC3-II, keratin, Bax decrease. Therefore,
  up-regulating of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway inhibits ROS-dependent apoptosis and autophagy
  in OC cells, increasing tumor microvessel density and promoting the growth and metastasis
  of OC. EMT also participate in this process collaboratively. OC: ovarian cancer;
  VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR: VEGF receptor; Nrf2: nuclear factor
  E2-related factor 2; Keap1: kelch-like ECH-related protein 1; ARE: antioxidant-responsive
  element; LC3: light chain3; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition.'
