caption: Ribosomal/TRP53 pathway pattern mediated by Salmonella infection. Following
  the intracellular invasion of Salmonella, the bacterium secretes proteins that inhibit
  the transcription of RPL39 and RPL9, and then increases the accumulation of TRP53.
  TRP53 acts on the FAS/CASP6 sub-pathway and promotes apoptosis. TRP53 can also modulate
  the GADD45A sub-network and causes cell cycle arrest. Besides RPL39 and RPL9, three
  genes (ABL1, F2, and PTEN) which promote TRP53 activity, and four genes (AKT1, SDCBP,
  PSEN1, and TNFRSF8) which inhibit TRP53 activity were differentially expressed in
  neutrophils infected with Salmonella. The regulatoryrelationships shown in this
  figure were either discovered in this study or curated from gene expression regulation
  relationships deposited in GEREDB database [].
