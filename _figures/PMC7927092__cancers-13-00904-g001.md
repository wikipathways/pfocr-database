caption: An overview of the major metabolic pathways including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle, fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation,
  and the pentose phosphate pathway and their interactions. α-KG—alpha-ketoglutarate;
  FAO—fatty acid oxidation; GLUT—glucose transporter; LDH—lactate dehydrogenase; MCT—monocarboxylate
  transporter; PPP—pentose phosphate pathway; SLC27—Solute carrier family 27; TCA—tricarboxylic
  acid.
