caption: 'Adhesin RadD: the secret weapon of Fusobacterium nucleatum. (a) Fusobacterium
  nucleatum promotes colorectal cancer development through several adhesin. FadA binds
  to E-cadherin; Fap2 binds to gal-GalNAc of tumor cells and TIGIT inhibitory receptors
  on the surface of T cells and NK cells to initiate immune evasion; Zhang et al.
  found that RadD could bind to CD147 receptor. (b) Zhang et al. successfully screened
  for a novel adhesin of Fusobacterium nucleatum, RadD, based on the mariner-based
  transposon libraries. RadD could bind to CD147 and activate the downstream PI3K-AKT-NF-κB-MMP9
  signaling pathway to promote colorectal cancer proliferation. (c) in the future,
  material-modified nanovaccine, probiotic-derived bacteriocins, specific phages,
  and clinical drugs can be used to target the elimination of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
  Abbreviations: TIGIT, T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain; NK cells, natural killer
  cells; WT, wild type; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases. Figure was created with BioRender.com'
