caption: '(A) MMR dysfunction may sensitize tumors to various therapies via different
  mechanisms; some of these are well established and applied in the clinic (immunotherapy),
  while others are proposed based on known molecular mechanisms and/or studies on
  experimental models, however awaiting clinical validation (in panel A). A common
  consequence of MMR failures are indel mutations at MS repeats, which can be in coding
  regions and so generate frameshifted, and usually truncated, mutant proteins (note
  that some indels at repeats also in introns can induce misplicing, consequently
  again resulting in frameshifting and truncation of coding regions). Expression of
  such truncated proteins is often silenced by the NMD surveillance pathway that degrades
  mutant mRNA. However some frameshifted mRNAs can escape NMD detection and generate
  neoantigens that sensitize to immunotherapy, or that generate toxic proteins (e.g.
  HSP110 mutant), suggesting that beneficial effects of therapy might be potentiated
  by NMD inhibition. Frameshifting indels also can cause LOF in DNA repair proteins
  e.g. MRE11 and RAD50, sensitizing to irinotecan and potentially to DNA damage-signaling
  drugs e.g. ATR inhibitors. Finally, expansions at repeats due to MMR failure increase
  reliance on the WRN DNA helicase. (B) MMR inactivation causes resistance to some
  commonly used cancer drugs, which can trigger MMR activity—either by methylation
  of nucleobases [TMZ, dacarbazine], or by incorporation of chemically modified nucleotides
  [6-TG, 5-FU] that can register as mismatches—potentially resulting in apoptosis
  via DNA damage signalling. A dysfunctional MMR results in reduced clinical utility
  of such drugs, as well as in increased mutation rates in the MMR-deficient tumor
  upon treatment, which can generate further mutations in cancer driver genes or in
  drug resistance genes. Abbreviations: 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; 6-TG, 6-thioguanine.'
