caption: Localization of the key Plasmodium cyclic nucleotide signalling components
  in a merozoite prior to egress. A schematic showing the key cyclic nucleotide signalling
  players in a merozoite within a P. falciparum blood stage schizont. Some of the
  depicted cellular locations of pathway components are speculative (such as PDEα,
  PDEβ and GCα). Evidence suggests that a subpopulation of PKG is localized in the
  ER membrane, but the means of attachment is unknown. A rhoptry localization is depicted
  for ACβ based on data obtained from Toxoplasma gondii, where the location of the
  ACβ orthologue in the rhoptries is known to be dependent on the presence of ARO
  []. PKA is depicted as being rhoptry localized based on P. falciparum epitope tagging
  studies []. Also speculative is the existence of an (as yet) unidentified IP3-gated
  calcium channel (IP3R) for which there is pharmacological evidence.
