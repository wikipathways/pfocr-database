caption: 'PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. PI3K is activated by growth factor stimulation
  through RTK. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, binds directly to phosphotyrosine
  residues on RTK and/or adaptors, such as the IRS-1. This binding relieves the intermolecular
  inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K by p85 and allows it to move toward
  PI3K to the plasma membrane where its substrate, PIP2, resides. The catalytic subunit
  can also be activated by activated RAS, which binds directly to p110, and by G protein-coupled
  receptors. PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to produce PIP3. In addition, the tumor suppressor
  PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3 to PIP2, thereby regulating PI3K-dependent signaling
  in a negative manner. Following PIP3 formation, PDK1 and AKT bind to PIP3 through
  its pleckstrin homology domains into close proximity at the cell plasma membrane.
  PDK1 activates AKT by phosphorylating AKT at threonine 308. After phosphorylation,
  AKT is fully activated by the subsequent phosphorylation at serine 473 by several
  protein kinases such as PDK1, the complex mTORC2, or AKT itself. AKT phosphorylates
  TSC2, thereby inhibiting the GTPase activity of the TSC1-TSC2 dimer, and the GTP-binding
  protein RHEB remains in its active GTP-bound state, causing a rise in mTORC1. In
  the mTORC1 complex, mTOR phosphorylates p70S6K and 4E-BP1, leading to an increase
  in the translation and synthesis of cell cycle-regulating and ribosomal proteins.
  Activated p70S6K also participates in a negative feedback loop, reducing the activation
  of the PI3K pathway through the phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of ISR-1.
