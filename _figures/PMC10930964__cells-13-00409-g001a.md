caption: '(A). Figure depicting the mTOR structure, consisting of 2549 amino acids,
  which has several domains essential for the activity of mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1
  has several binding partners, including Raptor and PRAS40, while mTORC2 has Rictor,
  Sin1, and Protor1/2. In addition, the figure shows FKBP12, a rapamycin-binding partner.
  See text for additional details. (B). Illustration of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling
  pathway. Activated PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  to form PIP3. PIP3 binds to PDK1/AKT via the PH-domains to mediate Akt phosphorylation,
  which is further facilitated by the activation of mTORC2. Activated Akt promotes
  both the phosphorylation of PRAS40 on Thr246 and the inhibition of TSC1/TSC2 complex
  activity, resulting in increased GTP-bound Rheb levels and mTORC1 activation. Activated
  mTORC1 then acts on multiple protein substrates, including 4E-BP1, S6K, and PRAS40.
  The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K by activated mTORC1 regulates multiple functions,
  including mRNA translation, cellular growth, and proliferation. Furthermore, S6K
  provides negative feedback to inhibit the insulin-signaling pathway via IRS, which
  is disinhibited along with subsequent mitogenic pathways following the prolonged
  inhibition of mTORC1 (dotted line). Representative inhibitors: rapamycin and rapalogues;
  ATP binding inhibitors; Akt, PI3K, and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are presented (for
  details, see Table 1 and text)'
