caption: Mechanism diagram about how ADAM8 contribute to alcoholic liver fibrosis
  (ALF). Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the activation of hepatic stellate cells
  (HSCs), transitioning them from a quiescent state to an active state. In their active
  state, these HSCs begin producing pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic cytokines,
  including IL-1, TGFβ1, PDGF, and TNF-α. ADAM8 expression is upregulated in response
  to these inflammatory signals, which subsequently activates the MAPK signaling pathway,
  including the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. This signaling cascade
  promotes further activation and proliferation of HSCs, which accelerates the fibrogenic
  process and contributes to the development of alcoholic liver fibrosis
