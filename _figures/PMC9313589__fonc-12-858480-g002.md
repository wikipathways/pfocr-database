caption: System    dependence in cancer cells. Under physiological conditions, the
  nonessential amino acid cysteine ​​is present as cystine due to the extracellular
  oxidative environment. To maintain a stable intracellular cysteine ​​level, the
  presence of the cystine/glutamate antiporter (system   ) is necessary. Interestingly,
  genetic deletion of system    does not produce any damage in animals, suggesting
  that normal cells do not depend on this antiporter to maintain the intracellular
  cysteine ​​level. In line with this idea, compensatory mechanisms, such as the transsulfuration
  pathway, may exist for the recovery of the intracellular cysteine level (A). Conversely,
  it has been widely described that tumor cells have a high dependence on system    for
  the cellular uptake of cysteine ​​ (B). Pharmacological inhibition of this antiporter
  results in the depletion of intracellular cysteine, inducing an abrupt decrease
  in the GSH level, which ultimately triggers inactivation of GPX4, the main hydroperoxidase
  in the cell. Inactivation of GPX4 due to inhibition of system    results in an overwhelming
  overload of lipid ROS that ultimately induces tumor death by ferroptosis (B). Interestingly,
  it has been determined that inhibition of system    can induce tumor death both
  in vitro and in vivo, identifying this antiporter as a potential therapeutic target
  for cancer.
