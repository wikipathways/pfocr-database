caption: The role of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in inflammation-induced tumor angiogenesis.
  The p38 MAPK signaling is activated by several extracellular stimuli. Inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL-1, IL-6, etc.) activate p38 MAPK, which then phosphorylates
  downstream targets AP-1 and NF-κB, thereby upregulating the expression of MMPs,
  IL-8 and VEGF. This is because the promoter regions of angiogenic genes contain
  binding sites for AP-1 and NF-κB. Under conditions where endothelial cells are heavily
  exposed to ROS, endothelial cells overexpress HIF-1 and VEGF in a p38 MAPK-dependent
  manner. VEGF and ROS produced by inflammatory cells increase the activity of p38
  MAPK which phosphorylates HSP27. Activated HSP27 reorganizes actin and regulates
  the motility and migration of endothelial cells.
