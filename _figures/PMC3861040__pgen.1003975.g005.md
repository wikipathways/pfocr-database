caption: FGF23 is an endocrine ligand that in the parathyroid glands either binds
  to an FGF-receptor and membrane-bound Klotho, to elicit activation of the MAPK-pathway,
  or acts via a calcineurin-dependent signaling pathway. Both pathways induce a rapid
  inhibition of PTH secretion within 15 minutes. The MAPK-pathway is likely the dominant
  pathway in physiology, although their relative contributions are unknown. In addition
  to mediating MAPK-dependent FGF23 signaling, Klotho may play an intrinsic role in
  modulating parathyroid transcriptional activity for sustained demands and long-term
  parathyroid function. Speculatively, the clinical use of calcineurin inhibitors
  (CNi) that block calcineurin signaling may increase the susceptibility to develop,
  or aggravate pre-existing, hyperparathyroidism in patients with reduced Klotho level
  such as in chronic kidney disease and primary hyperparathyroidism.
