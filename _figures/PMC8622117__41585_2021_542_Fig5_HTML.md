caption: A systematic approach is essential to guide research. To understand possible
  effects on male fertility, the first step is to determine viral presence in the
  testes or semen, using human cohort and post-mortem studies alongside in vivo animal
  models. In clinical studies, patient cohorts should be divided primarily by their
  age and disease status. If viral entry is observed, a mechanism for viral entry
  and possible effects on male fertility and testicular function can then be investigated.
  If viral entry is not observed, this does not rule out an effect on testicular function,
  which will still require investigation, owing to concerns raised by clinical data
  and viral involvement in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system pathway, which
  could have indirect effects on fertility.
