caption: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) glycoprotein binding to cognate receptors controls
  viral signaling, trafficking and the key cellular functions required for productive
  infection of monocytes. The HCMV glycoproteins bind several cellular receptors,
  including EGFR and the β1- and β3-integrins. Following binding, these receptor engagements
  trigger a variety of signal transduction pathways in the infected monocyte. For
  example, gB binding to EGFR results in activation of the intrinsic EGFR tyrosine
  kinase and down stream signaling that is required for entry, for the unique multi-vesicular
  nuclear translocation process seen in monocytes, as well as for motility, and the
  survival of the monocytes and their differentiation into macrophages. The engagement
  of the pentameric complex, gH/gL/UL128-131 with β1- and β3-integrins on the surface
  of monocytes activates c-Src to drive the required signaling pathways needed for
  entry, nuclear translocation, motility, survival and differentiation. More specifically,
  this downstream signaling following EGFR and integrin engagement acts in concert
  to activate numerous down stream signaling pathways, including the NF-κB pathway,
  PI(3)K, and the MAPK pathway, which culminates in enhanced transactivation of many
  host cell promoters via increases in transcriptional regulators, altercations in
  actin regulatory proteins that modulate motility (such as N-WASP and paxillin) and
  changes in Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 to promote survival of short-lived monocytes.
