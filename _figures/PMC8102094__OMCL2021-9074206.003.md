caption: A schematic model describing the roles of various stress signalling pathways
  in the regulation of ferroptosis; p53 exhibits a dual regulatory roles in the control
  of ferroptosis. p53 increases ferroptosis either by inhibiting SLC7A11 expression
  or by activating SAT1 and GLS2 expression. p53-mediated inhibition of ferroptosis
  is mediated either by inhibiting DPP4 activity or inducing CDKN1A/p21 expression.
  ATM-mediated resistance to ferroptosis is induced by ATM inactivation. Upon ATM
  inactivation, the nuclear import of MTF1 protein is increased which transcriptionally
  activates the expression of ferroportin (FPN1) and ferritin (FTH1 and FTL) which
  leads to the presence of low-labile iron in the cell. Activation of the p62-Keap1-
  (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-) Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2) pathway also regulates ferroptosis. Nrf2 plays the central regulatory
  role in the regulation of antioxidant molecules (HO1, NQO1) thus conferring protective
  against environmental or intracellular stresses. Nrf2 also controls the synthesis
  of GSH production which comprises an integral component of ferroptosis machinery.
  AMPK-mediated energy stress signalling pathway also has diverse roles in regulating
  ferroptosis. AMPK can either function by inhibiting major biosynthetic pathways
  (such as protein or fatty acid biosynthesis) or in association with Beclin-1 which
  is a key regulator of autophagy. BECN1 promotes ferroptosis by binding to SLC7A11
  and thus blocking the system xc− activity.
