caption: 'Comparison of gene networks affected by ozone exposure in males and females.
  A: Venn diagram showing genes with significant changes in expression in response
  to ozone exposure in lungs of male and female mice. The intersection shows genes
  affected in both sexes in response to ozone (green = downregulated, red = upregulated).
  Genes with significant differences in expression (P < 0.05) between males and females
  are shown in bold. B: diagram of biological networks of selected genes whose expression
  were up- and downregulated at least 1.5-fold in the lungs of animals exposed to
  ozone vs. filtered air (n = 6/group). Left, changes in male mice; right, genes affected
  in female mice. Both diagrams show reported direct (solid lines) and indirect (dashed
  lines) gene interactions. Each gene or group of gene is represented as a node in
  green (downregulated) or red (upregulated). Network analysis was performed with
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (see materials and methods for details).'
