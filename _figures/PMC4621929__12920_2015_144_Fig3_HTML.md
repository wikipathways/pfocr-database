caption: STRING network analysis reveals a database of known and predicted protein
  interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional)
  associations. The network has been simplified for clear illustration of genes of
  interest. Stronger associations are represented by thicker lines. The significant
  genes were mainly TP53, AKT1, SRC, EGF, EGFR, PIK3CG, EP300 and FYN, and enriched
  functional categories included focal adhesion, cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions,
  the ERBB signaling pathway, the cell cycle, adherens junctions and the JAK–STAT
  signaling pathway
