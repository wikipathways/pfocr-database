caption: Regulation of RNAP activity in stalled TECs and functional consequences of
  translesion transcription. (A) Possible outcomes of translesion RNA synthesis. DNA
  lesion (red) may be correctly bypassed by RNAP, or lead to transcriptional mutagenesis
  (light blue, mismatched RNA nucleotide), or lead to TEC stalling with potential
  backtracking. Stalled/backtracked TECs may perform internal RNA cleavage stimulated
  by TFIIS and Gre factors or may be stabilized in an inactive conformation by other
  factors. Mfd, Rho and CSB can promote forward translocation of stalled TECs on damaged
  DNA and stimulate read-through transcription. A failure in RNAP reactivation results
  in the recruitment of downstream DNA repair factors and activation of the NER pathway.
  (B) Factors that regulate RNAP activity and have confirmed or proposed roles in
  TEC stalling and translesion transcription. The arrows indicate the direction of
  translocation of indicated factors along DNA or RNA. Eukaryotic proteins are abbreviated
  in red, archaeal proteins are blue.
