caption: (a) E. coli whole-cell bioconversion strategy and (b) itaconate synthesis
  pathway in A. terreus (fermentation). In the E. coli whole-cell bioconversion strategy,
  two enzymes involved in this pathway, aconitase and cis-aconitate decarboxylase,
  were overexpressed. Unlike A. terreus, E. coli has no organelles, so the reaction
  proceeds spontaneously without the need for intracellular transport. In A. terreus
  fermentation, glucose is metabolized through glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Citric
  acid generated by the TCA cycle is converted to cis-aconitic acid by aconitase in
  the cytosol. Cis-aconitic acid is transferred to the mitochondria and converted
  to itaconic acid by cis-aconitate decarboxylase.
