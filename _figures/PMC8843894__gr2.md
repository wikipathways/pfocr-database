caption: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the interleukin (IL)-1β/IL-6 signaling
  pathway contribute to atherosclerotic premature coronary artery disease (PCAD).
  The IL1-CCC, IL-6-147 g/c, and IL-17A polymorphisms are correlated with atherosclerosis
  and PCAD via their effects on the IL-1β/IL-6/C-reactive protein (CRP) inflammation
  pathway. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in the production of IL-1β
  and consequent downstream effects on IL-6 and CRP synthesis in the liver. IL-17
  produced by activated T cells promotes the production of IL-6, which amplifies local
  inflammation.
