caption: 'Mutant p53 (mutp53) interacts with various transcription factors (TFs) to
  reprogram gene expression in cancer cells.Notes: (A) Mutp53 forms a complex with
  NFY, p300, PELP1, and TopBP1 to control expression of genes involved in cell proliferation
  and in resistance to DNA-damaging drugs.– (B) Mutp53 binds with YAP and NFY on the
  promoters of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation; both mechanical inputs
  and activation of the mevalonate pathway control formation and activity of this
  protein complex.–, (C) By interacting with SREBP2, mutp53 controls expression of
  enzymes involved in the mevalonate pathway, promoting cholesterol and fatty-acid
  biosynthesis, sustaining disruption of mammary-tissue architecture, and inhibiting
  mechanisms of mutp53 degradation.–,, (D) By interacting with NRF2, mutp53 controls
  expression of multiple subunits of the proteasome, alleviating proteotoxic stress
  and accelerating turnover of cell-cycle inhibitors. (E) In a complex with HSF1,
  mutp53 controls expression of chaperones and heat-shock proteins that in turn promote
  mutp53 stability. (F) Mutp53 may interact with additional transcription factors,
  potentially controlling expression of different gene sets, to mediate its oncogenic
  gain of function.'
