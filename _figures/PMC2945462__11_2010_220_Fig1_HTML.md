caption: The complement cascade is comprised of the Classical, Alternative, and Mannose
  Binding Lectin pathways. Although the activation and amplification of each pathway
  is unique, they all converge with cleavage of C3 into its main split products, C3a
  and C3b, ultimately resulting in formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC).
  Historically considered a critical arm of innate immunity, emerging research has
  implicated various complement proteins in proliferative and regenerative processes
  in organs including bone, marrow, liver, and connective tissues. C1q maintains appropriate
  turnover and clearance of cellular debris, while C4 maintains B cell tolerance,
  processes critical in the prevention of autoimmune disease. Hematopoietic stem cell
  homing, chemotaxis, engraftment, and mobilization are heavily influenced by the
  anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Additionally, they help facilitate hepatocyte protection
  and regeneration in mouse models of toxic and surgical injury. Limb and lens regeneration
  in urodele amphibians are mediated by C3 and C5, while complement proteins such
  as C1s, C5, C9, factor B and properdin are distributed throughout immature, developing
  bone and appear to be important in osteogenesis. MBL mannose-binding lectin, MASP
