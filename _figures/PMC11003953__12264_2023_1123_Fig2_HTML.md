caption: Role of SCFAs in the pathology of Parkinson’s disease. Dietary fiber is fermented
  by intestinal microbiota to produce SCFAs, which enter intestinal epithelial cells
  through MCT and SMCT transporters. SCFAs can enhance the integrity of the intestinal
  mucosal barrier by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins, which help
  reduce the penetration of pathogens. SCFAs can also inhibit the C/EBP pathway to
  reduce the spread of α-syn from the gut to the brain. In enteroendocrine cells,
  SCFAs will promote the secretion of 5-HT, GLP-1, and PYY, which are important neuroprotective
  factors. In the immune pathway, SCFAs regulate the differentiation and function
  of immune cells and the secretion of cytokines in the peripheral circulation, indirectly
  influencing the central immune environment. A small number of SCFAs can also directly
  cross the blood-brain barrier to play a central regulatory role. The SCFAs entering
  the brain can enhance the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, regulate the activation
  of microglia, increase the expression of BDNF and GDNF in glial cells, and modulate
  the expression and propagation of α-syn. Created with BioRender.com.
