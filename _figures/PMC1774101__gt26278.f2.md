caption: Pleiotropic effects resulting from the interaction of activated CD40L+ T
  cells, activated CD40L+ platelets, or soluble CD40L with immune and non-immune cells.
  Engagement of CD40 on B cells leads to antibody production whereas a much wider
  range of effects are induced in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells activated
  through the CD40 pathway. Some of these include production of cytokines, chemokines,
  cyclooxygenases (COX), prostaglandins (PGs), metalloproteinases (MMPs), and nitric
  oxide (NO), upregulation of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and modulation of apoptosis.
  Activation of non-immune cells through the CD40 pathway induces a spectrum of effects
  similar to those observed in monocytic cells.
