caption: Differentially methylated genes converge on pathways regulating mitochondrial
  homeostasis in response to metabolic and oxidative stress. Mitochondrial homeostasis
  is maintained by differentially methylated genes (in red) involved in mitochondrial
  biogenesis, fission and fusion that converge on the regulation of mitochondrial
  copy number in response to metabolic and oxidative stress. Metabolic stress, which
  decreases ATP production, activates cAMP and AMPK signaling leading to the transcription
  and activation of PGC-1α. PGC-1α upregulates the expression of Nrf1 and GABPA which
  induce the transcription of the mitochondrial transcription factors to facilitate
  mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1α also upregulates the transcription of antioxidant
  enzymes to modulate oxidative stress or ROS levels. Oxidative stress activates the
  redox-sensitive Nfe2l2 pathway, which upregulates both GABPA and the Pink-Parkin
  pathway that controls mitophagy, fission and fusion (Nfe2l2 = nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2; NRF1 = Nuclear respiratory factor 1; p62 = ubiquitin-binding
  protein p62; Pink = PTEN-induced kinase 1; ROS = reactive oxygen species).
