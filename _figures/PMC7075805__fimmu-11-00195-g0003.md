caption: Calcium (Ca2+)–calcineurin–nuclear factor of an activated T cell (NFAT) signaling
  pathway as a novel therapeutic target. Orai1 is a plasma membrane protein with four
  transmembrane segments. Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a single-pass
  transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The increase in
  intracellular Ca2+ concentration by Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+
  (CRAC)/Orai1 induces the phosphatase calcineurin. As a result, the activated calcineurin
  dephosphorylates several serine residues of the NFAT. The NFAT then translocates
  to the nucleus where it binds to DNA and regulates target gene expression. Some
  ions or small molecules, including La3+, SKF96365, and 2-ABP, are able to inhibit
  the CRAC channel. Again, already-commercialized cyclosporine A and tacrolimus inhibit
  calcineurin. Since dysregulated Ca2+signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of
  autoimmune diseases, intervention of Ca2+signaling in store-operated Ca2+ entry
  (SOCE) through the Orai1–STIM1 pathway may be a promising approach to control autoimmune
  diseases.
