caption: 'The tick life stages involved in the transmission of a typical pathogen
  (outer ring) and critical physical/physiological barriers to pathogen acquisition,
  replication and transmission (inner circle) are depicted. Representative pathogens:
  (a) Borrelia spp.; (b) Anaplasma phagocytophilum; (c) Tick-borne flavivirus (e.g.,
  Langat virus, LGTV). The different strategies employed by a parasite to navigate
  from the midgut to the salivary glands, and tick and parasite derived factors known
  to facilitate these processes are shown. IMD, Immunodeficiency; JAK-STAT, Janus
  Kinase/Signal Transsducers and Activators of Transcription; OspA, Borrelia outer
  surface protein A; Salp15/16, salivary gland protein 15/16; tHRF, tick histamine-release
  factor; TROPSA, tick receptor for OspA; TSLP1, tick salivary lectin pathway inhibitor.'
