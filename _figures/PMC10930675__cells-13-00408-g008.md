caption: A model of RUNX2 and CXCR4 effects on melanoma cells. Melanoma cells express
  the RUNX2 transcription factor (represented in purple), which binds to the CXCR4
  gene (represented in blue) and promotes mRNA transcription and CXCR4 biosynthesis.
  The CXCR4 protein exerts multiple effects on melanoma cells, including increased
  autophagy, cell invasiveness, and osteotropism, with a simultaneous inhibition of
  the mTOR signalling pathway (represented in red)
