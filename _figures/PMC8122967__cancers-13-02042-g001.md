caption: The connection between PARPs, prosurvival signaling, and cell death resistance.
  PARP1 and 2 are important cell death resistance and prosurvival factors because
  of their dominant role in multiple DNA repair pathways, fork reactivation, and the
  execution of mitosis. PARPis target these functions. Interactions between the PARP
  family and cell survival regulation, however, extends beyond the modulation of specific
  gene transcription and signaling events by PARP proteins. PARP-1 is involved in
  the upregulation of PDGFRα, contributing to autocrine/paracrine survival growth
  factor signaling in neuroblastomas. PARP-2 is a coactivator of nuclear hormone receptors
  and contributes to the growth of hormone-dependent prostate and breast carcinomas.
  The PARPs regulate several MAPK pathways as well. The interaction of PARP-1 with
  ERK facilitates the phosphorylation of ELK and other ERK-dependent stimulatory chromatin
  alterations on the promoters of cell-survival inducing genes. PARP-14 is an effector
  of JNK1/2-dependent prosurvival signaling in various cancers. PARP-1 is a negative
  regulator of the prosurvival RTK-PI3K-Akt pathway; the consumption of available
  cytoplasmic NAD+ by PARP-1 prevents the deacetylation of Akt by SIRT1, which may
  be important for the tissue-saving effect of PARPis after ischemic damage. TNKS1/2,
  however, support Akt signaling by PARylating and promoting the degradation of PTEN.
  The interconnection of the PI3K-Akt pathway with the NRF2 and HIF pathways makes
  the outcome of PARP activation/inhibition controversial and potentially cell-type
  specific. During substantial genotoxic stress, PAR chains produced by PARP-1 and
  2 at DNA damage sites and released by PARG translocate into the mitochondria and
  induce parthanatos, a programmed necrosis. One of the primary mediators of parthanatos
  is AIF, a liberated mitochondrial factor that induces the macrophage migration inhibitory
  factor (MIF) to cleave the nuclear DNA into 20–50 kb fragments. A distinct cytoplasmic
  subset of PARP-1 is recruited into the DISC and is involved in interference with
  the extrinsic apoptosis pathway and in the sustained activation of Src survival
  signaling. The role of the rest of the PARPs in cell death signaling is also multimodal.
  PARP-13 facilitates the degradation of the mRNA of the decoy receptor, TRAILR4,
  restoring TRAIL sensitivity and facilitating apoptosis. PARP16, an ER-localized
  transmembrane protein, PARylates PERK and IRE-1α and facilitates their role in the
  ER-stress response, which can be adaptive or lead to apoptosis. Similarly, the outcome
  of p53 activation can range from cell survival to programmed cell death; consequently,
  the net result of p53–PARP1 interaction is expected to be cell-type and context-dependent.
  PARP1 recruits p300 to a set of E2F-dependent promoters, which results in the expression
  of proliferation-enhancing target genes. Retinoblastoma-like protein 2 (RBL2) counteracts
  the opening of the chromatin at these promoters. The retinoblastoma protein inhibits
  the expression of PARP1.
