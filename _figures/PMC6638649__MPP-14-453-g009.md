caption: Model of ethylene/jasmonate (JA) independent pathways of petunia response
  to pathogens. When petunia encounters pathogen, the biosynthesis and activation
  signalling of the ethylene pathway are induced (wide arrows). Subsequently, some
  petunia ethylene response factor (PhERF) genes, such as PhERF4, PhERF6, PhERF8 and
  PhERF13, are activated in order to induce plants to launch the basal defence response,
  although finally programmed cell death and senescence occur. Otherwise, the ethylene
  signalling pathway is completely blocked by induced ethylene‐insensitive1‐1 (etr1‐1)
  expression, and the biosynthesis and consequent signalling of the JA pathway are
  induced by B. cinerea infection (narrow arrows). Some PhERFs, such as PhERF2, PhERF3,
  PhERF4, PhERF7 and PhERF8, are activated at the transcriptional level. In turn,
  the transcriptional accumulation of defence‐related genes, together with delayed
  senescence (narrow arrows) makes ethylene‐insensitive petunia tolerant to the pathogen
  to some extent (narrow arrows). See text for gene definitions.
