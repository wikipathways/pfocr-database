caption: Early enzymatic steps in the JA biosynthesis pathway regulated by SIPK, WIPK
  and NPR1 after wounding and FAC elicitation. The perception of FACs and/or wounding
  by the leaf elicits signaling mechanisms that activate the release of 18:3 from
  membrane glycerolipids. This activation is mediated by SIPK and NPR1 in N. attenuata
  leaves most likely via the activation of glycerolipase A1 (GLA1). N. attenuata lipoxygenase
  3 (LOX3) catalyzes the conversion of the free 18:3 into 13-OOH-18:3 which it is
  rapidly utilized for the synthesis of OPDA by allene oxide synthase (AOS) and allene
  oxide cyclase (AOC). WIPK-mediated mechanisms target the activation of OPDA biosynthesis
  via the regulation of AOS and/or AOC. EOT, 12,13-epoxy-18:3; OPDA, (9S,13S)-12-oxo-phytodienoic
  acid; JA, jasmonic acid.
