caption: RNA methylation pathway and NAD+ salvage pathway in cancer. In tumor tissues,
  heterogeneous cell populations exert differential functions of the RNA methylation
  pathway (A) and the NAD+ salvage pathway (B), which are examples of the methylosystem.
  Nicotinamide metabolism is shown as the NAD+ salvage pathway in the correlation
  of the kynurenine pathway and the one-carbon pathway. Although NAD+ can be synthesized
  from tryptophan in the kynurenine pathway, this metabolic pathway is less effective
  in humans than in mice. 2PY, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide; 4PY, N-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide;
  NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosyl-homocysteine.
