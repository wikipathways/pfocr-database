caption: A schematic diagram for the synergistic JNK activation triggered by cross-communication
  between Gi-coupled receptors and EGF signaling. (1) Activation of Gi-coupled receptors
  triggers the dissociation of Gi proteins into Gαi and Gβγ subunits, with the former
  having negligible contribution towards the stimulation of JNK as compared to the
  latter; (2) Gβγ subunits released from Gi mainly utilize a Src family kinase-dependent
  pathway to stimulate the JNK cascade; (3) On the other hand, stimulation of EGFR
  with EGF enables recruitment of PLCγ and PI3K; (4) Stimulated PLCγ and PI3 K induce
  elevation of intracellular Ca2+ level and phospholipid products (PIP3), respectively;
  (5) Different signals from activated EGFR and Gi-coupled receptors, such as Src
  family kinases, Ca2+ and PI3 K may converge at a common locus (e.g. GEFs), which
  is capable of modulating the activities of small GTPases, and hence the subsequent
  stimulatory signal through the three-kinase module (6) of JNK cascade (MKKKs → MKK4/7
  → JNK).
