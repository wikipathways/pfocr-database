caption: 'Vaccine-induced immune activation pathway for an adenovirus vaccine. Faint
  background: The subsequent downstream of signaling pathways activated through adaptive
  immunity when SARS-CoV-2 enters the human cell. Highlighted compartments describe
  vector-based vaccine-induced immune system stimulation that is modeled explicitly
  in this study. The dashed arrows show implicit communications between cells and
  cytokines, and the only solid arrow indicates the production of antibodies by B-cells.'
