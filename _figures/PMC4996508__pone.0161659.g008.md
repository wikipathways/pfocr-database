caption: (A) The PAC-3 protein contains 621 amino acid residues and has three C2H2
  zinc-finger domains encompassing the amino acid from 95 to 183. The NLS sequence
  is shown between amino acid residues 281 and 304. The black arrow indicates the
  putative protease-processing site at amino acid 490. (B) N. crassa has the six A.
  nidulans Pal homologues. External pH signaling may involve the PAL-8, PAL-9, PAL-6
  and PAL-3 complex. PAL-1 may act together with PAL-2 and may recruit the PAC-3 protein.
  PAC-3 undergoes only one proteolytic processing and is likely involved in the activation
  of the pal-1, pal-2, pal-9, and pac-3 genes and the repression of the pal-6 and
  pal-8 genes at alkaline conditions. aa, amino acid; ZF, C2H2 zinc finger; NLS, nuclear
  localization signal.
