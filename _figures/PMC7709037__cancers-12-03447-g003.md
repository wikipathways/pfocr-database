caption: 'Merging network associated with the EGFR/ERBB2 signaling pathway by IPA-identified
  three networks (#1, #5, and #12 in ). EGFR and ERK1/2 are weakly downregulated,
  and NFKB1 and ERBB2 are strongly upregulated in ovarian cancer patients. The network
  shapes show the categories of the proteins. In the IPA network, red indicates ovarian
  cancer upregulation, green, downregulation, orange, predicted upregulation, and
  blue, predicted downregulation and the color intensity indicates the magnitude of
  the relative change in protein expression.'
