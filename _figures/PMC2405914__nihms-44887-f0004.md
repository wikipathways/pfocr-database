caption: 'Catenins regulate downstream signals that impact on several aspects of cell
  behavior. β-catenin has a well-established role in the Wnt signaling pathway, where
  it associates with members of the Lef/Tcf family of DNA-binding proteins to alter
  transcription. α-catenin orchestrates the appropriate balance between cell proliferation
  and differentiation by regulating a diverse number of signaling pathways including:
  Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and its downstream transcriptional mediator Gli; tyr kinase
  growth factor receptors and their downstream proliferation effectors Ras/MAPK; and
  NFκB, which when phosphorylated can enter the nucleus and regulate the expression
  of genes involved in proinflammatory responses. Loss-of-function mutations in α-catenin
  are associated with tissue degeneration, cancer, and marked inflammation. Loss-of-function
  mutations in p120-catenin have minor roles in lower eukaryotes such as Drosophila
  and C. elegans. However, in higher eukaryotes, alterations in p120-catenin promote
  the degradation of cadherins and deregulation of Kaiso. Additionally, cytosolic
  p120-catenin regulates the activities of Rho GTPases, inhibiting RhoA and activating
  Rac1 and Cdc42, thereby regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration.
  In addition, consistent with the broad roles for Rho GTPases in cell behavior, p120-catenin
  may also regulate several regulatory events, such as the RhoA-GTPase-mediated activation
  of IKK, the kinase that phosphorylates and activates NFκB. Genetic studies in mice
  have unambiguously demonstrated that the absence of p120-catenin is deleterious
  in skin, salivary gland, and brain tissues by modulating signals that promote tissue
  proliferation, migration, and inflammation, which may predispose the tissue to cancer.'
