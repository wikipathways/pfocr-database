caption: 'The Fattening fasting cycle: potential role of uric acid. During the preparation
  before a fast, an animal will ingest foods that will increase total body fat stores.
  We propose fructose is especially desirable due to its specific ability to increase
  serum lipids, hepatic fat stores, and serum uric acid. Vitamin C may have negative
  effects on this pathway (shown by dashed lines). Once fasting, the fat is preferentially
  broken down as an energy source, but once depleted there is the breakdown of protein
  with the release of uric acid and cortisol that stimulate a foraging response for
  food with additional survival benefits including effects on blood pressure and insulin
  resistance. In the event that foraging is not successful, wasting occurs with hypotension
  and death. In contrast, excessive stimulation of uric acid (primarily by diet) or
  of cortisol (primarily by endocrine overproduction) may lead to a condition resembling
  the metabolic syndrome with obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance'
