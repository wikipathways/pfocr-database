caption: 'The unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway consists of three
  major branches: activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol-requiring enzyme-1α
  (IRE1α), and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK). During endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,
  they are activated. In the ER, IRE1α binds to TRAF2 and becomes activated. IRE1α
  splices the XBP1u (unspliced) mRNA to form XBP1s (spliced), then translocated to
  the nucleus to activate UPR target genes involved in the stress response. IRE1α
  activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in the cytoplasm,
  which may lead to apoptosis. Upon activation, PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which inhibits global protein synthesis. This allows
  selective translation of ATF4, which then enters the nucleus to activate UPR target
  genes. ATF6, when activated, moves to the Golgi apparatus, where it is cleaved to
  form the ATF6n (nuclear form) protein. ATF6n translocates to the nucleus and activates
  UPR'
