caption: The role of H. pylori in Hippo pathway remodeling. CagA-positive H. pylori
  infection activates YAP1 and TAZ. CagA promoted the nuclear YAP1 and TAZ levels
  inside gastric mucosa from gastritis, and intestinal metaplasia, to GC. The Hippo
  signature genes, such as CTGF, Cyr61, IL-1β (Interleukin-1β), LATS2, etc., are upregulated
  following H. pylori infection. Moreover, TAZ participates in H. pylori-driven EMT
  and gastric carcinogenesis. In the gastric mucosa of H. pylori-associated GC mouse
  models and patients, nuclear TAZ accumulation activated ZEB1 expression, potentiating
  the EMT and stemness.
