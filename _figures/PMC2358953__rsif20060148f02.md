caption: Network diagram showing the checkpoint response to uncapped telomeres. (a)
  Activation of ExoX and Exo1. ExoX requires Rad24 and Rad17 binding for its activation.
  Exo1 is activated independent of Rad24 and Rad17, although it may also act on telomeres
  bound by Rad17 and be activated in a Rad24-dependent manner. (b) Binding of single-stranded
  DNA (ssDNA) by RPA. Each molecule of RPA requires three units of ssDNA to bind.
  (c) Activation of checkpoint response via Rad53/Dun1 pathway. Activation of this
  pathway leads to inhibition of nuclease activity. Dashed line indicates an event,
  where a threshold level of Mec1RPAssDNA activates a kinase (Rad9Kin) which activates
  Rad9. (d) Activation of checkpoint response via Chk1 pathway does not affect Exo1.
  (e) Recovery can take place during S phase or G2/M arrest after single-stranded
  DNA has been removed. The dashed line indicates an event. When the level of ssDNA
  is equal to 0, the dummy species ‘recovery’ is set to 1 and the recapping reaction
  can then occur. See  for more details.
