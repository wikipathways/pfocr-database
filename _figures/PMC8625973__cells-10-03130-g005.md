caption: Schematic timeline of WBP2 implication in the Hippo pathway. WBP2 was first
  discovered to interact with YAP in 1995. Later in 2011, it was shown to promote
  growth in Drosophila by associating with Yorkie. In the same year, its oncogenic
  role affecting the Hippo pathway was first implicated in breast cancer through its
  association with TAZ. The oncogenic role of WBP2 in directing Hippo dysregulation
  was later extended to other cancer types including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
  (cSCC), non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and gastric cancer. The Hippo pathway
  regulating WBP2 levels was identified to be through the Dicer–miRNA axis by MST.
  The text coloured in blue describes the transcriptional co-activator role of WBP2
  in the Hippo pathway through binding to YAP and TAZ. The text coloured in red describes
  a non-transcriptional co-activator mechanism of WBP2 in the Hippo pathway. The arrow
  indicates the direction of regulation (i.e., WBP2 on Hippo/Hippo on WBP2). Created
