caption: 'Simplified representation of mechanisms of DDR and DNA repair. Shown are
  types of DNA damage and repair known to be affected by GH, IGF1, and αMSH (see -).
  (A) Replication stress, oxidative damage, UV irradiation, chemotherapy, and radiation
  therapy lead to different types of DNA damage, including double-strand breaks (DSBs)
  that can lead to chromosomal aberration if left unrepaired. (B) DDR is facilitated
  by activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase family members ATM
  and ATR, DNA-PKcs, and PARP family members, which phosphorylate the tumor suppressor
  p53 and checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 to block cell-cycle progression and slow
  propagation of damaged cells. Activation of the DDR pathway promotes activation
  of DNA repair mechanisms driven by specific kinases, which enables restored cell-cycle
  progression following DNA repair. Abbreviations: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated;
  ATR, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related; BER, base excision repair; BRCA, breast
  cancer; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers; DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase,
  catalytic subunit; DSB, double-strand break; HR, homologous recombination; NER,
  nucleotide excision repair; NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining; OGG1, 8-oxoguanin-DNA
  glycosilase; 8-OHdG, 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine; p53BP1, p53 binding protein-1;
  PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; SSB, single-strand break; TERT, telomerase reverse
  transcriptase.'
