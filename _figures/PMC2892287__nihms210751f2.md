caption: The HOG pathway has two upstream sensors, Sln1 and Sho1, whose signals are
  integrated by Pbs2 to activate Hog1. The Sln1 branch has weak activity, even in
  the absence of signaling, demonstrated by Macia et al. (). The leaky activity is
  a feature conferring fast response, rather than a design flaw, and is kept in check
  by feedback inhibition involving Hog1 through an as-yet-unknown mechanism. The Sho1
  branch is also inhibited by negative feedback, discovered by Hao et al. with a hypothesis
  generated by Bayesian network modeling (). Other researchers have treated the HOG
  pathway as a black box, characterizing the response of each branch to step function
  and periodic inputs. The fast-responding Sln1 branch responds proportionally to
  dose and integrates fast signals. The slow-responding Sho1 branch responds to high
  doses and slow inputs, but rejects low doses and fast inputs. Blue lines represent
  data from Macia et al. (), and orange lines represent data from Hao et al. ().
