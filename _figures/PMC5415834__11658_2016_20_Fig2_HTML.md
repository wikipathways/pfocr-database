caption: BAG2 interacts with the molecular chaperone Hsp70, which plays a prominent
  role in protein homeostasis. BAG2 accelerates ADP dissociation from Hsp70 and promotes
  Hsp70-mediated protein refolding. BAG2 is also an inhibitor of the Hsp70-binding
  E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP and inhibits CHIP-mediated ubiquitination. Importantly,
  BAG2 inhibits tau ubiquitination, delivering phosphorylated tau to the proteasome
  for degradation via a ubiquitin-independent pathway. (+) indicates promoting, (−)
  indicates inhibiting, Ub indicates ubiquitin and UPS indicates the ubiquitin–proteasome
  system
