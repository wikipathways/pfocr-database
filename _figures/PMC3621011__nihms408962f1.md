caption: Multiple strategies have been employed to pharmacologically target the VEGF
  signaling pathway. One anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody has been developed (bevacizumab).
  Multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) target the intracellular kinase domain
  on the VEGF receptors, as well as on other important tyrosine kinases. Five currently
  approved VSP inhibitors fall into this category (sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib,
  pazopanib, and vandetanib). Numerous other TKIs are in various stages of development
  or trials. Other approaches to VSP inhibition that are currently in development
  or clinical trials include a soluble VEGF receptor, or VEGF-Trap, and a monoclonal
  antibody generated against VEGFR2.
