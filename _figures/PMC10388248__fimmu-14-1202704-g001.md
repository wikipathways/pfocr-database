caption: Schematic view of exosome-based crosstalk between NPCE and TM. In the NPCE
  cells, exosomes are constitutively formed from multivesicular bodies (MVE) after
  the inward budding of their membranes and are released with the fusion of MV with
  the plasma membrane. NPCE-derived exosomes specifically act on TM via oriented outflow
  of the aqueous humor to regulate its activities, particularly the canonical Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. Inhibition of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in
  the TM is a signature of POAG, which is characterized by a reduced nuclear fraction
  of β-catenin and overexpression of its key negative regulator GSK-3β. Under the
  physical state, NPCE-derived exosomes positively regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway in TM and promote the refreshing and phagocytosis of its extracellular matrix,
  which is compromised in patients with POAG. NPCE, non-pigment ciliary epithelium;
  GSK–3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; LPR 5/6, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5/6; TCF/LEF, T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor.
