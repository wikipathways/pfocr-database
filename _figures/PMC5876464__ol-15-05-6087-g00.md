caption: Signaling pathway of GRP78. Upon ER stress, GRP78 separates from UPR sensors
  (PERK, IRE1 and ATF6) and preferentially associates with unfolded proteins, upon
  which UPR is activated. These sensors elicit damage control pathways synergistically,
  activated partially by ATFs (ATF4 and ATF6). The nuclear form ATFs subsequently
  act on ERSE, increasing the expression of GRP78. Overexpressed GRP78 may be redistributed
  to the cell surface by means of vesicle transport, recognizing extracellular ligands
  and activating PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. The activation of PI3K/AKT
  and MAPK signaling pathways may also lead to the rapid induction of GRP78. GRP,
  glucose-regulated protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response;
  PERK, protein kinase-like ER kinase; IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme 1; ATF, activating
  transcription factor; ERSE, endoplasmic reticulum stress-response element; PI3 K,
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Par-4, prostate apoptosis response-4.
