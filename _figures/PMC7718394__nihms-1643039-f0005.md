caption: Eleven differentially upregulated genes between HU and HEU infants were submitted
  into the KEGG pathway finder to determine pathway specific effects. Genes with higher
  upregulation involved in anti- (blue) and pro-inflammatory (red) responses are shown
  for the corresponding HU or HEU condition. Effect of dampened CSF2 and PTGS2 are
  shown for HEU monocytes (gray text, dashed lines)
