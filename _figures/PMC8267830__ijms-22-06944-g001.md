caption: Schematic diagram of the canonical PI3K/mTOR signalling pathway and its interactions
  with the nutrient sources and cell cycle proteins. For a more detailed description
  see the main text. Grey arrows indicate positive regulations, while red arrows with
  blunt ends show negative regulations. Round boxes with P indicate phosphorylation
  events. The binding of growth factors (e.g., insulin) to IR/IGFR triggers activation
  of the receptors, promoting the recruitment of IRS and subsequent PI3K activation.
  PI3K converts PIP2 into PIP3, which is reversed by PTEN. PIP3 recruits mTORC2, PDK1
  and Akt to be co-localised at the plasma membrane, leading to the full activation
  of Akt. Active Akt phosphorylates a plethora of target proteins, including TSC2,
  GSK3β, IKKα and IRS1/2. Akt also phosphorylates Sin1 and increases mTORC2 activity.
  IKKα phosphorylates mTOR and stimulates the activation of mTORC1/2, but detailed
  mechanisms are unclear. DEPTOR displays a mutual inhibition with both mTORC1 and
  2. mTORC1 and S6K1 inhibit IR/IGFR through Grb10 and IRS, respectively. mTORC1 upregulates
  PTEN expression through enhanced translation, while mTORC2 down-regulates IRS1 through
  ubiquitin mediated degradation. The cyclin A-CDK2 complex phosphorylates and promotes
  Akt activation. Hyper-phosphorylated Rb localized in the cytoplasm binds to Sin1
  and suppresses mTORC2 activity. mTORC2 phosphorylates and down-regulates the functional
  activity of xCT, which inhibits glutamate efflux and leads to increased TCA cycle
  activity. Glucose uptake is enhanced by Akt, which leads to activation of mTORC2
  through acetyl-CoA-mediated acetylation of RICTOR.
