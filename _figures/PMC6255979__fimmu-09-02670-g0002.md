caption: Non-canonical mechanisms whereby betaine inhibits IL-1β production. (A) Caspase-8
  plays a vital role in promoting NF-κB signaling, and also modulates pro-IL-1β cleavage
  at exactly the same site as caspase-1. Actually, FADD and caspase-8 control the
  transcriptional priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome via modulation of the NLRP3 and
  pro-IL-1β expression. Betaine inhibits IL-1β production by preventing the induction
  of caspase-8 activity/activation. (B) The triggering of dectin-1 promotes Syk-dependent
  formation of the CARD9-Bcl-10-MALT1 scaffold that induces NF-κB activation and IL-1β
  transcription; as well as the formation and activation of a MALT1-caspase-8-ASC
  complex that mediates the processing of pro-IL-1β. Betaine reduces IL-1β production
  through suppressing the formation and activation of MALT1-caspase-8-ASC complex.
  (C) Caspase-11 is also essential for the NLRP3 inflammasome activation culminating
  with IL-1β production. Mechanistically, LPS-activated caspase-11 induces plasma
  membrane channel pannexin-1 cleavage, leading to K+ efflux and ATP release that
  interacts with P2X7R to promote the activation of NLRP3. Interestingly, betaine
  reduces IL-1β production by increasing HO-1 expression to activate cGMP-PKG signaling
  pathway, which ameliorates the pannexin-1 channel activity. HO-1, heme oxygenase-1;
  PKG, protein kinase G.
