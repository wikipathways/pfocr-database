caption: The two main steps for full inflammasome activation. Initiation of the process
  is priming, which leads to increased expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1b via nuclear
  factor-kappa B. This acts as a second messenger for toll-like receptor activation
  via DAMPs or PAMPs; an alternative pathway is NF-kB stimulation by TNF receptor
  and TNF α. Triggering or full activation of the inflammasome is the final oligomerization
  of NLRP3 with procaspase-1 cleaving properties. It can be induced by intracellular
  signaling due to increased ROS generation by dysfunctional mitochondria, potassium
  efflux or calcium influx, or lysosomal lysis after LDL crystal endocytosis. (Reproduced
