caption: Regulatory interactions between auxin and cytokinin pathways controlling
  LR development. Auxin acts as a key hormone for LR formation. Components of auxin
  biosynthesis, transport and signaling including auxin/indole-3-acetic acids (Aux/IAAs)
  and auxin response factors (ARFs), play important roles in LR initiation and LR
  primordium development. Cytokinin generally plays an antagonistic role to auxin
  pathway in LR formation. Cytokinin biosynthesis enzyme IPT, degrading enzyme CKX,
  and signaling components AHK, ARR, and AHP6, involved in LRs initiation and growth.
  Arrows and inhibition lines represent positive and negative interactions, respectively.
  ABA, abscisic acid; AHK, Arabidopsis histidine kinase; AHP, Arabidopsis histidine
  phosphotransferase; ARR, arabidopsis response regulator; AUX, auxin resistant; Aux/IAA,
  Auxin/indole-3-acetic acid; ARF, auxin response factor; BR, brassinosteroid; CKX,
  cytokinin oxidase; CRE1, cytokinin response 1; IPT, isopentenyl transferase; PIN,
  PIN-formed; TIR1, transport inhibitor response 1.
