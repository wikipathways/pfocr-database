caption: Low-level expression of a constitutively active ras-GTPase (ras-GTP) activates
  the MAPK pathway and converts quiescent normal urothelial cells into simple urothelial
  hyperplasia, which is persistent for an extended period (8–10 months) without progressing
  to urothelial tumors. In contrast, overactivation of the ras-GTPase profoundly activates
  survival and angiogenesis signals along PI3K/AKT and STAT pathways, leading to the
  formation of nodular hyperplasia and low-grade, noninvasive urothelial tumors. The
  activation of the STAT pathway that is unique to nodular hyperplasia and urothelial
  tumors, both of which contain mesenchymal components, may result from signaling
  from growth factors (GFs) and cytokines (CTKs) produced by the tumor mesenchyme.
  The activation of AKT and STAT pathways may also be facilitated by the functional
  inactivation of their upstream inhibitor, PTEN, via its C-terminal hyperphosphorylation.
  FGFR3 mutations, which occur in up to 80% of low-grade, noninvasive human bladder
  tumors, are likely to transmit the signals along pathways similar to those described
  above. C, carboxyl terminus.
