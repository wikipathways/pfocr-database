caption: Schematic representation of the cholinergic anti‐inflammatory pathway. Inflammatory
  mediators, such as cytokines, are released by activated macrophages and other immune
  cells upon immune challenge. These mediators are detected by the afferent arm of
  the inflammatory reflex. Efferent vagus nerve cholinergic output to the spleen and
  gastrointestinal tract regulates immune activation and suppresses pro‐inflammatory
  cytokine release. Vagal nerve stimulation of the intact vagus nerve stimulates both
  afferent and efferent fibres. Electrical stimulation of afferent nerve fibres activates
  neurons in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, leading to activation of not only
  efferent vagus nerves but most likely also of an adrenergic pathway resulting in
  the release of noradrenaline (NA) in the spleen, the major organ source of TNF and
  other pro‐inflammatory cytokines during endotoxemia and other inflammatory conditions.
  Here, NE reduces TNF production by splenic macrophages via activation of T cells
  releasing acetylcholine (ACh) and binding the α7nAChR
