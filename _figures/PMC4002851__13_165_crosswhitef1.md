caption: 'Summary of molecular mechanisms involved in pulmonary remodeling. In pulmonary
  artery smooth muscle cells, inhibition of the potassium channels leads to cell depolarization
  and calcium entry, stimulating excess calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
  leading to calcium-calmodulin–regulated cell proliferation. When growth factors
  (PDGF, VEGF, TGF-β) and mitogens (ET-1) bind to their receptors, various signaling
  pathways are activated which increase cytosolic calcium levels and activate the
  MAPK signaling pathway–stimulating transcription factors (c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, and
  so on) and increase cell proliferation. Prostacyclin’s antagonistic effects act
  by increasing cAMP concentration, which simultaneously inhibits MAPK signaling and
  activates the PKA/MLCK growth-suppressive pathway. The vasodilator nitric oxide
  diffuses into the cell and stimulates cGMP production via guanylyl cyclase that
  results in MLCK dephosphorylation that inhibits cell growth and relaxes the SMC,
  leading to vasodilation. Finally, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane by
  the mitoKATP channels (see mitoKATP above) delays apoptosis by inhibiting cytochrome
  c release and generates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), stimulating transcription factors
  that drive cell proliferation. Cyto-C, cytochrome c; CaM: calcium-calmodulin complex;
