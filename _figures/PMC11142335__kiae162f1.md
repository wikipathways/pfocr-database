caption: A schematic overview of male reproductive development and a proposed model
  for cold stress response during pollen development. A male reproductive organ consists
  of an anther (yellow) with a filament (green). Inside the anther, reproductive cells
  can be found (orange). The regulatory pathway response to cold stress during pollen
  development as proposed by (Liu et al. 2024) is surrounded by a schematic representation
  of male reproductive development
