caption: HSP70 in apoptotic signaling pathways. (A) HSP70 in intrinsic apoptosis.
  In TNF-α induced apoptosis, HSP70 inhibits JNK and p38, thus, preventing the translocation
  of Bax and Bid to the mitochondria [,,]. This blocks the release of cytochrome c
  to the cytosol and its formation of apoptosome complex with Apaf-1 and caspase-9.
  HSP70 may also disrupt the formation of apoptosome by binding to Apaf-1, preventing
  its association with procaspase-9 []. In addition, HSP70 stabilizes lysosomal membrane,
  inhibiting cathepsin release to the cytosol for the activation of intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway. (B) HSP70 in extrinsic apoptosis. HSP70 interacts with TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2
  and prevents the formation of DISC complex required for the initiation of extrinsic
  apoptosis. JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; Cyt C, cytochrome c; Bax, Bcl-2-associated
  X protein; Bid, BH3 interacting-domain death agonist; p38, p38 mitogen-activated
