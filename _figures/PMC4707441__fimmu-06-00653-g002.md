caption: Tetraspanins organize the T-cell immunological synapse. Tetraspanin CD81
  regulates the organization of the immunological synapse (IS) in CD4+ T lymphocytes
  through the association with CD3ζ at the central SMAC (cSMAC). CD81 controls the
  localization of the TCR complex and its downstream signaling, positively modulating
  the phosphorylation of ZAP-70, LAT, and ERK1/2 (dashed line). At the peripheral
  area of the cell–cell contact (pSMAC), tetraspanins CD9, and CD151 are important
  for integrin VLA-4 relocalization and activation, positively regulating the integrin
  downstream phosphorylation of FAK and ERK1/2 (lines with small dashes). At this
  location, CD81 also interacts with the adhesion receptor ICAM-1, regulating its
  segregation during IS maturation. Tetraspanin CD82 accumulates at the pSMAC and
  triggers actin polymerization and the activation of the Rho GTPase pathway (RhoA,
  Rac1, and Cdc42). The activation of this pathway induces the phosphorylation and
  the association of Vav1 and SLP76 (dotted lines), potentiating the phosphorylation
  of the TCR signaling molecules LAT and ZAP-70. In APCs, CD81 is enriched at the
  IS and several tetraspanins are described to associate with MHC-II. Moreover, CD151,
  CD37, and Tssc6 were described to regulate antigen presentation by DCs.
