  Pathways leading to the synthesis of desired 2,3-BDO and undesired metabolites.
  AcCoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; OAA, oxaloacetate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  fbp, fructose bisphosphatase; pdh, pyruvate dehydrogenase; ppc, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase; and sps, sucrose phosphate synthase. (B) Plasmid encoding SpdCas9 and
  the engineered 7942-BDOdCas strain. 7942-BDOdCas strain was engineered using SaCas9
  to integrate SpdCas9 into NSI and 2,3-BDO pathway genes into the NSII site. (C)
  Plasmids encoding the sgRNA and unique barcode. The sgRNA spacer was designed to
  target the protospacer downstream the transcription start site (TSS) of fbp, pdh,
  ppc, or sps (sg1 or sg2) with the highest targeting scores. We also designed a plasmid
  encoding the scrambled sgRNA comprising a nontargeting spacer (sg0). (D) Illustration
  of the combinatorial sgRNA library with 81 combinations. Each sgRNA was labeled
  with a barcode (A: fbp; B: pdh; C: ppc; and D: sps; ) and was expressed from the
  same J23119 promoter. Each gene has three possible suppression levels (0: none;
  1, weak; and 2: strong); thus, there are 34 (=81) possible combinations. The combinatorial
  sgRNA library contained the homology arms for NSIII sites (NSIII L and NSIII R)
  The sequences were confirmed by PCR analyses of the unique barcode using primers
  P1/P2. (E) 7942-BDOdCas-library which was constructed by integrating the sgRNA library
  into the NSIII site of 7942-BDOdCas using SaCas9. (F) 2,3-BDO titer from 7942-BDOdCas-library.
  After antibiotic selection, 210 colonies were picked from 7942-BDOdCas-library and
  cultured in shaker flasks for 11 days for extracellular 2,3-BDO analyses using GC-BID.
  The quantitative data represent the mean ± SD of at least three independent culture
  experiments and were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA.'
