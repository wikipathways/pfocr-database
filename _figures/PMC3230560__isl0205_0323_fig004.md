caption: 'Scheme for how NAADP-regulated TPC2 and KATP channels synergize to trigger
  glucose-evoked insulin secretion. NAADP-induced Ca2+ release from acidic stores
  (AS) synergizes with the KATP-dependent pathway to depolarize the plasma membrane
  and activate VDCCs. The ATP-mediated closure of KATP channels increases membrane
  resistance, which together with Ca2+-dependent depolarizing (non-selective cation)
  currents (possibly mediated by Ca2+-activated TRPM4 or TRPM5 channels), activated
  by NAADP-induced Ca2+-release via TPC2 expressed on acidic stores, may depolarize
  the plasma membrane to threshold for VDCC activation. Ca2+ influx via VDCCs then
  triggers exocytosis of insulin granules. AS: acidic stores; NSCC: non-selective
  cation channel; Rm: membrane resistance; VDCC: voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels;
  Glc: glucose.'
