caption: The P2Y2R modulates a variety of cellular processes through classical G protein-coupled
  receptor pathways and unique receptor motifs. Activation of the P2Y2R by ATP or
  UTP stimulates the Gq-dependent activation of PLC leading to the generation of IP3
  and DAG. IP3 triggers a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores leading to an
  increase in [Ca2+]i and the activation of Ca2+-dependent proteins, whereas DAG serves
  to activate PKC leading to activation of a variety of downstream proteins including
  RAFTK; also known as Pyk2) and the MAP kinases ERK1/2. The Src-homology-3 (SH3)
  domains in the C-terminus allow the P2Y2R to stimulate Src-dependent transactivation
  of growth factor receptors and their downstream signaling molecules Shc and Grb2
  leading to ERK1/2 and p38 activation of cell proliferation and neurite outgrowth.
  The P2Y2R also has been shown to upregulate VCAM-1 through a pathway involving VEGFR-2.
  Furthermore, P2Y2R activation has been shown to stimulate the PI3K/Akt pathway to
  inhibit apoptosis in neurons, a response that was dependent on Src activation. SH3
  domains also allow the P2Y2R to interact with the actin cytoskeleton via the actin-binding
  protein filamin A (FLNa). Alternatively the P2Y2R can access the actin cytoskeleton
  through an extracellular RGD domain that interacts with αvβ3/5 integrins to enable
  activation of Go and G12 proteins allowing the P2Y2R to stimulate cell migration,
  phagocytosis, neurite outgrowth, and diapedesis by activating the cytoskeletal regulators
  Rac and Rho. Lastly, the P2Y2R is able to activate the matrix metalloproteases ADAM10
  and ADAM17 to induce non-amyloidogenic APP processing and shedding of growth factors.
