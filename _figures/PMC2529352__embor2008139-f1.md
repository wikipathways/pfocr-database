caption: Tyrosine kinases at the crossroads of semaphorin signalling pathways. Semaphorin
  receptors can elicit multiple intracellular signalling cascades to control axon
  guidance, cell migration and invasive growth (reviewed by ; ). Notably, the cytoplasmic
  tail of plexins might become tyrosine phosphorylated by either RTKs or cytoplasmic
  tyrosine kinases, indicating further regulatory mechanisms that have not been characterized
  (see text and  for details and specific references). (A) Semaphorin receptor complexes
  often include plexin-associated RTKs. For example, plexin B1 and plexin A1 have
  been found in association with tyrosine kinases such as MET, RON, ERBB2, VEGFR2

  RTKs become activated, resulting in a differential regulation of cell migration,
  invasive growth and morphogenesis. (B) The intracellular domain of plexins might

  activation of the kinases PYK2 and SRC, triggering the PI(3)K/AKT pathway. Moreover,

  neurite outgrowth in response to Sema3A and Sema3B. Therefore, semaphorin signals
  control cytoskeletal dynamics, integrin function, axon guidance, cell migration
  and invasive growth, leading sometimes to opposing functional effects, due to the
