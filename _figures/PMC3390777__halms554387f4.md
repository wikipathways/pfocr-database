caption: Whole-mount in situ hybridization of HH12 cultured embryos. Embryos are viewed
  laterally. (a) Dll1 expression in control embryos, DMSO (control) treatment has
  no detectable effect on the embryo. The Dll1 signal is detected in ventral telencephalon
  (T) and presomitic mesoderm (PM). (b) High concentration of SU5402 (10 M) caused
  severe telencephalic abnormality and downregulation of Dll1. (c) A lower concentration
  of SU5402 affected telencephalon morphogenesis less severely, but Dll1 is still
  abolished or significantly reduced in the telencephalon. (d) Treatment of embryos
  with cyclopamine did not inhibited Dll1 expression.
