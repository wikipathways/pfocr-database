caption: Huntington's disease (HD) as an example of disrupted cysteine metabolism.
  In normal striatal cells, during basal conditions, the expression of CSE is controlled
  by the transcription factor SP1, which has binding sites in the CSE (Cth) promoter,
  resulting in cysteine (denoted as C) and GSH production. When cysteine becomes limiting,
  ATF4 is induced leading to an elevated expression of CSE as well the transporters
  for cystine (denoted as C–C) (System Xc−). System Xc− imports cystine, the oxidized
  form of cysteine, which is subsequently reduced to cysteine inside cells. Both the
  basal as well as ATF4‐mediated induction of CSE in response to cysteine deprivation
  are compromised in HD. SP1 is sequestered by mHtt, leading to diminished expression
  of CSE, causing an increase in ROS. Initially, ATF4 is functional, but during disease
  progression, a further increase in ROS prevents this response, leading to a decline
  in its induction. Stimulating the transsulfuration pathway via the Golgi stress
  response (as shown in the case of monensin, an ionophore and Golgi stressor) can
  protect HD cells and prolong survival.
