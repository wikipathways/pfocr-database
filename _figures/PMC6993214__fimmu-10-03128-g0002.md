caption: Schematic representation of the impact of pathogenic Vibrio cholerae on metabolism,
  growth and immunity in the adult Drosophila midgut. For clarity, we have broken
  the individual responses into separate panels, although it is important to note
  that growth, metabolism and immunity share regulatory components in vivo. By consuming
  metabolites such as methionine sulfoxide (MetO) and acetate, V. cholerae affects
  lipid homeostasis contributing to death. At the same time, V. cholerae impairs IPC
  growth pathways, although it is unclear how this affects symbiont-dependent growth
  responses (indicated with a question mark). Finally, the host IMD pathway contributes
  to pathogenesis by impairing IPC growth, and possibly by affecting epithelial turnover
  (indicated by a question mark).
