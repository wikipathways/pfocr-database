caption: (A) It has been proposed in L5 of visual cortex () that postsynaptic action
  potentials trigger the release of endocannabinoids in a mechanism similar to short-term
  depression caused during depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition. When
  presynaptic activity follows this cannabinoid release in a short time window, it
  coincidently activates preNMDARs and presynaptic CB1 receptors to trigger LTD induction.

  Red, pathway for VSCC- and calcium-dependent cannabinoid synthesis. Purple, potential
  synergistic pathways that increase cannabinoid production in response to appropriately
  timed pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Presynaptic NMDARs play a modulatory role in
  LTD in this hypothesis. Schematic based on data in .
