caption: Schematic illustration of signaling pathways involved in PDGF-mediated induction
  of Arc expression. After binding of PDGF to its cognate receptor-tyrosine kinase,
  there was an increase in intracellular calcium via either the influx of extracellular
  calcium or through the release of intracellular sources from the ER. Arc induction,
  however, is dependent only on the calcium released from the ER and not through the
  influx of extracellular calcium. PDGF can also result in activation of the MAPK/ERK
  pathway leading to downstream Arc expression. Both the pathways increased intracellular
  calcium, and the MAPK/ERK pathways converge downstream at the Egr-1 activation step,
  resulting in its nuclear translocation and subsequent binding to the Arc/Arg3.1
  promoter, resulting in gene transcription. THA, thapsigargin.
