caption: The canonical pathway of alternative macrophage activation involves activation
  of STAT6 by the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and -13. STAT6 activation initiates a transcriptional
  program comprising both immunologic effector responses and metabolic adaptations
  necessary to sustain them. Among the metabolic targets of STAT6 are PPARγ and δ
  as well as related coactivator PGC-1β. The transcriptional synergy between these
  metabolic regulators and STAT6 serves to sustain the immune effector response as
  well as direct metabolic adaptation for oxidative metabolism.
