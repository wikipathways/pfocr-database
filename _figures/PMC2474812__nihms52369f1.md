caption: The classical and back-door pathways of androgen biosynthesis. In the classical
  pathway (solid gray arrow), C21 precursors (pregnenolone and progesterone) are converted
  to the C19 adrenal androgens dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione (AED)
  by the sequential hydroxylase and lyase activities of CYP17A1. Circulating adrenal
  androgens (including the sulfated form of DHEA, DHEA-S), enter the prostate and
  can be converted to testosterone by a series of reactions involving the activity
  of HSD3B, HSD17B and AKR1C enzymes. Testosterone is then converted to the potent
  androgen DHT by the activity of SRD5A. In the back-door pathway to DHT synthesis
  (short gray arrows), C21 precursors are first acted upon by SRD5A and the reductive
  3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) activity of AKR1C family members, followed
  by conversion to C19 androgens via the lyase activity of CYP17A, and subsequently
  to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the action of HSD17B3 and an oxidative 3α-HSD enzyme.
