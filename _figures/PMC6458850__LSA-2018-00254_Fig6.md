caption: (A) A proposed model for the role of CXXC5 in the growth plate. With pubertal
  progression, estrogen, which increases during sexual maturation, induces CXXC5 expression
  and subsequently inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, resulting in growth plate senescence.
  (B) A working model of KY19382 for the stimulation of longitudinal bone growth.
  In activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling, KY19382 functions as a dual-targeting compound
  by 1) inactivating GSK3β and 2) inhibiting CXXC5–DVL interaction, which results
  in the delaying of growth plate senescence and the promotion of longitudinal bone
  growth. PPI, protein–protein interaction.
