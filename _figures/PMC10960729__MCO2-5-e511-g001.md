caption: 'Tumor suppression and promotion of the cGAS–STING signaling pathway. Tumor
  suppression: in tumor cells, the genomic DNA exposure caused by genomic instability,
  mutation or deletion of tumor suppressor genes, oxidative stress, and metabolic
  disorders, and the mitochondrial DNA leakage caused by radiotherapy, chemotherapy,
  and oxidative stress, can all activate the cGAS–STING signal in the cytoplasm. In
  addition, cGAS–STING signal can promote mitochondria‐mediated apoptosis and SASP‐induced
  cell senescence. More importantly, IFN‐I promotes the maturation of DCs by binding
  to receptors. Then, mature DCs that have engulfed tumor antigens contact CD8+ T
  cells and promote the generation of tumor antigen‐specific CTLs to eliminate tumor
  cells directly. In addition, the phagocytosis of tumor cell DNA by DCs and the transfer
  of cGAMP from tumor cells to DCs can both activate STING‐dependent antitumor immune
  response. Tumor promotion: carcinogen DMBA and chronic BRCA2 inactivation lead to
  genomic DNA fragmentation, triggering the activation of the cGAS–STING signal, which
  induces a chronic inflammatory response and eventually leads to tumorigenesis. Moreover,
  the low antigenicity of tumor cells induce tolerogenic immune response via the STING
  signaling pathway and promote tumor development. In addition, cGAMP enters astrocytes
  through the gap junction formed by CX43 to activate STING signaling pathway and
  induce the production of TNF‐α and IFN‐α, activating the NF‐κB and STAT1 signaling
  pathways in tumor cells to promote tumor cell metastasis. BRCA2, breast cancer susceptibility
