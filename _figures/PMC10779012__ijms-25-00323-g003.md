caption: Mechanisms by which pitavastatin and metformin act to (A) turn cancer cells
  sensitive to chemotherapy and (B) help to revert the exhaustion state of CD8+ T
  cells. The pitavastatin blocks drug efflux pumps and inhibits HMGCR, leading to
  a cascade of inhibition, including cholesterol biosynthesis. The uptake of cholesterol
  by the exhausted CD8+ T cells increases the stress of the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), leading to the augmented expression of transcription factor X-box binding
  protein 1 (XBP1), which increases the expression of inhibitory receptors (PD-1).
  The metformin inhibits the respiratory-chain complex 1, which mediates the activation
  of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits the mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream signaling pathways. This leads to
  increased T cell longevity and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. AMPK activation
  induces PPAR-gamma coactivator 1α (PGC1α), which increases mitochondrial activity
  and synergistically suppresses tumor growth by phosphorylation of programmed cell
  death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1). CD8+ T cells are immune active when they have the
  ligation MHC II with TCR/CD4; on the contrary, when they express the receptor PD-1,
  they are immune inactive. So, for example, using an antibody to PD-1 allows the
  inhibition of ligation to PD-1 with PDL-1, and the CD8+ T cell stays active. Figure
