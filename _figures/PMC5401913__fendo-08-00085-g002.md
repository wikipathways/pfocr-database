caption: Signaling pathways activated by peptides and amino acids involved in glucagon-like
  peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion and synthesis in enteroendocrine cells. Peptides from
  protein gastrointestinal digestion released in the lumen stimulate GLP-1 secretion
  via calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) or GPRC6A activation (1). In return, they activate
  a Gαq subunit that activates PLC- and IP3-dependent signaling pathways and provokes
  an intracellular Ca2+ increase. Activation of Ca2+ channels by CaSR or transient
  receptor potential channels enables Ca2+ uptake. Peptides may also activate proglucagon
  gene transcription via a cAMP-dependant pathway leading to CREB phosphorylation
  (2). Unknown pathways involved in GLP-1 secretion might involve ERK 1/2 phosphorylation
  or proton uptake coupled to peptide transport in PepT1 (3).
