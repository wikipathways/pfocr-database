caption: (a) Activating somatic mutations (i.e., p.Gly12Val and p.Gly12Asp) were detected
  in brain AVMs of human subjects and endothelial cell-enriched cell cultures derived
  from patients with brain AVMs. (b) Human umbilical-vein endothelial cells expressing
  KRAS4A derived from p.Gly12Val on KRAS specifically activate ERK (extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase)-MAPK signaling pathway, not PI3K (phosphoinositide 3 kinase)-AKT
  signaling pathway; (c) Over-expression of KRAS4Ap.Gly12Val induces the expression
  of several AVMs-related pathways, including Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition
  (EndoMT), Notch signaling, and VEGF signaling pathways, in human umbilical-vein
  endothelial cells. Furthermore, over-expression of KRAS4Ap.Gly12Val further enhances
  migratory behavior in human arterial endothelial cell lines, supporting mechanistically
  its activating roles triggering AVMs in human brain.
