caption: MetaCore enrichment pathway analysis of L-antigen 1 (LAGE1) co-expressed
  genes list in a breast cancer database. (A) In order to investigate potential gene
  networks and indicate pathways affected by the chosen genes, we exported LAGE1 co-expressed
  genes from TCGA and METABRIC breast cancer datasets to the MetaCore pathway analytical
  tool. (B) The “biology processes” analysis from MetaCore revealed that the “role
  of tumor-infiltrating B cells in the anti-tumor immunity-related pathway” was correlated
  with breast cancer development.
