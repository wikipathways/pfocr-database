caption: Simplified overview of the intracellular processing of Cbl and its intracellular
  metabolites adenosyl-Cbl and methyl-Cbl. In cblF and cblJ disease, liberation of
  Cbl from the lysosome and processing to the MMACHC gene product (cblC), which decyanides
  Cbl, fails. Depending on the locus of the mutation in the MMACHD gene, cblD disease
  may either affect the synthesis of both adenosyl-and methyl-Cbl or of only one of
  the pathways. Adenosyl-Cbl is the cofactor for intramitochondrial MMA metabolism
  by mutase and the cblA and cblB proteins. Methyl-Cbl is cofactor for the remethylation
  of Hcy to Met by MS (CblG) and MSR (cblE).*Main disorders in this pathway are gastric
  intrinsic factor deficiency (GIF), Imerslund Graesbeck syndrome (AMN; CUBN) and
  transcobalamin deficiency (TCN2).
