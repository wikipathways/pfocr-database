caption: 'H2 can protect H9c2 cells from H/R injury by inhibiting the Wnt/CX3CR1 signaling
  pathway.H2 can protect H9c2 cells from H/R injury, and its mechanism may involve
  inhibiting the activated Wnt/CX3CR1 signaling pathway and blocking oxidative stress,
  inflammatory cytokines, and inflammation-related factors. H2 inhibits H/R injury,
  alleviates morphological damage to H9c2 cells, and reduces the production of LDH.
  H2 can increase the activity of CAT, SOD, and GPx and reduce the production of MDA.
  H2 reduces the protein expression levels of IL-6, HMGB1, TNF-α, and TLR4 after H/R
  injury in H9c2 cells while also reducing the protein expression levels of β-catenin,
  GSK-3β, APC, Wnt, and CX3CR1. Created with Photoshop (CS6). APC: Adenomatous polyposis
