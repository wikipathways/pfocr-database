caption: Oxidative machinery of PMN-MDSC include MPO and superoxide produced by NADPH
  oxidase (NOX2) support the generation of a large variety of oxidized lipids. Oxidized
  fatty acids (oxFA) undergo esterification to triglycerides (TAG) and various phospholipids
  (PL). oxTAG can be transferred to DC where they undergo degradation and oxidatively
  truncated FA are then incorporated into LD. Electrophilic LD bind HSP70 and prevent
  the transfer to the cell surface of peptide-MHC class I complexes formed in lysosomes
  and endosomes during vacuolar pathway of cross-presentation; thus inhibiting cross-present
  tumor antigens by DC. Formation of LD containing oxFA can also be mediated by activation
  of ER stress and spliced XBP1. In PMN-MDSC, accumulation of oxidized lipids result
  in increased biosynthesis of PGE2 and plasmalogens leading to enhanced suppressive
  activity of these cells. Plasmalogens promote reactivation of dormant tumor cells.
  Oxidized LDL signal in PMN-MDSC and TAM via several receptors to potentiate suppressive
  activity of these cells, which include up-regulation of arginase 1, NO production,
  secretion of immune suppressive cytokines.
