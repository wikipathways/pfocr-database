caption: 'SARS-CoV 2 infection in pregnancy: hypothetical pathogenic pathways in endothelial
  cells. The figure represents all molecular pathogenic pathways tha may happen when
  SARS-CoV-2 infects endothelial cells in context of pregnancy, including the fetal-maternal
  interface endothelial cells. The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 human cell entry is possible
  as the Spike protein (S protein) on the envelope binds to the cell membrane glycoprotein
  angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) homolog 2 (ACE2), which is involved in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
  system (RAS). The S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2, which enhance ACE2 and TMPRSS2,
  respectively. The binding induces competitive inhibition, causing ACE2 downregulation
  and shedding, reducing Ang- 1–7 synthesis while shifting to an increase of ACE1
  activity, increasing Ang II and turning to vasoconstriction, inflammation and vascular
  permeability. After entering the cells, the viral RNA genome is released into the
  cytoplasm and is translated into polyproteins and structural proteins, after which
  the viral genome begins to replicate.The mature virion enters the endosome and interacts
  with toll-like receptors (TLR) from the immune cells to stimulate downstream inflammatory
  and clot pathways. The viral nuclear integration could induce protein expression
  in the infected cells that would contribute to enhance the inflammatory response
  and cell damage both directly and indirectly, increasing pro-coagulant tissue factor
  and inflammatory cell adhesion and attraction proteins (E-selectine, ICAM,VCAM),
  as well as reducing HO/CO or NOs that would contribute to vasocontriction, tissular
  hypoxia and underperfusion. The primarly inflammatory responses are driven by the
  innate immune system activation consisting in a massive invasion of neutrophils,
  monocytes and macrophages that release different proinflammatory cytokines and other
  proteins and molecules responsible to induce cell apoptosis and pyroptosis, leading
  to a different grade of tissue and organ damage. Simultaneoulsy, adaptive immune
  system comes on the scene through antigen-dependent lymphocyte activation by antigen
  presenting cells (APC) bearing viral antigenic peptides on human leukocyte antigens
  (HLA) molecules. APC-viral antigen complexes are recognized by virus-specific B
  and T cells (mainly CD8+) secreting, at different times, Th1 profile cytokines,
  which, reinforce previous inflammation, as well as Th2 adaptive humoral response
  by typical viral- induced pattern of neutralizing antibodies (Nab) IgM and IgG.
  In some cases, the appearance of Nab not only cannot limit viral replication, but
  trigger an hyperimmune response, owing to antibody dependent enhancement inflammatory
  pathways (ADE) that perpetuate responses from macrophages and Th1-lymphocyte, releasing
  a cytokine storm composed by IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2,IL-6, IL-12, IL-8, TNF-α
  etc. and more pro-inflammatory proteins like monocyte chemoattractant protein 1
  (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1α), or MMP(tissue matrix metalloprotease).
  Additionally, these secondary inflammatory responses include antibody-dependent
  cell-mediated cytotoxicity, Ag-Ab immuncomplexes-mediated inflammatory pathways,
  including transient aPL-, and complement pathway hyperactivation that contributes
  to increasing tissue damage and hypoxia by releasing antiagiogenic factors (sFLT-1,
  sENG) and inducing platelet aggregation and clot cascade hiperactivation leading
  to thrombotic events'
