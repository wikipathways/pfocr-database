caption: 'Transcriptional network motifs. Complex transcription networks are made
  out of simple network motifs (, ): patterns that recur throughout the network much
  more frequently than in randomized networks. Each of the network motif circuits
  has a defined information processing role. The feed-forward loop circuit (a), which
  appears in hundreds of systems from bacteria to humans, acts as a persistence detector
  () (b): it filters out short input pulses and responds only to persistent signals.
  The single-input module (c) can generate temporal expression programs. It allows
  serial expression of genes by means of differential activation thresholds by the
  master regulator (d). The single-input module in the arginine biosynthesis system
  of E. coli (e) was experimentally found to generate a temporal order of genes by
  means of high-resolution expression measurement employing fluorescent reporter strains
  (). Strikingly, the temporal order corresponds to the order of the gene products
  in the metabolic pathway: the closer the gene to the beginning of the pathway, the
  earlier its expression. Thus, evolution uses a just in time production strategy,
  similar to engineering principles of production pipelines. (Figure kindly provided
