caption: The main approaches for the synthesis of biguanides. The core structure is
  obtained via the addition of amines to cyanoguanidines (pathway a), dicyanamides
  (pathway b), carbamide (pathway c) or N1-cyano-S-methylisothioureas (pathway d),
  and by the addition of guanidines to carbodiimides (pathway e), cyanamides (pathway
  f) or (iso)(thio)ureas derivatives (pathways g and h).
