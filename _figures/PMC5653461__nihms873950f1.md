caption: Prolactin and progesterone are important regulators of STAT proteins. Prolactin-induced
  activation of PRLR triggers several signaling cascades. For example, signaling to
  JAK2 kinase activates STAT5. Activation of the MAPK pathway can also lead to activation
  of STATs through PRLR. Progestin-induced activation of PR leads to activation of
  PR genes that include the downstream components of the PRLR signaling pathway (e.g.
  STAT5a). In addition, progesterone enhances prolactin-mediated stimulation of STAT
  activation in part through the JAK2 and MAPK pathways. Progesterone-induced activation
  of c-Src also provides a hormone-induced input to PRLR (i.e. via STAT phosphorylation)
  signaling.
