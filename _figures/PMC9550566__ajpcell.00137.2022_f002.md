caption: Hypothesis to explain how nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids act through KATP
  and/or large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (BKCa) channels to regulate the
  lymphatic pacemaking cycle. KATP channel activation slows the diastolic depolarization
  rate of the ionic pacemaker in lymphatic smooth muscle (LSM). In rat, KATP channel
  activity is stimulated by the NO-sGC-cGMP-PKG signaling axis; in mouse, the same
  pathway activates BKCa rather than KATP channels, but produces similar slowing of
  diastolic depolarization. Although cGMP production is associated with NO-mediated
  activation of KATP channels, the increased channel activity may be mediated either
  by channel phosphorylation by PKG or through cross-activation of PKA. Prostanoid
  production leads to increased cAMP levels that also activate PKA. AC, adenylate
  cyclase; ANO1, anoctamin1; AP, action potential; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase; iNOS, inducible NO synthase; sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase; VGCC, voltage-gated
  channel; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor.
