caption: A. HH Pathway. Binding of HH ligands (SHH, DHH or IHH) to PTCH receptors
  relieves PTCH-mediated inhibition of SMO. SMO inhibits PKA, GSK3β, and SUFU from
  binding to GLI, allowing for stabilization of the activator confirmation, translocation
  to the nucleus and activation of HH target genes. The monoclonal antibody, 5E1,
  binds to SHH and prevents its binding to PTCH receptors. Cyclopamine binds to, and
  prevents, SMO-mediated activation of GLI transcription factors. GANT61 reduces GLI
  transcription factor DNA binding to block GLI-mediated HH target gene expression.
  B. WNT pathway. Binding of WNT ligands to the receptor FZD results in translocation
  of DVL to the membrane. DVL binds to the APC/GSK3β/AXIN complex, leading to its
  dissociation from β-CATENIN. β-CATENIN is released and stabilized, allowing for
  translocation to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of target genes.
  The antibody Vantictumab binds to FZD and prevents WNT ligand binding. LGK974, ETC159,
  C59 and IWP inhibit PORCN-mediated processing and secretion of WNT ligands that
  activate the canonical pathway. C. Notch pathway. During canonical signaling, NOTCH
  receptors on one cell bind to ligand receptors on another cell, after which the
  NOTCH receptor is cleaved by the protease complex, γ-SECRETASE, leading to release
  of the NOTCH Intracellular Domain (NOTCH-ICD). NOTCH-ICD translocates to the nucleus
  to activate transcription of target genes. Compound E functions to block the cleavage
  of both γ-secretase and NOTCH-ICD, preventing NOTCH-ICD translocation to the nucleus.
