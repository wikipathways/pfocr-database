  step was calculated by adding the amounts of precursor metabolites downstream of
  the metabolic step to make 1 g of biomass. In the resulting flux distribution, the
  amount of NADPH produced (4.319 mmol) was much smaller than that required to make
  1 g of biomass (18.225 mmol). The shortage was covered by the uptake of additional
  (1.159 mmol) glucose and metabolizing it through the pentose phosphate pathway.
