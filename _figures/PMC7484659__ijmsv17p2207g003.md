caption: A schematic model illustrates the neuroprotective effects of THSG on STS-induced
  toxicity by restoring BNDF-TrkB/Akt signaling axis and inhibiting apoptosis. In
  hippocampal neurons, STS down-regulated the expression of BDNF, inhibited TrkB/Akt
  signaling axis, activated apoptosis-promoting enzyme Caspase-3 and ultimately resulted
  in neuron apoptosis and death. However, THSG rescued the expression of BDNF, reactivated
  BDNF-TrkB/Akt signaling pathway, antagonistically restored the biochemistry of Caspase-3
  and Bcl-2, and finally promoted cell survival.
