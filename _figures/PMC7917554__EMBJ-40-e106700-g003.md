caption: Pyroptotic cell death can be induced by various stimuli that activate inflammasome.
  The activation of NLRP3 prompts its binding to ASC and caspase‐1 forming the inflammasome.
  Caspase‐1 processes pro‐IL‐1β and pro‐IL‐18 to their active forms. In parallel,
  caspase‐1 cleaves GSDMD separating the inhibitory C‐ and active N‐terminal domains.
  GSDMD‐N then translocates to the membrane inducing cell lysis and cytokine release.
  Non‐canonical inflammasome activation consists of priming which induces expression
  of several pathway genes (caspase‐11). Intracellular LPS can be sensed by caspase‐11
  leading to its activation and processing of GSDMD and caspase‐1. Cell lysis can
  then also activate canonical inflammasome signaling. Green arrows indicate upregulation
  by gene expression, while black arrows indicate interactions/cleavage events or
  inhibition.
