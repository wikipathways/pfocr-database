caption: The role of the HBP and protein O-linked GlcNAc conjugation in the regulation
  of Drosophila physiology. Schematic presentation of the HBP (A) and the known processes
  regulated by protein O-linked GlcNAc conjugation (B). (A) HBP competes for F-6-P
  with PFK, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. In the first and rate-limiting
  step of HBP, GFAT conjugates an amine group from glutamine to the F-6-P yielding
  GlcN-6-P and glutamate. In the following step, GNPNAT conjugates the acetyl group
  from acetyl-CoA to yield GlcNAc-6-P, which is then isomerized to GlcNAc-1-P by PGM3.
  Finally, UDP is conjugated to the GlcNAc-1-P by UAP1 to yield UDP-GlcNAc, which
  is a substrate for macromolecule glycosylation and chitin biosynthesis. Hence, HBP
  integrates inputs from glucose (G-6-P), amino acid (glutamine), fatty acid (acetyl-CoA)
  and energy (UDP) metabolism, making it a sensor of cellular nutrient and energy
  metabolism. N-linked glycosylation, covalent attachment of an oligosaccharide to
  asparagine residues, is a mechanism of protein maturation and trafficking between
  cell compartments. The UDP-GlcNAc polymer, also known as chitin, is the key component
  of Drosophila exoskeleton. (B) O-linked GlcNAcylation is a transient protein post-translational
  modification mechanism, which targets threonine and serine residues. O-linked GlcNAcylation
  is mediated by the activities of OGT and OGA to conjugate and deconjugate glucosamine,
  respectively. O-linked GlcNAcylation can compete, enhance, or attenuate protein
  phosphorylation, making it an important mechanism to regulate protein activity.
  In Drosophila, the activity of OGT is known to be involved in maintenance of chromatin
  state, in regulating larval growth through insulin signaling, and in regulating
  the maintenance of circadian rhythm. F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate;
