caption: Working model depicting how light perception at the apex initiates an auxin-
  and redox-dependent systemic signaling pathway leading to enhanced rates of photosynthetic
  induction in distal leaves. In this model,  light perceived by phyB and  light perceived
  by phyA function antagonistically to regulate  biosynthesis. As a result of light
  perception-driven ,  triggers systemic H2O2 production in distal leaves, which is
  able to accelerate  around PSI, leading to increased ATP production. In this way,
  light perception by the apex can enhance photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and the
  resultant carbon gain in distal leaves.
