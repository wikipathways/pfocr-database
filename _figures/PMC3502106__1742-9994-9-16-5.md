caption: 'Figure 8: Feed-forward signaling in which FGF-9 controls Wnt-2a expression
  and mesenchymal Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and in which mesenchymal Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling is requisite for mesenchymal FGFR expression and mesenchymal responsiveness
  to FGF-9. In absence of either FGF-9 or canonical Wnt ligands, the mesenchymal FGF-9-Wnt/β-catenin
  feed-forward network breaks up, occasioning loss of mesenchymal FGFR expression
  and FGF responsiveness. Wnt/β-catenin signaling has to be preserved in order to
  induce or maintain FGFR expression, FGF-9 responsiveness, and continuance of FGF-Wnt/β-catenin
  feed-forward signaling. Loss of mesenchymal FGF-Wnt/β-catenin signaling increases
  Noggin expression in both the subepithelial and submesothelial mesenchyme. Lack
  of either pathway decreases mesenchymal proliferation. The change in the density
  of the shading of the epithelium shows the proximal-distal extent of the lung bud.

  Langhe et al. [], and Ornitz and Yin []. Modified after Ornitz and Yin [].'
