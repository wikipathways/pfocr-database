caption: Mechanisms of resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy. V600E and KIAA1549-BRAF
  fusion lead to constitutive activation of MAPK signaling in tumor cells. MAPK phosphorylates
  downstream nuclear effectors that ultimately enhance cell survival and proliferation.
  One recognized mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibition is the upregulation of
  CRAF, which activates MAPK through MEK. Concurrent inhibition of MEK overcomes this
  resistance. Both RAF and MEK inhibition, as well as EGFR gain-of-function mutation
  contribute to amplification of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that represents another
  mechanism of resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy. EGF epidermal growth factor, EGFR
  epidermal growth factor receptor, MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase, MEK MAPK
  kinase, mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin, PI3K phosphoinositide 3-kinase, RAS
