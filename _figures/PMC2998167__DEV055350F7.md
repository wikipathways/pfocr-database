caption: Model of SAM-10 signaling pathway. SAM-10 is translocated into the nucleus
  in an LDB-1-dependent manner. In the nucleus, SAM-10 regulates PLM synaptic differentiation
  and neurite branch positioning, presumably by regulating gene expression. SAM-10
  regulation of synaptic differentiation is mediated at least partially by suppressing
  prk-2 transcription.
