caption: Model depicting PD-L1 regulation and mechanism of immune tolerance in DLBCL.
  In PD-L1+ B-cell lymphoma cells, BCR-mediated NFATc1 activation upregulates IL-10
  chemokine expression. Released IL-10 activates the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, leading to
  STAT3-induced PD-L1 expression. IL-10 antagonist antibody abrogates IL-10/STAT3
  signaling and PD-L1 protein expression. BCR pathway inhibition by BTK inhibitors
  (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and BGB-3111) blocks NFATc1 and STAT3 activation, resulting
  in inhibition of IL-10 and PD-L1 expression. Downregulation of IL-10/PD-L1 signaling
  could potentially release the immune tolerance brake, allowing anergic T cells to
  become activated CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and target and destroy tumor cells. This
  immune tolerance mechanism also could be controlled and regulated by the tumor microenvironment
  via tumor-associated macrophages that are recruited by the tumor cells through CCL3
  and CXCL10 chemokines.
