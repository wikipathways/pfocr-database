caption: 'A, Our model is that APC mutations selectively activate the β-catenin branch
  of WNT signaling downstream of GSK3. Thus, the ability of GSK3 to phosphorylate
  a large number of cellular proteins, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation,
  is unperturbed (WNT/STOP off). This degradation serves as a catabolic source of
  free asparagine, which prevents asparaginase-induced tumor death. Asparaginase structure
  is from PDB: 2HIM.B, In R-spondin fusion CRC, WNT signaling is activated upstream
  of GSK3, which results in activation of both the WNT/β-catenin and the WNT-dependent
  stabilization of proteins (WNT/STOP) branches of this pathway. Activation of WNT/STOP
  inhibits protein degradation, limiting cellular asparagine availability, and triggering
  a unique vulnerability to its enzymatic degradation by asparaginase. Thus, asparaginase
  therapy induces tumor death in R-spondin fusion CRC. In APC-mutant CRC, selective
  inhibition of GSK3α phenocopies this effect.'
