caption: Visual depiction of KEGG Plant–Pathogen Interaction Pathways. The visual
  depiction summarizes the major signaling pathways obtained from KEGG representing
  the plant cell interaction with fungal pathogen. Two major pathways were studied
  for gene expression analysis. The first pathway is the PAMP-triggered immunity pathway
  (Cf9, CDPK, RBO, and ROS). The second pathway involves CDPKs, CaM/CMLs, CNGCs, and
  WRKY transcription factors. In this study, maize genes were selected from CDPK,
  RBO, CaM/CML, CNGC, and WRKY gene families.
