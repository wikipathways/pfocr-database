caption: Diagram of central metabolic pathway. Boxes indicate substrates, and enzymes
  are next to arrows. Single arrows indicate nonreversible reactions and double arrows
  are reversible reactions. Dashed arrows indicate multiple enzymatic steps. Enzymes
  in red are downregulated and green enzymes are upregulated under desiccating conditions.
  Parentheses indicate the fold expression difference associated with a desiccating
  environment.
