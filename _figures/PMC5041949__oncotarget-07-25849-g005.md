caption: A schematic representation of TRPV4-mediated mechanical signaling in normal
  and TRPV4KO/TRPV4-deficient (tumor) endothelial cells. In normal endothelial cells,
  TRPV4 senses mechanical force (ECM stiffness) and induces optimal Rho/Rho kinase
  activation necessary for endothelial migration and contraction which is required
  for partial cell rounding and angiogenesis. However, absence (TRPV4KO EC) or reduction
  (Tumor EC) in TRPV4 expression and function results in high basal Rho/Rho kinase
  activation, leading to abnormal (tumor) angiogenesis. This abnormal tumor vasculature
  can be normalized by restoring mechanosensitivity through pharmacological activation
  of TRPV4 in tumor endothelial cells (TRPV4-deficient) with GSK1016790A or inhibition
  of Rho kinase in TRPV4KO EC with Y-27632. Overall, these findings suggest that targeting
  TRPV4/Rho kinase-mediated mechanotransduction may be a novel therapy for tumor vascular
  normalization and improving anti-cancer drug delivery.
