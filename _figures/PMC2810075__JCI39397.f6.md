caption: (A) Potential IL-8/CXCR1 cell signaling in CSCs. CXCR1 activation upon IL-8
  binding induces FAK phosphorylation. Active FAK phosphorylates AKT and activates
  the WNT pathway, which regulates stem cell self-renewal and FOXO3A that regulates
  cell survival. Activation of FAK protects CSCs from a FASL/FAS-mediated bystander
  effect by inhibiting FADD, a downstream effector of FAS signaling. In the presence
  of chemotherapy, only the bulk tumor cells are sensitive to the treatment and release
  a high level of IL-8 and FASL proteins during the apoptotic process. Breast CSCs
  are stimulated via an IL-8–mediated bystander effect and are resistant to the bystander
  killing effect mediated by FASL. TCF, T cell factor. (B) Repertaxin treatment blocks
  IL-8/CXCR1 signaling and inhibits breast CSC self-renewal and survival. When repertaxin
  treatment is combined with chemotherapy, the CSCs are sensitized to the bystander
  killing effect mediated by FASL.
