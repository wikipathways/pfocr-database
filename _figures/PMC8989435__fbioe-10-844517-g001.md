  The dashed lines represent the synthetic method from d-glucose to d-arabinose. The
  synthetic pathway of BT and branch pathways are marked by solid lines. The red Xs
  indicate that the genes are knocked out and enzymes shown in red indicate that these
  enzymes have been chosen for the production of BT from d-arabinose after screening.
