caption: BGLF4 induces premature chromosome condensation through activation of condensin
  and Topo II. The prophase-like chromosomes may cause abnormal DNA structure and
  micronucleus formation. In addition, BGLF4 elicits DNA damage signaling by phosphorylating
  TIP60. TIP60 is a histone acetyltransferase that regulates chromatin remodeling
  and the DNA damage response (DDR). Upon DNA double-stranded breakage, ATM kinase
  is acetylated by TIP60. The acetylation of ATM is essential for its autophosphorylation
  and activation. Therefore, BGLF4 is able to turn on DNA damage signaling in a TIP60/Chk2-dependent
  manner. Here we found that the exogenous expression of BGLF4 induces RB hyperphosphorylation
  at Ser780 and Ser612, which is an indicator of DNA damage signaling activation.
  Based on our observation that the RB-E2F1 complex does not dissociate and the E2F1-downstream
  cyclin D1 promoter and ZBRK1 activities are repressed upon BGLF4 expression, we
  propose that BGLF4-induced RB phosphorylation may be a downstream event of DDR.
  Because the DNA damage pathway is necessary for efficient EBV replication, BGLF4-induced
  RB phosphorylation is favorable for lytic cycle progression, while cellular DNA
  synthesis is blocked.
