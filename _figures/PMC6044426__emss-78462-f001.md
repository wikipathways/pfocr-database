caption: N-linked glycosylation pathway. GFPT1, glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase
  1; DPAGT1, dolichyl-phosphate (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase
  1. Cytoplasmic glucose is the initial substrate in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  which comprises multiple reactions catalysed by different enzymes of which GFPT1
  is key. A major product of this pathway is UDP-GlcNAc (or UDP-N-acetylglucosamine),
  an essential substrate for N-linked protein glycosylation. DPAGT1 catalyses the
  first committed step of N-linked glycosylation in which phosphorylated UDP-GlcNAc
  from cytoplasmic UDP-GlcNAc is added to a transmembrane lipid carrier, dolichol
  phosphate. The core glycan is assembled by successive addition of individual sugar
  residues (mannose and glucose) with each step catalysed by a different enzyme. During
  assembly the oligosaccharide is transported across the membrane to the endoplasmic
  reticulum interior where further sugar residues are added. Once fully assembled,
  the core glycan is released from dolichol ready to be transferred to an N-linked
  glycosylation site on nascent protein.
