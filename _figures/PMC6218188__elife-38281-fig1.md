caption: (A) In the primary pathway, rod signals are routed through dedicated rod
  bipolar cells to AII amacrine cells. AII amacrine cells in turn transmit ‘On’ signals
  to On cone bipolar cells through dendro-axonal gap junctions and ‘Off’ signals to
  Off cone bipolar cells through glycinergic synapses. Cone bipolar signals are subsequently
  transmitted to retinal ganglion cells. (B) In the secondary pathway, rod transmit
  signals via gap junctions to cone axons, and hence the associated cone circuitry
  (; ; ; ). (C) In the tertiary pathway, rods transmit signals directly to Off cone
  bipolar cell dendrites (; ; ). Plus and minus signs represent sign-conserving and
  sign-inverting synapses.
