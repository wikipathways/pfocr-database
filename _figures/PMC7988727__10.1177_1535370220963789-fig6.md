caption: Hypothetical scheme of I3C effect on the inflammation process induced by
  hyperoxia–hypoxia cycles. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) can induce the inflammation
  process through its receptor, TNFR1, which mediates the association of some adaptor
  proteins, such as TRADD or TRAF2, which, in turn, initiate the recruitment of signal
  transducers. TNFR1 signaling activates several genes controlled by the NF-κB pathway.
  Protein names in dark gray boxes (VEGF, MCP1, TIMP1, L-selectin, and TNFα) were
  upregulated, whereas genes in light gray boxes (fractalkine, MMP-8, and IL-6) were
  downregulated by I3C. Adapted from https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/highlight_pathway?scale=1.0&map=map04668&keyword=TNF%20cytokines
