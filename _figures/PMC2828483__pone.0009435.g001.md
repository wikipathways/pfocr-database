caption: 5-amino-6-ribitylaminouracil (A) and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate
  (B) are condensed to give 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (lumazine) (C) by lumazine
  synthase (LS) during the penultimate step of the riboflavin biosynthesis. Riboflavin
  (D) is finally synthesized by riboflavin synthase (RS) which condensates two molecules
  of lumazine to yield one molecule of riboflavin and recycle one molecule of 5-amino-6-ribitylaminouracil
  into the pathway. B. abortus has two LSs, RibH1 and RibH2 which are Type-I and Type-II
  LSs respectively.
