caption: The Jak2-Stat5 signaling cascade involves stimulation of the prolactin receptor
  (PrlR) followed by transphosphorylation and activation of receptor – associated
  kinase Jak2. Stat5a/b is recruited to the active receptor through its SH2 domain.
  Following Jak2-mediated Stat5a/b phosphorylation, active Stat5a/b forms a dimer
  and translocates to the nucleus. The Stat5a/b dimer recognizes and binds GAS elements
  (TTC(C/T)N(G/A)GAA) on the DNA, initiating transcription of target genes. In human
  prostate cancer cells, active Stat5a/b transcriptionally synergizes, physically
  interacts, and enhances nuclear localization of active androgen receptor (AR).
