caption: A model of TRAF6 regulation by arginine methylation. In the basal state TRAF6
  is associated with PRMT1, methylated, and inactive (State 1). TLR ligands activate
  TRAF6 and induce PRMT1 degradation. Reduction of PRMT1 levels allows JMJD6 to demethylate
  TRAF6 and results in the transition to a fully active form (State 2) leading to
  maximal NF-κB activation. The NF-κB-driven accumulation of inhibitory molecules,
  such as IRAK-3, eventually produces feedback inhibition reducing pathway activation.
  This allows the re-accumulation of PRMT1. Restoration of the PRMT1/JMJD6 ratio results
  in the re-methylation of TRAF6 and the return to the basal, inactive state.
