  (LL), no quenching occurs. II. In high light (HL), protonation of PsbS and other
  LHC proteins occurs accompanied by a change in the fluorescence lifetime to 1.6
  ns. III. Binding of zeaxanthin and protons leads to the formation of a quenching
  complex with altered conformation detectable as an absorbance change at 535 nm and
  with a faster 0.4-ns fluorescence lifetime component. IV. Upon a shift from high
  to low light, deprotonation occurs faster than epoxydation of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin.

  State transitions. In state I, the plastoquinone pool is oxidized, and the mobile
  part of LHCII (dark green) is associated with PSII. After excitation with 650-nm
  light that is preferentially absorbed by LHCII, a transition to state II occurs:
  the plastoquinone pool (PQ) is reduced and activation of the LHCII kinase occurs
  through the cytochrome b6f complex leading to the phosphorylation of LHCII. The
  phosphorylated mobile part of LHCII is displaced from PSII and reconnected to PSI.
  Excitation with 700-nm light preferentially absorbed by LHCI oxidizes the plastoquinone
  pool, triggering a transition from state II to state I. The LHCII kinase is inactivated,
  and a phosphatase dephosphorylates LHCII, which moves back to PSII. In Chlamydomonas,
  a switch from linear to cyclic electron flow occurs upon transition from state I
  to state II.'
