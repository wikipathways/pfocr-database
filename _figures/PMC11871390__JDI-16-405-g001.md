caption: Mechanism of interleukin‐37 promoting wound healing. In the condition of
  diabetes, MAPK(P38/Erk)‐mediated inflammatory signaling pathway is activated in
  skin wounds, promoting the activation of pro‐inflammatory signaling pathways such
  as NF‐κB/ NOD‐like receptor signaling pathway, increasing the secretion of inflammatory
  factor IL‐1β TNF‐ɑ, and aggravating local inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory
  response. By inhibiting the activation of MAPK/NOD‐like receptor signaling pathway,
  IL‐37 inhibits the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, alleviates inflammatory
  response, and promotes wound healing
