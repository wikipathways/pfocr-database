caption: 'SMAD2 serves as an activator of the TGFβ pathway, and SMAD4 serves as a
  nuclear translocator. The mRNA transcripts of these genes are both predicted targets
  of miR-574–5p, and their dysregulation within the placenta may impact various TGFβ-controlled
  processes in endothelial cells throughout gestation, including: neovascularization,
  angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, and overall
  placentation. Adapted from “TGFb Signaling Pathway”, by BioRender.com (2019). Retrieved
