caption: Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) is a central transcription agent
  in mediating Warburg-type metabolism within diseased cells. HIF-1α is part of an
  oxygen sensing system which becomes activated when the partial pressure (pO2) of
  intracellular oxygen becomes depressed, that is, when cells become hypoxic. A primary
  means by which HIF-1α promotes Warburg-type metabolism is by upregulating the mitochondrial
  enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase which, in turn, inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex thereby reducing the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A in the
  mitochondria. The reduction of acetyl coenzyme A in the mitochondrial severely restricts
  the intramitochondrial synthesis of melatonin (see ). Further, HIF-1α promotes the
  pentose phosphate pathway (see ) and upregulates glycolysis by stimulating the glucose
  transporter (GLUT1), which accelerates the influx of glucose (the “sweet tooth”
  phenomenon), and promoting the efflux of lactate by stimulating the monocarboxylate
  transporter 4 (MCT4) which also stimulates neovasculogenesis by upregulating vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Melatonin, by directly or indirectly inhibiting
  HIF-1α, reverses the Warburg effect and prevents the associated metabolic activities.
  Reactive oxygen species, which are produced more abundantly under hypoxic conditions,
  aid in the stabilization of HIF-1α.
