caption: Physiology and pathophysiology of copper transport and metabolism. Under
  physiological conditions (left panel), copper uptake in hepatocytes is initiated
  by the high affinity Ctr1 from the apical side. In the cytosol, copper binds to
  the chaperon ATOX1 that handles copper to ATP7B as transporter into the trans-Golgi
  network (TGN). There it is incorporated into apoceruloplasmin and released as copper
  loaded ceruloplasmin via vesicular export at the basolateral plasma membrane into
  the blood stream. As alternative pathway, the non-ceruloplasmin copper is secreted
  by exocytosis and via ATP7B at the canalicular membrane to bile. Non-transported
  copper is intermittently stored in cytosol within metallothionein. In Wilson disease
  (right panel), functional ATP7B is missing resulting in backing-up of copper in
  cytosol. When the metallothionein binding capacity is exceeded, the copper overspill
  is covered in lysosomes which eventually burst under the burden of generated free
  radicals. It induces cell injury and release of free copper to blood.
