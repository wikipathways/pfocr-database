caption: 'The renalase pathway and beyond: mechanisms of action of renalase. According
  to the classical renalase pathway (indicated in the figure using green arrows),
  catecholamines trigger the synthesis and secretion of inactive prorenalase, which
  upon entering the circulation is activated to renalase either by a brief surge in
  catecholamine levels or by an increase in blood pressure. The catabolism of catecholamines
  to aminochromes by activated renalase affects the sympathetic nervous system, resulting
  in a decrease in sympathetic tone. It thereby leads to a drop in cardiac contractility
  and heart rate and eventually a decrease in blood pressure. However, this theory
  has been disproved by various research groups. The alternate mechanisms through
  which renalase may exert a hypotensive effect can be via two different mechanisms.
  a The activated renalase binds to its receptor, PMCA4b, in an organ (viz. kidney),
  which by some unknown mechanism facilitates a decrease in sympathetic tone leading
  to a drop in cardiac contractility and heart rate, finally resulting in a decrease
  in blood pressure (indicated in the figure using red arrows). b Renalase, by virtue
  of its oxidase property, converts β-NAD(P)H isomers to H2O2 and β-NAD(P)+ which
  might exert vasodilatory effects and reduce blood pressure (indicated in the figure
  using blue arrows). Dotted lines indicate pathways that require experimental confirmation.
