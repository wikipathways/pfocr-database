caption: A model for regulation of LTP induction in the hippocampus by NRG1-ErbB4
  signaling through suppressing Src enhancement of NMDARs. The cartoon illustrates
  induction of LTP by theta burst stimulations under physiological conditions (right),
  suppressed NRG1-ErbB4 signaling (top) and enhanced NRG1-signaling (bottom). Under
  physiological conditions, the NRG1-ErbB4 pathway is a partial brake on the induction
  of LTP as genetic or pharmacological suppression of this pathway increases the magnitude
  of the potentiation. Gain-of-function of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling may block induction
  of LTP.
