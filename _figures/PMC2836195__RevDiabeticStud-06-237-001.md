caption: The figure shows the molecular pathway of mitochondrial biogenesis. The two
  major initial events are transcription and replication of mitochondrial DNA. These
  events are the pre-requisite for ATP production to fulfill the energy requirements
  of tissue cells. This is exactly controlled by sequential events in response to
  environmental or oxidative stress. The activation of the nuclear transcriptional
  coactivator-PGC-1α gene by these signals triggers the next step in the process.
  PGC-1α, acting as a coactivator, binds to the corresponding nuclear genes to help
  the translation of a series of nuclear DNA-encoded respiratory enzymes and mitochondrial
  transcription factors A (Tfam) and B (mTFB). The latter two proteins are also cooperatively
  transcribed by specific nuclear respiratory factors (NRF-1 and 2). These factors
  are then imported into the mitochondrial matrix to activate further processes.
