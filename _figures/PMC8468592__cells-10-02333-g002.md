caption: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway. APCs present antigens released from tumor
  cells to T cells, leading to T cell activation and PD-1 expression. PD-1 binds PD1-L1/2
  expressed on the surface of both APCs and tumor cells, leading to inhibition of
  TCR and CD28 signaling. This results in an inhibition of cell proliferation, activation,
  and differentiation. Th-1 and Th-17 differentiation is inhibited, while Tregs are
  increased. The upregulation of PTEN participates in the latter.
