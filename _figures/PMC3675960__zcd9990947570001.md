caption: Causal association of microbial interaction with HIV-1 latency and AIDS progression.
  HIV-1 infection weakens the immune system, making the body susceptible to opportunistic
  pathogens. CD4+ T cell depletion leads to impaired mucosal epithelial barrier integrity,
  allowing microbial translocation. The influx of circulating microbial products is
  associated with a systemic hyperimmune activation (e.g., through the TLR–NF-κB pathway)
  that may aggravate HIV-1 disease and enhance its progression. Recently, the bacterial
  metabolite butyric acid, which is produced under anaerobic conditions, has been
  shown to reactivate latent HIV-1 by promoting dissociation of the HDAC1–AP-4 repressor
  complex and hyperacetylation of histones, indicating its potential involvement in
  the progression of AIDS (see text for details). HATs, histone acetyltransferases;
  Me, methyl; Ac, acetyl; LPS, lipopolysaccharide.
