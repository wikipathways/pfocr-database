caption: The SARS-CoV2 life cycle in host cells. SARS-CoV 2 starts its life cycle
  by biding the S protein to the ACE2 receptor. After receptor binding, the endosomal
  pathway facilitates the viral envelope fusion with the cell membrane. Subsequently,
  the SARS-CoV 2 RNA releases into the host cell. The translation of genome RNA resulted
  in the production of viral replicase polyproteins (pp1a and 1ab). Simultaneously,
  polymerase produces a series of subgenomic mRNAs by transcription, which are finally
  translated into the relevant viral proteins. Genomic RNA and viral proteins are
  subsequently assembled into virions. These virions are budding from Golgi complex
  and then are transported via vesicles and released out of the cell.
