caption: Model depicting the molecular underpinnings of lamin B2 origin licensing.
  Cell cycle regulated active DNA demethylation involves TET2 and TDG pathway that
  signals the occupancy of c-Myc to demethylated E-box during early G1 phase. The
  subsequent Myc-dependent cross talk of histone modifications during mid G1 phase
  favors the remodeling of nucleosomes at the origin and specifies its licensing by
  facilitating the loading of MCM proteins.
papertitle: The epigenetic control of E-box and Myc-dependent chromatin modifications
  regulate the licensing of lamin B2 origin during cell cycle.
