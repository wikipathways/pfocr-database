caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of the Asp family of amino acids and of the sulfur
  assimilation and Cys biosynthetic pathway in plants. Met biosynthesis comprises
  two biosynthetic domains: sulfur assimilation reduction, and Cys biosynthesis and
  one branch of the Asp amino acid family biosynthetic pathway. A dashed line represents
  parts of the pathway in which detailed descriptions of the enzymatic steps have
  been omitted. Most of the pathway is localized in the chloroplast, as indicated,
  but the final step of Met biosynthesis takes place in the cytosol. Met serves as
  a precursor for protein and SAM biosynthesis.'
