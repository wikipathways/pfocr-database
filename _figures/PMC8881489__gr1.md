caption: Radiotherapy induces antitumor immune response in several aspects. (1.5-column).
  a. Irradiation of local tumor induces DNA DSBs and genomic instability, which induce
  cell death and cellular senescence. b. Radiotherapy increases the expression of
  MHC class I and induces the exposure of calreticulin in the cell surface. c. dsDNA
  and mtDNA initiate cGAS-STING signaling pathway and promote the transcription and
  secretion of type I IFN. d. Type I IFN stimulates the receptors on tumor cells,
  DCs and T cells, thus remodeling inflammatory microenvironment. e. Radiotherapy
  increases the secretion of DAMPs, including HMGB1 and ATP, which enhance immunogenicity
  and drive the recruitment of immune cells. f. Extracellular dsDNA also initiates
  cGAS-STING signaling pathway in DCs. g. Radiotherapy promotes the release of TAAs.
  DCs uptake TAAs and play the role of antigen presentation. h. DCs present antigens
  and prime T cells, thus increase the diversity of TCR repertoire and T cell clonality.
  i. Activated T cells recognize and kill residual tumor cells. j. Radiotherapy stimulates
  tumor cells and stromal cells and initiates the production and release of chemokines,
  such as CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 and CXCL16. k. Chemokines including CXCL9, CXCL10,
  CXCL11 and CXCL16 lead to the infiltration of DCs, macrophages and T cells, further
  promoting inflammatory tumor microenvironment. l. Activated T cells potentially
  attack non­irradiated metastases in the distance. DSBs, double-strand breaks; dsDNA,
  double-strand DNA; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; IFN, interferon; IFN-R, IFN receptor;
  DC, Dendritic cell; DAMP, damage-associated molecular pattern; HMGB1, high mobility
  group box-1; TLRs, toll-like receptors; TCR, T cell receptor.
