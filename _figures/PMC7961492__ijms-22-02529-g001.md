caption: The mechanisms and molecules involved in cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis
  and the regulatory effects of Non-encoding RNAs are depicted in a foam cell. Cholesterol
  metabolism involves cholesterol influx, cholesterol esterification and cholesterol
  efflux, which ultimately leads to cholesterol homeostasis in the macrophage. Scavenger
  receptors SRA-1, CD36 and LOX1 are involved in oxLDL uptake. The gene expression
  of these receptors is downregulated in part A (see above); that is, non-encoding
  RNAs that have anti-atherosclerotic properties and are upregulated by part B ncRNAs,
  which are atherogenic and lead to lipid accumulation in macrophages. Cholesterol
  efflux is a pathway that transports excess free cholesterol from the cell, mainly
  via ABCA1, ABCG1, as well as SR-B1 transporters, leading to the formation of HDL
  and apoa1. The ncRNAs that reduce the formation of foam cells by increasing cholesterol
  efflux are specified in part C, as well as ncRNAs that lead to induction of the
  formation of foam cells by reducing cholesterol efflux, which are specified in part
  D. In cholesterol esterification, ACAT-1 and neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase
  (NCEH) play a key role in catalyzing the esterification of cholesterol and removing
  free cholesterol from foam cells, respectively. ACAT1 re-esterifies excess FC to
  promote the biosynthesis of CE that is stored in lipid droplets. In part E, microRNAs
  have been listed that reduce cholesterol esterification and increase the accumulation
  of free cholesterol, which ultimately promotes foam cell formation. Reducing foam
  cell apoptosis can stabilize atherosclerotic plaque and prevent the progression
  and worsening of atherosclerosis. ncRNAs that reduce foam cell apoptosis are shown
  in part F.  = decrease,  = increase.
