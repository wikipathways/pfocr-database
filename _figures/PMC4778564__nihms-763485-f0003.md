caption: Both HCV core and NS4B proteins could induce the ER stress and activate the
  UPR, which has been known to induce autophagy. The HCV p7 protein could bind to
  Beclin-1, although it is unclear whether this binding plays any role in HCV-induced
  autophagy. The HCV NS3/4A protease could bind to mitochondria-associated IRGM, which
  plays an important role in HCV-induced autophagy. HCV NS4B could form a complex
  with Rab5, hVps34 and Beclin-1, which are important regulatory factors for autophagy.
  HCV NS5A could upregulate the expression of Beclin-1 via NS5ATP9. HCV NS5B could
  bind to ATG5, which, as illustrated in , is conjugated to ATG12 and associated with
  ATG16L and important for the elongation of phagophores and the formation of autophagosomes.
