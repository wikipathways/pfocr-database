caption: 'A double security mechanism to regulate the cellular Ex level by Hippo signaling.
  The cellular abundance of Ex is regulated by the Hippo signaling at both transcriptional
  and post-translational level. Transcription of ex is activated by Yki. Previous
  studies,,,,, have shown that Ft maintains a proper level of both Ex and Wts through
  antagonizing the activity of D; Crb promotes the degradation of Ex via an undefined
  mechanism(s). In this figure, we propose, as described in our paper, that (A) when
  Hippo signaling is ''off'', Crb and D may activate an unknown kinase(s) that is/are
  necessary for the phosphorylation of Ex, a prerequisite for SCFSlmb-mediated degradation.
  Alternatively, D may promote the degradation of Ex merely through its regulation
  of Wts. In the meantime, transcription of crb is upregulated, which may contribute
  further to the degradation of Ex. In case that the cellular Ex is not sufficient,
  Hippo signaling employs a negative feedback mechanism, via upregulating the transcription
  of ex by Yki, to compensate for the degraded Ex; (B) when Hippo signaling is ''on'',
  Wts becomes associated to and phosphorylates Ex, which prevents Slmb from binding
  it to mediate the degradation. The degradation of Ex may be further attenuated by
  the downregulated crb transcription. In case that the cellular Ex becomes more than
  needed, Hippo signaling shuts down the transcription of ex via inactivating Yki.
  The paled symbols indicate inactive components or processes that are not in function.
