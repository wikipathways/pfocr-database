caption: Integrative model for involvement of ME1 and the other cytosolic NADP-reducing
  enzymes in the initiation and progression of cancer. The model posits that ME1,
  IDH1, and pentose phosphate pathway function collaboratively within a network to
  maintain required levels of NADPH. In pre-cancerous and tumor cells, one or more
  of these enzymes/pathways becomes over-expressed, or augmented in activity, thereby
  favoring increased steady state levels of NADPH. This elevation in NADPH promotes
  NOX/DUOX signaling leading to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage, and increased
  glutathione and thioredoxin recycling; these latter pathways protect tumor cells
  from the apoptosis-inducing effects of increased oxidative stress. The NADPH-dependent
  pathways favor proliferation, DNA damage, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
  cell migration and metastasis, anti-senescence and anti-apoptosis. We further posit
  that hyperinsulinemia drives a) the increased expression of ME1 favoring increased
  activity of the pyruvate-malate cycle and thereby, leading to increased synthesis
  of fatty acids and cholesterol in support of biosynthesis, proliferation and anti-apoptosis
  (), and b) the increased activity of NOX/DUOX members. The collective actions contribute
  to a heightened genotoxic and proliferative state, ultimately contributing to tumor
  genesis.
