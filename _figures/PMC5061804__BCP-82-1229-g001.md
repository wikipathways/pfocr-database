caption: Cellular signalling upstream and downstream of mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) complexes. (A) mTOR pathways and functional relationships. mTOR forms two
  multiprotein complexes – mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and mTORC2. The classical mTORC1‐positive
  inputs are growth factors, chemokines, nutrients and cell energy balance. Growth
  factors stimulate mTORC1 through the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3‐kinase (PI3K)/Akt
  signalling pathway. Akt phosphorylates tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2). TSC2
  is a GTPase‐activating protein that functions in association with TSC1 to inactivate
  the small G protein Rheb, which, in turn, upregulates mTORC1 activity. mTORC1 activity
  is required for the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of ribosomal S6 kinase
  1 (S6K1), which regulates the elongation step of protein translation, ribosomal
  protein S6 (RPS6) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), ultimately
  promoting the initiation of translation and elongation. mTORC1 also phosphorylates
  and inactivates the translation inhibitor eIF4E‐binding protein 1 (4E‐BP1), which
  inhibits cap‐dependent translation. The mTOR pathway may be also regulated by the
  LKB1/AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. AMPK phosphorylates TSC2, activating
  the TSC1/TSC2 complex and thus repressing mTORC1 activity. Moreover, AMPK phosphorylates
  Raptor, inducing Raptor and mTORC1 disassembly/inhibition. mTORC2 regulates cell
  survival through serum‐ and glucocorticoid‐activated kinase 1 (SGK1) and Akt. mTORC2
  phosphorylates Akt at Ser473, priming Akt for further phosphorylation by phosphoinositide‐dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK1) at the Thr308 residue. Loss of phosphorylation at the Ser473 site,
  however, affects only some Akt substrates, such as Forkhead Homeobox type O (FOXO)
  transcription factors, but not TSC2, in response to growth factor signalling. mTORC2
  also associates with actively translating ribosomes to phosphorylate cotranslationally
  Akt (at Thr450), which prevents the ubiquitination and degradation of Akt. mTORC2
  is involved in the spatial control of cell growth via cytoskeletal regulation. (B)
  mTOR and autophagy. Under nutrient‐rich conditions, mTOR associates with and inhibits
  the UNC51‐like kinase (ULK) complex by phosphorylating autophagy‐related (ATG) 13
  and ULK1. By contrast, stress signals or AMPK activation lead to mTORC1 dissociation
  from ULK1 and to the activation of the ULK complex, thereby triggering the autophagy
  machinery. Arrows indicate activating events, whereas perpendicular lines indicate
  inhibitory events. FIP200, focal adhesion kinase family‐interacting protein of 200
  kD; FKBP38, FK‐506‐binding protein; GPCR, G protein‐coupled receptor; IGF1‐R, insulin‐like
  growth factor 1 receptor; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; IRS1, insulin receptor
  substrate 1; LKB1, liver kinase B1; mLST8, mammalian lethal with sec‐13 protein
  8; PI(3,4,5)‐P3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)‐trisphosphate; PRAS40, proline‐rich
