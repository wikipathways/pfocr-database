caption: Oxygen- and redox-mediated pathways regulating cytokines. (A) Schematic representation
  of the pathways leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their
  selective dismutation. A number of major cellular enzymes that defend against oxidative
  stress have been conserved through evolution. Superoxide (O2-•) anion is metabolized
  via the dismutation reaction 2O2-• + 2H+ → O2 + H2O2. The reaction is catalyzed
  by superoxide oxidoreductase dismutase (SOD), which is both a cytoplasmic enzyme
  that is constitutively expressed and a mitochondrial enzyme that is induced in response
  to oxidant stress. The H2O2 produced by the dismutation of O2-• is converted by
  catalase (CAT) in peroxisomes to H2O and O2 and by glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX)
  in the cytoplasm, at the expense of reduced glutathione (GSH). This leads to the
  formation of oxidized glutathione disulphide (GSSG) that is recycled back to GSH
  by glutathione reductase (GSSG-RD). H2O2 could be further converted by another pathway
  involving iron (Fe2+) into hydroxyl radical (•OH), an injurious ROS causing cellular
  damage. This iron-catalyzed reaction, known as the Fenton-like reaction, is impeded
  by the iron chelator desferrioxamine (DSF), which is also capable of neutralizing
  the toxicity of •OH. (B) Schematic model of thiol regulation of chemioxyexcitation-induced
  cytokine secretion in the alveolar epithelium. The predominant form of intracellular
  glutathione is GSH, which is synthesized by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS).
  The molecules 2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTC), S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)
  and N-acetyl-L-cysteine are major precursors of cysteine, the rate-limiting substrate
  in the biosynthesis of GSH, a pathway which is selectively blocked by L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine
  (BSO). BSO upregulates the formation of intracellular ROS, which are major inducers
  of cytokine secretion. GSH is either rapidly exported, where the membrane-bound
  γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) degrades it into its subcellular components to
  be used for resynthesis, or is converted by oxidation to glutathione disulphide
  (GSSG) by glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and its mimetic ebselen, at the expense
  of ROS (which are promptly detoxified to form peroxides, ROOH). The formation of
  GSSG and/or reduction of ROS downregulate the chemioxyexcitation-dependent cytokine
  release. GSSG is rapidly recycled back into GSH by glutathione reductase (GSSG-RD),
  a pathway which is selectively blocked by 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea
  (BCNU). The block leads to accumulation of GSSG, which, along with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate,
  a precursor of GSSG, downregulates the formation of ROS and abrogates the cytokine-dependent
  sequelae. Cytokines act as major participants in the pathophysiology and aggravation
  of the clinical symptoms of respiratory distresses (RD).
