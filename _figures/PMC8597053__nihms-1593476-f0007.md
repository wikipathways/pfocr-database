caption: Summary of the Effects on the Classical Secretory Pathway of TG- or Simulated
  Ischemia-induced ER Stress. - Part A- In cardiac myocytes, ER/SR-resident proteins
  are depicted as red, and secreted proteins as black within the ER lumen. Under control
  conditions, ER/SR-resident proteins are not secreted while secreted proteins are
  properly folded, routed through the Golgi, and eventually released into the media.
  Part B- Upon treatment with TG or sI, most ER luminal proteins that should be secreted
  misfold, do not traffic through the Golgi, and are therefore not secreted. However,
  in contrast to TM, treatment with TG or sI stimulates the secretion of a group of
  ER/SR resident proteins that are not secreted under other conditions; in this study
  these proteins were identified as GRP94, GRP78 and CRT. When these three proteins
  are secreted, they act in an autocrine/paracrine manner to protect cells from the
  maladaptive effects of ER stress.
