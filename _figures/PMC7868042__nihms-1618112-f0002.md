caption: Mitophagy is mainly mediated by microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain
  3 (LC3)-associated autophagy receptors via both ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent and Ub-independent
  pathways. Ub-dependent mitophagy involves the mitochondrial serine/threonine protein
  kinase PINK1 and E3 Ub-protein ligase parkin (PINK1–parkin) pathway. Following loss
  of mitochondrial membrane potential, PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane (OMM), where it recruits and phosphorylates parkin to add phospho–Ub chains
  on OMM proteins. Autophagy receptors, such as sequestosome 1, next to BRCA1 protein
  (NBR1), optineurin, calcium-binding and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 2
  (NDP52) and TAX1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1), which contain both Ub-binding domains
  and LC3-interacting regions (LIRs), bridge the ubiquitylated mitochondria to LC3-associated
  autophagosomal membranes for sequestration. PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of ubiquitin
  might be sufficient to recruit NDP52 and optineurin and induce mitophagy independently
  of parkin. Ub-independent mitophagy is mediated by several OMM receptors such as
  BCL-2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), BNIP3-like (BNIP3L),
  FUN14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUNDC1), which do not require interaction with
  Ub for cargo recognition. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP8 and BCL-2-like
  13 (BCL2L13) are potential additional mitophagy receptors. By binding to LC3 via
  the LIRs at their cytosolic N terminus, mitophagy receptors link damaged mitochondria
  directly to autophagosomes.
