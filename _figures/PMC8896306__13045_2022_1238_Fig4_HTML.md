caption: 'The interplay between activity–rest cycles and cancer. a activity–rest cycles
  regulate immune function for tumor suppression. Exercise has been found to promote
  immune cell infiltration by epinephrine-driven NK cells circulation, resulting in
  a marked inhibition of cancer. Moreover, exercise also enhances naïve T cell populations
  and mitigates detrimental effects on T cells, leading to more efficient generation
  of immunological memory. b activity–rest cycles regulate the crosstalk between muscle
  and tumor. The crosstalk between muscle and tumor depends on skeletal muscle-secreted
  myokines. Exercise-induced myokines, including OSM, irisin, and SPARC, may play
  a role in cancer prevention and therapy. In addition, exercise-induced myokines
  can also induce the secretion of immune regulatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-7,
  and IL-15, which indirectly regulate immune cell function. c, activity–rest cycles
  regulate tumor microenvironment. Exercise-mediated promotion of pro-angiogenic cytokines
  (such as VEGF) induces vascular remodeling to increase density and perfusion and
  reduce hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, exercise was involved
  in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway, in which exercise-driven epinephrine
  markedly inhibited tumor formation by inducing Yap and Taz phosphorylation and subsequent
  degradation. NK cells: natural killer cells; OSM: oncostatin M; SPARC: secreted
  protein acidic and rich in cysteine; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor'
