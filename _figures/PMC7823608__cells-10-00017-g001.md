caption: Sorting nexins and ubiquitin coordinate the three distinct but interconnected
  protein proteolysis pathways. In the endo-lysosomal pathway, membrane proteins are
  sorted at the early endosome. Cargos destined for lysosomal degradation are marked
  by ubiquitination and internalized using endosomal sorting complexes required for
  transport pathways (ES). Cargos destined for recycling are retrieved either by the
  retromer or retrieval complex (R & R) coupled with various subclasses of sorting
  nexins (SNX- see text for details). In the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) cargos
  are sequestered to the vacuole by double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes
  by selective or non-selective mechanisms. Selective pathways in yeast are mediated
  by SNX-Bar heterodimers. In mammalian cells, the recognition of selective autophagy
  cargos is dependent upon ubiquitination (Ub). The ubiquitin-proteasomal system (UPS)
  targets short-lived regulatory proteins that are selectively targeted and degraded.
  TGN- trans-Golgi network, SNX-sorting nexin. In cells, the TGN and nucleus are in
  close proximity, whereas here they are drawn apart for clarity.
