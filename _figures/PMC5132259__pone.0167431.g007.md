caption: A) the Wnt signalling pathway in canonical and non-canonical contexts, B)
  the Hedgehog signalling pathway and C) the Notch signalling pathway. Coloration
  of genes indicates presence, absence or ancestral absence from the Coleoptera as
  detailed in the key, which also gives other information as noted. All genes automatically
  annotated by KEGG KAAS server, with the exception of PAR-1, which was manually annotated.
