caption: A. Dopamine D1 and D2 receptor homooligomers modulate adenylyl cyclase activity
  and cAMP accumulation in opposite ways through Gs/olf and Gi/o proteins, respectively
  (left panel). D1–D2 receptor heteromer activation leads to a novel signaling pathway
  mediated through Gq/11 protein activation, to a rapid, transient, intracellular
  calcium mobilization from endoplasmic reticulum (right panel). This calcium signal
  involves phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol-triphosphate (IP3) receptors and leads
  to CaMKIIα activation.B. Activation of dopamine D5 receptor homooligomers results
  in the mobilization of intracellular calcium involving Gq/11 and PLC activation,
  and extracellular calcium influx leading to a robust rise in intracellular calcium
  (left panel). D5-D2 receptor heteromer formation confers two roles to D2 receptor,
  one is the inhibition exerted by D2R on D5R-induced rise in calcium when only D5
  receptor is activated (middle panel), and the ability of D2R to participate in the
  increase in calcium mobilization when both D5 and D2 receptors forming the heteromer
  are co-stimulated (right panel)
