caption: Schematic representation of the balance between Cdc42 and RasGRF pathways.
  (A) The balance between both signaling pathways is in equilibrium and both are active
  to a similar extent. (B) RasGRF expression is higher and there is more signaling
  through the ERK pathway while Cdc42 signaling is low. (C) Tumor cell plasticity
  allows that both pathways signal on and off depending on environmental conditions.
  (D) RasGRF expression is lower and there is less signaling through the ER K pathway
  while Cdc42 signaling is high.
