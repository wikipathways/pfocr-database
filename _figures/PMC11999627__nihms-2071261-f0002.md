caption: The IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway. When stromal cells experience damage or
  mechanical injury, they undergo necrosis and release IL-33. This cytokine activates
  the heterodimeric ST2/IL-1RAcP receptor complex on various immune cells. IL-33 can
  also bind to a decoy receptor composed of a soluble form of ST2 (sST2) or SIGIRR,
  which leads to inactivation. Upon activation of the ST2L, TIR initiates the pathway
  by first recruiting MyD88, which induces recruitment of IRAK1 and IRAK4, similar
  to the binding process seen with other interleukin-1 family members, such as Il-1α
  and IL-1β. This recruitment activates the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The activation
  is mediated by the MAPKs, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK),
  p38, and JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), ultimately producing Th2 cytokines and chemokines.
  The activity of MAPK pathways and canonical NF-κB is regulated at multiple levels.
