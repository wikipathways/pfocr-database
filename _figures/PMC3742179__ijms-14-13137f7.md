caption: Hypothesized reaction mechanism for SPL (The residues are numbered according
  to the protein sequence in Bs SPL). This mechanism implies that SPL uses a minimum
  of four H atom transfer (HAT) processes (labeled in blue numbers) in each catalytic
  cycle. One of the four processes occurs between a tyrosine and a cysteine, suggesting
  that SPL uses a novel HAT pathway for SAM regeneration. The role of Y97(Bs) in SPL
  catalysis needs further elucidation and is, thus, not shown here (the figure is
