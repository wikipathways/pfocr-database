caption: Hypothesized metabolic model of stellate cell function in Aedes Malpighian
  tubules. The illustration shows a stellate cell intercalated between 2 principal
  cells. As emphasized by the red arrows, we propose that AeAE contributes primarily
  to the handling of intracellular HCO3− that is generated by the mitochondrial metabolism
  of principal cells during diuretic conditions. AeAE also may contribute to a transcellular
  pathway for Cl− secretion, but this is considered a minor role (see text for details).
  A recycling mechanism for Cl− across the basal membrane of stellate cells cannot
  be ruled out. Principal and stellate cells are shown to be connected via 1) paracellular
  septate junctions (sj), which provide the primary pathway for transepithelial Cl−
  secretion (), and 2) intercellular gap junctions (gj), which provide a putative
  pathway for the transport of HCO3− to stellate cells. Previous studies in mosquito
  Malpighian tubules have shown evidence of an apical V-type H+-ATPase in the brush
  border of principal cells (, ), a carbonic anhydrase in principal cells (), gap
  junctions in principal cells (), basal K+ channels in principal cells (), a basal
  Na/H exchanger (NHE) in principal cells (, ), and apical Cl− channels in stellate
  cells (). The molecular identity of the apical cation/H+ antiporter (CPA) has yet
  to be identified (). See Ref.  for a detailed review of the transepithelial transport
  mechanisms in mosquito Malpighian tubules.
