caption: A schematic model showing the potential role of HOXA5 in the tumorigenesis
  of breast cancer. In MCF7 breast cancer cells, the PRC2 complex leads to repressive
  histone modifications such as H3K27me3 at the putative promoter of HOXA5, resulting
  in gene expression inhibition. This leads to apoptosis (p53 and p21 expression),
  epithelial phenotype (E-cadherin expression), and reduced breast cancer stem cell
  formation (decreased stemness marker expression). On the contrary, in TAMR cells,
  histone demethylases remove H3K27me3 marks at the HOXA5 putative promoter region.
  This leads to diminished apoptosis (inhibition of p53 and p21 expression), mesenchymal
  phenotype (N-cadherin and ZEB1 expression), and enhanced breast cancer stem cell
  formation (increased stemness marker expression).
