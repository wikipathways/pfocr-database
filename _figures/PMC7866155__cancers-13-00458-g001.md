caption: 'Key nodal points of mitosis and apoptosis in hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human
  epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2−) breast cancers (HR+/HER2−BC):
  major signaling pathways involved in proliferation and apoptosis in an HR+/HER2−BC
  tumor cell are presented. In a HR+/HER2−BC tumor cell, the major pro-proliferative
  signal involved in genomic and nongenomic functions of estrogen, which in the background
  of wild type TP53, transcriptionally regulates cell cycle via Cyclin D1. Cyclin
  D is a bona fide partner of CDK4/6. CDK4/6 is a key target in estrogen receptor-positive
  breast cancer (ER+BC). Cellular signals from the PI3K pathway are the primary survival
  pathway of the tumor cells, and activating (oncogenic/pathogenic) alterations of
  different nodes of the PI3K pathway, including PIK3CA, PIK3R1/R2, AKT, PTEN, are
  reported in approximately 70% of ER+BC. The most common antiapoptotic signal has
  been reported to be mediated via BCL2, and the protein is overexpressed in approximately
  80% of ER+BC. Major signals in a HR+/HER2−BC tumor cell are presented in separate
  blocks. MDM4, a structural homolog of MDM2 that can form a heterocomplex with MDM2
  and potentiate the ubiquitylation of p53. Please note that despite the conservation,
  the RING domain of MDMX has no detectable ubiquitin-ligase activity itself. MDM4
  lacks an E3 ligase activity, but through heterodimerization, it regulates MDM2 enzymatic
  proficiency.'
