caption: Schematic representation of how AD effectors contribute to neuronal dysfunction
  by modulating transcription. APP undergoes intramembrane proteolysis mediated by
  β- and γ-secretases to generate Aβ and AICD. The intracellular metabolite AICD binds
  Fe65, which promotes its nuclear translocation and the consequent interaction with
  the DNA. The AICD/Fe65/DNA complex controls the expression of Stathmin1 (STMN1),
  activates Neprilysin (NEP) promoter, and induces the expression of Glycogen Synthase
  Kinase 3β (GSK3β). The Aβ monomers, generated by APP cleavage, translocate to the
  nucleus and recognize a sequence in the promoter of genes involved in AD pathogenesis,
  including APP, BACE1, and APOE. Tau hyperphosphorylated aggregates result in an
  anomalous activation of transposable elements (TEs) and an aberrant CREB-regulated
  genes over-representation. When nuclear tau is dephosphorylated, it is involved
  in DNA protection against cellular stressors and the rearrangement of heterochromatin,
  enriched in noncoding RNAs. AD pathogenesis is characterized by abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation,
  causing tau detachment from DNA and the consequent loss of heterochromatin and anomalous
  noncoding RNAs expression. APOE ε4 binding to its receptor activates a noncanonical
  signaling pathway which triggers the APP transcription and Aβ40/42 production. When
  APOE ε4 interacts with DNA, it acts as a transcriptional repressor of Sirtuin1 (SirT1),
  a transcriptional activator of the α-secretase ADAM10 gene. (Red and blue arrows
  indicate the increase and the decrease in gene transcription respectively. Question
  mark (?) shows an unknown effect (activation or repression) of transcription).
