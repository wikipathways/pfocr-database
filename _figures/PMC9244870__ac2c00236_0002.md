caption: Overview of the lipid biosynthesis pathway. (A) Upregulated metabolic processes
  contribute to cancer growth and proliferation during malignancy. Solid arrows indicate
  single reaction processes and dotted arrows indicate processes with multiple reactions.
  αKG, α-ketoglutarate; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; glucose
  6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A; OAA,
  oxaloacetate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; ribose 5-P, ribose 5-phosphate; and
  SCD, stearoyl-CoA desaturase. (B) Investigating the effect of TOFA in cell lines
  associated with PCa malignancy by targeting ACC enzyme in DNL and imaging associated
  phenotypes by SRS. The small-molecule TOFA targets the initial step in the pathway,
  inhibiting the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA.
