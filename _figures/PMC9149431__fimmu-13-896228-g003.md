caption: NK cell cytotoxicity is mediated by the release of cytotoxic granules and
  death ligands. Cytotoxic granules secretion containing perforin induces pore formation,
  allowing internalization of granzyme (gzm). Gzm initiates apoptosis cleaving intracellular
  substrates such as effectors caspase-3 and caspase-7. In addition, gzmB can cleave
  the BH3-only protein Bid to generate the truncated t-Bid or the anti-apoptotic protein
  Mcl-1 to release Bim initiating the mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization
  (a process known as MOMP), the release of cytochrome c and other proapoptotic factors
  promote the formation of the apoptosome, caspase 9 activation, and the full activation
  of caspase-3 and -7 to execute the apoptotic process. Gzms and Caspases can also
  cleave and activate gasdermins (GSDMs), linking apoptosis to pyroptosis or directly
  activating pyroptosis. Membrane or soluble death ligands (TNF-α, FasL and TRAIL)
  can induce cell death through their death receptor (TNFR1, Fas, and DR4/DR5, respectively).
  Ligand-receptor interaction generates receptor trimerization and its intracellular
  death domains clustering inducing Complex I (CYLD, TRAF2, cIAP1/2, TRADD, RIP1)
  formation in the case of TNFR1. RIP1 de-ubiquitination induces Complex IIa formation.
  However, Fas or TRAIL death ligands trimerization promotes the death-inducing signalling
  complex (DISC) formation, which is similar to Complex IIa in conformation and performance.
  In the DISC or Complex IIa, Caspase-8 auto-cleaves leading to apoptosis pathway
  (involving Bid and/or caspase-3), while caspase-8 inactivation induces Complex IIa
  transformation in IIb, which drives phosphorylated-RIP3 and MLKL ion pore-forming,
  resulting in ion disbalance and necroptosis cell death.
