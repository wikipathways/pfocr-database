caption: Hypothetic model of SA protection from NSAIDs-indued inflammatory damage
  of small intestine through regulating the Nrf2/NF-KB pathways. Under the stimulation
  of NSAIDs and other inflammatory factors, the inflammatory pathway of NF-kB is activated
  in epithelial cells and intestinal tract. P65 (an active subunit of NF-KB) is phosphorylated
  and depolymerized from the inflammatory complex composed of p65, p50 and IκB-α.
  Then phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) enters the nucleus, binds with its target gene under
  the guidance of CBP, and induces the expression of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6
  and IL-1β, which activate the inflammatory response of IEC-6 cells and intestinal
  mucosa, leading to inflammatory lesions. SA binds to Keap-1, inhibits Keap-1 and
  increases cellular expression of Nrf2, which competes with p-p65 to bind to CBP
  in the nucleus, and then reduce the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. On the
  other hand, the increased Nrf2/CBP complexes promote the expression of HO-1 (target
  gene of Nrf2), so as to counteract the effects of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6
  and IL-1β.
