caption: DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by non-homologous DNA end joining
  (NHEJ), alternative end joining (a-EJ), single-strand annealing (SSA) and homologous
  recombination (HR). NHEJ is the predominant DSB repair pathway (bold arrow). Pathway
  choice is largely dictated by the availability of homology (called microhomology
  if the length is less than 20 bp) between the DNA end overhangs. NHEJ requires either
  no microhomology or, more often, 1–4 bp of terminal microhomology. a-EJ typically
  requires microhomology of at least 2 bp (usually more) and less than 20 bp. SSA
  requires homology of typically more than 50 bp, and the homology requirement for
  HR is typically more than 100 bp. The exposure of terminal (micro)homology is partly
  determined by the extent of DNA end protection versus nucleolytic resection. TP53-binding
  protein 1 (53BP1) and its effectors, RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1), the shieldin
  complex (comprising shieldin complex subunit 1 (SHLD1), SHLD2, SHLD3 and revertibility
  protein 7 homologue (REV7)), the conserved telomere maintenance component 1 (CTC1)–oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding
  fold-containing protein 1 (STN1)–telomere length regulation protein TEN1 homologue
  (TEN1) (CST) complex and polymerase-α (Polα) protect the ends from extensive resection.
  By contrast, CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP) and the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 (MRN) endonuclease
  first nick one strand near the 5′ end and then degrade the strand in a 3′ to 5′
  direction towards the end, thereby creating a short 3′ overhang, which is suitable
  for a-EJ. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and Polθ are important for a-EJ.
  The nucleases Bloom syndrome protein (BLM)–DNA replication ATP-dependent helicase/nuclease
  DNA2 and exonuclease 1 (EXO1) can mediate longer resection in a 5′ to 3′ manner,
  and replication protein A (RPA) protects the resulting single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
  to facilitate HR and SSA. Annealing of homologous sequences by RAD52 is important
  for SSA, and the 3′ non-homologous ssDNA flaps are cut by XPF–ERCC1 before ligation
  by DNA ligase 1 (LIG1). RAD51, breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1),
  BRCA2 and RAD54 are essential to promote HR. The (micro)homology regions within
  the repair products are labelled with colour; the proteins highlighted with colour
  are those essential for the corresponding pathways. DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein
  kinase catalytic subunit; PAXX, paralogue of XRCC4 and XLF; XLF, XRCC4-like factor.

  description: DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by non-homologous DNA

    NHEJ requires either no microhomology or, more often, 1–4 bp of terminal microhomology.
    a-EJ typically requires microhomology of at least 2 bp (usually more) and less

    requirement for HR is typically more than 100 bp. The exposure of terminal (micro)homology
    is partly determined by the extent of DNA end protection versus nucleolytic resection.
    TP53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) and its effectors, RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1),
    the shieldin complex (comprising shieldin complex subunit 1 (SHLD1), SHLD2, SHLD3
