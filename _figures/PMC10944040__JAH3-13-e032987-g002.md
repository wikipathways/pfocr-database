caption: Classical IL‐1a/IL‐1B signaling through the IL‐1R1 complex as described in
  Figure 2 (A). IL‐1Ra is a natural competitive inhibitor that competes with the IL‐1
  ligand at the receptor site (B). Once it binds to the receptor, there is no ensuing
  downstream activation, because IL‐1Ra lacks the domain that allows it to bind to
  the IL‐1R AcP. Binding between IL‐1 and IL‐1R2 does not initiate the activation
  pathway (C). IL‐1R2 molecules are decoy receptors; once they bind to IL‐1 they form
  a trimeric complex with IL‐1R AcP, separate from the cells and exist in a soluble
  state (sIL‐1R2). It is believed that by binding to IL‐1R2, IL‐1 is kept away from
  its signaling receptor (IL‐1R1). sIL‐1R2 can also bind to the pro‐form of IL‐1 (pro‐IL‐1)
  and possibly other forms, preventing cleavage by extracellular proteases. IL‐1β
  indicates interleukin‐1 beta; IL‐1R1, interleukin‐1 receptor type‐I; IL‐1R AcP,
  IL‐1 receptor accessory protein; IL‐1Ra, interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist; IRAK1/4,
  interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated kinase 1/4; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary
  response protein 88; and sIL‐1R2, soluble interleukin‐1 receptor type‐2
