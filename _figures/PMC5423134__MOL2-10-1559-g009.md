caption: A proposed mechanism of action by the combination of VCP inhibitors and ER
  stress‐prolonging agent Salubrinal . VCP facilitates the removal of unfolded proteins.
  When VCP is inhibited by DBeQ, ML240, and CB‐5083, increased accumulation of unfolded
  proteins induces ER stress and activates PERK pathway. PERK phosphorylates eIF2α
  and attenuates cap‐dependent translation, which lower protein load to restore protein
  homeostasis. ER stress also activates the sequential induction of ATF4 and CHOP
  transcription factors which together transactivate GADD34 and increase protein synthesis.
  The presence of sustained ER stress (either by continuous exposure to ER stress
  activating agents) or unresolved ER stress (due to inhibition of GADD34 by Salubrinal)
  can enhance or prolong the expression of CHOP and contribute to caspase‐mediated
  apoptosis. ER stress and unfolded protein response induced by VCP inhibitors are
  shown in orange color.
