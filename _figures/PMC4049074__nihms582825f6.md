caption: (A) Wild-type PRG-1 maintains transgenerational fertility by silencing repetitive
  RNA expression, and functions separately to initiate silencing of foreign transgenes
  and most transposons. (B) Deficiency for prg-1 results in transgenerational desilencing
  of repetitive loci and sterility. Transposon and transgene silencing is maintained
  by Mutator proteins. (C) Increased DAF-16 signaling via daf-2 mutation suppresses
  progressive sterility and desilencing of repetitive loci when prg-1 is mutant. Mutations
  are indicated by a red X. Light color tints indicate pathway dysfunction for prg-1
  mutants or low levels of DAF-16 activity in response to wild-type DAF-2 signaling.
