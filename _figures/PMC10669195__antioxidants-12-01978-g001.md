caption: (A). Nrf2 protein comprises seven conserved area domains Neh1 to Neh7. Neh1
  domain is a CNC-bZIP domain which allows Nrf2 to bind ARE through interaction with
  other factors like small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (sMAF). The Neh2 domain
  negatively controls the Nrf2 through its DLG and ETGE motifs. The Neh3 domain recruits
  chromo-ATPase/helicase DNA-binding protein family member CDH6. The Neh4 and Neh5
  domains can interact with the CH3 domain of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
  response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein. The Neh6 domain has two
  motifs, DSGIS and DSAPGS of β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP). Neh7
  domain interacts with retinoic X receptor alpha (RXR-α). (B). Keap1 protein comprises
  five domains such as N-terminal region (NTR), Bric-a-Brac domain (BTB), a cysteine-rich
  intervening region (IVR), Kelch domain, and carboxy-terminal region (CTR). Neh,
  Nrf2-ECH homology; CNC, cap ‘‘n’’ collar; bZIP, basic-region leucine zipper; Nrf2,
  nuclear factor E2-related factor 2; RXR-α, retinoid X receptor α; Keap1, Kelch-like
  ECH associated protein 1. (C). A scheme of the Nrf2 signaling pathway
