caption: Three inhibitors (fidarestat, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and azaserine)
  were used to decrease glucose flux down glycolytic side branch pathways (polyol,
  PPP, and HBP, respectively). Fidarestat inhibits aldose reductase, an enzyme that
  catalyzes the first rate-limiting step of the polyol pathway and reduces glucose
  to sorbitol. DHEA inhibits glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), an enzyme involved
  in converting glucose-6P into 6P-glucolactone in the PPP. Azaserine inhibits the
  rate-limiting enzyme GFAT in the HBP, a pathway responsible for producing UDP-GlcNAc.
