caption: Graph of the potential mechanism of KCNQ1OT1 contributing to AED resistance
  through the miR-138-5p/ABCB1 axis in intractable epilepsy. In summary, the levels
  of KCNQ1OT1 and P-gp were elevated in PHT-resistant endothelial cells. KCNQ1OT1
  contributed to P-gp/ABCB1 expression by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway as
  a sponge of miR-138-5p, thus limiting the delivery of AEDs from the blood to the
  target epileptic tissue.
