caption: Schematic diagrams summarizing presumed cerebrocortical tachykininergic circuits
  and their ischemia-induced alterations in relation to inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory
  glutamatergic pathways. GABAergic interneurons and glutamatergic pyramidal cells
  are depicted as large circles andtriangles, respectively. Inhibitory and excitatory
  terminals are symbolized as small filled circles andtriangles, respectively. Cortical
  laminae are symbolized by Roman numerals. Symbols and principles of cortical circuits
  were adopted from .A, Tachykininergic circuits at the early stage (6 hr) after focal
  ischemia that are not altered and correspond to control conditions. SP synthesis
  is restricted to NK1-negative GABAergic interneurons. SPergic/GABAergic interneurons
  project to non-SPergic/GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal cells (1,2). SP released
  from these GABAergic interneurons is likely to act on somatodendritic NK1 receptors
  (1) and, hypothetically, on NK1 receptors presynaptic (2) to pyramidal cells. This
  may result in increased release of GABA and, thus, facilitation of GABAergic inhibition
  of pyramidal neurons. NKB is synthesized in SP-negative GABAergic interneurons,
  and NK3 is synthesized in pyramidal cells of lamina V. NKB is proposed to be an
  excitatory cotransmitter in local GABAergic circuits with synaptic input to NK3-expressing
  pyramidal cells (3).B, Tachykininergic circuit alterations at 2 d after ischemia
  and their functional implications. SP expression is increased in GABAergic interneurons.
  Enhanced neurotransmission of SP at their projection sites (1 + 2) may result in
  a reinforcement of the presumed NK1-mediated facilitation of GABAergic inhibition
  of pyramidal neurons. The increased synthesis of NK1 in GABAergic interneurons may
  compensate for presumed NK1 receptor desensitization. SP is de novo synthesized
  in pyramidal cells of laminae II窶天, and NK1 synthesis is induced in pyramidal cells
  of laminae II窶的II with a possible NK1 and SP coinduction. Thus, SP released as an
  excitatory cotransmitter from glutamatergic pyramidal neurons may have dual functions,
  both to contribute to the activation of the GABAergic inhibitory pathway (4) and
  to stimulate the glutamatergic excitatory pathway via activation of pyramidal NK1
  heteroreceptors (5) or autoreceptors (6). Furthermore, the de novo-expressed NK1
  receptors of pyramidal glutamatergic neurons are likely targets of SP released from
  GABAergic interneurons (7). NKB synthesis in SP-negative GABAergic interneurons
  is enhanced and possibly paralleled by increased NKB release at NK3-positive pyramidal
  cells (3). This is presumed to add to the activation of the glutamatergic excitatory
  pathway.C, Tachykininergic circuitry alterations and partial normalizations at 7
  d after ischemia. Increases in SP and NK1 expression seen at 2 d in both GABAergic
  and glutamatergic pathways are no longer present (A). In contrast, the synthesis
  of NKB in GABAergic interneurons remains increased at approximately the same level
  seen after 2 d. The decrease of NK3 seen in pyramidal neurons at 2 d is almost normalized
  to levels seen in controls. Thus, functional alterations at 7 d after ischemia are
  limited to the NKB/NK3-mediated influence on excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission
  of pyramidal neurons.
