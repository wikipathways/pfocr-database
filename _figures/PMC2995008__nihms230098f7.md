caption: 'Simplified MAPK signaling pathway diagram depicting places where Mn has
  (demonstrated previously and in this study) an effect. In microglial cells, this
  pathway can be activated by a variety of stimuli, including inflammagens, such as
  LPS. Arrows beside components of the pathway denote increases or decreases caused
  by Mn (↑, ↓, respectively). Potential effects of Mn on MAP3K have not been studied
  yet and are hence marked with a question mark (?). Abbreviations: Mitogen activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K, i.e., MLK3, TAK, ASK1); mitogen activated protein
  kinase kinase (MAP2K, i.e. MKK-1/2, MKK-4, MKK-3/6); mitogen activated protein kinase
  (MAPK, i.e., extracellular regulated protein kinase [ERK], p38, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase [JNK]); mitogen activated kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1); interleukin-6 (IL-6);
  tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α ); cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2).'
