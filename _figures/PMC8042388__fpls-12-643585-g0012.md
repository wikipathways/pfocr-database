caption: Possible participation of ethylene, through CTR1, EIN2, and EIN3/EIL1, in
  the regulation of the Fe-, P-, and S-related genes considered in this study. Ethylene
  (ET) production is enhanced in Fe-, P-, and S-deficient roots. ET then acts in a
  signaling pathway which includes ET receptors (ETR) and the CTR1 and EIN2 proteins.
  This latter one can act through the EIN3/EIL1 TFs (represented as EIN3 in the figure),
  which have been implicated in the regulation of the FIT, PHR1, WRKY75, and SLIM1
  TFs controlling the activation of Fe-, P-, and S-related genes, like FRO2, IRT1,
  PAP17, PHT1;5, and SULTR1;1 (see text for details). Results in this work suggest
  that the EIN2 protein plays a key role in the regulation of the physiological responses
  to the three deficiencies and in the crosstalk between them. Moreover, the results
  support that TFs in addition to EIN3/EIL1, like ERF1 and other ERFs, could participate
  in the upregulation of Fe- and P-related genes (dotted lines). In red, ET-related
