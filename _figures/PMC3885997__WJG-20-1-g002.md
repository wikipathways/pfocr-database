caption: 'The genetic/immune landscape of colorectal cancer and therapeutic implications.
  The concept of personalized treatments in colorectal cancer should be based on integral
  knowledge of both tumor and immune cell signatures that would ideally provide therapeutic
  targets as well. A: As a result of genome profiling, epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been identified as promising
  targets for personalized therapies, while other biomarkers, like p53 mutations,
  18q loss and microsatellite instability, lack prognostic/predictive value. The immune
  profile of colorectal cancer is rather unique with regard to macrophages (and Tregs),
  which unexpectedly point to favourable prognosis, yet being immunosuppressive in
  the most tumor types. Hence, the monocyte lineage of myeloid cells may reveal antitumor
  M1-like polarization within the compartment of tumor-associated macrophages. The
  granulocyte lineage of myeloid cells, comprising undifferentiated myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSC), feature clear protumor N2-like polarization and contribute
  to poor prognosis. Those cells overexpress Arg that causes L-arginine depletion
  and thereby suppresses antitumor T-cell immunity; B: We hypothesize that Arg+ neutrophils
  and MDSC may also display radioprotective properties, as L-arginine deficiency would
  neutralize the radiosensitizing potential of M1 macrophages. Indeed, classically
  activated M1 macrophages are known to produce the radiosensitizing molecule nitric
  oxide (NO) through the iNOS/L-arginine pathway. Therefore, Arg+ neutrofils and MDSC
  emerge as promising biomarkers and candidates for future targeted therapies, aiming
  at reversing impaired immune and radiation responses.'
