caption: Schematic representation of the mevalonate pathway in Schistosoma mansoni.
  3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA (HMG-CoA), the product of HMG-CoA synthase,
  is converted to mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase, the target of the cholesterol-reducing
  statins. A series of reactions converts mevalonate to dimethylallyl diphosphate
  (DMAPP), which is converted to its isomer, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Condensations
  of one DMAPP and one IPP to produce geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and of IPP with GPP
  to form farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) are carried out by FPP synthase (FPPS) and are
  the targets of bisphosphonate therapies. Condensation of FPP and IPP leads to the
  production of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) by GGPP synthase (GGPPS). FPP is
  used to synthesize various quinones, GGPP is used to synthesize dolichols, and both
  are essential in the posttranslational prenylation of a variety of proteins (e.g.,
  the small GTPases Ras, Rab, and Rho) that are important for cell signaling and survival.
  Rhodoquinone plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain during cellular
  respiration in S. mansoni mitochondria. Conversion of FPP to squalene does not occur
  in S. mansoni, and therefore, there is no cholesterol synthesis.
