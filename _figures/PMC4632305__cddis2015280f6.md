caption: Epi regulatory pathway on BAG3 expression. Epi in cardiomyocytes induces,
  possibly through PKA, ERK phosphorylation. Phosphorylated ERK was also shown to
  phosphorylate CK2α, which then phosphorylates α-catenin, abrogating its inhibitory
  effect on β-catenin as previously described.β-Catenin is indeed free to translocate
  into the nucleus where it acts as transcription factor, together with LEF-1, enhancing
  mir-371–373 cluster transcription. Mature miR-371a-5p binds the wt BAG3 3′-UTR enhancing
  protein translation (a). When the homozygous g2252c mutation occurs, miR-371a-5p
  can no longer bind to the 3′-UTR of BAG3 and no increase of BAG3 is obtained in
  response to epi (b)
papertitle: A novel miR-371a-5p-mediated pathway, leading to BAG3 upregulation in
  cardiomyocytes in response to epinephrine, is lost in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
