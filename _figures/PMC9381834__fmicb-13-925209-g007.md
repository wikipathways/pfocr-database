caption: The attenuated M. bovis strain P150 induces higher apoptosis of BoMac through
  a CHOP-upregulated mechanism via the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum
  kinase (PERK)-dependent signal pathway activation. After M. bovis P150 is infected,
  it induces an ER stress and activates phosphorylation of PERK and subsequently with
  the ability to phosphorylate EIF2α. The result is the induction of ATF4 mRNA expression,
  which upregulates the expression of proapoptotic genes, e.g., CHOP and GADD45A.
  CHOP, the key downstream target of ATF4, as well as GADD45A, are upregulated and
  subsequently promoted apoptosis. Finally, the apoptosis of cell was increased that
  might be associated with a lower level of mycoplasma intracellular survival. The
  PERK/EIF2a/ATF4/CHOP/GADD45A axis is certainly involved in both survival and apoptotic
  signaling pathways.
