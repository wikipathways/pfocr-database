caption: 'Schematic representation of extravasation steps in breast cancer brain metastasis.
  (A) Rolling and firm adhesion: Rolling and firm adhesion are the first two steps
  occurring during extravasation, in which ligands expressed on breast cancer cells
  interact with respective molecules expressed on BECs. During rolling, breast cancer
  cells express ligands, including PSGL-1, CD24, sLex, and MUC1 that interact with
  endothelial E-selectin. During adhesion, additional ligands expressed on breast
  cancer cells, including CD44, MUC1, LFA-1 (Integrin αLβ2), VLA-4 (Integrin α4β1),
  ALCAM, and Integrin β4, interact with adhesion molecules expressed on the BEC, including
  VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 to allow the firm adhesion of breast cancer cells on the BEC [28,29].
  Mechanistically, through the inflammation and upregulation of PI3K/AKT, Rac signaling
  pathways have been shown to induce expression of adhesion molecules and promote
  the adhesion of breast cancer cells on the BE [74]. (B) Trans-endothelial migration:
  Enhanced permeability of BBB in breast cancer BM is mediated by upregulation of
  inflammatory mediators, including the COX2 and MMPs, leading to the disruption of
  inter-endothelial junctions, including (ZO-1 and claudin-5) [43]. Upregulation of
  CXCR4/SDF1 signaling pathway induces vascular permeability and TEM through activating
  PI3K/AKT and calcium signaling [73]. Upregulation of VEGF increases the permeability
  of BBB through redistributing actin fiber and disrupting VE-cadherin, thus promoting
  TEM. Cathepsin-S induces proteolytic cleavage of JAM-B, ADAM8 upregulates MMP9,
  and EndMT decreases VE-cadherin levels. Other mediators of breast cancer cells TEM
  include VEGF, MMP1, ST6GALNAC5, COX2, HB-EGF, GBP1, Sema4D, HER2, HPSE, CXCR4/SDF1,
  PI3K/AKT, Sdcs-1, and Cx43. Pericytes exert a chemoattractant effect on breast cancer
  cells to promote TEM [38]. Photo created with BioRender.com.'
