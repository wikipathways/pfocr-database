caption: Proposed mechanism of estrogen-induced innate immune evasionUnder standard
  laboratory conditions the C3 is deposited on the surface of C. albicans, resulting
  in effective phagocytosis. However, in the presence of estrogen the NADPH activity
  of Ebp1 is reduced, resulting in derepression (through an as yet to be identified
  signaling pathway) and surface localization of Gpd2. Gpd2 recruits Factor H to the
  fungal cell surface, preventing the formation of the C3 convertase and disposition
  of C3 on the fungal cell surface. Reduced opsonization results in innate immune
  evasion and insufficient clearance of C. albicans, promoting fungal pathogenicity.
