caption: Apoptotic effect and immune invasion of Porphyromonas gingivalis in OSCC
  [This figure was created using MedPeer (www.medpeer.cn)]. Numerous anti-apoptotic
  pathways are activated by infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis. Bad mediated
  the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and promoted apoptosis. The JAK1/Akt/Stat3
  signaling pathway was activated to control the intrinsic death pathway of mitochondrial
  cells, and it was possible to inhibit the apoptosis of gingival epithelial cells
  by blocking the activation of effector protein caspase-3. Furthermore, apoptosis
  is inhibited by the activation of the P2RX7 receptor, cytochrome C release inhibition,
  and HSP27-mediated caspase-9 activation. Certain strains of P. gingivalis have the
  ability to induce T cell apoptosis and upregulate the expression of B7-H1 and B7-DC
  receptors, which may aid in the immune system’s escape from oral cancer
