caption: Our data and data from other studies show that Cnidarian intron-less opsins
  might have been derived from an ancient eumetazoan ciliary-like opsin containing
  introns by retro-transposition. Once anchored in the genome the ancient cnidopsin
  gene underwent several rounds of duplication, diversification and sensitivity tuning.
  Individual opsins were thus accommodated for distinct functions in diverse tissue
  photoreceptors - ocular, extraocular and larval. These opsins differ in stage- or
  tissue-expression, primary structure and also in subsequent cellular signaling –
  either via Gs-cAMP pathway or other G-protein pathways. For further information
  see Discussion.
