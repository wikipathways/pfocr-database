caption: Schematic of the regulation of MCT1 by the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  in RBE4 cells. A, in the absence of Wnt signals, the destruction complex of APC,
  Axin, CK1, and GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to the recognition and ubiquitination
  of β-catenin by β-TrCP and subsequent proteasomal degradation. MCT1 on the plasma
  membrane undergoes ubiquitination, and the ubiquitinated MCT1 is sorted into the
  endosomal/lysosomal trafficking system for degradation. B, when GSK-3β of the destruction
  complex is inhibited by LiCl or SB216763, unphosphorylated β-catenin accumulates
  and translocates into the nucleus, where it replaces the co-repressor associated
  with TCF/LEF and functions as a transcription activator. The resulting Wnt signals
  retain the MCT1 transporter on the plasma membrane from trafficking into the endosomal/lysosomal
  system by decreasing the ubiquitination degree of MCT1, either by inhibiting the
  E3 ligase-dependent catalytic reaction or enhancing the activity of certain deubiquitinase
  inhibitor(s) (not shown). Notch signaling is indispensable for the indicated up-regulation
  of MCT1 by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway because this up-regulation can be negated by
  the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT. Co-R, co-repressor; EE, early endosome; LE, late
  endosome; LYS, lysosome; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; CSL, CBF1/RBPjκ/Su(H)/Lag-1;
