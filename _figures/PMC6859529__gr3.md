caption: UPR pathway under ER stress. Under physiological conditions, BiP binds with
  and inhibits IRE1α, ATF6α and PERK. When ER stress occurs, the misfolded peptides
  sequester BiP to release the three UPR transducers. IRE1α undergoes homodimerization
  and autophosphorylation, subsequently activating the endoribonuclease activity to
  splice XBP1 mRNA. The encoded XBP1s from spiced mRNA acts as a transcription factor
  to induce transcription of various target genes. ATF6 oligomer that exists under
  normal condition is reduced and exported from the ER to the Golgi, where it is proteolysed
  by Golgi-resident proteases, S1P and S2P. The truncated ATF6 translocates to the
  nucleus and induces transcription of target genes. PERK activation requires oligerization
  and autophosphorylation, which obtains the ability to phosphorylate eIF2α. Phosphorylated
  eIF2α transiently downregulates protein synthesis to decreasing ER protein load,
  or selectively translates ATF4, which is a transcription factor for a series of
  UPR target genes.
