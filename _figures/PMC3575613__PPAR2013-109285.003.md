caption: Tumor cells have altered glucose metabolism. Many glycolytic enzymes are
  ubiquitously expressed in cancers. One such glycolytic enzyme is pyruvate kinase
  type M2 whose levels are found to be elevated in human cancer biopsies, compared
  to adjacent normal tissues. PKM2 is a key regulator of the metabolic budget system
  in tumor cells which promotes the Warburg effect and tumor growth. This tumor specific
  PKM2 can be switched between dimeric and tetrameric forms in cancer cells. Dimeric
  PKM2 has a higher K m value for the substrate PEP than the tetrameric form of PKM2
  and is inactive at physiological concentrations of PEP. PKM2 is allosterically activated
  by the glycolytic metabolite fructose-1,6-biphosphate (FBP) and serine. This leads
  to accumulation of energy rich phospho metabolites upstream of glycolytic pathway
  which are then channelled to macromolecule biosynthesis via pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP). These pathways include pyrimidine, glycerol, and serine/glycine biosynthesis
  (red arrows) instead of leading to oxidative metabolism for energy production thereby
  promoting cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth.
