caption: 'Role of inositol in insulin signalling pathway (inspired on Larner and Brautigan).
  Upon binding with its receptor (IR), insulin induces IRS‐1 recruitment and activation.
  One of the principal IR/IRS target, PI3K, then generates Phosphatidilinositol to
  activate PDK1 and subsequently PKB/Akt. These actions are involved in GLUT4 translocation
  and in glycogen synthesis. According to the theory of Larner and Brautigan, IR activation
  might also be coupled to a heterotrimeric G protein, which in turn activates a phospholipase
  responsible for Glycosilphosphatidylinositol hydrolysis with the production of soluble
  inositol phosphoglycans. Upon insulin receptor activation, inositol phosphoglycans
  are released outside the cell and subsequently reimported by SMIT. Inositol phosphoglycans
  may act as a putative second insulin messenger. In the cytoplasm, inositol phosphoglycan
  binds to and allosterically activates PP2Cα and/or IRS, with the consequent direct
  stimulation of glycogen synthase. In the mitochondria, activated PDHP stimulates
  PDH and consequently glucose oxidative metabolism. Abbreviations: GLUT‐4 glucose
  transporter 4; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; IR, insulin receptor; IRS insulin
  receptor substrates; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDHP, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase;
  PDK‐1 phosphoinositide‐dependent kinase 1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3 kinase; PKB/Akt,
  protein kinase B/Akt; SMIT, sodium/myo‐inositol transporter; PP2Cα, phosphoprotein
  phosphatase 2C alpha'
