caption: Schematic summary of the AR structure, AR-directed treatments, and interactions
  with BRD4 and OCT1. (A) Overview of the AR locus, the structure of full length (FL)
  and variant (AR-V7, ARv567es) forms of the AR, and various AR-targeted treatments
  that are approved (green) or in development (yellow). (B) Summary of the interactions
  between different forms of the AR, BRD4, and OCT1 on chromatin.
