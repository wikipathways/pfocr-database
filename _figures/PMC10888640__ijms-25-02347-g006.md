caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathway for diperamycin. PKS and NRPS similar domains
  are shown in the same color. Crossed domains indicate they are inactive.The biosynthesis
  would start by synthesizing the C15 polyketide chain using the Type I PKS DpnP.
  This comprises four subunits, each one containing one module (M): DpnP1, which corresponds
  to the loading module (LM), and DpnP2, DpnP3 and DpnP4, which correspond to the
  extension modules M2, M3 and M4, respectively. All modules contain the minimal three
  domains of a modular PKS: a β-ketoacyl synthase (KS), an acyltransferase (AT) and
  an acyl carrier protein (ACP). Moreover, DpnP2 and DpnP3 have a ketoreductase (KR)
  and a dehydratase (DH) domain, and DpnP3 has an additional enoyl reductase (ER)
  domain. All ACPs contain a conserved serine residue for attachment of the phosphopantetheine
  arm [21]. The KS domain of the extension modules features the catalytic triad C-H-H,
  essential for the decarboxylative condensation of acyl units during the elongation
  of the polyketide chain [22]. In the KS domain of the DpnP1 LM, the cysteine residue
  is replaced by glutamine, constituting a ketosynthase-like decarboxylase domain
  (KSQ) [23]. Analyses of AT domains indicate that all contain the GHSxGE motif around
  the catalytic serine, that the DpnP1 and DpnP4 ATs contain the amino acid sequence
  YASH specific for methyl-malonyl- Coenzyme A (CoA) and that DpnP3 contains the amino
  acid sequence HAFH for malonyl-CoA [24]. The AT in DpnP2 does not contain any of
  those motifs, suggesting that this AT would recognize neither malonyl-CoA nor methyl-malonyl-CoA,
  but another acyl-CoA. DPN includes an unusual octanoyl unit in the polyketide chain
  that would be incorporated by DpnP2. These units are usually derived from hexylmalonyl-CoA
  [25]. This extender unit is also involved in the biosynthesis of some polyketides
  such as filipin [26] or cinnabaramide A [27]. A comparison between the AT from DpnP2
  and the corresponding ATs from PteA5 (filipin) and CinA (cinnabaramide A) highlights
  the amino acid sequence AGHS in DpnP2, PteA5 and CinA, which could be a specific
  motif for hexylmalonyl-CoA. The KR domains of DpnP2 and DpnP3 contain the Nicotinamide
  Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH)-binding site and the catalytic triad K-S-Y.
  They can be classified into the KR B1 type based on the presence of the amino acid
  sequence LDD and the absence of a proline residue next to the catalytic tyrosine
  [24,28]. According to this, the configurations of hydroxy groups in the resulting
  intermediates would be (2R,3R) 3-hydroxy-2-methylacyl [24,28,29]. The DH domain
  of DpnP3 contains the catalytic histidine in the HxxxGxxxxP motif and the invariant
  tyrosine in the amino acid sequence YGP [24], while the DH domain of DpnP2 only
  preserves the first motif, which suggests that this DH domain is inactive. The ER
  domain of DpnP3 contains the NADPH-binding site and a valine residue at position
  52′, which suggests the formation of a (2R) product [29,30]. Therefore, the domain
  composition of modules from DpnP PKS correlates well with the structure of the C15
  polyketide chain of DPN. The only disagreement is that, according to the structure
  of DPN, the biosynthesis of the polyketide moiety would start with acetate, while
  the AT from the LM DpnP1 would specify for methyl-malonate-CoA. Curiously enough,
  this discrepancy also occurs in aurantimycin biosynthesis [18,20]. While the aurantimycin
  compound contains an acetate starter unit, after performing an analysis of the AT
  domain from the LM ArtO encoded by the aurantimycin BGC (art), it was revealed that
  it would also specify for methyl-malonyl-CoA'
