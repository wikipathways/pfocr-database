caption: IL-26 activates AKT and JNK signaling of bypass pathway of EGFR-TKI via interaction
  with its newly identified IL-26 functional receptor EphA3, leading to suppression
  of EGFR-TKI-induced ER stress, which subsequently results in TNBC tumor survival
  and drug resistance. Moreover, production of ER stress-associated inflammatory cytokines/chemokines
  including IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL2 was enhanced following treatment with EGFR-TKI,
  leading to the recruitment of neutrophils in TME, which further promotes the inflammation
  and recruitment of other inflammatory cells such as T cells and macrophages.
