caption: Chloride homeostasis and activity-based therapies. (A) Neuronal GABA receptor-initiated
  responses are highly dependent on chloride homeostasis. In healthy mature neurons,
  KCC2 maintains low intracellular Cl– concentration leading to an inflow of Cl– following
  GABAR activation (left). Whereas SCI decreases KCC2 expression and shifts chloride
  equilibrium (middle), activity-based therapies restore inhibition through an increase
  in KCC2 expression after SCI (right). This overall mitigates the hyperexcitability
  observed after SCI. (B) Rehabilitation increases KCC2 synthesis and post-translational
  mechanisms responsible for KCC2 trafficking to the membrane (increased insertion
  rate to the membrane and/or decreased internalization by endocytosis). Among the
  numerous regulators of KCC2 (not illustrated), BDNF contributes to activity-dependent
  shuttling of KCC2 to the motoneuronal membrane. The regulation of calpains by TrkB
  activation could contribute to decrease the proteolytic cleavage of KCC2 and alters
  its ability to extrude Cl–. Our results also suggest the presence of a retroactive
  feedback loop through which KCC2 can regulate BDNF expression and the activity-dependent
  decrease in the activation of the WNK1, due to higher levels of [Cl–]i that favor
  the activation of KCC2 and inactivation of NKCC1. BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor; GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid; SCI, spinal cord injury.
