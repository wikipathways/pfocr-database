caption: This figure illustrates the core TSC-mTor pathway, as discussed in the text.
  The green signaling path relates to disease such as the Cowden syndrome, Bannayan
  Riley Rucvalcaba, Proteus syndrome and Lhermitte-Duclos. The purple signaling cascade
  relates to disease such as Familial cardiac hypertrophy, the Wolf-Parkinson-White
  syndrome and the Peutz–Jeghers syndrome. The blue signaling path relates to the
  tuberous sclerosis complex disease, affecting multi-organs and often leading to
  neurologic disorders. The red part is active in different types of cancers including
  ovarian, gastrointestinal, breast, sporadic and gall bladder and non-small cell
  carcinoma in the lung. A detailed overview about disease relating to this pathway
  is given in [].
