caption: Model for F-actin polymerization mediated by Rap1 signaling. Upon chemoattractant
  stimulation, Rap1 is rapidly and transiently activated. The activated Rap1 (Rap1-GTP)
  facilitates myosin II disassembly through Phg2, a Ser/Thr kinase, allowing F-actin
  polymerization at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells (). In addition, the activated
  Rap1 is also likely involved in stimulation F-actin polymerization through the Rac
  signaling pathway. Direct interaction of Rap1-GTP with RacGEF1 might contribute
  to the polymerization of F-actin by RacGEF1/RacB signaling (). The unbroken lines
  represent the pathways demonstrated previously (; ; ), and the dotted lines should
  be further confirmed.
