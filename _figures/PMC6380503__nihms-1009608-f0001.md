caption: Several signalling lipids, including fatty acids, fatty acid esters of hydroxy
  fatty acids (FAHFAs), diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramides, regulate intracellular
  pathways to influence insulin resistance. a | Fatty acids regulate insulin sensitivity
  and inflammation. Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),
  possibly via its co-receptor, myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2), which, through
  the adaptor proteins TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)
  and myeloid differentiation primary response protein MYD88, increases the activity
  of pro-inflammatory transcription factors. TRIF activation promotes the nuclear
  translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to increase the expression
  of cytokines. MYD88 activation increases phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) kinase (IKKβ), which further phosphorylates inhibitor of NF-κB
  (IκB), leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB to increase pro-inflammatory cytokine
  expression. MYD88 also activates Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to increase the activity
  of transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP1), thereby altering the expression
  of cytokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, through their receptors (not shown), further
  activate these pro-inflammatory transcription factors to establish a positive feedback
  loop for sustained inflammation. SFA-activated TLR4 and cytokine production impair
  insulin signalling through IKKβ and JNK activation, but the direct targets of IKKβ
  and JNK in the insulin signalling pathway remain to be identified. SFA-mediated
  activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the SRC–JNK pathway and the incorporation
  of SFAs into diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramides also impair insulin signalling by
  inhibiting phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1
  (IRS1) or AKT. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) exert anti-inflammatory effects
  by activating G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), which recruits β-arrestin
  2 and sequesters TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1) to inhibit the TAK1-mediated activation
  of JNK and IKKβ. PUFA, FAHFAs and resolvins may exert anti-inflammatory effects
  by activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in antigen-presenting cells such
  as macrophages to inhibit cytokine production. The dashed lines indicate indirect
  effects. b | DAG and ceramide may induce insulin resistance. DAG accumulates ectopically
  in insulin-resistant muscle and liver. In muscle, DAG-activated protein kinase Cθ
  (PKCθ) promotes the phosphorylation of IRS1 on Ser1101 in mice, impairing IRS1 phosphorylation
  on tyrosine and attenuating insulin signalling. In liver, DAG-activated PKCε promotes
  phosphorylation of IR on Thr1160 to suppress insulin signalling. As a result of
  DAG increase, glucose uptake via insulin responsive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)
  in muscle is reduced, and glucose output via GLUT2 from liver is increased; these
  changes induce hyperglycaemia. Ceramides contribute to hyperglycaemia by activating
  protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A), which dephosphorylates AKT, and stimulating PKCλ
  and PKCζ, which prevent AKT from associating with the membrane, thereby inhibiting
  AKT activity.
