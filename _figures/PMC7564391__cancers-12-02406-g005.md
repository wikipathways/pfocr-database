caption: Major lncRNAs involved in taxane resistance. LINC01118 and urothelial carcinoma
  associated 1 (UCA1) promote taxane resistance via activating ATP-binding cassette
  (ABC) family and drug efflux. Linc00312 circumvents taxane resistance through suppressing
  Bcl2 and inducing apoptosis. Succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A, flavoprotein
  pseudogene 1 (SDHAP1) promotes taxane resistance via sponging miR-4465, consequently
  enhancing EIF4G2 and initiating protein translation. FER1L4 mitigates taxane resistance
  by suppressing the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. UCA1 promotes
  taxane resistance by regulating the miR-654-5p/SIK2 axis. NEAT1 promotes taxane
  resistance via sponging miR-194, thereby activating ZEB1 and EMT. KB-1471A8.2 ameliorates
  taxane resistance by blocking CDK4 and S-phase entry.
