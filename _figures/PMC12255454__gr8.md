caption: 'A pathway map for individual molecular subspecies of sphingolipids beginning
  from production of the sphingoid base backbone through subsequent metabolic steps,
  emphasizing key branchpoints (nodes). As in Figure 6, this diagram depicts sphingolipid
  metabolism but tracks the fate of every metabolite through each step and branchpoint.
  It begins in the lower left with condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA (noting
  the possibility of alternative precursors alanine, glycine and other fatty acyl-CoAs)
  to form 3-ketosphinganine (3KSa) (analogous processes shown for the keto intermediates
  of 1-deoxy- and 1-deoxymethyl-sphingoid bases, and analogous branches could be drawn
  for additional chain length sphingoid bases from other fatty acyl-CoAs). The 3-keto-intermediates
  can undergo reduction (for example, 3KSa to sphinganine, Sa) or N-acylation by ceramide
  synthases (CerS), which define a key branchpoint (see beige insert for the CerS
  nodes) that results in multiple chain-length 3-keto-dihydroceramides, 3-ketoDhCer
  (and 3-keto-1-deoxy-DhCer, etc.) depending on the substrate selectivities of the
  CerS and availability of the precursor fatty acyl-CoA''s. For this figure, the CerS
  nodes depict the major fatty acyls of most mammalian tissues (16–26 carbon atoms)
  which are utilized by CerS1-6 (the gray arcs in the insert). Sa (and 1-deoxySa,
  etc.) are likewise N-acylated to DhCer (1-deoxy-DhCer, etc.) or phosphorylated to
  sphinganine 1-phosphate (Sa1P) (and possibly cleaved to hexadecanal) or N-methylated
  once or multiple times (N-Me-Sa: N-Mono-, Di-, and Tri-Methyl-Sa). DhCer can be
  metabolized to more complex sphingolipids (see insert for Headgroup nodes) or desaturated
  to Cer and also undergo headgroup addition; or Cer can be hydrolyzed to sphingosine
  (So), phosphorylated to S1P (and possibly cleaved to hexadecenal) or N-methylated
  (N-Me-So: N-Mono-, Di-, and Tri-Methyl-So). The initial headgroup options for (Dh)Cer
  are (see Headgroup nodes): Cer 1-phosphate (C1P), sphingomyelin (SM), Cer phosphoethanolamine
  (not shown), glucosylCer (GlcCer) and galactosylCer (GalCer); both GlcCer and GalCer
  can be further metabolized to more complex glycosphingolipids as shown by a few
  examples in this diagram (eg, lactosylCer: LacCer, and gangliosides GM3, GM2 and
  GM1 from GlcCer and a sulfatide, Gal-sulfatide) (for more downstream metabolites
  see Fig. 5). Note that the nodes for N-acyl-1-deoxy- sphingolipids do not display
  headgroup steps because they lack the 1-hydroxyl-group. When this scheme is used
  to depict lipidomics data (these data are from reference (210)), fold differences
  can be visualized for each analyzed compound using a heatmap with a color scale
  that represents the fold change. This particular data set compares the relative
  change in sphingolipids in MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with 10 μM Fenretinide
  (a desaturase inhibitor) for 24 h versus the control cells minus the drug. More
  information can be found in references (209, 210)'
