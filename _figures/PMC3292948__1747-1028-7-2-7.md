caption: Speculative model of a putative pathway induced by DNMT1 depletion. Schematic
  shows the effects of DNMT1 depletion perceived by a "sensor" factor (p14ARF) that
  activates a pathway p53-controlled triggering G1 arrest in normal cells. If p53
  or p14ARF are absent or not working properly, cells are unable to sense DNMT1 depletion
  and, thus, progress in the cell cycle incorrectly with wrong DNA methylation patterns
  triggering aneuploidy.
