caption: 'Tyrosinase (TYR) and Tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) processing and
  the melanin biosynthetic pathway in the melanocyte and in the melanosome, respectively.
  A) Schematic representation of melanosome biogenesis in the melanocyte and trafficking
  of TYR and TYRP1 from the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) via Golgi apparatus to the
  developing melanosome. Places are indicated where the transport or sorting of TYR
  and TYRP1 from the synthesis in the ER to the melanosomes is abolished caused by
  mutations in the four genes found to be responsible for OCA (OCA1 to OCA4, respectively)
  (adapted from [49]). B) Illustration of the melanin (eumelanin/pheomelanin) biosynthesis
  pathway in the melanosome. DHI: 5,6-Dihydroxyindole, DHICA: 5,6-Dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic
  acid, TYR: tyrosinase, TYRP1: Tyrosinase-related protein 1 (DHICA oxidase), DCT:
  Dopachrome tautomerase.'
