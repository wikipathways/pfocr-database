caption: Schematic illustration of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, with the main
  flavonoids in representative horticultural species. Amounts of flavonoids (from
  USDA database; https://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata []) are indicated as a red
  heatmap ranging from the species with lower to those with higher content. PAL, Phenylalanine
  ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase;
  CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; IFS, isoflavone synthase; FNS,
  flavone synthase; F3H, flavanone-3-hydroxylase; F3’H, flavanone-3’-hydroxylase;
  F3’5’H, flavanone-3’5’-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; OMT1, O-methyltransferase 1; GTs, glycosyltransferases;
  PATs, phenylacyl-transferases.
