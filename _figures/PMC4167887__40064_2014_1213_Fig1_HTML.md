caption: Schematic overview over the creatine pathway. The synthesis of creatine is
  a two-step mechanism (Wyss & Kaddurah-Daouk ). In the first step GATM produces guanidinoacetate
  and ornithine based on glycine and arginine. Guanidinoacetate is subsequently converted
  to creatine by GAMT. Finally, creatine phosphate is generated by creatine kinases
  like CKMT, CKB or CKM, which use the phosphate groups of ATP molecules to phosphorylate
  creatine molecules. They also catalyse the reverse reaction, the phosphorylation
  of ADP by creatine phosphate. The creatine transporter CT1 is in charge of the transport
  of creatine through the membranes of the target cells. As around 2% of the total
  creatine content is non-enzymatically converted to creatinine per day, which is
  excreted, creatine has to be synthesized continuously or to be taken up by diet.
