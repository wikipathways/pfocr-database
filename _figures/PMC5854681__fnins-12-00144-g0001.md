caption: 'Differential control of distinct stages in adult SVZ-OB neurogenesis by
  different cell cycle regulatory proteins. In response to the proper cues, quiescent
  type-B stem cells get activated to produce rapidly dividing type-C progenitors,
  which in turn preferentially commit to a neuronal lineage as neuroblasts that migrates
  along the RMS and differentiate into post-mitotic interneurons in the OB. These
  four populations are under the tight control of the cell cycle machinery. In both
  NSCs/type-B cells and NPCs/type-C cells, a classical/general signaling pathway can
  be constructed based on existing literature: Pten -> p53 -> Cdki -> Cdk/Cyclin ->
  Rb family member/E2f. However, distinct members of these protein families seem to
  play non-redundant roles during these two stages e.g., p21, Cdk2, and p107 act specifically
  in type-B maintenance while p27, Cdk6, and Rb preferentially regulate type-C proliferation.
  Interestingly, within the same population, family members can have non-overlapping
  functions e.g., p63 and p73 in controlling survival of type B cells, or even more,
  might have opposing roles e.g., E2f3a and E2f3b in regulating Sox2-dependent expansion
  of the NSCs pool. In neuroblasts, several cell-cycle proteins switch to non-cycling
  tasks as they act to maintain neuronal commitment e.g., p21 and Cdk6 and neuroblast
  migration e.g., Cdk5. Finally, following neuronal maturation, specific regulators
  e.g., Rb, p53, Cdk5 act to preserve cell cycle suppression by inhibiting cell-cycle
  re-entry (CCE), a process prone to deregulation in the aging OB, thus potentially
  leading to neurodegeneration. (+); positive control, (–); negative control.'
