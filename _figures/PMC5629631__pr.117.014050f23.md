caption: 'Multiple modes of AOAA’s action in cancer cells. By directly inhibiting
  CBS and CSE activity, by suppressing H2S formation through the 3-MST pathway via
  inhibition of CAT, and by inhibiting a variety of transaminases (including GOT1,
  a key enzyme of the malate/aspartate shuttle), AOAA acts as an inducer of “synthetic
  lethality” in cancer cells. CBS-derived and 3-MST-derived H2S supports mitochondrial
  electron transport and cancer cell bioenergetics by donating electrons at complex
  II, by stimulating ATP synthase, and by inhibiting intramitochondrial adenyl cyclase
  (this latter effect is not shown on this scheme). By inhibiting CBS and CAT, AOAA
  suppresses this bioenergetic pathway. The malate-aspartate shuttle translocates
  electrons that are produced in glycolysis across the semipermeable inner membrane
  of the mitochondrion to support oxidative phosphorylation. These electrons enter
  the electron transport chain at complex I. The shuttle system is required because
  the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NADH (a primary reducing equivalent
  of the electron transport chain). In humans, the cytoplasmic enzyme (GOT1) is one
  of the key enzymes in the malate shuttle: it functions to catalyze the interconversion
  of aspartate and α-ketoglutarate to oxaloacetate and glutamate using pyridoxal phosphate
  as a cofactor. By inhibiting GOT, AOAA reduces the transfer of electron donors to
  the mitochondria, thereby suppressing cancer cell bioenergetics. By the simultaneous
  inhibition of H2S production and various transaminases, AOAA interferes with key
  pathways of cancer cell mitochondrial function.'
