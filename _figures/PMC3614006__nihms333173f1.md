caption: Regulation of Akt Activation by the PI 3-K pathway. The figure shows the
  major upstream regulators of Akt. Receptor tyrosine kinases such as the PDGF receptor
  stimulate recruitment of PI 3-K to the membrane where it interconverts PI45P2 into
  PIP3. This stimulates recruitment of inactive Akt to the cell surface, concomitant
  with recruitment of PDK-1. PDK-1 and TORC2 phosphorylate Akt at T308 and S473, respectively,
  and lock the enzyme in the catalytically-competent conformation. Akt can relocalize
  to intracellular locations and phosphorylate a large number of substrates, which
  harbor the consensus motif RxRxxs/t. The pathway is terminated by two critical negative
  regulators, both of which are tumor suppressors in cancer. PTEN dephosphorylates
  PIP3 back into PI45P2 and PHLPP dephosphorylates Akt at S473.
