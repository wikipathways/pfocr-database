caption: 'The system consists of two exogenous components, XI and KHK, which convert
  d-xylose to d-xylulose and X1P, respectively. X1P is then metabolized by S. cerevisiae
  endogenous enzymes—FBA1, GRE2 and/or ADH1—producing glycolaldehyde and DHAP as intermediates
  and EG and ethanol as final products. XKS1 deletion allows the metabolic flux to
  be directed to the synthetic pathway via X1P by eliminating a possible route of
  xylulose utilization via X5P through the PPP. Abbreviations in the figure are: PPP,
  pentose phosphate pathway; XI, xylose isomerase; KHK, ketohexokinase; FBA1, fructose
  1,6-bisphosphate aldolase; GRE2, 3-methylbutanal reductase; ADH1, alcohol dehydrogenase;
  XKS1, xylulokinase; GRE3, aldose reductase; EG, ethylene glycol; Xylulose-1P, xylulose
  1-phosphate; Xylulose-5P/X5P, xylulose 5-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate;
  GADP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; S7P, sedoheptulose 7-phosphate; F6P, fructose
  6-phosphate; E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate.'
