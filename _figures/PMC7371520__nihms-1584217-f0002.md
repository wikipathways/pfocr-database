caption: Caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis requires activation of the canonical inflammasomes,
  including NLRP1b, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2 and Pyrin. The NLRs are characterized by the
  combined presence of a nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT) and
  a variable number of LRRs. They also contain either a caspase recruitment domain
  (CARD) or pyrin domain (PYD) in their amino-terminus. The AIM2 protein is composed
  of a N-terminal PYD and a C-terminal DNA-binding HIN200 domain. The pyrin protein
  has a N-terminal PYD, a bZIP transcription factor domain, a B-box, a coiled-coil,
  and a C-terminal B30.2 domain. NLRP1b and NLRC4 recruit caspase-1 via their CARD
  domain, and the bipartite PYD-CARD adaptor protein ASC is required for assembly
  of the AIM2, NLRP3 and pyrin inflammasomes. The pyrin protein also binds directly
  to caspase-1 via its B30.2 domain. Caspase-1-independent pyroptosis requires the
  activation of caspase-11, which recognizes cytosolic LPS and cleaves GSDMD to initiate
  pyroptosis. In this pathway, GSDMDNT also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and thereby
  caspase-1-dependent maturation of IL-1β and IL-18. Caspase-3-dependent pyroptosis
  requires the activation of Gasdermin E (GSDME). Caspase-3 can be activated by the
  mitochondrial and death receptor pathway. Active caspase-3 cleaves GSDME, to produce
  GSDME N-fragments (GSDMENT), which then forms pores in the plasma membrane.
