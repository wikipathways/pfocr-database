caption: Overview of metabolic changes in RIL165 and RIL387, visualised by MapMan.
  Each entity within a pathway is depicted by a colour signal where red signifies
  genes with higher expression in RIL387 compared to RIL165 and blue signifies genes
  with higher expression in RIL165 compared to RIL387. The intensity of the colour
  indicates the level of expression []. Scale bar displays Log2fold changes. Genes
  binned to each pathway is available in Additional file
papertitle: RNA-Seq analysis of resistant and susceptible sub-tropical maize lines
  reveals a role for kauralexins in resistance to grey leaf spot disease, caused by
  Cercospora zeina.
