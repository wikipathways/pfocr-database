caption: '(a) ERα binds to estrogen and gets activated in the cytoplasm. After activation,
  ERαs dimerize and are translocated into the nucleus, where they bind to the estrogen
  response element (ERE) on ERα target genes. The recruitment of coactivators (CoA)
  and corepressors (CoR) to ERα facilitates the transcriptional activity of ERα. The
  activated ERα induces the expression of growth factor receptor ligands, such as
  TGFα and amphiregulin, and membrane tyrosine receptor kinases (e.g., HER1 and HER2)
  to augment the activity of the HER2 signaling pathway. (b) The non-genomic action
  of ERα occurs transiently outside the nucleus. The estrogen-activated ERα in the
  plasma membrane and/or cytosol can interact with and activate HER2, and subsequently
  activate a downstream signaling cascade. In addition, the overexpression of HER2
  sequesters ERα in the cytosol, which augments the non-genomic activity of ERα. (c)The
  downstream signaling output of the HER pathway diverges into two major signaling
  axes: PI3K/AKT (AKT signaling module) and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK signaling module).
  These two signaling pathways are involved in cell proliferation and survival. The
  activation of the AKT and MAPK signaling modules phosphorylates and activates ERα.
  Furthermore, the activation of ERK can enhance the function of CoAs (e.g., AIB1)
  but diminish the function of CoRs (e.g., SMRT).'
