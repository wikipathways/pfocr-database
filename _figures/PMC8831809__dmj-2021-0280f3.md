caption: Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) in insulin resistance. In HBP, fructose-6-phosphate
  (F-6-P) is converted to glucosamine-6-phosphate (Glucosamine-6-P) by glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate
  amidotransferase (GFAT), and glucosamine-6-P is converted to uridine 5’-diphosphate
  N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which serves as the donor sugar nucleotide for
  the O-GlcNAcylation of lipids and proteins. O-GlcNAcylation could affect target
  proteins by regulating gene expressions or enzyme activities. Insulin signaling
  pathway components, mammalian uncoordinated-18c (Munc18-c), and forkhead box O1
  (FOXO1) are modified with O-GlcNAc. PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate;
  PIP3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1;
  PKB, protein kinase B; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; GSV, GLUT4 storage vesicle;
  GLUT4, glucose transporter type 4; GYS, glycogen synthease; OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase;
  OGA, O-GlcNAcase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; PFK-1, phosphofructokinase 1; PDH,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase; NADH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; TCA, trichloroacetic
  acid.
