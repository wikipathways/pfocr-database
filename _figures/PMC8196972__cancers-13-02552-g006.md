caption: 'Proposed mechanistic scheme of the relevance of the CCL2/CCR2 axis in PMF
  and the related consequences of rs1024611 SNP. (A) HD and PV/ET CD34+ cells do not
  express CCR2, and pro-proliferative signals are transduced by cytokine-receptor-mediated
  downstream signaling, i.e., JAK/STAT, MAP-kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways; in ET and
  PV the intracellular signaling is constitutively active due to the presence of somatic
  driver mutation(s) and accounts for myeloproliferation. (B) PMF CD34+ cells uniquely
  express CCR2, which signals mainly via the Akt pathway. CCR2-downstream signaling
  potentiates cytokine-receptor signaling, also constitutively activated, in this
  case, by somatic driver mutation(s). In this setting, CCL2 levels become extremely
  relevant: due to the dose-dependent effects of the G allele on CCL2 production,
  A/A and A/G may result in a mild disease phenotype, while G/G subjects, who are
  genetically predisposed to produce the highest chemokine levels, will result in
  a more aggressive disease. In other terms, when the PMF neoplastic clone arises
  in a G/G host genetic background, it will lead to a disease with worse outcome.'
