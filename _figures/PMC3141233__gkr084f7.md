caption: 'A model for the role of FANCD2 in Ad replication-dependent recombination.
  (A) The asynchronous Ad5 replication produces a displaced single strand that initiates
  the recombination process, possibly through viral DBP. While BLM seems to inhibit
  this process (), our data suggest that FANCD2 promotes Ad recombination. (B) A model
  showing the three pathways involved in FANCD2 activation: the first requires the
  FANC core complex, ATR and CHK1 and is induced by DNA damage (,,,); the second requires
  FANC core and ATR and is induced by CHK1 knockdown or inhibition (); and the third,
  induced by either cellular (,) or viral (our data) DNA replication, is independent
  of ATR signalling but requires the FANC core complex.'
