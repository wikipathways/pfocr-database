caption: Flux maps showing carbon fluxes through central metabolism in developing
  embryos of C. sativa. Embryos were cultured under dark (A), physiological (B), and
  high light (C) conditions for 6 (A, B) or 9 (C) d with U-13C Ala, or U-13C Gln,
  or 1-13C Glc, or 80% 1,2-13C Glc and 20% U-13C Glc (4 labeling experiments per light
  condition, ≥3 replicates per experiment). The labeling, uptake, and growth rate
  data were used to quantify the metabolic fluxes by 13C-MFA. Arrow sizes correspond
  to flux intensity and boxes represent metabolites that were modeled as a single
  pool across compartments. Values are in units of nmol substrate C embryo−1 d−1 and
  indicate the average net flux ± 90% confidence interval (see “Materials and Methods”).
