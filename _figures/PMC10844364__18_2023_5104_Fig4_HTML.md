caption: Novel acylations act as significant regulators in HCC metastasis. The Kcr
  of SEPT2 promotes the invasion of HCC cells through Akt signaling. The downregulation
  of TFAM increases the level of mal-CoA, and induces mDia2 Kmal, thereby facilitating
  the metastasis of HCC cells by promoting the expression of metastasis-promoting
  genes. Furthermore, Kla is involved in multiple metabolic-related pathways, thus
  promoting the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells. In addition, ALDH6A1 upregulates
  the production of propionyl-CoA, thereby hampering CS activity. The CS with reduced
  activity suppresses the proliferation and migration of HCC cells through downregulating
  TCA cycle. Knockdown of HDACs or HDACi treatment improves the Kcr level, and thus
  limit hepatoma cell motility and proliferation. (Created with BioRender.com.)
