caption: Pathways of activation of naïve CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell (Treg) (tTreg).
  (A) Polyclonal expansion of tTreg. The most common expansion pathway of tTreg by
  IL-2 with non-antigen-specific stimulation leads to polyclonal expansion of tTreg,
  which do not express receptors for interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-5, or IL-12 and have no
  increased capacity to suppress. To suppress normal immune responses, tTreg are required
  at ratios of ≥1:1 (, ). (B) Antigen-specific expansion of tTreg. tTreg that have
  TCR for specific-alloantigen can be activated by antigen and either IL-2 or IL-4.
  tTreg with TCR for specific-alloantigen are activated by antigen and IL-2 to Ts1
  cells, which have increased potency to suppress responses to specific-alloantigen
  (). These cells are induced to express IFNGR and IL-12Rβ2 and can be further activated
  by either IFN-γ or IL-12 (), in the presence of specific-alloantigen. This further
  activation is blocked if IL-2 is present (). They are induced to express T-bet and
  IFN-γ, and are Th1-like Treg (). These Th1-activated tTreg depend on IFN-γ or IL-12p70
  as well as stimulation with specific-alloantigen for their survival and function.
  In the Th2 activation pathway, IL-4 and alloantigen induce Ts2 cells that express
  the specific receptor for IL-5Rα (). IL-5 promotes Ts2 cells to become Th2-like
  Treg. IL-4 also, in the absence of antigen, induces polyclonal expansion of tTreg.
  These separate pathways of activation of tTreg by Th1 and Th2 cytokines explain
  the in vitro findings with CD4+CD25+ T cells from tolerant rats described here.
  The requirement of either IFN-γ or IL-5, and possibly other cytokine, for antigen-specific
  CD4+CD25+ Treg to survive, explains the findings that CD4+CD25+ T cells from tolerant
  hosts die in vitro and do not suppress unless key cytokines are present.
