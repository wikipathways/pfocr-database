caption: ARNO/ARF6 signaling pathways that could modulate actin reorganization in
  the axonal growth cone. ARNO stimulates GTP exchange on ARF6, thereby increasing
  the amount of active ARF6. In one pathway, activated ARF6 stimulates the lipid-modifying
  enzyme PI(4)P 5-Kinase, leading to local increases in plasma membrane PIP2 and changes
  in actin dynamics. Alternatively, activation of Rac1 by upstream Rac1 activators
  or indirectly by ARF6-GTP results in stimulation of actin polymerization. Both of
  these pathways could ultimately regulate axonal growth cone dynamics.
