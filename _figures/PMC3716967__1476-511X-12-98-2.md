caption: Regulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Details of these processes and abbreviations
  are described in the text. Briefly, ceramide is formed from L-serine and palmitoyl
  CoA via de novo pathway. Ceramide can also be formed from SM hydrolysis by SMase,
  glucosyl ceramide hydrolysis by Glucocerebrosidase and from sphingosine by ceramide
  synthase. Sphingolipid metabolites are depicted in box and enzymes are shown outside
  the box. Some pharmacological inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes are
  also shown.
