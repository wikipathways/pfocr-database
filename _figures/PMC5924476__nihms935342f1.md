caption: The site of action is the chromaffin cell and vesicle. Tyrosine is taken
  up by the cell, where it is enzymatically converted by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
  to L-DOPA (rate-limiting reaction). L DOPA is then converted to dopamine by aromatic
  L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and the dopamine is rapidly transported by vesicular
  monoamine transporter (VMAT) inside the vesicle, where it is converted by dopamine
  β-hydroxylase (DβH) with ascorbic acid (ASC) as cofactor and resulting in norepinephrine
  and dehydroascorbate (DHA). Norepinephrine is transported outside the vesicle by
  VMAT, where it is converted to epinephrine by cytosolic phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
  (PNMT). Dehydroascorbate inside the vesicle is reduced to ascorbic acid by CYB561,
  which itself becomes oxidized. CYB561 is then reduced by cytosolic ascorbic acid,
  completing the cycle.
