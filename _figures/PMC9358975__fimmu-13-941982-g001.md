caption: Mechanism of action of MiRNAs in DR inflammation, oxidative stress and neurodegeneration.
  (A) Mechanism of action of MiRNAs in DR inflammation. The targeting of miR-30a to
  CCL2 in retina enhances the phagocytosis of microglia in the retina. MiR-15a and
  miR-16 can inhibit the proinflammatory signaling pathway and stasis of retinal white
  blood cells in DR by inhibiting IL-1β, CD45, TNF-α and NF-κB. MiR-27a involves in
  the inflammatory response of DR by targeting TLR4 to stimulate the production of
  TNF-α and IL-1β as well as pro-inflammatory proteins including cyclooxygenase-2
  and inducible nitric oxide synthase. The up-regulation of MiR-455-5p significantly
  attenuated the HG-stimulated inflammatory response by inhibiting the release of
  inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α in ARPE-19 cells. (B) Mechanism
  of action of MiRNAs in the oxidative stress of DR. The overexpression of MiRNA-145
  can reduce the levels of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) in cells, and increase the
  activity of superoxide dismutase, thus reducing hyperglycemia-induced oxidative
  stress and retinal endothelial cell apoptosis. MiRNA-383 can promote the production
  of ROS and induce apoptosis by increasing the expression of peroxidase redoxin 3
  (PRDX3) and Bax/Bcl2. MiR-183 activates PI3K/Akt/VEGF signaling pathway, and increases
  CD34, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and ROS. MiR-27 inhibits Nox 2 signaling
  pathway by down-regulating P13K/AKT/mTOR, thus reducing the production of ROS. (C)
  Mechanism of action of MiRNAs in the neural degeneration of DR. MiR-495 affects
  the transmission of PTEN/Akt signal by targeting Notch1 and aggravates the damage
  to ganglion cells. MiR-34a promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and retinal microvascular
  endothelial cell senescence by inhibiting SIRT1/PGC-1α axis and mitochondrial antioxidants
  TrxR2 and SOD2. MiR-451a protects mitochondrial function through down-regulation
  and activation of transcription factor 2 (ATF2) and its downstream target genes
  CyclinA1, CyclinD1 and MMP2. The up-regulation of miR-486-3P can protect Müller
  cells in the HG state from oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis by inhibiting
  TLR4/NF-kB axis.
