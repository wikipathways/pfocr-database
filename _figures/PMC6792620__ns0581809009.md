caption: Diagrammatic representation of a hypothetical model of a cascade of changes
  of neuronal activity in the basal ganglia after systemic injections of apomorphine
  (modified from ). After apomorphine (APO) challenge, the activity of striatopallidal
  GABAergic neurons with hypersensitive D2 receptors is suppressed, with consequent
  disinhibition of the globus pallidus (GP). Apomorphine could directly induce c-Fos
  activation in the DA-denervated subthalamic nucleus (STN). The lesion-induced DA
  denervation of the neocortex (Cx) could also affect the excitability of the STN
  to cause the c-Fos activation in the STN after injections of apomorphine. Stimulation
  of striatal D2 receptors with supersensitive state may suppress the activity of
  the entopeduncular nucleus (EP) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) through
  an inhibition of the activity of glutamatergic STN neurons (indirect pathway). The
  suppression of the activity of the EP and SNR can lead to disinhibition of the activity
  in their target structures, such as the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VM), superior
  colliculus (SC), and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). Stimulation of striatal D1
  receptors, which directly suppresses the neuronal activity in the EP and SNR (direct
  pathway), also leads to bursting activity in the VM, SC, and PPN by a disinhibitory
  mechanism. The graft-mediated reversal of the increased levels of striatal D1 and
  D2 receptors can partly reverse the altered activity of basal ganglia circuitry
  to attenuate the apomorphine-induced bursting activity of the GP as well as the
  basal ganglia target structures.
