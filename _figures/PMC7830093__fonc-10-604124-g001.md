caption: 'A comparative view of wild-type p53 function in ESC maintenance, differentiation,
  and somatic-cell reprogramming of human and mouse: ESC maintenance: p53 is maintained
  in an inactive state in both human and mouse ESCs. In hESCs, deacetylated inactive
  p53 is present in low levels in the nucleus while in mESCs the inactive p53 protein
  is abundantly present in the cytoplasm. ESC self-renewal: To ensure ESC self-renewal,
  p53 is either prevented from entering the nucleus or maintained in an inactive state.
  In hESCs, Oct4 increases Sirt1 expression which in turn deacetylates p53 and promote
  its degradation by MDM2. This maintains a low level of p53 in the cell which is
  crucial to maintain stemness. Endogenous ROS induced p53 nuclear translocation in
  mESCs is blocked by Sirt1. This prevents p53 mediated suppression of Nanog and stem-cell
  phenotype is maintained. Phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of p53 by Aurka
  also promotes pluripotency of mESCs. ESC differentiation: In hESCs, CBP/p300 mediated
  acetylation of p53 leads to its activation and subsequent transcription of p21,
  miR-34a and miR-145 which facilitates differentiation. DNA damage in hESCs also
  leads to differentiation or apoptosis. When Aurka levels are low in mESCs, p53 transcribes
  ectodermal and mesodermal genes leading to differentiation. Also, upon DNA damage,
  p53 primarily promotes differentiation by suppression of Nanog. However, occasionally
  p53 may also induce anti-differentiation pathway by activating Wnt. Somatic-cell
  reprogramming: Reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells
  (iPSCs) is primarily inhibited by the p53-p21 pathway in both human and mouse. Additionally,
  p53 may also induce lincRNAp21 or miR-199a-3p to inhibit reprogramming. The p53-PUMA
  axis has also been found to suppress reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts
  (MEFs).'
