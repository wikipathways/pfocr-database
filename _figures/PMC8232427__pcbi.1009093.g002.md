caption: In the left, a metabolic pathway in a cell is considered that synthesizes
  the target product P. The red values indicate positive values for the standard Gibbs
  free energy change ( [in kJ/mol]) and thus potential thermodynamic bottlenecks.
  With an allowed concentration range from 1 M to 10 M for all metabolites except
  for Pex, where a minimum concentration of 5 M was assumed to consider product synthesis
  under high external product concentrations, a negative optimal MDF (OptMDF) value
  would follow, indicating thermodynamic infeasibility of product synthesis in the
  single strain. In the two-strain community (right), the pathway is divided and an
  exchange of metabolite B introduced. With this, individual concentrations of metabolite
  X can be adjusted in the two strains by which thermodynamic feasibility (a positive
  OptMDF) of the overall transformation is achieved (the blue triangles indicate the
  direction of the concentrations of X (high/low) when maximizing the driving force).
  Black arrows in the two-strain solution indicate active and grey arrows inactive
  reactions.
