caption: Model highlighting the possible function and position of heat-induced  among
  the key players of the -mediated heat-signaling pathway, elicited by the plasma
  membrane during HS. It is previously shown that heat-induced  accumulation causes
  a series of reactions ultimately resulting in induction of Hsps (see text for details).
  The step-wise components involved in this cascade are shown in the rectangular box.
  Heat-induced  might compensate for the loss of  by actively phosphorylating choline
  generated by  breakdown, thereby increasing  biosynthesis. In the AtClpB-C:AtCK2
  divergent pair,  induction during HS by Hsf may help in generation of the required  for
  uninterrupted signaling. The steps in this model indicated by filled arrows are
  based on published evidence. The dotted arrows represent the hypothesis forwarded
  in this study. The cycle shown with circular arrows represents the Kennedy pathway
  for  biosynthesis. CaM, Calmodulin; CBK, calmodulin binding kinase; PLD, phospholipase
  D; Rboh, respiratory burst oxidase homolog. [See online article for color version
