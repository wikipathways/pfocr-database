caption: Influence of GSKs on proteins participating in various developmental, hormonal,
  and stress response pathways (continuation). Green arrows indicate stimulation,
  whereas red lines with the bullet points represent suppression. Solid circles containing
  the letter “P” denote phosphorylation events. Positive and negative effects of the
  phosphorylations on the target proteins are represented by green and red arrows,
  respectively. Detailed description is given in the text. ATG8, Autophagy8; RD26,
