caption: Differential effects of HBZ on the Jun family proteins. HBZ specifically
  interacted with all three members of the Jun Family (JunB, c-Jun, and JunD), but
  it regulates differently the transcriptional properties of the Jun family. HBZ dramatically
  suppressed c-Jun- and JunB-induced transcriptional activation from the AP-1 element
  by sequestering c-Jun and JunB into HBZ-NB and by decreasing the steady-state level
  of c-Jun and the stability of c-Jun protein in cells through a proteasome-dependent
  pathway. It is particularly interesting to note that HBZ has a different and opposite
  action on JunD expression. HBZ can stimulate the transcription of JunD and by nuclear
  retention of RPS25, HBZ allows the expression of an alternative isoform of JunD
  called ΔJunD. Furthermore, HBZ cooperates with JunD and sp1 to enhance transcription
  of the 3′-LTR and also the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT).
