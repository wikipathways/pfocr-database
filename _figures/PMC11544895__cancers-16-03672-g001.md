caption: 'The signaling pathway associated with the activation of the Gαq/11 protein.
  A ligand binds to a GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor) embedded in the cell membrane,
  triggering the activation of the G protein complex. The activated Gαq/11 subunit
  activates phospholipase C (PLC), which then catalyzes the hydrolysis of PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate) into two secondary messengers: diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol
  trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 binds to its receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, leading
  to the release of Ca2+ ions into the cytoplasm. The increase in intracellular calcium
  concentration acts as a signal for various cellular processes. DAG remains in the
  membrane and activates protein kinase C (PKC),which, in turn, can phosphorylate
  various target proteins involved in cell signaling. PKC also activates phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2), catalyzing the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids,
  which is then metabolized by enzymes such as COX (cyclooxygenase), LOX (lipoxygenase),
  and CYP450 (cytochrome P450) to produce eicosanoids. Eicosanoids are involved in
  modulating processes like cell signaling, inflammation, and carcinogenesis. The
  pathway ultimately influences the regulation of cell proliferation. Specifically,
  the signaling cascade involving PKC and p42/p44 (ERK1/2) MAP kinases contributes
  to the control of cell growth and division. The symbol of a white plus inside a
  green circle in the figure should be understood as an activation'
