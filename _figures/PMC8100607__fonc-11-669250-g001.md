caption: The role of “CSC niche” in regulating cancer stem cell properties. The Tumor
  associated macrophages (TAM) secretes cytokines initiating JAK/STAT and TGF-β signaling
  pathways. The regions where blood supply reduces creates hypoxia, which activates
  Hedge Hog (HH) WNT, Notch and Hippo signaling pathways. The regions where there
  is no oxygen and nutrient supply undergo necrosis, which creates an acidic pH that
  activates Notch and Hippo. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also secret factors
  that initiate different signaling pathways. As a result of the pathway activation,
  several CSC-associated molecules are activated that results in the induction of
  CSCs.
