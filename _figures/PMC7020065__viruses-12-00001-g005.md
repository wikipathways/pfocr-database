caption: During pregnancy recognition (PR) in cattle conceptus produced IFNT increased
  expression of type I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the uterine endometrium and
  increased prostaglandin (PG) production facilitates these effects []. Our previous
  work showed that when endometrial cells were treated with both ncpBVDV and IFNT,
  then the increase in endometrial expression of most ISGs tested (which normally
  accompanies maternal PR) was strongly inhibited []. (a) The present study has extended
  these observations to investigate the upstream signalling pathways involved, notably
  the combined treatment inhibited expression of TYK2, STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9. These
  are all crucial to signalling of type 1 IFNs through the IFNARs and would explain
  why upregulation of many ISGs inhibited ncpBVDV. Of these, only STAT1 is also required
  for signalling via IFNG and the IFNG receptor, therefore this pathway is likely
  to be less affected by ncpBVDV. Following uptake of BVDV into endometrial cells
  by endocytosis, the virus is initially incorporated into the endosome, where it
  may be sensed by TLR3 or TLR7/8. For replication to occur, viral RNA then needs
  to be released into the cytoplasm where it can also be detected by the cytoplasmic
  pattern recognition receptors DDX58 and IFIH1. These receptors signal via TRAF3
  and IRF3 or IRF7 to increase cellular production of type 1 IFN []. We showed previously
  [] that ncpBVDV could inhibit the expression of DDX58 and IFIH1, while the present
  results found inhibition of IRF7. The BVDV protein Npro targets IRF3 toward proteasomal
  degradation []. Therefore, this pathway is also inhibited by the presence of ncpBVDV,
  therefore preventing the host from responding to the virus by producing type 1 IFN.
  Note that the pictures of the virus indicate points in the pathway, which were downregulated
  in ncpBVDV infected cells. These effects may have been indirect. Overall, these
  combined changes induced in the endometrium by ncpBVD are likely to interfere with
  the normal pathways required for pregnancy recognition. (b) With respect to PG production,
  epithelial cells predominantly synthesise PGF2α whereas stromal cells produce most
  of the PGE2 and the conceptus itself synthesises a variety of PGs including PGF2α,
  PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1α. Both endometrial cells and the conceptus contain receptors
  for both PGE and PGF. One of the key actions of IFNT in maternal pregnancy recognition
  is to block the development of oxytocin receptors in the epithelium, therefore preventing
  PGF2α from being released in large pulses, which can cause luteal regression [].
  Nevertheless, total PG production increases substantially in early pregnancy [].
  Our previous work [] has shown that infection of endometrial cells with ncpBVDV
  alone increases PGE2 endometrial synthesis while decreasing PGF2α, thus increasing
  the PGE2:PGF2α ratio. When endometrial cells were treated with both ncpBVDV and
  IFNT, expression of the main PGF synthase AKRB1 was decreased, reducing synthesis
  of PGF2α and endometrial expression of PTGER3, which was inhibited. These changes
  are likely to reduce the required PG signalling within the endometrium during PR
  and have been shown to act in synergy with IFNT [,].

  description: During pregnancy recognition (PR) in cattle conceptus produced IFNT
