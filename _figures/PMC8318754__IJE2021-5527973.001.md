caption: Signaling pathways activated by SHBG. The figure illustrates the action mechanism
  of SHBG as a hormone carrier and SHBG direct actions. (1) Free circulating androgens
  and estrogens that correspond to the bioavailable portion of sex hormones can cross
  the plasma membrane and bind intracellular sex hormone receptors, thus activating
  the “classic,” genomic sex hormone intracellular pathways. (2) As described in the
  literature, free circulating sex hormones can also bind to putative membrane receptors
  activating “fast, nongenomic intracellular signaling pathways.” (3) Another putative
  membrane receptor, for SHBG, can also activate intracellular signaling pathways,
  leading to fast, nongenomic effects. (4) The megalin receptor, which induce the
  internalization of SHBG and a retrograde pathway that affects nuclear and mitochondrial
  function, can also account for some SHBG-induced intracellular effects.
