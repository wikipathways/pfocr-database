caption: Basic intracellular molecular pathways regulating MN survival during development.
  Cells die through apoptosis (Type I), autophagic cell death (Type II) or necrosis
  (not pictured). Two different pathways mediate apoptosis, called the intrinsic and
  extrinsic pathways. The intrinsic pathway involves activation of the pro-apoptotic
  multi-BH-domain proteins (MDP) Bak and Bax and inhibition of the anti-apoptotic
  MDPs Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL by the pro-apoptotic BH3-domain-only proteins (BOPs). Bak/Bax
  activation promote mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), loss of mitochondrial
  membrane potential (ψm), release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt c) and activation
  of caspases (casp3, casp9), which dismantle the cell (lightening strike). Bak/Bax
  activation also depletes (ψm) by causing the transfer of Ca++ from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) to the mitochondrion (M). The extrinsic apoptotic pathway directly
  activates caspases (red arrow) or activates the intrinsic death pathway through
  the BOP Bid (purple arrow). Autophagic death (lightening strike) occurs independently
  of apoptosis and is characterized by the presence of abundant autophagic vacuoles
  (AV) and the activation of autophagic genes (ATGs) such as Beclin 1 (atg6). Cell
  death is regulated by extracellular anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic stimuli that
  operate through neurotrophic factor receptors (NTFRs) or death receptors (DRs).
  Activated DRs activate the extrinsic death pathway by assembling a death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC). Activated NTFRs antagonize apoptotic, autophagic and necrotic
  death by activating cytosolic kinases such as phosphoinositide-3 kinase, Akt and
  B-Raf, inhibiting pro-apoptotic BOP activity, activating anti-apoptotic and inhibiting
  pro-apoptotic gene expression in the nucleus (N). Blue lines indicate anti-apoptotic
  function and black lines depict pro-apoptotic function; arrows indicate activation
  and flat lines indicate inhibition. For details see text.
