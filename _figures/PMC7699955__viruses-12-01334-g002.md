caption: 'HDV and HBV life cycles. Right half: HDV life cycle. HDV virions first attach
  to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) [,,,] and then to the viral receptor sodium
  tautocholate co-transporting peptide (NTCP) [,]. After membrane fusion, the ribonucleoprotein
  (RNP) is released into the cytoplasm and further transported to the nucleus where
  RNA replication occurs [,]. The genome serves as the template for the first rolling
  circle amplification. The resulting antigenome multimers are cleaved in cis by the
  intrinsic ribozyme and ligated into circular antigenome monomers [,]. After a second
  rolling cycle using the antigenome as the template, HDV genome multimers are synthesized
  and self-cleaved to produce circular HDV genome monomers. The HDV antigenome might
  be edited by cellular adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), yielding an
  extended HDAg ORF that produces L-HDAg []. These genomes, with or without ADAR1
  editing, are used as the template for mRNA transcription. The mRNAs are translated
  into S-HDAg and L-HDAg. A portion of the L-HDAg molecules are prenylated for envelope
  acquirement []. S-HDAg and L-HDAg are transported into the nucleus to regulate virus
  replication or bind to the genome to form RNP, which is exported to the cytoplasm.
  Through the interaction between L-HDAg and S-HBsAg, RNP acquires an envelope and
  is released through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi secretory pathway. Left
  half: HBV life cycle. After binding to HSPG and NTCP, HBV is internalized through
  endocytosis []. The fusion of the HBV envelope with the endosome membrane releases
  the nucleocapsid, which is further transported to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)
  where rcDNA is imported into the nucleus. The rcDNA is processed into covalently
  closed circular DNA (cccDNA). This cccDNA serves as the template for HBV mRNAs and
  pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), with the latter captured in the HBV capsid and reverse-transcribed
  to the DNA of the progeny virus via HBV polymerase. The progeny HBV is considered
  to be secreted through a multivesicular body (MVB) []. Notably, HBV DNA might be
  integrated into cellular chromosomes [,]. These integrates can produce HBV envelope
  proteins that support HDV packaging [,,,].'
