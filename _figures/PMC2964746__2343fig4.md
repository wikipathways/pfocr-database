caption: Selected signal transduction pathways that affect AS of transcripts of genes
  important in cancer. (From top left,) hnRNP A1 promotes translation of c-Myc mRNA.
  Translated c-Myc protein can promote the transcription of PTB, hnRNP A1, and hnRNP
  A2, which in turn promote the production of PKM2. The PI3K pathway is activated
  downstream from ligand binding by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), activating AKT,
  which phosphorylates SR proteins such as SRSF1, leading to altered splicing of Fn
  transcripts. IGF1 binding to the IGF receptor (IGF-R) results in activation of the
  SR protein kinases SRPK1/2, which phosphorylate SRSF1 and alter VEGF165 splicing
  in favor of the proangiogenesis isoform. Finally, Fas receptor activation by binding
  to FasL on another cell results in FAST K activation, which in turn results in TIA-1
  phosphorylation and inclusion of exon 6 in the Fas transcript.
