caption: Herbal CAM can intervene at multiple steps in the pathogenesis of autoimmune
  arthritis. Experimental arthritis can be induced in susceptible rodent strains by
  subcutaneous (s.c.), intradermal (i.d.), or intraarticular injection of an arthritogen
  (e.g., Mtb, type II collagen, streptococcal cell wall, etc.). The antigens that
  are injected s.c. or i.d. are directed into the draining lymph nodes where the immune
  responses involving the antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and B cells are initiated.
  The activated lymphocytes and other leukocytes then migrate into the joints and
  initiate arthritic inflammation via a variety of soluble mediators, including proinflammatory
  cytokine and antibodies (). Herbal CAM can inhibit the initiation and progression
  of inflammatory arthritis by influencing multiple pathways involved in the disease
  process. Specific herbs that interfere with particular immune pathway are described
  in .
