caption: Only a small fraction of the glucose (2-5%) enters the HBP, which starts
  with the conversion of the glycolytic metabolite fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine
  to glucosamine-6-phosphate and glutamate by the rate-limiting enzyme GFA. The end
  product of HBP is UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, which is used by OGT as substrate to
  modify proteins by O-GlcNAc linkages. This modification is reversible, and proteins
  are deglycosylated by the O-GlcNAcase (OGA).
