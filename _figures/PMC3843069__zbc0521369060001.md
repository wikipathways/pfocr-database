caption: 'Overview of the tryptophan metabolic pathway. The two most important branches
  of this pathway are the serotonin pathway and the kynurenine pathway. These have
  been marked by gray backgrounds. Metabolites are shown in ellipses, and directions
  of reactions are shown by arrows with the enzyme names next to them. Enzyme names
  are written in uppercase letters. Arrows without enzyme names are non-enzymatic
  reactions. Dotted arrows are reactions for which kinetic data were missing. The
  double vertical lines on the left hand side depict plasma membrane, and the bi-directional
  arrows crossing it show the transport of tryptophan and l-kynurenine. The names
  of the transporters are written next to the arrows. Fkyn, formyl-kynurenine; FAA,
