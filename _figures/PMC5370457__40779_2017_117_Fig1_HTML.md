caption: The mechanism of signaling transduction of vascular permeability. NO, Nitric
  Oxide; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; TNF, Tumor necrosis factor; PKC,
  Protein kinase C; PDE, Phosphodiesterase; cGMP, Cyclic guanosine monophosphate;
  PKG, Protein kinase G; cAMP, Cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA, Protein Kinase
  A; PTK, Protein Tyrosine Kinase; RhoA, Ras homolog gene family member A; ROCK, Rho-associated
  coiled-coil-containing protein kinase; ROS, Reactive oxygen species; Rac, Ras-related
  C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1; PAK, p21-Activated Kinase; Cdc42, Cell division
  control protein 42; AR, Androgen receptor; MLC, Myosin light chain; MLCP, Myosin
  light chain phosphatase; MLCK, Myosin Light Chain Kinase; MAPK, Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; TNFR1, Tumor necrosis factor receptor 1. a) Ca2+-PKC/CaM pathway,
  the vascular permeability is regulated in the tight junction by controlling the
  phosphorylation level of MLC by MLCK; b) cGMP-PKG pathway, the vascular permeability
  is regulated by AQP activity and tight junctions through controlling the phosphorylation
  level of MLC by MLCK; c) cAMP-PKA pathway, the vascular permeability is regulated
  by adjusting the activity of MLCP and AQP; d) PTK-MAPK pathway, the vascular permeability
  is affected by regulating the tight junctions by FAK; e) SGP pathway (small G protein),
  the vascular permeability is regulated by adjusting the tight junction, the adherens
  junctions and the vesicles by Rho and Rac GTPases and by CDC42
