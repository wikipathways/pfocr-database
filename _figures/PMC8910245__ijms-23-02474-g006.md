caption: Enrichment analysis performed with identified metabolites for endo- and exometabolome,
  each one represents a significant metabolic pathway (a) Glycerophospholipid metabolism
  (b) Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis (c) Linoleic acid metabolism
  (d) alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism (e) Fatty acid degradation (f) Biosynthesis
  of unsaturated fatty acids. In red, metabolites identified with the analysis was
  highlighted. C00157 is phosphatidylcholine or lecithin; C00350 is (3-Phosphatidyl)
  ethanolamine; C02990 is L-Palmitoylcarnitine and C03242 is Dihomo-gamma-linolenate.
