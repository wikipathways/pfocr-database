caption: Model for the miR-29 regulatory network in Zmpste24−/− progeroid mice. Nuclear
  lamina alterations of Zmpste24−/− cells induce a genomic instability situation that
  it is recognized by these cells as a chronic DNA damage, thereby activating the
  p53 signalling pathway. Additionally, nuclear lamina abnormalities disrupt the chromatin–lamina
  attachment patterns causing profound changes in chromatin structure. These alterations,
  putatively reinforced by the somatotroph axis and metabolic alterations present
  in these mice (dotted line), lead to an abnormal miR-29 activation and a subsequent
  repression of their target genes. These targets include several genes with pro-survival
  roles, like Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Cdc42, p85-α and Ppm1d/Wip1, whose downregulation leads
  to a decrease of cell proliferation and an increase of cell senescence and apoptosis,
  processes that finally result in the loss of tissue and organism homoeostasis. Moreover,
  Ppm1d repression diminishes the ratio of p53 dephosphorylation, which positively
  feedbacks the p53 loop, exacerbating the initial situation. Additionally, increased
  miR-29 levels may directly participate in further exacerbating DNA damage. Dotted
  lines indicate hypothetical links.
