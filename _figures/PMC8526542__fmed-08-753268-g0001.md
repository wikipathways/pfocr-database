caption: Pathway of HIF activation in hypoxia. Adapted from Lee et al. (). Under normoxic
  conditions, PHD enzymes hydroxylate proline residues in the HIFα subunit, in an
  oxygen-dependent manner. The hydroxylated residues are bound by VHL, which ubiquitinates
  HIFα allowing recognition and destruction of HIFα by the proteasome. Under hypoxic
  conditions, hydroxylation cannot occur and HIFα can instead translocate to the nucleus,
  bind HIFβ and other cofactors to activate transcription of target genes. HIF accumulation
  can also result from PHD inhibition by succinate or ROS, or by increased transcription
  and translation due to a ROS induced, ERK and PI3K mediated pathway. ERK, extracellular-signal
  related kinase; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins;
  PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; VHL, Von Hippel Lindau protein.
