caption: Central metabolic regulation of white-rot fungi in lignin degradation. During
  degradation of lignin and lignin-derived aromatics, production of isocitrate dehydrogenase
  (IDH) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (ODH) significantly increases, resulting
  in a shift in metabolic flux from a short-cut tricarboxylic acid (TCA)/glyoxylate
  bicycle system (magenta) to the classical TCA cycle (cyan), which activates the
  haem biosynthetic pathway by providing succinyl-CoA for effective production of
  haem enzymes. In contrast, excessive haem production directly inhibits citrate synthase
  (PcCS) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (PcGAPDH), thereby regulating
  haem synthesis, ATP synthesis, flux of the TCA cycle, and NADPH production. Through
  this metabolic regulation, effective production of haem enzymes, including lignin
  and manganese peroxidases and cytochrome P450s, takes place. This figure was generated

    During degradation of lignin and lignin-derived aromatics, production of isocitrate
