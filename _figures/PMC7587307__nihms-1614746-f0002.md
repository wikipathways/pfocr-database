caption: mtDNA is susceptible to damage from both exogenous and endogenous sources
  (A). Oxidative damage to mtDNA is generally repaired through a BER pathway. Mitochondria
  lack mismatch repair (MMR), ribonucleotide excision repair (RER), end-joining, or
  nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways [,]. For this reason, intrinsic replication
  errors not corrected by the Pol γ exonuclease, misincorporated ribonucleotides,
  and damage from radiation and environmental toxins are not repaired (B). Disease
  variants of the nuclear-encoded mtDNA replication machinery can also introduce damage
  (C). Damaged mtDNA has several fates (D). In the absence of repair pathways, mtDNA
  may accumulate point mutations and deletions. Furthermore, the pool of mtDNA may
  shrink as a result of damage or blocks to replication, yielding mtDNA depletion.
  Collectively, these outcomes may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of membrane
  potential (ΔΨ) [] (E). Dysfunctional mitochondria may be cleared through mitophagy
  (F). Combined with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and replication of undamaged
  mtDNA molecules, mitophagy helps to recover mitochondrial function. However, recovery
  may not be possible in cases of extreme depletion or damage.
