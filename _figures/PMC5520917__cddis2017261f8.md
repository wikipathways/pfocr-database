caption: Schematic diagram of OA-induced growth inhibition of colon cancer via reprogramming
  fatty acid metabolism under hypoxia. Under hypoxia, activated HIF1α promoted the
  transcription of fatty acid metabolism-related protein FABP, ADRP and FASN, and
  decreased the CPT1 expression, resulting in the enhanced fatty acid level and lipid
  accumulation. The high level of free fatty acid activated the canonical Wnt pathway
  and promoted the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, facilitating colon cancer growth.
  OA inhibited HIF1α-mediated reprogram of fatty acid metabolism and inactivated the
  Wnt pathway, leading to the suppression of cell growth and development of colon
  cancer
