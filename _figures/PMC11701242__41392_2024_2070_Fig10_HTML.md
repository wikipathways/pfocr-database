caption: Regulation of mTORC1 pathway by condensate. a Stress granules (SGs) formed
  in response to cellular stress incorporate components of the mTORC1 pathway, including
  TSC2, mTOR, S6K1/2, and RAPTOR. These SGs act as dynamic assemblies that sequester
  various proteins, altering cellular signaling under stress conditions. During cellular
  stress, DYRK3, a stress-responsive kinase, is inactivated and sequestered within
  SGs. This process sequesters mTOR away from the cytoplasm, preventing its assembly
  into mTORC1 complexes and thereby inhibiting downstream signaling pathways involved
  in RNA translation and protein synthesis. b mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of PGL-1/-3
  triggers stress-induced phase separation, forming PGL granules that resist autophagic
  degradation. c Spliceosomes are essential for processing RNA transcripts in eukaryotic
  cells by removing introns and joining exons in pre-mRNAs. They are composed of UsnRNPs,
  which are synthesized in a complex, tightly regulated process. mTOR acts as potential
  regulators of SMN complex condensates, linking them to RNA processing and cellular
  signaling
