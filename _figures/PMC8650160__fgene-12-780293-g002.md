caption: Repair of stalled replication forks via BIR. (A) Multiple DNA repair pathways
  compete to repair stalled replication forks during S/G2 phase of the cell cycle.
  (B) Once the cell enters M-phase, unrepaired forks become bound by the FANCD2/FANCI
  complex. It will attempt to repair the lesion again by a RAD52-dependent BIR-like
  pathway termed mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS). (C) If still unsuccessful, the cell
  with complete mitosis with each daughter cell inheriting under-replicated ssDNA
  that is protected by the 53BP1 protein during G1. (D) In the subsequent S-phase,
  the cell has one final attempt to repair under-replicated DNA via BIR. After this
  point, the cells must undergo apoptosis or pass on an incomplete genome.
