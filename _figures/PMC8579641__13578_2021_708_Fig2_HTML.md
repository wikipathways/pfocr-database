caption: NETs promote tumor growth and progression via many molecular pathways. HMGB1,
  released by NETs, can promote tumor growth by binding with TLR9 or RAGE to activate
  STAT3, p38, MAP and NF-κB. NE directly alters metabolism and upregulates mitochondrial
  biogenesis in colon cancer cells via the TLR4-PGC1-α pathway and thus promotes tumor
  growth. NETs awaken cancer cells and cleave laminin via NE and MMP-9 through the
  activity of integrin α3β1 and FAK/ERK/MLCK/YAP signaling. NET DNA drives pancreatic
  tumor growth by activating pancreatic stellate cells through interaction with RAGE.
  In our ongoing study, we have illustrated that NETs can promote tumor growth by
  BRF1 in GC cells
