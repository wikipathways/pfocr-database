caption: Epigenetic regulation of cell populations in TME. In TAMs, DNMT3A and DNMT3B
  suppress the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-a whereas HATs can rescue it by activating
  NF-κB pathway. Similarly, HDAC10 and EZH2 negatively regulate the expression of
  CCL2 by inhibiting SOCS3i and activating DNMT1, respectively. TGF-β1 signaling,
  the major force that drives CAF activation, is mediated by DNMTs, HDACs and several
  miRNAs. Of note, the m6A writer METTL3 can increase Col10A expression and promotes
  acquirement of myofibroblast characteristics. The cytotoxicity of NK cells is impaired
  due to EZH2-mediated CXCL10 decrease and miR-29 induced NKG2D deficiency, whereas
  DCs are activated by the m6A reader YTHDF1 and DNMTs. MDSC expansion and function
  rely on STAT3 activation, which can be suppressed by DNMTs or promoted by HDAC6/11.
  EZH2 and DNMTs inhibit MHC-I and CXCL9/10 on CD8+ T cells whereas METTL3/14 can
  activate IFN-γ signaling
