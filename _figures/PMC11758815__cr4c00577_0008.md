caption: Iron signaling. Iron(II) is taken up into the cell via transporters and iron(III)
  by means of CD44/hyaluronan- and TfR1/Tf-mediated endocytosis. Specific chaperones
  (PCBP1 and PCBP2) bind to cytosolic iron and contribute to the trafficking of iron
  to specific organelles. In lysosomes, iron promotes Fenton-type chemistry, producing
  ROS, lipid peroxidation, and triggering ferroptosis. Mitoferrin transfers cytosolic
  iron to the mitochondrial matrix. In mitochondria, iron is used for the formation
  of iron–sulfur clusters in the ETC. In the nucleus, iron is the catalyst of α-KG-dependent
  demethylases, controlling the epigenetic landscape and transcriptional programs.
  Under iron-deficient conditions/hypoxia, HIF-1α and HIF-1β are stable, form a heterodimer,
  bind to HRE, and function as a TF. In the presence of iron and under normoxia, HIF-1α
  is hydroxylated by PHD1–3 and FIH1, leading to proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α.
  Iron is stored via intracellular protein complex ferritin. The cargo receptor NCOA4
  mediates autophagic ferritin degradation, which contributes to the control of levels
  of available iron within the cell. Iron regulates the binding of IRP1 and IRP2 to
  IRE in UTRs. IRP1 can incorporate an iron–sulfur cluster, leading to an inactive
  form that cannot bind to IREs. In the presence of high iron, the IRE/IRP regulatory
  system promotes increase of ferritin and ferroportin and decrease of TfR1. Iron
  trafficking to the ER requires ERMES, directly linking the ER with the mitochondria
  for iron exchange. Iron is exported outside the cell via ferroportin, a mechanism
  that can be blocked by the hormone hepcidin. The BMP/SMAD pathway regulates hepcidin
  expression in an iron-dependent manner. Lipocalin-2 binds to siderophore 2,5-DHBA,
  reducing free iron levels. Prominin2 can promote the formation of ferritin-containing
  MVBs and exosomes, which can export cellular iron. See Abbreviations. Figure generated
