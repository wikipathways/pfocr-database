caption: 'CD8+ T cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  (a) Response to mRNA vaccine: The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine consists of an LNP-encapsulated
  mRNA strand that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, which elicits systemic
  immune responses upon injection. The vaccine-elicited immune response begins with
  the endocytosis of the LNP and release and processing of the mRNA intracellularly,
  which is then processed into small peptide fragments. The peptide fragments act
  as an endogenous antigen and are presented via the MHC class I molecule. The peptide-MHC
  I complexes are recognized by the TCRs of the CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells become
  activated upon the recognition of antigen, followed by differentiation into spike-specific
  memory CD8+ T cells. (b) Two response pathways to infection: (i) Perforin-mediated
  pathway: Memory CD8+ T cells recognize the infected cell and release effector molecules,
  such as PFN, GzmB, IFN-γ and TNF. PFN forms pores on the plasma membrane of the
  target cell, allowing GzmB to enter the cytosol leading to cell apoptosis via signalling
  cascades. (ii) Fas-mediated pathway: Apoptosis of target cells can also be initiated
  via the interaction of the Fas receptor on its surface and FasL on CD8+ T cells.
