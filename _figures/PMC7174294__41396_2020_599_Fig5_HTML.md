caption: The perchlorate reduction pathway (red) accumulates chlorate, which can react
  with reductants and generate reactive chlorine species (gray) or be consumed by
  the chlorate reduction pathway (orange). We did not find evidence for the release
  of chlorite and oxygen by the perchlorate and chlorate reduction pathways, though
  both chemicals can react with any reductants in the periplasm. Perchlorate and chlorate
  reduction remove the products of atmospheric oxidation of chlorine (dashed yellow).
  Co-metabolic or inadvertent enzyme activities are not shown.
