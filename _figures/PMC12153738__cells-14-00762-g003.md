caption: Progranulin (PGRN) in vascular pathophysiology. PGRN regulates critical cellular
  constituents involved in vascular health and disease, including vascular smooth
  muscle cells, endothelial cells, platelets, macrophages, and calcific aortic valve
  cells. The figure illustrates that PGRN interacts with multiple receptors, notably
  SORT1 and EphA2, initiating diverse downstream signaling cascades. In endothelial
  cells, PGRN activates the Akt/eNOS/NO pathway, which promotes vasodilation and contributes
  to blood pressure regulation. Concurrently, PGRN modulates inflammatory responses
  by attenuating the expression of adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  including VCAM-1, ICAM-1, TNF-α, and MCP-1, primarily through the inhibition of
  the NF-κB pathway
