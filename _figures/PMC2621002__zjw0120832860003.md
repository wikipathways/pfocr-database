caption: An enlarged section of the ubiquitin-proteasome system canonical pathway
  highlighting proteasome subunits and their reported IFNγ-induced exchange in formation
  of the “immunoproteasome” (, ). The gray-shaded subunits were identified in macrophage
  DRMs. PSM, proteasome subunit; THIMET, thimet oligopeptidase 1; TAP, transporter
  1 ATP-binding cassette (TAP1 and TAP2); IFNG, interferon-γ; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  MHC, major histocompatibility complex. The proteasome subunits with the asterisks
  represent components observed in more than one biological sample, and the double
  lined shapes represent a group of proteins/protein complex.
