caption: Intercellular and intracellular signaling pathways converging on HSF1At the
  organismal level, HSF1 is subject to cell non-autonomous regulation by neuronal
  signaling (serotonin), insulin/IGF-1 signaling, germline stem cell (GSC) signaling
  and transcellular chaperone signaling. Within the cell, HSF1’s activity is regulated
  by signal pathways that sense nutrients and control cell proliferation. The three
  major metabolic sensors, AMPK, mTORC1 and SIRT1 control HSF1’s activity directly
  through post-translational modifications. AMPK also inhibits HSF1 indirectly through
  PGC-1α. mTORC1 activates translation, and the nascent polypeptides and newly synthesized
  proteins titrate chaperones from HSF1, leading to de-repression of HSF1. HSF1 also
  influence metabolism by activating expression of PGC-1α, promoting protein synthesis
  through co-translational folding, and maintaining cellular levels of NAD+ via the
  NAD+ salvage pathway (indicated by the red arrows). HSF1 is also regulated by key
  components of the RAS/MAPK and RAS/PI3K pathways including MEK, ERK and GSK3β through
  phosphorylation. The pocket protein Rb, an important cell cycle regulator, may also
  influence HSF1 activity considering it is a repressor of E2F/DP that serves as a
  co-activator of HSF1 in C. elegans larval development.
