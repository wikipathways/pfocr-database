caption: (1) The purines ATP and adenosine ligate to their receptors P2X7 and A2AR,
  respectively, which act through PKA/PKC signaling and thereby activate IKK. IKK
  aids to cleave and translocate NF‐κB into the nucleus and induce inflammatory gene
  expression and cytokine release. A2AR additionally potentiates the expression of
  the complement component C3 and the opsonin C1q. Neuroprotective effects were observed
  when A2AR and P2X7R were blocked using the selective inhibitors SCH58261 and A438079,
  respectively. (2) Intravitreal administration of polySia avDP20 compensates for
  desialylated neurons by binding to its receptor SIGLEC‐11 and inhibiting neurotoxic
  inflammation through its ITIM domain. During inflammation, desialylated neurons
  activate CR3 associated ITAM and thereby trigger excessive release of ROS via NOX2.
  (3) The IFN‐β pathway involves STAT1‐ and STAT2‐induced SOCS1/SOCS3 release which
  reduces cytokine expression through a negative feedback and inhibits IL‐6 signaling.
  (4) Neutralizing antibodies such as infliximab aid to neutralize cytosolic TNF‐α.
  (5) TSPO ligands such as XBD173 stimulate the production of neurosteroids which
  limit the release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines. (6) Minocycline is a potent inhibitor
  of NF‐κB signaling.
