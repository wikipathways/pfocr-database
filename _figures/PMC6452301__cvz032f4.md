caption: Interplay of well-known germline and somatic mutations in atherogenesis.
  In the liver, cholesterol biosynthesis begins with acetyl-CoA, and intracellular
  cholesterol levels are regulated with assistance the SREBP2 pathway. Statins interfere
  with cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, leading to a drop in
  intracellular cholesterol levels, synthesis of more LDL receptors, and increased
  uptake of LDL cholesterol from the circulation. PCSK9 molecules help regulate the
  number of LDL receptors on the cell surface by aiding in their uptake from the cell
  membrane and transport to the lysosome for degradation. Evolocumab and alirocumab
  inhibit the activity of PCSK9, allowing more LDLR-mediated uptake of serum cholesterol.
  Sortilin expression, mediated by enhancers at the chromosome 1p13 locus, promotes
  release of mature VLDL particles into the circulation, PCSK9 secretion, and macrophage
  lipid accumulation leading to foam cell formation. In the circulation, various forms
  of lipoproteins combined with lipid molecules transport their contents throughout
  the body. APOA5 and APOC3 on VLDL particles participate in triglyceride metabolism
  and inhibit lipoprotein lipase (LPL), respectively. ANGPTL3 also inhibits LPL, leading
  to increased circulating levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, which are deposited
  in the endothelium of the vasculature. In the bone marrow, somatic mutations in
  TET2 lead to hyperproliferative advantage for a subset of haematopoietic pluripotent
  stem cells (HPSCs), leading to clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential
  (CHIP). The clonal monocytes that result from further replication produce an abundance
  of IL-1 beta, which promotes further inflammatory cascades and is in part inhibited
  by canakinumab. These macrophages adhere to the lipid-rich endothelium and traverse
  it. Within the vessel wall, mitochondrial dysfunction and generation of ROS leads
  to oxidation of LDL, generation of more inflammatory cytokines, and further damage
  to surrounding cells. Macrophages consume this oxidized LDL to become foam cells.
  Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferate, damaged cells apoptose, and the
  atheroma continues to grow.
