caption: Candidate Genes (Numbered Octagons) Generated by MORPH for the Carotenoid
  Biosynthetic Pathway (Starting from Phytoene).The MEP pathway generates substrates
  for GGPPS (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase), which serves as a metabolic hub
  to feed metabolites to several pathways, including the carotenoid pathway. For simplicity,
  CCD1 is shown at the pathway end, but the enzyme is known to degrade multiple carotenoid
  substrates (). Input genes for MORPH analysis included phytoene synthase (PSY),
  phytoene desaturase (PDS), zeta-carotene isomerase (Z-ISO), zeta-carotene desaturase
  (ZDS), carotenoid isomerase (CrtISO), lycopene epsilon cyclase (LCYE), lycopene
  beta cyclase (LCYB), beta-carotene hydroxylase 1 and 2 (HYD 1 and 2), cytochrome
  P450 hydroxylase 97A (CYP97A), cytochrome P450 hydroxylase 97C (CYP97C), violaxanthin
  de-epoxidase (VDE), and zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP).
