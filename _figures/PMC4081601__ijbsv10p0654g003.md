caption: Proposed mechanisms of anticancer activity of digoxin. Digoxin is a phytoestrogen
  which inhibits AR signaling pathway by preventing AR binding to AR-responsive element
  (ARE), leading to decrease in AR target genes such as PSA in prostate cancer cells.
  Digoxin is also known to inhibit HIF-1α synthesis, thereby reducing HIF-1α binding
  to its cognate element, hypoxia-responsive element (HRE), and suppressing the expression
  of HIF-1α target genes such as VEGF in cancer cells. Binding of cardiac glycosides
  to Na+/K+-ATPase is known to activate Src, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, which
  leads to an accumulation of p21/CIP1 and induction of cell cycle arrest in cancer
  cells.
