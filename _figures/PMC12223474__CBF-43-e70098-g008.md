caption: The impact of increased intracellular zinc on signaling pathways in T cells.
  Schematic view of the effects of zinc on IL‐2 related pathways. The inhibitory effect
  of zinc on pNFAT is represented by the red bar. Solid‐lined arrows indicate an activating
  impact. Dotted arrows indicate translocation of calcium or signaling molecules within
  the cell. The curved arrow indicates dephosphorylation of pNFAT. Upward arrow indicates
  an increased intracellular concentration of Zn2+, with a concurrent decrease in
  IL‐2 production, indicated by the downward arrow. The question mark indicates a
  possible additional signaling molecule which would be affected by zinc
