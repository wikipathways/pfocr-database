caption: Schematic representation for FtSH4 control of leaf senescence through the
  WRKY-regulated  pathway. Loss of function of FtSH4 induces the high level of expression
  of WRKY genes through the increase in  in an unknown way. Then, the WRKY proteins,
  especially WRKY75, bind to the SID2 promoter and result in elevated  biosynthesis.
  Finally, the high level of  and activated  signaling promote cell death, autophagy,
  and senescence of plant cells. Meanwhile,  have a direct function in regulating
  plant autophagy and senescence.
