caption: General scheme illustrating the arachidonic acid pathway through which IL-1β
  regulates PGE2 production. Arachidonic acid is cleaved from phospholipid by phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2), followed by synthesis of endoperoxides (PGG2, PGH2) via COX-1 and COX-2.
  Activation of COX-2 by IL-1β increases intracellular PGE2 levels. This scheme emphasizes
  that islets differ importantly from other cell lines and tumor tissues, because
  they contain little to no mPGES-1 in mice and rats, and although detectable in humans,
  this protein is not increased by IL-1β, whereas COX-2 is. Therefore, COX-2, and
  not mPGES-1, in islets is the mechanism whereby IL-1β increases PGE2 production,
  which in turn inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion.
