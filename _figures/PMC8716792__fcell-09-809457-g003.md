caption: The p53 and Hippo pathways regulate ferroptosis. p53 promotes the expression
  of ALOX15 in a transcription-dependent manner to promote ferroptosis, and ALOX15
  can contribute to the development of AS. p53 regulates ferroptosis by inhibiting
  GSH through SLC7A11 and promoting GSH production through p21. In contrast, GSH can
  inhibit the development of AS. When the Hippo signaling pathway is opened, MST1/2
  phosphorylates MOB1 and LATS1/2 and increases the interaction between them. Phosphorylated
  YAP/TAZ by LATS1/2 is degraded in the cytoplasm with the assistance of SAV1. When
  the Hippo signaling pathway is closed, the level of YAP phosphorylation decreases
  and translocates into the nucleus where it binds to the transcription factor TEAD
  to produce ACSL4, which promotes intracellular lipid peroxidation. TFR1, which increases
  intracellular Fe2+ concentration, and NOX4 and NOX2, induce intracellular ROS production
  and development of ferroptosis.
