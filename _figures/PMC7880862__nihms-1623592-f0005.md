caption: Activated CD8+ T cells in the TME upregulate expression of CD69 and PD-1
  (left). PD-L1expressing tumor cells produce and release soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) and
  PD-L1 tethered to the TEX membrane (right). PD-L1+TEX preferentially bind to PD-1
  on CD8+ T cell, and this signal downregulates expression of phosphorylated zeta
  chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) thus interfering with the TCR activation.
  Downregulation of the TCR- associated zeta chain upon interaction with tumor cells
  or TEX has been previously reported []. This negative signaling induced by the PD-L1/PD-1
  interaction results in blocking downstream nuclear translocation of nuclear factor
  of activated T cells (NFAT) and consequently suppresses T cell activities. The role
  of PD-L1+TEX versus sPD-L1 in this pathway is not clear, but PD-L1 tethered to the
  TEX membrane might deliver stronger negative signals than sPD-L1.
