caption: Overview of the NF-κB pathway in young and aging hearts after stress or damage.
  Both P1, regenerative hearts, and P8, nonregenerative hearts, express NF-κB immediately
  after myocardial infraction (MI). Neonate P1 hearts trigger the signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, resulting in the expression of
  suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). SOCS3 inhibits the activity of NF-κB,
  stopping the inflammatory pathway prematurely and resulting in minimal scar formation.
  Aging hearts experience a prolonged NF-κB response leading to more fibrosis after
  damage. Created with BioRender.com and published with permission.
