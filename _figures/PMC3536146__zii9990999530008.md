caption: Pathway representation of canonical and Pyk2-mediated TLR9 signaling. Shown
  are signaling pathways based on known phosphorylation events of TLR9. A coloring
  scheme is used to illustrate phosphorylation events that were detected with the
  peptide array when analyzing lysates from bovine monocytes stimulated with CpG ODNs
  in the presence (B) and absence (A) of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection.
  Differential levels of phosphorylation relative to the medium-treated control (P
  < 0.1) are presented as green for increased phosphorylation, red for decreased phosphorylation,
  and blue for insignificant phosphorylation or peptide not present on array.
