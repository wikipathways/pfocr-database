caption: 'Schematic illustration of the role of activity-dependent Ca2+signaling in
  PACAP-mediated neuroprotection. Activation of PACAP receptors leads to activation
  of PKA via the classical G-protein-adenylate cyclase (AC)-cAMP: pathway (1). PKA
  activation causes an increase in synaptic strength and/or neuronal excitability
  leading to a strong increase in levels of action potential firing which in turn
  triggers intracellular Ca2+ influx, likely through synaptic receptors (e.g. NMDA
  receptors) or voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs): pathway (2). Activation of long-lasting
  neuroprotection by PACAP requires induction of gene expression mediated by the transcription
  factor CREB. CREB phosphorylation on serine-133 can be triggered directly by PKA
  in an AP firing-independent manner: pathway (3). However, this is insufficient to
  fully activate CREB-mediated gene expression. A key Ca2+/activity-dependent pathway
  involves CRTC1 nuclear translocation through activation of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase
  calcineurin: pathway (4). Blue arrows and molecules indicate AP firing activity-independent
  events, while red arrows and molecules highlight the events dependent on AP firing.
  The pharmacological and genetic inhibitors of the various pathways used in this
  study are shown in green.'
