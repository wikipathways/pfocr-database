caption: The proposed model for butyric acid–mediated inhibition of lipogenesis via
  LKB1-AMPK-Insig signaling pathway. Gut-derived metabolite butyric acid exerts beneficial
  effects on hepatocytes, enhancing LKB1 phosphorylation and elevating AMP-to-ATP
  ratio, which facilitates AMPK activation. Subsequently, interaction between AMPK
  and Insig is strengthened by butyric acid, resulting in phosphorylation of Insig
  at Thr222 and decline of proteasome-mediated degradation. The increased Insig restrains
  the processing and translocation of SREBP-1c and suppresses its transcriptional
  activity. The activation of AMPK by butyric acid also facilitates SREBP-1c phosphorylation
  at Ser372 and suppresses its proteolytic cleavage. These mechanisms by which butyric
  acid inhibits de novo lipogenesis in hepatocytes provide therapeutic potential for
  hepatic steatosis management. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
