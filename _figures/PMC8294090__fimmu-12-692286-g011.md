caption: Graphical summary of the effects and mechanisms of butorphanol on sepsis-induced
  ALI. Upon binding of LPS to TLR4, macrophages are activated and accumulated at the
  site of infection where they are polarized into the M1 (a pro-inflammatory) and
  M2 (an anti-inflammatory) phenotypes. However, butorphanol may mitigate sepsis-induced
  ALI by promoting macrophage transition from M1 to M2 phenotype secondary to the
  inhibition of NF-κB and MAPKs, and the TRIF-mediated IFN signaling pathway through
  κ receptors.
