caption: 'Structural changes capture multiple regulatory events in yeast responding
  to osmotic shockA schematic of the yeast HOG-MAPK pathway and its links to glycolytic
  and glycerol biosynthesis pathways. Proteins undergoing significant structural alterations
  upon osmotic shock are indicated with orange labels (|log2FC| >1, q-value < 0.05,
  two-sample t test with Storey method correction for multiple testing). The barcodes
  represent the changes in proteolytic fingerprints from N to C terminus. Each vertical
  bar represents a peptide that could be detected in samples subject to LiP. Peptides
  that changed in intensity between conditions are indicated by yellow (|log2FC| >1,
  q-value < 0.05), peptides detected by MS but unchanged between conditions are in
  gray, and peptides not detected by MS are in black. The structural models show changed
  LiP peptides (orange) mapped onto the 3D protein structures of yeast protein-metabolite
  complexes or evolutionary conserved holo-complex structures obtained by homology
  modeling; metabolites positioned in allosteric or active sites are indicated in
  green. For Hog1 and Gpd1, phosphorylation sites are indicated in blue on protein
  sequences. The allosteric regulator Fructose 2, 6-bisphosphate (F2,6bP), is depicted
  in red. The models shown are based on available structures: Pfk1 (PDB: 3o8o), Fba1
  (PDB: 3qm3), Ste20 (PDB: 4zlo), Hog1 (PDB: 5ci6), Tpi1 (PDB: 1nf0), Gpd1 (PDB: 6e9o),
  Gpp1 (PDB: 2qlt), Tdh2 (PDB: 3pym), Pgk1 (PDB: 1qpg), Gpm (PDB: 1qhf), Eno2 (PDB:
  1ebh), and Pyk2 (PDB: 1a3x).See also  and .'
