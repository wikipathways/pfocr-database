caption: Model of the mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response (MT-UPR). Misregulation
  of import of nuclearly encoded mitochondrial proteins, misregulation of mitochondrial
  gene expression or damage of mtDNA or mitochondrially localized proteins can cause
  the accumulation of misfolded or damaged proteins leading to mitochondrial stress.
  The MT-UPR pathway is thought to restore protein folding homeostasis in MT. This
  pathway has been described in mammalian cells and in C. elegans. Proteins shown
  in gray are shared between the two models. Proteins in yellow are unique to the
  mammalian model and proteins in green have only been described in C. elegans.
