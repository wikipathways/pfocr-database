caption: Summary of the underlying mechanism of dapagliflozin in alleviating nonalcoholic
  steatohepatitis. In brief, dapagliflozin treatment alleviates steatosis and reduces
  fat accumulation by inhibiting the FXR/SHP/LXRα/SREBP-1c pathway and reducing ChREBP1
  expression in the liver of db/db mice. In addition, dapagliflozin treatment inhibits
  NF-κB pathway activation and further lowers inflammatory response via reducing the
  activity of the MAPK pathway and JAK/STAT3 pathway. Importantly, dapagliflozin restores
  the process of fibrosis and further inhibits fibrosis by downregulating the expression
  of PAI-1, TIMP-1, and MMP9 in the liver of db/db mice. Orange arrows represent pathological
  states; green arrows represent dapagliflozin treatment status; FXR = farnesoid X
  receptor; SHP = small heterodimer partner; LXRα = liver X receptor α; SREBP-1c =
  sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor; FAS = fatty acid synthase;
  ACC = acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ChREBP1 = carbohydrate responsive element binding
  protein; DNL = de novo lipogenesis; NF-κB = nuclear factor kappa B; MAPK = mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; JAK = Janus-activated kinase; STAT3 = signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3; PAI-1 = plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; TIMP-1 = tissue inhibitor
  of metalloproteinase-1; MMP9 = matrix metalloproteinase-9.
