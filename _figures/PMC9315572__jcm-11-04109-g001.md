caption: 'NSAIDs deliver effective analgesia through inhibition of the cyclooxygenase
  enzyme family, which pushes inflammation down the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, which
  ultimately results in upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that can
  digest the stroma and cause melt formation. Steroids inhibit phospholipase A2, the
  enzyme above both COX and 5-lipoxygenase in the inflammation cascade. From a mechanistic
  perspective, steroid use may prevent melting that occasionally occurs with topical
  NSAID use. 5-HPETE: arachidonic acid 5-hydroperoxide; MMP: matrix metalloproteinase;
  NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; PG: prostaglandin.'
