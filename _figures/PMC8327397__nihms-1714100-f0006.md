caption: Metabolic pathways for ceramide synthesis are composed of the de novo pathway,
  the sMase pathway, and the salvage pathway. Red and blue colors represent the genes
  or the metabolites upregulated and downregulated following TCDF treatment compared
  with the vehicle group. Black indicates no significant change or was not measured
  in this study. Cer, Ceramide; PE-Cer, Ceramide phosphoethanolamines; SPT, Serine
  Palmitoyltransferase; CerS, ceramide synthases; Des, dihydroceramide desaturases;
  CerK, ceramide kinase; N-SMase, Neutral Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase; A-SMase,
  acid Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase; Sms, Spermine synthase; CDase, neutral ceramidase;
  A-CDase, acid ceramidase; GCS, glucosylceramide synthase. Created with BioRender.com.
