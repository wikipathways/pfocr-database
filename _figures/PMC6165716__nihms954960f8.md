caption: Schematic showing PDK4 as a checkpoint in NF-κB/TNF-mediated apoptosis. Under
  normal cellular conditions, PDK4 interacts with NF-κB/p65 and sequesters p65 in
  the cytoplasm. Mitochondria respiration and ROS production remain normal. TNF treatment
  can activate NF-κB (p50/p65 complex) signaling to promote the induction of pro-survival
  genes. Knockdown of PDK4 disrupts mitochondria respiration and generates excessive
  ROS; the latter facilitates PDK4 and p65 protein dissociation, and releases p65
  to accelerate its nuclear translocation. Excessive ROS may also deplete cellular
  GSH and activate JNK. In this scenario, in the nucleus of PDK4-deficient cells,
  pro-survival genes are less/not responsive to p65 transactivation, whereas TNF is
  activated which in turn induces caspase-8 and the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. In
  addition, ROS leads to activation of caspase-9 and the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.
  Collectively, we propose that increased ROS, decreased GSH, and sustained JNK activation
  shift the pro-survival function NF-κB toward facilitating TNF-mediated apoptosis.
