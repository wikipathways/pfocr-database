caption: Details of CBX members regulate Wnt/β-catenin, Hippo, MARK signalling pathways
  in tumours and mechanism. (A) CBX1 and CBX3, respectively, play a transcriptional
  activation role in HCC and CRC (the specific mechanism of action is not yet clear),
  could upregulate the expression of downstream target genes to promote the activation
  of Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway and play a tumour promotion role. However, it
  is not clear CBX2/4/8 through what transcriptional regulatory mechanism overactivates
  the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in GC/LUAD/LSCC cells to play the role of carcinogenic
  factors. CBX7 could act as a methylation reader to identify H3K27me3 on the promoter
  of downstream target genes, silence the expression of downstream target genes through
  classical PRC1-dependent transcriptional pathway, inhibiting the activation of Wnt/β-catenin
  signalling pathway, and act as a cancer suppressor. However, although CBX7 also
  exists as a tumour suppressor in BC cells, it exerts transcriptional activation
  independently of the classical PRC1-dependent pathway, upregulates the expression
  of downstream target genes, and inhibits the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signalling
  pathway. (B) CBX2 in HCC might be independent of the classical PRC1-dependent pathway,
  playing a role in transcriptional activation (the specific mechanism is not clear),
  upregulating the expression of downstream target genes, inhibiting the activation
  of Hippo signalling pathway, and playing a role in tumour promotion. However, the
  transcriptional regulatory mechanism of oncogenic factor CBX4 in inhibiting Hippo
  signalling pathway activation in LUAD cells in the context of KrasG12D mutation
  remains unclear. In GBM, CBX7 could inhibit the expression of downstream target
  genes through classical PRC1-dependent pathway transcription, promote the activation
  of tumour suppression-related Hippo signalling pathway, inhibit the activation of
  EMT-related SAPK/JNK signalling pathway, and play a role as a cancer suppressor,
  which is conducive to patients' prognosis. CBX2 could inhibit the expression of
  downstream target genes through classical PRC1-dependent pathway transcription,
  promote the activation of MAPK signalling pathway in AML, and play a role as a carcinogenic
  factor. Although CBX8 could recognize H3K27me3 in HCC cells, it transcriptionally
  activating the expression of downstream target genes through other mechanisms independent
  of the classical PRC1-dependent pathway, promoting the activation of MAPK signalling
  pathway, and playing a role as a carcinogenic factor. The transcriptional regulation
  mechanism of oncogenic factor CBX7 in promoting the activation of MAPK signalling
  pathway in OC cells remains unclear. CBX7 could silence the expression of downstream
  target genes through classical PRC1-dependent transcriptional pathway, inhibit the
  activation of MAPK signalling pathway in UBC, and act as a tumour-suppressive factor.
  However, it is not clear whether the transcriptional regulation mechanism of CBX7
  is involved in the regulation of ERK/MAPK signalling pathway activation in NSCLC
  cells
