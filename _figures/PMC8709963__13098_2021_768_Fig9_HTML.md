caption: 'Presumed mechanism by which inulin alleviated glucose and lipid metabolism
  disorders in gestational diabetes mellitus mice. The mechanism underlying improvement
  of glucose and lipid metabolism by inulin was to activate glucose transport through
  the translocation of GLUT4 which was mediated by insulin signaling pathway repairment
  due to decreased expression of RETN and enhanced phosphorylation of IRS and Akt
  in GDM mice. Finally, this signal leads to changes in downstream metabolic functions.
