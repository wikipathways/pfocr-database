caption: Pathview analysis of the pathways in cancer signaling pathway. Every box
  is divided into six parts on average, and each part represents the relative gene
  expression level of F. nucleatum-infected osteoblasts at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28
  days from left to right. The red color indicates that the expression levels are
  upregulated after F. nucleatum stimulation. The green color indicates that the levels
  are downregulated after F. nucleatum stimulation. The white color indicates that
  the gene expression levels are not influenced by F. nucleatum stimulation. The gene
  expression levels are calculated by the log fold change in the F. nucleatum infected
  group (MOI = 50) relative to the control group at each time point.
