caption: AEA and 2-AG are synthesized from phospholipids in the postsynaptic cell.
  The most commonly accepted route for AEA synthesis involves its direct formation
  from N-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) via catalysis by a specific
  phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). Alternatively, recent evidence points to AEA formation
  via the ABHD4/GDE1 pathway and also through the PLC pathway via either PTPN22 or
  SHIP1 activity. Because the specific enzymes for AEA generation remain unclear no
  specific pathway is represented in this figure. 2-AG derives primarily from the
  hydrolytic metabolism of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) via the sn-1-selective DAG lipases
  DAGLα and DAGLβ. Once released into the synaptic cleft AEA and 2-AG exert signaling
  effects through CB1 and other receptors including CB2 and GPR55 (). CB1 receptors
  are expressed on presynaptic terminals, though the synaptic positions of CB2 and
  GPR55 in the CNS have not been confirmed. AEA also functions as a potent agonist
  at transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1), though unlike GPCRs
  these receptors contain an intracellular lipid binding site. Termination of extracellular
  eCB signaling is initiated by cellular reuptake, and once inside the cell eCBs are
  shuttled via chaperone mechanisms (including fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs;
  ()) to specific enzymes for hydrolytic cleavage. Degradation of 2-AG is attributed
  primarily to presynaptic monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) that cleaves 2-AG into arachidonic
  acid (AA) and glycerol. Degradation of AEA occurs in postsynaptic cells through
  fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) that cleaves AEA into AA and ethanolamine. Evidence
  suggests that FAAH can also conjugate AA and various neurotransmitters into n-arachidonoyl
  moieties such as n-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA) () that have potent bioactivity
  at TRPV1 and CB1 receptors ().
