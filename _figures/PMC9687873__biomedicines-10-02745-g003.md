caption: ACC pre-LTP and post-LTP. Two forms of LTP (pre and post) can be observed
  in the ACC. Presynaptic enhancement of vesicle formation, pool size, and neurotransmitter
  release probability lead to more readily available agonists of ionotropic glutamate
  receptors in the synaptic cleft. This can quickly saturate postsynaptic receptors
  leading to increased calcium influx through the postsynaptic membrane. GluK1-containing
  kainate receptors (KARs) and ligand-voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs) allow
  for the influx of Ca2+, which activates calmodulin (CaM). Activation of adenylyl
  cyclase 1 (AC1) by CaM leads to cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA), which enhances
  vesicle fusion. Regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis protein 1 (RIM1) together
  with SCRAPPER, a synapse-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase can upregulate synaptic vesicle
  release. In addition, activity of the HCN channel with cAMP is believed to modulate
  the spontaneous release of neurotransmitters. Post-LTP requires the activation of
  postsynaptic NMDARs, which through the influx of Ca2+ can activate the CaMKIV, which
  activates the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Once activated by cAMP,
  PKA upregulates the insertion of Ca2+ permeable AMPARs to the membrane surface and
  phosphorylates CREB leading to increased protein synthesis of PKMζ, fragile x mental
  retardation protein (FMRP), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF interacts
  with presynaptic and postsynaptic TrkB receptors and contributes to LTP via the
  AC1-PKA pathway. De novo synthesis of proteins contributes to increased survival,
  synaptic plasticity, and neuronal growth, which can persist over a long period of
  time. As with the importance of PKA, activation of AC1 is also critical for the
  maintenance of post-LTP.
