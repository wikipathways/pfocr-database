caption: Schematic overview of the central carbon metabolism of C. glutamicum. The
  main aspects of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the
  TCA cycle, and anaplerosis are shown. Shaded boxes represent relevant enzymes. Carboxylation
  as well as decarboxylation steps are given. ABCRib, ATP-binding cassette transporter
  for ribose; AK, acetate kinase; CA, carbonic anhydrase; GntP, gluconate permease;
  GPDH, glucose-6P dehydrogenase; ICD, isocitrate dehydrogenase; ICL, isocitrate lyase;
  KGDH, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex; MS, malate synthase; PCx, pyruvate
  carboxylase; PDHC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PEPCk, PEP carboxykinase; PEPCx,
  PEP carboxylase; PGDH, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; PGI, phosphoglucose isomerase;
  PK, pyruvate kinase; PQO, pyruvate:quinone oxidoreductase; PTA, phosphotransacetylase;
  PTSGlc, permease of phosphotransferase system for glucose; PTSFru, permease of phosphotransferase
  system for fructose.
