caption: 'Diagrammatic representation of intracellular pathways of receptor-mediated
  endocytosis and trafficking: The ligand binding to specific cell surface receptor
  leads to a selective recruitment of ligand-receptor complexes into clathrin-coated
  pits. The coated pit represents a small area of the plasma membrane, which invaginates
  and pinch-off into vesicle in the cytosol. Coated pits and vesicles also trigger
  the recruitment of adapter proteins for example AP-2 and other interacting protein
  molecules. The caveolin pathway also internalizes the cargo complex, independent
  of clathrin-coated pits and the surface of caveolae is coated by caveolin. Both
  clathrin- and caveolin-dependent routes require dynamin protein to achieve the fission
  of the membrane invaginations and vesicle internalization. The ligand-receptor complexes
  within the cargo entering via the clathrin and caveolin pathways are usually directed
  to early endosomes. From the endosomes, the receptors and ligands are sorted to
  various subcellular locations, where the internalized molecules are either routed
  to degradative compartments such as the late endosomes, and/or lysosomes, or recycled
  to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. The recycled molecules can participate
  in several rounds of endocytosis. Alternatively, the internalized cargo molecules
  may be sequestered in endosomes for a longer period of time and continue to spark
  signaling events. Some early and late endosomes also contain membrane structures
  in the lumen, which are referred to as multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs). The endosome
  and lysosome system can also transmit and receive cargo from trans-Golgi network
  (TGN) involving vesicular intermediate carriers. The key proteins involved in the
  trafficking of molecules at different locations have been indicated such as AP-1,
  AP-1A, AP-1B, AP-2, AP-4, Dab-1, Esp15, GGA, PACS-1, and TIP.'
