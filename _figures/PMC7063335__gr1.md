caption: 'Schematic diagrams representing the main hypotheses for the evolution of
  metabolic pathways. In the retrograde hypothesis (a), metabolic pathways are supposed
  to originate with sequential gene duplications starting from gene catalyzing the
  last step of current pathways. Depletion of the compounds present in the primordial
  soup may have originated a selection pressure leading to the survival and reproduction
  of the primordial cells able to produce the depleted compounds; this process could
  have then been repeated sequentially, in a backward direction, until the establishment
  of contemporary pathways. In Granick''s hypothesis (b), pathways would have been
  assembled in a forward direction, from simple precursors to more complex products.
  Under this model, the older genes across evolutionary timescale would be represented
  by those catalyzing the earlier steps in contemporary pathways. In our diagram,
  the decoration and alkylating steps are examples of reactions adding complexity
  to the initial precursor and to the pathway intermediates. In the patchwork hypothesis
  (c), ancestral genes encoding promiscuous enzymes could have expanded the metabolic
  capabilities of primordial cells through gene duplication and subsequent divergence.
  A possible fate for an event of gene duplication is subfunctionalization (c), in
  which the catalytic activities of the ancestral gene are divided among the paralogs.
  In our example, following divergence of the duplicated genes, one of the ancestral
  reactions is taken on by one of the paralogs. In the shell hypothesis (d), evolution
  of metabolism can be traced back to the consecutive additions of distinct metabolic
  pathways. The core central pathway (reductive TCA, fatty acids biosynthesis), i.e.,
  shell A, predated the addition of nitrogen metabolism in shell B; sulphur and cofactor
  metabolism were later added as shell C. As more pathways are added, the inner shells
  remain nested in the network as remnants of the earliest metabolisms. Abbreviations:
