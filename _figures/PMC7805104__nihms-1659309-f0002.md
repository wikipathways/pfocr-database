caption: Sphingomyelinase-mediated tissue factor (TF) decryption. The presence of
  a high molar concentration of sphingomyelin (SM) in the outer leaflet of the plasma
  membrane inhibits TF pro-coagulant activity on the cell surface, thus maintaining
  TF in an encrypted state in resting cells. Cell activation, such as adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP)-induced signalling pathway via P2×7 receptor (P2×7R) or the inflammatory mediators-induced
  signalling pathways would lead to the translocation of acid-sphingomyelinase (ASM)
  from intracellular compartments to the outer leaflet. ASM hydrolyzes SM in the outer
  leaflet, which removes the SM’s inhibitory effect on TF and thus resulting in increased
  TF pro-coagulant activity.
