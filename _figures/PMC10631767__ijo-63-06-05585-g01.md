caption: Associations between CCA, TAMs and TANs. CCA can produce IL-6 and TGF-β to
  activate TAMs. In response, TAMs release IL-10 to activate the STAT3 pathway and
  enhance the migration and invasion of the tumor cells. Moreover, activated TAMs
  contribute to tumor angiogenesis by producing VEGF-A, angiopoietin, IL-8, COX-2
  and iNOS. CCA cells express certain Wnt ligands, which assemble and activate TAMs.
  These TAMs, in turn, secrete Wnt, thereby stimulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  ultimately resulting in increased tumor cell proliferation. TANs release a variety
  of growth factors, enzymes and cytokines that collectively enhance tumor growth.
  CCA express ENA-78 to recruit TANs. Furthermore, the interaction between TANs and
  TAMs induces the production of OSM by TANs and IL-11 by TAMs, which leads to increased
  tumor cell proliferation and invasion via STAT3 pathway. CCA, cholangiocarcinoma;
  TAMs, tumor-associated macrophages; TANs, tumor-associated neutrophils; VEGF, vascular
  endothelial growth factor; COX-2, cyclooxygenase 2; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide
  synthase; ENA-78, epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating peptide-78; OSM, oncostatin
