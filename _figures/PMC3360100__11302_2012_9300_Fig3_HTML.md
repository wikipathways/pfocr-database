caption: Schematic illustration of examples of signal transduction pathways in astroglial
  cells following P2Y1R activation. Stimulation of P2Y1Rs leads to the activation
  of phospholipases A2 and C (PLA2, C) and protein kinase C (PKC), as well as an increase
  in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). The activation of P2Y1Rs result in the induction
  of second messenger and enzyme cascades, e.g. activation of the mitogen activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway proteins (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK), and PI3K/Akt activation. P2Y1R-mediated signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling may play a role in astrocyte proliferation and
  reactive astrogliosis. P2Y1R activation appeared to be involved in the activation
  of caspase (Casp) cascades and the release of arachidonic acid and increase in prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE2) levels. In addition, P2Y1R activation induces the activity of transcription
  factors such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), cyclic element-binding protein (CREB)
  and activator protein (AP-1) (which up regulate the expression of proinflammatory
  genes, e.g. c-Fos, c-Jun, c-Myc). Interaction between adenosine A1 and P2Y1Rs may
  alter the nucleotide signalling cascades. Modulation of astrocytic P2Y1Rs by the
  C-terminal domain of the gap junction protein connexin-43 (Cx43) appears to be involved
  in release of ATP and glutamate. The present data suggest that astroglial P2Y1R
  stimulation is associated with neurological disorders leading to neuroinflammation,
  and apoptosis. The inset summarises examples of P2Y1R-mediated effects in astrocytes
