caption: 'Elevation of omega fatty acid oxidation pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle
  in flies fed with high-fat diet: omega fatty acid oxidation is an alternative pathway
  for fatty acid oxidation, which is increased in flies on HFD while there is no upregulation
  of more common beta fatty acid oxidation pathway.'
