caption: Integrated pathway analysis of metabolome and transcriptome data obtained
  under different light qualities. The biosynthetic pathways and expression profiles
  of genes involved in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid skeletons
  are displayed. Fold changes (e.g., G510 vs. FL) in expression levels of genes encoding
  enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway are shown. ACC, acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; C4H, cinnamate 4‐hydroxylase; 4CL, 4‐hydroxycinnamoyl CoA ligase; F3′H,
  flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; FSII, flavone synthase II; FLS, flavonol synthase; F3GlcT,
  UGT78D2; C3H, Coumarate-3-hydroxylase; HQT, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA quinate transferase;
  and FL, white fluorescent light.
