caption: Figure 1. Small RNA pathways. MiRNAs are processed from long structured primary
  transcripts by the Drosha (DRSH-1) complex into precursor miRNAs, which undergo
  Dicer (DCR-1) processing to produce mature ~22 nt miRNAs. Mature miRNAs use imperfect
  complementarity to guide Argonaute-containing (ALG-1 or ALG-2) miRISC to inhibit
  target mRNA expression. In the exo-RNAi pathway, long exogenous dsRNAs are recognized
  by RDE-4 and cleaved by the Dicer complex into primary exo-siRNAs, which recruit
  the Argonaute RDE-1 and other RISC factors to bind complementary sequences in target
  mRNAs. Amplification of primary siRNAs can generate secondary exo-siRNAs by the
  RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) RRF-1, which uses the previously targeted mRNA
  as a template. The newly synthesized siRNAs contain 5′ triphosphates and form RISC
  complexes with the Secondary Argonautes (SAGOs) or the Argonaute CSR-1. In the endo-RNAi
  pathway, endogenous dsRNAs derived from hairpin RNAs or sense-antisense dsRNAs undergo
  Dicer processing to form some types of primary endo-siRNAs that are bound by Argonautes,
  such as ERGO-1. Targeted mRNAs serve as templates for the generation of secondary
  exo-siRNAs by the RdRP RRF-3 and associated factors. In some cases, mRNAs are directly
  chosen by an unknown mechanism as templates for the synthesis of 26 nt endo-siRNAs
  by the RRF-3 complex. An additional phase involving RRF-1 results in 22 nt endo-siRNAs.
  In the germline, 22G-RNAs are produced by RRF-1/EGO-1 activity that is independent
  of the DCR-1/ERI-1 complex and are incorporated into Worm-specific Argonautes (WAGOs).
  The exo- and endo-siRNAs typically base-pair perfectly with target sites and can
  induce mRNA cleavage if they recruit catalytically active Argonaute proteins.
