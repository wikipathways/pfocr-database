caption: RLR Signaling pathway. RLR family contains of RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. RIG-I
  and MDA5 recognize viruses differentially. RIG-I recognizes SeV, VSV, RSV, NDV,
  EBV, and JEV, whereas MDA5 recognizes viruses of picornavirus family members. After
  virus infection, long viral dsRNA or short dsRNA activates MDA5 or RIG-I, respectively,
  and they undergo conformational change to obtain an open confirmation and their
  CARD domain interacts with CARD domain of IPS-1 localized in mitochondria and peroxisomes
  to start signaling. Mitochondrial IPS-1 signaling leads to activation of NF-κB and
  RF3/IRF7 resulting in the production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines,
  whereas peroxisomal IPS-1 activates IRF1- and IRF3-dependent signaling leading to
  interferon stimulatory genes (ISGs) expression. LGP2 is a positive regulator of
  RIG-I and MDA5. RIG-I signaling is also positively regulated by Trim25 and RIPLET,
  whereas it is negatively regulated by CYLD, USP4, and RNF125.
