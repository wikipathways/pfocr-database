caption: Fungal cell wall metabolites modulate our immune system. (A) Fungal β-glucan
  mediates trained immunity to inhibit canonical NLRP3 inflammasome (B) Host immune
  system-Candida auris interplay. The C. auris cell surface harbors mannoproteins
  with specific α-1,2-mannose-phosphate (M-α-1-phosphate) side chains. Macrophage
  mannose receptor (MMR) and complement receptor 3 (CR3) play a substantial role in
  the recognition of these specific mannoproteins and the subsequent induction of
  cytokines. (C)Aspergillus fumigatus galactosaminogalactan (GAG) promotes host immune
  protection. GAG present at the surface of the germinating conidia directly triggers
  activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome inside the immune cells. (D) Macrophage metabolism
  is rewired in response to Aspergillus fumigatus melanin. Fully mature particles
  of melanin at the surface of the conidia are probably removed during the swelling
  process, and this inhibits calcium/calmodulin (CaM) signaling in macrophages. Melanin
  modulation of calcium signaling induces the mTOR pathway, leading to activation
  of HIF-1α. HIF-1α participates in the transcriptional upregulation of a set of genes
  for immunometabolic responses. These include not only genes encoding enzymes involved
  in the glycolysis pathway but also those encoding some pro-inflammatory cytokines.
