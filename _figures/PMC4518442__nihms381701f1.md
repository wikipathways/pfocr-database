caption: 'Modulating effects of bioactive food components on niche signaling pathways
  and crosstalks among them in cancer stem cells. The self-renewal characteristic
  of stem cells is maintained by various niche signaling pathways including Wnt, Notch,
  and Hedgehog and modified by direct and/or indirect interactions among different
  signaling pathways in this regulation. A number of bioactive food components including
  genistein, sulforaphane, vitamin D, EGCG, curcumin, dietary cholesterol, and piperin
  are shown to inhibit the abnormally upregulated Wnt signaling pathway in cancer
  stem cells. Dotted lines indicate likely events without evidence yet. Arrows represent
  stimulation and lines with blunted ends indicate inhibition. Palmitic acid, cholesterol,
  and glycine shown inside the circle indicate the modification of ligands for the
  activation of the pathway. The left-side of ligands indicates the amino-terminal
  and the right-side, carboxyl terminal. SFN: sulforaphane, EGCG: (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate,
  pal: palmitic acid, gly: glycine, cho: cholesterol.'
