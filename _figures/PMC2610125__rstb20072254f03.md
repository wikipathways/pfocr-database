caption: A new model for neural induction in Xenopus laevis embryos. In this model
  Ca2+ plays a central role, by directly activating Ca2+ target genes such as xPRMT1b,
  which in turn control neural gene transcription either directly or via the activation
  of a Ca2+/calmodulin kinase type II. The Ca2+ signals may also inhibit the BMP signalling
  pathway by activating a calcineurin, which prevents the phosphorylation of Smads
  (see text for more details). The activation of the DHP-Ca2+ channels is performed
  by an as yet unidentified mechanism (indicated by the ‘?’) at the level of the binding
  of BMP by neural inducers.
