caption: A, acquisition of disulfide reducing power from extracellular Met. The redox-active
  S is designated in red font as S. In extracellular fluids, the reduced S is protected
  from oxidation as a thioether. The Met-cycle generates Hcy bearing this reduced
  S, and transsulfuration moves this reduced S to Cys; no other portion of Met is
  transferred to the Cys. The Cys can be used in de novo GSH biosynthesis, which puts
  the reduced S into a context that can be used for disulfide reduction reactions.
  The points of pathway inhibition by PPG and BSO are shown. Ancillary reactants and
  products are not shown. B, Roles of CBS and CSE in S-amino acid homeostasis and
  in H2S signaling. Row 1 shows the classical transsulfuraion reactions for shunting
  S from the Met-cycle into Cys. Row 2 shows the reactions that lead to H2S production
  for signaling. For the CBS reaction, Cys replaces Ser, so the reaction is Hcy +
  Cys → cystathionine + H2S. For the Cse reaction, cystine replaces cystathionine,
  so the reaction is cystine → thiocystine + pyruvate. In a subsequent step not shown,
  thiocystine can be reduced by TRP14, Trx1, or Grx to generate H2S + Cys.
