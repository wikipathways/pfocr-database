caption: PRRSV utilizes miRNAs to help itself escape the host innate immune response.
  RIG-I and MDA5 detect dsRNA and initiate the adaptor protein MAVS to trigger IRF3
  and NF-κB activations. TLR3, located at endosomes, senses dsRNA and transduces signals
  through TRIF, IRAK2, and TRAF6, leading to the activation of IRF3 and NF-κB. TLR7
  senses ssRNA and transduces signals through MyD88, IRAK4, IRAK1, IRAK2, and TRAF6,
  subsequently activating IRF7 and NF-κB. After transferring to the nucleus, IRFs
  and NF-κB will transactivate the promoters to induce IFN-I expressions. IFN-I binds
  to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 heterodimers, which transduce signals through recruiting JAK1
  and TYK2, and result in STAT1 and STAT2 activation and binding to IRF9, constituting
  the ISGF3 complex. The complex translocates into the nucleus and promotes ISGs gene
  expression. SOCS3, a JAKs kinase inhibitor, can directly bind JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2
  to inhibit their kinase activity and suppress IFN-mediated antiviral and anti-proliferative
  activities. κB-Ras2 binds directly to IκBα and inhibits IKK-dependent phosphorylation
  and subsequent degradation, thus inhibiting NF-κB signaling. HO-1 is an inducible
  enzyme and plays a critical role in immunomodulatory functions. NFIA and NFIB can
  induce interferon-β production. miR-373 is a novel negative miRNA to IFN-I signaling
  pathway by targeting NFIA, NFIB, IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK4, IFNAR1, and IFNAR2 to promote
  PRRSV replication. miR-382-5p inhibits IFN-I production by targeting HSP60 and promotes
  PRRSV infection. miR-30c targets JAK1 and IFNAR2 to impair IFN-I signaling and then
  enhance PRRSV replication. PRRSV infection significantly down-regulates the expression
  of miR-218 to increase the expression of SOCS3, which inhibits the IFN-I response.
  PRRSV infection gradually decreases the expression of miR-125b, which relieves the
  stabilizing effect of SOCS3 on κB-Ras2, leading to NF-κB activation to facilitate
  PRRSV multiplication. miR-24-3p suppresses HO-1 expression to facilitate PRRSV replication
  and infection.
