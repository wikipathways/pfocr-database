caption: CD36 functions as both a signal transducer and fatty acid transporter. In
  response to extracellular signals such as DAMPs, CD36 assembles and interacts with
  other membrane receptors, including NKA, TLRs, integrins, and tetraspanins, forming
  distinct signaling complexes. The signaling complexes subsequently relay the signals
  to various downstream effectors including SFKs, MAPK, AMPK, guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor Vav, and the NOX family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases.
  Activation of these effectors leads to ROS production as well as transcription factor
  activation, including PPAR-γ and NF-κB. Meanwhile, CD36 also binds with LCFAs and
  facilitates their transport across the plasma membrane, which impacts fatty acid
  metabolism and may contribute to activation of the PPAR-γ pathway. The dual functions
  of CD36 eventually integrate, leading to different cellular responses such as migration,
  immune activation, differentiation, and cell growth/death.
