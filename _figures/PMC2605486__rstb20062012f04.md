caption: Olig2 and the transcription factor network controlling motor neuron differentiation.
  Olig2 promotes motor neuron development through its ability to repress the expression
  of antagonists of motor neuron formation, such as Irx3, Scl and other unidentified
  target genes (X). The actions of ligand-bound retinoic acid receptors lead to the
  expression of transcription factors that act downstream of Olig2, including MNR2,
  Lim3 and Ngn2. The expression of Ngn2 is negatively regulated by Hes proteins that
  act downstream of the Notch signalling pathway. The balance of SoxB activator and
  repressor functions within motor neuron progenitors further regulates the activity
  of Ngn2 (; ). The activator properties of Sox1–3 appear to induce the expression
  of unknown inhibitors of Ngn2 function (Y). Sox21 acts downstream of Ngn2 and opposes
  the actions of Sox1–3 by reducing the expression of Y, thereby elevating Ngn2 activity
  and facilitating motor neuron differentiation. Through their ability to block Ngn2
  expression and activity, Notch signalling, Hes genes and Sox1–3 maintain progenitors
  in an undifferentiated state. The release of Ngn2 from these regulatory constraints
  leads to the upregulation of NeuroM and the exit of progenitors from the cell cycle.
  NeuroM then forms a transcriptional activator complex with Lim3 and Isl1/2, mediated
  by NLI, that displaces an Olig2 repressor complex from the Hb9 promoter and activates
  Hb9 expression to drive motor neuron-specific gene expression ().

  description: Olig2 and the transcription factor network controlling motor neuron
    differentiation. Olig2 promotes motor neuron development through its ability to

    The balance of SoxB activator and repressor functions within motor neuron progenitors
