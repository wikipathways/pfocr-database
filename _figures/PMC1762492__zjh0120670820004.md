caption: A mechanism-based model of intestinal disease. This model proposes a self-amplifying
  pathway where a small amount of luminal, eg, bacterial-derived, molecules cross
  the epithelium to activate lamina propria immune cells. This results in secretion
  of proinflammatory cytokines, eg, TNF, that signal to intestinal epithelial. This
  TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2)-mediated signal increases both MLCK transcription and enzymatic
  activity, resulting in occludin endocytosis and epithelial barrier dysfunction.
  The barrier loss results in greater access leakage of luminal material, greater
  immune activation, and even greater barrier defects. In the absence of appropriate
  regulatory cues, this triggers a self-amplifying cascade. Although described here
  as being initiated by luminal molecules activating immune cells, it should be apparent
  that the primary event could as easily be inappropriate immune activation or epithelial
  barrier dysfunction.
