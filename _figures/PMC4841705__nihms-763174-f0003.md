caption: 'Regulation of Macrophage NO Production by H. pylori. The infection of murine
  macrophages by H. pylori results in the expression of Slc7a2, Odc, Arg2, Hmox-1
  (the gene encoding HO-1), and Nos2 mRNA. L-arginine uptake is supported by SLC7A2,
  promotes NOS2 translation, and is required for NO production. ARG2 and H. pylori
  arginase RocF deplete intracellular and extracellular L-arginine, respectively,
  thus decreasing the synthesis of NOS2 and generation of NO. Spermine (Spm), which
  is synthesized through the ARG2-ODC pathway, inhibits SLC7A2-dependent L-arginine
  uptake and thus NOS2 translation and activity. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)
  is generated during H. pylori infection and is a natural NOS2 inhibitor. Abbreviations:
  Put, Putrescine; Spd, Spermidine.'
