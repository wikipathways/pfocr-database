caption: Possible proximal tubule epithelial cell signals in glomerulonephritis and
  renal cell carcinoma. (1) Low levels of calcium induce the release of parathyroid
  hormone (PTH) from parathyroid glands and this stimulates renal CYP27B1 expression.
  (2) 25(OH)D3, formed in the liver, is hydroxylated by CYP27B1 to form the active
  metabolite, 1α-25(OH)2D3. (3) CYP24A1 catalyzes the conversion of 25(OH)D3 and 1α-25(OH)2D3
  into 24-hydroxylated products targeted for excretion. (4) Elevated levels of 1α-25(OH)2D3
  induce the production of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), which suppresses
  CYP27B1 transcription. (5) 1α-25(OH)2D3 may antagonize PAMP/DAMP-induced inflammasome
  activation. (6) Vitamin D response elements (VDRE) in the PD-L1 gene may be functionally
  active in the renal epithelium. (7) PAMPs/DAMPs, ROS, and IL-1β activate PD-L1 transcription
  factors, HIF-1α and NF-kB. PD-L1 expression can be blocked with monoclonal antibodies.
  (8) 1α-25(OH)2D3 antagonizes Akt and the transcription factor STAT3 that may be
  induced by IL-6 and mTORC2. IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies block IL-6 signals.
  (9) Hypoxia promotes the stability and activation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Both mTORC1
  and mTORC2 are involved in HIF-1α regulation. mTORC2 regulates the expression of
  HIF-2α and is activated by VEGF cell signals. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors block VEGF
  receptor signals. (10) HIF-1α and HIF-2α induce the production of SDF-1 and VEGF.
  Antibodies that bind circulating VEGF block VEGF binding to its receptor. (11) Metformin-induced
  AMPK promotes PD-L1 phosphorylation and degradation. AMPK is also involved the phosphorylation
  of PGC-1α, which is additionally de-acetylated by sirtuins (SIRT1) during mitochondrial
  biogenesis and under conditions of normoxia. (12) Uric acid is a DAMP involved in
  the activation of the inflammasome and proximal tubule epithelial cell production
  of adiponectin. (13) Metformin and AICAR activate AMPK. Metformin therapy may induce
  the production of adiponectin. (14) γ-glutamyltransferase activity degrades glutathione
  (GSH) into its individual amino acids. (15) Reduced GSH scavenges free radicals
  and generates an oxidized form of GSH (GSSG). (16) GSH metabolism is associated
  with the activation of the pentose phosphate pathway. (17) NF-kB is antagonized
  by glucocorticoids and promotes the production of chemokines and ROS. (18) The cell
  signals that occur in response to PD-L1 ligation or blockade are not well characterized
