caption: 'Possible mechanisms of protection against IRI by GLP-1. (a) Cellular mechanism
  of lethal ischaemic injury. (b) The links between the known intracellular pathways
  involved in IRI and the two distinct cardioprotective pathways capable of interrupting
  this: The pro-survival kinase pathway, and the metabolic pathway. MPTP is the intersection
  between the two pathways. The possible second GLP-1 receptor remains a hypothesis.
  Also shown are known modulators of the pathways and clinical measures of cardioprotection
  [,,,].'
