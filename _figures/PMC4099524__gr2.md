caption: A Model of Raf transactivation. (A) Conserved domains – all Rafs share N-terminal
  Ras-binding domains (RBD) and cysteine-rich domains (CRD), both required for membrane
  recruitment. The Kinase Domain is located in the C-terminus, the activation loop
  is highlighted in green. Upstream of the Kinase Domain, the N-terminal Acidic motif
  (NtA; red boxes) contains phosphorylatable tyrosine residues (YY301/2 in A-Raf,
  Y340/41 in C-Raf), whereas B-Raf features aspartates in the corresponding region
  (D448/9). One Serine residue is conserved in all Raf proteins (S299 in A-Raf, S338
  in C-Raf and S445 in B-Raf), but is constitutively phosphorylated only in B-Raf.
  (B) Raf transactivation – activated Ras recruits B-Raf to the plasma membrane. Ras
  binding allows a further Raf monomer to bind and dimerize. In the dimer interface,
  the constitutively phosphorylated NtA of B-Raf (green dot) induces a conformational
  change that allows the cis-phosphorylation of the receiver kinase (here C-Raf),
  enabling it to phosphorylate Mek. Mek, in turn induces the phosphorylation of S338
  in the C-Raf NtA, converting it to a transactivator. (C) As a transactivator, C-Raf
  can dissociate from B-Raf and dimerize with, and transactivate, further Raf molecules.
  This cycle results in signal amplification.
