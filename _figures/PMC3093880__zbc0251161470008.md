caption: miR-122 and liver-related functions and diseases. The association between
  identified miR-122 targets and liver-related processes and diseases was investigated
  with Pathway Studio 6. Green indicates the genes identified in the proteomics analysis
  containing at least one miR-122 seed sequence; red indicates the genes identified
  by the luciferase analysis; blue indicates the genes identified by both methods.
  Liver function and disease associations are displayed in purple. ALDOA, aldolase
  A; Vim, vimentin; CS, citrate synthase; PXN, paxillin.
