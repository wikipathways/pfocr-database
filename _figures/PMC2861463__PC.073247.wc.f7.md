caption: Effects of ADT1 RNAi Suppression on Phenylpropanoid/Benzenoid Compounds,
  Aromatic Amino Acids, and the Shikimate Pathway Intermediates.Schematic representation
  of the shikimate and Phe biosynthetic pathways and benzenoid/phenylpropanoid network
  in petunia petals. Metabolite levels (blue background) and volatile emission (pink
  background with three vertical arrows) are shown in nmol/gFW and nmol/gFW/h, respectively.
  Black, gray, and white bars indicate the control and transgenic lines B and C, respectively.
  Data are means ± se (n = at least 5 biological replicates). N.D., not detectable
  (<0.5 nmol/gFW). * P < 0.01 by Student's t test of transgenics relative to control.
  ADH, arogenate dehydrogenase; CHA, chorismate; E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate; PEP,
  phosphoenolpyruvate.
