caption: Biosynthetic pathway for inositol pyrophosphates in yeast. IP3 generated
  from hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by Plc1 is the precursor
  for the synthesis of inositol poly-/pyrophosphates. Ipk2 catalyzes the synthesis
  of IP4 and IP5, and Ipk1 catalyzes the synthesis of IP6. Kcs1 can use IP5 or IP6
  as substrates. Kcs1 catalyzes the conversion of IP5 to 5PP-IP4 and further to (PP)2-IP3
  (not shown) and the conversion of IP6 to 5-IP7. Vip1 catalyzes the synthesis of
  1-IP7, and Kcs1 and Vip1 together catalyze the synthesis 1,5-bis-diphosphoinositol
  tetrakisphosphate (IP8). The open circles indicate axial hydroxyl groups that are
  not phosphorylated. The closed dark circles represent phosphate groups and the closed
  gray circles β-phosphates. Inositol polyphosphate nomenclature is described in Ref.
  .
