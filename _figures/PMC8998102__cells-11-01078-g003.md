caption: Possible interventions may focus on interfering with the signaling pathway
  of pyroptosis. a. Melatonin can reduce the expression of pyroptosis-related genes
  in the influence of endothelial cells. b. Treatment with bone morphogenetic protein
  7 (BMP-7) reduces caspase-1, Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and Interleukin-18 (IL-18),
  markers of pyroptosis cascade. c. Carbenoxolone can attenuate intracellular lipid
  accumulation and inflammation aggravation in the liver and skeletal muscle in obese
  mice induced by the high-fat diet by regulating the IkappaB-alpha (IκB-α)/ nuclear
  factor—kappaB (NF-κB) pathway and the nod-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome.
  d. Treatment of trimetazidine can reverse the pyroptosis of muscle in C2C12 mouses
  induced by dexamethasone.
