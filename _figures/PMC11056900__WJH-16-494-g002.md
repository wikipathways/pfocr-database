caption: 'Endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction modulates chronic liver disease. Upon
  occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), BiP dissociates from the three
  ER transmembrane proteins and binds to unfolded proteins with high affinity, and
  the dissociated transmembrane proteins shift to an active state and activate downstream
  signaling. Upon dissociation from BiP upon ERS, PERK endoplasmic reticulum stress
  increases the expression of bispecific phosphatase 5 in hepatocytes through the
  PERK/eIF2α/CHOP pathway as a means of raising the intracellular activated caspase-3
  levels, which ultimately induces hepatocyte death. ATF6 is cleaved upon dissociation
  from BiP during ERS onset, and cleaved ATF6α activates the transcription of XBP1u.IRE1α
  is activated and translocates to the cell membrane via the PI3K/AKT pathway, leading
  to extracellular Ca2+ inward flow, which disrupts the intracellular calcium homeostasis
  and triggers ERS, so that IRE1α, XBP1, PERK and CHOP upregulation, which ultimately
  leads to hepatic stellate cell activation and proliferation and promotes liver fibrosis.
