caption: C/EBPβ‐TRPC1‐SOCE signaling causes ER stress and dysregulation of protein
  enzymes and phosphatases. After G protein‐coupled receptors and tyrosine receptors
  were activated, PLC was subsequently activated to generate IP3 from PIP2. As a calcium
  channel, IP3R binds to IP3 and is activated, resulting in calcium ion outflow. When
  Ca2+ storage in the ER is depleted, STIM1/2 senses a reduction in Ca2+ in the ER,
  which leads to oligomerization and subsequent transfer from ER‐like sites to the
  plasma membrane, where it interacts with calcium conduction channels (ORAIs and
  TRPCs) to induce Ca2+ influx and storage regeneration. In the context of hTau overexpression,
  activated C/EBPβ binds to the TRPC1 promoter sequence, promoting TRPC1 transcription,
  then increases neuronal steady‐state [Ca2+] I, enhances endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  stress, imbalances protein kinases, and phosphatases, and exacerbates tauopathy.
  The C/EBPβ‐Trpc1‐soce‐signaling pathway in turn increases hTau, thus accelerating
  the progression of AD.
