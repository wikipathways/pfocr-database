caption: 'The perivascular space surrounding penetrating arterioles is involved in
  the clearance of unwanted molecules form the brain, including, but not limited to,
  Aβ and tau. Products of cerebral activity and metabolism reach the perivascular
  space by diffusion and can be disposed of through different pathways. A transvascular
  pathway is thought to rely on scavenger receptors and molecular transporters that
  carry the unwanted molecules across the vascular wall. A perivascular pathway has
  long been proposed in which the molecules are transported retrogradely along vascular
  basement membranes reaching the subarachnoid space and eventually discharging into
  the cervical nodes. A paravascular (glymphatic) pathway relies on aquaporin-4 channels
  (AQP4) on astrocytic end-feet to allow the CSF to enter the interstitial space,
  creating a convective flow that clears unwanted molecules from the brain and feeds
  into the perivascular venous side eventually draining into dural lymphatics or the
  cribriform plate. Abbreviations: CD36: cluster of differentiation 36; LRP1: low-density
  lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1; PICALM: Phosphatidylinositol Binding Clathrin
  Assembly Protein; SR-B: scavenger receptor B.'
