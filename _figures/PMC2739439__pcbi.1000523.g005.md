caption: 'A: Organization of LGT-derived proteins within the combined network. Each
  pie chart indicates a single protein, with the coloured arcs reflecting its phylogenetic
  profile (see inset key). The colour at the centre of each pie chart indicates module
  membership. Large coloured ovals grouping proteins define gene neighbourhoods (each
  gene is within 2000 bp of at least one other gene). Colours of links represent type
  of supporting evidence (GP = genome proximity; RS = Rosetta stone; PP = phylogenetic
  profiles; LT = literature curation; PD = pull down). The embedded colour key indicates
  the breakdown of taxonomic groups used to construct the phylogenetic profiles –
  numbers indicate the number of genomes associated with each group. B: Organization
  of LGT genes with the E. coli genome. The outer circle indicates the location of
  LGT genes. Grey lines indicate LGT genes not identified within our network. Coloured
  lines extending into the center indicate LGT genes identified within our network,
  organized into gene neighbourhoods. Coloured circles indicate the relationship between
  the gene neighbourhoods and their organization within the network shown in A. C:
  Network organization of proteins involved in hydrogenase biosynthesis. Two proteins
  associated with hydrogenase 3, hycE and hycG are thought to derive through LGT and
  are highlighted. Also present in the combined network are proteins associated with:
  hydrogenase 1 (hyaABDEF); hydrogenase 2 (hybCDFO); hydrogenase 4 (hyfBDFGI); hydrogenase
  maturation (hypBCDEF and slyD); and NADH∶ubiquinone biosynthesis (nuoBCEFGHILMN).
  D: Network organization of proteins involved in enterobactin synthesis and related
  processes. Again proteins thought to derive through LGT and are highlighted. Also
  shown are components of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway responsible for production
  of the chorismate precursor of enterobactin (trpABCDE); and components of two other
  related iron transport systems – fhuABCDE and fecABCD, which uptake iron via hydroxamate
  and dicitrate respectively.'
