caption: Opposing roles of Myd88 and RAGE in extensive liver resection. In this study,
  we addressed the roles of Myd88 and RAGE in the response to massive liver resection.
  Our findings reveal that the Myd88 pathway is essential for survival consequent
  to 85% resection of the liver. Myd88 action stimulates activation of NF-κB and subsequent
  up-regulation of key genes involved in liver regeneration responses, including TNF-α
  and Il6. In contrast, RAGE opposes the actions of Myd88 signaling by suppression
  of p65 levels, thereby reducing activation of NF-κB and consequent production of
  cyclin D1, and by suppression of Il6-mediated phosphorylation of Stat3, thereby
  down-regulating Pim1 and reducing the hyperplastic response. Further, RAGE-dependent
  suppression of Glo1, a detoxification pathway for pre-AGEs, enhances AGE levels
  and fuels a mechanism that suppresses Il6 action.
