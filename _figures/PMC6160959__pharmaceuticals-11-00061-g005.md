caption: Orlistat from PxEA perspective. The subnetwork shows how the targets of Orlistat
  are connected to the nearest pathway protein for the pathways shared between T2D
  and AD. For clarity, only the pathways that are proximal to the drug are shown.
  Blue rectangles represent pathways, circles represent drug targets (orange) or proteins
  on the shortest path to the nearest pathway gene (gray). Blue dashed lines denote
  pathway membership, solid lines are protein interactions. The interactions between
  the drug and its targets are shown in dashed orange lines and the interactions between
  the drug targets and their neighbors are highlighted with solid orange lines.
