caption: The schematic diagram shows the mechanism underlying cTFRC as a ceRNA for
  miR-107. Activation of the EMT signaling pathway in bladder cancer patients promotes
  transcriptional activation of TFRC, and expression of TFRC and cTFRC is increased
  in bladder cancer cells. On the one hand, TFRC can promote the degradation of E-cadherin,
  forming positive feedback to promote EMT, and ultimately promote cell invasion and
  migration. On the other hand, TFRC acts as a receptor to initiate multiple signaling
  pathways that promote downstream cell proliferation. In terms of mechanism, as shown
  by the dotted oval box, cTFRC upregulating the expression of TFRC by absorbs miRNA-107
  targeting TFRC, thereby promoting epithellal-mesenchymal transition, cell proliferation
  and cell invasion in bladder carcinoma
papertitle: Circular RNA cTFRC acts as the sponge of MicroRNA-107 to promote bladder
  carcinoma progression.
