caption: Three pathways of latent infection of HSV. (A) IE gene is adequate, the early
  expression gene is increased and largely neurons are cleaved and subsequently cleared.
  Due to the low copy number of HSV DNA in neurons, DNA synthesis is reduced and residual
  viruses are latent infection. (B) IE gene expression can produce ICP0 protein. ICP0
  activates the JNK signaling pathway, and AP-1 is phosphorylated, then activate LAT.
  LAT sequence is complementary to the IE gene encoding ICP0, which continuously consumes
  ICP0, so decrease IE gene expression. ICP0 and LAT increase histone occupancy and
  heterochromatin levels of lytic genes and block their transcription, causing HSV
  latency. (C) Low levels of ICP0 can promote the expression of LAT and lytic genes
  in latently infected ganglion, where the loading of total histone and heterochromatin
  on HSV genome was increased, maintaining latency. LAT transcription can downregulate
  lytic gene transcription during latency. Moreover, ICP0 promoted AP-1 nuclear translocation,
  which promotes the expression of LAT. Subsequently many products of LAT (LAT, MiR
  and ORF) are produced, which will make HSV latent through anti-apoptotic pathway.
