  Glucose, the central sugar in life. (A) Fischer projections of d-glucose (yellow shade), its non-biological occurring stereoisomer l-glucose (red), and the most common monosaccharides, hexoses
  and pentoses, found in nature. Differences between d-glucose
  with close related hexoses, d-mannose, d-galactose,
  and d-fructose, are highlighted in yellow. Note that the
  orientation of the last stereocenter is responsible for the d- and l-denominations of these sugars. (B) A schematic sequence
  of reactions of formaldehyde to form glycolaldehyde and subsequent
  aldoses and ketoses, the so-called formose reactions, that have been
  proposed as the abiotic origin of sugars. (C) Equilibrium of cyclization
  of linear d-glucose in solution. Glucose cyclizes, and the
  hydroxyl group on either position C4 or C5 undergoes an intramolecular
  reaction with the C1 carbonyl group of the aldehyde. As a result,
  the product formed is a hemiacetal resulting in either a 5- or 6-membered
  ring, in which the resulting hydroxyl group could present two orientations
  α- or β- concerning the ring plane. (D) Reactivity of d-glucose in solution leads to common sugars (i) d-fructose
  by an enediol rearrangement, and (ii) epimerization to d-mannose
  via an enolate intermediate. (E) Damaging of d-glucose with
  proteins, showing the reaction with lysine side chains via Schiff
  base formation and Amadori rearrangement, which ends in cyclic fructosamine.
  (F) Structure of common glucose disaccharides, showing maltose and
  cellobiose reducing disaccharides (grey shade) free anomeric hydroxyl
  group that can undergo a reducing reaction, while non-reducing disaccharides
  trehalose and sucrose (blue shade) compromise both anomeric carbons,
  therefore unavailable for reaction. (G) Overall metabolism of glucose.
  The glycolic and gluconeogenesis pathways (yellow), showing the classic
  Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway (EMP) and its variant
  Entner–Doudoroff pathway (ED; dashed box). This pathway integrates
  main pathways such as the Pentose phosphate pathway (PP; red shade),
  the tricarboxylic Krebs cycle, the photosynthetic Calvin cycle (green
  shade), and the glyconeogenesis/glycogenolysis pathways (blue shade).
  Other metabolic pathways are shown linked to this central energy metabolism
  (black dashed). Other molecules can serve as energy deposits (red
  letters). It is worth noting that glycogen is the energy closest storage
  molecule, directly linked to the initial point of glycolysis
