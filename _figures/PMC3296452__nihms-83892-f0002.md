caption: YAP is a 65KDa protein with several distinct domains or motifs. It has a
  proline-rich (P-rich) region at the N-terminal, two tandem WW domains in the middle
  followed by a Src homology domain 3 binding motif (SH3 BM) PVKQPPPLAP, a coiled-coil
  domain (CC), and a C-terminal capped by TWL sequence, a PDZ domain ligand. The N-terminal
  (aa 47-154 in human YAP2, shaded in blue) of YAP was mapped to be the TEAD family
  transcription factors interaction domain [], and the C-terminal of YAP (aa 292-488,
  shaded in pink) rich in serine, threonine, and acidic residues was shown to be a
  strong transcription activator []. The Lats phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding critical
  S127 in human YAP2 and its equivalent in Yki and TAZ are also shown. The topology
  of Yki and TAZ are shown in similar fashion and the proteins are drawn in scale.
