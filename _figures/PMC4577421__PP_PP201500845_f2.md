caption: Schematic model of the ethylene signaling pathway. In the absence of ethylene
  perception (left), the formation of functional ethylene receptors depends on a copper
  cofactor provided by the copper transporter RESPONSIVE TO ANTAGONIST1 (RAN1), as
  well as activation by REVERSION-TO-ETHYLENE SENSITIVITY1 (RTE1), which depends on
  cytochrome b5 (). The ethylene receptors (represented here by ETR1 and ERS1 homodimers)
  at the endoplasmic reticulum () membrane are in a protein complex with downstream
  components EIN2 and CTR1. The receptors associate with and activate (by an undefined
  signaling mechanism) the CTR1 protein kinase domain (KD), which phosphorylates the
  EIN2 C-terminal domain. Phosphorylation prevents EIN2 from signaling, and EIN2 is
  targeted for 26S proteasomal degradation by F-box proteins ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2
  TARGETING PROTEIN1 (ETP1) and ETP2. Meanwhile, in the nucleus, the F-box proteins
  ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 BINDING F-BOX1 (EBF1) and EBF2 target the EIN3/EIL1 transcription
  factors for 26S proteasomal degradation (only EIN3 is shown), preventing induction
  of gene expression such that there is no ethylene response. Additionally, there
  is a postulated secondary pathway from the receptors involving autophosphorylation
  of the His by the receptor His kinase () domain, and transfer of the phosphate to
  the receiver () domain, followed by transfer of the phosphate to ARABIDOPSIS HIS
  PHOSPHOTRANSFER (AHP), which is released by a conformational change in the receptors
  (indicated by the altered shapes of the  and  domains between the left and right
  sides) when they bind ethylene (right). The binding of ethylene (right) inactivates
  ethylene receptor signaling (indicated by the altered shapes of the  and  domains
  between the left and right sides). In addition, the levels of ERS1 and other ethylene
  receptor isoforms (not shown) increase (represented by the darker color on the right
  side relative to the left side) due to transcriptional induction, but reach an equilibrium
  state due to being degraded by the 26S proteasome. CTR1 levels increase in the complex
  as well (represented by the darker color on the right side relative to the left
  side) due to the increased level of ethylene receptors and protect the ETR1 receptor
  from proteolysis. However, the ethylene receptors no longer activate CTR1, and therefore,
  EIN2 is no longer phosphorylated. Instead, a cytoplasmic portion of EIN2 is proteolytically
  cleaved by an unidentified protease, and the liberated C-terminal portion of EIN2
  () moves into the nucleus where signal transmission results in EIN2-dependent 26S
  proteasomal degradation of the F-box proteins EBF1/2 and, consequently, the stabilization
  and accumulation of master transcription factors EIN3/EIL1. EIN3/EIL1 activate a
  transcriptional cascade that includes the downstream ERF1 transcription factor gene.
  An exoribonuclease (EXORIBONUCLEASE4 [XRN4]) also plays an indirect role in the
  repression of EBF1/2 mRNA.
