caption: A Tissue-resident macrophages release inflammatory mediators, such as CCL2,
  to recruit circulating monocytes after cardiac injury. M2 macrophages derived from
  monocytes are crucial cells that induce cardiac fibrosis, mainly promoting the activation
  of myofibroblasts by secreting TGF-β1, IL-1β, TNF, and IL-10. B When liver cells
  are damaged, Kupffer cells present in the hepatic sinusoids release chemokines such
  as CCL2, recruiting Ly-6Chi monocytes. Freshly infiltrated monocytes differentiate
  into M1 macrophages, which induce HSC activation by secreting TGF-β. The degree
  of liver fibrosis is primarily proportional to the number of M2 macrophages, which
  promote the production of ECM by myofibroblasts, mainly through the IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1
  pathway. C Renal cell injury triggers massive release of local CCL2 to recruit CCR2+
  monocytes. In the later stages of damage repair, monocytes or M1 macrophages polarize
  toward M2 macrophages and promote myofibroblast transformation by secreting a variety
  of cytokines that mediate EMT, MMT, and fibroblast activation. D Injury events lead
  to the aggregation of monocytes in lung tissue. Then, monocytes further polarize
  into M1 and M2 macrophages. M1 macrophage-induced inflammation that has not been
  properly resolved leads to abnormal proliferation and activation of fibroblasts.
  M2 macrophages promote the transformation and activation of myofibroblasts by secreting
  pro-fibrotic factors and mediating the activation of the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway,
  which leads to excessive ECM and pulmonary fibrosis
