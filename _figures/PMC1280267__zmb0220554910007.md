caption: Model schema for the phosphorylation of CRMP-2 by Rho kinase, Cdk5, and GSK-3β.
  Sema3A is thought to activate Cdk5 and GSK-3β. These activations cause phosphorylation
  at Ser-522, Ser-518, and Thr-514. Ephrin-A5 stimulation activates the Rho/Rho kinase
  signaling pathway and subsequently induces the phosphorylation of CRMP-2 at Thr-555
  by Rho kinase. The binding activity of CRMP-2 to tubulin is decreased by the phosphorylation
  by Cdk5, GSK-3β, and Rho kinase. Nonphosphorylated CRMP-2 binds to tubulin heterodimers
  to promote microtubule assembly or Numb-mediated endocytosis, thereby enhancing
  axon elongation and branching. In contrast, the phosphorylated form cannot associate
  with interacting molecules and loses the positive effect on axon elongation, thereby
  causing arrest of axon growth and growth cone collapse.
