caption: Proposed modes of mechanism of action of AZD5582 in OSCC. A, Upon activation
  by external death stimuli such as TNF, cIAP1/2 in OSCC trigger ubiquitination of
  RIP1, disabling its binding with FADD and CASP8 in the formation of ripoptosome
  complex, thereby preventing apoptosis. Likewise, necrosome formation is also inhibited.
  By contrast, cIAP1/2 promotes the ubiquitination cascade of LUBAC and IKK complexes,
  activating the NF-κB canonical signaling pathway, promoting cell survival. B, In
  the presence of high levels of TNF, AZD5582 degrades cIAP1/2, thereby preventing
  it from ubiquitinating RIP1. RIP1 forms the ripoptosome complex with FADD and CASP8,
  leading to cell death via apoptosis. Necroptosis is inhibited in the presence of
  CASP8, but on the contrary, if functional CASP8 is absent, the RIP1–RIP3–MLKL complex
  may lead to cell death via necroptosis. On the other hand, the NF-κB canonical signaling
  pathway is inhibited in the absence of cIAP1/2, impairing OSCC cell survival. TAB
