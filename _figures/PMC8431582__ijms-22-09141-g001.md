caption: 'NC-mesoderm interactions. (A) Left side: The medial lip of the nascent dermomyotome
  (DM) controls the timing of NC delamination. In the early dorsal neural tube (NT),
  prior to the onset of NC emigration, levels of noggin are high, in part due to somite-derived
  FGF signaling, thereby inhibiting the activity of BMP4 and consequent NC delamination.
  During somite dissociation, decreasing FGF signaling results in reduced transcription
  of noggin in the dorsal NT. Consequently, inhibition on BMP4 is relieved, Wnt1 transcription
  is stimulated and NC emigration is set in motion. In parallel, increasing retinoic
  acid (RA) levels in the DM act upon the dorsal NT to induce Wnt1 and trigger NC
  cell emigration (purple cells). (A) Right side: The DM and later dermis influence
  the choice of pathways followed by NC cells. During the early stage of NC migration,
  DM cells express the secreted ligand Slit2, which acts upon Robo1/2-expressing NC
  cells (green) to prevent them from entering prematurely the dorsolateral pathway.
  At a later stage of migration, the Edn3 ligand, expressed in the somite-derived
  dermis and in the ectoderm attracts melanoblasts (yellow) that express the Ednrb2
  receptor following delamination from the neural tube; this interaction guides them
  into the dorsolateral pathway. (B) Left side: The dorsal neural tube (NT) patterns
  the medial DM. NT-derived Bmp4 and Wnt1 signal the adjacent dorsal somite (S) to
  promote a medial identity, the development of the medial lip of the DM, and the
  expression of genes such as noggin and Wnt11, respectively. (B) Right side: Migrating
  NC cells regulate myogenesis. Migrating NC cells (purple) contact the dorsomedial
  lip of the DM and signal through Delta1 (Dll) to transiently activate Notch in the
  DM; this results in enhanced myogenesis at the expense of Pax7-positive progenitors
  in the epithelium. Migrating NC cells fated to become Schwann cells (green) along
  peripheral nerves signal through Nrg1/ErbB3 to the central and hypaxial DM and myotome
  (pink) to maintain the progenitor state while inhibiting myogenic differentiation.
  Stippled grey lines separate the NT in halves to illustrate different processes
  in each. See text for details and references. Abbreviations: No, notochord; Scl,
  sclerotome.'
