caption: 'Metabolites 24 h after X-irradiated mononuclear cells (XR) therapy in a
  middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse brain model-1. (a) Map of the central
  metabolic pathway and comparative visualization of the metabolites involved in XR
  cell therapy. (b) Total adenylate and adenylate energy change. Abbreviations: ATP,
  adenosine triphosphate; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate.
  (c) de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides after cell therapy. Differences in the
  levels of metabolites among the no-surgery control, MCAO-phosphate-buffered saline
  (PBS), and MCAO-XR cell groups are presented as bar graphs. ‘Ipsi’ represents the
  ipsilateral side, and ‘contra’ represents the contralateral side of the mouse brain.
  Black font indicates substances that were detected, and gray font indicates substances
  that were not detected in all groups. Differences were considered statistically
  significant at p < 0.05. All results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation
  (SD). The symbols *, **, and *** denote p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively'
