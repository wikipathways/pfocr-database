caption: Simplified scheme of stimulus–secretion-coupling pathways in the pancreatic
  beta cell and possible interaction points for alpha cell-derived paracrine signals.
  The triggering pathway of GSIS consists of glucose uptake through glucose transporters
  (GLUT), glucose metabolism, increase in the ATP/ADP ratio, closure of KATP channels
  (SUR1/Kir6.2) and opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC). This Ca2+ influx
  is the trigger for insulin release. The amount of insulin released is then modified
  by either metabolic amplification or modulation by extracellular inputs involving
  signalling through GLP-1 or glucagon receptors and cAMP/PKA/EPAC or through acetylcholine
  receptors and phospholipase C (PLC)/diacylglycerol (DAG)/protein kinase C (PKC)
  (denoted by PKC). The depicted extracellular inputs and subsequent signalling pathways
  represent the points of interaction for alpha cell derived paracrine signals. This
