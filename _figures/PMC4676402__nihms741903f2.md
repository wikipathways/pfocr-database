caption: (A) In this model the activation of the heterotrimeric G-protein is an obligated
  step to convey information through the regulated pathway, (i.e. activation of G-proteins
  depend on the transduced signal). G-proteins link receptors and operate as switches.
  The binding of an agonist to a coupled-receptor releases the heterotrimer from an
  inhibitory complex (e.g. with a GDI like protein). This promotes Gα self activation,
  dissociation of the heterotrimer and activation or inhibition of G-protein effectors.
  G-proteins convey information during receptor stimulation (ON state). Deactivation
  of receptors lead to deactivation of the G-proteins. GAP activity must accelerate
  deactivation and stabilize the heterotrimer in its OFF state. How receptors activate
  plant G-proteins is still unkonw and could include one or more intermediary proteins/steps
  (dashed arrows with question marks). (B) In this model the activation of G-proteins
  is not controled by the trigger-signal of the singnalling pathways, but rather controlled
  by the cell’s metabolic state. Thus G-proteins integrate metabolic information in
  the signaling network that controls cell division and cell expansion (i.e. growth).
  The free G-protein subunits, rather than the heterotrimer, are the ones integrated
  in the signaling pathways exerting a constitutive modulatory activity. Sustained
  activation of G-proteins involves the concerted activities of different WNK kinases,
  which encode intensity and duration of glucose signal to regulate RGS endocytosis.
  How glucose activates WNKs is still unkonw and could include one or more intermediary
  proteins/steps (dashed arrows and question marks). Phosphorylation of RGS promotes
  its endocytosis and physically uncoupling from the G-protein complex, allowing spontaneous
  nucleotide exchange in the Gα subunit and release of the Gβγ dimer. (C) In analogy
  with electronic circuits, the signal transduction networks are interconnected modules
  arranged to convert inputs in outputs. The panel in the left represent a wired diagram
  of this signaling network where G-proteins operate as switches in the circuits that
  convey signals triggered by development, stress, hormones, energy, nutrient, and
  diverse mitogens. Under situations that favor growth, the G-protein coupled pathways
  that respond to growth-inhibitory-stimuli (yellow) will be switched off at the G-protein
  module. The opposite (switch on) will occur in the G-protein coupled pathways that
  respond to growth promoting stimuli (green). In some cases this switch will be controlled
  by RGS endocytosis/RGS GAP activity, e.g. glucose (blue). The panel in the right
  represents a wired diagram of the rheostat model in a situation favorable to growth.
  In this example G-proteins are imposing maximum resistance to transmit information
  along pathways responding to growth-inhibitory-stimuli (yellow) or not resistance
  in pathways responding to growth promoting stimuli (green). The G-protein modulatory
  capacity represented by the variable resistor   symbol will depend on the cellular
  glucose content. In blue we show a pathway that convey information to boost cell
  division or cell expansion. Under nutrient availability glucose will promote RGS
  endocytosis shifting the G-protein rheostat to minimum resistance. Opposite, low
  levels of glucose will promote G-protein inactivation trough RGS GAP activity shifting
  the G-protein rheostat to maximum resistance. Plants lacking one or the other G-subunit
  still convey information trought the G-protein associated pathways but with modified
  intensity.
