caption: Toll is activated by the processed Spätzle (left). Toll activation leads
  to intracellular signaling via cytoplasmic proteins Tube and Pelle, leading to the
  degradation of Cactus and nuclear localization of NF-κB proteins Dorsal and Dif.
  These transcription factors bind to promoters of target genes, such as drosomycin,
  activating their transcription. The NF-κB protein for the Imd pathway, Relish, activates
  diptericin transcription. The signaling events resulting in Dorsal/Dif/Relish activation
  in the fly are “recycled” in mammals in the activation of mammalian NF-κB. See reviews
  and  for more details.
