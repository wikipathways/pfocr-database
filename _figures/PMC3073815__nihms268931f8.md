caption: The action sites of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and phorbol 12-myristate
  13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin, and major signaling pathway for interleukin-2 production
  are shown. At 10–100 µM of propofol, interleukin-2 production was inhibited with
  SEB stimulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), whereas only at 100
  µM, its production was inhibited with PMA/ionomycin stimulation (). Since propofol
  inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, we proposed the mechanism
  of propofol-mediated interleukin-2 reduction in our experiment.
