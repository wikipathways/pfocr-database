caption: A schematic model showing regulation of proinflammatory response by 25HC-integrin-FAK
  signaling network. Nod2 activation and virus (RSV and IAV) infection triggers expression
  of C25H, which results in production of 25HC. Extracellular 25HC activates integrin-FAK-NFκB
  signaling. Thus, 25HC links PRR (Nod2) pathway with integrin-FAK-NFκB signaling
  to confer optimal proinflammatory response following Nod2 activation and virus infection.
