caption: 'A simplified schematic of T-cell development is shown with the main stages
  of development within the thymus labeled, key checkpoints and choice points indicated
  in red labels, and selected transcription factors indicated at major points when
  they must act. The figure shows diagrammatically which events occur in the thymus
  and which ones occur either prethymically or in the periphery after T-cell maturation.
  Major decisions and stages that depend on GATA-3, PU.1, RORγt, T-bet, Foxp3, and
  multiple STAT factors are indicated. Runx, Ets, and bHLH family factors have continuing
  roles throughout these events, although the precise family members involved and
  their roles can change. T-lineage entry: migration of cells to the thymic microenvironment,
  which is rich in Notch-activating molecules. Commitment: relinquishment of potential
  to give rise to anything except T cells. β-selection, positive selection: two stages
  of TCR-dependent developmental checkpoint where cells with failed TCR status will
  die. Also shown are the stages when continuing Notch pathway signaling in the thymus
  is critical for T-cell specification: these are stages when the cells are “double
  negative”, i.e. lacking CD4 and CD8 expression. The stages within this immature
  series are ETP (Early T-cell Precursor), c-Kit++ CD44+ CD25−; DN2a, c-Kit++ CD44+
  CD25+; DN2b, c-Kit+(intermediate) CD44+ CD25+; DN3a, c-Kit− CD44− CD25+. TCR gene
  rearrangement does not result in expression of a TCRβ chain until the DN3a stage,
  but this triggers β-selection. The cells quickly downregulate CD25 and upregulate
  CD8 and CD4 through the series of stages shown as DN3b, DN4, ISP in transition to
  “DP”, or CD4+ CD8+ double-positive. These cells continue TCR gene rearrangement
  until they finally express TCRαβ. They are subject to stringent TCR-based MHC restriction
  and selection and only a minority are allowed to mature as CD4 SP or CD8 SP cells
  (Positive selection, CD4/CD8 choice). For simplicity, alternative intrathymic fates
  such as TCRγδ cells, invariant NKT cells (iNKT) or natural Tregs (natural Tregs)
  are not shown. Four major types of effector subsets of CD4+ cells, which develop
  from mature CD4 SP cells in the periphery, are shown, with some of the transcription
  factors that play major roles in their development. Despite the clear distinctions
  between the regulatory programs of these effector subsets, they remain conditionally
  plastic depending on environmental signals. Gray dashed-line arrows indicate several
  well-established options for interconversion. This feature contrasts the effector
  cell lineage decisions with the decision to commit to T-cell fate, which is irreversible.'
