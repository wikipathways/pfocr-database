caption: 'SNPs reported in seed sequence of miRNA involved in diabetes: (A) miR146a
  with SNP rs2910164 (C>G) raises vascular complications caused by upregulation of
  inflammatory factors (TNF associated factor 6 and IL1 associated kinase 1) in endothelial
  cells and induces apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells via NF-kB mediated pathway. (B)
  Reduced expression of miR499a due to SNP rs3746444 (A>G) provokes mitochondrial
  stress, impairs insulin signaling via PTEN mediated pathway, and promotes hepatic
  insulin resistance. (C) The miR124 rs34059726 (G>T) creates complimentary sequence
  for INSR; causing failure to transport GLUT4 transporter vesicle to outer membrane.
  This SNP also inhibits glycogenesis process via GSK-3β activation. (D) miR-3188
  with rs7247237 (C>T) inhibits PI3K/AKT pathway dysregulating protein synthesis.
  Its target genes overexpression (GSTM1 and TRIB3) curtails nitric oxide pathway
  which increases vascular complications and induces β-cell apoptosis.'
