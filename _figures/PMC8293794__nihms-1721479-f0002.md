caption: Current therapies that affect IL-21/IL21R pathway, either on the market or
  in clinical trials to treat autoimmune diseases. The insert shows the intracellular
  signaling of IL21R that would likely be occurring in the CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells,
  and B cells within the tissue simultaneously. NNC0114–0006 is a monoclonal antibody
  against IL-21 that is currently in clinical trials for RA and type 1 diabetes mellitus;
  BOS161721 binds to IL-21 so that it can no longer bind the IL21R and currently is
  in trials for SLE. ATR-107 is a monoclonal antibody against the IL21R. Tofacitinib
  (JAK1/3 inhibitor) and Upadacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor) prevent IL21R downstream signaling
  and are in consideration for RA, psoriasis, JIA, vasculitis, and other skin conditions.
  HL237 is a STAT3 inhibitor with potential for treating RA. Figure image created
