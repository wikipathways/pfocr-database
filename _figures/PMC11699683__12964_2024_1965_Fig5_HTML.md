caption: Potential signaling pathways of UA-mediated antioxidative stress and anti-neuroinflammation
  in neurodegenerative diseases. To elucidate the mechanisms of UA-mediated antioxidative
  stress and anti-neuroinflammation, further investigation is required into the impact
  of UA on key signaling pathways implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as
  Il6/STAT3, Akt/GSK3β, and Wnt/β-catenin, along with neurotrophins like BDNF/TrkB
  and NGF/TrkA. These signaling pathways have demonstrated roles in regulating oxidative
  stress and neuroinflammation in various neurological disorders. BDNF, brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor; NGF, nerve growth factor
