caption: (A) Link between DNA damage and transcription, and pathway of DSB-induced
  transcriptional repression. (Left) UV damage-stalled RNA Polymerase II recruits
  NER proteins and induces transcription coupled repair (TCR). (Right) DSBs activate
  ATM and/or DNA-PKcs and promote DSB-induced transcriptional repression and DSB repair.
  Under the ATM-signaling, PBAF, RNF8/RNF168 and ENL/PRC1 were reportedly involved
  in DSB-induced transcriptional repression. (B) Models of collaboration between ENL/AF9
  and PRC1 in DSB-induced transcriptional repression. I) During transcriptional activation,
  ENL/AF9 in SEC promotes transcriptional elongation. II) When DSB(s) is introduced
  near transcriptional sites, ATM phosphorylates ENL/AF9 at evolutionarily well-conserved
  SQ-sites. This phosphorylation of ENL/AF9 recruits PRC1 at transcription-sites through
  BMI1 to promote ubiquitination of H2A and transcriptional repression. Thus, ENL/AF9
  in SEC would be key factors for the switch of transcriptional elongation to rapid
  repression, in response to cellular signaling. Dot-line indicates that it is not
  clear how these factors repress transcription.
