caption: Model for cNT signaling in Mtb. Mtb produces the cNT second messengers cAMP,
  c-di-AMP and c-di-GMP to control key bacterial processes. Despite differences between
  the specific molecular players, all three signaling pathways involve nucleotide
  cyclases (pale blue), PDEs (red) and protein effectors (blue). Additionally, all
  three cNTs play important roles in interspecies signaling between Mtb and mammalian
  innate immune cells. More work is required to determine the specific signaling outcomes
  for each cNT pathway, and to identify the exact roles played by cNTs during different
  stages of Mtb infection.
