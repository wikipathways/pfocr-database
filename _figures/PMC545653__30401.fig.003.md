caption: A partial diagram of the phenylpropanoid pathway showing intermediates and
  enzymes involved in isoflavone synthesis, as well as some branched pathways. The
  enzymes in bold are encoded by genes expressed as transgenes in Yu et al []. Genes
  encoding the underlined enzymes have been shown to be activated in maize by C1 and
  R. Dotted arrows represent multiple steps. Enzymes are indicated in italics (adapted
  from [,  ]). Glycitein (a glyceollin) is hypothesized to be  made from daidzein
  in a multistep process (hydroxylation, oxidation, and acetylation) see .
