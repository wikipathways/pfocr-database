caption: The schematic representation of mechanism by which MSC-derived exosomes containing
  miR-133b affect glioma cell activities. MSCs transfer miR-133b to glioma cells through
  exosomes to inhibit the EZH2 expression via suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway, whereby the glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion are diminished,
  and ultimately, the progression of glioma is attenuated
papertitle: Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomal microRNA-133b suppresses glioma
  progression via Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by targeting EZH2.
