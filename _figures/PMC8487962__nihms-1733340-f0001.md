caption: 'The complement cascade can be triggered by distinct initiation mechanisms:
  The classical pathway is initiated by antigen (Ag) – antibody (Ab) complex–mediated
  activation of the C1 complex. The lectin pathway is activated when complexes of
  mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) bind to
  microbial surfaces. The alternative pathway can be triggered by a ‘tick-over’ mechanism
  involving spontaneous hydrolysis of C3, if a regulatory mechanism is absent (as
  is typically the case with microbial surfaces). The so-called ‘alternative pathway
  (AP)-amplification loop’ (in which more C3 is cleaved into more C3b which further
  fuels the loop) amplifies complement activation independently of the initiating
  mechanism, thereby contributing most of the downstream terminal pathway-mediated
  effector responses (i.e., C5a, membrane attack complex [MAC]). All three mechanisms
  of complement activation and amplification converge at C3, which is thus an attractive
  target of pharmacological interception, e.g., by the cyclic inhibitory peptide AMY-101.
  If C3 is not blocked, downstream effects include the generation of effectors (C3a
  and C5a) that promote inflammation and the generation the C5b-C9 MAC with potential
  antimicrobial but also tissue destructive capacity. Whereas the role of MAC in periodontitis
  is uncertain, C3a and C5a activate their cognate G-protein-coupled receptors (C3aR
  and C5aR1), which cross-talk with Toll-like receptors. This cross-talk synergistically
  activates inflammatory leukocytes, which can directly or indirectly mediate destructive
  periodontal tissue inflammation and bone loss in periodontitis [, ]. Complement-mediated
  inflammation also promotes the dysbiosis of the periodontal microbial community
  [, ]. C3 blockade can prevent these downstream effects and thereby offer broader
  protection against periodontitis [, ]. TLR, toll-like receptor.'
