caption: Schematic model of the crosstalk between hepatitis C virus and autophagy.
  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication occurs in replication complexes that assemble
  at the ER resulting in ER stress and induction of an unfolded protein response (UPR).
  The UPR activates three signaling pathways (ATF6, IRE1, PERK) and finally autophagy.
  In addition the UPR can be triggered by NS4B through activation of the IRE1 and
  ATF6 pathway as NS4B interferes with Ca2+ homeostasis resulting in elevated reactive
  oxidant species (ROS). Elevated ROS levels trigger phosphorylation of p62 on Ser351
  (p-p62) following subsequent activation of Nrf2. NS4B further forms a complex with
  Rab5, Vps34 and Beclin-1 stimulating an autophagic response. In addition the human
  immunity-associated GTPase family M (IRGM) protein interacts with NS3/4A and the
  autophagosomal protein Atg5, Atg10 and LC3 that trigger autophagy. Activation of
  autophagy favors HCV replication and plays a crucial role in release of viral particles.
  Here, the interaction of TIP47 and activated Rab9 (aRab9) to the particles is essential.
  Moreover, HCV-induced autophagy impairs innate immunity and favors cell survival
  via inhibition of apoptosis.
