caption: Schematic diagram illustrating inflammatory signaling pathways of FPRs. (A)
  Intracellular transduction signaling pathway of FPRs. The activation of FPRs originates
  from sensing and binding PAMPs and DAMPs, results in the dissociation of the Gα
  from the Gβγ subunit. The latter activates PLCβ, resulting in release of calcium
  from intracellular stores then activate PKCs. Another pathway triggered by the βγ
  subunit is that PI3Kγ activate PKCs and Akt. Furthermore, α subunit activates GTPases
  of the Ras superfamily, which further contribute to activation of the MAPK pathways,
  p38, and ERK1/2. (B) Dual pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects of FPRs signaling.
  Endogenous SAA and bacterial original fMLF bind to FPRs, mediate pro-inflammatory
  actions, such as chemotaxis, superoxide anion production, calcium mobilization,
  macrophage phagocytosis, and degranulation. On the other hand, FPRs pro-resolving
  agonists include AnxA1, LXA4, and RvD1. This process prevents producing TNFα, IL-1β,
  IL-6, ROS, bradykinin and inhibit neutrophil migration. Furthermore, the pro-resolving
  procedure deactivates tyrosine kinase receptors, leading to downstream signaling
  event that promote cell differentiation and proliferation, as well as enhancing
  cellular migration and survival. Gα, G-protein α; Gβγ, G-protein βγ.
