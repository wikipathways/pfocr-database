caption: Hypothetical pathway of Nɛ-acetyl-β-lysine synthesis in methanogenic archaea.
  α-Lysine is converted by the activity of a lysine-2,3-aminomutase to β-lysine, which
  is then acetylated to Nɛ-acetyl-β-lysine.

  Archaea Are Salt Induced and Are Essential for the Biosynthesis of Nɛ-Acetyl-β-Lysine
  and Growth at High Salinity.
