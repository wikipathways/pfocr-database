caption: Strategies to induce pyroptosis in tumor cells. (a) GSDME expression is silenced
  in most cancer cells, likely attributed to promoter methylation. Treatment with
  the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine (DAC) restores GSDME expression,
  thereby sensitizing cancer cells to pyroptosis. The combination of decitabine and
  chemotherapeutic drugs (CDs) can lead to tumor cell pyroptosis via the caspase-3-GSDME
  pathway. Tumor-targeting nanoparticles loaded with decitabine and chemotherapeutic
  drugs may be useful to induce pyroptosis in tumors without causing damage in normal
  tissues. (b) A bioorthogonal chemical system has been established to induce tumor
  cell pyroptosis. In this system, active GSDMA3 protein is conjugated to gold nanoparticles
  via a silyl ether linker that can be cleaved by desilylation that is catalyzed by
  phenylalanine trifluoroborate (Phe-BF3), a cancer-imaging probe. Both the nanoparticles
  and Phe-BF3 selectively accumulate in tumors, enabling controlled release of active
  GSDMA3 in tumor cells. (c) Viral transduction of active forms of GSDMs can also
  lead to pyroptosis. In a previous study, adeno-associated serotype 1 virus (AAV1)-based
  vector that expresses GSDMD-N under the control of the schwann-cell-specific promoter
  P0 was made for the purpose of inducing pyroptosis in schwannomas.
