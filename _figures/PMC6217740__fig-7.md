caption: 'NosP-associated signal transduction pathways in bacteria. (A) In P. aeruginosa,
  NO/NosP inhibits NahK autokinase activity and therefore phosphate flux through the
  associated signaling pathway. This leads to a change in biofilm formation in P.
  aeruginosa. (B) In V. cholerae, NO/NosP inhibits Vc-NqsK autokinase activity and,
  therefore, quorum sensing. (C) In L. pneumophilia, NO/NosP inhibits NahK activity,
  which, in turn, decreases phosphate flux through the associated signaling pathway
  and may result in the regulation of biofilm formation in this bacterium. (D) In
  S. oneidensis, NO/NosP inhibits NahK autokinase activity, which decreases phosphate
  flux to three response regulator proteins: EAL, HtH, and HD-GYP. ?, uncharacterized
  pathway; NahK, NosP-associated histidine kinase; NosP, NO-sensing protein; Nqsk,
