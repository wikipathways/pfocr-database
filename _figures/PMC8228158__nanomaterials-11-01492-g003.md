caption: Metabolic network of PHA metabolism in model bacteria C. necator H16 (scl-PHA)
  and P. putida KT2440 (mcl-PHA). Fatty acids are metabolized via the β-oxidation
  cycle into acetyl-CoA, while nonfatty acid substrates are metabolized via the Entner-Doudoroff
  (ED) pathway, TCA and PPP, into acetyl-CoA. In PHB metabolism, two acetyl-CoA molecules
  condensate into acetoacetyl-CoA by PhaB and are then converted into R-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
  (PHB monomer) by PhaA. In PHA metabolism, fatty acids are metabolized in the β-oxidation
  cycle, where the intermediates 3-ketoacyl-CoA and trans-2-enoyl-CoA can be directly
  converted into PHA monomers (R-3-HA-CoA) by FabG and PhaJ, respectively. Alternatively,
  through de novo fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA can be converted from R-3-hydroxyl-ACP
  to R-3-HA-CoA by two enzymatic steps catalyzed by PhaG and AlkK. PHA and PHB are
  synthetized in a continuous cycle that drives carbon and energy flux, in which the
  monomers are polymerized by PhaC, depolymerized into the respective R-3-hydroxycarboxylic
  acids by PhaZ, and reconverted into the activated monomer R-3-HA-CoA by Acs1. The
  carbon central metabolic pathways are indicated in green, the pathway leading to
  PHB synthesis is in purple, and the one leading to PHA synthesis is shown in blue.
  Key enzymes are indicated.
