caption: Schematic illustration represents the potential signaling transduction mechanism
  by which cancer cell-derived exosomes prevent monocyte apoptosis. Malignant cell-derived
  exosomes transfer phosphorylated RTKs to monocytes through membrane fusion, and
  activate downstream MAPK (Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK) signaling pathway in monocytes. The activation
  of ERK prevents the cleavage of caspases and promotes monocyte survival.
