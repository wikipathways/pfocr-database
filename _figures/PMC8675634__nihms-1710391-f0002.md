caption: a∣ Here we highlight a few of the signaling pathways induced by E. coli tryptophan
  catabolites. Indole stimulates tight junctions and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1),
  respectively, affecting intestinal barrier integrity and glycometabolism homeostasis.
  An indole concentration gradient in the human gut influences the virulence gene
  expression in EHEC, with the expression of the LEE pathogenicity island decreasing
  in the presence of indole. Several tryptophan catabolites act as aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AhR) ligands to influence host immune response. Indole-3-lactic acid (ILA)
  stimulates the development of CD4+CD8αα+ intraepithelial lymphocytes. b∣ Tryptophan
  catabolites produced by E. coli that also serve as AhR ligands include indole, indole
  acetic acid (IAA), and ILA. E. coli also produce the AhR ligands indolokine A4 and
  indolokine A5, which are formed from indole-3-pyruvic acid (I3P) and L-cysteine,
  and resemble the potent AhR agonist 2-(1′H-indole-3′-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic
  acid methyl ester (ITE). c∣ The tryptophan derivative 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate
  (4-HPPA) reacts with 7,8 dihydropterin, a degradation product of the folate/monapterin
  pathway, to form a molecular family termed the colipterins.
