caption: 'Schematic diagram showing the four independent signal transduction pathways
  that activate wound and defense genes in tomato. The PR genes (PR-1, PR-4, and GluB)
  utilize two signaling pathways: a SA-dependent and an ethylene-dependent pathway.
  PR-1 and GluB utilize a third pathway, a systemin-independent, JA-dependent pathway,
  which may be analogous to the SA-independent pathway used to induce defensins in
  Arabidopsis (). The fourth signaling pathway is the octadecanoid pathway, which
  in tomato utilizes systemin, ABA, JA, and ethylene to activate the wound-response
  genes (LapA1, LapA2, and pin2) and SA to down-regulate the pathway. There is evidence
  for a fifth signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. A JA-independent mechanism for wound-response
  gene activation was recently described, but tomato genes activated by this pathway
  have yet to be identified ().'
