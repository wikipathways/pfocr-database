caption: In the canonical pathway, keratinocytes that acquire DNA damage, usually
  through ultraviolet light (UVB), respond by upregulating tumor protein 53 (p53).
  p53 in turn is a transcription factor for proopiomelanocortin (POMC), thus upregulating
  its expression. POMC is proteolytically cleaved to its products, alpha melanocyte
  stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), which are secreted
  by keratinocytes and bind the melanocortin 1 (MC1R) on melanocyte membranes. This
  ligand-receptor binding propagates the signal transduction in melanocytes via adenylcyclase,
  protein kinase A (PKA), and cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) to
  ultimately upregulate MiTF expression. When MiTF is phosphorylated through other
  mechanisms, it is translocated to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor
  for tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase related protein 1 (TYRP1), and dopachrome tautomerase
  (DCT), which are all enzymes required to convert tyrosine to eumelanin. Eumelanin
  is then packaged and transferred back to keratinocytes via protease-activated receptor
  2 (PAR2) to protect against further keratinocyte nuclear damage.
