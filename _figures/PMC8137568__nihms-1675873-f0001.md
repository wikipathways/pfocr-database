caption: a. Upon their activation, conventional T cells upregulate the metabolic pathways
  of aerobic glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and lipid synthesis. They also increase mitochondria
  biogenesis to upregulate mitochondria-associated metabolic processes, including
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the
  methionine- and serine-dependent one-carbon metabolism pathway that is necessary
  for epigenetic programming and redox balance. Extracellular nutrients, including
  glucose, glutamine, methionine, and serine, are crucial for the induction of these
  different metabolic programs. Glucose metabolism can also support serine synthesis
  via its metabolic 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG). Fatty acids can also be used as a fuel
  source for OXPHOS in subsets of activated T cells. b. Mitochondrial biogenesis and
  OXPHOS, as well as lipid synthesis, are crucial for maintaining Treg cell functional
  activation and proliferation. These metabolic processes are activated downstream
  of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, which is induced
  by TCR engagement in the presence of the amino acids, leucine and arginine. Notably,
  excessive mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production reduces Treg cell survival. Furthermore,
  excessive levels of anabolic metabolism (e.g. mitochondrial oxidative respiration
  or aerobic glycolysis), as a consequence of increased mTOR signaling, dampens Treg
  cell lineage stability. Treg cell stability can be counteracted by certain metabolites,
  including glutathione (GSH) that limits serine uptake and serine-induced mTORC1
  activation in Treg cells.
