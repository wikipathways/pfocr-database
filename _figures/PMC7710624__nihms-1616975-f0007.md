caption: Schematic of RAS pathway features identified in this study. Among them are
  new, paralog-specific RAS/effector GI and PPIs, heterogeneity in GIs between MAPK
  pathway components, new roles in membrane dynamics for the RAS effectors RIN and
  RADIL, a striking intersection between RAS and RAP signaling, and synthetic lethal
  GIs between RALA and RALB and between RAP1GDS1 and RHOA that are contingent on KRAS
  activity.
