caption: The solid arrows represent pathway relationships that have been defined genetically
  by molecular epistasis analysis or that have been implied through pathway up- or
  down-regulation. For example, Prox1 expression is lost in mice with a placodal loss
  of Pax6 and so Prox1 is placed downstream. The dashed arrows represent direct physical
  interactions that have been defined by biochemical experiments. There are elements
  of speculation in this model. For example, Bmp4 expression is lost in the optic
  vesicle of Frs2α2F/2F mutant, but it is unclear whether this regulation occurs within
  the optic vesicle (the model shown) or is a consequence of Frs2α-dependent signaling
  to the presumptive retina from the presumptive lens. See the text for further explanation
  of these interactions. The word “ligands?” placed between the boxes representing
  the presumptive lens and presumptive retina is designed to indicate that so far,
  no conventional FGF ligands are known to be critical for this inductive interaction.
  On the left side of the figure, the approximate embryonic (E) stages at which these
  events occur are indicated.
