caption: Role of RNF11 in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway.
  Following ligand binding, the ubiquitination of the TGF-b receptor promoted by the
  SMURF2-SMAD7 E3 ligase complex targets the receptor to the lysosome or the proteasome
  for degradation. From the early endosomes, the TGF-b receptor can be sorted to recycling
  endosomes and return back to the cell surface or it can be driven to late endosomes
  and lysosomes for degradation. The activated receptor complex recruits and phosphorylates
  the receptor-regulated SMAD (R-SMADs, e.g. SMAD2 and SMAD3). Association of TGF-b
  receptors with early endosomes adaptor proteins such as SMAD anchor for receptor
  activation (SARA), leads to the enhancement of TGF-ß -induced SMAD activation and
  the subsequent propagation of SMAD-dependent signaling. Activated R-SMADs dissociate
  from the TGF-β receptors and associate with Smad4, a common-partner for all R-Smads
  (Co-SMAD). These complexes translocate into the nucleus where they regulate transcription
  of TGF-b family target genes by binding transcriptional factors, transcriptional
  coactivators and corepressor. Posttranslational modifications of SMAD proteins,
  among which ubiquitination by NEDD4 family of E3-ligases, provide an additional
  level of regulation of the TGF-β signaling, controlling protein stability and function.
