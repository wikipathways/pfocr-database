caption: Adaptive and maladaptive responses to metabolic acidosis in CKD. The adaptive
  response to metabolic acidosis in CKD is centered on an increase in ammoniagenesis,
  ET-1 production, and intrakidney RAAS expression (angiotensin II and aldosterone),
  all of which are necessary to promote acid excretion. In the adaptive response,
  these components activate NHE3-mediated Na+/H+ exchange, along with H+-ATPase and
  H+/K+-ATPase expression, and increase ammonium excretion to effectively increase
  acid excretion per nephron, thereby decreasing acid retention. However, sustained
  expression of this adaptive response, as seen in chronic metabolic acidosis, can
  lead to damaging activation of the alternative complement pathway cascade due to
  increased ammoniagenesis, along with production of proinflammatory and profibrotic
  mediators. This maladaptive response injures tubule-interstitial tissue, leading
  to loss of nephron function and worsening CKD.
