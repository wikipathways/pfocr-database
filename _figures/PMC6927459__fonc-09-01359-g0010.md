caption: 'The crosstalk between PSC and pancreatic cancer cells. (A) Overview of the
  support provided by aPSC to PaCa survival, expansion and gain in aggressiveness
  and feedback by the tumor cell, which sustains PSC activation, expansion and matrix
  protein synthesis. (B) Some of the important components delivered by aPSC toward
  tumor cells and the initiated changes with a focus on altered metabolism. Glutamate
  derived from influxed glutamine can replace the TCA cycle to generate citrate, which
  also can derive from the pyruvate-PDK-Ac-CoA pathway. Lactate, delivered via lactate
  transporters supports glutamine and glucose generation, GSH upregulation and ROS
  reduction. Glucose also becomes enriched by glucose transporter in the tumor cell,
  where PKM2 via NADH and ATP promotes pyruvate generation. After lysosome degradation
  of aPSC autophagosomes, a plethora of AA, lipids, lipoproteins, sugars, and nucleotides
  is delivered that in part are taken up by specific receptors, not all being identified
  so far. Alternatively, autophagosomes are taken up by macropinocytosis, the macropinosome
  content being delivered after lysosome degradation. Lysosome degradation is also
  required for the delivery of the aPSC Exo content. Another option is receptor-mediated
  uptake of selective transmembrane complexes as ANXA6 bound LRP1 and THBS1. The predominant
  route of transfer from aPSC in PaCa cells is indicated by a color code: red: signaling
  receptor mediated uptake; blue: delivery or uptake by transporters; vesicle uptake:
  green; violet: receptor-mediated lipid and lipoprotein uptake; an olive circle encloses
  for a few of the aPSC-delivered components the pathway, whereby they contribute
  to the altered metabolism of PaCa cells; others may directly support PaCa survival
  and aggressiveness. Full name of proteins are listed in . aPSC support PaCa survival,
  expansion and progression, which to a considerable degree relies on their input
  of components initiating energy generation by altered metabolic pathways. Despite
  the focus on PSC-promoted metabolic adaptation of PaCa cells, the presented data
  cover only a minor part of the present state of knowledge and additional information
  can be expected by improved proteomic methodologies combined with organoid cultures.'
