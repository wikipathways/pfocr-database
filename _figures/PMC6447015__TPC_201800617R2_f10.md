caption: Model for the Modulation of Shade Elongation Responses by Retrograde Signals.In
  green plants with functional chloroplasts, low R/FR (i.e. canopy shade) signals
  promote accumulation of growth-promoting PIFs (via phyB deactivation) and also of
  growth-repressing HY5 (via phyA), likely to prevent an excessive elongation response.
  Persistent shading or other environmental factors challenging chloroplast function
  (including exogenous treatment with LIN or NF) can repress phyB inactivation, enhance
  HY5 expression, and likely promote HY5 stability, eventually resulting in decreased
  elongation growth. An independent pathway involves ABA, a CRT-derived hormone that
  represses shade-triggered hypocotyl elongation via ABI3 and ABI4. NF (but not LIN)
  prevents the production of ABA. As a result, loss of both HY5 and ABA in NF-treated
  hy5 seedlings allows them to elongate when exposed to low R/FR, whereas this hypocotyl
  response is blocked by low but detectable levels of ABA in LIN-treated mutants.
