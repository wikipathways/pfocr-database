caption: 'Signaling machinery involved in macroautophagy. Macroautophagy requires
  the formation of distinct complexes during four sequential stages: (1) induction
  and (2) nucleation of the phagophore; (3) elongation and closure of the autophagosomes;
  and (4) fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. See text for details. The mTORC1
  complex is regulated by stimulation of the class I PI3K–AKT pathway by growth factors,
  and via the regulation of RAG and AMPK proteins by amino acid (A.A.) or glucose
  starvation, respectively. mTORC1 negatively regulates the ULK1 complex, and starvation
  or growth factor withdrawal inhibits mTORC1, leading to its dissociation and dephosphorylation/activation
  of ULK1. Other mTOR-dependent or -independent stimuli such as hypoxia, ER stress,
  proteasome inhibition (proteasome aggregation and ubiquitination), apoptosis, and
  pathogen infection could lead to the induction autophagy by the activation of diverse
  signaling pathways. Autophagic cargo include any unwelcomed intracellular content
  such as long-lived or aggregated proteins/lipids, damaged organelles, and invading
  microbes. ER, endoplasmic reticulum. To see this illustration in color, the reader
