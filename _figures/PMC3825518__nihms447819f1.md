caption: Anti-miR (inhibitors of miRNA activity) chemistries are synthesized as antisense
  oligonucleotides (complementary to the mature miRNA) containing chemical modifications
  to enhance binding affinity, confer nuclease resistance, facilitate cellular uptake
  and reduce clearance. The liver and the intestines synthesize apolipoprotein-AI
  (A–I), which is secreted in a lipid-poor form and promotes the transfer of excess
  of cellular-free cholesterol (yellow dots) and phospholipids, via the ATP-binding
  cassette A1 (ABCA1) pathway, forming the nascent high density lipoprotein (HDL).
  The plasma lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) esterifies free cholesterol
  to cholesteryl ester (CE), forming mature HDL. In certain cell types, ABCG1 and
  probably the scavenger receptor, class B type 1 (SR-BI) promotes cholesterol efflux
  to mature HDL. Mature HDL can transport cholesterol back to the liver directly via
  SR-BI or alternatively, HDL cholesteryl ester (HDL-CE) is exchanged for triglycerides
  (TG) in apolipoprotein-B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins (very low-density lipoprotein
  [VLDL]/low density lipoprotein [LDL]) through cholesteryl ester transfer protein
  (CETP) and then taken up by the liver via the LDL receptor (LDLR). Returned cholesterol
  in the liver is eliminated as cholesterol and bile acids. The whole process is known
  as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). As intracellular excess of free cholesterol
  is toxic, cells trigger different mechanism to eliminate cholesterol excess. Through
  the SREBPs, the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol is inhibited. High levels of
  cholesterol induce the formation of oxysterols, natural ligands of the liver X receptors
  (LXRs). LXRs induce the expression of proteins involved in cholesterol efflux, ABCA1
  and ABCG1. Different physiological process induce the expression of several miRNAs
  that target either ABCA1, ABCG1 or other proteins involved in cholesterol efflux,
  thus reducing the elimination of free cholesterol excess. Anti-miR therapies against
  these miRNAs will results in a derepression of their target genes and increase cholesterol
  efflux. Through a not well understood mechanism, cells also eliminate cholesterol
  to the intestine for fecal excretion via a mechanism known as trans-intestinal cholesterol
  efflux (TICE). Pharmacological therapies to either inhibit (anti-miR) or increase
  (miRNA mimics) the activity of miRNAs directly or indirectly related to cellular
  cholesterol efflux are potential candidates to increase RCT and treat different
  pathologies associated to dyslipidemia.
