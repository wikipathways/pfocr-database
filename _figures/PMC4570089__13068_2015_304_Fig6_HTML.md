caption: Proposed one carbon metabolic pathway in T. saccharolyticum. Green arrows
  indicate the pathway for 10-formyl-THF production. Note that this pathway requires
  formate, which is presumably generated by PFL in T. saccharolyticum. Blue arrows
  indicate the active pathways of pfl deletion strains grown in MTC-6 supplemented
  with additional serine. Orange arrows indicate active pathways in pfl deletion strains
  grown in MTC-6 supplemented with additional lipoic acid. EC numbers represent enzymes
  responsible for catalyzing that reaction. In T. saccharolyticum, formate tetrahydrofolate
  ligase (EC 6.3.4.3) is encoded by Tsac_0941.
