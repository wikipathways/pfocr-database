caption: Pathways regulating cellular senescence and the SASP. The SASP is the most
  relevant phenotypic program in senescent cells. NF-κB is a central positive regulator
  of the SASP. On one hand, ROS and DAN damage can active cGAS/STING signal pathway
  and GATA4 signal pathway, thereby positively facilitating NF-κB and the SASP. On
  the other hand, SIRT1 serve as a negative regulator of the SASP. SIRT1 not only
  inhibit NF-κB but also suppress a series of transcription factors, such as STAT3,
  p53, forkhead transcription factor (FOXO). TNF-α can induce the SASP through activating
  JAK/STAT signal pathway. Autophagy inhibit the SASP, mTOR signal pathway represses
  autophagy. Oppositely, AMPK inhibit the SASP via promoting autophagy and activating
  SIRT1. Otherwise, NRF2 can repress the SASP by decreasing ROS.
