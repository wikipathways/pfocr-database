caption: AKT/mTOR signaling and crosstalk with glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative
  phosphorylation. Glucose is transported into the cells using GLUT transporters.
  Glycolysis uses glucose to make pyruvate, which can be converted to lactate, or
  used to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation
  occurs in the mitochondria. The process converts pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA),
  and uses the tricarboxylic-acid (TCA) cycle to produce free electrons (e-) that
  are carried by NADH to the electron-transport chain, resulting in a movement of
  protons (H+) out of the mitochondrial matrix to establish a electrochemical potential
  that cumulates in the activation of ATP synthase to synthesize ATP. AKT/mTOR signaling
  interacts with these metabolic processes through the regulation of GLUT transport.
  Moreover, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α) is a downstream effector of mTORC1
  that is important in upregulating the expression of hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase
  M2, two key rate-limiting enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. Another mechanism downstream
  of mTORC2 is mediated by cMYC, which activates heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins
  (hnRNPs) in the transcription of pyruvate kinase M2.
