caption: The Innate acute phase pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF, together
  with TGF beta promote the development of IL-17 secreting cells. IL-17A potentiates
  neutrophil responses that contribute to tissue injury through ROS production, while
  increasing TGF-beta receptor expression on fibroblasts that facilitates ECM production
  in response to TGF-beta. TGF-beta, activated locally through integrin-mediated mechanisms,
  serves as a key driver of fibrosis. A second and distinct cytokine-mediated pathway
  that can promote fibrosis independently of TGF-beta is the type-2 cytokine axis.
  Here, the alarmin cytokines IL-25, IL-35, and TSLP, secreted by epithelial cells
  and other damaged tissues drives the expansion and activation of type-2 innate lymphoid
  cells (ILC2) that secrete large amounts of IL-5 and IL-13. IL-5 in turn drives the
  recruitment and activation of local tissue eosinophils, which provide an additional
  source of type 2 cytokines and other pro-fibrotic mediators. IL-13, derived from
  eosinophils, CD4+ Th2 cells, and ILC2s exhibits potent pro-fibrotic activity that
  is TGF-beta independent. Finally, the cytokine IL-11, produced by activated myofibroblasts
  has been found to stimulate ECM production by myofibroblasts in response to multiple
  pro-fibrotic mediators, including TGF beta and IL-13.
