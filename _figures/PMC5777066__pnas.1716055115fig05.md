caption: Model for the interaction of L. monocytogenes with the host autophagy machinery
  during macrophage infection. L. monocytogenes is targeted sequentially by distinct
  autophagic processes during its intracellular life cycle. () LLO triggers lipidation
  of LC3 on the Listeria-containing vacuole through a process independent of the ULK
  complex. () Bacteria that expressed ActA and PLCs interfere with autophagy and proliferate
  in the host cytosol. () During escape from the phagolysosomal pathway, L. monocytogenes
  might associate with a ruptured vacuole or membrane remnants, which are marked by
  galectins (Gal) and ubiquitin (Ub) chains, and recruit autophagy adaptors (e.g.,
  p62 and NDP52). Once in the cytosol, L. monocytogenes can also directly associate
  with Ub and autophagy adaptors (e.g., p62). () Autophagy adaptors mediate the engulfment
  of bacteria through xenophagy, a process that requires the ULK complex. Not represented
  on this model is the possibility that L. monocytogene-containing autophagosomes
  are damaged by LLO and retargeted by the autophagy machinery.
