caption: Capecitabine and Tegafur are converted to 5-FU by thymidine-phosphorylase
  (TP) and CYP2A6. 1–5% of 5-FU is transformed into cytotoxic metabolites fluorodeoxyuridine-monophosphate
  (FdUMP), fluorodeoxyuridine-diphosphate (FdUDP), fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate
  (FdUTP) and fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). 5-FU is directly transformed to fluoridine
  monophosphate (FUMP) by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT), or indirectly
  through fluorouridine (FUR) by uridine phosphorylase (UP) and uridine kinase (UK).
  FUMP is then phosphorylated to fluorouridine diphosphate (FUDP), which is phosphorylated
  to fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). FUDP can also by converted to fluorodeoxyuridine
  diphosphate (FdUDP) by ribonucleotide reductase (RR). In an alternative activation
  pathway 5-FU is converted to fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) by thymidine phosphorylase.
  FUDR is the converted through thymidine phosphate in fluorodeoxyridine monophosphate
  (FdUMP), which is phosphorylated to fluorodeoxyuridine diphosphate (FdUDP), which
  is phosphorylated to fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (FdUTP). 80% of the 5-FU is
  catabolized by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase into the non-cytotoxic metabolites
  5-fluoro-5,6-dihydrouracil (DHFU), which is then converted to fluoro-beta-ureidopropionate
  (FUPA) and fluoro-beta-alanine (FUBA), which are eliminated through urine.
