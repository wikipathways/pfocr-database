caption: Model of DP dependent regulation of Cx43 phosphorylation and degradation.
  (A) Loss of DP leads to elevated Ras gene expression that results in elevated Ras
  activation. Activation of the Ras signaling pathway leads to increased p-ERK1/2–MAPK
  levels that in turn phosphorylate Cx43 at S279/282. N-Cad, N-Cadherin; β-Cat, β-catenin;
  αT, αT-catenin; αE, αE-catenin; Dsg, Desmoglein; Dsc, Desmocollin. (B) Loss of DP
  also results in increased ubiquitination of Cx43. Cx43 is subsequently targeted
  for degradation via a lysosomal pathway. Ub, Ubiquitin.
