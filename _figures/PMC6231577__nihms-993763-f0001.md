caption: Effect of radiotherapy on DNA repair, mitochondrial function, cellular ROS,
  and EMT. IR initially causes ionization and excitation of water, leading directly
  and indirectly to the formation of free radicals. (A) Signaling of IR-induced DNA
  damage and repair. DNA can either be damaged directly by IR or indirectly through
  radiation-induced free radicals, which causes radical base formation, SSBs, DSBs,
  and DNA damage. (B) Signaling pathway of IR-induced modification of mitochondrial
  function. IR induces mitochondrial leakage of electrons, which interact with 0 2
  to generate ROS. ROS can travel into the nucleus to cause DNA damage and G2M arrest
  and activate EMT signaling or to the cytoplasm to activate growth signaling and
  other cellular responses. Up-regulation of the mitochondrial content and mitochondrial
  OXPHOS subsequently leads to amplification of mitochondrial ROS and ATP production.
  (C) Signaling pathway of IR-induced cellular responses. Other cellular responses,
  including activation of ROS-generating enzymes, antioxidant proteins, growth/autophagy
  signaling, and chaperone proteins, are activated to contest IR-mediated cell death.
  (D) Signaling IR-induced EMT. ROS are implicated in IR-induced EMT via activation
  of signaling pathways (i.e., TGF-β, Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, and EGFR/PI3K/Akt), which
  in turn activate transcription factors (i.e., Snail, Twist, and ZEB1) and induce
  a loss of epithelial morphology.
