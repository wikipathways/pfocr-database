caption: Presence of co-expressed genes of ANGPTL8 in the ANGPTL8 Regulatory Pathway
  (pathway id:WP3915 (www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP3915)). Thirteen genes in the
  ANGPTL8 regulatory pathway which are also identified to be co-expressed with it
  are marked with red color. These genes (MAPK8, CYP3A4, PIK3R2, PIK3R4, PRKAB2, ANGPTL8,
  G6PC, MAP3K11, FLOT1, PIK3C2G, SHC1, SLC16A2, RAPGEF1) belong to different signaling
  arms of the pathway. Among these genes, SHC1 and PIK3C2G are also identified as
  hub genes.
