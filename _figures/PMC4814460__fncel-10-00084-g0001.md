caption: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) candidate genes cluster into functional networks,
  and the two most prominent are synapse structure/function and protein translational
  control. The Reelin-signaling pathway intersects both of these networks. Reelin
  binds its receptors ApoER2 and very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR). The
  adapter protein Dab1 binds the cytoplasmic NPXY motif of the receptors and is phosphorylated
  by Src family kinases. This reciprocally activates Src, which leads to phosphorylation
  of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) as well as downstream AKT/PI3K signaling that intersects
  the mTOR pathway.
