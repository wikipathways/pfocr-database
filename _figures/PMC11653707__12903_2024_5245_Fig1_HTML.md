caption: Role of mTOR signaling in activating TME cells. This image illustrates the
  activation of TME cells via mTOR signaling pathway emphasising importance of mTOR
  in cancer progression and development. a it depicts that growth factors or high
  energy levels involve in dimerization of RTK receptor in-turn recruit PI3K thereby
  phosphorylating PIP2 to PIP3. This results in the activation of AKT by PDK1. It
  promotes function of mTORC1. AKT also negatively modulated by TSC with phosphorylation
  of RHEB-GDP to RHEB-GTP. Activated mTOR in TME initiates expression of PD-L1 in
  T cells which causes decrease in T-cell based immune function in cancer cells. Additionally,
  mTOR also promotes differentiation of T cells to Tregs leading to immunosuppression
  and cancer progression. b Receptor-ligand binding occur in CAF, recruits PI3K which
  can promote cascade of PIP2 to PIP3 thereby activating mTOR by PDK1/AKT. mTOR is
  then transferred to nuclei following with differentiation of CAF. CAF derived chemokines
  and cytokines binds to the receptor in cancer cell promoting PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade
  which regulates cell proliferation, progression of cancer. c TME is mainly composed
  of M2 type of macrophages. Polarization of M1 and M2 have distinct activating mechanism
  where this depicts only M2 mechanism. Polarization of M2 occurs through binding
  of Type I- IL-4 to JAK/STAT receptor thereby activating IRSs which cannot be translocated
  to nucleus induces PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and trigger gene expression that promotes
  macrophage activation. In contrast STAT3 can also be produced which has ability
  to translocate itself into nucleus and induce macrophage activation (www.biorender.com)
