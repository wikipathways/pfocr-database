caption: 'Provitamin A biosynthesis. Enzymes involved in its biosynthesis are marked
  in blue. Connections to other vitamin pathways are indicated in red. Filled yellow
  boxes indicate the external influences on the biosynthesis, affected enzymes surrounded
  by a yellow square. The regulatory influences on DXS are derived from studies on
  Arabidopsis (), those on PSY from studies in maize, rice and tomato (; ). Cofactors
  are encircled in gray. Abbreviations (in order of appearance in the pathway): G3P,
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; DXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phospate;
  DXR, DXP reductoisomerase; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; IDI, isopentenyl
  diphosphate isomerase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GGPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  synthase; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; PSY, phytoene synthase; PDS, phytoene
  desaturase; ZISO, ζ-carotene isomerase; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase; CRTISO, carotene
  isomerase; β-LCY, lycopene-β-cyclase;     -LCY, lycopene-    -cyclase; BCH1, β-carotene
  hydroxylase; ZEP1, zeaxanthin epoxidase; VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase; AsA, ascorbate.'
