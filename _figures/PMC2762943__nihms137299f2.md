caption: 'The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) pathway. Rb is the main downstream
  effector of p53 in the control of G1 arrest. This Rb function depends on the level
  of phosphorylation of Rb, which is achieved by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 2
  and 4 in complex with either cyclin E or cyclin D1. These kinases complexes are
  retro-controlled by the following CDK inhibitors: p21 (the transcriptional target
  of p53), p16 (INK4β) and p27 (kip1). Phosphorylated Rb releases E2F1 from binding
  to Rb, which allows E2F1 transcriptional activities on S-phases genes target and
  disrupt the G1 checkpoint. Loss of functional CDK inhibitors p53, activation/gain
  of cyclin D1 or cyclin E, and Rb loss all result in E2F1 activation and disruption
  of the G1 checkpoint.'
