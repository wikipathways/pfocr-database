caption: An overview of sphingolipid metabolic pathways, according to Merrill and
  Maceyka and Spiegel. The synthesis of ceramide begins with the condensation reaction
  of serine and palmitoyl‐CoA to form 3‐ketosphinganine. Along the de novo synthesis
  pathway (red), 3‐ketosphinganine is reduced to sphinganine. Sphinganine is coupled
  with fatty acyl‐CoA to form dihydroceramide, and a double bond is added on dihydroceramide
  to form ceramide. Ceramide is the central hub of the sphingolipid metabolism, which
  can be modified into sphingomyelin through the sphingomyelinase pathway (blue) and
  can be modified into glycosphingolipids or phosphorated sphingolipids through the
  salvage pathway (green). Double‐headed arrows indicate a reversible reaction
