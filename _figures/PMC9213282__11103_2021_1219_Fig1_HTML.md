caption: Molecular mechanisms regulating endophyte-mediated rice responses to salt
  stress. The salt stress signal is perceived by various signal transduction sensors
  transducing the signal along different pathways into the cell. These sensors include
  membrane-associated kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, glutamate receptor-like
  channels, calmodulin binding receptors, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, and Ca2+
  channel opening (Jamla and Archak ). Endophytes target different components in this
  signalling system during salt stress in the rice cell. They modulate either phytohormone-
  such as auxin, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) (Liu et al. ; Khan et al. ; Sultana
  et al. ), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-, or Ca2+-signalling (through
  calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK)) pathways (Jaemsaeng et al. ; Chauhan et
  al. ), which transduce the signal into the cell to modulate the expression of transcription
  factors (TFs) such as ethylene responsive factor (ERF), dehydration-responsive element-binding
  2 (DREB2), NAC (NAM, ATAF and CUC), auxin response factor (ARF), and myeloblastosis
  (MYB). These TFs in turn induce salt-responsive genes (for each case, only representative
  genes are shown) such as Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1) and Sodium/Hydrogen eXchanger
  1 (NHX1) for ion-homeostasis, Betaine Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (BADH) for osmotic
  adjustment, and CATALASE b (CATb) for antioxidation (Nautiyal et al. ; Ji et al.
  ). They can also target Ca2+-signalling pathway (through calmodulin, CaM1-1) leading
  to the SOS pathway-mediated ion-homeostasis in the rice cell by activating plasma
  membrane-bound SOS1 and vacuolar NHX1 (Jaemsaeng et al. ) proteins. Endophytes also
  induce the expression of various salt-responsive miRNAs which can regulate these
  TFs and structural genes like SOS1 and high-affinity K+transporter 1 (HKT1) (Kord
  et al. ), supporting the existence of crosstalk between signalling pathways, conferring
  enhanced salt tolerance in rice. Dashed arrows indicate possible mechanisms. Blue
  arrows along the pathway from MAPK through ERF indicate endophyte-mediated pathway
  downregulation
