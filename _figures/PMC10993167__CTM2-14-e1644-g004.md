caption: The related regulators of N6‐methyladenosine (m6A), 5‐methylcytosine (m5C)
  and N7‐methylguanosine (m7G) are involved in the signalling pathways of drug resistance
  during tumour treatment. The JAK/STAT3 signalling pathway is the downstream pathway
  of cytokine signalling, which regulates cell development, differentiation, proliferation,
  apoptosis, etc. It not only participates in the regulation of normal physiological
  processes, but also plays an important role in the occurrence and development of
  tumours. PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is also one of the important signal transduction
  pathways in cells, and its main role is to inhibit cell apoptosis and promote proliferation.
  PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is abnormally regulated in a variety of malignant tumours,
  and then promotes tumour cell proliferation and neovascularisation, inhibits cell
  apoptosis, and is closely related to tumour invasion and metastasis
