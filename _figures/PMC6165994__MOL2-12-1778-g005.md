caption: (A) Nucleotide metabolism pathway. The heatmap shows the mean of the log‐transformed
  tumor/normal ratios for metabolites in AC (orange) and squamous cell cancer (blue).
  Increase (red) or decrease (green) in metabolite level. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and
  ***P < 0.001. (B) PLS‐DA obtained for AC and SCC tissues using significant nucleotides
  and metabolites between normal and cancerous tissue. The datasets included those
  metabolites that were statistically significant in AC and SCC compared with normal
  tissue (37 and 61 metabolites for AC and SCC, respectively). The third PLS‐DA was
  obtained using the fold change value of each metabolite between normal and cancerous
  tissue in order to compare both types of carcinomas. For this purpose, we only considered
  those metabolites that were commonly altered in AC and SCC cases compared with normal
  tissue (34 metabolites). (C) Top 10 nucleotides and derivatives ranked by their
  discriminatory capability (expressed as mean decrease accuracy) provided by random
  forest analysis for AC and SCC cases.
