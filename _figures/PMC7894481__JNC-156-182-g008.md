caption: Scheme representing the effect of FGF2 on the activity of connexin hemichannels
  and consequences on ATP release and proliferation of cultured tanycytes. 1) FGF2
  induces proliferation of cultured tanycytes via activation of FGFR1, leading to
  2) increase connexin43 hemichannel (Cx43 HC) opening, and 3) ATP release via Cx43
  HCs. ATP through autocrine signaling could activate 4a) P2Y1 located in the tanycytes
  for inducing [Ca2+]i increases, which could mediate 5a) tanycyte proliferation.
  In addition, P2Y 2,4,11,12, and 13 receptors located in tanycytes and the adenosine
  receptor P1A could potentiate these effects. Another action that could be attributed
  to ATP released by the tanycytes, is the 4b) paracrine activation of P2X4R in NPY
  neurons that release GABA
