caption: A Defective degradation of GAGs in lysosomes leads to a decline in autophagy
  flux and a consequent increased accumulation of LAMP-2. Furthermore, excessive extracellular
  storage of GAGs results in an increased accumulation of HSPGs on the cell membrane.
  The excessive GAG chains on HSPGs in MPS II neurons may sequester specific ligands
  (such as Wnts and growth factors), thereby depressing the activation of Wnt and
  RTK receptors. The decrease in Wnt receptor-mediated signaling enhances GSK-3β activity.
  This, in turn, suppresses autophagy flux, promotes tau aggregation, and elevates
  intracellular calcium concentration via activation of the expression of selective
  genes that encode calcium channels. Additionally, it inhibits β-catenin/TCF-regulated
  gene expression (e.g., AXIN2, MMP7, and NEFL). On the other hand, reduced RTK signaling
  diminishes the active (phosphorylated) form of p38 MAPK and its nuclear translocation,
  thereby reducing both p38 MAPK-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation on GSK-3β and
  p38 MAPK-activated gene expression (such as FOSL1 and genes encoding selected ion
  channels, e.g., SCN9A). The width of the arrows indicates the relative strength
  of regulation, and the dashed lines indicate decreased levels of nuclear translocation.
  Genes regulated by both p38 MAPK and β-catenin/TCF are denoted in blue font. B Decreased
  p38 MAPK and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in MPS II neurons may lead to abnormal AP
  via ion channel gene dysregulation (e.g., SCN9A, KCNMB2, and KCND2). Tideglusib
  treatment restores the expression of these genes and mitigates the AP anomalies
  of MPS II neurons. Red arrows indicate increased expression; blue arrows indicate
  decreased expression
