caption: 'The main suggested cellular functions for AHNAK2.: (a) AHNAK2 was found
  to colocalise with vinculin and AHNAK at skeletal muscle costameres, linking the
  Z-disk to the costamere, which anchors the active unit of skeletal muscle, the sarcomere,
  to the sarcolemma (cell membrane); (b) FGF1 (fibroblast growth factor-1) is a non-classically
  released growth factor and signalling protein usually stimulated by stress, such
  as hypoxia and heat shock. AHNAK2s C-terminal was found to precipitate and translocate
  with FGF1 and F-actin at the cell membrane during heat-shock in murine cells; (c)
  clear cell renal carcinoma immortalised cell-lines (CAKI-1) have an HIF-1α- and
  AHNAK2-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition in hypoxic environments (1%
  O2); (d) X-ray diffraction of the PDZ domains of both periaxin and AHNAK2 provides
  a structural basis for the homodimerization of both homologues; and (e) knockdown
  of AHNAK2 in uveal melanoma immortalised cell-lines (M17, SP6.5) caused down-regulation
  of the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is linked to controlling metabolism, proliferation,
  growth, and survival in cancer.'
