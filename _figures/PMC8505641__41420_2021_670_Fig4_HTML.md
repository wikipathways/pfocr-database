caption: In response to hypoxia, cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing
  miRNAs, which regulate inflammatory signals. These signals can be detected by specific
  recognition receptors, thus altering the state of inflammation by affecting the
  associated signaling pathways and their downstream immune cell activation. MiR-223
  can inhibit classical pro-inflammatory pathways through NF-κB and STAT3 pathway
  and enhances anti-inflammatory responses. It can suppress inflammation via inhibition
  of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Under hypoxia conditions, the expression of miR-223
  was downregulated and the anti-inflammatory effect was weakened. miR-23a-enriched
  exosomes mediated via HIF-1α that activate proinflammatory macrophages by inhibiting
  A20 target to NF-κB. It also can suppress reactive oxidative stress (ROS) and curbs
  necrosis by targeting peptidylprolyl isomerase F (PPIF). MiR-23a is essential for
  the proliferation of effector CD4+T cells and prevent tissue necrosis caused by
  ROS. MiR-21 plays an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting NF-κB and PDCD4/caspase-3
  pathway. Conversely, miR-21 also participates in the positive feedback loop of inflammation
  through the inflammatory signals of NF-κB and STAT3 factor in tumor cells.
