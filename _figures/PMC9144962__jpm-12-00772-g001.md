caption: 'The role of EVs in immune escape of RCC; (?)—potential immunosuppressive
  mechanism not confirmed in the context of RCC-derived EVs but described in other
  cancer types. RCC cancer cells secrete small EVs (sEV) through the endocytic pathway
  or large EVs (lEVs) by membrane blebbing (1.). EVs inhibit T-cell proliferation
  and induce apoptosis by delivering FasL, cause T-cell exhaustion and apoptosis through
  CD70, and inhibit T-cell function by creating an acidic microenvironment through
  the enzyme CA9 and through the delivery of CD147 or PD-L1. EV-associated miR-23a
  represses through the transcription factor BLIMP-1, CD8+ T lymphocyte cytotoxicity,
  and effector cell differentiation (2.). EVs block monocyte differentiation and maturation
  by delivery of HLA-G. (3.). EVs induce the suppressive activity of MDSCs by Hsp70-related
  p-Stat3 activation EV-delivered miR-210 up- regulates MDSC suppressor function by
  increasing arginase activity and NO production (4.). EVs cause dysfunction of NK
  cells by delivery of TGF-B1, which induces the TGF-β/SMAD pathway. EV-associated
  miR-23a suppresses NK function by blocking the expression of CD107a and EV-delivered
  miR-183 binds and represses DAP12, an important signal adaptor required for proper
  NK cytotoxic activity (5.). Hypoxia induces overexpression of miR-210 in RCC cancer
  cells, which downregulates PTPN1, HOXA1, and TP53I11 genes and decreases susceptibility
  to cytotoxic T-cell lysis (6.). Created with BioRender. Abbreviations: BLIMP-1-B
