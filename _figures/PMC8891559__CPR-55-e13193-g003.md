caption: Relationship between necroptosis and alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Excessive
  alcohol consumption causes hepatic necroptosis, featured by increased expression
  of RIPK1 and RIPK3, which aggravates liver injury, steatosis and inflammation, eventually
  resulting in ALD. Elevated RIPK3 expression following alcohol exposure contributes
  to necroptosis, steatosis and mitochondrial ROS production, and RIPK1 activity is
  required for alcohol‐induced hepatic inflammation. Alcohol‐induced decreased expression
  of proteasome subunit α‐2 (PSMA2) and proteasome 26S subunit ATPase 1 (PSMC1) may
  lead to the hepatic accumulation of RIPK3. Furthermore, cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1)
  has been implicated as the upstream of RIPK3, while c‐jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK)
  acts as the downstream of RIPK3. O‐GlcNAc transferase (OGT) negatively regulates
  necroptosis via reducing the protein stability and expression of RIPK3. In addition,
  nuclear factor (erythroid‐derived 2)‐like 2 (Nrf2) pathway ameliorates alcohol‐induced
  liver injury by inhibiting necroptosis
