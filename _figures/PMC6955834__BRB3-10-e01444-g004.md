caption: Schematic diagram of intermittent fasting‐mediated pathways that induce adult
  hippocampal neurogenesis. Intermittent fasting was shown to activate the Notch 1
  signaling pathway, which caused the transcription factor, HES5, to induce an upregulation
  of Nestin, a marker of neuronal stem cells that led to increased neurogenesis. In
  addition, intermittent fasting was shown to activate the CREB signaling pathway,
  which caused an upregulation of neurotrophic factor, BDNF, that led to increased
  levels of Nestin and neurogenesis. BDNF, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor; CREB,
  cAMP response element‐binding protein; NeuN, neuronal nuclei
