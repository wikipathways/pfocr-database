caption: Bile acid signalling within the enterocyte. Bile acids are formed from the
  breakdown of cholesterol via the CYP7A1 enzyme. Bile acids are then transported
  from the liver through the bile salt export pump (BSEP). They will then travel via
  the biliary tree to the gallbladder for storage. After a meal, bile acids are then
  ejected into the small intestine where they are actively absorbed into the brush
  border of the terminal ileal epithelial cell through the apical bile acid transporter
  (ASBT). In the cytoplasm of the enterocyte, bile acids bind to the ileal bile acid
  binding protein (IBABP) and then are excreted via the basolateral heterodimeric
  protein OST alpha and beta. Bile acids enter the portal venous circulation and return
  to the liver via the Na+-taurocholate polypeptide (NTCP). In the enterocyte and
  hepatocyte, bile acids will bind to FXR-activating FGF19 and SHP. These proteins
  will then travel to the liver to create a negative feedback pathway and inhibit
  further bile acid synthesis (image created by https://www.biorender.com).
