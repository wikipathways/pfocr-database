caption: Panel A shows normal physiological function of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and
  regulation of LPL by gene products of ANGPTL4, APOC3, and APOA5. LPL, which is both
  transported across and anchored to capillary endothelial cells by the protein GPIHBP1,
  normally hydrolyzes the triglycerides that are present in circulating lipoproteins
  and reduces the plasma triglyceride level. Its activity is reduced by ANGPTL4 and
  APOC3 and increased by APOA5. Not shown here are other important regulators of LPL
  activity, including APOC2 and ANGPTL3. Green arrows indicate enhancers, and red
  blocked arrows indicate inhibitors. IDL denotes intermediate-density lipoprotein,
  and VLDL very-low-density lipoprotein. Panel B shows altered function of LPL in
  mutation carriers. Mutations affecting LPL and proteins interacting with LPL are
  shown, along with expected effect on LPL activity, plasma triglyceride levels, and
  risk of coronary artery disease. LPL loss of function refers to p.D36N, and gain
  of function refers to p.S477* (see ). ANGPTL4 loss of function refers to both p.E40K
  and loss-of-function mutations (). APOC3, and APOA5 loss of function refers to multiple
  loss-of-function mutations.
