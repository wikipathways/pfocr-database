caption: 'The complement system: an overview. Classical pathway (CP): C1q, the CP
  initiator, recognizes and binds antigen-antibody complexes or specific molecules,
  including β-amyloid, C reactive protein (CRP), DNA and apoptotic bodies. After binding,
  the C1r and C1s proteases subsequently cleave C4 and C2 to generate C4a, C4b, C2a,
  C2b, permitting the formation of C4b2a (CP C3 convertase). This complex cleaves
  C3 into C3a, which, in turn, acts as potent anaphylatoxin, and C3b that binds to
  the complex forming the C4b2a3b protein block (CP C5 convertase). Lectin pathway
  (LP): MBL, ficolin-1, ficolin-2, ficolin-3 and collectin-11, the LP initiators,
  recognize and bind high-density arrays of mannose, fucose and N-acetylated sugars
  exposed by pathogens or by self-altered cells. After binding, the MBL-associated
  serine proteases (MASPs), MASP-1 and -2, associated in complex with the above recognition
  molecules (MBL/ficolins), cleave C4 and C2, thereby forming C3 convertase and C5
  convertase in a similar manner to that of the CP (Ehrnthaller et al., ). The role
  of the third serine protease, called MASP-3, remains unclear (Kjaer et al., ). Alternative
  pathway (AP): the activation of the AP is driven by a spontaneous hydrolysis of
  circulating C3 (called tick-over process) to form C3(H2O). This molecule then associates
  factor B and factor D to form C3bBb (AP C3 convertase). Similar to the C3 convertase
  generated in the CP and LP, this complex splits C3 into C3a and C3b, with the latter
  creating a new C3 convertase (AP amplification loop, dotted line), and/or binding
  C3 convertase already present to create the C3bBb3b complex (AP C5 convertase).
  Extrinsic pathway: the recent characterization of this activation pathway suggests
  that it is driven by activated proteolytic enzymes, including thrombin, plasmin,
  kallikrein, factor XIIa. Thrombin possesses its own C5 convertase activity and,
  under undefined conditions, has been shown to have the capacity to directly cleave
  C5 to generate the correspondent active fragments (Huber-Lang et al., ). Recently,
  it has been shown that the coagulation serine proteases are likewise able to cleave
  C3 (Markiewski et al., ; Amara et al., ). Terminal pathway: CP, AP, LP and the extrinsic
  pathway all converge at C5 convertase formation, activating a common cascade through
  the cleavage of C5 into the anaphylatoxin C5a and the active C5b. Finally, (1) C3b
  fragment binds the targeted cell allowing the assembly of C6, C7, C8 and C9 in a
  pore called membrane attack complex (C5b-9 or MAC), that causes the direct lysis
  of the cell; (2) many fragments, such as C3b and C4b as well as C5b, work as opsonins
  triggering an overactivation of the phagocytic response; (3) altogether complement
  components are able to orchestrate an adaptative immune reaction by communicating
  with multiple immune cells (Ricklin and Lambris, ) through different receptors,
  leading to a robust local and systemic inflammatory response.'
