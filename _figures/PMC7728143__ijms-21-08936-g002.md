caption: Tissue homeostasis requires a fine balance of matrix production and breakdown.
  Yet when the balance breaks, here due to somatic mutations in one of two genes (i.e.,
  PKD1 or PKD2, collectively referred to as PKD), there is an observed increased proliferation
  of matrix producing cells (e.g., myofibroblasts and Mφ), leading to excess ECM synthesis.
  To make matters worse in rodent models of PKD and also in people suffering with
  this condition, elevated levels of TIMPs have been identified. TIMPs inhibit the
  activity of the molecules that break down matrix (MMPs), further contributing to
  the establishment of fibrosis, which ultimately leads to organ failure. On the contrary,
  in the healthy kidney, there is both a lower rate of ECM production and also a tightly
  controlled ECM breakdown pathway.
