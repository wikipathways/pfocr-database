caption: The signaling pathway of NEK10 and NEK11 upon DNA damage. NEK10 assembles
  in a ternary complex with RAF-1 and MEK1 and mediates ERK1/2 activation, playing
  a role in the maintenance of the G2/M checkpoint after UV light irradiation. Upon
  Cisplatin and IR treatments, NEK10 phosphorylates p53 at Y327, increasing p21 levels.
  p21 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that suppresses the cell cycle G1/S phase.
  NEK10 participates in the control of cell cycle progression through p53 phosphorylation.
  Upon DNA damage, NEK11 is involved with ATM/ATR checkpoint pathway. Degradation
  of CDC25A is regulated by NEK11 through the phosphorylation of S82 and S88 of CDC25A,
  in vivo. CHK1 is responsible for phosphorylating NEK11 at the S273 site in vitro.
