caption: Pyruvate metabolism during disease. Rendering of the KEGG pathway of pyruvate
  metabolism annotated with the DE transcripts and the microbial complexes from which
  they originate. Differential expression is represented by the black rectangle around
  the KEGG Orthology term. Background color for the KEGG orthology term represents
  the microbial complex of the organism that showed differential expression. The pathway
  as a whole is up-regulated, but the individual genes are up-regulated in diverse
  species supporting polymicrobial synergy during periodontitis.
