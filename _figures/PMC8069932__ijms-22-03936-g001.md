caption: 'Proposed model for the multilayered regulation of dark-induced senescence
  (DIS) and possible signaling-mediated pathways: DIS could be redundancy-regulated
  within overlapped pathways, and differentially modulated within ABA pathways as
  follows: OsONAC096 positively regulates DIS by up-regulating the ABA signaling expression
  and thus initiates senescence-associated genes (SAGs); on the contrary, OsMYB102
  negatively modulates DIS during its function; OsCYP707A6 disrupts ABA levels and
  downstream transcription factors (TFs) such as OsNAP and OsONAC096, or directly
  inhibits OsABF4, which directly targets SAGs and NYC1 (a). OsCKX11 activates irreversible
  cytokinin degradation. Mutation of OsCKX11 decreases ABA accumulation, probably
  by down-regulating the expression of OsNCED (ABA biosynthetic gene), and up-regulating
  the expression of OsABA8ox (ABA catabolic gene). Accumulated cytokinin and depressed
  ABA levels lead to the inhibition of chlorophyll degradation and maintenance of
  photosynthesis (b). Similarly, JA could modulate DIS and initiate the expression
  of OsERF101, which up-regulates the OsMYC2 expression and consequently initiates
  chlorophyll-degrading genes or is cross-talked with OsNAP, a key ABA pathway TF,
  and thus regulates the SAG expression. On the contrary, OsDOF24 negatively regulates
  DIS by inhibiting the expression of JA biosynthetic gene allene-oxide synthase1
  (OsAOS1) and results in JA level disruption, which could be an inducer for some
  other TFs such as OsERF101 and OsMYC2 (c). The ethylene-signaling pathway may also
  mediate DIS regulation during the up-regulation of OsEIL2, which functions upstream
  of OsBURP14 and OsBURP16, the members of the β subunit of polygalacturonase subfamilies,
  and thus reduces the pectin content by enhancing polygalacturonase (PG) activity
  (d).'
