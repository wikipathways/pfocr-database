caption: Schematic representation of the oBregulatory pathway in L. monocytogenes.
  (A) The repeating hexagonal subunits of the stressosome that are composed of two
  dimers of RsbR, one dimer of RsbS, and two monomers of RsbT (). It is hypothesized
  that the N-terminal turrets formed by the RsbR dimers detect stress signals, triggering
  conformational changes that propagate into the STAS domains, initiating the kinase
  activity of RsbT. This results in the phosphorylation of RsbR Thr209 and Thr175
  and RsbS Ser56, which in turn leads to the release of RsbT from the stressosome.
  (B) Free RsbT interacts with and activates the RsbU phosphatase, which acts on phosphorylated
  RsbV. Simultaneously, the anti-sigma factor RsbW that binds and prevents σB from
  interacting with the RNA polymerase (E), releases σB and preferentially interacts
  with non-phosphorylated RsbV. σB can then interact with RNA polymerase forming the
  holoenzyme EσB. Once stress is removed, RsbX dephosphorylates the stressosome (except
  for RsbR Thr175 which remains phosphorylated; ), resulting in the sequestration
  of RsbT back into the stressosome and inactivating the signal transduction.
