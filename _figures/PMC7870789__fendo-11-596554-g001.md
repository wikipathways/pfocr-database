caption: Tumorigenic mechanisms in somatotroph cells. Several mechanisms increase
  cAMP production, which is key for somatotroph tumorigenesis. Hormones bind to receptors,
  including GHRH-R, SSTR, GPR101, and GIPR, on the somatotroph cell membrane and increase
  the activation of adenylyl cyclase through Gsα. The consequent increase in cAMP
  production leads to the dissociation of the regulatory subunits of PKA from the
  catalytic subunits, which then translocate to phosphorylate CREB in the nucleus
  and other targets, leading to increased GH expression and cell proliferation. Gsα
  activation induced by GNAS mutations also leads to upregulation of the cAMP pathway.
  In addition, ectopic expression of GIPR may lead to an activated cAMP pathway, and
  GPR101 is a Gsα-coupled constitutively active receptor that leads to increased cAMP
  signaling. AIP, aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
