caption: Biosynthesis pathway of PG and PE. Synthesis of both PG and PE begins by
  converting glycerol-3-phosphate to phosphatidic acid and thence into CDP-diglyceride,
  at which point the two pathways branch. For PE, CDP-diglyceride is converted into
  phosphatidyl serine and then into PE. The PG synthetic path converts the CDP-diglyceride
  into phosphatidylglycerol phosphate and then into PG.
