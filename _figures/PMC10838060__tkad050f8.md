caption: cGAS-STING and cell senescence in diabetes. Cell senescence can be caused
  by various factors, including oxidative stress, replication fork stagnation, telomere
  damage and aging. The cGAS-STING pathway plays a crucial role in maintaining genetic
  stability and preventing tumors by detecting and responding to internal disturbances
  and external enemies. However, in certain chronic inflammatory conditions such as
  diabetic high-glucose environments, DNA damage can lead to increased cytoplasmic
  DNA, activating cGAS-STING and triggering an inflammatory response, ultimately accelerating
  cellular senescence. Several compounds, including ole, DNase 3 (also called TREX1),
  HT or curcumol, have been shown to reduce SASP production in aging cells by inhibiting
  the cGAS-STING pathway. Overall, understanding the role of cGAS-STING in cellular
  senescence and inflammation can have significant implications for developing new
  therapies for age-related diseases and chronic inflammatory conditions. RS replication
