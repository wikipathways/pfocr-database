caption: Therapeutic targets along the purine metabolic pathway. Adenosine A2A antagonists
  (including caffeine) and urate have emerged as realistic candidate neuroprotectants.
  In humans the enzymatic metabolism of purines such as adenosine ends with urate
  due to multiple mutations within the urate oxidase gene during primate evolution
  (see text). The schematic suggests a possible homeostatic mechanism linking an adenosinergic
  neurodegenerative influence with an offsetting neuroprotective influence of urate.
