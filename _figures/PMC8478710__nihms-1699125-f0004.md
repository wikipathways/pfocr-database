caption: 'Experimental design: serial sampling or isotope tracing techniques measure
  pathway activities. Sample preparation and duration of isotope labelling depend
  on the metabolites and metabolic pathways of interest. Metabolomics at a single
  time point provides static metabolite levels. Flux measurements require collection
  of samples as a function of time. Metabolite extraction: after sample harvest, near
  instantaneous enzyme inactivation is crucial to achieve a representative metabolite
  profile. Metabolite detection: metabolite extracts are subjected to chromatography-coupled
  mass spectrometry to separate metabolites based on chemical properties and m/z,
  followed by detection and quantification. Data analysis: schematic example of [1,2-13C2]glucose
  incorporation into glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). 13C-[abeWed
  carbons are depicted in red; unlabelled carbons in white. Metabolites are identified
  based on expected m/z. Absolute or relative quantification shows changes in metabolite
  levels and can reveal pathways of interest. For tracing experiments, tracer incorporation
  and pathway activity are assessed by the isotope labelling pattern. Glucose incorporation
  into glycolysis results in partially labelled lactate (M+2) whereas glucose-derived
  lactate from the PPP results in M+1 lactate. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; FACS,
  fluorescence-activated cell sorting; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; Pyr, pyruvate; R5P,
  ribose 5-phosphate; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate.'
