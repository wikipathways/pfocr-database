caption: The pathways of DNA double-strand break repair. The nonhomologous end-joining
  (NHEJ) pathway is an error-prone repair pathway that functions through the cell
  cycle. The homologous recombination pathway is an error-free repair pathway that
  requires intact homologous DNA as a repair template and is active in the later S
  and G2 phases. The alternative end-joining (a-EJ) pathway, which repairs DNA double-strand
  breaks (DSBs), is initiated by end resection that generates 3′ single strand

  in cancer.
