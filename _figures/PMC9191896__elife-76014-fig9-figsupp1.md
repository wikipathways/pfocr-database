caption: Diagram shows a likely pathway for the synthesis of the two main sex steroids
  in zebrafish, 17ß-estradiol (E2; female) and 11-ketotestosterone (male), starting
  from cholesterol. Enzymes that catalyze each step are shown, with color indicating
  sex-specific expression. For example, Cyp17a1 is expressed in both males and females,
  while Cyp19a1a and Hsd17b1 are female-specific while Hsd17b3 and Cyp11c1 are male-specific.
