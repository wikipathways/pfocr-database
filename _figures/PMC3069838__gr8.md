caption: Putative regulation of the FoxO1 pathway in response to ischemia. Ischemia
  induces metabolic stress and reduces signaling through growth factors and shear
  stress receptors. Decreased activation of Akt results in lower phosphorylation of
  FoxO1 and also lower phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, together resulting
  in reduced degradation of FoxO1 protein. Nutrient stress also may evoke signals
  that induce FoxO1 nuclear localization, where it can act as a transcriptional regulator.
  Cell cycle arrest through decreased expression of activators (cyclin D1) and enhanced
  production of inhibitors (p27Kip1) is one outcome of FoxO1 activation that may impede
  a recovering angiogenic response in muscle tissue.
