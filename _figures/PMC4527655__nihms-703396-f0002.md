caption: 'A combination of low oxygen tension and humoral mediators constrict the
  lung in-utero. The mechanisms associated with hypoxic-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction
  remain controversial, but a combination of activation of L-type Ca2+ channels, ryanodine
  receptors, rho-kinase, non-selective cation channels, and inhibition of K+ channels
  are each important in contraction of pulmonary arteries from adult animals. Pulmonary
  vascular resistance of the fetal lung is thought to be maintained at a high level
  due to increased vasoactive agonists, including elevated ET-1 levels. The high ET-1,
  released from the vascular endothelium, works through a Gq coupled receptor to activate
  a number of intracellular signaling pathways that lead to smooth muscle cell contraction
  through simultaneous activation of MLCK and inhibition of MLCP. Solid line with
  arrow: Activation pathway, Dashed line with bar: Inhibition pathway.'
