caption: Simplified metabolic pathways of acetone biosynthesis by engineered E. coli
  strain using acetate as carbon source under aerobic condition. Blue arrows represent
  acetate assimilation pathway, green arrows for acetone synthesis, orange arrows
  for futile cycle and purple arrows for tricarboxylic acid cycle. Four plasmids containing
  the acetone biosynthesis pathways were constructed and investigated

  pathway for efficient acetone biosynthesis from acetate.
