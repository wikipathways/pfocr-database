caption: 'Golgi resident proteins and membrane trafficking pathway. The main membrane
  trafficking pathways are included. Newly synthesized proteins enter the ER and are
  sorted into budding vesicles that are dependent on the COPII. Vesicles move to the
  ERGIC and forward to the CGN and the trans-Golgi cisternae. Finally, vesicles reach
  the TGN and cargos sort to their final destinations such as lysosomes, endosomes
  or the plasma membrane. Different mutation in Golgi resident proteins affect different
  membrane trafficking pathway: i) GM130, Giantin, Fukutin, Dymeclin and SCYL1BP1
  (involving anterograde trafficking); ii) COGs (involving retrograde trafficking);
  iii) TRAPPC2 and GMAP-210 (involving ER to ERGIC); iv) FGD1, ATP2C1 and ARFGEF2
  (involving TGN to plasma membrane); and v) COGs, DENND5A and BICD (involving endosome
  to TGN).'
