caption: 'Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as a multifactorial disorder. The development
  and course of IBD are affected by several factors, including genetic susceptibility
  of the host, the intestinal microbiota, other environmental factors, and the host
  immune system. In addition, these factors cross-regulate each other in multiple
  ways, as shown. IBD-associated genes are summarized by molecular pathways with genes
  belonging to the same pathway arranged next to each other in one line. Polymorphisms
  in genes specific for Crohn’s disease (CD) are shown in magenta text, whereas those
  specific for ulcerative colitis (UC) are shown in dark blue text. Genetic associations
  shared between both diseases are shown in black text. Abbreviations: HSPs, heat
  shock proteins; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
  drugs; PRR, pattern-recognition receptor; RA, retinoic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; TSLP, thymic stromal lymphopoietin.'
