caption: The metabolic pathway of NO generation. NO is generated from L-arginine to
  L-citrulline by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in some cofactors, biopterin, O2,
  nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Reduced levels of BH4 or l-arginine
  lead to uncoupling of reduced NADPH oxidation and NO synthesis, resulting in the
  generation of reactive oxygen species
