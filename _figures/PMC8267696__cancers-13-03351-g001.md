caption: 'Mitochondria: A signalling hub between life and death. (Left) Death receptor
  activation by complementary ligand binding promotes the recruitment of the adaptor
  protein FADD and subsequent recruitment, homodimerization and activation of the
  initiator caspases-8 and 10, which in turn activate executioner caspases-3 and -7
  directly to induce apoptosis; this is termed the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Amplification
  of this death signal, via the mitochondria is mediated by Caspase-8 cleavage of
  BID. tBID then drives the translocation to and oligomerisation of BAX and BAK at
  the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), where insertion results in the formation
  of pores, driving MOMP. This process of intrinsic apoptosis is finely tuned by the
  activities of pro- and anti- BH3 family members such as MCL-1, BCL-2 and BCL-XL.
  MOMP results in the release of pro-apoptotic effector proteins including SMAC (Second
  Mitochondrial-derived Activator) and Cytochrome-c which inhibits anti-apoptotic
  proteins such as XIAP (X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein) and promotes apoptosome
  formation, respectively, further activating the executioner caspases-3 and 7 and
  commitment to apoptosis. (Right) Cells uptake glucose via glucose transporters (GLUTs)
  where it enters the glycolytic cascade, a series of enzymatic reactions that ultimately
  yield ATP and NADH, terminating in pyruvate. High levels of pyruvate inhibit the
  metabolic process, and so pyruvate is either converted to Acetyl-CoA for further
  metabolism in the TCA Cycle or converted to lactate (glycolysis endpoint) which
  is exported from the cell into the extracellular space via MCT transporters. The
  TCA cycle and subsequent Electron Transport Chain (ETC) oxidises Acetyl-CoA to generate
  energy and biosynthetic intermediates to fuel lipid, amino acid and nucleotide synthesis.
  The ETC relies on an intact mitochondrial membrane potential to provide the proton
  gradient along which to transport electrons through each complex, ultimately resulting
  in the production of ATP through ATP Synthase. An important by-product from the
  ETC are reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can have widespread pro- and anti-tumourigenic
  properties. Abbreviations: FADD: Fas-Associated Death Domain, tBID: Truncated-BID,
