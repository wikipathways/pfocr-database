caption: Proposed degradation pathway of DTDP. Initial cleavage by a dihydrolipoamide
  dehydrogenase (step I) yields two molecules of 3MP, which are further oxygenated
  by a dioxygenase (step II), yielding 3SP. The latter is activated to the corresponding
  CoA thioester by SucCD (step III), as shown in the present study. The next step
  is most probably the dehydrogenation of 3-sulfinopropionyl-CoA by an acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase
  homologue (step IV) in an FAD-dependent step. The sulfur moiety of the dehydrogenation
  product, 3-sulfino-2,3-dehydropropionyl-CoA, is putatively removed by an enzymatic
  or an autocatalytic reaction. Propionyl-CoA subsequently enters the central metabolism
  via the methyl citric acid cycle.
