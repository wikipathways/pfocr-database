caption: The mechanism of the lncRNA-mediated regulation of Hippo pathway in cancer.
  (A) LncRNAs regulate the Hippo pathway through chromatin remodeling, such as FRMD6-AS2.
  (B) LncRNAs regulate the Hippo pathway through recruiting methyltransferase or EZH2,
  such as TNRC6C-AS1 and MIR100HG. (C) LncRNA promoting Hippo gene transcription through
  recruiting transcription factor, such as LINC01048. (D) LncRNAs act as ceRNAs to
  sponge specific miRNAs, such as GAS5. (E) LncRNAs interact with Hippo pathway components
  or upstream regulatory proteins to regulate their function, such as UCA1. (F) LncRNAs
  bind to proteins to control their subcellular localization, such as B4GALT1-AS1.
