caption: 'SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host cells, its pathogenicity pathways, and possible
  mechanisms of azithromycin to suppress these processes. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2
  and causes its downregulation on the cell surface. Eventually, the levels of Ang
  II increases leading to PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation by mediating angiotensin
  AT1 receptor and inducing the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such
  as IL-6. First, azithromycin prevents the binding of the virus spike to ACE2 because
  of its more affinity with the ACE2, secondly, azithromycin inhibits PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway activation and suppresses Ang II-induced inflammation and fibrosis. On the
  other hand, the other SARS-CoV-2 receptor, CD147, activates the PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway that contributes to inducing the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  Thus, azithromycin suppresses CD147-dependent inflammation through this pathway.
  The effect of azithromycin on the expression of the TMPRSS2 and CD147 and its exact
  mechanisms are not understood yet. ACE2: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; IL-6:
  interleukin-6; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2; TMPRSS2: transmembrane serine protease 2.'
