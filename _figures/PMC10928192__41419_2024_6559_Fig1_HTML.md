caption: 1 Trimeric TNF binds to TNFR1 on the cell-surface membrane of target cells
  and induces oligomerization of the receptor. 2 TRADD and RIPK1 are recruited to
  the intracellular domains of TNF/TNFR1 through their ‘death domain’. These proteins
  then recruit TRAF2/5 and cIAP1/2 to form TNF/TNFR1 complex I. 3 cIAP1/2 adds K63-linked
  ubiquitin chains to RIPK1, allowing for the recruitment of LUBAC and TAB2/3. TAB2/3
  recruits TAB1 and TAK1. TAK1 then activates the MAPK signalling pathway. 4 LUBAC
  adds M1-linked ubiquitin chains to RIPK1 and potentially generates K63/M1-linked
  hybrids. M1- and K63/M1- linked ubiquitin chains on RIPK1 allow for the recruitment
  of the IKK complex through NEMO. Recruitment of the IKK complex to TNFR1 brings
  it in proximity to TAK1, which phosphorylates and activates IKK2. 5 IKK2 phosphorylates
  IκBα, leading to its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation and liberation of
  NF-κB, thus activating the NF-κB signalling pathway
