caption: 'Overexpression of PD-L1 in hypoxic cells and the mechanism of the PD-1/PD-L1
  signalling pathway. Hypoxia can contribute both directly and indirectly to the upregulation
  of transcription factors, including HIF-1α, NF-κB, and STAT3, which act on the promoter
  of PD-L1 to regulate its expression. At the same time, the cytokines released by
  hypoxic cells or immune cells can stimulate the expression of PD-L1. In hypoxic
  cells, extracellular vesicles transporting PD-L1 on their surface are released.
  Mechanistically, the PD-1–PD-L1 complex modulates immune dysfunction by binding
  to TCRs and momentarily associating with the phosphatase SHP2. This results in the
  dephosphorylation of proximal TCR signalling molecules, such as ZAP70, and the decreased
  phosphorylation of TCR downstream signalling molecules like PLCγ1 and PKCtheta,
  similar to the role that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway plays in these processes.
  Therefore, PD-1–PD-L1 binding affects the activation, proliferation, differentiation,
  metabolism, and IL-2 production of T cells. Furthermore, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway
  promotes differentiation and development, sustaining the function of regulatory
  T cells by enhancing Foxp3 expression, inhibiting the Akt/mTOR signalling pathway,
  and attenuating the phosphorylation of ERK2. And the activation of Tregs participate
  in the PD-1–PD-L1 axis-mediated NK cells dysfunction. Abbreviations: PD-L1 programmed
  death-ligand 1, PD-1 programmed cell death protein 1, HIF-1α hypoxia-inducible factor
  1 alpha, NF-κB nuclear factor kappa B, STAT3 signal transducer and activation of
  transcription-3, TCR T cell receptor, SHP2 Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine
