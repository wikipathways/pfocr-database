caption: The capecitabine and tegafur are the oral pre-pro and pro-drug, respectively,
  which in turn converted into 5-FU, while 5-FU is directly administered as IV. In
  normal condition of DPD and TS activity, maximum drug is eliminated from body while
  minimal amount is functionally active and inhibits the DNA and RNA synthesis leading
  to cell death during cancer treatment. Patients possessing the DPD deficiency show
  grade 3–4 toxicity as maximum drug is accumulated in the body that inhibit the TYMS.
  The TYMS 2R/2R genotype has low TS level and correlated with severe fluoropyrimidines-related
  adverse events. DPD dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, UP uridine phosphorylase, UK
  uridine kinase, TK thymidine kinase, TP thymidine phosphorylase, TS thymidylate
  synthetase, OPRT orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, RNR ribonucleotide reductase,
