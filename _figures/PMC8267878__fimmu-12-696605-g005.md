caption: Suppression of cancer by IL-37. IL-37 can induce an antiangiogenic effect
  on tumor by increasing the expression of antiangiogenic factors and reducing that
  of pro-angiogenic factors, MMP 2, MMP9 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Moreover,
  IL-37 can inhibit migration and invasion of the tumor by suppressing M2 polarization
  of tumor-associated macrophages, activation of Rac1, and expression of runt related
  transcription factor 2. Furthermore, IL-37 can inhibit tumor progression by promoting
  RNA m6A methylation, secretion of CCL3 and CCL20, and anti-tumor effect of T lymphocytes
  and inhibiting Wnt5a/5b pathway and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Thus,
  IL-37 exerts inhibitory effects on tumor angiogenesis, migration and progression.
