caption: AICAR administration leads to activation of AMPK decreased tumor vessel density
  and decreased CD11b (macrophage) infiltration. Activated AMPK inhibits mTOR pathway,
  protein synthesis and cell growth. In addition, AICAR administration results in
  decreased levels of p21, which was recently found to inhibit apoptosis and promote
  cell proliferation. Overall signaling changes leads to loss of viability due to
  apoptosis, proliferation block and inhibition of tumor progression.
