caption: 'RTK and nRTK networks in H. pylori pathogenesis. (A) H. pylori expresses
  adhesins (e.g., HopQ) and secretes virulence factors (e.g., VacA) and T4SS-delivered
  effectors such as CagA or ADP-heptose for persistent colonization of the human gastric
  epithelium. Integrin stimulation leads to the activation of FAK, SFK, and c-Abl,
  which stimulate CagA phosphorylation, cytoskeleton rearrangements, and cell motility/migration.
  Injection of ADP-heptose leads to a strong NF-κB-driven inflammation. (B) c-Met
  receptors are targeted via different mechanisms: CagA can substitute Gab1 adapter
  proteins and stimulate proliferation and pro-survival signals. Furthermore, MMP-2
  and MMP-9 activities, which aid the motogenic response, are induced via c-Met-dependent
  signaling. Moreover, the sheddase ADAM10 is activated and targets the extracellular
  domain of c-Met. (C) H. pylori mediates EGFR activation and stabilizes its surface
  expression by the inhibition of its endocytosis and proteasomal degradation. (D)
  H. pylori induces JAK/STAT3 signaling during early infections, whereas the pathway
  is shut down during persistent colonization. CagA mediates the recruitment of the
  SHP2 phosphatase and prevents STAT binding via IL-R dephosphorylation. Additionally,
  H. pylori CGT facilitates cholesterol extraction from the outer cell membrane and,
  thus, disrupts lipid rafts which provide membranous signaling platforms for the
  JAK/STAT pathway. Abbr.: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; nRTK, non-receptor tyrosine
  kinase, HopQ, H. pylori outer membrane protein Q; VacA, vacuolating cytotoxin A;
  T4SS, Type IV secretion system A; CagA, cytotoxin-associated gene A; FAK, focal
  adhesion kinase; SFK, Src family kinase; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa B; MMP, matrix
  metalloprotease; ADAM10, A Disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein
