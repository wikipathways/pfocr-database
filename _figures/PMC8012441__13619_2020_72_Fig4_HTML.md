caption: The roles of Notch and Wnt signaling in zebrafish heart regeneration. During
  zebrafish heart regeneration, Notch signaling functions for CM proliferation and
  heart regeneration through a paracrine mechanism. After the amputation injury of
  zebrafish heart, Notch signaling is activated specifically in the endocardium and
  epicardium, but not in myocardial cells. Endocardial Notch signaling restrains myocardial
  Wnt pathway activation through inducing the expression of wif1 and notum1b, which
  encode two secreted Wnt antagonists, therefore promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation
  in the myocardium. The activated Notch signaling in epicardium may function in a
  similar manner to facilitate heart regeneration, which requires further exploration
  in the future
