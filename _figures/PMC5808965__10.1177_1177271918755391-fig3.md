caption: Immune evasion of ROS through antioxidant defense in cancer survival. (A)
  H2O2 generated in the matrix can oxidize biomolecules including proteins, lipid
  membrane, and DNA-generating alkoxy radical by Fenton reaction. H2O2 generated can
  be converted to HO2 by catalase, glutathione peroxidase. Glutathione exists in reduced
  form as GSH in the enzyme glutathione peroxidase and gets oxidized (GSSG) in the
  process of reduction of H2O2. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is reduced by glutathione
  reductase, which obtains its equivalents NADPH from HMP shunt. (B) Nrf2-ARE pathway
  activation takes place when cell is subjected to oxidative stress. In the cytoplasm,
  Nrf2 is constitutively bound to Keap1 form in the form of dimer—Nrf2-Keap1. During
  oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1, hence allowing the transcriptional
  factor Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus. Nrf2 in MAF family proteins binds with
  ARE-regulated genes. This activates antioxidant enzymes, pro-inflammatory response,
  and cell survival. ARE indicates antioxidant responsive element; HMP, hexose monophosphate;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species.
