caption: Metabolic pathway proposed for β‐isomer propylene glycol ether. The primary
  alcohol group of β‐isomer propylene glycol ether is majorly metabolized via the
  alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase to an alkoxy propionic acid metabolite.
  Minor pathways are proposed to be the metabolism to propylene glycol via CYP450
  enzymes, followed by the exhalation of CO2, and the formation of glucuronide and
  sulfate conjugates by uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases (UGTs) and sulfotransferases
  (SULTs); R1 = alkyl chain. Illustration created with BioRender.com. Data based on
  literature [13, 17, 18]
