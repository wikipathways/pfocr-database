caption: 'Ethanolamine utilization in Vibrio spp. a) Schematic diagram of ethanolamine
  utilization: Ethanolamine is transported into the cytoplasm by the action of transporter
  proteins EutH, eat and via passive diffusion. Ethanolamine is then broken down into
  ammonia and acetaldehyde by the EutBC complex. Ammonia is further utilized by the
  purine and amino-acid synthesis pathways. Acetaldehyde is converted into Acetyl-P
  and Acetyl-CoA by the action of EutD, EutE and EutG proteins. The microcompartment
  made up of the EutKLMNS structural proteins help sequester volatile metabolites
  like acetaldehyde and the enzymes required for ethanolamine utilization. The microcompartment
  and EutH proteins which are not present in V. alginolyticus are circled with dotted
  lines. Structural diagrams of homology models of the various enzymes are shown at
  their respective locations in the pathway. The EutB protein adopts a TIM barrel
  fold; the EutC protein adopts an anticodon-binding domain like fold while EutD,
  EutE and EutG adopt the Rossmann fold. b) Maximum likelihood evolutionary tree based
  on the EutB sequences: The branch color represents bootstrap support: green >80%
  and red <50%. The colored circle marks bacterial clades: burly wood, Alphaproteobacteria;
  chocolate, Betaproteobacteria; dark sea green, Gammaproteobacteria; corn flower
  blue, Deltaproteobacteria; cyan, Firmicutes; blue violet, Actinobacter; dark cyan,
  Acidobacter; dark olive green, Fusobacter; grey, Chlorophlexi; and dark salmon,
  Bacteroidetes. The ovals with shaded background mark the clades that contain Gammaproteobacteria.

  curve of Vibrio alginolyticus in minimal media containing ethanolamine: 25â€‰ml minimal
  media was inoculated with a 1:100 dilution of an exponentially grown culture of
  Vibrio alginolyticus strain V105. The culture was grown at 30Â°C and growth at various
  time points was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring OD600nm.'
