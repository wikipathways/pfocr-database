caption: Sometimes dysregulated expression of growth factor receptors occurs by increased
  expression, genetic translocations or genomic amplifications which can lead to activation
  of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways. Alternatively chromosomal
  translocations can occur in non-receptor kinases and other genes which result in
  activation of these pathways. Genes in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  pathways that have activating mutations detected in human cancer and proliferative
  diseases are indicated in blue ovals. Genes overexpressed in certain cancers are
  indicated in purple ovals. Tumor suppressor genes mutated in human cancer are indicated
  in red rectangles. Other key genes are indicated in green ovals. Genes inactivated
  by the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway are indicated in orange ovals. Green arrows
  indicate activating events in pathways. Blocked red arrows indicating inactivating
  events in pathway.
