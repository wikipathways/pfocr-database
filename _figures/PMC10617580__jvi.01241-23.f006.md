caption: Model of UL8-mediated stabilization of β-catenin signaling pathway. The right
  side of the model represents components of the Wnt/Frizzled-mediated activation
  of β-catenin. In the off state, β-catenin is localized in the cytoplasm bound to
  a multiprotein proteasomal destruction complex (Axin, APC) that promotes GSK3β-and
  casein kinase 1 (CK1)-mediated β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. In the
  on state, the destruction complex is disrupted in a Dishevelled (DVL)-mediated way
  upon Wnt binding to the Frizzled/LPR, and β-catenin can translocate into the nucleus.
  Activation of UL8 by secreted UL7, UL8 itself, or a currently unknown factor bypasses
  Wnt receptor activation of β-catenin signaling through recruitment of β-catenin
  and DVL2 to the plasma membrane promoting endocytic uptake, β-catenin stabilization,
  and transcriptional activation. This figure was created using BioRender.
