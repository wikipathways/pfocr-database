caption: CHMs and natural compounds suppress the progression of AS by inhibiting the
  activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Several CHMs and natural compounds suppress AS
  by regulating various signaling pathways, including the priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome
  mediated by ROS, NF-κB, and Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Meanwhile,
  many upstream regulators of NLRP3 inflammasome activation such as Nrf2/HO-1, SIRTs,
  PI3K/AKT, PKM2, microRNAs, gut microflora, and flora-associated metabolites are
  involved in the anti-AS effects of CHMs and natural products. Several formulae such
  as Qingre Huoxue Decoction contribute to the inflammatory process of AS development
  by blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway. Several compounds such as oxytocin prevent
  AS by enhancing SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome. Salvianolic
  acid A from Danshen can reduce diabetic AS by inhibiting lactic acid–dependent PKR
  phosphorylation. Saikosaponin-A may affect the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  and alleviate AS by targeting PI3K signaling
