caption: Binding of TSP1 to CD47 has a global effect upon the canonical NO pathway.
  In endothelial cells, TSP1 inhibits VEGFR2 activation through its ability to disrupt
  the constitutive interactions of CD47 with VEGFR2 (). This CD47 signal limits Akt-mediated
  phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 and alters endothelial cell calcium transients
  to prevent calmodulin-mediated activation of eNOS, thereby redundantly suppressing
  NO production stimulated by VEGF or acetylcholine. CD47 ligation also controls VEGFR2
  signaling through the PLCγ pathway and the TSAd adapter to Src that mediate NO-independent
  endothelial cell growth, migration, and permeability responses. The TSP1/CD47 signal
  also inhibits heme-dependent and hem-independent activation of the NO cellular target
  sGC in all vascular cells and T cells (). TSP1/CD47 signaling independently inhibits
  the cGMP-stimulated activation of the cGMP target cGK-1. Thus, the TSP1/CD47 axis
  is a global inhibitor of endogenous and exogenous NO, NO-pro-drugs such as nitrite
  (), and cGMP promoting drugs such as synthetic activators of sCG (YC-1, BAY 41-2272;
  (Miller et al., 2010a) and cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil).
