caption: 'Simplified representation of the oxic and anoxic pathways for D-glucose
  catabolism in E. coli. Oxic pathways are sketched to the right of the outline, and
  anoxic pathways are represented to the left along with the main fermentation metabolites
  formed (in red). The initial catabolic steps of D-glucose through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
  pathway, which are independent of the presence of O2, are indicated by a dashed
  vertical arrow. Central metabolites relevant for the production of the reduced biochemicals
  discussed in the text are shown in boldface. The double arrow representing the conversion
  of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA illustrate the activity of either the pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex (mostly under oxic conditions, right), or pyruvate-formate lyase (mostly
  under anoxic conditions, left). Secretion of fermentation metabolites and active
  H+ pumping are indicated by red arrows. Slanted arrowheads identify metabolic steps
  that are subjected to regulation by the ArcBA system (red) and/or the CreBC system
  (purple). Abbreviations are as follows: NDHI and NDHII, NADH:ubiquinone oxido-reductases
  I and II, respectively; Q, (ubi)quinone/(ubi)quinol; Cyt d and Cyt o; cytochromes
  d and o oxidases, respectively; CoA, coenzyme A; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
  Nota bene, although the TCA cycle is depicted as an entirely oxic sequence of reactions
  in this scheme, the reductive branch, active under conditions with restricted O2
  supply, produces succinate as a fermentation metabolite.'
