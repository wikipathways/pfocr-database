caption: A model for that BR negatively finely regulates JA inhibition of root growth
  in Arabidopsis. (A–D) Treatment with JA in wild type (A), coi1-2 (B), psc1 (C) and
  psc1coi1 (D). (E and F) Treatments with JA and Brz in wild type (E) and coi1-2 (F).
  (G and H) Treatments with JA and exogenous BR in wild type (G) and coi1-2 (H). Arrows
  indicate positive regulation or enhancement, whereas blunted lines indicate repression
  or negative regulation. Crosses indicate interruption or impairment. The letter
  “S” indicates substrates of SCFCOI1. Thicker arrows and blunted lines represent
  the central JA signaling pathway regulating JA inhibition of root growth. Broken
  arrows represent JA signaling pathway in which other regulators are involved. The
  intensity of gray boxes represents the degree of JA inhibition on root growth.
