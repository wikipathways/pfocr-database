caption: Diets high in specific dietary fats induce an inflammatory environment in
  the intestine that promotes intestinal tumorigenesis in genetically susceptible
  APCmin/+mice, independent of obesity and related metabolic conditions. HFD containing
  coconut or corn oil as a source of saturated fat induce complement activation with
  subsequent release of C5a. C5a in turn induces the infiltration of inflammatory
  neutrophils to the intestinal lamina propria and activate the AKT/IKK/NFκB signaling
  pathway in intestinal cells with consequent production of pro-inflammatory mediators
  such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and the proto-oncogene c-myc. Conversely, mice fed a
  HFD containing olive oil as a source of fat gained significant body weight, but
  did not promote a pro-inflammatory environment or development of polyps in the intestine.
