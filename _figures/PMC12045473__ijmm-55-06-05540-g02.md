caption: Mechanisms of chloride channel regulation in human diseases. This figure
  shows ClC-2 activates IRS-1/Akt/mTOR signaling upon downregulation in NAFLD. ClC-3
  promotes CRC development and metastasis through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  in CRC. Defects in ClC-3 promote IBD by facilitating apoptosis of intestinal epithelial
  cells and Paneth cell deletion. Overexpression of CFTR in ESCC activates the p38
  signaling pathway and inhibits CRC tumor growth. ANO1 is overexpressed in ESCC and
  HCC, and possibly through the TGF-β pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. ANO1 is
  expressed in Cajal cells and promotes gastrointestinal motility. VRACs affect p53,
  the JNK signaling pathway, regulate CD8+ T-cell immune infiltration and modulate
  the expression of genes associated with the G1/S checkpoint regulatory pathway,
  including p21, p27, E2F7, MMP1 and ITGAvα in ESCC. VRAC activates the cyclinD1/CDK2
  pathway after linkage to PKCα in HCC. PACs promote the interaction between AKT and
  ERK signaling pathways for CRC development. ClC-2, chloride channel-2; CFTR, cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; ANO1, anoctamin 1; VRACs, volume-regulated
  anion channels; PACs, proton-activated chloride channels; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty
  liver disease; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; ESCC, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma;
  CRC, colorectal cancer; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; CDK2, cyclin-dependent kinase
  2; ITGAvα, integrin αV
