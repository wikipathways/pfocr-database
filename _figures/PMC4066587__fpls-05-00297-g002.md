caption: The stomatal signaling pathway. EPF1, EPF2, and STOMAGEN/EPFL9 signals are
  received by TMM–ERf leading to transduction and the YODA–MKK–MPK cascade. Light
  regulates stomatal production via COP1 which is upstream of YODA. In stems or hypocotyls
  TMM dampens CHALf peptide binding with the ERf receptor. BR signals received by
  BRI1–BAK1 inhibit BIN2 activity. BIN2 suppresses SPCH by directly phosphorylating
  or indirectly thorough YODA or MKK4/5.
