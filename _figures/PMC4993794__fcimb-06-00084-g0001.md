caption: 'Schematic of Tarp protein mediated signaling pathways implicated in chlamydial
  entry and development. C. trachomatis Tarp harbors an N-terminal tyrosine rich repeat
  phosphorylation domain (Y, green box). Tyrosine residues are phosphorylated by members
  of the Src family kinases (SFKs) such as Src, Yes and Fyn and by other tyrosine
  kinases, Syk and Abl/Arg kinases. The actin nucleating activity of Tarp results
  from distinct G-actin binding (red box) and proline rich (blue box) oligomerization
  domains and from an Arp2/3-dependent pathway resulting from the recruitment and
  activation of host cell signaling proteins Vav2, Sos1, Eps8, Abi1, Rac1, and WAVE2.
  Tarp also harbors two F-actin binding domains (FAB 1 and 2: yellow and pink boxes)
  that are implicated in the formation of actin bundles. Phosphorylated Tarp can also
  associate with the host cell Src homology 2 domain containing protein 1 (SHC1) and
  the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which are implicated in altering the activation
  state of host signaling proteins to create a protective niche for the developing
  bacterium.'
