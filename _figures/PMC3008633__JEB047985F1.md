caption: Examples of reaction–diffusion processes in muscle. (A) O2 diffusion entails
  reversible binding with hemoglobin (Hb) or another blood pigment type, and with
  myoglobin (Mb) in some fiber types. (B) Diffusion of ATP to cellular ATPases involves
  the reversible transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to an acceptor molecule such
  as creatine (Cr) or arginine (Arg), forming the phosphagen phosphocreatine (PCr)
  or arginine phosphate (AP), respectively. Phosphagen kinases, such as creatine kinase
  (CK) or arginine kinase (AK) catalyze these reactions. (C) Ca2+ is released from
  the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) upon muscle stimulation and must diffuse to and
  bind myofibrillar troponin C (TnC) to activate contraction. Relaxation entails the
  uptake of Ca2+ into the SR, where reversible binding to calsequestrin (Cs) may occur.
  In some fiber types, parvalbumin (PA) reversibly binds Ca2+ that is in the sarcoplasm.
  In addition, ATP binds Ca2+ and may further facilitate diffusion (not shown). (D)
  Transcription and translation entails diffusive flux of nuclear products to various
  sites of action in the cell. In all cases, the red arrows indicate protein-mediated
  binding, transport or catalysis, while the black arrows indicate diffusion. The
  thickness of the arrows indicates the relative importance of the diffusive pathway.
  Dashed lines indicate that Mb and PA are not present in all fiber types.
