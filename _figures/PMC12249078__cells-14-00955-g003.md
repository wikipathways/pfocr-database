caption: 'Molecular mechanisms lead to uterine fibrosis. (A) Schematic representation
  of fibrosis progression. This illustration outlines the key cellular and molecular
  events driving fibrosis development, including excessive ECM accumulation, fibroblast
  activation, and inflammatory signaling. (B) Integrated signaling pathways involved
  in fibrosis modulation. These include: the wingless-type MMTV integration site family
  (Wnt)/β-catenin pathway which promotes fibroblast activation and ECM production.
  Evidence is currently limited to human and rodent models; bovine-specific data are
  lacking. The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, primarily
  via the suppressor of mother against decapentaplegic (Smad) cascade, plays a central
  role in fibrosis by inducing myofibroblast differentiation and collagen synthesis.
  Validated in bovine and equine endometrium. The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway contributes to cell survival, proliferation,
  and metabolic adaptations that exacerbate fibrosis. There has been no direct validation
  in cattle uterine tissue, though pathway components are conserved. Estrogen modulates
  fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, leading to Smad complex
  degradation and reduced fibrotic response. This anti-fibrotic role is supported
  by in vitro studies using bovine endometrial epithelial cells. The Hippo-Yes-associated
  protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) pathway regulates
  cellular mechanotransduction and fibrosis-related gene expression, influencing fibroblast
  activation and tissue remodeling. Established in human uterine fibroid models; not
  yet validated in bovine uterus. These pathways collectively determine the balance
  between tissue repair and fibrotic progression. Species-specific differences should
  be considered when interpreting these molecular interactions in the context of cattle
  reproduction'
