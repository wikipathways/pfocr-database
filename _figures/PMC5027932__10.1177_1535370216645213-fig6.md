caption: 'Hypothesized model showing the effect of GPEP on lipogenesis in adipocytes.
  GPEP induces differentiation of preadipocytes by activating both PPARγ and PI3K
  signaling pathways. Activation of PPARγ induces both glucose uptake and lipogenesis.
  Activation of PI3K signaling pathway by GPEP results in phosphorylation and activation
  of PKB/AKT protein that causes translocation of GLUT4 protein to plasma membrane.
  Then, GLUT4 facilitates glucose uptake in adipocytes. On the other hand, GPEP, by
  activating AMPK through phosphorylation, may help prevent adipocyte hypertrophy.
  As the main energy sensor inside the cell, AMPK induces lipolysis, thereby, preventing
  progression of small functional adipocytes to dysfunctional large adipocytes. Optimum
  health of adipocytes can be achieved by inducing adipocyte differentiation while
  preventing adipocyte hypertrophy. Functional small adipocytes can maintain energy
  balance by fat turnoverAMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; GPEP: grape powder extracted
  polyphenols; p-: phosphorylated; PI3K: phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase; PKB: protein
  kinase B; PPARγ: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; PKB/Akt: protein
  kinase B/Akt. → based on cited references,  hypothesized'
