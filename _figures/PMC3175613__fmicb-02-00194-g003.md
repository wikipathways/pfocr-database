caption: Model of proposed in vivo innate and adaptive immune responses to AAV vectors.
  (A) Within 2 h after vector injection, AAV is phagocytosed by an APC; it is unclear
  whether initial contact is through a cDC, pDC, KC, MΦ, or other cell type. Phagocytosis
  may be aided by opsonization through iC3b and complement receptor 1/2 (CR1/2). Once
  in the endosome, the virus’s genome is detected by TLR9, which subsequently activates
  the classical NF-κB pathway and interferon response genes (ISGs). TLR9i can inhibit
  both these responses, while Bay11 can block the NF-κB pathway. (B) Initiation of
  these pathways causes the APC to mature, up-regulating costimulatory molecules and
  producing pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-6, CCL5, MCP-1, and type I IFNs.
  Steroids can inhibit the inflammatory activity of these cytokines. Mature APCs also
  present capsid fragments on MHC class I and II, unless protease inhibitors are utilized
  to hinder degradation of the capsid. (C) Concurrently, AAV productively transduces
  target cells. (D) Within 9 h, the alternative NF-κB pathway is triggered in these
  cells, enhancing expression of the transgene product. Bay11 can also blockade this
  NF-κB pathway. (E) Over the course of several days, the inflammatory signals from
  internalized AAV particles and the local environment induce maturation of APCs.
  Activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway in these APCs may enhance transgene
  expression and cross-presentation, augmenting their ability to prime an adaptive
  response (involving B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells) to both the AAV capsid
  and the transgene product. (F) B cells subsequently produce antibodies against the
  capsid, inhibiting further transduction, and against the transgene product, inhibiting
  its efficacy. (G) Capsid or transgene specific CD8+ T cells recognize peptide fragments
  of either protein in class I MHC on transduced cells. Recognition prompts the CTLs
  to attack and kill the target cell. Death of a significant number of transduced
  cells can lead to a reduction or complete elimination of transgene expression. Capsid-specific
  CTL killing can be reduced by inhibiting capsid degradation in target cells with
  proteasome inhibitors.
