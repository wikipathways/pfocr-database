caption: Convergence of flagellar signaling on cyclic-di-GMP. (A) Crystal violet-based
  attachment assay showing that inactive alleles of fss genes in the developmental
  (pleD) and mechanical (dgcB and motB) pathways do not support flagellar signaling.
  Each allele is expressed from the gene’s native promoter and integrated as a single
  copy at the xylX locus. The genotype and promoter for each strain are indicated
  below the solid line. Mean values from seven biological replicates are shown with
  error bars representing the associated standard deviations. (B) Crystal violet-based
  attachment assay showing that early flagellar mutants are epistatic to late flagellar
  mutants for activation of the mechanical pathway. The ΔfliF ΔflgH strain phenocopies
  the ΔfliF strain and demonstrates that the effect of motB on adhesion requires early
  stages of flagellar assembly. Mean values from five biological replicates are shown
  with the associated standard deviations. (C) Two signaling pathways operate downstream
  of the flagellum in C. crescentus. We propose that mechanical signals are transmitted
  through the motor to activate DgcB, producing a transient burst of c-di-GMP synthesis
  that directly activates holdfast biosynthesis enzymes. Persistent filament obstruction
  activates PleD by destabilizing the motor and triggering flagellar disassembly.
  PleD activation through this mechanism is predicted to induce sustained c-di-GMP
  production and initiation of the transcriptional program that leads to stalk development.
