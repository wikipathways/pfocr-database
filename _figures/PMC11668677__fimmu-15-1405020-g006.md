caption: A summarizing figure for NA protective effect on lung tissues against the
  toxic effects of radiation. Inflammation is a key driver of radiation-induced tissue
  damage and an important biological event. In addition, macrophages showed a dynamic
  change with time after irradiation. NA can reduce the inflammatory response, inhibit
  the release of proinflammatory cytokines (Tgfb, Tnf, Arg1, Chil3,Nos2) reduce the
  phosphorylation level of the transcription factor IκBα representative of the NF-κB
  signaling pathway, regulate the changes of macrophages, and thus protect against
  radiation-induced lung injury. Tgfb, transforming growth factor-b; Tnf, tumor necrosis
  factor; Arg1, arginase 1; Chil3, chitinase-like 3; Nos2, nitric oxide synthase 2
