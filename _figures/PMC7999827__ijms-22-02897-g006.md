caption: 'Metabolism, oxidative stress and neurotoxicity pathway. Abnormal accumulation
  of Aβ plaques, loss of mitochondrial function, increased production of ROS, metal
  dyshomeostasis, and diminished antioxidant protection mechanisms are all occurring
  during the progression of AD pathophysiology. Mitochondria participate in multiple
  cellular/molecular activities, such as energy metabolism, ATP synthesis, Ca2+signaling,
  and iron (among other metals) homeostasis. Therefore, neuronal viability is greatly
  dependent on mitochondrial activity. Thus, mitochondrial deficiencies are frequently
  detected in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Since mitochondria are the
  primary source of ROS, any abnormality in the proper function of the electron transport
  chain results in damage of a number of biomolecules (i.e., proteins, lipids, nucleic
  acids). In patients with AD, Aβ accumulation is associated with impairment of mitochondrial
  activity, decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and ROS generation. As a result,
  a reduction of energy supplies is observed. In AD brains, ROS levels are significantly
  more elevated than in healthy brains. During the generation of Aβ plaques, several
  ROS species are produced; particularly, H2O2 is one of the most relevant ROS species.
  The ROS/H2O2 production further triggers production and aggregation of Aβ, which,
  in turn, can lead to ROS/H2O2 generation. Bidirectional interactions between ROS
  and Ca2+signaling pathways are typical: ROS is able to modulate cellular Ca2+signaling,
  which in turn is crucial for ROS production. Hence, increased levels of Ca2+ activate
  the enzymes responsible for the creation of ROS and free radicals. The ROS-Ca2+
  interplay participates in several pathophysiological conditions, for instance AD,
  Parkinson’s disease, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. AD patients also show altered
  homeostasis of metals, including iron, copper, or zinc, that damages the cell redox
  system and promotes oxidative load as well as an increased deposition of extracellular
  Aβ plaques. Oxidative load induces the production of elevated amounts of end-products
  of lipid peroxidation, various different oxidized proteins, and oxidative alterations
  in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Abbreviations: Aβ, amyloid beta; AD, Alzheimer’s
  disease; Ca2+, calcium; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
