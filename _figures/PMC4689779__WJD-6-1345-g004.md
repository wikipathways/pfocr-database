caption: 'Schematic representation of the endocrine loops between bone and pancreas,
  and adipose tissue. Insulin signaling stimulates the expression of osteocalcin and
  osteoblastic differentiation via inhibiting Twist2, an inhibitor of Runx2, as well
  as FoxO1, resulting in accumulation of carboxylated osteocalcin in bone matrix.
  Adiponectin also stimulates osteocalcin expression and the differentiation of osteoblasts
  via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. Both insulin and adiponectin
  activate osteoclasts and accelerate bone turnover via increasing the ratio of RANKL/OPG.
  Activated osteoclasts decarboxylate bone matrix-embedded osteocalcin, and then undercarboxylated
  osteocalcin (ucOC) is released into the circulation. UcOC stimulates the expression
  of insulin in pancreas and of adiponectin in adipose tissue. OST-PTP: Osteotesticular
  protein tyrosine phosphatase; IR: Insulin receptor.'
