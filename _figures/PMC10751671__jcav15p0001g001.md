caption: 'Schematic drawing of melanoma hallmarks critically depending on the hypoxic
  state that accompanies the growth of the tumor mass, i.e., invasion and metastasis,
  neoangiogenesis, and reprogramming energy metabolism (upper part): the increase
  in tumor mass causes a decrease of oxygen availability and upregulation of proangiogenic
  (VEGF-A) and prometastatic (MMPs) factors, under the stimulation, among others,
  of the PI3K/AKT pathway. This response, leading to pathological angiogenesis and
  metastatic spreading, is crucial for the tumor to overcome hypoxia. However, the
  new blood vessels show a chaotic and tortuous structure. Moreover, cancer cells
  modify their metabolism and use glycolysis even under aerobic conditions (“Warburg
  effect”), with consequent increased production of lactate and acidification of the
  tumor microenvironment. Effects of physical activity on melanoma invasion and metastasis,
  neoangiogenesis, and reprogramming energy metabolism (lower part): an altered expression
  of soluble factors responsible for vascular remodeling, i.e., NFAT and TSP-1, was
  observed by means of in vitro experimental conditions that mimic the increase in
  blood flow observed in vivo in association with physical exercise. Moreover, upregulation
  of VCAM-1 in endothelial cells and a significant vessel normalization were observed
  in vivo in the tumor-associated vasculature of melanoma murine models performing
  treadmill exercise, compared to sedentary control animals. The consequent reduced
  invasiveness limits metastatic spreading. Melanoma metastasis also seems to be hampered
  by mTOR mediated protective metabolic changes induced by physical activity, like
  an increase in glucose metabolism, as evidenced both in animals and in humans. Abbreviations.
