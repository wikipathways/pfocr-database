caption: Sonic Hedgehog signaling maintains proliferation/self-renewal of cerebellar
  progenitor cells. The Shh signaling cascade regulates both the Rb pathway (which
  can be bound by the PRC2 RbAp48 protein) as well as the p53 pathway via Bmi1 control
  of the p16/p19 proliferation checkpoint. Inhibition of Smoothened (Smoh) by the
  Shh receptor Patched (Ptch) results in downstream signaling in the nucleus. One
  part of the signal induces N-Myc, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin D2, whereas the other part
  activates Bmi1 via the Gli effectors. (Adapted, with permission, from , © Elsevier.)
