caption: Two major insulin signaling pathways. (i) The IRS/PI3K/Akt pathway is initiated
  by phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR). This results in the phosphorylation
  of the IRSs, increased interaction between IRSs and PI3K, and phosphorylation/activation
  of Akt. This insulin-stimulated metabolic signaling pathway is severely impaired
  by trauma and hemorrhage (TH) potentially at several steps along the pathway. (ii)
  Insulin signaling also activates the MEK/ERK pathway, which is only modestly affected
  by trauma and hemorrhage. Hashed arrows indicate possible cross signaling/effects
  of the two different pathways. Ins, insulin; IR, insulin receptor; PY, phospho-tyrosine;
  TH, trauma and hemorrhage; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IRSs, insulin receptor
  substrates; AKT, protein kinase B; MEK, mitogen activated protein kinase kinase;
  ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Grb2, growth factor binding protein
  2; Sos, son of sevenless complex; Shc, sequence homology of collagen; Ras, rat sarcoma
  protein; Raf, Ras binding protein.
