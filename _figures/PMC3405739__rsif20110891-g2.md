caption: Schematic of the processes included in the insulin model. Triangles represent
  the various states of the insulin receptor, x1–x7. The ovals represent the species
  in the post-receptor signalling pathway that are included as state variables in
  the model. The parameters identified as important by the sensitivity analysis are
  shown in bold. Phosphorylated (P) and unphosphorylated forms are modelled as separate
  species. IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PI(3,4),
  PI(3,4,5) and PI(4,5) are phophoinositol lipids, Akt, protein kinase B, GSK3, glycogen
  synthase kinase.
