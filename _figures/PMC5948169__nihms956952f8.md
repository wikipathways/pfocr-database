caption: The binding of GHRH-A (MR409) to GHRH receptor activates the cAMP/PKA signaling
  pathway, resulting in inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity and dephosphorylation
  of NFκB (p65), which leads to the reduction of ROS and IL-6. Such effects of GHRH-A
  can be blocked by GHRH antagonist, MIA602, by siRNA of GHRH-R and PKA, and by chemical
  inhibitor H89. Reduction of ROS attenuates the expression of osteogenic genes such
  as transcription factor Runx2, osteonectin, osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase.
  Finally, these changes lead to the inhibition of calcium phosphate deposition.
