caption: Figure 4. Model of BRAFV600E-dependent cell growth and mechanisms of resistance
  to BRAF inhibition and restoring of drug sensitivity through combination therapies.
  BRAF mutation confers constitutive pathway activation (red arrows) independent of
  upstream RTKs (EGFR, IGF-1R)/RAS signaling (left panel), providing an explanation
  to the observed insensitivity to anti-EGFR antibody treatment (panitumumab, cetuximab)
  in BRAF mutant CRC. Such a process is blunted by BRAFV600E (BRAFmut) inhibitors
  (blue symbols and drugs) (right panel). Additional mechanisms of EGFR primary or
  secondary resistance described in lung, head-neck cancer and CRC (i.e., EGFR mutation;
  oncogenic shift or activation of a bypass pathway such as KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, secondary
  EGFR mutation or a parallel/alternative pathway [PTEN, IGF1] is also indicated).
  Right panel also illustrates how bypass and resistance to BRAF-inhibitors may occur
  through the rescue of the BRAFV600E-mediated attenuation of ERK negative feedback
  induced by BRAF inhibitors and subsequent reactivation of ligand-dependent signaling
  from EGFR or IGF-1R or via wild type RAS/RAF or PIK3CA/AKT or PIK3CA or EGFR or
  MEK1 or further BRAF gain-of-function mutations (PIK3CAmut or asterisks) in several
  tumor types. Drugs under development in preclinical models or clinical trials to
  overcome BRAF inhibitor resistance are labeled in blue. References are quoted in
  the text.
