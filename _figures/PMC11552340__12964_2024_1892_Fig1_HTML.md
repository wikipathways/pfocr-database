caption: WNT signaling pathways affected by WNT6 in cancer. Both β-catenin-dependent
  (canonical [69–76]) and -independent (non-canonical [74, 75]) WNT signaling pathways
  have been linked to WNT6 in cancer, including ROR2, RYK, PTK7, and planar cell polarity
  (PCP). Upon engagement with its receptor molecules, WNT6 may trigger multiple signaling
  cascades, which ultimately result in the activation and upregulation of specific
  target genes
