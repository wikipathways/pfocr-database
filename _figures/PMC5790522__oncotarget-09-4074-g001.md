caption: The study was designed to screen transcriptome in clinical and cellular levels
  of breast cancer. The DEGs were identified in two groups. PPI was performed to analyze
  the association between the common DEGs and ER related pathway. And then, Enrichment
  analysis was conducted to understand the function of DEGs; Survival analysis was
  conducted to find the association of DEGs with ER signal pathway; qRT-PCR was performed
  to validate RNAseq results.
