caption: The mTORC1 amino acid–sensing pathway. (A) With sufficient amino acids, GATOR1
  is inhibited by GATOR2. Ragulator and v-ATPase undergo a conformation change. GEF
  activity is promoted by Ragulator toward RagA. Folliculin promotes GAP activity
  toward RagC, causing GTP hydrolysis. The active RagA/BGTP-RagC/DGDP heterodimers
  recruit mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane. At the lysosomal surface, mTORC1 is activated
  by Rheb. ARF1 is involved in Rag GTPase-independent signaling to mTORC1. (B) With
  amino acid deficiency, GATOR1 inhibits RagA by exerting GAP activity. Both Sestrin2
  and CASTOR1 interact with GATOR2, removing inhibition of GATOR2 on GATOR1. TSC inhibits
  Rheb through GAP activity. Ragulator is in an inhibitory state with v-ATPase. mTORC1
  remains inactive in the cytoplasm. ARF1, ADP-ribosylation factor 1; GAP, GTPase-activating
  protein; GATOR, GAP activity towards Rags (Ras-related GTPases) GEF, guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; Rag, Ras-related
  GTP-binding protein; Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain; SLC38A9, solute carrier
  family 38, member 9; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; v-ATPase, vacuolar H+-ATPase.
