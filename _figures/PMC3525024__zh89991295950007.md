caption: Schematic representation of canonical and noncanonical Hh signaling activation
  in MM. The signaling is triggered by binding of ligand, produced by Hh signaling
  cells, such as MM cells or BMSCs, to Ptch1 on target cells (canonical or ligand-dependent/
  receptor-induced signaling). This leads to inhibition of Ptch1 via cellular internalization
  and Smo localization on the cell surface. Smo activation leads to nuclear translocation
  of Gli transcription factors followed by expression of Gli target genes, such as
  c-myc, cyclin-D1, and Bcl-2. The biologic effect is cell proliferation, with deregulation
  contributing to tumorigenesis. Abnormal Hh pathway activation occurs also by the
  mechanisms of activation downstream to Smo (noncanonical or ligand-independent Hh
  signaling). Genetic alterations or ciliary protein overexpression leading to functional
  redundancy of Gli transcription factors, crosstalk between Hh signaling, and unrelated
  pathway are all causes of noncanonical Hh signaling activation. Canonical and noncanonical
  Hh pathways probably work in parallel, and a multitargeted approach directed against
  Hh signaling may be a more effective therapeutic strategy.
