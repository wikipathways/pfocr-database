caption: IPP and DMAPP synthesis pathway in plants. DMAPP is converted from IPP by
  IPI in the MVA pathway, whereas the simultaneous production of IPP and DMAPP from
  HMBPP occurs in the MEP pathway. HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA; MVA, mevalonic
  acid; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl
  diphosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate;
  MEP, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate; HMBPP, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl
  4-diphosphate; HMBPPR, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl-4-phosphate reductase; GGPP,
  geranylgeranyl diphosphate.
