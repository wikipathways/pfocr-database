caption: Putative (A) chemokine signaling pathway, (B) platelet activation pathway,
  (C) T cell receptor signaling pathway, and (D) leukocyte transendothelial migration
  pathway were constructed based on KEGG mapping. Red squares indicate proteins identified
  as differentially expressed miRNAs; white circles indicate miRNAs not identified
  as differentially expressed in our study.
