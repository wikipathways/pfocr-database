caption: 'Production and function of hydrogen sulfide in plants. Production (A): The
  red arrows indicate sulfite is reduced to H2S (); the green arrows indicate H2S
  is produced from L-CDes catalytic pathway (); the yellow arrows show H2S generation
  in the presence of reductants (); the light blue arrows represent H2S generated
  from the pathway catalyzed by D-CDes (); the brown arrows show the H2S was generated
  from the reaction of L-cysteine and cyanide (); the black arrows show H2S is produced
  from the reverse reaction of synthesis of cysteine (). The red words represent the
  key enzymes involving in various pathways. Function (B): a, the roles of H2S in
  delaying senescence and decay of horticultural products. b, the involvement of H2S
  in the generation and signaling of transduction of ethylene. c, the effect of H2S
  on antioxidant enzymes in vivo the fungi. d, the roles of H2S in regulating the
  antioxidant system in horticultural plants.'
