caption: Working model of the pathway to maturation of invadopodia when cancer cells
  are stimulated by transient tugging forces. The above signaling pathway is proposed
  to lead to the enhanced invasion observed in fibrosarcoma cells when transient tugging
  forces are applied through a three-dimensional mechano-invasion assay. Invadopodia
  elongate and secrete more MMP-2 when the protein expression of integrin beta-3 is
  downregulated in response to tugging forces. Cofilin is most active when it is not
  phosphorylated and serves as a kinase substrate of LIMK1, which is activated by
  PAK1 and subsequently Rac1. Rac1 and LIMK1 have not yet been confirmed to participate
  in this mechanosensitive pathway.
