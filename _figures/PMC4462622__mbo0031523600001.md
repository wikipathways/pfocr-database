caption: 'A working model for acetate-mediated biofilm induction in B. subtilis. This
  model integrated three different pathways: the biosynthesis and secretion pathway
  for acetic acid (a), the proposed targets and predicted molecular mechanisms of
  acetic acid in the regulation of biofilm formation (b), and the genetic circuitry
  that regulates biofilm formation (c). As shown in panel a, when glycerol is consumed
  as a carbon source, it is sequentially converted to pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, and acetyl-phosphate
  and finally to acetate. GlpF is the glycerol uptake facilitator protein. YwcBA is
  the putative acetate transporter. As shown in panel b, YwbI is the regulatory protein
  that activates the expression of ywbHG in response to acetate. We propose that YwbHG,
  YsbAB, and YxaKC collectively regulate the activity of murein hydrolases and that
  the latter then triggers regulated cell lysis. Extracellular DNA (and/or proteins)
  released from regulated cell lysis could influence biofilm formation in B. subtilis.
  As shown in panel c, the matrix operons (epsA-O and tapA-sipW-tasA) are repressed
  by SinR, whose activity is antagonized by two antirepressors SinI and SlrA.'
