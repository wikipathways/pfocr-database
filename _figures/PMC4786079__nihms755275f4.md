caption: (a) Heat-dependent interelukin-6 (IL-6) trans-signalling is initiated by
  binding of the soluble form of the IL-6 receptor α subunit (sIL-6Rα) to both IL-6
  and membrane-anchored gp130., Soluble gp130 functions as a selective antagonist
  of IL-6 trans-signalling and downstream activation of canonical JAK–STAT and MEK1–ERK1/ERK2
  signalling pathways but does not interfere with classical signalling by membrane-anchored
  IL-6Rα and transmembrane gp130. (b) Febrile temperatures act on lymphocytes and
  high endothelial cells (HECs) to improve lymphocyte trafficking exclusively across
  high endothelial venules (HEVs) in lymph nodes. Vessel segments immediately proximal
  to HEVs are refractory to thermal treatment, which may reflect the lower expression
  of gp130 by non-specialized squamous endothelial cells that line non-HEVs.Left inset,
  fever-range temperatures act directly on lymphocytes through IL-6 trans-signalling
  to stimulate the MEK1–ERK1/ERK2 signalling pathway, promoting L-selectin adhesion
  as well as intermolecular interactions between the actin-based cytoskeleton, α-actinin,
  and the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin.Right inset, IL-6 trans-signalling upregulates
  the intravascular density of ICAM1 in HEVs during heat treatment of mice, although
  the downstream signalling mediators remain unknown. Fibroblastic reticular cells
  that are in direct contact with HECs are a possible source of the IL-6 while proximal
  dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells could provide the sIL-6R, required to enhance
  the adhesive properties of HEVs during thermal stress.
