caption: 'EV modulation of mitochondria and its effects in the context of hallmarks
  of cancer. Cancer cells generate tumor-derived EVs (TEVs) that alter the mitochondrial
  behavior of different cell types of the tumor microenvironment to support cancer
  progression, invasion, and survival. Through these effects, TEVs are mediators of
  several of the hallmarks of cancer such as: (A) dysregulation of cellular energetics:
  cancer cells can induce the release of metabolites from CAFs and adipocytes to be
  used for cancer cell biosynthesis and FAO; (B) avoiding immune destruction: TEVs
  can induce immunosuppression by inducing M2 polarization in macrophages or T cell
  apoptosis via the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway; (C) promoting cell motility and
  facilitating invasiveness: increased FAO leads to an intracellular trafficking of
  mitochondria towards edge protrusions facilitating their migration. At the same
  time, they can induce mitochondrial apoptosis in endothelial barrier cells to permit
  intravasation; (D) resisting cell death: alterations in Bcl-2 family members leads
  to inhibition of mitochondrial apoptosis resulting in chemotherapy resistance and
  angiogenesis. Abbreviations used: OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation. TCA: tricarboxylic
  acid cycle. FAO: fatty acid metabolism. UCP1: uncoupling protein 1. MSC: mesenchymal
  stem cell. Labels in bold represent mitochondria-related elements and processes.
  The colors of the EVs reflect those of the parental cell that produced them. The
  colors of the text borders reflect the cells where the indicated processes take
  place. Figure created with BioRender.com (accessed on 31 March 2022).'
