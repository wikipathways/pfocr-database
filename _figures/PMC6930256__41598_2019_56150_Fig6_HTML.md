caption: The networks of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway related genes, representing
  the level of regulation of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway related genes compared with
  the blank control group in haemocytes, at various times when the HdAKT was inhibited
  by dsRNA. (A) after 4 h, (B) after 12 h, (C) after 24 h. Red, green and white colors
  indicate up-regulation, down-regulation and unaltered expression, respectively.
  The genes not subject to research are marked in gray.
