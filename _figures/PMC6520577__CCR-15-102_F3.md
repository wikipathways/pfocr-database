caption: Schematic of the postulated mechanism of intracellular actions of adrenergic
  agonists. Alpha-adrenoceptor agonists (α-agonists) bind to α-receptors on vascular
  smooth muscle and induce smooth contraction and vasoconstriction, thus mimicking
  the effects of sympathetic adrenergic nerve activation to the blood vessels. The
  α-adrenergic receptor, activates a different regulatory G protein (Gq), which acts
  through the IP3 signal transduction pathway activates the release of calcium from
  the sarcoplasmic reticulum(SR) which by itself and through the calcium–calmodulin
  dependent protein kinases(CaMKII) influences cellular processes, which in vascular
  smooth muscle leads to vasoconstriction.
