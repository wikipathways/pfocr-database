caption: Mechanisms of tumor resistance to protein kinase inhibitors. (A) Mutations
  in the hinge region of protein kinases, such as in the gatekeeper residue (exemplified
  by T on the wild-type (WT) kinase) into bulkier amino acids can impair binding of
  small molecules due to steric restrictions. (B) The relief of negative regulatory
  signals, such as when treating with mTOR inhibitors, can lead to undesired reactivation
  of the inhibited pathway or of compensatory signaling cascades. (C) Resistance to
  B-RAF inhibitors is frequently achieved through increased expression of protein
  kinases that can phosphorylate MEK and compensate for B-RAF inhibition. (D) Treatment
  with B-RAF inhibitors can lead to paradoxical reactivation of the RAF–MEK–ERK signaling
  cascade by promoting B-RAF and C-RAF dimerization, as well as interaction of the
  RAF dimer with active RAS.
