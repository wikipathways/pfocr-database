caption: Proposed mechanism of action for the TPM protocol in LGLL. In LGLL, clonal
  expansion of CD8+ T lymphocytes often harbors STAT gene mutations, resulting in
  aberrant activation of inflammatory signaling cascades. This leads to elevated levels
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, CCL3, and TNF-α, ultimately contributing
  to autoimmune manifestations and cytopenias. The TPM protocol, consisting of thalidomide,
  prednisone, and methotrexate, targets these pathogenic pathways. Thalidomide reduces
  inflammation through inhibition of TNF-α and other cytokines; methotrexate suppresses
  clonal lymphocyte proliferation via inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway;
  prednisone rapidly mitigates cytopenias. Clinical outcomes of the multicenter phase
  II trial (n = 52, conducted in 2022) demonstrated a CR rate of 75%, an ORR of 90%,
  and prolonged PFS. CCL3 = chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3, CR = complete remission,
  IL = interleukin-6, JAK = Janus kinase, LGLL = large granular lymphocytic leukemia,
  ORR = overall response rate, PFS = progression-free survival, STAT = signal transducer
  and activator of transcription, TPM = thalidomide, prednisone, and methotrexate,
  TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor-alpha
