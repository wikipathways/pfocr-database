caption: Neutrophil activation. ACE2 or L-SING receptors on neutrophils most likely
  recognise SARS-CoV2 via a spike (S) protein on its surface. Once the virus enters
  the cell, ssRNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are recognised by TLR 7/8/9 which induce
  the activation of the MyD88 pathway. MyD88 activates TRAF3 and TRAF6 which result
  in the transcription of NF-κB and IRF7 associated genes. The activated NF-κB pathway
  leads to the transcriptional induction of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines
  and additional inflammatory mediators in neutrophils. In addition, cytosolic viral
  RNA recruiting MDA5, RIF1 and PKR lead to the activation of TBK1 and the further
  activation of IRF3 resulting in the transcription of type I/II IFN genes. The positive
  stimulatory loop by type I IFN induces the production of more IFNs through the JAK/STAT
  pathway and the induction of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISG). At the same time,
  SARS-CoV-2 possess ORF6, an accessory protein antagonist of IFNs by the inhibition
  of MDA5, TBK1, IRF3 and IRF9. ssRNA viruses also cause the recruitment of the NLRP3
  inflammasome complex and the further activation of pro-caspase-1 resulting in the
  cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into the active forms. ACE2, angiotensin-Converting
