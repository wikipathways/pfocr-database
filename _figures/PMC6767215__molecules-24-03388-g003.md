caption: Yeast model to screen for inhibitors of Aβ oligomerization. In the ade1-14
  reporter strain, the stop codon UGA, introduced into the ADE1 gene, is normally
  recognized by the translation termination complex, including release factor Sup35.
  Fusion of Aβ with functional domain (MRF) of Sup35 leads to its oligomerization.
  When Aβ-MRF is in an oligomeric for, translation termination is impaired. This results
  in synthesis of full-length Ade1 protein due to readthrough of the stop codon, inability
  of cells to grow on the medium lacking adenine (–Ade) and white color on the complete
  (YPD) medium (Left panel). If cells are treated with a compound able to counteract
  oligomerization of Aβ-MRF, translation termination is restored, leading to the production
  of truncated Ade1 protein, inability of cells to grow on -Ade medium and accumulation
  of red pigment (a polymerized intermediate of the adenine biosynthetic pathway)
  on YPD medium (right panel).
