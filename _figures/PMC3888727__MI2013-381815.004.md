caption: A proposal of how alliin could counteract the inflammatory state promoted
  by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. (a) Activation of proinflammatory
  signaling pathway by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). (b) Alliin could reduce the Toll-like
  receptor-4 (TLR-4) pathway, possibly by diminishing the expression of related genes
  and proteins such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemostatic protein-1 (MCP-1),
  and early growth receptor-1 (Egr-1) and therefore regulates extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK1/2) activity.
