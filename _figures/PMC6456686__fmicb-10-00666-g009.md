caption: Chlamydia trachomatis hijacks Akt/AS160/Rab14 cascade to acquire Golgi-derived
  sphingolipids. Ct phosphorylates and recruits pAkt to the inclusion membrane by
  one or more cognate effectors (CT effector). Upon Akt activation, AS160 is inactivated
  by phosphorylation and it is detached from the inclusion membrane. Hindered AS160
  GAP-activity enables Rab14 to remain in its GTP-bound membrane-associated active
  form. This, in turn, favors the arrival to chlamydial inclusions of sphingolipids
  synthesized at the Golgi apparatus through a Rab14-controlled vesicular transport.
