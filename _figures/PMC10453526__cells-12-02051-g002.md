caption: Schematic diagram of nodes and tracks of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory
  pathway. The connection between the vagus and the splenic nerve via the celiac ganglion
  promotes noradrenaline release (blue circles) and activation of splenic T-cells.
  T-cells release acetylcholine (ACh) that can bind to α7 nAChR on immune cells such
  as macrophages, inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation
  of α7 nAChR inhibits the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cell (NFkB) translocation to the cell nucleus and activation of a Janus kinase
  2 (JAK2)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-mediated signaling
  pathway. In parallel, activation of α7 nAChRs may up-regulate the expression of
  interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase M (IRAK-M), which can negatively regulate
  innate Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated immune responses, contributing to cholinergic
  anti-inflammatory effects
