caption: Protective mechanisms of Melatonin. Melatonin alleviates TM-induced endoplasmic
  reticulum stress and apoptosis of chicken ovarian granulosa cells by regulating
  ATF4 to activating mTOR signaling pathway. TM challenge induces ERS, which indicates
  the disruption of cell homeostasis, thus resulting in cell apoptosis. However, MEL
  protects against TM-induced ERS injury by reducing ROS production and reducing ATF4-mediated
  apoptosis responses, activating mTOR signaling pathway and inhibiting Bcl-2-mediated
  apoptosis in chicken ovarian granulosa cells.
