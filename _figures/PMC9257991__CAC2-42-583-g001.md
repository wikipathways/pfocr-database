caption: PKCβII‐ACSL4‐mediated positive feedback loop for sensing and amplifying lipid
  peroxidation and its relevance to ferroptosis execution and anti‐cancer immunity.
  PKCβII senses lipid peroxidation. Even a moderate accumulation of lipid peroxides
  can induce the activation of PKCβII (by promoting its phosphorylation and membrane
  localization). Subsequently, PKCβII activates ACSL4 by phosphorylating the Thr328
  site of ACSL4, promoting PUFA‐CoA formation and therefore amplifying the accumulation
  of lipid peroxides to a lethal level, ultimately triggering ferroptosis. Interferon
  gamma (IFNγ) secreted by CD8+ T cells stimulates ACSL4 expression and increases
  ACSL4‐mediated biosynthesis of PUFA‐CoA, thereby promoting tumoral ferroptosis.
  Accordingly, a promising strategy to induce tumoral ferroptosis in cancer therapy
  is to combine immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with PUFA (such as AA) supplementation
  or drugs that activate the PKCβII‐ACSL4 pathway
