caption: Composite tissue injuries involves multiple immune cells and endogenous immune
  pathways. Tissue-resident macrophages release chemoattractants triggering neutrophil
  infiltration and the simultaneous activation of complement pathway molecules in
  vessels. These events result in increased pro-inflammatory conditions with an increased
  number of M1-like macrophages. Pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid pathway metabolites,
  PGE2 and leukotrienes along with pro-inflammatory cytokines result in initiating
  precursor cells in various damaged tissues. An increase in Th2 immune response is
  established with an increase in IL10, IL4, and IL3, etc., which propagates M2 macrophages
  and Tregs that help in inducing cell differentiation and wound healing. A sustained
  pro-inflammatory reaction for a longer duration than needed results in a chronic
  wound or delayed wound closure.
