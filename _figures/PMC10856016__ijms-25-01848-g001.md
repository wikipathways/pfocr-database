caption: 'Activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways. The binding of
  various growth factors, hormones, and cytokines to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
  or G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) leads to the activation of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K), which induces the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), inducing protein kinase
  B (AKT) activation by phosphorylation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1).
  Once activated, p-AKT activates other substrates by phosphorylation, such as the
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), the Forkhead
  box proteins (FoxOs) and c Adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response binding protein
  (CREB). mTOR activates other proteins such as eukaryotic initiation factor binding
  protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K), also known as p70S6
  kinase. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) complex activation starts with the
  formation of Ras-GTP from the inactive form Ras-GDP, which further activates the
  downstream substrates, including Raf, MAPK kinase (MAPKK or MEK), extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinases (ERK1/1), and c-jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase
  (JNK). In healthy cells, activation of these signaling pathways sustain the normal
  functions of the cells. Note: + denotes activation'
