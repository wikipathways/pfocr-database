caption: EVs contain miRNA, proteins and lipids. ECs secrete miR-92-3p that induce
  angiogenesis on neighboring ECs via thrombospondin 1 which also increase proinflammatory
  signals []. miR-126 suppresses VCAM-1-VLA-4 binding, which reduces leukocytes adherence
  to ECs, resulting in lower leukocyte influx []. EC-derived EVs contain mir-199a
  which suppresses monocytes recruitment and inflammation via inhibition of the NF-κB
  signaling pathway (which includes TLR, IL-1R, MyD88, IRAK1/4, RAF6, TRAF6, IRAK1,
  IKKβ, IKKα, IKKγ, IkB, P65, P50, NF-κB) []. This could be a potential treatment
  to reduce inflammation after a CVD event []. miR-21-3p and miR-21-5p target cardiomyocytes
  and promote hypertrophy by inducing cell growth via inhibiting the PTEN signaling
  (which includes phosphoinositide (4,5) P2, phosphoinositide (3,4,5) P3, PDK1, AKT,
  and mTOR). Fibroblast cells release EVs that harbor miR-21-3p, miR-21-5p and exo-miR-21
  []. Exo-miR-21 promotes inflammation via stimulating the NF-κB signaling in macrophages
  []. Thrombospondin activates CD36, which activates CD47 and Fas protein that encourage
  apoptosis and promotes secretion of damage-associated molecular pattern. Cardiomyocytes
  secrete miR-143 and miR-222 that are engulfed by ECs []. These two miRNAs regulate
  cell proliferation and differentiation and are associated with inflammation and
  MI pathogenesis. Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles that contain IL-1β and
  caspase-1 activates the inflammasome pathway in neutrophils []. IL-1β neutralization
  is a potential therapy to dampen inflammation in cardiovascular disease []. This
