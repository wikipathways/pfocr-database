caption: The maturation of the mouse intestine after birth (upper panel) resembles
  the remodeling of the Xenopus intestine during metamorphosis (lower panel). In both
  cases, adult stem cells are formed from larval/neonatal epithelial cells when plasma
  T3 level becomes high. In mouse, the cells in the intervillus region develop into
  adult stem cells expressing protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) and hedgehog
  (hh) (green cells with irregular-shaped dark nuclei) and invaginate into the underlying
  connective tissue to form the crypts. In Xenopus, most larval epithelial cells undergo
  apoptosis in response to rising levels of T3 during metamorphosis but some larval
  epithelial cells undergo dedifferentiation to develop into adult stem cells expressing,
  as in mouse intestine, high levels of PRMT1 and sonic hedgehog (hh) (green cells
  with irregular-shaped dark nuclei). In addition, adult stem cells in Xenopus also
  express well-known adult stem cell markers LGR5 and Msi1 as in adult mouse intestinal
  stem cells. Subsequent differentiation of the descendants of these adult stem cells
  in both mouse and Xenopus leads to the formation of adult epithelial cells to replace
  the suckling-type or larval-type epithelial cells, accompanied by the establishment
  of a self-renewing epithelial system with stem cells located in the bottom of the
  crypt (mouse)/epithelial fold (Xenopus). Note that in both mouse and Xenopus intestine,
  T3 also regulates known stem cell pathways, such as the WNT pathway. Modified after
  ().
