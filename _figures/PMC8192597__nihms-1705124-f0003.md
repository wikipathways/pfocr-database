caption: Impact of acute and chronic stress exposure on dopamine and dynorphin/KOR
  systems. In na誰ve animals, acute stress results in elevations in extracellular levels
  of dopamine (red arrow) and dynorphins (brown arrow). Acute systemic ethanol administration
  at moderate (1 g/kg; light blue arrow) and high doses (2 g/kg; dark blue arrow)
  result in comparable elevations in extracellular levels of dopamine. Repeated cycles
  of stress exposure or prolonged stress exposure attenuates baseline dopamine levels
  (aqua arrow); however, reports on levels of dynorphins (orange arrow) are mixed
  with some studies showing an elevation and others showing a reduction. Interestingly,
  all studies report an elevation in KOR function (yellow arrow). Dopamine response
  to subsequent stress (red arrow) and high dose of ethanol (2 g/kg; dark blue arrow)
  exposure is exacerbated in chronic stress-exposed animals. A subsequent moderate
  ethanol dose (1 g/kg; light blue) elicits a dopamine response comparable to stress
  na誰ve animals, but this response is augmented with KOR blockade (see text). Because
  stress affects both the dopamine and dynorphin/KOR systems, the resulting interactions
  are complex. Ultimately, however, these neuroadaptations promote pro-addictive behaviors
