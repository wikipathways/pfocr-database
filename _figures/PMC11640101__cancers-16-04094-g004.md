caption: Involvement of the ARF6-AMAP1 pathway and Arid5a in cancer progression and
  immune evasion. ARF6 is activated by GEP100 or EFA6 through activated RTKs or GPCRs,
  and transmits signals via its interaction with AMAP1, an effector of ARF6, contributing
  to cancer malignancies, such as invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, immune evasion,
  and unfavorable outcomes. In PDAC, mutations in KRAS and TP53 promote cancer malignancy
  through the ARF6-AMAP1 pathway. KRAS mutations (KRAS mut) drive the upregulation
  of ARF6 and AMAP1 during the translation process. The upregulation of the MVP owing
  to TP53 mutations (TP53 mut) is involved in the activation of ARF6 through the geranylgeranylation
  modification of Rab11b. EPB41L5, induced by EMT, interacts with AMAP1 and is involved
  in the acquisition of mesenchymal traits. Additionally, ARF6 plays a role in regulating
  the expression of GLUT1, HK2, LDHA, and c-Myc. ARF6 mRNA levels significantly increase
  with the activation of HIF-1α and are also associated with the EMT. c-Myc enhances
  the expression of several key glycolytic genes, including GLUT1, HK2, and LDHA,
  and is also associated with the transcriptional activation of ARF6. The RNA-binding
  protein Arid5a stabilizes IL-6, Ccl2, IDO1, and other mRNAs, playing diverse roles
  in immune regulation and tumor progression. IL-6 increases the level of Arid5a,
  enhancing the stability of its mRNA and forming a positive feedback loop. The stabilization
  of Ido1 mRNA by Arid5a reduces the concentration of tryptophan in the tumor, leading
  to the production of kynurenine, which promotes the differentiation and activation
  of Tregs, resulting in an immunosuppressive environment. The stabilization of Ccl2
  mRNA by Arid5a induces immunosuppressive cells in the tumor, contributing to an
  immunosuppressive environment. Thus, the ARF6-AMAP1 pathway and Arid5a play crucial
  roles in cancer malignancy, highlighting their significance in the complex process
  of tumor progression. GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; HK1/2, hexokinase1/2; IDO,
