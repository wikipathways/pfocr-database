caption: Schematic diagram of signaling pathways triggered by bacterial components,
  saturated fatty  acids, and adipokines in epithelial and innate immune cells leading
  to either activation or negative regulation of proinflammatory pathways related
  to obesity and insulin resistance. (1) Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative
  bacteria and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) is recognized by toll-like receptor (TLR)
  4 activating proinflammatory pathways involving the MyD88 (myeloid differentiation
  primary-response protein 88)-dependent and -independent pathways that may lead to
  activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and activator protein-1 (AP-1) with production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (2) Peptidoglycan (PGL) and lipoteichoic acid from
  Gram-positive bacteria are recognized by TLR-2 triggering the activation of the
  MyD88-dependent pathway. (3) Commensal bacteria and some probiotics may suppress
  activation of NF-κB cascade by (i) promotion of nuclear export of NF-κB subunit
  relA in complex with PPAR-γ; (ii) inhibition of IκB ubiquitination and degradation,
  (iii) induction of anti-inflammatory (IL10) cytokine production. (4) Leptin interacts
  with its receptors (OBR) activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT), and induces production of CCL2, proinflammatory cytokines, and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) causing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
