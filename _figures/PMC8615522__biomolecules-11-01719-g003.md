caption: 'A simplified model of the transcriptional network of JA signaling involved
  in MIA biosynthesis in C. roseus. Boxes with straight lines indicate regulator genes,
  including promoter regions. Black arrows indicate upregulation, and T-shaped lines
  indicate inhibition. Broken lines show indirect or undetermined steps possibly involved
  in uncharacterized proteins or unidentified regulation. GES, IS, and 7DLH marked
  in the green box work in the iridoid pathway to synthesize loganic acid in internal
  phloem-associated parenchyma (IPAP), while D4H and DAT marked in the blue box function
  in the biosynthesis of vindoline in laticifers/idioblasts. The relationship between
  tissue/cell-specific regulation of enzyme genes and JA-responsive TFs remains unknown.
  Secologanin, tryptamine, strictosidine, tabersonine, and desacetoxyvindoline are
  synthesized in the upper or lower epidermis by SLS, STR, SGD, 16OMT, and TDC marked
  in the yellow boxes. Possible feedback regulation via MYC2 TF, which is known to
  regulate the expression of its own and JAZ genes, is shown. It is still unknown
  whether the expression of other genes such as BIS, WRKY1, and MAPKKK1 is directly
  regulated by MYC2. BIS and ORCA genes are clustered in the same C. roseus genome
  scaffolds, scaffold_135 and scaffold_158, respectively. Abbreviations: BIS, bHLH
