caption: 'Schematic representation of blood vessel structure and main endothelial
  functions. (A) EC and regulation of vascular tone. The regulation of vascular tone
  is obtained through the balanced production of vasodilators and vasoconstrictors
  in response to a variety of stimuli., The left side of (A) shows the main mechanisms
  involved in vasodilatation: Nitric oxide (NO) is the predominant mediator of normal
  vascular function and is generated from L-arginine through endothelial NO synthase
  (NOS). When released by the endothelium, NO diffuses in the vessel wall, to the
  vascular SMC, and activates guanylate cyclase causing SMC relaxation. Another endothelium-derived
  vasodilator is prostacyclin (PGI2), generated by cyclooxygenase (COX) and arachidonic
  acid metabolism. PGI2 activates adenylate cyclase with subsequent generation of
  cAMP and final relaxation of the underlying smooth muscle cells. NO and PGI2 have
  also important antiplatelet effects, as they limit aggregation; both of them are
  involved in the inhibition of coagulation, inflammation, and smooth muscle cells
  proliferation. The right side of (A) shows the main mechanisms involved in vasoconstriction.
  The main vasoconstrictive factor is Endothelin (ET), an endothelium-derived 21-amino-acid
  peptide (the ET family consists of three structurally related peptides, ET-1, ET-2,
  and ET-3). The product of ET transcription is prepro-ET, which is cleaved by a neutral
  endopeptidase to form the active precursor pro-ET. Pro-ET may be released from the
  non-luminal surface of the endothelial cells and converted to mature ET by the membrane-bound
  metalloproteinase endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE). The two ET receptors, both
  coupled to G proteins, are endothelin A (ETA) receptor, situated on the vascular
  SMC, and endothelin B (ETB) receptor, located on endothelial cells. Binding to ETA
  receptor stimulates phospholipase C initiating in turn events leading eventually
  to SMC contraction. The result of ET binding to ETB receptor on endothelial cells
  is the release of NO and PGI2, which opposes the vasoconstricting action of ET.
  ET also exert mitogenic activity on SMC (not shown in picture). Many factors stimulating
  ET synthesis, such as thrombin and angiotensin II, also cause the release of vasodilatator
  PG12 and/or NO, which oppose the vasoconstricting action of ET. (B) Endothelial
  cells and coagulation and fybrinolysis. The major antiplatelet agents secreted by
  endothelial cells are PGI2 and NO. In the quiescent state, endothelial cells maintain
  blood fluidity by promoting the activity of numerous anticoagulant pathways, the
  most important being the protein C/protein S pathway (PC/PS), which is initiated
  when thrombin interacts with the endothelial cell receptor thrombomodulin (TM),
  facilitating activation of protein C. Activated protein C (aPC) inactivates two
  cofactors essential for blood coagulation: factors VIIIa and Va. To be effective,
  protein C must form a complex with protein S, which is synthesized by endothelial
  cells. Complex formation between thrombin and thrombomodulin also prevents thrombin
  from being able to clot fibrinogen or to activate platelets. Moreover, the endothelial
  cell surface is rich in heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (HSPG) to which antithrombin
  (AT) is bound thus providing the main site for inactivation of active thrombin.
  Endothelial cells also synthesize tissue factor (TF) pathway inhibitor and participates
  in fibrinolysis by releasing tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase,
  allowing the transformation of plasminogen into plasmin, which degrades thrombi
  by digesting fibrin network. t-PA is constitutively released while urokinase is
  only synthesized by activated endothelial cells. The natural inhibitor of t-PA,
  plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is also constitutively secreted by
  endothelial cells. The balance of t-PA and PAI-1, which is normally in favor of
  PAI-1 is also altered by (continued) Figure 1. Continued. cytokines, again in a
  way that is procoagulant. After activation, the balance of endothelial properties
  can be tipped to favor platelet aggregation and clot formation through coordinate
  induction of procoagulant/prothrombotic factors and suppression of anticoagulant
  mechanisms. Operating in coordination, these changes can allow fibrin formation
  and platelet activation to proceed in an inflamed focus. At least two mediators
  released by activated endothelial cells favor platelet activation. The first one
  is the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF), synthesized by endothelial
  cells stimulated by thrombin, histamine, or cytokines. Most of the produced PAF
  remains membrane associated. PAF is a potent platelet activator and can promote
  platelet adhesion to endothelial cells. The second is the von Willebrand factor
  (vWF) of which endothelial cells are the major source. vWF is constitutively secreted
  into the plasma and the subendothelial matrix. It is also stored in high amount
  in intracellular Weibel–Palade bodies, which can be mobilized rapidly in response
  to agonists like thrombin. Endothelial cells do not normally express the primary
  trigger of the coagulation system, TF. However, when exposed to thrombin, cytokines,
  or lipopolysaccharides (LPS), endothelial cells synthesize and express TF at their
  surface. Once coagulation has been initiated, endothelial cells promote thrombi
  activation since the activity of factor Xa (generated by TF plus factor VII) is
  locally enhanced by promotion of binding with its cofactor Va at adjacent Xa and
  Va receptors on the endothelial cell surface. Thrombin is the main effector protease
  of the coagulation cascade. Factor Xa, activated by factor VIIa and TF, converts
  prothrombin into active thrombin. This protease converts circulating fibrinogen
  into fibrin monomer, which polymerizes to form fibrin, the fibrous matrix of blood
  clot. In endothelial cells, thrombin causes vWF release, the appearance of P-selectin
  at the plasma membrane, production of PAF and chemokines. Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2
  (F1 + 2) and thrombin–antithrombin (TAT) complexes may be measured to assess thrombin
  activation. Endothelial cells also change shape and show increased permeability.
  All together, these changes initiate a proinflammatory and procoagulation situation.
  Thrombin similarly activates platelets. (C) Endothelial cells, inflammation, repair,
  and remodeling. Endothelial factors involved in the phase of increased vascular
  permeability include NO, prostaglandins, and platelet activating factor (PAF). Endothelial
  cells are also the ‘gatekeepers’ of the cell recruitment in inflammation. (C) Left
  side depicts the main events involved in the recruitment of leukocytes from the
  circulation into the extravascular space, critical for inflammatory responses, and
  repair of tissue injury. Once activated, endothelial cells express adhesion molecules
  on their surfaces thus allowing the binding to reciprocal molecules on the surfaces
  of circulating leukocytes. Finally, chemotactic factors attract leukocytes along
  a chemical gradient to the site of injury. Adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte
  recruitment include four molecular families which are selectins, addressins, integrins,
  and immunoglobulins. P-selectin is preformed and stored within Weibel-Palade bodies
  of endothelial cells and α-granules of platelets, allowing the rapid transportation
  to the cell surface, upon stimulation and thus the rapid adhesive interaction between
  endothelial cells and leukocytes. E-selectin is not expressed on quiescent endothelial
  cell surfaces but is induced by inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines or bacterial
  LPS. L-selectin is mainly expressed on leukocytes. Vascular addressins are mucin-like
  glycoproteins expressed on the surface of endothelial cells as well as leukocytes.
  They possess sialyl-Lewis X, which binds the lectin domain of selectins. Their functions
  include regulation of localization of leukocytes and are involved in lymphocyte
  activation. Vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), together with intercellular
  adhesion molecules 1 and 2 (ICAM-1, ICAM-2), are adhesion molecules belonging to
  the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1
  (PECAM-1) is a member of the Ig superfamily expressed on the surface, at intercellular
  junctions, of unstimulated endothelial cells, as well as on other types of cells
  including circulating leukocytes, which is important for the passage of leukocyte
  across the endothelium. The interaction between endothelial and leukocyte PECAM-1
  is fundamental for transmigration. The right side of (C) shows main mechanisms implicated
  in endothelial repair. Mediators of angiogenesis are growth factors, among which
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most specific for endothelium,
  cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and extracellular matrix
  macromolecules, which may influence endothelial proliferation directly or indirectly
  by means of the stimulation and the production of other angiogenic factors. Circulating
  endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) are hematopoietic stem cells with limited pluripotent
  potential, mainly involved in formation of new vessels after ischemia and in repairing
  damaged endothelium. Circulating progenitors cells (CPCs) are more undifferentiated
  bone marrow-derived cells, involved in damaged brain repair. Circulating endothelial
  cells (CEC) are mature endothelial cells released from the intima after vascular
  damage. In pathologic conditions with endothelial dysfunction, the number of EPC
  and CPC is reduced, while CEC levels are increased. BM, basal membrane; EC, endothelial
