caption: Signaling pathways involved in thrombin induced EMP formation. EMPs carry
  TF, the main initiator of the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. Cofactor
  VIIIa known as a von Willebrand factor activates factor X to Xa in the presence
  of factor Va, calcium, and phospholipids (PL), which results in the generation of
  thrombin. Thrombin induces tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) via p38 (mitogen activated
  protein kinase) and interleukins 1, 6, and 8 (Il-1, IL-6, and IL-8), which both
  lead to formation of EMPs. Thrombin, via proteolytically activated receptor-1 (PAR-1),
  induces nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which directly induces EMP formation. PAR-1
  also induces Rho kinase (ROCK- II) which activates caspase-2 leading to EMPs formation.
  Thrombin via (tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand) TRAIL activates
  sTRAIL, which is synthesized to TRAIL R2. This process requires the activation of
  NF-κB.
