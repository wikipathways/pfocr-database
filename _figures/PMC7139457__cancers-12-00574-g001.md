caption: The intrinsic apoptotic pathway and interactions between pro- and anti-apoptotic
  B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family members. Intrinsic pathway apoptotic stimuli such
  as viral infection, oxidative stress, calcium flux and DNA damage lead to changes
  in the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. The anti-apoptotic
  proteins act to prevent BAX/BAK activation. Activator BH3-only proteins (PUMA, tBID,
  BIM) inhibit all anti-apoptotic members, whereas sensitizer BH3-only proteins interact
  and engage selective anti-apoptotic members, allowing BAX/BAK oligomerization and
  indirect activation. Oligomerization of BAX/BAK in the mitochondrial membrane commits
  the cell to mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), and triggers a
  downstream caspase cascade which ends in apoptosis.
