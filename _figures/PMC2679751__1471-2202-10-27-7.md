caption: Proposed model for functional interaction between Ncs-1a, Pi4kβ, and Arf1
  in trafficking and secretion. Dan, Bmp4, and HA are secreted molecules that contribute
  to proper semicircular canal development and are predicted to require the action
  of an Ncs-1/Pi4kb/Arf1 signaling pathway for their secretion. Bold arrows indicate
  activation, whereas the bold T indicates inhibition, of this signaling pathway.
  Thin arrows indicate directional flow of vesicles or proteins.
