  to the main subgroups, and including lignin and flavonoids. Key enzymes catalyzing
  some reactions: PAL, phenylalanine amonialyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL,
  4 coumaroyl-coenzyme A ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase;
  F3H, flavanone 3′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; FLS, flavonol synthase;
  IFS, isoflavonoid synthase; AS, anthocianin synthase; UF3GT, UDP glucose: flavonoid
  3-O-glucosyltransferase; TAL, Tyrosine ammonia-lyase; C3H, p-Coumarate 3-hydroxylase;
  CCR, Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; HCT, Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/quinatehydroxycinnoyltransferase;
  and PPO, Polyphenol oxidase. Adapted from ref [,,].'
