caption: After encountering the recipient cell, the extracellular vesicle is typically
  bound to its surface via cell-surface receptors (although extracellular vesicles
  can also be engulfed from the environment in a process known as macropinocytosis;
  not shown). After establishing an interaction with the cell surface, the vesicle
  can remain bound on the surface or can be internalized (1). One possible means of
  internalization is direct fusion with the plasma membrane (2), but the most common
  mechanism of internalization involves endocytosis, whereby extracellular vesicles
  are taken up to endosomes (3). In the endosome, RNA content might be released into
  the luminal space (if the integrity of the extracellular vesicle membrane is perturbed)
  or it might be released into the cytoplasm (of note, the frequency of these events
  is low, and endosomal escape of extracellular vesicle cargo is currently an important
  bottleneck in functional RNA cargo delivery by extracellular vesicles). In both
  cases RNAs can be recognized by pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I or NOD-like receptors that reside in the endosome and
  in the cytoplasm, respectively, raising innate immune response signalling (4). Early
  endosomes will gradually transform into late endosomes with progressive internal
  acidification and possible release of RNA (stimulated by the decreasing pH) (5).
  Further down the endocytic pathway, endosomes will mature into lysosomes, in which
  the cargo that has not been released to the cytoplasm will be degraded (6). RNA
  cargo that reaches the cytoplasm can elicit its functional effect. For example,
  mRNA can be translated into a functional protein, such as green fluorescent protein
  (GFP), and the resulting fluorescence can act as a reporter of functional delivery
  of extracellular vesicle cargo (7). When small interfering RNA (siRNA) cargo is
  released into the cytoplasm, it can inhibit translation of specific transcripts,
  such as those encoding fluorescent proteins. In this case, disappearance of fluorescence
  will report on functional delivery of extracellular vesicle cargo (8). Extracellular
  vesicles can be tracked along this route with use of different reagents or labelling
  strategies (Table ). 5′ppp-RNA, 5′- triphosphorylated RNA.
