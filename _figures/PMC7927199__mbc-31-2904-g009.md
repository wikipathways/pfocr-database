caption: 'Proposed schematic model summarizing the role of GNL1 as an antiapoptotic
  protein. Results from the present investigation clearly illustrate that: 1) GNL1
  alters the expression of pro- and antiapoptotic BCL2 family proteins; 2) suppression
  of ERp29 is required for the activation of AKT signaling pathway; 3) GNL1 promotes
  cytoplasmic localization and stabilization of p21 in AKT-mediated phosphorylation-dependent
  manner; and 4) cyto­plasmic p21 inhibits caspase 8 cleavage, which is essential
  for the antiapoptotic function of GNL1.'
