caption: Regulation pathways in ferroptosis. There are three main metabolic pathways
  related to ferroptosis, iron metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism.
  The first two metabolites mainly promote the occurrence of ferroptosis, while the
  metabolites of amino acids (taking cysteine as an example) mainly play a role in
  resisting material peroxidation and ferroptosis. Fe3+ enters the cell through transferrin
  receptor 1 (TFR1) and is reduced to Fe2+ in lysosome. After entering the free iron
  pool, it can promote the formation and destruction of lipid peroxides, and hinder
  the removal of iron (including synthase, expelling and binding to ferritin storage)
  can lead to the overload of free iron. In addition, lipid peroxidation products
  are affected by Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), Arachidonic acid lipoxygenases (ALOXS) and other enzymes,
  and are also catalyzed by Fe2+ Fenton reaction. Lipid peroxides produced have a
  central position in the process of ferroptosis. As a representative of antioxidant
  capacity, cysteine metabolic pathway can reduce lipid peroxides by Reduced glutathione
  (GSH). The coordination of the three maintain the stability of the internal environment,
  and the collapse of the balance will lead to the cascade reaction of ferroptosis.
