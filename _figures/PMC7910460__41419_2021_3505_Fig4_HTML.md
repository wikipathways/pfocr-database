caption: HIFs have an effect on multiple mitochondrial functions, including mitochondrial
  oxidative capacity, OXPHOS, biogenesis, apoptosis, fission, and autophagy. HIF-1
  activation downregulates mitochondrial oxidation by inhibiting ATGL-mediated lipolysis
  via HIG2, which leads to LD storage and subsequently declines mitochondrial FA oxidation
  under hypoxic conditions, and by inducing PDK, which inhibits PDH, thereby inhibiting
  the flow of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. HIF-1 also regulates mitochondrial redox
  by inducing mitochondrial serine catabolism and the production of NADPH. Furthermore,
  miR-210, which is upregulated by HIF-1, restrains expression of the Fe–S cluster
  assembly proteins ISCU-1 and ISCU-2, which further restricts mitochondrial ROS generation
  and induces a shift of energy metabolism from OXPHOS to glycolysis. HIF-1 stimulates
  the less active ETC components, including NDUFA4L2, COX4-1, COX4-2, complex I, and
  complex IV, to delay the electron transfer through the ETC, therefore blocking the
  accumulation of ROS and reducing ROS-mediated apoptosis. HIF-1α reduces mitochondrial
  biogenesis by targeting PGC-1α, MXI, and HEY1. Meanwhile, NPAS2 increases the expression
  of glycolytic genes by transcriptionally upregulating HIF-1α. HIF-1 also regulates
  apoptosis by promoting the formation of VDAC1-∆C from VDAC1. Mitochondrial fission,
  which results in the activation of mitochondria-associated apoptosis, is negatively
  regulated by the HIF/miR-125a/Mfn2 pathways during carcinogenesis. Mitochondrial
  proteins can also be inhibited by suppression of the mTORC1/p70SK/S6 signaling pathway
  via action of HIF-1α. HIF-1α also induces BNIP3 to promote mitochondrial autophagy.
