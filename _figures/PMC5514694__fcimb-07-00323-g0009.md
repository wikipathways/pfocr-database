caption: Coordinating reactions in the intestine elicited by LGG in response to S.
  Infantis infection. Oral infection with Salmonella Infantis causes diarrhea in newly
  weaned piglets. LGG pretreatment prevents colonization of the jejunum by Salmonella,
  thereby blunting pathogen invasion. In response to S. Infantis infection, LGG enhances
  the expression of IL-22 and STAT3 activity, thus inducing the production of antimicrobial
  proteins to protect mucosal surfaces from invading pathogens. Elevation of IL-22BP
  expression is significant in prevention of the IL-22-associated proinflammatory
  damage to tissues. LGG suppresses the expression of the inflammatory chemokine CCL20,
  which attracts CCR6+ cells to tissues. LGG downregulates the expression of IL-7
  and IL-7Rα but elevates the expression of T-bet, which has been proposed as a suppressor
  of IL-7Rα (Powell et al., ). LGG is potential in preventing aberrant CD4+ IFNγ+
  T cell responses and excessive IFNγ production in the PPs caused by intracellular
  bacteria. The above activity of LGG against Salmonella and its regulation of immune
  responses during S. Infantis infection contribute to the amelioration of intestinal
  inflammation.
