caption: Biological activity of membrane and soluble PD-1/PD-L1 in tumor immunity.
  (A) The complete activation of T cells relies on two signals, with the first signal
  provided by the specific binding of T-cell receptor (TCR) to major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) and the second signal provided by the interaction of CD28 on T cell
  surfaces with co-stimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 expressed by antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs). (B) The mechanism of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling involves the recruitment
  of the Src homology 2 domain containing phosphatases 2 (SHP2) to the PD-1 cytoplasmic
  domain, which dephosphorylates signaling molecules of the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways,
  thereby restricting T-cell proliferation, activation and survival. (C) sPD-1 has
  been found to suppress the interactions of PD-1 with PD-L1 and PD-L2 and the interaction
  of PD-L1 with CD80. However, sPD-1 may also have reverse signaling effects on APCs
  via the PD-L1/PD-L2 pathway and inhibits T cell function. (D) sPD-L1, like mPD-L1,
  binds to PD-1 to transmit negative regulatory signals.
