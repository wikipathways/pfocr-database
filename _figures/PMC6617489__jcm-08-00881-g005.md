caption: Lipotoxicity of VLDLs on mediating maladaptation of calcium regulation to
  derangement of sarcomere proteins in atrial myopathy. In metabolic syndrome (MetS),
  VLDLs undergo biochemical property changes and become different from VLDLs of normal
  conditions []. MetS-VLDLs reduce STIM1 expression and enhance O-GlcNAcylation on
  STIM1 protein. These changes in concert suppress SOCE and the downstream calcineurin–NFAT
  pathway, resulting in alteration of myofilament protein expression, disruption of
  sarcomere organization, and atrial myopathy []. The progression of atrial myopathy
  ultimately leads to atrial fibrillation.
