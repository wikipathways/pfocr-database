caption: A mechanism of hypercoagulability of pancreatic cancer patients which induced
  by Jagged-Notch/NF-κB/IL-6/JAK-STAT3 feedback loop. Cancer cells induce IL-6 expression
  in HSF cells by Jagged/Notch/NF-κB axis, then high level of IL-6 promotes Jagged
  expression through JAK-STAT3 pathway, meanwhile, IL-6 enhances TPO production in
  liver, followed by TPO enhances hypercoagulable state in the patients.
