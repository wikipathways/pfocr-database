caption: Canonical mechanism of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell
  death characterized by excess iron in the LIP and the lethal accumulation of lipid
  peroxidation products. Fe3+ is transferred into the cell by TFR1, is converted to
  Fe2+ in the endosome and is then released from the endosome by DMT1. Iron-containing
  ferritin is degraded to produce a large amount of free iron via NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy,
  resulting in ferroptosis. The Fenton reaction promotes lipid peroxidation by activating
  lipoxygenases. Cystine is taken up by System Xc- for the synthesis of GSH, which
  further enhances the anti-lipid peroxidation activity of GPX4. In addition, FSP1-CoQ10
  and GCH1-BH4 are two parallel GSH-independent pathways involved in the suppression
  of ferroptosis
