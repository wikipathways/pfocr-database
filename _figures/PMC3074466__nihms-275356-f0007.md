caption: 'Upper half: Overexpression of IFNα activates myeloid DC (mDC) to increase
  BAFF production. This increased BAFF production further activates mDC and promotes
  increased B cell survival and activation, the latter leading to increased B cell
  responses to endogenous and/or exogenous TLR ligands. Collectively, this results
  in production of IL-6 and other proinflammatory cytokines and culminate in exaggerated
  disease. Lower half: Overexpression of IFNα directly activates both mDC and B cells.
  Such activation does not require BAFF as an intermediary, but a distinct BAFF-driven
  pathway in parallel must be present for exaggerated disease to develop.'
