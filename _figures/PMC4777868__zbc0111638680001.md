caption: 'Overview of flavonoid biosynthesis. The phenylpropanoid pathway leads to
  the synthesis of flavonoids. These encompass a number of different compounds, not
  all of which are indicated in this scheme. Enzymes leading to the synthesis of flavonols
  (kaempferol, quercetin, isorhamnetin) are indicated. TT (transparent testa) proteins
  were identified based on the pale brown phenotype of seeds of corresponding mutant
  lines. FLS1: flavonol synthase 1, the predominant FLS protein in Arabidopsis. UGTs:
  UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases needed for the glycosylation of flavonols.'
