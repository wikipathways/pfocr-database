caption: Working model for cocaine-recruited signaling axis that broadens t-LTP timing
  window in the PFC. A, Opening of the classical coincidence detector GluN2A-NMDARs
  alone without the need for activating D1-cAMP/PKA-LTCC pathway is sufficient to
  drive t-LTP within the normal timing window. B, Repeated cocaine exposure sensitizes
  D1 DA receptors, elevates cAMP/PKA signaling, and recruits downstream voltage-gated
  LTCCs, which then synergizes with GluN2A-NMDARs to drive t-LTP induction at +30
  ms, a normally ineffective timing interval. Key pharmacological agents used in this
  study are indicated in parentheses.
