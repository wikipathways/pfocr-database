caption: 'Altered amino acid metabolism and potential drugs in DLBCL. Glutamine is
  transported by glutamine transporters and then converted into glutamate by GLS.
  SIRT3 stimulates glutamine dissolution by activating GDH to increase α-KG production,
  which leads to enhancement of the TCA cycle and thereby generates more ATP to support
  tumor growth. IDO is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes tryptophan to Kyn and
  kynurenic acid, which are considered immunosuppressive. PRMT5 promotes transcription
  of MYC. MYC activates GLS and glutamine transporters. HBP activates the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. The HBP inhibitor azaserine in DLBCL cells can inhibit the activation of
  NF-κB, and thereby induce cell arrest and apoptosis. BPTES is a selective allosteric
  regulator of GLS1 that attenuates the growth of lymphoma xenografts and delays MYC-driven
  tumor proliferation. Another GLS inhibitor, CB-839 inhibits the conversion of glutamine
  to glutamate. Kyn, catalyzed by IDO1 from tryptophan, is considered immunosuppressive.
  Molecules in red represent upregulation in DLBCL. GLS: glutaminase; SIRT3: NAD-dependent
  deacetylase sirtuin-3; PRMT5: protein arginine methyltransferase-5; HBP: the hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; TCA: tricarboxylic acid; GDH:
  glutamate dehydrogenase; α-KG: α-ketoglutarate; Kyn: kynurenine; NF-κB: nuclear
  factor kappa-B'
