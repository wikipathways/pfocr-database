caption: Deregulated pathways and genes correlated with regeneration and neural features.
  (A) KEGG analysis highlighted 48 deregulated pathways for regenerative processes.
  (B,C) Pathview of neurotrophins signaling pathway and axon guidance, respectively.
  In red, upregulated genes are shown, whereas in green, downregulated ones are shown.
  (D) KEGG analysis of neural features highlighted 10 deregulated pathways. The y-axis
  represents the name of the pathway, the x-axis represents the Rich factor, dot size
  represents the number of different genes, and the color indicates the adjusted p-value.
