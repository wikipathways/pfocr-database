caption: Predicted mechanism by which remofuscin extends the C. elegans lifespan.
  A lysosomal lipase, LIPL-1, activates lipid catabolism, similar to that in a diet
  restriction (DR)-like state, thereby decreasing the ROS levels and subsequently
  activating the xenobiotic detoxification process. This sequence ultimately extends
  the lifespan of remofuscin-treated C. elegans. The broken line shows the predicted
  route based on the previously reported pathway.
