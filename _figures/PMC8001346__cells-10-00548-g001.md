caption: Interactions between endothelial cells and pericytes via secretory actions.
  (1) TGF-β could be produced by both pericytes and endothelial cells, mainly mediating
  differentiation of pericytes and endothelial cells. It also activates proliferation
  of endothelial cells; (2) angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) from PCs and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2)
  from ECs could combine Tie-2 in ECs (although a low level of Tie2 expression has
  been detected in pericytes, only a mild physiological phenotype was found after
  deletion of Tie-2 in PCs. The role of Ang-1/Tie-2 signal in pericytes still remains
  controversial); (3) VEGF, mainly derived from mesenchymal cells (pericytes), is
  responsible for differentiation into pericytes. Similar to TGF-β, it could also
  trigger proliferation of ECs. VEGF ligands include VEGF-A, B, C, D, E and receptors
  mainly include VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Normally, VEGFR1 binds to VEGF-A and B, while
  VEGFR2 binds to VEGF-A, C, D, and E; (4) PDGF-B, derived from endothelial cells,
  is found in angiogenic sprouts and remodeling arteries. It triggers migration and
  proliferation of pericytes via combination with PDGFR-β; (5) sphingosine-1-phosphate
  (S1P) is expressed in endothelial cells. Its signaling pathway strengthens the contacts
  between endothelial cells and N-cadherin, which induces migration of pericytes toward
  endothelial cells and further stabilizes the combination of two cells.
