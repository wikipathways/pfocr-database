caption: Cartoon highlighting prominent metabolic processes, proteins, and protein
  complexes of the plant cytosol. Components were selected based on the proteomic
  data outlined in supplementary material of . The number of proteins contributing
  to each of these components is shown in brackets. This information was obtained
  from Plant Metabolic Network resource () and from MapMan pathway dataset for Arabidopsis
  (). Collectively, over 2,600 proteins can be assigned to the Arabidopsis cytosol
  when considering proteomics studies, localization with fluorescent proteins and
  functional curation.
