caption: Illustration showing presumed mechanisms mediating SAHA-induced autophagy
  and its regulation by p53. (A) Acetylated p53 primarily induces apoptosis and nuclear
  p53 is able to induce basic autophagy by transcriptionally upregulating TSC2, AMPK,
  and DRAM thereby suppressing mTOR and the ULK1 complex further downstream in MES-SA
  cells. DRAM upregulation or ATG5 upregulation by the p53-family members, p63 and
  p73 which can compensate for p53 could besides autophagy also mediate apoptosis;
  (B) Concurrently, cytoplasmic p53 protein inhibits autophagic cell death by inducing
  Beclin-1 degradation and/or inhibiting the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway. It
  is unclear whether p63 and/or p73 possibly possess transcription-independent regulating
  functions for autophagy. Dashed line with arrowhead, deacetylating activity of HDAC;
  Line with arrowhead (HDACi SAHA), activity of SAHA preventing deacetylation; Fork
  symbols, transcriptional or enzymatic inhibition by indicated proteins; Arrowlines,
  transcriptional or enzymatic upregulation or activation by indicated proteins, respectively;
  Double arrow, major pathway activity.
