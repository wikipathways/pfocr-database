caption: The mechanism by which TM contributes to eotaxin-2-mediated apoptosis in
  monocytic cells. TM may regulate cell apoptosis via the PI3K/Akt axis signaling
  pathway, which acts as an extinguisher for p53 and BAX activation, as well as further
  downstream cytochrome c release and caspase 8 and 3 cleavage. The interaction between
  TM and cofilin further supported a role for TM in cell apoptosis.
