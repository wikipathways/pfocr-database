caption: Effect of the R. solanacearum virulence pathway on symbiosis and proposed
  model for the HrpG-dependent control of root hair and nodule cell entry. (a) PrhARIJ-based
  plant cell contact activation of hrpG (symbolized in green) involves a constitutive
  and ubiquitous component of the cell wall and thus likely occurs in the infection
  site and within the IT, where bacteria are in contact with the root hair wall and
  the IT wall, respectively. HrpG post-transcriptional modification and activation
  of hrpB transcription (symbolized in red) by an unidentified environmental metabolic
  signal(s) (; ; ) likely occurs in the IT apoplastic medium. No link between the
  sensor histidine kinase VsrA and HrpG has been evidenced so far. Mutation effects
  on symbiotic properties symbolized by orange lines were previously shown (), while
  effects symbolized by blue lines were evidenced in this study. The thickness of
  the line symbolizes the strength of the interference. (b) In the root hair curl
  , the prh cascade is activated, blocking early entry and nodulation. Nodulation
  occurs with either a T3SS, hrpG or prh cascade mutant. Within cell-wall-bound ITs
  , the prh cascade, the hrpB transcription and the post-transcriptional modification
  of HrpG are induced, blocking intracellular infection. Intracellular infection occurs
  with either a hrpG or a double T3SS and prh cascade mutant. In this latter double
  mutant, activation of the 184 HrpG-controlled genes via post-transcriptional modification
  of HrpG may not be sufficient to block intracellular infection. DMI2 and the DMI3
  interacting protein IPD3, which are part of the plant signaling pathway induced
  by rhizobial Nod factors, are involved in nodule and IT formation and have a role
  in symbiosome formation. B, bacteria; cw, cell wall; mb, membrane; Sb, symbiosome.
