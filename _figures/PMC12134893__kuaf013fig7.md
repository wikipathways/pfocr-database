caption: 'Discovery of the fungal UbiA prenyltransferase, ColA, and application for
  biosynthesis of THCCA. (a) The fungal biosynthetic gene cluster containing ColA,
  and metabolic analysis of heterologous expression of col gene cluster in A. nidulans.
  (ATR domains: adenylation-thiolation-reductase). The control trace is the metabolic
  analysis of the A. nidulans expressing empty vectors. From the metabolic analysis
  of A. nidulans expressing genes colABC, the transformation produced compounds with
  equivalent MWT to colletorin D, colletorin B and ilicicolin B. (b) The proposed
  biosynthetic pathway of the colletorin products; (c) Metabolic analysis of heterologous
  expression of ColA with Ma_OvaABC and THCAS in yIO02. Two new metabolites with MWT
  304 and 302 are produced, which were NMR verified to be CBGCA and ∆9–THCCA, respectively.
  A third metabolite with MWT of 302 is proposed to be CBGOA'
