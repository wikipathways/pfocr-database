caption: 100% 2-13C glycerol ILE shows that glycine and serine are predominantly synthesized
  from glyoxylate rather than 3-phosphoglycerate. Feeding 2-13C glycerol to Pt confirmed
  the MPA prediction that the MIDs of glycine and serine do not represent the labeling
  of 3-phosphoglycerate as is usual in many organisms. Were this the case, the majority
  of the 13C label from 2-13C glycerol would appear on the C-2 of glycine and serine,
  contradicting observation. The observed isotope labeling patterns in serine and
  glycine can be explained as follows. First, 2-13C glycerol is metabolized to pyruvate
  and alanine. Carbon rearrangements in the TCA cycle (gray) and back-mixing through
  anaplerotic reactions and the pentose phosphate pathway account for the small amount
  of label on alanine{1}. As 3-phosphoglycerate and pyruvate are closely linked to
  one-another, their MID’s are assumed to be identical. The high abundance of the
  glycine{12} and serine{123} result from the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA
  and glyoxylate. Aminotransferases convert glyoxylate to glycine, which then combines
  with MTHF to form serine via SHMT. A linear combination of the fluxes from alanine
  to serine and (glycine + MTHF) to serine produced a set of isotopomers that exactly
  matched the measured values when the SHMT reaction contributed 91% of the total
  flux and phosphoserine transaminase contributed 9% of the flux. Arrow widths correspond
  to relative fluxes. See text for isotopomer notation.
