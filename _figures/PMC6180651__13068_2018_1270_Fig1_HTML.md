caption: A schematic diagram of the astaxanthin and β-ionone synthesis pathways. The
  complex astaxanthin synthesis pathway comprises two enzymes, β-carotene ketolase
  (CrtW) and β-carotene hydroxylase (CrtZ), which perform four interchangeable reactions
  initiated from β-carotene, the substrate of the reaction
