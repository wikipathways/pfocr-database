caption: 'Implication of miR-21-5p and miR-214-5p in regulation of signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway. A: Normal endometrial epithelial
  cells produce a high amount of exosomes enriched in miR-12-5p and miR-214-5p, followed
  by adaptation by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). MiR-21-5p and miR-214-5p then
  stably connect with the 3’-untranslated region of signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3), inducing the mRNA degradation. This event is directly
  associated with the total absence or low expression of STAT3, blocking MSC migration
  and differentiation; B: Hypoxic damaged-endometrial epithelial cells are responsible
  for exosome production with low content of miR-21-5p and miR-214-5p. The absence
  of the aforementioned miRNAs induces proper mRNA transcription and STAT3 production.
  Eventually, p-STAT3 is translocated to the MSC nucleus, thus enhancing the migratory
  and differentiation capacity of the cells. EEC: Endometrial epithelial cell; MSC:
  Mesenchymal stromal cell; STAT3: Signal transducer and activator of transcription
