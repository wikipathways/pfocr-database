caption: Model of the role of the WRNIP1-mediated response in counteracting R-loop-associated
  genome instability in cells with a dysfunctional ATR checkpoint. Following aphidicolin-induced
  mild replication stress in wild-type cells, proficient R-loop resolution allows
  proper replication fork progression, thus, ensuring genome integrity. Conversely,
  a defective ATR checkpoint causes R-loop persistence leading to TRCs. In this context,
  WRNIP1 could stabilise RAD51 at R-loops or R-loop-dependent stalled forks and contribute
  to the activation of the ATM pathway to repair downstream DSBs derived from the
  active processing of R-loops and collisions with the forks. Therefore, a dual function
  of WRNIP1 is required for proper maintenance of genome stability in the pathological
  contexts deriving from a dysfunctional ATR-dependent checkpoint.

  description: Model of the role of the WRNIP1-mediated response in counteracting
    R-loop-associated genome instability in cells with a dysfunctional ATR checkpoint.
    Following aphidicolin-induced mild replication stress in wild-type cells, proficient
    R-loop resolution allows proper replication fork progression, thus, ensuring genome
    integrity. Conversely, a defective ATR checkpoint causes R-loop persistence leading
    to TRCs. In this context, WRNIP1 could stabilise RAD51 at R-loops or R-loop-dependent
    stalled forks and contribute to the activation of the ATM pathway to repair downstream
    DSBs derived from the active processing of R-loops and collisions with the forks.
    Therefore, a dual function of WRNIP1 is required for proper maintenance of genome
    stability in the pathological contexts deriving from a dysfunctional ATR-dependent
    checkpoint.
