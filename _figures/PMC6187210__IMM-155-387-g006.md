caption: The pathological mechanism of low‐molecular‐mass hyaluronan (LMMHA) (200
  000 MW) induces pulmonary inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) neutrophils.
  Intratracheal administration of LMMHA induced significantly increased levels of
  inflammatory factors, resulted in activation of phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K)
  signalling pathway and markedly augmented phosphorylation of Akt1 in neutrophils
  of BALF. Further, the expression of the anti‐apoptotic protein Mcl‐1 was significantly
  increased in BALF neutrophils, adversely, the caspase‐3 activity was inhibited,
  which delayed the apoptosis of neutrophils during LMMHA‐induced pulmonary inflammation.
