caption: Targeting GBM CSC-mediated chemo/radio resistance by small molecule inhibitors.
  GBM CSCs express higher amount of MGMT, which repairs the DNA damage caused by temozolomide.
  Increased expression of ABC transporters facilitates drug efflux to confer chemoresistance.
  Radiation kills the cells largely by DNA damage. GBM CSCs overexpress DNA damage
  repair proteins Rad17, CHK1 and CHK2 to facilitate the repair of radiation-induced
  DNA damage and imparts RR. In addition, cell surface adhesion molecule L1CAM activates
  early DDR and confers RR in GBM CSCs by nuclear translocation of intracellular domain
  of L1CAM (L1-ICD) followed by c-Myc upregulation and increased expression of NBS1,
  which is one of the core protein in the MRN (MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1) complex. MRN
  complex is known to activate early DNA damage checkpoint response through activation
  of ATM kinase. Small molecule inhibitors such as GO eradicate GBM CSCs by selectively
  targeting CSCs signaling pathways such as Wnt, Notch and Stat3. Cyclopamine, celecoxib
  and gamma secretase inhibitor RO4929097 target CSCs by affecting SHH, Wnt and Notch
  pathway, respectively. DSF eliminates CSCs by inhibiting ALDH activity and the NF-κB
  pathway. Likewise, metformin and sorafenib eradicates GBM CSCs by inhibiting Akt
  signaling pathways. IR, ionizing radiation; RR, radioresistance; GSI, γ secretase
  inhibitors; NBS1, Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated;
  ***small molecule inhibitors; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; dotted arrow indicates
  possible effects.
