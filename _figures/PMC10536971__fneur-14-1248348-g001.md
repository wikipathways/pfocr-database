caption: The synthesis pathway of BDNF. The primary sequence of pre-pro-BDNF is divided
  into functionally active isoforms of pro-domain, pro-BDNF, and m-BDNF, each of which
  exhibits specific affinity for a particular type of receptor. M-BDNF binds with
  high affinity to the TrkB receptor, and pro-BDNF is secreted as a functional protein
  that binds to the p75 NTR-sortilin receptor complex. The Val66Met polymorphism of
  BDNF can alter the structure of the pro-domain, modulate neuronal morphology, and
  induce the retraction of neuronal growth cones.
