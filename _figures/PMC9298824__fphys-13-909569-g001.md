caption: Schematic depicting the relationship between dysfunctional mitochondria and
  inflammation. In DKD, there are serious mitochondrial dysfunction and mtDNA leakage,
  which could directly activate NLRP3 inflammasome and AIM2 inflammasome. Additionally,
  mtDNA could be sensed by cGAS to catalyze ATP and GTP into the second messenger
  cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). And then cGAMP binds to STING and translocation of the Golgi
  apparatus to initiate IRF3 and canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, mtDNA
  activates TLR9/NF-κB signaling pathway by binding to TLR9, which results in the
  production of inflammatory cytokines.
