caption: A schematic showing the proposed signaling pathways in type II cells activated
  by neurochemicals at the carotid body sensory synapse. During acute hypoxia (or
  acid hypercapnia) type I cells depolarize and release several neurochemicals, e.g.,
  ATP, ACh, angiotensin II, endothelin-1, 5-HT, dopamine, and histamine. It is possible
  that some of these are more relevant after exposures to chronic or intermittent
  hypoxia. Paracrine activation of several of the corresponding G protein-coupled
  receptors shown on the elongated type II cell causes a rise in intracellular Ca2+,
  presumably mediated via the PLC-IP3 signaling pathway. However, in some cases, e.g.,
  dopamine receptor (not shown) and histamine receptor activation, the response may
  be an inhibition of Ca2+signaling. The rise in intracellular Ca2+ in turn leads
  to opening of pannexin-1 (Panx-1) channels, which act as conduits for the further
  release of ATP. Extracellular ATP may act on excitatory P2X receptors on the nerve
  terminal or may be broken down to ADP, AMP, and adenosine by a series of surface-located
  nucleotidases, i.e., NTPDase2,3 and ecto-5′-nucleotidase (E5′Nt). Adenosine can
  further contribute to purinergic signaling by acting on excitatory A2 receptors
  on type I cells and the sensory nerve terminal. For clarity, the model does not
  show the normally close relationship between type I and type II cells. The labels
  M1/2, H1/2/3, P2Y2, 5-HT2a, ETA/B, and AT1 refer to metabotropic receptors for the
  ligands ACh, histamine, ATP, 5-HT, endothelin-1, and angiotensin II, respectively.
