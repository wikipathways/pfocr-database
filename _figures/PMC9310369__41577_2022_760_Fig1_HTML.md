caption: Various mitochondrial components and products that are released as a consequence
  of mitochondrial dysfunction (and potentially cell death) drive inflammatory responses
  upon accumulation in the cytosol or the extracellular environment. Mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA), which can exit mitochondria via BCL-2-associated X, apoptosis regulator
  (BAX) and BCL-2 antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1) pores or via the permeability transition
  pore complex (PTPC), is a potent activator of cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), resulting
  in stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (STING1) signalling and
  consequent synthesis of cytokines such as interferon-β1 (IFNβ1), IL-6 and tumour
  necrosis factor (TNF). Cytosolic mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) has similar effects,
  although they depend on retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I), melanoma
  differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and mitochondrial antiviral signalling
  protein (MAVS). This pathway is promoted by the BAX–BAK1-dependent release of Era-like
  12S mitochondrial rRNA chaperone 1 (ERAL1), which favours MAVS stabilization at
  the mitochondrial surface. Moreover, upon release from dysfunctional mitochondria,
  both mtDNA and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can drive IL-1β and IL-18 secretion
  as a consequence of inflammasome signalling. Electron transport chain (ETC) functions
  also seem to affect inflammasome activation independently of ROS as they preserve
  intracellular ATP availability through phosphocreatine (PCr). ATP can be released
  by dying cells through lysosomal secretion and pannexin 1 (PANX1) channels, mediating
  both chemotactic and immunostimulatory effects on antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
  by binding to the purinergic receptors P2RX7 and P2RY2. Upon BAX–BAK1 oligomerization
  during apoptosis, diablo IAP-binding mitochondrial protein (DIABLO; best known as
  SMAC) release not only favours caspase activation (not shown) but also rewires NF-κB
  signalling from canonical to non-canonical programmes. Along similar lines, mtDNA
  (be it naked or complexed with the mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM) and
  N-formyl peptides (other mitochondrial components), which accumulate in the extracellular
  milieu upon regulated cell death, cause neutrophil activation via Toll-like receptor
  9 (TLR9) or advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor (AGER) and formyl
  peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), respectively. Finally, extracellular cardiolipin (which
  is normally restricted to the inner mitochondrial membrane) can be presented by
  dendritic cells (DCs) on the MHC class I-like molecule CD1d, resulting in the activation
  of γδ T cells. DAMP, damage-associated molecular pattern; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  IKK, IκB kinase; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; NIK (official name MAP3K14),
  mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1;
