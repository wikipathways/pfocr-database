caption: Cartoon depicting the major pathway by which a pancreatic beta cell secretes
  insulin in response to increases in plasma glucose. The various pathways that originate
  from GLP-1R activation and converge to potentiate glucose stimulated insulin secretion
  are depicted. See text for a full description.
