caption: 'The interaction and materials based on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
  to target immune cells. (A) CD8+ T cells induce tumor cell apoptosis mainly through
  the release of cytokines and the exocytosis of granules containing perforin and
  granzyme. Hydrogel, a type of nanoparticle (NP), loaded with antigens can activate
  CD8+ T cells indirectly with the help of macrophages expressing toll-like receptors
  (TLRs). In addition, lipid NPs loaded with siRNA could specifically block the M2-marker
  expression of TAMs and lead to decreased expression of PD-1. (B) TAMs expressing
  major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) present tumor antigens and activate
  CD4+ T cells with T cell receptor (TCR). There are two ways to fully boost CD4+
  T cells, one of which is modulating MHC-II expression by epigenetic silencing with
  chromatin modifiers, including S. crispus leaves (F3), that can inhibit CIITA transcription;
  the other is enhancing antigens presentation and MHC-II pathway by iron oxide NPs.
  (C) Regulatory B (Breg) cells secrete interleukin‐10 (IL‐10) and transforming growth
  factor‐β (TGF‐β), decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion of TAMs, which
  modulate the biological behavior of tumors. Since CD169+ macrophages capture antigens
  and present to B cell receptor (BCR) on B cells, liposomal NPs with glycan ligands
  were preferentially phagocytized to modulate B cells indirectly. Anti-CD40 antibodies
  acted on CD40-CD40L pathways with a greater upregulation of anti-tumor activity.
  (D) TAMs transfer antigens to dendritic cells (DCs) by CD169 for immunotherapy.
  Since TLRs exist on both DCs and TAMs, TLR agonists could enhance antigens presentation
  of DCs and pro-inflammation cytokines’ secretion of TAMs, leading to the immunostimulatory
  tumor microenvironment (TME). Via the increase of cytokines, such as IL-15, anti-MARCO
  antibodies activate natural killer (NK) cells. Back arrows: promotion; Red “T” arrows:
  inhibition.'
