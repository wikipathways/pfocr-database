caption: "Molecular pathway of CREB-BDNF activation. Signals due to various stimuli
  arrive at the cell membrane and activates the corresponding receptors. This results
  in the activation of downstream signalling cascades and generation of second messengers
  which activates protein kinase. PKA translocates to the nucleus and causes phosphorylation
  of CREB, which then binds with the CRE region resulting in the transcription of
  genes such as BDNF and c-fos. BDNF binds with TrkB receptors and further enhances
  the phosphorylation of CREB. AC: Adenyl cyclase; AKT: Protein kinase B BDNF: Brain
  derived neurotrophic factor; CAM: Calmodulin; cAMP: Cyclic adenosine monophosphate;
