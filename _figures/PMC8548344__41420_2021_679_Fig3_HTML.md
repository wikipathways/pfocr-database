caption: Shh inhibitors, including cerulenin and itraconazole, play a potent suppressing
  role on carcinogenesis-associated inflammation by downregulating IL-6, IL-6-associated
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling, and NF-κB-related
  TNF-α. Moreover, Shh inhibitors induce apoptosis by elevating cleaved caspase-3
  and exert an anti-proliferating effect by elevating 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase
  (15-PGDH), a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-degrading and tumour-suppressive enzyme. This
  subsequently inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In addition, activation of Hh signalling
  by TNF-α/NF-κB-generated overexpression of the histone demethylase, JMJD2D, can
  be impaired by DSS or AOM/DSS and promotes tumourigenesis and CAC metastasis. Blue
  lines indicate evidence from two separate studies. Arrows, blunt ends, and dotted
  lines indicate activation, inhibition, and indirect regulatory effects, respectively.
