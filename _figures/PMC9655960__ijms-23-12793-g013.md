caption: Hypothetical model showing the overexpression of ZmPRMT1 results in improved
  resistance under heat stress in Arabidopsis involving proline metabolism pathway.
  The pathway of proline metabolism. Glu glutamic acid, GSA glutamate-1-semi-aldehyde,
  P5C pyrroline-5-carboxylate, P5CS1 delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase1, P5CR
  pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, P5CDH delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase,
  ProDH proline dehydrogenase. Overexpression of ZmPRMT1 in Arabidopsis leads to upregulation
  of the expression levels of P5CS1 and P5CR gene in proline synthesis pathway while
  downregulation of the expression levels of P5CDH and PDH gene in the proline degradation
  pathway. Finally, proline accumulation increased. H4R3sme2 is one of the possible
  targets for ZmPRMT1 to function. The upregulation of gene expression levels is represented
  by red font, whereas downregulation of gene expression levels is represented by
  green font. The arrows indicate positive modulation, and the “T” bars indicate negative
  modulation. The dashed lines represent assumed interactions.
