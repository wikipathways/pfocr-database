caption: A proposed mechanism for thrombin-stimulated glioblastoma cell proliferation.
  Stimulation of G12/13-coupled PAR1 receptor with thrombin results in sustained Rap1
  activation through RhoA and PLD. Active Rap1-induces formation of a complex containing
  RIAM and talin, resulting in talin recruitment to integrins and consequent inside-out
  β1 integrin activation, which stimulates integrin signaling to activate FAK and
  ERK1/2. Rap1 also interacts with B-Raf to activate ERK signaling, through an already
  established pathway (light arrows). The downstream result of this pathway is enhanced
  glioblastoma cell proliferation.
