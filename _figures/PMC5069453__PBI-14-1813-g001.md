caption: The biosynthetic pathway of stilbene compounds from sucrose as carbon source.
  The conversion of sucrose carbon into stilbenoids in grapevine cells involves several
  pathways from primary metabolism, that is glycolysis, pentose phosphate shunt and
  shikimate, to produce the amino acid phenylalanine as precursor of all polyphenolic
  compounds, and secondary metabolism, that is phenyl propanoid, to produce 4‐coumaroyl
  CoA as precursor of stilbenoids (Langcake and Pryce, ). The action of STS leads
  to the production of resveratrol as major stilbenoid, which is strongly induced
  (red dotted lines) under elicitation conditions with methylated β‐cyclodextrin (MBCD)
  and methyl jasmonate (MeJA). In transformed grapevine cell lines with either Vv
  ROMT or Hs CYP1B1 (green arrows), resveratrol is converted into methylated (pterostilbene)
  or hydroxylated (piceatannol) derivate, respectively. STS, stilbene synthase; Vv
  ROMT, resveratrol O‐methyltransferase from Vitis vinifera; Hs CYP1B1, human Cytochrome
  P450 hydroxylase 1B1.
