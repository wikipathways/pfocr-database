caption: Pointed and blunt arrows indicate activation and inhibition, respectively.
  Both Sick and Dredd are required for translocation of Rel to the nucleus and for
  activation of Dipt expression and they are consequently positioned upstream of Rel
  as activators. In the absence of Sick or Dredd, Dnr1 function is not needed to maintain
  pathway quiescence. Thus, Dnr1 is ordinarily required to either inhibit Sick and
  Dredd functions or to negate their actions, and we have indicated these regulators
  as being downstream of Dnr1 (A). Although we have no epistatic data that separates
  the action of Sick and Dredd, Dredd appears to directly cleave Rel and is hence
  likely to be immediately upstream of Rel. Sick might function in conjunction with
  Dredd or as an activator of Dredd. Since dnr1 RNAi does not enhance the response
  to LPS, we suggest that its inhibitor activity is either repressed or bypassed upon
  exposure to LPS. Consequently, we have shown that treatment with LPS counteracts
  Dnr1-dependent Dredd inhibition (B). We do not mean to preclude other actions of
  LPS that might contribute to induction, but it is notable that inactivation of Dnr1
  is sufficient to activate signaling. Finally, we have shown that Dnr1 levels are
  affected by Dredd, and we have indicated this with a positive feedback arrow.
