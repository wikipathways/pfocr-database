caption: Hypothesised model of the impact of cAMP modulation in the cumulus-oocyte
  complex on oocyte energy production. Oocyte meiotic resumption and pharmacological
  cAMP upregulation via pre-IVM generate AMP from cAMP in cumulus cells which can
  be used via the adenosine salvage pathway to regenerate ATP in the oocyte. Upregulation
  of cAMP in the cumulus-oocyte complex leads to a decrease in intra-oocyte ATP, decreasing
  the ATP:ADP ratio and upregulating AMPK protein expression to restrain energy depletion.
  Pre-IVM also increases COC ATP by stimulating cumulus cell glycolysis. TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase.
