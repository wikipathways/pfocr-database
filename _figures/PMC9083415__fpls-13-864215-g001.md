caption: The senescence-associated kinases functioned in hormones-regulated leaf senescence.
  The kinases are marked with red; arrows show that the process is promoted, and T-bars
  mean the process is inhibited; the solid lines indicate direct reported relationship,
  and the dotted lines indicate indirect reported relationship; the orange circles
  indicate phosphorylation. ET, ethylene; ABA, abscisic acid; JA, jasmonic acid; SA,
  salicylic acid; BR, brassinosteroids; SL, strigolactone; CK, cytokinins; ETR1, ethylene
  response 1, it is one of the five ET receptors; ERS1, ethylene response sensor 1,
  one of ET receptors; CTR1, constitutive triple response 1, homologous to the RAF
  family of serine/threonine protein kinases, a negative regulator in the ethylene
  signal transduction pathway, it interacts with the putative ethylene receptors ETR1
  and ERS1; EIN2, ethylene insensitive 2, it acts downstream of CTR1 to regulate EIN3
  positively; EIN3, ethylene-insensitive 3, a nuclear transcription factor that initiates
  downstream transcriptional cascades for ethylene responses; ORE1, ORESARA 1, it
  is a NAC-domain transcription factor and regulates senescence in leaves positively;
  SAGs, senescence associated genes; EDR1, enhanced disease resistance 1, a RAF family
  of serine/threonine protein kinases like CTR1, it has a negative role in ET signal
  pathway; PYLs, pyrabactin resistance 1-like family proteins, function as the ABA
  receptors; PP2Cs, the type 2C protein phosphatases, function as ABA co-receptors;
  SnRK2s, sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 family proteins, they
  are activated by ABA and inhibited by PP2Cs; ABFs, ABA responsive element binding
  factor proteins, as leucine zipper transcription factors that bind to the ABA-responsive
  element (ABRE) motifs in the promoter region of ABA-inducible genes; RAV1, related
  to ABI3/VP1 1, an AP2/B3 domain transcription factor which is upregulated in ABA-induced
  leaf senescence; COI1, coronatine insensitive 1, JA receptor, it associates with
  AtCUL1, AtRbx1, and the Skp1-like proteins to assemble SCFCOI1 ubiquitin-ligase
  complexes; JAZ1, jasmonate-zim-domain protein 1, it is degraded by SCFCOI1 ubiquitin-ligase
  complexes under JA stimulus; MYC2, MYC-related transcriptional activator 2; ANACs,

  BRI1, BR insensitive 1, encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat
  receptor kinase, as BR receptor; BAK1, BRI1-associated receptor kinase, as the BR
  co-receptor with BRI1, it is a leucine-rich receptor serine/threonine protein kinase;
  BSK1, BR-signaling kinase 1; CDG1, constitutive differential growth 1, is a receptor-like
  cytoplasmic kinase, belongs to RLCKVII subfamily; BSU1, BRI1 suppressor 1, encodes
  a serine-threonine protein phosphatase; BIN2, brassinosteroid-insensitive 2, a member
  of the ATSK (shaggy-like kinase) family; BES1, BRI1-EMS-suppressor 1, a key transcription
  factor involved in BR signaling, coordinates plant growth and stress responses;
  D14, is a receptor in the SL signaling pathway; SCFD3, as a member of the F-box
  leucine-rich repeat family of proteins, they are involved in SCF-dependent protein
  ubiquitination; D53, interacts with D14 in an SL-dependent manner, and it is shown
  to be degraded through the 26S proteasome pathway in a manner that requires the
  function of the F-box protein D3; AHKs, Arabidopsis histidine kinases, CK receptors,
  including AHK2, AHK3, and AHK4; HPs, histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins;
  ARRs, Arabidopsis response regulators, including type-A and type-B ARR; TIR1, transport
  inhibitor response 1, encodes an auxin receptor, it contains leucine-rich repeats
  and an F-box and forms SCF (Skp-Cullin-F-box) complexes with ASK1 and CUL1; AUX/IAA,
  repressors of auxin-responsive transcription; ARFs, auxin-response factors; SAUR,
  small auxin upregulated RNA; SSPP, senescence suppressed protein phosphatase; SARK,
