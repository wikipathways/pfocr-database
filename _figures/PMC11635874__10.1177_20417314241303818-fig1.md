caption: 'TGF-β signaling in bone. TGF-β binds to a tetrameric receptor complex consisting
  of two TGF-β type I receptors (TβRI) and two type II receptors (TβRII). The binding
  of TGF-β to TβRII leads to the transphosphorylation of TβRI, resulting in the activation
  of downstream signaling pathways. There are two main signaling pathways activated
  by TGF-β: the Smad-dependent pathway and the non-Smad-dependent pathway. In the
  Smad-dependent pathway, the phosphorylated R-Smad (Smad2 or Smad3) forms a complex
  with Smad4 and translocates into the nuclei. The non-Smad-dependent pathway involves
  the phosphorylation of TAK1, which then recruits TAB1. This initiates a signaling
  cascade involving the activation of MKK-p38 MAPK or MKK-ERK1/2, leading to the regulation
  of gene expression. Figure was reused from Wu et al.9'
