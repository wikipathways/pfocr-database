caption: Diagrammatic representation of occurrence of colorectal cancer (a) and various
  modulatory mechanisms of combinatorial administration of probiotics and celecoxib
  (b) in CRC with respect to different biomarkers. (a) DMH-induced DNA methylation
  activates Wnt pathway which is accelerated by over expression of pro-inflammatory
  markers. Further, presence of harmful bacteria and production of toxic metabolites
  along with reduced pro-apoptotic markers leads to carcinogenesis. (b) Administration
  of probiotics and celecoxib modulate Wnt signaling pathway and ameliorate gut microbiome
  which could lead to reduced inflammation and enhanced apoptotic markers subsequently
  preventing carcinogenesis

  and celecoxib modulate Bax-mediated apoptosis in 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced experimental
  colon carcinogenesis.
