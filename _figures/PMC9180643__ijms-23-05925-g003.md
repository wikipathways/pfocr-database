caption: Cellular functions of monoubiquitination. (a) Mdm2 binds, monoubiquitinates,
  and stabilizes HDAC3, which forms a complex with co-repressors including DNMT and
  NCor1–SMRT to repress the transcription of tumor suppressors p53 and p21. (b) Monoubiquitinated
  RTKs are sorted to the lysosomal compartment, limiting their recycling to the plasma
  membrane. (c) TGF-β binds to its receptors to activate R-SMADs, which form a complex
  with SMAD4. The SMAD complex translocates into the nucleus to regulate target gene
  transcription. Monoubiquitination of SMAD4 blocks its interaction with phospho-SMAD2,
  resulting in inactivation of TGF-β signaling. (d) In response to proapoptotic stimuli,
  mono- and di-ubiquitinated DEDD and caspase-3 aggregate on intermediate filaments,
  leading to activation of caspase-3, cleavage of keratin 18, and collapse of intermediate
  filaments. (e) HLTF mediates PCNA polyubiquitination, and RAD6–RAD18 mediates PCNA
  monoubiquitination. In the presence of HLTF, PCNA monoubiquitination leads to its
  polyubiquitination, which favors the template switching (TS) pathway; in the absence
  of HLTF, monoubiquitinated PCNA triggers the translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway.
