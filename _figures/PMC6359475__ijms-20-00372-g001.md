caption: Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. The extrinsic pathway begins
  outside of a cell and involves the binding of extracellular death ligands to their
  respective transmembrane death receptors. The activation of tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF) receptor superfamily, such as first apoptosis signal (Fas), takes place, leading
  to activation of caspase-8 (initiator caspase) and recruitment of the Fas-associated
  protein with death domain (FADD) adapter molecule. It transduces a downstream signaling
  cascade to the effector caspase (caspase-8), leading to the proteolytic activation
  of caspase-3. In fact, the extrinsic pathway can cause amplification of cascade
  via intrinsic mitochondrial pathway whereby caspase-8 cleaves Bid to promote mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) []. The intrinsic pathway is initiated by
  internal stimuli, such as genetic damage, growth factor deprivation, hypoxia, oxidative
  stress, and flux of calcium ions (Ca2+) []. The stimuli then perceive cell death
  signals via the mitochondrion, which represents the metabolic status of a cell.
  The MOMP is often regarded as the primary step required for activation of caspases.
  Proapoptotic and antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins are involved
  in regulating the permeability of outer mitochondrial membrane [,]. Upon apoptotic
  stimulus, MOMP takes place, leading to the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane
  space. In the cytoplasm, cytochrome c engages apoptotic protease activating factor
  1 (Apaf-1) and eventually leads to the activation of caspase-9 (initiator caspase).
  Following that, caspase-9 activates executioner caspases, such as caspase-3, -6,
  and -7, which subsequently cause the downstream biochemical events, leading to apoptosis
  [].
