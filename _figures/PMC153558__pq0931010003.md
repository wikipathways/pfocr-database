caption: Model of the maternal Radar signaling pathway mediating early steps of dorsoventral
  axis formation. Radar acts through the TGF-β type I receptor Alk8 and causes transcriptional
  activation of BMP2b and BMP4. The intracellular signal transducer, believed to be
  a member of the Smad1/5/8 protein family is not known (indicated in gray), although
  Smad5 may be excluded. Maternal Smad5 may transduce the signal of a hypothesized
  distinct maternal signaling pathway acting in parallel to Radar. Alk8 is also the
  receptor for zygotic BMP2b/7 signaling, and Smad5 transduces that signal, leading
  to the autoregulatory transcriptional activation of BMP2b/4/7.
