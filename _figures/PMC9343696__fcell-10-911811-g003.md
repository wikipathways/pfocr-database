caption: Crosstalk of the CBM complex/NF-κB and MAPK/P27 signaling pathways Tregs
  contributes to the TME. Ligand binding to TCR of Tregs, HIF-1α and IL-6 are produced
  via activating the CBM complex/NF-κB signaling pathway. In turn, Treg proliferation
  and migration are promoted by HIF-1α and IL-6 through the MAPK/CDK4/6/Rb and STAT3/SIAH2/P27
  signaling pathways, respectively.
