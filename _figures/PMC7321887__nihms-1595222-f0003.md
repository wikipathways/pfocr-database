caption: Experimental evidence to date has revealed specific functions of each pathway
  in maintaining β cell health (left), or contributing to β cell pathology when the
  pathways are overactive or otherwise dysfunctional (right). Our understanding of
  crosstalk between these pathways is limited; thus, investigating interactions between
  these pathways under various physiologic conditions will advance our understanding
  of the coordinated β cell response to cellular stress.
