caption: A summary of pathways affected by 5-HTR1E serotonin receptor activation.
  (A) Gαi-mediated RAS-Rap signaling pathway in serotonin (5-HT) induced 5-HTR1E overexpressing
  NIH3T3 mouse cells is shown on the left side. (B) 5-HTR1E-mediated signaling pathway
  which inhibit SRC/ERK/AKT signaling followed by proliferation in ovarian cancer
  cells is depicted on the right side. Created with BioRender.com
