caption: The initial stages of vesicle elongation in macroautophagy. A. Only the initial
  stages are shown, focusing on the seminal role played by Atg7 in the process, where
  it intersects with the two possible pathways. The first pathway (top) occurs through
  the direct interaction of Atg12 with Atg5. This interaction requires the E1-like
  activity of Atg7. The second pathway involves the addition of phosphotidylethanolamine
  (PE, shown lower left) to LC3-I, the mammalian homologue of the yeast protein, Atg8.
  This process is mediated by a protease, Atg4 followed by Atg7’s E1-like enzymatic
  activity to add PE to LC3-I, coupled with the E2-like activity of Atg3. B. Electron
  micrograph of a cardiomyocyte derived from the heart of mouse that overexpresses
  (approximately 10-fold) Atg7. Immediately apparent are elaborated, linear membranes.
  These structures do not affect cardiac function during the animal’s lifetime [].
