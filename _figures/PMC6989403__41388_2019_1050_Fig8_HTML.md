caption: PMEPA1a promotion of tumor progression is mediated by Hippo signaling. PMEPA1a
  promotes tumor growth by facilitating degradation of LATS1, an important tumor suppressor
  protein inhibiting activity of YAP, a transcriptional activator of growth promoting
  genes. In cells overexpressing PMEPA1a, YAP is activated due to the loss of LATS1,
  while PMEPA1a depletion lead to increased YAP phosphorylation at ser-127 and foster
  cytoplasmic sequestration, causing inhibited phenotypes
