caption: (A) Schematic showing the KGFR signalling pathway and target of the pharmacological
  inhibitor. (B) Control (vehicle only) keratinocytes were differentiated in high
  calcium media and lysed after 48 hours. Parallel cultures of E5KO keratinocytes
  were treated with 30 nM of a KGFR kinase inhibitor (PD173074). Lysates were analysed
  for the phosphorylated forms of FRS2α, AKT, GSK3α/β, cytokeratin 1 (K1) and cyclin
  B1 by immunoblot.
