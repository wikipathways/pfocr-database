caption: Effects of nitrogen on rice ShB. The rice ammonium transporter AMT1;1 positively
  regulates rice resistance to ShB. This phenomenon is caused not by ammonium itself,
  but by N-derived metabolites. AMT1;1 enhances the resistance of rice to ShB by promoting
  the accumulation of N metabolites, such as amino acids and chlorophyll, and activating
  the downstream ETH signaling pathway. Amino acid (AA) accumulation can inhibit R.
  solani and promote chlorophyll synthesis, which is a positive regulator of rice
  ShB. A low concentration of NH+4 activates the ETH signal through AMT and a high
  concentration of NH+4 inhibits the ETH signal. ETH signaling positively regulates
  ShB resistance and NH+4 uptake, suggesting that ETH signaling acts downstream of
  AMT and that NH+4 uptake is also under feedback control.
