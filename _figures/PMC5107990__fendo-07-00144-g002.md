caption: A model for TSAb generation triggered by cell damage-derived self-genomic
  DNA. Self-genomic DNA released from damaged thyrocytes (left) enters neighboring
  cells (middle) and induces aberrant expression of MHC class II as well as costimulatory
  molecules needed for the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway in thyrocytes.
  At the same time, cytosolic DNA stimulates thyrocytes to produce various proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines that can recruit and activate helper T cells. CD4+ T cells
  that bind to MHC class II-antigen molecule cause B cell activation. The activated
  B cells then differentiate into plasma cells that may produce functional TRAbs to
  stimulate TSHR on the thyrocytes (right).
