caption: 'Proposed model in which UA activates mammalian target of rapamycin complex
  1 (mTORC1). In several cell models, high UA concentration causes an increase in
  AKT activity and/or a decrease in AMPK activity causing a potentiation of the regulatory
  pathway leading to mTORC1 activation. Activated AKT phosphorylates tuberous sclerosis
  complex 2 (TSC2) leading to the release of the dimer tuberous sclerosis complex
  1/2 (TSC1/TSC2) from the mTORC1 complex. Since the dimer is an activator of the
  GTPase activity of RAS homologous enriched in brain (RHEB), this G-protein binds
  GTP for long time, thereby activating mTORC1. AKT also directly activates mTORC1
  by phosphorylating the mTOR inhibitor proline-rich AKT substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40),
  which is then released from the complex. On the contrary, phosphorylation of TSC2
  by AMPK increases the concentration of the dimer TSC1/TSC2, thus favoring the GTPase
  activity of RHEB and therefore inactivating mTORC1. The inhibitory activity of AMPK
  is also exerted by phosphorylation and consequent release of the mTOR activator
  regulatory associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR). Therefore, activation of AKT and
  inhibition of AMPK cause an increase in mTORC1 activity leading to an increase in
  the rate of synthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleotides, while autophagy is inhibited.
  mTORC1 activation also promotes mitochondria proliferation, producing an increase
  in intracellular ROS, responsible for an increase in cytokines and chemokines production,
  leading to inflammation. : activation; : inhibition; : increase; : decrease.'
