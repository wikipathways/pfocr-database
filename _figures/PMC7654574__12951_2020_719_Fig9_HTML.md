caption: Protein–protein interaction networks of the sirtuin canonical pathway affected
  by AgNPs/CDDP exposure in HepG2 and THLE2 cells. We built functional interaction
  networks of deregulated proteins of each pathway with the STRING algorithm. Lines
  represent interactions and only interactions with medium confidence (score ≥ 0.4)
  are shown. We used the Markov cluster algorithm (MCL) to identify clusters of tightly
  connected proteins within the network. Upregulated proteins in HepG2 cells are light
  red, whereas downregulated proteins are light blue. For THLE2 cells, a dark red
  halo around a protein indicates that the protein is upregulated, whereas a dark
  blue halo indicates that the protein is downregulated
