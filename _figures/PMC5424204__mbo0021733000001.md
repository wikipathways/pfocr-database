caption: Metabolic reactions in C. jejuni containing select amino acid transport and
  catabolic pathways. A simplified schematic of the C. jejuni amino acid transport
  and catabolic pathways whose expression was affected by the acetogenesis pathway
  as presented in this work is shown. Amino acids in red indicate the amino acids
  that are preferred by C. jejuni for optimal in vivo or in vitro growth. Proteins
  in boxes are those required for the associated processes. Proteins in green are
  shown in this work or have been previously shown to be required for commensal colonization
  of the avian intestinal tract or infection of the murine intestinal tract. The acetogenesis
  pathway of C. jejuni is shown on tan background.
