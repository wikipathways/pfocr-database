caption: Schematic model for UAG impact on EPC physiology. The resident bone marrow
  pool of early and late EPCs was mobilized into circulation after UAG-mediated Akt
  activation in stromal cells, which leads to eNOS phosphorylation and MMP9 activation.
  In turn, MMP9 activation switched on the release of sKitL, a determinant for EPC
  exit into the bloodstream. In addition, UAG treatment restores diabetic viability
  of EPCs and increases their vasculogenic capability by preventing ROS generation
  and its downstream signaling pathway (p53 accumulation, p21 expression, Rb phosphorylation).
  This effect results from UAG-mediated inhibition of Rac1 activation, a prerequisite
  for NADPH oxidase assembly. BM, bone marrow compartment; PC, peripheral compartment.
