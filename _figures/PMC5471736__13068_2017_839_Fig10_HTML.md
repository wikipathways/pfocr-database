caption: The distribution and contribution of nitrogen/carbon metabolism for lipid
  metabolism pathway. Black words the metabolic pathways which are related to lipid
  synthesis, gray words the metabolic pathways which are not related to lipid synthesis.
  Blue arrow N flow pathways, red arrow C flow pathways, green arrow N and C flow
  pathways. Solid arrow one step of metabolic flow, dotted arrow more than one step
  of metabolic flow
papertitle: Comparative metabolic profiling of the lipid-producing green microalga
  Chlorella reveals that nitrogen and carbon metabolic pathways contribute to lipid
  metabolism.
