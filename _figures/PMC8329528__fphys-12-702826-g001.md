caption: Schematic representation of mTORC1 signaling pathway. Stimulation by insulin
  ultimately leads to the activation of the PI3K pathway and PIP3 synthesis. PIP3
  activates PDK1, which can then phosphorylate AKT. Activated AKT phosphorylates and
  inactivates the TSC2/1 complex, allowing RHEB to remain GTP loaded to activate mTORC1.
  Activated mTORC1 activates translation machinery and protein synthesis by phosphorylating
  two main downstream targets, S6K1 and 4E-BP1. mTORC1 also inhibits autophagy by
  phosphorylating the ULK1/ATG13 complex. mTORC1 can also be activated through AA
  or BCAA stimulation of the sestrins/gator/RAG/ragulator pathway. Leucine, the most
  commonly studied BCAA, inhibits sestrin-2 leading to eventual GTP loading and RHEB
  activation of mTORC1. Re-drawn and modified from  and . 4E-BP1, eukaryotic mRNA

    PIP3 activates PDK1, which can then phosphorylate AKT. Activated AKT phosphorylates
