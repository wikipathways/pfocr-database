caption: 'Schematic illustration of intracellular and intercellular signaling and
  cellular dynamics in bone healing and bone remodeling. Bone regeneration or bone
  remodeling involves bone resorption by osteoclasts (OC) and the following bone formation
  by osteoblasts (OB) within basic multi-cellular units (BMU). Three cytokines were
  considered: TGFβ, Wnt and BMP2. Intracellular signaling pathway consists of Smad2/3,
  Smad1/5, β-Catenin, and Runx2 and Osx. Runx2 can promote the differentiation of
  mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into pre-osteoblasts (OBp) and can inhibit the differentiation
  of pre-osteoblasts into active osteoblasts (OBa). Osx also play a promoting role
  in the later stage of osteoblastic lineage which interacts with osteoclastic lineage
  through intercellular signaling pathway RANK-RANKL-OPG.'
