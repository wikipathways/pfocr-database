caption: Injury-induced changes in the nociceptive pathway. In neuropathic pain, nociceptive
  pathways are altered at all levels of the central and peripheral nervous systems.
  Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may play a key role in coordinating injury-associated
  nociceptive events as they regulate the inflammatory response and can simultaneously
  act upon elements of the nervous system, including the peripheral nerve (a), the
  DRG (b), and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (c). Rapid effects of these molecules
  can alter the excitability of neurons, and the sensitization of ion channels involved
  in the neuropathic pain mechanism. Slower effects of cytokines include altered gene
  expression, which could the result in the subsequent upregulation of other proinflammatory
  cytokines, and ion channel expression. These events, which occur in many different
  cell types, when taken together result in an altered state of excitability that
  contributes to the chronic pain state. NGF nerve growth factor, NO nitric oxide,
  TNF-α tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β interleukin-1β, TLR Toll-like receptor, ATP
  adenosine triphosphate, TRPV1 transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, CGRP calcitonin
  gene-related peptide, IL-6 interleukin-6, CCR2 C-C chemokine receptor 2, CXCR3 C-X-C
  chemokine receptor 3, CXCR4 C-X-C chemokine receptor 4, MCP-1 monocyte chemotactic
  protein 1, SDF-1 stromal cell derived factor 1, RANTES regulated upon activation,
