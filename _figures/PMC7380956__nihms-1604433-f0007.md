caption: The cardiac recovery in responders following LVAD-induced mechanical unloading
  correlates with an increased flux of glucose into accessory pathways such as pentose
  phosphate pathway and one-carbon metabolism for generation of biomolecules for repair,
  improving extracellular matrix integrity via α-dystroglycan glycosylation and via
  generation of NADPH, which is predominantly used for biosynthesis and less likely
  for reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Also, reduced flux into polyol pathway
  and hexosamine biosynthetic pathway appears to be beneficial.
