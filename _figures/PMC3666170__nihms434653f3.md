caption: Role of Cx43 and Panx1 hemichannels in paracrine signaling in taste transduction.
  In taste buds, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) for bitter, sweet and umami tastents
  are located at the apical membrane of type II receptor cells. Activation of the
  GPCR signaling pathway leads to the production of IP3 and diacyl glycerol (DAG)
  through phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)-mediated cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2). An increase of [Ca2+]i by IP3-induced Ca2+ release opens transient receptor
  potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5). Na+ influx through TRPM5
  channels depolarizes the cell membrane and stimulates voltage-gated Na+ channels,
  promoting the generation of an action potential (AP). Available evidence indicates
  that in response to tastent-evoked membrane depolarization, Cx43/Panx1 hemichannels
  open, facilitating ATP release. Extracellular ATP is thought to function as a neurotransmitter,
  targeting P2X2/P2X3R at postsynaptic afferent nerves. Alternatively, ATP may diffuse
  and bind to P2YR at adjacent presynaptic type III receptor cells. Following elevation
  of [Ca2+]i by IP3, a second taste transmitter 5-HT is secreted from the presynaptic
  cells through vesicular release.
