caption: Schematic drawing summarizing the physiological regulation of the melanocortin
  pathway and pathological findings in the in Ankrd26−/− mice. a Under physiological
  conditions leptin activates STAT3 phosphorylation and POMC is cleaved to α-MSH in
  ARC POMC neurons. α-MSH activates MC4R-expressing CRH-producing neurons in the PVN.
  As a result, appetite is inhibited and the stress axis is activated. The stress
  response is terminated by the negative feedback of CORT. b In Ankrd26−/− mice higher
  leptin levels are accompanied by STAT3 phosphorylation and increase in hypothalamic
  α-MSH. In spite of reduced MC4R mRNA in the PVN and elevated serum CORT levels,
  CRH expression is increased. This is associated with hyperphagia and overactivation
  of the stress pathway in Ankrd26−/− mice. Note, that neurons with MC4 receptors
  that make CRH in the PVN are ciliated. In Ankrd26 knockout mice, these PVN cells
  lack AC3 positive primary cilia (see )
