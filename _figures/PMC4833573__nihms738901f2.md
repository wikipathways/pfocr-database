caption: LGGs arise from mutations in genes whose protein products regulate RAS pathway
  signaling. In this manner, mutations in genes encoding receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTK), which transduce extracellular signals, as well as the downstream effectors
  PTPN11, RAS, BRAF/RAF, and lead to hyperactivation of mitogenic signaling downstream
  through the MAP kinase and PI3-kinase pathways. In addition, mutational inactivation
  of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene results in increased
  RAS activity. MEK and AKT can shorten G1 transition through mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent and -independent signaling. The presence of stromal growth
  factors and chemokines in the tumor microenvironment transduce signals through tumor
  cell receptors and further enhance glioma growth in a paracrine fashion. Reported
  mutations are denoted in green.
