caption: The branched aerobic respiratory chain in Bacillus cereus. (a) Schematic
  representation of the electron transport chain in the cytoplasmic membrane. Menaquinone
  (Q) is reduced to menaquinol (QH2), electrons (e−) are transferred to cytochrome
  caa3, aa3, and cyd terminal oxidases to reduce oxygen to H2O. The resulting electrochemical
  gradient is used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. QH2 provides electrons to cytochrome
  caa3 (green) via cytochrome bc (purple) and cytochrome c (orange). Alternatively,
  electrons from QH2 can be delivered directly to cytochrome aa3 (blue) or cytochrome
  bd (pink) menaquinol oxidases, the latter is not a proton pump. Cytochromes caa3
  and aa3 have four subunits encoded by the ctaCDEF and qoxABCD operons, respectively.
  Subunit I of both enzymes carries the electron-accepting heme a that delivers electrons
  to the active site—composed of heme a3 and a copper center (CuB). (b) Heme a synthesis
  pathway. Heme a synthesis is catalyzed by CtaB and CtaA—heme o and a synthases,
  respectively.
