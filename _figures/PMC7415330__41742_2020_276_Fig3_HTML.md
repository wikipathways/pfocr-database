  the first part of key events (KEs). The initiating event expressed by DAMPs↔PRMs
  interaction (MIE) leads to a sequential cascade of cellular, tissue, and organ responses
  (key events = KEs), linked to each other by key event relationship (KER). DAMP-promoted,
  failing (!) stress responses (KE1–n) result in subroutines of regulated cell death
  (KE2–n) that are associated with release of DAMPs. DAMPs (together with MAMPs in
  case of infectious injury) are sensed by PRMs to trigger activation of innate immune
  cells (KE3–n), which trigger the fourth key event in terms of innate immune inflammatory
  responses. AO adverse outcome, AOP adverse outcome pathway, DAMPs damage-associated
