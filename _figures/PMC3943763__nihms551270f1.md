caption: TLR2 and TLR4 are present on the cell surface and recognize viral proteins.
  TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are intracellular viral nucleic acid sensing TLRs that
  are localized in endosomes. Viral dsRNA, ssRNA, and unmethylated CpG DNA are recognized
  by TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9, respectively. Upon ligand recognition TLR2 along with
  TLR6 or TLR1 and TLR4 recruits an additional adaptor protein, MAL, to link the TIR
  domain to MyD88. All TLRs except TLR3 recruit MyD88. TLR4 also recruits the adapter
  protein TRIF, as does TLR3. To activate the TRIF-dependent pathway, TLR4 requires
  the bridging adaptor TRAM and its trafficking into endosomes. The MyD88-dependent
  and TRIF-dependent signaling complexes through a cascade of signaling events leading
  to the activation of several transcription factors including NF-κB, IRF3, and IRF7.
  NF-κB transcriptionally regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  while IRF3 and IRF7 control the transcription of of type I and type III IFN genes.
  Whereas in most cell types TLR2 signaling only results in NF-κB activation, in inflammatory
  monocytes and upon engagement of specific viral ligands such as vaccinia virus or
  MCMV TLR2 can traffick to endosomes where it results in IRF3/7 activation and type
  I IFN induction (not depicted).
