caption: 'Stress-suppressed genes involved in antigen presentation and synapse formation.
  (a) Antigen presentation pathways: this KEEG pathway taken via IPA was colored for
  the 288 stress-regulated genes that passed Welch''s t-test, FDR correction (q⩽0.001)
  and changed by ⩾1.5-fold (between pre- and post-RASP groups). (b) Expression of
  genes important for immunological synapse formation: suppression of transcripts
  important in antigen preparation, presentation, chemotaxis, intercellular binding,
  antigen reception and downstream signaling (green nodes) may impair formation of
  productive immunological synapse, which may explain the poor response of post-RASP
  leukocytes to SEB exposure; although SEB is presented without intracellular presentation,
  antigen presenting and receptor molecules of the synapse were suppressed.'
