  a disease signal or a reparative signal related to tissue injury. The regions of
  plasma membrane enriched in lipid-raft microdomains (red bars) are inveginated,

  (steps 1–3), with a series of changes occurring under the influence of multicomponent
  sorting machinery []. Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) fuse with the plasma membrane
  and secrete exosomes outwardly; these exosomes may interact with resident cells
  and may facilitate stemness, i.e., self-renewal, clonal expansion, differentiation,
  and repair. MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells'
