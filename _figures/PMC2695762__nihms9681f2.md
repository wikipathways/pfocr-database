caption: After activation of membrane-bound microbial sensors such as Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing non-TLRs,
  and the cytoplasmic sensor NOD2 (CARD15), signaling pathways converge on CARD9.
  Stimulation of dectin-1 with the fungus-derived ligand zymosan or of TREM-1 (unknown
  specific ligand) induces phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the ITAMs,
  leading to downstream formation of a signaling complex of CARD9 with other adaptor
  proteins, particularly BCL10 and MALT1. TLRs can activate RIP2 (CARD3) and CARD9
  in response to a broad range of microbial ligands, while NOD2 interacts with RIP2
  and CARD9 via CARD–CARD interactions upon intracellular recognition of muramyl dipeptide.
  Formation of the signaling complex with CARD9, BCL-10 and MALT1 leads to activation
  of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and subsequently
  secretion of proin-flammatory cytokines. TLRs can also activate NF-κB through a
  CARD9-independent pathway.
