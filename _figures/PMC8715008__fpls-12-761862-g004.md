caption: Analysis of DEGs involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in L. radiata.
  (A) Anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway and the log2 transformed FPKM values of DEGs
  associated with structural enzyme genes were used to draw the heatmap. The enzymes
  include 4-coumarateCoA ligase (4CL), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), chalcone
  synthase (CHS), flavone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavonoid
  3′-hydroxylase (F3′H), dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR), flavonol synthase (FLS),
  UDP-flavonoid glucosyl transferase (UFGT), anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), and leucoanthocyanidin
  reductase (LAR). FB, floral bud stage; FL1, partially opening flower stage; FL2,
  fully opened flower stage, and R, senescent flower stage. Color gradients comprise
  red, white, and blue, representing genes that were upregulated, not regulated, as
  well as downregulated, respectively. (B) The heatmap analysis of all DEGs in anthocyanin
  biosynthesis pathway according to the FPKM value.
