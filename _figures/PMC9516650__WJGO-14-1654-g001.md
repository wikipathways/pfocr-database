caption: 'Main acquired resistance mutations detected by liquid biopsy. Key acquired
  resistance mutations are associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  pathway. Other mutations or amplifications in tyrosine kinase receptors, such as
  HER2/ERBB2 or MET, can potentially lead to resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. 1Indicate
  acquired resistance mutations, as reported in previous studies. EGFR: Epidermal
  growth factor receptor.'
