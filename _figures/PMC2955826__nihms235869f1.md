caption: miRNA pathway and RNAi in cells targeted by small RNA-based therapies. (a)
  In healthy cells, (i) miRNA genes are expressed from genomic DNA, and (ii) the microprocessor
  complex processes the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA),
  which is further exported to the cytoplasm. (iii) Dicer, in collaboration with TRBP
  (HIV-1 transactivating response RNA-binding protein), process the pre-miRNA into
  miRNA duplex, which is (iv) loaded into Argonaute (Ago) protein-containing complex.
  (v) One strand of the duplex, the ‘guide strand’, represses translation of mRNA
  by complementary binding affinity within the 3′ UTR of the mRNA. (b) Small RNAs,
  such as siRNA and shRNAs, can be delivered into cells via different described methods;
  (i) naked siRNA can be delivered locally by injection in a tissue, while (ii) RNA-structured
  aptamer molecules and (iii) antibody-protamine conjugated siRNAs can be used for
  cell-specific delivery. (iv) Small RNAs, including locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligos,
  can be incorporated into liposomal preparations. (iv-v) shRNA and other RNA-based
  tools (e.g. ribozymes and decoys) may be cloned into plasmids and viral vectors
  for promoter-base long-term expression. (vi) Following entry into the cytoplasm,
  small RNAs (vii) and lentivirus (viii) are released from endosomal compartments.
  (ix) Lentiviruses can be further integrated within the host genome and can be transcribed
  by the host machinery. (x) siRNA/shRNA delivery into diseased cells are also loaded
  into the Ago-containing protein complex to allow gene regulation of misregulated
  genes by RNA interference (xi).
