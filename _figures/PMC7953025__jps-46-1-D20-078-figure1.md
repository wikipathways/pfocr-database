caption: Fig. 1. Overview of the Juvenile Hormone Biosynthetic Pathway (Adapted from
  Goodman and Cusson)). This pathway is divided in two branches, the mevalonate pathway
  and the JH-specific steps. The order of the last two enzymatic steps may vary. Precursors
  are in bold and enzymes are in italics.
