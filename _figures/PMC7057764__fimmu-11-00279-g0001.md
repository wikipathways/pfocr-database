caption: 'Impact of lactic acid on tumor angiogenesis. Tumor cells generate large
  amounts of lactic acid that are exported by MCT1 and MCT4. The accumulation of lactic
  acid in the extracellular milieu promotes several cancer processes leading to cell
  survival, tumor growth and metastasis. Lactic acid stimulates angiogenesis by polarizing
  TAMs to the M2-like phenotype; inducing the expression of high levels of VEGF and
  arginase I (Arg1) that support tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis; and inhibiting
  antitumor immunity (, ); Within monocytes, lactic acid enhances the production of
  IL-23 (), and IL-23 stimulates macrophages to produce IL-10, TGF-β, and VEGF ().
  IL-23 also induces MMP9 expression, which contributes to angiogenesis. Within endothelial
  cells, lactic acid activates the NF-κB pathway, which triggers the production of
  proangiogenic IL-8, drives the migration of endothelial cells and increases the
  capacity of endothelial cells to form tubes (). Within the tumor cells, lactic acid
  activates GPR81 to enhance the secretion of AREG, a member of the EGFR family. AREG
  contributes to neovascularization by increasing the production of VEGF, which promotes
  angiogenesis (, ). Lactic acid also supports the activation of normoxic HIF-1α in
  tumors and endothelial cells by inhibiting PHDs with 2-oxoglutarate (), resulting
  in the increased expression of relevant pro-angiogenic targets, including VEGF ().
