caption: Model of GPCR regulation by ubiquitination. Biosynthesis and folding of GPCRs
  is monitored with stringent quality-control machinery in the ER, which targets misfolded
  GPCRs for ubiquitination and degradation through the ERAD-proteosomal pathway that
  releases ubiquitin (Ub) back to the cytosol. Properly folded GPCRs are delivered
  to the plasma membrane, where GPCRs are targeted for ubiquitination either basally
  or after agonist stimulation. Ubiquitination of GPCRs by E3 ligases has been implicated
  in agonist-induced internalization or basal receptor retention at the plasma membrane.
  Once internalized, ubiquitinated GPCR has multiple fates, including 1) recycling
  back to the plasma membrane, initiated by the action of deubiquitinases; 2) targeting
  for lysosomal degradation; and 3) ubiquitin-driven endosomal signaling.
