caption: 'Glucose metabolism in cancer cells. Glycolysis is a series of metabolic
  processes, driven by nine specific enzymes, by which one mole of glucose is catabolized
  to two moles of pyruvate, two moles of NADH with a net gain of two ATP. As indicated,
  several intermediates can fuel the Pentose Phosphate Pathway or lead to amino acid
  production. Accumulation of those intermediates is favored by the rate-limiting
  activity of PKM2. In cancer cells, pyruvate is further converted into lactate, thereby
  generating NAD+ from NADH. Pyruvate can be imported in the mitochondrial matrix
  to feed the TCA cycle. This step is controlled by Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase
  (PDK) which can inactivate Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH), therefore limiting the
  pyruvate conversion into acetyl-CoA and the further feeding of the TCA cycle.  •
  Transporters: Glut: Glucose transporter; MCT: monocarboxylate transporter.  • Glycolytic
  intermediates: G6P: Glucose-6-phosphate, F6P: fructose-6-phosphate; F1,6BP: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
