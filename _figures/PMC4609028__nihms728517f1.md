caption: In plants, effector-triggered PCD is initiated by NB-LRR-mediated perception
  of the presence of specific intracellular effectors secreted by pathogens. Effector
  recognition signals CKI release, which promotes RBR1 hyperphosphorylation, release
  of E2Fs, and transcription of pro-PCD genes. PCD results in cytoplasmic shrinkage
  and leakage of ions and DAMPs, and production of the immune signal salicylic acid
  to stimulate the immune response. In mammals, during pyroptosis, NLRs recognize
  intracellular pathogens through conserved MAMPs, triggering assembly of the inflammasome
  and activation of pyroptotic caspases. Pyroptotic death results in cell lysis and
  the release of DAMPs and inflammatory cytokines, leading to a full inflammatory
  response. DNA damage checkpoint-induced apoptosis includes an accumulation of hyperphosphorylated
  Rb as well as phosphorylation and stabilization of E2F1 by ATM and ATR, deregulating
  the Rb/E2F cell cycle pathway. The apoptosome is formed by interaction of procaspase
  9 and cytochrome c, leading to activation of apoptotic caspases and a PCD phenotype
  that includes the formation of an apoptotic body.
