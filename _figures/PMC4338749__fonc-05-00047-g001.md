caption: Drugs that inhibit folding or disposal of misfolded proteins. Native mature
  proteins, nascent proteins, or misfolded proteins can be prevented from folding
  or refolding by small and large heat shock protein inhibitors, of which the hsp90
  inhibitors based on geldanamycin and radicicol are currently the most advanced in
  clinical studies. To avoid accumulation of misfolded proteins, their degradation
  can be mediated by hsc70, which may divert these proteins either to lysosomes to
  be degraded by chaperone-mediated autophagy or, by specific ubiquitination, to proteasomes.
  In case of unmanageable amounts of misfolded proteins or proteasome inhibition,
  unspecific aggregation of these proteins may occur. These highly cytotoxic small
  protein aggregates can be sequestered in an HDAC6-dependent manner with the help
  of microtubules into large, perinuclear aggresomes near the microtubule organizing
  center. Inhibition of HDAC6 by tubacin, tubastatin, or ACY-1215 inhibits disposal
  of microaggregates and may enhance the toxicity of bortezomib and HSP inhibitors.
  Aggresomes are not final deposits but may be re-dissolved either en bloc by macroautophagy
  or by molecular segregation via p97/VCP and final degradation by proteasomes. The
  p97/VCP inhibitor eeyarestatin may inhibit this degradation pathway but also aggresome
  formation by interfering with ataxin-3. Eeyarestatin also inhibits both anterograde
  and retrograde transport of ER proteins. Induction of ER stress induces the unfolded
  protein response by sequestering BiP from membrane receptors ATF6, PERK, and IRE.
  The unfolded protein response leads to cytoprotective chaperone synthesis but also
  to the expression of pro-apoptotic CHOP, NOXA, and c-JUN-kinase activation in case
  of prolonged or unmanageable ER stress. ER stress may also be alleviated by autophagy,
  whose efficacy can be inhibited by the lysosomotropic anti-malaria drug chloroquine.
