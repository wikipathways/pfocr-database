caption: The microRNA processing pathway. It is postulated that the miRNA processing
  pathway is linear and universal to all mammalian miRNAs. This process includes the
  production of the primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) by RNA polymerase II or III
  and cleavage of the pri-miRNA by the microprocessor complex Drosha–DGCR8 (Pasha)
  in the nucleus (A). The resulting precursor hairpin, the pre-miRNA, is exported
  from the nucleus by Exportin-5–Ran-GTP. In the cytoplasm, the RNase Dicer in complex
  along with RNA-binding cofactor of Dicer complexes known as transactivation response
  element RNA-binding protein (TRBP) cleaves the pre-miRNA hairpin to its mature length
  (B). The mature miRNA’s functional strand is loaded together with Argonaute (Ago2)
  proteins into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where it guides RISC to
  silence target mRNAs through mRNA cleavage, translational repression, or deadenylation,
  whereas the passenger strand is degraded (C).
