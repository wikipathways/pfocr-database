caption: Schematic model of the interplay between TREM2/DAP12 complex and LPS-induced
  inflammation. The TREM2/DAP12 complex suppresses the activity of JNK signaling pathway
  to reduce LPS-triggered inflammatory response in microglia. LPS down-regulates the
  expression of Trem2 via the activation of JNK and NF-κB signaling pathways.
