caption: A The relationship between the Insulin pathway and cancers. B The hyperactivation
  of Insulin signaling promotes tumorigenesis inside tumors. Insulin pathway can promote
  tumorigenesis by activating the TOR-eIF4E-S6K pathway and enhancing the insulin/PI3K
  signal, because during the process, tumor cell apoptosis is inhibited, Wingless/Wnt
  mitotic signal is activated, the expression of autophagy-related factor Atg 6/Beclin
  1 and overexpression of InR, PI3K or S6K are promoted, and cell competition is initiated.
  Epigenetic factor such as Hdac3 may play a role in tumor growth via inhibiting InR
  or PI3K. C Insulin resistance induces cachexia in the healthy tissues. The IGF/Insulin
  pathway can be blocked in healthy tissues by tumor cells via Upd 3/JAK/STAT signaling
  and cytokine Impl2, which may lead to the wasting of cells and organs. The solid
  line represents a definite regulatory effect, while the dotted line represents a
  possible regulatory effect. Red refers to the names of certain components in mammals,
  green refers to the components or the names of the components in the Drosophila
  system, and black refers to the components, which share the same name in both mammals
  and Drosophila.
