caption: The glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) pathway and the Krebs cycle function. As
  shown here, oxidative deamination of glutamate by hGDH1 and hGDH2 generates α-ketoglutarate,
  ammonia and NADH or NADPH. While α-ketoglutarate is metabolized by the Krebs cycle,
  NADPH can be used for biosynthetic reactions. GTP generated at the step of succinyl-CoA
  to succinate potently inhibits hGDH1 thus preventing glutamate from fueling this
  cycle under an adequate energy charge. On the other hand, hGDH2 has dissociated
  its function from GTP control and as such it permits glutamate flux under conditions
  inhibitory to hGDH1. Both enzymes are activated by ADP and L-leucine, which can
  act synergistically. Oxidative metabolism of α-ketoglutarate via the Krebs cycle
  generates citrate that can support the biosynthesis of lipids required for nerve
  tissue development and/or glioma cell growth. Also, it can generate lactate to be
  provided by astrocytes to neurons or by Sertoli cells to spermatids. Fumarate, generated
  by this pathway, is shown to stimulate glutathione peroxidase 1 activity, thus contributing
  to homeostasis against oxidative stress This Figure is modified from [].
