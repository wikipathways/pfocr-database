caption: Meiosis I spindle formation is a result of Aurora A, Plk4, and Ran-GTP activity.
  Spindle assembly in the oocyte is a multistep process triggered by the cooperative
  activity of Plk4 (yellow) and Aurora A (red), which are essential to initiate microtubule
  growth at NEBD. Plk4 and Aurora A localize to MTOCs that are dispersed around condensed
  chromosomes. Aurora A activity is potentiated by Plk4, directly phosphorylating
  the kinase at five Ser/Thr residues including the T-loop activating site, but likely
  undergoing additional regulation by meiotic kinases and/or regulatory binding partners.
  Both Aurora A and Plk4 can have a distinct and shared set of substrates. We identify
  TACC3 as one potential downstream effector of Aurora A that localizes to MTOCs and
  whose phosphorylation is reduced upon Aurora A inhibition (see ). Other pathways
  are likely acting at later stages of spindle assembly and are able to partially
  overcome the defects caused by inhibition of Aurora A and Plk4. One redundant pathway
  is Ran-GTP, which, by increasing levels of the allosteric Aurora A activator TPX2,
  is important for TACC3-mediated microtubule stabilization at the spindle poles.
