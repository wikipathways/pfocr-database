caption: 'Tocopherol/tocotrienol biosynthesis in plants. The hydroquinone ring of
  tocopherol is derived from the shikimate pathway of aromatic amino acid synthesis.
  Homogentisate, the precursor for the synthesis of tocopherol, tocotrienol, and plastoquinone,
  is synthesized by p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). After attachment of
  the hydrophobic side chain by homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT1/VTE2) and methylation,
  2,3-dimethyl-5-phytyl-1, 4-hydroquinol (DMPQ) is formed that is converted to γ-tocopherol
  by tocopherol cyclase (VTE1). Final methylation by γ-tocopherol methyltransferase
  (γ-TMT, VTE4) results in the production of α-tocopherol. Tocopherol synthesis is
  regulated in plants via environmental stress, and stress sensitive hormones such
  as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and abscisic acid (ABA). Two major points of regulation
  were identified: 1. HPPD is regulated by jasmonic acid and ABA, 2. VTE1 is strongly
  induced during oxidative stress. Oxidations are symbolized by red arrows: reductions
  are symbolized by green arrows.'
