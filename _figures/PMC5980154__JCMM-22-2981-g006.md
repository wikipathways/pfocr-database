caption: Schematic diagram illustrating how ɑ‐LA, via regulation of Grb2 expression,
  modulates different signalling pathways that participate in proliferation‐related
  stress responses. Growth factors (EGF/HGF) in the extracellular matrix bind to RTKs
  on the plasma membrane and subsequently phosphorylate the docking site and recruit
  effector molecules [Grb2, Grb2‐associated‐binding protein 1 (Gab 1), SRC homology
  2 domain‐containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2), Son of Sevenless (Sos) and sarcoma non‐receptor
  tyrosine kinase (SRC)]. ɑ‐LA, by down‐regulating Grb2 expression, impairs the phosphorylation
  of the docking site of effector molecules and then subsequently attenuates the downstream
  ERK/MAPK pathway and the PI3K‐AKT pathway, leading to decreased ERK1/2 and/or mTOR
  translocation across the nuclear membrane and/or inhibition of the activation of
  transcription factors (TFs) and gene expression. The signals affect gene expression
  and repress cell proliferation and survival, resulting in the arrest of cancer growth
  and progression.
