caption: 'The metabolic pathway of cordycepin in O. sinensis zjut. The biosynthesis
  pathway of cordycepin was constructed based on the annotation of the O. sinensis
  zjut proteome. The dotted line represented the possible protein involved in the
  conversion of 3′-dAMP to cordycepin. The DEPs (ADK, adk, RRM1, surE) was shown with
  bold fonts. purH: IMP cyclohydrolase; AMDP: AMP deaminase; adk: Adenylate kinase;
  purA: Adenylosuccinate synthase; purB: Adenylosuccinate lyase; ADK: Adenosine kinase;
  surE: 5′-nucleotidase; E3.1.3.5: 5′-nucleotidase; RRM1: Ribonucleoside-diphosphate
  reductase subunit M1; RRM2: Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2'
