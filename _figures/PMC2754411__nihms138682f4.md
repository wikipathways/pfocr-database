caption: (A). A simplified phylogenetic tree of the POZ domain transcription factors
  illustrating the concept of the lineage-specific expansion. Note that the transcription
  factors from a given lineage are closer to its paralogs than to those from other
  lineages. The domain architectures of selected proteins are shown to the right.
  C2H2- Zinc-finger domain; AT- AT-hook DNA binding domain; Bzip- basic zipper domain;
  the C-terminal domain in pipsqueak is a helix-turn-helix domain. (B). Examples of
  lineage-specific gene expansions in various transcription factor families in different
  eukaryotic lineages which are labeled by genus name. All LSEs from one lineage are
  colored in the same away. The Myb/SANT domains expanded in Drosophila represent
  a family of helix-turn-helix DNA transcription factors typified by the Zeste protein.
  (C). The ubiquitin and kinase pathways are shown to illustrate LSEs occurring in
  component proteins of the pathway that are at termini.
