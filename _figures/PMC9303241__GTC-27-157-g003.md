caption: Regulatory model of V. cholerae virulence factors. The membrane proteins
  TcpH/TcpP and ToxS/ToxR receive external environmental stimuli and positively regulate
  the transcription of toxT gene. The synthesized ToxT acts as a transcription factor
  and regulates the transcription of downstream virulence factors. The movement of
  sodium ions through the sodium‐driven flagellum and respiratory chain seems to affect
  the transcription of toxT. Although not shown in the figure, there is a pathway
  in which the quorum signal is accepted by the sensor kinases CqsS and LuxQ, and
  influences the production of virulence factors by a multi‐step signaling cascade
  through LuxO. The involvement of these very complex genes controls the regulation
  of the expression of virulence factors such as cholera toxin and TCP. The figure
  was created based on previous studies (Krukonis et al., ; Ramamurthy et al., ; Zhu
  et al., )
