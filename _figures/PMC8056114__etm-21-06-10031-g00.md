caption: NGF-mediated regulation of the NGFR and NTRK1 signaling pathways. NGF binds
  to the extracellular domain of NTRK1 with high affinity, resulting in dimerization
  of NTRK1 and activation of its intracellular kinase. NTRK1 signaling is best characterized
  by activation of the three main downstream signal transduction pathways, the MAPK/ERK,
  PI3K/Akt and PLC-γ signaling pathways, which results in the differentiation and
  survival of neurites. NGF binds to NGFR with low affinity. NGFR activation involves
  different molecular mechanisms in different types of cells and tissue environments,
  and exerts effects via the NF-κB, JNK and ceramide signaling pathways, resulting
  in apoptosis, survival and inflammation. Interactions of NGFR with sortilin allow
  the high-affinity binding of proNGF. Subsequent activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway
  results in apoptosis. Interactions of NGFR with Nogo-R and LINGO-1 play roles in
  the regulation of growth. Activation of RhoA by the displacement of Rho-GDI inhibits
  neurite outgrowth from postnatal sensory neurons and cerebellar neurons. NGF, nerve
  growth factor; NTRK1, tropomyosin-related kinase receptor 1; MAPK/ERK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; PI3K/Akt, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/serine
  protein kinase; PLC-γ, phospholipase C-γ; NF-κB, nuclear transcription factor-kappa
  B; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; CR, cysteine-rich; Nogo-R, Nogo receptor; LINGO-1,
  leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing protein-1.
