caption: PD1/PD-L1 pathway. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction leads to phosphorylation of ITIM
  and ITSIM patterns, resulting in the recruitment of a phosphatase (SHP-2). SHP-2
  will therefore dephosphorylate several key kinases in the TCR signaling pathway,
  in particular Ras and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). It results in a decrease
  of transcription factors such as the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)
  and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which play an important role in LT activation, proliferation,
  survival, and effector functions. Furthermore, LT functions can be inhibited by
  an increased expression of BATF (basic leucine zipper ATF-like), a transcription
  factor. Antibodies against PD-1 and PD-L1 stop the inhibitor signal and restore
  T-cell function against tumor.
