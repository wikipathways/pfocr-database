caption: Mechanisms of Nrf2/KEAP1 pathway regulated by phytochemicals. Phytochemicals
  induce nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which then binds to the ARE in the nucleus,
  leading to the expression of siperoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase
  (GPx), glytathione (GSH), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase
  1 (NQO1). This pathway plays an important role in cancer chemoprevention by regulating
  detoxification, antioxidants, anti-inflammation, and other metabolisms in normal
  cells. Conversely, phytochemicals induce apoptosis in cancer cells through regulation
  of the Nrf2/KEAP1 pathway.
