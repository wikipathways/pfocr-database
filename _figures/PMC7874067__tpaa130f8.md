caption: This figure shows the effect of Gigantea on the light phase of photosynthesis
  pathway. Networks have been inferred with a list of genes involved in the light
  phase of photosynthesis pathways and CaGI gene. (a, b) C. arabica networks have
  been inferred from rhythmic genes determined by JTK method. We used 12 h/12 h photoperiod
  data and 8 h/16 h photoperiod data. (c) Arabidopsis network has been inferred from
  Arabidopsis data of rhythmic genes determined with diurnal () in LDHC condition
  (light/dark cycles and hot (22 °C)/cold (12 °C) cycles). CaPhot2, CaLHCB5 and CaLHCB4
  have not been included in the Arabidopsis network inference because they are not
  rhythmic in the ‘diurnal mocklerlab database.org’. The gene name written inside
  a red-filled circle indicates GI gene involved in circadian rhythm; gene names written
  inside a green-filled circle indicate genes involved in the light phase of photosynthesis.
  Ca = C. arabica. If two or more gene names are written on a node, it means that
  their expression profiles are correlated with Pearson correlation coefficient >85%.
  Bootstrap is specified in the middle of the arrow and lines. Gene names written
  inside a gray-filled circle indicate genes without interaction in the network. Rhythmic
  genes have been determined by JTK-DESeq2 method. The phase corresponds to the maximum
  value of the gene expression profile. If the phase occurs at the same time point
  in 12 h/12 h photoperiod and in 8 h/16 h photoperiod, rhythmic genes are called
  ‘rhythmic genes without phase change’. If the phase occurs at different time points
  in 12 h/12 h photoperiod and in 8 h/16 h photoperiod, rhythmic genes are called
  ‘rhythmic genes with phase change’.
