caption: Identification of differentially produced metabolites from the SCC10A cells
  cultured with or without CoCl2 by GC-TOFMS. A. OPLS-DA scores plots of differentially
  expressed metabolites in the SCC10A cells culture without CoCl2 (representing normoxia)
  or with CoCl2 (representing hypoxia). B. V-plots of differentially produced metabolites
  in the SCC10A cells cultured with or without CoCl2. C. Summaries of the Metabolic
  Pathway Enrichment Analysis results.
