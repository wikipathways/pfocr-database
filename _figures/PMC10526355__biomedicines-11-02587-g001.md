caption: 'NF-κB pathway and its role in the pathogenesis of AD. In the canonical pathway,
  TNFR and NMDAR activation raises Ca2+, triggering CaMKII-mediated Ca2+-NF-κB linkage.
  Simultaneously, TLR activation acts on IKK subunits. Ca2+ leads to IκB kinase activation,
  IκB breakdown, and p65/p50 dimer formation. NF-κB enters the nucleus, binding neuronal
  gene targets (e.g., APP) for synaptic function, memory, and amyloid processing.
  Aβ, resulting from APP cleavage, activates ROS-dependent NF-κB, intensifying amyloid
  dysregulation. Pro-inflammatory agents (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β) activate TLR through
  canonical (IKKβ-NEMO) and non-canonical (IKKγ, IKK-α) pathways. Both drive NF-κB-mediated
  neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD. TNFR: Tumor necrosis factor receptor;
  NMDAR: N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor; TLR: Toll-like receptor; Aβ: Amyloid beta;
  APP: Amyloid precursor protein; CAMKII: Calcium–calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein
  kinase I; IKKγ: Inhibitor of nuclear factor-ĸB Kinase gamma (also known as NEMO:
  Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) essential modulator); IKKα: Inhibitor of nuclear factor-ĸB
  Kinase alpha; IKKβ: Inhibitor of nuclear factor-ĸB kinase beta; IĸB: Inhibitor of
  ĸB; ROS: Reactive oxygen species. TNF-α: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1β: Interlukin-1
  beta; RELB: Transcription factor.'
