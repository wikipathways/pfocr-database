caption: Potential neuroprotective pathways regulated by stigmasterol are comparable
  to resveratrol. Stigmasterol protects SH-SY5Y cells from H2O2-induced oxidative
  stress via stimulation of SIRT1-FoxO3a signaling pathway and promoting equilibrium
  of the antioxidant system, thereby reducing excessive ROS accumulation, attenuating
  neurodegeneration and apoptosis, and eventually promoting cell survival (Figure
