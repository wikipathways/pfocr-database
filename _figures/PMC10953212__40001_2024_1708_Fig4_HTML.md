caption: Schematic representation of the relationship between inflammation and NASH
  disease progression. Upon stimulation with TNF-α, the NF-κB pathway is activated,
  as indicated by phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB and transcription
  of its target genes, including IL-6 and IL-1β. Newly synthesized IL-6 is secreted
  by cells and binds to the IL-6R in an autocrine or paracrine manner, leading to
  activation of the IL-6R/gp130 complex and intracellular JAK1/2 kinases. STAT3 proteins
  are then phosphorylated by JAK1/2, dimerize, enter the nucleus, and initiate transcription
  of STAT3-dependent genes such as TGF-β, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-1β, which contribute
  to the development of inflammatory responses Alternatively, the first signal for
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation is NF-κB-mediated NLRP3 transcription. When activated,
  the NLRP3 inflammasome converts caspase-1, pro-IL-18, and pro-IL-1β into active
  forms, triggering an inflammatory response. IL-6R interleukin-6 receptor, gp130
  glycoprotein 130
