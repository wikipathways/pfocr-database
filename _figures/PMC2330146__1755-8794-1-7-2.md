caption: Summary of gene expression responses to pterostilbene in the sulfur metabolism
  pathway. Methionine biosynthetic pathway and corresponding genes are based on Thorsen
  et al. [66] and the Saccharomyces Genome Database [25]. Genes shown in boldface
  in the pathway are those affected by pterostilbene. The up- and down-regulated genes
  were indicated by arrows, (↑) and (↓).
