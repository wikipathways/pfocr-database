caption: The purine biosynthetic pathway is ubiquitous in most living organisms, and
  it is a ten-step process for converting phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate to inosine
  monophosphate. Formyl glycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase (FGAR-AT), also
  known by its gene product name, PurL, catalyzes the fourth step in the pathway,
  conversion of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) to formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide
  (FGAM) ()(). In this reaction, glutamine is converted to glutamate releasing ammonia,
  which is incorporated into the amide of FGAR and ATP is converted to ADP and Pi.
