caption: Hypothesized mechanisms for sphingolipids in cardioprotective signaling in
  response to ischemia or hypoxia. First, ischemia/reperfusion activates sphingosine
  kinase 1 (SK1) through a PKCε-dependent mechanism and induces the enzymatic processing
  or “shedding” of membrane-bound TNFα (pro-TNF) by metallomatrix proteases (also
  known as TACE, or TNFα-converting enzyme) in the extracellular matrix of the cardiomyocyte.
  TNFα is released, which acts in a paracrine fashion on cardiomyocyte TNFα receptors
  (TNFRI) that, in turn, activate the sphingomyelin signal transduction system. The
  principal signaling molecule produced by the TNFα trigger is SPH, the majority of
  which crosses the sarcolemma membrane and is released into the extracellular fluid
  compartment. It is also known that blood platelets and other blood components that
  possess SK1 convert SPH to S1P. S1P is cardioprotective through both intracellular
  and putative “inside-out” pathways, the latter involving S1P1 and S1P3 receptors.
  SPH is also cardioprotective through a PKG/PKA-dependent pathway. Therefore, in
  contrast to S1P, the cardioprotective effects of sphingosine may not be mediated
  through S1P-specific G-protein-coupled receptor. PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.
