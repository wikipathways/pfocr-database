caption: 'Alterations in expression of L-arginine/NO pathway enzymes: (a) in inflamed
  and quiescent tissue from patients with Crohn’s disease as compared to normal large
  bowel tissue derived from patients undergoing polypectomy; (b) in inflamed tissue
  from patients with ulcerative colitis as compared to normal large bowel tissue derived
  from patients undergoing polypectomy. Changes observed in inflamed large bowel are
  marked by red arrows and changes observed in quiescent large bowel by blue arrows.
  Pathway players analyzed in the current study are written in black: metabolites
  in straight font and enzymes in italics. Inhibition is marked as T-arrows (as a
  dashed line if the effect is weak). PRMT, arginine N-methyltransferase; PM, plasma
  membrane; CATs, cationic amino acid transporters; DDAH, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase;
  DMA, dimethylamine; ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine; SDMA, symmetric dimethylarginine;
  NOS, nitric oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; ARG, arginase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase;
  protein-CH3, methylated proteins.'
