caption: A schematic illustration showed the therapeutic potential of Atractylodes
  lancea and its principal constituent, atractylodin, in addressing metabolic dysfunction-associated
  steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Atractylodes lancea and atractylodin exert significant
  benefits by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway.
  These interventions lead to improvements in high-fat-diet-induced obesity, fatty
  liver, and insulin resistance
