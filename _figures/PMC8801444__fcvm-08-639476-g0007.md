caption: Mechanistic map of blocking the Notch pathway to improve cardiac fibrosis.
  Blocking of the Notch signaling pathway promoted M2 macrophage polarization and
  increased CYLD expression in macrophages, followed by inhibiting the activation
  of NF-κB pathway, inflammatory factors, and fibrosis-related factors, and ultimately
  suppressed cardiac fibrosis remodeling.
