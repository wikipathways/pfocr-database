caption: Simplified diagram of choline-related one-carbon metabolism. Choline is the
  precursor of betaine, which serves as a source of methyl groups for homocysteine
  (Hcy) remethylation to methionine (Met). Alternatively, homocysteine can be remethylated
  with methyl groups from methyl-tetrahydrofolate (methyl-THF), which is derived from
  methylenetetrahydrofolate (methylene-THF). MTHFD1 (methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase
  1), a trifunctional enzyme catalyzes the production of methylene-THF from THF. Methionine
  is used in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl donor for more than 50
  methyltransferases, including phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT).
  PEMT catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) from phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) and produces S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). In addition, PC can be synthesized
  from choline via the cytidine diphosphate–choline pathway.
