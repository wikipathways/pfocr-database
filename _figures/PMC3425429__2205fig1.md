caption: A working model depicting some of the multiple signaling pathways that have
  been reported to modulate cell-cycle activation and/or proliferation in rodent β-cells.
  Note that although this model is reasonably robust, it is nonetheless preliminary
  and will require amendment and addition over time. The growth factors (insulin,
  IGF-I, HGF) and the incretin hormone GLP-1 are linked to the IRS/PI3K pathway, which
  in turn signals via PDK-1 to modulate Akt and FoxO1. Nutrients have also been reported
  to modulate PI3K, block AMP-activated protein kinase, and modulate mTORC1. PI3K
  activation following HGF binding to its tyrosine kinase receptor, c-Met, results
  in the production of phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate that directly binds to the
  pleckstrin homology domain of PDK-1. PDK-1 then attaches to the hydrophobic motif
  of PKCζ, phosphorylates Thr410, and exposes the kinase domain to autophosphorylation
  of Thr560, a phosphorylation required for full catalytic activity. PKCζ activation
  leads to inactivation of GSK3β and increased phosphorylation and activation of mTORC1.
  Activation of mTORC1 is required for PKCζ-mediated induction of rodent β-cell proliferation.
  Lactogen signaling is activated by the prolactin receptor and acts via Jak2/Stat5
  and/or Jak2/Bcl6/menin and/or tryptophan hydroxylases, which generate serotonin.
  Serotonin is assumed to act via the HTR2b receptor to modulate intracellular calcium
  and PKC or PI3K members. The FoxO proteins, downstream targets of Akt, are reported
  to regulate the cell cycle, although it is unclear how this directly impacts β-cell
  cycle control. Transcriptional repression of cyclin D is required for FoxO-mediated
  inhibition of cell-cycle progression and transformation, and FoxO proteins have
  been reported to upregulate the transcription of p27Kip1. The phosphorylation of
  FoxO1 by Akt is reported to prevent the transcription factor Foxa2 from driving
  the expression of Pdx1, which mediates the proliferation/differentiation of β-cells
  in response to FoxO1 (). Akt can also downregulate p21Cip1 activity indirectly through
  MDM2/p53. Insulin and IGF-I can also promote proliferation independently of the
  PI3K pathway by acting through proteins that act by extracellular signal–related
  kinase-dependent and -independent (Raf1) pathways. (A high-quality color representation
  of this figure is available in the online issue.)
