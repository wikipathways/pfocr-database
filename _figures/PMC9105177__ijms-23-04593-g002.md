caption: The influenza virus evasion mechanism through ubiquitin modulation of host
  cell proteins. The IAV recognition signaling pathway, triggered by the innate immune
  sensor RIG-I represented. (A). The RIG-I binds to the viral RNA (e.g., the 5′ppp
  RNA) and undergoes a conformational change that opens CARD domains. The CARD domain
  is then activated by ubiquitination, catalyzed by either TRIM25 or Riplet E3 ligases.
  (B). After viral RNA detection, RIG-I recruits MAVS to activate the TBK1-IKKϵ complex,
  which is needed for the activation of IRF3. The IRF3 then translocates to the nucleus
  and induces type I IFNs. The IAV NS1 suppresses the TRIM25 or Riplet-mediated ubiquitination
  of RIG-I caspase. The NS1 RBD from 1918 H1N1 strain inhibits RIG-I ubiquitination.
  Highly pathogenic PB1-F2 protein from 1918 H1N1 strain also antagonizes IFN production
  by proteasomal-mediated degradation of DDX3. This illustration was created with
  BioRender.com.
