caption: 'An overview of the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a type
  of cell death mediated by caspase-specific proteases (caspase-specific proteases).
  The canonical pathway of pyroptosis mainly depends on caspase-1. PAMPs and DAMPs
  associated molecular patterns in the cytoplasm can stimulate inflammasome assembly,
  leading to the processing and activation of caspase-1, which converts pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18 cleavage to mature form and cleavage of gasdermin D. The non-canonical
  pathway of pyroptosis mainly depends on caspase-11 (the human homologous caspase-4/5),
  activation of caspase 11/4/5 does not normally require PRR-mediated inflammasome,
  caspase-11 can directly recognize LPS in the cytoplasm for oligomerization and activation,
  disrupt the membrane structure by cleaving and activating GSDMD. GSDMD has two conserved
  domains: an N-terminal effector domain and a C-terminal inhibitory domain. The N-terminal
  is the main functional domain and is involved in the occurrence of pyroptosis, while
  the C-terminal has an auto-inhibitory function. In the resting state, the N-terminal
  and C-terminal domains are connected by a long loop. When stimulated by an external
  signal, Caspase-1/4/5/11 activates the cleavage of GSDMD protein, and GSDMD-NT is
  activated to bind to the cell membrane. The phospholipid protein binds, multimerizes,
  and forms a hole in the cytoplasmic membrane, which damages the cytoplasmic membrane
  and induces the occurrence of pyroptosis. At the same time, activated forms of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 are released through the hole, leading to a massive
  inflammatory response'
