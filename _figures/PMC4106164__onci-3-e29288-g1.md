caption: Figure 1. Modulation of PD-L1 levels in breast cancer. Diagram indicating
  the two major pathways for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) upregulation in
  breast tumor cells. The blue arrows indicate the intracellular (‘intrinsic’) signaling
  pathway mediated by PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation. The red arrows depict the extracellular-induced
  (‘extrinsic’) pathway mediated by IFNγ production by TILs and subsequent IFNGRs/JAK/STAT
  signaling in tumor cells. Anergic cytotoxic T cells are ineffective eliminating
  tumor cells and they participate in the recruitment of (immune-inhibitory) CD4+Foxp3+regulatory
  T cells through chemokine secretion. Ultimately, PD-L1 positive tumors show relatively
  fewer CD8+ and increased CD4+ TILs.
