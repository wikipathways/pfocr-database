caption: The TH/TR axis inhibits nodule regression and decreases the expressions of
  miR-27a, miR-181a, and miR-204a. BC200 is inhibited by T3/TR and downregulates the
  expressions of CDK2, cyclin E1, and cyclin E2 and upregulates P21, thereby repressing
  cell growth. The downregulation of TUG1 by the TH/TR axis causes AFP mRNA, cyclin
  E, and H3K27me3 silence and cell growth inhibition. When TRIP is activated by FOXC1,
  migration, invasion, and proliferation are strongly promoted. TRIP6 induces the
  AKT signaling pathway, thereby preventing FOXO3a overexpression-induced cyclin D1
  interference, p21 and p27 activation, and HCC cell proliferation arrest. The downregulation
  of PTTG1 is silenced by Sp2, which is negatively mediated by T3/TR. The activation
  of V-erbA leads to the depletion of Ndrg2, thus exacerbating tumor invasion and
  metastasis. Lcn2 can activate the Met/FAK pathway in a TH/TR axis-dependent manner,
  thus enhancing cell migration and invasion. T3/TR/MEK/ERK/NUPR1/PDGFA cascade may
  play a vital role in hepatocarcinogenesis. T3/TR upregulates NUPR1 via binding to
  the NUPR1 promoter regions, therefore promoting vascular invasion. THRSP prevents
  silence of the ERK/ZEB1 signaling pathway and inhibits the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition. DKK 4 antagonizes the Wnt signal pathway and inhibits tumor metastasis,
  which depends upon the activation of the T3/TR axis.

    The downregulation of PTTG1 is silenced by Sp2, which is negatively mediated by
