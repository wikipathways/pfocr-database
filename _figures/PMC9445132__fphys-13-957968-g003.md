caption: (A) AMPK/mTOR is a crucial regulatory pathway of autophagy and often acts
  as the initiation pathway of mitophagy. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 strongly
  inhibits autophagy through direct ULK1 phosphorylation. When the cell is starved
  or depleted of energy, mTORC1 dissociates from the complex and ULK1 autophosphorylation
  increases; AMPK promotes autophagy not only by directly activating ULK1 but also
  by negatively regulating mTORC1 and blocking its inhibition of ULK1.(B) PINK1/Parkin-mediated
  mitophagy depends on the activity of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC1) and
  P62/SQSTM1, which interact directly with light chain 3 (LC3) to recruit autophagosomes.
  Damaged mitochondria are enclosed in the autophagosomes and transported to lysosomes
  for degradation.(C) BNIP3/Nix promote mitophagy through interaction with processed
  LC3-related molecules at nascent phagophores.(D) Under hypoxia and other conditions,
  the activity of protein kinase Src, which inhibits the activity of FUNDC1, will
  also decrease, so as to enhance the activity of FUNDC1 and promote the interaction
  with LC3, thus affecting mitophagy.
