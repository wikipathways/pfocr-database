caption: 'Diagram of the Esp two-component pathway. Esp is a complex two-component
  pathway that regulates the timing of sporulation (, , ). This two-component pathway
  consists of the following proteins: the cytoplasmic EspA and membrane-bound EspC
  hybrid histidine kinases, which contain a histidine kinase transmitter domain and
  a response regulator receiver domain, the serine/threonine protein kinases called
  PktA5 and PktB8, and the putative EspB oligopeptide transport membrane protein.
  Several lines of evidence indicate that EspA and EspC form a signaling unit; EspA
  performs autophosphorylation via its transmitter domain and then transfers a phosphoryl
  group to its receiver domain and the receiver domain of EspC (). It has been proposed
  that EspB, PktA5, and PktB8 work together to modulate the activity of EspA (, ).
  It is believed that the EspAC signaling unit directly or indirectly inhibits the
  accumulation of MrpC, which is a positive regulator of sporulation, until the proper
  time in fruiting body development (). SD, sensor domain; DHp, dimerization and histidine
  phosphorylation domain; CA, catalytic and ATP binding domain; REC, receiver domain.'
