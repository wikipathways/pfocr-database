caption: Antiviral RNA silencing pathway in plants. (a) The antiviral siRNA pathway.
  First, the dsRNA structures of viral RNAs are processed by Dicer-like proteins into
  several siRNA fragments. The guide strand of siRNA (orange) can assemble into functional
  siRISC, and the passenger strand (purple) is ejected and degraded. All the forms
  of siRISC contain siRNA bound to an AGO protein. Target RNAs are then recognized
  by base pairing, and the siRNA populations that engage a target can be amplified
  by the action of RdRP enzymes, strengthening and perpetuating the silencing response.
  (b) The antiviral miRNA pathway. Primary miRNA (pri-RNA), produced from MIR genes
  by RNA Pol II, is diced into pre-miRNA by DCL1. Pre-miRNA is further processed by
  DCL1 and other accessory proteins into duplex miRNA, which is methylated by HEN1
  into mature miRNA duplex and transported to the cytoplasm. The guide strand of mature
  miRNA associates with RISC that consists of AGO1. (c) The antiviral amiRNA pathway.
  The amiRNA transgene expresses a monocistronic MIRNA precursor sequentially processed
  into an amiRNA targeting a single site in a single viral RNA, and the consequent
  steps are same as the antiviral miRNA pathway. Several studies have revealed the
  efficiency of RNA silencing in controlling viral diseases in potato.
