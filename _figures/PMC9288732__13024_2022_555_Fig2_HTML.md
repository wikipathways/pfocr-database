caption: MiT pathway at the intersection between lysosomes and mitochondria in the
  context of PD-related genes. MiT transcription factors (MITF, TFE3, TFEB) are activated
  through the mTOR complex in concert with RagA/B, RagC/D and FLCN/FNIP actions in
  response to amino acid (AA) availability. Upon dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation,
  MiT proteins activate transcription of genes involved in lysosomal biogenesis and
  mitochondrial homeostasis, including PGC-1α and NRF2. Proteins marked in green are
  examples of proteins implicated in familial forms of PD or carry PD risk alleles
  that are primarily affecting mitochondria or lysosomal functions. Secondary effects
  of mutations in those genes impair multiple cellular organelles, including membrane
  homeostasis and cytoskeleton organization, which reflects on mitochondrial dynamics
  and autophagy. Metabolites, such as ATP and Ca2+ connect mitochondrial and lysosomal
  functions by indirectly affecting the activation of MiT members through AMPK and
  Calcineurin (CaN), respectively. Small molecule inhibitors affecting MiT activation
  are indicated with blunt arrows pointing towards their protein targets. This figure
