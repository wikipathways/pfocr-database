caption: On monocytes, the gH/gL/UL128-131 and gH/gL/(gO) complexes engage both β1
  and β3 integrins, however, only the pentameric complex triggers integrin-mediated
  signaling. In the case of the gH/gL/UL128-131 complex, the gH protein interacts
  with β1 integrins, and the UL128-131 complex engages both β1 and β3 integrins, suggesting
  that the UL128-131 complex allows for cooperative regulation of receptor-mediated
  signaling pathway(s) initiated through the activation of separate integrin heterodimers
  to create the appropriate type/level of receptor-mediated signaling beneficial to
  the virus. This signal transduction process is consequently responsible for the
  functional activation/phosphorylation of paxillin (lightning bolts), which governs
  the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton ultimately leading to efficient internalization
  of HCMV into monocytes via an endocytosis-like pathway (black arrows). On fibroblasts,
  the gH/gL/(gO) complex(es) triggers integrin/Src-mediated signaling, however, paxillin-dependent
  actin rearrangement is not important for HCMV internalization, suggesting an involvement
  of contrasting molecular pathways in HCMV-infected fibroblasts (dotted arrows) vs.
  those seen in monocytes, leading to different modes of HCMV entry into fibroblasts
  vs. monocytes.
