caption: The gene regulatory network linkages that coordinate Delta-Notch signaling
  with the wnt8-blimp1 expanding-torus subcircuit. (A) Fate map and summary network
  subcircuit showing all linkages. Expression of delta is dominantly repressed by
  HesC and activated by the factor Runx, whereas hesC is activated broadly, amplified
  by receiving a cis-regulatory Delta-Notch signal input and repressed by Blimp1.
  For clarity the Wnt signaling pathway is simplified to show only the end result,
  nuclearized β-catenin interacting with the transcription factor Tcf (nb-Tcf); NICD,
  Notch intracellular domain; chevron, intercellular input. Fate map at left shows
  the future skeletal mesoderm (SM), purple; NSM, green; and endoderm, brown. (B–D)
  Depiction of linkages that are active in given stages and domains (i.e., views from
  the nuclei, VFNs). Note that NSM cells migrate toward vegetal pole as a consequence
  of skeletogenic cell ingression, and thus cells marked green in (B) and (C) are
  of the same lineage. Components shown in gray are inactive, and in color are active.
  (B) VFN for eighth cleavage NSM precursors. The blimp1/wnt8 subcircuit is active,
  whereas delta is not transcribed due to the presence of the dominant-acting HesC
  repressor. (C) VFN for NSM at early mesenchyme blastula. Expression of delta expression
  begins as hesC transcription ceases due to repression by Blimp1. Also due to Blimp1
  repression, the blimp1/wnt8 subcircuit has been extinguished. The onset of delta
  expression in the NSMs is thereby synchronized with the disappearance of wnt8 from
  those same cells in the center of the moving torus. (D) VFN for endoderm at early
  mesenchyme blastula. The blimp1/wnt8 subcircuit is now active as a result of previous
  Wnt8 diffusion from the NSM (). Delta-Notch signaling occurs in response to the
  NSM Delta ligand, further enhanced by transcription of the Notch receptor, which
  in this domain is not subject to Blimp1 repression; however, delta expression is
  reciprocally forbidden by Notch-driven HesC expression.
