caption: Model for PD-L1 upregulation in response to DNA double-strand breaks. In
  the newly proposed model in the context of DSB repair pathway choice, the Ku70/80
  complex binds rapidly to all the DSB ends, allowing NHEJ to make the first attempt
  at repair immediately after IR, , . The Ku70/80 complex promotes NHEJ, whereas it
  prevents unscheduled resection by blocking the access of DNA nucleases. DSBs also
  activate ATM, a central signal transducer. ATM then activates DNA end resection,
  . ATR/Chk1 is activated onto the resected RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
  and at the same time BRCA2 promotes the switch from RPA to RAD51 on ssDNA in the
  HR pathway. Thus, based on the repair switch model from Ku-binding to HR, our findings
  suggest a defect in a DSB repair protein, i.e. a defect in either Ku70/80 complex
  or BRCA2 leads to the upregulation of PD-L1 expression via Chk1 activation following
  EXO1-dependent resection. Furthermore, we showed that STAT1/3 and IRF1 are activated
  in response to DSBs. Notably, PD-L1 upregulation requires IRF1, strongly suggesting
  that DSB-dependent PD-L1 upregulation is induced by the canonical STAT–IRF1 pathway
