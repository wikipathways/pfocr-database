caption: Natriuretic peptide signaling in adipose tissue. Cardiac stress, such as
  HFpEF, induces increased natriuretic peptides levels. These natriuretic peptides
  bind to their receptor, natriuretic peptide active receptor (NPRA), in the adipocyte,
  and activate guanylyl cyclase (GC), increasing cGMP levels. Adipocytes also express
  natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPRC) that functions to remove natriuretic
  peptides from the circulation. The cGMP produced by NPRA-GC activates cGMP dependent
  protein kinase (PKG), which triggers a signaling cascade that results in enhanced
  lipolysis and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK), culminating
  in the transcription of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and inducing the brown fat
  thermogenic program. In parallel, other stimuli, such as cold exposure, can also
  induce this program via the β-adrenergic signaling pathway. Here catecholamines
  bind to the β-adrenergic receptor which activates adenylate cyclase (AC), producing
  cAMP. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits (R) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase
  (PKA) releases its catalytic subunits (C), which also activate lipolysis and induce
  p38-MAPK phosphorylation. During obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, the natriuretic
  peptide signaling is diminished leading to a decrease in the browning thermogenic
  program. Red and green arrows represent the down-regulatory or up-regulatory effects
  that metabolic disorders have in this signaling pathway. To date, the combined effect
  that obesity and HFpEF would have in adipose tissue is unknown and needs further
  investigation.
