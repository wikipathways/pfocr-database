caption: GABA receptor expression in neurons and OPCs. A Activation of ionotropic
  GABAA receptors induces Cl− influx to hyperpolarize neurons. The GABAB1 subunit
  confers ligand-binding, while the B2 subunit transduces the GABA signal into the
  cell. Activation of the neuronal GABAB receptor induces dissociation of Gα and Gβγ
  subunits. The Gα subunit inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC), while Gβγ activates G protein-gated
  inwardly rectifying K+ channels and inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs),
  thereby reducing neurotransmitter release. The regulation of VGCCs can occur pre-
  and postsynaptically. B Different from neurons, in OPCs, activation of GABAA receptors
  causes a Cl− efflux and depolarization based on the higher levels of cytosolic Cl−.
  GABAB receptors expressed in OPCs are thought to transduce signals via Gα with or
  without association of Gβγ; or via the Gqpathway linked to phospholipase C, further
  increasing intracellular Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum.
