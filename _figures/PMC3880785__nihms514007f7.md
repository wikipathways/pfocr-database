caption: Proposed model for the mechanism of SHP-1–mediated inhibition of M. pneumoniae-activated
  TLR2 signaling in normal and asthmatic airway epithelial cells. The ligation of
  TLR2 by M. pneumoniae initiates TLR2-mediated proinflammatory signaling pathway,
  resulting in the production of IL-8. M. pneumoniae binding to TLR2 activates and
  recruits SHP-1, which inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF-κB directly or through
  inhibition of PI3K/Akt abrogating NF-κB activation and subsequently prevents IL-8
  production. In addition, the nuclear SHP-1 may also inhibit NF-κB function by certain
  nuclear mediators (left panel). In asthmatic airway epithelial cells, M. pneumoniae-induced
  SHP-1 activation is defective, which contributes to the increased activation of
  PI3K/Akt and NF-κB, as well as abundant IL-8 production (right panel).
