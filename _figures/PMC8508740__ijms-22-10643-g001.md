caption: Depiction of glucagon signalling. The glucagon signaling pathway promotes
  glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, resulting in a significant increase in blood
  glucose. Glucagon (red ball) binds to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and provides
  a conformational status that activates G proteins. (A) The heterotrimeric G-proteins
  with α, β, and γ subunits, interact with the receptor, and replace the GDP molecule
  (to the α subunit) with a GTP molecule. Thus, α subunit leaves the β and γ subunits,
  and specifically activates adenylate cyclase. The latter catalyzes the conversion
  of ATP to cAMP (cyclic Adenosine Mono Phosphate), which binds to protein kinase
  A (PKA). PKA, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylate a single serine residue
  of the bifunctional polypeptide chain containing both the enzymes fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase
  and phosphofructokinase-2. This regulates the reaction catalyzing fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
  (a potent activator of phosphofructokinase-1, the enzyme that is the primary regulatory
  step of glycolysis) by slowing the rate of its formation, thereby inhibiting the
  flux of the glycolysis pathway and allowing gluconeogenesis to predominate. The
  inactive form of glycogen phosphorylase b (PYG b) undergoes phosphorylation, allowing
  it to convert into the active form, phosphorylase a (PYG a), which releases glucose
  1-phosphate from glycogen polymers. (B) The binding with a subunit Gq leads to activation
  of the phospholipase-C (PLC)-inositol 3 phosphate (I3P) pathway, inducing the release
  of Ca++.
