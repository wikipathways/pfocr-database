caption: Schematic diagram of CaMKII regulates Notch1 signaling through proteasomal
  degradation of SMRT. Frizzled (Fz), and Ror1/2 that mediates Wnt5a/Ca2+signaling
  has not yet been elucidated, however, the formation of a trimeric complex with Fz
  and Ror1/2 and the PDZ domain-mediated binding with dishevelled (Dvl) could be important.
  In this study, we evaluated that the mechanism by which Wnt up-regulates Notch1
  target genes. We demonstrated that Wnt5a induced CaMKII enhances Notch transcriptional
  activity. CaMKII physically interacts with SMRT and disrupts the SMRT-RBP-Jk transcription
  complex through degradation of SMRT. Dissociation of SMRT from RBP-Jk induced by
  CaMKII activates Hes1 and Hes5 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, CaMKII can
  phosphorylate SMRT and activate the Notch1 signaling pathway. The kinase activity
  of CaMKII is necessary for up-regulation of the transcription activity of Notch1
  target genes. The results of this study suggest that CaMKII is a crucial regulator
  for signal cross-talk between Wnt5a and Notch signaling via down-regulation of the
  SMRT protein level.
