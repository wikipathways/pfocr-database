caption: 'Riboflavin biosynthetic pathway. The riboflavin pathway starts with the
  hydrolytic release of formate and inorganic pyrophosphate from (1) GTP catalyzed
  by GTP cyclohydrolase II (GTPCHII) giving rise to the pyrimidine derivative: (2)
  2,5-diamin-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5’-phosphate [32] (DA6RP5P). This product
  is converted into (4) 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione 5’-phosphate
  (ARPP) via (3) 5-amino-6-ribosylamino-2,4(1H, 3H)-pyrimidinedione 5''-phosphate
  (A6RP5P) reactions catalyzed by 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-(5-phosphoribosylamino)pyrimidine
  deaminase (PYRD) and 5-amino-6-(5-phosphoribosylamino)uracil reductase (PYRR). ARPP
  is converted into ARP by a hypothetical phosphatase, not yet identified in plants
  [39]. The resulting pyrimidine derivative yields (8) 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine
  (DMRYL) by condensation with (7) 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate (DHB4P) catalyzed
  by lumazine synthase, (LS) which is obtained from (6) ribulose 5-phosphate (Rub5P)
  by a skeletal rearrangement (by the action of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate
  synthase (DHBPS)) [39]. The final step of the biosynthetic pathway yields (9) riboflavin
  and the pyrimidine catalyzed by riboflavin synthase (RS). Adapted from Fischer and
