caption: Proposed mechanism of Toll-like receptor (TLR) action for potential application
  in antitumor therapy. Activation of p53 by DNA stress or anticancer drugs results
  in enhanced TLR signaling. Activated TLR induces autophagy by modulating Bcl-2/XL
  and p27 by recruitment of MAP1S through a noncanonical pathway. TLR3 signaling activates
  caspase 3 and caspase 8 via receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and induces apoptosis.
  Flagellin induces cell apoptosis via TLR5 and activates caspase 1 via neuronal apoptosis
  inhibitory protein 5 (Naip5)/NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4)
  pathway.
