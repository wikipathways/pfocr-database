caption: Lithium inhibits the PI cycle, which is activated following stimulation of
  G-coupled neurotransmitter receptors (GPCRs). PLC mediates the hydrolysis of phosphotidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to the secondary messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol
  trisphosphate (IP3), which in turn activate downstream signaling pathways, including
  protein kinase C (PKC), and IP3 receptor (IP3R)/ER stress/unfolded protein response
  (UPR). In detail, lithium inhibits (a) the reuptake of inositol (I), as well as
  IMPase and IPPase (b), which results in overall depletion of IP3 (c). In this way,
  lithium prevents autophagy impairment and apoptosis that are bound to IP3R-related
  ER stress, massive Ca2+ release from the ER, abnormal UPR, as well as the accumulation
  of misfolded/unfolded proteins and damaged mitochondria (d). Abnormal UPR consists,
  for instance, of upregulation of TRAF/JNK and XBP1, which fosters apoptotic events
  while impairing autophagy. At the same time, through inhibition of PKC and GSK3β
  (e), lithium inhibits potentially deleterious effects triggered downstream of these
  pathways. These include (f) oxidative stress due to accumulation of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) leaked from damaged mitochondria and downregulation of the nuclear
  factor erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2 (NRF2), which, besides its antioxidant
  effects, is also related to mitophagy and mitochondriogenesis; (g) impaired transcription
  of neurotrophic, neuroprotective, and antioxidant genes, such as BDNF, VEFG, Bcl-2,
  and NRF2, which is instead reinstated by lithium via both GSK3β inhibition and activation
  of the CREB transcription factor placed downstream of GPCRs; (h) production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines underlying activation of the STAT/interferon gamma (INFγ)/nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kβ) pathway; and (i) accumulation
  of hyperphosphorylated tau, which is bound to cytoskeletal alterations and autophagy
  impairment.
