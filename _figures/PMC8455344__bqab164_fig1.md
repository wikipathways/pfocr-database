caption: 'Potential mechanisms contributing to hepatic diabetic neuropathy. A, The
  SAR pathway and oxidative stress. Hyperglycemia can promote sorbitol accumulation
  in cells, leading to oxidative stress. This in turn can lead to microvascular damages
  and neuropathy. B, Hyperglycemia-induced glycation. Glycation of proteins can alter
  their structure and function, leading to the production of AGEs. Through their action
  on RAGE, AGEs contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation. This results in alterations
  in neuronal functions and peripheral neuropathy. C, Inflammation. Neuropathy has
  been associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. Abbreviations: AGEs,
  advanced glycation end products; RAGE, receptor for AGEs; SAR, sorbitol-aldose reductase;
  SORD, sorbitol dehydrogenase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α.'
