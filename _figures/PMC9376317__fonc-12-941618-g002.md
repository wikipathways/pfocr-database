caption: Mechanisms by which some treatments affect ferroptosis and tumors. Radiation
  therapy can generate ROS, induce lipid peroxidation, upregulate ASCL4, promote PUFA
  synthesis, provide a substrate for lipid peroxidation, deplete GSH and affect GPX4
  to affect ferroptosis. IFN-γ in immunotherapy can affect system Xc-, which further
  affects ferroptosis through the GPX4 pathway. PD-L1 can directly inhibit tumors.
  Nanotherapy can deliver iron and chemotherapeutic drugs to cells to achieve better
  therapeutic effects. The impact of the immune microenvironment on ferroptosis and
  tumors cannot be ignored.
