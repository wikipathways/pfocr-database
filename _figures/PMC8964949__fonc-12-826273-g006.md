caption: 'Sketch of ADAM8-dependent effects caused by regulation of miR-181a-5p in
  GBM cells. ADAM8 with homologous domains including the metalloprotease domain (MP),
  the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain (DC), the EGF-like domain (EGF), the transmembrane
  (TM), and the cytoplasmic domain (CD). ADAM8 activates intracellular signaling cascades
  by STAT3 and MAPK in the presence of the cytoplasmic domain. ADAM8/STAT3/miR-181a/SPP1
  axis: ADAM8 dependent STAT3 activation downregulates miR-181a-5p, as miR-181a-5p
  targets SPP1, disinhibition of SPP1 leads to several tumor progressing effects such
  as induction of angiogenesis and enhanced immune cell recruitment. ADAM8/MAPK/MMP9
  axis: ADAM8 activates the MAPK pathway, the transcription factor CREB-1 induces
  MMP9 transcription and inhibits miR-181a-5p transcription. MMP9 promotes tumor cell
  proliferation and invasion. By targeting CREB-1, ERK2, and MEK1, miR-181a-5p downregulates
  MMP9 expression most likely by an indirect mechanism. Created with BioRender.com.'
