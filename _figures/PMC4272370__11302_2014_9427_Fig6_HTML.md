caption: The CD39/CD73 pathway modulates regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. The activation
  of T cell receptor (TCR), expressed on Tregs, induces CD39 activity. This increment
  of ATP-metabolizing activity is critical for the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs
  because it facilitates the pericellular generation of adenosine, a substantial component
  of the immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory functions of Tregs. The inhibitory
  action of Treg-derived adenosine can be ascribed to the activation of A2A receptors
  expressed on T effector cells, which undergo reduced immune activity. In addition,
  adenosine generation triggers a self-reinforcing loop of Treg functions because
  the stimulation of A2A receptors expressed on these cells elicits their expansion
  and increases their immunoregulatory activity. (Reproduced from [], with permission
