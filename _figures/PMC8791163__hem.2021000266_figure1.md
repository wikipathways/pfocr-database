caption: 'Red blood cell metabolism. Glycolysis (the Embden-Meyerhof pathway) generates
  ATP required for cation transport and for membrane maintenance, while NADH maintains
  hemoglobin iron in a reduced state. The hexose monophosphate shunt generates the
  NADPH that is used to reduce GSH, which protects the red blood cell against oxidant
  stress (); 6-phosphogluconate, after decarboxylation, can be recycled via pentose
  sugars to glycolysis. At the side of glycolysis is the Rapoport-Luebering cycle,
  which provides 2,3-isphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG): its level is a critical determinant
  of the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. G6PD deficiency is highly prevalent in many
  parts of the world (); all other enzymopathies are rare to ultrarare. Among them,
  the order of prevalence is PK, followed by P5N, followed by GPI.'
