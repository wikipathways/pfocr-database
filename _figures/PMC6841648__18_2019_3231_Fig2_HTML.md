caption: Role of nucleolus in controlling proliferation of cancer cells. ARF and NPM1
  are key nucleolar proteins that regulate proliferation through tumor suppressor
  p53 and oncogene c-Myc. A The binding of ARF to MDM2 allows the complex to translocate
  to the nucleolus allowing for the activation of the p53 pathway. B Binding of NPM1
  and nucleolar ARF acts as a checkpoint for ribosome biogenesis. C Binding of NPM1
  to c-Myc regulates hyperproliferation and transformation. D Role of c-Myc is context
  dependent. An increase in nucleolar c-Myc causes the stabilization of ARF resulting
  in ULF binding to c-Myc leading to the activation of the p53 pathway
