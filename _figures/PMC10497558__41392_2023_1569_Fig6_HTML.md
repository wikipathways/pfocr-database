caption: Aspartate metabolism in solid tumor. The high expression of SLC1A3 in tumor
  cells promoted the absorption of aspartate, supplemented the low aspartate state
  caused by ASNase, and produced resistance to ASNase therapy. SLC25A22 expressed
  on mitochondria can increase the intake of mitochondrial aspartate, promote mitochondrial
  function and reduce oxidative stress. KRAS activates NRF2-ATF4 axis through PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway, promotes ASNS transcription and increases intracellular asparagine
  concentration. Asparagine (Asn) can bind to SRC family tyrosine kinase LCK to assist
  in phosphorylation of LCK at Tyr394. Enhance LCK activity and T cell receptor signaling,
  and promote AKT, RAS activation. Asparagine can inhibit AMPK signaling pathway activity
  by binding to LKB1. In T lymphocytic leukemia cells, ATF4 binds to ASNS gene promoter
  through ZBTB1 (Zinc Finger and BTB domain-containing protein 1), promotes ASNS transcription,
  increases intracellular Asparagine concentration. Created with BioRender.com. (The
