caption: 'Methionine metabolism: transsulfuration and hydrogen sulfide synthesis.
  A: the transsulfuration pathway links AdoMet to cysteine biosynthesis. Here homocysteine
  is converted to cysteine (the rate-limiting precursor for glutathione) via a two-step
  enzymatic process catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionase
  (CSE), both requiring vitamin B6. α-Ketobutyrate, the other product of cystathionine
  cleavage, is further metabolized by the mitochondria through the Kreb''s cycle.
  B: hydrogen sulfide synthesis. Although the classical role of CBS and CSE is to
  generate cystathionine and cysteine, respectively, these two enzymes catalyze multiple
  hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-generating reactions using cysteine and homocysteine as substrates.
  The predominant H2S-generating reactions are shown in red. A third pathway uses
  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to yield mercaptopyruvate, which is further converted
  into H2S in a reaction catalyzed by mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST). The
  function of this pathway is primarily catabolic.'
