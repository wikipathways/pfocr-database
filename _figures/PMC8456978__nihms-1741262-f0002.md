caption: Regulation of axon guidance receptors via receptor-coreceptor interactions.
  (A) Coreceptors can enhance guidance receptor functions. In cortical neurons, in
  the absence of RGMa, Lrig2 binds to neogenin to block premature ADAM17-mediated
  proteolytic cleavage of the ECD of neogenin. Binding of RGMa initiates the dissociation
  of Lrig2 and neogenin, allowing neogenin ECD shedding and RGMa-induced neurite growth
  inhibition to occur. (B) Coreceptor binding can switch signaling outputs of guidance
  receptors. (B1) In cortical and striatal neurons, which do not express Nrp1, Sema3E
  acts as a repellent interacting with plexin D1. In subiculum neurons, Nrp1 recruits
  VEGFR2 to mediate a growth promoting response to Sema3E via activating the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. (B2) In spinal cord commissural neurons, APP binds to Dcc to inhibit γ-secretase
  dependent proteolytic cleavage of the Dcc ICD and its potential transcriptional
  activity, and to enhance netrin1-induced attraction via increasing the activation
  of ERK1/2. (C) Receptor-receptor interactions can also function as coincidence detectors
  to induce synergistic effects from two guidance cues. (C1) A schematic depicting
  the spinal cord, the lateral motor column spinal motor neurons that target the limb
  and the developing limb bud divided into ventral and dorsal halves. Expression of
  some genes either in the motor axons or the dorsal limb are shown. (C2) In medial
  LMCs that express EphA4, ephrin-A5 acts as a repellent. In lateral LMCs that express
  ephrinA5, co-detection of GDNF and EphA4 by the GFRα-Ret-ephrin-A5 receptor-coreceptor
  complex mediates axon growth promotion. (C3) Co-stimulation with netrin1 and ephrin-B2
  leads to enhanced phosphorylation of Src kinase, which strengthens repulsion in
  medial LMCs mediated by the Unc5c-EphB2 complex. (C4) In rostral thalamocortical
  neurons, Robo1 binding to its coreceptor FLRT3 enables co-detection of slit1 and
  netrin1, which activates PKA to increase surface Dcc levels via enhanced vesicular
  transport, to facilitate attraction.
