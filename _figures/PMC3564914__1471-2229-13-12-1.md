caption: 'Biosynthesis of hop bitter acids from branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) precursors.a)
  The acyl side-chains of humulone/lupulone are derived from leucine, cohumulone/colupulone
  from valine and adhumulone/adlupulone from isoleucine via the corresponding acyl-CoA
  thioesters. The carbon chain of the BCAAs is shown in red to indicate their incorporation
  into the α- and β-acids. b) Schematic depiction of the major pathways contributing
