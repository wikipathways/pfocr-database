caption: 'The detection of and response to external mechanical stimuli (i.e., compression,
  tension, shear, fluid shear stress) involves multiple pathways and signaling mediators
  including changes in intracellular calcium (Ca2+ ) through the release of intracellular
  Ca2+ stores or entry of extracellular Ca2+ through channels such as the store-operated,
  stretch-activated or mechanosensitive channels and voltage independent or dependent
  Ca2+ channels and the release of ATP and, at lower levels, UTP, following the activation
  of ionotropic P2X and metabotropic, G protein-coupled P2Y receptors in an autocrine/paracrine
  fashion. ATP acts on P2Y2 receptors, the primary ATP/UTP responsive receptor in
  tenocytes, activating the Gαq-protein, driving PLC and producing IP3 and DAG. IP3
  acts on IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels in the ER to mobilize intracellular Ca2+, and
  DAG activates a PKC pathway. PKC and Ca2+ activate adenyl cyclase activity yielding
  cAMP, which stimulates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which may act at Raf
  in the kinase cascade. Rap la,b, Ras-like proteins, regulate the PKA stimulation
  of Raf. P2 receptors may activate other kinases including MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38
  MAPK, and PI3K/AKT(PKB). Initial action of ATP is terminated quickly by membrane-bound
  ecto-NTPases to its metabolites: ADP, AMP, and adenosine. Adenosine activates G
  protein-coupled P1 receptors, activating stimulatory (Gs) or inhibitory (Gi) signaling.
  Polycistin-1 (PC1) is co-localized with the primary cilium and activated when the
  cilium is deformed by fluid shear stress. The shear stress signal is transferred
  from PC1 to PC2 and induces the influx of Ca2+ though PC2, which in turn activates
  intracellular ryanodine receptors through Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. PECAM-1 will
  activate Src when cells are subjected to fluid shear stress. The signal is then
  transferred to VEGFR2 through VE-cadherin and beta-catenin. PI3K are activated by
  VEGFR2 and then integrins are activated. A matrix-integrin-mechanosensory protein
  complex-cytoskeleton machinery is linked to a kinase cascade (tyrosine or nontyrosine
  kinase cascade or the JACSTAT kinase cascade) system. A mechanosensory protein complex
  contains talin, vinculin, tensin, paxillin, Src, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK).
  Activated ERKs enter the nucleus and up-regulate transcription factor expression
  Gun, fos, myc, erg-1) and activate nuclear binding proteins such as NF-κB. A load
  signal may activate a growth factor receptor (P for phosphorylation) with or without
  ligand and activate the same or a similar sequence of kinases (PTKR, protein tyrosine
  kinase receptor; GF, growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor). Gap junctions
  pass IP, which propagates a Ca2+ wave from cell to cell after a mechanical signal
  is detected. Connexin hemichannels can pass ATP outside the cell. In this model,
  a load deformation displaces matrix molecules tethered to clustered integrins at
  focal adhesions. The displacement is transduced to an integrin (b), to an integrin-binding
  protein, and then to associated proteins. AP-1, activator protein-1; CREB, cAMP
