caption: l-cysteine as a substrate for glutathione (GSH) synthesis as well as a source
  of reactive sulfur species (RSS), including sulfane sulfur, bound sulfane sulfur,
  and H2S produced during anaerobic metabolism. l-cysteine can also be metabolized
  by the aerobic pathway to sulfate or taurine. GST—glutathione S-transferase; γ-GT—gamma
  glutamyl transpeptidase; CSE—cystathionine γ-lyase; MST—3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase;
  TST—rhodanese.
