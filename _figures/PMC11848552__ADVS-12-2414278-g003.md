caption: Schematic illustration of HEPD enhancing osteogenesis by promoting M2 and
  pro‐angiogenic polarization of macrophages that facilitate angiogenesis. When the
  polarized BTNF/P(VDF‐TrFE) nanocomposite membrane covered the bone defect, the HEPD
  provided by the membrane downregulates the expression of the M1 marker CD86 and
  inflammatory cytokine TNFα in macrophages, and further induces their polarization
  toward the M2 phenotype, thus establishing an anti‐inflammatory microenvironment.
  Meanwhile, the HEPD also activates the PI3K‐Akt signaling pathway in macrophages
  to enhance their pro‐angiogenic functions, thereby enhancing subsequent angiogenesis
  of endothelial cells. Ultimately, this cascade of biological processes accelerates
  bone defect repair
