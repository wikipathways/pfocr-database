caption: Mechanical cues, including ECM stiffness, externally applied mechanical stretch,
  and flow stress, control YAP/TAZ activity through Hippo dependent or independent
  pathways. the core kinase cascade consisting of MST1/2 and LATS1/2 responds to mechanical
  cues that regulate YAP/TAZ phosphorylation and localization. Mechanical cues also
  bypass these kinases and act through cytoplasmic and nuclear actin to regulate YAP/TAZ
  localization
