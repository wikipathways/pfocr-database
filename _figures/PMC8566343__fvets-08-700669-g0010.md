caption: The comprehensive proteome and acetyl-proteome atlases of liver in pre-laying
  and peak-laying hens. The acetylated proteins involved in the aerobic oxidation
  process of sugar including glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, TCA cycle and oxidative
  phosphorylation, fatty acid b-oxidation, carnitine synthesis, and some amino acid
  metabolism. (A) The acetylated proteins involved in glycolysis. (B) The acetylated
  proteins involved in pathways of PUFA oxidation in peroxisome. (C,D) The acetylated
  proteins involved in pathways including fatty acid synthesis, polyunsaturated fatty
  acid biosynthesis, fatty acid transport, and folate pathway in cytoplasm. (E) The
  acetylated proteins involved in TCA cycle. (F) The acetylated proteins involved
  in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Dark red boxes represent significantly
  upregulated proteins, light blue boxes represent significantly downregulated proteins.
  The circle indicates the processes of TCA cycle. Three consecutive squares represent
  the number of Kac sites (all/up/down). Top left box shows the numbers of all Kac
  sites for an individual protein. Top right box shows the numbers of all upregulated
  Kac sites for an individual protein; the number before the semicolon represents
  the number of significantly upregulated Kac sites. Bottom right box indicates the
  number of all downregulated Kac sites for an individual protein; the number before
  the semicolon represents the number of significantly downregulated Kac sites. The
  pink color represents the protein with significantly upregulated Kac sites, while
  green color represents significantly downregulated Kac sites.
