caption: Red denotes genes with increased expression in the autistic sibling while
  green indicates decreased expression. Note that inflammation, epilepsy, liver disease,
  diabetes, and schizophrenia are among the pathological processes associated with
  this gene network while apoptosis, differentiation, and regulation of action potential
  are among the cellular processes that are influenced by this set of genes.
