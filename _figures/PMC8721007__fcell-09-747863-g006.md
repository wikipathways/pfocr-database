caption: The interaction of metabolism and epigenetics. The intermediate metabolites
  in metabolic pathway play a vital role in regulating the epigenetic modification,
  especially histone acetylation and methylation. The histone acetylation requires
  acetyl-CoA generated from TCA cycle in mitochondria as an essential substrate. On
  the other hand, the histone demethylation needs a-KG from TCA cycle as important
  cofactor of the Jumonji C domain-containing histone demethylases (JMJDs).
