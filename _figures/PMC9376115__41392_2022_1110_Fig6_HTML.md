caption: Small-molecule compounds targeting ferroptosis pathways in cancer. There
  are two main pathways to exert antitumor activity by targeting ferroptosis. The
  intracellular antioxidant stress system mainly relies on GPX4 to remove excess lipid
  peroxide. GPX4 of the antioxidant system will reduce the lipid peroxide PL-OOH to
  the corresponding lipid alcohol PL-OH, so as to reduce the burden of lipid peroxidation
  and protect the cell membrane from damage. Cystine enters the cytoplasm through
  SLC7A11, transforms into cystine, and enters the GSH biosynthesis pathway. GSH is
  involved in the hydrolysis of PL-OOH by GPX4. The inhibition of GSH synthesis or
  the inactivation of GPX4 can make the excess PL-OOH in cells unable to be cleared,
  resulting in cell oxidative damage and the occurrence of ferroptosis. It is worth
  noting that in this process, BAP1, ATF3, Beclin1 and p53 will inhibit the function
  of SLC7A11. When intracellular iron is overloaded, a large number of free radicals
  can react with PUFA of cell membrane phospholipids under the catalysis of ester
  oxygenase and iron, and produce a large number of PL-OOH through the promotion of
  POR, a positive regulatory protein of iron death phospholipid peroxidation in tumor
  cells, resulting in ferroptosis. In addition to the direct pathway of PUFA mediated
  PL-OOH production, PUFA can also be incorporated into phospholipid membrane through
  ACSL4, esterified into PUFA COA, esterified into PL through LPCAT3, and then oxidized
  into toxic PL-OOH by lipoxygenases (LOXs). In addition, the extracellular Fe3+ is
  combined with transferrin, transported into the cell through TFR1 and reduced to
  Fe2+, and then stored in the intracellular LIP with the help of intracellular NRF2.
  Fe2+ can transfer electrons to produce free radicals or ROS with oxidation ability
  through Fenton reaction with peroxide, so as to promote the oxidation process of
  LOXs

  description: Small-molecule compounds targeting ferroptosis pathways in cancer.
    There are two main pathways to exert antitumor activity by targeting ferroptosis.
    The intracellular antioxidant stress system mainly relies on GPX4 to remove excess
    lipid peroxide. GPX4 of the antioxidant system will reduce the lipid peroxide
    PL-OOH to the corresponding lipid alcohol PL-OH, so as to reduce the burden of
    lipid peroxidation and protect the cell membrane from damage. Cystine enters the
    cytoplasm through SLC7A11, transforms into cystine, and enters the GSH biosynthesis
    pathway. GSH is involved in the hydrolysis of PL-OOH by GPX4. The inhibition of
    GSH synthesis or the inactivation of GPX4 can make the excess PL-OOH in cells
    unable to be cleared, resulting in cell oxidative damage and the occurrence of
    ferroptosis. It is worth noting that in this process, BAP1, ATF3, Beclin1 and
    p53 will inhibit the function of SLC7A11. When intracellular iron is overloaded,
    a large number of free radicals can react with PUFA of cell membrane phospholipids
    under the catalysis of ester oxygenase and iron, and produce a large number of
    PL-OOH through the promotion of POR, a positive regulatory protein of iron death
    phospholipid peroxidation in tumor cells, resulting in ferroptosis. In addition
    to the direct pathway of PUFA mediated PL-OOH production, PUFA can also be incorporated
    into phospholipid membrane through ACSL4, esterified into PUFA COA, esterified
