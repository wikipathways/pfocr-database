caption: Illustration representing the sites of action of different polyphenols in
  tuberculosis pathway. Mycobacterium tuberculosis stimulate the secretion of TNF-alpha,
  IL-1B, NF-kB, HIF1A, which cause the activation of different MMPs and TGF-B. As
  a result, fibrosis, granuloma, and cavitation occur which ultimately create restriction,
  obstruction and pulmonary impairment in tuberculosis. Polyphenols could work on
  this pathway to prevent tuberculosis. The figure was designed by Biorender.com program
