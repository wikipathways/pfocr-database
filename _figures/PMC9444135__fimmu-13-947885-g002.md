caption: How purinergic receptor activity induces therapy resistance through metabolic
  reprogramming in the tumor cell. Due to the activity of the P2X7R and the increase
  of intracellular Ca2+, Akt and then HIF-1a is activated. HIF-1a stimulates GLUT
  to allow glucose to enter the cell and trigger the glycolysis pathway. HK, one of
  the enzymes in the glycolysis pathway, can inhibit tumor cell apoptosis by binding
  to VDAC on mitochondria and inhibiting it. Pyruvate from the glycolysis pathway
  is mainly converted to lactate through the Warburg effect. After leaving the cell,
  lactate can inhibit the anti-tumor immune response by acting on PD-L1. On the other
  hand, some pyruvate with the effect of PDH, ACC, and FAS eventually convert to fatty
  acids (palmitic acid). P2X7R activity also stimulates FAS and ACC. Then the fatty
  acid produced in the cytoplasm enters the mitochondria and the FAO pathway and produces
  long-chain saturated fatty acids. By reducing membrane fluidity, endocytosis, passive
  diffusion of drugs, and apoptosis, long-chain saturated fatty acids cause tumor
  cell therapy resistance. Also, ATP produced through glycolysis and OXPHOS help the
  drug export via ABC transporter. ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
