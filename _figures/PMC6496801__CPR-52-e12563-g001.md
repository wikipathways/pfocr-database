caption: Caspase‐1–dependent and independent pyroptotic pathway. In caspase‐1–dependent
  pyroptosis pathway, the cells activate their respective inflammasome (including
  NLRP3, AIM2 or pyrin) through the action of pathogen‐associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs) and danger‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), under the stimulation
  of hyperlipidaemia, hyperglycaemia and inflammation; NLRP3 oligomerizes and recruits
  ASC and pro–caspase‐1, triggering the activation of caspase‐1 and the maturation
  and secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as IL‐1β and IL‐18. GSDMD‐N formed
  by inflammatory caspase cleavage then mediates cell membrane pore formation, and
  promotes inflammatory factor release, cell swelling and pyroptosis. In caspase‐1–independent
  pyroptosis pathway, Gram‐negative bacterial cell wall component LPS activates caspase‐4/5/11
  pathway to mediate cell pyroptosis
