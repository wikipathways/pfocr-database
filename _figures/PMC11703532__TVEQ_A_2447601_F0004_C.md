caption: Box plot representation of the selected serum and urine metabolites from
  the tryptophan metabolism comparing healthy controls (green; n = 84) with specific
  CKD stages. Significance levels (*<0.05; **<0.001) for the comparison healthy vs.
  CKD (all stages) are provided. Clear up- or downward trends in the indole, serotonin
  and kynurenine pathways are portrayed in accordance with CKD progression from stage
  2 (pink; n = 59) to stage 3 (red; n = 29) and 4 (dark red; n = 6). Urine metabolites
  are normalized to urine creatinine
