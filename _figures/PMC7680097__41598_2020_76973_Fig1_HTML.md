caption: Simplified cholesterol metabolic pathway. Cholesterol can be synthesised
  via either the Kandutsch–Russell Pathway (on left) or the Bloch Pathway (on right).
  Symbols next to each metabolite indicate whether it has been identified as either
  increased (up arrow), decreased (down arrow) or unchanged (dash) in the putamen
  (blue) and caudate (red) human post-mortem tissue (Kreilaus et al. 2016). ACAT 1
  acyl-coenzyme cholesterol acyltransferase, CE cholesteryl ester.
