caption: FPP is diverted from the central mevalonate pathway via the action of sesquiterpene
  synthases (EAS and HPS)to generate EA and premnaspirodiene. Successive hydroxylations
  of EA at C-1 and C-3 are catalyzed by EAH to yield capsidiol. Successive hydroxylations
  of premnaspirodieneat C-2 with a preferred order, or hydroxylation followed by dehydration,
  for solavetivone biosynthesis has not been established. Relevant carbon atoms and
  rings are numbered.
