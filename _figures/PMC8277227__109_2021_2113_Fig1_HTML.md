caption: The interplay of DAMPs, TLR4, and proinflammatory cytokines in pulmonary
  fibrosis centered around macrophages and fibroblasts. (1) Injury to the cells either
  from a viral infection, chemical/mechanical trauma, or immune-mediated damage causes
  the release of DAMPs in the microenvironment. (2) DAMPs stimulate and activate macrophages
  and fibroblasts through a TLR4-MD2 → MyD88-mediated pathway. (3) Activated macrophages
  release proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-17, and IL-1β in the tissue
  microenvironment that, (4) along with TGF-β, activate fibroblasts to become profibrotic
  and deposit collagen and ECM components like fibronectin and tenascin-C. This causes
  stiffness of ECM and oxidative stress in the microenvironment, which (5) causes
  the release of more DAMPs leading to the vicious cycle of pulmonary fibrosis. DAMP,
  damage-associated molecular patterns; HMGB1, high-mobility group box 1; eCIRP, extracellular
  cold-inducible RNA-binding protein; HSPB5, heat shock protein B5; TLR4, Toll-like-receptor
  4; MD2, myeloid differentiation factor 2; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary
  response 88; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells;
  ECM, extracellular matrix
