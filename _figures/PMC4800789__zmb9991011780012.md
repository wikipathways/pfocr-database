caption: Summary of the scaffold role of Ahk1 in the HOG pathway. (A) Involvement
  of the Ahk1 scaffold in the protein interaction network in the HKR1 subbranch of
  the HOG pathway. Protein-protein interactions are shown by double-headed arrows.
  Black arrows indicate constitutive interactions, and red arrows indicate osmostress-induced
  interactions. Sho1 forms a planar oligomeric structure, to which Opy2 and Hkr1 bind
  through their TM domains. Opy2 and Hkr1 bind each other through their extracellular
  domains. Signal flow through the Hog1 kinase cascade is shown in lavender. Membrane
  proteins are shown in blue. PM, plasma membrane. (B) A schematic model of three
  MAPK cascades that commonly involve the Ste11 MAPKKK. Signal flow is indicated by
  arrows. Cross talk activation of Kss1 by osmostress in the absence of Ahk1 is also
  shown. In each pathway, many signaling molecules are omitted for the sake of simplicity.
