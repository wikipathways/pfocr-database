caption: Mechanisms of bile acid feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis. Bile
  acid–activated signaling inhibits CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 and therefore reduces hepatic
  bile acid synthesis. The bile acid response element (BARE) located in the CYP7A1
  gene promoter contains AGGTCA-like direct repeats. HNF4α and LRH1 bind to the BARE
  and stimulate CYP7A1 gene transcription. In hepatocytes, bile acids activate FXR,
  which induces the repressor SHP. SHP interacts with and represses the transactivating
  action of HNF4α and LRH, a process that involves the recruitment of corepressor
  complex and chromatin remodeling enzymes (indicated as pathway 1). In the intestine,
  bile acid–activated FXR induces FGF15 (FGF19 in humans), which binds and activates
  FGFR4 on the hepatocytes. FGFR4 activates intracellular signaling pathways, such
  as ERK, protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which leads
  to the repression of CYP7A1 gene transcription (indicated in pathway 2).
