caption: Steroid synthesis pathway and aromatization. Abiraterone is a novel cytochrome
  P450 (CYP)17 inhibitor that irreversibly inhibits the generation of adrenal steroids
  downstream of CYP17. It suppresses the generation of both androgens and estrogens.
  Flutamide competes with testosterone for androgen receptors (ARs), preventing their
  activation. Tamoxifen is an antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER), blocking its
  downstream signaling. Anastrozole and letrozole block the production of estrogens
  by inhibiting the enzyme aromatase.
