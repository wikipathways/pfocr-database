  The PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Hippo pathways exert opposite effects on follicular development
  during the gonadotropin-independent phase. Activation of the PI3K pathway is crucial
  for each growing stage of the follicle, especially at the primordial and primary
  stages (, ). The Hippo pathway acts in a coordinated manner with PI3K in order to
  accelerate primordial follicle activation and promote follicular development ().
  Bottom: The two pathways maintain their concerted action on follicular development
  during the gonadotropin-dependent phase of follicular growth, and especially on
  the maturation of granulosa cells and oocytes in the preovulatory follicles, thereby
  assuring regulated follicular activation and high oocyte quality (, ). Various disease
  states, aging, and the uniqueness of each woman, by influencing this balance, may
  affect the response to different gonadotropin preparations, and consequently, the
  outcome of the IVF. The activation status of key components of the PI3K and Hippo
  pathways may serve as a prognostic or predictive biomarker that can help clinicians
  guide treatment planning. (RG, Regulatory Genes).'
