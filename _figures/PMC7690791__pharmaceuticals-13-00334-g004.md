caption: 'Main intracellular signalling pathways after activation of 5-HT2A-C receptors
  by N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The main downstream signalling pathway of these
  receptors, for a long time assumed to be critical for the action of psychedelics
  [], is coupled to Gq, resulting in the activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific
  phospholipase C (PLC) [,,]. PLC hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol membrane lipids,
  resulting in the generation of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG) []. Whilst IP3 leads to calcium release from intracellular vesicles, resulting
  in depolarization of the neuronal membrane, DAG remains bound to the membrane and
  activates a second messenger, the protein kinase C (PKC), ultimately responsible
  for the mediation of the cellular physiological response. Another signalling pathway
  later identified, whose significance is still not well characterised [], correspond
  to the stimulation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), that consequently hydrolyses arachidonic
  acid (AA)-containing phospholipids, producing free AA and lysophospholipid []. 5-HT:
