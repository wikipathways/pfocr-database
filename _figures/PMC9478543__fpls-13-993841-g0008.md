caption: Putative working model of the LpNAC17 regulatory function in the transgenic
  tobacco in response to salt stress treatment. Overexpression of LpNAC17 in tobacco
  activates the expression of stress-related genes and sodium and potassium ion balance
  factors, and possibly the ABA signaling pathway, leading to lower accumulation of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and higher Pn under salt stress and thus improved
  salt tolerance.
