caption: Both the EMP (red) and the OPP (blue) pathways share intermediates with the
  Calvin–Benson cycle (circled in red), but not the ED (green) pathway. The EMP and
  OPP pathways might thus form futile cycles under, for example, mixotrophic conditions
  when glycolytic route and CO2 fixation via the Calvin–Benson cycle run in parallel.
  This is not true for the ED pathway.
