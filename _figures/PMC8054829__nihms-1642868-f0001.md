caption: Schematic diagram of various ways the type I IFN pathway is modulated in
  SLE. Nucleic acid containing immune complexes formed by SLE-associated autoantibodies
  are taken up by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Genetic variants in IRF5 and IRF7
  can result in greater type I IFN production, particularly in those patients with
  autoantibodies. Type I IFN then signals through the IFNAR receptor, and polymorphisms
  such as the SLE-associated STAT4 allele result in augmented signaling downstream
  of the receptor. Polymorphisms in regulatory molecules, such as ILT3, can result
  in defective function and decreased ability to negatively regulate inflammatory
  pathways. In many patients, this multifactorial process leads to persistent dysregulation
  of the IFN pathway at multiple locations.
