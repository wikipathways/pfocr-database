caption: 'Schematic drawing showing the controversial role of IL-12 on bone resorption
  at apical periodontal sites. The progression of dental pulp infection triggers an
  inflammatory response in periapical tissues. Inflammatory cells, such as macrophages,
  are recruited for that region and release proinflammatory mediators. One of those
  mediators is IL-12, which induces Th1 cells to produce IFN-γ. The IL-12-IFN-γ pathway
  can induce bone resorption by production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α
  and IL-1β, which leads to the activation of osteoclasts. In contrast, this pathway
  is also involved in the degradation of the RANK adapter protein, TRAF6, which reduces
  RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. In this context, dendritic cells and naïve
  CD4+ cells also produce the IL-12 family member cytokine IL-23, which induces the
  differentiation of Th17 cells. These cells release IL-17, enhancing the IFN-γ production.
  In favor of this proinflammatory environment IL-12 also may blockade Th2 cytokines,
  stimulating the progression of infection-induced periapical lesions. These opposing
  mechanisms may explain the discrepant findings regarding IL-12 and IFN-γ in the
  pathogenesis of periapical lesions. IFN-γ: interferon-γ; RANK: receptor activator
  of nuclear factor κB; TRAF6: tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6.'
