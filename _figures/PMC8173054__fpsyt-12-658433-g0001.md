caption: Schematic representation of the endocannabinoid system. Depicted are several
  biosynthetic and degradation pathways as well as endocannabinoid receptors that
  are involved in the action of the endocannabinoids, anandamide (AEA), 2-Arachidonoylglycerol
  (2-AG), and of the endocannabinoid-like ethanolamines, oleoylethanolamide (OEA)
  and N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA). AEA, PEA, and OEA share the similar biosynthetic
  pathway after originating from membrane's phospholipids are synthesized post-synaptically
  by the action of the enzyme, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase
  D (NAPE-PLD). 2-AG is instead produced by the action of the enzyme, diacylglycerol
  lipase (DAGL), prior to be secreted by post-synaptic terminals and act at pre-synaptic
  cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55). AEA,
  PEA, and OEA can act at membrane receptors or be taken up pre-synaptically through
  endocannabinoid membrane transporters (EMT). They can be degraded by the action
  of the enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) into ethanolamine and arachidonic
  acid (AA) pre-synaptically. These endocannabinoids influence each concentration
  by competing for the catalytic action of FAAH. For instance, increased levels of
  AEA can compete for the catalytic action of FAAH and thereby result in an increase
  of PEA and OEA levels or vice versa, PEA and, mostly, OEA by competing for FAAH
  catalytic action may increase AEA levels. PEA may also decrease FAAH expression
  and thereby elevate its own and the levels of OEA and AEA. 2-AG is instead degraded
  by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) to glycerol and AA. While OEA and PEA fail to
  bind to the classic CB1 and CB2, they can influence the action of AEA at transient
  receptor potential channels of vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1). PEA may activate peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α) as well as TPRV1. What makes the
  endocannabinoid system attractive for developing novel biomarkers concerns the fact
  that it is constituted by several components, including synthesizing and degrading
  enzymes to receptors and endogenous modulators and it is widely distributed in the
  brain. These neuromodulators are implicated in several mechanisms that regulate
  neuronal functions, including cognition and emotional behavioral regulation. Likewise,
  synthetic agents that stimulate endocannabinoid receptors or act on the degrading/biosynthetic
  enzyme constitute a valid pharmacological approach for treatment of several neuropsychiatric
  disorders. For instance, the action of AEA binding at CB1 and of PEA at PPAR-α has
  been associated with a fast improvement of emotional behavioral deficits, including
  aggressive behavior and impulsivity (, ), which are behavioral endophenotypes of
  human behavioral-traits of suicide risk. In humans, studies show higher CB1 and
  CB1-mediated G-protein activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
  of suicide victims (). Studies conducted in alcoholic suicide victims have evidenced
  enhanced CB1 activation and increased AEA and 2-AG concentrations in the DLPFC ().
  Furthermore, CB1 expression was increased in the ventral striatum of suicide individuals
  who struggled with alcoholism (). Intriguingly, both FAAH expression and activity
  was found upregulated in post-mortem brain of suicide subjects (). Together, these
  findings underlie profound deficits within the endocannabinoid system. More studies
  are warranted to understand the precise role of endocannabinoid levels, their biosynthetic
  enzymes as well as their receptors (CB1 and PPAR-α) in suicide victims.
