caption: Graphical abstract to present metabolic heterogeneity in central and peripheral
  tumour areas of LumA and LumB. Red and blue line indicate positive and negative
  correlations and red and blue arrow means increase and decrease in central or peripheral
  areas. Metabolites highlighted in bold were detected within the NMR spectroscopy‐based
  metabolomics approach. Pink underlines indicate metabolites that are used as imaging
  tracers. Green circles represent significantly differentially expressed genes associated
  with metabolic pathways. α‐KG, α‐ketoglutarate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ADP,
