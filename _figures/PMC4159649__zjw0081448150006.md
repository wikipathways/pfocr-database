caption: Identified glycotransferases involved in O-glycosylation and associated biosynthetic
  pathway. A, identified glycotransferases were quantified in all four colon segments
  based on the z-score transformed summed protein intensities for ascending (a), transverse
  (t), descending (d), and sigmoid (s) colon (n = 4). The O-glycans of the MUC2 mucin
  as determined previously have shown that human colon has only core 3– and core 4–based
  O-glycan structures. The biosynthetic pathways of the glycans observed were confirmed
  by the core glycotransferases identified. The lower highlighted area shows the extension
  of core 4 glycans, which can terminate in various structures. The highlighted region
  in the top left shows the identified sulfotransferases acting on both core 3 and
  core 4 structures. Proteins highlighted by an asterisk (*) were significantly (p
  < 0.05) regulated between ascending and sigmoid colon.
