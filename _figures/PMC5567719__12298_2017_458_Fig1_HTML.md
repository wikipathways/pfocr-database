caption: 'Six proteins are known to mediate FLC RNA regulatory process: FCA, FLK,
  FPA, FY, PCFS4 and PEP. FPA interacts with FCA, and both control alternative polyadenylation
  of antisense RNAs and 3′-end formation at FLC. FCA interacts with the RNA 3′-end
  processing protein FY. PCFS4 interacts with FCA and regulates the alternative polyadenylation
  of FCA. These 4 proteins may present in a protein complex and interplay to repress
  FLC expression via RNA regulatory processes. FLK which is a plant-specific protein
  with 3 KH RNA-binding domains suppresses FLC expression and its paralogue PEP promotes
  FLC expression, but the precise molecular mechanism for both needs to be explored
  further'
