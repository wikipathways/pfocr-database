caption: Examples of the predicted pairs taken from . The chemical transformation
  patterns in pairs (A–C) are already known and described in KEGG reactant pairs (Note
  that these reactions are not known, but the transformation patterns are known),
  whereas pairs (D–I) have unknown patterns. (A) C-C bond accompanied with secondary
  alcohol group is degraded and forms an aldehyde group, which is a reaction typically
  found in EC sub-subclass 4.1.2 (aldehyde-lyases). (B) C-S bond in disulfide bond
  is degraded and forms an S-mercapto group, which is found in EC sub-subclass 4.4.1
  (carbon-sulfur lyases). (C) This chemical transformation pattern is found in many
  reactions in EC 2.4.1 (glycosyltransferases) and EC 3.2.1 (glycosidases). (D) This
  pattern is not found in known reactions. At the first sight, this pair may look
  like two steps of methylation/demethylation (EC 2.1.1) or intramolecular transfer
  of a methyl group (part of EC 5.4). With closer investigations of Isoquinoline alkaloid
  biosynthesis pathway (map00950, which these compounds belong to), it looks more
  natural to occur the two steps of metylenedioxy ring formation/cleavage (EC 1.14.21
  or 1.21.3) because some metylenedioxy ring formation reactions are known to take
  place in this pathway. However, in any case, methylation and metylenedioxy ring
  formation occurs in the context of biosynthesis, whereas demethylation and metylenedioxy
  ring cleavage occurs in the context of biodegradation. In that sense, this compound–compound
  pair may be an example of false positives when taking account of the reaction flow
  in the pathway level. (E) This compound–compound pair may look intramolecular transfer
  of a hydroxy group, which is typically found in EC 5.4.4 (hydroxymutases), but the
  transfer of hydroxy group from a position to another in an aromatic ring is not
  found in any known reactions stored in KEGG. This pair may be another example of
  false positives because the substitution of hydroxy group in aromatic ring is much
  harder to occur than the addition of hydroxy group. It is known that some anaerobic
  bacteria have 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.7.9) that catalyzes the substitution
  of hydroxy group in aromatic ring. However, we assume it would be hard to catalyze
  intramolecular transfer of hydroxy group in substituted aromatic ring. (F) Although
  there are many varieties of hydroxylases (part of EC 1.14), there is no known pattern
  to produce hydroxyl amine from amide group. (G) For this reaction to occur, there
  need to be more than one reaction steps, and an important step would be similar
  to EC 4.1.2 (aldehyde-lyases). (H) There are similar EC 2.3.3 (acyl transferases)
  reactions in polyketide synthesis. (I) Some of EC 1.2.3 (oxidases) catalyze similar
  reactions
