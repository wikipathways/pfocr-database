caption: How do plant-parasitic nematodes alleviate the stress of an apoplast ‘on
  fire’? A model is proposed to explain the DAF-16 and SKN-1 functions that were orchestrated
  within different cellular pathways to resist the release of toxic compounds (reactive
  species and phytoalexins) by the plant cell early in infection. In this model, the
  nematodes sense the physiological state of the plant cell by detecting reactive
  species, and they generate an adapted response. The findings illustrated in this
  figure are based primarily on multi-omic resources from plant-parasitic nematodes
  and functional genomics data from the nematode model system C. elegans. The plant
  defence response activates the oxidative pathway, leading to the release of reactive
  species in the apoplast. At the same time, the plant activates its antioxidant pathway
  to protect the plant cell from oxidative damage. Secondary metabolism is modulated
  to produce phytoalexins, which represent xenobiotics to the nematode cell. Additionally,
  the perception of reactive species leads the nematode cell to activate its oxidative
  stress response. In C. elegans, this pathway is orchestrated by DAF-16 and SKN-1,
  two transcription factors that are conserved in the animal kingdom. DAF-16 and SKN-1
  are negatively regulated by the insulin/IGF-1 signalling (IIS) pathway and positively
  regulated by miR-71. As in the plant cell, the activation of the antioxidant pathways
  has a cytoprotective function. In parallel, ROS-scavenging enzymes can be secreted
  in the apoplast to mitigate the plant’s oxidative burst. The unfolding protein response
  (UPR) adapts cellular homeostasis and protects proteins directly from oxidative
  damage induced by oxidative stress. The detoxification pathway covers the phytoalexins
  produced by the plant cell to suppress their toxicity. GSH, glutathione; CAT, catalase;
