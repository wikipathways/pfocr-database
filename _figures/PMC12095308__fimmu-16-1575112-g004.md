caption: Antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response pathway and known evasion mechanisms
  of orthohantaviruses. Based on data from Hantaan orthohantavirus (HTNV) (127), Puumala
  orthohantavirus (PUUV) (128–131), Tula orthohantavirus (TULV) (128, 129, 131, 132)
  and Andes orthohantavirus (ANDV) (133–136). In infected cells, viral components
  or by-products, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized
  by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), such as melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene 5 helicase (MDA-5), retinoic acid-inducible gene I helicase (RIG-I) or Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs). Receptor-ligand binding activates the type I IFN pathway resulting
  in the activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IkappaB kinase (IKK), which
  causes the phosphorylation and activation of IFN regulatory factors (IRF) 3/IRF7
  and/or NfκB, leading to the expression of different type I IFNs. IFNs are released
  and bind to type I IFN receptors, thereby activating Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) and tyrosine
  kinase 2 (Tyk2). Once activated, the two proteins activate signal transducers and
  activators of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1 and STAT2), which become phosphorylated
  and form a complex with IRF9, subsequently inducing the expression of different
  IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Hantaviruses evolved different immune evasion mechanisms
  to avoid detection by PRRs or interfere with downstream factors of the type I IFN
  pathway. These antagonisms are associated with hantavirus N (127, 133, 135–137),
  Gc/Gn (127, 132, 136) or NSs (128, 129, 131). MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
  protein; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adaptor
  inducing IFN-β; TRAM, TRIF-related adaptor molecule; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor
  receptor associated factor; TRIM, tripartite motif-containing; IFNAR, interferon
  α/β receptor. Created with BioRender.com
