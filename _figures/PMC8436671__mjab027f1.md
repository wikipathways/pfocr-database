caption: The effects of BA-activated TGR5 signaling and BA-inhibited FXR signaling
  in enteroendocrine L cells. L cells produce and secrete important hormones that
  affect energy metabolism and preserve pancreatic β-cell function. (A) In L cells,
  TGR5 is coupled to Gαs G-proteins. HCA species are found to be an agonist for TGR5
  and act to promote the secretion of GLP-1, an incretin that has important effects
  on glucose homeostasis. Gαs protein coupling to BA-activated TGR5 results in the
  recruitment of adenyl cyclase, which subsequently activates cAMP to increase intracellular
  Ca2+ via the protein kinase A (PKA) or guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Epac)
  pathway and ultimately increases the secretion of GLP-1. An assay was performed,
  which detected increased production of cAMP upon treatment with HCA species, thus
  indicating that HCA species were the agonist for TGR5 (). (B) HCA species are shown
  to be the L-cell FXR antagonist by their ability to reverse the inhibition of proglucagon
  transcription that leads to decreased GLP-1 production and secretion and also by
  being able to downregulate the expression of SHP, a downstream target of FXR. CDCA,
  an FXR agonist, gave opposite effects (). ASBT, apical sodium-dependent bile acid
  transporter; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FGF15/19, fibroblast
  growth factor 15/19; RYR, ryanodine receptor.
