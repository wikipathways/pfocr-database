caption: D1 receptor-mediated ERK activation signaling pathway. D1 receptor-mediated
  ERK singling involves interaction with the NMDA glutamtate receptor (see text),
  which is expressed predominantly in the striatum. The stimulation of D1 receptors
  is not able to mediate ERK phosphorylation per se, but rather requires endogenous
  glutamate (). Stimulation of D1 receptors increases calcium influx through NMDA
  receptors, which involves phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit by a
  Src-family tyrosine kinase (). This increased calcium influx activates a number
  of signaling pathways, including calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKII),
  which can activate ERK via the Ras-Raf-MEK cascade (; ; ). Upon D1 receptor activation,
  activated PKA can mediate phosphorylation of DARPP-32 and phosphorylated DARPP-32
  can act as potent inhibitor of the protein phosphatase (PP-1), which dephosphorylates
  another phosphatase, the striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase (STEP). Dephosphorylation
  of STEP activates its phosphatase activity, thus allowing STEP to dephosphorylate
  ERK. DARPP-32 also acts upstream of ERK, possibly by inhibiting PP-1, which prevents
  PP-1 from dephosphorylating MEK, the upstream kinase of ERK. Thus, D1 receptor activation
  increases ERK phosphorylation by preventing its dephosphorylation by STEP, but also
  by preventing the dephosphorylation of the upstream kinase of ERK, indicating that
  D1 receptor-mediated ERK activation involved a complex regulation by phosphatases
  and kinases in addition to the cross talk with glutamate receptor signaling. Phosphorylation
  status is only notified for DARPP32 and STEP in this figure.
