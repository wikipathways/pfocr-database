caption: During a blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, fibrinogen enters the CNS
  and is rapidly converted to fibrin by thrombin., Fibrin then immerses in pleiotropic
  roles of immune system activation by binding to the integrin receptor CD11b/CD18
  of macrophages and microglia, leading to peripheral T-cell recruitment, axonal injury,
  demyelinization, and scar formation.,,, The fibrinolytic pathway (gray shaded) continues
  with the formation of cross-linked fibrin mesh by activated factor XIII (F XIIIa).
  The fibrin mesh is then degraded to soluble D-dimer and other fibrin degradation
  products (FDPs) by plasmin, itself activated by tissue-type plasminogen activator
  (tPA)., Prothrombin and Factor X (F X) are elevated in the plasma of patients with
  MS. In the CNS, they engage in the process modulated by activated Factor X (F Xa)
  of cleaving thrombin from prothrombin. Thrombin then exerts its starter function
  in the fibrinogenic pathway by converting fibrinogen to fibrin. In parallel, Factor
  XII (F XII) drives an adaptive cellular CD87-dependent autoimmune response mediated
  by dendritic cells (APC) and was shown to be elevated in the plasma of patients
  with MS during a relapse. Parts in this figure were edited based on data held under
