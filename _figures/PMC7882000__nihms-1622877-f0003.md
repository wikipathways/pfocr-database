caption: Once cholesterol accumulates in mitochondria of cancer cells it triggers
  a wide range of effects starting with the disruption of mitochondrial membrane fluidity.
  This outcome, in turn, impacts specific membrane carriers (e.g. 2OGC) and impairs
  the transport of GSH into mitochondrial matrix, resulting in increased ROS generation.
  ROS can signal the activation of HIF-1α pathway by inactivating PHDs, which results
  in the HIF-1α stabilization. Iin addition, decreased 2-oxoglutarate levels in cytosol
  may also contribute to PHD inhibition and HIF-1α stabilization. Besides these effects,
  mitochondrial cholesterol-mediated ROS generation can also regulate the assembly
  of respiratory supercomplexes resulting in impaired oxidative phosphorylation that
  often marks the metabolic changes of cancer cells. Through the changes in mitochondrial
  membrane fluidity, cholesterol accumulation in mitochondria has been shown to impair
  MOMP and mitochondrial apoptosis and contributes to chemotherapy resistance.
