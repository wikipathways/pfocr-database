caption: 'Critical signaling pathways regulating TILs infiltration, proliferation,
  and anti-tumor response. There are critical signaling pathways that regulate the
  infiltration, proliferation, and anti-tumor response of TILs including (1) the TGF-β
  signaling pathway, which suppresses TIL infiltration and function, promoting tumor
  immune evasion; (2) the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway which is activated in tumors
  that reduce DC infiltration and impair the migration of antigen-specific CD8+ T
  cells; (3) the NF-κB signaling pathway is shown to promote TILs growth and DC maturation;
  (4) the ferroptosis and apoptosis mechanisms, which regulate TILs survival and population
  vitality; (5) the PI3K-AKT, Hippo, and cGAS-STING signaling pathways are also included
  to illustrate their impacts on TIL immune functions. TRM: tissue-resident memory,
  TFH: follicular helper CD4+ T, BAY1082439: PI3Kα/β/δ inhibitor, GPX4: glutathione
  peroxidase 4; cGAS-STING: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon gene.
  INF-γ: interferon-gamma. → indicates promote while ⊥ indicates inhibit'
