caption: G-protein-coupled receptor subunits Gαs and Gαi interaction with the Ras-Raf
  pathway. When activated by a ligand, the GPCR is induced to exchange its bound GDP
  for GTP, freeing the α subunit to act on the cell. αs acts on adenylyl cyclase (AC)
  to increase the production of the second messenger cAMP from ATP []. In turn, cAMP
  activates Epac-1 [] and protein kinase A []. Epac-1 and C3G, a downstream molecule
  from PKA, are guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for Rap-1 and induce the exchange
  of GDP to GTP to activate it [,]. Both activate Rap-1, which can modulate the activity
  of BRaf []. Protein Kinase A has other mechanisms of action as well. It can directly
  prevent the activation of CRaf through phosphorylation. Both activate Rap-1, which
