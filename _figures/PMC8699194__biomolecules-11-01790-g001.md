caption: Signaling pathways regulating ferroptosis in cancer of the digestive system.
  An increase in human CDO1 activity is expected to decrease cellular cysteine levels,
  which may decrease the synthesis of GSH and promote ferroptosis. TP53 inhibits erastin-stimulated
  ferroptosis in a transcription-independent manner by inhibiting DPP4 in CRC. CISD1
  regulates intracellular iron metabolism to prevent mitochondrial damage during ferroptosis
  and reduce ferroptosis and LP in liver cancer. The activation of the P62-Keap1-NRF2
  pathway protects liver cancer cells from ferroptosis. LOX is used to accelerate
  ferroptosis.
