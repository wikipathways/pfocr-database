caption: CBA returning from the intestines following a meal activates S1PR2. Activation
  of this GPCR then activates nuclear SphK2 via cell signaling pathways increasing
  the levels of S1P in the nucleus. Nuclear S1P inhibits specific histone deacetylases
  (HDACs) causing an increase in acetylation of histones and up-regulation of genes
  encoding nuclear receptors and enzymes involved in nutrient metabolism. This CBA-activated
  nutrient signaling pathway is hypothesized to allow the liver to be more efficient
  in metabolizing a bolus of incoming nutrients allowing the liver to maintain “nutrient
  homeostasis”.
