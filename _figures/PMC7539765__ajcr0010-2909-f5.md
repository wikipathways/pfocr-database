caption: Probable interactions among TRIP13 and other molecules within clear cell
  Renal Cell Carcinoma. Overexpression of TRIP13 activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
  AKT induces proteasome-mediated degradation of MAD2, the key component of SAC. Dysfunctional
  SAC leads to CIN and aneuploidy, which, together with mTOR, mediate cancer progression.
  TRIP13 together with TTC5 as a cofactor, inhibits p53 signaling and, consequently,
  suppresses the apoptosis. In cells with damaged DNA, TRIP13 functions to favor NHEJ
  over HR. NHEJ as more likely to be inaccurate, may contribute to cancer progression.
  TRIP13 also induces the expressions of E-cadherin and vimentin directly or through
  activation of the NOTCH signaling. The net effect is the promotion EMT, which is
  directly associated with gain of migratory and invasive capabilities. TRIP13 reduces
  the expressions of TGF-β1, TβRII and Smad3, the mediators of cellular senescence.
  The inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling supports tumor growth. Decreased Smad3
  activity promotes EMT. SAC-spindle assembly checkpoint; CIN-chromosomal instability;
  NHEJ-non-homologous end joining; HR-homologous recombination; EMT-epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition.
