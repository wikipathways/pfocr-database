caption: MSC Determinants of Immunogenicity, Hemocompatibility and Interaction with
  the Innate Immune Cascade Systems. (A) The safety and efficacy of infused mesenchymal
  stromal cell (MSC) products depends on their hemocompatibility profile and concomitant
  triggering of the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR). In analogy
  to their immunomodulatory features, the cells display a broad array of either regulatory
  elements or immunogenic triggering factors (e.g. cell bound or secreted regulators
  of complement and coagulation cascade and cellular immunity). A tight balance between
  triggering and regulatory elements is decisive for the triggering of IBMIR (incompatibility
  with blood) or prevention thereof (hemocompatibility). While multiple blood regulatory
  elements employed by MSCs prevent blood activation akin to mechanism employed by
  hemocompatible endothelial cells, therapeutic MSC products can also display varying
  levels of immunogenic triggers, such as highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF/CD142),
  cellular stress signals (e.g. cell surface exposure of complement and coagulation
  activating phosphatidylserine resulting from membrane asymmetry upon freeze-thawing),
  and immunogenic antigens (e.g. allo-, xeno-, and blood group antigens). If these
  triggers prevail over the regulatory elements, blood-incompatible MSC products that
  are introduced into the blood stream can trigger the IBMIR, entailing the activation
  of complement, coagulation, and cellular immune responses, which may compromise
  MSC product safety and functionality. (B) Considering the coagulation cascade, regulatory
  elements entail amongst others the secreted tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)
  and surface localized heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) that bind antithrombin
  (AT), which are both strong negative-regulators of the highly procoagulant thrombin
  (activator of fibrin and platelets). Thrombin is formed upon triggering of the clotting
  cascade by activation of the extrinsic tissue factor pathway of coagulation (initiated
  by conversion of factor FVII to FVIIa), or the intrinsic contact activation pathway
  of coagulation (initiated through conversion of FXII to FXIIa, e.g. upon blood exposure
  of highly negatively charged basement membrane contained collagen residues). Both
  arms of the coagulation cascade converge where FX is turned into FXa, that promotes
  the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, which in turn elicits conversion of fibrinogen
  to fibrin, that will form the fibrin clot through cross-linking fibrin fibers, and
  incorporating activated platelets, erythrocytes, and nucleated white blood cells.
  (C) Considering the complement cascade, regulatory elements entail the cell surface
  bound complement regulators CD35, CD46, CD55, CD59 and the secreted complement regulators
  factor H and I (FH/FI), that can regulate the cascade at different steps, as indicated
  in the figure, and may thus prevent formation of the final membrane attack complex
  (MAC) albeit initiation of the earlier steps of complement cascade activation. Activation
  of the complement cascade can occur via the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways
  of coagulation, triggered among others via recognition of aberrant cell surface
  features (e.g. phosphatidylserine exposure upon freeze-thawing) or bound immunoglobulins
  via C1q (classical pathway), which is then transmitted through activation of the
  central complement components 3 and 5 (C3/C5), with concomitant formation of cell
  surface bound opsonins C3b/iC3b/C3dg and soluble chemotactic anaphylatoxins C3a
  and C5a, that can attract and activate various types of nucleated effector cells,
  such as T, NK, B cells and various phagocytes (e.g. PMNs, monocytes, macrophages
  and dendritic cells). (D) Considering the cellular component, as shown in  and ,
  MSC possess very potent immunoregulatory features to modulate adaptive and humoral
  branches of cellular immunity, that may however be compromised or skewed in an unfavorable
  direction if IBMIR-mediated killing of infused cells occurs to rapidly for the cells
  to exert their beneficial effects (e.g. induction of cellular humoral response and
  alloimunization in response to third-party cells). Overall, the triggering of IBMIR
  by infused therapeutic cell products may lead to coagulation, complement, and platelet
  activation, fibrin-cross-linking, and clot formation, with concomitant effector
  cell activation, and consecutive MSC damage and embolization in the microvasculature.
