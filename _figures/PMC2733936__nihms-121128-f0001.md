caption: 'Targeting the ASK1/MKK4/JNK pathway upstream of mitochondrial prodeath signaling.
  Oxidative stress caused by cerebral ischemia results in activation of mitochondrial
  death signaling. Initially activated by oxidative stress, ASK1 signals JNK activation
  via MKK4. Activated JNK triggers prodeath Bcl-2 proteins to disrupt the mitochondrial
  membrane. Subsequent release of downstream mitochondrial death effectors ensues,
  causing DNA damage and ultimate neuronal death. Alternative stresses that act at
  later times after ischemia, such as ER stress and inflammation, can also activate
  ASK1/MKK4/JNK signaling. In addition to the direct signaling consequences, JNK activation
  results in a genomic response, altering the expression of key regulators of neuronal
  death. Inset: Oxidative stress simultaneously causes DNA damage and ASK1 activation.
  DNA damage activates PARP1, leading to NAD depletion and increased ROS. ASK1 results
  in mitochondrial damage and increased ROS. The increase in ROS causes further oxidative
  stress and propagation of the cycle. Cross-talk also occurs as PARP1 activation
  can activate ASK1, and JNK activation can also activate PARP at later times after
  ischemia. Progressive ROS accumulation causes increased JNK activation and damage
  to multiple mitochondria, ensuring neuronal demise. AIF indicates apoptosis-inducing
  factor; Apaf-1, apoptosis-activating factor-1; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase 1; cyt c, cytochrome c; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FasL, Fas ligand; IRE1,
