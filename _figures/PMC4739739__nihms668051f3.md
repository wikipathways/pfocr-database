caption: Connectivity of differentially expressed genes in the important signaling
  pathway following mixed PCBs exposure in human PBMC in vitro depicting the connectivity
  between genes expressed (with ≥1.5 fold change, t-test, p <0.05). Geometric figures
  in red denote up-regulated genes and those are green indicate down-regulation. Genes
  in the top 6 networks (our experimental 100 gene sets) were allowed to grow our
  pathway with the direct/indirect relationship from the IPA knowledge base with the
  stringent filter, experimentally observed, those who were only from human study.
  Solid interconnecting lines show the genes that are directly connected and the dotted
  lines signify the indirect connection between the genes and cellular functions.
  Canonical functions (signaling) that are highly represented are shown within the
  box. Genes in uncolored notes were not identified as differentially expressed in
  our experiment and were integrated into computational generated networks based on
  evidence stored in the IPA knowledge base indicating relevance of this network.
