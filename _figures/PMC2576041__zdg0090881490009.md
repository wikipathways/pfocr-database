caption: Schematic representation of the role of the IGF-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/Akt pathway and atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 in SI-induced atrophy and in the amelioration
  of atrophy by high-load isometric contractions. SI was associated with a decreased
  level of total IRS-1, and increased phosphorylation (p) state for IRS-1 at Ser307,
  leading to a generalized resistance to IGF-I signals. SI had no effect on p level
  or p state of mTOR signaling (p70S6k and 4EBP). The p state of Akt, however, was
  decreased, which may be suggestive of inactivation of its signaling pathway. Akt
  inactivation leads to activation of Foxo action on gene transcription of catabolic
  markers, i.e., atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 (dashed line). SI was associated with increased
  mRNA levels of atrogin-1 and MuRF-1, possibly via activation of the Foxo system.
  Electromechanical stimulation (Stim action) appears to be effective in opposing
  all SI induced alterations. Boldface arrows, activation; boldface blunt bars, inhibition.
