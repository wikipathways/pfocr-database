caption: Thiamine is absorbed in the intestine and transported by high-affinity thiamine
  transporters encoded by the SLC19A2 and SLC19A3 genes inside the cell, where it
  is converted to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) by the cytoplasmic enzyme thiamine
  pyrophosphokinase (TPK1). Whithin the cytosol, TPP acts as a cofactor for transketolake
  (TK), enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway providing reducing equivalents in
  the form of NADPH to sustain fatty acid synthesis and antioxidant defenses (such
  as glutathione peroxide-reductase system) and ribose-5P, essential precursor in
  the biosynthesis of nucleotides. TPP is also transported inside the mitochondria
  by a dedicated transporter, encoded by SLC25A19. Whithin the mitochondria, TPP acts
  as a coenzyme for both PDH, in the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, feeding
  the Krebs cycle, and for α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), a highly regulated
  enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, producing
  NADH and providing electrons for OXPHOS and for branched –chain amino acid dehydrogenase
  (not shown). Defective transport of thiamine inside the cells, due to a mutation
  of SLC19A3.1 will eventually lead to (i) increased oxidative stress, due to both
  decreased synthesis of NADPH (one of the major players involved in the protection
  against ROS toxicity) and defective ETC-dependent increased ROS production; (ii)
  lower OXPHOS, due to lower PDH activity, defective entry to Krebs cycle and decreased
  NADH levels and (iii) lower mitochondrial mass, probably due to increased autophagy/mitophagy
  (activated by increased oxidative stress, not accompanied by increased mitochondrial
  biogenesis) in an effort to clear damaged mitochondria.
