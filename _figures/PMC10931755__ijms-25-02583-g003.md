caption: 'Graphical illustration of mechanistic links between gut microbiota species
  and metabolic pathways with CoronaVac immunogenicity based on our current findings
  and prior literature. Bacteroides uniformis can enhance antigen presentation and
  cytokine release by macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), as well as the proliferation
  of T cells. It can also produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which increase
  energy production in plasma B cells, hence enhancing antibody production. Additionally,
  it is positively correlated with L-histidine degradation I and III pathways, which
  produce L-glutamate, superpathway of adenosine nucleotides de novo biosynthesis
  I and II pathways, which can produce ATP, as well as pathways related to vitamin
  B6 biosynthesis. ATP, via binding to P2X receptors and activating purinergic signalling
  pathways, can stimulate T cells. L-glutamate can enhance T cell functions. Vitamin
  B6 can increase antibody production and boost lymphocyte functioning. Bacteroides
  eggerthii, similar to B. uniformis, can also produce SCFAs for enhancing antibody
  production. Abbreviations: DCs, dendritic cells; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; SCFAs,
  short-chain fatty acids'
