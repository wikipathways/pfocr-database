caption: Metabolism of bicarbonate and t6A37 formation in cytoplasm and mitochondria.
  CO2 produced by TCA cycle is hydrated to form bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrase
  5 (CA5) in mitochondria. In addition, mitochondrial CO2 is exported to cytoplasm
  and hydrated by carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2). In hypoxic conditions, carbonic anhydrase
  9 (CA9) is overexpressed on the cell surface by HIF-1 pathway. CA9 generates large
  amounts of bicarbonate outside the cell. Then, cells actively import extracellular
  bicarbonate to neutralize lactate and prevent acidification. YRDC employs bicarbonate
  to synthesize TC-AMP, which is used for t6A37 formation on tRNAs mediated by KEOPS
  complex in cytoplasm and by OSGEPL1 in mitochondria. Hypomodification of t6A37 in
  two mt-tRNAs in the cells cultured without bicarbonate, as well as from hypoxic
  solid tumors, indicating codon-specific translational regulation by sensing intracellular
  bicarbonate
