caption: De novo purine synthesis is activated by oncogenic alterations including
  PTEN deletions and upregulation or mutations in AKT, mTOR, receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs), and MYC. In the de novo purine synthetic pathway, ribose 5-phosphate (R5P)
  is activated to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), allowing the biochemical construction
  of a purine ring upon the ribose unit to form inosine monophosphate (IMP). IMP can
  be converted to adenylosuccinate (S-AMP) and then adenosine monophosphate (AMP)
  and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). IMP can also be converted to xanthosine monophosphate
  (XMP) via IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and then guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and guanosine
  triphosphate (GTP). In non-malignant brain tissue, purines are produced through
  salvage synthesis, in which free nitrogenous bases are conjugated to PRPP. Increased
  purine levels in HGGs promote stemness, tumor growth, ribosomal biogenesis, and
  DNA repair and subsequent therapeutic resistance. Purine synthesis can be pharmacologically
  targeted using mycophenolate mofetil (MMF/CellCept®), which is converted to mycophenolic
  acid (MPA) in the liver. MPA inhibits IMPDH to suppress purine synthesis and gliomagenesis
  in preclinical models. Figure created with BioRender.
