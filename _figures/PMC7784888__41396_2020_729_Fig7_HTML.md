caption: 'In the proposed pathogenesis model, the insect immune response is marked
  in blue, CHA0 factors emerging from this study in dark green and factors shown to
  be involved in P. protegens CHA0 insecticidal activity in previous studies in pink.
  As described previously by Engel and Moran [], in the event of a pathogen invasion,
  the insect will detect the presence of proteoglycans or other bacterial components
  that will trigger the immune response. The gut epithelium activates the production
  of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) through the DUOX membrane
  oxidases and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) through the IMD pathway. If the signal
  reaches the insect fat body, the Toll pathway will activate the production of AMPs
  as well [, ]. We hypothesize the following infection process: CHA0 is taken up by
  an insect feeding on plant colonized by the bacterium. In the gut, the bacterium
  faces the first line of the insect defense and has to compete with the resident
  microflora. Amidase activity degrading proteoglycan residues from the cell wall
  helps P. protegens CHA0 to avoid recognition by the immune system. The bacterium
  further uses oxidoreductases and the Pap protein to protect itself against reactive
  oxygen and nitrogen species. Nitrogen transporters might capture nitrogenous compounds
  resulting from the interaction of RNS and ROS. In order to better survive this adverse
  and stressful environment, it is possible that P. protegens CHA0 activates transposases
  for genomic rearrangements in order to increase its genomic variability. The bacterial
  cells can resist AMPs thanks to the O-polysaccharide conformation of its surface
  []. CHA0 also produces antimicrobial compounds as shown here and in Flury et al.
  [] and it uses the type VI secretion system (T6SS) to fight the microflora of the
  insect or other ingested bacteria. For breaching the gut epithelium, we propose
  the following scenario: to adhere to the surface of the peritrophic matrix, CHA0
  uses the cyclic lipopeptide surfactant orfamide A []. Then, the chitinase disrupts
  the chitinous peritrophic matrix []. P. protegens CHA0 may use the phospholipase
  PlcN to release nutrients from the mucus layer or to damage the epithelial cells
  [, ] and exopolysaccharides to establish in the epithelium []. Subsequently, the
  production of different two-partner secretion proteins (TPS) triggers host cell
  death and disrupts the cadherin junctions between epithelial cells. This will allow
  the bacteria to transmigrate into the hemocoel. Here CHA0 has to resist phagocytosis
  by granulocytes, encapsulation by plasmatocytes, melanin coating by oenocytoids
  and AMPs produced by the fat body [, ]. To fight the immune cells, CHA0 might use
  the FitD toxin [], hydrogen cyanide (HCN) [], and the TpsA proteins which, in combination
  with the bacterial multiplication, will finally lead to the death of the insect.'
