caption: Top networks associated with lipid metabolism identified in PIEs infected
  with G9P[13]. IPA generates pathways using the most significant entities from the
  experimental data sets and connects to create a comprehensible synopsis of the analysis.
  In the graphical representation of a network, genes/gene products are represented
  as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an
  edge (line). The intensity of the node color indicates the degree of upregulation
  (red) or downregulation (green), and more confidence predicted activation (blue)
  or inhibition (brown) of a given gene. The intensity of the edge color indicates
  the degree of confidence of predicted activation (orange) or inhibition (blue).
  The predicted pathways most affected by G9P[13] infection include the DNA fragmentation
  pathway of apoptosis, implemented by the increased measurement of CIDEB (cell death
  inducing DFFA effector B), inhibition of HOXA7, and increase of PBX3 (pre-B cell
  leukemia transcription factor 3) measurement. Additionally, the NF-kB (NF-KappaB)
  pathway is impacted here through the decreased prediction of DDX20 (DEAD-box helicase
  20), suggesting a role to inhibit NF-kB activity and the activation of B cells [42].
  Finally, the glycosphingolipid metabolic pathway is predicted to have high activation
  with impact from B3GALT2
