caption: 'Red blood cell (RBC) metabolic regulation. (A) Glucose metabolism in RBCs
  proceeds through the Embden–Meyerhof pathway (EMP, orange arrows) and the hexose
  monophosphate pathway (HMP, green arrows). Both share glucose 6-phosphate (G6P)
  as their initial substrate. The HMP is the sole source of NADPH in RBCs and generates
  fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), which rejoin the
  EMP prior to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD/GAPDH), a key regulatory
  point. The EMP generates NADH (utilized by metHb reductase), as well as ATP (to
  drive ion pumps) and 2,3-DPG (which modulates hemoglobin p50). Hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2) and superoxide radical anion (O2.−), the principal reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) generated/encountered by RBCs, are produced naturally by RBCs in the course
  of HbO2 cycling, are generated in storage, and are likely encountered in the circulation
  following transfusion. Extra-erythrocytic O2.− enters RBCs through Band3 (anion
  exchange protein 1, or AE-1), while H2O2 can directly cross the membrane. These
  ROS are ultimately reduced/disproportionated to water by the RBCs antioxidantmachinery.
  (B) RBC O2 content regulates relative glucose flux via the EMP/HMP. A reciprocal
  binding relationship exists between deoxy-Hb and key EMP enzymes (PFK, Aldo, G3PD/GAPDH,
  PK, and LDH) for the cytoplasmic domain of Band3 (cdB3). In oxygenated RBCs (at
  right), sequestration to cdB3 inactivates the EMP enzymes, resulting in HMP dominance
  and maximal NADPH generation. In deoxygenated RBCs (at left), deoxy-Hb binding to
  cdB3 disperses the EMP enzymes, activating the EMP and allowing G6P substrate competition
  – thereby constraining HMP flux and NADPH recycling. Abbreviations: CAT, catalase;
