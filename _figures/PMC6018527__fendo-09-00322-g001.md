caption: Schematics of Sema4D/Plexin-B1 signaling. (A) In the absence of Sema4D, the
  cytoplasmic tail of Plexin-B1 is in an inactive conformation. R-Ras is in a GTP-bound
  state to collaborate with integrin and control cellular adhesion to the extracellular
  matrix (ECM). With Plexin-B1 in an inactive state, Rac activates p21-activated kinase
  (PAK) to trigger LIMK1 signaling and downstream phosphorylation of cofilin, which
  results in increased actin polymerization and microtubule assembly. (B) Sema4D binding
  to Plexin-B1 alters the Plexin-B1 conformation, recruits Rac1 to the complex, and
  inhibits activation of the PAK–LIMK1–cofilin signaling cascade. In addition, R-Ras
  recruitment to the Sema4D/Plexin-B1 complex inhibits its ability to regulate integrin-mediated
  activation, resulting in increased cell motility. Deactivation of R-Ras further
  decreases PI3K-Akt GSK3β pathway, which leads to deactivation of CRMP-2 and subsequent
  microtubule disassembly. In an ErbB2-dependent signaling step, PLCγ1/2 is recruited
  to Plexin-B1 via its SH2 domain. Structural interaction of the PLCγ1/2 SH3 domain
  triggers PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG complex, resulting in RhoA activation. Active GTP-RhoA
  acts on Raf and Rho-associated kinases (ROCK1/2), which in turn stimulate PYK2 to
  induce cell invasiveness and migration. (C) Sema4D-Plexin-B1 signaling inhibits
  osteoblast differentiation. Plexin-B1/ErbB2-dependent RhoA activation stimulates
  activation of downstream kinase ROCK, which phosphorylates the insulin receptor
  substrate 1 (IRS1). This causes suppression of insulin like growth factor (IGF1)-dependent
  signaling and blocks osteoblast differentiation.
