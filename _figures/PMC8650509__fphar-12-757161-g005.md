caption: Alpha-synuclein and microglial Nox2 activation. The activation of microglia
  by alpha-synuclein can implicate several cell-surface receptors, such as P2X7, TLR2/4,
  and CR3, and subsequent activation of several kinases, such as PKC, Akt, MAPKs,
  PAK, and ERK1/2. This in turn could promote the phosphorylation and translocation
  of p47phox and subsequent Nox2 activation. Released oxygen species appear to promote
  microglia chemoattraction, activation, and OS. Neuronal damage leads to the release
  of alpha-synuclein and the TLR-agonist high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1).
