caption: Overview of the VarA/S-CsrB/C/D-CsrA pathway. Dashed arrows indicate that
  the exact mechanism of regulation is currently unknown. We show here that CsrA positively
  regulates the level of ToxR protein in response to amino acids. Var/Csr-mediated
  regulation of biofilm and virulence gene expression via the quorum sensing pathway
  is described by Lenz et al. (). The regulation of omp gene expression by ToxR is
  well established (, , ).
