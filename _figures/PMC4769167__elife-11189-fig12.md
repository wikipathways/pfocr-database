caption: '(A) CLC transporter cycle. The OFoccluded state (1) undergoes a conformational
  change to OFopen (2). This step is pH-dependent but may be promoted by protonation
  of residues other than Gluex (see Discussion). Two Cl- ions leave (3) and then entry
  of the protonated Gluex into the permeation pathway (4) facilitates H+-transfer
  to the inside (via Gluin, ) (5). Conformational change to the inward-facing state
  (6) allows 2 Cl- ions to enter from the intracellular side, knocking Gluex out of
  the pathway (7). The cycle is reversible, with protonation favoring conformational
  change to the OFopen state. (B) Channel-like CLC states. The crystal structure of
  channel-like ClC-ec1 reveals a narrow constriction at the extracellular-gate region,
  depicted at left. However, results here demonstrate that the major conformation
  adopted in solution more closely resembles the OFopen state (equilibrium shifted
  to right). This finding is consistent with the high Cl- throughput observed in channel-like
