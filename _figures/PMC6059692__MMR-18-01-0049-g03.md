caption: Predicted regulatory networks affected by sinomenine treatment via Ingenuity®Pathway
  Analysis. The predicted upstream regulators were TGF-β1, AHR and CST5, and the target
  molecules of these upstream regulators were also shown. The solid lines represented
  a direct interaction between two proteins, whereas the dotted lines represent an
  indirect association. The length of the lines reflects the strength of reported
  evidence supporting the node-to-node relationship. AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor;
  CST5, cystatin D; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor β1.
