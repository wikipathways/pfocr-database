caption: Catecholamines (dopamine, NE, and EPI) are produced in chromaffin cells through
  a common synthetic pathway (left), beginning with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) regulating
  the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine, the rate-limiting step. Dihydroxyphenylalanine
  is converted to dopamine, which is converted to NE; phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase
  (PNMT) converts NE to EPI. Common foods and medications interfere with 3 mechanisms
  in catecholamine synthesis and turnover that are relevant to triggering and worsening
  of tachyarrhythmias. First, synthesized NE and EPI sequestered into storage vesicles
  can be displaced by prescribed drugs (e.g., sympathomimetics) and tyramine found
  in fermented, aged, and smoked foods (cheese, wine, beer, soy sauce, avocado, banana,
  and so on). Second, reuptake inhibitors (serotonin and/or NE-related antidepressants)
  block catecholamine reuptake. Third, following reuptake, NE and EPI are deactivated
  by monoamine oxidase and are eventually metabolized to dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG).
  Monoamine oxidase is inhibited by monoamine oxidase inhibitors, including oxazolidinedione
  antibiotics (linezolid). Additional agents also contribute to catecholamine excess
  by alternative, multiple, or less-well-known mechanisms and are not shown. These
  agents include opiates, peptide hormones (vasopressin, glucagon, steroids), neuromuscular
  blockers, anesthetics, and antiemetics (notably metoclopramide). Ultimately, catecholamines
  enter the circulation and act upon the heart and vasculature via adrenoceptors (right).
  Glucocorticoids and thyroid hormones either increase the number of adrenoceptors
  or their affinity to catecholamines. AV = atrioventricular; SA = sinoatrial; other
  abbreviations as in .
