caption: Tumor suppressor p53 and its signaling pathway. A wide variety of intracellular
  and extracellular stress signals are detected by the cell and communicated to the
  p53 protein by numerous mediators (shown are representative mediators). Stress signals
  result in the degradation of the MDM2 protein and the increase in the levels and
  activity of the p53 protein. Depending on the cell type, environmental context and
  the type and/or degree of stress, activated p53 selectively transcribes a group
  of its target genes (shown are representative genes) and initiates various cellular
  responses to exert its function in tumor suppression.
