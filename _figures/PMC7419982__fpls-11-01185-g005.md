caption: Regulation of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ion homeostasis by SOS pathway.
  High Na+ ions induce osmotic and ionic stress in cells. This leads to increase in
  levels of cytosolic Ca2+, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increase
  in Inositol phosphates. Perturbations in Ca2+ levels is sensed by calcium binding
  proteins such as SOS3 and ScaBP6 that activate the protein kinase SOS2 thus initiating
  a phosphorylation cascade. This leads to activation of the plasma membrane localized
  Na+/H+ exchanger SOS1 (that effluxes Na+ from the cytoplasm) and the NHX exchanger
  on the vacuoles (that accumulate Na+ in the vacuole) thus leading to maintenance
  of ion homeostasis in cells. Salt stress response is also linked to hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2) signaling as SOS2 directly interacts with CATALASE (CAT2 and CAT3), while
  its interaction with Ethylene Insensitive 3 (EIN3) links SOS pathway to ethylene
  signaling processes (; ). ROS and stress responsive changes in gene expression may
  also lead to biosynthesis of phytohormones such as ABA that can amplify the stress
  signal by activating ABA-dependent transcription factors that lead to expression
  of stress-responsive genes.
