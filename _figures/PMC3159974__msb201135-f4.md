caption: Predicted synthetic lethal gene pairs in TCA cycle (A), phosphatidylserine
  biosynthesis (B) and pentose-phosphate pathway (C). Red arrows represent predicted
  synthetic lethality. In (A) SDH undergoes loss of heterozygosity resulting in a
  complete loss-of-function in paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas; in (B) PTDSS2,
  CEPT1 and PCYT2 undergo chromosomal deletions in testicular cancer (PTDSS2), pheochromocytoma
  (CEPT1) and renal cell carcinoma (PCYT2); in (C) RPE undergo chromosomal deletions
  in several cancer types, including adrenocortical carcinoma and head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma. In all cases, the targeting of the corresponding synthetic lethal
  partner is expected to selectively affect proliferation of the cancer cells.
