caption: The crosstalk between PAK1 and other cancer-related pathways. PAK1 can also
  regulate the proliferation and cytoskeletal movement of cancer cells via crosstalk
  with the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway and the TGF-β signaling pathway. In addition,
  PAK1 can promote tumorigenesis and angiogenesis through Notch and STAT5 signaling
  pathways activation.
