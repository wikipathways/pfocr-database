caption: SARS-CoV ORF3a and the immune response. Following SARS-CoV infection of ACE2
  expressing cells, ORF3a is expressed in the ER induces the PERK ER stress pathway
  resulting in the serine phosphorylation of IFNAR and attenuation of the IFN-α JAK/STAT
  signalling pathway and downstream ISG induction. ORF3a has been shown to co-localise
  with RIP3 in lysosomes and RIP3 has been shown to promote ORF3a oligomerisation
  leading to the activation of TFEB and subsequent pro-IL-1β, IL-2 and IL-27 induction.
  ORF3a has also been shown to interact with TRAF3 triggering downstream NF-κB activation
  and induction of pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and IL-8. ORF3a has also been shown to promote
  inflammasome activation, through interaction with TRAF3 and via potassium efflux,
  leading to cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. The release of IL-8, mature IL-1β
  and IL-18 from SARS-CoV promotes inflammation, contributing to the immunopathology
  associated with SARS-CoV infection.
