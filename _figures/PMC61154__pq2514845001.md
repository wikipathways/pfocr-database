caption: The branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. (Upper) Leucine is deaminated
  and then converted to a branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA primer by BCKAD, the product
  of the esg locus. The primer is extended in multiples of two carbons during fatty-acid
  biosynthesis to generate the iso-odd fatty acid family. A bypass pathway exists
  by which isovalerate is converted to the acyl-CoA derivative by another enzyme.
  Lower shows that the nature of the amino acid or bypass primer determines the fatty
  acid family that is produced. The esg mutation inhibits the synthesis of all three
  fatty acid families. A bypass primer exists for each of the three families.
