caption: 'Among the many PARPi resistance mechanisms, the PARP-1/Akt interaction in
  oxidative stress could explain the potential efficacy of PARPi + AKT-inhibitor combinations.
  (a) Regularly, the nuclear PARP-1 enzyme is activated by oxidative stress causing
  DNA strand breaks. The excessive PARP-1 activity depletes the substrate NAD+, thus
  exhausting ATP stocks and restraining ATM-NEMO complexes in nucleoplasm. Consequently,
  the oxidative stress is able to injure mitochondria, without the ATM-NEMO induced
  activation of Akt, leading to cell apoptosis. (b) In the presence of PARP inhibition,
  nuclear NAD+ and ATP stocks’ depletion is avoided, due to the blocked PARP-1 activity.
  This PARP inhibition lets activated ATM-NEMO complex to translocate to the cytosol,
  assembling the ATM-NEMO-Akt-mTOR cytoprotective signalosome in the outer membrane
  of mitochondria. The mitochondrial oxidative damage may be prevented due to the
  above-mentioned mechanism, allowing cell survival. Therefore, the inhibition of
  the Akt pathway may prevent this kind of PARPi resistance []. In the figure: pointed
  arrows represent activation pathways; arrows with flat ends represent inhibition
  pathways. Abbreviations: ROS = reactive oxygen species; P = phosphorylated; NAD+
  = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; ATP = adenosine triphosphate.'
