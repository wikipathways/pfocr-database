caption: Effects of repeated morphine treatment on glial and neuronal signaling in
  the PAG. Chronic morphine treatment induces several side effects that block opioid-induced
  decreases in GABAergic interneuron activity at the neuronal level, postsynaptically.
  This includes the uncoupling of MOPr from G-protein mediated effects on GIRK channels
  and AC. This results in an upregulation of cAMP. Uncoupling also occurs in the presynaptic
  region, blocking the Gβγ mediated inhibition of calcium channels and PLA mediated
  activation of Kv channels. In this state, binding of opioids to MOPr no longer results
  in suppression of GABA release. At the level of glial signaling, upon repeated treatment
  with morphine, there is a rapid upregulation of TLR4 on astrocytes and microglia
  within the PAG, resulting in an increase in excitatory cytokine release, as well
  as a switch from Gi/o to Gs coupling at MOPr, resulting in an overall increase in
  excitatory tone that is correlated with opioid tolerance.
