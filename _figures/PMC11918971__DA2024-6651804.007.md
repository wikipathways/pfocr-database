caption: (A) Aerobic exercise (AE) stimulates the synthesis of anti-inflammatory “muscle
  factors” such as IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra through skeletal muscle contraction while
  reducing the activity of proinflammatory factors such as TNF-α. (B) BDNF binds to
  the receptor Trk-B and activates the PI3K and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, affecting
  neurogenesis and synaptic transmission. BDNF interacts with IGF-1 and VEGF, both
  of which can stimulate the growth of endothelial cells and express NO synthase.
  Exercise is associated with the increase of peripheral IGF-1 levels. IGF-1 crosses
  the BBB, enhances synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, and increases BDNF
  concentrations. (C) AE enhances neuroplasticity and neurogenesis by improving brain
  cognition, increasing hippocampal volume and synaptogenesis. (D) Exercise regulates
  intestinal flora, improves HPA axis function, reduces psychological disorders, promotes
  neurogenesis, and increases cortisol concentration but quickly returns to normal
  after exercise and benefits the health of the hypothalamic axis. BBB, blood–brain
  barrier; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor
