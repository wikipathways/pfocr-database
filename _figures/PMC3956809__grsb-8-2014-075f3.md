caption: 'Tissue-specific regulation represented by putative functional regulatory
  networks (top: liver; bottom: muscle). Each node represents a gene battery which
  is a set of coexpressed genes sharing a common function (pathway). Edges characterize
  the regulatory closeness between two gene batteries if the ratio of sharing common
  transcriptional regulators is greater than 0.8; ‘red’ edges express high regulatory
  closeness that occurs in both liver and muscle. Although these gene batteries are
  involved in similar functions under chronic corticosteroid administration, their
  expression patterns and transcriptional regulatory relationships are specific in
  liver vs. in muscle.'
