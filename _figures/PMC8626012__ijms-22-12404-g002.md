caption: 'Genomic and non-genomic pathways of estrogen receptors (ERs). ERs can act
  through genomic pathways and nongenomic pathways. The nongenomic pathways may also
  result in the transcriptional activation of genes. (1) Classic pathway: dimerization
  of ERs triggered by the binding of E2, followed by nuclear translocation to regulate
  the transcriptional activity of genes bearing the estrogen response element (ERE).
  (2) ER activity independent of ERE: the recognition of promoters result from the
  protein−protein interaction of ERs with other transcription factors (TF). (3) Ligand-independent
  activity: the binding of growth factors to membrane receptors triggers protein kinase
  cascades that activate ERs by phosphorylation, promoting their nuclear translocation
  and recognition of the ERE in target genes. (4) Nongenomic pathway: the binding
  of the ligand causes mER and GPER1 to initiate signaling pathways, which promote
  the activation of enzymes and transcriptional factors that can regulate the transcription
  of diverse genes. ER, estrogen receptors; mER, membrane estrogen receptors; TF,
  transcription factor; ERE, estrogen response element; non-ERE, other transcription
  factors distinct from ERE; P, phosphorylated receptor; G, G protein-coupled receptor;
  GPER, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor; cav, caveolin.'
