caption: TDP-43 induces mtDNA leakage in ALS neuronal cells. A large amount of TDP-43
  protein is present in the neuronal cells of patients with ALS, which causes mtDNA
  release into the cytoplasm through the mPTP pathway. mtDNA leakage in turn activates
  the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and induces the production of inflammatory factors.
