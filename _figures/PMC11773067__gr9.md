caption: 'Proposed metabolic pathway of homocarnitine acylation. The present research
  shows that homocarnitine is acylated to form palmitoyl-homocarnitine, with pharmacologic
  evidence that this is catalyzed by carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT1). CPT1
  is an enzyme that exists in different tissue-specific forms and catalyzes fatty
  acyl-carnitine formation from acyl-CoA’s and carnitine (4, 82). Carnitine-acylcarnitine
  translocase (CACT) (83, 84) transports free and acylated-carnitines into the mitochondrial
  matrix where CPT2 (50) replaces the carnitine on a fatty acyl chain with a CoA to
  prepare for β-oxidation. Similarly, the present research shows existence of acetyl-homocarnitine
  likely indicating that homocarnitine and/or palmitoyl-homocarnitine can enter the
  mitochondria via CACT. The final product of β-oxidation is acetyl-CoA which can
  be converted to acetyl-carnitine or acetyl-homocarnitine by carnitine acetyltransferase
  (CAT or CrAT) (52). Created with BioRender.com. OM, outer mitochondrial membrane;
