caption: Model of pigment-type switching controlled by dual signaling from MC1R. ASIP,
  agouti-signaling protein (agouti protein); A-YY (ASIP-YY), a synthetic C-terminal
  fragment of agouti protein; Mc, melanocyte; Mb, melanoblast; Ub, ubiquitinylation.
  Melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is shown with some basal activity (left). MC1R can
  activate both cAMP and another signaling pathway X. Activation of X may be cAMP-dependent
  or -independent. Agouti protein can antagonize cAMP signaling through its C-terminus
  (or as ASIP-YY) and can independently antagonize X signaling through its N-terminus
  and through ATRN and MGRN1, resulting in inhibition of eumelanogenesis and enhancement
  of pheomelanogenesis. To explain the activation of eumelanogenesis by cAMP, yet
  persistence of eumelanogenesis when the cAMP signal is withdrawn, a positive feedback
  loop was suggested. MGRN1 may break the loop by ubiquitinating and destabilizing
  one component Y. This would lead to a less differentiated state with low MITF activity,
  permissive for pheomelanogenesis. Reproduced from reference [].
