caption: Rearranged in transfection (RET) receptor structure and its intracellular
  signaling pathway. The extracellular domain of RET contains four cadherin-like repeats
  and a cysteine-rich domain. Ca2+ ions bind to the extracellular cadherin-like domains
  of RET, which is required for its activation. The intracellular domain of RET contains
  a typical kinase domain. RET has three isoforms (RET9, RET43, and RET51), which
  differ in their carboxy-terminal amino acids. RET9 and RET51 are evolutionarily
  highly conserved. RET is phosphorylated at multiple tyrosine residues when activated
  by different ligands. Phosphorylated tyrosine residues serve as docking sites for
  various adaptor proteins that induce the activation of downstream signaling pathways
  essential for cell growth, proliferation, survival, differentiation, or appetite
  control. The black line indicates the binding of adapter protein and the activation
  of downstream signaling pathways. The red line indicates mutations in the RET region
  that are responsible for diseases such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes
  2A and 2B and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR).
