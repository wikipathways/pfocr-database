caption: Diagram of the P. infestans infection cycle and the many roles effectors
  play in modulating plant cellular processes. The main dispersal stage is the multinucleate
  sporangium (S) which either germinates directly or releases zoospores (Z). Zoospores
  rapidly encyst (C) on a host plant then germinate to form an appressorium-like (A)
  swelling at the end of the germ tube, under which penetration takes place to form
  the infection vesicle (IV). From this intercellular hyphae extend and grow between
  host cells, projecting haustoria (H) into cells. The haustoria are the sites of
  secretion of the RXLR class of effectors (shown in red) and some of their characterised
  protein targets and activities are represented in this diagram. Several effectors
  are attuned to suppress signal transduction pathways emanating from membrane-bound,
  BRASSINOSTEROID-ASSOCIATED KINASES 1 (BAK1)-dependent receptors such as FLAGELLIN-SENSING
  2 (FLS2), and can act redundantly. Some effectors act to inhibit specific immune
  response factors and pathways, while others promote the activity of negative regulators
  which can thus be regarded as susceptibility factors (S factors). Several effectors
  target diverse nuclear-located processes while others target processes involving
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), vesicles in the secretory pathway, the plasma membrane,
  or autophagosomes.
