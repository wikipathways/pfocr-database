caption: ACE and ACE2 in the pulmonary system and the tentative role of SARS-CoV-2The
  top right part of the figure shows the activation of the Spike (S)-protein of SARS-CoV-2
  by predominantly TMPRSS2 and also other host proteases such as trypsin and furin.
  The activated S-protein aids the virus to enter the host cells, mainly pulmonary
  epithelial cells, after it has bound to its cellular receptor- ACE2. SARS-CoV-2
  on internalization into the host cells may bring about a downregulation of ACE2
  expression, similar to SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses.The middle and top
  left part of the figure demonstrate the natural pathophysiologic role of the interdependent
  ACE and ACE2 pathways in the pulmonary system, including the vasculature and cytokine
  response. Normally, ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II which exerts effects
  through both AT1 and AT2 receptors. In various disease states, the AT1 receptor
  pathway (Gq-receptor mediated) is the dominant pathway (bold black arrow) which
  brings about vasoconstriction, increase in alveolar capillary permeability and multiple
  other deleterious pulmonary effects (blue box). The AT1 receptor also stimulates
  leukotrienes and prostaglandins which increase alveolar capillary permeability.
  It also stimulates NOX (NADPH oxidase) in the endothelial cells, phagocytes and
  vascular smooth muscle cells which results in an increase in deleterious free radicals
  and an inflammatory cytokine storm (top left part of figure). A minor role is played
  by the protective AT2-receptor mediated pathway which in association with bradykinin,
  brings about an increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase and causes vasodilatation.
  Angiotensin II is also converted to Angiotensin III by APA (aminopeptidase A) which
  is the predominant molecule acting on the AT2 receptor.ACE2 normally plays a protective
  role in pulmonary pathophysiology by converting Ang I to Ang (1–9) and Ang II to
  Ang (1–7). Ang (1–9) is also converted to Ang (1–7) by ACE. Ang (1–7) acts through
  the Mas-receptor (Gs) pathway and results in an increase in endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase (eNOS) and a decrease in MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), resulting
  in protective vasodilatation. The Mas-receptor also has an inhibitory effect on
  the deleterious effects of Ang II on the pulmonary system (bluebox). Ang (1–7) also
  acts through the Alamandine- MrgD-TGR7 (Gs)- pathway which increases cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP) in endothelial cells, resulting in protective vasodilatation.
  Ang (1–7) participates in cross-talk with AT2 receptor (dashed arrow), and is also
  inactivated by ACE. The balance between the ACE and ACE2 mediated actions determines
  the end result in disease states. SARS-CoV-2, by presumptively downregulating ACE2,
  may shift the balance towards the deleterious effects of the ACE pathway. On the
  other hand, it may be hypothesized that several drugs which act as direct and indirect
  activators of ACE2, may favourably shift the balance towards the Mas-receptor and
  Alamandine mediated protective pathways.
