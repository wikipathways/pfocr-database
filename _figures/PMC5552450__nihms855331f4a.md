caption: (a) Following exclusive use of the glycolytic pathway, the M2-labeled pattern
  retains until fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The aldolase-catalyzed cleavage reaction
  produces M2-labeled dihydroxyacetone (DHAP) and unlabeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (GAP). The labeling pattern is eventually inherited by pyruvate, yielding an equimolar
  mixture of M2-labeled and unlabeled pyruvate. (b) This labeling pattern can be best
  explained by analyzing three molecules of 1,2-13C2-glucose going through the oxidative
  PPP. The first step in glycolysis transforms all 1,2-13C2-glucose into M2-labeled
  glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). The oxidative PPP releases one molecule of heavy labeled
  carbon dioxide per molecule of 1,2-13C2 G6P. The resulting three molecules of M1-labeled
  ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) have equal chances of going through three distinct biochemical
  reactions. The transketolation and transaldolation reactions lead to one molecule
  of M2-labeled fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), one molecule of M1-labeled F6P, and one
  molecule of unlabeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP). These metabolite intermediates
  are then diverted back to the glycolytic pathway. One molecule of M2-labeled G6P
  generates equimolar mixture of M2-labeled and unlabeled pyruvate. Similarly, one
  molecule of M1-labeled G6P generates an equimolar mixture of M1-labeled and unlabeled
  pyruvate. The unlabeled GAP molecule yields one molecule of unlabeled pyruvate.
  Therefore, theoretically, if all 1,2-13C2-glucose goes through the oxidative PPP
  exclusively, there would be 20% of M2-labeled pyruvate, 20% of M1-labeled pyruvate
  and 60% of unlabeled pyruvate.
