  a pro-inflammatory state, with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1,
  IL-6 and TNFα) and decreased antioxidant enzymes (glutathione, SOD and catalase).

  production of ROS and RNS, driven by increased activity of the NF-kB signaling pathway.
  NF-kB signaling stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis via the upregulation of PGC-1α,
  Nrf-2, and TFAM. PGC-1α and Nrf-2 stimulate mitochondrial respiration, which is
  a further source of oxidative stress via ROS and RNS production. Increased oxidative
  stress could induce an increase in the levels of cytosolic Ca2+ ions seen in mania
  compared to other phases of the disease. Elevated Ca2+ levels can stimulate oxidative
  phosphorylation and ATP production and may lead to the activation of AMPK and SIRT1,
  which may increase the activity of NAD+. In an environment of increasing oxidative
  stress, the activity of SIRT1, AMPK, PKC PI3/K are increased. This can foster mitochondrial
  survival leading to cytotoxicity and cell death via activation of proapoptotic pathway
  cascades (Bcl-2, Akt and mTor among others). Increased uric acid levels increase
  the uptake of Ca2+ ions by mitochondria, increase the mitochondrial membrane potential
  and therefore enhance ATP production. Antimanic drugs including mood stabilizers
  and antipsychotics may restore mitochondrial dysregulation by counteracting the
  mitochondrial imbalance leading to neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, and cell survival.
