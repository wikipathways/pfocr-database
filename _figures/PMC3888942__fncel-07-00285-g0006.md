caption: Axon navigation pathway targeting by miRNAs that differentially associate
  with Ago2 in an activity-dependent manner. Genes targeted by miRNAs that differentially
  associate with Ago2 in an activity-dependent manner are color coded by whether they
  are targeted by enhanced (green box), depleted (red box), or by both enhanced and
  depleted miRNAs (brown box). The involvement of all four guidance molecule families
  and their convergence on signal transduction systems classically associated with
  activity-dependent synaptic plasticity suggests an important role for these receptor
  mediated signaling pathways in plasticity.
