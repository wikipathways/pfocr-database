caption: Network of differentially expressed genes in the cell cycle control pathway
  in sorted R1/R2 Eklf−/− E13.5 fetal liver cells. IPA was performed on microarray
  data comparing R1 and R2 mRNA isolated from wild-type and Eklf−/− E13.5 fetal liver
  cells. Using 3,199 differentially expressed genes as the focus gene set, the highest-scoring
  pathway was cell cycle and DNA replication (score = 27; scores >3 indicate a significant
  chance that a biologically relevant network has been identified). Red nodes indicate
  upregulation in Eklf−/− cells; green nodes indicate downregulation in Eklf−/− cells.
  Arrows and lines denote interactions between specific genes within the network.
  A, activation; E, expression regulation; P, phosphorylation; PP, protein-protein
  interaction; PD, protein-DNA interaction; PR, protein-RNA interaction; RB, regulation
  of binding; L, proteolysis.
