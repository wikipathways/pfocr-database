caption: 'Canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways of AhR. The upper part of
  the figure is a canonical AhR signal pathway. Prior to AhR activation, AhR is inactive
  as part of a protein complex that consists of two molecules of HSP90, XAP2, p23
  and the protein kinase SRC in the cytoplasm. Once a ligand binds to AhR, the molecule
  undergoes a conformational change to expose its N-terminal nuclear localization
  sequence, facilitating translocation of the liganded AhR protein complex into the
  nucleus. In the nucleus, AhR binds to ARNT through its PAS domain, forming a ligand-bound
  AhR-ARNT dimer. The dimer gets recruited to a DNA-specific sequence located within
  the promoters of target genes, to promote transcription of a wide variety of genes,
  such as Cyp1A1, CyP1B1, AhRR, and COX-2. AhR activity is strictly controlled by
  three different negative feedback loops, including: (i) degradation of AhR by proteasome,
  (ii) clearance of ligand by metabolic pathway, (iii) destruction of AhR/ARNT complex
  by AhRR. The lower part of figure shows the non-canonical AhR signaling: (i) AhR
  can also interact with NF-κB, Nrf2, PD-L1 and STAT proteins or other transcription
  factors to bind their specific binding sites and consequently modulate the activity
  and expression of their target genes. (ii) AhR functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase
  to regulate the half-life of other transcription factors. (iii) AhR activation triggers
  phosphorylation cascades driven by SRC kinase when it releases from the AhR chaperone
  complex. AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; AhRR, AhR repressor; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon
