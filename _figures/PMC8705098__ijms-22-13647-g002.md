caption: 'The complement system consists of more than 40 soluble or membrane-bound
  proteins, and is activated via classical, lectin or alternative pathway. The classical
  pathway is activated by Aβ andp-tau. Apoptotic cells and antigen-antibody complexes
  interact with C1q (complexed with C1r2 and C1s2). C1s then cleaves C4 and C2 and
  ultimately leading to the formation of C3 convertase C4b2b. The lectin pathway is
  activated by mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolin, which then recruits MASPs
  (MBL-associated serine proteases) to cleave C2 and C4, yielding C3 convertase, C4b2b.
  The alternative pathway is an amplification loop and is also initiated by hydrolysis
  of C3 to C3(H2O) which leads to the formation of C3 convertase, C3bBb. All three
  pathways lead to formation of C5 convertase (classical and lectin: C4b2b3b; alternative:
  C3bBb3b) generating C5b which binds to C6, C7, C8, and C9 to form a cell lysing
  membrane attack complex (MAC). Some of the mechanisms of complement activation in
  AD are shown in the blue boxes.'
