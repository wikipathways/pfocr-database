caption: 'Gene interaction sub-network of shortest connections to common targets for
  the 36 candidate regulatory genes obtained by global literature analysis (Pathway
  Studio 7.0, Ariadne Genomics Inc., Rockville MD). Only 12 connected genes from the
  list of 36 are shown, the rest are not connected and not shown. Node shapes code:
  oval and circle – protein; crescent – protein kinase and kinase; diamond – ligand;
  irregular polygon – phosphatase; circle/oval on tripod platform – transcription
  factor; ice cream cone – receptor. Red color represents up-regulated genes, blue
  color – down-regulated genes, grey – common targets which are not in the input list;
  arrows with plus sign show positive regulation/activation, arrows with minus sign
  – negative regulation/inhibition.'
