caption: Proposed model of RAPGEF involvement in sperm motility. We propose that RAPGEFs
  act to initiate basal motility cascade through the PDPK1-AKT1-GSK3 pathway of protein
  kinases. After sperm are released from the seminiferous tubules, they are immotile
  but are carried by fluid flow into the epididymis, eventually accumulating in the
  cauda epididymis. Here they encounter ATPe secreted by the cauda epididymal epithelium.
  ATPe, acting through purinergic receptors, causes a calcium influx that stimulates
  adenylyl cyclase ADCY10. The resulting cAMP causes a cascade of events, leading
  to the eventual acquisition of basal motility.
