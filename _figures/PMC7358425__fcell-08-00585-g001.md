caption: Mechanism for the development of COPD driven by oxidative stress. Exogenous
  oxidants from the environment and endogenous oxidants (released by activated neutrophils,
  alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells) lead to the production of reactive oxygen
  species and cause lung tissue damage. It mainly includes lipid peroxidation, Protein
  damage, DNA damage and Altering signal pathway. (A) Lipid peroxidation results in
  the hydrolysis of phospholipids in the cell membrane and changes in the structure
  and permeability of the cell membrane. Arachidonic acid produced by hydrolysis of
  phosphoric acid molecules, its metabolites thromboxane, prostaglandin E and leukotriene
  C4 are involved in the inflammatory process. (B) The inactivation of α1-AT breaks
  the balance between protease and anti-protease, which do great damage to elastin
  and eventually leads to emphysema. (C) Gene expression of inflammatory mediators
  induced by DNA damage. (D) Oxidative stress changes TNF-α-mediated signaling pathway,
  which leads to increased mucus secretion and ciliated cell dysfunction. ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; AA, arachidonic acid; α1-AT, alpha-1-antitrypsin; Nrf2, nuclear
  factor erythroid-2-related factor2; HSF, heat shock transcription factor; NF- kB,
  Nuclear Factor-κB.
