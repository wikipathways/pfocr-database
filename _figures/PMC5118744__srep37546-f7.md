caption: (A,B) A schematic summarising the potential role of nitric oxide in larval
  settlement of Amphimedon queenslandica. (A) The competent A. queenslandica larva
  settles onto a coralline alga, anterior side touching the substratum. (B) A close-up
  of the boxed anterior region shown in (A). Exogenous signals associated with the
  algal surface activate a calcium signalling in flask cells (fc), which in turn signals
  to the surrounding cellular environment via membrane bound (e.g. Notch-Delta signalling
  or locally diffusible signals (dashed arrows). In A. queenslandica, this includes
  columnar epithelial and globular cells (gc), which express high levels of AqNOS
  (brown). These cells are induced to release NO (arrows) at a rate to induce morphogenetic
  and physiological changes in other larval cells, including other NOS-expressing
  cells (brown), leading to larval settlement and the initiation of metamorphosis.
  MAPK signalling is also required for A. queenslandica settlement and metamorphosis
  (not shown). (C) A general model for nitric oxide signalling in induction of larval
  settlement and metamorphosis. Receptor-activated calcium signalling occurs in sensory
  cells upon contact with an inductive exogenous cue, resulting in the release of
  a signalling ligand. This is detected by NOS-expressing cells, possibly by calcium-calmodulin
  binding to NOS, activating the synthesis of NO. The NO signal can induce cellular
  changes, including by binding to its receptor soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and
  S-nitrosylation of members of the Ras-GTPase super family; these may result in the
  activation of the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway. In bilaterian larvae where NO inhibits
  or represses the settlement and metamorphosis, a different model of NO and NOS regulation
  is required. icm, inner cell mass.
