caption: Schematic of 5-HT synthesis, release, and metabolism in a pre-synaptic neuron
  showing 5-HT pathway genes analyzed in SIDS. 1) FEV, Fifth Ewing Variant gene-transcription
  factor critical in differentiation of the 5-HT neuronal phenotype. Promotes the
  expression of TPH2, 5-HTT and 5-HT receptor genes in 5-HT neurons. 2) TPH2, tryptophan
  hydroxylase-2 gene-rate limiting enzyme in biosynthesis of 5-HT, catalyses the formation
  of 5-hydoxytryptophan from tryptophan (Tryp), which is then converted to 5-HT by
  aromatic acid decarboxylase (not shown). 3) 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor genes-mediate
  the downstream effects of 5-HT. 4) 5-HTT, serotonin transporter gene-transports
  5-HT released into the synapse back into the neuron for re-packing in vesicles for
  future release or degradation by MAO-A. 5) MAO-A, mononamine oxidase A-mitochondrial
  enzyme primarily responsible for the degradation of 5-HT into 5-hydoxy-indole-acetaldehyde
  (not shown) that is then converted into 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid (5-HIAA) by
  aldehyde dehydrogenase (not shown).
