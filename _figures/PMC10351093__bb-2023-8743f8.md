caption: 'A schematic summary of CP-induced hepatotoxicity and the hepatoprotective
  role of TA in mice. TA was effective in improving cellular redox status, activating
  Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, mitigating inflammation, and suppressing apoptosis in the liver.

  2; HO-1: Heme oxygenase 1; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; NF-κB: Nuclear transcription
  factor kappa-B.'
