caption: The potential molecular mechanism of CSE anti-hyperlipidemia. CSE ameliorated
  hyperlipidemia in HFD-induced mice by decreasing the expression levels of fat synthesis
  genes and increasing the level of lipolysis genes through the PPAR signaling pathway
  in the liver. In the intestinal tract, SCE decreased the harmful bacteria and increased
  the beneficial bacteria. Moreover, the metabolites from bacteria of L-cysteine,
  succinate, and bile acids could cross the intestinal barrier and regulate the PPAR
  signaling pathway
