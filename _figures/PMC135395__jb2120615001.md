caption: Proposed bicyclic pathway for autotrophic CO2 fixation in C. aurantiacus.
  (Left) 3-Hydroxypropionate cycle for CO2 fixation affording glyoxylate as first
  net CO2 fixation product. (Right) Proposed glyoxylate assimilation cycle. 1, acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; 2, malonyl-CoA reductase; 3, propionyl-CoA synthase; 4, propionyl-CoA
  carboxylase; 5, epimerase; 6, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; 7, citrate cycle enzymes
  (succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase); 8, succinyl-CoA:l-malate CoA transferase;
  9, l-malyl-CoA lyase; 10, erythro-β-methylmalyl-CoA lyase; 11, postulated β-methylmalyl-CoA
  dehydratase; 12, postulated mesaconyl-CoA hydratase; 13, postulated citramalate
  activation by succinyl-CoA:l-citramalate CoA transferase; 14, postulated citramalyl-CoA
  lyase; 15, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; 16, gluconeogenesis enzymes. erythro-β-methylmalyl-CoA,
  mesaconyl-CoA, and citramalate were identified as putative intermediates of the
  proposed glyoxylate assimilation cycle ().
