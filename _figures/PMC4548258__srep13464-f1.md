caption: Spm catalyzes 3-succinoylpyridine (SP) to 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine (HSP)
  in the pyrrolidine pathway. Spm has three subunits SpmA, SpmB, SpmC, respectively
  binding three cofactors Mo-MCD, FAD, and [2Fe-2S] clusters. MoaE is crucial for
  Mo-MCD synthesis and Spm holoenzyme activity.
