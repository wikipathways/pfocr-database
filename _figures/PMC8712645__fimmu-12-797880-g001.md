caption: Overview of DDR components in innate immune responses. DDR factors, including
  DNA-PK and MRE11, promote cytosolic DNA sensing signaling pathways. When activated
  by cytosolic DNA, cGAS produces cGAMP, a soluble second messenger that initiates
  STING-IRF3 signaling both within the host cell and adjacent cells. In addition,
  RAD50 associates with CARD9, leading to NF-κB activation and downstream cytokine
  production. XRCC4 interacts with RIG-I, which promotes the RIG-I-MAVS-IRF3 pathway.
