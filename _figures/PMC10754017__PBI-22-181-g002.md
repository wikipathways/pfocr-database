caption: Model for the regulation of aluminium tolerance through citrate efflux in
  pigeon pea. The mechanism of aluminium tolerance in pigeon pea plant roots is mainly
  based on the chelation of Al3+ by the OA anion. The mechanism of this process involves
  the leakage of OA anions through carriers (MATE) on the plasma membrane. Specifically,
  on one pathway, aluminium stress positively promotes the expression of the transcription
  factors CcNFYB3. The transcription factors CcNFYB3 can bind to the promoters of
  CcMATE35, and promote the transcription of CcMATE35 proteins, thereby promoting
  the release of citrate. On the other pathway, under Al stress, the expression of
  CcLTCS enhanced and positively regulated the expression of CcCS, promoted the synthesis
  of citrate, and also enhanced the tolerance of plants to Al. These two pathways
  synergistically regulate the efflux and synthesis of citrate and play an important
  role in the resistance of plants to aluminium stress.
