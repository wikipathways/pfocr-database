caption: 'Key enzymes and proteins in regulating biosynthesis of phenolic acids in
  FLJ. Phenolic acids are produced from PEP by PAL, 4CL, and CHS. PK, 4CL, and HMGR
  are regulated by ATP. HMGR is related to phenolic acid and hyperoside. The biosynthesis
  of phenolic acids is coordinated closely with fatty acids. Converting glucose to
  PEP is regulated by bHLH. Abbreviations: CHS, chalcone synthase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; PK, pyruvate kinase; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase; FatB, fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase B; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; and Pyr,
  pyruvate.'
