caption: Intracellular “tug-of-war” determines T cell fate. Green arrow indicates
  activation of PI3K signaling; red arrow indicates inhibition of PI3K signaling.
  The strength of PI3K signaling is influenced by opposing activation and inhibitory
  signals that are integrated from extracellular stimuli such as co-stimulation, co-inhibition,
  and cytokines/adipokines. Ultimately, the outcome of this “tug-of-war” determines
  whether a T cell becomes a Treg to mediate tolerance, or inflammatory Th subsets
  to mediate immunity.
