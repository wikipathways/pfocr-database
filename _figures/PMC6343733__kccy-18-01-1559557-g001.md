caption: Cell fate during perturbed mitosis influenced by CEP55 expression. When cancer
  cells (heterogeneous cell population) are exposed to anti-mitotic chemotherapy drugs,
  they undergo arrest in mitosis due to chronic activation of the Spindle Assembly
  Checkpoint (SAC). Cell fate is determined by two competing networks, one that allows
  exit of mitotically arrested cells and the other that activates cell death. Higher
  CEP55 expression facilitates exit from mitotic arrest (mitotic slippage) resulting
  in polyploidy and resistance to anti-mitotic drug-induced death. However, when CEP55
  levels are reduced by MEK1/2 inhibition followed by treatment with anti-mitotic
  drugs (PLK1 inhibition) cells initiate premature entry into mitosis and activate
  the cell death pathway.
