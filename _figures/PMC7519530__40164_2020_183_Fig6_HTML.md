caption: 'Hypothesized role of miR-142-5p and miR-365a-3p in CML signaling. Schematic
  representation of the hypothesized effect of miR-142-5p and miR-365a-3p (indicated
  by red boxes) on CML linked pathways by targeting ABL2, cKIT, MCL1 and SRI (indicated
  by red circles). Ligands as EGFR, FGFR, PDGFR and SCF bind to cKIT and activate
  downstream signaling cascades, including RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and JAK2 [–].
  In the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway [], the GRB2/SOS complex activates a phosphorylation
  cascade that regulate proliferation and apoptosis[]. PI3K/AKT pathway (2) is activated
  e.g. by growth factors and stimulates PI3K, mediating the conversion of PIP2 to
  PIP3. PIP3 translocates AKT to plasma membrane, where AKT regulates numerous proteins
  associated with proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, including NFκB inducing inflammatory
  cytokines like IL-6[, ]. IL-6 activates the JAK/STAT pathway (3) where STAT translocates
  to nucleus, stimulating transcription of genes linked to cell proliferation, differentiation,
  survival and immune function as VEGF and BCL-2-family members like MCL1[]. Upregulation
  of cKIT due to decreased miR-142-5p and miR-365a-3p expression might result in augmented
  proliferation, differentiation and survival. Downregulation of miR-142-5p might
  lead to upregulation of MCL1, facilitating cell survival. Both ABL1 and ABL2 stimulate
  RAC, Cortactin/N-WASP and WAVE/ABI1 (4) promoting migration and invasion through
  lamellipodia protrusion and actin/myosin filament contraction[]. Downregulation
  of miR-142-5p would support metastasis through upregulation of ABL2. Sorcin regulates
  JAK/STAT, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT pathways and MMP expression, hence downregulation
  of miR-142-5p might increase sorcin and promote proliferation, differentiation,
  cell motility and survival[, , ]. Selection of miRNAs known to be linked to CML
  are illustrated in dashed boxes. MiR-29b-3p, miR-30a-5p, miR-30e-5p, miR-203-3p,
  miR-320a-3p, miR-424-5p, miR-451a and miR-23a-3p target BCR/ABL1, while miR-23a-3p,
  let-7b-5p and miR-130a-3p inhibit RAS [, , ]. MiR-130a-3p furthermore regulates
  BCL-2 and MCL1 expression []. Besides inhibiting BCL-2, miR-17/92 targets JAK2/STAT5
  []. MiR-146a-5p and miR-150-5p contribute to CML carcinogenesis by upregulating
  MMPs []. Full gene names listed in Additional file : Table S3'
