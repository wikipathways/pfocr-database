caption: Either component proteins or metabolic products from LTA-deficient L. acidophilus
  are potential antigens that can be recognized by dendritic cells. Presentation of
  antigen to recipient CD4+ T cells induced the genesis of a population of Tregs that
  could further differentiate into Th17 or Th1 cells, depending on the microenvironment.
  Meanwhile, several signaling pathways were triggered in dendritic cells by the recognition
  of antigens. The MAPK-Erk1/2 pathway was shown to be crucial for the expression
  of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and tumor suppressors, such as RUNX3 and
  TIMP3, were also upregulated by the treatment of LTA-deficient L. acidophilus both
  in vitro and in vivo. RNAP II, RNA Polymerase II; TIC, Transcription Initiation
  Complex.
