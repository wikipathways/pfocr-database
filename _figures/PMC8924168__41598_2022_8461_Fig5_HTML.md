caption: BRCA1-dependent phosphorylation signaling events and subcellular localization
  in ovarian cancer. (A) Functional network analysis of the regulated phosphorylated
  proteins identified in our study (nodes with black label) and their interacting
  proteins (nodes with grey label) (q-value < 0.05). The edges represent known protein–protein
  interactions based on the InWeb_IM database (interaction score > 0.9) and visualized
  with Cytoscape (ClusterOne plugin). RNA splicing, p < 0.001; translation, p < 0.001;
  DNA repair, p = 0.002; chromatin remodeling, p = 0.007; PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, p = 0.009
  (one-tail Mann–Whitney U test). (B) Schematic representation of BRCA1 subcellular
  compartmentalization in BRCA1wt and BRCA1mut tumors. Changes in subcellular localization
  may be caused by changes in protein shuttling and import into the nucleus, thus
  reflecting in differential cellular signaling events in ovarian cancer tumors.
