caption: Hypothetical model for biased agonism at GPR40. Activation of GPR40 promotes
  insulin secretion via G protein (Gq/11)-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent mechanisms,
  with the endogenous GPR40 agonists PA and OA and the synthetic agonist TAK-875 displaying
  converse relative efficacies for Gq/11 and β-arrestin pathway activation (as depicted
  by arrow thickness). Left side, TAK-875 acts as a partial agonist of Gq/11 activation.
  β-Arrestin recruitment to GPR40 occurs via Gq/11-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
  Right side, the Gq/11pathway serves as the main GPR40-downstream signaling pathway
  responsible for the insulinotropic activity of PA and OA. PA and OA also engage
  β-arrestins, but with lower efficacy than is observed with TAK-875. Activation of
  β-arrestins by PA and OA is not implicated in mediating their insulin secretagogue
  effect.
