caption: New ceritinib resistance mechanisms and therapeutic strategies to overcome
  them were identified. A diagrammatic representation of the identified ceritinib
  resistance mechanisms mediated by anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation (left)
  and bypass pathway activation resulting from FGFR3 or cMET overexpression.
