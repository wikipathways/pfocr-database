caption: Working model of the yeast response to gene mistranslations. Mistranslated
  proteins are folding substrates of molecular chaperones that compete with wild type
  client substrates for folding/refolding. Gradual accumulation of mistranslated proteins
  shifts the HSP-client binding equilibrium to the subpopulation of misfolded proteins,
  releasing client substrates from HSPs. This activates or inactivates natural HSP-client
  substrates depending on whether the HSP-client interaction is positive or negative.
  HSP substrate release deregulates cellular processes mediated by the HSP client
  proteins and remodels chaperone-chaperone networks, which are critical for cellular
  homeostasis. Increased protein folding/refolding and degradation increase ATP consumption
  leading to up-regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and ROS accumulation. Accumulation
  of mistranslated proteins in mitochondria also increases mitochondrial stress and
  ROS production. Mistranslated proteins that enter the secretory pathway accumulate
  in the ER and up-regulate ER resident chaperones, activating the UPR, further increasing
  ROS production. This leads to a deficit in protein secretion with consequences for
  cell membranes and cell wall structure and function. Aggregation of mistranslated
  proteins exacerbates proteotoxic stress, increases ATP consumption and activates
  the general stress response (ESR) through the transcription factors Msn2/4p and
  Yaps. Mistranslations also down-regulate ribosome biosynthesis, translational factors
  and CLIPS, exacerbating the negative consequences of mistranslations due to the
  critical role of CLIPS in folding newly synthesized proteins.
