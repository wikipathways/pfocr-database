caption: 'Model of cytokinin signal transduction pathway. The cytokinin receptor has
  the following domains: CHASE, cyclases/histidine kinases-associated sensory extracellular
  domain; HK, histidine kinase domain; REC, receiver domain. The asterisk designates
  the intracellular portion of the sensory kinase receptor (consisting of HK and REC),
  in this paper referred to as MtCRE1′. Histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins
  (HPts) are activated by the sensory kinase that perceives the signal, and subsequently
  translocate to the nucleus to transfer the phosphate group to an Asp residue of
  a response regulator (RR). Adapted with modifications from [].'
