caption: Folic acid and homocysteine metabolic pathway. Folic acid is enzymatically
  converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF) by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) via dihydrofolate
  (DHF). THF is converted to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) by methylenetetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase (MTHFD) and catalyzed to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) by methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR). 5-MTHF can be converted to THF again when a methyl group is passed
  to vitamin B12, resulting in methyl-vitamin B12. The methyl group can metabolize
  homocysteine into methionine. Homocysteine is also catabolized to cysteine by a
  vitamin B6-dependent enzyme, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS). Vitamin D has the effect
  of enhancing enzyme activity of CBS.
