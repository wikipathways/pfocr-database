caption: Role of LILRB family. LILRB1 inhibits Fc receptor-mediated signaling in NK
  cells and monocytes and possibly plays an anti-tumor effect in hepatocarcinoma cells
  by activating SHP-1, which could then inhibit PI3K/Akt pathway. In endometrial cancer
  cells, LILRB2 could enhance the SHP2/CaMK1/CREB signaling pathways. LILRB4 supports
  tumor cell infiltration into tissues and suppresses T cell activity possibly via
  APOE, LILRB4, SHP-2, uPAR and ARG1 in AML cells. LILRB, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like
  receptor B; SHP, SH2-domain bearing protein tyrosine phosphatase; NK, natural killer;
  AML, acute myeloid leukemia.
