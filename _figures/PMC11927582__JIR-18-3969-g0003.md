caption: Sufu plays an important regulatory role in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated
  inflammatory responses. It inhibits the process of TRAF6 oligomerization and self-ubiquitination
  by directly interacting with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). In LPS-induced
  inflammation, phase separation of TRAF6 is a key link in the activation of its ubiquitination
  and NF-κB signaling pathway, and Sufu effectively prevented the formation of phase-separated
  droplets of TRAF6, which inhibited the activation of the LPS-induced NF-κB signaling
  pathway. This figure is drawn by Figfraw(www.figdraw.com)
