caption: Schematic representation of the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects
  of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) and its constituents. (1) Inhibition of ROS and suppression
  of the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., COX-2 and NO) and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) via the NF-κB signaling pathway. EGb can also
  inhibit the STAT 1/3 pathway. (2) Blocking of iNOS expression through a reduction
  in NO levels. (3) Inhibition of LPS-induced inflammatory response. (4) Prevention
  of mitochondrial oxidative stress by promoting the expression of anti-apoptotic
  proteins. (5) Inhibition of TLR4-NF-κB signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. (6)
  Prevention of the intracellular accumulation of p-Tau and cellular protection from
  Tau-hyperphosphorylation-related toxicity. (7) Blocking signaling pathways that
  involve CDK5, p38 MAPK, and GSK-3β. (8) Inhibition of NMDA and AMPA receptors, preventing
  the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). (Created with BioRender)
