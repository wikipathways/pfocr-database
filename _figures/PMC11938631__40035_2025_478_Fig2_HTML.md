caption: Regulation of BBB permeability by APOE4. APOE4 secreted by astrocytes has
  a low binding affinity for the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
  1 (LRP1) on pericytes. This weak binding activates the proinflammatory CypA/MMP-9
  pathway, which results in release of MMP-9 into the extracellular space. Here, MMP-9
  enzymatically degrades the basement membrane (BM) and junction proteins, leading
  to BBB breakdown. Created with BioRender.com
