caption: DAMGO and morphine differentially assemble protein-interaction networks to
  control MOR spatiotemporal signaling. A, DAMGO activation of the MOR leads to rapid
  recruitment of GRK2 and β-arrestins and facilitates a redistribution of the MOR
  at the plasma membrane (). The DAMGO-stimulated receptor is in close proximity to
  IQGAP1, a large scaffolding protein that is required for the activation of Rac1
  and nuclear ERK. IQGAP1 has been previously shown to bind both ERK and Rac1 ().
  The DAMGO-stimulated MOR also associates with the adaptor protein, CRKL, which is
  essential for the activation of both Rac1 and nuclear ERK. The activation of Rac1
  and nuclear ERK (10 min) occurs prior to receptor internalization (30–60 min ()).
  B, in contrast, morphine activation of the MOR stimulates a Gαi/o–Gβγ–PKCα pathway,
  which increases the proximity of MOR to desmosomal proteins. Desmosomes are formed
  by two transmembrane proteins, DSC and DSG, which in turn interact with the intracellular
  proteins plakoglobin/JUP, plakophilin (PKP) and desmoplakin (DSP) (). The formation
  of stabilized desmosomal-like plasma membrane domains likely contributes to the
  inability of the morphine-stimulated MOR to redistribute and therefore controls
  the sustained increase in cytosolic ERK activity. Knockdown of DSC1 (green) or JUP
  (cyan) facilitated a transient increase in nuclear ERK in response to morphine,
  indicative of a redistribution of the receptor at the plasma membrane ().
