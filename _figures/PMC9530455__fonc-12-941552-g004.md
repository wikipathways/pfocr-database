  pathway in T3 treated nodules vs. untreated nodules; (B) IPA analysis of Oxidative
  Phosphorylation pathway in T3-treated nodules vs. untreated nodules; (C) Results
  of NGS analysis showing fold change of the key genes involved in proline metabolism:
  Pycr1, Aldh18a1 and Prodh2. P-adjusted value = 0.05 and FC ± 1.5; (D) qRT-PCR analysis
  of the expression of PYCR1 and ALDH18a1 in HepG2 cells not transduced (PLVX) or
  transduced with THRB and treated (T3) or not (NT) for 48 hours with 100nM T3. MiRNA
  expression was calculated as fold change using the 2-ΔΔCt method and RNU48 as endogenous
  control. Student t-test: *P < 0.05; **P<0.01. Values are expressed as mean ± SD.'
