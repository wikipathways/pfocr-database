caption: CCR5 and HAND. Binding of HIV-1 via its gp120 V3 domain to CCR5 leads to
  activation of this chemokine receptor. This triggers two different signaling pathways
  that may lead to the cognitive deficits in HAND. An acute, direct pathway (red arrows)
  inhibits CREB, MAPK, and dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), subsequently inhibiting
  synaptic plasticity. A chronic, indirect pathway (green arrows) activates microglia,
  causing neuroinflammation, neuronal dysfunction, and synaptodendritic injury. Both
  pathways result in HIV-associated plasticity and cognitive function deficits. Maraviroc
  and other CCR5 antagonists block gp120 binding to CCR5, ameliorating these deficits.
