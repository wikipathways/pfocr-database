caption: Potential mechanisms of disease in GALE deficiency. UDP-galactose-4′-epimerase
  (GALE) along with galactokinase 1 (GALK) and galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase
  (GALT) constitute the Leloir pathway for the catabolism of galactose. Individuals
  with generalized GALE deficiency will develop symptoms of galactosemia, liver and
  cardiac failure, hypotonia, failure to thrive and cataracts, after breastfeeding
  or milk diet in association with an increase in total galactose. Intermediate forms
  of GALE deficiency may potentially lead to developmental and hematologic disorders
  by disturbing posttranslational protein glycosylation. Endogenous and exogenous
  sources of UDP-glcNAc and UDP-galNAc may not compensate the substrate pool supply
  for glycan biosynthesis during increased demand. N-glycosylation regulates the distribution,
  localization, and activation of many proteins including receptors with tyrosine
  kinase activity. States of cell surface hypoglycosylation are associated with a
  decrease in survival signals and increased susceptibility to cell death. Abnormal
  protein glycosylation may explain the manifestations, other than classic galactosemia,
  observed in individuals with GALE deficiency.
