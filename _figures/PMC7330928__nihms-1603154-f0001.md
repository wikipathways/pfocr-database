caption: The amyloidogenic pathway of APP. The amyloidogenic pathway involves the
  sequential cleavage of APP by β-secretase, which releases the soluble ectodomain
  sAPPβ. The remaining C99 fragment of APP is then cleaved by γ-secretase, resulting
  in the formation of the Aβ peptide. Due to its high propensity to aggregate, Aβ
  peptide oligomerizes, accumulates, and forms amyloid senile plaques, in turn leading
  to the documented alterations in Alzheimer’s disease. Aβ amyloid-β, AICD amyloid
  precursor protein intracellular domain, APP amyloid precursor protein, sAPPβ soluble
  peptide APPβ
