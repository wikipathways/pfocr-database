caption: Cartoon depiction illustrating potential saturated free-fatty acid mechanisms
  that may underlie arrhythmogenic events. High-fat diet induce elevations of saturated
  free-fatty acids (SFFAs) leading to increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines
  in macrophages. Cardiac macrophages sense high concentrations of SFFAs through the
  toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and/or toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) which induces expression
  of inflammatory target genes including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin-6
  (IL-6), by regulating the activities of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (). SFFAs also
  induce interleukin-1β secretion via the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, which
  is independent of the TLR4 pathway (). Hemichannels control the exchange of small
  molecules including ATP (). The released ATP binds to the cell-surface purinergic
  receptors P2X7R, and can control inflammation by regulating the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (including IL-1β) (). There is a paucity of lipid studies involving the
  IL-6 signaling pathway, and therefore the molecular mechanisms of IL-6 modulation
  of cardiac function is poorly understood. In cardiomyocytes, IL-6 mediates its effect
  through its classical pathway. IL-6 binds to the glycoprotein 80 transmembrane IL-6
  receptor (IL-6R) (), which leads to dimerization and activation of the signal transducing
  protein of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and its downstream effector signaling molecules
  Janus kinase (JAK) 2/4 (; ; ). We hypothesize that SFFA mediated cardiac electrical
  remodeling that increase vulnerability to arrythmias may occur through SFFAs/TLR/NF-kB-IL-6
  mediated altered gene and protein expression of ion channel subunits, trafficking
  and/or gating defects. Distinguishing among these signaling pathways is likely to
  provide mechanistic insights that will influence considerations of anti-cytokine
  therapy for the management of metabolic disorders and arrythmias. The black ? indicates
  that whether or how activation of JAK2/4 leads to remodeling of ion channel molecular
  partners is poorly understood. The black? (associated with the purple arrows), represents
  an unresolved role for IL-6 modulation of major cardiac ion channels (ICa, INa,
  IKr, and IKs) in lipotoxicity and pathogenesis of arrhythmias including long QT
  syndrome (LQTS) and atrial fibrillation (AF).
