caption: 'LRRK2 could have an impact on α-syn release (grey numbers) as well as on
  its relocalization (black numbers) leading to a cell-cell transmission of the pathology
  and to an increase of the aggregation through an excess of α-syn in the cytosolic
  pool (grey part). Three mechanisms seem to be impacted: the mitochondrial biology
  (blue part), the autophagic system (orange part) and the inflammation (violet part).
  Both LRRK2 and α-syn are known to play a role in mitochondrial biology through Drp1
  (blue number) in favor of a mitochondrial fragmentation leading to mitophagy and
  cell death. Inside the cell, α-syn aggregates are mainly degraded by the autophagic-lysosomal
  pathway, which is one of the major protein breakdown systems (orange part). LRRK2
  was found to decrease the activity of Rab7, which is implicated in the maturation
  of the autophagosome and thus blocking the degradation of the α-syn aggregates.
  Outside the cell, α-syn aggregates are captured by microglia to be degraded. One
  hypothesis is that LRRK2 could alter the machinery of phagocytosis leading to an
  accumulation of extracellular aggregates.'
