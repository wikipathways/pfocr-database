caption: Panel A shows the progressive formation of lipid droplet (LD) at the endoplasmic
  reticulum in normal cells. Shown also are the enzymes involved in the synthesis
  of triglycerides, although it is unclear if all the enzymes of the pathway are present
  at the LD. The small LDs in adipocytes fuse to form one or more large LDs. Shown
  also are proteins of PAT class which decorate the LD surface. Panel B shows the
  reduced triglyceride synthesis due to deficiency of one of the key enzymes, AGPAT2
  in patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy, type 1. Fusion of LDs may
  still occur, but at considerably reduced rate. It is likely that the LDs may be
  totally devoid of TG (shown in white) or minimal TG synthesis may occur utilizing
  other AGPAT isoforms. Other possibilities (not shown) are that LDs may not form
  due to lack of synthesis of LD surface glycerophospholipids or there may be total
  lack of adipocyte development due to lack of phospholipid synthesis required for
  formation of cell membrane and other organelles. In panel C, where the cells lack
  expression of seipin as happens in patients with congenital lipodystrophy, type
  2, fusion of LDs may not occur, however, synthesis of triglyceride may still continue
  resulting in several small LDs instead of one or more large LDs.
