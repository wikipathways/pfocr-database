  ABA interplay with ethylene in fig fruit during ripening. (B) Changes in activity
  of ABA metabolic pathway genes in the fruit following on-tree exogenous application
  of ABA, ethephon, NDGA and fluridone. (C) Changes in activity of ethylene-biosynthesis,
  MADS-box, NAC, and ERF gene in the fruit following on-tree exogenous application
  of ABA, ethephon, NDGA, fluridone, and 1-MCP (). Downward arrows indicate down-regulated
  genes in treated fruit compared to untreated controls; upward arrows indicate up-regulated
  genes. The arrows are color-coded as follows: red, ABA; purple, ethephon; green,
  NDGA; blue, fluridone; black, 1MCP.'
