  Schematic representation of critical phosphorylation sites and their roles in signaling.
  Y794 in the juxtamembrane domain facilitates PLCγ1 binding and eNOS activation,
  promoting nitric oxide (NO) release and tubular structure formation. Y1169 recruits
  PLCγ1, while Y1213 enables binding of SH2 domain proteins such as PLCγ1, SHP2, and
  GRB2, supporting PI3K-mediated cell survival and proliferation. Y1242 and Y1333
  support PLCγ1 phosphorylation but are insufficient for full mitogenic signaling.
  VEGF165b inhibits Y1333 phosphorylation, suppressing VEGFR1-STAT3 signaling, which
  can be restored to enhance angiogenesis in peripheral artery disease. b VEGFR2:
  Key phosphorylation sites and their roles in vascular functions. Y801 and Y1214
  activate GAB1, promoting PI3K/AKT signaling, endothelial survival, migration, and
  NO production. Y951 (Y949 in mice) binds TSAd, regulating vascular permeability
  via the VEGFR2-TSAd-SRC complex. Y1054 and Y1059 are essential for full kinase activity,
  while Y1175 recruits adaptor proteins such as SHB and PLCγ1. Serine phosphorylation
  at S1183 and S1188 in mice (S1185 and S1190 in humans) promotes VEGFR2 degradation
  via β-TRCP1-mediated ubiquitination, regulating receptor stability. c VEGFR3: Schematic
  representation of essential phosphorylation sites and their roles in cell signaling.
  Phosphorylation at Y1063 recruits CRK I/II, activating the JNK pathway to support
  cell survival. Y1230 and Y1231 facilitate GRB2 recruitment, initiating ERK and AKT
  signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and migration. Y1337 acts as
  a docking site for the GRB2-SHC complex, driving RAS-mediated signaling. PLCγ1 Phospholipase
