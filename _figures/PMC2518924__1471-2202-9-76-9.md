caption: 'The CEBPD network. (A) The differentially expressed genes from three models
  were constructed into an interaction network associated with CEBPD as a master regulated
  gene in PathwayArchitect. 152 genes with a high confidence index of direct and indirect
  interactions with CEBPD were included in the pathway. Connecting lines between gene
  symbols indicate interactions, the purple thick solid lines indicate the direct
  interactions between CEBPD and 7 genes, and they are GFAP, MBP, IGFBP5, FOS, CEBPB,
  CEBPA, ATF4 and HMOX1. Each of those genes connects to multiple functional genes
  highlighted with different color. Different types of interactions are denoted by
  symbols on the lines. Links scheme: Green square indicates regulation; arrow, direction
  of regulation; blue square with black border, binding; blue square, expression;
  orange circle, protein modification; green diamond with blue border, metabolism;
  green circle, promoter binding; light green triangle, transport; + in gray circle,
  positive effect; and – in gray circle, negative effect. (B) Temporal profile of
  CEBPD network in cerebellum of three models. Red nodes show gene expression level
  increase. Green nodes show gene expression decrease. Grey nodes present no significant
  change.'
