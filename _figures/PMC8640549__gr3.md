caption: GPR56 signaling in pathological processes. (A) In a colorectal cancer (CRC)
  cell, progastrin (PG) binds to GPR56 and promotes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition and metastasis by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, GPR56 also promotes
  drug resistance by promoting MDR1 expression via the RhoA pathway [, , ]. (B) GPR56
  inhibits the metastasis and tumor survival in a melanoma cell by internalization
  and degradation of TG2-bound GPR56 thereby controlling the concentration of TG2
  in ECM which is a major promoter of tumor survival [,]. An alternative mechanism
  observed in melanoma cells is the interaction of GPR56 with tetraspanins such as
  CD81, which recruit Gαq/11(Gβγ) heterotrimer and finally inhibits VEGF secretion,
  and hence the angiogenesis, via the PKCα pathway [,]. (C) In the HT1080 cell line,
  heparin has been demonstrated to bind to the NTF of GPR56 [,]. One of the major
  heparin-binding sites of GPR56 overlaps with the collagen III-binding site, hence
  making heparin capable of modulating the binding and signaling by collagen III [].
  It is observed that the binding of heparin reduces NTF shedding and promotes cell
  motility and adhesion []. (D) In U87-MG cells, GPR56 inhibits cell migration via
  the Gαq and Rho pathway []. Moreover, GPR56 also inhibits mesenchymal transition
  and radioresistance by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway upstream of NEMO [].
  TNF activates the TNF receptor which promotes mesenchymal transition and radioresistance
  by activating NF-κB signaling pathway and downregulating GPR56 indirectly []. The
  solid lines represent direct interaction, whereas the dotted lines indicate indirect
  pathways with potential additional intermediate(s).
