caption: The levels of miR-146a and miR-146b are regulated by innate immune signaling.
  The levels of miR-146a and miR-146b are up- or down- regulated by TLR-induced intracellular
  signaling. TLR3 activates PI3K-JNK and NF-κB signal pathways, which up-regulates
  the level of miR-146a. TLR2 signaling activates the IRAK1-TRAF6-NFκB pathway that
  enhances inflammatory responses through producing proinflammatory cytokines and
  chemokines. The activation of miR-146a decreases proinflammatory cytokines via inhibiting
  IRAK1 and TRAF6. MiR-146b level is up-regulated by TLR4 signaling through STAT3
  and IL-10. Angiopoietin-1 induces miR-146b expression. The expression of miR-146a
  is negatively regulated by IFN-induced CARD10-IRAK1 pathway.
