caption: Schematic overview of the proposed ataxin-3 degrading pathway mediated by
  KPNB1 and CLPP. a KPNB1 overexpression activates mitochondrial protease CLPP, leading
  to the degradation and reduction of ataxin-3 protein levels. Likewise, overexpression
  of CLPP has a comparable effect on ataxin-3 protein levels. Cleavage of peptides
  by the protease component of the Clp complex is an ATP-dependent process []. b KPNB1
  knockdown and pharmacological inhibition as well as CLPP knockdown prevent ataxin-3
  degradation via the proposed pathway. OE overexpression, KD knockdown, Inh. inhibition
