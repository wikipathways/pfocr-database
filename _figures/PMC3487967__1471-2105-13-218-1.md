caption: 'Flow chart of multi-scale agent-based cancer modeling. The model encompasses
  four biological scales: the molecular scale, the cellular scale, the micro-environmental
  scale and the tissue scale. The molecular scale consists of the EGFR signaling and
  cell cycle pathways (Figure ). The cellular scale simulates the phenotypic switch
  of the tumor cells as determined by the molecular scale, the cell-cell and the cell-microenvironment
  interactions (Figure ). The micro-environmental scale provides a connection between
  the micro-vasculature (angiogenesis) and the tumor cells. Tumor cells consume glucose
  and oxygen nutrients. The tumor growth factor alpha (TGFα) secreted by tumor cells
  triggers the EGFR signaling pathway, which in turn determines cell’s phenotype switch.
  Oxygen plays an important role in the cell cycle during the proliferation phase.
  The VEGF secreted by the tumor cells induces angiogenesis. The tissue scale focuses
  on angiogenesis (Figure ). Blood vessel sprouts migrate and branch via tip endothelial
  cells'' migration in response to VEGF chemotaxis and fibronectin haptotaxis.'
