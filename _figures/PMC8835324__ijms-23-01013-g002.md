caption: Typical and JAK2V617F induced dysregulated JAK2-STAT signaling. Normal JAK-STAT
  signaling is mediated by cytokines and growth factors, for instance, EPO and TPO,
  which maintain an ordered balance of cell proliferation and differentiation by self-renewal
  in HSC cell pool and are essential for normal blood cell formation (left panel).
  The JAK2V617F mutation causes JAK2 to be more sensitive to cytokines and consistently
  activates the JAK-STAT pathway. The over-activation of JAK2-STAT signaling alters
  the critical cell fate and leads to more progenitor cell development and further
  progression to MPN (right panel).
