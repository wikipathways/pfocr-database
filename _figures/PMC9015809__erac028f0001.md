caption: 'Central carbon metabolism in trees. Solid and dashed arrows represent substantial
  and negligible metabolite fluxes, respectively. Red arrows: reactions introducing
  the Δ5–6ʹ signal. CBC, Calvin–Benson cycle; PCO cycle, photosynthetic carbon oxidation
  cycle (photorespiration); MEP, non-mevalonate pathway. Metabolites: 2PGA, 2-phosphoglycerate;
  3PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; OAA, oxaloacetate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR,
  pyruvate. Enzymes: (1) Rubisco; (2) TPI, triose-phosphate isomerase; (3) aldolase,
  fructose-bisphosphate aldolase; (4) np-GAPDH, irreversible non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; (5) p-GAPDH, reversible phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; (6) PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; (7) PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase;
  (8) enolase, (9) PK, pyruvate kinase; (10) PPDK, pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase;
  (11) PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; (12) DAHPS, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate
  7-phosphate synthase.  and  show the reactions in more detail. In contrast to its
  representation here, parts of the PCO cycle reside outside chloroplasts, in peroxisomes,
  and mitochondria. Localization of parts of the shikimate pathway in the cytosol
  is being debated (). To avoid clutter, not all metabolic intermediates are shown.
  For instance, conversion of 3PGA to GAP proceeds via 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.'
