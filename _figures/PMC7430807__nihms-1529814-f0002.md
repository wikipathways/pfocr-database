caption: Exercise and pregnancy decrease glucose catabolism, which appears critical
  for physiologic growth. Exercise decreases phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity and
  glucose catabolism acutely. This coordinates ancillary biosynthetic pathway activity
  and activates the exercise gene program, i.e., it decreases expression of Cebpb
  and increases expression of Cited4. Pregnancy-induced changes in progesterone increase
  Pdk4, which decreases PDH activity and glucose catabolism to promote cardiac growth.
  The gene programs triggered by this metabolic change remain unclear. Under conditions
  of pressure overload, as occurs in hypertension, PFK activity is augmented, which
  would alter ancillary biosynthetic pathway activity. High glucose utilization also
  appears to diminish Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 15, which suppresses the expression
  of BCAA catabolic enzymes. This increases BCAA levels in the heart, which activates
  mTOR and promotes cell hypertrophy.
