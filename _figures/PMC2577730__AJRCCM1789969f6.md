caption: 'Proposed mechanism for inhibition of alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) after
  influenza A virus (IAV) infection of BALB/c mice. IAV infection results in increased
  release of the 5′-nucleotides, UTP and ATP, into the ALF. The UTP metabolite, UDP,
  activates P2Y6-subtype purinergic receptors, resulting in inhibition of amiloride-sensitive
  epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) and reduced active Na+ absorption. Concurrently,
  released ATP is metabolized by 5′ ectonucleotidases to adenosine, which activates
  A1-subtype adenosine receptors (A1-AR) and thereby stimulates bronchoalveolar epithelial
  Cl− secretion via the CFTR. Together, reduced Na+ absorption and increased Cl− secretion
  result in severe impairment of AFC. Points of action of pharmacologic inhibitors
  used in the current study are also indicated: A77–1726 inhibits de novo pyrimidine
  synthesis; fluoxetine and ROCKi block opening of volume-regulated ion channels,
  which are the proposed release pathway for UTP; apyrase and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase
  (UDP-G-PP) prevent formation of UDP from UTP (by promoting formation of UMP and
  UDP-glucose from UTP, respectively); suramin and XAMR-0721 are P2Y purinergic receptor
  antagonists; amiloride inhibits ENaC activity; metADO inhibits 5′ ectonucleotidase–mediated
  hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine; 8-SPT and DCPCX are A1-adenosine receptor antagonists;
  CFTRinh-172 and glibenclamide are CFTR Cl− channel blockers.'
