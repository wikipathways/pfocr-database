caption: LncRNA can participate in the progression of disease by regulating several
  signal pathways. (A) Schematic of the Hippo signaling pathway and the interaction
  between lncRNAs and the pathway. (B) Schematic of the Notch signaling pathway and
  the interactions between lncRNAs and the pathway. (C) Schematic of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway and the interactions between lncRNAs and the pathway. (D) Schematic of the
  Hedgehog signaling pathway and the interactions between lncRNAs and the pathway.
