caption: 'Targeting MRD/MMSC with small-drug inhibitors, immune-based interventions
  and IL-6-targeted therapies may result in a cure for patients with myeloma. a Curative
  blueprint for myeloma. The currently available myeloma therapies are highly efficient
  in killing the great majority of myeloma cells (excentric nucleus, rich cytoplasm,
  paranuclear Golgi zone) but are unable to eradicate a tiny subpopulation of cells
  that exhibit stem cell-like features and are called MMSCs. These cells underlie
  MRD and often acquire drug resistance in the course of myeloma treatment, leading
  to relapse of a therapy-resistant tumor. Treatments that target MMSC/MRD efficiently
  may result in a cure for myeloma. Owing to the genetic complexity of myeloma and
  its perpetual clonal diversification [– ], targeted eradication of MRD cells may
  be best accomplished in an adjuvant setting at a relatively early stage of myeloma
  treatment. b Two principal forms of MRD/MMSC-targeted therapies: small-drug inhibitors
  and immunological approaches. Inhibitors target stemness genes, such as MYC (JQ1);
  stemness pathways, such as Wnt (celecoxib), Notch (BMS-906024) and Hedgehog (itraconazole,
  cyclopamine); drug resistance pathway, such as multidrug resistance (sildenafil);
  and, last but not least, individual candidate MMSC genes, such as RARA2 (ATRA),
  NEK2 (CCT250863) and BTK (ibrutinib). Immune-based therapies for targeting MRD include
  CAR-T cells and dendritic cell vaccines (see main text for details). Also included
  is a growing panel of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies exhibiting reactivity to
  CS1 (elotuzumab), CD38 (daratumumab), CD56 (lorvotuzumab), VEGF (bevacizumab), EGR
  (cetuximab), KIR (IPH2101), FGFR3 (MFGR1877S), BAFF (LY2127399) and other myeloma
  targets. To be fully effective, immunotherapy must probably be combined with small-drug
  inhibitors and IL-6-targeted drugs shown in panel C. c Approaches to inhibit IL-6
  signaling in myeloma including cancer stem cell-like cells (bottom) and bone marrow
  stroma cells (top) []. Labeled circles indicate active research areas, which can
  be categorized as follows: a Tocilizumab is a humanized antibody to IL-6R, which
  competitively inhibits IL-6 signaling by virtue of binding to the receptor''s ligand-binding
  site []. The antibody inhibits both canonical/classical IL-6 signaling and IL-6
  trans-signaling because it binds to both cell membrane-bound IL-6R and soluble IL-6R
  []. Tocilizumab has been approved for the treatment of arthritis and is currently
  undergoing clinical testing for other disease. However, there are no clinical trials
  of myeloma at this juncture. b Antibodies neutralizing IL-6 include mouse BE-8 (elsilimomab)
  and siltuximab (CNTO 328, Centocor). Siltuximab is a chimeric human-mouse antibody
  and thus less immunogenic than BE-8. Siltuximab shows promising activity in MM,
  even under conditions of dexamethasone-refractory disease []. Siltuximab is now
  in clinical trial for patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma (NCT01484275).
  A fully humanized, high-affinity derivative of B-E8, designated mAb 1339, has been
  developed recently. It showed promising preclinical activity in studies using mice
  and the IL-6-dependent HMCL, INA-6 [], but has not yet been advanced to clinical
  testing. A different approach for targeting the IL-6R, which relies on a recombinant
  protein instead of a monoclonal antibody, is afforded by Sant7. “Sant” stands for
  super antagonist; i.e., a genetically engineered human IL-6 that binds to gp80 with
  higher affinity than normal IL-6 does. However, because Sant7 does not recruit gp130
  to the IL-6R, it blocks IL-6 signaling. Although Sant7 was highly effective in preclinical
  model systems of myeloma [–], it has not been further developed for clinical applications
  []. c An interesting development is a fusion protein that consists of soluble gp130
  (sgp130) linked to the Fc-region of human IgG. The recombinant protein, dubbed FE999301,
  is jointly being developed for clinical use by CONARIS Research Institute (Kiel,
  Germany) and Ferring Pharmaceuticals (Saint-Prex, Switzerland) []. FE999301 builds
  on knowledge that sgp130 is a natural inhibitor of IL-6/sIL-6R []. FE999301 blocks
  primarily IL-6 trans-signaling, the main driver of IL-6''s inflammatory functions.
  FE999301 was shown to be effective in a mouse model of inflammation-induced cancer
  []. d Inhibitors of gp130, such as gp130-targeting peptides []. e Small-molecule
  inhibitors that may block IL-6 production in BMSCs. One example is a recently developed
  indolinone inhibitor that abrogates the kinase activity of FGF and VEGF receptor
  tyrosine kinases, resulting in disruption of the IL-6/VEGF/FGF amplification loop
  described in the main text. This, in turn, led to enhanced spontaneous and dexamethasone-induced
  apoptosis of HMCLs and patient myeloma cells without inducing death in normal cells,
  such as B-lymphocytes []. Similarly, a newly developed histone deacetylase inhibitor
  dramatically reduces IL-6 production in BMSCs (by 80–95 %), and the subsequent induction
  of apoptosis in HMCLs and freshly isolated myeloma cells []'
