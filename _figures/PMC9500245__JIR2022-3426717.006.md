caption: Role of GZMB, NRP1, SERPINB9, and ITPR1 transcripts in GV pathogenesis. (a)
  The decreased ITPR1 transcripts could lead to impaired calcium-NFAT signalling pathway,
  which might result in decreased GZMB and NRP1 transcripts. Further, the decreased
  SERPINB9 transcripts may result in increased granzyme B-mediated endogenous apoptosis
  of Tregs. Overall, the decreased GZMB, NRP1, SERPINB9, and ITPR1 transcripts result
  into decreased Treg suppressive capacity, which could lead to unchecked CD4+ and
  CD8+ T cells and thereby results into melanocytes' destruction contributing to GV
  pathogenesis, progression, and severity. (b) Upon calcium treatment, ITPR1 mRNA
  expression is increased which may lead to intracellular Treg calcium influx and
  calcium-NFAT signalling pathway, thereby results into increased GZMB and SERPINB9
  transcripts, leading to increased Treg suppressive capacity. The increased Treg
  suppressive capacity controls the CD8+ and CD4+ T cells proliferation and IFN-γ
  production and thereby contributes to melanocytes survival.
