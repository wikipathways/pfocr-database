caption: 'LRRFIP1/GCF2 binds to exogenous and endogenous nucleic acids and activates
  type 1 interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Single and double stranded-nucleic
  acids, derived from infections with bacteria and virus and from necrotic and apoptotic
  dead cells, are bound to LRRFIP1/GCF2 to activate IFN-βgene transcription through
  β-catenin and IRF3. β-catenin is phosphorylated at Ser552 by the infections, potentially
  by protein kinase A or Akt [,]. The nucleic acids are also bound by TLRs, which
  activate NF-κB to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. LRRFIP1/GCF2 competes with
  FliiH to interact with MyD88 so as to stimulate the TLR/NF-κB pathway. In non-virulent
  infection, β-catenin binds directly to and inhibits NF-κB, negatively regulating
  inflammation []. Although LRRFIP1/GCF2 represses the variant promotor of EAAT2(GLT-1)
  gene, LRRFIP1/GCF2 increases the level of EAAT2(GLT-1) protein in cerebral cells,
  which could prevent the excitotoxicity of a stroked brain. These two pathways are
  crucial responses to microbial infections and cell death, such as by brain ischemia.
  Abbreviations used; LRRFIP1/GCF2: Leucine Rich Repeat of Flightless-1 Interacting
  Protein 1/GC-binding factor 2, TLR: Toll like receptor, Fli-1: Flightless-1, FliiH:
  Flightless-1 homologue, MyD88: Myeloid differentiation factor 88, CBP: Creb-binding
  protein, IRF3: Interferon regulatory factor 3, EAAT2(GLT-1): Excitatory amino acid
  transporter 2 (Glutamate transporter 1).'
