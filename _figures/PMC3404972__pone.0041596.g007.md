caption: Angiogenesis and alveolar formation in the lung can be controlled by LRP5-Tie2
  signaling depending on the Ang1/Ang2 ratio. In normal postnatal lung development
  where Ang1 is dominant, LRP5, an essential component of the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway, increases Tie2 expression in ECs and stimulates (downward arrow symbols)
  neonatal lung vascular and alveolar development. However, LRP5-Tie2 signaling inhibits
  (T-bar symbol) vascular and alveolar development when the lungs are exposed to hyperoxia
  in which Ang2 is upregulated.
