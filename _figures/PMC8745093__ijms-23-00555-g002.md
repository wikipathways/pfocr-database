caption: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between various types of systemic
  treatment of psoriasis and no treatment. Normalized protein expressions of Olink
  CVDII, CVDIII and Inflammation panels were compared separately between various types
  of effective antipsoriatic treatment (PASI < 3.0) and no treatment (PASI > 10.0,
  n = 23), and visualized by Volcano plots. (a) Methotrexate (n = 11); (b) Ustekinumab
  (IL-12/23 antibody, n = 5); (c) Secukinumab (IL-17 antibody, n = 6); (d) Adalimumab
  (TNF antibody, n = 8). LogFC are in Log2 scale, and adjusted p-values < 0.05 are
  colored and labeled in blue. (e) Venn diagram of DEPs resulting from various types
  of treatment show shared PI3 and IL-17C protein changes. (f) Gene set enrichment
  for all 11 DEPs from each of the treatment types identified enrichment of the IL-17
  signaling pathway.
