caption: (A) The FLT3-ITD mutation constitutively activates FLT3 signaling, independent
  of FLT3 ligand. FLT3 signals through the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway, the MEK/ERK pathway,
  and through STAT5, both from the membrane and as an immature form from the endoplasmic
  reticulum. (B) When cells with RAS mutations associated with midostaurin resistance
  make up part of the cell population, upregulation of the MEK/ERK and PI3 kinase/AKT
  pathways occurs, along with increased cell survival and proliferation.
