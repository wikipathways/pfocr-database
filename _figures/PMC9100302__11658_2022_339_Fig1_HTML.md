caption: The coronavirus replication cycle. Binding of the virion to the host cell
  receptor through its spike protein S1 subunit is the first step of the coronavirus
  life cycle. After receptor binding, the virus gains access to the cytosol by acid-dependent
  proteolytic cleavage of the S protein into S1 and S2 subunits. Then, after release
  of the viral genome, the replicase can be translated from the genomic RNA. Following
  this, viral RNA synthesis and viral replication–transcription complexes occur. Over
  the next step, viral structural proteins (S, E, and M) are translated from the RNA,
  thus inserting into the endoplasmic reticulum and moving to the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi
  intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Then, multiple copies of the nucleocapsid (N protein)
  package genomic RNA can be seen. They interact with hydrophobic M proteins in the
  ERGIC, thereby serving direct assembly of the virion. Virions budded from the membranes
  of the ERGIC are then transported out of the cell through the exocytic pathway
