caption: A schema for ACE2-mediated dysfunction of vascular endothelium leading to
  thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. (Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor expressed
  at the vascular endothelial cell surface leads to internalization and replication
  of the virus inside the cell and consequently endothelial dysfunction that activates
  prothrombotic cascade. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 binding induces downregulation of
  ACE2, resulting in imbalances of ACE/ACE2 ratio, and dysregulation of RAAS, favoring
  prothrombosis. Both of these stated mechanisms in consequence also induce activation
  and aggregation of the platelets, altogether culminating in intravascular thrombosis.
  Furthermore, NETs that cause increased concentrations of intracellular ROS in neutrophils
  inducing vascular endothelial dysfunction and activation of coagulation pathways.
  Furthermore, hypoxia-induced hyperviscosity and upregulation of the HIF-1α signaling
  pathway can be contributing to the vascular thrombosis.) HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1alpha; NETs, neutrophil extracellular traps; ROS, reactive oxygen species;

  COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome
