caption: A simplified schematic of the Hippo-YAP signaling network. Environmental
  cues regulate MST1/2, MAP4K4 and LATS1/2 kinase activity in the Hippo signaling
  pathway. LATS1/2 represses YAP proteins activity by phosphorylation, which promotes
  their degradation by the recruitment of SCFβ-TRCP E3 ubiquitin ligase and their
  cytoplasmic localization by 14-3-3 proteins. YAP proteins are also regulated independently
  of Hippo signaling, including through phosphorylation of YAP proteins at the same
  sites (NDR1/2, PRP4K) or at different sites (Src, NLK, CDK7) from those targeted
  by LATS1/2, and also by other mechanisms including cytoplasmic sequestration to
  Expanded (Ex) in Drosophila or AMOT in mammals. Active YAP proteins accumulate inside
  the nucleus inducing gene expression by binding with different transcription factors,
  mainly TEADs.
