caption: The recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors drives the activation of dendritic
  cells (DCs) and macrophages. These innate immune cells release prostaglandin E2
  (PGE2) as well as pyrogenic cytokines (namely, interleukin-1 (IL-1) IL-6, and tumour
  necrosis factor (TNF)) that act systemically to induce fever. IL-6 operates downstream
  of IL-1 in the median preoptic nucleus region within the hypothalamus to induce
  the synthesis of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), the enzyme responsible for production
  of additional PGE2., PGE2 is considered the major pyrogenic mediator of fever.–
  Receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) expressed by astrocytes also acts via the COX2–PGE2
  pathway to induce fever. However, it is not known whether this pathway parallels
  the IL-6 response or if the IL-6 and RANKL pathways converge, potentially via IL-6
  regulation of RANKL expression in vascular endothelial cells in the hypothalamus.
  Neurons expressing PGE2 receptor 3 (EP3) trigger the sympathetic nervous system
  to trigger norepinephrine release, which elevates body temperature by increasing
  thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue as well as by inducing vasoconstriction to
  prevent passive heat loss.,,,, Additionally, acetylcholine contributes to fever
  by stimulating muscle myocytes to induce shivering.
