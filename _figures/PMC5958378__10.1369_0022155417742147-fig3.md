caption: 'Proposed functional roles of HSPGs and heparanase during LPS-mediated TLR4
  activation. (A) HS chains connected to core proteins in the ECM exert an inhibitory
  effect on TLR4 activation by LPS, potentially through direct contact with the receptor
  or alternatively by binding TLR4 inhibitors (left panel). In combination with an
  inflammatory insult, protease and heparanase expression increases, and remodels
  the ECM such that both the HSPG core protein and its HS chains are fragmented, which
  releases its inhibition on TLR4 and permits its activation by LPS (right panel).
  (B) HSPGs on the surface of murine peritoneal macrophages impair the TLR4 response
  to LPS (left panel), heparanase treatment releases this HS-dependent inhibition
  and increases sensitization to LPS as evidenced by an increase in TNFα release (right
  panel). (C). Heparanase, acting independently of its ability to fragment HS, can
  activate the NFκB pathway in a manner that is likely dependent on TLR4 at the surface
  of macrophages. (D). Microglial HSPGs facilitate the CD14-dependent activation of
  TLR4 in response to LPS, promoting the release of IL1β and TNFα (left panel), transgenic
  heparanase overexpression fragments microglial HS and impairs the inflammatory response
  to LPS (right panel). This model is adapted from O’Callaghan et al. Abbreviations:
  HSPGs, heparan sulfate proteoglycans; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR4, toll-like receptor
  4; HS, heparan sulfate; ECM, extracellular matrix; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α;
  NFκB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; IL1β, interleukin-1β.'
