caption: Secretion of cyctokines and chemokines by the tumor cells plays a strong
  role in the tumor’s ability to escape the immune system. For example, secretion
  of TGF-β inhibits maturation of CTLs, as do regulatory T cells, while IL-13 directly
  promotes the growth and survival of HD cell lines. TARC and IL-10 negatively effect
  CTL and APC activity, leading to unregulated growth of HD tumor cells. CD30 shed
  by HRS cells intereferes between lymphocytes, cytokines and APCs. Activation of
  FasL pathway by HD tumor cells is a mechanism by which tumors expressing FasL escape
  destruction by the immune system. Secretion of PGE2 by monocytes in HD patients
  upregulates IDO, leading to tryptophan depletion, which is regarded as a defense
  mechanism induced by IFN-γ, thereby suppressing T-cell proliferation.
