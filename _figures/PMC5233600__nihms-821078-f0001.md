caption: B. abortus PAMPs trigger MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in a MyD88 and
  IRAK-4-dependent manner which is important in the induction of the first signal
  and generate inactive form of pro-IL-1β. B. abortus ensures its survival by forming
  the Brucella-containing vacuole (BCV), which traffics along the endocytic pathway.
  It is believed that DNA can be released by the type IV secretion system or by the
  action of GBPs. GBPs mediate bacterial killing resulting in abundant release of
  bacterial DNA for recognition by AIM2. The released bacterial DNA is then sensed
  by the cytosolic AIM2 inflammasome. In parallel, infection of host cells with B.
  abortus can generate ER stress and consequent activation of the sensor IRE1. This
  sensor induces an increase in mitochondrial ROS and culminates in the release of
  mitochondrial DAMPs. NLRP3 and AIM2 activation triggers assembly of inflammasomes
  containing ASC and caspase-1, leading to pro-IL-1β processing and secretion of mature
  IL-1β.
