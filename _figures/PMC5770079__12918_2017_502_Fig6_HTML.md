caption: 'The apoptosis signaling pathway. It mainly involves four parts: the death
  receptor-induced pathway, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated pathway, TP53-dependent
  pathway, as well as the mitochondrial pathway. Stimulated by death ligands (e.g.
  TNFα), the death receptors recruit adaptor proteins and then activate the mitochondrial
  pathway or directly induce apoptosis by caspase 8. ER stress promotes apoptosis
  by ER sensors of IRE1α and EIF2AK3, or release of Ca2+ through IP3R1 channel. TP53
  plays an important role in apoptosis by activating the transcription of pro-apoptotic
  proteins (e.g. BAX) while inhibiting the transcription of anti-apoptotic proteins
  (e.g. BCL2). In mitochondria, activated BAX stimulates the release of cytochrome
  c, and eventually triggers the caspase cascades'
