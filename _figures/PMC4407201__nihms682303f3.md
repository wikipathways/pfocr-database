caption: Golgi defects may contribute to AD disease development. APP expression and
  processing cause Aβ accumulation when BACE1 activity is increased or Aβ clearance
  is decreased (1), which induces Golgi fragmentation through modification of GRASP65
  and other Golgi structural proteins (2), which in turn increases Aβ production by
  enhancing amyloidogenic cleavage (3). This deleterious feedback loop would impair
  the integrity of the secretory pathway for sorting, trafficking and modifications
  of many essential proteins (4), which may compromise neuronal function, activate
  inflammatory responses, or cause neuronal cell death (5). Therefore, rescue of Golgi
  structure may reduce Aβ production and delay AD development (6) (adapted and modified
  from []).
