caption: 'A: Co-expression network analysis of lncRNAs and their target genes in plant
  hormone signal transduction pathways. B-F: Co-expressed lncRNAs and their target
  genes involved in plant hormone signal transduction pathways. In the rectangular
  box are the lncRNAs involved in the predicted target genes. The upward arrow represents
  the positive regulation of DEGs by DELs, while the downward arrow represents the
  negative regulation of DEGs by DELs'
