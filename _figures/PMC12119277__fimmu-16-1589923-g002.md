caption: 'Mechanism of neutrophil apoptosis. This figure depicts both the extrinsic
  and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway, death receptors are
  triggered by external lethal signals, resulting in the activation of pro-caspase-8,
  which is then converted into active caspase-8. Activated caspase-8, on one hand,
  directly activates caspase-3, and on the other hand, cleaves BID protein into tBID.
  Simultaneously, NADPH oxidase is activated to generate ROS, which further activate
  caspase-3 and CAD. In the intrinsic pathway, intrinsic lethal stimuli activate BH3-only
  proteins, a process which is inhibited by BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL1. BH3-only proteins
  activate BAX and BAK, resulting in MOMP and the release of cytochrome C. The released
  cytochrome C binds to APAF1, forming the apoptosome, which then activates procaspase-9
  into caspase-9. This process is inhibited by XIAP, while SMAC counteracts XIAP.
  Ultimately, caspase-9 activates caspase-3, triggering apoptosis. Both pathways ultimately
  execute the apoptosis program through the activation of effector caspase-3, illustrating
  the complex regulatory network of the apoptosis signaling pathway. CAD: Caspase-activated
  DNase; ROS, Reactive oxygen species; XIAP, X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein;
  tBID, truncated BID; ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential; APAF1, Apoptotic protease
  activating factor 1; MOMP, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; SMAC,
  Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases. This Figure adapted from Ona
