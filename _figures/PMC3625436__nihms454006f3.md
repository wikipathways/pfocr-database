caption: Proposed mechanism of altered glucose homeostasis leading to changes in gene
  expression. When excess glucose is presented to hearts under certain environmental
  stressors (pressure overload, unloading, ischemia, diabetes), glucose homeostasis
  is altered. Excess glucose enters the glycolytic pathway, but it also may be stored
  as glycogen or shunted into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway leading to protein
  glycosylation of transcription factors, inducing the return to the fetal gene program
  to protect the heart. (Modified from Young et al.)
