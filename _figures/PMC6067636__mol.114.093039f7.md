caption: Proposed model for the modulation of ethanol-induced Nox2 expression by globular
  adiponectin and its potential role in the suppression of ethanol-induced ROS production
  in macrophages. Ethanol treatment induces increase in ROS production in murine macrophages
  via NADPH oxidase activation, which is composed of various cytosolic and membrane
  subunits. Ethanol-induced NADPH oxidase activation is accompanied with Nox2 expression
  through the p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathway. Globular adiponectin treatment results in prevention
  of ROS production induced by ethanol treatment. The inhibitory effect of gAcrp on
  ethanol-induced ROS production is mediated by modulation of NADPH oxidase, particularly
  via inhibition of Nox2 expression. Abrogation of ethanol-induced Nox2 expression
  by globular adiponectin is mediated through LKB1/AMPK axis signaling mechanisms.
  LKB1 and AMPK signaling pathway reverted ethanol-induced Nox2 expression, probably
  via negative regulation of transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Detailed mechanisms
  underlying inhibition of NF-κB signaling by LKB1/AMPK axis remain to be determined.
