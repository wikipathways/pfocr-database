caption: Schematic representation of the activation of the polyol pathway contributing
  to the development of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Final products
  of the activation are marked on the figure (marked in orange color), while all of
  them represent complications of diabetes (marked in red color). In conditions of
  hyperglycemia, excess glucose is converted to sorbitol with the help of the enzyme
  aldose reductase, which is then further converted to fructose with the help of the
  en-zyme sorbitol dehydrogenase. Fructose, as the end product of this metabolic pathway,
  contributes to the increased synthesis of (AGEs). In the polyol pathway, the conversion
  of glucose to sorbitol and fructose, along with the increase in NADH levels, leads
  to a reduction in NADPH levels, which lowers the production of glutathione, a key
  antioxidant, thereby increasing oxidative stress. Addi-tionally, the activity of
  sorbitol dehydrogenase leads to an increase in NADH levels, which, through glycerol-3-phosphate,
  results in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). NADPH, nico-tinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate; NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; AGEs, ad-vanced
