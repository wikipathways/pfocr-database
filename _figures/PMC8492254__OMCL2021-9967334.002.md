caption: Main pathways of mycotoxin-induced neurotoxicity in astrocytes and microglia.
  Mycotoxins could cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and activated astrocytes and
  microglia. Mycotoxins stimulate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), lead to mitochondrial dysfunction (decrease
  of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increase the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, ATP
  depletion, and Ca2+ overload), DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. The
  activation of the p53 pathway, MAPK pathway, JAK/STAT pathway, and AKT pathway is
  involved in mycotoxin-induced apoptosis. In addition, mycotoxin can directly induce
  necrocytosis.
