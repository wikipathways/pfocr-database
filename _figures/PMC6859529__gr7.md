caption: Redox regulation of IRE1α to control UPR. (A) Under physiological condition,
  the Cyst148 of IRE1α forms an intermolecular disulfide bond with PDIA6 and is therefore
  kept in an inactive state. PDIA6 can also form a complex with BiP by non-covalent
  bonding to catalyze the oxidative protein folding. Under ER stress, IRE1α forms
  tetramers through disulfide bonds and is auto-phosphorylated, activating downstream
  signals. (B) IRE1α is able to sense the level of ROS in the ER or cytoplasm. Under
  oxidative stress, Cys715 that locates in the cytoplasmic region of IRE1α is sulfenylated
  by ROS (generated from NOXs, ER as well as mitochondria), thus activating the MAPK
  pathway to initiate NRF2-mediated antioxidant system, meanwhile inhibiting the UPR-initiating
  function of IRE1α.
