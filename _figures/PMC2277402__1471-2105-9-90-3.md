caption: 'Pheromone response pathway in yeast: the Petri net model. Tables listing
  the meaning of the places and transitions are given as additional material [see
  Additional file ]. The t-invariants are graphically represented using the color
  code of the respective t-clusters (see Figures 4 and 5). Transitions, which are
  only included in some of the t-invariants of a given t-cluster, are marked by colored
  numbers. These numbers correspond to the ID of those t-invariants in which the transition
  is included. The transitions characterizing a given t-cluster (i.e. those transitions
  that participate exactly in all t-invariants of the t-cluster) are framed in the
  color of the respective t-cluster, and the biological meaning of each of these transition
  sets is denoted.'
