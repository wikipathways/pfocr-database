caption: The mechanistic role of NF-κB in the mRNA oncogenic phenotype induced by
  bile reflux in hypopharyngeal carcinogenesis. Acidic bile induces constitutive activation
  of NF-κB via TNF-α, EGFR or TLR, which promotes the transcriptional activation of
  genes with inflammatory, anti-apoptotic or oncogenic function, such as IL6, IL1β,
  TNF-α, BCL2L1, EGFR, cREL, STAT3, ΔNp63 and WNT5A. Activation of NF-κB under acidic
  bile exposure also induces overexpression of AKT1, suggesting acidic bile may contribute
  to the PI3K/AKT1 downstream pathway, which is frequently activated in HNSCC. In
  addition, NF-κB is able to upregulate the expression of PTGS2 (COX-2), supporting
  its regulatory role in inflammatory and cancer-related downstream signaling pathways.
  Finally, acidic bile-induced NF-κB activation may prevent the upregulation of wild-type
  TP53 expression.
