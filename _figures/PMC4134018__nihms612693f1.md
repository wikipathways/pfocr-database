caption: Coxiella burnetii binds to macrophages through αVβ3 integrin, which triggers
  phagocytosis of the bacterium through an actin-dependent mechanism. The nascent
  Coxiella-containing vacuole (CCV) acquires RAB5 and EEA1 as early as 5 minutes after
  internalization and acidifies to approximately pH 5.4, which is characteristic of
  normal phagosomal development. By contrast to phagosomes, the CCV also acquires
  microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 (LC3; an autophagosomal marker), a
  process that is dependent on bacterial protein synthesis. The nascent CCV develops
  through fusion and fission events with early endosomes and then late endosomes,
  leading to the disappearance of RAB5 and EEA1 and the acquisition of RAB7 and lysosome-associated
  membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1) 40 to 60 minutes after internalization, in concurrence
  with a further acidification to pH 5, which is characteristic of normal phagosomal
  development. Lysosomal enzymes, including cathepsin D (CTSD), start accumulating
  in the CCV by 2 hours after internalization, at which point the vacuole is at ~pH
  4.5; this is delayed significantly from normal phagolysosomal acquisition of CTSD.
  This pause in CCV development might allow conversion of the bacteria from small
  cell variants (SCVs) to the metabolically active large cell variants (LCVs). Between
  8 hours and 2 days after internalization, the CCV expands to occupy an increasingly
  dominant portion of the cytoplasmic space of the host cell. This process is dependent
  on bacterial protein synthesis and involves the recruitment of both RHO GTPase and
  RAB1B to the CCV membrane. RHO GTPase is likely to be involved in maintenance of
  the large vacuole, whereas the recruitment of RAB1B from the ER might facilitate
  the acquisition of additional membranes to create this spacious CCV.
