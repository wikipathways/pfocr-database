caption: Progression and environmental sensitivity of C. elegans vulval cell fate
  patterning. (A) A subset of six Pn.p cells (P3.p to P8.p) acquires competence to
  form vulval tissue through the expression of LIN-39; however, usually only P5.p,
  P6.p and P7.p adopt vulval cell fates in a stereotypical 2°-1°-2° pattern. The remaining
  competent cells, P4.p and P8.p, adopt a non-vulval 3° fate, while P3.p may either
  adopt a 3° fate or a 4° fate, also referred to as F(fused) fate. The induction of
  vulval cell fates is generated by the cross-talk of EGF-Ras-MAPK and Delta-Notch
  signaling pathways. Distinct vulval cell divisions according to cell fate occur
  during the L3 stage and generate 22 vulval cells. (B) The anchor cell (AC) releases
  the LIN-3 inductive signal. LIN-3 acts as a morphogen, with P6.p receiving the highest
  level of LIN-3 causing it to adopt a 1° Cell fate (blue). The expression of the
  Delta ligands in P6.p activates the Delta-Notch pathway in its neighbors, P5.p and
  P7.p. This activation causes them to adopt a 2° fate (red) and represses the primary
  fate. A switch from the canonical LET-60/Ras-LIN-45/Raf pathway to a LET-60/Ras-RGL-1-RAL-1
  signaling pathway can also promote the 2° Cell fate in P5.p and P7.p (not detailed).
  (C) Schematic representation of previously reported environmental and physiological
  inputs affecting C. elegans vulval induction (for details, see introduction). For
  effects of high temperature on vulval induction, note that  found that 25°C culture
  had a positive effect on vulval induction (e.g., suppression of diverse Vul mutants)
  whereas  found that 30°C consistently caused hypoinduced wild type animals.
