caption: At left, the pathogenic autoantibody pathway can involve autoantigens, which
  in health are primarily sequestered in the nucleus. In murine lupus models, these
  IgG2a autoantibodies are made under Th1-biased autoimmune responses. These immune
  complexes can trigger activating FcγR, which causes internalization followed by
  interactions with the stimulatory TLR7 and TLR9 otherwise sequestered within intracellular
  compartments. At right, the opposing pro-homeostatic anti-ACM antibodies, which
  are present in the circulation from birth, inhibit the pro-inflammatory influences
  of TLR ligands, as well as the activating activity of pathogenic lupus autoantibodies
  to DNA and RNA Abs. A depiction of C1q is shown, while MBL may play similar or overlapping
  roles. C’ R, complement receptor(s); AC R, apoptotic cell receptor(s).
