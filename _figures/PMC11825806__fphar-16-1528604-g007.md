caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the effects of targeted activation of ErbB4
  receptor on neuronal aging via ferroptosis inhibition. Small molecule agonist (E4A)can
  activate ErbB4 receptors and regulate the Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway to achieve
  neuroprotective effect in D-gal-induced neuronal aging. D-gal treatment increases
  the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which stimulates the
  production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increase the expression of senescence
  marker genes P53, P16, and P21. E4A can promote Akt1 phosphorylation and promote
  Nrf2 entrance into the nucleus, in which it involves in regulating the expression
  of ferroptosis suppressor gene, such as SLC7A11 and GPX4 to attenuate lipid peroxidation,
  which can inhibit cell ferroptosis and neuronal aging. The diagram was created with
