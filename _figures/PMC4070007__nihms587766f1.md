caption: A simplified diagram of the TLR-mediated and interferon (IFN)-mediated immunity
  in response to viruses. TLR3 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in
  endosomes, where it recognizes double-stranded RNA produced during the replication
  of most viruses. Activation of TLR3 induces activation of IRF-3 and NF- κ B via
  the TRIF adaptor, and the production of IFN-α/β and/or - λ. UNC-93B is required
  for the trafficking of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 from the ER to the endosomal compartment.
  Proteins of the TLR3 pathway for which genetic mutation have been identified and
  associated with susceptibility to Herpes simplex virus-1 encephalitis (TLR3, TRIF,
  UNC-93B, TRAF3 and TBK1) are depicted in blue.
