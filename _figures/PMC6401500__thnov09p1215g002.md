caption: 'Activation of NF-κB in ITME. Radiation can induce NF-κB activation in both
  tumor and stromal cells including immune cells in ITME. The subunits RelA (p65),
  c-Rel, RelB, p105/p50, and p100/p52 can form active homo- or hetero- dimeric complex
  and activated by the canonical and non-canonical pathway , . Radiation-induced NF-κB
  is mainly via canonical pathway that is divided into two categories: IKK-dependent
  or IKK-independent. The IκB is degraded upon phosphorylation by IKK which relocates
  NF-κB dimer (p50/p65) to nucleus for transcription of radiation-target genes including
  RAAPs such as CD47, HER2, and PD-1/PD-L1. UV or hypoxia activates NF-κB via IKK-independent
  phosphorylation of IκB in which RelB/p52 is activated via metabolism of p100. On
  the other hand, radiation-induced DNA damage activates nuclear ATM that also enhances
  NF-κB via regulation of IKK activity , , . The reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced
  by radiation triggers the NF-κB signaling in cytoplasm by IKK complex phosphorylation
  , while inhibits NF-κB signaling via oxidation of IKKɣ in cytoplasm or oxidation
  of p50 in nucleus. The canonical pathway impacts various biological processes, including
  immune response, inflammation, and cell growth and survival. The non-canonical pathway
  regulates important biological functions, including lymphoid organogenesis, B-cell
  maturation and DC activation.'
