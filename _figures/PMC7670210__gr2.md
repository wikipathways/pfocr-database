caption: A model of the hepatocyte response to MC exposure. MC initiate the production
  of ROS, resulting in the accumulation of mis and non-folded proteins in the lumen
  of the ER. Accumulation of these proteins results in ER stress and initiation of
  all three arms of the UPR. Depending on the severity of the MC exposure cellular
  fate is ultimately decided by the kinetics of JNK activation. Sustained JNK activation
  leads to PERK/CHOP mediated apoptosis via both the mitochondrial and DR pathway.
  Lower levels of MC exposure result in the upregulation of NF-κB which initiates
  a pro-survival/inflammatory response that inhibits sustained JNK activation.
