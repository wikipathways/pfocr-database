caption: APC forms three distinct complexes in endothelial cells. APC localizes to
  in punctate clusters at membrane extensions, where microtubule (MT) plus ends are
  focused, and at the lateral plasma membrane with actin and cell–cell adhesion proteins.
  These two populations of APC comprise three distinct molecular complexes. Clusters,
  which promote directed cell migration, are comprised of GSK3β/CKI-P-APC (APCP) and
  GSK3β/CKI-P-βcat (βcatP) and are turned over rapidly through the proteasome. At
  the lateral membrane, GSK3β/CKI-P-APC and GSK3β/CKI-P-βcat associate separately
  from adherens junction complex and may be degraded in part by a nonproteasomal pathway,
  whereas non-GSK3β/CKI-phosphorylated complexes of APC and β-catenin are relatively
  stable. GSK3β/CKI-P-APC and GSK3β/CKI-P-βcat can relocalize from the lateral membrane
  into clusters upon disruption of cell–cell adhesion.
