caption: Schematic of the nigrostriatal pathway in relation to the basic circuitry
  of the basal ganglia. Dopaminergic neurons of the SN pars compacta and corticostriatal
  glutamatergic neurons converge on the medium spiny neurons of the striatum. These
  are the principal output neurons of the “direct” (D) or “indirect” (I) pathways.
  The direct pathway (heavy shaded lines) projects directly to the entopeduncular
  nucleus (EPN; internal segment of the globus pallidus in primates) or the SN pars
  reticulata (SNr), and thence to the thalamus or brain stem, respectively. The indirect
  pathway (heavy dashed shaded lines) makes synaptic connections in the globus pallidus
  (GP; external segment of the globus pallidus in primates) and subthalamic nucleus
  (STN) en route to the EPN and SNr. Some additional connections are shown as dotted
  lines. See  for details.
