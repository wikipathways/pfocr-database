caption: Mechanisms of incretin hormones’ effect on bone. The body’s response to food
  affects bone metabolism. First, the elevation of blood glucose levels subsequent
  to a meal stimulates the secretion of insulin, which in turn exerts its influence
  upon osteoclasts and triggers a reduction in bone resorption. More importantly,
  eating stimulates the secretion of incretin hormones from the intestine. Under the
  stimulation of nutrients, GLP-1, GLP-2, GIP, and PYY are secreted from the intestines
  and reach the bone through the blood circulation. Among them, GLP-1, GLP-2, and
  GIP bind to homologous receptors in osteoclasts, causing a decrease in the number
  of osteoclasts and a decrease in the osteoclast markers, CTX-Ⅰ, and the ratio of
  OPG/RANKL, and a decrease in PTH-induced bone resorption. On the other hand, GLP-1,
  GLP-2, GIP, and PYY act on homologous receptors in osteoblasts, activating intracellular
  MAPK, PKA, and PI3K pathways, promoting osteoblast proliferation and differentiation
  and mineralization, with elevated osteogenic markers P1NP and OCN (except for PYY)
  leading to osteogenic effects. Notably, the SCFAs produced by the GM also promote
  the secretion of GLP-1 and GLP-2, leading to increased bone formation. Overall,
  the osteogenic effect of gut hormones is greater than the osteoclastic effect, leading
  to increased bone formation
