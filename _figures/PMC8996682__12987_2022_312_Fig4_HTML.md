caption: Reaction of pericytes to SAH. Pericytes are in direct communication with
  ECs, and thus, pericyte contraction in response to SAH can alter BBB integrity.
  Pericytes are exposed to high concentrations of Hb and other substances such as
  ET-1, AT2, 20- 20-HETE, TX2, and ATP present in the CSF after SAH that have a predominant
  constrictor effect. CypA release, caused by Hb, and ROS, can activate CD147, which
  activates the NF-κB pathway, causing increased expression of MMP-9 and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-6 and TGF-β, as well as upregulation of adhesion molecules
  (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1). MMP-9 is also upregulated via activation of PAR1/4 by Tb. Upregulation
  of MMP-9 and elevated cytokines results in the degradation of basal lamina and TJ
  proteins, thus increasing BBB permeability, allowing leukocyte penetration into
  the CNS
