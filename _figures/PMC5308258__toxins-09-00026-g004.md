caption: A tissue metabolic crosstalk hypothesis. CBS and CSE are reported to be differentially
  expressed in organs and tissues, thus allowing transsulfuration to be carried out
  preferentially, but not exclusively, in the liver, while H2S biosynthesis may be
  performed by a number of other cell types. In this respect, it has been shown that,
  in the liver, CBS protein levels are significantly lower than those of CSE, while
  both these enzymes are more abundant in the liver than at the kidney level []. So
  the hypothesis of a metabolic crosstalk depends on the reported non-ubiquitous expression
  of either CBS or CSE in various organs, leading to the suggestion that the transsulfuration
  pathway is incomplete in some tissues, where only CBS or CSE are prevalently expressed.
  Cysteine, the main product of transsulfuration may be mainly produced where transsulfuration
  is fully active, while its utilization occurs at many other levels even where this
  pathway cannot take place (e.g., RBC). Cysteine is a building block for glutathione
  biosynthesis, or it is the major substrate for H2S, carried out by both CBS and
  CSE independently, even in the tissues where only CSE is significantly expressed,
  yielding lanthionine as the main product. Evidence supports that lanthionine is
  a retention product during chronic renal failure, despite low levels of H2S being
  detected in these patients []. On the other hand, homocysteine, an obligate metabolic
  intermediate in the conversion of methionine into cysteine and a major demethylated
  product of transmethylation reactions, can be further metabolized by both transsulfuration
  and H2S biosynthetic reactions. One of the main side products of the latter reaction,
  which can be carried out by both CBS and CSE independently, is homolanthionine (see
  also  and ). It should be remarked, however, that, in contrast with previous observations,
  the transsulfuration pathway has been detected using brain cells and slices, thus
  demonstrating its contribution to the glutathione-dependent redox-buffering capacity
  []. It has also been shown that the endothelium may contribute, as the liver, to
  the homocysteine metabolic process in which the transsulfuration enzymes, CBS and
  CSE, are secreted by microvascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes, circulate
  as members of the plasma proteome, and may actively produce hydrogen sulfide from
  homocysteine in blood []. The latter pathway is possibly impaired in uremia due
  to high lanthionine circulating levels. The illustrated scheme may become more complex
  as new evidence is added which allows us to clarify the quantitative contribution
  of each tissue/organ to the disposal of homocysteine and the formation of cysteine
  or H2S by trassulfuration enzymes. Black letters refer to products, red letters
  refer to substrates; lanthionine is susceptible to quantitative urinary excretion
  (blue); cysteine is both a transsulfuration product and a substrate for H2S biosynthesis
  (purple red).
