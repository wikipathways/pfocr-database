caption: 'Pathways regulating cellular iron metabolism in C. elegans. Iron deficiency-HIF-1
  pathway: this pathway is activated in response to iron deficiency or hypoxia and
  results in HIF-1 dependent repression of ftn-1 and ftn-2 and activation of smf-3.
  This leads to reduced iron storage and increased iron uptake, ultimately increasing
  the cellular iron pool and promoting survival during iron limitation. Insulin/insulin
  growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) pathway: the IIS pathway is a conserved
  pathway in worms, flies and in vertebrates that regulates the transcription factor
  DAF-16/FOXO. DAF-16/FOXO regulates genes in essential processes, such as metabolism,
  stress resistance, pathogen defense and lifespan extension. Activated IIS initiates
  a phosphorylation cascade that leads to the cytoplasmic retention of DAF-16/FOXO
  and inhibits its function. Nutrient deprivation reduces IIS leading to the nuclear
  localization of DAF-16 to activate ftn-1. Glucose upregulates smf-3 expression,
  but whether DAF-16 directly regulates smf-3 remains to be determined. This pathway
  provides a mechanism to increase cellular iron by reducing ftn-1 when nutrients
  are abundant to promote growth and to reduce cellular iron during stress by increasing
  ftn-1 to limit iron-catalyzed oxidative stress.'
