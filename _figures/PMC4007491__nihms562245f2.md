caption: Activation of the Bone Morphogenetic Pathway (BMP) occurs at a gradient that
  is higher in the villi and lower in the crypts. Conversely, Wnt activity is highest
  in the crypts. The Wnt gradient is established by secretion of Wnt ligands both
  from the mesenchymal myofibroblasts (WNT2a) as well as from epithelial cells. WNT3,
  in particular, is expressed in Paneth cells. The Notch signaling pathway is also
  critical for niche specification. Notch ligand presentation must occur from adjacent
  cells, and there is evidence that Paneth cells present DLL4, and that a subset of
  secretory progenitors express DLL1. It is unclear if other TA cell populations can
  present Notch ligand to stem cells.
