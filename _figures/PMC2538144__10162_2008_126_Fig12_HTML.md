caption: Protective mechanisms of flunarizine via Nrf2/HO-1 activation against cisplatin-induced
  auditory cell damages. The scheme shows that flunarizine attenuated cisplatin-induced
  pro-inflammatory cytokine production and thereby induced a cytoprotective effect
  against cisplatin cytotoxicity. Cisplatin induced MAPK and NF-κB activations which
  promoted the expression of pro-inflammatory genes including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6.
  However, flunarizine inhibited the cisplatin-induced MAPKs and NF-κB via the activation
  of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. HC hair cells, SC supporting cells
