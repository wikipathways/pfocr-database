caption: 'Input signals and output responses of the core jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile)
  signaling pathway. Associations of the modular design of JA-Ile signaling with a
  variety of inductive cues (top) and physiological output responses (bottom) are
  shown as a schematic diagram. Inductive signals include biotic stresses (microbe
  and herbivore) and damage related to molecular patterns (MAMPs, microbe-associated;
  HAMPs, herbivore-associated; and DAMPs, damage-associated) arising from damaged
  plant cells, attacking organisms, and abiotic stresses. Pattern recognition receptors
  on the cell surface recognize the signals and resynthesize JA-Ile from plastid lipids.
  The degradation of multiple JAZ proteins (exemplified by JAZx-z) is promoted by
  the activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFCOI1 and the 26S proteasome. Subsequently,
  JAZ-interacting transcription factors (exemplified by TFa–c), which govern diverse
  physiological output responses involved in growth, development, and tolerance to
  biotic and abiotic stresses, are upregulated due to the degradation of JAZ. The
  conserved core pathway may be repurposed to connect other input signals and transcription
  factors. Abbreviations: JA-Ile, jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine; MAMPs, microbe-associated
  molecular patterns; HAMPs, herbivore-associated molecular patterns; DAMPs, damage-associated
  molecular patterns; JAZ, jasmonate ZIM domain; SCF, [kinetochore protein 1 (SKP1)-CULLIN1
  (CUL1)-F-box]; COI1, coronatine insensitive1; TF, transcription factor. Modified
  from [].'
