caption: Induction of various signaling cascades and their interactions under heavy
  metal stress. Schematic diagram showing the heavy metal stress and subsequent oxidative
  damage mediated activation of different interlinked signaling networks, including
  the calmodulin pathway, hormonal and MAP kinase signaling cascades for regulation
  of expression the target stress responsive genes associated with plant response
  for heavy metal stress adaptation. EIN2 – ethylene-insensitive protein 2, ETR1 –
  ethylene receptor 1, ERF – ethylene response factor, SA – salicylic acid, JA – jasmonic
  acid, JAZ – JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN, NPR1 – natriuretic peptide receptor 1. Blunt end
  arrows indicate inhibition.
