caption: High levels of TAGs and DAGs found in SAT compared to VAT. (A) A metabolic
  map of the glycerolipid pathway (). The gene expression of enzymes of the pathway
  as found in the GTEx database is shown as rectangles and the relative lipid accumulation
  found by our lipidomics study in the main data set is shown as circles. (B–D) The
  accumulation of glycerolipid groups found by our lipidomics study. Blue lines represent
  a change of ≥10% in the SAT:VAT ratio. Red lines represent a change of ≤ −10% in
  the SAT:VAT ratio. Black lines represent a similar accumulation ±10%. n = 17; error
  bars represent SEMs; 1-tailed paired t test. DAG, diacylglycerol; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes; SAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue; TAG, triacylglycerol; VAT,
  visceral adipose tissue.
