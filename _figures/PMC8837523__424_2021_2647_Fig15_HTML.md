caption: 'Model: bTRPV3 and bTRPV4 function in rumen. a Schematic representation showing
  the various layers of the ruminal epithelium. Starting from the basolateral side
  at the bottom, the basal lamina (⓪) serves as an attachment point for the cells
  of the stratum basale (①) which are the replicating cells of the epithelium. As
  cells grow upwards, they differentiate into cells of the stratum spinosum (②), stratum
  granulosum (③), and finally stratum corneum (④). Cells of the bottom three layers
  (①, ②, ③) are interconnected by gap junction proteins (⑤), forming a functional
  syncytium across which ions, molecules, and water can be transported. Tight junction
  proteins largely prevent paracellular transport. Cell nuclei (⑥) are in every cell
  of the stratum basale and stratum spinosum. Channel proteins are transcribed from
  mRNA within the endoplasmic reticulum (⑦). After assembly, the channels are incorporated
  into the lipid membrane of vesicles (⑧) for trafficking into the apical membrane
  of the stratum granulosum (⑨). Cells of the stratum corneum are surrounded by a
  protein envelope (shown in black) which displaces the lipid membrane (blue) and
  its now dysfunctional proteins (⑩). In parakeratosis, premature maturation leads
  to reinforced flattening of the cells of the stratum granulosum, often with loss
  of the endoplasmic reticulum and cell nuclei, while cells from the stratum corneum
  show residual cell nuclei and frequently detach from the underlying layers (⑪).
  In absorptive stratified epithelia, substrates can pass through the paracellular
  pathway between corneocytes to reach the apical membrane of the stratum granulosum
  (⑫). b Simplified transport model of the ruminal epithelium showing the functional
  syncytium between the stratum basale (①) stratum spinosum (②), and stratum granulosum
  (③). The stratum corneum is partially detached (④). SCFA from fermentation processes
  within the rumen supply energy to the animal and serve for carbohydrate anabolism.
  Apical uptake occurs as the anion (SCFA−) via transporters (⑤) or in the undissociated
  form (HSCFA, ⑥). Basolateral efflux involves anion channels or transporters (⑦).
  Dissociation of HSCFA leads to acidification with stimulation of pH regulatory mechanisms
  such as NHE and H+-ATPases (⑧). Following synthesis and assembly in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (⑨), some channels may be required for local functions (e.g. uptake of
  NH4+ for glutamine synthesis), while others are trafficked in vesicles (⑩) to the
  apical membrane of the stratum granulosum. After membrane insertion, bTRPV3 (red,
  ⑪) and bTRPV4 (blue, ⑫) mediate the apical uptake of cations including NH4+ and
  Ca2+. Basolateral efflux of NH4+ probably involves K+ channels (⑬). At the physiological
  pH of the rumen, transport of NH3 plays a minor role, with backflow possible if
  the NH3 gradient is inverted by a low luminal and a high cytosolic pH (⑭). After
  uptake (⑪, ⑫), Ca2+ is transported to the basolateral membrane bound to cytosolic
  buffers (⑮). Basolateral efflux may involve both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent
  mechanisms (⑯). When SCFA concentrations in the rumen are high, changes in cell
  volume (⑰) and cytosolic protons (⑱) open bTRPV4 (⑪) and bTRPV3 (⑫), respectively,
  leading to an increase in the transport of Ca2+ and NH4+ across the rumen as observed
  in vivo and in vitro. Functionally, the coupling of Ca2+ transport via TRP channels
  with proton extrusion may resemble Ca2+/H+ exchange'
