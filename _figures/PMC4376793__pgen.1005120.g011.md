caption: The number of highly differentially expressed genes and represented proteins
  was higher in tick midguts than in salivary glands, suggesting a higher impact of
  bacterial infection in midgut cells probably associated with A. phagocytophilum
  developmental cycle. In tick midguts, A. phagocytophilum inhibited cell apoptosis
  to facilitate and establish infection through up-regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway
  genes. In tick salivary glands, down-regulation of Porin resulted in the inhibition
  of the Cytochrome c release that inhibited the mitochondrially-induced intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway to facilitate bacterial infection. This effect was contrasted
  in part by the induction of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway through the inhibition
  of FAS proteins.
