caption: Schematic of the effects of pictilisib on OS cells and osteoclasts in the
  tumor microenvironment. In brief, pictilisib inhibited proliferation of OS via cell
  cycle arrest rather than induction of cell apoptosis. In addition, pictilisib enhanced
  the sensitivity of OS cells to DOX. Further, tumor-induced osteolysis was effectively
  prevented by pictilisib.
