caption: Schematic representation of the main alterations in TCR signaling pathway
  and accessory molecules associated with autoimmunity/immunodeficiency. The major
  signaling pathways induced by TCR engagement, combined with those derived from CD28
  costimulatory molecule, CTLA-4 inhibitory receptor, the tyrosine phosphatase CD45
  and IL-2R, involved in the control of T cell activation, and establishment of immunological
  self-tolerance. In the gray boxes are listed the alterations/pathological conditions
  associated with dysfunctions of the reported molecules. TCR, T cell receptor
