caption: Top ranking gene network by P‐value from the gene list uploaded from the
  NRI versus Control analysis. Uploaded reference molecules are identified with a
  red circle. The pathway is centered on the CREB1 gene hub with several seed genes
  including the ATF/Creb, Casp6, Slc38a2, and Acta1 genes, interacting directly with
  it and several others one interaction away. Creb has been systematically found to
  be activated by AD treatment and is a key mechanism involved in hippocampal neurogenesis
  and inflammation. A second gene hub based on the uploaded Hdac3 gene was also uncovered.
  Hdac3 inhibitors have been shown to have antidepressant effects in animal models.
