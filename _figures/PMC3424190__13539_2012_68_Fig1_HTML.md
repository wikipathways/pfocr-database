caption: Anabolic stimuli in the form of amino acids, growth factors (insulin, IGF-1),
  and exercise (not shown) act through the mTOR and Akt signaling pathways. mTORC1
  is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of S6K1 and phosphorylation
  and inactivation of 4E-BP1. It results in ribosome biogenesis, increase in translational
  efficiency, and heightened MPS. The energy sensor AMPK inhibits this pathway, and
  is active when the AMP/ATP ratio is high. Growth factor stimulates activation of
  the PI3K pathway as well as mTORC2; both eventually activate Akt, which can inhibit
  stress signaling and apoptosis through inactivation of FOXO1/O3 transcription factors.
  Akt also plays a role in carbohydrate metabolism. P phosphorylation, activation
  or inactivation; PI3K phosphoinositide 3 kinase; Akt protein kinase B; FOXO forkhead
  protein box O; AMPK AMP-activated kinase; 4E-BP1 eIF4E-binding protein 1; S6K1 S6
  kinase 1
