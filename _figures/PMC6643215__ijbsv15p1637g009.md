caption: Schematic diagram summarizing the anti-NSCLC action of butein via activation
  of ER stress and ROS generation. The in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that
  butein triggered ER stress and upregulated p-PERK, p-eIF2α levels and ATF4, CHOP,
  IRE1α, XBP1 expressions. Activation of ER stress further induced oxidative stress,
  indicated by increased ROS concentration, down-regulated SOD2 expression, decreased
  the MMP, decreased GSH and increased NADPH oxidase activity, which contributed to
  cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and inhibition of tumor behaviors. However, administration
  of 4-PBA, CHOP siRNA or NAC partially blocked the anti-NSCLC action of butein. Butein
  also inhibited cell adhesion, migration and invasion, and the underlying mechanisms
  still needs further investigation.
