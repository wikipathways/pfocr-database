caption: Schematic presentation of the signaling pathways for tumor cell growth and
  the resistance mechanism proposed. Mutations in NRAS and BRAF lead to tumor cell
  growth through activating the MEK1/2-ERK pathway. LT and U0126 inhibit MEK1/2 and
  prevent tumor cell growth (solid box). However, the inhibition of MEK1/2 by LT or
  U0126 can lead to an HDAC8-dependent cell proliferation pathway that activates AKT
  through enhancing the PLCB1 expression in a low-DESC1 background (dotted box). The
  inhibition of HDAC8 can lead to the suppression of PLCB1 expression and induction
  of DESC1 expression, both of which cooperatively inhibit AKT activation and a resistance
  to MEK1/2 inhibition.
