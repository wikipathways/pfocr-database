caption: Growth factors or cytokines can stimulate phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI 3-K)
  and the activation of Akt. Once activated, Akt can phosphorylate tuberous sclerosis
  complex-2 (TSC2) on serine939 (S939), serine981(S981), and threonine1462 (T1462),
  resulting in the disruption of its interaction with TSC1, the loss of its ability
  to convert of Ras homologue enriched in brain active form (Rheb-GTP) to the inactive
  form (Rheb-GDP), and the subsequent activation of mTORC1. Akt also can activate
  IκB kinase-β (IKKβ) to phosphorylate TSC1 on serine487 (S487) and serine511 (S511)
  leading to the inhibition of the TSC1/TSC2 complex and activation of mTORC1. In
  the pathway involving extracellular signal related kinase (ERK), ERK is activated
  following Ras activation of mitogen activated kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) and phosphorylates
  TSC2 on serine644 (S664). Nutrient deficiency reduces cellular ATP levels and stimulates
  AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) that can phosphorylate TSC2 on serine1345 (S1345)
  promoting its GTPase activating protein activity and turning Rheb-GTP into Rheb-GDP.
  As a result, mTORC1 activity is inhibited. AMPK also can increase the expression
  of transcriptional regulation of DNA damage response 1 (REDD1), releasing TSC2 from
  the binding to protein 14-3-3 and inhibit mTORC1 activity. The tumor suppressor
  liver kinase B1 (LKB1) can activate AMPK through phosphorylation under conditions
  of cellular energy deficiency. In addition, the tumor suppressor p53 has been demonstrated
  to activate AMPK under oxidative and genotoxic stress through its two target genes,
  sestrin 1 and sestrin 2. The glycoprotein Wnt phosphorylates glycogen synthase-3β
  (GSK-3β) resulting in the loss of the ability of GSK-3β to phosphorylate TSC2 on
  serine1337 (S1337) and serine1341 (S1341). Upon activation, mTORC1 phosphorylates
  its two major downstream targets p70 ribosome S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1). (p = phosphorylation).
