caption: Irradiated ECs differentially expressed proteins after X-ray exposure involved
  in caveolar-mediated endocytosis and cell-cell adhesion. Arborescence diagram indicates
  caveolar-mediated endocytosis signaling and cell-cell adhesion pathways with the
  identified upregulated genes indicated in green and downregulated genes in red.
  Pathway diagram was adapted from Wikipathways and modified with Pathvisio. Changes
  are shown compared to gene expression in sham irradiated cells (N = 3, n = 12).
