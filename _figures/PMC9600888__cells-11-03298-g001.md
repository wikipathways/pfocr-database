caption: (a) Schematic illustration of IONP-promoted osteogenic differentiation in
  osteoblasts and stem cells. Classical Wnt/β-catenin, Akt-GSK-3β-β-catenin, MAPK,
  and BMP-2/Smad signaling pathways are activated by IONPs. Thus, osteoblastogenesis-related
  gene transcription downstream is markedly promoted, leading to enhancement of osteogenic
  differentiation. (b) Schematic illustration of IONP-attenuated osteoclastogenesis
  in BMMs. IONPs upregulated p62 expression by increasing the binding of CYLD to the
  TRAF6–p62–CYLD complex, resulting in repressive ubiquitination of TRAF6 and inhibition
  of RANKL-induced signaling pathway such as NF-κB and MAPK signals. As a result,
  transcription of osteoclastogenesis-related genes was obviously blocked, leading
  to blockage of osteoclastogenesis.
