caption: JNK signalling in hepatic steatosis. Increased levels of fatty acids lead
  to activating the JNK pathway through the phosphorylation of MKK4/7 by several kinases
  (ASK1, GSK-3, and MLK3). Fructose can activate JNK and induce ER stress through
  IRE1α. This activation is a driver of insulin resistance by direct phosphorylation
  of IRS-1. JNK also promotes caspase-induced apoptosis via Bax/PUMA-Bim signalling,
  which can activate JNK. Finally, JNK inhibits the PPARα pathway by activating NCor1,
  leading to reduced levels of β oxidation, ketogenesis, and peroxisomal lipid oxidation.
  The decreases in insulin sensitivity, lipid oxidation, and ketogenesis, together
  with the increased apoptosis, drive hepatic steatosis.
