caption: In this pathway, the endogenous yeast GPCR, Ste2 was knocked out and replaced
  with a nematode OR (ODR-10), which induces signalling when activated by its ligand
  diacetyl. As nematode Gα subunits (ODR-3 and GPA-3) have low affinity for the yeast
  Gβγ, Gpa1/ODR-3 and Gpa1/GPA-3 chimaeras have been developed to incorporate receptor-binding
  properties of nematode subunits into the Gpa1 subunit that interacts with the yeast
  signalling machinery. Gene disruption was used to knock out SST2 (to enhance signalling)
  and FAR1 (to prevent cell cycle arrest). Signal activation was monitored by transforming
  lacZ reporter under FIG2 promoter.
