caption: A tonic pattern of motor nerve activity promotes changes in intracellular
  calcium that trigger a variety of intracellular events that modify the function
  of nuclear transcription factors. The pathway transduced by calcineurin and NFAT
  is highlighted in larger type. Other signals are received by cell surface receptors
  to activate similar or parallel signaling events. Signaling proteins that participate
  in transducing effects of contractile activity to specific genes include ion channels
  (TRP), scaffolding proteins (Homer), protein phosphatases and protein kinases (calcineurin,
  CAMK, p38MAPK), DNA-binding transcription factors (shown in red; NFAT, MEF2, PGC-1,
  ATF2), and endogenous inhibitors (shown in blue; GSK3, HDAC, and MCIP) (inhibitors
  antagonize gene activation via the pathways indicated, in some cases acting as negative
  feedback regulators).
