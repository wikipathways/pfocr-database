caption: Activation of JAK/STAT5 signalling. (a) Upon the binding of ligands (e.g.,
  cytokines) to their respective receptors, the receptors dimerise, allowing JAKs
  to phosphorylate each other as well as the receptor. Free STAT5 monomers in the
  cytosol are recruited to the receptor and are phosphorylated on their tyrosine residue
  by JAKs. (b) Phosphorylated STAT5 dimerises; the SH2 domain of one STAT5 interacts
  with the phospho-tyrosine (pY) region of the reciprocal STAT5. (c) The STAT5 dimer
  translocates into the nucleus and binds to interferon gamma activated sited (GAS)
  elements, recruiting cofactors, such as bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET)
  family proteins, to regulate the transcription of its target genes, for example
  cyclin D and the serine/threonine kinase Pim-1. (d) Negative regulators of the JAK/STAT5
  pathway, tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) and
  protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS), could modulate the activation of the
  pathway.
