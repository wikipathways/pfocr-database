caption: Schematic diagram of the molecular mechanisms of discoidin domain receptors
  (DDR1/DDR2) in the activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and progression
  of pancreatic fibrosis. During pancreatic injury, release of variety of inflammatory
  mediators and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β promotes the upregulation of expression
  of DDR1 and DDR2, which results in the activation of TGF-β1 downstream pathway and
  NF-κB signaling, consequently leading to excessive ECM deposition and pancreatic
  fibrosis. Moreover, IMT produced its protective effects by inhibiting DDR1/DDR2
  signaling pathways in CP and associated fibrosis.
