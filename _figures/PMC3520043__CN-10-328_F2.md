caption: 'Assumed role of mitochondria, Ca2+, and ROS in neuronal excitotoxicity and
  epileptogenesis. After increase of mitochondrial Ca2+ inﬂux, mediated by various
  mechanisms, the generation of both ROS and RNS elicit downstream cell death signalling.
  The Ca2+ passage can lead to propagation and ampliﬁcation of mitochondrial Ca2+
  overload. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is shown with complexes I, II, III,
  IV, and V. ROS and RNS can react with thiol groups (-SH) and subsequently cause
  opening of the MTP pore and Bax pore. One of the consequences is release of cyt-c
  across the outer membrane, which is the major initiation step in a cascade reaction
  of cell apoptosis. The cell death pathway may switch between apoptosis and necrosis,
  in relation to the intracellular ATP availability.Symbols legend:Ac-CoA: Acetyl
