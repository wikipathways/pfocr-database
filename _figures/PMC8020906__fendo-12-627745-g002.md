caption: 'mTOR is activated by growth factors via PI3K-Akt and RAS/MAPK pathways.
  The phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 biphosphate (PIP2) is catalyzed
  by PI3K producing PIP3. Once PIP3 is formed, it induces the recruitment of proteins
  with PH domain such as PDK1, Akt, and mTORC2 complex, facilitating Akt-Thr308 and
  Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation by PDK1 and mTORC2, respectively. Activated Akt inhibits
  the TSC complex and promotes mTORC1 activation by Rheb-binding. The Ras/AMPK pathway
  can regulate both mTOR complexes via the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade. Activated
  ERK inhibits the TSC complex by direct phosphorylation, and Ras-GTP can bind to
  mTORC2, increasing its kinase activity. mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids
  can be dependent or independent on Rag GTPases. Also, mTORC1 can control its own
  activation and mTORC2 activity. mTORC2 is negatively regulated by mTORC1-S6K1 that
  phosphorylates mSN1 and Rictor. The arrows indicate: →, activation signals; ┴, inhibition
  signals; → pathway activators.'
