caption: Model to illustrate the role of MAPK signaling in mediating Mos mRNA polyadenylation.
  Progesterone stimulation of immature oocytes induces Mos mRNA polyadenylation. The
  initial progesterone-stimulated signaling mechanism that “triggers” Mos mRNA polyadenylation
  remains to be determined. Mos mRNA translation would then result in MEK and MAPK
  activation. We propose that activation of MAPK signaling stimulates Mos mRNA polyadenylation,
  resulting in positive feedback (bold arrow) while independently inducing MPF activation.
  Since MPF is not able to stimulate Mos mRNA polyadenylation in the absence of MAPK
  signaling, we have positioned MPF outside the MAPK-Mos mRNA polyadenylation feedback
  loop. MPF may functionally synergize with the feedback loop by acting to stabilize
  newly synthesized Mos protein () (dashed line), although this requirement can be
  overcome under conditions of robust MAPK activation (Fig. ). MPF in turn, can induce
  the polyadenylation of additional maternal mRNAs (), including cyclin B1.
