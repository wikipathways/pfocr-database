caption: 'A signaling map and mechanistic map of the Sfrp5/Wnt signaling pathway in
  ASCVD. (A) The signaling map of the Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt ligands signal through
  3 major pathways. In the canonical Wnt/β-catenin (pathway A), certain Wnts interact
  with specific Fzs in complex with LRP5/6 to activate the pivotal protein Dvl. Dvl
  inhibits phosphorylation of cytoplasmic β-catenin by a complex including glycogen
  synthase kinase-3β, adenomatous polyposis coli protein, and axin. In its nonphosphorylated
  state, β-catenin is no longer targeted for degradation. The accumulation of β-catenin
  (transferring from the cytoplasm to the nucleus) commits to the transcription of
  the target genes in the downstream (such as PPAR-γ, C/EBPα, VEGF, T cell factor-4,
  and BMP2) via the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor promotor. In the noncanonical
  Wnt/Ca2+ (pathway B), Wnt signals through Fz, again in the absence of LRP5/6, activate
  G-protein and phospholipase C and lead to raised intracellular Ca2+levels and activation
  of PKC. The activation of PKC commits to the transcription of the target genes in
  the downstream (such as IL-6, IL-4, and fibronectin) via the nuclear factor of activated
  T cells promotor. In turn, Ca2+-dependent calmodulin kinase is activated and represses
  the activation of β-catenin. In the noncanonical Wnt/JNK (pathway C): Wnt binds
  to Frizzled receptors on the surface of cells and subsequently delivers signals
  into the cells to activate the downstream GTPase Rho and JNK, thus participating
  in the cytoskeleton and regulation of downstream genes via AP-1 promotor (such as
  tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and IL-6). (B) The mechanistic
  of physiological and pathological effect of the Wnt signaling pathway in ASCVD.
  The activation of Wnt signaling pathway could result in neovascularization, vulnerable
  plaque, myocardial healing, vascular calcification, obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin
  resistance, inflammation, myocardial remodeling, and myocardial fibrosis and then
  lead to AS and CVD. Sfrp5 is capable of preventing the binding of Wnt and Frizzled
  proteins through its combination with Wnt protein, thus blockading the Wnt signaling,
  inhibiting the transcription of the target genes in the downstream and cytoskeleton.
  In addition, Sfrp5 has the ability to repress the JNK signaling via its combination
  with Wnt5a; as a result, it plays a protective effect against AS and ASCVD. VEGF,
