caption: 'Methotrexate pathway. Methotrexate and its active polyglutamate metabolites
  interfere with several intracellular metabolic processes in particular one-carbon
  metabolism and de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis, by inhibiting the activity
  of key enzymes such as DHFR, ATIC, and TYMS. This antimetabolic effect may lead
  to alteration in intracellular nucleotide pools and increased adenosine release,
  determining the anti-rheumatic effect of methotrexate. ABCs, ATP-binding cassette
  transporters; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATIC, adenosine ribonucleotide transformylase;
  DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; FPGS, folylpolyglutamate synthase; GGH, gamma-glutamyl
  hydrolase; IMP, inosine monophosphate; ITP: inosine triphosphate; ITPA, inosine
  triphosphate-pyrophosphatase; SLC19A1, solute carrier family 19 member 1; TYMS,
  thymidylate synthetase.'
