caption: Linuron degradation status (at round 10) under the influence of supplements
  with the ortho- and meta-cleavage pathway (Pathways 2 and 3) vs. the modified ortho-cleavage
  pathway (Pathway 1). Substrates in red were selected for further validation in the
  lab experiment. The x and y scales represent the amount of linuron (%).
