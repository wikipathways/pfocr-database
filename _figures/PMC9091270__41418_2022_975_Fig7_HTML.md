caption: A The dimeric and inactive TAp63α is highly expressed in oocytes during dictyate
  arrest. B Anti-cancer therapy with chemotherapeutic agents or γ-irradiation causes
  DNA damage. Doxorubicin or γ-irradiation directly induces DSBs. Cisplatin, however,
  creates covalent inter- and intra-strand DNA adducts, which are then turned into
  DSBs by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. The kinase ATM is recruited
  and activated by DSBs and activates its downstream kinase Chk2 by phosphorylation.
  Chk2 in turn phosphorylates TAp63α at a single residue (S582) creating a consensus
  sequence for the constitutively active kinase CK1. CK1 then consecutively phosphorylates
  S585, S588, S591 and T594 as with each step it creates a new consensus sequence
  to phosphorylate the next residue at position i + 3. The accumulated negative charge
  of the phosphate groups triggers the formation of an active tetramer inducing the
  transcription of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members PUMA and NOXA []. This leads
  to apoptosis of the primordial follicles and ultimately to premature ovarian insufficiency
  (POI) upon cancer therapy [, , –]. C The priming kinase Chk2 and the executioner
  kinase CK1 phosphorylate serine and threonine residues in a consecutive manner.
  In the autoinhibitory complex the phosphorylated sequence is adjacent to the TI
  domain and thereby in proximity to the negatively charged residues following the
  β-strand T2 (D61, D63 and D66). The charge repulsion with these residues breaks
  open the autoinhibitory complex leading to irreversible tetramerization.
