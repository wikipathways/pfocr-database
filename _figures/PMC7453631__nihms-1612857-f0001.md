caption: KRAS G12C–mutant cancer cells restore MAPK pathway signaling following selective
  G12C inhibition through RTK-mediated activation of wild-type RAS. A, In KRAS G12C–mutant
  cancer cells, RTK activation is suppressed by ERK-mediated–negative feedback. B,
  Treatment of KRAS G12C–mutant cells with the covalent G12C inhibitor ARS-1620 results
  in a release of upstream feedback inhibition of RTKs on the cell surface, which
  bypass KRAS G12C inhibition by activating wild-type RAS. This results in a rebound
  in MAPK pathway signaling. C, Cotreatment of cells with a SHP2 inhibitor can prevent
  RTK-mediated activation of wild-type RAS resulting in more durable MAPK pathway
  inhibition. D, While cotreatment with a MEK inhibitor can also prevent rebound in
  MAPK pathway signaling, the resulting relief of negative feedback inhibition of
  RTKs and RAS can lead to activation of parallel oncogenic pathways such as the PI3K/AKT
  pathway.
