caption: 'Potential intracellular mechanisms related to senescent cells specific reprogramming.
  Youthful secretory phenotype reverses the upregulation of cellular glutaminase 1
  [], so more leucine is transported into adipocytes with glutamine export. Leucine
  activation of mTORC1 and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) promotes lipolysis
  and inhibits fatty acid synthesis []. However, its overall gains are obtained by
  increasing leptin and lipocalin secretion and/or synthesis in adipocytes, activating
  AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α signalling to regulate mitochondrial metabolism, and inhibiting
  the detrimental factors associated with mTORC1 activation to promote browning and
  fatty acid oxidation []. Therefore, in addition to amplifying the anti-ageing effect,
  the use of synergistic effects should also be considered to offset each other’s
  side effects to achieve an overall benefit to highlight the superiority of this
  strategy. For example, direct intake of leucine causes inhibition of Sestrin2, and
  thus activation of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, which shortens lifespan
  []. However, by improving adipose tissue function, rejuvenated adipose precursor
  cells produce more functional adipocytes, as we know that branched chain amino acids
  (BCAAs) promote adipose precursor cell differentiation, which in turn reduces acetyl
  coenzyme A (AcCoA) production from sugar and glutamine (thus increasing glutamine
  cycle levels and facilitating leucine entry into adipocytes) and increase branched
  chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic fluxes []. BCAA catabolism, which reduced leucine
  levels in other tissues (thereby derepressing Sestrin2 inhibition and inactivating
  the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway). This leucine distribution (adipocyte
  enrichment) facilitates the activation of AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α signalling to regulate
  mitochondrial metabolism while suppressing the detrimental effects of mTORC1 activation
  in other tissues. Just as senescent adipocytes maintain survival by passing mitochondria
  to macrophages [,], increased glutamine catabolism in senescent cells to lower intracellular
  pH (glutamine-glutamate+NH₄⁺) is a way to save themselves [], and the susceptibility
  of adipose to senescence leads to high amide consumption, which reminds us that
  macrophages secrete large amounts of SASP due to elevated glucolysis in a low glutamine
  environment []. Thus, increased glutamine levels inhibit glucolysis and thus improve
  inflammation, while GSTM2 in exosomes provides more GSH to maintain redox homeostasis
  []. In combination with the promotion of glycine adipocyte enrichment and the reduction
  in mTORC1 activation in other tissues, this is a synergistic anti-ageing effect.
  Furthermore, due to eNAMPT and cell rejuvenation, excess branched-chain amino acids
  are consumed via the tricarboxylic acid cycle, thereby retaining their role in promoting
  leptin secretion and Sirt1 activity while preventing excessive mTORC1 activation.
  CD38 expression increases with macrophage senescence, which can lead to a significant
  depletion of NAD+ [,], combined with a decrease in Sirt1 [] function and eNAMPT
  [,] secretion triggered by adipocyte senescence and a decrease in the NAD+/NADH
  ratio []. This series of imbalances leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and an imbalance
  in redox status. The removal of these cells will delay senescence by reducing the
  above disorders, but the rejuvenation of these senescent cells may be achieved through
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the rearrangement of the disordered metabolic and
  transcriptional state through de novo synthesis and salvage production pathway (NAM–NMN–NAD+).
  The activation of Sirt1 has an anti-ageing effect via the PGC-1α and FOXO pathways
  [,,]. (black arrow: direct stimulatory, round arrow: cycle, dotted arrow: tentative
