caption: Plant metabolic orientation of hormone interplay, carbon partitioning and
  responses on mycorrhizal development under high available P. Box and arrow color
  indicate repression (red), or promotion (green). Orange boxes and black arrows are
  used for uncertain conditions. Based on the literature survey, high available P
  affects mycorrhizal performances mainly due to the activity of mycorrhiza-inhibiting
  hormones (such as GA, SA, and ET), and in which SAR is potentialized. This goes
  together with a non-favorable metabolic frame which seems connected to an enhanced
  photosynthesis activity, lower translocation of photosynthetats from shoots to roots,
  a continuous flow of sugars processed via glycolysis, lipogenesis, and TCA, but
  also reduced fermentation activity and higher oxidative potential (reduced NADH+H+
  cytosolic pool). In this system, lower free amounts of compounds (sugars, aminoacids,
  SL, and carboxylate acids) are released in the root exudate, thus reducing possible
  molecular dialog between AM fungi and plant root. In addition, high P favors electron
  partitioning toward the plant COX pathway, thus participating to ATP formation.
  It is questioned if this metabolic flux is accompanied by higher oxygen consumption
  by plant cells, which may become less available for the fungus (as aerobic organism)
  under high P. ABA, abscisic acid; JA, jasmonate; GA, gibberellins; SA, salicylic
