caption: Biosynthetic pathway of cephalosporin C in A. chrysogenum, indicating the
  subcellular location of the different enzymes and intermediates. A vacuole is shown
  in pink color, and a putative PenV-like transporter in the vacuole membrane is proposed
  in a black ellipse. A peroxisome is shown in green color, and the tranporters CefP
  and CefM are indicated in black and red ellipses, respectively. The CefM protein
  may also be located in multivesicular structures (see text). The transporter CefT
  is located in the cell membrane.
