caption: (A) In E. coli, the branch point between SFA/UFA synthesis occurs at the
  level of the ten carbon intermediate. Both FabA and FabZ can catalyze the dehydration
  of 3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP to trans-2-decenoyl-ACP (), whereas only FabA can isomerize
  the double bond to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP (; ). SFA biosynthesis proceeds by the action
  of FabI on the trans-2 intermediate followed by further elongation cycles initiated
  by a long-chain 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (either FabB or FabF). UFA synthesis requires
  FabB to elongate cis-3-decenoyl-ACP () and thereby initiate the elongation cycles
  that form the major long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, C16:1Δ9c and C18:1Δ11c ().(B)
  In A. viridans, UFA synthesis proceeds from a pathway branch at the 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-ACP
  stage. FabQ dehydrates 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-ACP to trans-2-dodecenoyl-ACP and isomerizes
  a portion of this intermediate to cis-3-dodecenoyl-ACP. FabF is required for the
  subsequent elongation of cis-3-dodecenoyl-ACP to produce the long-chain unsaturated
  fatty acids. SFA are formed by the action of the FabK enoyl-ACP reductase followed
  by further elongation cycles initiated by FabF.See also .
