caption: Protein interaction and functional clustering of identified hits and known
  UV‐G2 checkpoint components. Interaction map of the UV‐G2 checkpoint components
  color‐coded by functional clustering and relation to previous evidence is presented.
  String analysis of the functional gene list is shown. kmeans clustering with 7 clusters
  (more did not affect the clustering) was used. The thickness of the edges indicates
  the confidence, using only textmining and experimental database evidence. Average
  clustering coefficient was 0.59, and PPI enrichment was P < 10−16. Novel genes that
  influence the response are in light blue, and those in green represent the MASTL
  pathway. Genes in white were not identified in the screen but are known components
  from other studies. The blue boxes define components with no previous connection
  to UVR responses.
papertitle: Multiple interaction nodes define the postreplication repair response
  to UV‐induced DNA damage that is defective in melanomas and correlated with UV signature
  mutation load.
