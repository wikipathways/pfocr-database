caption: The role of PVT1 in the digestive system []. A PVT1 directly targets miR-26b.
  B PVT1 promotes the expression of VEGFA and EGFR by targeting miR-152-3p. C PVT1
  promotes YBX1 expression by targeting miR-216a-5p and ultimately leads to EMT in
  CRC cells. D By targeting miR-16-5p, PVT1 leads to increased VEGFA, VEGFR1, and
  AKT expression and ultimately leads to EMT in CRC cells. E PVT1 ultimately promotes
  EMT in CRC cells by targeting miR-186 and leading to increased Twist1 expression.
  F PVT1 promotes RAF-1 by targeting miR-455. G PVT1 promotes the expression of RUNX2
  by targeting miR-30d-5p. H PVT1 upregulates IRS1 by targeting miR-214-3p and ultimately
  activates PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. I PVT1 promotes the expression of COX2 by
  targeting miR-146a. J PVT1 promotes the expression of FJX1 by targeting miR-106b-5p.
  K PVT1 promotes the expression of MAPK1 by targeting miR-761. L PVT1 promotes the
  occurrence of EMT in CRC cells by downregulating the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax
  and Cl-caspase-3 and upregulating the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2
