caption: Representation of the resistance mechanisms to the vemurafenib. (a) Vemurafenib
  causes cell death by inhibiting V600E BRAF kinase activity and signaling transduction
  through the MAPK pathway. (b) New mutations in the NRAS causes heterodimerization
  of BRAF/CRAF and reactivation of the signaling pathway. (c) and (d) Phosphorylation
  of ERK independent of RAF stimulation is the result of the overexpression of COT
  (c) and of the additional mutation in MEK kinase (d). (e) Overexpression of PDGFRβ
  can lead to resistance to vemurafenib treatment independent from the continuous
  inhibition of the MAPK pathway.
