caption: The reaction sequence on a iron and b potassium phase of Fe2O3@KO2 material
  implying the significance of tandem activation of CO2 in this work. FTS-based c
  chain initiation and d chain propagation steps through both carbide and CO-insertion
  pathways; also known as Biloen–Sachtler mechanism (greenish background) and Pichler–Schulz
  mechanism (bluish background), respectively. e Simplified illustration highlighting
  the concepts of “molecular fit” and “containment effect” in zeolite catalysis. f
  A simplified relationship sketch between hydrocarbons/carbonylates (including CO)
  and final product selectivity for all zeolites, highlighting the significance of
  both supramolecular reaction centers and topology on controlling the product selectivity.
