caption: 'Protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways are potential targets in lymphatic
  endothelial cells. Protein tyrosine kinases are a diverse group of proteins that
  act in different subcellular compartments of the cell. Outlined in the diagram are
  some examples of the types of signaling pathways involving tyrosine kinases: a)
  Receptor tyrosine kinases are expressed on the cell surface and bind their specific
  ligands. Ligand binding activates the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase domain and
  triggers the signaling cascade. (For example VEGFR-3 signalling). b) Non-PTK cell
  surface receptors can be associated with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. The cytoplasmic
  tyrosine kinase may be brought into contact with the receptor by direct binding,
  an example of which is the JAK kinases. Alternatively, the PTK may be tethered to
  the plasma membrane allowing it to rapidly interact with the activated receptor.
  The Src family kinases act in this manner. c) Other cytosolic PTKs act downstream
  in the signaling pathway or more broadly throughout the cell. The c-Abl kinase is
  an example of a PTK with activity in various subcellular locations. d) In some circumstances,
  the intracellular domain of a receptor tyrosine kinase may be cleaved and translocate
  to the nucleus where it is able to phosphorylate different targets. (For example
  ErbB4 can signal in this manner). e) Nuclear associated tyrosine kinases are localized
  to the nucleus; their activity may be modulated in response to signaling pathways.
  (An example of this is the fyn-related kinase). The types of inhibitors that could
  be used to target each tyrosine kinase pathway are listed on the right of the figure.'
