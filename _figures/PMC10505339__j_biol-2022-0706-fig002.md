caption: NF-κB signalling pathway. In the canonical NF-κB signalling pathway, inflammatory
  factors such as TNF, IL-1, and LPS bind to cell surface receptors, phosphorylating
  downstream IκB kinase (IKK) and subsequently phosphorylating IκB. Phosphorylated
  IκB is degraded in the cytoplasm, releasing the p50/p65 complex. This complex translocates
  to the nucleus and binds to DNA, resulting in the downregulation of osteogenesis-related
  markers, such as OPN, OCN, Osx, and Runx2. In the non-canonical NF-κB signalling
  pathway, cytokines such as CD40L, BAFF, and LTβ bind to cell surface receptors,
  promoting the activation of NIK and IKKα. IKKα phosphorylates p100, leading to partial
  processing of p100 and the formation of the p52–RelB complex. Subsequently, the
  p52–RelB complex enters the nucleus and binds to DNA.
