caption: Smad-dependent signaling in dentin formation. BMPs bind to receptor type
  II (R-II) and receptor type I (R-I) before the signaling transduces to their Smad1/5/8.
  Activated Smad1/5/8 interacts with Smad4, forming a complex which translocates into
  the nucleus where they interact with other transcription factors to trigger target
  gene expression. Consequently, Smad-dependent signaling enhances dental mesenchymal
  cell differentiation and expression of DSPP and DMP1 genes via the action of Smads,
  Dlx3, Dlx5, Klf4, Msx1, Msx2, Osx, Pax9, and Runx2, and other compounds during dentinogenesis.
  Smad6 binds the type I BMP receptor and prevents Smad1/5/8 from being activated.
  Additionally, Smurf1 interacts with the Runx2 protein and induces Runx2 protein
  degradation. The figure is partially adapted with permission from Wu et al., 2016,
