caption: FGF signalling is initiated by ligand-dependent dimerisation of the FGFR,
  which leads to the cross-phosphorylation (P) of tyrosine residues in the intracellular
  domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase (not shown). These phosphorylated residues
  are then bound specifically by several intracellular signal transduction proteins,
  including PLCγ, FRS2 and Src family members. These initiate several intracellular
  signalling pathways, including the (A) PLCγ pathway, (B) PI3K/PKB pathway and (C)
  the Ras/ERK pathway. The cell responses to these different pathways are shown. CamKII,
  calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; DAG, diacylglycerol; ERK, extracellular-signal
