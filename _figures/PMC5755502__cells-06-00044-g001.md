caption: Schematic representation of the glycolytic pathway in E. histolytica. The
  diagram depicts the pathways that are present under (A) microaerophilic control
  conditions or (B) after exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) or nitric oxide
  (NO) (in red). The thickness of the arrows represents the relative flux rates through
  the enzymatic reactions. The size of the metabolite abbreviation represents its
  relative concentration within the trophozoites. Under stress condition, pyruvate:ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase (PFOR) and aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHE) (in blue) are inhibited.
  The metabolic intermediaries before PFOR and ADHE reactions (in green) are accumulated
  with the concomitant decrease in ethanol (EtOH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  production. Glcout, external glucose; Glcin, internal glucose. Adapted from [].
