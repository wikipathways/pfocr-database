caption: 'Node activation of Growth Hormone Signaling Pathway for gastric cancer sample
  GC.11_S19_R1_001 from . Node activation is a sum of logarithmic case-to-norm ratio
  (CNR) for all genes in the node. CNR is ratio of expression levels in tumor sample
  and averaged normal sample. The RNA sequencing tumor profile (gastric cancer) was
  obtained from . The RNA sequencing profiles of normal gastric tissue were obtained
  from Oncobox Atlas of Normal Tissue Expression (ANTE) data (). Different edge colors
  indicate edge attribute: green is for “activation,” red is for “inhibition.” Structure
  of the Growth Hormone Signaling Pathway is derived from Qiagen Pathway Central.'
