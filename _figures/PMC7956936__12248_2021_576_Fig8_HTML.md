caption: A mechanistic view of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Anthracyclines
  can be taken up by hiPSC-CMs at significantly different rates and amounts due to
  their differences in lipophilicity. Once inside the cell, they induce alterations
  in several inter-linked canonical pathways (dashed arrows) such as DR signaling
  (purple), DNA damage/helicase inhibition (blue), dysregulation of calcium signaling
  (orange), reduced oxidative phosphorylation (gray), ROS production (green), and
  cardiac structural damage (yellow). However, the extent to which each pathway is
  activated or inhibited is specific for each anthracycline drug and appears to be
  associated with the drug’s cellular uptake
