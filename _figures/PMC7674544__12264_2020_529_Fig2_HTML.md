caption: 'Purine salvage and adenine nucleotide synthesis. ATP breakdown results in
  the production of the purine nucleosides adenosine (Ado) and inosine (Ino) and the
  nucleobase hypoxanthine (Hx) which are lost from the brain into the blood; see [,
  ] and Figure  for human data. Purine salvage (blue arrows) restores adenine nucleotide
  levels directly via APRT (adenine phosphoribosyltransferase; adenine to AMP) and
  indirectly via HPRT [hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; hypoxanthine to inosine
  monophosphate (IMP)]. This reaction requires PRPP (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate),
  which is produced from the ribose-5-phosphate (Rib-5-P) that emerges from the pentose
  phosphate pathway. Ribose-5-phosphate can also be formed via isomerization of adenosine-
  and inosine-derived ribose-1-phosphate, or directly from D-ribose by ribokinase
  thereby increasing PRPP levels. Adenine and D-ribose feed into the salvage pathway
  and increase tissue AMP and hence ATP levels via mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial
  routes (cytoplasmic adenylate kinases). Importantly, mitochondria rely on salvage-derived
  ADP for ATP production. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase and prevents the breakdown
  of hypoxanthine to xanthine (X), and from xanthine to uric acid (UA) providing more
  hypoxanthine for salvage and additionally reducing the production of H2O2-derived
  reactive oxygen species. Adenine supplementation is preferred over hypoxanthine
  as the former is: (i) less of a substrate for xanthine oxidase than hypoxanthine
  by a factor of 20 [], thereby making more substrate available for the PSP and limiting
  H2O2 production; (ii) prevented from being converted to an insoluble metabolite
  (2,8-dihydroxyadenine) by allopurinol, (iii) requires only one enzyme to be converted
  into a usable adenine nucleotide (AMP), whereas hypoxanthine requires three, and
  (iv) adenine is already in use in man in blood transfusion products where it promotes
  the synthesis and maintenance of ATP in erythrocytes via the purine salvage pathway.
  Adenine is readily transported into the brain via SLC29 equilibrative nucleoside
  transporters. A fuller account can be found in [].'
