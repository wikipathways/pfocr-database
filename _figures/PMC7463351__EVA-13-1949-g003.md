caption: 'Differentially expressed genes between highland and lowland maize landraces
  encoding enzymes involved in general phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. The general phenylpropanoid
  biosynthesis pathway consisting of three genes underlying enzymatic steps (white
  diamonds) and four metabolic intermediates (light purple rectangles). Enzyme gene
  names are as follows: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate‐4‐hydroxylase;
  4Cl, 4‐coumarate: CoA ligase. Genes up‐regulated in highland landraces are represented
  by circles with blue while genes up‐regulated in lowland landraces are represented
  by red. A full circle represents a log2fold change of 2.11 (i.e., 4.32 times higher
  expression); partially filled circles represent up‐regulation to a portion of 4.32
  times. If multiple circles are present to the right of an enzyme gene name, then
  multiple genes encoding that type of enzyme are up‐regulated—cross‐reference Figure 
  and Table  for associated gene names and log2fold change values, respectively. Genes
  were considered differentially expressed when significant at a 0.05 FDR rate using
  a Benjamini–Hochberg correction'
