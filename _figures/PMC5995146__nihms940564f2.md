caption: (A) Shown is the involvement of Parkin, Pink1, and FBXO7 in the regulation
  of mitophagy. Damaged mitochondria (red) are identified and tagged for degradation
  through the process of mitophagy, which is disrupted in individuals carrying mutations
  in these proteins. In the absence of functional mitophagy, cellular damage and eventual
  cell death results from the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. (B) Potential
  involvement of Mendelian loci and genetic risk factors for PD in the autophagy/lysosomal
  pathway. Mutations and genetic risk variants in genes such as those encoding LRRK2,
  VPS35, GBA, RAB7L1, and GAK may result in disruption of protein degradation pathways
  and accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins, leading to cytotoxicity and
  neuronal cell death.
