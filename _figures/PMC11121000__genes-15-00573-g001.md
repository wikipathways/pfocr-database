caption: 'Known salt stress responses and signaling pathways in wheat: (1) the SOS
  signaling pathway is the most classical signaling pathway under salt stress, which
  in wheat consists of TaSOS3/TaCBL4, TaSOS2/TaCIPK5 and TaSOS1 [23], and transports
  Na+ out of the cell by sensing cellular Ca2+ signals. Ca2+ is the second messenger
  of the cell, and the Ca2+-CBL-CIPK network maintains homeostatic balance in plants,
  including the antioxidant system and the ABA signaling pathway; (2) the HKT gene
  family are Na+-selective transporters, TaHKT1;5-D, Nax1 and Nax2 maintain a high
  K+/Na+ ratio in wheat by limiting Na+ transport into the cell [14], and other channels,
  including chloride channel proteins, water-selective channel proteins and NSCCs,
  are also involved in the response of wheat to salt stress; (3) salt stress induces
  cellular ABA accumulation and the wheat ABA receptor TaPYL5 can regulate ROS homeostasis
  under abiotic stress through the TaPP2C53/TaSnRK2.1/TaABI1 signaling pathway [24].
  The activation of ABA synthesis and signaling pathways enhances the expression of
  salt-tolerant genes and maintains cellular ion homeostasis. Other hormones such
  as JA, BR and GA also play important roles; (4) in transcriptional regulation, TaFDL2-1A-TaNCED2/TaSOD1/TaGPX1,
  TaCDPK-TabZIP60-TaNCED1/TaLEA1 and other pathways respond to salt stress [25] and
  NAC, MYB, WRKY, AP2/ERF, etc. improve salt tolerance of wheat by regulating the
  expression of stress-related genes; (5) at the post-transcriptional translation
  stage, overexpression of TaPUB1/2/3, TaPUB15, TaFBA-2A and TaSDR1 improves salt
  tolerance in plants, suggesting that wheat may be involved in protein degradation
  through ubiquitin-mediated pathways [26]; (6) TaATG2/7 was involved in the response
  of wheat to salt stress, suggesting that salt stress-induced deleterious substances
  may be degraded by autophagy; and (7) TMKP1 interacts with TMPK3 and TMPK6 in vivo,
  and TMKP1 overexpression in Arabidopsis under salt stress has a higher germination
  rate [27], suggesting that wheat MAKP may play an active role in regulating the
  response of plant cells to salt and osmotic stress'
