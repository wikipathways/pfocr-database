caption: NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and role of some microRNAs.
  The priming signal acts through Toll-like receptor (TLR), specific receptors IL1-R,
  or TNFR that leads to the activation of NF-κB and subsequent production of pro-IL-1β,
  pro-IL-18, and pro-NLRP3. The second activation signal is provided by multiple events,
  including mitochondrial dysfunction, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation,
  among others, that damage mitochondria, opening the MPP releasing ROS and mtDNA
  to the cytosol. These signals activate NLRP3 inflammasome, that in turn causes caspase-1-depending
  IL-1β and IL-18 maturation. In conditions of high cytokine production, IL-1R and
  TNFR signaling activate the downstream kinase IRAK1 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1), and TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6), finally resulting in activation
  of NF-κB pathway that directly yields miR-146a and miR-21. miR-21 may act directly
  on TLRs and/or targeting A20 [], activating NF-kB pathway. Moreover, the NF-κB-dependent
  TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, as well as IL-1β and IL-18 production, the later ones activated
  by the NLRP3 inflammasome, increase miR-21 and miR-223 expression, the latter regulating
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation []. miR-223 and miR-483, acting through their target
  insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2 and IGF-1, respectively, regulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway and blunt rates of protein synthesis [,]. Arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase
  (aanat) is the enzyme involved in melatonin synthesis and is a target for miR-483
  []. The participation of melatonin is described in the text below.
