caption: Diagrammatic representation of possible mechanistic pathway for the induction
  of EGID. Allergens (Aero- or food-) procured by antigen presenting cells (APCs)
  are offered to the conventional (CD4+ T cells) and non-conventional T cells (iNKT
  cells). Based on our earlier reports and presented information in the review, we
  propose that both conventional CD4+T cells and non-conventional iNKT cells generate
  eosinophil active Th2 cytokines like IL-4, IL-5, IL-13. The iNKT cells require IL-15
  and IL-18 for survival, proliferation and activation. The antigen presenting cells
  may be the major source of IL-15 and IL-18 to activate iNKT cells to initiate the
  disease process in a number of gastrointestinal disorders like EoE, EGE and EC.
  IL- 18 is a unique cytokine that has a role in a number of allergic diseases and
  recent publication indicates that IL-18 overexpression in the tissues promotes eosinophilic
  inflammation and tissue remodeling through the induction of TGFα/β. Our earlier
  publications and evidences presented in this review indicate that STAT5 and STAT6
  regulate the activation of CD4+ T and iNKT cells, respectively. Interestingly, the
  role of eosinophil active Th2 cytokines and chemokines (eotaxins-1, and eotaxin-3)
  in gastrointestinal epithelial mucosa is critical in the accumulation of eosinophils
  into the esophagus (via eotaxin-3 involvement) and in the intestine and colon (via
  Eotaxin-1 involvement), respectively, which promotes EGID.
