caption: 'Demonstrated signaling connections are presented as black arrows, pharmacological
  activators are connected to their targets with green arrows, and pharmacological
  inhibitors are connected to their targets by red blunt-ended arrows. SQ22,536 served
  as a polypharmacological agent: its observed IC50 values at its two targets in NS-1
  cells are 10 μM (AC) and 170 μM (Rapgef2). Cat, catalytic subunit of PKA; Reg, regulatory
  subunit of PKA. The protein product of the Rapgef2 gene has been referred to variously
  as CNrasGEF, PDZ-GEF1, RA-GEF, nRapGEP, and its activity as the NCS (neuritogenic
  cAMP sensor) (, ). The protein products of the Rapgef3 and Rapgef4 genes are variously
  referred to as Epac1/2 and cAMP-GEFI/II.'
