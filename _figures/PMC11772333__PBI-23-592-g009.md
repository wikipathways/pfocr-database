caption: Biosynthetic pathway of natural carotenoids. In this figure, the illuminated
  spots display the colours of various substances. Specifically, the carotenoids belonging
  to C30 and C50 categories are denoted in blue. The main biosynthetic pathways are
  divided into α and β pathways, which are distinctly colour‐coded as green and orange,
  respectively. The dashed arrow indicates that multiple reactions occur within that
  particular step. Crucial precursors in the biosynthesis process are emphasized with
  black boxes. MEP, 2‐C‐methyl‐derythritol‐4‐phosphate pathway; MVA, mevalonate pathways;
