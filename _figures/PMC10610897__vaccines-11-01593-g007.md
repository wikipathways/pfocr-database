caption: 'Interaction network of genes and co-expressed lncRNAs involved in IAV replication
  regulation in MDCK cells. Pink represents genes, and green represents lncRNA. RSAD2,
  CLDN1, IFIT5, and HCLS1 exhibit consistent expression patterns with their predicted
  matching lncRNAs, indicating that they may have a positive regulatory target gene
  relationship with their matching lncRNAs. RSAD2 and IFIT5 may inhibit IAV replication
  in MDCK cells through the type I/II interferon signaling pathway, in which RSAD2
  inhibits the release of IAV from the plasma membrane of host cells. CLDN1, a key
  factor involved in HCV entry, may also assist in IAV entry into MDCK cells. HAX-1
  interacts with the PA subunit of IAV, which may promote the replication of IAV in
  MDCK cells. Abbreviation: IAV, influenza A virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HAX-1,
  HCLS1 interacting protein X-1.'
