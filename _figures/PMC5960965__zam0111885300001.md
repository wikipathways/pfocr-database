caption: Overview of pathways to trans-humulyl cation-derived sesquiterpenoids in
  S. hirsutum. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway converts acetyl-CoA from the central metabolism
  to the universal 5-carbon isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl-pyrophosphate (IPP)
  and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). Condensation of DMAPP and IPP (dotted line)
  followed by a second condensation reaction (solid line) with IPP yields the 15-carbon
  sesquiterpenoid precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). 1,11-Cyclization of FPP
  by sesquiterpene synthases (STSs) yields a trans-humulyl cation intermediate that
  is further cyclized into different sesquiterpene scaffolds depending on the STS.
  Three Δ6-protoilludene synthases have been characterized previously (), while STSs
  responsible for hirsutene and sterpurene synthesis remain to be identified. Major
  volatile sesquiterpenes, hirsutene and Δ6-protoilludene, produced by S. hirsutum,
  are boxed. Additional biosynthetic steps lead to bioactive hirsutenoids, such as
  the two examples shown (Fig. S1 shows possible cyclization pathways to hirsutene).
  ACAT, acetoacetyl-CoA transferase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase;
