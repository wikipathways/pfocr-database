caption: A model representing regulation of the p73 isoforms’ expression and stability.
  The positive regulators are shown in green, and the negative regulators are shown
  in red. On the transcriptional level, expression of the p73 isoforms is regulated
  by usage of two different promoters (P1 and P2) producing the TAp73 or ΔNp73 isoforms.
  Black bars represent the TP73 gene promoters. Several regulators specifically activate
  the P1 promoter, with transcription factor E2F-1 being the most important. In contrast,
  transcription from P1 is repressed by ZEB, C-EBPα, and hSirT1. The full-length p53
  and the TAp73 proteins, as well as Nrf-2, have been found to induce both promoters.
  On the posttranscriptional level, the alternative splicing of P1 pre-mRNA, leading
  to increased expression of the ΔEx2p73 isoform, is induced by the activation of
  EGFR by its ligand amphiregulin (AR) in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The expression
  of the ΔEx2p73 isoform is enabled by the inhibition of the RNA splicing factor SLU7
  through JNK1 signaling. The stability of the p73 mRNA is increased by the RNA-binding
  protein RNPC1. Ribosomal protein RPL26 has been found to regulate the p73 translation
  and protein stability. The p73 protein isoforms are also extensively regulated on
  a posttranslational level. Here are shown different regulators of the TAp73 and
  ΔNp73 isoforms’ stability and degradation. Some of them target both TAp73 and ΔNp73
  isoforms including Itch, NGFR, calpains, and NQO1 (through 20S proteasome). On the
  contrary, antizyme (Az) pathway and ligase PIR2 specifically target the ΔNp73 isoforms
  for degradation after DNA damage.
