caption: Proposed molecular pathway governing multiciliogenesis. MYB and other transcriptional
  regulators associated with each step in the program are shown along with the regulatory
  relationships among them, together with the Notch signaling pathway that controls
  initiation of the program. The dashed line indicates that there is an auxiliary
  pathway that can partially bypass the requirement for MYB, at least in some MCCs.
