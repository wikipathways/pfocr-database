caption: Interactions between G6PD and other proteins. Elliptical shape represents
  a protein. Circle shape represents post-translational modification. (a) Proteins
  such as PTEN, BAG3 or p53 bind to G6PD and inhibit G6PD active dimer formation,
  leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation and downregulation of DNA synthesis.
  (b) G6PD is activated through binding with Hsp27 and separating with p53, resulting
  in an enhanced cell proliferation rate and DNA synthesis. Hsp27 can be phosphorylated
  by ATM. p53 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the PAK4 pathway.
