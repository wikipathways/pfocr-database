caption: Mechanism of Homologous Recombination (HR). As an error-free pathway of DSB
  repair, multiple proteins such as CtIP (red), ATM (brown), and MRN complex (comprised
  of MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1) (purple) are recruited to initiate DSB repair. At the
  DSB ends, EXO1 (green) resects one strand of DNA directionally (5′-3′) to generate
  a 3′ single strand DNA (ssDNA) tail. Replication protein A (RPA) (yellow) then binds
  to the ssDNA tail, which is subsequently replaced by another protein RAD51 (blue).
  During this step, other proteins such as BRCA2 (not shown in this figure) would
  help RAD51 to bind to ssDNA to form the RAD51-ssDNA nucleofilament (Esashi et al.,
  ; Ayoub et al., ). The nucleofilament could then search for the homologous DNA sequences,
  invade into the homologous DNA sequences and synthesize DNA by using the homologous
  DNA sequences as templates. After the DNA synthesis, the DNA ends are ligated to
  the other side of the DSB.
