caption: The schematic linearly shows activation of Hh signaling after binding of
  Hh ligand to the Patched (Ptc) receptor. This results in subsequent localization
  of the Smo transmembrane protein to the primary cilium, where further signal transduction
  occurs after proteolytic processing of GLI2 to an activator form, resulting in GLI2
  nuclear translocation to transcriptionally activate Hh target genes. Smo inhibitors
  that are currently in clinical trials for human cancers are shown. ATO inhibits
  GLI1 and GLI2 proteins downstream of the Smo protein through similar, yet slightly
  distinct, mechanisms of action (, ).
