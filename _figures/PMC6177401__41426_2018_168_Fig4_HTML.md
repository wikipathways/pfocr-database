caption: Nonstructural proteins block signaling pathways after virus recognition and
  inhibit type I IFN production. NS3 and NS4a block retinoic acid-inducible gene I
  (RIG-I) translocation to mitochondria (red). NS2a and NS4b from DENV1, -2, -4 (green)
  and NS4a from DENV1 (light green) inhibit the activation of TANK-binding kinase
  1 (TBK1), blocking the RIG-I/mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) signaling
  pathway and IFNβ induction. NS2b targets cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) for autophagy–lysosome-dependent
  degradation and prevents mitochondrial DNA sensing (purple). NS2b/3 protease inhibits
  IFN production by cleaving stimulator of interferon gene (STING) (pink). NS4b inhibits
  RNAi by binding to Dicer, preventing the biogenesis of miRNA. NS3 will also block
  RNAi by binding to heat-shock cognate 70, an essential protein for creating RISC,
  and inhibit TRBP–Argonaute interaction and RISC formation (blue). DENV will exploit
  the autophagy pathway and use autophagosomes for replication, assembly and maturation,
  and evasion of neutralizing antibodies during transmission (red)
