caption: Presumable anti-hyperalgesic activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf) through
  the nitric oxide (NO)–cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP)–ATP-sensitive K+ channel
  signaling pathway. NO has an anti-nociceptive effect based on the formation of cGMP
  via guanylate cyclase activation. Production of cGMP leads to cGMP-dependent protein
  kinase (PKG) phosphorylation and the concomitant opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels.
  Activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels increases the intracellular K+ levels that,
  in turn, drive hyperpolarization of the neuron, and therefore relieves nociception
  and reestablishes the basal threshold of the neuron. bLf may exert its anti-hyperalgesic
  effect by activating the NO–cGMP–ATP- sensitive K+ channel signaling pathway. This
  figure was created with Biorender.com.
