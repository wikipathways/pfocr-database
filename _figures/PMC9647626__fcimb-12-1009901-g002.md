caption: Major miRNAs that regulate apoptosis effectors are shown in the diagram in

  regulate the major cascades of autophagy. The action of miRNAs involved in the regulation
  of key members of autophagy cascades; repression/activation of mRNA are shown in
  the nucleus. mTORC1 induces and regulates the autophagy by miRNAs. AMPK-mTORC1 lies
  at the heart of regulation of autophagy by integrating numerous stimuli and pathways
  into a signal for the starting point of autophagy. In addition, ER stress and ROS
  regulate autophagy independently of the AMPK-mTORC1 pathway. In TNF-α-induced necroptosis,
  the engagement of TNFR1 recruits Complex I (composed of TRADD, TRAF2). This complex
  promotes the NF-κB activation and promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis.
  When growth factor receptors are activated, the class I PI3K complex and a small
  GTPase, Ras, are activated, which activate the PI3K-PKD1-AKT and Ras-Raf-1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2
  pathways, respectively. Both AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylate and inhibit tuberous sclerosis
  complex, thereby stabilizing Ras homolog, which activates mTORC1, resulting in autophagy
  inhibition. JNK1-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation reduces the binding activity of
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to initiate autophagy, which promotes cell survival. TLR signaling
  and miRNAs form a complex network. TLR recruits adaptor proteins and activates downstream
  signaling cascades that activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and the MAPK signaling
  pathway in response to specific microbial recognition. This activation causes inflammatory
  mediators and miRNA genes to be expressed.

  description: Major miRNAs that regulate apoptosis effectors are shown in the diagram
    in the yellow box. FasR, Fas Receptor; FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein.
    miRNAs regulate the major cascades of autophagy. The action of miRNAs involved
    in the regulation of key members of autophagy cascades; repression/activation
    of mRNA are shown in the nucleus. mTORC1 induces and regulates the autophagy by
    miRNAs. AMPK-mTORC1 lies at the heart of regulation of autophagy by integrating
    numerous stimuli and pathways into a signal for the starting point of autophagy.
    In addition, ER stress and ROS regulate autophagy independently of the AMPK-mTORC1
    pathway. In TNF-α-induced necroptosis, the engagement of TNFR1 recruits Complex
    I (composed of TRADD, TRAF2). This complex promotes the NF-κB activation and promotes
    cell survival and inhibits apoptosis. When growth factor receptors are activated,
    the class I PI3K complex and a small GTPase, Ras, are activated, which activate
    the PI3K-PKD1-AKT and Ras-Raf-1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathways, respectively. Both AKT
    and ERK1/2 phosphorylate and inhibit tuberous sclerosis complex, thereby stabilizing
    Ras homolog, which activates mTORC1, resulting in autophagy inhibition. JNK1-mediated
    Bcl-2 phosphorylation reduces the binding activity of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to initiate
    autophagy, which promotes cell survival. TLR signaling and miRNAs form a complex
    network. TLR recruits adaptor proteins and activates downstream signaling cascades
    that activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway in response
