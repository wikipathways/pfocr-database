caption: Nf1 is a GAP-like protein located in cytoplasm and negatively regulates the
  activation of the RAS signaling pathway by converting RAS-GTP to RAS-GDP. The RAS-GTP
  activates both PI-3-K and classical MAPK pathways, resulting in the regulation of
  several cellular functions, such as angiogenesis, cell growth, proliferation and
  migration. Inhibition of Nf induces RAS activity and the signaling cascade of the
  MEK/ERK and Akt/mTOR pathway. Nf is also a key regulator of bone development and
  repair. Inhibition of Nf and the induction of RAS signaling pathway augments the
  expression of osteoclastic cell lines (red arrows) and declines the osteogenic differentiation
  (green arrows), resulting in skeletal defects. Akt, Protein kinase B; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; GDP, guanidine diphosphate; GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound
