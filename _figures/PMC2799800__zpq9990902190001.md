caption: Scheme of the model for the mammalian cell cycle. The model incorporates
  the four main cyclin/Cdk complexes centered on cyclin D/Cdk4–6, cyclin E/Cdk2, cyclin
  A/Cdk2, and cyclin B/Cdk1. Also considered are the effect of the GF and the role
  of the pRB/E2F pathway, which controls cell-cycle progression. Cyclin D/Cdk4–6 and
  cyclin E/Cdk2 elicit progression in G1 and the G1/S transition by phosphorylating
  and inhibiting pRB. The active, unphosphorylated form of pRB inhibits the transcription
  factor E2F, which promotes cell-cycle progression by inducing the synthesis of cyclins
  D, E, and A. Additional regulatory interactions are described in section 1 of SI
  Appendix where more detailed schemes for the whole network and each of its four
  modules are shown in Figs. S1 and S2. The combined effect of regulatory interactions
  between the four modules allows the cell to progress in a repetitive, oscillatory
  manner along the successive phases of the cell cycle, as depicted to the right.
