caption: Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) function in the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment
  (TME) and examples of therapeutic strategies. Multiple mediators (such as IL10,
  IL6, TGFβ, PUFAs, etc.) in the TME determine the activation state and function of
  TAMs. In response to these triggers, TAMs produce a plethora of tumor-promoting
  soluble factors (such as VEGF, CCL22, CCL18, etc.) and extracellular vehicles (Evs)
  and probably supply metabolic support to cancer cells. TAMs provide matrix support
  and growth factors also in the core of the tumor spheroids, which are stabilized
  by ICAM-1. During ovarian cancer progression, tumor cells detach from the primary
  tumor and interact with TAMs to survive in the ascitic fluid as free-floating spheroids.
  Blocking key macrophage pathways influences the tumorigenic and immunosuppressive
  activities of TAMs, providing tools for the development of novel therapies to be
  combined with classical chemotherapy for gynecologic cancers. Inhibiting the PD-L1/2
  immune checkpoint pathway results in reactivation of T cells. Re-activation of phagocytosis
  and promotion of M2 to M1-like phenotype shift are achieved by inhibiting the CD47
  and CSF-1R pathways, respectively. Furthermore, inhibitors of chemokines (such as
  CCL2) involved in the recruitment of monocytes can prevent TAMs differentiation
  and accumulation within the TME, thereby reducing tumor growth and dissemination.
