  (A) FadR represses production of ethanol and unnecessary fatty acyl-CoA when the
  fatty acids (FA) concentration is low. (B) When the intracellular fatty acid concentration
  is sufficient, fatty acids would be first activated to fatty acyl-CoA (by chromosomal
  fadD) and then fatty acyl-CoA would release FadR from its DNA-binding sites. This
  would result in the induction of genes that encode enzymes to produce ethanol and
  fadD to generate more fatty acyl-CoA, and AtfA to convert ethanol and fatty acyl-CoA
  to FAEE. Increasing enzyme flux in response to fatty acyl-CoA is represented by
  the thickness of the arrows. FAS: Fatty Acid Synthase'
