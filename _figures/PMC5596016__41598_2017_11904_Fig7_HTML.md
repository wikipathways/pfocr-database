caption: The signaling pathway for miR-503 playing its EMT-suppressive role in silica-induced
  pulmonary fibrosis. Silica treatment resulted in the enhanced expression of lncRNA
  MALAT1, which competitively binding to miR-503 and depressed its expression. When
  miR-503 was silenced, PI3K p85 binding to miR-503 was released and thereby activated
  the downstream molecules, thus causing intensified process of EMT.
papertitle: MiR-503 modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition in silica-induced
  pulmonary fibrosis by targeting PI3K p85 and is sponged by lncRNA MALAT1.
