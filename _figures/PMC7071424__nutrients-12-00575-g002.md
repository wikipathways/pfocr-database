caption: Role of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in regulating nitric oxide
  (NO) bioavailability. Ligand-bound VDR plays an important role in regulating NO
  synthesis via alterations in eNOS activity. Activation of plasma membrane VDR upregulates
  the activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), a calcium dependent enzyme, by upregulating
  the formation of intracellular second messengers including adenylyl cyclase (AC),
  diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which in turn result in calcium
  influx through the voltage-sensitive calcium channel (VSCC) in the plasma membrane
  and the sarcoplasmic reticulum and through the ip3 receptor/calcium channel (IP3CC)
  in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The increased intracellular calcium concentrations
  facilitate the calcium-calmodulin (CaM) pathway to activate eNOS. In addition, plasma
  membrane VDR triggers eNOS activation through phosphorylation of serine-1779 (human
  serine 1177) on eNOS by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ protein
  kinase b (Akt) pathway. Furthermore, genetic action of vitamin D via the nuclear
  VDR promotes eNOS expression, which synthesizes NO from L-arginine, and suppresses
  arginase-2 (AG2) expression, which inhibits eNOS activity by hydrolyzing the substrate
  for NO synthesis (arginine) to ornithine and urea. Increased NO production promotes
  angiogenesis by upregulating gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2)
  which improves endothelial cell (EC) migration and proliferation capacity. In addition,
  NO mediates angiogenetic activity of the cell via upregulation of vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and suppression of the angiogenesis
  inhibitor, angiostatin.
