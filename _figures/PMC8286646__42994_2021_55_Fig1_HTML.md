caption: 'Representative biosynthetic pathway of BIAs in plant. Key metabolites and
  enzymes are shown. Block arrows indicate enzymes that have been identified and functionally
  characterized. Arrow outlines indicate subcellular localization associated with
  ER: Brown, ER membrane-bound; blue, ER lumen. Enzyme types are identified by colored
  circles: Blue, PR 10 protein; white, methyltransferase; brown, cytochrome P450;
  yellow, NADPH-dependent aldo–keto reductase; red, NADPH-dependent short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase;
  gray, acetyltransferase; pink, 2-OG/Fe (II)-dependent demethylase; purple, FAD-linked
  oxidoreductase; green, carboxylesterase. Background colors indicate BIA subgroups:
  Yellow, simple benzylisoquinoline type; purple, promorphinane and morphinane type;
  pink, protoberberine type; blue, protopine and benzophenanthridine type; green,
  phthalideisoquinoline type; gray, aporphine type; brown, bisbenzylisoquinoline type.
