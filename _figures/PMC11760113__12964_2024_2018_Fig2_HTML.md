caption: Metabolism of glutamine between different kinds of T cells and cancer cells.
  Th1 combat tumors by secreting IFN-γ to activate macrophages and NK cells. Th2 and
  Treg promote cancer-induced immune suppression. A mixture of cytokines that bind
  to glutamine-restricted cells can lead to a shift from Th1 to Th2 expression. Th17
  cells can either support or inhibit cancer progression depending on the context.
  Glutamine metabolism is also a critical regulator of γδ T cell differentiation and
  IL-17 production. Loss of SLC7A5 results in reduced mTORC1-dependent Th1 and Th17
  effector T cells, while Treg numbers are largely unaffected. Proliferation of antigen-stimulated
  CD8 + T cells already present in the body is completely inhibited. This mechanism
  is due to the inability of the mTORC1 signaling pathway to activate in the absence
  of SLC7A5. Furthermore, the absence of the tumor suppressor Menin can enhance mTORC1
  signaling and glutamine breakdown. Th1, CD4 + T helper 1 cells; Th2, CD4 + T helper
  2 cells; Treg, regulatory T cells; Th17, CD4 + T helper 17; IL-17, interleukin-17
