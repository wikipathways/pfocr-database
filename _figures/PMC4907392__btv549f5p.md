caption: 'Network computed by Xtalk for crosstalk from the Hippo signaling pathway
  (A) to the TGF-β signaling pathway (B). Blue: proteins/edges in pathway A; purple:
  proteins/edges in pathway B; green: proteins/edges in both pathways; gray: proteins
  in neither pathway; black: edges annotated to neither pathway; triangles: receptors;
  rectangles: TFs. Undirected edges represent group/complex interactions. Solid/dashed
  edges represent activating/inhibitory interactions. The label ‘+p’ denotes phosphorylation
  interactions discussed in the text. Please see the text for a discussion of the
  yellow and pink polygons'
