caption: Schematic model of mechanisms. During OA onset, overactivation of osteoclasts
  leads to subchondral bone remodeling, increased angiogenesis and sensory innervation
  invasion. During RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, high expression of MAGI1
  in osteoclasts suppressed the RhoA/ROCK1 signaling pathway, which subsequently inhibited
  NF-κB-mediated osteoclastogenesis (Scheme created with BioRender)
