caption: 'Chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular dysfunction are 3 nontraditional
  risk factors that contribute to CVD risk in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
  Factors related to decreased kidney function in end-stage kidney disease, such as
  uremia, can lead to increased oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, hemodialysis
  brings blood into contact with biomaterials in the dialysis circuit. As a result,
  both the complement and the contact activation pathways can be activated. Hemodialysis-mediated
  complement activation includes binding of mannose binding lectin and ficolin 2 to
  the hemodialysis membrane, leading to activation of the lectin pathway. The lectin
  pathway, which is fundamentally linked to the alternative pathway via MASP-3, is
  also simultaneously activated. The binding of properdin and C3b to the membrane
  may also play a role in activating the alternative pathway. Both the alternative
  and lectin pathways generate C5a and C5b, which attract and activate polymorphonuclear
  cells and monocytes, and mediate activation of the membrane attack complex. Complement
  pathway activation results in inflammation, endothelial injury, oxidative stress,
  and activation of the coagulation system. Surface activation of FXII initiates both
  the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which produces thrombin, and the kallikrein/kinin
  pathway, which generates bradykinin. In addition to its prothrombotic effects, thrombin
  can also contribute to inflammation and atherogenesis via interaction with PAR-1
  and PAR-4, expressed on platelets, and PAR-1, expressed on endothelial cells. Bradykinin
  promotes inflammation by binding to BKR1 or BKR2, resulting in leukocyte stimulation,
  cytokine production, adhesion molecule expression, and NFκB up-regulation. Abbreviations:
  BKR, bradykinin receptor; CVD, cardiovascular disease; FXII, factor XII; MASP-3,
  third MBL-associated serine protease of the lectin pathway; NFκB, nuclear factor-κB;
  PAR, protease-activated receptor.'
