caption: 'Cardiogenic exosomes regulate the cardiovascular system. Cardiogenic EXOs
  regulate the cardiovascular system in both positive and negative ways. Positive
  effect: after cardiovascular system injury, exosomes secreted from heart cells protect
  the cardiovascular system and promotes repair and regeneration. Cardiogenic exosomes
  can inhibit myocardial cell apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of caspase 3/7.
  Cardiogenic EXOs miR-21 blocks the apoptosis pathway by targeting down the expression
  of PDCD4 gene to protect cardiomyocytes. Cardiogenic exosomes miR-210 inhibits cardiac
  apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of its target proteins ephrin A3 and
  PTP1b. Cardiogenic exosomes HSP20 can alleviate fibrosis and promote angiogenesis
  through the Tsg101 pathway. Cardiogenic exosomes also showed significant anti-fibrotic
  activity through the ERK1/2-P38-MAPK signaling pathway. MiR-126-rich cardiogenic
  exosomes can reduce the level of cardiac fibrosis and significantly promote vascular
  formation. Cardiogenic exosomes miR-214, miR-132, and miR-21-5p can inhibit/silence
  the expression of mutated ataxic telangiectasia, RasGAP-P120 and Cdip1 genes, respectively,
  and miR-126 in exosomes released by endothelial progenitor cells can also promote
  angiogenesis by up-regulating the expression of VEGF, thus allowing vascular formation
  and increasing cardiac angiogenesis. In addition, HSP20 contained in cardiomyocyte
  exosomes can promote vascular endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis by
  activating VEGFR2. Negative effects: miR-21-3p and miR-200a in cardiogenic exosomes
  inhibit the expression of SORBS2, PDLIM5, and TSC1 (and this subsequently leads
  to increased mTOR activation) myocardial cell-specific miR-195 is upregulated in
  myocardial cells and transferred to cardiac fibroblasts in the form of exosomal
  cargo, respectively, leading to cardiac hypertrophy. MiR-146a in cardiogenic exosomes
  down-regulates the expression of Erbb4, Notch1, and Irak1, which plays an important
  role in the occurrence of PPCM. During ischemia, cardiogenic exosomes are rich in
  miR-1 and miR-133, which can target Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 and
  affect action potential and cardiac conduction system, thus triggering arrhythmias.
  Cardiogenic exosomes HSP70 can activate monocytes and play an important role in
  atherosclerosis.'
