caption: Proposed model for the synergistic effects by MPP+ and caspase inhibition.
  MPP+inhibits complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, whereas caspase inhibitors
  preserve PARP activation by blocking its cleavage. Complex I inhibition leads to
  a direct depletion of ATP. Overactivation of PARP, a nuclear enzyme activated by
  DNA strand breaks and participating in DNA repair, leads to depletion of the substrate
  of the enzyme, NAD+, and subsequent ATP depletion through the attempts by the cell
  to resynthesize NAD+. ATP depletion prevents completion of the apoptotic program
  because it is a necessary cofactor for caspase-9 activation. An ATP-depleted cell
  that is lethally metabolically impaired but unable to die by apoptosis switches
  to a necrotic form of cell death. Apaf-1, Apoptosis protease activating factor;
  DR3, death receptor-3;FLICE, Fas-associated death domain-like IL-1β converting enzyme;
  MACH, Mort1-associated CED3 homolog.
