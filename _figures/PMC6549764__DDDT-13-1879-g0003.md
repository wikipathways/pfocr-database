caption: '15d-PGJ2 regulates adipocyte differentiation and osteoblast differentiation
  via a PPARγ-dependent pathway. MSCs have the potential to differentiate towards
  adipocytes and osteoblasts, through multiple factors and extracellular signaling
  pathways. Adipogenesis occurs under the strict regulation of multiple transcription
  factors, including PPARγ and C/EBPs, and osteoblastogenesis occurs under the regulation
  of Runx2, Osterix, and Wnt/β-catenin. Activation of PPARγ by 15d-PGJ2 and other
  synthetic ligands can promote adipogenesis but suppress osteoblastogenesis, resulting
  in the inhibition of bone formation.Abbreviations: MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells;
  C/EBPs, CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins; Runx2, runt-related transcription factor
