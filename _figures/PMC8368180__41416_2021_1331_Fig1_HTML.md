caption: Exposure to risk factors causes acute mucosal inflammation primarily mediated
  by TH1 cells. With chronic exposure, inflammation shifts from a TH1 cell response
  to a TH2 cell response, which drives local inflammatory changes in the oesophageal
  epithelium establishing precursor lesions known as dysplasia. Transformation of
  dysplastic lesions to invasive carcinoma is driven by local and systemic factors.
  Locally, elaboration of TH2 cell-mediated inflammatory pathways culminates in recruitment
  of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), M2 macrophages and neutrophils leading
  to pro-survival pathway activation and mutation-inducing DNA damage. Obesity is
  considered a systemic carcinogenic factor which promotes pro-tumorigenic inflammation
  via release of growth factors such as leptin and cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α
  from adipose tissue and macrophages, respectively.
