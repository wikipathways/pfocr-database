caption: Study schema. The two-step process involves the identification of resistance-associated
  signaling node subpopulations followed by testing the predictive value of these
  profiles for disease response in an independent data set. The top portion of the
  diagram shows a time continuum of AML therapy, with A and B representing the time
  points (diagnosis and first relapse after complete response (CR) when samples were
  collected on the two patients for SCNP analysis). The signaling modulators, readouts,
  drug transporters and chemokine receptor tested are listed. The lower portion of
  the schema depicts the application of the chemoresistant profiles to an independent
  data set of 47 patients. CR, complete response; G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating
  factor; IL-27, interleukin-27; Rx, therapy.
