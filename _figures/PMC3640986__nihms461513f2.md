caption: Depending on the cellular context, SRC-3 can coactivate different nuclear
  receptors and transcription factors to promote multiple hallmarks of cancer. SRC-3
  classically facilitates the transcriptional activities of nuclear receptors to promote
  cell growth. It also coactivates E2F-1 to promote cell division. To impact on tumor
  expansion, SRC-3 serves as a coactivator for AP1 to upregulate IGF-Akt pathway and
  may be involved in HER2 pathway. SRC-3 also acts as a pro-metastatic factor by coactivating
  PEA3 and AP1 to upregulate MMP production, a requisite process in extracellular
  matrix breakdown that accompanies invasive tumor behavior. A spliced SRC-3 isoform
  located in cytoplasm can also contribute to metastasis by serving as an adaptor
  for FAK-Src signal pathway. SRC-3 has been implied to bind NFκB and upregulate MIF
  through the HIF transcription factor. This, in turn, contributes to chemoresistance,
  as well as angiogenesis through the FGF signaling pathway. NR, nuclear receptor
  such as ER, PR or AR. The solid arrow indicates direct interaction or known pathways
  while the dotted arrow indicates indirect interaction.
