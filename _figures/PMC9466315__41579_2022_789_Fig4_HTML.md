caption: a | Lassa virus (LASV) double-stranded RNA triggers the type I interferon
  pathway and involves retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5). The exoribonuclease function of nucleoprotein (NP) degrades LASV
  double-stranded RNA, thereby blunting RIG-I and MDA5 activation. LASV Zinc-binding
  (Z) protein binds RIG-I and MDA5 and prevents mitochondrial antiviral signalling
  (MAVS) protein activation of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor
  3 (TRAF3) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which are also involved in interferon
  induction via interferon-responsive factors (IRFs). NP binds RIG-I and IκB kinase-ε
  (IKKε) inhibiting activation of IRFs. NP blocks nuclear factor-κ light-chain enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation. The NF-κB pathway, which is involved in
  activating various aspects of innate immunity, is activated by recognition of LASV
  components via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and involves Toll-interleukin 1 receptor
  (TIR) domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), myeloid differentiation primary
  response 88 (MyD88), various IKKs and IκBα. NP interferes with the p65 subunit of
  NF-κB via an unknown mechanism. In addition to MAVS activating IRFs (via TRAF3/TBK1),
  MAVS activates NF-κB (via TRAF6/IKK complex) independently of TLR signalling (not
  shown). Elements of panel a were inspired by ref. b | LASV evades humoral immunity
  by elaborating a dense glycan shield on the glycoprotein complex (GPC) shown modelled
  onto trimeric LASV GPC [PDB:5VK2],. LASV also blocks or delays class switching from
  IgM that recognizes GPC to anti-GPC IgG. Class switching of anti-NP IgM to IgG is
  not affected. c | Antigen presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells and
  macrophages, phagocytose material from LASV-infected cells in local tissues, degrade
  it and display the resultant peptides (step 1). T cell proliferation requires recognition
  of the displayed peptides by the T cell receptor (TCR; co-receptor CD28 and co-stimulatory
  molecule B7 not shown) (step 2). Proliferation of effector cells is dependent on
  stimulation with cytokines. Direct killing of infected cells by natural killer cells
  or cytotoxic T cells involves recognition of viral peptide–major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) class I complexes (step 3). Effector functions can also involve other
  immune cells (for example, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity). Humans or
  experimental animals that fail to develop effective cellular immunity have a higher
  fatality rate than individuals who develop effective cellular immune responses (step
  4).
