caption: Schematic representation of aberrant FGF/FGFR signaling in breast cancer.
  The FGFR comprises three extracellular immunoglobulin-like subdomains (IgI, IgII,
  and IgIII), a transmembrane α-helix, and an intracellular bilobed cytoplasmic tyrosine
  kinase domain. IgI and IgII are separated by an acidic box. FGFs, which are secreted
  by tumor cells and/or the stromal compartment, bind to membrane-anchored FGFR monomers,
  then induce FGFR dimerization and the phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domains.
  The binding of FGFs to FGFRs is stabilized by heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs).
  Subsequently, the complex leads to the docking of adapter proteins and the activation
  of downstream pathways. For instance, ligand-stimulated FGFRs phosphorylate the
  FGFR-associated cytosolic docking protein FRS2. Once phosphorylated, FRS2 recruits
  Son of Sevenless adapter protein (SOS) and growth factor receptor-bound protein
  (GRB2) to activate rat sarcoma (RAS) and the downstream Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma
  (RAF) and MAPK/ERK Kinase (MEK) pathway. A different complex involves GRB2-associated
  binding protein 1 (GAB1), which recruits phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) that activates
  the Protein Kinase B (AKT) pathway. Phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).
  PIP3 releases calcium, whereas DAG activates protein kinase C, which helps to strengthen
  the activation of the MAPK pathway by phosphorylating RAF in a RAS-independent manner.
  Other cascades may also be activated by FGFRs, such as the signal transducer and
  activator of transcription (STAT)-dependent signaling. The aforementioned effectors
  regulate, in turn, gene expression as well as cell proliferation, migration, invasion,
  and angiogenesis. FGF/FGFR signaling may be down-regulated by receptor internalization
  or through negative regulators such as FGFR-like 1 (FGFRL1), with a similar expression
  to FGF (SEF), Sprouty (SPRY), Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma (CbL), and MAPK phosphatase
  3 (MKP3).
