caption: Model for the control of Noxa and Puma expression during DNA damage–induced
  apoptosis. (A) Model to explain why UVR-induced DNA damage triggers apoptosis in
  E1A/ras transformed MEFs predominantly via Noxa, whereas Puma predominates for apoptosis
  triggered by etoposide-induced DNA damage. X and Y represent distinct signaling
  pathways activated in parallel to the p53 pathway by the two different forms of
  DNA damage. (B) An integrated model of UVR-induced apoptosis. In addition to the
  p53-dependent pathway activated through Noxa and Puma, a p53-independent pathway
  to neutralization of antiapoptotic Bcl-2–like proteins is postulated, based on the
  finding that Bcl-2 overexpression provided p53 −/− E1A/ras transformed MEFs with
  additional protection from UVR. This pathway (Z) may involve both transcriptional
  and posttranslational mechanisms of regulating pro- and antiapoptotic members of
  the Bcl-2 family.
