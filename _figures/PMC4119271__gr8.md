caption: Schematic of G-protein γ subunit translocation embedded motif that regulates
  GPCR-induced calcium oscillation. Presence of two γ subunit types with different
  translocation rates is assumed. In the signaling pathway the positive and negative
  feedbacks yield sustained oscillations similar to the inductor and capacitor in
  a RLC circuit. The translocation of the βγ subunit offers resistance to the oscillations,
  which dampens the response analogous to the electrical circuit. To see this figure
