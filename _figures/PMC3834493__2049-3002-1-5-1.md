caption: Major metabolic fates of glucose in highly proliferative cells. Glucose is
  taken into the cell by GLUT family transporters and then phosphorylated by hexokinases,
  trapping it within the cell as glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). G6P can be catabolized
  via glycolysis or used as a carbon donor for the synthesis of riboses via the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP). Catabolized G6P generates pyruvate plus small quantities
  of ATP, with much of the resultant pyruvate being converted to lactate by lactate
  dehydrogenase and then secreted through mono-carboxylic transporters (MCT). The
  remaining pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoenzymeA (acetyl-CoA) by pyruvate dehydrogenase
  and used either as fuel for ATP production via the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  and oxidative phosphorylation or converted to fatty acids to generate structural
  lipids. At various points during glycolysis and the TCA cycle reaction intermediates
  can be removed to provide carbon for amino acid biosynthesis (not shown).
