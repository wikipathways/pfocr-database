caption: A schematic illustration outlining the mechanism by which PIN operates during
  osteoclastogenesis. PIN disrupts the interaction between RANKL and RANK, resulting
  in the subsequent suppression of both MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Additionally,
  it influences calcium oscillation. These combined effects culminate in the reduction
  of NFATc1 nucleus translocation and the production of ROS
