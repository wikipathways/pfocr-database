caption: Two routes of inorganic phosphate entry into cell catabolism under glycolysis-overflow
  conditions induced by TPS1 deletion. (1) Glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase reaction consumes
  Pi and induces upstream fructose-1,6-bisphosphate processing. This route is expected
  to alleviate glycolytic block. (2) ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)
  consumes Pi; this route can aggravate glycolytic block because ATP contributes to
  the carbohydrate phosphorylation in the upper glycolysis and drives the synthesis
  of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Uncouplers inhibit the second pathway and, therefore,
  may increase the assimilation of Pi via the first route.
