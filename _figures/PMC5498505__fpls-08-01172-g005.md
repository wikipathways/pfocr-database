caption: Biosynthetic pathway of papaverine, noscapine, thebaine, codeine, and morphene
  alkaloids showing perturbation in expression of genes involved in their biosynthesis
  in AEV infected opium poppy plant. The major steps in alkaloid biosynthesis are
  shown here. The genes assessed by qRT-PCR have been bold underlined and obtained
  results have been shown near to them. The major alkaloids (shown in gray shadowing)
  and qRT-PCR of their respective genes has also been shown here. NCS, norcoclaurine
  synthase; CNMT, coclaurine N-methyltransferase, 4′OMT, 3′-hydroxy-N-methyl coclaurine
  4′-O-methyltransferase; N7OMT, norreticuline 7-O-methyltransferase; TNMT, tetrahydroprotoberberine
  cis-N-methyltransferase; BBE, berberine bridge enzyme; SalSyn, salutaridine synthase;
  SalAT, salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase; T6ODM, thebaine 6-O-demethylase; COR,
  codeinone reductase; CODM, codeine O-demethylase.
