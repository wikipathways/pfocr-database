caption: Ligation of T-cell PD-1 by B7-H1 on APC leads to the formation of PD-1/TCR
  microclusters and the subsequent recruitment of SHP2 phosphatases, which dephosphorylate
  multiple members of the TCR signaling pathway. This abrogates downstream effects
  of T-cell activation, including cytokine production, cell-cycle progression, and
  the expression of survival proteins. By preventing T-cell activation, PD-1 signaling
  contributes to the maintenance of tolerance to self-antigens and prevents immune-mediated
  damage of healthy tissue during the resolution of infection and other inflammatory
  responses.
