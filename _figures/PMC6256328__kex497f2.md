caption: 'Schematic overview of phosphatidylcholines to lysophosphatidylcholine metabolic
  pathway in relation to OAPhosphatidylcholines include both acyl-acyl phosphatidylcholine
  and acyl-alkyl phosphatidylcholine, where the latter is an ether lipid and potential
  precursor for synthesis of platelet activating factor. Proinflammatory cytokines
  such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 have their effects either through overactivating the
  expression of PLA2 or independently on cartilage damage and joint pain. PAF: platelet-activating
  factor; PLA2: phospholipase A2.'
