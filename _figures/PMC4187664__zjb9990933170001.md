caption: PIM biosynthetic pathway in mycobacteria. The major PIM species have two
  (PIM2) or six (PIM6) mannose residues with different degrees of acylation. PIM2
  species account for ∼4.5% of the total phospholipids, whereas the abundance of PIM6
  species is ∼10 to 30% the level of PIM2 species (). Two pathways have been proposed
  for the biosynthesis of Ac1PIM2 in the cytoplasmic phase of the plasma membrane.
  Recent analysis suggests that the sequence PI → PIM1 → PIM2 → Ac1PIM2 is favored.
  According to this model, the mannosyltransferase PimA acts first, followed by PimB′
  and then the acyltransferase AcylT1 (). R1, R2, and R3 represent fatty acyl chains.
  In Mycobacterium bovis BCG, major acyl forms contain two palmitic acid residues
  (C16) and one tuberculostearic acid residue (10-methyloctadecanoate, C19) (, ).
  PimC, a GDP-Man-dependent enzyme, has been proposed to catalyze the third step of
  the PIM pathway. However, homologs of this enzyme are missing in other mycobacterial
  strains. It is believed that either PIM2, Ac1PIM2, or Ac1PIM3 is flipped from the
  cytoplasmic side to the periplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane (). The mannosyltransferases
  involved in the biosynthesis of Ac1PIM3 to Ac1PIM6 are dependent on polyprenol-phosphate-mannose
  (PPM) rather than GDP-Man as the mannose donor. PimE is the only PPM-dependent mannosyltransferase
  involved in PIM biosynthesis identified to date, transferring a mannose residue
  to Ac1PIM4 to form Ac1PIM5 (). n.d., not determined.
