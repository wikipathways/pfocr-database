caption: 'Ketamine preferentially targets postsynaptic AMPA/NMDA receptors, while
  riluzole’s antidepressant effects occur through direct regulation, mostly at presynaptic
  voltage-operated channels and glia. All potential targets for new, improved glutamatergic
  agents are described below.Presynaptic targets:Before release, Glu is packaged into
  vesicles by VGLUTs, which control glutamate concentration produced in the synaptic
  vesicles (Target I). Activation of voltage-gated sodium channels (Target II) and
  VOCCs (Target III) depolarizes the plasma membrane, allowing for the influx of sodium
  (through depolarization of axon terminals) and calcium (through interaction with
  the SNARE proteins) (Target IV), leading to the fusion of synaptic vesicles and
  the consequent release of Glu into the synaptic cleft. The type II mGluRs (mGlu2/3)
  are also present presynaptically (Target V), and may directly limit the synaptic
  release of Glu. These mGluRs also mediate feedback inhibition of Glu release, thus
  decreasing the activity of Glu synaptic terminals when the activation of presynaptic
  receptors reaches a certain level.Glia:Glu can also be directly released from glial
  cells, regulating synaptic activity pre-and post-synaptically (Target VI). After
  its release, large amounts of Glu are rapidly distributed across the synaptic cleft,
  where it can bind to glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic regions. The remaining
  unbound Glu is rapidly removed from the synaptic cleft to the presynaptic neuron
  mostly by glia and EAATs. The glial transporters EAAT1 (also known in rodents as
  GLAST) and EAAT2 (or GLT-1) are essential for blocking pathological increases in
  Glu levels (Target VII). Glial Glu transporter expression is upregulated by neuronal
  activity. Notably, the expression of Glu transporters by glial cells and their anatomical
  arrangement within the synaptic cleft can be dynamically and reversibly modified,
  and can directly regulate their ability to scavenge Glu.Postsynaptic neuron:AMPARs
  (GluR1-4) mediate fast Glu neurotransmission and play a major role in learning and
  memory through critical regulation of calcium metabolism, plasticity, and oxidative
  stress. When activated, these receptors open the transmembrane pore, thus allowing
  the influx of sodium and the consequent depolarization of the neuronal membrane
  (Target VIII).The NMDAR channel includes the subunits NR1, NR2 (NR2A—NR2D), and
  NR3 (NR3A and NR3B). Glu’s binding sites have been described mostly in the NR2 subunit,
  whereas the NR1 subunit is the site for its co-agonist, glycine. NR2A and NR2B subunit
  receptors are both highly expressed in brain areas implicated in mood regulation,
  but NMDA receptors containing NR2A mediate faster neurotransmission than NR2B receptors
  (Target IX).The mGluRs include eight receptor subtypes (mGluR1 to mGluR8) classified
  in three groups (I-III) based on their sequence homology and effectors. The mGluRs
  in group I, including mGluR1 and mGluR5, stimulate the breakdown of phosphoinositide
  phospholipids in the cell plasma membrane. mGluRs in Groups II (including mGLuR2/3)
  and III (including mGluRs 4, 6, 7, and 8) limit the generation of cAMP by activating
  inhibitory G-proteins.While Group I receptors are coupled to the phospholipase C
  signal transduction pathway, Group II and III mGluRs are both coupled in an inhibitory
  manner to the adenylyl cyclase pathway, which is involved in regulating the release
  of Glu or other neurotransmitters such as GABA (Target X).KARs are involved in excitatory
  neurotransmission by activating postsynaptic receptors, and in inhibitory neurotransmission
  by modulating GABA release. There are five types of KAR subunits: GluR5 (GRIK1),
  GluR6 (GRIK2), GluR7 (GRIK3), KA1 (GRIK4), and KA2 (GRIK5). GluR5-7 can form heteromers;
  KA1 and KA2 can only form functional receptors by binding with one of the GluR5-7
  subunits. KARs have a more limited distribution in the brain than AMPARs and NMDARs,
  and their function is not well defined; they are believed to affect synaptic signaling
  and plasticity less than AMPARs (Target XI).Cytoplasmic PSD-enriched intracellular
  molecules (e.g. PSD93) interact with Glu receptors at the synaptic membrane to modulate
  receptor activity and signal transduction. PSD95 and similar scaffolding molecules
  link the NMDARs with intracellular enzymes that regulate signaling, and also provide
  a physical connection between diverse neurotransmitter systems to synchronize information
  from different effectors (Target XII).'
