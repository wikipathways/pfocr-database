caption: The TGF-β Signaling Pathway. In the TGF-β ON state (left), a BMP dimer binds
  to two BMPRI and two BMPRII to from a hetero-tetrameric complex. The Type II receptor
  phosphorylates the Type I receptor (not shown), which removes the inhibitory FKBP12
  protein. An R-SMAD, such as SMAD1, binds the Type I receptor and is phosphorylated.
  The phosphorylated R-SMAD then forms a hetero-trimeric complex with SMAD4, the Co-SMAD
  and another SMAD1. The complex migrates to the nucleus where it binds the DNA and
  influences target gene expression. In the TGF-β OFF state (center), the BMP dimer
  is bound by Noggin which blocks binding to the Type II or Type I BMP receptors.
  The receptors remain unassociated, which prevents the phosphorylation of BMPRI.
  Therefore, BMPRI remains bound by FKBP12, which inhibits the phosphorylation of
  the R-SMAD. SMAD4 does not form a complex with the R-SMAD. In Colon Cancer (right),
  with a mutated SMAD4, the BMP ligand remains capable of inducing hetero-tetramer
  formation and phosphorylation of the R-SMAD. However, the mutation inhibits formation
  of the Co-SMAD::R-SMAD complex and the R-SMAD and Co-SMAD is therefore in grey.
  SMAD1 may migrate to the nucleus alone, however the intended function of the Co-SMAD::R-SMAD
  complex is not performed.
