caption: The canonical BMP pathway and its role(s) during vertebrate CNS neurogenesis.
  (A) Representation of the canonical BMP pathway. Dimers of extracellular BMP ligands
  induce the formation of a tetrameric complex of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase
  receptors, in which constitutively active type-2 receptors (black) activate type-1
  receptors (gray) through phosphorylation. Type-1 receptors in turn phosphorylate
  serine residues in the carboxy-terminal tail of SMAD transcription factors (SMAD1,
  SMAD5 or SMAD8/9), enabling them to interact with their co-partner SMAD4. This activated
  SMAD complex thereby enters the nucleus, recruits co-factors and regulates the transcription
  of target genes, such as members of the ID family. The duration of exposure to BMPs
  and their concentration are therefore converted into different levels and/or durations
  of transcriptional activity. (B–D) The canonical BMP activity dictates neural stem
  cell (NSC) divisions during neurogenesis in the vertebrate CNS. (B) During spinal
  neurogenesis, high levels of SMAD1/5 activity instruct NSCs (green disks) located
  in the ventricular zone (VZ) to self-amplify, whereas low levels force NSCs to undergo
  self-consuming divisions, hence depleting their pool and producing neurons (red
  stars) that will delaminate and migrate toward the mantle zone (MZ). Intermediate
  levels are proposed to instruct self-renewing neurogenic divisions. (C) During cortical
  neurogenesis, high levels of SMAD1/5 activity stimulate NSC self-amplification,
  whereas lower SMAD1/5 levels force them to produce neurons that will migrate to
  the cortical plate (CP). In this region, neurogenesis can occur either directly
  or indirectly, the latter case giving rise to transit-amplifying basal progenitors
  (yellow disks) that undergo self-consuming divisions in the subventricular zone
  (SVZ). Whether the modes of direct and indirect neurogenesis are instructed by comparable
  or distinct thresholds of SMAD1/5 activity remains unknown. (D) In the adult mammalian
  hippocampus, NSCs located in the sub-granular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus are
  instructed to remain quiescent (blue disk) in response to canonical BMP signaling.
  Reducing its activity forces the activation of NSCs, which might self-amplify for
  several rounds before undergoing self-consuming divisions that produce transit-amplifying
  progenitors. These in turn produce adult-born neurons that will populate the granule
  cell layer (GCL). Whether the distinct modes of division that activated NSCs undergo
  are instructed by comparable or distinct thresholds of SMAD1/5 activity remains
  unknown.
