caption: The metabolic pathway interaction network of Cluster-0 metabolite (4-hydroxybenzoic
  acid). (A) The KEGG pathway for 4-hydroxybenzoic acid involvement in oxidative phosphorylation
  is distinctly highlighted in a pink color. (B) In the STITCH interaction network
  for 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, Coenzyme Q2 (COQ2) and Coenzyme Q6 (COQ6), along with
  CA II, emerge as the nearest and most robust interaction partners, depicted by prominent
  green lines
