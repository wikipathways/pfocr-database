caption: Model for redox-regulated platelet CD36 prothrombotic signaling. Recognition
  of oxLDL by platelet CD36 induces a signaling pathway that involves the activation
  of Src family kinases, NOX, and accumulation of O2•− and H2O2. Generation of these
  ROS lead to the activation of redox sensitive MAPK ERK5 through a mechanism that
  is not yet clear. ERK5 activation promotes platelet integrin activation, aggregation,
  and thrombus formation in conditions of hyperlipidemia and oxidant stress.
