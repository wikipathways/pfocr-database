caption: PKCε action in transformed cells. The Topo2-dependent arrest in G2 is indicated
  diagrammatically in the context of a normal cell cycle. The switch to a PKCε-dependent
  pathway (red) occurs in cells failing to arrest (see text). This leads to a series
  of delays under the control of PKCε as indicated. These are implemented by distinct
  mechanisms (see text for a more detailed discussion). Resolution of non-disjunction
  stress enables the maintenance of chromosomal integrity and the completion of division;
  failure to resolve produces division failure and/or chromosome damage. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)
