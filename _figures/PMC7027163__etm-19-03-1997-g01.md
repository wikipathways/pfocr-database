caption: ERK MAPK signalling pathway. The kinase-mediated ERK MAPK signalling is sequentially
  activated by phosphorylation. ERK1/2 at the terminal kinases in MAPK signalling
  can translocate to the nucleus to regulate transcription programs, and mediate growth,
  migration and differentiation. The phosphorylated forms of MEK and ERK are indicated
  by white circles. Membrane Receptors are presented by grey shapes. Ligands are represented
  by white triangles. The cytoplasmic receptor is indicated by a thick black arrow.

  2; p, phosphorylated.
