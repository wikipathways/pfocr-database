caption: The gut microbiota is separated from the intestinal epithelium by a thin
  layer of mucus, secreted by Goblet cells in a microbiota- and NLRP6-dependent manner.
  The mucus layer has a different structure in small and large intestine (not depicted
  in the figure). Microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPS) can be sensed by
  IECs as well as by myeloid cells in the lamina propria and induce a variety of effects,
  including tissue repair, and production of antimicrobial peptides such as RegIIIγ
  in intestinal epithelial and Paneth cells through a DC-ILC axis. Luminal ATP and
  SAA/IL1β produced by IECs and DCs in response to adhesion of segmented filamentous
  bacteria (SFB) promote Th17 development. Antigens presented during this process
  are largely derived from SFB. Treg induction is also regulated by bacterial cues.
  Clostridia of the IV and XIVa groups induce Tregs in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Short
  chain fatty acids (SCFA) promote Treg differentiation by acting directly on T cells
  and indirectly on DCs. Macrophages in the lamina propria are involved in a pathway
  that includes also ILCs (not shown) resulting in production of IL-10 and Retinoic
  Acid (RA), and also sustaining expansion of Tregs. All pathways illustrated in the
  figure were shown to be affected by the use of antibiotics, leading to a lack of
  homeostasis, an increased sensitivity to infection and an increase in the severity
  of various conditions, as in the case of allergy.
