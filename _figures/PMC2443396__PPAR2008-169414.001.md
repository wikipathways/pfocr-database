caption: Simplified scheme of the role of M1 macrophages in inflammation-driven carcinogenesis
  and the potential anticarcinogenic effect of PPAR ligands. In the context of chronic
  pathogen infection or chemically induced chronic inflammation, exogenous and/or
  endogenous ligands for Toll-like receptors are present, which stimulate NF-κB activation
  via the MyD88 pathway. Also inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β stimulate
  NF-κB activatity through their respective cytokine receptors (CRs). Subsequently,
  NF-κB transcribes a number of carcinogenic mediators, including IL-6, TNFα, COX-2,
  and iNOS amongst others. PPAR ligands are able to interfere with the induction of
  these inflammatory mediators, using different mechanisms. Activated PPARγ tranrepresses
  NF-κB activity, activated PPARα physically interacts with NF-κB, and activated PPARβ/δ
  unleashes the transcriptional repressor Bcl-6. Note that the anticarcinogenic actions
  of the PPAR agonists are only seen in inflammatory tumorigenesis but not in noninflammatory
  carcinogenesis.
