caption: Parameter estimates from the best-fitting common pathway model for cannabis,
  stimulant and sedative abuse in Swedish male–male twin and near-aged sibling pairs.
  (A, C and E) refer, respectively, to additive genetic, shared environmental, and
  unique environmental risk factors. The subscript “c” refers to risk factors on the
  common latent factor, here labeled “vulnerability to drug abuse.” The subscript
  “s” refers to risk factors specific to the abuse of individual substance classes.
  The paths from the common latent factor to the individual forms of drug abuse reflect
  the degree to which those forms of drug abuse index the liability to the latent
  factor.
