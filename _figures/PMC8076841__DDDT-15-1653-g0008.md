caption: Potential interaction loop among mitochondrial function, the Ca2+/CaMK signaling
  pathway, and the ROCK pathway. FDCA inhibited hypoxia-induced PASMC proliferation,
  migration, and contraction by restoring mitochondrial function, reducing [Ca2+]i,
  and inhibiting the Ca2+/CaMK activity and the ROCK pathway activity.
