caption: Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 are cell surface
  receptors whereas TLR3 and TLR7-9 are intracellular receptors. Most TLRs utilize
  the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, except for TLR3, which signals through TRIF.
  Ligand binding to TLRs triggers the formation of homodimers. TLR2 forms heterodimers
  with TLR1 or TLR6. TLR2 and TLR4 interact with MyD88 via the bridging adaptor TIRAP.
  TLR4 also signals via the TRIF pathway and utilizes the bridging adaptor TRAM. Activation
  of the MyD88 signaling pathway leads to the activation of MAPKs resulting in AP-1
  dependent transcription. Activation of IKK complex causes the translocation of NF-κB
  to the nucleus and initiation of NF-κB-mediated transcription. Translocation of
  IRF5 to the nucleus promotes IRF5-dependent transcription. Activation of the TRIF
  pathway induces either IRF3- and IRF7-dependent transcription, or AP-1, NF-κB and
  IRF5-dependent transcription through TRAF6. This leads to pro-inflammatory cytokine
  and Type 1 IFNs expression and release. AP-1, activator protein 1; IFN, interferon;
