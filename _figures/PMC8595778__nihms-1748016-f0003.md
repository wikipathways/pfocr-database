caption: Schematic depicting cholesterol synthesis and the negative feedback pathway
  that controls LDL and cholesterol production.LDL receptor mutations resulting in
  familial hypercholesterolemia are both the first and most well-understood cholesterol
  handling mutations. While familial hypercholesterolemia is a rare disease, untreated
  individuals suffer from an up to 20-fold increased risk for CAD and heightened risk
  of fatal heart attacks due to elevated LDL-cholesterol levels. Further mutations
  have been described in the LDL particle itself. More than 100 mutations have been
  characterized in APOB, a key recognition signal of the LDL particle used by LDL
  receptors (LDLR). Defects in APOB reduce LDLR uptake and impair the production of
  APOB containing lipoproteins.More recently, PCKS9 mutations have taken center stage
  due to their role in LDLR recycling. PCSK9 shares the same domain as LDLR on the
  plasma membrane. When both an LDLR and PCSK9 protein are taken up in the endosome,
  the LDL receptor is targeted for lysosomal degradation. However, when PCSK9 is not
  present, the LDL receptor is returned to the plasma membrane, where it can take
  up additional LDL particles. Both gain and loss of function PCSK9 mutations exist;
  gain-of-function mutations increase, while loss-of-function mutations decrease,
  serum LDL-cholesterol. The ‘cholesterol-sensing’ process involves intricate machinery
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), including the sterol sensor SCAP and its partners
  insulin induced gene-1 (INSIG1) and sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP),
  which translate changes in ER cholesterol to altered gene expression.
