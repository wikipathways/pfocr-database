caption: We evaluated the connectivity of the 54-gene breast cancer network signature
  to itself through permutation resampling of the PPI controlling for hubness. Nodes
  which had an empiric p-value of <0.05 were retained. KEGG pathways cell cycle, p53
  signaling, ErbB2 signaling and focal adhesion were then overlaid onto the network
  facilitating a visual “roadmap” among signatures (squares), breast cancer signatures
  (circles), and breast cancer background genes (triangles). Breast cancer signature
  genes that were also included in the breast cancer background gene list are represented
  by hexagons. For example, multifunctional node CDKN1A (cell cycle/ErbB2/focal adhesion)
  connects the cluster of three metastasis gene signatures anchored by COL1A1 to the
  “histologic grade” and “invasiveness” signatures.
