caption: Reciprocal regulation of TGFβ and Jak-Stat signaling. Crosstalk between IFNγ-
  and TGFβ1- induced signaling pathways. IFNγ activates JAK-STAT1 pathway, increasing
  pSTAT1tyr, which will translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of several
  cytokines and other mediators and receptors involved in inflammatory activation.
  In addition, it will also activate pERKs and to a lesser extent pP38. ERK and P38
  MAPKs potentiate STAT1 activation and induce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),
  increasing production of NO, as well as production of . IFNγ-induced signaling pathway
  inhibits TGFβ1-Smad signaling by inducing its endogenous inhibitor Smad7 (see Figure
  ) and through inhibition by ERK. On the other hand, TGFβ1, through the activation
  of the Smad3 pathway, inhibits IFNγ-induced STAT1 activation via a MKP-1-mediated
  inhibition of ERK1/2 and iNOS expression, reducing production of NO and . In aging,
  there are increased levels of IFNγ, inhibiting activation of the TGFβ1-Smad signaling
  pathway, as well as a reduced activation of TGFβ1-Smad, which will result in a reduced
  regulation of MAPKs (and NF-κB pathways as shown in the previous figure).
