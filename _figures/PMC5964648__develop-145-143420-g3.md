caption: UPRmt and stem cell regulation. Mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins
  are encoded by both the nuclear (green) and mitochondrial (red) genomes. Mitonuclear
  protein imbalance and proteotoxic stress, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitogenesis
  can all lead to mitochondrial stress, which activates the mitochondrial unfolded
  protein response (UPRmt). Retrograde UPRmtsignaling, through prohibitin 1 and 2
  (PHB and PHB2) and/or c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK2) and the protein kinase
  RNA-activated (PKR)-activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) pathway () can specifically
  regulate nuclear gene expression to generate more chaperones and proteases to alleviate
  proteotoxic stress. UPRmt-induced gene expression changes also lead to stem cell
  proliferation and a delayed senescence response. Pathways with the question marks
  are speculative and require further experimental confirmation. Solid and dashed
  arrows indicate direct and indirect pathway/links, respectively. NR, nicotinamide
  riboside; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide.

  description: UPRmt and stem cell regulation. Mitochondrial electron transport chain
    proteins are encoded by both the nuclear (green) and mitochondrial (red) genomes.
    Mitonuclear protein imbalance and proteotoxic stress, mitochondrial dynamics,
    and mitogenesis can all lead to mitochondrial stress, which activates the mitochondrial
    unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Retrograde UPRmtsignaling, through prohibitin
    1 and 2 (PHB and PHB2) and/or c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK2) and the protein
    kinase RNA-activated (PKR)-activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) pathway ()
    can specifically regulate nuclear gene expression to generate more chaperones
    and proteases to alleviate proteotoxic stress. UPRmt-induced gene expression changes
    also lead to stem cell proliferation and a delayed senescence response. Pathways
    with the question marks are speculative and require further experimental confirmation.
