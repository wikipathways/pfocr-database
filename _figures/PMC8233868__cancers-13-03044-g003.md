caption: 'Decrease in citrulline level has been observed for many soft tissue sarcomas.
  Citrulline belongs to the arginine metabolic pathway: it is produced by enterocytes
  from glutamine and is released into the blood, where is taken up by the kidney for
  the synthesis of arginine or is transported to the liver where it participates in
  the transformation of ammonia to urea. Abbreviations: CPS, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase;
  ASS, argininosuccinate synthase; AL, argininosuccinate lyase; AR, arginase; OTC,
  ornithine transcarbamoylase.'
