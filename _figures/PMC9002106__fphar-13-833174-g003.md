caption: 'Functional enrichment analysis. UMAPs show the most significant genes per
  lung cell type involved in biological processes and signaling pathways. The most
  significant (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR q-value < 0.001) biological term was inflammatory
  response, followed by cytokine production, innate immune response, macrophage activation,
  Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, interferon production, JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, TNF signaling pathway,
  blood coagulation, oncostatin M signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, IL-1
  and megakaryocytes in obesity, and NLRP3 inflammasome complex. UMAP: uniform manifold
  approximation and projection for dimension reduction.'
