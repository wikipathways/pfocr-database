caption: Naive T cell activation via the T cell receptor (TCR) and signalling through
  the co-receptor CD28 leads to the rapid activation of the canonical nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) pathway, which contributes to the initial activation and clonal expansion
  of T cells. T cell activation is associated with TCR stimulation and the inducible
  expression of several TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily members such as CD27, CD30,
  OX40 and 41BB, which mediate the activation of non-canonical NF-κB signalling upon
  ligation by their ligands on antigen-presenting cells and activated T cells. Non-canonical
  NF-κB signalling is crucial for the generation and maintenance of effector and memory
  T cells and also has a role in mediating the induction of effector cytokines,,.
  Since TNFRs also activate canonical NF-κB signalling, it is likely that the two
  pathways function cooperatively during the effector and memory phases of T cell
  responses.
