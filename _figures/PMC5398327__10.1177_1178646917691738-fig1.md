caption: The major components of the kynurenine and serotonergic/melatonergic pathways
  and their interactions. The initial conversion of tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase
  leads to the synthesis of serotonin and melatonin. When stress and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines are increased, inducing TDO and IDO, respectively, tryptophan is driven
  down the kynurenine pathway leading to the increased synthesis of tryptophan catabolites.
  IDO indicates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; TDO, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenease.
