caption: Mechanistically, ROBO1 interacted with G3BP2 and eIF3A to form heterocomplex
  and accelerated eIF3A degradation through activating lysosome signaling pathway
  in ESCC cells. Under irradiation exposure, free eIF3A inactivated mTOR signaling
  and downreglated its downstream DNA nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes expression
  through directly promoting P53 translation, which finally attenuated ESCC radioresistance
  and retarded cancer severity
