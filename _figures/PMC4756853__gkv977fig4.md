caption: 'Pathways involved in thymidine synthesis in Escherichia coli, Drosophila
  melanogaster and humans. Key steps in dNTP synthesis focusing on the de novo thymidylate
  biosynthesis are shown (directly involved enzymes underlined). Dashed arrow shows
  pathways only present in E. coli. Inhibitors of the pathway are shown in red. 5FdUMP
  (5-fluorodeoxyuridylate), the metabolite of 5FU and 5FdUR, along with raltitrexed
  (RTX) inhibits thymidylate synthase (TYMS) while methotrexate (MTX) inhibits dihydrofolate
  reductase (DHFR). The enzyme responsible for dCTP-dCMP conversion in mammals is
  DCTPP1 (dCTP pyrophosphatase 1) (), however, using a BLAST search, no clearcut homologue
  could be identified in D. melanogaster, hence we did not include it in this Figure.
  In E. coli, the nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase MAZG is responsible
  for this activity (). Abbreviations are as follows: DCD: dCTP deaminase, DCTD: dCMP
  deaminase, DUT: dUTPase, DHF: dihydrofolate, DHFR: dihydrofolate reductase, MTHF:
  5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate, NDPK: nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, NK: nucleoside
  kinase, MAZG: nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase, NMPK: nucleoside monophosphate
  kinase, SHMT: serine hydroxymethyltransferase, THF: tetrahydrofolate, TYMK: dTMP
  kinase, TYMS: thymidylate synthase.'
