caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway in CSCs. (By Figdraw). Hh ligands (such as Sonic
  Hedgehog, Indian Hedgehog, and Desert Hedgehog) bind to the Patched-1 (Ptch1) receptor,
  relieving its inhibition on Smoothened (Smo). This leads to the activation of downstream
  signaling cascades, including the Glioma-associated oncogene homolog (Gli) transcription
  factors. In CSCs, dysregulated Hh signaling can promote self-renewal, proliferation,
  survival, and resistance to therapy. Additionally, the Hh pathway has been implicated
  in maintaining the stemness and plasticity of CSCs, as well as promoting tumor initiation,
  progression, and metastasis
