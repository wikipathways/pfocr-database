caption: 'Schematic of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. The main TCR signaling pathways
  incorporated into mechanistic computational models are shown here. Purple: Antigen
  discrimination: the TCR alpha/beta (α/β) chains bind to an antigen displayed on
  a major histocompatibility complex on a diseased cell; the CD3 chains are associated
  with the TCR. Blue: Intracellular receptor phosphorylation: various kinases, such
  as lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), CSK, and ZAP-70, and phosphatases,
  such as SHP-1, SHP2, and CD45, influence the phosphorylation of state of the CD3
  immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR. These molecules
  can either phosphorylate or dephosphorylate the TCR directly, influence the activity
  of a molecule that directly acts on the TCR, or bind to phosphorylated ITAMs to
  protect them from dephosphorylation. Gold: LAT signalosome: many different adaptor
  proteins and kinases bind together in the LAT signalosome to activate downstream
  signaling pathways. Teal: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: the MAPK
  pathway acts as a positive feedback to prevent LCK association with the phosphatase
  SHP-1, as well as activate downstream transcription factors. Solid lines represent
  direct activity, dashed lines represent indirect activity, arrows represent phosphorylation
  events, and blunted lines represent dephosphorylation events. Red lines are inhibitory
  mechanisms, and teal lines are positive feedback mechanisms.'
