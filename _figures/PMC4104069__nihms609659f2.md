caption: KSHV encodes viral interferon regulatory factors (vIRF 1-3) that antagonize
  the function of cellular IRFs, p300, and NFκB to suppress production of type I IFN.
  ORF45, RTA, and KbZIP have also been shown to interfere with IRF signaling. K3 and
  K5 are able to degrade the IFN3γR1 to reduce antiviral IFNγ signaling through the
  JAK/STAT pathway. Viral infection and expression of vGPCR reduces TLR4 expression,
  and RTA can induce degradation of the TLR3 and TLR4 mediator TRIF. miR-K12-9 and
  5 downregulate IRAK1 and MYD88 which are also components of TLR signaling pathways.
  Reduction of TLR signaling results in reduced expression of type I IFN. Finally,
  ORF64 is able to deubiquitinate RIG-I which suppresses RIG-I mediated production
  of IFNβ.
