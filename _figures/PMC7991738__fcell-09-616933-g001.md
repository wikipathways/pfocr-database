caption: 'Mechanism of apoptosis regulation via Cl− channels in ESCC cell. CLIC1 inhibits
  apoptosis via TLR2/JNK pathway. ANO9 inhibits apoptosis via centrosome-related genes,
  such as CEP120, CNTRL, and SPAST.LRRC8A inhibits apoptosis via PI3K/Akt signaling.
  CLCN2 induces apoptosis via IFN signaling. CFTR induces apoptosis in ESCC via activation
  of the p38 signaling pathway. Lubiprostone functions as activator of CLCN2 and CFTR,
  and increases apoptosis in ESCC cells. Lubiprostone is used in the management of
  idiopathic chronic constipation in patients with cancers, particularly those using
  opioid analgesics. ESCC: esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; CLIC1, chloride intracellular
  channel 1; ANO9, anoctamin 9; LRRC8A, leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8A;
  CLCN2, chloride channel 2; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.'
