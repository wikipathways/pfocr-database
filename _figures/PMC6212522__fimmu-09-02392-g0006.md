caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism of action of PIAS in the regulation
  of the STAT signaling pathway. C-type lectin, with CTL and CC domains, recognizes
  bacteria and interacts with Domelee, and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is activated.
  JAK phosphorylates STAT. The phosphorylated STAT enters the nucleus and binds to
  the promoters of AMP genes to regulate their transcriptions (). PIAS negatively
  regulates STAT by inhibiting STAT phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in the
  JAK/STAT signaling pathway.
