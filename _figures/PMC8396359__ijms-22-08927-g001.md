caption: The core apoptosis pathway in mammals and Drosophila. During activation of
  the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in mammalian cells, apoptotic stimuli cause expression
  of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members resulting in the perturbation of the mitochondrial
  outer membrane and release of small molecules including cytochrome c, Omi/HtrA2
  and Smac/DIABLO. Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 forming the apoptosome which recruits
  the pro-caspase-9 leading to its activation. Meanwhile, Omi/HtrA2 and Smac/DIABLO
  act as IAP antagonists to free caspases from the inhibition of apoptotic proteins
  such as XIAP. Active caspase-9 cleaves and activates caspase-3 and -7, allowing
  execution of apoptosis. The mammalian extrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated upon
  ligand binding to death receptor, e.g., Fas. Adaptor protein FADD recruitment to
  Fas forms the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) which binds and activates
  caspase-8. Active caspase-8 cleaves and activates caspase-3 and caspase-7, allowing
  execution of apoptosis. In the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in Drosophila, apoptotic
  stimuli activate expression of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Reaper, Hid and Grim
  which need to localise to the mitochondria to become fully activated. These pro-apoptotic
  proteins release caspases from DIAP1 held inhibition. The initiator caspase Dronc
  then associates with the scaffold protein Dark to form an apoptosome-like complex.
  Active Dronc cleaves executioner caspases, DrICE and Dcp-1, which bring about apoptosis.
  The Drosophila extrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated by binding of Eiger to the
  death receptors Wengen or Grindelwald, resulting in activation of the JNK signalling
  pathway. Active JNK signalling induces expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, Hid
  and Reaper. The evolutionarily conserved core components in the apoptosis pathway
  are highlighted with the dashed line boxes.
