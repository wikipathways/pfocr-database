caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway. Schematic representation of the Hedgehog signaling
  pathway. (Left side) Hedgehog signaling is inactive in the absence of Hedgehog ligand
  on the Patched (Ptch) receptor. Smoothened (SMO) is restrained from cell membrane
  anchoring. Suppressor of fused (SUFU) direct the proteasomal cleavage of transcription
  factors Gli1 and Gli3 to their repressor form; R-Gli2 and R-Gli3. These transcriptional
  repressors translocate to the nucleus to block target gene expression. (Right side)
  Hedgehog signaling is activated upon binding of either three of the N-terminal domains
  (HhN) of the Hedgehog ligands to the Hedgehog (Hh) receptor complex composed out
  of Ptch and co-receptor BOC/CDO. SMO fuses with the cell membrane and binds SUFU
  with the bound Gli2 transcription factor. Gli2 is released and undergoes proteasomal
  degradation to it activator A-Gli2 form which translocates to the nucleus to drive
  target gene expression. Gli1 is transcribed and reinforces the Hedgehog signaling
  as a transcriptional activator.
