caption: Fig. 8. Model of LTβR- and TNFR-I-mediated activation of NF-κB. Signaling
  through TNFR-I activates the NF-κB pathway involving the β and γ subunits of the
  IKK complex. Nuclear translocation and DNA binding of p50–RelA heterodimers is accomplished
  through IκBα phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This pathway also
  upregulates the expression of RelB and the p52 precursor, p100, resulting in the
  specific inhibition of RelB by the C-terminal IκBδ domain of p100. Membrane-bound
  LTα1β2 heterodimers, on the other hand, activate LTβR, which also results in the
  induction of RelA complexes, but the requirement for IKK subunits differs from the
  TNFR pathway. Importantly, LTβR signaling triggers the degradation of p100 in a
  NIK- and IKKα-dependent manner. As a consequence, p52–RelB heterodimers accumulate
  in the nucleus and regulate genes that are crucial for the normal development of
  lymphoid organs.
