caption: 'The main proposed mechanisms by which HERVs and L1s may cause immune responses
  that could escalate to autoimmune disease if they become chronic or recurring. (A)
  starting at the bottom (intracellularly): environmental or internal factors first
  reduce the suppressive DNA methylation of 5’ LTRs allowing transcription factors
  such as those regulated by female hormones to actively transcribe one or several
  HERV loci. The resulting transcripts are spliced and processed and some of them
  are translated into proteins, while others can associate with antisense RNA, small
  interfering RNAs of the miRNA or piRNA classes, or form internal loop structures
  that are recognized by ZBP-1 (or other sensors or RNase-based enzymes), which can
  signal through IRF3 to IFN production or, alternatively, via the RIP3 kinase pathway
  to cell death by necroptosis. HERV proteins can assemble into more or less complete
  virions that may remain exposed on the cell surface or even bud off as mature virions.
  These proteins can be degraded and processed for antigen-presentation on class I
  or II MHC molecules to activate T cells and B cells to generate both cellular and
  humoral immunity. Both arms target cells expressing the relevant HERV for immune
  attack. (B) L1 may drive a similar immune response, except that the ORF2p RT can
  generate intracellular DNA to directly trigger cGAS or other DNA sensors resulting
  in type I IFN production (primarily IFNβ). Another unique feature of L1 biology
  is the assembly of the two L1 proteins with other RNA binding proteins, many of
  which are well-known autoantigens, into aggregates that also contain L1 RNA and
  other RNA species, such as Alu element RNA or processed mRNAs. These bodies may
  also contain DNA newly synthesized by the ORF2p RT and hence will even more resemble
  virions if they are released from dying cells. This would result in an immune response
  and autoantibodies against several of their components, such as Ro60, in addition
  to the L1 proteins themselves. Lastly, such autoantibodies would further promote
  the uptake of L1 protein/RNA/DNA complexes by FcγR-expressing immune cells, including
  plasmacytoid dendritic cells and further stimulate type I IFN production (primarily
  IFNα) through TLR pathways. In all these scenarios, the repeated boosting of anti-HERV
  or anti-L1 immune responses would lead to increasingly powerful immune-mediated
  destruction of the cells that express them. Disease-relevant pathways are indicated
  with black boxes.'
