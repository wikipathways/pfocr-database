caption: Proposed model of glycogen phosphorylase regulation by epidermal growth factor
  receptor in human Kit 225 T cells. EGFR activation leads to the activation of the
  canonical RAS MAPK pathway through the GRB2–SOS complex. The results presented here
  document an additional signaling pathway also stimulated by EGF, which is RAS-dependent
  and MAPK-independent. This new signaling cascade outlines a novel regulation of
  the ADCY6/PKA/PK/PYG canonical pathway by a receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase
  activity (EGFR), which involves the RAS–EPAC2–RAP1–RAF1 pathway.
