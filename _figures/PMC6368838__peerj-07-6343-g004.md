caption: The pink and green nodes represent the important genes identified by previous
  analysis and the transcription factors that have regulatory relationships, respectively.
  Some important genes were not pictured in the network because they were single node,
  which means that no transcription factor linked to them. The different colored arrows
  indicate the genes regulated by different transcription factors, making the results
  easier to observe.
