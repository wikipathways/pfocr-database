caption: Metabolic subtypes and patient survival outcomes in PDAC. The illustration
  depicts different metabolic subtypes characterized based on the mRNA expression
  profiles of genes involved in glycolysis or cholesterogenesis. Patients with high
  tumoral expression of genes in the glycolysis pathway fall in the glycolytic cohort
  that shows the worst patient outcomes. Patients with increased tumoral expression
  of genes in the cholesterogenesis or sterol biosynthesis have the best survival
  outcomes. Patients with low gene expression for both the pathways and high expression
  of both the pathways show trends for intermediate survival.
