caption: Cancer-relevant pathways affected by HSP70. (A) HSP70 inhibits the intrinsic
  and extrinsic apoptosis pathways, by inhibiting BAX translocation to mitochondria,
  the recruitment of APAF-1 to the apoptosome, the activity of stress-induced kinases
  and the function of AIF-1. (B) HSP70 inhibits both p53-dependent and -independent
  senescence. (C) HSP70 localizes to lysosome membranes specifically in cancer cells,
  stabilizes lysosome function and allows for autophagy, a key cancer survival pathway.
  (D) HSP70 is an obligate co-chaperone for HSP90 and is essential for the proper
  folding and function of HSP90 chaperone proteins like HER2, AKT, CDK4 and C-RAF.
