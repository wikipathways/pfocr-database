caption: 'Reaction mediated by Mpr1. (A) Scheme for the AZC acetyltransferase reaction
  by Mpr1. (*) l-Arginine biosynthesis mediated by Mpr1. Mpr1 might convert l-Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
  (P5C)/l-glutamate-γ-semialdehyde (GSA) into N-acetyl-GSA, which is the intermediate
  of l-arginine synthesis by its reaction. Protein names: Arg2, l-glutamate N-acetyltransferase;
  Arg5, N-acetyl-l-glutamyl-phosphate reductase; Arg6, N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase;
  Arg8, N-acetyl-l-ornithine aminotransferase.'
