caption: ErbB Receptors. There are 4 members of the ErbB receptor family, all of which
  are transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors. All except ErbB2 are ligand activated
  receptors. ErbB receptors signal through canonical pathways including PI3 kinase,
  phospholipase C, and ras. Erbb4 and its activating ligand neuregulin (NRG) are important
  regulators of alveolar epithelial type II cell maturation and surfactant production.
  Erbb4 is unique because can also signal via a pathway that involves two separate
  cleavage processes and subsequent nuclear localization (see Fig. )
