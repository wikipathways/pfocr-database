caption: Cartoon depicting the mechanism by which RASAL2 and DAB2IP regulate invasion,
  EMT, and metastasis in breast cancer. DAB2IP and RASAL2 both possess catalytic RasGAP
  domains. Accordingly, loss of RASAL2 and DAB2IP together potently activate all three
  major Ras isoforms and downstream effectors (although when all Ras isoforms are
  expressed they appear to exert more potent effects on K- and H-Ras). Loss of RASAL2
  and DAB2IP also potently activates NF-κB. NF-κB activation requires the loss of
  DAB2IP, which directly affects the NF-κB pathway through its period-like domain,
  however NF-κB activity is further enhanced by Ras pathway activation. Our studies
  further suggest that while Ras activation drives invasion, NF-κB is required for
  EMT and metastasis. We hypothesize that it is the combined and potent activation
  of these two important signaling pathways that underlies the aggressive and metastatic
  nature of luminal B breast cancers that have lost both DAB2IP and RASAL2.
