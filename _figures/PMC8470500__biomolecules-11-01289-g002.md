caption: The role of immune cells and inflammatory cytokines in (A) rheumatoid arthritis,
  (B) diabetes, and (C) multiple sclerosis. A. Activated CD4 T-cells play an important
  role in RA pathogenesis and osteoclastogenesis by producing IL-17 cytokine, which
  subsequently induces RANKL on synovial fibroblasts and activates local inflammation,
  upregulating secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1 by
  synoviocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. These inflammatory cytokines activate
  osteoclastogenesis by inducing RANKL on synovial fibroblasts or directly acting
  on osteoclast precursor cells. The increased cytokine production, especially TNF-
  and IL-1, stimulates synoviocytes, stress oxidation, and osteoclastogenesis. Moreover,
  Th17 cells also express RANKL on their cellular membrane, which partly contributes
  to the enhanced osteoclastogenesis. B. Various inflammatory cells involved in islet
  inflammation include macrophages as critical mediators via secreting TNF-a, IL-1b,
  and ROS. Autoreactive CD4 effector T-cells induce the inflammatory processes by
  release TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ cytokines, leading to the recruitment of CD8+T cells
  and macrophages. Moreover, NK, DCs, and NKT cells may have a partial role in the
  whole process via inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. C. Activated macrophages
  by pathogens resulted in the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, subsequently
  inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radical production. Moreover, the numbers
  of Th1 and Th17 cells and their cytokines such as IL-17, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and
  IFN-γ are increased. Finally, the produced inflammatory and RNS/ROS mediators resulted
  in destroying the structure of the myelin sheath and neurons.
