caption: Angiotensin peptides are derived from the precursor protein angiotensinogen
  through several enzymatic conversion pathways. The decapeptide angiotensin I (AngI)
  is formed by renin acting upon the amino terminal of angiotensinogen. AngI serves
  as a substrate for angiotensin converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1), a zinc metalloprotease
  that hydrolyzes the carboxyl terminal dipeptide His-Leu to form the octapeptide
  angiotensin II (AngII). AngII is converted to the heptapeptide angiotensin III (AngIII)
  by aminopeptidase A (APA) and aspartyl aminopeptidase (ASAP), which cleaves the
  Asp residue at the N-terminal. Aminopeptidase N (APN) and/or aminopeptidase B (APB)
  cleaves Arg at the N-terminal of AngIII to form the hexapeptide angiotensin IV (AngIV).
  AngIV can be further converted to inactive peptide fragments and amino acid constituents.
  Angiotensins exert their actions through the different angiotensin receptor subtypes
  AT1, AT2 and AT4. The AT4 receptor has been proposed to be the insulin-regulated
  aminopeptidase (IRAP) or the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met receptor system.
  Other conversion steps are also shown. A separate pathway for the synthesis of AngIII,
  independent of AngII formation, is via the nonapeptide [des-Asp1]AngI, formed from
  AngI by ASAP. This nonapeptide is converted directly to AngIII via ACE-1. A third
  route involves the ACE-1 homolog ACE-2, which promotes AngII degradation to the
  heptapeptide Ang1-7. The effects of Ang1-7 are mediated through the Mas receptor.
  ASAP and APA inactivate Ang1-7, converting it into Ang2-7. Whereas AngII/AngIII
  promote a pro-inflammatory response through both AT1 and AT2 receptors, the ACE-2/Ang1-7/Mas
  cascade is involved in anti-inflammatory effects. The role of AngIV in inflammation
  remains unclear.
