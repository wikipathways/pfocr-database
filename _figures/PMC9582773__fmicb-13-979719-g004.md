caption: 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection alters
  metabolism and redox function of cellular glutathione (GSH). SARS-CoV-2 markedly
  decreases GSH levels [1], that could be explained by lower intake of the GSH precursor
  cysteine (Cys) [2] and increased efflux of cellular thiols [3]. Increased levels
  of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and protein glutathionylation [4] along with upregulation
  of endoplasmic reticulum stress marker protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum
  kinase (PERK) [5] are also observed. Antivirals activate the Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1 (Keap1)-Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant
  response element (ARE) redox regulator pathway, releasing Nrf2 [6] to regulate the
  expression of genes that control antioxidant, inflammatory and immune system responses
  (including the cystine (cys-cys)/glutamate transporter xCT and the membrane transporter
  multidrug resistance protein [MRP], which are decreased and markedly upregulated,
  respectively, during infection); restoring GSH levels in the infected cells and
  facilitating GSH synthesis [7] and activity. Abbreviations: γ-GT: γ-glutamyl transferase;
