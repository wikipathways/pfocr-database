caption: Potential therapeutic intervention of immune inhibitory receptors in association
  with cancer and chronic infection. Blockade of the signaling pathway of representative
  IRs can improve the function and activation of T cells. Bat3, which promotes activation
  of TCR and acceptance of Fyn, which induces T cell energy. The interaction between
  phosphatases induced by PD-1 and kinases recruited by Tim-3 might induce T cell
  exhaustion. PD-1 inhibits PI3K/Akt, Ras/MEK/ERK and p-STAT1/T-bet pathways via SHP-2
  to its phosphorylated ITSM motif. CTLA-4 inhibits PI3K/Akt downstream of TCR activation
  via PP2A in conventional T cells and suppresses activity to Tregvia PKC-h. Inhibition
  of T cell activity by LAG-3, which contains the KIEELE motif, occurs in an unknown
  signalling path (adapted from ). (Created in BioRender.com).
