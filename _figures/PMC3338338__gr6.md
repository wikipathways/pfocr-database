caption: Simplified schematic representing the effect of monoclonal FLCs on function
  of proximal tubular epithelial cells. Endocytosis of monoclonal FLCs generated intracellular
  oxidative stress, which activated ASK1. ASK1 activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
  and thereby promoted apoptosis. In addition, monoclonal FLCs activated c-Src, which
  promoted a proinflammatory environment through activation of the canonical and atypical
  NF-κB pathways, but also promoted a prosurvival signal through activation of Akt
  and down-regulation of ASK1 activity through phosphorylation of ASK1 at S83. Thus,
  activation of c-Src may serve as a defense against cell death but promotes an inflammatory
  response. In addition to the interrelatedness of these pathways depicted in the
  schematic, NF-κB generates proinflammatory signals and can also induce additional
  antiapoptotic and proapoptotic pathways that affect cell function and survival.
  Finally, ASK1 not only activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway but may also directly
  participate in an inflammatory response.
