caption: Genes regulated by SHP in PPAR signaling pathway. PPAR signaling pathway
  from KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) was analyzed. Genes with differential
  expression pattern from day 0 (G0 and S0) to day 2 (G2 and S2) during 3T3-L1 cell
  differentiation were indicated by colors. Different color represents different expression
  level for each gene. Red, upregulated; blue, down-regulated. Genes that were markedly
  down-regulated by SHP at day 2 (S2) as compared to G2 were highlighted by red. These
  include CD36, Δ6 desaturase, SCD-1, LPL, CPT-1, MCAD, PGAR, and PPARγ2. G, GFP;
  S, SHP.
