caption: The functional significance of each protein was defined using Ingenuity bioinformatics
  platforms designed for Systems Analyses of genes and protein expressed in human
  health and disease. All proteins were uploaded into the Strategene Pathway Architect
  (SPA) program and protein-interaction pathways were constructed according to the
  manufacturer's instructions. Proteins identified by our present proteomics studies
  are shown with blue outlines; purple-colored proteins are enzymes and kinases and
  pink-colored (with blue outlines) are other significant proteins involved in the
  lipid metabolism. Lines connecting proteins indicate molecular networks of interactions.
  The greater the number of lines originating from a protein, the more significant
  the molecular interactions of that protein with other protein/s. Note the extensive
  networks of interactions between all proteins identified in the present study (blue
  circles), particularly those of APOB and APOA-1. Full protein names, abbreviations
  and accession numbers of each protein are listed in &.
