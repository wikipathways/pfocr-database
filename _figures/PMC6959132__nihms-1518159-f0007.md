caption: BDNF-signaling pathway mechanism. Autophosphorylation tyrosine residues upon
  BDNF binding to TrkB acts through four different but overlapping intracellular signaling
  pathways. It sends pro-survival signals through phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase
  and serinethreonine-specific protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, stimulates axon growth
  through extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and modulation of cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP) pathway and influences synaptic plasticity and transmission
  through phospholipase C (PLC), inositol-3-phosphate (IP-3) and the calcium signaling
  pathway. Additionally, through the phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
  receptor subunits, TrkB signaling may lead to an increase in calcium and sodium
  influx also contributing to the synaptic plasticity. Figure adapted from [].
