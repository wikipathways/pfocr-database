caption: 'Schematic overview of ovarian clear cell cancer carcinogenesis. A Ovarian
  Clear Cell Cancer Progression; B Genetic alterations; C Five main signalling pathway
  in carcinogenesis. Shed menstrual endometrium leaves the cavity and retrograde along
  the fallopian tube to the ovary. The microenvironment of ectopic endometrial cells
  contains a large amount of fragmented erythrocytes which in turn releases a large
  amount of ions leading to stronger oxidative stress and more IL-6 production, stimulating
  cellular. At the same time, there is a higher mutational burden compared to normal
  endometrial cells, with common mutations including ARID1A, PIK3CA, PTEN, and KRAS.
  The five major pathways involved in carcinogenesis to OCCC include: PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  pathway, HIF-1α-VEGF pathway, IL-6-STAT3 pathway and MAPK pathway and HNF-1β pathway.
  In addition, lymphatic, hematogenous, and peritoneal implantation metastasis are
  common metastatic pathways in advanced ovarian clear cell carcinoma'
