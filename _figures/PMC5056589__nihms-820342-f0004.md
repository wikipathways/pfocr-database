caption: 'The crosstalk between platelet-activating factor, HIV-1, inflammation, immunity,
  and chronic comorbidities. Overall, in chronic HIV-1 infection there is a vicious
  cycle of increased systemic inflammation, coagulation, immune activation, increased
  production of oxidized lipids and platelet-activating factor that may directly affect
  cells and tissues and lead to end-organ disease (1). Platelet-activating factor
  may exert both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, depending on the
  biologic context (, ). In chronic HIV-1 infection, the pro-inflammatory effects
  are more prominent since there is chronic activation of the platelet-activating
  factor pathway that may result in increased lysophosphatidylcholine formation (2).
  It is known to increase coagulation and systemic inflammation, affect the pathogenesis
  of many comorbidities including atherogenesis (), and cause immunomodulation (,
  ; ) (1). In addition, there is a dynamic cross-talk between HIV-1 and platelet-activating
  factor since HIV-1 affects the platelet-activating factor pathway and vice versa
  (3). Anti-retroviral therapy may also directly affect the platelet-activating factor
  pathway. Platelet-activating factor has direct effects on vascular permeability,
  atherogenesis (, ) as well as the overall angiogenesis (4). Platelet-activating
  factor is a neurotoxin that also mediates HIV-infected macrophage-astroglia interactions
  and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder pathogenesis (5). Platelet-activating
  factor can also cause immunomodulation and affect immune activation through direct
  effects on granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells
  (6). The above interactions are not limited to discrete pathways, but are part of
  interrelated multiple feedback loops. PAF: platelet-activating factor; ART: antiretroviral
  therapy; CVD: cardiovascular disease; HAND: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder.'
