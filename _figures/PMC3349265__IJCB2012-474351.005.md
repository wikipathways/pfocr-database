caption: Potential signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms mediating dendritic
  spine injury and drebrin A loss in epilepsy. Acute seizure or chronic epileptogenesis
  may lead to activation of calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, which in turn
  causes cofilin dephosphorylation either directly or indirectly via an intermediary
  phosphatase, known as slingshot. Cofilin activity can also be regulated by phosphorylation
  via the PAK-LIM-kinase pathway. Thus, higher slingshot and/or lower PAK/LIM kinase
  activities in the hippocampi with epilepsy, leading to less phosphorylation of cofilin,
  would potentially increase cofilin binding to F-actin, and this could cause depolymerization
  of F-actin, leading to the prevention and/or dissociation of drebrin from its actin-binding
  site. This would result in drebrin A translocation to the cytosol leading to its
  degradation by active caspase. Ultimately, the breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton
  in dendrites can lead to synaptic dysfunction in epilepsy.
