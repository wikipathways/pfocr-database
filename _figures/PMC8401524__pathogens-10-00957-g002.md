caption: Itaconate controls both host and bacteria metabolism. Itaconate, synthetized
  by mitochondrial IRG1, inhibits host cell metabolism at different levels. Itaconate
  can block GADPH, aldolase and the NLRP3-NEK7 complex, which participate in pro-inflammatory
  signaling. Itaconate also interferes with SDH function, which is required to promote
  IL-1β synthesis. Once secreted, itaconate blocks the glyoxylate shunt pathway in
  P. aeruginosa by blocking aceA activity. In S. aureus, itaconate inhibits aldolase,
  suppressing glycolysis and bacterial proliferation.
