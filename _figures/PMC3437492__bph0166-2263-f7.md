caption: The fate of albitiazolium and choline in the P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte
  and albitiazolium-induced inhibition of PC biosynthesis. Choline enters the infected
  erythrocyte essentially through the erythrocyte choline carrier and a small amount
  via furosemide-sensitive NPPs. Choline is then transported into the parasite by
  the parasite choline carrier and used to synthesize PC via the Kennedy pathway.
  The choline analogue albitiazolium enters the infected erythrocyte via furosemide-sensitive
  NPPs and a furosemide-insensitive pathway. Albitiazolium inhibits choline transport
  by the erythrocyte choline carrier but is not transported by it. The choline analogue
  is taken up by the parasite via the parasite choline carrier, thus inhibiting choline
  transport. Albitiazolium is accumulated in the parasite and exerts its activity
  principally on the different steps of the de novo PC biosynthesis pathway. It should
  be noted that albitiazolium is abbreviated to ‘T3’ for convenience in this diagram.
