caption: Regulation of sexual fate in C. elegans focusing on the role of tra-3. (A)
  Simplified genetic pathway of somatic sex determination (; ; and references therein).
  Wild-type XX diploids are hermaphrodites, which are self-fertile females that produce
  first sperm, then oocytes, and XO diploids are males. The pathway consists of a
  cascade of negative regulatory interactions, whereby an upstream gene inhibits the
  activity of its downstream neighbor. The state of each gene (high/low) during XX
  or XO development is indicated. The decision to adopt a male or female somatic fate
  is determined by tra-1. The pathway has been modified to indicate that tra-2 is
  epistatic to tra-3 (this work). (B) Molecular model of the signal transduction pathway
  underlying the genetic pathway of somatic sex-determination. In XX hermaphrodites,
  TRA-2A is depicted as a multipass membrane protein that binds and represses FEM-3
  through its carboxyl terminus, possibly by sequestration. We propose that TRA-3
  is a protease that cleaves and potentiates the activity of TRA-2A (this work); however,
  the fate of the carboxy-terminal TRA-2A peptide is unknown. TRA-3 is present in
  both sexes (S. Sokol and P. Kuwabara, unpubl.).
