caption: Model of Rca1-dependent regulation of C. albicans hyphal development and
  antifungal response. In air, where ppCO2 is low (A), Rca1 is active and induces
  the expression of NCE103 (carbonic anhydrase). Nce103 converts CO2 into bicarbonate
  ions, which, in turn, participate in bicarbonate homeostasis and metabolism. However,
  HCO3−synthesis is not sufficient to induce an activation of the cAMP/PKA/Efg1 signaling
  pathway (absence of activation is represented by dotted lines). Therefore, Efg1-dependent
  hypha-specific genes are not expressed. Moreover, Rca1 interaction with a putative
  transcriptional repressor further prevents the expression of these genes. Consequently,
  C. albicans grows under the yeast form. RCA1 deletion (B) leads to the downregulation
  of NCE103 and to a subsequent growth deficiency. Moreover, repression exercised
  by the interaction between Rca1 and the putative transcriptional repressor on hypha-specific
  genes is relieved, and thus C. albicans forms hyphae. The deregulation of cAMP/PKA/Efg1-dependent
  gene expression is responsible for FLC resistance, while the deregulation of Rca1/repressor-dependent
  genes expression is responsible for CAS resistance. When ppCO2 increases (C), Rca1
  is inactive and NCE103 is no longer transcribed. However, the spontaneous conversion
  from CO2 into HCO3− is sufficient to increase the bicarbonate concentration within
  C. albicans cells. The high HCO3− concentration reaches a level that activates adenylyl
  cyclase (Cyr1). Cyr1 then converts ATP into cAMP, which, in turn, activates the
  protein kinase A (PKA). PKA activates the transcription factor Efg1, which induces
  the expression of hypha-specific genes. Moreover, Rca1 inactivation relieves its
  interaction with a transcriptional repressor, which further induces the expression
  of hypha-specific genes. This allows hyphal development.
