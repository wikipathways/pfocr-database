caption: Osteoblast–Osteoclast Communication via S1P. S1P can act directly on osteoblasts
  via S1PR1/3 receptors to enhance osteoblast maturation and mineralisation []. S1PR1/3
  also activates the ERK/p38 signalling pathway to enhance COX2 production [,]. COX2
  then elicits the release of RANKL from osteoblasts to enhance osteoclastogenesis
  via p38-cfos-NFATc1 signalling []. RANK activation of osteoclasts by RANKL also
  upregulates SPHK1 expression and production, resulting in increased intracellular
  S1P, which inhibits p38. Inhibition of p38 causes a reduction in osteoclastogenesis,
  acting as a negative regulator of osteoclast maturation []. S1P released from osteoclasts
  increases extracellular S1P, which may act as a break on osteoclastogenesis through
  the S1PR2 receptor on osteoblasts, as S1PR2 acts to enhance the secretion of the
  RANKL decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) []. OPG acts to reduce further RANKL-mediated
  osteoclastogenesis through binding to RANKL. Created in Biorender.com.
