caption: 'Synthesis of major plant volatile isoprenoids, isoprene and monoterpenes,
  occurs via the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway in chloroplast,
  however other multiple biosynthetic pathways can contribute carbon intermediates
  to MEP pathway. Due to the compartmental nature of the chloroplast metabolism and
  cytosol, the intermediate exchange among different pathways is hampered. The key
  pathways interacting with the MEP pathway are Carbon 1 (C1) metabolic pathway, oxidative
  pentose pathway, Calvin-Benson (CB) cycle, shikimate pathway, cytosolic glycolysis
  and mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Potential exchange of intermediates through the plastid
  membrane is also shown, as well as intermediate carbon partitioning. In addition,
  biosynthesis of different classes of isoprenoids formed from the same five carbon
  (C5) precursors in both compartments is shown. Solid-line arrows indicate carbon
  flow from extra-chloroplast intermediate molecules and exchange of carbon intermediates
  between the compartments. The inhibitors of the MVA and MEP pathway are shown in
  red. Fosmidomycin (FMS) inhibits DXR, the enzyme responsible for the formation of
  MEP from DXP in the MEP pathway [,]. Bisphosphonates (BP) inhibitors (e.g. alendronate
  and zoledronate) are used to inhibit prenyltransferases reactions, suppressing the
  formation of isoprenoids formed from GDP in chloroplast and cytosol [,]. The lovastatin
  (LOV) (also referred to as mevinolin), is a specific inhibitor of HMGR in the MVA
  pathway [,,]. Abbreviations: Metabolites: CDP-ME, 4-(cytidine 5’-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol;
