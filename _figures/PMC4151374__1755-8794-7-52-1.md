caption: 'Interaction network among 24 seed nodes (marked as black circle) and their
  80 interacted nodes (marked as grey circle) using three Cytoscape plug-ins. Six
  seed nodes (KLKB1, KARS, NRXN2, LAMA3, PRNP, and APOE) clustered according to the
  KEGG pathway criteria were annotated by red squares and indicated by red arrows.
  The six interaction nodes with seed node were annotated by black squares and indicated
  by black arrows. The apoptosis cluster (path: hsa04210) was expanded using GO data
  [apoptosis (GO: 0006915), anti-apoptosis (GO: 0006916), induction of apoptosis (GO:
  0006917), induction of apoptosis by intracellular signals (GO: 0008629), regulation
  of apoptosis (GO: 0042981), and positive regulation of apoptosis (GO: 0043065)].'
