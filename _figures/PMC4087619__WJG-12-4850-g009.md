caption: Hypothetical mechanism of action of DA-9601 on TNF-α-induced CCL20 expression
  in AGS cells. TNF-α induces activation of three MAPKs. Among three MAPKs, however,
  activation of p38 kinase involves in NF-κB signaling system. DA-9601 may inhibit
  NF-κB directly or indirectly through the inhibition of p38 kinase pathway. See text
  for discussion.
