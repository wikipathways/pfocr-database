caption: 'Redox involvement in the different metabolic dependencies described for
  CSCs. CSCs bear diverse metabolic dependencies in a tumor and context-dependent
  manner: (1) Aerobic glycolysis, controlled by MYC; (2) OxPhos, fuelled by different
  microenvironmental substrates and controlled by Imp2 or PGC-1α; (3) Lipid metabolism,
  increasing either fatty acid synthesis and storage in lipid droplets (LDs) or utilization
  via mitochondrial FAO; (4) CSCs can be dependent on alternative substrates and pathways
  such as aminoacids, ketone bodies, PPP or purines. Interestingly, the metabolic
  phenotypes described for CSCs ensure the maintenance of cellular redox state. Keeping
  redox balance is crucial for CSCs in order to maintain their stemness characteristics,
  differentiation ability and resistance to chemo and radiotherapy, constituting one
  of the most important vulnerabilities independently of their origin or cellular
  context. ROS – reactive oxygen species, OxPhos – oxidative phosphorylation, LDs
  – lipid droplets, PPP – pentose phosphate pathway, FAO – fatty acid oxidation, TCA
  – tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
