caption: In RTK-driven tumors, essential signals are transduced from the receptor
  to various kinases. Upon blocking the original cancer driver, resistance can be
  conferred by an untargeted receptor. Some receptors, however, do not provide the
  full complement of essential resistance signals, or simultaneously activate pathways
  that inhibit cell viability. Differences in the required complement of downstream
  pathway activation results in particular receptors being more or less capable of
  driving bypass resistance. Understanding these pathway dependencies will identify
  points for therapeutic intervention and better methods to identify which receptor
  is driving resistance.
