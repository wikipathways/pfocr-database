caption: 'On the right, signaling pathways involved in mediating cavernosal smooth
  muscle cell (CSMC) relaxation. On the left, signaling pathway involved in mediating
  CSMC contraction. During normal conditions, there is a balance between pro-erectile
  and pro-relaxation signaling pathways resulting in a normal erectile function. During
  hypertension, there is an increase in pro-contractile signaling and/or decrease
  in pro-relaxation signaling resulting in increased contractility and decrease relaxation
  of CSMC, therefore, resulting in ED. Treatment with hypertensive drugs resulting
  in either increasing CSMC relaxation (i.e. PDEi), or decreasing CSMC contractility
  (i.e. ACEi), which will result in improvement of CSMC function and improving or
  restoring erectile function. Ach: acetylcholine, ACE: angiotensin converting enzyme,
  ACEi: ACE inhibitors, CBS: cystathionine-β-synthase, CSE: cystathionine gamma-lyase,
  DAG: diacylglycerol, H2S: hydrogen sulfide, IP3: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, PIP2:
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, MLC: myosin light chain, MLCK: myosin light
  chain kinase, NO: nitric oxide, PLC: phospholipase C, PDE: phosphodiesterase, PDEi:
  PDE inhibitors.'
