caption: The role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of AML. A The expression
  of CD80/86 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) engages with CTLA-4 and its analogous
  receptor CD28, while PDL-1 interacts with its counterpart PD-1 located on the surface
  of activated T cells, respectively. These interactions result in the inhibition
  of T-cell proliferation, activation, or the secretion of cytokines, which frequently
  engage with their respective receptors and ligands. B Immune checkpoint inhibitors
  that target various molecular entities, such as PD-1 (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab,
  Camrelizumab, Tislelizumab), PD-L1 (Atezolizumab, Durvalumab), and CTLA-4 (Ipilimumab,
  Tremelimumab), have garnered significant attention. The inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1
  axis or the CTLA-4/CD80/CD86 pathway engenders T-cell dysfunction, whereby such
  interactions culminate in the modulation of T-cell activities and the secretion
  of cytokines, ultimately resulting in the suppression of tumor cell proliferation
