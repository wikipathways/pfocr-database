caption: mTOR may be a central signaling pathway for coordinating multiple mechanisms
  of epileptogenesis due to diverse causes of epilepsy. The mTOR signaling pathway
  may be abnormally activated by a variety of genetic defects or acquired injuries,
  including upstream TSC or PTEN gene mutations, status epilepticus, or traumatic
  brain injury. In turn, mTOR hyperactivation may trigger multiple downstream mechanisms
  of epileptogenesis via regulation of protein synthesis and other cellular processes,
  such as expression of ion channels, apoptosis, autophagy, axonal sprouting, and
  neurogenesis. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin may represent an effective treatment
  for preventing epileptogenesis in many types of epilepsy involving abnormal mTOR
  activation.
