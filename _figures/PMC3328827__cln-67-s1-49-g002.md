caption: 'Beyond inactivation of the MEN1 gene, additional mutations in other genes
  may be responsible for acceleration of tumor growth, thus involving a process of
  multistep tumorigenesis. Deregulation of normal neuroendocrine development/differentiation
  can occur through a range of processes, e.g. activation of the PI3K pathway leads
  to AKT phosphorylation, triggering a downstream cascade of events. Deregulation
  of this pathway can occur through several mechanisms: 1) gain of function by oncogenic
  mutations of PIK3; 2) loss of function of the tumor suppressor PTEN through gene
  deletion, mutation, micro-RNA expression, or epigenetic silencing; 3) amplification
  or mutation of AKT isoforms; 4) upstream activation through RTK signalling; 5) downstream
  loss of the tumor suppressors p18 and p27; 6) increased RAS expression, or activating
  mutations of RAF, MEK, or ERK, which accelerate cell proliferation. Opportunities
  for treatment are in blue. NSAIDs  =  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; RTK
   =  receptor tyrosine kinase; TZDs  =  thiazolidinediones.'
