caption: Metabolic pathways in P. aeruginosa. Multiple arrowheads indicate that several
  reaction steps have been condensed for clarity. Boxes indicate the enzyme that catalyzes
  each reaction. (A) Glucose oxidation via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. For clarity,
  the pathway is abbreviated to the key intermediates of glycolysis. (B) Pyruvate
  fermentation (). LdhA, lactate dehydrogenase; Pdh, pyruvate dehydrogenase; Pta,
  phosphate acetyltransferase; AckA, acetate kinase. (C) The arginine deiminase pathway
  (). ArcA, arginine deiminase; ArcB, ornithine carbamoyltransferase; ArcC, carbamate
  kinase.
