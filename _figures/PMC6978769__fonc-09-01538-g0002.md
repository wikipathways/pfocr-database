caption: Crosstalk between DDR and immune system. (A) PD-L1 can increase mRNA stability
  of DNA damage response genes as a RNA binding protein in cancer cells. PD-L1 antibody
  H1A can increase sensitivity to DNA damage agents by reducing PD-L1 mediated stability
  of DDR transcripts. (B) DNA damage agents and PARP inhibitors can induce STING pathway
  to activate immune system.
