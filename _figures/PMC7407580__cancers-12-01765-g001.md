caption: Involvement of the CCL5/CCR5 axis in cancer progression. (1) CCL5, secreted
  by tumor cells (autocrine) and by the TME (paracrine), increases tumor growth. (2)
  CCL5 induces collagen degradation by activating matrix metalloproteinases in macrophages
  and fibroblasts. (3) CCL5 increases tumor cell migration and invasion by integrin
  activation (adhesion) and actin polarization. (4) CCR5+ cancer cells show characteristics
  of cancer stem cells. (5) CCR5 expression associates with stronger repair responses
  to DNA damage induced by doxorubicin and γ-irradiation. (6) CCL5 secreted by tumor
  cells and by the TME decreases drug cytotoxic activity. (7) CCR5 engagement stimulates
  glucose uptake, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis, and
  glutamine metabolism. (8) CCL5 promotes endothelial cell migration and neovessel
  formation, and induces the secretion of VEGF by endothelial cells. (9) CCL5 secreted
  by tumor cells recruits normal cells to build the TME. (10) CCL5 induces the immunosuppressive
  polarization of monocytes and myeloid cells leading to M2-TAMs and MDSCs that induce
  exhaustion of effector T-cells. Protein kinase B, Akt; cancer-associated fibroblast,
