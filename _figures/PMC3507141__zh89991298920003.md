caption: Model of zymogen FXII signaling pathway. FXII binds to domain 2 of uPAR and
  induces uPAR to communicate intracellularly through β1 integrins. Monoclonal antibody
  6S6 to β1 integrin blocks this pathway. Cell stimulation through uPAR and integrin
  requires an interaction with 1 or more of the ErbB receptor kinases because the
  tyrosine inhibitors AG1478 or PP3 block FXII signaling. The MEK inhibitor PD98059
  blocks FXII-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. LY294002, a PI3 kinase inhibitor, blocks
  FXII-induced Akt phosphorylation. Crosstalk between pERK1/2 and pAkt systems also
  occurs. Cleaved forms of HK (HKa) block binding of FXII to endothelial cells. Inhibition
  of any step of the FXII signaling pathways blocks cell proliferation and angiogenesis
  in HUVEC and aortic segments, respectively. Modified from Falati et al with permission.
