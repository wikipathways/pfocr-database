caption: Sphingosine metabolic pathway. Ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate
  can be metabolised into each other via various enzymes. Ceramide is converted into
  sphingosine through a reversible reaction by ceramidase (CDase) and ceramide synthase
  (CerS) []. Sphingosine frequently converted to sphingosine-1-phosphate via the two
  sphingosine kinases (SPHK1/2) []. S1P is metabolised back to sphingosine via sphingosine
  phosphate phosphatases (SPPase) or by an irreversible reaction by S1P lyase [].
  S1P is then exported out of the cell via spinster 2 (SPNS2). Created in Biorender.com.
