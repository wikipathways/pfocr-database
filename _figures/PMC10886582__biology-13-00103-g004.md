caption: Necroptosis signaling pathway. The binding of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
  induces the formation of the membrane-associated complex I, composed of TNF receptor-associated
  death domain (TRADD), TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), cellular inhibitor
  of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2), receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase
  1 (RIPK1), and LUBAC, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. cIAP1/2 and LUBAC induce the polyubiquitination
  of RIPK1, recruiting the IκB kinase (IkappaB kinase) complex (IKKa, IKKB, and NEMO)
  and TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex (TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2). These two complexes
  can eventually lead to the activation of the NF-κB pathway and cell survival. A20CYLD
  promotes the deubiquitination of RIPK1, inducing the dissociation of TRADD and RIPK1
  from TNFR1 and leading to the formation of complex IIa or complex IIb. Complex IIa,
  consisting of TRADD and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), activates
  caspase-8 and induces apoptosis through cleavage. Inhibition of RIPK1 ubiquitination
  results in the induction of complex IIb, composed of RIPK1, FADD and caspase-8.
  When caspase-8 is inhibited (in either complex IIa or IIb), RIPK1 and RIPK3 form
  necrosome complexes, activating MLKL through a phosphorylation cascade. Phosphorylated
  MLKL undergoes oligomerization and migrates to the membrane, which induces necroptosis
  by membrane rupture or regulating ion flow. [Image was created using Biorender.com
