caption: 'The cross-talk between PINK1 and the CHCHD4-dependent import machinery.Left
  panel: healthy mitochondria. In polarized mitochondria (Δψm high), PINK1 is actively
  imported into the organelle through the TOM/TIM translocases (a). The positively
  charged N-terminal (N-ter) region of the full-length PINK1 is first cleaved by the
  mitochondrial matrix (MM) protease MPP (b), followed by a further processing operated
  by the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM)-resident protease PARL (c). This generates
  an unstable shorter form of PINK1 (52 kDa) that is retrotranslocated to the cytosol
  (d) and finally degraded by the proteasome (e). During its transit in the intermembrane
  space (IMS) of healthy mitochondria, PINK1 was found to interact with the CHCHD4
  oxidase, the core component of a redoxregulated import machinery that regulates
  the import and proper folding of cysteine motif-carrying protein substrates (Imai
  et al., 2019). The interplay between PINK1 and the AIF/CHCHD4 complex could be determinant
  in the physiological fine-tuning of mitochondrial homeostasis and function. Right
  panel: damaged mitochondria. Upon dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential
  (ΔΨm low), PINK1 import is impaired (a) and the full-length protein accumulates
  on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM, c) thus triggering the signal for Parkin
  recruitment (d) and mitophagy activation (e). The CHCHD4-dependent pathway was found
  to be required for PINK1 stabilization (b) and mitophagy execution, an effect likely
  mediated by the formation of disulfide bonds (S-S) that inhibit the proteolytic
  cleavage of PINK1 (Gao et al., 2020). PARL: PGAM5-associated rhomboid-like protease.'
