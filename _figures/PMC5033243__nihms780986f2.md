caption: Some of the most common oncogenes (depicted in green), including receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTKs), oncogenic fusion proteins formed by chromosomal translocations,
  PI3K, Akt, Ras and Raf, and tumor suppressors (depicted in red), including PTEN,
  NF1, and LKB1, lie within signaling pathways that share mTORC1 regulation as a downstream
  target. In normal cells, growth factors bind to and stimulate RTKs and G protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCR), which can activate mTORC1 through either the PI3K-Akt or Ras-Erk
  signaling pathways. These pathways converge to inhibit the TSC complex (TSC1, TSC2,
  and TBC1D7), resulting in the accumulation of GTP bound Rheb, which is a potent
  and essential activator of mTORC1. Other pathways including LKB1-AMPK and Wnt signaling
  also impinge on regulation of the TSC complex and Rheb. A parallel pathway exists
  for amino acid sensing that involves the Rag family of GTPases, which act as a heterodimer
  of RagA or B with Rag C or D, and are regulated by different upstream sensors of
  amino acids. Oncogenic mutations within this network are common in cancer, resulting
  in aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling and its promotion of anabolic processes
  underlying cell growth and proliferation.
