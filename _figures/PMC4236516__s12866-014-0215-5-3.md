caption: The PM has increased expression of genes in the hisidine biosynthesis pathway
  compared to the WT in standard media. Genes colored geen have greater than 2-fold
  higher expression and genes colored red have a greater than 2-fold lower expression
  in the PM than the WT in standard media. The extent of gene expression change and
  expression levels in other comparisons are given in Table . PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl
  1-pyrophosphate. ACR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide.

  mutant strain shows increased cellular efficiency in response to Populus hydrolysate
  compared to the wild type strain.
