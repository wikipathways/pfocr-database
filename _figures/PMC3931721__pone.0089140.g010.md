caption: 'Model of starch biosynthetic pathway according to Reference . Blue pane
  represents differentially expressed proteins, red pane differed phosphorylation,
  and purple pane either differentially expressed proteins or differed phosphorylation.
  E, M and L represent early, mid-, and late grain-filling stage, respectively, of
  endosperm development stages of SS and IS. Black arrow represents proteins downregulated
  or upregulated in IS as compared to SS. Red arrow represents phosphoproteins downregulated
  or upregulated in IS as compared to SS. PGM: Phosphoglucomutase; UGPase: UDP-glucose
  pyrophosphorylase; AGPase: ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase; ADPGT: ADPglucose transporter;
  AATP: plastidic ATP transporter; GTP: Glucose-6-Phosphate transporter; GBSS: Granule
  bound starch synthase; Pul: Pullulanase; PPDK: Pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinas.'
