caption: Enzymes (EC number) and metabolites (KEGG Compound number) from the Cysteine
  and methionine metabolism (map00270) pathway differentially expressed in the apical
  leaf of young oil palm plants submitted to drought stress. Metabolites differentially
  expressed are shown as orange circles, metabolites non-differentially expressed
  are shown as white circles, and enzymes non-differentially expressed are shown as
  white, and those differentially expressed are shown as green (from transcriptomics),
  as blue (from proteomics), and green/blue rectangles (from transcriptomics and proteomics).
