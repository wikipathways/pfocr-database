caption: Molecular pathways associated with thyroid cancer. Mutations in the RET/MAPK
  signaling pathway are known to drive tumorigenesis. This activation causes the enhanced
  progression of Cyclin D, which interacts with CDK4/6 to phosphorylate Rb. pRb is
  required for cell cycle progression. The members of the INK4/CDKN2 family (CDKN2A
  [p15], CDKN2B [p16], CDKN2C [p18], and CDKN2D [p19]) are cyclin-dependent kinase
  inhibitors that block the progression of the cell cycle by interacting with CDK4
  or CDK6 to prevent activation of the Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex.
