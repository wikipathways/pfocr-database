caption: Mechanisms of Ca2+signaling. Upon activation of a G-protein coupled receptor
  (GPCR) by an agonist, phospholipase C (PLC) is activated, which generates two second
  messengers; diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). DAG is capable
  of activating TRPC channels in the plasma membrane and Ca2+ influx is triggered.
  IP3 diffuses through the cytoplasm and binds to IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) membranes. This binding enables ER depletion, resulting in a rapid
  Ca2+ transient. The depletion of ER is sensed by stromal interaction protein 1 (STIM1)
  proteins which act as sensors. STIM1 makes a complex with Orai1 channels in the
  plasma membrane and induces store operated Ca2+ entry through Orai1. Voltage-operated
  calcium channels open in response to a depolarization of the plasma membrane in
  excitable neural and muscle cells. Ca2+ in the cytoplasm activates ryanodine receptors
  and Ca2+ is released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To avoid a Ca2+ flood
  in the cytoplasm, the pumps sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (SERCA)
  and plasma membrane Ca2+ATPase (PMCA), and the sodium calcium exchangers (NCX),
  are activated which export Ca2+ out of the cell or into the ER. The secretory pathway
  Ca2+ ATPase (SPCA) transports Ca2+ ions into the Golgi apparatus.
