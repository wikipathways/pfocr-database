caption: Signaling pathways in melanoma. MAPK signaling promotes cell growth and survival
  and is constitutively active in most melanomas. RAS family members are activated
  by RTKs and signal through effector proteins including PI3K, RAF kinases, and Ral-GEFs.
  Oncogenic BRAF and NRAS are found in 40–60% and 10–30% of melanomas, respectively.
  c-KIT signaling is essential for melanocyte development and is associated with melanomas
  arising on acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged skin. Mutations in GNAQ and
  GNA11, two G protein α-subunits involved in MAPK signaling, are the dominant genetic
  lesions in uveal melanomas. MITF, the master transcriptional regulator in melanocytes
  and lineage-specific oncogene, is expressed in response to MC1R signaling. Loss-of-function
  variants of MC1R are associated with the red hair/fair skin phenotype and increased
  melanoma susceptibility. Known melanoma oncogenes and tumor suppressors are labeled
  in red. Dotted lines represent omitted pathway components.
