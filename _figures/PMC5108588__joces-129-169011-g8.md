caption: Hypothetical model explaining the dysfunctional Wnt–β-catenin signaling in
  PPARγ deficiency. We propose a model where loss of PPARγ leads to impaired angiogenesis
  through a dysfunctional Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway. PPARγ contributes to the
  activity of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway by regulating E2F1 expression, which
  is essential in sustaining critical levels of GSKIP in PMVECs and contributes to
  the migration capacity of PMVECs. GSKIP inhibits GSK3β to inactivate the degradation
  complex of β-catenin (β-C). This allows β-catenin to accumulate and form complexes
  with its co-factors such as PPARγ (). The PPARγ–β-catenin complex translocates into
  the nucleus and regulates genes important for endothelial cell homeostasis. APLN,
  apelin.
