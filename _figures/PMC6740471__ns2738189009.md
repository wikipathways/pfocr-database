caption: 'A cellular model of the rapid signaling of estrogen in hypothalamic neurons.
  Schematic overview showing the rapid versus delayed ER-mediated modulation of neurotransmitter-regulated
  G-protein-coupled receptors via a membrane-associated ER in hypothalamic neurons.
  Rapid signaling: E2 activates a membrane-associated ER that is Gαq-coupled to activation
  of phospholipase C that catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3) and DAG. Calcium is
  released from intracellular stores (endoplasmic reticulum) by IP3, and DAG activates
  PKCδ. Through phosphorylation, AC VII activity is upregulated by PKCδ. The generation
  of cAMP activates PKA, which can rapidly uncouple GABAB and μ-opioid (μ) receptors
  from their effector system through phosphorylation of a downstream effector molecule
  (e.g., the inwardly rectifying K+ channel, or GIRK). ER-mediated modulation of kinase
  pathways either reduces the capacity of neuromodulators such as GABA and β-endorphin
  (βEnd) to inhibit hypothalamic neuronal excitability, or augments the ability of
  neurotransmitters such as glutamate to increase neuronal excitability (data not
  shown). Delayed signaling: rapid ER-mediated activation of PKA can lead to phosphorylation
  of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (pCREB), which can then alter gene transcription
  through its interaction with the cAMP-responsive element (CRE). Moreover, other
  isoforms of PKC can phosphorylate raf-1 (Raf), leading to activation of the MAP
  kinase pathway and new gene transcription and protein (e.g., GPCRs) synthesis in
  an estrogen-response element-independent manner.'
