caption: Signaling mechanisms for PGF2α and AL-8810 stimulation of FP receptor. PGF2α
  activates ERK1/2 through the canonical Gαq/11-PKC-dependent pathway, which seems
  to be mostly EGFR independent in HEK293 cells, and results in activated ERK1/2 remaining
  mainly in the cytosol at early time points and translocates to the nucleus at later
  time points. On the other hand, AL-8810 activates ERK1/2 through FP receptor-dependent
  EGFR transactivation, via Src kinase and EGF shedding, probably via matrix metalloproteases,
  leading to a rapid and transient activation of ERK1/2 in the nucleus. RTK, Receptor
  tyrosine kinase.
