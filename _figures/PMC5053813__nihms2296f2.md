caption: Possible orientation of nuclear β-AR signaling complexes. Both the β1-AR,
  coupled to Gs, and the β3-AR, coupled to Gi, but not the β2-AR, are resident on
  the nuclear membrane, at least in rat and mouse adult ventricular cardiomyocytes
  (, ). How these receptors are trafficked to distinct endomembrane compartments is
  not well understood and could either be a result of receptor internalization from
  the cell surface or via de novo delivery from the biosynthetic pathway. The outer
  nuclear membrane is continuous with both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the
  inner nuclear membrane, with which it is joined at the level of nuclear pore complex
  insertion. Ligand must be able to attain the space between the two nuclear membranes
  to activate these receptors, or receptors must be constitutively active. The possibility
  that there may be two distinct orientations for nuclear G protein-coupled receptors
  (GPCRs), i.e., either capable of delivering signals toward the cytosol or the nucleoplasm,
  is something that can only be explored in an intact cell context. Also, what the
  role of the nuclear pore complex is in determining the sidedness of nuclear GPCR
  signaling remains to be determined. C, COOH-terminus; N, NH2-terminus; AC, adenylyl
  cyclase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
