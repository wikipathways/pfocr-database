caption: 'Targeting CXCR4. (A) Overview of CXCL12/CXCR4 signal transduction pathways.
  CXCR4 is a seven-transmembrane spanning G-protein coupled receptor. Upon binding
  CXCL12, CXCR4 G-protein-mediated signaling leads to (a) activation of JAK/STAT signaling
  promoting stemness and survival, (b) activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K)-Akt-mTOR pathway promoting cell survival and proliferation, (c) activation
  of Ras/Raf and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling leading to phosphorylation
  of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 which promotes survival and proliferation,
  (d) activation of phospholipase C (PLC) leading to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol
  triphosphate (IP3) production which induces Ca2+ efflux and protein kinase C (PKC)
  activation resulting in chemotaxis and migration, and (e) inhibition of adenylyl
  cyclase (AC), which reduces cAMP production and protein kinase A activation leading
  to reduced cell proliferation and chemotaxis. CXCL12 also induces CXCR4 desensitization
  via uncoupling the receptor from G-proteins by GRK-dependent phosphorylation and
  subsequent β-arrestin-dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. (B) Inhibitors
  of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. Drugs targeting CXCR4 can be divided into three general
  categories: (1) small molecules; (2) peptide-like molecules; and (3) antibodies.
  NOX-A12 disrupts the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis by binding and neutralizing CXCL12. (C) Schematic
  of CXCR4 inhibitor-mediated chemosensitization in leukemia. Osteoblasts, mesenchymal
  stem/stromal cells (MSC) and CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells in the bone marrow
  niche constitutively express CXCR12 leading to the recruitment and adhesion of CXCR4-expressing
  leukemia cells. These interactions provide a protective environment to the malignant
  cells in the presence of chemotherapeutic agents. Disruption of CXCR4-mediated adhesion
  of leukemia cells to the chemoprotective cells in the bone marrow niche via administration
  of CXCR4 inhibitors promotes mobilization and chemosensitization of leukemia cells.
  (D) Alternative approaches to target CXCR4-expressing cells. Antibodies to CXCR4
  have been linked to cytotoxic drugs (antibody-drug conjugates; ADC) which induce
  cell death via DNA damage and/or microtubule disruption upon internalization. Several
  small molecule inhibitors and peptide-based antagonists of CXCR4 have been radiolabeled
  for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging or endoradiotherapy. Nanomaterials
  are small particles that serve as carriers for small-molecule drugs, proteins, and
  nucleic acids. Several nanomaterials targeting CXCR4 with the small molecule inhibitors,
  antibodies, or peptide-based antagonists discussed above have been developed.'
