caption: Canonical and non-canonical Notch signaling pathway. A schematic figure of
  the structure of the receptors (NOTCH1-4) and their ligands (DLL-1/3/4 and JAG1/2).
  After synthesis, the NOTCH receptors mature in a stepwise process and are simultaneously
  transported through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi structures to the plasma
  membrane. Receptor–ligand interactions generate a mechanical pulling force that
  allows ADAM proteases and the γ-secretase complex to cleave the receptor (at the
  S2 and S3 cleave site, respectively), followed by the release of the intracellular
  domain (NICD) to the cytoplasm of the signal-receiving cell. Simultaneously, the
  extracellular part of the NOTCH (NECD) and the ligand are internalized by the signal-sending
  cell. Intracellular release of NICD can also occur without ligand activation via
  NOTCH internalization and γ-secretase activity. The NICD is translocated into the
  nucleus where it participates in the formation of the Notch ternary complex (NTC),
  activating the expression of target genes. In non-canonical Notch signaling, the
  NICD interacts with and modulates other signaling pathways to express target genes
  without the mediation of the NTC.
