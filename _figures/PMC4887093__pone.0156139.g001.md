caption: The MAPK pathway is composed of three levels. The signal is transduced through
  phosphorylation events where mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K,
  also known as MAPKKK) phosphorylates mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K,
  also known as MAPKK) leading to its activation and thus the phosphorylation and
  activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). Active MAPK phosphorylates
  protein targets in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. For mediating nuclear events MAPK
  translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates many proteins, which control
  gene expression.
