caption: GO pathway to analyze polymorphic biological processes via GO codes from
  Blast2GO. GO terms ranged from 35,822 to 1471.06 and the number of associated transcripts
  ranging from 365 to 428 sequences. Main GO terms related to carbohydrate and energy
  metabolism (GO:0044237 and GO:0044238) and cysteine and methionine synthesis (GO:0008152
  and GO:0009987). We also explored the enzyme codes of the 52 KEEG pathways associated
  with all polymorphic transcripts (, extended in ). Of the KEEG pathways, 25% were
  related to carbohydrate metabolism, 19.23% of the KEEG pathways were related to
  amino acid metabolism, 11.54% of the KEEG pathways were related to energy metabolism
  and the other pathways were associated with less than 10% of the target queries.
  Main pathways of carbohydrate/amino acid synthesis were linked to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  (), and cysteine/methionine metabolism () [].
