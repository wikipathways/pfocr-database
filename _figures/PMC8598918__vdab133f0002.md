caption: 'Mechanisms of resistance and potential combination strategy. Acquired resistance
  to RTK-targeting reagents may involve 3 mechanisms: (A) through compensatory upregulation
  of other RTKs. It is common that inhibiting a single RTK signaling may cross activate
  another pathway to sustain tumor proliferation and invasion; thus, a combination
  of multiple TKIs will improve the therapeutic efficacy (see the text for more details);
  (B) through stroma-mediated soluble factor secretion. Tumor cells under treatment
  may select to respond to the signals from the microenvironment that are favored
  for survival, leading to tumor recurrence. Thus, TKIs in combination with those
  receptor antagonists may improve the therapeutic efficacy; (C) through hypoxia-mediated
  immune checkpoint activation. After anti-angiogenic therapy, the consequent hypoxic
  environment may upregulate immune checkpoint signaling activation in the tumor,
  leading to T cell exhaustion. Thus, TKIs in combination with checkpoint inhibitors
  may improve the therapeutic efficacy.'
