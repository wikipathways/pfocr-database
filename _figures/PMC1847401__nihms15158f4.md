caption: Genes of the insulin/IGF-2 signaling pathway are required for induced stress
  resistance and induced life extension. daf-18 appears to be required for heat-induced
  thermotolerance independently of daf-16. However, the daf-12, daf-16 and daf-18
  mutants tested were all found to be defective for life extension induced by heat
  pretreatment. (Modified from ).
