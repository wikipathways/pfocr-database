caption: A number of mitochondrial proteins have recently been implicated in the innate
  immune system, either through interaction with MAVS, or as part of an autonomous
  pathway. STING (also known as MITA) has been localized to both mitochondria and
  the endoplasmic reticulum, and may act downstream of RIG-I and MAVS in their initiation
  of pro-immune signaling kinases. NLRX1 and gC1qR have been implicated as regulators
  as MAVS function, possibly acting as physical barriers to prevent its interaction
  with RIG-I. However, there is strong evidence to suggest that the mature forms or
  both NLRX1 and gC1qR reside in the mitochondrial matrix, making a functional interaction
  with MAVS less likely. NLRX1 has recently been shown to physically interact with
  the respiratory chain complex III subunit UQCRC2, suggesting that it may be involved
  in reactive oxygen species production. Mfn2, an outer mitochondrial GTPase involved
  in mitochondrial fusion, has been shown to bind MAVS and negatively regulate immune
  signaling, raising questions about the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the immune
  response.
