caption: 'Schematic representation of the D-Asp, D-Ser and Glu pathways at tripartite
  synapsis. In the brain, D-Asp and DASPO are primarily present in neurons, within
  the peroxisomes. D-Asp biosynthetic pathway is still debated: the presence of an
  enzyme acting as an aspartate racemase has been proposed. L-Ser is largely synthesized
  in astrocytes from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), through
  the so called “phosphorylated pathway” (PP). L-Ser is released from astrocytes by
  the alanine/serine/cysteine/threonine transporter-1 (ASCT1) and is then taken up
  into neurons via transporter(s), where it is converted to D-Ser by serine racemase
  (SR). D-Ser is then released at the synapsis by the alanine-serine-cysteine-1 transporter
  (Asc-1, at least in part), where it binds to NMDA receptors at the coagonist regulatory
  site. Finally, it is removed from the synaptic cleft by reuptake into astrocytes
  where it is catabolized by DAAO, which activity is controlled by the interaction
  with the regulatory protein pLG72. Notably, L-Ser is also converted into glycine
  (the other coagonist of the NMDA receptor) by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT). In neurons, the principal agonist of NMDA receptors, Glu is mainly produced
  from the reaction catalyzed by phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG) and uploaded
  in vesicles through the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut), for the subsequent
  synaptic release and post-synaptic neurons stimulation. Glu signal is terminated
  by the uptake into astrocytes that occurs through the amino acid transporters (EEAT).
  In glial cells, Glu is converted to Gln via glutamine synthetase (GS) or 2-oxoglutarate
  by glutamate dehydrogenase or aspartate aminotransferase (GDH and AspAT) for subsequent
  oxidative metabolism in the Krebs cycle. Gln is then shuttled back to neurons. 2-OG
  = 2-oxoglutarate; OAA = oxaloacetate.'
