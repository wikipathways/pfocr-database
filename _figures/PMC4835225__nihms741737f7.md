caption: Synthesis of probe 8 by the esterification of 1 with IAF tag 6. Methyl ester
  7 was prepared as a negative control for the IAF tag. NMR analyses suggested the
  presence of both C6 and C8 isomers as duplicate peaks were observed at proximal
  positions, H9/C9 and H10/C10, while single peaks at remote positions such as H1/C1
  and H13/C13 (see Supporting Information).
