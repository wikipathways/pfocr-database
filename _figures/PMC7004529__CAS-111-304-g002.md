caption: The biological function of senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
  factors in physiological and pathological conditions. SASP factors play important
  roles in common physiological conditions, as shown by the red arrows, such as wound
  healing (PDGF‐AA, platelet‐derived growth factor‐AA), embryonic development (TGF‐β,
  transforming growth factor‐β; Wnt) and immune recruitment (CXCL1, CCL2 and CCL5).
  However, SASP factors also induce tumor progression and migration (MMP; IL‐1β, interleukin‐1β;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor) and suppression of anti–tumor immunity
  (PGE2, prostaglandin E2) under pathological conditions, as shown by the blue arrows.
  Moreover, SASP factors induce and maintain senescence cell cycle arrest through
  paracrine and autocrine factors
