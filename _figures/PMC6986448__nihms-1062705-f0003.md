caption: KISS1-regulated network is associated with proteins, ions, RNA molecules
  and chemical compounds. KISS1 is positioned in the center of the protein network.
  The interacting proteins are depicted as various geometric shapes, each representing
  a particular functional class of proteins, whereas their position with regard to
  two horizontal solid lines reflects their compartmentalization properties/ intracellular
  localization, i.e. in the nucleus, cytoplasm or extracellular space. Proteins with
  unknown localization are positioned inside the vertical box on the right (“unknown”).
  The length and type of each protein-connecting line reflects either predicted (dashed
  line) or experimentally evidenced/published (solid line) interactions. Data were
  analyzed through the use of IPA (Ingenuity® Systems, http://www.ingenuity.com).
