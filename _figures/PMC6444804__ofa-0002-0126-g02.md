caption: 'Hypothalamic fatty acid metabolism integrates peripheral signals with neuropeptide
  systems: Peripheral hormonal and nutrient/metabolic signals operate on the different
  components of the fatty acid metabolic pathway, modulating the cytoplasmatic pool
  of malonyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA. This effect elicits changes in neuropeptide expression,
  such as agouti-related protein (AgRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), cocaine and amphetamine-regulated
  transcript (CART), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) by still undefined mechanisms
  (represented as ?) which ultimately regulates feeding. In addition, current evidence
  has demonstrated that ghrelin-induced carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) activation
  promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Fatty acids and ROS increase
  uncoupling protein 2(UCP2)-dependent uncoupling activity and UCP2 gene expression
  which subsequently decreases ROS in a feedback manner, allowing appropriate ghrelin-induced
  gene transcription. Further work is necessary to demonstrate whether this mechanism
  (labelled in blue), besides ghrelin, is extensive to other peripheral signals modulating
  food intake. NrF1 = Nuclear respiratory factor 1.'
