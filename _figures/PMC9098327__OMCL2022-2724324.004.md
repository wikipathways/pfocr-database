caption: Antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of polyphenols in relation to
  Nrf2 pathway. The molecular mechanisms of activation of the Keap1-Nrf2 system by
  polyphenolic compounds are shown in this figure. Under normal condition, the excess
  uptake of iodide through the cell membrane was inhibited via Nrf2 activation, and
  on the other hand, in thyroid cancer condition, oxidative stress was inhibited via
  antioxidant enzymes.
