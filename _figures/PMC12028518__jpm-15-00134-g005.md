caption: The expression of the GNPDA1 signaling pathway in breast cancer (MetaCore).
  This platform analyzed 10% of co-expressed genes that are correlated with GNPDA1
  with a Spearman partial rho of ≥0.3. (A) Pathway distribution. We found that BRCA1
  and BRCA2 were correlated with breast cancer development (with p < 0.05 as a cutoff
  value). (B) The signaling pathway of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in patients with breast cancer
