caption: Graphic representation of the classic modes of insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2
  signal transduction. Insulin binds to the ectodomain of the insulin receptor and
  activates both the PI3-kinase and Akt pathway (blue) and the Ras and MAP kinase
  pathway (salmon pink). Activation of the Akt pathway results in translocation of
  GLUT4-positive intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane and increased uptake
  of glucose, activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and the conversion of glucose
  to glycogen, and activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  and the conversion of glucose into the substrate for fatty acid synthesis. Activation
  of the MAP kinase pathway leads to increased expression of enzymes in the glycolytic
  pathway and preferential metabolism of glucose for energy. IGF-1 or IGF-2 (IGFs)
  bind to the ectodomain of type I IGF receptor and activate both the PI3-kinase and
  Akt pathway (blue) and the Ras and MAP kinase pathway (salmon pink). Activation
  of the Akt pathway results in inhibition of the Bcl-2 family of stress detection
  proteins and activation of GSK3β, both of which increase cell survival. Activation
  of the MAP kinase pathway leads to increased expression of genes that encode proteins
  important in regulation of cell cycle progression and hence to increased proliferation.
