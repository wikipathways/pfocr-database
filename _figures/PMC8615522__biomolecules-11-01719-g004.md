caption: 'A simplified model of the transcriptional network of JA-signaling in BIA
  biosynthesis in C. japonica cultured cells and E. californica roots and cultured
  cells. Boxes with straight lines indicate regulator genes, including promoter regions.
  Black arrows and T-shaped lines indicate upregulation and inhibition, respectively.
  Broken lines show indirect or undetermined steps that are possibly involved in uncharacterized
  proteins or unidentified regulation. Gray dashed lines indicate degradation steps.
  Biosynthetic enzyme genes involved in late morphine pathway such as T6ODM, NISO,
  COR, and CODM might be controlled by laticifer-specific regulation, which remains
  to be determined. Since the functions of COI1, JAZ, and MYC2 proteins in BIA biosynthesis
  are not fully characterized, it is still unknown whether the expression of WRKY1,
  bHLH1, and several ERF genes is regulated by MYC2. Unphosphorylated WRKY1 is degraded
  by 26S proteasome, while unknown tyrosine kinase(s) and protease(s) might be involved
  in the phosphorylation and degradation of WRKY1, respectively, in C. japonica. BIA
  biosynthesis is regulated by several non-MYC2-type bHLH TFs (CjbHLH1 in C. japonica
  and EcbHLH1-1/2 in E. californica), while only bHLH1 is described here. ERF2, ERF3,
  and ERF4 genes are clustered in the same E. californica genome scaffold, Eca_sc006292.1.
