caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for furaquinocin. With initiation by the diazotization
  of 3 through Fur5, furaquinocin is biosynthesized in the reduced hydroquinone form
  via N2 gas emission and subsequent modification reactions. The equilibrium between
  5 and 6 is biased toward 6 because of the introduction of an electron-withdrawing
  diazo group into 3, thereby allowing the subsequent nonenzymatic diazo group elimination
  in 6 to proceed. The diazo group in 6 is removed as nitrogen gas by the action of
  NADPH to facilitate the reaction. See the text for details on the other reaction
  steps
