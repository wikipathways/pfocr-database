caption: The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. Signalling through this pathway can be initiated
  through growth factor ligation of specific receptors. PI3K is then activated which
  leads to formation of PIP3 that activates/phosphorylates Akt. PTEN has PI3K-opposing
  effect on the equilibrium between PIP2 and PIP3, thereby inhibiting activation of
  Akt and its downstream partners. Final activation of Akt is mediated by PDK-1 and
  mTORC2. mTORC1 is activated by Akt, and is inhibited by rapamycin, AMPK and the
  TSC1/TSC2 complex. Akt is a negative regulator of the latter. Green colour indicates
  inhibitory activity, red colour indicates activation of signalling through the pathway.
