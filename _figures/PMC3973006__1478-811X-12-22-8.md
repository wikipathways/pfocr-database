caption: 'Schematic model of TGFβ signaling pathways for CRP2 induction in VSMCs.
  Upon TGFβ stimulation, two signaling axes are activated: the canonical TβRI-dependent
  Smad2/3 pathway and the non-canonical ATF2 pathway. In the canonical pathway, activated
  Smad2/3 form a complex with Smad4, translocates into the nucleus, and binds to SBE
  site at −445 of the Csrp2 promoter. In the non-canonical pathway, following TβRII
  binding of TGFβ, TβRII (without the requirement of TβRII’s cytoplasmic kinase domain)
  activates Src family kinase (SFK), which in turn activates RhoA. Enhanced RhoA activation
  leads to ROCK activation and increased JNK phosphorylation, resulting in enhanced
  ATF2 phosphorylation. Activated ATF2 dimer binds to CRE site at −461. The two signaling
  pathways (ATF2 and Smad) converge on the CRE and SBE sites of the Csrp2 promoter
  to cooperatively control CRP2 induction in VSMCs, which represents a previously
  unrecognized mechanism of VSMC gene induction by TGFβ.'
