caption: The regulatory network involved in the petal development of apetalous “APL01.”
  The regulatory network mainly consists of the CHR11-PLP pathway, 12 unconditional
  eQTLs of TGs, and nine QTLs for PDgr. The CHR11-PLP pathway contains 29 tQTTs and
  12 unconditional eQTLs, representing 41 kinds of regulatory relationships. The three
  eQTLs negatively regulating CHR11 expression are uqCHR11C3, uqCHR11C4-1, and uqCHR11C4-2.
  Genes marked in red are up-regulated, while genes marked in green are down-regulated
  in “APL01” compared with those in “Holly.” Arrows represent the positive regulation
  of tQTTs for the downstream TGs, while blunted lines represent the negative regulation
  of tQTTs for the downstream TGs. Arrows or blunted solid lines marked indicate the
  regulatory relationships repeatedly detected in all two environments, while arrows
  or blunted dotted lines indicate the regulatory relationships only detected in one
  environment. In addition, there may be the AS2-PLP pathway regulating PLP expression,
  and this pathway consists of 21 tQTTs and 8 unconditional eQTLs, representing 29
  kinds of regulatory relationships.
