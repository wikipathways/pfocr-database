caption: A proposed schematic describes the mechanism of TRPM7-induced pyroptosis
  in SE. The up-regulated TRPM7 in SE cells increases the influx and accumulation
  of Zn2+, which induces ROS generation to further induces the activation of JAK2/STAT3
  pathway. Then p-STAT3 translocates to the nuclear to promote the transcription and
  expression of NLRP3 and TRPM7. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome triggers caspase-1
  activation, which cleaves and activates the IL-18 and IL-1β, and GSDMD. GSDMD-N
  terminal oligomerizes and form pores in plasma membrane where mature IL-1β and IL-18
  are released. Inhibiting TRPM7 with NS8593, p-STAT3 inhibitor Stattic and NLRP3
  inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 could reserve the hyperexcitability in SE models in
  vivo and in vitro
