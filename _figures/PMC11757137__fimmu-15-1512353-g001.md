caption: The role of m5C modifications in immune signaling regulation. (A) In NSUN2-deficient
  cells, ncRNAs transcribed by host RNA polymerase (Pol) III, particularly RPPH1 and
  7SL RNA, are significantly upregulated, leading to an increase in unshielded 7SL
  RNA in the cytoplasm. This 7SL RNA acts as a direct ligand for RIG-I-mediated interferon
  (IFN) responses. In NSUN2-deficient cells, inhibiting Pol III transcription or silencing
  RPPH1 and 7SL RNA suppresses IFN signaling, partially rescuing viral replication
  and gene expression. (B) RNA signals through human TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8, but the
  incorporation of modified nucleosides such as m5C abolishes this activity. Dendritic
  cells (DCs) exposed to such modified RNA express significantly fewer cytokines and
  activation markers compared to DCs treated with unmodified RNA. (C) NSUN2 activation
  maintains global m5C RNA methylation (including TREX2) and stabilizes TREX2 to limit
  cytoplasmic dsDNA accumulation and cGAS/STING activation, thereby reducing interferon
  production and promoting tumorigenesis and resistance to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy.
  Meanwhile, NSUN5-mediated 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification of GPX4 sustains redox
  homeostasis in colorectal cancer (COAD) by activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway,
  thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity
