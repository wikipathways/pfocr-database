caption: 'Proposed pathway for ANG II-induced activation of COX-2 protein synthesis
  in RASMC: 1) ANG II interacts with its receptor, producing activation of its respective
  G protein (presumably Gq); 2) phosphorylation of the receptor occurs and attracts
  the β-arrestin complex to the receptor; 3) the receptor-arrestin-NF-κB-activated
  complex is directed to early endosomes after release of phosphorylated IκBα; 4)
  the endosomal complex migrates to the nuclear area, where, through the putative
  β-arrestin-1 nuclear localization sequence (), the complex binds to the nuclear
  membrane; and 5) p50/65 enters the nucleus, binds to the NF-κB consensus sequence
  on prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (PTGS-2), and initiates transcription for
  the COX-2 protein. Targets of inhibition by Ro-106-9920, parthenolide, and curcumin
  are indicated.'
