caption: mTOR regulates BMP signaling in differentiation OPCs. Schematic illustrating
  mTOR regulation of BMP signaling in spinal cord OPCs. In control OPCs, mTOR either
  directly or indirectly inhibits BMPs and BMPR1. mTOR promotes FKBP12 expression
  and formation of the regulatory complex at the Id2 promoter. Compared to control
  cells, mTOR cKO OPCs have decreased expression of FKBP12, increased BMP signaling
  at the receptor, and increased downstream phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. When mTOR
  is inhibited, the levels of Sip1 and HDAC2 bound to the Id2 promoter are reduced,
  resulting in increased expression of Id2, an inhibitor of oligodendrocyte differentiation
