  ERK inhibition in the spinal cord of severe SMA-like mice. A, Activation profile
  of ERK/Elk-1 and AKT/CREB signaling pathways in lumbar spinal cord of vehicle-treated
  SMA-like mice compared with control. Large characters indicate activated molecules.
  B, Activation profile of ERK/Elk-1 and AKT/CREB signaling pathways in lumbar spinal
  cord of U0126-treated SMA-like mice compared with vehicle-treated SMA-like mice.
  Large characters indicate activated molecules.
