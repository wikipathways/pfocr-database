caption: 'Cell death regulation: Signalling pathways and potential sites for pharmacological
  intervention. Pathways promoting cell death via extrinsic and intrinsic signalling
  are shown to the left, and cytoprotective pathways, to the right, although the outcome
  of signalling depends on signal intensity, frequency and other signals, and the
  micro-environment. Red arrows indicate sites of pharmaceutical intervention, for
  example, agonists and antagonists of prostaglandin receptors (PGRs), antagonists
  of Ca2+ transport (Ca2+ antag), growth factor (GF) inhibitors and lipoxygenase inhibitors
  (LO inhib). Both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are activated by HUFA release
  and inhibited by PGs of E, F and D series via PGR signalling to PKC and cAMP. Reactive
  oxygen intermediates (ROS) may activate stress kinases, including extracellular
  regulated protein kinase (ERK). ROS may elicit DNA damage, whose repair is controlled
  by sensors and repair processes involving p53, acetylation/ubiquitylation and autophagy,
  controlled by autophagy genes and mTOR kinase. These pathways are inhibited by lysosome
  stabilizers (Lys inhib). Cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) also activates NF-κB,
  and inhibits cell cycle progression via cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin
  D1. ROS may also activate the intrinsic pathway by depolarizing the mitochondrial
  membrane (σψm), leading to cytochrome release and apoptosis, via caspases 9 and
  3. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) plays a role in gene expression, cell division
  and signal transduction. PP2A is activated by ceramide, produced by hydrolysis of
  membrane sphingomyelin (SM) in response to stress-related stimuli. The cellular
  response to hypoxia is coordinated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), in tumour
  cells this leads to up-regulation of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial
  growth factor. Disorders of HUFA metabolism have been identified in mitochondrial
  carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT), which transport HUFA into mitochondria. Sphingosine-1-phosphate
  (S1P) enhances survival by signalling cell adhesion in colon cancer and certain
  leukaemias. Transcellular signalling is shown, as PGs and their anandamide derivatives,
  lipoxygenase products (LT, HETE) and GFs released from activated cells, together
  with shorter range mediators such as Ca2+, NO, AA and ROS, all of which may act
  as micro-environmental factors controlling cell death.'
