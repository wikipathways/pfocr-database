caption: Copper plays an important role in extracellular matrix (ECM) construction
  and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which are two key aspects of tumor
  metastasis. Copper promotes the secretion of LOX by tumor cells but inhibits the
  degradation of the structural stability of HIF-1α. There also exists a reciprocal
  relationship between LOX and HIF-1α. LOX promotes ECM formation by facilitating
  the cross-linking of collagen and elastin. Increased HIF-1α promotes the adaptation
  of tumor cells to the hypoxic environment while promoting EMT through interactions
  with the hypoxia response element (HRE) and the HIF1-α-Snail/Twist signaling pathway.
  Together, these factors promote the development of tumor metastasis.
