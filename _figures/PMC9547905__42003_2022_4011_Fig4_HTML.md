caption: 'The six identified genes can be grouped into two categories: global sphingomyelin
  synthesis and synthesis and degradation of sphingosine-1-phosphate. The selected
  SM ratio is colored orange, other SM species are in green (light green: non-targeted
  metabolomics in Shin et al.; dark green: targeted metabolomics in ADNI and Draisma
  et al.), and genes are in dark yellow. S1P Sphingosine-1-phosphate, SM sphingomyelin
  species.'
