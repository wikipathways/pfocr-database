caption: 'a | Organization of the neurovascular unit, which functions to supply glucose
  (Glc) to neurons. b | Astrocytes produce ATP mainly via aerobic glycolysis (glucose
  to pyruvate (Pyr)), yet also exploit oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria (ovals)
  to generate ATP using the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Astrocytes supply glucose
  to neurons and oligodendrocytes from capillaries and endogenous stores of glycogen,
  a reversible transformation. Astrocytes take up glutamate (Glu) released from synapses
  and convert it into glutamine (Gln), which is sent to neurons: this metabolically
  costly operation relieves neurons of an energetic burden. Some glutamate and glutamine
  contributes carbon to the TCA cycle via the intermediate α-ketoglutarate (α-KG).
  Astrocytic generation of ketones from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and uptake
  of lactate (Lac) and medium-chain fatty acids is not shown for clarity. c | Oligodendrocytes
  insulate axons with myelin and deliver lactate to axons, which is transformed into
  pyruvate and then ATP by mitochondria. Axons promote their own energy supply by
  releasing glutamate to stimulate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) on oligodendrocytes;
  this promotes membrane insertion of GLUT1 and increased oligodendrocyte uptake of
  glucose delivered as lactate to axons. d | Microglia support neurons by clearing
  pathogens, waste and toxic proteins but do not provide them with energy. They generate
  ATP mainly from glucose but also from free fatty acids and glutamine. Fatty acid
  and fructose (prominent in ‘modern diets’) uptake by microglia is linked to neuroinflammation
  in neurodegenerative disorders of ageing. e | Neurons use transporters to acquire
  glucose and lactate from astrocytes or the vasculature. Food, adipose tissue and
  gut microbiota yield short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and triglycerides (TGs), which
  are transformed by the liver into the ketones d-β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate
  (AcAc), which are taken up by neurons. Glucose enters the TCA cycle via pyruvate
  and acetyl coenzyme A to yield ATP or the pentose phosphate pathway to provide (via
  glucose 6-phosphate (G6P)) the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and nucleosides. Neurons
  also generate some ATP by aerobic glycolysis. Microtubule transport of mitochondria
  and other cargo is driven by ATP, partially generated by ‘onboard’ glycolytic enzymes.
