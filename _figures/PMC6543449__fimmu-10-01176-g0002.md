caption: 'Schematic representation of IRFs in the TLR and IFN pathways. The three
  subfamilies of IFN signal through distinct receptors: IFN-II signals via a receptor
  which consist of two interferon gamma receptor (IFNγR)-1 and two IFNγR-2 chains
  (first left). IFN-I signal via the IFNAR receptor expressed in nearly all cell types
  and tissues (second left). IFN-III subfamily uses the interferon lambda receptor
  consisting of IL10R2 and IFNLR1 (third from left). While the signaling of IFNAR
  and IFN-lambda relies on phosphorylation of JAK1 and tyrosine kinase 2 TYK2, the
  interferon gamma receptor triggers STAT signaling via phosphorylation of JAK1 and
  JAK2. IFN-II specifically triggers STAT1 homodimer formation (most left), while
  IFN-I and IFN-III trigger ISGF3, (second from left), or STAT2/IRF9 in absence of
  ISGF3 (third of left). These complexes translocate to the nucleus to bind DNA on
  recognition sequences (GAS or ISRE, see bottom-left). The initial IFN stimulation
  leads to the early expression of ISGs and the transcription of IRF1/5/7/8/9 and
  STAT1, STAT2. The accumulation of newly synthesized transcription factors leads
  to a secondary, prolonged wave of ISG expression (bottom-left), contributing to
  antiviral activity and host defense. TLR4 signaling occurs through a MyD88-dependent
  (middle-right) and MyD88 independent (right) signaling cascade. In the MyD88 dependent
  signaling MyD88 recruits IRAK4 and IRAK1 leading to their phosphorylation, which
  in turn associates IRAK with TRAF6. TRAF6 activates TAK1, which in turn leads to
  phosphorylation of IKKα/β. The phosphorylation of these proteins results in their
  degradation and enables the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus where it binds
  NF-κB binding sites (middle-right). The MyD88 independent signaling activates TRIF,
  which in turn via IKKε and TBK1 signaling phosphorylate IRF3 and IRF7 at their C-terminal
  serine/threonine cluster (right). Upon phosphorylation these IRFs translocate to
  the nucleus and bind ISRE or PRD sites on the DNA. TLR3 (most-right) also signals
  through TRAF and IRF3, or via the PI3K-Akt pathway. TLR7 and 9 signaling (right,
  down) goes via MyD88, TRAF, and IRF7, or via phosphorylation of IRF5. Down below
  in the figure the subsequent DNA recognition sites are listed, together with the
  general biological effects of gene activation, such as interferon production, prolonged
  ISG production and host defense. TLR3 and 4 signaling leads to upregulation of IFN
  beta, triggering the IFN-I pathway. This, together with the IRFs whose expression
  is upregulated by pathway activation (listed down below in the figure) provide cross-talk
  between the TLR and IFN pathways (pink arrow).'
