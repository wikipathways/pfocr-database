caption: IL23 in the development and activation of Th17 cells. In chronic inflammation,
  antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells and macrophages are the main producers
  of IL23, which promotes together with other cytokines like IL1, IL6 and TGFβ the
  development of IL17 producing pathogenic Th17 cells. The differentiation of Th17
  cells is prompted by the synergistically working of STAT3 and RORγt leading to the
  upregulation of the IL23R on Th17 cells and the release of other pro-inflammatory
  cytokines like IL17A, IL17F, IL6 or TNFα. This in turn leads to the production of
  IL23 mainly by macrophages. IL23 is on the one hand important for the maintenance
  and expansion of the Th17 lineage and in addition acts mainly on macrophages in
  an autocrine manner.
