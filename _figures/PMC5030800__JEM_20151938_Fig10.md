caption: A model of the regulation of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy by cathepsin
  B in response to infection with F. novicida. (A) Cathepsin B mediates cleavage of
  the TRPML1 channel and negatively regulates calcineurin (Cn) activity. (B) Deficiency
  in cathepsin B results in inhibition of mTOR activation owing to a stressed signal
  from the impaired lysosomal degradation. Both increased calcineurin and decreased
  mTOR activity in Ctsb−/− BMDMs drive nuclear translocation of TFEB, which in turn
  activates the transcription of genes associated with lysosome biogenesis and autophagy.
  (C) Stressed signals from the lysosome or a feedback signal from increased lysosomal
  biogenesis induces AMPK and ULK1 phosphorylation, which further activates the autophagy
  pathway. Thus, cathepsin B negatively regulates lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy
  at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Increased lysosomal biogenesis
  and autophagy induced by cathepsin B deficiency results in effective clearance of
  the intracellular bacterial pathogen F. novicida. Red arrow, induced or reduced
  activity; black arrow, activation; black line with bar head, inhibition; solid line,
  activated; dash line, not activated.
