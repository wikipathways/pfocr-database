caption: The coexpression network involved in the photosynthetic pathway in Populus.
  The putative regulatory network of PEGs (blue circles), lncRNAs (orange circles)
  and miRNAs (green circles) constructed by coexpression analysis and ncRNA prediction.
  The blue, orange and green lines represent the PEG–PEG, lncRNA‐PEG and miRNA‐PEG
  interactions, respectively. The dotted lines indicate potential interactions, including
  coexpression interactions and the interactions of lncRNAs with their putative target
  PEGs; the solid lines indicate interactions verified by degradome sequencing.
