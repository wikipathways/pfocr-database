caption: 'Proposed model for the role of IGFs in multipotent neural progenitor cell
  fate specification: oligodendroglial and neuronal fate commitment at the expense
  of astroglial fates? (A) BMP signaling has been shown to stimulate astroglial differentiation
  and inhibit neuronal and oligodendroglial differentiation. (B) Activation of the
  IGF-I receptor on multipotent neural progenitor cells by IGFs leads to the up-regulation
  of Noggin, Smad6, and Smad7. Because Noggin, Smad6, and Smad7 inhibit BMP signaling,
  the net effects of IGF signaling are a block in astrocyte differentiation and an
  induction of neuronal and oligodendroglial differentiation. Alternatively, IGF-instructive
  effects on oligodendrocyte differentiation could occur in a Noggin/Smad6, Smad7-independent
  pathway.'
