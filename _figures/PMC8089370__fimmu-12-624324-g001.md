caption: (A) Positive and (B) negative molecular regulations of SLC1A5, SLC3A2, and
  SLC7A5. SLC3A2, a type II membrane protein, dimerizes with the nutrient transporter
  SLC7A5 to allow their localization to the plasma membrane. SLC1A5, the sodium dependent
  antiporter exchanges neutral amino acids (NAA) such as threonine, asparagine or
  serine for glutamine and the SLC3A2/SLC7A5 heterodimer exchanges glutamine for essential
  amino acids (EAAs), most importantly L-leucine. While the mTOR signaling pathway
  regulates the expression of SLC1A5, SLC3A2, and SLC7A5, these proteins can activate
  mTOR in a feed-forward mechanism through the influx of essential amino acids (EAAs),
  especially leucine. (1) mTORC1 regulates the translation and stability of the mRNA
  encoding the transcription factor ATF4, which in turn controls the transcription
  of SLC1A5, SLC3A2, and SLC7A5. (2) mTORC1 and the influx of EAAs regulate the expression
  of the transcription factor c-Myc, which binds the promoters of SLC1A5 and SLC7A5
  genes and upregulates their expression. (3) HIF-2α, a transcription factor that
  is activated in response to hypoxic conditions, binds to the promoter of SLC1A5
  and SLC7A5 and activates their transcription. (4) YAP1 and TAZ bind to the promoter
  of SLC7A5 and activate its transcription. (5) The DNA- and RNA-binding protein YBX3
  enhances the stability of SLC7A5 and SLC3A2 transcripts by binding directly to their
  3’ UTRs and prevents their degradation. (6) Under nutrient stress, LLGL2 forms a
  trimeric complex with SLC7A5 and a regulator of membrane fusion, YKT6, allowing
  for the surface localization of SLC7A5 and thereby promoting cellular proliferation.
  (7) MARCH1 and MARCH8 ubiquitin ligases lead to the direct ubiquitination of SLC3A2
  and its degradation by endosomes and lysosomes.
