caption: The Keap1-dependent and Keap1-independent regulatory pathways of Nrf2. (A)
  When autophagic flux is impaired and p62 accumulates, p62 sequesters Keap1 into
  autophagosomes, preventing it from binding to Nrf2 and thereby leading to enhanced
  Nrf2 signaling. (B) The ARE/XRE sequences are located near the promoters of Nrf2-regulated
  genes, including Nrf2 itself, enabling it to regulate its own transcription. The
  Nrf2-sMaf heterodimer binds to ARE, promoting the expression of various cytoprotective
  genes that combat oxidative stress. (C) NF-κB translocates to the nucleus, where
  it associates with CBP and competes with Nrf2, thereby inhibiting Nrf2-mediated
  transactivation. (D) P21 and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) serve as binding partners for Nrf2,
  stabilizing it and modulating its activity
