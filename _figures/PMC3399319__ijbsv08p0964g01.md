caption: TGF-β signaling pathway. TGF-β ligand is secreted as a latent precursor protein,
  bound to LAP. Activation of TGF-β involves cleavage of LAP from the ligand, which
  then binds to the type II receptor, and drives hetero-tetramerization with the type
  I receptor. The canonical signaling pathway involves phosphorylation of R-Smads
  (mainly Smad2 and Smad3) by activated TβRI. Phosphorylated R-Smads form a complex
  with the Co-Smad (Smad4), which translocates into the nucleus to bind gene promoters
  and activate expression of target genes. There are several non-canonical (non-Smad)
  signaling pathways, whereby TGF-β signals through the TGF-β receptors to activate
  TGF-β activated kinase 1 (Tak1), Ras and PI3K as well as other pathways.
