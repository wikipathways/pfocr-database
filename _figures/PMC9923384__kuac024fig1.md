caption: Metabolic map of major fermentation products and potential for lactate cross-feeding
  in an anaerobic co-culture system composed of anaerobic fungi and anaerobic bacterium
  C. acetobutylicum. The breakdown of plant biomass (lignocellulose or cellulose)
  is carried out by enzymes secreted by anaerobic fungi, enabling conversion of released
  glucose by the fungus and bacteria. Major metabolic steps in glucose utilization
  are shown for the anaerobic fungus A. robustus as well as the anaerobic bacterium
  C. acetobutylicum. Red text is used to denote primary products produced by C. acetobutylicum
  under solventogenesis conditions. Blue text denotes primary products produced by
  C. acetobutylicum under acidogenesis conditions. Lactate (circled) is produced by
  both C. acetobutylicum and anaerobic fungi and it is hypothesized that C. acetobutylicum
  can crossfeed lactate via a mechanism for lactate metabolism based on the lactate
  oxidation pathway in Acetobacterium woodii. This mechanism couples a flavin adenine
  dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent lactate dehydrogenase with an electron flavoprotein
  complex to convert a reduced ferredoxin, lactate, and two oxidized nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotides (NAD) to an oxidized ferredoxin, pyruvate, and two reduced
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NADH) (Detman et al., ; Schwalm et al., ). Bold
  arrows denote that the TPM count of at least one gene associated with the conversion
  is equal to or exceeds the median TPM count (491.85) for all genes expressed in
  the pathways shown via RNA-Seq. TPM counts for individual genes can be found in
  the . Annotations were obtained from Crown, et al.,  and Dash et al., ; genes associated
  with lactate formation were obtained from KEGG (Crown et al., ; Dash et al., ; Ogata
  et al., ). Genes associated with lactate formation are also in agreement with i802
  C. acetobutylicum model (Dash et al., ). Image made using Biorender.
