caption: 'Biobanking for precision medicine in oncology. Practical example of the
  potential of biobanking for precision medicine in oncology. The pathway of a given
  patient is illustrated depicting the possible contribution of biobanking in the
  patient’s clinical history, either in early or advanced disease stage. Provided
  that informed consent is signed by the patient, different biological specimens may
  be collected. In the preoperative phase, samples can be obtained through fine-needle
  aspiration and core-needle biopsy. The same applies to metastatic lesions that are
  typically investigated to confirm the origin of the disease and to perform biomarker
  analyses for additional therapeutic strategies. In early-stage disease, patients
  undergo surgical resection. In each step, the pathologists play a key role in managing
  the preanalytical phase and ensuring that sampling is appropriate and does not impact
  the final diagnosis. Specimens (in particular surgical specimens) can be freshly
  sampled and used for the preparation of disease models (such as primary cell culture,
  PDO and PDX). Tissues can also be snap frozen and are always formalin-fixed and
  paraffin-embedded (FFPE) for diagnostic purposes. From tissue sections, proteins
  and nucleic acids for high-throughput genomic analyses can be obtained. Finally,
  tissue sections can now be systematically digitally scanned to foster the creation
  of a digital pathology archive. This wealth of tissue-related data stemming from
  different analyses can be exploited for the development of artificial intelligence
  (AI) approaches. Blood, urine, faecal samples and swabs can also be collected throughout
  the course of the disease. Longitudinal sampling may be performed during therapy
  and over the follow-up period. Circulating tumour cells, nucleic acids and vesicles
  can be isolated from blood samples (liquid biopsy). (This image was created with
