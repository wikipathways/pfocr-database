caption: Regulation of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis upon CMV infection
  in pepper. (A) The ethylene biosynthesis pathway and key enzymes. (B) Ethylene biosynthesis-associated
  genes upregulated in response to CMV infection. The changes in gene expression were
  calculated using a log scale of the FPKM data obtained using RNA-seq.
