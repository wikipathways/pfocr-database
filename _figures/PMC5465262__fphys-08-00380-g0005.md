caption: Overview of pathways involved in aqp-8 regulation. The overview illustrates
  the signaling pathways involved in aqp-8 regulation. Genes connected to or involved
  in the diverse pathways are depict in light blue. Represented in light gray are
  the identified components of osmotic stress response pathway leading to glycerol
  accumulation. A dashed line indicates the unknown components of the gpdh-1 activation
  pathway.
