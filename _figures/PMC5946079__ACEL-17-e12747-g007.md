caption: Model for the interactions between the autophagy and CncC/Keap1 signaling
  pathway in mutant lamin‐induced cardiac disease. Cellular and metabolic stress is
  triggered by the abnormal aggregation of nuclear envelope proteins in the cytoplasm
  (red and yellow circles with irregular margins), leading to increased levels of
  Ref(2)P (p62). Sequestration of Keap1 by Ref(2)P allows CncC (Nrf2) to enter the
  nucleus and activate antioxidant genes. Exhaustion of the antioxidant system is
  hypothesized to cause redox imbalance, potentially through mitochondrial dysfunction
  and dysregulation of energy homeostasis. Upregulation of Ref(2)P leads to activation
  of TOR, inactivation of autophagy, and inactivation of AMPK. Simultaneous over‐expression
  of Atg1 and inhibition of CncC suppressed cytoplasmic aggregation of LamC and restored
  cardiac contractility and lifespan
