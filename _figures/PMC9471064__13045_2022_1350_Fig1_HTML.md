caption: 'Core molecular mechanism of apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, mitotic catastrophe,
  necroptosis, and anoikis. a There are two well-known signal transduction cascades
  regulating cell apoptosis: the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway
  is activated by death receptors and death ligands, while the intrinsic pathway is
  initiated by cellular stress-mediated mitochondria dysfunction. b The formation
  of the autophagosome depends on the formation of a complex incorporating Beclin-1,
  which is regulated by mTOR. Moreover, various proteins and signaling molecules (AMPK,
  PI3K, p62, etc.) are involved in the regulation of autophagy. c Ferroptosis is a
  type of regulated cell death that is induced by the iron-dependent accumulation
  of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation, the inhibition of
  cystine/glutamate antiporter, and the loss of activity of glutathione peroxidase
  4 (GPX4). d The cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B1 complex is an important
  component of mitotic catastrophe and can promote cell cycle transition from G2 phase
  to M phase. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, mitotic defects, and cytokinesis
  failure are the three key factors leading to mitotic catastrophes. e Necroptosis
  is a form of regulated necrotic cell death stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-α
  (TNF-α). After TNFα binds to the receptor, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)
  recruits TNFRSF1A associated via death domain (TRADD), Fas associated via death
  domain (FADD), receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase protein (RIPK) 1, TNF
  receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and other proteins to form complex I, and then
  RIPK1 is deubiquitinated to promote the transformation of complex I to complex II.
  When caspase-8 is inhibited, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), RIPK1,
  and RIPK3 are recruited to form necrosome through phosphorylation, which eventually
  triggers necroptosis. f Anoikis induces cell death through conventional apoptotic
  pathways. B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) related proteins are widely involved in anoikis
  regulation, and multiple protein kinases are involved in the signal transduction
  of anoikis. When cells detach from the extracellular matrix (ECM), pro-survival
  signals cannot be activated, but the death receptors and mitochondrial apoptotic
  pathways are activated to prevent adherent-independent cell growth and attachment,
  and finally activate anoikis to induce cell death'
