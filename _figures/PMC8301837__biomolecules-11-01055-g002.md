caption: Putative substrates and speculated consequences of their SUMOylation in Schwann
  cells during PNS development. Sumo2 was found to be enriched in Schwann cell protrusions
  extending towards neuronal preparations, suggesting that SUMOylation may be involved
  in axoglial interaction and myelination. Rac1 is necessary for proper radial sorting
  and myelination by Schwann cells through the formation of radial lamellipodia, and,
  in MEFs, Rac1 SUMOylation is required for GTP loading/GTPase activity consequently
  leading to lamellipodia-ruffle formation. SUMOylation may control Schwann cell proliferation
  and differentiation by stimulating the autophosphorylation and subsequent activation
  of the Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK). The stability and degradation of the effector
  of the Hippo pathway YAP could be modulated by SUMO conjugation in Schwann cells
  consequently affecting their functioning. Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) is required for
  proper peripheral nerve myelination by Schwann cells, where SUMOylation may affect
  its interaction with other proteins (such as AMPK) and translocation to the nucleus.
  Similarly, SUMOylation of Lipin-1 enhances its nuclear shuttling and its function
  as a transcriptional co-activator in neurons; this might be a conserved mechanism
  in Schwann cells thus regulating lipid metabolism. SUMOylation could be also involved
  in the regulation of Schwann cell gene expression by affecting the transcriptional
  activity of SOX10 and/or by epigenetic mechanisms mediated by the histone deacetylases
  HDAC1/2. Krox20, a critical regulator of Schwann cells, acts as a E3 ligase facilitating
  the SUMOylation of Nab proteins, possibly impacting on development and myelination
  of peripheral nerves. SUMOylation may also affect negative regulators of myelination,
  like the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD); its modification by SUMO conjugation
  prevents shuttling to the nucleus and therefore reduces the transcription of downstream
  target genes. The downregulation of Notch signaling by Krox20, which notably can
  act as a SUMO ligase, is necessary for the normal onset of myelination. Although
  not directly demonstrated, the cell adhesion molecule L1 seems to be SUMOylated
  in Schwann cells, which promotes its cleavage by cathepsin E and subsequent translocation
  to the nucleus.
