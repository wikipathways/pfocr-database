caption: Major AGTR1 signalling pathways linked to cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis
  and EMT. AngII activated AGTR1 recruits a CARMA3-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome,
  which activates NFκB downstream signalling. CARMA3 protein might act as a scaffold
  in recruiting Bcl 10, MALT 1 and IKKγ, the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex.
  Wherein MALT1 plays a key role in stimulating IKK activity by K63 linked polyubiquitination
  utilizing IKKγ as a substrate. The activation of this pathway leads to cell proliferation,
  survival and migration. AngII activation of AGTR1 also leads to EGFR transactivation
  via ROS‐ dependent Src kinase activation, phosphorylating EGFR and the adaptor proteins
  GRB2 and SHC, resulting in prolonged EGFR–ERK signalling. Continuous Ang II stimulation
  may direct alterations in the gene expression and induce phenotypic change from
  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
