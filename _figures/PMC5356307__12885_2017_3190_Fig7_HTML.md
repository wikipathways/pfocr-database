caption: Model describing the effect of a synergy between extracellular TGF-β1 and
  Hsp90β on downstream signalling in colon cancer cells. a In the presence of TGF-β1
  alone, binding to the heterotetrameric TGF-βRI/II receptor complex triggers phosphorylation
  of Smad2/3 and subsequent activation of Smad4, whereupon the complex moves into
  the nucleus and triggers transcription of canonical Smad-responsive genes such as
  VEGF (tumour promoting) and Fas (tumour suppressing). b In the presence of both
  TGF-β1 and Hsp90β in the extracellular space, when binding of TGF-β1 to the TGF-βRI/II
  receptor complex is inhibited using SB431542, TGF-β1 and Hsp90β instead bind to
  αvβ6 integrin, triggering as yet unknown downstream non-Smad signalling pathways,
  culminating in the transcription of genes which promote metastatic behaviours including
  migration and anchorage-independent growth (AIG). This alternate pathway does not
  require inhibition of TGF-βRI/II and is constitutively active in SW620 cells, which
  represent a later stage of colon cancer compared to SW480 cells
