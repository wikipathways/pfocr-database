caption: Suspension cells of T. wilfordii were treated with methyl jasmonate and DMSO.
  0, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120, 240 represent the time points of each sample, CC means
  the control group of cells, and CM means the group of MJ-treated cells. Heat maps
  of these genes were plotted using MeV software (version 4.9.0). Error bars, mean ± SD
  (n = 3 biologically independent samples; * P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by
  2-sided Student’s t test). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
