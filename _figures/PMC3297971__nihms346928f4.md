caption: Protein Pathway Activation Map of SCC. A Cancer Landscape (CScape) Protein
  Pathway Activation Map (4 Top left) is shown using population averages of RPMA data
  from patients with AK and SCC. Higher fold differences in the SCC group are shown
  in increasing shades of red while higher fold differences in signaling in the AK
  group are shown in green. Each balloon pin is placed over the protein measured.
  Magnified views of the AMPK-mTOR pathway (green box, middle top) and RAS-RAF-ERK
  pathway (red box, middle bottom) are shown to reveal pathway detail. Linked pathway
  members from each pathway are numbered and the individual protein data are plotted
  as scatter plots for the statistically significant endpoints.
