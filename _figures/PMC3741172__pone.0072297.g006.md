caption: β-Amyloid triggers changes in Reelin glycosylation impairing its ability
  to form active covalent homodimers. Accordingly, altered Reelin complexes display
  a reduced efficiency to bind the ApoER2 receptor, fail to induce efficient tyrosine
  phosphorylation of Dab1, and to transduce the signaling pathway that modulates tau
  phosphorylation by inhibition of GSK3β. Soluble Aβ can also contribute to the impaired
  ability of Reelin to activate its signaling cascade. An imbalance in 14-3-3 levels
  is also triggered by the inefficient Reelin signaling.
