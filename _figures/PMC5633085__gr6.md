caption: Fibronectin-fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 translocations in TIO.Depicted
  is the putative chimeric protein generated by the fibronectin-fibroblast growth
  factor 1 (FN1-FGFR1) translocations that were identified in a subset of the phosphaturic
  mesenchymal tumors that cause tumor-induced osteomalacia (, , ). The chimeric protein
  includes the fibronectin extracellular autodimerization domain and the FGFR1 ligand
  binding, transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase signaling domain. As such,
  the receptor has the potential to autodimerize, resulting in ligand independent
  signaling. It can also dimerize after FGF23 binding, thus signaling in a ligand-dependent
  fashion. Transduction continues through the extracellular signal–regulated kinase
  pathway (ERK1/2) and/or the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. If Klotho
  is also expressed by PMTs, it is possible that FGF23 could bind and signal in a
  Klotho-dependent manner. This signaling could lead to increased transcription, translation,
  and secretion of FGF23 by tumor cells via a feed-forward system. (Figure modified
