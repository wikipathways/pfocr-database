caption: 'Targeted signalling pathway involved in endothelial cells (ECs) activation
  and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation and migration during intimal
  hyperplasia. The binding of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) to its
  receptor VEGFR2 on ECs activates the PI3K pathway. Activated PDK1 phosphorylates
  Akt at Thr308 then phosphorylates eNOS at Ser1177 activating eNOS. VEGFA aslo activates
  the PLCγ pathway which increase Ca2+ concentration and activates eNOS via calmodulin
  (CaM). The binding of VEGFA also activates Src kinase which then activates eNOS
  through two mechanisms: (1) phosphorylation of Tyr83 on eNOS; (2) phosphorylation
  of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) at Tyr300. Those phosphorylation causes the binding
  of HSP90 to eNOS and activates NO synthesis. Activated eNOS converts L-arginine
  in the presence of oxygen to L-citrulline and diffusible signalling molecule NO.
  NO secreted by ECs inhibits platelet aggregation to avoid thrombosis. NO diffuses
  into vessel walls, causing arterial vessels to relax and increase blood flow. The
  binding of agonist to G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCR) induces activation of Rho-kinase
  activity via GEF activation. The activity of RhoA is controlled by the guanine nucleotide
  exchange factors (GEFs) that catalyse the exchange of GDP for GTP. Rho-kinase activity
  is enhanced by binding to the active GTP-bound RhoA. However, this mechanism is
  negatively regulating eNOS activation for NO production. Diffused NO binds to its
  intracellular receptor soluble GC (sGC) which produces cGMP from GTP. The increase
  in intracellular cGMP concentration bind to cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs)
  and cGMP-gated ion channels results the increase of Ca2+ and relaxation of smooth
  muscle.'
