caption: Metabolic pathways of co-producing 1,3-PDO and 3-HP. The crucial intermediate
  3-HPA is used to produce 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) under the catalyzation of
  GabD4 via oxidation reaction, and the NAD+ is reduced to NADH which could be converted
  to NADPH. Meanwhile, 3-HPA is catalyzed to form 1,3-PDO by PDOR/YqhD in the presence
  of NADPH
