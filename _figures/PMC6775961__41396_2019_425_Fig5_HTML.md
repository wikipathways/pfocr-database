caption: Biosynthesis of nucleotide moieties, the pyrimidine and purine bases, as
  well as the C5-carbon from 13C-labeled methanol in methylotrophic methanogens based
  on previous studies [–] with final carbon contribution from methanol added besides
  the compounds. Black arrows indicate ribose synthesis and the blue arrows represent
  synthesis of base moieties in nucleosides. The reverse gluconeogenesis pathway is
  displayed in green and the reverse ribulose monophosphate pathway in pink
