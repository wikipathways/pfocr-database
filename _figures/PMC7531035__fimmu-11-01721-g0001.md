caption: This figure shows the immunosuppressive microenvironment mediated by PD-1/PD-L1
  pathway. CAF, Cancer-associated fibroblasts; TAM, Tumor-associated macrophages;
  Treg, regulatory T cells. (A) PD-L1 on tumor cells combines with PD-1 on cytotoxic
  T cells transmits an inhibitory second signal to T cells, causing effector T cells
  exhaustion, dysfunction and tumor progression. At the same time, PD-L1 can act as
  a ligand to bind with CD80 on effector T cells, competitively inhibits the binding
  of costimulatory molecule CD28 with CD80, and hinders T cell activation. (B) PD-L1
  also binds to PD-1 on Tregs, resulting in immune suppression by raising the threshold
  for T-cell activation. (C) For NK cells, PD-1 represents an “activated” phenotype
  and binds to PD-L1 on tumor cells or stromal cells, leading to its dysfunction.
  (D) Activation of PD-1 signals on B cells can inhibit the proliferation of CD4+
  and CD8 T+ cells. (E) Activated CD4+ T helper cells modulated the up-regulation
  of PD-L1 expression on macrophages via IFN-γ, and TAMs could mediate adaptive resistance
  and dampen tumor specific T cell function based on PD-L1 expression. (F) HNSCC tumor
  cells recruit fibroblasts and up-regulate PD-L1 expression on fibroblasts. Conversely,
  fibroblasts can increase PD-L1 expression on HNSCC cells. (G) PD-L1 on tumor cells
  binding with PD-1 can transmit anti-apoptotic signals to the tumor themselves. (H)
  PD-1 antibodies can competitively inhibit the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1, while PD-L1
  antibodies bind to PD-1, and they both inhibit the activation of the PD-1/PD-L1
  signal pathway and reverse the suppressive effect.
