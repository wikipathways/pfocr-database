caption: Sphingolipid metabolism pathway. Ceramide acts as the central molecule of
  the sphingolipid metabolism pathway. Ceramide may be synthesized through either
  the de novo (blue text and arrows) or the salvage pathway (orange text and arrows).
  Synthesis of ceramide through the de novo pathway occurs through serine palmitoyltransferase
  (SPT), 3-ketosphinganine reductase, (dihydro)CerS1-6 (which determine fatty acyl
  chain length), and finally dihydroceramide desaturase (DES). Ceramide synthesis
  through the salvage pathway occurs through conversion of sphingosine-1-phosphate
  by S1P-phosphatase (S1PP) and (dihydro)CerS1-6. Ceramide may be metabolized to produce
  sphingosine 1-phosphate by ceramidases (CDases) and sphingosine kinase 1/2 (SphK1/2).
  Sphingosine-1-phosphate can be hydrolyzed by sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase (S1P
  lyase) to ethanolamine 1-phosphate and C16 fatty aldehyde. Ceramide may also be
  used as a substrate for the generation of complex sphingolipids via conversion to
  glucosylceramide (GlcCer) by glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) (green arrows and text).
  Glucosylceramidase (GlcCDase) and galactosylceramidase (GCDase) (cerebrosides) catalyze
  conversion of complex sphingolipids back to ceramide. Ceramide may also be used
  as a substrate for sphingomyelin through sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) or ceramide
  1-phosphate through ceramide kinase (CERK). Sphingomyelin can similarly be broken
  down by sphingomyelinase (SMase) to produce ceramide once again. Created with BioRender.com
