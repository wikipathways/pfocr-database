caption: GAS6-AXL signaling induces actin remodeling that drives membrane ruffling,
  macropinocytosis, FA disassembly, and cancer-cell invasion. Upon GAS6 binding, AXL
  activates RAS and associates with two regulatory subunits of PI3K, p85-α and p85-β,
  that induce PI3K and RAC1. This triggers membrane ruffling, PRs and CDRs, that drives
  internalization of GAS6-AXL complexes via macropinocytosis. Macropinocytic uptake
  of extracellular proteins improves growth of cancer cells in a nutrient-poor environment.
  In parallel, GAS6-induced CDRs contribute to the disassembly of FAs through recruitment
  of their components, thus preparing cells for mesenchymal migration. Altogether,
  activation of AXL-PI3K-RAC1 signaling induces cancer-cell invasion.
