caption: OPG can bind to various cell surface receptors such as Syndecan-1, membranous
  RANKL, and αVβ5 integrin in order to trigger different cell survival pathways particularly,
  ERK, PI-3K/Akt pathway which results in expression of various cell survival favorable
  genes. Simultaneously, stable β-catenin of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  which is turned on in the majority of cancer cells, translocate to nucleus and turns
  on OPG gene expression. The OPG gets secreted out of the cell in the microenvironment,
  and can exert its paracrine and autocrine effects. The released OPG can affect the
  nearby healthy cells thus driving them towards tumorigenesis. The released OPG can
  also exert autocrine effects on the cancer cells by binding to cell surface receptors.
  The binding of OPG turns on the vicious cell survival signaling in cancer cells
  thus favoring their growth, proliferation, survival, angiogenesis [].
