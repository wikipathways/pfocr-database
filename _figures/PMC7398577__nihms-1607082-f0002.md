caption: Overview of viral miR-mediated suppression of host innate immune pathways.
  The illustration summarizes known mechanisms by which individual viral miR interact
  with host genes involved in virus recognition and activation of innate immune responses.
  Viral miR promote immune evasion by directly targeting host genes involved in the
  recognition of virion, virus-derived nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) or proteins to suppress
  antiviral pathways. Viral miR have evolved to target, essentially, all of the known
  viral defense mechanisms by targeting one or more critical components of the innate
  immune pathway. Functions of selected validated herpesvirus-encoded miR and host
  innate immunity genes are highlighted in the schematic. Viral miR inhibit production
  of proinflammatory cytokines and interferons that are required for recruitment and
  activation of adaptive arm of immunity, which can elicit robust antiviral response
  to contain herpesvirus infection by clearing infected cells
