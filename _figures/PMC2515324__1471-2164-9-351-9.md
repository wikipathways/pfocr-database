caption: Distribution of Actinidia ESTs in three ascorbic acid biosynthetic pathways.
  Previously published sequences in GenBank belonging to the three known ascorbic
  acid biosynthetic pathways in plants [] were used to identify genes in the Actinidia
  EST database using BLAST searches. The number of ESTs found in the Actinidia EST
  database for each step of each pathway is shown. Steps where no ESTs are noted have
  not had genes identified.
