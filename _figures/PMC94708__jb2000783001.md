caption: The DOXP pathway for biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursors IPP and DMAPP
  in E. coli. Gene products implicated in the pathway are boxed. The order of the
  reactions catalyzed by the products of ygbB, ygbP, and ychB is uncertain. Later
  reaction steps in the pathway remain to be determined. Note that a gene encoding
  IPI, although present in E. coli, is not routinely found in organisms that utilize
  the DOXP pathway (Table ). The plasmid pAC-LYC (), shown to the lower right, encodes
  enzymes (products of the crtE, crtB, and crtI genes) that lead to the synthesis
  of the pink isoprenoid lycopene from IPP and DMAPP. Cm, chloramphenicol resistance
  gene; G-3-P, d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; GAPD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
