caption: The crosstalk between gut microbiota and adipose tissues. On the one hand,
  the gut microbiota and microbial-derived metabolites may mediate the external factors,
  such as dietary foods, to regulate white adipose tissue (WAT) expansion, inflammation,
  and insulin resistance in obesity. Different diets may have different effects on
  the gut microbiota, such as low carbohydrate diet (LCD) () can increase Bacteroidaceae
  Bacteroides and reduce body weight effectively; whereas western diet (WD) () or
  high-fat diet (HFD) (, ) can increase dysbiosis of gut microbiota and inflammation
  of adipose tissues; and ketogenic diet (KD) () can increase A. muciniphila, Lactobacillus
  and regulate lipid metabolism through PPARα/FGF21 pathway. On the other hand, the
  gut microbiota and its metabolites may mediate environmental temperature, intermittent
  fasting (IF), or caloric restriction (CR) in the process of energy expenditure by
  promoting browning and thermogenesis of beige and brown adipose tissue (BAT). In
  the meantime, some adipokines, including leptin, adiponectin, FGF21, and apelin,
  produced by adipose tissues can act on the gut microbiota to modulate its composition.
