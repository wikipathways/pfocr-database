caption: Disturbed shear stress activates ECs and inhibits autophagy. Shear stress
  inhibits AMPKα and activates mTOR, two classical “autophagy switches,” to inhibit
  autophagy. Glycocalyxin acts as the first pass-through sensor in the face of shear
  stress, converting mechanical signals into physiological signals, which are then
  passed on through ion channels, caveolae, and integrins, amongst others (). Shear
  stress regulates endothelial cell behavior through GPCR and the mechano-sensing
  complex formed by VE-cadherin and VEGFR-2/VEGFR3, which stimulate PI3K/AKT signaling
  and activate integrins in an “outside-in” manner, leading to the cis-activation
  of GTPases and the regulation of the expression of various transcription factors
  (). This leads to the cis-activation of GTPases and promotes the expression of transcription
  factors. In addition, stimulated VE-cadherin and VEGFR2/VEGFR3 form a mechano-sensing
  complex that transmits signals to neighboring cells. At the same time, Ca2+ is stored
  in the endoplasmic reticulum via IP3R by the PLCβ/PIP2/IP3 signaling pathway in
  response to perturbed shear stress. Activation of non-selective cation channels
  such as TRPV4 and  leads to the influx of more Ca2+ and hyperpolarizes the membrane.
  At the same time, shear stress regulates platelet behavior by inducing the release
  of P-selectin and vWF from WPBs (). AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; mTOR, mammalian
