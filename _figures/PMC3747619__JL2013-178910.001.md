caption: Structure of key sphingolipid molecules. All sphingolipids are comprised
  of a sphingoid base, and in mammals sphingosine (mainly C-18) is the major sphingoid
  base (a). A long chain fatty acid attached to sphingosine through amide linkage
  forms ceramide (b). Complex sphingolipids are obtained by replacement of hydrogen
  group of ceramide (H*) with various functional head groups (represented as R group
  in (e)). Complex sphingolipids vary in the nature of the polar head groups. For
  example, in sphingomyelin the head group is phosphocholine whereas in glycosphingolipids
  the head group could be one or more sugar residues. The phosphorylated derivatives,
  namely, sphingosine-1-phosphate (c) and ceramide 1 phosphate (d), are obtained by
  action of respective kinases on sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate.
