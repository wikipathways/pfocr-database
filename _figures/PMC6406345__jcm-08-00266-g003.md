caption: Protein–protein interaction network of associated genes in the etiopathogenesis
  of ANCA-associated vasculitis. The size of the node indicates the number of noteworthy
  SNPs of each gene. This network includes noteworthy SNPs and GWAS SNPs. The variants
  are listed in . The yellow nodes represent the genes associated with the interferon-gamma-mediated
  signaling pathway.
