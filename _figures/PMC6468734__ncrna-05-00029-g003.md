caption: The activation of the type I IFN response impairs the activity and function
  of the small RNA biogenesis pathway. The microprocessor complex binding affinity
  and cleavage activity of pri-miRNA substrates is reduced upon IFN expression activation.
  IFNs also reduce Dicer protein levels and impair its cleavage activity. The function
  of the RISC complex is also modulated by the IFN response by poly-ADP-ribosylation
  of the essential component Ago2. The RLR LGP2 interferes with recognition and cleavage
  activity of Dicer on dsRNAs.
