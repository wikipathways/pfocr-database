caption: MiRNAs regulate tumor characteristics including apoptosis, invasion, EMT,
  and metastasis by regulating the UPR. a MiR-657 mimics can attenuate the CHOP expression
  to reverse apoptosis. Anticancer compounds downregulate the expression of miR-211
  in U937 and U266 cells. The downregulated miR-211 is associated with CHOP and triggers
  tumor cell apoptosis. MiR-34c overexpression significantly increased the levels
  of eIF2α and IRE1α by directly targeting the 3ʹUTR of HMGB1 and inhibiting HMGB1
  translation, promoting apoptosis. The expression of miR-216b directly targets c-JUN
  and inhibition of c-JUN sensitizes cells to apoptosis. MiR-451a increases apoptosis
  by suppressing BAP31 to induce ER stress. MiR-233 downregulates the heat shock protein
  70 (Hsp70) protein levels and downstream JNK/JUN signaling pathways, thereby enhancing
  apoptosis. JUN can bind to the promoter region of miR-223 to promote its transcription,
  forming a feedback loop. b Some chemotherapy drugs activate the PERK pathway by
  upregulating the expression levels of SNAI1 and ZEB1. LAMP3 is regulated by activation
  of the PERK/eIF2a/ATF4 arm of the UPR to promote lymph node metastasis. CHOP induced
  by PERK- eIF2α can bind to GDF15 and activate its transcription, regulating EMT
  and metastasis. MiR-410 directly targets ERLIN2 to up-regulate UPR components to
  inhibit the migration, invasion, and EMT of breast cancer cells. MiR-224/-520c-dependent
  TUSC3 deletion enhances NSCLC metastasis via increased ATF6α activity
