caption: Schematic of the roles of integrins in high-grade gliomas(1–3) GSCs secrete
  soluble factors that promote GSC maintenance and activate integrins and downstream
  pro-tumorigenic pathways in HGG., (4–5) ECM proteins can activate (green) or inhibit
  (red) integrin-mediated activation of proliferative, invasive, and migratory programs
  in glioma cells., ,  (6–8) Monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors that
  target integrins show therapeutic efficacy against endothelial-cell-mediated angiogenesis
  and glioma cell proliferation and can sensitize glioma cells to anti-EGFR treatment
  due to the formation of integrin-growth factor receptor complexes., (9) NK cells
  that infiltrate GBM tumors have suppressed antitumor activity as a result of cellular
  reprogramming, mediated by the TGFβ-integrin αV axis, where integrin αV upregulates
  MMPs, which then cleave and induce the release of mature TGFβ to inhibit NK cell-mediated
  GSC killing., (10–12) MMPs cleave VEGF from the ECM, which can then activate VEGFR
  in ECs to promote angiogenesis, but soluble VEGF can be sequestered by BVZ. CCN1,
