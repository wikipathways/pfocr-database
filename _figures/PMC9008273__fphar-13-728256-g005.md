caption: Serum metabolic network of potential DR biomarkers after oral administration
  of KLX based on the KEGG pathway database. The small red circle represents the biomarker
  detected in the study. The histogram represents the level of metabolites in the
  blood. Blue represents the control group, red represents the model group, and green
  represents the KLX-treated group. DR, diabetic retinopathy; KLX, keluoxin; KEGG,
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
