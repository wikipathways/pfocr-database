caption: Network representation of lncRNAs and miRNAs gene targets for prostate cell
  senescence. Only genes related to Cell Cycle and Cell Proliferation are presented.
  Gene Targets PDGFRB, PDGFRA, CCNE2, E2F2, EGFR, ZEB1 belonging to the Prostate Cancer
  KEGG pathway are highlighted (gold arrow) as are CCNB1, CCNB2, FOXM1, CCNA2, CDK1,
  CCNE2, CDC25A, E2F2, CDKN2A, MAPK13, RBL1 (green arrow) from the Cellular Senescence
  pathway. The lncRNAs MYBL, SERHL and SNHG5 are not depicted as they do not have
  any gene targets belonging to Cell Cycle and/or Cell Proliferation. Blue indicates
  down-regulated and red up-regulated in senescent cells relative to non-senescent
  cells. Genes are presented as rectangles, miRNAs as triangles, and lncRNAs as octagons.
