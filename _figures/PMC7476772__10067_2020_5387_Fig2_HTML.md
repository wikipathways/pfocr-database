caption: Immune Response to SARS-CoV2 & pharmacodynamics of rheumatology medications.
  This figure depicts (1) body’s immune response to SARS-CoV2 and (2) rheumatology
  meds (commonly prescribed) working at different levels. Cells—NK cells (null killer
  cells); APC, antigen presenting cell; enzyme/cytokines, COX-1, COX-2 = cyclo-oxygenase
  1, 2; IL-2, 6, 12 = interleukin 2, 6, 12; IFN, interferon A&B; medications—CQ/HCQ,
  chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine; NSAIDS, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; TLR/RLR,
  Toll-like receptor/retinoic acid inducible gene–like receptor (within macrophage);
  JAK/STAT pathway, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activation of transcription
  (depicted within T-helper cell). Immune response—Virus infection triggers innate
  immune response at site of infection (left side of figure); whereas the adaptive
  immune response (right side of dendrites/macrophage) occurs at lymphatic system.
  Each figure depicts various cells and its secretion. SARS-CoV2 infection triggers
  both innate and adaptive immunity. With innate immune response, the tissue injury/host
  infected cell is recognized by neutrophils, NK (null killer cells), macrophages,
  dendritic cells. Innate immunity focus on preventing instant spread of infection
  by recruiting more neutrophils, macrophages and NK cells. Dendritic and macrophage
  cell conveys message to antigen presenting cells, which in turn recruits pluripotent
  T cell. This pluripotent T cell secretes IL-12 (interleukin-12) and in turn gets
  differentiated into T-helper (CD4), cytotoxic T cell (CD8) and B cell. T-helper
  secrets IL-2 (interleukin-2) and IFN (interferon), whereas cytotoxic secrete IFN
  A, B (interferon A, B) and IL-12 (interleukin-12). Pharmacodynamics—red color–dotted
  lines indicate inhibition action of medications at specific site in a cell. Corticosteroids—inhibits
  phospholipase and thereby inhibiting leukotrienes, cycle-oxygenase production leading
  to less inflammation. NSAIDS—inhibits COX-2/ specific ones COX-1. CQ/HCQ (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine)—inhibits
  Toll receptor/RLR receptors at intracellular level within macrophage, leading to
  decreased IFN production. Baricitinib—inhibits JAK/STAT pathway within T-helper
  cells, leading to further deactivation of adaptive immunity. Toclizumab—inhibits
  Interleukin-6 production by dendritic cells further delaying recruitment and inflammation
