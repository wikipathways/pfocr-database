caption: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) regulate apoptosis in the extrinsic and
  intrinsic apoptotic pathways. sHSPs inhibit activation of caspase-8, -10 (a) or
  caspase-3 (b) to block apoptosis. sHSPs inhibit activation of the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway by interacting with bax, bak, or other members of the Bcl-2 family (c),
  or by inhibiting cytochrome c and Smac release from mitochondria, or binding with
  cytochrome c (d), or by inhibiting the p53-dependent activation of the proapoptotic
  Bcl-2 family members (e). sHSPs also interact with PKC or IkB to inhibit caspase-3
  activation (f).
