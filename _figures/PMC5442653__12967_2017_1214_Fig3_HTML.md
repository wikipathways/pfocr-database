caption: Diagram of the potential usage of nanoparticles for splenic targeting. Coating
  nanoparticles with red blood cell-like membrane may be helpful for increasing nanoparticle
  uptake by splenic leukocytes. These nanoparticles should then be conjugated with
  drugs targeting specific signaling pathway activated in spleen. a Drug-conjugated
  nanoparticles may then be ingested by macrophages within the red pulp or marginal
  zone upon circulation and distribution into the spleen. b These drugs then inhibit
  pathologically activated signals, such as mTOR signaling, to reverse liver-injury
  induced splenic perturbations. WP white pulp, MZ marginal zone, RP red pulp. The
  immunofluorescence image is from an article by Chen K-H and the schematic diagram
  of mTOR signaling is from a review paper by Sukhbaatar et al. [, ]
