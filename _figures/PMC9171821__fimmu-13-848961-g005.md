caption: Changes in Amino Acid Levels, Carbohydrate Levels, and Their Metabolic Pathways
  After Vaccination. (A) Circulating levels of TCA metabolites in plasma. Plasma levels
  of metabolites involved in the TCA cycle were significantly changed when comparing
  vaccination samples with baseline samples. (B) Significant changes were seen in
  the levels of some intermediates of the arginine and proline metabolism pathway
  in plasma of vaccine-immunized samples. (C) Significant changes were observed in
  the levels of some intermediates of the phenylalanine metabolism pathway in plasma
  of vaccine-immunized samples. (D) Significant changes were observed in the levels
  of metabolites involved in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism pathway after
  vaccination. Changed metabolites after vaccination were labeled as red. Statistical
  significance was determined by two-sided paired Welch’s t test. *p < 0.05; **p <
  0.01; ***p < 0.001.
