caption: Phosphorylation of p38-MAPK drives SASP-related cytokine production in premature
  senescent T lymphocytes. Senescent T lymphocytes exhibit phosphorylation of p38-mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (p38-MAPK) by a sestrin-mediated intrasensory signaling pathway that
  is maintained over time. Phosphorylation of p38-MAPK (p-p38-MAPK) inhibits autophagy
  by sequestering the p38-MAPK interacting protein (p38IP), necessary to translocate
  autophagy-related protein (ATG)-9 to the autophagosome. Inhibition of autophagy
  results in defective clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria, which accumulate and
  cause the rise of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels that act as
  inducers of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related cytokine
  production (Created with BioRender.com).
