caption: A model of the C-signal transduction pathway. C-signaling increases csgA
  transcription directly or indirectly by means of the proteins of the act operon.
  A-signal is required for developmental accumulation of the FruA response regulator.
  Downstream of the act pathway, C-signaling induces phosphorylation of FruA (red
  lines). Rippling, aggregation, sporulation, and C-signal-dependent gene expression
  are induced by increasing levels of FruA-P. Different levels are represented by
  the degree of shading of the open vertical bar. Expression of reporter genes is
  induced by the corresponding levels of FruA-P. The proposed site of action of Mx4885
  is indicated by red lines, which are downstream of the act feedback loop and downstream
  of FruA accumulation but upstream of FruA-P.
