caption: The SIAE (sialic acid acetylesterase)-Siglec pathway for inhibitory signaling.
  [1] The B cell receptor (BCR) and other membrane glycoproteins can have terminal
  sialic acid decorated N-glycans that are acetylated on the 9-OH position of α2,6
  linked sialic acid by SIAT (sialic acid acetyl transferase). [2] These acetyl moieties
  can be removed (deacetylation) by SIAE either in a vesicle or at the cell surface.
  [3] Deacetylation of N-glycan sialic acids allows interaction with Siglecs such
  as CD22 as well as others. This interaction can result in the recruitment of phosphatases
  such as SHP-1 to Siglec ITIMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs)
  [4] and consequently inhibition of BCR signaling [5].
