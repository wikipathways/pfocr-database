caption: Ferroptotic osteocytes promote osteoclastogenesis. Iron overload causes excessive
  generation of ROS in osteocytes. Excessive ROS can cause oxidative damage to membrane
  lipids and ultimately lead to cell death. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism mediated
  by ACSL4 and LPCAT3 can also cause ferroptosis. Ferroptosis can be regulated by
  several signaling pathway, such as system Xc-/GSH/GPX4 axis. Ferroptotic osteocytes
  secrete pro-osteoclastogenic factors to trigger osteoclastogenesis. Additionally,
  ferroptotic osteocytes might release cellular contents (i.e. DAMPs) and thereby
  trigger the osteoclastogenesis. SLC3A2, solute carrier family 3 members 2; ROS,
