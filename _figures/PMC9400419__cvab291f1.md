caption: The regulation of core components in the Hippo pathway. The Hippo pathway
  is regulated by diverse cellular signals, such as cell junctions and polarity, G
  protein-coupled receptor signalling, mechanical cues, and ECM homeostasis. Protein
  kinase MST1/2 is activated by upstream signalling or binding to RASSF1A, and then
  phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2 together with its adaptor protein SAV1. Interacting
  with MOB1, active LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP/TAZ and promotes their degradation
  or interacting with 14-3-3. Unphosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocates into nucleus and
  interacts with transcription factors, such as TEAD to regulate gene expression that
  promotes cell proliferation and survival.
