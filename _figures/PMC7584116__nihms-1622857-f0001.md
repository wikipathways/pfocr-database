caption: '(A) In naïve T cells, OXPHOS and FAO sustain basal cellular metabolism.
  (B) T cell stimulation through the TCR and CD28 results in SOCE and Ca2+ signals,
  which result in activation of AMPK and initial inhibition of mTORC1 and enhanced
  OXPHOS. SOCE results in increased mitochondrial respiration and OXPHOS through upregulation
  of mitochondrial gene expression, especially components of the ETC, resulting in
  enhanced ATP production, which suppresses AMPK and increases mTORC1 function. In
  parallel, SOCE mediates the activation of calcineurin and NFAT as well as the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1
  pathway, which promote the expression of the transcription factors c-Myc, IRF4 and
  HIF1a, glycolytic enzymes and the glucose transporters GLUT1 and 3. Aerobic glycolysis
  allows stimulated T cells to engage the biosynthetic pathways required for cell
  growth and proliferation. (C) The transition of effector T cells to long-term memory
  T cells is accompanied by a metabolic switch to OXPHOS and FAO as the main energy
  source to maintain memory T cells. Ca2+ influx through the purinergic receptor P2RX7
  (and potentially other Ca2+ channels) activates AMPK and suppresses mTORC1, thereby
  promoting mitochondrial function. Abbreviations: AMPK, adenosine monophosphate–activated
  protein kinase; APC, antigen presenting cell; CaMKK, calmodulin kinase kinase; FA,
  fatty acid; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; GLUT, glucose transporter; LKB-1, liver kinase
  B1; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; mTORC, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; SOCE,
  store-operated Ca2+ entry; TCR, T cell receptor.'
