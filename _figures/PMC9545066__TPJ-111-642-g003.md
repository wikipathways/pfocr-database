caption: Schematic model of the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport by
  the chloroplast thioredoxin system.The photosynthetic electron transport chain drives
  electrons from PSII through the cytochrome b 6f (Cyt b 6f) complex to PSI. PSI uses
  these electrons to reduce ferredoxin (Fd). This Fd can then be used (i) to reduce
  NADP to NADPH, a reaction that is catalysed by ferredoxin:NADP reductase (FNR),
  (ii) to reduce oxidised thioredoxin (TRX) to its reduced form in a reaction catalysed
  by ferredoxin:NADP reductase (FTR) or (iii) to transfer electrons back to either
  the Cyt b 6f complex or NDH/PCI. TRX can also be reduced by an NADPH‐dependent thioredoxin
  reductase (NTRC) pathway, which is also capable of directly reducing thiol disulphides
  on some proteins. The FTR and NTRC pathways have been reported to oppositely regulate
  the NDH/PC‐1 complex depending on conditions. Both the FTR and NTRC pathways can
  also activate certain carbon assimilation enzymes but under rather different light
  conditions. The NTRC pathway is responsible for the regulation of (i) ATPase, (ii)
  chlorophyll synthesis, (iii) the expression of chloroplast genes (such as PsbA,
  which encodes the D1 protein) through the plastid‐encoded polymerase (PEP) complex
  and chloroplast translation and (iv) D1 excision and repair pathways. NTRC is also
  required for the regeneration of the 2‐Cys peroxiredoxins and the transfer of electrons
  to the thylakoid lumen via the membrane‐anchored CcdA/HCF164 system, in order to
  regulate enzymes such as the state transition 7 (STN7) kinase.
