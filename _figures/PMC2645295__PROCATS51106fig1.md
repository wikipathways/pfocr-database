caption: Mechanisms underlying interferon (IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α
  synergistic/antagonistic actions in airway resident cells. Based on studies performed
  in other cell types as well as in airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, it is possible
  to hypothesize that the dual inflammatory actions induced by IFN-γ/TNF-α combination
  may involve different molecular mechanisms including (1) changes in the expression
  and/or function of TNF-α or IFN receptor; (2) functional or physical interactions
  between IFN and TNF-α–dependent transcriptional factors, including IRF-1, NF-κB,
  and STAT1/2; or (3) direct activation of JAK/STATs pathway by TNF-α or via the autocrine
  secretion of IFN-β. All these mechanisms could play an essential role in determining
  the final biological activities of IFNs in asthma.
