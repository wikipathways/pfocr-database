caption: 'Overview of metabolism and transport in S. solfataricus. Pathways for energy
  production and carbohydrate catabolism are shown, and extracellular enzymes that
  hydrolyze polymers (proteases, glycosyl hydrolases) are not shown. Arrows denote
  the following reactions: chemical conversion (black), energy consuming (red), energy
  yielding (green), redox (blue), respiratory electron transfer (solid black), proton
  export (black, open), and import (green, open). Conversions that were anticipated
  but for which no gene was detected are shown as broken arrows. Eleven operons encoding
  ABC transport systems are present, and those with established substrate specificity
  are depicted (xyl, xylose; fruc, fructose; glu, glucose; gal, galactose; man, mannose.
  DP, degree of polymerization) (). At least 15 secondary transporters (permeases)
  are present (symport and antiport). Carbohydrates that are imported and/or support
  growth of S. solfataricus are in blue. All but one of the genes encoding enzymes
  of the nonphosphorylated Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway was identified (KDG, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde-3P; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone-P; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate). Only
  two genes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were identified (see text).
  All citric acid cycle enzymes are encoded. Several components of the aerobic respiratory
  network are identified that are involved in (i) reduction of the caldariella-quinone
  (Qcal) pool: a putative ferredoxin dehydrogenase (see text), succinate dehydrogenase,
  and (ii) oxidation of the Qcal pool: SoxABCD and SoxM terminal oxidases; an ATP
  synthase converts the proton gradient into ATP; alternative electron donors (in
  blue) are hydrogen (H2) and sulfide (S2−), reducing the Qcal pool via hydrogenase
  and sulfide reductase, respectively. Elemental sulfur and thiosulphate are completely
  converted to sulfate (APS, adenylylsulfate); some flagellar components are present
  (see text). Both Sec/signal recognition particle-type and Tat-type protein translocation
  systems are present.'
