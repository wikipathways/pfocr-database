caption: Summary of enzyme-catalyzed thyronamine deiodinase reactions. Unlike T4,
  T4AM is not a substrate for Dio1 and -2 and cannot be deiodinated to T3AM. However,
  T4AM is readily deiodinated to rT3AM by Dio3, and rT3AM can be further deiodinated
  to ultimately provide T1AM. This suggests a unique biosynthetic deiodination pathway
  for T1AM starting from the decarboxylation products of either T4 or rT3.
