caption: Signaling and transcriptional pathways of Th1 differentiation and the potential
  role of c-Rel. Induction of T-bet and IFN-γ by T cell receptor engagement is followed
  by activation of the STAT4 and STAT1 pathways, which lead to still greater expression
  of IFN-γ. Points at which c-Rel could participate in this pathway are indicated.
