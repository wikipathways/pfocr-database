caption: 'Schematic representation of ligand-activated AHR signaling. In the unliganded
  form, AHR resides in the cytoplasm as a complex with several chaperone proteins
  including heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Ligand binding induces a conformational
  change in the AHR, revealing a nuclear localization signal that targets the AHR
  for nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, the AHR dimerizes with ARNT and interacts
  with the xenobiotic response element (XRE) in regulatory regions of specific target
  genes including AHRR and CYP1A1. In turn, AHRR acts as a repressor by competing
  for the dimerization with ARNT or directly at the XRE. AHR: aryl hydrocarbon receptor;
  AHRR: AHR repressor; ARNT, AHR nuclear translocator'
