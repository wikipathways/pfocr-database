caption: 'Hypothetical contribution of EMT to the pathophysiology of pSS. Upon stimuli
  such as inflammation (IL-6, IL-17 and IL-22), several signaling pathways become
  activated in normal SGEC present in salivary glands. These EMT signaling pathways
  culminate with the production of several EMT-related TFs such as SNAI1, ZEB1 and
  ETS1 leading to the acquisition of mesenchymal features. This results in salivary
  gland fibrosis with the appearance of spindle-shaped morphology of SGEC together
  with the expression of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin, podoplanin, MMP9 and
  several collagen types. Abbreviations: ADAMTS: A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase
  with Thrombospondin Motifs; COL3A1: collagen type III Alpha 1 chain; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition; ERK: extracellular signal–regulated kinase; IL: interleukin; iSGEC:
  immortalized SGEC; MMPs: matrix metalloproteases; SGEC: salivary gland epithelial
  cells; SMAD: homolog of the Drosophila protein, mothers against decapentaplegic
  (Mad) and the Caenorhabditis elegans protein Sma; SNAI1: Snail family transcriptional
  repressor; SS: Sjögren’s syndrome; TFs: transcription factors; TGF-β: transforming
  growth factor-β; ZEB2: zinc finger e-box binding homeobox 2. Created with Biorender.com
