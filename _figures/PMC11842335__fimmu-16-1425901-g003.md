caption: Mechanism of activating the Nrf2/KEAP1 signaling pathway to counteract oxidative
  stress and subsequent inflammatory reactions, including mastitis, induced by LPS
  through the administration of bioactive compounds from an external source. Upon
  administration, the bioactive compound triggers the activation of Nrf2. This activated
  Nrf2 then translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a heterodimer with small Maf
  proteins (sMaf) by binding to SMAF. This Nrf2/sMaf heterodimer specifically binds
  to a cis-acting enhancer known as the antioxidant response element (ARE), initiating
  the transcription of a range of antioxidant genes. These ARE-regulated genes play
  a crucial role in blocking oxidative stress and inhibiting the NF-kB signaling pathway
  activated by LPS. Additionally, they enhance antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses,
  thereby preventing inflammatory changes in mammary epithelial cells
