caption: 'The UPR signaling cascade. UPR pathways are activated through competitive
  binding of the chaperone immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein (BiP) also known
  as glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) to the receptors. Accumulation of misfolded
  or unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to the dissociation
  of BiP from 3 transducers: PERK (double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like
  ER kinase), ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6), and IRE1 (inositol-requiring
  enzyme). Upon activation, PERK phosphorylates and deactivates the eukaryotic initiation
  factor (eIF2α), which results in an increased level of ATF4. This triggers the activation
  of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Subsequently, DNA damage-inducible protein transcript
  (GADD) expression is also elevated, what negatively regulates eIF2α phosphorylation
  and restores translation. While initially contributing to cellular survival in conditions
  of ER stress, PERK is considered proapoptotic due to strong induction of CHOP in
  chronic or terminal ER stress. PERK also regulates several transcription factors
  including NRF-2 that upregulate the antioxidant response and ATF4 which can lead
  to both protective and apoptotic signaling. Upon activation, ATF6 is released from
  BiP that is trafficked to the Golgi apparatus (it consists of two Golgi localization
  signals, GLS) and cleaved by the proteases into two subunits. Then it translocates
  to the nucleus where it is the promoter region of UPR target genes termed the endoplasmic
  reticulum stress element (ERSE), activating genes responsible for the components
  of the UPR response and leads to the induction of molecular chaperones (e.g., GRP78,
  Grp94, and calreticulin, as well as CHOP and XBP1). The various ER chaperones are
  part of a protective adaptive response that regulates protein folding and other
  components of the UPR. ATF6 is primarily considered prosurvival due to its role
  in promoting the transcription of chaperones and XBP1. IRE-1 activation is responsible
  for in the unconventional splicing of XBP-1 mRNA. Spliced XBP-1 encodes a transcription
  factor that activates the expression of UPR genes, such as chaperones and ER-associated
  degradation proteins (ERAD). These include the activation of the cell death machinery,
  degradation of ER-localized mRNAs that encode secreted and membrane proteins through
  the RIDD (regulated Ire1-dependent decay) pathway, and induction of autophagosomes.
  This signaling cascade increases the folding capacity of the ER and causes degradation
  of misfolded proteins. IRE1 is mainly considered as a prosurvival pathway, but it
  also can contribute to apoptosis through the activation of JNK-dependent pathway.'
