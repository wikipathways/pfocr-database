caption: (A) After dimerization of a NOTCH receptor with a DLL/JAG ligand (a), proteolytic
  cleavage of NOTCH by ADAM family proteases and the γ-secretase complex occurs (b),
  releasing NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) that translocates to the nucleus, interacts
  with the MAML/CSL complex to induce the transcription of target genes (c; HES, HEY
  family). Non-canonical effects of NOTCH have also been described (d). (B) Inflammatory
  stimuli suppress NOTCH expression and activity in endothelial cells (a); this results
  in the expression of inflammatory and atherogenic mediators (b) favoring the recruitment
  of immune cells (c). Notch signaling can involve bi-directional heterotypic communication
  between endothelial cells and immune or smooth muscle cells (d). (C) Changes in
  protease activity secondary to oxidized lipids exposure that can (a) bind to and
  increase activity of ADAM proteases and (b) change the lipid microenvironment altering
  γ-secretase activity. Oxidized phospholipids repress NOTCH expression and activity,
  a mechanism that promotes endothelial activation (c). NOTCH signaling is regulated
  by post-translational changes that may reflect biosynthetic activity of the cell
  (d). Nutrients impact NOTCH expression and activity (e). ADAM, a-disintegrin and
  metalloprotease; CSL, CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, Lag-1; Dll, Delta-like ligand;
  MAML, mastermind-like; NICD, Notch intracellular domain.
