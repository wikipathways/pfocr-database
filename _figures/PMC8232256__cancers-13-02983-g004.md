caption: Therapeutic interventions targeting the CCR2 signaling pathway. (A) Inhibition
  of CCR2 signaling alone and in combination with other immunotherapies reduces the
  recruitment of immune cells to the tumor. (B) Polarization of immune cells is dependent
  on CCR2 signaling. When CCR2 is blocked, TAMs exhibit an antitumoral (M1) phenotype,
  and tumors are infiltrated by more functional T helper (Th) cells in vivo. (C) Proliferation
  and tumor growth decrease after administration of anti-CCR2 treatment with bevacizumab
  or other immunotherapies. Dexamethasone also decreases proliferation and tumor growth
  mediated by CCL2 in vivo. (D) Angiogenesis is hindered by combined treatment with
  a CCR2 inhibitor and bevacizumab in vivo. Additionally, blocking CCR2 leads to reduced
  TAM infiltration within the tumor. Ab = antibody; bev = bevacizumab; PRF-P = platelet-rich
  fibrin patch. Created with BioRender.com.
