caption: (A) The deficiency of Raptor downregulated the amount of CD122 on the NK
  cell surface. Raptor-mTORC1 signaling pathway play its role in NK cell differentiation
  via downstream effectors including E4BP4, T-bet, and IL-15, which is essentially
  needed during NK cell differentiation process. (B) mTORC1 is essential for early
  and late-stage development of NK cells via regulating E4BP4 and T-bet, while mTORC2
  is only necessary for very early NK cell development through regulating T-bet.
