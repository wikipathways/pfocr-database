caption: Ischemia/reperfusion induced cardiac injury characterized by impaired cardiac
  hemodynamics, increased infarct size and enhanced release of cardiac enzymes, LDH
  and CK, involved ACE and chymase mediated production of Ang II and reduced activation
  of ERK1/2 and AKT components of the RISK pathway. PPC on the other hand improved
  cardiac hemodynamic and attenuated infarct size and release of cardiac enzymes.
  PPC protection involved downstream signaling via the RISK pathway. Exogenous administration
  of Ang II or blockage of endogenous Ang II had a neutral effect on PPC mediated
  cardiac protection yet induced the RISK pathway. AT1 antagonist, irbesartan on the
  other hand abrogated the protective effects of PPC and attenuated the RISK pathway.
