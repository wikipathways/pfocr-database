caption: Levodopa pathway and nutritional interventions in patients with PD. Nutritional
  interventions (in orange) may interact at multiple sites within the levodopa metabolism
  pathway to increase the efficacy or temper the side effects of levodopa therapy.
  Levodopa is absorbed from the intestine to the systemic circulation and nutritional
  interventions that improve this absorption across the intestinal wall include PRDs,
  dietary fiber, caffeine, and vitamin C. Similarly, transportation across the BBB
  from the bloodstream to the brain is facilitated by PRDs. In the periphery, levodopa
  is partly metabolized by COMT-mediated methylation. Soybeans may potentially act
  as COMT inhibitors by preventing this metabolism. Furthermore, this methylation
  reaction requires CH3 donation by SAM, which is subsequently converted into SAH.
  Eventually, this leads to elevated homocysteine concentrations, a risk factor for
  peripheral neuropathy, osteoporosis, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular diseases.
  Alleviation of homocysteine concentrations occurs either through trans-sulfuration
  to cysteine or through remethylation to methionine. This first reaction requires
  vitamin B-6. The second reaction requires vitamin B-12 and donation of CH3 by the
  folate cycle, which, in turn, requires folic acid (vitamin B-9). B vitamin supplements,
  including vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and folic acid, can effectively attenuate hyperhomocysteinemia
  and have the potency to treat or prevent related complications. AAAD, aromatic l-amino
