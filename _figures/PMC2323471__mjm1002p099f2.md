caption: β-AR-mediated cardiomyocyte contractility. Agonist binding stimulates β1-AR
  and results in coupling with and activation of heterotrimeric Gs, which dissociates
  into GaS and Giβγ subunits. The GaS activates both adenylyl cyclase (AC), which
  increases intracellular cAMP levels and L-type calcium channel, which allows Ca2+
  to enter into cardiomyocytes. The cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates (P) several
  substrates including phospholamban (PLB), L-type Ca2+ channels, troponin I and the
  cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR) resulting in increased cardiac contractility and
  relaxation. In addition to Gs, β2-AR couples to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi upon
  agonist binding. Activated-Gi releases Gai subunit, which inhibits AC and Giβγ and
  activates phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) leading to reduced cardiac contractility. The
  β1-AR-induced cAMP suppresses the β2-AR/cPLA2 pathway, via PKA. Asterisks denote
  activated proteins and indicates inhibition.
