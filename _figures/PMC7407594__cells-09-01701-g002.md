caption: RNA sensing mechanisms. RNA sensing mechanisms are composed of endosomal
  and cytoplasmic sensors. (a) Endosomal RNA sensors, TLR3 and TLR7/8, recognize dsRNA
  and ssRNA, respectively. TLR3 activates the TRIF-dependent pathway to activate IRF3/7,
  NF-κB, and AP-1. In contrast, TLR7/8 triggers the MyD88-dependent pathway and leads
  to the activation of NF-κB and AP-1, and simultaneously activates IRF5/7 to induce
  type I IFN genes. In addition to recognizing ssRNA, TLR7 and TLR8 can be activated
  by guanosine and uridine residues, respectively. Uridine molecules for TLR8 are
  degraded products generated by RNaseT2 and RNase2, although it remains unknown how
  guanosine residues are generated. The engagement of both ligands achieves maximum
  activation of TLR7/8. (b) RIG-I and MDA5 are central RNA sensors that localize to
  the cytosol, and both harbor the N-terminal tandem caspase-recruitment domains (CARDs)
  and helicase domains. After binding to dsRNA, these RNA sensors undergo oligomerization
  along dsRNA structures, which then activates MAVS through CARD–CARD interaction.
  These sequential events then activate IRF3/7 along with NF-κB to induce IFN-I responses.
  (c) Alternative RNA sensing is mediated by RNA receptors whose expressions are induced
  by RLR activation. OAS1 generates 2′-5′-oligoadenylate that activates RNase L, which
  promotes the degradation of dsRNAs. The resulting fragments of dsRNAs can also activate
  the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-sensing pathway. PKR is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that
  is present in the unphosphorylated form. After binding to dsRNA, PKR undergoes autophosphorylation
  and dimerization, which inhibits viral protein synthesis and induces the IFN-I response.
  IFIT1 recognizes capped RNA with 5’-triphosphate ends, which can block the translation
  of viral RNA. U, uridine; G, guanosine; IFN-I, type I interferon; CARD, caspase
  activation recruitment domain.
