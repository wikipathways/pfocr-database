caption: Cross-section of the wall of the aorta, showing the role of various genes
  (associated with connective tissue disorders) in maintaining the integrity of the
  extracellular matrix. The wall of the aorta consists of three layers (intima, media,
  adventitia), genetic mutations associated with connective tissue disorders target
  the distorted remodeling of the aortic media, weakening the wall, thus leaving the
  patient susceptible to developing an aneurysm and/or dissection. The aortic media
  is composed of concentric layers of smooth muscle cells, within a dense Extracellular
  Matrix (ECM). The ECM consists of organized layers of elastin, fibrillin, and collagen,
  any derangement in the structure of these fibres leads to disorganization of the
  ECM and consequent weakening of the aorta. COL3A1 (1) encodes the alpha-1 procollagen
  chains, which are responsible for the formation of type III collagen, it is the
  gene defect found in Ehlers-Danlos type IV. The mutation responsible for this disease
  leads to an increase in the friability of the collagen molecules []. Fibrillin (2)
  is a structural protein which plays a major role in the sequestration and consequent
  regulation of the TGF-β (3) signaling pathway, the mutated form of fibrillin is
  found in Marfan Syndrome due to a mutation in the FBN1 gene []. The TGF-β signaling
  pathway plays a major role in connective tissue growth and maintenance of the ECM.
  TGF-β is released into the ECM as an inactive dimer bound to latent TGF-β binding
  protein (LTBP). In the ECM, the TGF-β/LTBP complex is sequestered by fibrillin;
  further interactions with other ECM components, e.g., integrins lead to the activation
  of the TGF-β. Once activated TGF-β binds to the heteromeric TGF-receptor complex
  (4), which then leads to the phosphorylation of SMAD proteins, a group of intracellular
  signal transducers []. The phosphorylated SMAD (5) are transported to the nucleus
  where they act as a transcription factor involved in the expression of proteins
  such as collagen, Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) [], and matrix metalloproteinase
  (MMP) [, ]. (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure is available in
