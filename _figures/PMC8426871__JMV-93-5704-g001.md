caption: 'Cartoon showing the possible mechanism of exacerbation of GSH depletion
  in subjects infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 by paracetamol. As explained in the text, SARS‐CoV‐2
  negatively affects the serine pathway leading to cystathionine synthesis and the
  uptake of folate, dysregulating the one‐carbon metabolism. Folate can be reduced
  to tetrahydrofolate (THF) and then converted to 5‐methyl THF, whereas a reaction
  catalyzed by methionine synthetase, transfers the methyl group of 5‐methyl‐THF to
  homocysteine, generating methionine. SARS‐COV‐2 impairs also other thiolic‐exchanging
  pathways, such as Cys. On the other hand, paracetamol can inhibit the serine pathway
  and the sulfur amino acid pathway (see Mast C, Dardevet D, Papet I. Impact of medication
  on protein and amino acid metabolism in the elderly: the sulfur amino acid and paracetamol
  case. Nutr Res Rev. 2018 Dec;31(2):179‐192.) and also GSH reductase (see Rousar
  T, Pařík P, Kucera O, Bartos M, Červinková Z. Glutathione reductase is inhibited
  by acetaminophen‐glutathione conjugate in vitro. Physiol Res. 2010;59(2):225‐232.).
  Arrows with red circle and minus sign = inhibition. BHMT, betaine homocysteine methyltransferase;
