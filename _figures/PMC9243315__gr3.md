caption: Regulation of miR-4295 on biological behavior of cancer cells through a variety
  of pathway. miR-4295 exerts multiple effects on cancer cells through different target
  genes. miR-4295 promotes cell migration by inhibiting the expression of BTG1 and
  NPTX1. miR-4295 promotes cell invasion and EMT by inhibiting the expression of GPC5,
  NPTX1, TP63, and PTPN14, respectively. Furthermore, miR-4295 promotes cell cycle
  by inhibiting the expression of RUNX3 and BTG1, and promotes cell proliferation
  by inhibiting the expression of 5 genes (NPTX1, BTG1, RUNX3, GPC5, and PTPN14) and
  promoting the expression of CNKN1A. Moreover, miR-4295 can also inhibit apoptosis
  by inhibiting the expression of RUNX3 and LRIG1.
