caption: Schematic model of activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  signaling pathway by laminin‐γ2 (Lm‐γ2) chains. A, Canonical pathway of EGFR activation
  by Lm‐γ2 chain. Cleavage of Lm‐γ2 chain by MMPs releases the N‐terminal domains
  that contain a laminin‐EGF‐like motif, which promotes tumor progression by activation
  of the EGFR pathway. Noncleaved Lm‐γ2 chain assembles into other laminin subunits,
  and forms Lm‐332. Cleavage of γ2 chain in Lm‐332 by MMPs is more resistant than
  in monomeric Lm‐γ2m (Lm‐γ2m). B, Noncanonical pathway of activation of the EGFR
  pathway by C‐terminally truncated Lm‐γ2 (Lm‐γ2F). Lm‐γ2F generated by chromosomal
  translocation between LAMC2 and NR6A1 genes results in the fusion transcript that
  contains the Lm‐EGF‐like motif and lacks domain I/II (DI/II) required for its assembly
  with other Lm subunits (α and β). Lm‐γ2F can directly bind to EGFR and activate
  the EGFR and AKT pathways, in turn increasing Lm‐γ2 expression as a result of the
  positive feedback loop
