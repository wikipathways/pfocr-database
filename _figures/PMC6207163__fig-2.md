caption: EGFR signaling pathways. Activation of EGFR by ligand binding leads to a
  myriad of downstream signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt pathway, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  pathway, JAK/STAT pathway, and NF-κB pathway) that ultimately drive tumor cell growth,
  angiogenesis, invasion, etc. Note that PI3K is required for membrane recruitment
  of Rac, a NOX subunit, and the subsequent ROS production. EGFR-targeted monoclonal
  antibodies block ligand binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR. EGFR-targeted
  TKIs inhibit the catalytic domain of EGFR. Mechanisms for resistance to EGFR-targeted
  therapies include EGFR oxidation/mutation with increased/constitutive activity,
  activation of redundant kinase signaling pathways (e.g., c-MET and HER2), and EGFR-independent
  activation of downstream pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt). Bold borders indicate redox-regulated
  proteins. Akt, protein kinase B; c-MET, tyrosine-protein kinase Met; EGF, epidermal
  growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Grb2, growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; IKK, IκB kinase; JAK,
  Janus kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; mTOR, mechanistic target
  of rapamycin; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; NOX, NADPH oxidase; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase; PRX, peroxiredoxin; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin
  homologue; Rac, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate; SHP2, tyrosine-protein
  phosphatase nonreceptor type 11; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  factor; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor. To see this illustration in color, the reader
