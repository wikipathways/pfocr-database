caption: 'Schematic view of the early phase events involving uncoated HIV-1 RTC. The
  numbering of events continues from . (4) Completion of reverse transcription results
  in double-strand cDNA comprising 99-nucleotide-long central DNA flap produced as
  a result of additional initiation of the (+) DNA synthesis at the second polypurine
  tract in the middle of the HIV genome. Newly synthesized DNA is probably covered
  by molecules of nucleocapsid (NC) protein. Progress of reverse transcription is
  likely associated with progressive capsid disassembly (uncoating). (5) RTCs undergo
  protein rearrangement which results in binding of MA and Vpr molecules along the
  length of cDNA. This RTC design protects cDNA from nuclease attack and provides
  proper exposure of the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of MA, Vpr and IN to
  importins. RTC also incorporates host cell proteins: high-mobility group DNA-binding
  protein, HMGA, and the transcriptional co-activator LEDGF/p75. The latter protein
  binds IN molecules and contributes to protection of IN from proteolysis and to nuclear
  targeting of RTC. (6) During their intracytoplasmic transport toward the (−) ends
  of MT, uncoated RTCs interact with importin (karyopherin) α/β heterodimers which
  provide translocation of the RTC through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). NLS-comprising
  proteins of RTC (MA, IN, Vpr and LEDGF/p75) can bind importin α of the α/β heterodimer.
  IN also binds importin 7, however the role of this interaction in RTC nuclear import
  is unclear. (7) Cytoplasmic transport of the RTC-importin complexes in the productive
  pathway ends with interaction with nucleoporins of the NPC and subsequent translocation
  into the nucleus. (8) Most RTCs traveling to the (−) ends of MT end up in an aggresomal
  (non-productive) pathway. In this pathway, RTCs are transported on MTs towards the
  MT organizing center (MTOC) together with aggresomes, which recruit proteasomes.
  Thus, this pathway results in disposal of RTCs.'
