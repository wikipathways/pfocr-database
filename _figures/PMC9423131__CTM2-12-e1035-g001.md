caption: 'Mechanism of organocatalysis in base excision repair initiation by 8‐oxoguanine
  DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1): (A) Upon base excision of 8‐oxoguanine (8‐oxoG) an abasic
  site (AP site) is generated, which in turn is a substrate for APE1. Even if OGG1
  exerts its weak β‐elimination function, the generated product 3′‐phospho unsaturated
  aldehyde (3′‐PUA) will remain a substrate for APE1. In that way OGG1 function always
  depends on APE1. (B) After base excision, Lys249 and the opened form of the AP site
  form a Schiff base, also referred to as an imino group (green box). The cleavage
  of this group is the rate determining step in base excision repair initiation mediated
  by OGG1. Further, the formation of this functionality temporally removes OGG1 enzyme
  copies from the catalytic cycle. It has been suggested that the excised base 8‐oxoG
  can to some extent initiate the cleavage of the Schiff base by β‐elimination. (C)
  TH12117 was developed as a small molecule activator that acts as an organocatalyst.
  The molecule can replace the excised base and interact with the same amino acid
  residues. This interaction enables the molecule to abstract a 2′‐proton more efficiently
  than 8‐oxoG, initiating a β‐elimination event. The generated reaction product releases
  the Lys249 residue and OGG1 can enter a new catalytic cycle. In the meantime, the
  product is directed towards APE1‐ependent repair. This pathway has developed during
  evolution and deals with lesions arising from 8‐oxoG excision in higher organisms.
  (D) More potent activator TH10785 has a stronger interaction with the Phe319 and
  Gly42 residues due to an extended ring system. This enables a more pronounced β‐elimination
  and in addition a novel δ‐elimination. Thus, OGG1 can repetitively enter new repair
  cycles. Although base excision repair initiation is further increased with TH10785,
  the repair of the generated product is no longer APE1 but rather PNKP1 dependent.
  This enables a rational overload of a new repair pathway with lesions derived from
  both 8‐oxoG and AP sites. Light blue – amino acid residues of OGG1; green box –
