caption: Schematic summary of a signaling pathway underlying IL-1β-induced dedifferentiation
  of primary cultured articular chondrocytes. A, schematic summary of SIRT1 function
  either as downstream of NAMPT signaling or as upstream of ERK and p38 kinase. B,
  0.25 μg of GST, 0.5 μg of GST-ERK2, or 2.0 μg of GST-pERK fusion proteins were initially
  bound with glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h, and then each complex was incubated
  with the active form of 0.5 μg of His-SIRT1 fusion proteins for 12 h. The protein
  complexes were detected by Western blotting with anti-GST (top) or anti-His antibody
  (bottom).
