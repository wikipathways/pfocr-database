caption: A mechanistic model of carotenogenesis in C. zofingiensis. Boxes in red,
  blue and black indicate up-, down- and non-regulated pathways, respectively. The
  MEP pathway produces IPP and DMAPP, which are used for the synthesis of lycopene.
  The synthesized lycopene can enter both lutein synthesis and astaxanthin synthesis.
  Astaxanthin and TAG, once synthesized, are packed into the lipid droplet for storage.
  The dashed arrows indicate connections between pathways. The synergistic regulation
  of astaxanthin, lutein and TAG by TFs is proposed. Solid arrows indicate positive
  regulation while the T shape designates negative regulation
papertitle: Time-resolved carotenoid profiling and transcriptomic analysis reveal
  mechanism of carotenogenesis for astaxanthin synthesis in the oleaginous green alga
  Chromochloris zofingiensis.
