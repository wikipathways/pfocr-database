caption: The proposed mechanisms by which Adam8 deficiency in leukocytes and/or lung
  parenchymal cells leads to exaggerated cigarette smoke (CS)-induced chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease in mice. Based on the results of studies of wild-type, Adam8−/−,
  and Adam8 bone marrow chimeric mice, deficiency of Adam8 in both leukocytes and
  epithelial cells increases CS-induced lung pathologies in mice. Deficiency of Adam8
  in leukocytes (likely macrophages) increases lung macrophage survival by reducing
  activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in macrophages to thereby increase
  the number of lung macrophages and the lung burden of their destructive products
  (proteinases including matrix metalloproteinases, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species,
  and proinflammatory mediators). The increased numbers of viable macrophages in CS-exposed
  Adam8−/− lungs secrete increased quantities of chemokines (e.g., Ccl-2, Ccl-3, and
  Cxcl-1) and survival factors for myeloid cells (e.g., G-csf [granulocyte colony–stimulating
  factor] and Gm-csf [granulocyte–macrophage colony–stimulating factor]) that increase
  lung PMN counts and further increase lung macrophage counts. Deficiency of Adam8
  in leukocytes (likely macrophages) also increases emphysema development by increasing
  alveolar septal cell death and decreasing alveolar septal cell repair. Deficiency
  of Adam8 in leukocytes (likely macrophages) increases airway mucus cell metaplasia
  as a result of loss of macrophage-derived Adam8 shedding the Egfr from airway epithelial
  cell surfaces, thereby increasing Egf receptor–ligand–mediated activation of mucin
  gene expression in airway epithelium. The increased numbers of viable macrophages
  in CS-exposed Adam8−/− lungs secrete increased quantities of Tnf-α (tumor necrosis
  factor-α) and Il-1β, which may also increase mucus metaplasia in the Adam8−/− airways.
  Deficiency of Adam8 in lung parenchymal cells (likely epithelial cells) increases
  emphysema development by increasing alveolar septal cell death and reducing alveolar
  septal cell repair, in part, by inhibiting activation of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway.
  Deficiency of Adam8 in lung parenchymal cells (likely epithelial cells) also increases
  lung macrophage counts possibly by increasing alveolar septal cell death to trigger
  an inflammatory response in the lung. Adam8 = a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
  domain-8; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ECM = extracellular matrix;
  EGFR = epidermal growth factor receptor; PMN = polymorphonuclear neutrophil.
