caption: 'KEGG signal pathway analysis after treatment with LYCRPLs: (A,B) changes
  in rat fecal metabolites induced by high-fat diet in pyrimidine metabolism (A) and
  the TCA cycle (B); (B,C) changes in high-fat-diet rat fecal metabolites in the TCA
  cycle before (B) and after (C) treatment with LYCRPLs; (D,E) changes in high-fat-diet
  rat intestine D-glucose in terms of glycolysis (D) and bile secretion (E) after
  treatment with LYCRPLs. (A–E) The small circle represents metabolites, the red indicators
  represent up-regulation, and the blue ones represent down-regulation. The large
  squares represent other metabolic pathways, the small ones represent enzymes, and
  the small green ones represent enzymes unique to this species. The solid arrow indicates
  the reaction direction, and the dashed one indicates the relationship with other
  metabolic pathways.'
