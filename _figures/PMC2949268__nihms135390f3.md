caption: 'Diagrams of relationships of selected proposed interactions between signaling
  pathways that influence proliferation and differentiation. A: simple relationship
  between GLP-1 activity and germ cell fate. B: Additional interactions downstream
  of the GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. Protein families/orthologs are indicated in
  gray. See text for further explanation.'
