caption: Under normal                                                 conditions,
  activation of FXR signaling induces the metabolic repressor SHP                                                 in
  liver.  SHP is then recruited to the miR-34a promoter and inhibits                                                 binding
  of the key activator p53 to the DNA, resulting in decreased miR-34a                                                 expression.  Inhibition
  of miR-34a results in increased hepatic SIRT1 levels.                                                  In
  contrast, under pathophysiological conditions such as fatty livers of                                                 obese
  mice, the dysregulated FXR/SHP pathway due to highly elevated FXR                                                 acetylation
  no longer inhibits transcription of miR-34a.  The dysregulated                                                 FXR/SHP
  pathway, along with acetylation of p53 due to cellular stress under                                                 metabolic
  disease states, result in elevated miR-34a expression, which                                                 contributes
  to decreased SIRT1 levels.
