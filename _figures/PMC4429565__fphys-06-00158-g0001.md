caption: Schematic representation of programmed mechanisms in offspring's adipose
  tissue of malnourished dams. Overall, offspring from malnourished dams display increased
  adipogenesis/lipogenesis and inflammation as well as decreased lipolysis within
  adipose tissue. Red arrows indicate programmed activation (+) or inhibition (−)
  of major processes controlled by hormones that may predispose offspring to fat accumulation.
  The accumulation of triglycerides (TG) may be due to increased esterification of
  either free fatty acids released from lipoproteins, catalyzed by lipoprotein lipase
  (LPL) (dashed arrow), or free fatty acids synthesized from glucose metabolism mainly
  driven by lipogenic enzymes. Leptin acting via its receptor (JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  pathway) may activate preadipocyte proliferation and/or inhibit lipolysis. Insulin
  after binding to its receptor (IRS/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway) may promote the TG
  formation via activation of glucose entry (i.e., increased GLUT4 translocation)
  (dashed arrow) and lipogenic enzymes. Insulin also shows anti-lipolytic effects
  and may activate adipogenesis. Increased adipogenesis and decreased lipolysis may
  be due to impaired activity of the sympathetic system (via noradrenaline). Glucocorticoids
  (GC) that bind intracellular receptor may activate adipogenesis and lipogenesis
  whereas they inhibit lipolysis. Thus, both increased circulating GC levels and intracellular
  GC sensivity (i.e., modified GR, MR, 11 β-HSD1, 11 β-HSD2 relative abundance and
  activities) can directly impact on adipose tissue function. The pro-inflammatory
  state might be due to either immune cell infiltration (dashed arrow) and/or local
  expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. The pro-inflammatory state may also originate,
  at least in part, from increased GC sensitivity within WAT.
