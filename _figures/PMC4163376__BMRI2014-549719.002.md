caption: A simplified overview of the Rb/E2F pathway. In general, Rb binds to and
  inhibits E2F, resulting in the altered transcription of numerous S-phase relevant
  genes. During the G1/S part of the cell cycle, increased CDK activity leads to RB
  phosphorylation, which causes release and activation of E2F, and an induction of
  S-phase dependent gene expression. In turn, various inhibitors (CKI) modulate CDK
  activity. In addition to their well-established role in transcriptional regulation
  through E2F, both CKIs and Rb bind to and inactivate Mcm2-7; how this inhibition
  is reverded to facilitate subsequent DNA replication is currently unknown.
