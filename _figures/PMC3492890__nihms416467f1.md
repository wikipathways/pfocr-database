caption: 'Energy metabolism shifts from glycolysis to OXPHOS with differentiation,
  or from OXPHOS to glycolysis with reprogramming to pluripotency. Glycolytic flux
  is elevated in PSCs (left panel) to provide ATP and intermediate metabolites through
  the pentose phosphate pathway for nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis. Glycolysis
  regulating enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase and hexokinase, are highly expressed
  in PSCs, which also consume oxygen through a functional electron transport chain.
  PSCs rely more on glycolysis for energy because respiration is lower and less coupled
  to energy production than in differentiated cells. Pyruvate entry into mitochondria
  is limited by an inactive pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or by high expression of
  uncoupling protein 2. The mitochondrial membrane potential is partially maintained
  by hydrolysis of ATP in the complex V ATP synthase. Less reactive oxygen species
  is present in PSCs from lower respiration and elevated antioxidant enzymes. These
  features establish a reduced cellular redox environment (blue text) that becomes
  more oxidative (orange text) with differentiation. The tricarboxylic acid cycle
  in PSCs provides intermediate metabolites such as citrate and α-ketoglutarate that
  are siphoned for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis. Key: ETC, electron transport
  chain; FA, fatty acid; G-6-P: glucose-6-phosphate; GSH; glutathione; GSSG, glutathione
  disulfide; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; NAD: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADP:
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; R-5-P,
  ribose-5-phosphate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
  Elevated metabolic pathways are indicated with bold letters and arrows.'
