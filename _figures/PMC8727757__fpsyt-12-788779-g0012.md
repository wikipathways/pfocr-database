caption: Probable glance at inflammatory scenario development in autistic pathology.
  Lead intoxication, the effect of which is intensified by a mutation of the VDR-Taq
  and MAO-A leads to quinolinic acid increase, resulting in energy metabolism depletion
  and mitochondrial dysfunction, which is expressed in ROS overproduction. The latter
  are also known to be signal-trigger molecules which activate the T-cell dependent
  immune response. Activated T-helpers produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α),
  which leads to the activation of effector cells - macrophages and the development
  of a chronic inflammatory response and induce persistent inflammatory signals. KP,
  kynurenine pathway; Q, coenzyme Q10.
