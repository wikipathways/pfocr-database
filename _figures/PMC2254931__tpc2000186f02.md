caption: The Three Major Biosynthetic Pathways Active in Lupulin Glands.Enzyme names
  are shown in blue. Each enzyme is annotated with the number of corresponding ESTs
  shown in parentheses. Dashed arrows indicate the role of DMAPP for prenylation in
  the bitter acid and xanthohumol pathways.(A) The terpenoid pathway in hop lupulin
  glands. This pathway includes the MEP pathway for synthesis of IPP and DMAPP and
  also provides myrcene and humulene, the main terpenoids in hop lupulin glands. The
  mevalonate pathway is not shown because it appears to contribute little to the formation
  of lupulin gland terpenoids.(B) The bitter acid pathway in hop lupulin glands. The
  biosynthesis of humulone, the main α-acid found in hop trichomes, is shown. The
  nature of the aromatic prenylation and final oxidation steps are not known.(C) The
  xanthohumol pathway in hop lupulin glands. The aromatic prenyltransferase is not
  identified.
