caption: Inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis by DFMO leads to increase S-adenosylmethionine
  decarboxylase (SAM-DC) activity ultimately diminishing tetrahydrofolate (THF) pools
  available for thymidine synthesis. When ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is inhibited
  by DFMO, there is not only a decrease in polyamine pools, but also a rapid increase
  in SAM-DC that draws on THF pools to regenerate methionine and SAM. Witherspoon
  et al. propose that if the shunting of THF for increased SAM synthesis continues,
  the decrease in THF pools results in decreased synthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphare
  (dTMP), which becomes limiting, and induces cytostasis. It is by this mechanism
  that they posit that DFMO is an effective chemoprevention agent. The green arrows
  indicate increasing activity of the indicated enzyme or flux through the indicated
  pathway. Red arrows indicate decreased concentrations of the indicated polyamine
  or decreased availability of the THF metabolite substrate necessary for dTMP synthesis.
  Note that green arrows indicate an increase in spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase
  (SSAT) activity in response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), which
  have been commonly used in combination with DFMO in CRC chemoprevention trials.
  This increase in polyamine catabolism could increase the flux through the pathway
  regenerating SAM when ODC is inhibited and thus synergize with DFMO in reducing
  the availability of THF for dTMP synthesis.
