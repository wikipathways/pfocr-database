caption: 'Schematic illustration of the platelet P2-mediated ADP signaling pathway
  and its role in platelet activation. ADP can induce platelet activation by interacting
  with two G-coupled platelet receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12, and contributes to the stabilization
  of platelet aggregation induced by other strong agonists such as thrombin and TXA2.
  ADP binding to P2Y1 induces a mobilization of calcium ions through the stimulation
  of phospholipase C and therefore initiates early reversible aggregation. ADP binding
  to P2Y12 induces PI3K activation through the recruitment of βγ subunits of Gi and
  inhibition of adenylate cyclase through the recruitment of αi subunit, therefore
  decreasing cAMP levels and leading to impaired PKA activation. These pathways ultimately
  lead to platelet activation, αIIbβ3 activation and stabilization of platelet aggregates.
  AC: adenylate cyclase; ADP: adenosine diphosphate; ATP: adenosine triphosphate;
  PI3K: phosphoinositide-3-kinase; PKA: protein kinase A; PLC: phospholipase C; VASP:
  vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein.'
