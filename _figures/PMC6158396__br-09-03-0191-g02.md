caption: Signaling pathway of HMGB1 in the early and late phases of cerebrovascular
  disease. Following acute cerebrovascular disease, under the stimulation of inflammation,
  astrocytes, endothelial cells and neurons can actively secrete HMGB1, while passive
  release occurs instantaneously upon the destruction of cellular integrity. Extracellular
  HMGB1 interacts with neurons, endothelial cells and glial cells to participate in
  BBB disruption, vasospasm and apoptosis through mediating downstream inflammatory
  factors, which contribute toward cerebral edema and nerve injury. On the other hand,
  during the late phase, HMGB1 can promote brain repair and remodeling, participating
  in angiogenesis and neurogenesis, contributing toward the recovery of neurological
  function. HMGB1, high mobility group box B1; BBB, blood brain barrier; TLR, Toll-like
  receptor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase; IL, interleukin; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase;
  ICAM-1, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1.
