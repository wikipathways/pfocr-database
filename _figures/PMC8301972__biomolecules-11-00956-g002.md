caption: The regulation of EpCAM during EMT occurs through a double-negative feedback
  loop. In epithelial cells (left panel), EpCAM forms homophilic adhesions and promotes
  epithelial homeostasis. EpCAM can also inhibit ERK signaling (a potent mediator
  of EMT) and its gene targets, including SNAI2, EGR1, FOS, JUN, ATF3, and others.
  In mesenchymal cells (right panel), ERK pathway signaling silences EpCAM expression.
  ERK2 binds the EpCAM promoter at an ERK2-binding consensus sequence and directly
  inhibits EpCAM gene expression. ERK2 also induces EMT transcription factors, including
  SNAI2, that in turn also inhibit EpCAM transcription.
