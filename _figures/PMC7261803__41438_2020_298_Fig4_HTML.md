caption: 'a KEGG enrichment analysis of sex-associated DEGs underlines the phytohormone
  signal transduction in male flowers when compared to female ones. Auxin-related
  TIR1/AFBs signaling transduction: auxin was transported by membrane-bound carrier
  AUX (CpAUX1 encoding) and bound to receptor TIR/AFBs (CpTIR1 encoding). ① Complex
  containing TIR/AFBs triggered subsequently ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of AUX/IAA
  by recruiting proteasome; ② Aux/IAA degradation alleviates the transcript repression
  of ARF5 gene CpARF5. In the last step, ARF5 bound the DNA elements and promoted
  the transcription of IAA gene (CpIAA4 and CpIAA6). Ub in yellow circles indicate
  the degradation of target proteins via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. b Volcano
  diagram showing the DEGs in spring male flowers when compared with the spring female
  counterparts. Each dot represents individual DEG, the red and blue dots indicate
  upregulated and downregulated sex-associated DEGs in male flowers, respectively;
  gray dots represent DEGs excluding sex-associated DEGs. Plotted −log10 (P value
  of DEGs) on the vertical y-axis against log2 (fold-changes of DEGs) on the horizontal
  x-axis. Eleven sex-associated DEGs involved in phytohormone signal transduction
  were marked as green labels, and nine sex-associated DEGs with identical methylation
  variances were marked as black labels. CpARR5 is earmarked by rectangle as the only
  phytohormone signal-responsive DEG associated with a hypomethylated methylation
  variance. Nine other DEGs were CpACP4 (encoding acyl carrier protein 4, two CsDMC
  in third introns and three CsDMCs in downstream region), CpAPE2 (encoding chloroplast
  triose phosphate/3-phosphoglycerate translocator, five CsDMCs in promoter), CpGsSRK
  (encoding G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase, one CsDMCs
  in downstream), CpMAGL4 (encoding alpha/beta-Hydrolases superfamily protein, four
  CsDMCs in third introns and three CsDMCs in downstream), Cp NB-ARC (encoding NB-ARC
  domain-containing disease resistance protein, three CsDMCs in promoter), CpSBT3.3
  (encoding Subtilase family protein, one CsDMCs in fourth exon), CpTFIID (encoding
  Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 8, one CsDMCs in first exon), CpTLC
  (encoding TRAM, LAG1 and CLN8 lipid-sensing domain-containing protein, one CsDMCs
  in promoter and one CsDMCs in downstream), CpUNC (encoding uncharacterized conserved
  protein, one CsDMCs in downstream). For related CsDMCs genomic positions, see Supplementary
