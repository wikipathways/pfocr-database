caption: Role of the gut microbiota under homeostatic conditions and in different
  stages of CRC development as well as its relevance and potential in conventional
  and future therapy options. (A) In the healthy gut, bacteria are essential for the
  digestive process by breaking down complex foods into metabolites that can be absorbed
  by the human organism. Carbohydrates are converted by bacteria into short-chain
  fatty acids (SCFAs) which are an energy source that can be absorbed by the human
  gut. The intestine is “equipped” with a plethora of mechanisms that synergistically
  act to help maintain a healthy microbiome composition and to separate fungi and
  bacteria from the host cells. Goblet cells produce mucus that serve as physical
  barrier keeping bacteria separated from epithelial cells and Paneth cells kill opportunistic
  pathogens by the secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Microfold cells (M
  cells) are found in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) of the Peyer’s patches
  and can translocate B and T cells to the intestinal lumen in order to kill bacteria.
  They can also present bacterial antigens to dendritic cells (DC) and elicit an IgA-specific
  immune response. (B) In the transformation of normal to malignant tissue, microbiota
  is dysregulated (dysbiosis) and activate several cell-intrinsic mechanisms that
  fuel tumour progression. Microbe- and pathogen-associated-molecular-patterns (MAMPs/PAMPs)
  activate the innate immune system through pattern-recognition-receptors (PPR) resulting
  in an inflammatory response in epithelial cells. (C) As disease progresses, bacteria
  were shown to seed together with tumour cells to other organs. (D) Genotoxic bacteria
  produce toxins such as Colibactin, cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) and typhoid
  toxin (TT) or hydroxyl radicals (H–O) and induce DNA damage and may serve as the
  initiating event of a malignant transformation. pks, polyketide-nonribosomal peptide
  synthase operon. (E,F) Dysregulated microbiota can interact directly with epithelial
  and immune cells and activate CRC-related pathways, such as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K) and Wnt, involved in proliferation and cell survival (E) thereby kickstarting
  cellular transformation. Additionally, some genotoxins can also upregulate signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway which leads to proliferation
  and T cell activation and can thereby elicit a Th17 immune response (F). ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; ETBF, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis; BFT, Bacteroides fragilis
  toxin. (G) Accumulation of certain bacteria strains (biofilm formation) can be detected
  at sites of both normal and tumour tissue which can disrupt the epithelial barrier.
  (H,I) Conventional cancer therapy (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) efficiencies can
  be modulated by the commensal intestinal bacteria and fungi and the resulting side
  effects can be, attenuated. Bacterial metabolism of chemotherapeutic drugs impacts
  both the efficiency and the development of side effects from therapy (H). While
  bacteria can enhance the effects of radiotherapy, fungi hamper its efficiency (I).
  (J) Gut microbiota can be modulated to halt tumour progression and kill malignant
  cells, directly, by loading bacteria with cytotoxic cargos, such as P8 or myrosinase,
  or, indirectly, by stimulating immune cells. (K) Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
  drugs are greatly influenced by bacteria (and fungi). The presence of a given bacterial
  strain can increase therapy efficiency by direct stimulation of immune cells or
  by production of intermediate metabolites. Dysbiosis can also impair therapy efficiency
  and at the same time lead to therapy-related toxicity events resulting from the
  treatment. The presence of a hypermutated phenotype as seen in microsatellite instable
  (MSI) tumours leads to the generation of neoantigens at the tumour cell surface
  that are associated with better ICB therapy outcomes, which can additionally be
  influenced by the gut microbiota. The presence of a dysbiotic microbiota can inhibit
  the effects of ICB. (L) Another way to stop tumour progression could be by targeting
  harmful tumour-promoting bacterial strains with highly specific (designed) bacteriophages.
