caption: Model for the role of SQSTM1 in regulating the integrity of the Keap1-Nrf2
  cell defense pathway. This study has demonstrated that SQSTM1 associates with Keap1
  in cells and contributes to the integrity of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway by regulating
  the basal levels of Keap1 and Nrf2. Recent work has demonstrated increased levels
  of Keap1 in autophagy-deficient cells (). SQSTM1 expression is itself up-regulated
  in an Nrf2-dependent manner under conditions of chemical/oxidative stress (, ),
  suggesting that SQSTM1 forms part of a regulatory feedback loop in the Keap1-Nrf2
  pathway. Under conditions of Nrf2 activation, the elevated expression of SQSTM1
  may enable the targeting of Keap1 for degradation via autophagy, which in turn may
  (i) further contribute to the activation of Nrf2 and/or (ii) represent a means by
  which modified/inactivated Keap1 is removed/recycled to restore homeostasis in the
  pathway. ARE/EpRE, antioxidant response element/electrophile response element.
