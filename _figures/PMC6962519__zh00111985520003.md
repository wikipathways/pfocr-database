caption: Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1)-independent regulation
  of protein translation. The majority of mTORC1-independent mechanisms governing
  protein translation occur via the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway. This pathway begins at the
  cell membrane with activation of Ras kinases via conversion of GDP to GTP. These
  RAS proteins then initiate a signaling cascade, culminating in phosphorylation and
  activation of ERK1/2, which will phosphorylate several downstream targets, the most
  predominant of which is p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p90RSK). This kinase phosphorylates
  a set of substrates similar to ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). ERK1/2 will
  also phosphorylate MAP kinase-interacting kinase 1 (MNK1), which elevates translation
  initiation through phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G and
  eIF4E. rRNA transcription is also elevated in an ERK1/2-dependent fashion via phosphorylation
  of c-myc and upstream binding factor (UBF). Finally, ERK1/2 signaling may affect
  mTORC1 activation through phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2),
  which is removed from mTORC1’s direct activator Rheb. eEF, eukaryotic elongation
  factor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; P, phosphorylation; RAPTOR, regulatory-associated
  protein of mTOR; PRAS40, proline-rich AKT substrate of 40 kDa; DEPTOR, DEP domain-containing
  mTOR-interacting protein; GβL, mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8/G protein β-subunit-like.
