caption: Proteins interacting with XBP1s. XBP1s interacts with a variety of other
  proteins, and these molecular mechanisms are important for regulating the protein
  stability and transcriptional activity of XBP1s. (A) XBP1s interacts with PIN1 in
  a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and this interaction increases the stability
  of XBP1s. XBP1s interacts with the WW domain of PIN1 via the Ser288-Pro motif of
  XBP1s. (B) The p38 MAPK directly phosphorylates the Thr48 and Ser61 residues of
  XBP1s, thereby enhancing the nuclear translocation of XBP1s []. (C) Insulin induces
  the interaction of XBP1s with p85α and p85β, the regulatory subunits of PI3K, leading
  to increased nuclear translocation of XBP1s. (D) IL-15 induces the phosphorylation
  of AKT, which increases the stability of XBP1s by inhibiting ubiquitination. XBP1s
  interacts with T-BET to bind to the proximal region of the granzyme B promoter.
  (E) XBP1s is regulated at the post-translational level via acetylation and deacetylation,
  mediated by its interaction with p300 and SIRT1, respectively. (F) XBP1s forms a
  transcriptional complex with HIF1α, which increases the tumorigenicity and progression
  of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). XBP1s also forms a complex with MYC, enhancing
  the transcriptional activity of XBP1s in tumors. (G) PGC1α reduces the XBP1s stability,
  which negatively affects the activity and protein level of XBP1s. PGC1α and XBP1s
  interact with each other in their activation domains to promote the protein degradation
  of XBP1s via ubiquitination. (H) Fbw7 interacts with XBP1s in a phosphorylation-dependent
  manner to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of XBP1s. (I) XBP1u functions
  as a negative feedback regulator of XBP1s via direct interaction. The complex of
  XBP1u and XBP1s is rapidly degraded by the proteasomes due to the degradation domain
  contained in XBP1u. (J) XBP1s binds directly to the FoxO1 and facilitates the degradation
  of FoxO1 via the 26S proteasome pathway. FoxO1 is a transcription factor that regulates
  gluconeogenesis by increasing the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
  and glucose 6 phosphatase.
