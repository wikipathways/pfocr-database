caption: The images showed that the genes involved in fatty acid synthesis were mapped
  to the reference pathway using KEGG. The genes annotated in KEGG map were highlighted
  with red texts and red arrows. The blue box in each pathway showed the expression
  tendency of genes in two cultivars. The red on the blue box shows upregulated, the
  green indicates downregulated.
