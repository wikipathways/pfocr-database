caption: This example integrative query incorporates data on genetic associations
  to disease, Gene Ontology annotations for cellular compartment, protein target information
  for compounds, pathway data, and protein domain information. Specifically, this
  query (depicted schematically at right) retrieves genes that are (i) associated
  with a respiratory system disease, (ii) that encode a membrane-bound protein, and
  (iii) that sit within the same biochemical pathway as (iv) a second gene encoding
  a protein with a serine-threonine kinase domain and (v) a known inhibitor, and reports
  a list of those inhibitors. Aspects related to Disease Ontology in blue; aspects
  related to biochemistry in red/orange; aspects related to chemistry in green. Properties
  are shown in italics. Real-time query results can be viewed at https://w.wiki/6pZ.
