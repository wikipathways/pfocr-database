caption: Oxidative stress alters the interaction of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1 (Keap1) and Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), thereby liberating
  Nrf2 activity from repression by Keap1. NRF2 migrates into the nucleus were it activates
  the transcription of Superoxide dismutase 2, mitochondrial (SOD2). At the same time,
  oxidative stress causes the down-regulation of Peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1-α) and Nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1)
  with the consequent down-regulation of PGC-1α downstream target genes (TFAM, COX6C,
  COX7C, UQCRH and MCAD). The reduced TFAM expression causes a decrease in mitochondrial
  transcription and replication. The down-regulation of all these factors suggests
  the decrease in mitochondrial OXPHOS activity in order to reduce ROS accumulation
  and creating an antioxidant feedback.
