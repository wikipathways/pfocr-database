caption: (1) A thiol ester bond between the E1-activating enzyme and ubiquitin is
  formed during ubiquitin activation. (2) The activated ubiquitin is then transferred
  to the E2-conjugating enzyme. (3) How ubiquitin is added onto a substrate varies
  according to the ubiquitin ligase (E3) category. (3A) RING-type E3 ligases function
  as a molecular scaffold that position the E2-conjugating enzyme with the substrate.
  (3B) HECT-type E3 ligases form an intermediary complex with ubiquitin leading to
  its transfer from the E2-conjugating enzyme to the substrate. (4A) Polyubiquitinated
  substrates may be targeted for cellular signaling or (4B) proteasomal degradation
  depending on the ubiquitin linkages (5). De-ubiquitinases (DUBs) recycle ubiquitin
  completing the cycle.
