caption: a | Classic steroid sinalling pathway. Steroids enter cells through mechanisms
  that are still not understood. Some steroid receptors, such as glucocorticoid (GC)
  and androgen (A) receptors (GR and AR, respectively), are primarily in the cytoplasm
  as monomers bound to heat shock proteins (HSPs). Others, such as the oestrogen (E)
  receptor (ER), are located as monomers primarily in the nucleus, although a small
  percentage may also be bound to HSPs in the cytoplasm (not shown). In the case of
  GC and A, steroid binding to cytoplasmic receptors triggers release from the HSPs,
  receptor dimerization, alterations in receptor conformation and nuclear localization.
  In the case of E, the sex steroid binds to nuclear receptors to promote dimerization
  and changes in receptor conformation. In all cases, nuclear dimerized receptors
  then bind to specific steroid-response elements (SREs) and interact with various
  co-regulators to modulate gene transcription through either repression or activation.
  b | Tethered steroid signalling. Nuclear steroid receptors can also modulate gene
  expression without direct DNA binding. In this case, they bind to other transcription
  factors, such as AP1 or SP1, to either repress or activate transcription.
