caption: a, b | During Drosophila neuromuscular (NMJ) development, precise apposition
  of the pre- and postsynaptic molecular components is required for bouton maturation
  and subsequent expansion. New boutons bud out from existing mature boutons to adjust
  for an increase in target muscle size. c, d | New buds expand and subsequently mature
  in tune with a synchronous folding of the postsynaptic membrane into the subsynaptic
  reticulum (SSR). Recent observations at the Drosophila NMJ demonstrate crucial roles
  for the Wnt and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signal transduction pathways
  in these processes–. e | In the absence of Wingless (Wg) function, fewer synapses
  form, and those that do form fail to develop pre- and postsynaptic densities, T-bars
  and postsynaptic SSR. The presynaptic cytoskeletal network appears to be destabilized,
  and postsynaptic glutamate receptors (GluR) are not correctly localized. f | wit
  mutant synapses have normal SSR and apparently normal GluR localization. However,
  they have presynaptic defects such as an increase in the number of T-bars per presynaptic
  density, abnormal apposition of pre- and postsynaptic densities, and an abnormal
  appearance of presynaptic T-bars. These studies indicate a presynaptic role for
  the TGFβ type II receptor, Wit, which functions as a part of a retrograde signalling
  mechanism to adjust the size of the presynaptic arborization to the postsynaptic
  muscle size. By contrast, Wg is secreted by presynaptic boutons, and seems to function
  in an anterograde fashion to control the correct positioning of active zones and
  postsynaptic SSR, as well as bouton number. Together, they coordinate synapse development
  by regulating bouton budding, cytoskeletal stability, number of functional active
  zones, folding of the postsynaptic muscle membrane, and levels of pre- and postsynaptic
  molecules, including GluRs and cell adhesion molecules. DFz2, Drosophila Frizzled
