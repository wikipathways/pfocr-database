caption: 'Sphingolipid metabolic pathway. SPLs have three major metabolic pathways,
  all of which converge into ceramides: (a) de novo synthesis coming from saturated
  fatty acids, (b) breakdown pathway in which sphingomyelin loses its phosphocholine
  headgroup, and (c) salvage pathway that allows sphingosine recycling from complex
  SPLs. The fatty acid (light orange box) defines SPL species, whereas the headgroup
  (dark orange boxes) defines the SPL class.'
