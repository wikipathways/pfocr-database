caption: Versatile cross-talks of CAF with activated progenitor cells and HCC. Liver
  progenitor cells (activated cholangiocytes, oval cells) emerge once the liver is
  exposed to repetitive and multiple damage, including chronic inflammation of a “wound
  that does not heal.” The progenitor cells are more resistant to chronic stress and
  can differentiate into healthy hepatocytes, when the injury subsides but also to
  fibrogenic and even cancerogenic epithelial progenitors. They engage in a bi-directional
  crosstalk with stromal cells that include inflammatory cells like TAM (M2-type macrophages)
  but also activated HSC/myofibroblasts that mutually sustain their growth and expansion,
  resulting in advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis and/or HCC and CCC. Apart from this pathway
  for fibrosis that is also prevalent in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and
  other desmoplastic cancers, additional “second hits” like genetic alterations induced
  by hepatitis virus integration into the hepatocyte genome, other mutations or metabolic
  promoters, like in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), further promote and sustain
  hepatic cancer (bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; CAF, Cancer-associated fibroblasts;
  CCL2, CC-Chemokin-Ligand-2 (CCL2); CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; ET-1,
  Endothelin-1; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; IL-6 Interleukin 6; PDGF-BB/AB, platelet-derived
  growth factor BB/AB; Shh; hedgehog signaling pathway).
