caption: 'Diagram of the activation of autophagy and apoptosis via the ISR signaling
  pathway during viral infection. Autophagy: Autophagy is activated through the PKR-eIF2α
  pathway upon infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and HSV-1
  infection; CV, HCV, PFV, BTV, CVB3, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and DEV infection,
  respectively, induces autophagy through the PERK-eIF2α pathway. FMDV-VP2 induces
  autophagy through interaction with HSPB1 and activation of the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway.
  In turn, HSV-Us11, HCV-NS5A, and HCV-E2 protein block autophagy (red color). Apoptosis:
  Apoptosis is induced via the PERK and PKR-eIF2α pathway under infection with IBV,
  PCV2, BVDV, JEV, and WNV, respectively. Oppositely, the JEV-NS2A protein inhibits
  apoptosis (yellow color). In addition, autophagy and apoptosis simultaneously are
  induced through the PERK-eIF2α pathway during DENV and NDV infection, respectively
  (pink color).'
