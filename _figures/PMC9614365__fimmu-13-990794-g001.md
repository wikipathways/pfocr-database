caption: Physiological and experimentally induced metabolic states of Th17 cells.
  (A) After T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, Glucose transporter 1(GLUT1) is upregulated
  in support of glycolysis (denoted as a G within a square). TCR engagement also augments
  mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) activity via Akt/PI3K, leading to cell
  differentiation. Products generated by glycolysis are utilized in the pentose-phosphate
  pathway (PPP) and in lipid biogenesis; the latter was regulated by Acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  1 (ACC1) but not by mitochondrial anaplerosis, as the cells have limited expression
  of Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH1). Anaplerosis is driven by amino acids, such as
  glutamine that is imported through the amino acid transporter SLC1A5 and metabolized
  by glutaminase 1 (GLS1). The metabolite 2-Hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), generated by
  Glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1), suppresses the activity of the FOXP3
  promoter. Other amino acid metabolites favor an epigenetic configuration that promotes
  the Th17-cell transcriptional program. (B) Deprivation of amino acids glutamine,
  serine, or methionine or ablation of GLS1 or of an enzyme involved in the one-carbon
  pathway Bifunctional methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (MTHFD2)
  or inhibition of the poly-amine pathway prevents Th17 cell proliferation. Increased
  ROS production, perhaps due to the lack of glutathione and substrate (succinate)
  for mitochondrial electron transport, alters epigenetic configuration to favor FOXP3
  expression and Treg-mediated suppressive activities. (C) Pathogenic Th17 cells,
  signified by active mTORC1, lack of OXPHOS, production of IFNγ, and high ΔΨm, rely
  on the polyamine pathway and putrescin. (D) Ablation of mTORC1 and reduced ΔΨm result
  in Th17 cells expressing stemness markers T-cell factor 1 (TCF1) and Lymphoid enhancer-binding
  factor 1 (LEF1).
