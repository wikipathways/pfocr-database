caption: A schematic representation of possible mechanism underlying hepatotoxicity.
  Various environmental pollutants, including metal contaminants, fossil fuel combustion
  by-products, and persistent organic pollutants, induce the pathological development
  of liver diseases through prolonged exposure, involving multiple biological levels.
  At the cellular level, pollutants contribute to liver disease not only by disrupting
  immune cells within the liver, such as macrophages and B cells, but also by recruiting
  extrahepatic immune cells that affect the immune microenvironment. In terms of pathway
  regulation, pollutants impair critical signaling pathways by reducing ATP production,
  causing mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction, and activating the NF-κB pathway to
  interfere with cytokine release. This disruption triggers hepatic lesions, beginning
  with liver steatosis (non-alcoholic fatty liver), progressing to fibrosis and tissue
  remodeling, and ultimately potentially leading to liver cancer. This gradual progression
  underscores the crucial role of long-term exposure in the pollution-mediated development
  of liver disease
