caption: Activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) signal through scaffolding adaptors
  (e.g. IRS-1) that activate PI-3kinase. Pten suppresses the activation of Akt. Deletion
  of Pten leads to the hyperactivation Akt, loss of FoxO function, and activation
  of the mTorc1 and mTorc2 complexes. Important target genes of FoxO include regulators
  of cell death (e.g. Bim-1 and Fas-L), cell cycle progression (e.g. p21Cip1 and p27Kip1),
  and ROS detoxification (e.g. catalase and MnSOD). There are multiple pathways downstream
  of activated mTorc1, including S6 kinase (which regulates protein synthesis and
  ribosome biogenesis) and 4E-BP1 (which regulates cap-dependent translation). Rapamycin
  treatment reduces the activation of S6K, reduces the inhibition of 4E-BP and rescues
  the function of Pten-deficient HSCs. Although Akt activation leads to mTorc1 activation,
  mTorc1 activation can reduce Akt activation by a negative feedback mechanism involving
  S6K. Rapamycin treatment can disrupt this negative feedback mechanism and therefore
  increase Akt signaling, which affects the many effectors that lie downstream of
  Akt. Downstream targets of mTorc2 include kinases such as PKCα Rho, Rac, and Akt.
  Prolonged rapamycin treatment has been demonstrated to also inhibit assembly of
  the mTorc2 complex by sequestering mTor, leading to decreased Akt activation. This
  finding raises the possibility that rapamycin treatment may also restore FoxO function
  in Pten-deficient HSCs by inhibiting mTorc2. Abbreviations (RTKs, receptor tyrosine
