caption: Consequences of IDH1/2-related cancer metabolism for redox homeostasis. A
  simplified scheme demonstrates the pro-oxidant character of reductive reactions
  of IDH1 and IDH2. Retarded electron (e−) transfer via the respiratory chain complexes
  CI, CIII, and retarded turnover of cytochrome c, together with feedback inhibition
  of proton pumping by the inhibited ATP-synthase with r-2HG (hypothetically also
  in humans) are the main inducers of elevated superoxide (O2•−) formation. In particular,
  a high NADH/NAD+ ratio leads to superoxide formation at the flavin IF site of Complex
  I (not shown). Superoxide is dismuted by the matrix MnSOD/SOD2 and intermembrane
  space or cytosolic CuZnSOD/SOD1 (data not shown) into H2O2, the most prominent ROS.
  High ROS formation within the mitochondrial matrix depletes GSH, which requires
  NADPH for its synthesis. As a result, NADPH is instead depleted or rapidly diminished.
  The oxidated mitochondrial ROS equilibrium is spread toward the cytosol. Also, fast
  tumor growth contributes to depletion of cytosolic NADPH. Its pool is regenerated
  when cytosolic NAPDH is supplied by two PPP enzymes, G6PDH and 6PGDH but consumed
  again by the constitutively active NADPH oxidase NOX4 that produces H2O2 directly.
  Both r-2HG and s-2HG can stimulate not only the NRF2-reprogrammed elevated antioxidant
  defense that attenuates the cytosolic but also mitochondrial oxidative stress. Nevertheless,
  ROS being elevated even transiently can evoke the activation of redox-sensitive
  kinases, besides oxidizing DNA and mtDNA. 6PGDH, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase;
  G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GSH, reduced glutathione; H2O2, hydrogen
  peroxide; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; NOX4, NADPH oxidase isoform 4; NRF2, nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase.
