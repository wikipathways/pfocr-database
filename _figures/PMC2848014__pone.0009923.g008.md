caption: Heat shock protein 27 kda (HSPB1) and superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) are both
  central proteins in the pathway analysis performed with the up-regulated list (A).
  SOD1 is regulated by a number of cytokine molecules, and HSPB1 is directly associated
  with growth factors. Panel B shows the common regulators for the down-regulated
  proteins observed in this study. It is evident that CAT and crystal structures of
  mutant K206A, chain A (TF) is a key protein that interacts with a number of different
  signaling molecules in this pathway.
