caption: Biological characterization of gene silenced by endogenous siRNA and exogenous
  siRNA. Dicer cleaves the dsRNA for the endogenous pathway and gives rise to siRNAs.
  Then siRNA molecule is incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)
  in the cell cytoplasm, and the sense strand is cleaved by Argonaute-2. Next, the
  antisense strand of the activated RISC binds to and cleaves the target mRNA that
  is complementary to the antisense strand, preventing translation and thereby silencing
  gene expression. The activated RISC can be recycled, after several cycles of synthesis-cutting,
  the role of RNAi is continuously amplified, and finally, the target mRNA is completely
  degraded. For exogenous pathways, siRNA-carriers deliver siRNAs to glioma cells,
  and siRNA can be directly loaded into RISC without pre-treatment with the dicer
  enzyme. siRNA can silence cancer-related genes, thereby inhibiting cell growth and
  migration, reducing drug resistance, and improving anti-tumor immunity.
