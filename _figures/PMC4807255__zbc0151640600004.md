caption: Illustration of the stochastic machine. This figure shows a possible configuration
  for the complex involving axin, β-catenin, GSC-3β, and CKI-α. Axin is shown with
  color variation to make its pathway easier to follow. Ordered RGS (for regulator
  of G protein signaling) and DIX (for DIshevelled and aXin) domains are located at
  the N and C termini of axin, respectively. The dashed line corresponds approximately
  to the location of the Gly295–Ala500 disordered segment (). Axin binds to CKI-α
  (at two separate sites), to GSK3β, and also to β-catenin. Because the β-catenin
  binding site of axin is located between the GSK3β and CKI-α interaction sites, and
  because the two binding sites with CKI-α may lead to the formation of a loop, β-catenin
  becomes close to both kinases. Hence, the formation of this β-catenin destruction
  complex pulls all the proteins together, and substantially raises their local concentrations.
  Because the phosphorylation sites are in a disordered region of β-catenin and because
  the various binding sites are all in a long disordered region in axin, random motions
  of these flexible regions can readily bring about the substrate-enzyme collisions
  needed for function. Reproduced with permission from Ref. . © 2013 John Wiley &
