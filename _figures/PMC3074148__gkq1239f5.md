caption: Schematic representation of the two degradation pathways followed by MicA.
  RNase E and RNase III are represented by scissors and pliers, respectively. The
  two different pathways for MicA degradation are shown on the left side. The possible
  associations of MicA with its targets are also depicted. In the wild-type, MicA
  and the targets should be fully degraded as a result of both degradation pathways
  in cooperation with the exoribonucleolytic activity. In the RNase III− mutant, the
  MicA-target dependent degradation by RNase III is blocked. As a result, some degradation
  intermediates are stabilized and can be detected, namely the target and MicA strands
  that have interacted but could not be cleaved by RNase III. ompA being the main
  target of MicA, its species are over-represented. When additionally the ompA target
  mRNA is absent, the respective degradation intermediate is no longer present in
  the cell and, as a consequence, there is a reduced level of transcripts detected
  with probes complementary to MicA-targets.
