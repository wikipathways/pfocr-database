caption: c-Src and PDGFR are connected functionally to each other and provide  links
  to cell-cycle regulators in Gq-coupled 5-HT2B  receptor mitogenic signaling. c-Src
  either acts alone to control cyclin  E induction or in concert with a RTK PDGFR
  to induce cyclin D1  expression via the ERK/MAPK pathway. This action raises the  level
  of pRb phosphorylation and triggers cell-cycle progression.
