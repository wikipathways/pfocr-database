caption: 'The mTOR kinase nucleates two characterized protein complexes termed mTORC1
  and mTORC2. mTORC1 is composed of 5 subunits : (i) the mTOR catalytic subunit, (ii)
  Raptor, (iii) mLST8, (iv) PRAS40, and (v) Deptor. The mTORC2 complex contains 6
  proteins (i) mTOR, (ii) Rictor, (iii) mSin1, (iv) Protor-1, (v) mLST8, and (vi)
  Deptor. mTORC1 is sensitive to nutrients and is inhibited by FKBP12-rapamycin. One
  of the most important sensors involved in the regulation of mTORC1 activity is TSC,
  which is a heterodimer composed of TSC1 and TSC2. TSC1/2 functions as a GTPase GAP
  for the small, Ras-related GTPase, Rheb. The active, GTP-bound form of Rheb directly
  interacts with mTORC1 to stimulate its activity. As a Rheb-specific GAP, TSC1/2
  negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling by converting Rheb into its inactive GDP-bound
  state. Stimulation of cells with growth factors activates Akt, Erk, and Rsk, which
  inactivates TSC and promotes Rheb activation. Akt activation also promotes mTORC1
  activity by phosphorylating PRAS40, a negative regulator of mTORC1. At the opposite,
  induction of Redd1 and AMPK by hypoxia and energy deficit activates TSC1/2 and turn
  down mTORC1 signaling. The activation of mTORC1 by amino acids is regulated by the
  Rag GTPase and is independent of TSC1/2. Activation of mTORC1 by growth factors
  or amino acids promotes protein synthesis via the phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4EBPs.
  High activation of S6K1 by mTORC1 induces a feedback inhibition loop in which S6K1
  reduces growth factor signaling by promoting the phosphorylation and the degradation
  of IRS-1. mTORC2 is activated by growth factors and regulates many AGC kinases (Akt,
  SGK1, PKC-α) playing key roles in controlling cell survival, metabolism and cytoskeletal
  organization. This complex is insensitive to FKBP12-rapamycin but is inhibited by
  the newly characterized mTOR inhibitor Torin1. Akt, protein kinase B; AMPK, AMP-activated
