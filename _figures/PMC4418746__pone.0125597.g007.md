caption: A) Pro-aSMase is distributed between the Golgi secretory pathway and the
  lysosomal pathway. B) SMase, ceramidase and phospholipases can induce the formation
  of secretory vesicles or blebbing of plasma membranes to generate nano- or micro-sized
  particles with different SP composition. C) Secreted aSMase (S-aSMase) plays a role
  in endocytosis, membrane repair or remodeling. D) Endocytosis mediated by aSMase
  influences amyloid precursor protein processing and the concentration of Aβ. E)
  Lysosomal aSMase (L-aSMase) plays a role in the fusion of phagophores with lysosomes,
  resulting in autophagocytosis (F). Any dysfunction in this sphingolipid metabolic
  pathway, such as the decrease in secretory aSMase in AD, will result in changes
  in the physical properties of cellular membranes, anomaly in exocytosis/endocytosis,
  defective trafficking of lipids and membrane-anchored proteins, resulting in dysfunctional
  membrane repair, and altered Aβ excretion. Abbreviations used on Fig 7. GP, glycerophospholipids;
  SM, sphingomyelin; Cer, ceramide; S_aSMase, secretory acid sphingomyelinase; L_aSMase,
  lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase; mb_nSMase, membrane bound neutral sphingomyelinase;
  APP, amyloid precursor protein.
