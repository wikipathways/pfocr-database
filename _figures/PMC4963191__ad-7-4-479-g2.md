caption: The representation of the effects of ADAMTS on Tau production. Reelin binds
  to its receptors and activates phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and protein
  kinase B (PKB/Akt). It leads a remarkable inhibition in glycogen synthase kinase
  3β (GSK3β), which is an enzyme that regulates phosphorylation of the microtubule-stabilizing
  protein tau. After ADAMTS digest Reelin, depressed reelin level may in turn increase
  tau phosphorylation at the end of the signaling pathway. (It was adapted from the
  resources Krstic D [], Hisanaga A [], and Yu NN []).
