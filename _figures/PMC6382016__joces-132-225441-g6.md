caption: Schematic diagrams of the distinct regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis between
  GV and MII oocytes. In GV oocytes (left), Ca2+ influx stimulates Ca2+ oscillations
  by stimulating IP3R1 and triggering CICR and/or activating PLC family proteins,
  leading to IP3synthesis. Note that a variety of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane
  including Cav3.2 T-type, TRP and/or ORAI1 channels are proposed to mediate the majority
  of this influx, although the plasma membrane channels that mediate Ca2+ influx during
  maturation and fertilization remain to be fully identified. The persistently low
  [Ca2+]ER levels and spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in GV oocytes serve as the natural
  trigger for Ca2+ influx through a store-operated Ca2+ influx pathway that is normally
  associated with expression of STIM1 and ORAI1, which is required to sustain the
  oscillations. Spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations are propagated into the neighboring
  mitochondria, activating mitochondrial metabolism and increasing the production
  of ATP. During oocyte maturation, around the GVBD stage, the putative active channel(s)
  are internalized, which causes downregulation of Ca2+ influx and termination of
  spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations, thereby allowing the increase in [Ca2+]ER content
  during maturation. A high [Ca2+]ER level in unfertilized (arrested) MII oocytes
  (middle) is important for robust and long-lasting Ca2+ oscillations responsible
  for the completion of all events of egg activation. After fertilization, the sperm-derived
  PLCζ (PLCZ1) triggers Ca2+ oscillations in MII oocytes (right). Mitochondria take
  up part of IP3R1-mediated Ca2+ release, which is required to maintain [Ca2+]ER levels
  and long-lasting Ca2+ oscillations to maintain ATP output that is necessary to support
  SERCA activity that in turn replenishes [Ca2+]ER and sustains the oscillations.
