caption: Mitochondria-mediated regulated cell death. (A) Mitochondrial apoptosis.
  Signals from mitochondrial injury stimulate the synthesis of BH3-only proteins,
  which can activate BAX/BAK on mitochondrial membrane to cause MOMP when the isolation
  of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is exceeded. Cytochrome C interacts with APAF-1
  to form the heptameric apoptosome, which initiates the caspase cascade to execute
  apoptosis. Activation of caspases can be inhibited by XIAP, which in turn is blocked
  by SMAC and OMI. Activated caspases 3 and 7 cleave cell components, including nuclear
  DNA and ultimately cause apoptosis. (B) Parthanatos. Mitochondrial abnormalities
  can also directly lead to nuclear DNA damage, which activates PARP1 to deplete NAD+,
  thereby inhibiting glycolytic production of pyruvate and NADH. In the absence of
  substrates, mitochondrial depolarization triggers the release of AIF, leading to
  parthanatos. (C) Exogenous apoptosis. The release of contents during mitochondrial
  injury activates immune cells and leads to the release of TNF. After TNF binds to
  TNFR1, FADD is recruited and caspase 8 is activated, directly activating caspase
  3/7 to induce apoptosis. Caspase 8 can also activate BID to enter the mitochondrial
  apoptosis pathway. In this process, cardiolipin provides an anchor and an activating
  platform for caspase-8 and BID at the mitochondrial membrane surface. (D) Necroptosis.
  RIPK1 is also recruited after the binding of TNF and TNFR1, but recruited RIPK1
  is usually ubiquitinated and inactivated. ROS, acidosis and other factors can lead
  to deubiquitination of RIPK1, which in turn leads to phosphorylation of RIPK3 and
  MLKL, leading to interruption of membrane continuity and necrosis. However, in most
  cases, simultaneous activation of caspase 8 can lyse RIPK1 and RIPK3 and truncate
  the Necroptosis.
