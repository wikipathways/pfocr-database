caption: This diagram describes some of the major pathways responsible for rodent
  β-cell proliferation. This field is evolving and we have attempted to provide a
  summary of the major pathways involve this process. The insulin/insulin-like growth
  factor I (IGF1) receptor, hepatocyte growth factor and glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP1)
  signal through the IRS/PI3 kinase pathway to regulate Akt by modulating PDK1. Complete
  activation of Akt requires the phosphorylation of this kinase by mTORC2. The serine
  threonine kinase has been demonstrate to play a major role in regulation of β-cell
  proliferation, survival and cell size by acting on multiple downstream targets including
  FoxO1, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2, Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)
  3 and the cell cycle inhibitors p27cip and p21 among others. Akt activity is negatively
  regulated directly and indirectly by TRB3 and PTEN. Downstream of Akt, the TSC/mTORC1
  integrates signals from growth factors and nutrients. Nutrients can modulate this
  pathway directly by acting on the protein Rheb or indirectly by regulating the activity
  of the AMPK pathway, which is also regulated by LKB1. mTORC1 regulates protein translation
  and cell size by regulating S6K and 4E-BPs. HGF binding to its tyrosine kinase receptor,
  c-Met, results PKCζ activation which in turns inactivates GSK3β and increases phosphorylation
  and activation of mTORC1. Activation of the prolactin receptor induces Jak2/Stat5
  signaling and/or Jak2/Bcl6/Menin to induce β-cell proliferation. Recent data shows
  that lactogens induce proliferation by activation of tryptophan hydroxylases (Tph1/2
  with generation of serotonin. Serotonin is secreted and act in paracrine fashion
  to assumed to act via the HTR2b receptor to modulate intracellular calcium and PKC
  or PI3K members. Glucose is transported by the glucose transporter Glut2 and metabolizes
  to increase the ATP ratio, which subsequently inhibits the Kir6.2 channel resulting
  depolarization and calcium influx. Intracellular calcium signaling is a major driver
  of β-cell proliferation by regulating multiple signaling pathways including Calmodulin
  (Cam) Calcineurin (Cna1,2 and Cnb1,2) and NFAT transcription. In parallel, glucose
  activates ChREBP and cMyc to induce cell cycle progression (not shown). Upon binding
  to GLP-1 GLP-1 receptor results in elevation of cAMP, protein kinase A (PKA) activation
  and this ultimately results in which can phosphorylation of β-catenin by MEK/ERK1/2
  pathway. Leptin acts via the JAK-STAT pathway induces Akt signaling by inhibiting
  PTEN. The Wnt/frizzled pathway acts by inhibiting GSK-3β and blocking phosphorylation
  of β-catenin modulate transcription of Lef/Tcf7L2 dependent genes such as cyclin
  D2 and potentially cyclin D1 and cMyc and activates cell cycle progression. It is
  important to note that our understanding of human β-cell proliferation is notably
  limited compared to that of rodents.
