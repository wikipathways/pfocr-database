caption: 'Chemistry and enzymes involved in (p)ppGpp synthesis and degradation. A
  Synthesis and degradation of (p)ppGpp. The substrates for synthesis are ATP and
  GTP or GDP and the reaction is catalyzed by the synthetase domain (SYNTH) of long
  RSH and SAS enzymes. (p)ppGpp degradation occurs by hydrolysis of the 3′ pyrophosphate
  regenerating GTP/GDP. This reaction is catalyzed by the hydrolase domain (HD) of
  long RSH and SAH enzymes. B The RSH (RelA SpoT Homology) superfamily consists of
  long RSH, SAS (small alarmone synthetase) and SAH (small alarmone hydrolase) enzymes.
  Long RSHs have both a (p)ppGpp hydrolase domain (HD) and a (p)ppGpp synthetase domain
  (SYNTH) in their catalytic N-terminal half. In addition, long RSHs have a complex
  regulatory C-terminal half constituted of four domains: TGS (ThrRs, GTPase, and
  SpoT); αH (alpha helical); ZFD (zinc finger domain) or CC (conserved cysteine);
  and RRM (RNA recognition motif) or ACT (aspartokinase, chorismate mutase, and TyrA).
  SAS and SAH enzymes have a single catalytic domain, (SYNTH) and (HD) respectively'
