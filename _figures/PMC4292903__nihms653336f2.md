caption: Differentially expressed genes in the important signaling pathway and their
  connectivity while emphasized into metabolic disease and disorders in the 45 month
  PCBs exposed population in Slovakia between genes expressed (with ≥1.5 fold change,
  t-test, p <0.05) in a cellular level with some downstream effects, e.g.; Gene expression,
  Differentiation, Cell survival, etc. Geometric figures in red denote up-regulated
  genes and those are green indicate down-regulation. Genes in the top networks were
  allowed to grow our pathway with the direct/indirect relationship from the IPA knowledge
  base with the stringent filter, experimentally observed, those who were only from
  human study. Canonical pathways (functions/signaling; CP) viz., Insulin Receptor
  signaling, Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Signaling, Maturity-Onset Diabetes
  of Young (MODY) signaling that are highly represented are shown within the box.
  Genes in uncolored notes were not identified as differentially expressed in our
  experiment and were integrated into computational generated networks based on evidence
  stored in the IPA knowledge base.
