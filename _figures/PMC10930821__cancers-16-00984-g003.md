caption: 'A summary model for the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun/activator protein
  1 (AP-1)-mediated signaling pathway in anticancer drug-induced cell death. Anticancer
  drugs that damage DNA and tubulin activate JNK, causing c-Jun/AP-1 to dimerize predominantly
  with Fra-1 and activate target genes such as Bax/Bak and Fas L, which activate the
  caspase cascade in an AP-1-dependent pathway leading to apoptotic cell death. JNK
  phosphorylates and inactivates antiapoptotic proteins such as B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2
  and Bcl-xL, which in turn activate Bax and cause apoptotic cell death. JNK also
  activates growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (Gadd153), which is induced
  by AP-1-dependent and -independent pathways in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated
  cell death. ER stress and p53 induction by anticancer drugs activates Gadd153 and
  causes ER-mediated cell death. JNK phosphorylates Beclin-1, dissociates from Bcl-2,
  and induces autophagic cell death. The JNK-mediated upregulation of autophagy-related
  genes (ATGs) involves the AP-1 transcription factor complex. In response to DNA
  damage, JNK mediates apoptosis by phosphorylating p53, stabilizing p73, dimerizing
  p53 and p73, and promoting the expression of proapoptotic target genes such as Bax
  and Puma. Abbreviations: VBL, vinblastine; PTX, paclitaxel; DTX, docetaxel; UV,
