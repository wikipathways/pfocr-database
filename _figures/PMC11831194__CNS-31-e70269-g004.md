caption: Neuroinflammation role of OPN in Alzheimer's disease pathology. This figure
  illustrates how OPN contributes to AD pathology by promoting inflammatory responses,
  synaptic pruning, and activating intracellular signaling pathways that lead to neuronal
  apoptosis. In pathological conditions such as AD, where amyloid plaques are present,
  microglia and PVM/PVF cells secrete OPN. As a chemoattractive cytokine, OPN recruits
  more activated microglia and infiltrating myeloid cells (macrophages/monocytes),
  which in turn secrete more OPN, exacerbating the inflammatory cascade. OPN exerts
  its effects through its receptors, integrin, and activating various pathways, including
  the complement cascade, TNF‐α, NF‐κB, and MAPK signaling pathways, all of which
  contribute to inflammatory responses and cell death. Additionally, by inhibiting
  TREM2/TAM signaling, OPN impairs the phagocytosis of amyloid‐beta. In neurons, OPN
  can also activate the Akt and P38 MAPK pathways, leading to apoptosis and inflammation.
  Also, it shows the microglia and astrocyte interaction to synaptic pruning by molecular
  cross talk. OPN and CD44 promote the inflammatory state of astrocytes, leading to
  the secretion of C1q, a key initiator of the complement cascade, which mediates
  synaptic loss. Created with BioRender.com
