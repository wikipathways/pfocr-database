caption: 'Classical bacterial glycogen structure, biosynthesis and regulation. (A)
  Glycogen is a very large-branched glucose homopolymer containing ~90% α-(1 → 4)-glucosidic
  linkages and 10% α-(1 → 6)-linkages. (B) The classical bacterial glycogen biosynthetic
  pathway involves the action of three enzymes: AGPase, GS; and GBE. Glycogen degradation
  is carried out by two enzymes: GP and GDE. (C) EcAGPase catalyzes the main regulatory
  step in bacterial glycogen. EcAGPase catalyzes the reaction between ATP and G1P
  in the presence of a divalent metal cation, Mg2+, to form ADP-Glc and PPi. ADP-Glc
  biosynthesis and hydrolysis directions are shown as a full and dotted lines, respectively.
  The two major positive and negative allosteric regulators, FBP and AMP, respectively,
  are shown.'
