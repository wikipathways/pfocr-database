caption: MUC1-C activates the inflammatory TAK1→IKK→NF-κB p65 pathway. MUC1-C also
  binds directly to NF-κB p65, increases occupancy of MUC1-C/NF-κB p65 complexes on
  the ZEB1 promoter, induces ZEB1 expression, and drives EMT by ZEB1-mediated mechanisms.
  Additionally, MUC1-C increases MUC1-C/NF-κB p65 occupancy on the DNMT1/3b promoters,
  induces DNMT1/3b expression, and alters global and gene-specific DNA methylation
  patterns. In this way, MUC1-C→NF-κB p65 signaling plays a role in integrating EMT
  with epigenetic changes in gene expression and the repression of TSGs.
