caption: Contribution of the CD5-CK2 signaling pathway to the generation of Th1, Th2,
  and Th17 cells from naïve CD4+ T-cells. Naïve CD4+ T-cells were co-cultured with
  irradiated APCs and stimulated with MOG35-55 peptide (A) or anti-CD3 (B) under non-polarizing
  (unpolarized) or polarizing conditions and generation of Th subpopulations was evaluated.
  Numbers in each quadrant represent the average frequency of CD4+ T-cells expressing
  IFNγ, IL-17a and/or IL-4±SEM from four independent experiments performed with at
  least three mice per experiment. C, Percent 7-AAD+CD4+ T-cell at 24 h and 120 h
  and D, RORγt+CD4+ T-cells at 120 h following stimulation with MOG35-55 peptide under
  Th17 polarizing conditions. Data is mean±SEM of three independent experiments with
  at least two mice/group. E, pSTAT1 (Ser727) and F, pSTAT3 (Tyr705) in CD4+ T-cells
  stimulated for 72h with MOG35-55 peptide under Th17 polarizing conditions. The filled
  shaded histograms are unstimulated and the dashed histograms are isotype immunoglobulin
  stained cell controls. For pSTAT1 (E), the MFI of 2D2.CD5ΔCK2BD is 52±4.8 and 2D2.CD5WT
  is 30±4.3. For pSTAT3 (F) the MFI for 2D2.CD5ΔCK2BD is 32±2.9 and 2D2.CD5WT is 21±3.5.
  Histograms represent data from one representative mouse per group from two mice/experiment,
  n=3 experiments. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.
