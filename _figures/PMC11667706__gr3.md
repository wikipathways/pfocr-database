caption: 'Overview of the natural microbial ethylene glycol (EG) assimilation pathways.
  The metabolic EG assimilation pathways, namely the oxidative route (blue), the glyoxylate
  shunt (green), and the β-hydroxyaspartate (BHA) cycle (orange), and their integration
  with central metabolism (black) is shown. Each step of these three pathways is annotated
  with its corresponding Enzyme Commission (EC) number and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of
  Genes and Genomes (KEGG) reaction number, when available, along with the stoichiometric
  equations for each pathway. The alternative conversion of tartronate semialdehyde
  into glycerate via hydroxypyruvate is not considered for the stoichiometric equation
  of the glycerate route. Abbreviations: EG, ethylene glycol; GA, glycolaldehyde;
  2 PG, 2-phospho-d-glycerate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
