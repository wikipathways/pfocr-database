caption: Dmp1 links the Rb and p53 pathways. The novel ‘Jun-Dmp1’ pathway links oncogenic
  Ras-Raf signaling and the Arf-p53 pathway. This pathway is independent of the classical
  cyclin D1/Cdk4-Rb-E2F signaling. E2Fs directly bind to the Dmp1 promoter and causes
  repression; thus they have differential effects on the Dmp1 and on the Arf promoter.
  Overexpression of D-cyclins inhibits the activity of Dmp1 in a Cdk-independent fashion;
  however, on the Arf promoter, Dmp1 and cyclin D1 act synergistically, and this activity
  is dependent on Cdks. Dmp1 might have other targets than Arf, especially in T lymphocytes.
