caption: Virus infection and replication produces replication products, such as dsRNA,
  that are recognized and bound by RIG-I. This drives a conformation change in RIG-I
  that promotes its interaction with IPS-1 anchored on the mitochondria outer membrane
  and results in recruitment and activation of signaling factors that activate IRF-3
  and NF-κB. Transcription factor translocation to the nucleus results in induction
  of α/β IFN expression and secretion from the infected cell. α/β IFN binding to the
  IFN receptor triggers activation of receptor bound protein kinases and downstream
  Jak-Stat pathway signaling of ISG expression. The HCV NS3/4A protease cleaves IPS-1
  off of the mitochondria outer membrane to ablate α/β IFN expression, while WNV disrupts
  Jak-Stat signaling processes of the α/β IFN receptor to attenuate IFN actions. P
  and Ubq respectively denote protein modification by phosphorylation and ubiquitination
  events triggered during innate immune signaling.

  description: Virus infection and replication produces replication products, such
    as dsRNA, that are recognized and bound by RIG-I. This drives a conformation change
    in RIG-I that promotes its interaction with IPS-1 anchored on the mitochondria
    outer membrane and results in recruitment and activation of signaling factors
    that activate IRF-3 and NF-κB. Transcription factor translocation to the nucleus
    results in induction of α/β IFN expression and secretion from the infected cell.
    α/β IFN binding to the IFN receptor triggers activation of receptor bound protein
    kinases and downstream Jak-Stat pathway signaling of ISG expression. The HCV NS3/4A
    protease cleaves IPS-1 off of the mitochondria outer membrane to ablate α/β IFN
    expression, while WNV disrupts Jak-Stat signaling processes of the α/β IFN receptor
    to attenuate IFN actions. P and Ubq respectively denote protein modification by
