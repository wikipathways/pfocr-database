caption: 'Targeting the Hedgehog pathway. Inhibition of the HH pathway by direct SMO
  and GLI inhibitors (red boxes) and by small molecules or drugs targeting protein
  kinases. Indicated are protein kinases that act as negative regulators (red) and
  positive regulators (green) of the GLI. For each protein kinase agonists and antagonists
  are reported. For details regarding the inhibitors and their target or mechanism
  of action see . Abbreviations: SMO, Smoothened; PTCH, Patched; KIF7, kinesin family
  member 7; HH, Hedgehog; GLI1/2A, GLI1/2 activators; CK1α, casein kinase 1α; CK2,
  casein kinase 2; PKA, protein kinase A; S6K1, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; DYRK1B, dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated
  kinase 1B; aPKCι/λ, atypical protein kinase ι/λ; BRD4, bromodomain-containing protein
  4.'
