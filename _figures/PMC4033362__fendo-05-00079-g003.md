caption: 'The IGF-I receptor signaling pathways during normoglycemia: (A) stimulation
  of the IGF-I receptor leads to phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)
  that couples IGF-I receptor stimulation to downstream activation of the PI-3-kinase
  (“metabolic”) signaling pathway. (B) IGF-I receptor signaling pathways during hyperglycemia:
  stimulation of the IGF-I receptor leads not phosphorylation of IRS-1. Instead of
  this, IGF-IR linked signaling occurs via its ability to phosphorylate SHPS-1, which
  results in assembly of a SHPS-1 signaling complex which leads to stimulation of
  both the PI-3 kinase (“metabolic”) signaling pathway and MAP kinase (“mitogenic”)
  signaling pathway [Figure modified from Clemmons et al. (); see also text].'
