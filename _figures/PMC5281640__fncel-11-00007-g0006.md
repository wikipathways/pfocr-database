caption: Scheme summarizing the results. Microglia activation by prolonged exposure
  of Aβ induced the accumulation of ROS and decreased SIRT3, MnSOD expression in NSCs,
  accompanied by cell cycle arrest, increased cell apoptosis and mPTP opening, and
  enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) depolarization. Furthermore, SIRT3
  knockdown in NSCs accelerated the cell injury, whereas SIRT3 overexpression protected
  NSCs against activated microglia-induced cellular dysfunction through mitochondrial
  apoptosis pathway, including decreased mPTP opening and cyclophilin D (CypD) expression,
  inhibition of mitochondrial Cyt C release to cytoplasm, declined Bax/Bcl-2 ratio
  and caspase-3/9 enzymatic activity.
