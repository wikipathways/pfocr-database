caption: 'Metabolic pathway of PC and TG synthesis. (Abbreviations: Metabolites: Cho,
  choline; CoASH, coenzyme A; DG, diacylglycerol; FFA, free fatty acid; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; PA, phosphatidic acid;
  PC, phosphatidylcholine; TG, triacylglycerol. Enzymes: CPT, choline phosphotransferase;
  DGAT, DG acyltransferase; FAD2, fatty acid desaturase 2; FAE1, fatty acid elongase
  1; GPAT, G3P acyltransferase; LPAT, LPA acyltransferase; LPCAT, LPC:PC acyltransferase;
  PAP, PA phosphatase; PDAT, phospholipid:DG acyltransferase; PDCT, PC:DG phosphocholine
  transferase; PLA, phospholipase A; PLD, phospholipase D.) PC (circled in pink) stands
  as a central metabolite in the synthesis of seed storage oil, a majority of which
  is TG (circled in yellow), but is also an intermediate for FA modification by desaturation,
  such as by FAD2. Another type of FA modification includes the elongation of FAs
  by FAE1 on acyl-CoA substrates. The possible routes of 13C-isotope incorporation
  (red) can occur on the glycerol backbone, from FA synthesis that occurs in the plastid
  of plant embryos, or from the elongation of FAs by FAE1 in the cytosol. Thick black
  lines represent FAs and/or FAs bound to glycerol, small purple circle represents
  phosphate, and light blue oval represents choline.'
