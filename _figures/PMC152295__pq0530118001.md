caption: 'The PI metabolic pathway and wortmannin sensitivity. It is known that PI
  is transported to the plasma membrane, where it is serially phosphorylated by Stt4p
  and Mss4p. Plc1p hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2 and generates two second messengers: IP3 and
  diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 triggers calcium release from intracellular stores and
  is successively converted to other soluble inositol polyphosphates that function
  in the nucleus. DAG remains in the plasma membrane to activate members of the protein
  kinase C family. Wortmannin-resistant deletions are labeled green, and wortmannin-hypersensitive
  deletions are labeled red. Dashed lines represent processes found only in mammalian
  cells.'
