caption: Role of miR-223 in the progression of NAFLD and ALD. During HFD, free fatty
  acids elevate miR-223 expression in neutrophils by regulating APOE/PU.1 signaling.
  MiR-223 directly targets NLRP3, CXCL2, IL-6 to ameliorate inflammatory responses.
  And miR-223 can also form a feedback loop to prevent NASH progression by promoting
  the preferential uptake of neutrophil-derived miR-223/APOE-enriched EVs in hepatocytes.
  IL-6 signaling promotes macrophages to release miR-223-enriched exosomes that inhibit
  expression of several miR-223-targeted genes in hepatocytes, thereby attenuating
  NASH-associated liver fibrosis. In addition, PPARγ/miR-223 axis control macrophage
  polarization and protects against diet-induced adipose tissue inflammatory response
  and systemic insulin resistance. PPARγ can enhance miR-223 expression by directly
  binding to pre-miR-223 promoter. MiR-223 is required for PPARγ-induced M2 macrophage
  polarization by controlling expression of the target genes Nfat5 and Rasa1. Moreover,
  miR-223 inhibits Pknox1 expression, thereby suppressing proinflammatory activation
  of M1 response. Ethanol elevates miR-223 levels. MiR-223 attenuates neutrophil function
  by inhibiting the IL-6–p47phox–ROS pathway, thereby protecting against ALD.
