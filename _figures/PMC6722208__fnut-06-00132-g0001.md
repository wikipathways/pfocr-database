caption: The circadian regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis illustrates an example
  of bi-directional regulation between clock genes and metabolism. The HPA axis is
  entrained to the light/dark cycle, and NAD+ availability is entrained to feeding
  rhythms. NAMPT facilitates NAD+ salvage pathway. NAD+ co-activates SIRT1, which
  then activates PGC-1α. PGC-1α activated FOXO1 is necessary for transcription of
  Pck1 and G6pc genes, along with the cortisol-receptor complex. Cortisol bound to
  its receptor entrains the clock genes to the light/dark cycle. In summary, the transcription
  of gluconeogenic genes (Pck1/G6pc) is regulated by cortisol-receptor complex, clocks,
  and FOXO1.
