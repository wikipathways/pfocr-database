caption: A schematic presentation of PI3K-Akt intracellular signaling. Different extracellular
  stimuli, e.g., growth factors mediate their effects by receptors belonging to receptor
  tyrosine kinase (RTK) family locating in the cell membrane. Binding of insulin to
  IR leads to activating tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS).
  This activates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) consisting
  of regulatory p85 and catalytic p110 subunits. PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3),
  which recruits Akt-kinase to cell membrane. PIP3 activates phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase 1 (PDK1) to phosphorylate threonine 308 site in Akt1. For the full
  activation of Akt, serine 473 phosphorylation by mammalian target for rapamycin
  complex 2 (mTORC2) is needed. PI3K-Akt pathway regulates several cellular functions
  via downstream factors; Akt substrate 160 kDa (AS160) controls insulin dependently
  on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the cell membrane and glucose
  uptake into the cell, mTORC1 regulates autophagy, protein synthesis, and cell growth,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) affects glycogen synthesis, axon growth, and tau
  phosphorylation, and forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors regulate many functions,
  such as cell survival. In microglia, cell surface receptor TREM2 signaling regulates
  the phagocytosis, motility, autophagy, survival, and proliferation. TREM2 is activated
  by several ligands including phospholipids, lipoproteins, and oligomeric Aβ leading
  to interaction with activating adaptor protein DAP12. This in turn, leads to activation
  of PI3K-Akt pathway.
