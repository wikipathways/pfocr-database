caption: A schematic representation of reactions induced by IL-17. The pathway reaction
  map depicts molecules involved in molecular associations, catalysis, and translocation
  events induced upon treatment with IL-17 ligand family. Site and residues of post-translational
  modifications are also mentioned, wherever available. Upon stimulation of IL-17,
  important signaling pathways including PI3K-AKT, Ras-MAPK, and NFκB are found to
  be activated
