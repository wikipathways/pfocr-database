caption: Infection by HPV and expression of HPV proteins E5, E6, and E7 can lead to
  immune suppression, evasion, and resistance. HPV E7 has been shown to downregulate
  the cGAS STING pathway, an important innate response pathway to viral DNA that induces
  the expression of type I IFN genes, by directly inhibiting STING (left). HPV E6
  can also dampen type I IFN gene expression by inhibiting the IFN regulatory factor
  IRF3. HPV E5 inhibits transport of MHC to the cell surface, which may be bound to
  either viral or tumor antigens, by alkalization of late endosomes. Finally, overexpression
  of E7 in a preclinical cervical cancer model has been shown to upregulate the PD-L1
  immune checkpoint.
