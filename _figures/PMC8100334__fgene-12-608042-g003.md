caption: Illustration for the definition of Weighted Information Gain (WIG) using
  a toy example. (A) A toy network containing four S-genes with their corresponding
  E-gene attachment. Note that the hierarchies of S1 and S2 genes cannot be distinguished.
  (B) Posterior effect positions obtained after network inference; (C) Uniformly distributed
  effect positions before inference. Suppose that the attached E-genes to a S-gene
  are all signature genes related to a pathway of interest (e.g., EMT), it could be
  easily calculated that S4 has the highest causal impact on the particular downstream
  pathway, and S1 and S2 have the same impact. As an example, we illustrated the calculation
  of WIG(S3).
