caption: Activation signals for effector and regulatory T-cell division and proliferation.
  (A) Signals required for activation of antigen-specific T cells. Interaction of
  the T-cell receptor (TCR) with antigen presented in the context of MHC molecules
  sends the first signal for T-cell activation. MHCI/peptide complexes were recognized
  by the CD8 TCR and MHCII/peptide complexes by CD4 TCR. Costimulation provides the
  second signal to promote T-cell activation and IL2 production. IL2 in turn binds
  to IL2-receptor (IL2R) and induces T-cell proliferation. (B) Differential activation
  pathways used for proliferation of effector (Teff) and regulatory T (Treg) cells.
  For Teff cells, IL2R stimulation promotes preferentially the activation of the P13K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway, which is sensitive to the effects of rapamycin. In contrast, for Treg cells,
  IL2R stimulation induces preferentially the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway due to high expression of PTEN, which blocks the P13K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
  The JAK/STAT/PIM-2 pathway is insensitive to rapamycin. Thus, administration of
  rapamycin suppresses the proliferation of Teff cells while allowing expansion of
  Treg cells.

    (Treg) cells. For Teff cells, IL2R stimulation promotes preferentially the activation
    of the P13K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is sensitive to the effects of rapamycin.
    In contrast, for Treg cells, IL2R stimulation induces preferentially the activation
