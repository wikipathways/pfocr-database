caption: PLK4 activity decreases in a dose-dependent manner upon centrinone B addition.
  TRIM37 promotes PLK4 auto-phosphorylation (orange circles) outside the phosphodegron
  region (purple circles). PLK4 inhibition initially results in TRIM37-independent
  growth arrest. Continued addition of centrinone B results in centrosome overduplication
  that is detected by the ANKRD26/PIDDosome pathway in addition to a TRIM37-dependent
  growth arrest pathway. Complete inhibition of PLK4 results in TRIM37-dependent growth
  arrest. TRIM37 also prevents the appearance of CNTROB-dependent aggregates. We hypothesize
  that these aggregates might affect p53/p21 activation (dotted lines) (created with
  https://biorender.com/).
