caption: 'Pathways showing systemic immune dyshomeostasis and the effect of inflammatory
  trigger insults on cholinergic signaling in AD: the figure shows crosstalk among
  “trigger insults/inflammatory stimulus” i.e., polymicrobial infection, chronic stress,
  pro-inflammatory diet and cholinergic signaling to put forward the “Systemic Immune
  Dyshomeostasis” model as to connect the events leading to AD development and progression.
  All three trigger insults lead to altered cholinergic signaling pathway in brain,
  bone marrow, liver and gut by modulating: (a) one carbon (1C) metabolism; (b) bone
  marrow-derived monocytes and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs);
  (c) gut microbiome, hypothalamic pituitary axis; and (d) glucocorticoid regulation
  culminating in immune alteration and autoimmunity (e). The Violet shaded circles
  represent the “direct players,” the gray shaded circles represent the “indirect
  players” and the orange shaded circles represent the “pathological players” in AD
  pathogenesis cascade. *Infection, stress and inflammatory diet; Hcy, Homocysteine;
