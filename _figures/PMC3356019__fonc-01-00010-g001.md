caption: Emerging pharmacological strategies for CSCs targeting include self-renewal
  pathway antagonists and chemoresistance-reverting agents. Self-renewal-linked signals
  (left) such as Hedgehog, Notch, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways can be antagonized by
  molecular targeted agents including ligand-binding molecules, receptor antagonists,
  or agents inhibiting intracellular effectors. Chemosensitivity (right) could be
  restored by inhibiting MDR efflux pumps that extrude chemotherapeutic agents of
  natural origin, or by interfering with the DNA repair machinery that removes DNA-alkylating
  agent adducts. CSCs, cancer stem cells; GSKβ, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; APC,
  adenomatosis polyposis coli; TCF/LEF, T-cell transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding
  factor; DLL4, delta-like ligand 4; SMO, smoothened; PTCH1, patched; GLI, glioma-associated
  oncogene homolog; MDR, multidrug resistance.
