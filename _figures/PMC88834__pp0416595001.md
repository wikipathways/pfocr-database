caption: The Asp biosynthetic pathway and Lys degradation  pathway in plants. Plus
  (+) and minus (−) signs indicate the  stimulation and inhibition of enzyme activity.
  AK is feedback regulated  by Lys and Thr, dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) is
  feedback  regulated by Lys alone, HSDH is feedback regulated by Thr, and Lys can  activate
  LKR activity. SDH, Sacchropine dehydrogenase.
