caption: Potential mechanism of how Se deficiency impacts Se metabolism and contributes
  to cardiovascular diseases. Se acquired through the diet can go through the trans-selenation
  pathway and be directly converted to Sec, becoming hydrogen selenide. In cases of
  low Se, stress-responsive selenoprotein synthesis may be affected. Those selenoproteins
  with known function in the heart are shown above but it is still unknown how some
  of these proteins contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease in cases
  of Se deficiency. Decreased levels of Se may negatively impact redox regulation,
  thyroid hormone metabolism, and calcium flux while increasing atherogenesis and
  oxidative stress. This, in turn, may lead to several cardiovascular diseases, including
  heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and atherosclerosis. Red arrows
  indicate processes and proteins that are decreased while green arrows indicate processes
  that are increased during Se deficiency. Black arrows point to known relationships,
  and dashed gray lines indicate the relationships that have not been established
  yet in the heart. The “?” indicates mechanisms that have not been determined. Se,
