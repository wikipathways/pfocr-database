caption: 'Under optimal nutrient surplus of nutrients, the chaperone BiP remains associated
  to the luminal surface of ER with three UPR transducer proteins (ER stress sensors:
  IRE1, PERK, and ATF6), maintaining them inactive. Overnutrition and lipid excess
  (as well as other insults, such as hypoxia, radiation, oxidative stress, viral infections,
  etc.) lead to impairment of normal protein folding in the ER, resulting in accumulation
  of unfolded proteins. In this situation, BiP preferentially binds the misfolded
  proteins, liberating the ER stress sensors. Dimerization and auto-phosphorylation
  of IRE1 triggers its endoribonuclease activity to induce cleavage of XBP1 mRNA to
  its spliced form XBP1s, which upregulates genes encoding chaperones and genes encoding
  for proteosome machinery, controlling ER-associated degradation (ERAD). PERK is
  activated by homodimerization and auto-phosphorylation leading to phosphorylation
  eIF2α, which results in attenuation of general protein translation and increased
  transcription of ATF4, which will induce transcription of pro-apoptotic genes such
  as CHOP10. ATF6 released from BiP is translocated to Golgi complex where it is cleaved
  by S1P/S2P proteases, releasing the 50 KDa domain, that acts as a transcription
  factor of gene-encoding chaperones including BiP. The overall effect of these events
  is an adaptive program comprising four different sequential responses, depending
  on the grade and persistence of the stimulated ER stress cell: (1) a transcriptional
  and translational attenuation, which reduces synthesis of new proteins preventing
  further accumulation of misfolded proteins; (2) upregulation of genes encoding ER
  chaperones to increase protein folding in the ER and prevent aggregation of unfolded
  proteins; (3) if stimuli persists, proteosome machinery is increased by transcription
  induction of its genes improving ERAD; and (4) if all of its processes do not rescue
  the cell from the ER stress and if ER stress inducers persist, genes encoding cell
  death and apoptosis of the cell will be induced. ATF4 and 6: activating transcription
  factor 4 and 6; BiP: binding immunoglobulin protein, also known as GRP78, glucose
  regulated protein 78 KDa; CHOP10: C/EBP homologous protein, also known as DDIT3,
  DNA-damage inducible transcript 3; eIF2α: eukaryotic initiation factor 2α subunit;
  IRE1: inositol requiring enzyme 1; PERK: PKR-like ER kinase, also known as dsRNA-dependent
  protein kinase like ER kinase; S1P/S2P: site-1, site-2 proteases; XBP1: X-box binding
  protein 1; XBP1s: X-box binding protein 1, spliced.'
