caption: Fig. 3. Model proposed for the interference of geminivirus proteins with
  the retinoblastoma-related (RBR) pathway. The G1–S transition in plants is controlled,
  most probably, by a pathway dependent on the retinoblastoma-related (RBR) protein
  which associates with the E2F–DP heterodimeric transcription factor(s). In cycling
  cells, phosphorylation of RBR by a CDK–cyclin complex () is thought to release active
  E2F–DP complexes required to activate G1–S transition and S-phase progression. S-phase-specific
  gene expression also occurs through other mechanisms. Geminivirus RBR-binding proteins
  (RepA and Rep) would bypass this control by sequestering RBR from the ternary RBR–E2F–DP
  complex.
