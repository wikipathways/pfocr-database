caption: 'Mechanisms of Apoptosis and Necroptosis. Apoptosis can be triggered by two
  main pathways: the extrinsic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial
  pathway. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by external signals activating TNF receptors,
  which then stimulate caspases such as caspase-8 and caspase-10, leading to cell
  death. The intrinsic pathway, regulated by BCL-2 family proteins, involves mitochondrial
  permeability changes that release cytochrome C, forming an apoptosome that activates
  caspase-9. Both pathways converge to activate executioner caspases, leading to the
  cellular dismantling characteristic of apoptosis. Necroptosis generally commences
  with the activation of TNFR1 and its associated ligand, leading to a cascade of
  events involving RIPK1 and RIPK3, and culminating in the phosphorylation and activation
  of the MLKL pseudokinase. This activation results in MLKL translocating to the cell
  membrane, causing it to rupture and release pro-inflammatory mediators. There is
  an interconnection between these two types of programmed cell death'
