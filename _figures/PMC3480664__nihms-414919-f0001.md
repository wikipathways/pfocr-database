caption: Neurotrophin Regulation of Energy Balance in the Adult CNS and PNS. This
  diagram summarizes the effects of peripherally administered CNTF (Axokine), and
  centrally as well as peripherally administered BDNF (black arrows), on adult CNS
  and sympathetic circuits that control energy intake and expenditure. Administration
  of BDNF or BDNF-transducing viruses to the PVN and other hypothalamic regions increases
  sympathetic outflow pathway activity, resulting in increased energy expenditure
  and decreased feeding, as discussed in this mini-review. CRH pathways (white arrow)
  integrate these BDNF signals with those from the HPA axis to modulate energy balance.
  Circulating CNTF has been shown to directly effect peripheral metabolic activity,
  and in the CNS, to regulate the neurogenesis of critical leptin-responsive, POMC-
  and NPY/AgRP-containing neurons in hypothalamic circuits that regulate feeding and
  energy homeostasis.
