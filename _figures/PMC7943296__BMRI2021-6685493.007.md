caption: Schematic figure of Y15 inhibiting oxidative damage via the FAK-Akt signaling
  pathway. In oxidative damage models established by coculturing CVC segments with
  scratched EA.hy926 cells or inserting and retaining CVC in the vein of rabbits,
  overproduction of ROS and activation of FAK-Akt signaling triggered the changes
  in levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress (NO, MDA, and SOD), which resulted in
  cell injury or vein injury. Y15 alleviated the oxidative damage through inhibition
  of FAK-Akt pathway activation.
