caption: The scheme illustrates the mechanism by which SFK modulates the interaction
  between WNK4 and SGK1 during volume depletion (A) and during high K intake (B).
  The dotted line and solid line represent an enhanced and a diminished signaling
  pathway, respectively. Gray font means inhibition. The plus and minus signs represent
  stimulation and inhibition, respectively. PP1, type 1 serine/threonine protein phosphatase;
  PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase; ROMK, renal outer medullary K channel (Kir1.1);
  SFK, Src-family tyrosine kinase; SGK1, serum/glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase
