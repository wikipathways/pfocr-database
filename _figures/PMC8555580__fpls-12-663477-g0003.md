caption: Schematic representation of the cross-talk between Pi and Zn nutrients and
  the potential linkers involved in the interaction between Pi and Zn nutrient homeostasis
  in plants. (A) the potential Pi- and Zn-deficient cis-regulatory elements present
  in the promoter regions of PHT1 family and ZIP family genes from plants. P1BS-motif
  (GNATATNC), which is the target site of PHR1 in plants, was screened in the promoter
  region of plant PHT1 and ZIP genes by DNA-pattern-matching analysis (http://rsat.ulb.
  ac.be/rsat/). The GNATATNC motif is found in the promoter region of AtZIP2 (in Arabidopsis
  thaliana), GmZIP2 (in Glycine max), AsZIP2 (in Astragalus sinicus), MtZIP2 (in Medicago
  truncatula), and LjZIP2 (in Lotus japonicus), while the promoter sequences of AtPT1
  (in Arabidopsis thaliana), HvPT2 (in Hordeum vulgare), LePT3 (in Solanum lycopersicum),
  and LjPT5 (in Lotus japonicus) further contain the ZDRE motif (RTGTCGACAY), which
  is activated by the bZIP19/23 transcription factors during Zn deficiency. (B) Under
  Pi deficiency, the PHT1 and PHO1 genes are activated to be essential for Pi uptake
  and accumulation in plants through the Pi regulatory-signaling pathway (PHR1-miR399-PHO2);
  moreover, the ZIP2 subfamily genes, belonging to the plant ZIP gene family, are
  transcriptionally induced via the activated PHR1 transcription factor binding to
  the P1BS (GNATATNC) sequences found in the promoter regions of their genes (see
  A). On the other hand, Zn deficiency activates the bZIP19/23 transcription factors,
  and bZIP19/23-mediated Zn regulatory pathway induces the ZIP gene family transporters
  to promote Zn uptake and homeostasis. On the other hand, LPCAT1 (Lyso-PhosphatidylCholine
  AcylTransferase 1), PHT1;1, and PHO1;H3 are transcriptionally upregulated in a bZIP19/23-dependent
  manner during Zn deficiency. The black arrows and flat-ended lines refer to the
  positive and negative interactions, respectively. The red and blue arrows represent
  the increased and decreased element contents; accordingly, the red and blue modules
  indicate the activated and inhibited processes in plants.
