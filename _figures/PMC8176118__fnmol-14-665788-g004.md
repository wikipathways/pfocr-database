caption: CircRNA-ceRNA network analysis in hippocampal tissue of APP/PS1 Mice. The
  ceRNA networks were based on circRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA interactions. Circle nodes
  represent circRNAs, triangle nodes represent miRNAs, and rectangle nodes represent
  mRNAs. Red represent upregulated, green represent downregulated. (A) circRNA (down
  in APP/PS1 mice)-miRNA (up in APP/PS1 mice)-mRNA (down in APP/PS1 mice). (B) circRNA
  (up in APP/PS1 mice)-miRNA (down in APP/PS1 mice)-mRNA (up in APP/PS1 mice).
