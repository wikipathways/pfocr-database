caption: Schematic illustration of PDK1 regulates regulatory T cell survival via controlling
  redox homeostasis. In Treg cells, TCR stimulates PI3K-PDK1-mTOR signaling pathway
  to maintain the homeostasis and function of Treg cells. Meanwhile, activated PDK1
  inhibited the MAPK signaling pathway and maintained the balance of intracellular
  iron ions. When PDK1 was deleted, the MAPK signaling activity in Treg cells increased,
  which promoted the up-regulation of the expression of iron transporter CD71, leading
  to the increase of iron ions in Treg cells, resulting in the production of excessive
  lipid ROS and the death of Treg cells. In addition, PDK1 also promotes the activation
  of mTORC1 signaling, which is critical for maintaining Treg cell proliferation and
  the suppressive molecules expression.
