caption: Modulation of dendritic cells by M leprae. Monocytes can differentiate to
  dendritic cells via an IL‐4/GM‐CSF and IL‐32–independent pathway. DCs present antigens
  via MHC class II to CD4 T‐cells and via MHC class I to CD8 T‐cells. M leprae/PGL‐I
  downregulates the expression of MHC molecules, resulting in less T‐cell priming.
  MMP‐II, another cell‐wall antigen of M leprae, induces the production of IFN‐γ by
  CD4 and CD8 T‐cells via DCs. The production of IL‐12 by DCs stimulates the production
  of IFN‐γ by T‐cells; in lepromatous patients, the IL‐12 production in response to
  M leprae is weak. IL‐10 produced by monocytes in response to M leprae inhibits IL‐32,
  blocking the differentiation to DCs, resulting in less IL‐12. In the absence of
  IL‐10, IL‐32 is upregulated in monocytes upon the recognition of muramyl dipeptides
  (MDP) from M. leprae via NOD2. Langerhans cells (LCs) reside in the skin or mucosa
  and uniquely express langerin (CD207). IFN‐γ treatment of M leprae–infected Langerhans
  cells induces autophagy and increases the production of cathelicidin, required to
  activate the antimicrobial activity in these cells. The increased autophagy in LCs
  enables the degradation of M leprae, releasing antigens for the presentation to
  resident T cells
