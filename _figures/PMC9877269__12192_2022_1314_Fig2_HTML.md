caption: Interactions of vital metabolic pathways that lead to insulin resistance
  in nutri-stress. Nutrient excess due to external lifestyle factors leads to metabolic
  inflexibility and dysregulation of the bioenergetic chemical signals, i.e. NAD/NADH
  ratio and AMP/ATP ratio. The onset of oxidative stress occurring parallel to excess
  oxidation in mitochondria, along with the decreased NAD and increased ATP, jointly
  involves in the dysregulation of the heat shock response. The blue-coloured portions
  represent the canonical HSP expression pathway; the grey-coloured represents the
  oxidative stress-associated pro-inflammatory NF-kB pathway and their interactions
  with the insulin signalling cascade (green portion) and HSP pathway. GSK-3beta is
  also included for its role in oxidative stress and HSP repression
