caption: Steps of the type I secretion pathway. The model shown focuses on the functions
  of different regions of HasA in the assembly dynamics of the tripartite TolC-HasD-HasE
  system. (Step 1) Outer membrane (OM) TolC is recruited to HasDE only when HasA interacts
  with the ABC protein HasD (IM, inner membrane). These primary interactions between
  HasD and newly synthesized HasA are driven by linear sites which are sequentially
  exposed on the unfolded molecules during or soon after protein translation. (Step
  2) The secondary interaction between HasD and HasA via C-terminal signaling induces
  ATP hydrolysis and separation of TolC to its preengagement state.
