caption: 'Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in the yellow peel and red flesh of papaya.
  a, Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in the sample of PE2 versus PE1 (PE1-vs-PE2).
  b, Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in the sample of FL2 versus FL1 (FL1-vs-FL2).
  Genes examined are in red or blue italic bold letters: genes with red or blue color
  means they are up- or down-regulated during papaya fruit ripening respectively.
  The carotenoids in rectangular boxes were determined in the study. The red-frame
  boxes refer to the content of carotenoid is increasing during papaya fruit ripening
  and the blue-frame boxes refer to the content of carotenoid is decreasing. (The
  diagram is modified from Naik et al. [])'
