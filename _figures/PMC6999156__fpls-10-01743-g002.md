caption: Signaling role of glutamate (Glu) in plant growth, development, and response
  to environmental stress. Extracellular Glu can exert its signaling role by glutamate
  receptor-like proteins (GLRs)-mediated calcium (Ca2+) signaling in plants. For plant
  growth and development, GLRs-mediated Ca2+signaling triggered by Glu promotes seed
  germination by counteracting the effect of abscisic acid (ABA) and/or its receptor
  ABA-insensitive 4 (ABI4); constructs root architecture by crosstalk among reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPKs), and auxin; and regulates
  pollen germination and pollen tube growth. In addition, for response to environmental
  stress, GLRs-mediated Ca2+signaling triggers salt tolerance by activating salt overly
  sensitive (SOS) signaling pathway; induces heat tolerance; governs drought tolerance
  via interaction of ABA and nitric oxide (NO) to regulate stomata movement; improves
  cold tolerance by ROS-glutathione (GSH) cascade or interaction of jasmonate (JA)
  and C-repeat binding factor/dehydration responsive element binding (CBF/DREB) regulator
  pathway; responds to wound stress by JA; and initiates pathogen resistance by ROS-NO
  interaction. Also, extracellular Glu can import into cells and act as mediator (storage)
  to synthesize proteins, glutathione, glutamine, proline, gamma-aminobutyric acid
  (GABA), arginine, heme, chlorophyll, and other components, which in turn regulates
  plant growth, development, and response to environmental stress. The arrows (→)
  indicate facilitating effect, while the blunt lines (┬) represent inhibiting effect.
