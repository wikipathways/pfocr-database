caption: 'Spatiotemporal metabolism in the apple fruit. Fruit metabolite and transcript
  abundance data from fruit cortex and pith tissues during different stages of development
  were used to develop a representative model of fruit cell metabolism. Space outside
  of the cell boundary is represented as the apoplastic space (includes cell wall).
  EFD: early fruit development; MFD: mid fruit development; LFD: late fruit development.
  Enzyme nomenclature: CwINV: cell wall invertase; NINV: neutral invertase; VINV:
  vacuolar invertase; SDH: sorbitol dehydrogenase; SUSY: sucrose synthase; SPS: sucrose
  phosphate synthase; FK: fructokinase; HXK: hexokinase; ASPA: asparaginase; GS: glutamine
  synthetase; MDH: malate dehydrogenase; PEPC: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. PP
  metabolism indicates the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway. Metabolite nomenclature:
  Sor: sorbitol; Suc: sucrose; Fru: fructose; Glc: glucose; F6P: fructose-6-phosphate;
  G6P: glucose-6-phosphate; G1P: glucose-1-phosphate; UDPG: uridine diphosphate-glucose;
  NDP-sugars: nucleoside diphosphate-sugars; PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate; OAA: oxaloacetic
  acid; Asn: asparagine; Gln: glutamine; Asp; aspartate; α-KG: α-keto glutarate. Bold
  arrows indicate higher flux; narrow arrows indicate medium flux and dashed lines
  indicate reduced flux'
