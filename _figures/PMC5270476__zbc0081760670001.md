caption: Reelin's role in stabilizing the cytoskeleton. Reelin signaling participates
  in axonal and dendritic outgrowth and maturation by stabilizing the cytoskeleton.
  A and B, microtubule stability is promoted by Reelin through VLDLR-dependent activation
  of Lis1 (reviewed in Refs. , , and ) (A) and inhibition of GSK-3β (reviewed in Ref.
  ) through activation of the Dab1/PI3K/Akt pathway, which also activates an mTOR-dependent
  process that promotes the outgrowth and stabilization of dendrites (reviewed in
  Refs. , , and ) (B). C, Reelin promotes actin stability through the ApoER2/Dab1/PI3K
  pathway by inducing LIMK1-dependent inactivation of cofilin (reviewed in Ref. ).
  D, this ApoER2/Dab1/PI3K pathway can also mediate the formation of axons by activating
  the RhoGTPase Cdc42 (). E, independent of PI3K, Reelin stabilizes actin by triggering
  C3G activation of Rap1 through Crk family proteins (Crk), which is essential for
  normal neocortical lamination and postnatal hippocampal dendritogenesis (, ).
