caption: 'Hypothetical pathways leading to SHBG expression and their modulation in
  the heart. A hypothetical intracellular pathway for SHBG expression in the cardiomyocytes.
  The same membrane receptors modulating SHBG expression in the liver could be expressed
  in the heart. Metabolic cues modulate the activity of the transcription factor hepatocyte
  nuclear factor 4-α (HNF4α), which leads to an increase in SHBG gene expression.
  The following are some of the questions that arise relating to the possible production
  and secretion of SHBG as an endocrine or paracrine mediator: (1) Can TNFα, IL-1β,
  and adiponectin modulate SHBG expression in cardiac tissue? (2) Is the heart involved
  in the release of soluble SHBG in a paracrine or endocrine way? (3) Can soluble
  SHBG trigger intracellular signaling pathways in the heart?'
