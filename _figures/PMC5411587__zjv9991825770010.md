caption: Schematic model for MeV entry into MCF7 cancer cells. Once MeV binds to PVRL4
  (), the Rac1/PAK1-dependent signaling pathway is activated (), which triggers vigorous
  actin-mediated membrane protrusions (). This is followed by MeV endocytosis ().
  Various inhibitors of the macropinocytosis pathway and their sites of action are
  shown in red.
