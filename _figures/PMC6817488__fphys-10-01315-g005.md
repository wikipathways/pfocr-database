caption: Mechanisms of AA-induced vasorelaxation and relationship to aldehyde metabolism.
  (A) Cartoon showing mechanisms by which AA induces relaxation in SMA pre-contracted
  with phenylephrine (PE), thromboxane A2 analog (U46,619), and high potassium solution
  (High K+). AA stimulates a sensitive endothelial cell-dependent pathway that leads
  to eNOS activation, NO formation, and GC dependence triggering VSMC hyperpolarization
  and relaxation (Pathway is designated “1”). Several steps were confirmed by antagonizing
  endothelium (impaired by air perfusion), NOS (L-NAME), and GC (ODQ). A less sensitive,
  yet equally efficacious, pathway of relaxation included a voltage-insensitive mechanism
  that similarly reversed U46,619- and High K+-induced contraction implicating closure
  of VSMC Ca2+ channels (Pathway “2”). (B) Cartoon highlighting the metabolic pathways
  of ethanol, AA, and acetate. Ethanol is oxidized to AA by alcohol dehydrogenases
  (ADH) and/or catalase activity. AA is oxidized to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenases
  (ALDH/ALDH2) or reduced back to EtOH by aldose reductase (AR). Acetate may be converted
  to acetyl coenzyme A (CoA).
