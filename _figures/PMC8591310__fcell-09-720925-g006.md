caption: Schematic overview of the mechanisms whereby METTL3 controls PI3K/AKT signaling
  activity in the context of DO-related EPC angiogenesis. During DO-related tissue
  regeneration, the DO gap is a hypoxic environment. Upon upregulation, METTL3 can
  target VEGF to gradually increase and positively regulate PI3K activity and AKT
  phosphorylation, with such PI3K/AKT signaling partially strengthening the expression
  of VEGF, ultimately promoting EPC proliferation, migration, and tube formation during
  DO and thereby facilitating osteogenesis.
