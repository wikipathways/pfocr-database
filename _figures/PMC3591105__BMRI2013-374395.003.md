caption: Models of actin cytoskeleton manipulation by enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC)
  and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC). EAEC secrete to the serine protease autotransporte
  of Enterobacteriaceae known as Plasmid-encoded toxin (Pet). Pet enters the eukaryotic
  cell and that trafficking through the vesicular system is required for the induction
  of cytopathic effects. Thus, after clathrin-mediated endocytosis, Pet undergoes
  a retrograde trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum to
  be translocated into the cytosol. Where, Pet reaches one of its intracellular target,
  α-fodrin (αII spectrin). Pet cleaves epithelial fodrin (between M1198 and V1199
  residues), causing fodrin redistribution within the cells; fodrin is a structural
  link between the plasma membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton. On the other
  hand, Afa/Dr DAEC interact with membrane-bound receptors including the recognition
  of DAF by Afa/Dr adhesins and of CEACAMs. This receptor recognition develops loss
  of microvilli, which results from a signaling pathway involving protein tyrosine
  kinase (PKT), phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PLCγ), protein kinase
  C (PKC), and an increase in [Ca2+]i. These events control the rearrangements of
  brush border-associated F-actin and villin cytoskeletal proteins. The elongation
  of the microvilli also involves the activation of Rho GTPase Cdc42. Secreted autotransporter
  toxin (Sat) plays an important role in the increased paracellular permeability,
  which is associated with the reorganization of TJ-associated proteins, ZO-1 and
  occludin, but does not affect the TER. Internalization occurs in non-polarized epithelial
  cells via a mechanism involving lipid rafts and dynamic microtubules. Internalized
  Afa/Dr DAEC bacteria survive within a large, late vacuole (for full details, see
  main text).

  description: Models of actin cytoskeleton manipulation by enteroaggregative E. coli
