caption: The RNA helicase RNA sensor DHX15 sense enteric RNA viruses to trigger type
  III IFN signaling pathway. Infection by enteric RNA viruses, including rotavirus,
  reovirus and norovirus, releases dsRNA in the cytoplasm. The RNA helicase RNA sensor
  DHX15 in the cytoplasm recognizes the RNA molecules and trigger the activation of
  downstream cascades through their adaptors leading to the induction of type III
  IFN in IECs of the intestinal tract
