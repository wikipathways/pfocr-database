caption: '(a) Regulation of FAS and mFAO by AMPK at normal or high ATP/ADP ratio.
  In this case, AMPK is in inactive state, ACC1 and ACC2 are active, and the accumulated
  malonyl-CoA inhibits the β-oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria by suppressing
  CPT1 and CPT2 activity. (b) Regulation of FAS and mFAO by AMPK at low ATP/ADP ratio.
  In this case, AMPK is in an active state (AMPK-P), ACC1 and ACC2 are deactivated,
  malonyl-CoA is removed by activated MCD, which eliminates the inhibition of CPT1
  and CPT2 and activates the β-oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria. The green
  arrows indicated the expressed pathway. The gray arrows indicate the suppressed
  pathway. The red blunt ends indicate the inhibition of a particular enzyme. The
  red arrows indicated the activation of a particular enzyme. ACC1 and ACC2: acetyl-CoA
  carboxylases 1 and 2; ACLY: ATP citrate lyase; AMPK: 5′AMP-activated protein kinase
  (dephosphorylated state); CIC: mitochondrial citrate carrier; CTP1 and CTP2: carnitine
  palmitoyl transferases 1 and 2; F6P: fructose-6-phosphate/fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  G6P: glucose-6-phosphate; GAP: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; a-KG: a-ketoglutarate;
  MCD: malonyl-CoA decarboxylase; MPC: mitochondrial pyruvate carrier; OAA: oxaloacetate;
  PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; PC: pyruvate carboxylase; PFK1: phosphofructokinase-1;
