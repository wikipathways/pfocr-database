caption: 263 human gene orthologs were regulated in the same direction in the nephritic
  vs. prenephritic kidneys in NZB/W, NZM2410 and NZW/BXSB. The picture shows the 204
  genes that were co-cited in PubMed abstracts in the same sentence. Orange represents
  the genes that are upregulated and green represents the genes that are downregulated
  in nephritic compared to prenephritic mice.
