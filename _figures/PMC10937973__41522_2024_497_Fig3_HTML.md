caption: A The influence of capsules on bacterial adherence. (a) Capsules promote
  or inhibits the formation of bacterial biofilm. (b) The addition of exogenous CPS
  changes the physical properties of the surface of non-biological materials, make
  them carry high negative charge and inhibit the adhesion of bacteria. B Interfering
  with host immune responses. (a) S. pneumoniae masks body surface antigens through
  capsule to avoid phagocytosis by macrophages. (b) F.tularensis inhibits the metabolic
  transformation of phagocytes through the synthesis of capsules, and finally inhibits
  the secretion of cytokines. C Assisting bacterial BBB penetration. Bacteria break
  through the blood-brain barrier by stimulating actin cytoskeleton rearrangement
  and various signal transduction pathways, including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K) and cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). But at present, the effect on capsules
  is only phenotypic. D The impact of capsules on antibiotic resistance. (a) A. baumanii
  regulates the expression of K locus gene through the BfmRS TCS, which further promotes
  the synthesis of CPS and resists the killing of antibiotics, but the mechanism of
  CPS is still unknown. (b) Exogenous CPS adsorbs antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and
  polymyxin, thus promoting the survival of bacteria. (c) The CPS located on the surface
  of bacteria adhere to polymyxin, which promotes the cleavage of polymyxin to the
  bacterial cell wall and finally promotes the death of bacteria. Positive regulation
  is indicated by red arrow, and negative regulation by blue arrow
