caption: Proposed working model for the role of WRKY53 in BR signaling and MAPK pathway.
  WRKY53 is the common substrate of GSK2 and MAPK6, but functions to different degrees
  in BR- and MAPK-regulated seed size control and leaf angle. A, For leaf angle control,
  WRKY53 is major target of both BR and MAPK signaling, and WRKY53 cooperate with
  BZR1. B, For seed size control, GSK2 and WRKY53 mainly regulate cell expansion and
  minorly regulate cell proliferation, while MAPK6 predominantly regulates cell proliferation
  and mildly regulates cell expansion, implying that WRKY53 plays a major role in
  BR-regulated seed size control, and a minor role in MAPK-regulated seed size control.
