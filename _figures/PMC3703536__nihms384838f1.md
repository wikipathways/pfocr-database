caption: The Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-family members
  share several signalling components, including the adaptor MyD88, Toll-interacting
  protein (TOLLIP), the protein kinase IRAK (IL-1R-associated kinase) and TRAF6 (TNF
  receptor-associated factor 6). TRAF6 can activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) through
  TAK1 (TGF-β-activated kinase), and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAP kinases
  through MKK6 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6). TLR4 signals through another
  adaptor in addition to MyD88–TIRAP (Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor domain-containing
  adaptor protein), which activates MyD88-independent signalling downstream of TLR4.
  The protein kinase PKR functions downstream of TIRAP, but its importance in this
  pathway has not yet been established. Image is reproduced, with permission, from
