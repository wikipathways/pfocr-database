caption: 'Proposed metabolic pathway for the biodegradation of pyrene and phenanthrene
  in Mycobacterium species. Steps 1 to 6 are specific to the degradation of pyrene
  (), and steps 7 to 15 represent the o-phthalate pathway of phenanthrene degradation,
  with steps 9 to 15 being common to the degradation pathways of the two PAHs. The
  genes encoding the enzymes of the phenanthrene degradation pathway, which have been
  identified in Nocardiodes sp. strain KP7 (, , ), are shown in italics. The enzyme
  activities thought to be involved in the catalysis of each step shown are as follows:
  (1) ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase; (2) dihydrodiol dehydrogenase; (3) intradiol
  dioxygenase; (4) decarboxylase; (5) ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase; (6) dehydrogenase-decarboxylase;
  (7) ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase; (8) dihydrodiol dehydrogenase; (9) extradiol
  dioxygenase; (10) isomerase; (11) hydratase-aldolase; (12) aldehyde dehydrogenase;
  (13) ring-cleaving dioxygenase; (14) hydratase-aldolase; (15) aldehyde dehydrogenase.'
