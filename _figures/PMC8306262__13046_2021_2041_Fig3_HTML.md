caption: The mevalonate pathway and its transcriptional regulation. The mevalonate
  pathway begins with the end-product of glycolysis, acetyl-CoA, which is metabolized
  through several enzymatic steps to mevalonate, IPP, GPP, FPP, GGPP and cholesterol.
  Both FPP and GGPP can be post-translationally added to proteins, especially small
  monomeric GTPases (such as Ras, Rho, or Rac). Cholesterol is produced by cells via
  the mevalonate pathway or LDLR-mediated LDL endocytosis from the serum. When intracellular
  cholesterol levels are low, SCAP mediates the translocation of SREBP2 to the Golgi
  apparatus, where it is cleaved by proteases. The active N-terminal fragment is released
  and translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to the SRE regions of the HMGCR
  and LDLR promoters to induce gene expression. The inhibitory feedback mechanism
  mediated by cholesterol is indicated in blue. The mevalonate pathway can be blocked
  by statins
