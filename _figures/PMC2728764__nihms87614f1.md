caption: Highly dissociated biosynthetic pathway of andrimid. The early biosynthetic
  steps are emphasized. The polyunsaturated acyl chain is installed onto the phosphopantetheinyl
  (Ppant) arm of holo-AdmA (HS-AdmA) through the actions of a type II PKS. The resulting
  octatrienoyl-S-AdmA (blue) serves as substrate for the self-acylating transglutaminase
  homologue AdmF (yellow). (S)-β-Phe is synthesized from l-Phe by the MIO-containing
  aminomutase AdmH and is activated to the corresponding AMP-ester by the A domain
  AdmJ. AdmJ then installs (S)-β-Phe onto the Ppant arm of holo-AdmI (HS-AdmI), leading
  to the formation of (S)-β-Phe-S-AdmI (red). AdmF catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide
  bond between the octatrienoyl chain and the amine group of α-phenylalanine through
  the acylation of its active site cysteine (Cys90). The hybrid biosynthetic pathway
  proceeds through six T domains before final tailoring leads to the maturation of
  the final andrimid antibiotic.
