caption: A hypothetical diagram demonstrates working model of bladder dysfunction
  in Parkinson’s disease (PD). This figure was adopted from ref , and modified. Micturition
  reflex is controlled by spinobulbospinal pathways through PAG in midbrain and PMC
  in brainstem. This neural circuit is under control of higher centers including ACC
  and other cortex regions. A, under normal conditions tonic inhibition from ACC suppress
  micturition reflex. Tonic firing (+) of dopaminergic neurons in SN activates dopamine
  D1 receptors expressed on GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the striatum to induce
  tonic GABAergic inhibition (−) of the micturition reflex at the level of PAG. At
  the same time, D1 receptor stimulation suppresses the activity of adenosinergic
  neurons, which exert an excitatory effect on micturition via adenosine A2A receptors
  (+). B. In PD, dopaminergic neurons in the SN are lost (lesion), leading to the
  loss of dopamine D1 receptors activation [D1 (loss of activation)], which results
  in reduced activation inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the striatum [GABA (loss of
  inhibition)]. At the same time, reduced D1 receptor stimulation enhances the adenosinergic
  mechanism to stimulate adenosine A2A receptors [Adenosine A2A (++)], leading to
  facilitation of the spinobulbospinal pathway controlling the micturition reflex
  pathway. Administration of dopamine D1 receptor agonist (SKF38393) can restore the
  GABAergic nerve activity and suppress A2A receptor-mediated activation to reduce
  bladder overactivity in PD. Also, administration of adenosine A2A antagonists (ZM241385
  or Istradefylline) can suppress A2A receptor-mediated activation of the micturition
  reflex to reduce bladder overactivity in PD. Dopamine D2 receptors [D2 (+)] expressed
  in the spinal cord enhances the micturition reflex. ACC, anterior cingulate cortex;
  GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid; PAG, periaqueductal gray; PMC, pontine micturition
  center; SN, substantia nigra pars compacta.
