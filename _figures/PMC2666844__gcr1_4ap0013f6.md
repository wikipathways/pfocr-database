caption: Simplified schematic diagram of transforming growth factor-alpha/epidermal
  growth factor receptor signaling pathway (TGF-α/EGFR). TGF-α binding to EGFR results
  in stimulation of the endogenous receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). The activated membrane-bound
  EGFR serves as a docking site for recruitment of proteins such as Src homology 2
  domain containing (Shc) and growth factor receptor-bound protein2 (Grb2). The signal
  then activates one of several intracellular signal transduction pathways including
  protein kinase A (PKA), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Jak/Stat, and C-src
  pathways, which play important roles in cell proliferation. New therapeutic agents
  such as erlotinib, cetuximab, and lapatinib aim to block this signaling cascade.
