caption: 'Chloroplast associated events modulating PCD: reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  generated through photosynthetic electron transport and chlorophyll biosynthetic
  pathway are involved in degradation of antenna core complex, simultaneously ROS
  activate chloroplastic executer 1 and 2 proteins that in- turn relay signal to the
  nucleus for the activation of transcription for cell death related genes. In a separate
  event, Cytochrome f released from electron transport chain induces caspase 3 like
  activity leading to cell death involving ubiquitin processing system. In another
  chloroplastic event cid and lrg protein located on chloroplast envelop membrane
  execute cell death process involving caspase like proteases. Bax inhibitor (BI)
  has been shown to interact with cid thus preventing downstream proteolytic activities
  and PCD process. Similarly binding of lrg to Cid prevents release of Cid showing
  its antiapoptotic function.'
