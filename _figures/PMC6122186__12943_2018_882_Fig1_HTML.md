caption: A simplified illustration of HIPPO signaling pathway. The Hippo signaling
  pathway is mainly comprised of MST1/2, Sav1, LATS1/2, Mob, YAP and/or its paralog
  TAZ. When the Hippo pathway is “ON”, MST1/2 phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2,
  which in turn phosphorylates YAP/TAZ and inhibits YAP/TAZ activity, leading to YAP/TAZ
  cytoplasmic retention and binding to 14–3-3 proteins or proteasomal degradation.
  When the Hippo signaling pathway is “OFF”, MSAT1/2 and LATS1/2 are inactivated,
  the transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ cannot be phosphorylated by LATS1/2 and
  freely translocate to nucleus and bind to TEAD transcription factors, promoting
  the expression of downstream target genes, such as CTGF and CYR61, which are involved
  in growth, proliferation, and survival
