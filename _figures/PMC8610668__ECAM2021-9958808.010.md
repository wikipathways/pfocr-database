caption: Graphical abstract. The ES was prepared using ethanol extraction and macroporous
  adsorption resin purification. The components of ES were identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS.
  The anti-inflammatory effect of ES was associated with the inhibition of IL-1β,
  IL-6, and TNF-α via negative regulation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in
  LPS-induced THP-1 cells.
