caption: Schematic of the known P. aeruginosa T3 regulation. Solid lines indicate
  direct connections (protein-protein interaction, direct binding to the promoter
  region, or compound synthesis), and dashed lines indicate indirect connections or
  hypothetical regulatory links. Host cell contact and Ca2+ depletion induce T3SS
  in two independent cascades, the activation of ExsE secretion via a T3SS to relieve
  ExsA from the antiactivator ExsD and the activation of CyaB, an adenylate cyclase,
  to increase cAMP levels in cells, which in turn activates the cAMP binding regulator
  Vfr. Besides these cascades, P. aeruginosa has other pathways to perceive unknown
  environmental signals. Upon contact with environmental stimuli, GacS phosphorylates
  GacA, which in turn activates the expression of small regulatory RNAs RsmY and RsmZ.
  The expression of exsA is induced by RsmA, a carbon storage regulator, which can
  be sequestered by those small regulatory RNAs. The GacA-PsrA regulatory pathway
  has been demonstrated in P. chlororaphis and likely exists in P. aeruginosa as well.
  A transcriptional regulator, PsrA, directly binds to the promoter region of the
  exsCEBA operon to activate exsA expression. Simultaneously, PsrA negatively regulates
  exsA expression through RpoS. In this study, we found that TS027 and TS103 alter
  the promoter activity of exoS (ExsA regulon) through GacSA-RsmYZ-RsmA-ExsA. TS103
  may induce exsA expression through PsrA-RpoS independently of GacSA.
