caption: FA, fatty acid; CoA, Coenzyme A; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1;
  CACT, carnitine acylcarnitine translocase; CPT2, carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  2; TCA, tricarboxylic acid. (A) Energy supply pathways of long-chain fatty acids
  in healthy people. Long-chain fatty acids are catalyzed by CPT1, CPT2, and CACT
  to produce acetyl-CoA, which is involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and acylcarnitine
  is the intermediate metabolite. (B) Energy supply pathway of long-chain fatty acids
  in patients with diabetic retinopathy. The green part shows the inhibition of free
  FAs transport of CPT1-mediated that resulted in the decrease of long-chain acylcarnitine.
