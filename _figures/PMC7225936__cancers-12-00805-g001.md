caption: Interaction between microbiome and microRNA. An alteration of microbiome
  is thought to affect the regulation of various miRNAs through the MyD88-dependent
  pathway. miRNA alteration is, in turn, associated with gut dysbiosis; however, its
  re-balance would re-establish gut microbiome. The alteration of microbiome and miRNAs
  brings to an altered production of oncogenes and/or tumour suppressor genes, in
  turn affecting cancer onset and prognosis.
