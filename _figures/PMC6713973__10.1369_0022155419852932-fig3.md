caption: 'Origins of myofibroblasts in renal fibrosis. Many renal cell types can differentiate
  into myofibroblasts during fibrosis in response to various stimuli, including fibroblasts,
  pericytes, fibrocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, and tubular cells. Abbreviations:
  TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; Hh/Gli, Hedgehog/GLI signaling pathway; CTGF,
  connective tissue growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; EndoMT, endothelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition; MMT, macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin.'
