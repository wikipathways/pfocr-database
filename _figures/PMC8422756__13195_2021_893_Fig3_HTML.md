caption: 'CSF differences in oxylipins and endocannabinoids, between control and AD
  groups. Fold changes projected on fatty acids, oxylipin, and endocannabinoid metabolic
  pathway. Only differences with the t-test p < 0.05 and FDR correction at q = 0.2
  are shown. The network presents fatty acid metabolic pathway, including saturates
  and monounsaturates (SFA and MUFA) and omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids with oxylipins
  and endocannabinoid synthesis pathway. For clarity purposes, only metabolites detected
  in CSF are shown. Oxylipin metabolizing enzymes are colored by their class: red—lipoxygenase
  (LOX) and autoxidation pathway; blue—cytochrome p450 (CYP) epoxygenase; green—cyclooxygenase
  (COX); yellow—N-acylphosphatidylethanolamide-phospholipase D. Node size represents
  the fold difference, and the color represents the directionality of the difference:
  orange—higher in AD; light blue—lower in AD. Key enzymes involved in the metabolic
  step are abbreviated next to the edge. Fads, fatty acid desaturase; Elov, fatty
  acid elongase; sEH, soluble epoxide hydrolase; DH, dehydrogenase. Saturated and
  monounsaturated fatty acids were not measured in this assay and are indicated only
  to visualize precursors for measured oxylipins and endocannabinoids. Group means
  for all metabolites together with corresponding t-test p-values are provided in
  Table'
