caption: Pathways involved in hyperglycemia-induced neuroinflammation. Increased glucose
  concentration in cells leads to amplified oxidative respiration and reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production. ROS react with NO to produce peroxynitrite. Increased
  glucose also leads to formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which
  act on RAGE to increase NF-κB activation. Activated NF-κB increases pro-inflammatory
  gene expression, including RAGE itself and cytokines. Increased leptin leads to
  mTOR and HIF-1 pathway activation, increasing vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) production. VEGF released from astrocytes activates protein kinase C (PKC)
  and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), which further promotes inflammation. Figure made
  with BioRender.
