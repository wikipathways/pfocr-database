caption: Metabolic pathways for γ-PGA production with xylose utilization. The isomerase
  pathway (blue) is natively present in Bacillus subtilis. The genes xylA and xylB
  encode the xylose isomerase and xylulokinase, respectively. These enzymes convert
  xylose to xylulose-5-phosphate, a pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) intermediate.
  The Weimberg pathway as present in Caulobacter crescentus (green) consists of five
  genes, xylA, xylB, xylC, xylD, and xylX. It is a linear pathway converting xylose
  to 2-oxoglutarate.
