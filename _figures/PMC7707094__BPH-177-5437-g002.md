caption: Schematic representation of the NO/cGMP signalling pathway. (a) The translocation
  of nNOS from the cytosol to the membrane, its physical interaction with the NR2B
  subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDA‐R) via PDZ domains (blue rectangles) involves
  the postsynaptic density 95 (PSD‐95) scaffolding protein and the assembly of a ternary
  complex nNOS/PSD‐95/NMDA receptor. Binding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor allows
  Ca+2 entry into the neuron. Ca+2 influx activates nNOS α through calmodulin (CaM)
  binding leading to the production of NO, which is formed enzymically from L‐arginine
  (L‐Arg) in equimolar amounts with L‐citrulline (L‐Cit). In parallel, membrane‐tethered
  nNOS is also subjected to posttranscriptional modifications (such as phosphorylation
  via Akt) that modulates its catalytic activity (Adak et al., ; Guerra et al., ; Rameau
  et al., ). (b) NO is a highly soluble and membrane permeable neurotransmitter. Upon
  binding to NO‐sensitive guanylate cyclase, NO induces a conformational change resulting
  in the activation of the enzyme and the subsequent conversion of GTP to cGMP. The
  newly produced cGMP can interact with various intracellular proteins, including
  cGMP‐binding PDE, cGMP‐gated cation channels (CNGs), and PKG, triggering the phosphorylation
  of many different substrates. The NO/cGMP pathway is thus implicated in multiple
  distinct physiological processes such as cytoskeletal organization, Ca2+ release
  from intracellular stores, and differentiation/proliferation of vascular smooth
  muscle
