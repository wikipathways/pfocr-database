caption: The cell model illustrates β2-adrenergic and insulin-mediated regulatory
  pathways for K+uptake. β2-Adrenergic and insulin both lead to K+ uptake by stimulating
  the activity of the Na+-K+-ATPase pump primarily in skeletal muscle, but they do
  so through different signaling pathways. β2-Adrenergic stimulation leads to increased
  pump activity through a cAMP- and protein kinase A (PKA)–dependent pathway. Insulin
  binding to its receptor leads to phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate
  protein (IRS-1), which, in turn, binds to phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K).
  The IRS-1–PI3-K interaction leads to activation of 3-phosphoinositide–dependent
  protein kinase-1 (PDK1). The stimulatory effect of insulin on glucose uptake and
  K+ uptake diverge at this point. An Akt-dependent pathway is responsible for membrane
  insertion of the glucose transporter GLUT4, whereas activation of atypical protein
  kinase C (aPKC) leads to membrane insertion of the Na+-K+-ATPase pump (reviewed
  in ref. ).
