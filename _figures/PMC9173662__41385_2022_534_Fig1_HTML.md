caption: 'The complement system is activated when its proteins encounter pathogens
  or damaged/infected self-cells and recognize a pattern on the surface of these cells.
  These events trigger the activation of complement through one of three pathways:
  the classical pathway (CP), the lectin pathway (LP) and the alternative pathway
  (AP). CP can be triggered by antigen-antibody (Ag-Ab) complexes, microbes, apoptotic
  cells, or short-chain pentraxins (e.g., C-reactive protein [CRP], serum amyloid
  P [SAP]) binding to the C1Q-C1R-C1S complex. This binding cleaves complement C4
  and C2 to their respective peptide fragments and leads to the formation of the CP
  C3 convertase, C4b2b, and the C5 convertase (C4b2bC3b). LP is activated by attachment
  of mannose-binding lectin to cell surface carbohydrates on the pathogen and pathogen
  associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). This results in the MASP1 and MASP2 serine
  proteases, associated with the lectin pattern recognition molecules (MBL, ficolin),
  facilitating C3 convertase (C4b2b) and C5 convertase (C4b2bC3b) formation by cleaving
  C4 and C2 to peptide fragments. AP is activated in response to cellular damage and
  mediated by spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 or stimulation of C3 by properdin (P/CFP).
  The hydrolyzed C3 then forms a complex with factor B (B/CFB) and factor D (D/CFD)
  to form the AP C3 convertase (C3bBb). The CP, LP and AP C3 convertases can cleave
  C3 into C3a (anaphylatoxin) and C3b (opsonin) peptide fragments. Two C3b molecules
  can further associate with the factor B peptide Bb to form the AP C5 convertase
  C3bBb3b. The C5 convertases cleave C5 into C5a (anaphylatoxin) and C5b peptide fragments.
  The C5b fragment forms a membrane attack complex (MAC) together with C6–C9 complement
  component proteins that insert into the pathogen cell membrane, forming a pore and
  leading to cell lysis. C3a and C5a mediate phagocytosis, chemotaxis of immune cells
  and immunomodulation by binding to their respective G-protein coupled transmembrane
  receptors (C3AR1, C5AR1, C5AR2). Complement regulators such as CD46, CD55, CD59b
  (all membrane-anchored), C1-INH, sMAP, MAP-1, factor H (CFH), factor I (CFI) and
  carboxypeptidases (CPN1, CPN2, CPB2) closely monitor and modulate the complement
  activation and propagation,,.'
