caption: Model for the signalling induced by salt stress and biotic stress (as induced
  by the Harpin elicitor) in grapevine. Csk, cytoskeleton; hrp, Harpin elicitor; hrpR,
  putative Harpin receptor; msc, putative mechanosensitive channel; ΔΨ, gradient in
  water potential between the apoplast and cytoplasm triggering salt signalling; 13-LOX,
  13-lipoxygenase species triggering jasmonate synthesis by converting α-linoleic
  acid (αLA); JA, jasmonate-dependent signaling; A, a hypothetical factor required
  for the activation of defence and salt adaptive genes. For details refer to the
  Discussion. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)
