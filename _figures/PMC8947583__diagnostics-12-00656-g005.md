caption: Overview of the NF-κB signaling pathway. NF-κB is inhibited by IκB in the
  cytoplasm. Upon activation by upstream signals (e.g., Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α,
  Interleukin (IL)-1, Chemo, IR), IκK (IκB kinase) phosphorylates IκB, resulting in
  its proteasomal degradation by the Skp_Cullin_F-box (SCF)βTRCP–ubiquitin ligase
  complex. Consequently, this frees NF-κB, allowing it to be translocated into the
  nucleus to activate gene transcriptions that promote proliferation and survival.
