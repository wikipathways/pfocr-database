caption: Signaling through TNFRs, IL1R, TLRs and TCR leads to the activation of NF-κB.
  Genetic factors such as variants in TLR4, TNF, LEP and exogenous and endogenous
  factors such as microbial infections, oxidative stress and obesity may promote chronic
  inflammation and enhance cell survival by up-regulating proinflammatory cytokines
  such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1 and leptin. Activation of the NF-κB pathway can enhance
  transcription of anti-apoptotic mediators such as Bcl-2L1, Bcl-2A1, cIAPs, and SOD2
  and proliferative factors such as cyclinD1, cyclinD2, and c-MYC (). Promotion of
  cell proliferation and survival of mutated cells including those with aberrantly
  rearranged antigen-receptors may contribute to lymphomagenesis.Tumor necrosis factor
  receptors (TNFRs), interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R), toll-like receptors (TLRs), T-cell
