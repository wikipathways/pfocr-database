caption: (A) Overview of the vanillate and β-oxidative deacetylation pathways, (B,
  a) the native vanR-vanABK gene cluster, (B, b) the aceE gene under synthetic control
  of VanR/PvanABK* (in C. glutamicum ΔPaceE::vanR-PvanABK*) and (C) relevant pathways
  around the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). Black arrows represent pathways
  or gene products and are dashed if indicating more than one reaction. Flat-headed
  lines point to inhibition. Blue arrows are genes and green boxes promotor regions.
  Color gradient of black arrow implies decreasing expression of aceE due to the utilization
  of phenolic compounds. Dotted lines represent the promotor exchange from PaceE to
  VanR/PvanABK*. (?) marks that this pathway is only predicted yet. Fcs, feruloyl-CoA
  synthetase; Ech, enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase; Vdh, vanillin dehydrogenase; VanAB,
  A and B subunits of vanillate demethylase encoded by vanA and vanB; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; VanR, PadR-type repressor encoded by vanR; vanK, gene coding for vanillate
  transport protein VanK; cg2464 + cg2465, genes coding for hypothetical proteins;
  aceE, aceF, and lpd, genes coding for E1-, E2- and E3-subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex (PDHC), respectively; PvanABK, promotor region of vanABK and its −10-region-optimized
  derivative indicated by (*). This figure was adapted and compiled with information
