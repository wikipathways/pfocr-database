caption: Schematic diagram showing that activation of the PPAR-γ pathway prevents
  ferroptosis-induced neuronal loss in an intracerebral hemorrhage model through synergistic
  actions with the Nrf2 pathway. Pioglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, inhibited the iron-induced
  death of neurons after ICH by activating the PPARγ pathway and promoting the expression
  of Gpx4, HIF-1α, HO-1, GST and SLC11A7 through the interaction between PPARγ and
  the Nrf2 pathway. The green arrow represents the Nrf2 pathway, and the red arrow
  represents the PPARγ pathway.
