caption: 'An integrated network of the significant KEGG pathways with their temporal
  perturbation patterns. Significant KEGG pathways (colored pie charts) or closely
  related other pathways (text only) are connected by arrows as indicated in the KEGG
  database. The mean t-statistics from multiple one-on-one comparisons at four different
  time points are plotted in pseudo heat color in the pie nodes as the average perturbation
  magnitude for significant KEGG pathways. Full names for some abbreviated KEGG pathways
  are: Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (Cytokine), Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis
  (Ublysis), Phosphatidylinositol signaling system (phosph).'
