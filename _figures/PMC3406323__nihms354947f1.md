caption: '(A) Schematic representation of the Hippo pathway evolution. The canonical
  metazoan Hippo pathway is shown on the left. The colours correspond to the three
  main steps in the evolution of the pathway, as shown in the cladogram (white=eukaryotes,
  red=unikonts, green=Holozoa, grey=Metazoa). Dots indicate origin and crosses indicate
  losses. Asterisks in Expanded (Ex) and Four-jointed (Fj) indicate these genes are
  exclusive to Bilateria.(B) Schematic representation of the eukaryotic tree of life
  showing the distribution of the different components of the Hippo pathway. A black
  dot indicates the presence of clear homologs, while a striped white-black dot indicates
  the presence of putative or degenerate homologs. Absence of a dot indicates that
  a homolog is lacking in that taxon. The taxon sampling for Bilateria includes Homo
  sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Daphnia pulex and Capitella teleta; other fungi
  includes the Ascomytoca Neurospora crassa and the Basidiomycota Ustilago maydis;
  Amoebozoa includes Acanthamoeba castellanii and Dictyostelium discoideum; other
  eukaryotes includes Arabidopsis thaliana, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Naegleria gruberi,
  Trichomonas vaginalis, Thalassiosira pseudonana, and Tetrahymena thermophila. Notes:
  1 Fungi Sd homologs do not have the C-terminal Y460 residue. 2 Sd/TEAD is present
  in the amoebozoan A. castellanii (whose homolog includes the C-terminal Y460 residue),
  but not in D. discoideum. 3A. macrogynus Hippo homolog does not contain the SARAH
  domain. 4N. crassa does not encode any homolog of Warts/Lats, although other Ascomycota
  such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Aspagillus niger do encode this gene. 5 Putative
  A. queenslandica Yorkie homolog contains just one, instead of two, WW protein domains.
  6 Putative A. queenslandica Kibra homolog contains an extra N-terminal PDZ domain.
  7C. owczarzaki, C. fragrantissima and S. arctica have proteins with the LLGL protein
  domain that in phylogenetic analysis appear as sister-group to a clade of the LLGL-containing
  Tomosyn and Lgl proteins. 8 Protein domain architecture is aberrant compared to
  bilaterian homologs. 9 Absent in H. sapiens.'
