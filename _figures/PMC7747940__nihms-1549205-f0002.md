caption: Through its FimA fimbriae, P. gingivalis can bind TLR2 (specifically the
  TLR2/TLR1 heterodimer; TLR2/1). Through a different structural component of the
  same molecule, P. gingivalis interacts with CXCR4 which cross-talks with and inhibits
  the TLR2/1-induced TIRAP/MyD88-mediated antimicrobial pathway. The underlying mechanism
  involves CXCR4-mediated stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling
  which limits NF-κB activation and induction of the inducible nitric oxide synthase
  (iNOS) that generates nitric oxide. The inhibitory effect on the production of nitric
  oxide, a potent antimicrobial mechanism for intracellular killing, promotes P. gingivalis
  survival in vitro and in vivo. By activating TLR2/1, P. gingivalis initiates inside-out
  signaling, which proceeds via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and cytohesin-1
  to induce the high-affinity conformation of CD11b/CD18 (a β2 integrin also known
  as complement receptor 3). P. gingivalis binds activated CD11b/CD18 and is thereby
  internalized in a relatively safe manner as CD11b/CD18 is not linked to potent microbicidal
  mechanisms. Moreover, the P. gingivalis-CD11b/CD18 interaction activates extracellular
  signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling which downregulates IL-12 p35 and p40
  mRNA expression. From reference []. Used by permission.
