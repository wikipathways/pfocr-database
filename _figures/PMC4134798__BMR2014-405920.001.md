caption: 'The mechanism of bone resorption in bone marrow metastasis. Tumor cells
  highly express CXCR4, causing their homing to BM by CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling. Metastatic
  tumor cells in bone release PTHrP, which induces OCL formation and bone resorption.
  Bone resorption releases the growth factors stored in bone such as TGF-β, IGF-1,
  PDGF, and FGF. TGF-β increases the expression of PTHrP, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11,
  PGE2, M-CSF, and TNF-α by direct impact on cancer cells. These factors induce OCL
  formation by increasing RANKL expression on OB cells. RANKL binds to RANK on OCL
  precursor. The expression CTGF/CCN2 gene is triggered by PTHrP and TGF-β released
  by tumor cells through PKA-PKC-dependent activation of ERK1/2 pathway. TGF-β also
  increases jagged-1 expression in tumor cell through the Smad pathway. Cancer cells
  expressing jagged-1 activate Notch signaling in OB, stimulating the secretion of
  IL-6, which stimulates tumor cell growth. VCAM-1 is expressed in tumor cells and
  binds α4β7 and α4β1 integrins on OCL progenitors, causing OCL differentiation. Platelet-derived
  TGF-β and direct contact between platelets and tumor cells increase invasion and
  metastasis. platelet-derived lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induces the release of
  IL-6 and IL-8 from tumor cells, which eventually leads to osteoclastic activation
  and bone resorption. Abbreviations: BM, bone marrow; CXCL12, C-X-C motif chemokine
