caption: Model of two interconnected Schizosaccharomyces pombe H2O2-responsive pathways.
  (A) Mechanism for the redox relay between Tpx1 and Pap1. Partitioning of the sulfenic
  acid of Tpx1 between condensation with the normal resolving cysteine of the catalytic
  cycle or a thiol group from Pap1 proceeds in a similar way as the Gpx3–Yap1 pathway
  shown in . Activation of Pap1 regulates expression of a thioredoxin (from trx2)
  and cytosolic catalase-1 (from ctt1). At high concentrations of H2O2, Tpx1 is hyperoxdized
  to sulfinic acid, which can be reversed by sulfiredoxin. (B) The Sty1 pathway. Sty1
  (also known as Spc1), a relative of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/p38 stress-activated
  protein kinases in higher organisms, is activated independently by a phosphorelay
  system that is promoted by formation of a mixed disulfide between Cys35 on Sty1
  and the peroxidatic Cys of Tpx1. Activated Sty1 activates the bZIP-type transcription
  factor Atf1, leading to upregulation of antioxidant gene expression (including Gpx
  from gpx1 and sulfiredoxin from srx1). An alternative mode of activating Sty1 may
  be formation of an internal disulfide bond that is induced by high H2O2 concentrations.
  Pap1, Schizosaccharomyces pombe activator protein-1; Sty1, stress-activated protein
  kinase in fission yeast.
