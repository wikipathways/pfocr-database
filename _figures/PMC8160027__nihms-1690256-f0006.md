caption: 'Schematic illustrating the differential role of caveoli in the physiological
  response of TM and SC cells to mechanical stress. (A) Illustration of the conventional
  outflow pathway. (Left) Low magnification showing lens, cornea, iridocorneal angle
  and direction of aqueous humor flow (blue arrows). (Right) Higher magnification
  depicting Schlemm’s canal (SC), trabecular meshwork (TM) and juxtacanicular tissue
  (JCT) with a preferential pathway for aqueous humor flow (blue arrows). (B) Flow
  diagram demonstrating the proposed status of Rho GTPase (in TM) and eNOS (in SC)
  before and after mechanical stress in three different types of mice: WT, endothelial
  CAV1 KO (Cav1ΔEC), and global CAV1 KO, and the resultant effect on nitric oxide
  (NO) production or cellular contraction.'
