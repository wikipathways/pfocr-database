caption: Maf-S-cnc-Keap1 pathway. The binding of the ubiquitin ligase Keap1 to cnc
  results in proteasomal degradation of cnc in the absence of oxidative stress. Under
  oxidative stress conditions, proteolysis is blocked and cnc is released by Keap1,
  which translocates into the nucleus and binds to Maf-S. The cnc-Maf-S complex then
  binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the genome, initiating transcription.
