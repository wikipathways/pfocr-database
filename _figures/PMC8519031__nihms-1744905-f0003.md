caption: Cellular stress responses important for mediating cell wall and cell membrane
  integrity. A global cellular regulator governing antifungal tolerance and resistance
  is the molecular chaperone, Hsp90. In C. albicans, Hsp90 is post-translationally
  regulated by the protein kinase complex CK2 as well as lysine deacetylases (KDACs).
  Key client proteins of Hsp90 important for mediating cell wall and cell membrane
  stress responses include the protein phosphatase calcineurin and several components
  of the PKC cell wall integrity pathway (Pkc1, Bck1, Mkk2, and Mkc1). Additional
  cellular factors important for mediating tolerance and resistance to the echinocandins
  include the transcription factor Cas5, the eukaryotic chaperonin containing TCP-1
  (CCT) complex, and the protein kinase Yck2. Notably, many other cellular factors
  contribute to these cellular stress responses, with many more enigmatic regulators
  that remain to be identified. Perturbation of any of these signaling pathways in
  combination with the cell wall or cell membrane stress elicited by the echinocandins
  and azoles, respectively, culminates in fungal growth inhibition.
