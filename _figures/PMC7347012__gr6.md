caption: Development of ocular surface ectodermal cell lineages from human induced
  pluripotent stem cells. (A) Schematic representation of in vivo and in vitro of
  eye development with BMP and WNT signaling pathways. The upper diagram shows an
  early optic vesicle stage at mouse embryonic stage E8.5, whereas the bottom diagram
  shows a pre-SEAM structure at 10 days of hiPSC differentiation. Gene expression
  patterns and cell lineages in the central, paracentral and peripheral zones in a
  pre-SEAM correlate to mouse E8.5 are indicated by black arrows based on the results
  of A. D, dorsal; V, ventral. (B) Schematic image of eye related organ development.
  The dotted lines indicate our findings that WNT inhibition and BMP signaling trigger
  corneal epithelial commitment. The red arrows indicate the newly proposed signaling
  pathway.
