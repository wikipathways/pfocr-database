caption: Diagram of possible mechanism of SG improving diabetes-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
  In diabetes, overactivation of MAPK signaling pathway induces cardiac hypertrophy
  and heart dysfunction through promoting cell transcription, differentiation, apoptosis,
  and growth. The inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway is associated with the amelioration
  of diabetes-induced cardiac hypertrophy by SG. And the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2
  by DUSP6 may play a vital role in this possible mechanism.
