caption: In addition to the previously reported p53-AKT crosstalk involving AKT-induced
  activation of MDM2 and p53-mediated induction of the phosphatase and tensin homolog
  (PTEN) (blue), p53 affects AKT activation through a novel indirect mechanism involving
  activation of the p53-target p21, which prevents phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
  (Rb) protein maintaining E2F-regulated genes in a repressed state (green). This
  leads to down-regulation of the expression of SREBP1c and its downstream target
  SCD, resulting in a decrease in mono-unsaturation of membrane phospholipids, decreased
  PIP2 and PIP3 levels, and ultimately decreased phosphorylation and activation of
  AKT (orange). PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), MDM2 (murine double minute
  2), AKT (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene), p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
  1A), Rb (retinoblastoma), E2F (E2F transcription factor), SREBP1c (sterol regulatory
  element bindingprotein-1c), SCD (stearoyl CoA desaturase 1), PL (phospholipid),
  PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol-(4, 5)-triphosphate), PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol-(3,
  4, 5)-triphosphate).
