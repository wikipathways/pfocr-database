caption: Peroxisome-derived H2O2 can oxidatively modify multiple glycolytic enzymes.
  Schematic outlining a simplified overview of glycolysis, the oxidative branch of
  the pentose phosphate pathway (Ox-PPP), and the glutathione redox cycle. Metabolic
  enzymes and metabolites are indicated in purple and black, respectively. Enzymes
  that become sulfenylated upon peroxisomal H2O2 production are shown on a yellow
  background. Based on evidence found in the literature (), oxidation of GAPDH and
  PKM respectively (i) redirects the glycolytic flux towards ox-PPP (through an increase
  in the metabolites upstream of GAPDH), and (ii) increases the synthesis of the glutathione
  precursors glycine and cysteine (through activation of serine synthesis by a buildup
  of 2PG). 1,3BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate;
