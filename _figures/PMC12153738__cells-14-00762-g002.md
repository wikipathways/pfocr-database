caption: The multifaceted role of Progranulin (PGRN) in various cardiac pathologies.
  This diagram illustrates how PGRN is involved in different cardiac conditions, including
  myocardial infarction and ischemia-reperfusion injury, sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy,
  and cardiac aging and hypertrophy. The figure depicts various cell types involved
  in these processes, such as cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils.
  Key molecular interactions are shown, including PGRN binding to receptors like SORT1,
  TNFR1, and TNFR2, and its influence on other molecules, like C1q and components
  of the Wnt pathway. The diagram outlines several intracellular signaling cascades
  affected by PGRN, such as the activation of the PI3K/Akt and mTOR pathways and the
  inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-kappa B pathways, which collectively modulate
  inflammation, fibrosis, apoptosis, and cellular homeostasis. Additionally, the regulation
  of the PGRN promoter by the IGF-1 receptor is indicated. These mechanisms collectively
  underscore PGRN’s protective and modulatory effects in the context of diverse cardiac
  diseases
