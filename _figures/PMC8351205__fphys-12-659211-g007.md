caption: Potential mechanism of G2A deficiency in atherosclerosis development by regulating
  macrophages. G2A knockout in LDLR deficient background leads to an exaggerated lipid
  disorder and pro-atherosclerosis phenotype. The latter associates with oxidative
  stress and endothelial dysfunction. Increased expression of adhesion molecules and
  chemokines recruits more macrophages to the intima. These macrophages engulf oxidized
  cholesterol (oxLDL) through scavenger receptors including LOX-1, CD36, and SR-A1.
  However, ABCA1 and ABCG1 which participate in cholesterol efflux did not change.
  The disruption of lipid homeostasis in macrophages leads to cholesterol accumulation
  and formation of foam cells. In addition, inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages
  shifts them to a more pro-atherosclerosis phenotype. Moreover, PI-3K/AKT signaling
  pathway was found to participate in the up-regulated apoptosis. All these changes
  eventually contribute to aggravated aortic lesions.
