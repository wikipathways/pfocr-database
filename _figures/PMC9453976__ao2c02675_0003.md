caption: Two major pathways in antioxidant therapy “Nrf2 pathway and the NFκB pathway”.
  (A) Under unstressed events, KEAP1 interrelates with Nrf2 and actin cytoskeleton
  to retain Nrf2 in dormant form and thus encourage both ubiquitination and deprivation
  of Nrf2. In addition, oxidative stress not only separates Nrf2 from KEAP1 but also
  translocates it to the nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2 heterodimerizes with Maf. It
  produces Nrf2-Maf heterodimer, which further attaches to ARE to form metabolic genes.
  For instance, NQO1, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), GSTs, GCL, and manganese superoxide
  dismutase (MnSOD) produce antioxidant effects. Additionally, oxidative stress is
  controlled via the activation of the Nrf2 pathway. In addition, the levels of KEAP1
  are lowered by the siKEAP1 after loading them into RISC and by eliminating complementary
  mRNA of the KEAP1. Furthermore, Nrf2 activators, for instance, SF, CA, DMF, RTA408,
  and genistein, also induce the Nrf2 pathway and improve oxidative stress. (B) In
  resting conditions, NFκB dimers develop a complex with IkB protein in the cytoplasm.
  TNF-α, an inflammatory signal, encourages phosphorylation of IkB protein due to
  the involvement of IKK, which leads to ubiquitination and ultimately degradation
  of IkB. In addition, after moving active NFκB into the nucleus, it stimulates target
  genes such as TNF-α, NADPH oxidase (NOX)-2, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible
  nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-6, and IL-1b causing both oxidative stresses as
  well as inflammation. Moreover, oxidative stress is controlled by hindering the
  NFκB pathway. Furthermore, MiR-146a shows aptitude toward targeting, inhibiting
  TRAF6, impeding the stimulation of IKK, and the NFκB pathway. Finally, SIRT1 activators,
  such as SRT1720, resveratrol, and berberine, overcome attaching of NFκB to inflammation-initiating
  gene promoters and their transcriptional events via stimulating SIRT1. RISC, RNA-induced
  silencing complex; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6; ARE,
  antioxidant response element.
