caption: Allergen-dependent and -independent pathways and mast cell-mediated and basophil-mediated
  sub-pathways in the murine immune system. The allergen-dependent pathway is triggered
  when allergens bind to antibodies that are bound by FcRs expressed on mast cells
  and basophils. Subsequently, activated mast cells and basophils release chemical
  mediators. The allergen-independent pathway is triggered when biological response
  modifiers (BRMs) bind to their respective receptors expressed on mast cells and
  basophils, which results in the activation of these cells. In the allergen-dependent
  mast cell-mediated sub-pathway, IgE and FcεR come into play and histamine is released.
  In contrast, in the allergen-dependent basophil-mediated sub-pathway, IgG and FcγRs
  come into play and platelet-activating factor (PAF) is released. Neutrophils and
  monocytes are reported to be other key players in allergy. IgG and FcγRs are involved
  and PAF is released.
