caption: Proposed mechanism for the synthesis of dihydroindoles from triazole 1a and
  rationalization of dihydroindole regioselectivity from sigmatropic rearrangements.
  Energetically preferred pathway shown in blue. Transition state energies are calculated
  relative to endo-C and are given in parenthesis as ΔG/ΔH at 343 K. See the  for
  details. RXN = reaction, RAR = rearrangement, Rot = rotation, TS = transition state.
