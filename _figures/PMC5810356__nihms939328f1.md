caption: Relationships between metabolome, proteome, and genome in metabolic reprogramming
  of endothelial cells in PH. In typical cells under normal oxygen levels, a majority
  of pyruvate derived from glucose enters the mitochondria where it is oxidized in
  the TCA cycle to generate ATP to meet the cell’s energy demands. However, in PH
  endothelial cells, pyruvate is directed away from the mitochondria toward glycolysis
  in order to create lactate through the action of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)—a process
  typically activated by low oxygen exposure. Lactate production in the presence of
  oxygen is termed “aerobic glycolysis” or the Warburg effect, a phenomenon common
  in cancer cells. In aerobic glycolysis, excess glucose is diverted through the pentose
  phosphate shunt (PPS) and serine/glycine biosynthesis pathway to create nucleotides.
  Fatty acids are critical for new membrane production and are synthesized from citrate
  in the cytosol by ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) to generate acetyl-CoA. Signals impacting
  levels of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and nuclear factor of activated T cells
  (NFAT) can increase expression of enzymes such as LDH to promote lactate production,
  as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase to inhibit the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase
  and limit entry of pyruvate into TCA cycle. Highly proliferative endothelial cells
  need to produce excess lipid, nucleotide, and amino acids for the creation of new
  biomass. There is also increased use of glutamine as another fuel source, which
  enters the mitochondria and can be used to replenish TCA intermediates or to produce
  more pyruvate through the action of malic enzyme. Adapted with permission from Science
