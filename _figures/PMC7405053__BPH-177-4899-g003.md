caption: Possible mechanisms for PGE2 modulation of immune cell functions in COVID‐19.
  PGE2 is likely to modulate immune responses in various cell types during SARS‐CoV‐2
  infection, influencing COVID‐19 pathogenesis. In epithelial cells, attachment of
  SARS‐CoV‐2 with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 leads to endocytosis, viral replication, and cell
  damage, activating RLR (RIG‐1 and MAD5)‐dependent production of type I and III IFNs
  and the TLR‐dependent NF‐κB pathway. The NF‐κB pathway induces expression of proinflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., IL‐1b, IL‐6, IL‐8, and GM‐CSF), chemokines (e.g., CCL2 and CXCL1),
  and other inflammatory mediators such as COX‐2 and mPGES‐1, resulting in PGE2 secretion.
  Here, while it suppresses production of type I (and possibly type III) IFNs, PGE2
  further amplifies NF‐κB signalling and production of cytokines and chemokines in
  a positive feedback loop. PGE2 may also directly modulate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene
  expression, endocytosis, and viral replication. In monocytes/macrophages, activation
  of NF‐κB and STAT3 mediates production of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines
  which contributes to development of cytokine secretion syndrome (the “cytokine storm”),
  chemokines that recruit monocytes and neutrophils, inflammatory biomarkers (e.g.,
  SAAs, CPR, and D‐dimer), and PGE2. Here, PGE2 again represses IFN‐induced expression
  of ISGs, contributing to delay of viral clearance. Importantly, PGE2 context‐dependently
  affects (either positively or negatively) not only NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  and related IL‐1β maturation but also NF‐κB‐dependent monocyte/macrophage cytokine
  production. PGE2 differentially regulates platelet aggregation via different receptors
  and probably inhibits NETosis associated with inflammation and thrombosis. PGE2
  also down‐regulates IFN‐γ production and cytotoxicity of NK and CD8 T cells that
  kill cells infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 but promotes differentiation of proinflammatory
  Th17 and Th1 cells, the chief cellular sources of the cytokine storm at late stages
  of COVID‐19
