caption: The role of miR-199a in lung cancer and interplay with other ncRNAs. Promoter
  methylation and sponge adsorption of lncRNAs and circRNAs resulted in low expression
  levels of miR-199a. miR-199a acts as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer by targeting
  downstream genes. Overexpression of miR-199a could inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation,
  infiltration and migration, glycolytic pathway and tumor angiogenesis and increase
  lung cancer cell apoptosis. In some drug-resistant lung tumor cell lines, it also
  plays a sensitizing role.
