caption: A scheme of functional annotation for transcripts in the 16 types of profiles
  (for discussion). There were 16 types of profiles for the differential transcripts
  in the three experimental groups of the cortex or lesion-lateral STR (control, model,
  and EA group). These profiles can be mainly divided into 5 subgroups after 100 Hz
  EA treatment (). Here, the schematic summarizes the related major functional categories
  of the transcripts regulated in 16 types profiles (Tables S2–8). Red represents
  the functional annotation for the upregulated transcripts. Green represents the
  functional annotation for the downregulated transcripts. Blue represents the functional
  annotation for the transcripts that returned the levels of gene expression to control
  values. *This box includes olfactory receptor activity, detection of chemical stimulus
  involved in sensory perception of smell, G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling
  pathway, cell surface receptor linked signal transduction, cognition or neurological
  system process, and sensory perception (Table S2).
