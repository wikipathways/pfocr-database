caption: 'Schematic of alternate tryptophan pathways and metabolites and their effects
  on macrophages, inflammation, and neurofunction. Tryptophan has two major metabolic
  pathways: (1) indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway, which generates kynurenine-associated
  immunosuppression, and (2) tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) pathway in which the tryptophan
  metabolites are involved in neural function modulation and anti-inflammatory effects.
  Note that tryptophan metabolism plays an important role in host immunity and neurological
  disorders in HIV/Mtb infection. BH4 is an essential enzyme cofactor for NOS in NO
  production, and THP in the conversion of tryptophan to 5-HTP. Importantly, NO strongly
  inhibits IDO1 activity, and exogenous BH4 may rescue kynurenine-mediated T-cell
  suppression. GCH1, GTP cyclohydrolase 1; BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin (one of tryptophan
  hydroxylase); 5-HTP, 5-hydroxytryptophan; 5-MTP, 5-methoxytryptophan; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine
  (serotonin); melatonin, N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine; TPH, tryptophan hydroxylase;
  IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; Kyn, kynurenine; NO, nitric oxide; iNOS, inducible
  nitric oxide synthase; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; D1MT, 1-methyl-D-tryptophan.'
