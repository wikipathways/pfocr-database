caption: Epigenetic rejuvenation bypasses the ES/iPS cell stage. Box 1 describes the
  characteristics of an old senescent cell. Senescent cells possess chromatin damage,
  telomere attrition, morphological changes in shape, dysfunction in DNA repair mechanisms,
  oxidative damage, increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p53, increased
  levels of the epigenetic modifiers heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1β) and mH2A (variant
  histone macro H2A), presence of SAHF (senescent-associated heterochromatin foci)
  (depicted as large ‘dots’ in the old cell), and expression of β-galactosidase activity.
  The horizontal arrow depicts the dedifferentiation pathway from the senescent cell
  to the ES/iPS cell stage after somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) or introduction
  of the ‘reprogramming factors’. Epigenetic rejuvenation of old cells (diagonal arrow)
  can be achieved by ‘conditioning’ of old cells within the oocyte cytoplasm via SCNT
  as explained in the text. For simplicity, we have not shown somatic cell transfer
  into the germinal vesicle (GV) of frog oocytes but GV system does represent another
  model system for the study of ‘epigenetic rejuvenation’, as detailed in the text.
  The vertical arrow downwards depicts the redifferentiation of the ES/iPS cells into
  a young differentiated cell type, which has reversed or repaired all the senescence
  characteristics of the old cell (see box 2). The young cell has lost its SAHF.
