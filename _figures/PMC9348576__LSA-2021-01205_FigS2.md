caption: 'We found 142 deregulated genes in Dp(16)1Yey/+ with 77 up-regulated. (A,
  B) Using Webgestalt suite, we identified two significant networks (A) and (B). (A)
  A network that includes eight genes from the 70 up-regulated list with an enrichment
  in Gene Ontology Biological Process: chemical synaptic transmission (P = 220446
  × 10−16). (B) A network that includes four genes from the 77 up-regulated list with
  an enrichment in Gene Ontology Biological Process: Biological Process: glutamate
  receptor signaling pathway (P = 220446 × 10−16). Note that the three genes (Camk2a,
  Gda, and Dlgap3) are part of a protein network of ARC-dependent DLG4 interactors
  that include 20 proteins (), indicating an over enrichment of 43.85-fold compared
  with expectations (hypergeometric P-value = 4.20 × 10−5). (parameters: 3, 20, 77,
  and 22,508 number of mouse genes from Mouse Ensembl [GRCm38.p6]).'
