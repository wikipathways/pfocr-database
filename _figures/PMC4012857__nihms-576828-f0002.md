caption: Bacterial chemotaxis is an example where multiple, separate adaptation modules
  are at work in one signaling cascade.A.) In the basic chemosensory pathway, increases
  in ligand decrease the concentration of intracellular CheY-P, which regulates the
  direction the flagellar motor rotates. On top of this, two adaptation modules have
  been identified.B.) The fast acting adaptation module 1 regulates methylation levels
  of the receptor and ultimately sets pathway activity. High methylation levels engage
  CheB in a negative feedback loop and reset receptor activity. This adaptation module
  serves to extend the dynamic range towards chemoattractant. Once adapted, only a
  stronger stimulus can trigger another response.C.) A second, slow acting adaptation
  module regulates the number of FliM subunits the bacterial motor is comprised of.
  This module keeps the sensitivity of the motor aligned with the steady-state level
  of phosphorylated CheY, which can vary between cells. This module adds robustness
  to the signaling pathway.
