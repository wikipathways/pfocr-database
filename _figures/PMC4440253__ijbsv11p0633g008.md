caption: 'Diagram summarizing KMUP-1 amelioration of 5-HT-induced K+ channel inhibition
  in PASMCs. 5-HT binds to 5-HT2A receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor
  that interacts with Gq proteins. Gq activates phospholipase C (PLC) resulting in
  the production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) and activation
  of protein kinase C (PKC), which is capable of phosphorylating tyrosine kinases
  and inhibiting K+ efflux. KMUP-1 does not simply inhibit 5-HT-mediated PKC signaling
  but can directly activate adenylate cyclase (AC)/protein kinase A (PKA) cascades,
  resulting in K+ channel opening. PMA: Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.'
