caption: Intracellular Gal-8 mediates autophagy through binding to glycans of ruptured
  vacuolar membranes and the autophagy receptor NDP52 to initiate the formation of
  autophagosomes. Autophagy is considered as inhibitory to the action of inflammasomes
  that promote the generation of selected cytokines. Gal-8 binding to exposed luminal
  glycans of damaged lysosomal membranes inactivates mTOR. Direct in vitro interactions
  of intracellular Gal-8 with K-Ras, inhibit K-Ras activity and abrogates ERK signaling
  pathway. ERK and mTOR stimulate the NF-κB pathway, therefore, their inhibition by
  intracellular Gal-8 is expected to dampen cytokine/chemokine expression and secretion.
  Gal-8 also functions extracellularly. Extracellular Gal-8 binds to a complex of
  cell surface receptors that include LRP1, uPAR, and MRC2; CD44 and members of the
  integrin family. Their ligation triggers many signaling cascades including AKT,
  ERK, and JNK that stimulate the NFkB signaling pathways that converge upon cytokine/chemokine
  production and secretion. Activation of specific cytokines is presumably mediated
  by different signaling pathways. For example, RANKL expression in osteoblasts is
  mediated by the ERK pathway, whereas expression of SDF-1 in the same cells, is triggered
  by JNK. The secreted cytokines serve as chemo-attractants of cancer cells and as
  potential inducers of a ‘cytokine storm’. The interplay between the actions of intracellular
  vs. extracellular Gal-8 deserves further elucidation.
