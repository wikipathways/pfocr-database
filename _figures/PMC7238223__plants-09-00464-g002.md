caption: Plant event in responses to T. urticae infestation. Specific plant receptors
  (PRRs) recognize elicitors/effectors (HAMPs) derived from either the plant or the
  spider mite that induce alterations in the membrane potential (Vm), cytosolic Ca2+
  influxes and ROS/RNS burst. Ca2+-sensing proteins, MPKs and phosphatases (APC21)
  participate in the defense transduction pathway. H2O2 content is highly regulated
  by ROS-related enzymes (BB22, AO, GSTU and CPX7). Besides, genes such as MATI, PP2A5
  and others still unknown participate in the tight regulation of the hormonal crosstalk,
  mainly in the Jasmonic Acid/Salicylic Acid balance. All together plus some transcription
  factors (ABI4 and other unknown TFs) regulate the induction of the synthesis of
  a battery of defense molecules. Unknown genes, molecules, pathways and responses
  are indicated in red.
