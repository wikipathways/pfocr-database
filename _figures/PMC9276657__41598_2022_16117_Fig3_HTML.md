caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis of the T helper cell response in M. intracellulare-infected
  canine MDMs. (A) The Th1 Pathway and (B) Th17 Activation Pathway were expressed
  at 72 h post infection. The individual nodes represent proteins with relationships
  represented by edges. The red and green colors indicate up- and downregulation based
  on the expression values, respectively. The activation states by z-scores are shown
  as follows: orange indicates activation, blue indicates inactivation, and uncolored
  nodes indicate genes that were not differentially expressed in this pathway.'
