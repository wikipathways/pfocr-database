caption: Possible roles of HLA-B*27 in the pathogenesis of AS. After transport into
  the ER by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), peptides are
  assembled onto nascent MHC class I molecules by the peptide loading complex (PLC),
  comprising TAP, tapasin (Tpn) calreticulin (CRT) and ERp57, and further trimmed
  by ERAP. The presence of certain ERAP haplotypes results in a significantly decreased
  number of peptides optimal for HLA-B*27, leading to accumulation of misfolded proteins
  in the ER or expression of sub-optimally or neoantigen-loaded HLA-B*27 on the cell
  surface. Neoantigen loaded HLA-B*27 on the cell surface could induce activation
  of CD8+ T cells. Protein misfolding in the ER can cause ER stress and activation
  of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to induce IL-23 secretion. IL-23 further
  activates the IL-23/IL-17 axis. On the other hand, free heavy chains or disulfide
  bond-linked homodimers of HLA-B*27 can be formed and expressed on the cell surface
  during HLA-B*27 recycling via the endocytic pathway. Engagement of these aberrant
  species by KIR3DL2 on the surface of Th17 cells is known to enhance their survival,
  proliferation, and IL-17 expression. IL-17 can promote the release of proinflammatory
  cytokines to establish inflammation.
