caption: Noise initiates the production of ROS via release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic
  reticulum and/or entry from extracellular fluid, which induces release of ROS from
  mitochondria, and by activation of NADPH oxidases. ROS can activate NF-κB, leading
  to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and also κRas/cdc42/JNK pathway
  leading to the expression of stress and apoptosis genes. Pro-apoptotic factors further
  increase mitochondrial membrane permeability, leading to the release of additional
  ROS. The JNK pathway can be inhibited by the ERK MAPK or AKT, signaling molecules
  that can be activated by growth factors.
