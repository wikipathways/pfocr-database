caption: Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) catalyzes phosphatidylcholine into AA in response
  to agonist stimulation of a G-protein–coupled cell surface receptor. AA acts as
  a substrate for COX activity to produce prostanoids (e.g., prostaglandins and thromboxanes)
  and prostacyclin, whereas leukotrienes are generated by 5-LO. The LO-LO pathway
  produces lipoxins, whereas aspirin triggers the production of 15-epi-lipoxins from
  AA through acetylation of COX-2. Through this pathway, 15-epi-H(p)ETEs are produced,
  which are then converted to lipoxins by transcellular biosynthesis using 5-LO from
  neutrophils. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) act through antagonism
  of COX-1 and -2 enzymes. Reprinted with permission from the International and American
