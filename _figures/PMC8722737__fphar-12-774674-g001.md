caption: Experimental design. STZ was intraperitoneally injected at 8 weeks after
  NCD or HFD feeding. Rats with HFD/STZ treatment respectively received intragastric
  administration of ART, Met, and ART/Met combination for four consecutive weeks at
  9 weeks after feeding. Animals were placed in metabolism cages, followed by measurement
  of metabolic parameters (urine output, food consumption, and water intake) at 12 weeks
  after feeding. Finally, rats were sacrificed at 4 weeks post drug treatment for
  various analyses. ART, artesunate; Met, metformin. Con, Normal control group; Dia,
  Untreated diabetic group; D-Art, ART-treated diabetic group; D-Met, Met-treated
  diabetic group; D-Com, ART/Met co-treated diabetic group.
