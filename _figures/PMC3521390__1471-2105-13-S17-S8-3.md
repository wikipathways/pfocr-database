caption: 'Search space of pathway prediction and A* algorithm for shortest path search.
  (A) The metabolic pathway prediction problem between compounds can be replaced by
  a mathematical shortest path search problem. That is, finding the shortest path
  to reach the integer vector of a goal compound by adding the integer vectors of
  reaction rules to the integer vectors of intermediate compounds can be considered
  a shortest path problem in an integer-vector space. (B) In the A* algorithm, the
  evaluation function (the distance-plus-cost heuristic) f(t) for each node t in the
  search space is defined as the sum of two functions: the past-cost function p(t),
  which is the cost (distance) it has taken to get from the starting node to the current
  node t, and a heuristic estimate h''(t) of the distance to the goal.'
