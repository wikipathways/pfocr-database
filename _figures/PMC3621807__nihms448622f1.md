caption: A model for piRNA biogenesis in the Drosophila ovary. (a) Two distinct piRNA
  pathways are active in a stage 10 egg chamber of the Drosophila ovary. The nurse
  cells that provide nutrients to the oocyte and the oocyte itself make up the germ
  cells of the ovary, shown in blue. The monolayer of somatic follicle cells surrounding
  the oocyte is shown in green. Nuclei are indicated as circles within each cell.
  (b) In follicle cells, primary piRNAs arise from flamenco and are processed through
  a cascade of enzymatic cuts. Transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol2) depends on
  deposition of Histone 3 Lysine 9 trimethyl marks (H3K9me3) by Eggless (Egg). Regulatory
  cis-acting elements, indicated as green boxes, upstream of the transcriptional start
  site could affect Pol2 recruitment and transcription. Additionally, clusters could
  carry cis elements within themselves, shown in red, that affect downstream processing.
  After processing of the primary cluster transcript by unknown activities, piRNA
  intermediates are cleaved by the nuclease, Zucchini (Zuc). After 5′ end formation,
  transcripts with a U at the first position are preferentially loaded into Piwi.
  Trimming activity, which could be carried out by redundant nucleases, shortens the
  transcript to its mature length. This process is coupled to 2′-O-methylation by
  Hen1. (c) The transcription of clusters in germ cells can occur bidirectionally.
  In addition to Egg, the HP1 homolog Rhino (Rhi) and Cutoff (Cuff) are essential
  for transcription. Subsequently, the helicase UAP56 binds the primary transcript
  and escorts it to the nuclear periphery. There, it is handed over to another RNA
  helicase Vasa (Vas) and arrives at its site of biogenesis, the nuage. After primary
  processing by similar machinery as in (a), primary piRNAs are loaded into Piwi and
  Aub, and potentially Ago3. These primary piRNAs can be used to kick-start the ping-pong
  amplification cycle, which silences transposons post-transcriptionally.
