caption: '(Top, left) Schematic presentation of the two aqueous outflow pathways.
  Pathway is the conventional path through the TM and SC to the episcleral vein. Pathway
  is the uveoscleral pathway, in which aqueous travels through the iris root and ciliary
  muscle to the choroidal circulation or orbital tissues. (Top, right) The routes
  of drug kinetics. The numbers refer to following processes: 1) transcorneal permeation
  from the lacrimal fluid into the anterior chamber, 2) non-corneal drug permeation
  across the conjunctiva and sclera into the anterior uvea, 3) drug distribution from
  the blood stream via blood-aqueous barrier into the anterior chamber, 4) elimination
  of drug from the anterior chamber by the aqueous humor turnover to the trabecular
  meshwork and Sclemm''s canal, 5) drug elimination from the aqueous humor into the
  systemic circulation across the blood-aqueous barrier, 6) drug distribution from
  the blood into the posterior eye across the blood-retina barrier, 7) intravitreal
  drug administration, 8) drug elimination from the vitreous via posterior route across
  the blood-retina barrier, and 9) drug elimination from the vitreous via anterior
  route to the posterior chamber. Taken from ref. (23). (Bottom) sites of action (Ciliary
  Body) and accumulation (Tenon’s Capsule) of timolol'
