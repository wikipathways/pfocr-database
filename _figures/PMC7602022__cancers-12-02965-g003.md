caption: Schematic representation of the neurofibromin signalling pathways. Neurofibromin
  positively regulates adenylyl cyclase which, converting ATP in cAMP, increases the
  intracellular cAMP levels with consequent inhibition of cell proliferation. In addition,
  neurofibromin promotes the conversion of active GTP-bound Ras to its inactive GDP-bound
  conformation. The downstream effectors of the Ras pathway include mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase (PI3K). The
  activation of these Ras-triggered pathways leads to cell proliferation and tumour
  growth. Therefore, neurofibromin—acting as a negative modulator of the Ras signalling—exerts
  a tumour suppressor activity. Figure was redrawn from Lobbous et al. [].
