caption: Classical (genomic) and non-classical (non-genomic) androgen signaling in
  Sertoli cells. In cells not exposed to androgens, the androgen receptor (AR) is
  bound to heat-shock proteins (HSP) in the cytoplasm. Testosterone and other androgens
  are steroids that easily cross the cell membrane and bind to the AR, that is released
  from HSP. The ligand-bound AR can either translocate to the nucleus and interact
  with androgen response elements (ARE) or with other transcription factors (TF),
  thus activating the classical/genomic pathway, or migrate to the inner side of the
  cell membrane and interact with Src, thus activating the non-classical/non-genomic
  pathway. CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; EGFR, Epidermal growth factor
  receptor; ERK, Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, Mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; Src, Steroid receptor coactivator. Reproduced with permission from Edelsztein
