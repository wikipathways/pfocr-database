caption: (a) Proposed model for the impact of a disease hit on a relevant pathway,
  contributing to an increased risk in the disease. (b) This variant is associated
  with an increase in levels of metabolites that have been implicated with increased
  risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), and a decrease in the levels of metabolites
  that have been implicated with decreased risk. Parentheses indicate nonsignificant
  associations, ‘NA’ indicates no evidence was found, and ‘-’ indicates a placeholder
  because CAD is being compared with itself. (c) Results for rs61791721 with gene
  assignment PCCB, which encodes a protein that catalyzes the conversion of propionyl-CoA
  to succinyl-CoA. The hypothesized mechanism is that the variant is decreasing the
  activity of PCCB, resulting in the above metabolite associations. Ammonium is represented
  by its chemical formula (). Data are shown in circles with the coloring corresponding
  to the effect (beta) of that variant on that metabolite. All solid lines represent
  a single chemical reaction step. Dotted lines represent a simplification of multiple
  steps.
