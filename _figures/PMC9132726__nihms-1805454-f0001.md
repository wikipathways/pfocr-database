caption: Overview of Hh signal transduction. Vertebrate Hh signaling relies on protein
  trafficking at the primary cilium, a centrosome organized, microtubule-based cell
  surface organelle. The membrane of the cilium is continuous with the cytoplasmic
  membrane, but the ciliary cytosol is separated from the cytoplasm via transition
  fibers that function as filter for material exchange between ciliary axoneme and
  the cytoplasm. A, When the Hh pathway is off, Ptch resides in the cilium and inhibits
  Smo. Active PKA phosphorylates Gli3, resulting in Gli3’s proteolytical processing
  into Gli3R, a transcription repressor. Active PKA also phosphorylates Gli2 and inhibits
  its trafficking to the cilium tip, preventing its activation. Note that both Gli
  proteins complex with SuFu, a negative regulator of the Hh pathway. B, Upon binding
  to the ligand Shh, Ptch exits from the cilium, and Smo is activated and accumulated
  in the cilium. PKA is inactivated and stops phosphorylating Gli proteins. As a result,
  both Gli proteins dissociate from SuFu. Gli3 remains in the full-length form and
  Gli2 is activated. Active Gli2 enters the nucleus to turn on the transcription of
  Hh target genes.
