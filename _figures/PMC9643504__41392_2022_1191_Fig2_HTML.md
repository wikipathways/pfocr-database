caption: The core Hippo pathway in mammals. STRIPAK complex in the upstream regulates
  both MST1/2 and MAP4Ks. MAP4Ks or MST1/2 and its scaffold protein SAV1 could phosphorylate
  LATS1/2 and its scaffold MOB1 with the help of WWC1–3. The phosphorylated MOB1 can
  also directly promote the activation of LATS1/2 by inducing the conformational change
  of LATS1/2. The activated LATS1/2 phosphorylated and inactivated YAP/TAZ, preventing
  it from translocating into the nucleus and binding to transcription factors TEAD1–4
