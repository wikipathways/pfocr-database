caption: Biosynthesis pathway of MF. From the A. tumefaciens C58 genome annotation,
  it can be proposed that extracellular mannose can be taken up and phosphorylated
  by a phosphotransferase system (PTS) (EC 2.7.1.69, Atu0031) yielding Man-6P, which
  can also be produced from intracellular Fru-6P by Man-6-phosphate isomerase (PMI)
  (EC 5.3.1.8, Atu3311) activity. The sequential action of phosphomannomutase (PMM)
  (EC 5.4.2.8, Atu2379) and Man-1P-guanylyl transferase (M-1P-GT) (EC 2.7.7.22, Atu3353)
  leads to the synthesis of GDP-Man, the mannosyl donor for MF biosynthesis. The Suc
  biosynthesis pathway in plants and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (, , ) is shown for comparison.
