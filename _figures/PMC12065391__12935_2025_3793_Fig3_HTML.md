  Dendritic cell vaccines are generated by loading patient-derived DCs with TAA/LAA

  cells by releasing cytotoxic molecules such as IFNγ, perforin, and granzymes and
  activating death receptor pathways (Fas-FasL and TRAIL-DR4). E ICIs inhibit ICPs
  such as PD-L1, TIGIT, TIM-3, and CTLA-4, which tumor cells use to exhaust T cells
  and avoid detection. By inhibiting these immune checkpoints, T cells can recognize
  and attack tumor cells. GM-CSF, granulocyte‒macrophage colony‒stimulating factor;
