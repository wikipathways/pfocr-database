caption: Schematic representation of blood-brain barrier (BBB) alteration in cerebral
  microbleeds (CMBs). Cell-cell interactions in the neurovascular unit indicate the
  breakdown of BBB and promote CMBs development. VEGF, CRP, sICAM, MPO, IL-6, and
  E-selectin contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Serum Response Factor (SRF) and
  its MRTF cofactors play a vital role in cerebral microvascular integrity through
  regulating EC junction components and basement membrane proteins. Matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs) derived from microglia and astrocytes are associated with the degradation
  of TJs and ECM, exacerbating the injury of the vascular wall. S100B derived from
  astrocytes is able to promote the release of oxidative stress mediators and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, resulting in further BBB breakdown and the development of CMBs. At the
  same time, the cytokines derived from microglia and astrocytes play a role in endothelial
  dysfunction, such as glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), fibroblast growth
  factor (FGF), angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1), and IFN-γ. Recent studies also suggest a role
  of pericytes in the development of CMBs through the bone morphogenetic protein 4
  (BMP4) pathway, which is related to astrogliogenesis and inhibits oligodendrocyte
  differentiation.
