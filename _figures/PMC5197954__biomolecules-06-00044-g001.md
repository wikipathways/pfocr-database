caption: Intronic microRNAs (miRNAs) and the miRNA-488/ZIP8/MTF1 pathway are critically
  involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). Distinct miRNAs (miRNA-33a,
  miRNA-455-3p, miRNA-140, and miRNA-335-5p) reside within intronic regions of human
  genes and they modulate the expression of a series of molecules either positively
  (upward pointing arrows) or negatively (downward pointing arrows) associated with
  the development of osteoarthritis. These molecules include proteases responsible
  for the degradation of cartilage matrix (matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), A Disintegrin
  and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs 5 (ADAMTS5)), molecules related
  with cholesterol synthesis and efflux in OA chondrocytes (sterol regulatory element
  binding protein 2 (SREBP-2), apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), and ATP binding cassette
  subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1)), or they affect Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog
  2/3 (Smad2/3)- and Wingless (Wnt)-dependent signalling. On the other hand, miRNA-488
  influences a zinc transporter ZIP8/ metal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (ZIP8/MTF1)-mediated
  route, which eventually upregulates a set of molecules that are implicated in the
  enzymatic erosion of articular cartilage, i.e., MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS5. These
  molecular events largely contribute to the OA phenotype through promoting pathological
  changes; erosion of cartilage and meniscus, denudation of the subchondral bone and
  osteophytosis (see the text for details). Other miRNA-dependent, as well as miRNA-independent,
  pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of OA. However, they are not depicted
  here for reasons of simplicity. Intronic miRNAs reside in introns from different
  loci. A common graph of three exons has been drawn here for reasons of clarity.
  Key anatomic domains of the knee and their alterations during OA development are
  indicatively depicted. These molecular events are not only associated with knee
  osteoarthritis but they may also be localized in other joints.
