caption: “Pathways in Cancer” was the most significantly enriched pathway identified
  in iPathway Guide for the cut bone ends comparison. Biologically relevant protein-protein
  interactions that are part of this pathway are shown. * marks genes that are also
  part of the “Hippo Signaling” Pathway. The heat map scale represents log2 fold changes.
