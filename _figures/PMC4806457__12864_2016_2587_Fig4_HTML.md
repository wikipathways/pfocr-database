caption: 'Differential expression of unigenes involved in glycolysis in E8 and E24
  compared to C samples of Hevea brasiliensis. Glycolysis comprises 10 step reactions.
  In step 1, the enzyme hexokinase (HK) phosphorylates glucose by transferring a phosphate
  group from ATP to glucose forming glucose 6-phosphate. In step 2, glucose 6-phosphate
  is converted to its isomer fructose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI).
  In step 3, the enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the conversion of fructose
  6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate using another ATP to transfer a phosphate
  group to fructose 6-phosphate. In step 4, Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA)
  splits fructose 1,6-bisphosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP, also glycerone
  phosphate) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). In step 5, triose-phosphate isomerase
  (TPI or TIM) catalyzes the reversible interconversion of DHAP and G3P. In step 6,
  G3P is converted to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GAPDH). In step 7, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) catalyzes the reversible
  transfer of the phosphate group from 1,3-BPG to ADP generating 3-phosphoglycerate
  (3-PG) and ATP. In step 8, the conversion of 3-PG to 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG) is
  catalyzed by phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM). In step 9, enolase (or phosphopyruvate
  hydratase) catalyzes the dehydration of 2-PG to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).
  In step 10, pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the transfer of the phosphate group from
  PEP to ADP, yielding pyruvate and ATP. In an acetyl-CoA metabolic pathway, acetyl-CoA
  synthetase (ACS) (or acetate : CoA ligase) catalyzes the interconversion between
  acetyl-CoA and acetate (Step 1′), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) reversibly catalyze
  the conversion of acetate into acetaldehyde (Step 2′) and alcohol dehydrogenase
  (ADH) facilitates the interconversion between aldehydes and alcohols (Step 3′).
  Cells with gray border lines in the upper rows represent differentially expressed
  unigenes in E8 compared to C and cells with green border lines in the lower rows
  represent differentially expressed unigenes in E24 compared to C. Relative levels
  of expression are showed by a color gradient from low (blue) to high (red)'
