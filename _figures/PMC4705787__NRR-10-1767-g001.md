caption: 'Protein propagation and secretion in neurodegeneration.Intracellular (cell
  1) accumulation of pathogenic or misfolded proteins triggers quality control clearance
  mechanisms. Route A–Protein can be ubiquitinated (Ub: Ubiquitin) and degraded via
  the proteasome. Route B–Autophagy is a major bulk degradation pathway. Accumulating
  proteins are first sequestered into a phagophore, which matures into a double-membrane
  autophagosome and fuses with the lysosome that contains digestive enzymes. If proteins
  are not degraded due to failure of the proteasome or autophagy, they may be secreted
  (Route C via exocytosis) into the synapse. Toxic proteins in the synaptic cleft
  may cross to (cell 2) an adjacent cell, resulting in trans-synaptic protein propagation.
  Extracellular or secreted proteins may be re-routed via the endosomal system and
  re-internalized into Cell 1 or destroyed by immune responses via activated microglia.
