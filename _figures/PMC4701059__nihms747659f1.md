caption: Regulation of sporulation, biofilm formation, cannibalism and genetic competence
  in B. subtilis. The phosphorylation state of Spo0A and its activity is regulated
  by the sporulation phosphorelay system that includes kinases KinA-E and two intermediate
  proteins Spo0F and Spo0B. High levels of Spo0A~P are required for transcription
  activation of early sporulation and competence genes. In contrast, low levels of
  Spo0A~P activate genes involved in cannibalism and biofilm formation. Rap proteins
  inhibit Spo0A by acting as phosphatases of Spo0F~P, whereas competence-specific
  Rap proteins inhibit ComA binding to DNA. In the case of Rap60, ComA activity is
  inhibited without perturbing ComA binding to DNA. Phr signaling peptides coordinate
  the physiological responses with population density. Pro-Phr peptides are exported
  into the environment where they are processed into mature signaling peptides by
  extracellular proteases Vpr, Epr and Subtilisin. Mature Phr peptides enter the cell
  through the oligopeptide permease Opp where they bind to and antagonize the activity
  of their cognate Rap proteins. Phr peptide production is regulated by Spo0A via
  the AbrB-SigH pathway. Arrows indicate positive regulation, and perpendicular lines
  indicate negative control. Solid lines represent regulation by protein–protein interactions,
  and dashed lines represent transcriptional responses.
