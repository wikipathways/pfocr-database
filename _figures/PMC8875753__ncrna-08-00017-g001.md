caption: MicroRNAs can regulate the inflammatory branch of L-arginine uptake and consumption
  of infected macrophages with Leishmania amazonensis. Cells use L-arginine as one
  of the markers of macrophage polarization into the M1 or M2 phenotypes. During infection
  with L. amazonensis, macrophages obtain L-arginine via Cationic Amino Acid Transporters
  1 and 2 (CAT1 and CAT2, encoded by the Solute Carrier Transporter family members
  Slc7a1 and Slc7a2). Once inside, the amino acid can be used by Nitric Oxide Synthase
  2 (NOS2) to produce the NO free radical, which kills the parasite when at high levels.
  L-citrulline is a side product of this reaction. Another use of L-arginine is its
  metabolism into urea and L-ornithine via Arginase 1 (ARG1). Once converted into
  L-ornithine, it starts the polyamine synthesis pathway, of which Ornithine Decarboxylase
  1 (ODC1) is the first branch enzyme. It is accepted that polyamines promote Leishmania
  survival and proliferation. L-arginine can also be transported to the mitochondrion,
  where it is also converted to urea and L-ornithine. However, the effects of this
  mitochondrial L-ornithine production are still poorly understood in the inflammatory
  context. This panel was created with BioRender.com online toll.
