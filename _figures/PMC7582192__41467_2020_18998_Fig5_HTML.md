caption: a Upon BCR activation, first the myristoylated SFK Lyn is recruited to the
  lipid raft domains of the plasma membrane containing the BCR, dephosphorylated Lyn
  at Y507 leads to its activation and autophosphorylation at Y396. This leads to the
  phosphorylation and activation of BTK at Y551 and Y223. Second, myristoylated HGAL
  is also recruited to the plasma membrane and phosphorylated thereby enhancing BCR
  signaling by stimulating SYK, BTK and the release of Ca++ ions from the endoplasmic
  reticulum via the inositol-3-phosphate ion channel receptor (IP3R). Altogether these
  early signaling events lead to transcription activation by c-Myc, P-ERK, NFκB, and
  CREB. b The NMT inhibitor PCLX-001 prevents the myristoylation of Lyn-SFK (as well
  as other SFKs not shown in this model), HGAL and Arf1 thereby impeding the proper
  membrane targeting and function of these proteins. PCLX-001 treatment impedes calcium
  homeostasis by reducing the BCR mediated Ca++ release from the ER and increasing
  basal Ca++ levels in cells in addition to promote the degradation of both myristoylated
  (Lyn, HGAL, Arf1) and, surprisingly, non-myristoylated proteins (NFκB, P-ERK, c-Myc
  and CREB), some via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway thereby further abrogating
  downstream BCR signaling and increasing ER stress leading to apoptosis and cell
  death.
