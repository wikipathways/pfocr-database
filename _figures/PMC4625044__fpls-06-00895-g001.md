caption: Major transcriptional regulatory networks of transcription factors involved
  in drought stress. Drought signal perception leads to activation of both abscisic
  acid (ABA)-dependent and ABA-independent pathways. In ABA-dependent pathway, accumulation
  of ABA leads to activation of sub class III SnRK2s through PYR/PYL/RCAR-PP2C receptor
  complex. Four transcription factors ABA-responsive element (ABRE) binding protein
  1 (AREB1), AREB2, ABRE binding factor 3 (ABF3), and ABF1 are mainly phosphorylated
  through sub class III SnRK2s under drought stress and regulate most of the downstream
  genes by binding to the ABRE cis-element present in their promoter region. In addition
  to this, ABA also modulates the activity of MYB/MYCs, NACs, WRKYs, and NF-Y transcription
  factors. MYC2 and NAC proteins are also involved in JA signaling. ABA signal perception
  leads to induction of WRKY18 and WRKY40 and their product could bind to W-box present
  in WRKY60 and thereby induce it. DREB2A plays a pivotal role in ABA-independent
  gene expression regulation under drought stress. DREB2A expression is regulated
  by GRF7 under unstressed condition. Additionally, DRIPs regulate levels of DREB2A
  protein under unstressed condition. DREB2A also participate in gene expression regulation
  under heat stress. Three DREB1 proteins, DREB1A, DREB1B, and DREB1C are the key
  factors regulating gene expression under cold stress. Some NAC transcription factors
  also regulate gene expression in ABA-independent manner. Recently, it has been reported
  that AREB/ABFs can induce DREB2A and AREB/ABFs interact with DREB2A, based on these
  observations, ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways are thought to crosstalk
  under drought stress. Apart from this, some recent reports suggest a possible interaction
  between NACs and AREB/ABFs. Transcription factors and DNA-binding proteins are shown
  in colored ellipses. Dashed lines indicate possible although unconfirmed routes.
