caption: Chlamydia/host tryptophan cycle. Solid arrows indicate conversion by the
  enzyme in green on the arrow; dotted arrows show movement across membranes. Induction
  of increased levels of tryptophan dioxygenase by IFN-γ causes flux of the host pool
  of tryptophan into the kynurenine pathway, causing starvation of Chlamydia parasites
  for tryptophan. Starvation for tryptophan presumably derepresses the trpR-regulated
  operon of tryptophan biosynthesis (trpBDCEbEa kynU kprS) in C. psittaci. The host-pathway
  enzymes of interest are located in the cytosol or are located in the mitochondrial
  compartment. Genes of tryptophan biosynthesis are named in the order of the pathway
  steps, following the nomenclature used by Xie et al. [30]. Thus, trpAa and trpAb
  (absent in C. psittaci) encode the large (aminase) and small (glutamine-binding)
  subunits of anthranilate synthase, trpB encodes anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase,
  trpC encodes phosphoribosyl-anthranilate isomerase, trpD encodes indoleglycerol
  phosphate synthase, and trpEa and trpEb encode the α and β subunits of tryptophan
  synthase, respectively. KynU encodes kynureninase. kprS (synonymous with prsA) encodes
  PRPP synthase. Orange arrows indicate induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and
  nitric oxide synthase by IFN-γ. Blue lines indicate inhibition of the latter two
  enzymes by nitric oxide and 3-hydroxyanthranilate, respectively.
