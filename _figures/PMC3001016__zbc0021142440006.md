caption: Models for proteolytic and allosteric activation of pro-HGF. The α-chain
  (tan) of inactive pro-HGF can mediate Met binding through a high affinity interaction
  site (Mα); however, it is not capable of signaling because the β-chain (green) resides
  in the pro-state with an exposed activation pocket (AP*) and an unoccupied Met binding
  site (Mβ*). Pro-HGF activation (top pathway) occurs upon proteolytic cleavage of
  the Arg494-Val495 peptide bond, resulting in insertion of the positively charged
  and hydrophobic N-terminal Val495 (blue triangle, white plus sign) into the β-chain
  activation pocket (AP) and rearrangement of the pseudoactive site for productive
  Met binding (Mβ). Met signaling requires HGF/Met dimerization by an as yet undetermined
  mechanism. In the case of peptide activators (bottom pathway), the N terminus of
  a peptide mimicking the β-chain N terminus (e.g. peptide V8) reversibly inserts
  into the β-chain activation pocket of pro-HGF and shifts the β-chain into an activated
  state capable of productive binding to Met. The peptide-bound form of pro-HGF is
  capable of Met signaling in the absence of proteolytic processing, presumably by
  a dimerization mechanism similar to that described above.
