caption: Diagram of the proposed LITAF signaling pathway. LITAF and STAT6B () are
  induced by P. gingivalis LPS via TLR-2 or by E. coli LPS via TLR-4. Their production
  is MyD88-dependent. Subsequently, they are phosphorylated by p38α before protein–protein
  interactions aimed at forming a complex. This phosphorylation leads to the sequestration
  of the complex in the cytoplasm before translocation of the molecules to the nucleus.
  In the nucleus, the complex most likely separates to allow for LITAF alone to bind
  to the specific sequence (CTCCC) () of various cytokine genes and thus to activate
  their transcription.
