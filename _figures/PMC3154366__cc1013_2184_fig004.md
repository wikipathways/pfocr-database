caption: c-Myc regulates the rate limiting steps at the entry into glycolysis. Both
  (A) glycolysis and (B) the TCA cycle were not significantly enriched in the functional
  classification analyses. However, although there were more downregulated genes in
  the glycolysis pathway, the two upregulated genes, hexokinase 2 (Hk2) and phosphofructokinase,
  platelet (Pfkp), encoded genes that catalyzed the rate-limiting steps in the pathway.
  Hence it is likely that glycolysis is upregulated upon c-Myc induction. In contrast,
  the two rate-limiting steps affecting the TCA cycle, catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydogenases
  (Pdh) and citrate synthase (Cs), were not regulated. These results suggested that
  there is an increase in glycolysis despite aerobic conditions, i.e., the Warburg
  effect. The dashed line in (A) marks a break in the image where several steps of
  the glycolytic pathway were omitted for clarity. The Figures were generated using
  the Cytoscape software, version 2.6.0.
