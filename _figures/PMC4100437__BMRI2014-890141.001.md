caption: A hypothetical model of chemoresistance in human ovarian cancer cells. In
  a chemosensitive ovarian cancer cell (a), cisplatin activates p53, leading to upregulation
  of proteins promoting cell cycle arrest, such as p21, and of proapoptotic proteins
  such as Bax and Fas. This activates both the intrinsic (mitochondrial) and the extrinsic
  (death-receptor) apoptotic pathways, the overall result of which is the activation
  of the execution caspase-3 (and caspase-7, not shown). In these cells, cell survival
  mediators such as Xiap, Akt, and Flip (shown in red) are downregulated or are in
  their inactive state. In chemoresistant cells (b), increased p53 ubiquitination
  by MDM2 results in the maintenance of low levels of p53, despite the presence of
  cisplatin. Moreover, cisplatin fails to downregulate Xiap, thereby maintaining an
  active state of the PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition, binding of TNFR2 by TNFα leads
  to upregulation of FLIP through the NF-κB pathway, thus inhibiting the proapoptotic
  actions of the cytokine through TNFR1. Overall, as a consequence of a failure to
  activate the caspase cascade in response to the chemotherapeutic agent, these cells
  have lost their capacity to undergo apoptosis and thus became chemoresistant. Taken
  from [].
