caption: Effect of PHY-mediated temperature perception on tomato metabolism regulation.
  The rise of AT shifts the balance to the inactive Pr form, which promotes the Chl
  degradation pathway in source leaves through the transcriptional up-regulation of
  Chl catabolic enzyme-associated genes. Additionally, reduced levels of Pfr impair
  carotenoid accumulation in both leaves and ripe fruits, through the transcriptional
  down-regulation of carotenoid biosynthetic and master ripening regulator genes.
