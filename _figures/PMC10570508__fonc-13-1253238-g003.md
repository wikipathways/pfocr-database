caption: PTP1B dephosphorylates and promotes the degradation of PITX1 via the proteasome
  pathway. As upstream of PITX1, PTP1B is directly involved in inhibiting the expression
  of PITX1, as shown in the magnification of the dashed circle area, PTP1B can dephosphorylate
  the 160, 175 and 179 sites of PITX1, making PITX1 unstable and degraded through
  the proteasome pathway, so that PITX1 cannot promote RASAL1-induced RAS inactivation
  and initiation of the p53 signaling pathway. Therefore, overexpression of PTP1B
  can inhibit PITX1-mediated cell cycle arrest and promote tumor cell survival.
