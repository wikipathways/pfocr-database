caption: 'The Rb pathway controls glutamine consumption in part through E2F-3 mediated
  regulation of the glutamine transporter, ASCT2. Intracellularly, glutamine has several
  downstream biochemical fates, including glutathione, as anaplerotic carbon for the
  TCA cycle, and as nucleotides and amino acids. The Rb cascade can modulate glutathione
  synthesis by regulating the expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCLC),
  which is the rate-limiting step in glutathione production. For TCA anaplerosis,
  glutamine is converted to glutamate in the mitochondria by glutaminase 1 (GLS1),
  another Rb-family regulated enzyme, and can enter the TCA cycle as α-ketoglutarate.
  Glutamine derived carbon, within the TCA, can be further metabolized to oxaloacetate
  for conversion to additional amino acids, or combined with acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) from
  pyruvate for citrate synthesis, which is a precursor for fatty acid (FA) production.
  Ultimately, through regulation of both glucose and glutamine metabolism, the Rb
  pathway may act to efficiently modulate cellular growth not only by controlling
  cell cycle progression, but also through facilitating the production of the energy
  and macromolecules required for cell division. ASCT2: sodium-dependent neutral amino
  acid transporter type 2; Cys: cysteine; NH4+: ammonium; GSH: reduced glutathione;
  Gln: glutamine; Glu: glutamate; TCA: tricarboxylate acid cycle'
