caption: Simplified inflammatory signaling of TLR, TNF, IFN and ILs in bone marrow
  failure While most of the TLRs are located on the surface of HSCs, some others keep
  intracellularly (TLR3/8/9). They all directly sense the inflammatory stimuli and
  induce macrophages to release the excess of TNF through the toll-interleukin-1 receptor
  (TIR) and the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-NF-κB pathway.
  IL-1 directly regulates HSC fate targeting also the NF- κB pathway. TLR4 can specifically
  activate the TIR-domain-containing the adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) via
  the TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) cross talking with the TNF signaling, paving
  the way for necroptosis trough the RIPK1/3- MLKL pathway. The products resulting
  from necroptosis constitute the DAMPs and feed-forward the caspase cascade. A large
  amount of TNF may also cause the accumulation of ROS, stimulating immune cells to
  release IFNs. After the activation of TNFR, TNFR1-associated death domain protein
  (TRADD) is bound, recruiting the adaptor Fas-associated death domain (FADD) triggering
  the caspase-8/3 receptor complex, inducing at the end apoptosis. The IFN signal,
  which is regulated by Irf2 and Batf2, leads also to apoptosis via the Fas pathway
  (FADD), being also perturb the phosphorylation state of STAT5. Moreover, IFN may
  also lead to an increased mitochondrial ROS, inducing DNA damage. Finally, IFNs
  are required for an increased in the compromising IL-18 expression, which mediates
  the MLKL-dependent cell death, compromising hematopoiesis during infection. (Created
