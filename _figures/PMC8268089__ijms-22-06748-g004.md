caption: Crosstalk between nucleus and mitochondria in premature ageing and AD. Nuclear
  DNA damage can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. One of the pathways through which
  the nucleus regulates mitochondrial function is the PARP1–NAD+–SIRT1 signaling pathway.
  NAD+ plays an important role as a reaction substrate in various pathways of DDR.
  Together, these contribute to ageing and the neurodegeneration in accelerated ageing.
  Black arrows indicate promotion, and inverted T bars indicate repression. Red arrows
  indicate up- or downregulation.
