caption: . A scheme illustrating that deregulation of neuronal and oligodendrocyte
  (OGD) proteins are associated with the neurodegenerative pathology of chronic traumatic
  encephalopathy (CTE). Repetitive closed head injury, so called non-penetrating traumatic
  brain injury (TBI) or blunt TBI in human, alters axonal guidance signaling-related
  proteome signatures in both neurons (such as CFL1 and 2, and TUBB3) and oligodendrocytes
  (such as MAG and TUBB4). Consequently, the dysfunction of axonal guidance signaling
  pathway leads to impaired myelination and neurodegeneration that are associated
  with the white matter pathology in CTE patients.
