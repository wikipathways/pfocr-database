caption: The glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway. The cytosolic glucocorticoid
  receptor alpha (GRα) is associated with several chaperone proteins including heat-shock
  protein (HSP) 70, HOP, and HSP 90. After the recruitment of p23 and displacement
  of HSP 70 and HOP into the complex, the GRα achieves “client-maturation” and is
  able to bind to glucocorticoids (GCs). Immunophilins influence the affinity of GC
  binding with FKBP51 decreasing GC-GRα affinity and FKBP52 increasing GC-GRα affinity.
  These chaperone proteins facilitate the translocation of GC-GRα to the nucleus.
  The nuclear GC-GRα complex monomer, together with other transcription factors (TFs),
  functions as a transrepressor to inhibit gene expression. The GC-GR complex may
  also dimerize and function as a transactivator to increase gene expression. The
  GR beta (GRβ) is an alternatively spliced, dominant negative form of GRα. Created
