caption: Outline of the Asp family biosynthetic pathway including the branch point
  at OPH between Met biosynthesis and that of Thr and Ile. The stimulation of TS activity
  by SAM, negative feedback regulation of CGS according to Met levels, and feedback
  inhibition of Thr dehydratase (TD) by Ile are indicated as dashed lines.
