caption: Cause and metabolic consequences of fatty liver. Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia
  induce hepatic de novo lipogenesis via carbohydrate response element–binding protein
  (ChREBP) and sterol regulatory element–binding protein (SREBP)-1c, respectively,
  thereby increasing the hepatic pool of fatty acyl-CoAs. This pool is also increased
  by augmented delivery of free fatty acids (FFAs) either through the diet or lipolysis
  in adipose tissue. Fatty acyl-CoAs are assembled to TAGs that remain in the liver
  or are secreted in the form of VLDLs. The latter pathway is regulated by several
  factors, among them the two enzymes SCD1 and DGAT2 as well as the microsomal transfer
  protein (MTP) and the availability of apoliprotein B (ApoB). ELOVL6 and PNPLA3/adiponutrin
  are also involved in the process of hepatic TAG storage, while specific mechanisms
  of action are not fully understood. Finally, a low activity of the ATGL also results
  in storage of fatty acyl-CoAs in the form of TAGs, thereby contributing to the detoxification
  of hepatic lipids. This process can also be accelerated by hepatic oxidation of
  fatty acyl-CoAs involving the transcription factors PPAR-α and -δ. In addition,
  the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is involved. The adipokine adiponectin stimulates
  FA oxidation via AMPK activation and PPAR-α induction. AMPK is also involved in
  the suppression of lipogenesis. When these mechanisms of detoxification are overwhelmed
  or not active, lipotoxicity prevails resulting in hepatic inflammation and insulin
  resistance. Via dysregulation of secreted hepatokines (e.g., fetuin-A, SHBG, selenoprotein
  P), increased glucose production and dyslipidemia, fatty liver then also induces
  systemic subclinical inflammation, whole-body insulin resistance, hyperglycemia,
  and ultimately the manifestation of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
