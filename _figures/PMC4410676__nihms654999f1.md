caption: 'In CKD, progressive loss of nephrons generates humoral signals that activate
  a slow neuromodulatory pathway in the brain. The slow pathway raises preganglionic
  SNA and circulating EO. The sustained elevation of circulating EO (red dashed lines)
  amplifies ganglionic function [1] and raises postganglionic sympathetic nerve activity,
  enhances the effect of sympathetic nerve activity [2] in the vascular wall, and
  directly amplifies Ca2+signaling [3] in arterial myocytes. Block of angiotensin
  II receptors, or MR, or EO in the brain may normalize downstream events. Elements
  of the pathway have been demonstrated in rodents and portions have been shown in
  human tissue. The mechanism by which activation of the CNS slow pathway raises plasma
  EO may involve ACTH. The relative contribution of adrenal and brain EO to the elevated
  circulating EO in CKD is not known. Elevated circulating MBG is shown as secondary
  to volume expansion (no data demonstrate CNS control of MBG); renal ischemia may
  trigger MBG. In the scheme presented, sustained increases in MBG and EO elevate
  BP and also promote renal and cardiac damage that enhances the progression of renal
  failure. The signaling pathways for the fibrotic effects have been described elsewhere,.
  This feed-forward mechanism provides further stimulus to circulating EO and MBG
  and may accelerate progression to complete failure. Maneuvers that block EO and
  MBG ameliorate this cycle of events,,. Yellow horizontal bars: potential sites for
  acute antagonism by canrenone. White stars: sites of synaptic plasticity. The same
