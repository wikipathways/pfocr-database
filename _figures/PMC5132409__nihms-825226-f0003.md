caption: 'Retinoid transformations and enzymes of the classical and intraretinal visual
  cycles. (Left) The classical visual cycle involving enzymes located in the RPE and
  photoreceptor outer segments. This pathway supports both rod and cone cell function.
  (Right) Reactions comprising the putative intraretinal visual cycle that provides
  cones with a privileged source of 11-cis-RAL. This pathway is thought to involve
  enzymes located in Müller glia and cone photoreceptors. Candidate enzymes of the
  pathway are shown in blue and marked by asterisks to indicate that their physiological
  involvement in the pathway has not yet been established. Abbreviations: DES1, dihydroceramide
  desaturase 1; hv, light; LRAT, lecithin:retinol acyltransferase; MFAT, multifunctional
  O-acyltransferase; RAL, retinal; RDH, retinol dehydrogenase; RE, retinyl ester;
  ROL, retinol; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium.'
