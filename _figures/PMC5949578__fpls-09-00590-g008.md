caption: A proposed model for dual Ci signaling pathways in Chlorella sp. ArM0029B.
  In Chlorella sp. ArM0029B, expression of CCM genes is suppressed by high concentration
  of intracellular Ci mostly derived from the acetate assimilatory pathway. Under
  this photoheterotrophic growth conditions, bicarbonate sensing and signaling pathway
  (blue line) are not operating. When high concentration of  is exogenously provided,
  this bicarbonate pathway becomes active. Constitutive operation of CCM machinery
  observed in CAC1 mutant implicates that CAC1 suppresses Ci signaling pathway to
  the CCM genes (red line). Failure of high exogenous CO2 in CCM activation implicates
  the presence of membranous CO2 transporter that allows CO2 entry fast enough not
  to be hydrated by external CAHs. Thus, dual signaling pathways for external bicarbonate
  and internal Ci to the CCM apparatus are probably present in Chlorella sp. ArM0029B.
  CAH, carbonic anhydrase; Ci, inorganic carbon; LCI, low CO2 inducible protein.
