caption: Different ncRNAs regulate PDCD4 in mutiple ways. (i) miRNAs target PDCD4
  directly to promote tumor progression via several pathways. Briefly, PDCD4 reduces
  the expression of Snail directly or by NF-κB/Akt pathway and leads to up-regulation
  of E-cadherin, inhibition of β-catenin dependent transcription, and decrease of
  the expression of c-Myc and uPAR. Down-regulated c-Myc subsequently inhibits MAP4K1
  expression, thereby inhibiting AP-1 transcription to impede proliferation, promotion,
  and invasion. PDCD4 could decrease CDK4/6 via the upregulation of p21, thus leading
  to reduced cell proliferation. (ii) LncRNAs could function as oncogene and downregulate
  PDCD4 expression by recruiting EZH2. (iii) LncRNAs could also function as tumor
  suprefessor to sponge miRNAs, which may counteract the effects of miRNAs on PDCD4.
