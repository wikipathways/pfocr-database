caption: Signaling pathway for ICOS costimulation in TFH cell differentiation. For
  TFH cell differentiation, ICOS-mediated recruitment of PI3K has a dual role in transcriptional
  regulation of genes. On the one hand, the activation of PI3K causes activation of
  Akt and subsequently inhibits the transcription factor Foxo1 function through phosphorylation-mediated
  cytosolic retention. The inhibition of Foxo1 upregulates Bcl-6 and downregulates
  KLF2, which both are crucial transcriptional regulators controlling the expression
  of TFH signature genes. On the other hand, the regulatory subunit p85α of PI3K can
  bind with the intracellular form of osteopontin (OPNi), whereafter OPNi migrates
  into the nucleus and binds to Bcl-6 which can protect Bcl-6 from ubiquitin-dependent
  degradation and regulate the expression of TFH signature genes.
