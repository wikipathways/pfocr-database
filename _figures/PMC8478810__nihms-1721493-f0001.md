caption: '[Left] Lack of Wnt signaling permits stabilization of the Axin-Apc complex,
  which facilitates phosphorylation of β-catenin by Gsk3 and Ck1. Phosphorylated β-catenin
  is subsequently ubiquitin-tagged for proteosome degradation, and consequently does
  not accumulate in the cytoplasm in sufficient quantities to allow translocation
  to the nucleus. [Right] Activated Wnt signaling occurs through Wnt binding and complexing
  of Lrp5/6 with Frizzled. Formation of the trimeric receptor–ligand complex induces
  degredation of the Axin complex. Loss of the β-catenin degradation machinery allows
  β-catenin to remain stable (unphosphorylated) and accumulate in the cytoplasm, to
  the point where translocation to the nucleus occurs and gene transcription is initiated.'
