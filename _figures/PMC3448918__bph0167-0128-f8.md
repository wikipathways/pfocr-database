caption: Proposed mechanism for D10G-mediated suppression of NF-κB-regulated gene
  expression. D10G directly inhibits IKKβ activity, catalysing IκBα phosphorylation
  in the cytoplasm of macrophages activated by TLR2/6, TLR4 or TLR5 agonist. This
  mechanism of action disrupts downstream signalling events such as IκBα degradation
  and the nuclear import of NF-κB in the canonical pathway of NF-κB activation and
  sequentially suppresses NF-κB-regulated expression of iNOS, COX-2 and IL-6.
