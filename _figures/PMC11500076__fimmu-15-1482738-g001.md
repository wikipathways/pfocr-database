caption: The STING signaling pathway. Activated STING undergoes conformational changes,
  engaging TBK1 and IRF3. TBK1, forming a homodimer, interacts with two STING molecules,
  inducing a conformational shift that releases the C-terminal tail of STING. This
  enables recruitment and activation of TBK1, leading to phosphorylation of serine
  366 of the STING C-terminal tail. Phosphorylated IRF3 undergoes homodimerization,
  translocates to the nucleus, and triggers the transcription of type I interferon
  (IFN) and other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The STING-TBK1-IRF3 axis acts
  as a critical link in antiviral defense, orchestrating IFN production to curb viral
  replication and spread. Importantly, the STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway also intersects
  with canonical NF-κB signaling (Created with Biorender)
