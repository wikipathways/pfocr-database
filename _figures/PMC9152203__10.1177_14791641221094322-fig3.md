caption: The most enriched interaction network of the differentially expressed proteins
  in liraglutide pre-treatment compared to the post-treatment states. Red nodes indicate
  upregulated expression; green nodes indicate downregulated expression. The central
  nodes of the pathway related to signaling of the NFKB, ERK1/2, and P38 MAPK were
  found to be deregulated between the two states. Uncolored nodes are proposed by
  ingenuity pathway analysis and indicate potential targets that were functionally
  coordinated with the differentially expressed proteins. Solid lines indicate direct
  molecular interactions, and dashed lines represent indirect interactions.

  description: The most enriched interaction network of the differentially expressed
    proteins in liraglutide pre-treatment compared to the post-treatment states. Red
    nodes indicate upregulated expression; green nodes indicate downregulated expression.
    The central nodes of the pathway related to signaling of the NFKB, ERK1/2, and
    P38 MAPK were found to be deregulated between the two states. Uncolored nodes
    are proposed by ingenuity pathway analysis and indicate potential targets that
