caption: miR501-5p functions as a balance in the modulation of cell survival and apoptosis
  in clear cell renal carcinoma. The overexpression of miR501-5p promoted cell growth
  and survival by activation of mTOR signaling. The reduction of miR501-5p expression
  caused the activation of the apoptotic pathway by p53 activation and mTOR inhibition.
