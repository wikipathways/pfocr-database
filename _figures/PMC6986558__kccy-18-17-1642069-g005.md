caption: Schematic illustration of synergistic crosstalk between hypoxia and TGF-β
  signaling pathway. VHL inhibits expression of ALK5 protein by targeting it for proteasomal
  degradation [], and expression of HIF-1α/2α under normoxic conditions. Hypoxic conditions
  increase the expression of HIF-1α/HIF-2α and ALK5. ALK5, through its kinase activity,
  increases the expression of HIF-1α/HIF-2α under normoxic conditions. Physical interaction
  between ALK5 and HIF-1α/HIF-2α produces a synergistic effect to promote tumor progression
  and leads to poor prognosis for patients with ccRCC.
