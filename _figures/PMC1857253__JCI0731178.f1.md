caption: (A) IDO catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in the degradation of
  tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway. Tryptophan metabolites have been shown
  to have immunomodulatory activity, alone or in combination with the GCN2 signaling
  pathway. (B) IDO enzymatic activity results in the local depletion of tryptophan
  and a local increase in the concentration of downstream metabolites. The decrease
  in tryptophan can cause a rise in the level of uncharged transfer RNA (tRNA) in
  neighboring T cells, resulting in activation of the amino acid–sensitive GCN2 stress-kinase
  pathway. In turn, GCN2 signaling can cause cell cycle arrest and anergy induction
  in responding T cells. The local increase in tryptophan metabolites can cause cell
  cycle arrest, apoptosis, and (in conjunction with GCN2 signaling) differentiation
  of new Tregs from uncommitted CD4+ T cells.
