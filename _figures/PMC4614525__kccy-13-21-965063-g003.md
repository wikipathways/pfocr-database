caption: (See previous page). Some cellular processes in chronologically aging yeast
  are integrated into a biomolecular network. A stepwise progression of the network
  through a series of lifespan checkpoints existing in logarithmic (L), diauxic (D),
  post-diauxic (PD) and stationary (ST) growth phases is monitored by master regulator
  proteins. At each of the lifespan checkpoints, certain checkpoint-specific master
  regulator proteins respond to age-related changes in the intracellular concentrations
  of some key metabolites by modulating the rates and efficiencies of the longevity-defining
  cellular processes integrated into the network. Such action of master regulator
  proteins establishes the pace of cellular aging and defines yeast chronological
  lifespan. Activation arrows and inhibition bars signify pro-aging processes (shown
  in green color) or anti-aging processes (shown in red color). Pro-aging or anti-aging
  master regulator proteins are presented in green color or red color, respectively.
  Pro-aging or anti-aging metabolites are displayed in green color or red color, respectively.
