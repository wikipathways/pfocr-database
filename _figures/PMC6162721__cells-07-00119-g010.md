caption: Possible mechanism of action of Nlrp12 in regulating early TCR signaling
  pathways, T cell activation and proliferation. Activation signals from TCR activates
  multiple downstream signaling pathways in T cells, presented as (1) NFAT, (2) NF-κB,
  (3) MAPK and (4) mTOR pathways. These pathways lead to nuclear translocation of
  NFAT, NF-κB and AP1 transcription factors and IL-2 transcription. IL-2 binds to
  its receptor on the cell surface and initiates mTOR pathway. TCR activating signals
  induce the expression of Nlrp12 that consequently inhibits NF-κB and MAPK signaling
  pathways, which suppress IL-2 production. Upstream of NF-κB pathway, Nlrp12 inhibits
  Akt phosphorylation that controls NF-κB signaling on one side and mTOR activity
  and cell cycle progression on the other side. Taken together, Nlrp12 has a broad
  range of regulatory activity that controls hyper-proliferation and activation of
  T cells. The pathways shown in dashed lines are not affected by Nlrp12 including
  NFAT signaling and mTOR/S6 phosphorylation.
