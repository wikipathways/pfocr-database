caption: mAKAPβ coordinates hypertrophic signaling leading to cardiac gene remodeling.
  mAKAPβ is predominantly localized at the cardiomyocyte outer nuclear membrane through
  interaction with nesprin-1α. β-AR stimulation will result in the production of cAMP
  through Gs-coupled activation of mAKAPβ-bound adenylyl cyclase (AC5), likely present
  on transverse tubules adjacent to the nucleus. cAMP synthesis promotes mAKAP-bound
  PKA activation, leading to the phosphorylation of multiple substrates, including
  the RyR2, acting to potentiate Ca2+-induced RyR2 Ca2+ release. Local Ca2+ may activate
  mAKAP-associated PP2B (calcineurin Aβ), which will dephosphorylate the transcription
  factor NFATc, resulting in NFATc nuclear translocation and hypertrophic gene expression.
  cAMP metabolism is tightly regulated by the mAKAP signaling complex. PKA phosphorylates
  both AC5 and PDE4D3, inhibiting local cAMP production and increasing cAMP degradation,
  respectively. PKA also phosphorylates and stimulates PP2A, opposing PKA phosphorylation
  of PDE4D3, leading to greater, longer lasting cAMP signals. ERK5 will also phosphorylate
  and inhibit PDE4D3, thereby promoting PKA activity. α1-Adrenergic and gp130/leukemia
  inhibitory factor receptor (LIF-R) stimulation will result in MEK5 and ERK5 activation
  through a JAK/STAT/Ras/Raf pathway. Other substrates for mAKAPβ-associated ERK5
  have not yet been identified. For simplicity, only a single mAKAP molecule is depicted.
