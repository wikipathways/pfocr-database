caption: 'Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway deregulation alters the cell stage composition
  of dentate gyrus (DG) in Ptch1+/– mice.(A) Schematic representation of adult neurogenesis
  in the hippocampal DG and relative stage specific markers with representative immunostaining
  images and (B) quantification for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Sex determining
  region Y (SRY) box 2 (Sox2), doublecortin (DCX), and mature granule (NeuN) at 8
  months of age. Upward and downward arrows respectively represent an increase or
  deacrease in the number of labelled cells in Ptch1+/– compared to wild-type (WT)
  mice. Images, 20× magnification, scale bar: 50 µm; 100× magnification, scale bar:
  10 µm. The number of mice used per test is indicated in the graphs (n). Data are
  reported as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 for comparison with controls (Student’s
  t-test). Modified from Antonelli et al. (2018). Ptch1: Patched1.'
