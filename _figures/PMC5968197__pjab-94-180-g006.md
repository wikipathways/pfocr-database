caption: Dual-lock for G1-phase arrest in unfertilized mature starfish eggs. Unless
  fertilized, mature starfish eggs arrest at G1-phase after the completion of meiosis
  II. This arrest is accomplished through two separate pathways that function downstream
  of Mos–MAPK signaling. One is a Rsk-mediated pathway that prevents entry into S-phase
  by inhibiting Cdc45 loading onto the DNA replication machinery. The initiation of
  DNA replication is thus blocked by Rsk at the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) stage,
  prior to the subsequent pre-initiation complex (pre-IC) stage just before the actual
  start of DNA replication. The other is an Rsk-unmediated pathway that prevents entry
  into the first mitotic M-phase by inhibiting new protein synthesis of cyclin A and
  cyclin B. Due to the absence of a DNA replication checkpoint, this dual-lock mechanism
  is required for G1 arrest. Upon fertilization, Mos degradation releases the dual-lock,
  resulting in the start of the embryonic mitotic cycle. MCM, MCM complex.
