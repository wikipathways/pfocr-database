caption: Schematics illustrate the cellular and molecular mechanisms directing AVN
  and trabeculae CM formation discovered in zebrafish. (A) Endocardial Notch and neuregulin
  signaling are required for AVN CM formation (). Meanwhile canonical Wnt signaling
  is crucial for AVN CM formation by activating myocardial BMP4 and Tbx2b expression
  (). ECM-related factors, including HA, Nephronectin and 3-O-sulfated HSPG, limit
  the distribution of canonical Wnt signaling or BMP4 to confine AVN CM differentiation
  within the AVC (; ; ). (B) Endocardial Notch signaling and Nrg2a is activated by
  blood flow/contractility, which is received by Erbb2/4 receptor in the CMs to induce
  trabeculation (; ; ; ; ). Erbb2 signaling further activates Notch signaling in the
  neighboring CMs, which acts cell autonomously to inhibits Erbb2 signaling to establish
  the compact wall architecture necessary for trabeculation (). Erbb2 signaling also
  preserves the architecture of the compact wall by regulating the nuclear localization
  of Wwtr1, a Hippo pathway effector ().
