caption: Schematic representation of Hsp90 signaling pathway in Aspergillus sp. Calcineurin
  is chaperoned by Hsp90, which stabilizes it. There seems to be a number of physical
  interactions between calcineurin and Hsp90, but our understanding of these interactions
  is currently limited (more evidence is available for Candida and less for Aspergillus).
  Protein kinase C (pkcA) is an Hsp90 client (there is also evidence of at least genetic
  cross-talk between CnA and pkcA). Heat shock response is initiated by the calcium
  channel MidA, which acts as a stress sensor. The stress signals are integrated by
  Rom2, which is regarded as the first upstream activator of the cell wall integrity
  pathway and is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Rom2 activates the Rho1
  GTPase, which in turn activates pkcA (Rho1 is also an Hsp90 client) [,]. The latter
  triggers activation in cascade o Bck1 (bypass of protein kinase C), Mkk2 (mitogen-activated
  kinase kinase), and Mpka (a MAPK, client of Hsp90, known to regulate the expressions
  of α-1,3-glucan synthase genes). Mpka could also be activated by Wsc 1,2,3 proteins,
  which are general stress sensors at cell wall levels in fungi, although direct evidence
  in Aspergillus seems not to be available yet []. MpkA is translocated to the nucleus,
  where it activates, by phosphorylation, the RlmA transcription factor, whose activity
  is necessary for the transcription of genes encoding enzymes responsible for cell
  wall formation and which is also an Hsp90 partner []. Furthermore, Hsp90 is somehow
  involved in activating the expression of brlA (possibly also of abaA and wetA).
  In its turn, BrlA regulates other genes involved in conidiation, among which the
  most important seem to be abaA and wetA.
