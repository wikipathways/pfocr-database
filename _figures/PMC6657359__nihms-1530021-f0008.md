caption: On the right, the pathway from cardiac progenitor cell to Tbx18+/Isl1+/Nkx2–5−
  right sinus horn progenitor to endogenous pacemaker cell is shown. Previous work
  has established that Isl1, Shox2, Tbx3, and Tbx18 have instructive roles during
  developmental pacemaker formation. Cardiac progenitor cells can alternatively give
  rise to atrial myocytes (AM) and ventricular myocytes (VM) as depicted by orange
  and blue arrows, respectively. On the left is a proposed pathway for iPM reprogramming
  by GHMT. GMT alone is capable of converting fibroblasts into iAMs and iVMs (gray
  arrows), whereas GHMT augments iAM and iVM production and uniquely promotes iPM
  formation (purple arrow). In this study, we show that Hand2 partially activates
  the developmental pacemaker gene regulatory network via Tbx3 and Tbx8 (purple-green
  shading). However, Isl1 and Shox2 remain inactive after GHMT infection of fibroblasts
  (green shading), and exogenous Isl1 and Shox2 can each promote iPM formation. Hand2
  also coordinates activation of various core pacemaker marker genes, such as Hcn4
  (purple-green shading), and we uncovered an iPM desmosome gene battery (purple shading).
