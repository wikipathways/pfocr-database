caption: Fig. 7. Role of p21 in directing cell cycle exit after DNA damage in G2.
  In response to DNA damage (bleomycin) and the inhibition of topoisomerase II (ICRF-193),
  ATM and ATR kinases, respectively, are activated (). In E6 cells, the inactivation
  of Cdc25 via the ATR pathway by ICRF-193 is less efficient. Cell cycle arrest is
  accomplished by a network of enzymes that block activation of the mitotic kinases
  cyclin A–Cdk1 and cyclin B1–Cdk1. The question mark refers to the fact that the
  role of p21 in inactivating cyclin B1–Cdk1 complexes is less well established. In
  addition to blocking activation of mitotic kinases, p21 also inactivates Cdks involved
  in the hyperphosphorylation of pocket proteins (PP) of the retinoblastoma family
  (pRb, p107 and p130) leading to the accumulation of hypophosphorylated (active)
  pocket proteins. The resulting sequestration of transcription factors of the E2F
  family would block transcription of a number of genes involved in G2/M progression
  (; ), thereby driving cell cycle exit in G2. In mouse fibroblasts and tumour-derived
  cell lines, the exit is accomplished only after mitosis but before cytokinesis,
  giving rise to tetraploid cells (2G1 exit; cf. ). The model also shows that, in
  the case of ICRF-193-induced G2 arrest, the inactivation of Cdc25 pathways is less
  efficient than that provoked by double-strand DNA breaks (bleomycin).
