caption: 'CXCR4, a marker of migrating cancer stem cells. CXCR4 becomes activated
  by SDF1 binding, which in concert with CD44, integrins and HSP initiates several
  signaling cascades that promote directed motility. CXCR4 also activates the PI3K/Akt
  pathway promoting antiapoptotic protein activation and prosurvival gene transcription.
  Activated CXCR4 becomes recruited into GEM, where in Pa-CSC the association with
  Tspan8 supports internalization. CXCR4 is recovered in TEX. In Pa-CSC CXCR4 cooperates
  with CD44(v6), laminin binding integrins and Tspan8 in TEM and is recruited into
  TEX. CSC: Cancer stem cells; GEM: Glycolipid-enriched microdomains; NFκB: Nuclear
  factor κB; TEX: Tumor exosomes; HSP: Heat shock protein; PLC: Phospholipase C; PKC:
  Phophokinase C; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bophosphate 3 kinase; MAPK: Mitogen-activazed
  protein kinase; SDF1: Stroma-derived factor 1.'
