caption: Serotonin is synthesized in the pulmonary arterial endothelial cells by tryptophan
  hydroxylase1 (Tph1). Serotonin can then influence pulmonary vascular smooth muscle
  proliferation and/or contraction via activity at the serotonin transporter (SERT)
  and serotonin receptors (particularly the 5-HT1B receptor in humans). Intracellular
  accumulation of serotonin and activation of the 5-HT1B receptor may induce reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), activation of Rho-kinase (ROCK), leading to phosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. Once inside
  the nucleus phosphorylated ERK1/2 can increase transcription of nuclear growth factors
  and mediate cellular proliferation. Activation of the bone morphogenetic receptor
  type II (BMPR-II) leads to signalling through the Smad 1/5/8 pathway. Smads1, 5
  and 8 must dimerize with Smad 4 to enter the nucleus where they can activate anti-proliferative
  transcription factors. Serotonin may antagonize BMPR-II signalling as phosphorylated
  ERK1/2 can phosphorylate the linker region of Smad 1and inhibit nuclear translocation.
