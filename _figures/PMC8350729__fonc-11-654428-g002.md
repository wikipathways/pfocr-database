caption: Mechanisms of the anticancer activity of salinomycin in breast cancer (BC)
  cells. Salinomycin inhibits cell proliferation in BC cells through the Hedgehog
  and Wnt signaling pathways. Additionally, salinomycin is capable of inhibiting Wnt
  signaling by blocking the phosphorylation of LRP6 or by ER stress, which leads to
  apoptosis in BC cells. Moreover, salinomycin induces the apoptosis of BC cells by
  increasing DNA damage or intracellular ROS level, thereby influencing the p53 and
  caspase cascade separately. Salinomycin also induces autophagy by increasing intracellular
  ROS level, which is accompanied by MAPK signaling pathway activation. Furthermore,
  salinomycin can affect the cell membrane potential and reduce the level of ATP to
  induce mitophagy and mitoptosis. Moreover, salinomycin inhibits angiogenesis through
  the VEGF signaling pathway.
