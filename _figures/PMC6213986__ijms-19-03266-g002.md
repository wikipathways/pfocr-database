caption: 'Pharmacodynamic mechanism of TCM against HSV-1. Anti-HSV-1 effects of TCM
  are mainly concentrated on the following three aspects: (i) TCM counteracts HSV-1
  by regulating autophagy. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) functions as a negative
  autophagy regulator. LFE can induce autophagy via decreasing the phosphorylation
  of mTOR and p70S6K (ribosomal p70S6 kinase). Consequently, Beclin-1 and LC3 (microtubule-associated
  protein 1 light chain 3)-II are activated, leading to autophagy-mediated clearance
  of HSV-1 []; (ii) TCM exerts anti-viral effects by enhancing immunity. For instance,
  as ingredients in the HCWEs, quercetin (1) and isoquercitrin (2) inhibit NF-κB (nuclear
  factor-kappa B) activation []. Dpo (32) also improves the organism’s immunity against
  HSV-1 in a STING-dependent manner, hence contributing to a sustained and significant
  increase in IRF7 (interferon regulatory factor 7) []. Similarly, APS (33) (astragalus
  polysaccharide) promots immunological function by markedly increasing the expression
  of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α), IL-6 (interleukin-6), TLR3 (toll-like receptor
  3), and NF-κB provoked by HSV-1 []. From another perspective, IRF3 (interferon regulatory
  factor 3) can also be phosphorylated, and phosphorylated IRF3 activated type I interferon
  expression by binding to ISRE (interferon-stimulated response element) []. However,
  after autophagy-dependent STING delivery of TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) to endosomal/lysosomal
  compartments, provoked ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) can subsequently
  inhibit STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) function by phosphorylation S366,
  and IRF3 function is suppressed, thus preventing the persistent transcription of
  innate immune genes []. Mitochondria, the main organelles in eukaryotic cells, play
  an important role in antiviral process partially due to the mitochondrial localiazation
  of MAVS (Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein). Interestingly, the NEMO (the
  regulatory subunit of the IKK complex) dependent cGAS-MAVS-TBK1 signaling pathway
  is essential for IRF3 and NF-κB activation []; and (iii) TCM exerts antiviral effects
  by inhibiting HSV-1 replication or inactivation of HSV-1 in the process of viral
  attachment/absorption/penetration. HCWEs and quercetin (1) inhibit the infection
  of HSV-1 via blocking of viral binding and penetration. Additionally, HCWEs, Norcepharadione
  B (3), and curcumin (35) can inhibit viral replication [,,]. Notoginsenoside ST-4
  (21) prevents HSV-1 from penetrating into cells and effectively blocks the synthesis
  of vp5 []. NN-B-5 interrupts the formation of αTIF/C1/Oct-1/GARAT multiprotein/DNA
  complexes, resulting in reduced expression of ICP0 (infected cell polypeptide 0)
  and ICP4 []. HSV-1, which can escape from various antiviral pathways, can cascade
  linearly and express immediate early (IE), early (E), and late (L) genes. After
  expression of the L gene, the cells produce a large number of mature viral particles,
  causing the cells to rupture and die. Bold numbers in parentheses refer to the numbers
  of corresponding compounds.'
