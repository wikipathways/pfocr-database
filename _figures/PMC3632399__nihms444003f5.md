caption: a. The induction of pro-angiogenic growth factors (vascular endothelial growth
  factor A (VEGFA) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)) by RAS in neoplastic cells
  is shown. RAS enhances the transcription of VEGFA by recruiting transcription factors
  such as SP1, SP2, AP2 and ETS to the VEGFA promoter. RAS also increases the stability
  of VEGFA mRNA and augments its translation–. The RAS–JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK)
  signalling axis is responsible for upregulating the transcription of prostaglandin-endoperoxide
  synthase 2 (PTGS2), which encodes COX2, by activating JUN, a component of the AP1
  transcription complex, whereas the RAS–ERK1 and ERK2 pathway contributes to COX2
  expression through the phosphorylation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-β (C/EBPβ)
  and ETS transcription factors such as PEA3 (REFS –). Expression of COX2, in turn,
  increases the levels of VEGFA produced by RAS-transformed cells. b. The release
  of proteases by neoplastic cells cleaves components of the extracellular matrix
  (ECM) and releases VEGFA and FGF2, which are trapped in the ECM. Expression of proteases
  urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and
  MMP9 in RAS-transformed cells is increased by the combined effects of ETS transcription
  factors (activated by the RAF–ERK pathway) and JUN (activated by the RAC–JNK pathway)
  binding to the promoters of PEA3–AP1 sites, as well as enhanced translation of polysome-associated
  MMP9 mRNA,,. Stimulation of uPA expression is also dependent on RAS-mediated activation
  of RAL GTPase,. This induces neo-proliferation and sprouting of microvessels towards
  the tumour site. c. The recruitment of macrophages by neoplastic cells (through
  RAS-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent production of the cytokines interleukin-6
  (IL-6) and IL-8) and subsequent promotion of endothelial proliferation and sprouting
  by newly recruited macrophages is shown.
