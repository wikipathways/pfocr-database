caption: A comparison of the regulatory mechanism for stem cell control between angiosperms
  and mosses. In the angiosperm shoot apical meristem (SAM), the WUSCHEL-CLAVATA (WUS-CLV)
  signaling module plays a central role in stem cell maintenance. WUS is directly
  promoted by cytokinin signaling, and cytokinin biosynthesis is under the control
  of Class I KNOX (KNOXI). Auxin triggers organ differentiation but it also acts synergistically
  with cytokinin through suppression of type-A ARR (A-ARR) by Monopterous (MP). In
  addition, auxin controls expression of APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ER)
  transcription factors such as AINTEGMENTA/PLETHORA (AIL/PLT), which are involved
  in pluripotency of the stem cell. Outside the stem cells, ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1)
  and ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2) recruit the Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) and stably
  repress KNOXI expression. On the other hand, in mosses, the WUS-CLV signaling module
  does not exist. However, cytokinin promotes stem cell fate and CLV represses it
  through an unknown pathway, as in angiosperms. It is likely that type-B ARR (B-ARR)
  works under the cytokinin pathway although remains to be determined. Auxin is also
  important for organogenesis, and a synergistic pathway with cytokinin and stem cell
  regulation through an AP2/ERF transcription factor is probably conserved. Furthermore,
  repression of meristematic genes by the PRC (PpLHP1/PpFIE) outside the stem cells
  is also a shared feature between mosses and angiosperms, although the mechanism
  of PRC recruitment and the target genes to be repressed are unknown
