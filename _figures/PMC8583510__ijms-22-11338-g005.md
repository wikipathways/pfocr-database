caption: 'The mitochondria at the center of the RLR, NLR and TLR pathways. The mitochondrion
  plays an important role in the innate immune response, as it participates in the
  main pathways involved in the immune response: the TLR, RLR and NLR pathways. The
  TLR pathway is involved in the antimicrobial response. PAMPs will activate the TLRs.
  The membrane-spanning TLRs (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4) and endosome-bonded TLRs (TLR3, TLR7,
  TLR8 and TLR9) are activated and trigger the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  via the NF-kB pathway. The TLRs activate the kinases Mst1 and Mst2, which activate
  the GTPase Rac allowing the assembly of the TRAF6-ECSIT complex. The TRAF6 translocates
  to the mitochondria and binds to ECSIT, forming the TRAF6-ECSIT complex, which lead
  to an increase in mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production as well as the proximity
  of the mitochondria and the phagosome. The bacteria in the phagosome will be destroyed
  by the action of mtROS. The RLR pathway is involved in antiviral response. Different
  PAMPs such as dsRNA, ssRNA and 5′-triphosphate (ppp) will activate two cytoplasmic
  PRRs, RIG-1 and MDA5. These PRR are regulated by DHX58, where DHX58 positively regulates
  MDA5 and negatively regulates RIG-1. After the interaction with DHX58/RIG1/MDA5,
  MAVS is activated by recruiting different proteins, such as TRAF3 and TRAF6. The
  interaction between MAVS and the MFN1 and MFN2 fusion proteins (MFNs) are essential
  for RLR pathway signaling. TRAF3 will activate the TANK/NEMO/iKKe/TBK complex, which
  will phosphorylate IRF7 and IRF3 dimers, allowing their translocation into the nucleus
  and their binding to ISRE sequences at the promoters of type I IFN-regulated genes,
  while TRAF6 will activate the IKK complex. This complex activates NF-ĸB by phosphorylating
  its inhibitor IKBα. Once activated, NF-ĸB translocates to the nucleus to induce
  the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. The NLR pathway is involved in a mechanism
  for fighting infection and cellular damage. The main complex of this pathway is
  the NLRP3 inflammasome. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex containing ASC,
  pro-caspase 1 and NLRP3. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is done both on transcriptional
  and post translational levels. The first is related to TLR activation and production
  of pro-IL1b and pro-IL18. The second signal is based on the detection of PAMPs and
  DAMPs that leads to NLRP3 oligomerization and interaction with ASC. Then, ASC recruits
  pro-caspase 1 via the CARD domain. Once caspase 1 is activated, it cleaves the pro-IL1b
  and pro-IL18 which will allow the release of these inflammatory cytokines in the
  extracellular milieu. In addition, caspase 1 cleaves Gsdmd, which will allow pore
  creation at the plasma membrane and pyroptosis. In addition, MAVS is also necessary
  for the recruitment of NLRP3 in mitochondrial membranes. Cardiolipin and mtROS promote
  the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.'
