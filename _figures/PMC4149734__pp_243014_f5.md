caption: Turnover of proteins in metabolic pathways in barley leaves. A, Biosynthetic
  pathway for the cofactor TPP. NAD (NAD+), Cys, and Gly are converted to 4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl)
  thiazole phosphate (HET-P) via the rapidly degraded THI1. In the other branch of
  the pathway, another fast turnover enzyme, THIC, catalyzes the conversion of S-adenosyl
  Met (SAM), 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR), and hydroxymethylpyrimidine (HMP)
  to HMP phosphate (HMP-P), which is then converted to HMP pyrophosphate (HMP-PP).
  HET-P and HMP-PP are then converted to thiamine phosphate (Thiamine) and subsequently
  to TPP for use as an enzymatic cofactor. B, The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway.
  In the top portion of the pathway, five proteins (glutamyl tRNA synthetase [tRNAGlu
  syn], Glu-1-semialdehyde aminomutase [GSA], porphobilinogen [PBG] deaminase, uroporyphrinogen
  [Uro] decarboxylase, and coprogen oxidase) all had fairly typical degradation rates.
  In the Mg2+ branch of the pathway, leading to chlorophyll biosynthesis, two of the
  most rapidly degraded proteins in the data set were observed, an -chelatase subunit
  (GUN5) and  cyclase (CRD1), as well as . Also observed in this branch were a CHLM
  protein from the -protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase complex and another subunit
  of the magnesium chelatase complex (CHLI). One protein was classified as a heme-binding
  protein (SOUL) and involved in tetrapyrrole metabolism but has no clearly assigned
  function. C, Photorespiratory pathway. The oxygenic reaction of Rubisco leads to
  the formation of 2-phosphogycolate, which is converted to glycolate that is exported
  to the cytosol and enters peroxisomes, where it is oxidized to glyoxylate and aminated
  to Gly by the fast turnover of glycolate oxidase and Glu:glyoxylate aminotransferase
  (AT). After decarboxylation of Gly and the synthesis of Ser in mitochondria by the
  combined action of Gly decarboxylase (GDC) and Ser hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT),
  the Ser reenters peroxisomes, where it is deaminated to hydroxypyruvate and reduced
  to glycerate by two rapidly degrading enzymes, Ser glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT)
  and hydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR). Glycerate is then returned to the chloroplast,
  where it is phosphorylated by glycerate kinase (GK) to reenter the Calvin cycle
  as 3-P-glycolate and then converted to glycolate by phosphoglycolate phosphatase
  (PGP).
