caption: Genetic alterations that lead to HIF activation in GBM. (A) EGFR gene amplification
  and/or overexpression is frequent in GBM. The most common EGFR gene mutation (EGFRvIII)
  consists in the deletion of exons 2–7, resulting in a constitutively active and
  ligand independent receptor. Initiation of EGFR/EGFRvIII signaling by ligand binding,
  gene amplification, or mutation results in activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  with the subsequent up-regulation of HIF-1α. PTEN gene deletion is common in GBM.
  PTEN protein is the main inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, as such loss
  of PTEN function leads to increased HIF-1α via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway; (B) It
  has been proposed that p53 may lead to inhibition of HIF activity in hypoxia by
  promoting MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α. Therefore, the
  loss of the p53 gene, which is common in GBM, will lead to HIF-1α stabilization.
