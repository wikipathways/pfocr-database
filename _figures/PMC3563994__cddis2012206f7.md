caption: A proposed signaling pathway for BPA-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.
  Mitochondrial damage is triggered by BPA that either directly damages the mitochondria
  or alters the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. On the one
  hand, BPA damages the mitochondrial electron respiratory chain complexes, resulting
  in the depletion of ATP and the impairment of GSIS in β cells. On the other hand,
  damaged mitochondria release cytochrome c to the cytosol. Cytochrome c consequently
  triggers the formation of apoptosomes, the activation of caspases, and finally,
  the execution of apoptosis in β cells. Arrows in the figure represent stimulative
  effects, and T lines represent inhibitory effects
