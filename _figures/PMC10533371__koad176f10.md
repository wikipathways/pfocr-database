caption: Virus infection facilitated by virus-encoded effector proteins. A and B)
  Suppression of PTI by MP. A) Perception of dsRNA produced in cortical ER-associated
  VRCs at the PM by an unknown membrane-associated or intracellular PRR and the SERK1
  coreceptor (with potential contribution by one or more other coreceptors) triggers
  a signaling pathway leading to callose deposition and PD closure. dsRNA produced
  during infection in the VRC may require secretion into the apoplasm (1) to allow
  perception at the PM. Externally applied poly(I:C) may be perceived from the apoplasm
  (2) or secreted upon initial uptake by the cells (3). Viral dsRNA as well as poly(I:C)
  may also be sensed by an intracellular cytoplasmic PRR, or by an internalized SERK–PRR
  complex, as shown in the figure in endosomes, shown as a gray vesicle. B) MP suppresses
  dsRNA-triggered callose deposition and allows intercellular spread of the viral
  ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP). The MP may inhibit dsRNA sensing by the intracellular
  dsRNA receptor or internalized SERK-PRR complex (1), interact with intracellular
  PTI signaling (2) or modify the activity of callose synthesizing or degrading enzymes
  at PD (3). The MP may also be secreted to inhibit dsRNA perception at the PM (4).
  C) dsRNA triggers PTI and antiviral RNA silencing and both responses are suppressed
  by viral effector proteins to support virus propagation. Whereas MP acts in cells
  at the virus front to facilitate virus movement by blocking a dsRNA-induced callose
  defense response at PD, the VSR blocks dsRNA-induced antiviral RNA silencing in
  the center of infection sites to support virus replication and production of virus
  progeny. A local infection site of TMV encoding MP fused to GFP (TMV-MP:GFP, 7 dpi)
  in N. benthamiana is shown. Scale bar, 1 mm.
