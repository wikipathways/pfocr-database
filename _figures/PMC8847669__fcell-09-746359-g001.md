caption: 'Scheme of the multi-scale model accounting for DC vaccine against cancer.
  The multi-level model contains three parts: the kinetics and bio-distribution of
  intravenously injected DCs in human organs (including the liver, the lung, and the
  spleen), the signaling pathways underlying DC maturation, and DC-mediated T-cell
  response. The labels next to the blue arrowed lines are the corresponding model
  parameters. The signaling pathway in DCs is drawn using Systems Biology Graphical
  Notation. A detailed description of the model can be found in .'
