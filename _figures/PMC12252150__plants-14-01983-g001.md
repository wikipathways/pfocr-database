caption: Molecular mechanism of StbHLH47, StLike3, StDRO2, and its role in drought
  and salt stress tolerance. In wild-type potato (left panel), StLike3 is proposed
  to contribute to sulfur metabolism and oxidative stress responses. StDRO2, a membrane-localized
  auxin transporter of the DRO1 family, facilitates polar auxin efflux in root tissues,
  maintaining optimal auxin gradients for gravitropic responses and lateral root emergence.
  Functional StDRO2 ensures balanced root architecture with moderate depth and branching.
  StbHLH47 acts as a negative regulator of drought tolerance by suppressing ABA signaling
  and lignin biosynthesis, leading to weaker cell wall reinforcement, impaired antioxidant
  defense, and increased susceptibility to membrane damage and chlorophyll loss. In
  addition, StbHLH47 represses iron uptake genes, resulting in suboptimal Fe(II) accumulation,
  which limits antioxidant capacity and exacerbates oxidative stress under drought
  conditions. In CRISPR/Cas9-edited plants (right panel), the overexpression of StLike3
  can enhance defense metabolism, while knockout of StbHLH47 derepresses ABA-responsive
  and lignin biosynthetic pathways, improving cell wall integrity, antioxidant activity,
  and drought tolerance. Deregulation of iron homeostasis also leads to increased
  Fe(II) content, which supports chlorophyll stability, efficient photosynthesis,
  and enhanced ROS scavenging, thereby enhancing overall stress tolerance. Knockout
  of StDRO2 reduces auxin efflux, leading to intracellular IAA accumulation in root
  apices. This stimulates lateral root initiation and elongation via ARF-mediated
  transcriptional cascades, producing a deeper and more branched root system. These
  architectural changes significantly improve water uptake under drought and confer
  enhanced tolerance without compromising growth
