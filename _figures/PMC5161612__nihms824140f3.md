caption: 'Applications of biosensors.(a) A biosensor with an output, such as fluorescence,
  can be used in a screen. The metabolite of interest (MOI, orange) is detected by
  a biosensor, which drives the expression of an output signal (green) in proportion
  to the MOI concentration. The output signal, often fluorescence, is used to isolate
  high-producing variants through screening (e.g. FACS or plate reader assays). (b)
  A biosensor with a selectable output. The MOI drives the expression of a protein
  (purple) that provides a growth advantage to the cell. As depicted, an enzyme that
  neutralizes an antibiotic (red) is expressed in a ligand-dependent manner. Growing
  variants under selective pressure (e.g. in the presence of antibiotic) enriches
  the population with high-producing variants. (c) Biosensors for dynamic regulation
  of pathways. The MOI (orange) is detected by a biosensor (not depicted – biosensor
  actions are represented by feedback symbols) which alters expression of enzymes
  in the MOI pathway. The cartoon illustrates balancing of a pathway intermediate
  (MOI, orange) by repressing the preceding enzyme and activating the subsequent enzyme
  in the pathway (similar to []). (d) Visualization of pathway balancing. Enzyme activity
  is represented by tubes (i.e. maximal flux that can be carried). Regulation of enzyme
  concentration (by TFs or degradation) or activity (allostery) alters the flux capacity
  between pathway intermediates. When enzyme flux is imbalanced (top two examples),
  starting materials or intermediates accumulate and product formation is limited.
  When flux is balanced (bottom two examples), accumulation does not occur at any
  step. (e) Potential biofuel pathways and biosensors. Binding proteins and transcription
  factors (or regulated promoters) are shown with colors designating: known binder
  with no biosensor use published; demonstrated use as a biosensor; or biosensor applied
