caption: 'Based on duration and biochemical mechanisms, LTP has been classified into
  three distinct phases that have been termed LTP1, LTP2, and LTP3: LTP1 is a short-lasting
  (1 hour) early form of LTP that requires post-translational modification of synaptic
  proteins but is independent of protein synthesis. LTP2 is slowly decaying (1–3 hours)
  and dependent on protein translation but does not require gene transcription. Finally,
  LTP3 represents the long-lasting phase of LTP and is believed to be both translation-
  and transcription-dependent. PKMζ maintains late-LTP (LTP3) through upregulation
  of an NSF/GluR2-dependent AMPAR trafficking pathway (red pathway). PKMζ acts through
  NSF by releasing GluR2-containing receptors from a reserve pool held at extrasynaptic
  sites by PICK1 and thereby promoting their trafficking to the postsynaptic density.
  The VAMP/synaptobrevin dependent exocytotic pathway does not seem to be influenced
  by PKMζ. Interactions between PKMζ and the actin cytoskeleton remain to be clarified
  as well as upstream regulatory pathways (e.g., role of calcium and kinases), initiating
  transcription and translation of PKMζ (blue pathway).'
