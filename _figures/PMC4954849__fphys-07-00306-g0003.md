caption: (A) Physiological flow induces eNOS signaling and induces reorganization
  and polarization of the EC. A mechanosensor and calcium transporter called Piezo1
  was shown to be activated by flow. High intracellular Ca+ levels induce coupling
  of eNOS but also activate Calpain, an enzyme important for actin cytoskeleton reorganization
  (Li et al., ). High Calcium levels also activate non canonical Wnt pathway (PCP)
  promoting polarization of the cell; (B) Primary Cilia is important for flow sensing
  in ECs. The cilium is essential for accumulation of intracellular Calcium that promote
  NO production by eNOS and reduces inflammation (Goetz et al., ). Both processes
  reduce atherosclerosis in aortic endothelium (Dinsmore and Reiter, ).
