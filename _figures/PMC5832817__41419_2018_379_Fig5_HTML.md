caption: Extracellular cadmium has an estrogen-like effect, disturbing hormonal balance
  via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal pathway. Intracellular cadmium disturbs neurogenesis
  and leads to neuronal apoptosis and ROS by impairing mitochondria signaling and
  inhibition of Jak/Stat signaling. The cadmium accumulation in the brain alters gene
  expression and causes epigenetic effects through DNA binding. Moreover, it leads
  to oxidative stress via inhibition of antioxidant enzymes, depletion of antioxidants,
  dislocation of redox active metals, and suppression of the mitochondrial electron
  transport chain,. The replacement of iron and copper by cadmium, and thereby the
  increase of free iron and copper content, generate hydroxyl radicals and promote
  oxidative stress via Fenton’s reaction,,,. Additionally, the activity of different
  antioxidant enzymes, including Cu/Zn SOD1, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase,
  and catalase is altered by cadmium intoxication. Cadmium-induced selenium deficiency
  causes depletion of glutathione peroxidase. Also, cellular antioxidant GSH is disrupted
  by cadmium and results in the elevation of ROS. The excess of intracellular ROS
  inhibits the neural janus kinase (Jak) and tyrosine kinase, and leads to disruption
  of neural mitochondria
