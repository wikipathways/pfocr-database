caption: NAD+ biosynthesis and salvage pathways. NAD+ is a critical metabolite for
  numerous metabolic processes, and both de novo biosynthesis and salvage of NAD+
  byproducts are important for maintaining overall pools of NAD. Importantly, both
  the sirtuins and PARPs consume NAD+ and produce nicotinamide as a byproduct, which
  suggests that the salvage pathway is particularly important when considering the
  function of these enzymes. NaPRT, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase; NMNAT,
  nicotinic acid/nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase; QPRT, quinolinate
  phosphoribosyl transferase.
