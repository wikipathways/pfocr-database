caption: Key interactions of BMX and its pathways. The interactors by which BMX can
  mediate these pathways are indicated next to the pathway. The interactors and pathways
  that are involved in the oncogenic cellular phenotype are coloured yellow; those
  involved in cell differentiation are coloured red; those involved in the immune
  response and/or inflammation are coloured green; while those coloured in blue are
  the members of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. TEC encodes the
  angiopoietin-1 receptor, ITK gene encodes interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase;
  TXK encodes tyrosine-protein kinase protein and BTK encodes Bruton’s tyrosine kinase
