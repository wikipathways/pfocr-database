caption: Type-I interferon signaling and ISG15. Type I interferon (IFN) binds its
  receptor causing the dimerization of the two subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 and thus
  the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. The receptor associated kinases TYK2 and
  JAK1 induce recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. The phosphorylated
  proteins translocate to the nucleus and together with IRF9 form a trimer called
  ISGF3. This trimer acts as a transcriptional activator and is capable of binding
  to the ISRE of IFN response genes activating their expression. ISG15 and its three
  conjugating enzymes E1-activating enzyme (UBE1L), E2-conjugating enzyme (hUBCH8,
  mUBCM8) and E3 ligases (hHERC5/mHERC6, EFP, HHARI, TRIM25), as well as the ISG15
  protease USP18 are all IFN-response genes. ISG15 is linked to target proteins via
  its conjugation system, which is counteracted by USP18 protease activity. Moreover,
  free ISG15 can act as a cytokine binding to LFA-1, subsequently inducing IFN-γ secretion
  by natural killer cells and T lymphocytes. Furthermore, USP18 also plays an important
  role as a negative regulator of IFN type I signaling. USP18 can interact with IFNAR2
  and STAT2, competing with JAK1 for receptor binding and thus inhibiting signal transduction.
  The SCFSkp2 complex binds USP18 by mediating its poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation, which is inhibited by ISG15 in human cells only. IFNAR, Interferon
