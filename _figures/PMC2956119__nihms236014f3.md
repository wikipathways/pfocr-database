caption: 'This figure shows the two distinct modes of caspase-8 activation – the well-known
  ‘death receptor’ apoptotic pathway involving caspase-8 auto-processing (shown on
  the left) followed by either direct activation of effector caspases or proteolytc
  activation of the BH3-only protein BID to activate the ‘BCL-2-regulated’ apoptotic
  pathway (see also ). The caspase-8 related protein c-FLIP mainly acts as a catalytically
  inactive caspase-8 substitute competing for the binding to FADD, thereby limiting
  recruitment and activation of caspase-8 and thus blocking apoptosis initiation.
  However, c-FLIP has also been shown to promote caspase-8 recruitment and activation
  in certain circumstances. The right side illustrates the presently only poorly understood
  pathway by which FADD and caspase-8 promote cellular activation, proliferation and
  differentiation without the need of self-processing. For this pathway, neither the
  upstream activators (‘death receptors’?) nor the substrates of caspase-8 are identified.
  Abbreviations: DISC: death inducing signaling complex; MOMP: mitochondrial outer
  membrane permeabilization; Cyt. C: cytochrome C; c-FLIP: cellular form of FADD-like
  IL-1β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein.'
