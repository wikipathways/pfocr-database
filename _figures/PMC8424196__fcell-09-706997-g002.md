caption: Schematic diagram showing the molecular mechanisms of Dx in Drosophila. The
  regulation mechanisms of Dx on the Notch signaling pathway depend on the ubiquitination
  pattern of the Notch receptor. Dx activates the endocytosis of Notch independent
  on the canonical ligands. The endosomal maturation is initiated by the HOPS complex
  and converted from Rab5 to Rab7. Interaction with the AP-3 complex promotes Notch
  targeting to the late-endosomal and lysosomal vesicle membranes. Dx functions as
  a positive modulator of the Notch signaling pathway when the Notch receptor is monoubiquitinated.
  The extracellular domain of monoubiquitinated Notch is removed and degraded following
  cleavage. Then, the NICD of Notch is released to activate the downstream gene expression.
  However, Dx acts as a negative regulator of the Notch signaling pathway when Notch
  is polyubiquitinated by Dx and regulatory factors, including Su(dx), TRAF6, Shrub,
  and Kurtz. The polyubiquitinated Notch is transferred into multivesicular body via
  ESCRT-III and degraded via the endosome/lysosome pathway. Dx also influences the
  JNK signaling pathway to induce apoptosis via interacting with Hrp48 or Eiger. NICD,
