caption: Both pathways are dependent upon a SFK, possibly Src. The β1 integrin-activated
  pathway involves PI3-K while the αvβ3-activated pathway involves CD47 and Rac1 signaling
  mediated by the GEF Trio. CD47 activation by TSP1 containing the carboxy-terminal
  sequence found in peptide 4N1K (RFYVVMWK) may be an important regulator of CLAN
  formation. Convergence of the two pathways could potentially occur at two points.
  The β1 integrin pathway might also signal through Rac1, but via activation of a
  Rac1 GEF distinct from Trio. Alternatively, PI-3K could bypass Rac1 completely and
  the two pathways would converge at a different downstream effector to promote CLAN
  formation.
