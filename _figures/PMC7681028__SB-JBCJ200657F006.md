caption: Functions and pathways of the type II MAGEs, MAGE-F1 and -L2. A, MAGE-F1
  controls flux through the CIA pathway by regulating MMS19 protein levels. MAGE-F1
  interacts with the E3 ligase NSE1 to form an MRL that ubiquitinates MMS19, promoting
  its degradation. Decreased MMS19 protein levels lead to decreased iron-sulfur (Fe-S)
  cluster incorporation into downstream targets, like DNA repair enzymes. B, increased
  levels of MAGE-F1 contribute to dysregulated iron homeostasis by degrading MMS19
  and genotoxic stress by suppressing DNA repair pathways. C, MAGE-L2 contributes
  to the neurodevelopmental disorders PWS and SYS. Mage-l2–null mice exhibit decreased
  levels of mature neuropeptides, transmembrane receptors, like LepR, and circadian
  rhythm proteins, all of which may contribute to impaired adaptation to recurring
  and acute changes in the environment and contribute to the phenotypes seen in KO
  mice and PWS and SYS patients. Administration of oxytocin immediately after birth
  or during the first postnatal week rescues survival and normal adult social behavior
  of Mage-l2–null mice. D, MAGE-L2 is involved in endosomal protein trafficking. Cargo
  proteins on endosomes are trafficked to either the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi
  network, or the lysosome for degradation. The retromer complex (blue) recognizes
  cargo proteins and, based on their destination, sorts them into endosomal tubules
  reshaped by localized F-actin patches. VPS35 interacts with the WASH regulatory
  complex (pink). The MUST complex (MAGE-L2-USP7-TRIM27) activates WASH by adding
  a Lys-63–linked polyubiquitin chain, which recruits ARP2/3 and promotes downstream
  F-actin nucleation.
