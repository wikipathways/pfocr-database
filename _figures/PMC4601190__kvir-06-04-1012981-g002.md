caption: Epithelial cell recognition and discrimination of Candida albicans yeast
  and hyphae. Infection of Oral epithelial cells by C. albicans results in the triggering
  of 3 dominant pathways, each with distinct functions. There are 2 phases of signal
  pathway activation by C. albicans. In phase 1, C. albicans cells are recognized
  in a morphologically independent fashion, leading to activation of NF-κB, and mTOR
  via the PI3K/Akt pathway, involving activation of PDK1 and Akt. Activation of PI3K/Akt/mTor
  signaling leads to initiation of the cellular damage protection responses, as well
  as activation of an unknown transcription factor involved in growth factor transcription.
  There is also a low level triggering of all 3 MAPK pathways (p38, JNK and ERK1/2)
  leading to activation of the c-Jun transcription factor. Both JNK and ERK1/2 but
  not p38 play a role in this process. The role that p38 plays in this early phase
  is not yet known. While NF-κB and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways showed sustained activation,
  triggering of MAPK signaling in this phase is transient, and returns to resting
  levels after 1 hour if no further signal is received. When a burden threshold of
  C. albicans hyphal cells is reached, a second phase is triggered. Through an as
  yet unidentified receptor-ligand interaction, epithelial cells show further, stronger
  triggering of all 3 MAPK pathways, leading to induction of c-Fos expression and
  DNA binding through the p38 pathway and stabilization of the MAPK phosphatase, MKP1
  via ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation. In conjunction with NF-κB and an mTOR induced
  transcription factor, c-Fos then up-regulates the production of cytokines, chemokines
  and other inflammatory mediators. In parallel, MKP1 acts in a negative feedback
  loop to limit the activity of MAPK signaling by deactivating p38 and JNK.
