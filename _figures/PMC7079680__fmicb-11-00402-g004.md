caption: 'Acetoin production by Eubacterium limosum. (A) Metabolic pathway from CO
  to acetoin, in presence of the acetoin biosynthesis carrying plasmid. The constructed
  plasmid was transformed to ECO_acsA and the parental strain, which was named ECO_acsA_ACT
  and WT_ACT, respectively. The red arrow indicates CODH/ACS reaction encoded by acsA.
  (B) The production of acetoin by ECO_acsA_ACT (bluish green bar) and the WT_ACT
  (gray bar). The cells were anaerobically cultivated at 37°C in 150 mL anaerobic
  bottle containing 100 mL of the modified DSMZ 135 medium with 50 mL of headspace
  purged at a pressure of 200 kPa. Error bars indicate standard deviation of biological
  triplicates. Asterisks indicates as following: *: P-value ≤ 0.05.'
