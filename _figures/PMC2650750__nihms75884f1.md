caption: Hypoxia and FFAs in obesity lead to activation of NF-kB pathway, which induces
  expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, et al) in adipose tissue.
  Through receptor-mediated signal transduction, these cytokines activates serine
  kinases including IKK, JNK, PKC and p70S6K to inhibit IRS-1 function. NF-kB inhibits
  PPARγ function through nuclear corepressor and results in suppression of the gene
  transcription of CAP and IRS-2, which are signaling molecules in PI(3)K-independent
  and -dependent signaling pathways for insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. Hypoxia
  also induces FFA level through lipolysis.
