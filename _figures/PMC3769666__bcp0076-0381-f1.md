caption: The extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway
  entails death ligands such as tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand (TRAIL) binding to and activating its cognate receptors (TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5).
  This complex then recruits tumour necrosis factor-associated death domain protein
  (TRADD) and the initiator caspase 8. In this death-inducing signalling complex (DISC),
  caspase 8 is auto-activated by proteolysis and released into the cytosol. This leads
  to activation of caspases 3/7 and subsequently apoptosis. The intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway can be triggered by internal stress signals (e.g. radiation/chemotherapy
  damage to DNA) or via death receptor activation and caspase 8-mediated cleavage
  of Bid. Cleaved Bid (tBid) and/or other pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins induce translocation
  of Bax/Bak into the mitochondrial membrane, leading to cytosolic release of cytochrome
  c and the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC). Cytochrome c
  binds the adaptor proteins Apaf-1 and caspase 9 to form the apoptosome which activates
  caspase 9. This caspase further activates caspases 3/7, resulting in apoptosis.
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL can inhibit apoptosis by preventing release of cytochrome c from
  the mitochondria. The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins (e.g. cIAP1/2, XIAP
  and survivin) block caspase activation further downstream. SMAC displaces these
  IAP proteins, thus promoting apoptosis. The lead clinical drugs for each target
  in the apoptotic pathway are shown (multicoloured)

  description: The extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The extrinsic apoptotic
    pathway entails death ligands such as tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
