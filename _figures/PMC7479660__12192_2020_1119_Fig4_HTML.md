caption: 'Proposed mechanism by which losartan through Hsp70 inhibits the epithelial
  to mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by angiotensin II in proximal tubule cells
  derived from SHR. Left panel: schematic illustration showing four key events during
  tubular epithelial cells to myofibroblast transition. Right panel: throughout the
  activation of the MAPK cascade and the RhoA/ROCK pathway, angiotensin II regulates
  EMT markers. The Hps70 chaperone inhibits the signaling pathways that lead to epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition after losartan AT1 receptor blockage'
papertitle: The renal antioxidative effect of losartan involves heat shock protein
  70 in proximal tubule cells.
