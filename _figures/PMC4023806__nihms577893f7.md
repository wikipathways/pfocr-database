caption: At RdDM target loci where DNA methylation is AtRRP6L1-dependent, AtRRP6L1
  retains Pol V-generated non-coding RNAs at sites of transcription, allowing for
  prolonged association of transcripts with chromatin for their scaffold function.
  Since AtRRP6L1 is also required for Pol IV-dependent siRNA production, AtRRP6L1
  possibly also helps to retain Pol IV-transcribed non-coding RNAs, thereby facilitating
  synthesis of double-stranded RNAs by RDR2 and subsequent production of 24 nt siRNAs.
  In the absence of AtRRP6L1, these important non-coding RNAs in the RdDM pathway
  may be quickly released from the chromatin upon transcription termination, resulting
  in DNA hypomethylation. For simplicity, not all known RdDM components are shown.
