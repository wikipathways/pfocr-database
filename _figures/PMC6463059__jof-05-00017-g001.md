caption: 'Linking morphogenesis with antifungal drug treatment and drug resistance
  in Candida. (a) antifungals and their impact on morphogenesis. Candida morphogenesis
  can be blocked with treatment with antifungal compounds, including azoles, echinocandins,
  and polyenes [,,,,]. This morphogenetic inhibition is seen even at sub-inhibitory
  concentrations of all three classes. (b) interactions between signalling pathways
  that govern morphogenesis and drug resistance. The protein kinase C (PKC)-MAPK pathway
  and the cAMP-PKA pathway are both involved in drug resistance and morphogenesis
  in Candida. Depicted are the downstream effects of PKC which regulates MAPK signalling
  to maintain cell wall integrity when exposed to drugs. Pkc1 has been found to regulate
  Cyr1 [], which is a part of the cAMP-PKA signalling pathway, which governs filamentous
  growth []. Pkc1 is implicated in regulation of both drug resistance [] and hyphal
  formation []. Signaling from the PKA pathway also plays a role in drug resistance
  via Cyr1 signaling [,], as well as morphogenesis []. Downstream transcriptional
  regulators of both MAPK and PKA pathways ultimately regulate morphogenesis and resistance
  to antifungals. Morphogenesis and filamentous growth also contribute to biofilm
  formation, which in turn enhances antifungal resistance. (c) transcriptional regulation
  of antifungal drug resistance and morphogenesis. Transcription factors such as Efg1
  and Ndt80 have previously been linked to modulating expression of hyphal specific
  genes and promoting filamentation [,,,,]. Both of these transcriptional regulators
  are also involved in drug resistance, via regulation of genes involved in drug efflux
  and/or ergosterol biosynthesis [,,,,]; (d) coupling Candida morphogenesis and drug
  resistance through biofilm formation. Biofilms of polymorphic Candida species are
  typically composed of diverse cellular morphologies: hyphae, pseudohyphae and yeast
  []. Once established, these polymorphic biofilms secrete an extracellular matrix
  (ECM) that helps shield Candida from the external environment. Biofilms play a significant
  role in antifungal drug resistance by preventing antifungal penetration, sequestering
  antifungals, upregulating antifungal drug efflux, and metabolic regulation that
  limits antifungal activity [,,,]; (e) novel compounds for targeting Candida morphogenesis.
  New compounds are being discovered that can modulate filamentation in Candida species,
  and may serve as novel therapeutic strategies for treating fungal infections. Examples
  include drugs (i.e., filastatin), and compounds secreted by competing microbes (i.e.,
  Bacillus safensis) that prevent filamentation, and drugs that enhances filamentation
  (i.e., diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)).'
