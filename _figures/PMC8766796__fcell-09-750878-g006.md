caption: The hypothesis model depicts that PTH could increase intracellular cAMP concentrations
  and activate the signaling transduction of the cAMP/PKA/CREB axis, causing a subsequent
  increase of the level of phosphorylated CREB, which in turn activated the IHH signaling
  pathway. IHH further led to increased chondrogenesis in the callus and an enhanced
  rate of chondrocyte maturation and mineralization and ultimately accelerated the
  process of fracture healing.
