caption: Hepatic gluconeogenesis is modulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). In
  fasting state, increased glucagon/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway induces class IIa HDACs
  dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation. In nucleus, they recruit class I HDAC3
  and form a complex that promotes deacetylation and activation of FoxO1. Class IIb
  HDAC6 promotes glucocorticoid deacetylation and nuclear translocation. Class III
  HDACs SIRT1 mediates deacetylation and activation FoxO1 and PGC-1α. During prolonged
  starvation, Sirt1 can repress glucagon-induced gluconeogenesis through deacetylation
  and subsequent ubiquitin-dependent degradation of CRTC2.
