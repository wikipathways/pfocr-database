caption: Glial-neuronal lipid transfer during physiological and pathological conditions.
  During physiological conditions (A), the exchange of lipids between glia and neurons
  is mediated by apolipoprotein D/E (APOD/E) particles or other protein carriers such
  as albumin. In glia, fatty acids generated by fatty acid synthase (FASN) and converted
  into triacylglycerols (TAGs) via diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) can be remobilized
  from lipid droplets (LDs) by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) for transfer to
  neurons or to enter mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation (FAO). In neurons, ATGL
  and DDHD Domain-Containing 2 (DDHD2) ensure that TAG lipolysis approximately matches
  TAG synthesis, preventing LD accumulation and ensuring the FA supply for neuronal
  functions such as membrane synthesis. Under pathological conditions (B), mitochondrial
  dysfunction in neurons is associated with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) that
  trigger c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein
  (SREBP) signalling, which increases FASN synthesis of FAs and in some circumstances
  leads to ectopic neuronal LDs. Excess neuronal FAs are secreted from neurons via
  ATP-binding cassette (ABC) A transporters and APOD/E particles, taken up by glia
  via endocytosis and trafficked through the endolysosomal pathway and ER via DGAT
  into glial LDs. Glial LDs may protect against lipotoxicity and high reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) via multiple non-mutually exclusive mechanisms (). In neurons during
  pathological conditions, altered TAG metabolism and ectopic LDs may contribute to
  dysfunction and neurodegeneration (axonal dotted line).
