caption: Uba4 and its mammalian homologue MOCS3 function to promote both sulfur transfer
  reactions through URM1 as well as the conjugation of URM1 to other proteins via
  an isopeptide bond. URM1 forms an adenylate intermediate with the adenylation domain
  of MOCS3 or Uba4. A reactive Cys (residue 397) in the Rhodanese homology domain
  (RHD) of UBA4 becomes persulfurated likely via the action of nitrogen fixing bacteria
  S-like protein (Nfs1) in a reaction that requires Cysteine (Cys). Through a process
  that is poorly understood from a mechanistic perspective, the adenylate on URM1
  is replaced by a sulfur from the persulfide on Cys397, forming URM1 thiocarboxylate.
  URM1-thiocarboxylate associates with the ATP binding subunit of a heterodimeric
  enzyme complex required for conversion of uridine-mcm5 in the anti-codon of U-rich
  tRNAs to the 2-thiouridine-mcm5 derivative. In yeast, this complex is composed of
  Needs CLA4 for Survival 2 (Ncs2), Ncs6, and a previously unstudied protein Yor251c.
  The ATP associated with Ncs6 has been proposed to make an adenylate with uridine,
  as an intermediate for the trans-thiolation reaction. 2-Thiouridine-mcm5 is crucial
  for the fidelity of translation. In a separate process, URM1 has been proposed to
  be conjugated to the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase Ahp1 in yeast but the molecular
  intermediates in this process are not defined.
