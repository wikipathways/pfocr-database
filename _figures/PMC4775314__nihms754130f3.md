caption: A) Schematic summarizing our and others’ work on how GIV modulates several
  parameters, e.g., invasiveness, stemness, angiogenesis, survival, and drug resistance,
  all of which together constitute the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells. Each
  of these parameters, that can be triggered by diverse classes of oncogenic receptors,
  are driven more efficiently and consequently, the tumorigenic potential is highest
  when GIV expression is elevated and its GEF function is ‘ON’ [summarized in (, )].
  GIV levels are transcriptionally upregulated in invasive cancer cells during cancer
  progression via the transcription factor, STAT3 ()., whereas its GEF function is
  turned ‘ON’ via a single phosphoevent that is triggered by CDK5 (). Because GIV
  serves as molecular rheostat, i.e., signaling intensity via GIV’s GEF function is
  closely related to the two variables, i.e., number of GIV molecules in cells and
  whether their GEF function is ‘ON’, it is expected that by altering both variables
  one can alter the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells from low to high. Thus,
  the pharmacologic goal to halt cancer progression is to reduce the copies of GIV
  (by tumor-targeted si/shRNA) and/or to selectively turn ‘OFF’ GIV’s GEF function
  (using small molecule inhibitors). Antagonistic pathways, such as SHP1 phosphatase
  () and PKCθ kinase (), which terminate tyrosine-based and G protein-based signals,
  respectively, may also be potentiated to accomplish a similar goal. B) Schematic
  summarizing our work () on how GIV regulates several parameters, e.g., proliferation,
  chemotaxis, survival, metalloprotease and collagen production, all of which together
  constitute the fibrogenic potential of myofibroblasts in response to chronic injury/inflammation.
  Each of these parameters, that can be triggered by diverse classes of fibrogenic
  receptors, are driven more efficiently and consequently, the fibrogenic potential
  is highest when GIV expression is elevated and its GEF function is ‘ON’. Upon chronic
  fibrogenic injury, GIV levels are transcriptionally upregulated and GIV’s GEF function
  is turned ‘ON’ in myofibroblasts. When GIV’s GEF function is ‘ON’, pro-fibrogenic
  (red arrows) signals are potentiated, whereas anti-fibrogenic (green arrows) signals
  are downregulated; the opposite occurs when GIV’s GEF function is turned ‘OFF’.
  Thus, the pharmacologic goal to halt and reverse fibrogenic progression is to selectively
  turn ‘OFF’ GIV’s GEF function (using small molecule inhibitors). C) Schematic summarizing
  our and others’ work (, , ) on how GIV regulates several steps of the insulin signaling
  cascade, e.g., receptor autophosphorylation, the recruitment and activation of IRS1,
  activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, exocytosis of the glucose transporter,
  GLUT4 and glucose uptake into skeletal muscles, all of which together constitute
  the metabolic insulin response. While an intact and efficient metabolic insulin
  response is required for physiology (i.e., insulin sensitivity), aberrant signals
  in response to circulating free fatty acids (among other causes) dampen such metabolic
  response and contribute to insulin resistance, the hallmark of type II diabetes.
  The metabolic insulin response is driven more efficiently and consequently, the
  insulin sensitivity is highest when GIV expression is elevated () and its GEF function
  is ‘ON’ (). Fatty acids trigger insulin resistant states by phosphoinhibiting GIV’s
  GEF function via the DAG→PKCθ pathway, whereas insulin sensitizers like Pioglitazone
  act by potentiating tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV and by reversing phosphoinhibition
  and restoring GIV’s GEF function. Thus, the pharmacologic goal to reverse insulin
  resistance and reinstate insulin sensitivity is to selectively turn ‘ON’ GIV’s GEF
  function (by using positive allosteric modulators of GIV’s GEF function or by using
  specific inhibitors of PKCθ). D) Schematic summary of plausible therapeutic strategies
  to regulate GIV-dependent signaling. Among the currently available options are inhibitors
  (shown in yellow boxes) of the various upstream factors which coordinately potentiate
  GIV-dependent signaling, e.g., receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases that trigger
  tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV, or STAT3 which activates GIV transcription in diseased
  states, or the Ser/Thr kinase CDK5 which phosphoactivates GIV’s GEF function. Although
  selective inhibition of GIV’s GEF function using small molecules still remains unrealized,
  the therapeutic relevance of GIV depletion (by si/shRNA) or targeted disruption
  of its GEF function using cell permeable peptides has been experimentally validated
  (blue boxes).
