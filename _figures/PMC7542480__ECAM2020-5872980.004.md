caption: Protein-protein interaction network. (a) Constructed by Cytoscape 3.7.0;
  the color of the node is positively related to the degree of contribution of the
  node in the network. (b) Constructed by String 11.0; the color of the node is representative
  to the different signaling pathway as is shown above.
