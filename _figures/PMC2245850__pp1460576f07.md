caption: Model showing the UVR8-dependent and UVR8-independent UV-B signaling pathways
  and representative genes they regulate in mature Arabidopsis leaf tissue. The broken
  arrow leading from HYH to the CHS, ELIP1, and CRYD genes indicates that HYH cannot
  completely compensate for the absence of HY5 in this pathway. The large arrow leading
  from UV-B to UVR8 overlaps the low fluence and high fluence range, indicating that
  both high and low UV-B fluence rates can activate UVR8.
