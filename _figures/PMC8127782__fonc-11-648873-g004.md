caption: 'Mechanisms involved in CPV and NS1 mediated cancer cell death: Once the
  CPV genome is sensed by the host cells, they respond by activating caspase 9 and
  depolarizing the mitochondrial membrane. This causes the cells to undergo apoptosis.
  However, CPV activates cell survival pathways (ERK1/2) thereby mediating viral gene
  expression. CPV2.NS1 expression causes inhibition of host cell DNA replication.
  After activation by phosphorylation, NS1 causes DNA damage leading to cell cycle
  arrest at the G1/S phase before causing apoptosis. NS1 also associates with outer
  mitochondrial membrane and DNA damage response leads to activation of pro-apoptotic
  signals (Bcl2 and Bax) thereby creating oxidative stress. This cellular stress causes
  a decrease in mitochondrial membrane permeability, the release of Cytochrome C which
  further forms apoptosome complex with Apaf1, activating caspase 9, finally inducing
  cell death by intrinsic/mitochondrial pathway.'
