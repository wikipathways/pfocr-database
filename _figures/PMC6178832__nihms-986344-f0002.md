caption: Schematic representation of the molecular events downstream cytokines activating
  the JAK/STAT pathway, involved in ILC development and functions. Specific molecular
  mechanisms of gene regulation and JAK inhibitors are also illustrated. Briefly,
  different cytokines bind specific combinations of receptors. Once engaged, cytokine
  receptors undergo oligomerization, initiating the signal transduction. JAKs bind
  the intra-cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, dimerize, and transactivate each other.
  STATs are recruited and associate to JAKs resulting in STAT phosphorylation and
  activation. Phosphorylated STATs migrate to the nucleus, modulating gene expression
  through several mechanisms. As illustrated, a STAT dimer can bind DNA without any
  modulation of gene expression (neutral or opportunistic binding). Transcription
  is regulated instead through binding of different DREs, including, promoters and
  enhancers. STAT5 can also act as a tetramer, regulating expression of specific genes.
  Moreover, STATs can regulate gene expression by recruiting chromatin modifiers and/or
  inducing tri-dimensional reorganization of the DNA, promoting the juxtaposition
  of the proper elements necessary for the downstream gene transcription. Finally,
  JAK inhibitors and their specificity for JAKs are shown.
