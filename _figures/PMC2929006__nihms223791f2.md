caption: The VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets the hypoxia inducible factors
  for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This process is mediated by HIF prolyl hydroxylase
  (PHD) and an essential cofactor, 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG). This is an oxygen/iron sensing
  system; when the cell is hypoxic or iron levels are low, the VHL complex cannot
  target and degrade HIF and HIF over-accumulates, driving the transcription of a
  number of genes important in cancer, such as vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and the glucose transporter, GLUT
