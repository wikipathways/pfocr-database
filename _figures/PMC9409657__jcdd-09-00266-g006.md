caption: Hypothesized diagram. The proposed schematic diagram from the current study
  shows that the cardiac Fas/FasL-mediated (Fas Ligand, Fas, FADD, and active caspase-8)
  and the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways (Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, Active
  caspase-9, and Active caspase-3) were activated by hypertension through IGF-II and
  p-JNK activation. Moreover, the pro-survival protein of SIRT1 appeared to have a
  compensatory pro-survival response after hypertension. However, these cardiac Fas/FasL-mediated
  and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways appear to be suppressed or not activated
  via the enhanced SIRT1/PGC-1α pro-survival pathway (SIRT1, PGC-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL)
  under hypertension after treated Irbesartan.
