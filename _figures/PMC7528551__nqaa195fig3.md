caption: Ceramides show a discriminative accumulation in VAT. (A) A metabolic map
  of the sphingolipid pathway [modified from the KEGG pathway ()]. The gene expression
  of enzymes of the pathway, as found in the GTEx database, is shown as rectangles
  and the relative lipid accumulation in the main dataset is shown as circles. (B–E)
  The accumulation of sphingolipid groups found by our lipidomics study. Blue lines
  represent a change of ≥10% in the SAT:VAT ratio. Red lines represent a change of
  ≤ −10% in the SAT:VAT ratio. Black lines represent a similar accumulation ±10%.
  n = 17; error bars represent SEMs; 1-tailed paired t test. KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes; SAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue; VAT, visceral adipose tissue.
