caption: Graphic representation of GNPDAs’ role in producing energy and lipid synthesis.
  GNPDAs provide Fru6P for glycolytic pathways and ATP production. Fru6P is phosphorylated
  by Phosphofructokinase 1 (FFK1), yielding Fru1,6 biphosphate (Fru1, 6 bi P). Aldolase
  produces glyceraldehyde three phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP).
  The glycolytic pathway generates ATP and pyruvate, which can enter the tricarboxylic
  cycle. Acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) is the precursor of fatty acid synthase. The glycerol
  required for triacylglycerols is obtained from oxidation of DHAP into glycerol 3-phosphate
  (G3P). Increased GlcNAc6P activates GNPDAs
