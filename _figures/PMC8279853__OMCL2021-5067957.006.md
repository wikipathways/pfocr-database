caption: 'Schema displaying the mechanism of NAR against UVB-induced cell alterations.
  Exposure to UVB radiation induces massive apoptosis that contributes to skin photoaging
  and skin carcinogenesis. Apoptosis is an extremely regulated process that relates
  to a set of cellular events orchestrated mainly by the activation of caspases and
  leading to cell death. Signaling for UVB-induced apoptosis occurs through DNA damages
  and high levels of free radicals (ROS and NO), which initiate many cellular responses:
  (a) differential expression of p53 including halting of the cell cycle, repairing
  of DNA, and inducing cell death (apoptosis pattern); (b) p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathway
  activation; (c) cell death membrane receptor activation (CD95/Fas) and proinflammatory
  cytokine secretion (TNF-α); and (d) damage to structural cell components (actin
  cytoskeleton, nucleus, and plasma membrane). NAR is a natural bioactive compound
  which is capable of both absorbing UV and scavenging free radicals, thereby showing
  an effective antioxidant capacity. It modulates intracellular signaling via direct
  interaction with free radicals, playing an antiapoptotic effect. It protects cells
  from the morphological and biochemical features of UVB-induced apoptosis, and therefore
  maintains skin homeostasis. We hypothesis that NAR is distributed in different cellular
  compartments as other antioxidant flavonoids, contributing to enhance its photoprotective
  effect.'
