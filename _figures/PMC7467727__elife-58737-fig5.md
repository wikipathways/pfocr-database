caption: (A) Simplified model of mTOR signaling pathway activating the GTPases, CDC42
  and RAC1 to regulate actin dynamics. (B) During normal development appropriate levels
  of mTOR signaling regulate oRG morphology, basal process length and migration behavior
  through activation of CDC42 and its targets, CFL1 and ACTR2. (C) When mTOR signaling
  is dysregulated the basal process is truncated and oRG cells have decreased levels
  of F-actin, CDC42, CFL1, and ACTR2. The oRG cells are mispositioned, the basal process
  does not reach the pial surface, and the glial scaffold is disrupted.
