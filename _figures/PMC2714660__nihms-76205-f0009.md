caption: Schematic representation of ICP10PK-mediated neuroprotection from MPP+-induced
  PCD. ICP10PK activates the PI3-K/Akt pathway through Ras activation, as previously
  described., The activated pathway results in up-regulation/stabilization of Bcl-2.
  This counteracts MPP+-induced calpain I activation and subsequent mobilization of
  Bax to the mitochondria, AIF release and nuclear translocation, and caspase-3 activation.
  ICP10PK also causes up-regulation/stabilization of Hsp70, by an as yet unknown mechanism.
  Arrows represent activation, dotted arrows represent potentially involved factors,
  while reversed “T” symbols represent inhibition.
