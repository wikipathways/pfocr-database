caption: Graphical abstract. TLR4 recognizes and responds to DAMPs, including exogenous
  PAMPs and endogenous alarmins. The most common PAMPs in myocardial inflammation
  are thought to be virus, whereas alarmins released in response to myocardial inflammation
  can be necrotic cells and damaged matrix. TLR4 activates many transcription factors
  through the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, subsequently inducing the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, cell surface molecules, and chemokines and eventually
  exacerbating myocardial inflammation. TLR4 can also activate IRFs through the MyD88-independent
  signaling pathway, which further induce IFN production and ultimately exert an antiviral
  effect on myocardial inflammation. Moreover, a shift from predominant TLR4-NF-κB
  signaling pathway to the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may serve a protective role
  in myocardial inflammation. Furthermore, there might be a novel HIF-1-dependent
  non-canonical TLR4 signaling pathway during myocardial inflammation. IRF, IFN-regulatory
  factors; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
