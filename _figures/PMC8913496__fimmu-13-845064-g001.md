caption: Potential role of RhoG in the regulation of NFAT transcription activity in
  anergic T cell in canonical and alternative pathways. (A) In the classical pathway,
  antigen receptor stimulation causes the synthesis of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate
  (IP3), which opens IP3 receptor channels in the ER. The drop in ER Ca2+ concentration
  activates STIM1 and STIM2, which are needed to bind to and open CRAC channels generated
  by ORAI1 and ORAI2 proteins in the plasma membrane. CaM and the serine/threonine
  phosphatase calcineurin are then activated by Ca2+ inflow via CRAC channels. Calcineurin
  dephosphorylates numerous serine/threonine residues in the regulatory domain of
  NFAT, causing a conformational shift, nuclear localization signal exposure, and
  NFAT nuclear import. Increased nuclear localization of NFAT may thereby potentiate
  the NFAT-induced-anergy-associated gene. (B) Meanwhile, in an alternate pathway,
  Jak3 phosphorylates a single tyrosine residue within the regulatory domain of NFAT,
  downstream of the IL-7 receptor, causing nuclear translocation and activation of
  NFAT in thymocytes independent of Ca2+ signals and calcineurin. Jak3 may activate
  RhoG via Vav, causing NFAT to be localized in the nucleus. ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; STIM, stromal interaction molecule; CRAC,
  Ca2+ release-activated Ca 2+; CaM, calmodulin; Jak3, Janus kinase 3; IL-7, interleukin-7.
