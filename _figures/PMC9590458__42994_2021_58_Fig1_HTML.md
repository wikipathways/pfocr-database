caption: Proposed artemisinin biosynthetic pathway in A. annua. A. Carbon flow from
  MVA (in the cytosol) and MEP (in the chloroplast) pathways to form FDP. AACT, acetyl-coenzyme
  transferase; HMGS and HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase and reductase;
  MK, 3R-mevalonic acid kinase; PMK, mevalonic acid-5-phosphate kinase; MPDC, mevalonate
  5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase; DXS and DXR, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase
  and reductase; MCT, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; CMK,
  4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase; MDS, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; HDS and HDR, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl pyrophosphate
  synthase and reductase; IPPI, isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase; FPPS, farnesyl
  pyrophosphate synthase. B. Production of artemisinin in planta and by biological
  methods. ADS, armorpha-4,11-diene synthase; CYP71AV1, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase;
  CPR1, cytochrome P450 reductase 1; CYB5, cytochrome b5 monooxygenase; ALDH1, aldehyde
  dehydrogenase; DBR2, artemisinic aldehyde delta-11(13)-double bond reductase. Enzymes
  marked in red improved the efficiency of different oxidation steps in yeast (Paddon
  et al. )
