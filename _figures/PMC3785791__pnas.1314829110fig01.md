caption: Abbreviated pathway to illustrate cGMP production and its role in oocyte
  meiotic arrest. The action of IMPDH, which converts IMP to GMP, is blocked by mizoribine.
  However, the inhibitory effect of mizoribine can be bypassed by addition of exogenous
  guanosine downstream of IMPDH inhibition. NPR2 is a guanylyl cyclase activated by
  the ligand NPPC and produces cGMP from GTP. cGMP enters the oocyte via gap junctions,
  represented by the heavy line at the point of entry of cGMP to the oocyte. Within
  the oocyte, cGMP inhibits PDE3A, a cAMP phosphodiesterase, which, if uninhibited,
  would degrade oocyte cAMP and cause the resumption of meiosis. IMP can be produced
  either by de novo pathways or by salvage of hypoxanthine. However, as indicated
  in the text, little salvaged hypoxanthine is converted to guanylyl metabolites in
  COCs (, ) but rather may promote the de novo synthesis of IMP or prevent its loss
  from availability for conversion to GMP by IMPDH.
