caption: 'A schematic overview of a hypothesised pathway that GSK-3 is involved in
  the phosphorylation of tau: (A) The sequential cleavage process of amyloid precursor
  protein (APP) in the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathway in Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD). In the amyloidogenic pathway, the extracellular domain of APP is firstly
  cleaved by β-secretase, liberating a soluble extracellular N-terminus fragment sAPPβ
  and a transmembrane fragment AP-C99. The remaining APP-C99 is further cleaved by
  γ-secretase, generating β-amyloid (Aβ) and releasing APP intracellular domain (AICD)
  into cytosol. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by α-secretase and
  γ-secretase, releasing sAPPα, P3, and AICD. (B) One possible pathway of the activation
  of GSK-3. After binding with Fe65, AICD directly or indirectly activates GSK-3 by
  removing the phosphorylation from serine site (Ser9 of GSK-3β and Ser21 of GSK-3α).
  The activation of GSK-3 can be inhibited by GSK-3 inhibitor such as lithium. (C)
  GSK-3 phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). Tau is involved
  in the stabilisation of microtubules and axonal transport. After being abnormally
  phosphorylated by activated GSK-3, hyper-phosphorylated tau detaches from microtubules
  and causes the dissociation of microtubules.'
