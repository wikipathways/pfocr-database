caption: Novel patho-biotechnological vaccine development against Johne disease. A
  Lactobacillus strain, harbouring an expression vector encoding MAP antigens, will
  be equipped with an internalin from Listeria which will allow translocation across
  the epithelial barrier and subsequent phagocytosis by macrophages (A). In a similar
  manner to Listeria within the phagosome, a number of lactobacilli will be lysed
  allowing presentation of the expressed MAP antigens via the MHC class II pathway
  to stimulate strong CD4+ immune responses (B and C). Heterologously expressed listeriolysin
  O, from Listeria monocytogenes, will allow the Lactobacillus strain to escape the
  phagosome. (D) Expression of MAP antigens within the macrophage cytosol will stimulate
  strong CD8+ immune responses through the MHC class I pathway (E).
