caption: Metabolic pathway of vancomycin biosynthesis. Three steps are involved in
  the biosynthesis of vancomycin, and the related functional genes in and outside
  of the vcm cluster were mapped. I) The biosynthesis of its amino-acid precursors
  (right of the panel). Non-ribosomal peptide synthetase VcmD (AORI_1493) catalyzes
  free tyrosines to form tyrosyl-S-enzyme, which is hydroxylated by OxyD (AORI_1494)
  and then release as βHt by the action of Vhp (AORI_1492). Genes of pdh/hpgT/hmaS/hmO
  (AORI_1476, AORI_1491, AORI_1495-1496) are responsible for Hpg synthesis from prephenate,
  and dpgA/B/C/D (AORI_1502-AORI_1505) are responsible for Dpg synthesis using malonyl-CoA
  as the starting unit. II) The modified amino acids are assembled to form linear
  heptapeptide by NRPSs (VcmABC, AORI_1478-1480) with seven modules (M1-M7, upper
  left of the panel). A, adenylation domain; C, condensation domain; E, epimerization
  domain; T, thiolation domain; TE, thioesterase domain. III) The post-modifications
  of the linear heptapeptide (down the left side of the panel) include cyclization
  (oxyA/B/C, AORI_1482-AORI_1484), halogenation (vhal, AORI_1485), methylation (vmt,
  AORI_1490), and glycosylation (gtfDE, AORI_1486-AORI_1487). Finally, vancomycin
  is generated.
