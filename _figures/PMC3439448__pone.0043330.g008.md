caption: The predominant subcellular localization (cytosolic or nuclear) of each polypeptide
  identified is also indicated. The level of action of xTNIK, xMINK and their proteolytic
  products act within each pathway, that is down stream of ß-catenin and Dishevelled,
  is indicated. The possible targets (ß-catenin/TCF and JNK/AP-2) are, however, purely
  based on the published literature.
