caption: Sagittal view of subcortical pathways to and from the VIII cranial nerve.
  Whilst the auditory pathway ascending from the cochlear nucleus is relatively well
  established (), pathways to and from vestibular nuclei remain under investigation
  (; ). Projections to vestibular cortex via the thalamus have been investigated in
  humans through clinical observation and lesion studies (; ; ). Vestibular nuclei
  also project down the spine (not shown). © Portions of this figure were adapted
