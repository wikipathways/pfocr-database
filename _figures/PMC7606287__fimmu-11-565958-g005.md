caption: The molecular network of related genes in the TLR signaling pathway in response
  to secondary challenge by V. parahaemolyticus in the hepatopancreas (A) and hemocytes
  (B) of S. paramamosain constructed by Cytoscape. The bar chart represents the different
  expression patterns of each gene, and the different colors of the bar chart represent
  different time phases.
