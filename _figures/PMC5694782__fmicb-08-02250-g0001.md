caption: 'Critical DDR Pathways for UV induced DNA Damage: (1) UV induces an intrastrand
  lesion, causing the replication fork to stall in S-pase. (2) Exposed ssDNA is coated
  with RPA, followed by recruitment of TopBP1 and ATR/ATRIP. TopBP1 accelerates autophosphorylation
  of ATR. Claspin and CHK1 are recruited and phosphorylated, promoting fork stabilization.
  (3) This leads to Rad6/Rad18 recruitment and mono-ubiquitination of PCNA (not shown),
  triggering the switch from high fidelity replication DNA-polymerases to y-family
  polymerase Polη. (4) Then, Polη replicates past the lesion and normal replication
  can continue after a repeated polymerase switch back to the high-fidelity replication
  polymerase. (5) The lesion itself is repaired by either the FA or NER pathway. (6)
  Prolonged stalling leads to replication fork collapse into a DSB. The MRE11, Rad50
  and Nbs1 complex (not shown) is recruited to this DSB, initiating strand resection
  and recruitment/activation of ATM. (7) After strand resection, the exposed ssDNA
  is coated by RPA and ATR/ATRIP is recruited. (8) RPA is then replaced by RAD51,
  with the assistance of BRCA1 and BRCA2. (9) This facilitates homology-dependent
  single strand invasion and resolution of the lesion.'
