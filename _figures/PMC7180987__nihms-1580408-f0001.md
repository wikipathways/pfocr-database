caption: GH-induced signaling activates the MEK–ERK pathway, which causes phosphorylation
  of PPARγ at Ser273. This event results in PPARγ inactivation and FSP27 downregulation.
  The decrease in FSP27 expression leads to increased lipolysis and higher circulatory
  free fatty acids (FFAs), a hallmark of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
  PPARγ-regulated FSP27 feeds-back to stabilize PPARγ in the nucleus. Parallel to
  the above pathway, GH binding to its receptors also activates STAT5, which is a
  positive regulator of PPARγ, but the MEK–ERK activation pathway predominates to
  inactivate PPARγ. In addition, GH induces lipolysis by activating HSL and by increasing
  the de novo expression of HSL mRNA via the activation of PKC and ERK. Adrenergic
  signaling via adrenergic receptors (ARs) has a parallel role in the stimulation
  of lipolysis via activating the lipolytic cascade involving the lipases ATGL, HSL
  and MGL. Finally, insulin signalling via insulin receptors (IRs) inhibits lipolysis
  by suppressing GH-induced PKC and ERK activity as well as the adrenergic pathway.
