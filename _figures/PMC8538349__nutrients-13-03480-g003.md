caption: Melatonin metabolic pathway. Melatonin is synthesized from tryptophan and
  serotonin by a series of enzymes. * AA-NAT enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme of
  this pathway. Melatonin is catabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (like CYP1A2)
  into 6-hydroxymelatonin. ** 6-hydroxymelatonin can be excreted or sulfated and then
  excreted.
