caption: Classical Non- genomic pathway of dexamethasone in the corticosteroid therapy
  for COVID 19.Severity of the infection warrants high dosage of corticosteroid. At
  higher dosages, dexamethasone (DM) binds to the membrane-associated glucocorticoid
  receptor (GR) on the T- lymphocytes which impairs the T lymphocyte–mediated immune
  response. Simultaneously, the integrin in cytoplasm binds with GR complex and activates
  focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Moreover, the high dosages of DM also influence active
  transport of calcium and sodium ions to suppress the inflammation.
