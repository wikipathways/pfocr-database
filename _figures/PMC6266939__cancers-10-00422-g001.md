caption: 'Main components of the Hippo pathway and the current Hippo-targeted inhibitors
  discussed in this review. In mammals, the canonical Hippo pathway consists of four
  core components that function through phosphorylation: MST, SAV1, LATS, MOB1. Activated
  LATS phosphorylates YAP/TAZ, preventing them from entering the nucleus by anchoring
  them to 14-3-3 protein and/or promoting their degradation in the cytoplasm. This
  interrupts their interactions with the transcription factor TEAD family proteins,
  which subsequently inhibits cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation and
  induces apoptosis. Besides, current Hippo-targeted inhibitors discussed in this
  review, as well as their targets and major mechanisms, are shown in the figure.'
