caption: Schematic summarizing proposed signaling pathways involved in shear stress-induced
  regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production by Schlemm’s canal (SC) endothelial cells.
  Shear stress induces a variety of physiological responses in endothelial cells,
  with some pathways inducing eNOS activation and NO production. Caveolae and caveolin
  1 (CAV1) act as mechanotransducers in SC endothelial cells, initiating and integrating
  signaling cascades in response to shear stress. CAV1 binds to and negatively regulates
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and Hsp90 is necessary for Ca2+-dependent
  calmodulin-induced eNOS dissociation from CAV1 and for Akt-induced phosphorylation
  of eNOS. CAT1 and several molecules that regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentration
  localize in caveolae, enabling efficient and rapid eNOS activation in response to
  shear stress. The VEGFR/VE-cadherin/PECAM-1 mechanosensory complex regulates eNOS
  activity and NO production, and VEGFR-2 associates with CAV1 and is localized in
  endothelial caveolae. PECAM-1 is required for the mechanosensation of shear stress
  and Src activation, while VE-cadherin enables signal transmission to PI(3)K, which
  goes on to activate integrins and mediate other signaling pathways (such as Akt
  and eNOS). The glycocalyx also mediates mechanosensation of shear stress and subsequent
  downstream eNOS signaling. The Tie2/PI(3)K/Akt signaling pathway regulates shear
  stress-induced eNOS activity and NO. Finally, PIEZO1 is activated by shear stress,
  potentially regulating shear stress-induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and
  NO production.
