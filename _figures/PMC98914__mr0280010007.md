caption: The PKC pathway controls cell integrity. The PKC MAPK cascade is activated
  in response to heat and low osmotic stress and nutrient limitation. Hcs77 is a putative
  mechanosensor that is proposed to sense membrane stretch. Pkc1 is proposed to activate
  a branched pathway (one branch is the MAPK and the other is hypothetical). Rlm1
  appears to be a target for Mpk1. Solid arrows indicate activation; the dashed arrow
  is speculative. See the text for details.
