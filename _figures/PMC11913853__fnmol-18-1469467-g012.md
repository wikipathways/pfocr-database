caption: 'The differentially expressed genes implicated as top candidates for mediating
  the effect of selective breeding on behavior are often regulators of bioenergetic
  function. Red/pink indicates that a function is likely to be increased in bLR-like
  animals, green indicates increased function in bHR-like animals. 1. In the brain,
  energy is primarily released from glucose within a series of biochemical reactions
  starting with glycolysis (Sobieski et al., 2017), but it can also be released from
  other energy sources, such as fatty acid oxidation (Nsiah-Sefaa and McKenzie, 2016).
  2. Metabolites from these processes are fed into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  within the mitochondrial matrix, which generates electron donors (NADH, FADH2).
  3. Electron donors feed into the electron transport chain, which moves protons across
  the inner mitochondrial membrane to produce a gradient capable of driving energy
  output (adenosine triphosphate: ATP). This process produces reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) as a byproduct (Zeng et al., 2020). (A) bLR-like animals have a pattern of
  upregulated expression suggesting elevated oxidative phosphorylation, but potentially
  also reduced sensitivity to cellular need in a manner leading to excessive ROS production
  and neuroimmune activation under conditions of elevated activity such as stress.
  This conclusion is supported by: (I) previous evidence of elevated oxidative phosphorylation,
  including elevated activity within the electron transport chain (McCoy et al., 2019),
  (II) Upregulation of multiple gatekeepers of fatty acid oxidation, which is a form
  of energy production that can release twice as much energy as glucose metabolism
  (Schönfeld and Reiser, 2013). These gatekeepers include lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein
  receptor (Lsr), which uptakes lipoproteins into the cell, IST1 factor associated
  with ESCRT-III (Ist1), which facilitates fatty acid trafficking into peroxisomes
  to begin fatty acid oxidation (Chang et al., 2019), and peroxisomal biogenesis factor
  11 alpha (Pex11a), which encodes a fatty acid oxidation rate-limiting channel that
  allows lipids and fatty acid metabolites to pass from peroxisomes into mitochondria
  (Mattiazzi Ušaj et al., 2015; Mindthoff et al., 2016; Renne and Ernst, 2023). (III)
  Upregulation of Idh1, encoding the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 enzyme in the TCA
  cycle, which is the most important producer of the electron donor NADH in the brain
  (Gherardi et al., 2020; Molenaar et al., 2014), (IV) Upregulation of WD repeat domain
  93 (Wdr93), which is theorized to be an accessory subunit to Complex 1 in the mitochondrial
  electron transport chain, increasing ATP production (GeneCards, n.d.; InterPro,
  n.d.; Meyer et al., 2009). (V) Down-regulated expression of subunits of the m-AAA
  (ATPases Associated with a variety of cellular Activities) complex [Spastic paraplegia
  type 7 (Spg7), AFG3-like protein 1 (Afg3l1)]. Decreased m-AAA complex function causes
  constitutive activity of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) (König et al.,
  2016; Patron et al., 2018). Elevated mitochondrial calcium influx activates enzymes
  within the TCA cycle (PDH, IDH, and OGDH) (Gherardi et al., 2020), and, if it becomes
  excessive, triggers ROS production and apoptosis (Patron et al., 2018). (B) bHR-like
  animals have a pattern of upregulated expression suggesting that energy production
  is kept under tight regulation, potentially limiting oxidative phosphorylation but
  allowing for greater biosynthesis. These findings include (I) Upregulated Uncoupling
  Protein 2 (Ucp2), encoding a mitochondrial transporter which promotes homeostasis
  and decreased ROS production by decreasing the mitochondrial proton gradient, exporting
  the rate-limiting substrate for the TCA cycle (oxaloacetate), and regulating calcium
  influx (Ardalan et al., 2022; Berardi and Chou, 2014; Hass and Barnstable, 2021;
  Keita et al., 2007; Koshenov et al., 2020; Vozza et al., 2014); (II) Upregulated
  expression related to m-AAA complex function (Spg7, Afg3l1), which ensures that
  mitochondrial protein availability, including an essential regulator (EMRE) of the
  MCU, does not exceed cellular need. (III) Upregulated lipoyl(octanoyl) transferase
  2 (Lipt2), which senses the input to the TCA cycle (Acetyl-CoA) and stimulates TCA
  cycle enzyme activity accordingly via the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway
  (Habarou et al., 2017; Nowinski et al., 2020; Solmonson and DeBerardinis, 2018)'
