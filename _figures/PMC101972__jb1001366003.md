caption: Model of the P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing hierarchy. The quorum-sensing cascade
  begins with the induction of the las quorum-sensing system when cells reach a threshold
  density. Vfr induces lasR (), and the concentration of 3-oxo-C12-HSL increases to
  the point where it binds to and activates LasR. The LasR–3-oxo-C12-HSL complex induces
  genes controlled by the las quorum-sensing system, including a negative regulator
  gene (rsaL) (), rhlR, and an unidentified gene required for PQS production. PQS
  either directly or indirectly induces rhlI, which leads to the production of C4-HSL
  that binds to and activates RhlR. The RhlR–C4-HSL complex can then induce genes
  controlled by the rhl quorum-sensing system. At this time it is not known whether
  PQS is capable of directly activating RhlR or acts through another regulator. (Two
  additional unanalyzed LuxR homologs, which may play a role in the activity of PQS,
  are encoded by P. aeruginosa [www.pseudomonas.com].) Genes and proteins are indicated
  by thick arrows and unfilled circles, respectively. Plus or minus symbols indicate
  transcriptional activation or repression of the gene(s) at the end of an arrow,
  respectively. Blocking of the association between RhlR and C4-HSL by 3-oxo-C12-HSL
  is indicated by a minus symbol next to the arrow between 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL
  at the bottom of the figure. Question marks indicate an unknown member(s) of the
  PQS synthesis pathway that is affected by LasR–3-oxo-C12-HSL.
