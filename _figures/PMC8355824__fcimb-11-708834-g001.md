caption: Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway in Plasmodium species. Ca2+ inside the cytoplasm
  of parasite controls important processes for parasite survival, such as gliding
  motility, mediated by activation of PfCaM/PfPKB complex and following phosphorylation
  of the IMC member protein, GAP45. Additionally, centrins, CDPKs activation, activation
  of ookinetes and gametocytes are described as Ca2+-regulated. A GPCR-like protein,
  named as PfSR25, has been described as potential regulator in Ca2+ homeostasis in
  malaria parasites, depending on availability of potassium (K+) and mediated by IP3
  signaling. Melatonin was also described as a trigger for IP3 dependent pathways.
  Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is reported as the major storage of Ca2+ and the uptake
  of this ion possibly depends on SERCA-type Ca2+-ATPases. Ca2+ discharge depends
  on receptors activated by IP3, nonetheless, an IP3R remains to be discovered in
  Plasmodium species. The presence of V-ATPase and VP1 on the food vacuole and acidocalcisome
  membranes are related to the Ca2+ uptake upon an acidic environment maintenance.
  Acidocalcisome could also have an IP3R that allows exit of Ca2+. Calcium can also
  enter in mitochondria through Ca2+/H+ antiporter called PfCHA/PfCAX. Activation
  of PKA and PKG, by cAMP and cGMP, respectively, generated by adenylyl-cyclase (AC)
  and guanylyl-cyclase (GC), respectively, could also participate in Ca2+ homeostasis,
  however the membrane receptors that stimulate theses pathways remains to be elucidated.
  Still, upon HCO3¯ activation, AC can also stimulate Epac activation by cAMP, triggering
  IP3 signaling through PLC activation. Additionally, a cross-talk among kinases are
  also proposed to be associated to the merozoite egress mediated by proteolytic cascade
  events.
