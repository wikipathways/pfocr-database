caption: Graphical representation of effects in mammalian cells following binding
  of Shiga toxin (Stx) B subunits to cell surface receptors. Binding to Gb3/CD77 cross-links
  several receptor molecules and thereby activates signaling cascades as well as internalization
  of the complex. In human B cells, binding of Stx to Gb3/CD77 in lipid rafts induces
  an enrichment of Src kinases and initiation of the apoptosis-inducing signaling
  cascade associated with the B cell receptor. Activation of this cascade synergizes
  with apoptosis induction resulting from the cytosolic effects of Stx holotoxins.
  Cross-linking of Gb3/CD77 also causes a massive influx of extracellular Ca++ ions
  followed by an increase of intracellular cAMP concentrations, activation of protein
  kinase A (PKA) and, e.g., acute von Willebrandt factor secretion from human endothelial
  cells. Stxs also likely impact on the sphingomyelinase-ceramide pathway. Sphingomyelinase
  (SMase) catalyzes sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis. Phosphorylcholine and intracellular
  ceramide activate cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Intracellular ceramide generates
  ceramide-enriched regions in the membrane, serves as second messenger (signaling)
  and activates inflammasomes. Different pathways are affected by ceramide like the
  Ras and PLA2signaling pathway. Stx binds to the Gb3/CD77 receptor, activates the
  first two enzymes of the Gb3synthesis pathway and induces their transcription. The
  de novo synthesis is complex and occurs at the trans-Golgi network and the ER. Intermediates
  (ceramides, lactosylceramide) induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the mitochondria,
  which are linked to the depolarization of mitochondrial membranes and the release
  of cytochrome C. Furthermore, ROS can activate SMases. IL-1β and receptors, which
  undergo crosstalk with Gb3/CD77-mediated signaling pathways, activate NF-κB. Vesicles
  containing lysosomal SMases fuse with early endosomes containing TNF receptor (TNF-R1).
  Subsequently, caspase-7 is activated by caspase-8, leading to activation of SMase
  and tBid cleavage []. The mechanism has not yet confirmed to be implicated in Stx-mediated
  effects but it is reasonable to assume a possible link between SMase function and
  crosstalk of TNF-α, Gb3/CD77 receptor, and apoptosis, which are proven to be associated
  with Stx. Gb3/CD77-bound B subunit can also be translocated into the cytosol, trigger
  caspase-1 and -3 activation and directly initiate apoptosis. Pathways depicted in
  this figure are interconnected at several levels (inflammasome formation and IL-1β
  secretion; caspase activation; tBid; ROS) with pathways presented in . Dotted lines
  indicate fundamental cellular biology mechanisms not yet specifically linked to
  Stxs; for details and further references see text.
