caption: 'Stem cell metabolism. Stem cells in various tissues rely on glycolysis,
  and HIF-1α promotes glycolysis, which prevents pyruvate oxidation by suppressing
  the PDH complex. The PI3K-AKT pathway promotes ROS production by repressing FOXO.
  LKB1/AMPK regulates stem cell function. Fatty acid synthase, the main biosynthetic
  enzyme, performs the condensation of Ac-CoA and malonyl-CoA to produce the saturated
  fatty acid palmitate and other long-chain fatty acids. The PML-PPAR pathway promotes
  fatty acid oxidation through positively regulating the activity of CPT-1, which
  is the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid oxidation. The PML-PPAR pathway for fatty
  acid oxidation is required for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal by controlling
  the fate decision. Abbreviations: Ac-CoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; Acyl-CoA, acyl-coenzyme
  A; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; CPT, carnitine-O-palmitoyltransferase; FOXO,
  forkhead box O; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; LKB1, liver kinase B1; PDH,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase; PML, promyelocytic leukemia; PPAR-δ, peroxisome proliferator–activated
  receptor δ; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
