caption: Schematic representation of the gene targets of miRNA identified by NGS in
  the AIS patients and their role in osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation depicted
  from KEGG and DIANA miRPath v3. The continuous blunt end line indicates the gene
  interactions with the overexpressed miRNA. The dotted grey blunt end line indicates
  the gene interactions with the down-regulated miRNA. Osteoblast progenitor formation
  is mediated by Smad cascade signalling through the activation of the TGFβ and Wnt
  signalling pathways. Smad become phosphorylated and migrates into the nucleus, where
  it induces Runx2, Dlx5 and Sp7/Osterix transcription to induce the differentiation
  of osteoblasts. In these intricate mechanisms, microRNAs can modulate key genes
  to control osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation. miR-671–5p blocks BMPR2 and
  Smad2/3, which are key regulators on this pathway. So the down-regulation of this
  miR-671 may contribute to the osteoblast differentiation pathway. mir-27a also blocks
  BMPRI/II and thus produces the inhibition of this pathway, which is also affected
  by the miR-122 interaction with BMP4. However, the dual role of miR-27a can activate
  osteoblast differentiation by the activation of Wnt signalling through the inhibition
  of APC. In such circumstances APC do not form a complex with glycogen synthase kinase
  3 (GSK3B), so the levels of non-phosphorylated β-catenin increase and migrate to
  the nucleus, where it associates with members of the TCF/LEF transcription factors
  by controlling the gene transcription of RUNX2. However, osteoblast differentiation
  may undergo the upstream regulation of Wnt by miR-122, which alters this pathway.
  Finally, miR-223 may contribute to affect osteoclast -specific genes transcription
  and the maturation of functional osteoclasts by inhibiting NFIA, the inhibitor of
  osteoclast differentiation, which results in increased osteoclast activation.
