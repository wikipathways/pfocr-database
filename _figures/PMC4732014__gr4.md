caption: Activation of NF-κB-dependent cytokine production through lipid peroxidation.
  When non-cytotoxic levels of iron-laden particles interact with macrophages, the
  resulting lipid peroxidation in the area of the plasma membrane with which the particle
  interacts, produces a stress response that activates NF-κB and pro-inflammatory
  cytokine production. Lipid raft disruption caused by minor lipid peroxidation, results
  in the release of calcium from annexin 6 leading to the activation of phosphatidylcholine
  specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) activation that produces diacylglycerol (DAG).
  DAG then activates acidic sphingomyelinase (ASM) that produces ceramide. Ceramide
  then activates ceramide-activated protein kinase (CAPK), which phosphorylates IκB
  allowing NF-κB to migrate to the nucleus. The PC-PLC-dependent pathway can also
  be stimulated by endotoxin, again representing a non-physiological stress response
