caption: The possible central and peripheral effects of asprosin. In the hypothalamus,
  asprosin enhances the activity of AgRP neurons through activating G proteins-cAMP-PKA
  pathway, leading to increased appetite. In the liver, asprosin binds to OLFR734
  to enhance the production and release of glucose via CREB pathway. Of note, the
  orexigenic and glucogenic roles of asprosin remain controversial. In the pancreatic
  β-cells, asprosin binds to TLR4 to promote inflammation and apoptosis of these cells
  and reduce insulin secretion through stimulating TLR4/JNK-mediated pathway and inhibiting
  cAMP levels. In MSCs, asprosin prevents these cells from oxidative stress-induced
  apoptosis and death by activating ERK1/2-SOD2 pathway. In the skeletal muscle, asprosin
  activates PKCδ/SERCA2-mediated ER stress/inflammation pathways to promote IR.
