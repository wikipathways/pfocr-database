caption: Mitophagy is the specific degradation of the mitochondria in response to
  global signals, including starvation and oxidative stress, or specific signals including
  mitochondrial targeting of signalling proteins or modification of mitochondrial
  proteins. In yeast, Atg32 is specific for mitophagy by targeting the mitochondria
  to the autophagosome. In mammalian cells, Nix is involved in mitochondrial clearance
  during erythrocyte maturation. In response to reduced cellular ATP, AMPK is activated
  and phosphorylates ULK1 and ULK2 (two Atg1 homologues) to activate both general
  macroautophagy and mitophagy. Parkinson's disease genes encoding α-synuclein, parkin,
  PINK1 and DJ-1 are all involved in mitophagy. A decrease in mitochondrial membrane
  potential (ψm) can be induced by ROS, and by targeting α-synuclein to the mitochondria.
  This decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential serves as a signal for mitophagy.
  In addition to a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial fission
  is another signal for mitophagy. PINK1 facilitates parkin targeting to the mitochondria,
  and ubiquitinates the mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC. Ubiquitinated VDAC
  can be recognized by p62 to initiate mitophagy. DJ-1 senses oxidative stress and
  serves a parallel pathway to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential and preserve
  mitochondria from fragmentation. Many of the regulators of mitophagy can be regulated
  by ROS. For example, α-synuclein is nitrated and, as a consequence, increases its
  aggregation propensity. Parkin can be sulfonated and S-nitrosated. Drp1 S-nitrosation
  is also involved in regulation of mitochondrial fission and associated induction
  of mitophagy.
