caption: 'Illustration of platelet CD36 redox signaling in arterial thrombosis. Oxidized
  lipids are recognized by scavenger receptor CD36 on the platelet surface. CD36 signal
  transduction leads to H2O2 generation from NADPH oxidase. H2O2 promotes oxidative
  cysteine modification of cellular regulators of platelet activation, including SFK.
  Specifically, SFK cysteines undergo sulfenylation, which is a potential mechanism
  for activation of redox-sensitive MAPK ERK5. ERK5 links platelet CD36 signaling
  to 2 functional phenotypes: (1) platelet aggregation mediated by integrin αIIbβ3;
  and (2) procoagulant PSer externalization required for assembly of the prothrombinase
  complex to form fibrin from activated thrombin. The CD36 signaling pathway also
  cross talks with the collagen receptor GPVI pathway to augment PSer externalization.
  This redox-regulated CD36 signaling pathway promotes pathophysiologic thrombosis
  in dyslipidemia. In the absence of CD36 signaling, collagen-mediated GPVI activation
  promotes platelet integrin αIIbβ3 activation and procoagulant PSer externalization
  during thrombosis.'
