caption: 'Schematics of alcohol production via the iterative ketoacid elongation.
  (A) Synthesis of straight chain alcohols from the different 2-ketoacids with various
  chain length. Number of carbons in each 2-ketoacid is highlighted by the blue circle.
  Formation of 2-ketobutyrate via the citramalate pathway (highlighted by blue block
  arrow) follows the identical reaction chemistry as the iterative ketoacid elongation
  except homologous enzyme CimA is used here instead of LeuA due to the limited substrate
  range of LeuA. Inefficiency of wild type LeuA to extend 2-ketocaproate further is
  illustrated by the hollow block arrows. Native activity of the threonine pathway
  for 2-ketobutyrate synthesis is shown by the gray dashed arrows. Enzymes Kivd and
  YqhD were overexpressed to decarboxylate and reduce the 2-ketoacid into corresponding
  alcohol. Feeding of acetate was performed to increase supply of the iterative addition
  unit acetyl-CoA. (B) Iterative elongation cycle catalyzed by enzymes LeuABCD. The
  competition between enzymes Kivd and LeuA decides the fate of 2-ketoacid intermediates:
  the 2-ketoacids can either escape the elongation cycle by decarboxylating into aldehyde
  (green block arrow) or re-enter the cycle (black block arrow). Acetyl-CoA serves
  as the repetitive addition unit where the 2-ketoacid is extended by one carbon at
  the β position (neon blue circle) after each cycle. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.'
