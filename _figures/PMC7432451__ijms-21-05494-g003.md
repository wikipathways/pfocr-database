caption: Sialic acid of the intact glycocalyx as a checkpoint for inhibition of complement
  and microglia. (A) The alternative complement pathway is triggered by spontaneous
  hydrolysis of C3 into the active form C3b. The regulatory complement protein complement
  factor H (CFH) can bind to sialic acid residues of the host cell glycocalyx and
  form the C3b-CFH-Sia complex under physiological conditions. Thus, CFH can inhibit
  the formation of the C3 convertase (C3bBb) from the active C3b by competing with
  complement factor B. Consequently, CFH inhibits the activation of the alternative
  complement pathway on cells with intact glycocalyx. Likewise, soluble polysialic
  acid (polySia) has been shown to inhibit the activation of the alternative complement
  pathway. Furthermore, SIGLEC receptors on microglia recognize sialic acids on the
  glycocalyx and inhibit the activatory downstream response of microglia. (B) Weak
  binding of C3b on lesioned cells leads to activation of the alternative pathway
  without CFH binding. Furthermore, properdin binds to lesioned cells and promotes
  C3b activation and the formation of the active C3 convertase (C3bBb). Thus, loss
  or removal of sialic acids (SiaLoss), by neuraminidases, oxidative damage or aging
  triggers alternative complement activation and facilitates C3b activation and formation
  of the C3 convertase. Active C3b could bind to CR3 of microglia and activate the
  microglial cells via the ITAM of TYROBP/DAP12. Furthermore, other ITAM-signaling
  receptors of microglia, such as TREM2, recognize aminophospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine
  (PS), that become externalized and accessible after enzymatic removal or loss of
  the negatively charged sialic acids. The activatory receptors cannot be silenced
  by the SIGLEC receptors that fail to sense sialic acids on the altered glycocalyx
  of the lesioned cell. Bb, a subunit of complement factor B; C1q, complement component
