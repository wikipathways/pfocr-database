caption: 'A. The steps of peroxisomal ether lipid synthesis are illustrated with the
  CG numbers for each Drosophila protein listed at the right of each step. The CG
  numbers are listed in descending order with the best hit(s) in bolded, red text.
  No homolog of 1-alkyldihydroxyacetone 3-phosphate reductase could be identified
  in the Drosophila genome. B. A Phylogram of alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS)
  from multiple species was generated with ClustalW2. All vertebrate AGPS sequences
  analyzed contain a PTS2, while most non-vertebrate AGPS sequences, including Drosophila,
  have a PTS1. P. tetraurelia and P. infestans do not have identifiable PTS motifs.
  The percent identities of the Drosophila and human homologs are listed below. GNPAT:
  25%, FAR1/2: 25–38%, AGPS: 50%.'
