caption: Results of 13C-based metabolic flux analysis of E. coli BL21(DE3) (upper
  number) and mutant strains Δpgi (middle number) and ΔpfkA (lower number) during
  exponential growth on glucose. In vivo carbon fluxes in central metabolism are shown
  as millimole per hour per gram cdw. Relative to the glucose uptake rate, the confidence
  intervals were 20% for the NADPH balance, below 15% for TCA cycle and malic enzyme,
  and less than 5% for all other fluxes. Arrowheads indicate the direction of a given
  flux
