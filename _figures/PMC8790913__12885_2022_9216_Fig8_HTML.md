caption: The relationship between TYROBP network and immune-related genes in OS and
  the schematic workflow of the whole study. A-B The Venn diagram representing the
  overlapping between downregulated genes in OS, TYROBP positively correlated genes
  in OS, and immune related genes (i.e., immune stimulators, MHC molecules, chemokines
  in A, and immune inhibitors in B). C The working model representing the TNF-α-SPI1-TYROBP
  network pathway across cancer types, which can regulate immune infiltration and
  CD8+ T cell activation. D Workflow for the whole study as to how to identify the
  SPI1-TYROBP-FCER1G network and its association with immune microenvironment
