caption: Autophagy is initiated by stimuli that activate the phosphatidylinositol
  3-phosphate kinase, Vps34. Vps34 generates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, a substrate
  for the forming autophagosome, and its enzymatic activity is dependent on Beclin
  1. For its localization in the phagophore, the unclosed double-membrane precursor
  to the autophagosome, the light chain 3 (LC3) is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) via an ubiquitin-like conjugation pathway. LC3 is cleaved from its inactive
  precursor form by ATG4B to render it cytosolic, and subsequently conjugated to PE
  via its binding the E2-like ligase, autophagy related 3 homolog (ATG3), and its
  transfer to the E3-like ATG16L complex (ATG16L, ATG5, and ATG12). Autophagy can
  be stimulated via the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) via the phosphorylation and
  activation of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). Active
  PERK phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). Phospho-eIF2α
  cannot translate capped mRNAs, but can translate mRNAs with internal ribosome entry
  sites (IRES), such as activated transcription factor 4 (ATF4). ATF4 activates the
  transcription of LC3 and Beclin 1 to induce autophagy. Human tumor viruses can regulate
  autophagy at several steps of the pathway. Both latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)
  and the small surface protein of HBV (HBs) stimulate the UPR and induce autophagy.
  LMP1’s induction of autophagy regulates its degradation in autophagolysosomes. The
  Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) also can localize to autophagosomes and is
  degraded in autophagolysosomes, where epitopes of EBNA1 are generated for their
  presentation on MHC class II molecules. Autophagy fosters HBV’s productive infection.
  In addition to HBs, the Hepatitis B X protein (HBx) can stimulate autophagy via
  its interaction with Vps34. Autophagy can support HBV’s envelopment or reverse transcription.
  The non-structural proteins of HCV, NS4B and NS5B induce autophagy; the former appears
  to interact with Vps34, while the latter promotes LC3’s conjugation to PE by binding
  ATG5. Autophagy inhibits the cellular interferon response during the early stages
  of HCV’s infection. In contrast to NS5B, the KSHV viral FADD-like interleukin-1
  beta-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (v-FLIP) inhibits LC3’s lipid-conjugation
  by competing with it for ATG3. v-FLIP inhibits autophagy-induced apoptosis and senescence
  of KSHV-positive cells. Autophagy is induced by replication and transactivator (RTA)
  to support KSHV’s replication, and v-FLIP may inhibit the productive life-cycle
  of the virus by repressing autophagy.
