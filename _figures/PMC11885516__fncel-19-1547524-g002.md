caption: The dual role of reactive astrocytes. Existing studies generally agree that
  in subjects with NP, activated spinal astrocytes exhibit an A1 phenotype and promote
  the development of pain. Ror2 in spinal astrocytes regulates c-JUN and C3aR expression,
  leading to mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia by increasing A1 astrocyte
  numbers. LPAR6 activation through ROCK2 increases A1 astrocytes and decreases A2
  astrocytes via the NF-κB pathway, promoting neuropathic pain. The Notch signaling
  pathway also induces A1 astrocyte transformation, further advancing neuropathic
  pain. Reduced JMJD8 expression in spinal dorsal horn astrocytes promotes mechanical
  allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia by activating A1 astrocytes and increasing TNF-α
  and IL-6 secretion. However, activated astrocytes can also have beneficial effects
  on neuropathic pain. Neuronal IL-1α stimulates TGFβ signaling in spinal astrocytes,
  reducing glutamate release and alleviating NP. Ror2, receptor tyrosine kinase like
  orphan receptor 2; C3aR, complement C3a receptor; LPAR6, lysophosphatidic acid receptor
  6; ROCK2, rho associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor-κB; JMJD8, jumonji domain containing 8; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; IL-6,
  interleukin-6; NICD, notch intracellular domain; Hes1, hes family BHLH transcription
  factor 1; IL-1α, interleukin 1α; IL-1R1, interleukin 1 receptor type 1; TGF-β1,
