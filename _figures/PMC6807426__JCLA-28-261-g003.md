caption: The possible metabolic pathway related to oxidative stress in patients with
  Hb H disease with iron overload. Iron overload causes the increase of superoxide
  () and nitric oxide (NO) in patients with Hb H disease. Increase of  leads to compensatory
  increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and causes increase of hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2) The increased hydrogen peroxides activate regulatory antioxidant system in
  the erythrocytes, resulting increased glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione
  reductase (GRx), decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) and increased oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG) to reduce the excessive ROS. Furthermore, highly toxic, reactive hydroxyl
  radicals (OH.−) can be formed due to excessive free radicals (, NO, or H2O2), and
  leads to lipid peroxidation and generation of malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition,
  plasma vitamin C may be depleted due to iron overload and formation of excessive
  radicals (H2O2).
