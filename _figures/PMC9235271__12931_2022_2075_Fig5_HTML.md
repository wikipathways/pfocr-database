caption: Metabolic pathway analysis. Metabolic pathway changes in serum between A
  community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with and without acquired respiratory distress
  syndrome (ARDS) groups; and B before and after treatment in the CAP with ARDS group.
  Metabolic pathway changes in urine between C CAP with and without ARDS groups; and
  D before and after treatment in the CAP with ARDS group. The yellow or green shades
  represent significantly increased and decreased levels of metabolites, respectively.
  E Correlation heatmap of metabolites with clinical parameters in the community-acquired
  pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Only correlation coefficients > 0.4
  (moderate correlation) and p-values > 0.05 are highlighted. Red and blue colors
  indicate positive and negative correlations, respectively, with darker colors indicating
  higher correlations. Cho choline, Gly glycine, Glc glucose, Pyr pyruvate, Lac lactate,
