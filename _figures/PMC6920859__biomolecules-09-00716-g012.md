caption: 'Schematic representation of the proposed signaling pathway by which MP attenuates
  FBS-induced inflammation of arteriolar SMC. The diagram displays key events of VSMC
  inflammation, and the molecular effectors by which MP attenuates these events. Red
  arrows are established by our study, blue arrows are established as referenced below:
  FAK → ERK1/2 [,]; SM22α → ERK1/2 []; ERk1/2 → osteopontin []; ERK1/2 → p21/p27 [];
  ERK1/2 → caspase-3, BAX/Bcl2 [,]; Osteopontin → proliferation []; Osteopontin →
  α SM and calponin []; p21, p27 → Cyclin D1/CDK4 [,]; NF-κB → MMP-2, MMP-9 [,,];
  NF-κB → proliferation, migration []; NF-κB → cyclin D1 [,].'
