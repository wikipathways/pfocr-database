caption: Synthesis and turnover of complex sphingolipids along with actin dynamics
  are regulated by PI4,5P2 and the Slm1 and Slm2 proteins. PI4,5P2, synthesized by
  Stt4 and Mss4 on the plasma membrane, in cooperation with the TORC2 and the Pkh1/2
  protein kinases are proposed to activate Slm1 and Slm2. The Slm proteins then impair
  turnover of complex sphingolipids, particularly IPC, by inhibiting Isc1 and they
  also regulate the calcium/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin which
  dephosphorylates and inactivates the Slm proteins and also interacts with Csg1/2
  in an unknown manner to regulate conversion of IPC to MIPC by the Csg1/2 enzymes.
  Regulation of the Rho1/Pkc1 pathway by Slm1/2 works independently from regulation
  of sphingolipid metabolism. Genetic interactions suggest that IPC plays a role in
  actin organization, but the mechanism is unknown. Pkh1/2 are probably attached to
  eisosomes (not shown) as depicted in . Adapted from ref.
