caption: Mechanism of pyroptosis and necroptosis. Above is the regulation pathway
  of pyroptosis. The activation of inflammatory corpuscles will activate intracellular
  caspases. GSDMD protein is cleaved by activated caspases to form GSDMD‐NT with perforation
  activity, which forms tiny pores on the cell membrane, changes the osmotic pressure
  inside the cell and promotes the occurrence of apoptosis. At the same time, inflammatory
  factors activated in cells will also be released to the extracellular space through
  pores, triggering inflammatory reactions. Below is the regulatory pathway of necroptosis.
  After TNFR on the cell membrane binds to the ligand, it starts the assembly of intracellular
  complex and phosphorylates the downstream MLKL. Phosphorylated MLKL has perforation
  activity, forming pores on the cell membrane and inducing necrotic apoptosis.
