caption: A schematic illustration of the role of several lncRNAs in regulating the
  IFN signaling pathway in several human diseases, including autoimmune conditions
  and viral infections. Accumulating evidence has illustrated that lncRNAs modulating
  IFN signaling cascade could participate in the pathogenesis of various kinds of
  human cancers as well as immune-related disorders. It has been reported that lncRNA
  RP11-2B6.2 could play an important role as a positive regulator of type I INF signaling
  pathway in Lupus Nephritis via up-regulating the expression levels of IFIT-1/3,
  ISG, Mx2, CXCL10, JAK1, STAT-1, TYK2, and decreasing SOCS1 expression (). Moreover,
  another research has revealed that lncRNA loc107051710 could elevate the expression
  levels of IFN-α, IFN-β, Mx1, STAT-1/2, OAS via modulating IRF8, thereby enhancing
  the antiviral activity of ISGs to prevent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV)
  infection (). Blue lines indicate the positive regulatory effect among lncRNAs and
  their targets, and brown lines depict a negative one among them. All the information
  regarding the role of these lncRNAs involved in the modulation of the IFN signaling
  cascade in various types of immune deficiency diseases and cancers can be seen in
  .
