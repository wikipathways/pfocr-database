caption: 'Schematic diagram of anti-metastatic mechanisms of herbal medicine in colorectal
  cancer: Herbal medicines suppress angiogenesis, migration and invasion via inactivation
  of diverse HIF-1α pathways. Tumor hypoxia results from the imbalance between the
  oxygen supply and demand due to the uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation. Under
  hypoxic condition, HIF-1α expression is accumulated as a pro-angiogenic factor,
  which is mainly involved in MMP-2 production. Hypoxia also activates the phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 and AKT, which make cancer cell migration and invasion possible. Over-activation
  of mTOR, the key regulator of cancer progression, is frequently associated with
  activation of HIF-1α, which stimulates tumor genesis, angiogenesis, and tumor growth
  through VEGF. Furthermore, herbal medicine suppress metastasis by impeding EMT-related
  cascades. EMT refers to the development of mesenchymal cells through a series of
  changes in epithelial cells, playing an important role in the cancer cells growth
  via regulation of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. TGF-β activates the
  Smad pathway, which leads to other EMT-related protein expressions. In the same
  way, TGF-β1 modulates ZEB leading to EMT and miR-200 expression. TNF-α also induces
  nuclear translocation of Snail via AKT/GSK-3β pathway. Meanwhile, herbal medicine
  can serve similarly with antagonists of 5-HTR1D suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signal
  transduction via β-catenin degradation. 5-HTR1D influences the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  at the upper stream, leading to stabilization of β-catenin in cells. MMP-7 is transcribed
  in response to Wnt-β-catenin signaling which assists the degradation of extra-cellular
  matrix (ECM), a critical event in tumor invasion and metastasis. In terms of immune
  regulation, herbal medicine can enhance certain plasma cytokines such as GM-CSF,
  increasing the number of macrophages in the spleen which contribute to the immune
  response and the prolongation of survival time. Abbreviation: AF, Arctii Fructus
