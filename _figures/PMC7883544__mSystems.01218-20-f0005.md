caption: 'Collagen utilization pathway scheme in MAG BB5. (A) The gene cluster in
  BB5 spans approximately 21 kb, comprising 15 genes for collagen utilization, each
  color-coded respective to its functional group: orange for collagen hydrolysis,
  blue for uptake and transport, green for proline (Pro) utilization, ocher for hydroxyproline
  (Hyp) utilization, and brown for unknown function. The purple box is indicative
  of a signal peptide for secretion. (B) Metabolic model for collagen utilization
  in Colwellia BB5. Arrows and genes are color-coded in the same functional groups
  as in panel A. Dashed arrows point to a major metabolic pathway. Metabolite abbreviations:
  P4C (1-pyrroline 4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate), KGSA (alpha-ketoglutarate semialdehyde),
  KG (alpha-ketoglutarate), P5C (1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate). Enzyme abbreviations:
  d-aa dHase (d-hydroxyproline dehydrogenase), dAminase (pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate
  deaminase), di-oxo dHase (KGSA dehydrogenase), P5CR/ornithine dAminase (bifunctional
  1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase/ornithine cyclodeaminase), PRODH (proline dehydrogenase),
  P5CDH (pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase).'
