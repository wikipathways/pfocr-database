caption: Interactions in the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) Affecting Lung Cancer Progression.
  This figure illustrates the interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME)
  that contribute to lung cancer progression. Various components, including stromal
  cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM M2), pro-tumorigenic macrophages (PAM),
  regulatory T cells (Treg), dendritic cells (DC), natural killer (NK) cells, and
  myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), play significant roles in modulating immune
  responses and tumor growth. Stromal cells provide structural support and secrete
  growth factors that promote tumor proliferation. TAM M2 cells release VEGFA, stimulating
  angiogenesis and increasing blood supply to the tumor. Pro-tumorigenic macrophages
  (PAM) also interact with immune cells, promoting an inflammatory environment that
  favors tumor survival. Regulatory T cells (Treg) produce IL-10, which suppresses
  the activity of effector T cells and other immune cells, facilitating tumor immune
  evasion. The mTOR pathways (mTOR1 and mTOR2) regulate Treg function and T cell differentiation,
  contributing to an immunosuppressive environment that supports tumor growth. Myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSC) and dendritic cells (DC) secrete immunosuppressive cytokines
  such as IL-6 and TGF-β, which inhibit the anti-tumor activity of NK cells and T
  cells. miR-26a-5p further modulates these pathways, enhancing immune suppression.
  These complex interactions within the TME collectively create an environment that
  promotes immune escape, angiogenesis, and tumor progression
