caption: LGG® effector molecules protect the intestinal epithelium. LGG® pili ensure
  colonization and close contact with the epithelium. Secreted and cell wall associated
  p40 proteins activate EGFR and downstream signaling, promoting mucus secretion,
  cell survival, and maintaining cellular tight and adherens junctions. Additionally,
  p40 induces mucosal epigenetic imprinting, resulting in sustained TGF-β secretion
  by epithelial cells, driving regulatory T-cell differentiation. EPS from LGG® protect
  tight junctions and reduce oxidative stress via the Nrf2-Keap1-ARE signaling pathway,
  while LTA directs the migration of protective prostaglandin-expressing mesenchymal
  stem cells to areas near epithelial stem cells. Extracellular vesicles mirror these
  effects through their cargo of LGG®-derived molecules. Tryptophan metabolites within
  extracellular vesicles activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, preserve tight junctions,
  and promote IL-22 secretion in lymphocytes. This, in turn, stimulates the release
  of antimicrobial peptides from Paneth cells. See text for abbreviations
