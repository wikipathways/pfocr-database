caption: JNK modulates keratinocyte production of inflammatory cytokine/chemokines
  and recruitment of immune cells in psoriasis. Tissue damage signals (e.g., DAMPs,
  CCN1) activate the JNK signaling pathway in keratinocytes (KC), resulting in increased
  expression and release of inflammatory chemokines (e.g., CCL20, and hβD-2) and cytokines
  (e.g., IL-6, IL-8 IL-23, IFNγ, and TNFα). These molecules not only propagate inflammatory
  signals in keratinocytes, but also stimulate recruitment and activation of Th1/Th17
  immune cells, which produce additional cytokines (e.g., IL-17, IL-22, and hβD-2),
  leading to propagated dysregulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation
  and consequently development of psoriasis.
