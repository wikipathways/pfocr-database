caption: Hypothetical Model for the Functions of Mst50 in M. grisea.Mst11 and Mst7
  are the MEKK and MEK that activate Pmk1. Mst50 interacts with both Mst11 and Mst7
  and may function as the adaptor protein for the Pmk1 MAP kinase pathway. The Gβ
  subunit Mgb1, a Cdc42 homolog, and Ras proteins Ras1 and Ras2 all directly interact
  with Mst50. These proteins may be responsible for transducing various upstream signals
  to activate the Mst11-Mst7-Pmk1 cascade for regulating different plant infection
  processes via the Mst12 and other transcription factors (TFs). Mst50 and Mst11 are
  likely involved in crosstalking with the cell wall integrity and osmoregulation
  pathways. Ras2 may function above the cAMP signaling pathway that regulates surface
  recognition and appressorium initiation.
