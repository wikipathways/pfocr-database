caption: Model for EGFR-dependent MAPK activation. EGFR acts as a central point linking
  all upstream ligand signals on MAPK activation. The ligands that lead to the EGFR-dependent
  MAPK activation can be lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), endothelin, carbachol, angiotensin,
  bradykinin, GH, prolactin, integrin, and IGF-I. All ligands mediated by their membrane
  receptors induced MAPK activation via a linear activation of MMP2 and -9, cleavage
  of HB-EGF, and activation of the EGFR. The circle on the right is our proposed pathway
  of E2-induced MAPK activation. The E2/ERα complex on the cell membrane interacts
  with IGF-IR and co-opts the IGF-IR pathway to signal through MMP2 and -9, HB-EGF,
  and the EGFR, leading to the MAPK activation.
