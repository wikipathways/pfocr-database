caption: Dysregulation of signaling pathways in HAE. (1) When activated by trace amounts
  of factor XIIa, plasma prekallikrein and factor XII cleave each other to generate
  kallikrein and factor XIIa. (2) Kallikrein cleaves HMW plasma kininogen, leading
  to (3) the release of bradykinin. (4) Plasma kallikrein cleaves factor XIIa, leading
  to (5) activation of complement and (6) fibrinolytic pathways. In the top figure,
  the increase in bradykinin levels results in angioedema. Bradykinin binds bradykinin
  B1 and B2 receptors on vascular endothelial cells, leading to an increase in vascular
  permeability. In the bottom figure, (7) C1-INH inhibits factor XIIa, the complement
  pathway, and kallikrein, thus leading to a decrease in bradykinin production and
  reduced activation of bradykinin B1 and B2 receptors on vascular endothelial cells.
  C1-INH, C1 esterase inhibitor; HAE, hereditary angioedema; HMW, high molecular weight.
