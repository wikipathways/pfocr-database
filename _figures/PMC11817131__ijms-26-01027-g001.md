caption: 'Overview of the signaling network of endothelial, antioxidative, metabolic,
  and lipoprotein biomarkers and their effect on vascular tone through exercise (EC:
  endothelial cell; VSMC: vascular smooth muscle cell). HDL and LDL are predominantly
  synthesized in the liver, leptin is primarily secreted by adipose tissue, and fT3
  is produced in the thyroid gland. The bloodstream serves as the central transport
  medium, delivering these molecules to their respective target sites. Upon binding
  to their cellular receptors, each biomarker activates its respective pathway, ultimately
  leading to eNOS activation and subsequent NO release. By contrast, the LDL–LOX-1
  signaling pathway leads to an inhibition of eNOS, reducing NO production'
