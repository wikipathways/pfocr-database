caption: LPCAT3-dependent hepatic lipid metabolism pathway. In the liver, the FXR
  regulates cholesterol metabolism by upregulating the expression of PPAR. PPAR directly
  influences LPCAT3, thereby promoting the expression of SREBP-1c to regulate lipid
  metabolism. FXR also enhances the expression of SHP, leading to the downregulation
  of LXR. LXR, an upstream regulator of LPCAT3, upregulates LPCAT3 expression, which
  subsequently elevates SREBP-1c expression and promotes lipid metabolism. Additionally,
  FXR directly inhibits SREBP-1c expression, further influencing lipid metabolism.
  LPCAT3, lyso-phosphatidyl-choline acyltransferase 3; FXR, farnesoid X receptor;
  PPAR, peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein-1c; SHP, small heterodimer partner; LXR, liver X receptor alpha; FA, fatty
  acid; LDL, low density lipoprotein; TG, triglyceride; VLDL, very LDL
