caption: Proposed roles of AR and WNT signaling in mammary gland development and breast
  cancer. In breast cells, activated androgen/AR binds to ARE or ERE in its target
  genes. In ERα+ cells, it largely works as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting estrogen/ERα
  signaling and/or WNT signaling; in ERα− cells or even in ERα+ cells that have become
  resistant to hormone therapy (targeting the estrogen/ER pathway), AR may function
  as an oncoprotein by activating WNT signaling and/or other oncogenic pathways. Under
  different cellular contexts, AR may utilize different co-regulators (e.g., LSD1,
  or other co-regulators remain to be defined (X?, Y?, or Z?)) to control distinct
  downstream programs.
