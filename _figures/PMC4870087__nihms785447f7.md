caption: Left, in healthy individuals, ETAR couples predominantly to Gαq/11, which
  promotes PLCβ4 activation and the expression of DLX5/6 transcription factors required
  for neural crest cell differentiation and normal craniofacial development. Right,
  in type I ACS patients, ACS-associated Gαi3 mutants bind with high affinity to ETAR
  and form an unproductive complex. This reduces the availability of ETAR for Gαq
  activation, which blocks the signaling pathway required for normal craniofacial
  development.
