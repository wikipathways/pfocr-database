caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for the GBS pigment granadaene. (A and B) Predicted
  functions of the cyl operon proteins and proposed biosynthetic pathway for synthesis
  of the GBS pigment using acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, ornithine, and rhamnose. CylD
  conjugates the elongating malonyl CoA units to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) AcpC.
  CylI links the malonyl CoA to an initial fatty acid–ACP complex, beginning the fatty
  acid biosynthesis-like pathway. CylG reduces the 3-keto group to a hydroxyl group,
  which is further reduced to an alkene by CylZ. The cyl operon lacks an enoyl-ACP
  reductase thereby eliminating the final reduction of the alkene to an alkane. The
  unsaturated fatty acid serves as a substrate for further elongation by CylI, accounting
  for the large degree of unsaturation in the pigment. After 13 total rounds of elongation,
  the fatty acid is conjugated to ornithine by CylE, and glycosylated by CylJ. CylX,
  CylF, and CylK likely function upstream or downstream of this pathway. CylX is homologous
  to a component of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which generates malonyl-CoA. CylF
  is an aminomethyltransferase, likely involved in production of the methylated derivative
  seen in the mass spectrum (Fig. S2). CylK is a putative phosphopantetheinyl transferase,
  which is involved in the activation of acyl carrier proteins. Although GBS has a
  separate fatty acid biosynthesis (fab) operon, deletion of genes in the cyl operon
  (ΔcylX-K, ) abolishes pigment biosynthesis suggesting that the fab and cyl operons
  are not functionally redundant.
