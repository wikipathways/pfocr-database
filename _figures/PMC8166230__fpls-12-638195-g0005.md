caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of polyamine conjugates. Levels of detectable metabolites
  are expressed as fold/ISTD (Internal Standard: formononetin) in parental lines “67/3”
  (male) and “305E40” (female) and the F1 progeny. Metabolites marked in red were
  identified by the untargeted analysis.'
