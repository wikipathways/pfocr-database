caption: 'Interactions between MAPK signaling with cells in the tumor microenvironment
  (TME). The p38 MAPK pathway plays a key role in positive interactions between MAPK
  signaling with tumor-promoting cells within the TME, including cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs), cancer stem cells (CSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs),
  and regulatory T cells (Tregs), which, together with the exchange of signals with
  antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), provide an immunosuppressive system for
  cancer progression. MAPK interactions with CAF, CSCs, and TAMs also promote tumor
  growth and metastasis. Figure created using Servier Medical Art by Servier, which
