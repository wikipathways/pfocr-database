caption: 'The pathogenesis of AAV and the inhibition of the binding of biological
  agents. The mechanism of the onset of AAV in the immune and complement systems in
  various cell types is illustrated. T cells: Etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab
  as TNF-α inhibitors and alemtuzumab as an anti-CD52 inhibitor have been used for
  the treatment of AAV because they block the cytokine signaling pathway. By containing
  CTLA4, abatacept blocks the engagement of CD28 on the surface of T cells by B7.1
  (CD80) or B7.2 (CD86) on the surface of APCs or B cells with its ligand, thereby
  inhibiting T-cell activation. B cells: B cells also act as APCs for T lymphocytes,
  and they produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that are useful for T-cell hyperactivity
  and neutrophil priming. Immunotherapies targeting B cells (depletion of B cells
  with rituximab and blockade of BLyS by belimumab) reduce the recruitment of these
  effector cells at the site of immune complex deposition, thereby reducing inflammation
  and tissue damage. Eosinophils: IL-5 is produced by Th2 cells and induces differentiation
  and maturation of human eosinophils. By neutralizing IL-5, mepolizumab inhibits
  the IL-5 signaling pathway and may be a therapeutic option for patients with EGPA.
  Complement system: Eculizumab and avacopan bind C5 and C5aR with picomolar affinity
  and inhibit the enzymatic activation by C5 convertases. Others: The binding of ANCA
  to these autoantigens activates neutrophils attached to the vascular endothelium.
  Degranulation of neutrophils releases ROS and NETs that damage the vascular endothelium.
