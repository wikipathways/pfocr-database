caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis of genes differentially expressed during the
  transition from differentiation day 0 to day 1 common to emerin-null cells and wildtype
  cells. (A) The Cell Cycle G1/S checkpoint regulation pathway is significantly enriched
  in both wildtype and emerin-null cell during transition from day 0 to day 1 of differentiation.
  The network was generated through the use of IPA (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com)
  on normalized mRNA values. Nodes represent molecules in a pathway, while the biological
  relationship between nodes is represented by a line (edge). Edges are supported
  by at least one reference in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. The intensity of color
  in a node indicates the degree of up- (red) or down- (green) regulation. Brown colored
  nodes (up-regulation) and blue colored nodes (down-regulation) indicate additional
  nodes in the pathway that are uniquely altered in emerin-null cells. Nodes are displayed
  using shapes that represent the functional class of a gene product (Circle = Other,
  Nested Circle = Group or Complex, Rhombus = Peptidase, Square = Cytokine, Triangle
  = Kinase, Vertical ellipse = Transmembrane receptor). Edges are marked with symbols
  to represent the relationship between nodes (Line only = Binding only, Flat line
  = inhibits, Solid arrow = Acts on, Solid arrow with flat line = inhibits and acts
  on, Open circle = leads to, Open arrow = translocates to). (B) Biological Function
  Analysis predicts activation of differentiation of muscle precursor cells in both
  wildtype cells and emerin-null cells during transition from day 0 to day 1 of differentiation
  (p-value: <0.001; Z-score: 1.350). The figure represents genes that are associated
  with a particular biological function that are altered in the uploaded dataset.
  Genes that are up-regulated are displayed within red nodes and those down-regulated
  are displayed within green nodes. The intensity of the color in a node indicates
  the degree of up-(red) or down-(green) regulation. The shapes of the nodes reflect
  the functional class of each gene product: transcriptional regulator (horizontal
  ellipse), transmembrane receptor (vertical ellipse), enzyme (vertical rhombus),
  cytokine/growth factor (square), kinase (inverted triangle) and complex/group/other
  (circle). An orange line indicates predicted upregulation, whereas a blue line indicates
  predicted downregulation. A yellow line indicates expression being contradictory
  to the prediction. Gray line indicates that direction of change is not predicted.
  Solid or broken edges indicate direct or indirect relationship, respectively.'
