caption: Pathway of Fbw7-mediated degradation. A putative Fbw7 substrate either harbors
  a negatively charged amino acid in the +4 position or is phosphorylated by a kinase
  at this position. It is then phosphorylated by an additional priming kinase, which
  allows the interaction of the substrate with the SCFFbw7 complex. Fbw7 holds the
  substrate in close proximity to the E2 enzyme (ubc), which enables the covalent
  conjugation of ubiquitin. The addition of polyubiquitin targets the substrate for
  degradation by the proteasome. Alternatively, a deubiquitinating enzyme removes
  covalently bound ubiquitn from the substrate preventing its degradation effectively
  stabilizing the substrate. Data discussed in this review show that Fbw7 regulates
  the stability of proteins that have been associated with proliferation suggesting
  Fbw7-mediated proteasomal degradation is a mechanism important to the maintenance
  of cellular quiescence. Conversely, antagonists to this pathway lead to cellular
  proliferation.
