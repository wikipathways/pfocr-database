caption: Schematic representation of main interactions within the regulatory network.
  In gonadal fate determination of mammals, Sry initiates activation of the male pathway
  (blue) through up‐regulation of Sox9. Dmrt1 is not only important for keeping the
  male pathway on but also in suppressing the two female networks (red). These two
  female networks involve Foxl2 as well as the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathways. Maintenance
  of gonadal identity in the differentiated gonads is a result of the cross‐inhibition
  activities of Dmrt1 and Foxl2. A critical equilibrium between these conflicting
  pathways underlies the bipotentiality of the gonadal somatic cells. Tipping the
  balance into one direction or the other will regulate the gonadal fate as a consequence
  of the activation of the male or female pathways. Solid lines define negative regulations.
  Dashed lines designate positive regulations. Beside the Sry ancestor Sox3 and Dmrt1,
  other genes (pink) can become the master sex‐determining genes by similarly impacting
  on the seesaw between the male and female programme.
