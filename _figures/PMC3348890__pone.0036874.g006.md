caption: Activation of GABAA receptors generates a depolarised plasma membrane and
  activation of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). The intracellular Ca2+
  concentration increases and leads to up-regulation of immediate early genes . c-Fos
  and c-Jun form the Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) complex that represses the expression
  of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitors (p27KIP1) and cyclin-cyclin dependent
  kinases (Cdks) are free to promote cell cycle progression. Growth factors work through
  the same pathway to stimulate the expression of immediate early genes.
