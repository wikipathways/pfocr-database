caption: Pathways and proteins involved in trafficking of CoQ6 to and from mitochondria.
  See text for the description of gene products that are involved in transport of
  CoQ6 in yeast. The endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES)
  is formed by Mdm10 and Mdm34 at the outer mitochondrial membrane, Mdm12 in the cytosol,
  and Mmm1 on the ER membrane. Septin filaments are hetero-oligomeric complexes composed
  of septin subunits, including Cdc10, Cdc3, Cdc12, Cdc11, and sometimes Shs1. PP2A,
  protein phosphatase 2A. Dashed lines denoted with question marks indicate postulated
  pathways of CoQ trafficking. Created with Biorender.com (Accessed on 25 May 2023)
