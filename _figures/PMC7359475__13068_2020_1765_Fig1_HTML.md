caption: 'Network investigated in this work. The metabolic map shows the steps involved
  in the biochemical conversion of glucose to isoprenoids. Isoprenoid biosynthesis
  can occur via the two orthogonal 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP, blue
  arrows) and mevalonate (MVA, orange arrows) pathways. For the MEP pathway, the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose
  5-phosphate reductoisomerase (dxr) gene is shown. This gene is targeted for inactivating
  the endogenous isoprenoid pathway. Both modules branch from the central metabolism
  and converge to isopentenyl-diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl-diphosphate (DMAPP),
  which are the precursors of all isoprenoids. Moreover, the biosynthetic pathway
  of the storage compound poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is included (box with red outline).
  This consists of two enzymatic reactions encoded by the genes phaB and phaC1 and
  phaC2 (both in green). The network includes also the schematic representation of
  the Krebs cycle, which includes conversion of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OXO) to succinyl-CoA.
  Eventually, accumulation of PYR or 2-OXO can result in their secretion in the medium
  (boxes with yellow and light-blue outline, respectively). Additionally, conversion
  of (R)-3hydroxybturyryl-CoA ((R)-3HB-CoA) to (R)-3HB can result in the secretion
  of the latter compound (box with purple outline). Other abbreviations: reduced flavodoxin
  (Fld), ferredoxin (Fd), red: reduced, ox: oxidized. GAP (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate),
