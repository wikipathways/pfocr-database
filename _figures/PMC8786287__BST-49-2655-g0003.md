caption: 'Super-complexes formation undergoes to adaptation upon different metabolic
  conditions. During development, the formation of super-complexes follows a genetically
  coordinated timing. Exercise improves super-complexes formation probably trough
  a ROS/UPR/PERK mediated pathway. Endoplasmic reticulum stress response triggers
  SCs assembly through the PERK axis that activates both SCAF1 expression and cristae
  formation. The accumulative damage may be due to ROS increasing is responsible of
  super-complexes damage during aging and probably also in diabetes mellitus (DM)
  and heart failure. The massive dependency on anabolic reactions of cancer cells
  could be responsible of the super-complexes increase. Diet and in particular the
  ratio NADH/FADH2 modulate super-complexes distribution through RET. The different
  expression levels of SCAF1 in different tissues could be responsible of the variability
  in CIII2 + IV and CI + III2 + IV amount. Expression data obtained from Human Protein
  Atlas available from http://www.proteinatlas.org. The following pdb structures were
  used to develop this figure: CI (5xtd, Homo sapiens), CIII2 (5xte, Homo sapiens)
  and CIV (5z62, Homo sapiens).'
