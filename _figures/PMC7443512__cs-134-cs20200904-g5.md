caption: (1) Commercially available angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, such as losartan
  and derivates, could act by mitigating the deleterious effects of AT1R activation
  in COVID-19 []. Activation of such signaling cascade results in RAS up-regulation
  and leads to pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects in infected tissues []. (2)
  Blockage of RAS can prevent tissue damage in COVID-19 patients []. (3) The use of
  ACE inhibitors may also contribute to decrease of the response of RAS system [].
  (4) Inhibitors of serine protease such as TMPRSS2 may prevent the cleavage of S1
  and S2 domains in the viral spike (S) protein, decreasing the ability of SARS-CoV-2
  to infect cells []. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the major cytokines involved
  in COVID-19 progression, which leads to CRS and tissue damage due to severe inflammation
  []. The use of commercially available molecules, such as the monoclonal antibody
  against the IL-6 receptor, (5) Tocilizumab [] and (6) Baricitinib [,], an inhibitor
  of the JAK/STAT pathway, can halt inflammation and mitigate deleterious effects
  related to IL-6. (7) Upon viral entry and denudation, viral RNA is released and
  translated into immature precursor proteins by the host ribosome machinery. These
  precursor proteins are processed by viral proteases and then form the mature replication
  complex RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which enables viral RNA replication.
  Part of the expanded RNA is translated into structural proteins, such as envelope,
  spike and nucleocapsid that will form and release novel virions [,]. The specific
  RdRp mediated RNA replication can be inhibited by selective drugs, such as Remdesivir
  [] and Favipiravir [], rendering the virus unable to propagate and, consequently,
  halting the infection.
