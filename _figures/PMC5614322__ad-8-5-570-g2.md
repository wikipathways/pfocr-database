caption: Many pathological alterations, including mechanical stress, inflammatory
  response, transcriptional and pathway negative regulations, and genetic mutations,
  can cause activation of BMP and TGF-β signaling. As a result, Smads/Smad4 and MAPK
  are upregulated and transcriptions of Sox9, Runx2 and Osterix are increased, which
  modulates the differentiation and proliferation of MSCs, osteoblasts and chondrocytes
  and ultimately causes OPLL formation and advancement.
