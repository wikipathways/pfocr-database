caption: The role of LK signaling and ABLKs in a post-mating defensive response. (A)
  Pathway that regulates a defensive wing retraction response in female flies [].
  Mechanosensory cells in the wing margin send axons to the mesothoracic neuromere
  of the ventral nerve cord (VNC). They synapse on interneurons (CTNs) that modulate
  motoneurons, which retract the wings (not shown). A set of sensory cells (UNs) in
  the uterus synapse with the ABLKs. After mating, these UNs are stimulated by contents
  (not sex peptide) in the semen and activate the ABLKs. The ABLKs in turn activate
  the CTNs, and the defensive response is strengthened. (B) Diagram of the circuit
  regulating the defensive response. Virgin female flies do not display this wing
  defense response. This is ensured by a pathway where sensory inputs (courtship song
  and pheromones) to female-specific neurons that express the gene doublesex (Dsx)
  use GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) to inhibit the CTNs. In mated flies, the UNs in the
  uterus activate ABLKs and the CTNs enhance the defensive response. A was drawn based
  on data in [] and B was redrawn from a figure in [].
