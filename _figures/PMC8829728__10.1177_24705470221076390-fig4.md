caption: Summary of the inhibitory actions of high-dose LBP. (I) LBP mediates LPS
  transfer to lipoproteins and (2) chylomicrons, which sequesters LPS, attenuates
  its stimulatory effects, and leads to its intestinal excretion via the liver–bile
  duct pathway. (3) LBP supresses the transfer of LPS to membrane-bound CD14 (mCD14)
  and subsequently to TLR4–MD2. (4) LBP facilitates the binding of a series of phosphatidylinositides
  (PtdIns) and phosphatidylserine (PS) to mCD14, and this inhibits LPS–mCD14 binding
  and LPS-induced responses. (5) LBP can also cause the dissociation of LPS from mCD14.
  (6) The LBP–LPS complex may also remain associated with mCD14 to form a ternary
  LBP–LPS–mCD14 complex that does not trigger signalling and is eventually internalised.
  (7) Cellular uptake may also proceed by a CD14-independent pathway. (8) LBP can
  inhibit the transfer of LPS from soluble CD14 (sCD14) to soluble MD2 (sMD2). (9)
  LBP can bind and intercalate into LPS aggregates, which has an inhibitory effect.
  The LBP–LPS complex cannot intercalate into the membrane, cannot bind LPS into the
  membrane and cannot interact with membrane-bound LBP. LBP can also mediate the crosslinking
  of several layers of lipid A, thereby decreasing its accessibility. It has also
  been proposed that by opsonising LPS aggregates at high density, LBP causes steric
  hindrance to other molecules such as CD14.
