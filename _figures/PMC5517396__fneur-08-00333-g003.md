caption: Riboflavin is an essential determinant of the kynurenine pathway (). Kynurenine
  pathway is the main tryptophan catabolism pathway, with neuroactive metabolites
  known as kynurenines. This pathway is determined by vitamin B2 status, indicated
  by plasma riboflavin, and B6 status, indicated by circulating PLP; since both vitamins
  are essential cofactors. Flavin adenine dinucleotide is required for the formation
  of 3-hydroxykynurenine. PLP is required for the formation of anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid, kynurenic acid, and xanthurenic acid. TDO, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase; IDO,
  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; KAT, kynurenine aminotransferase; KYNU, kynureninase;
  KMO, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; B2, riboflavin.
