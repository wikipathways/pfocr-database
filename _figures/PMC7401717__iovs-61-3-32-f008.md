caption: A mechanism map depicting the role of the miR-224-3p/LATS2/Hippo-YAP axis
  in the progression of retinoblastoma. miR-224-3p targets and negatively regulates
  LATS2 to inhibit the YAP/TAZ phosphorylation, whereby the Hippo signaling pathway
  activation is inhibited; following that, the downstream genes CTGF and CYR61 are
  upregulated, by which the apoptosis of retinoblastoma cells is suppressed while
  proliferation and angiogenesis are promoted.
