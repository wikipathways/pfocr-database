caption: Biosynthetic manifold illustrating the proposed mechanism of FPP cyclization
  reactions catalyzed by EIZS and its site-specific mutants. The product numbering
  is identical to that in Figure . The predominant products of wild-type EIZS and
  certain EIZS mutants are highlighted in cyan and blue boxes, respectively, and side
  products are highlighted in yellow boxes; product percentages are listed in Table
  . For the sake of clarity, farnesene isomers 2 and 3 generated at low levels (1%)
  by wild-type EIZS are not shown, nor is acora-3,5-diene (14) generated at low levels
  (2%) by F95V EIZS. With regard to product stereochemistry, it should be noted that
  the determination of the absolute configuration of the (+)-epi-isozizaene produced
  by EIZS has been previously reported. Although the absolute configurations of (+)-prezizaene
  (16) and (+)-zizaene (17) produced by EIZS mutants have not been directly determined,
  they can be provisionally assigned from the natural cyclization mechanism, because
  they represent simple late-stage diversions of the pathway. By contrast, generation
  of both enantiomers of β-cedrene (12) has been directly determined for F198L EIZS
  by direct chiral GC–MS comparison with authentic standards, as described in the
  text. The formation of both (−)- and (+)-12 requires that EIZS or its mutants be
  capable of generating both the (7S)- and (7R)-homobisabolyl cations, as shown. The
  absolute configurations of the remaining aberrant sesquiterpene cyclization products
  have not been determined and are arbitrarily illustrated for (Z)-α-bisabolene (5),
  β-curcumene (6), sesquisabinene A (7), sesquiphellandrene (8), epi-β-santalene (9),
  epi-zonarene (10), (−)-α-cedrene (11), β-acoradiene (13), and helifolene (15). Formation
  of the enantiomers of any of these compounds can readily be accommodated by simple
  variations of the mechanistic scheme.
