caption: Different pathways use the RecQ helicase in response to replication stalling.
  Stalled replication forks activate Rad53p kinase in the absence of strand breaks
  in an Sgs1p-, Mrc1- and Mec1-dependent pathway that is independent of Top3p and
  Rad51p. Forks are stabilised by two mechanisms, including one that requires Rad51p
  and the Sgs1p/Top3p complex. We proposed that the Rad51p-dependent pathway leads
  to the formation of a four-way DNA junction due to fork reversal. DSBs will form
  at some of the stalled replication forks, and will activate the intra-S damage pathway
  (breakage pathway) for checkpoint activation, which relies on Rad24p and the 9-1-1
  complex.
