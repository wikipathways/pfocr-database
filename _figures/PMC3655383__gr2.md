caption: Importance of white adipose tissue (WAT)–skeletal muscle crosstalk in cancer
  associated cachexia (CAC) and/or lipotoxicity. Factors released by tumors induce
  lipolysis in WAT () and alter adipokine secretion by WAT. As outlined in , tumor
  necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), through the TNF receptor and G0S2 (G0/G1 switch gene
  2), regulates the activity of the lipases adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone
  sensitive lipase (HSL), and monoglyceride lipase (MAGL). Leptin and adiponectin
  released by WAT act through the leptin receptor (LR) or the adiponectin receptor
  (ADIPOR) present on myocytes and activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
  which, in turn, activates ATGL. Catecholamines signal through the β-adrenoceptor
  and phosphorylate HSL. Fatty acids (FAs) released by adipocytes as a result of increased
  lipolysis are transported into myocytes by FA transporters such as FATP1 and CD36.
  FAs are β-oxidized in mitochondria, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and,
  in turn, cause cell death by apoptosis often seen in lipotoxicity and cachexia.
  Both FAs and ceramides induce stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress). ER
  stress activates PERK, which phosphorylates the ribosome binding protein elF2a and
  thus downregulates protein synthesis, as is often seen in lipotoxicity and cachexia.
  FAs are also converted into diacylglycerol (DAG), which along with ceramides activate
  protein kinase C (PKC). PKC activates the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway. This downregulates
  MyoD and increases the ubiquitin ligases, MURF1 and MAFBx, thus leading to protein
  degradation through activation of the proteasome complex. PKC also phosphorylates
  JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase). Activated JNK along with PKC phosphorylates IRS-1
  at serine residue 1101, which leads to insulin resistance because of decreased PI3K/Akt
  activity. Decreased Akt and increased TNF-α signaling increases expression of MAFBx
  and MURF1 through FOXO, which also leads to increased protein degradation. Factors
  in red are upregulated in cachexia, those in green are downregulated in cachexia,
  and factors shown in black have no change or have not yet been determined in cachexia.
  Solid lines indicate pathways confirmed in CAC and dotted lines expected but unconfirmed
  ones.
