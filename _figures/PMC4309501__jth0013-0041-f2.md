caption: Simplified model of factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) activation during
  melioidosis. During infection, Burkholderia pseudomallei is recognized by innate
  immune effector cells such as neutrophils, which in turn release proinflammatory
  cytokines. When initiated, the immune cascade leads to programmed cell death, activation
  of the complement system, and activation of coagulation. The last of these can cause
  microvascular thrombosis, which can lead to extensive tissue damage and cell death.
  FSAP circulates as a single-chain inactive protease in plasma, and is activated
  upon contact with circulating histones and either late apoptotic or necrotic cells.
  Plasma-derived FSAP binds to dead cells and, when activated, results in the release
  of nucleosomes. FSAP-induced nucleosome release might be harmful to the host by
  propagating the proinflammatory response, and nucleosomes, in turn, can cause further
  tissue damage, contributing to multiorgan failure (MOF). Activated FSAP (FSAPA),
  which detaches from dead cells, will immediately be inactivated by plasma inhibitors,
  such as α2-antiplasmin (AP), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and plasminogen
  activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). FSAPI, inactivated FSAP.
