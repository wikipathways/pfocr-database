caption: BDNF signaling pathway. BDNF signaling via TrkB and p75NTR is complex. Activation
  of TrkB-FL by mature BDNF classically leads to activation of PLCγ and both the ERK
  pathway and the PI3K/Akt pathway promote cell proliferation and survival. In addition,
  TrkB may act through the NFκB pathway. In contrast to TrkB-FL, the truncated TrkB-T1
  may be both inhibitory and activating via RhoA and PKC, resulting in cytoskeletal
  remodeling, gene modulation and other effects. The low-affinity p75NTR, when activated
  by mature BDNF, typically activates the pathway including TrkB-FL, but importantly,
  it may be inhibited via either the JNK or Akt pathways. This is particularly the
  case when p75NTR is activated by pro-BDNF and forms a ternary complex with the adaptor
  protein sortilin. BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; TrkB-FL, tyrosine kinase

  description: BDNF signaling pathway. BDNF signaling via TrkB and p75NTR is complex.
    Activation of TrkB-FL by mature BDNF classically leads to activation of PLCγ and
    both the ERK pathway and the PI3K/Akt pathway promote cell proliferation and survival.
    In addition, TrkB may act through the NFκB pathway. In contrast to TrkB-FL, the
    truncated TrkB-T1 may be both inhibitory and activating via RhoA and PKC, resulting

    p75NTR, when activated by mature BDNF, typically activates the pathway including
    TrkB-FL, but importantly, it may be inhibited via either the JNK or Akt pathways.
    This is particularly the case when p75NTR is activated by pro-BDNF and forms a
    ternary complex with the adaptor protein sortilin. BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic
