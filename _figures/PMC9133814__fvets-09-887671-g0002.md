caption: 'Pathogenesis of B. melitensis infection in small ruminants. (A) B. melitensis
  infects small ruminants mainly via the alimentary tract. Once in the oral cavity,
  B. melitensis enters through the mucosa or the oro- and nasopharyngeal tonsils (Waldeyer''s
  ring) and colonizes, proliferates and persists in the lymph nodes (LNs) of the head
  (i.e., mandibular, parotid, and lateral and medial retropharyngeal LNs). Failure
  to eliminate B. melitensis on this primary line of defense results in escape of
  the bacteria through the efferent lymphatic vessels to the distal LN or via blood
  to the general circulation. In pregnant females, B. melitensis colonizes placenta
  and induces abortion or stillbirth. Brucella melitensis also has affinity for lactating
  udder. Significant numbers of B. melitensis are excreted in vaginal discharges,
  aborted fetus, placenta and milk. (B) Illustration of histological structure of
  tonsils. B. melitensis is first seen in the lumen of the oral cavity. Subsequently,
  B. melitensis colonizes the crypts and invade through reticular epithelium. (C)
  Reticular epithelium is composed of scattered M cells (M; green), lymphoid cells
  and the epithelial cell types (E). M cells endocytose B. melitensis from the lumen,
  after which transcytosis and basolateral release occurs. Immediately, the agent
  is up taken by resident antigen presenting cells, i.e., macrophages (MØ) and dendritic
  cells (DC), which in turn activate the immune response in the underlying lymphoid
  follicles. MØs and DCs traffic B. melitensis to other sites in the body or back
  through the reticular epithelium to the mucosal surface. (D) Schematic representation
  of B. melitensis intracellular trafficking in macrophages and evasion of killing.
  Following lipid rafts (LR)—and the prion protein (PrPc)—mediated internalization,
  B. melitensis is contained in an early vacuole (BCV: Brucella containing vacuole).
  This early vacuole sequentially interacts with cellular organelles (early and late
  endosomes, and lysosomes) and transiently acquires different markers (EEA1, Rab5,
  LAMP1, Rab7) in a VirB dependent-mechanism regulated by the pathogen effector proteins.
  To reach the replicative niche, BCV-LAMP1+ interacts with ER exit sites (ERES),
  and generates an ER-derived organelle permissive for B. melitensis replication (ER-Replicative
  BCV). Vacuoles containing VirB-deficient B. melitensis undergo phagolysosomal degradation.
  Spontaneous rough mutant generation might help parental pathogen release from infected
  MØ through lytic or non-lytic mechanisms, and the process repeats in other professional
  phagocytic cells. (E) Diagram of ruminant placentome with enlargement of one caruncular
  septa. Brucella invades placenta via maternal capillaries (MC). Extravasated (EV)
  maternal blood at the tip of the caruncular septa, along with B. melitensis, is
  phagocytosed by erythrophagocytic trophoblasts (ET). From these cells, B. melitensis
  spread infection to adjacent chorioallantoic trophoblasts (CAT). UL: Uterine lumen,
  EE: Endometrial epithelium, CAM: Chorioallantoic membrane. (F) Schematization of
  a complete cycle of B. melitensis-infected chorioallantoic trophoblast (CAT). 1:
  B. melitensis (B, red circles) adheres to the plasmatic membrane of CAT; 2: the
  bacteria are internalized and initial intracellular replication occurs; 3–4: Massive
  intracellular multiplication of the agent; 5: Apoptosis of CAT and release of huge
  number of B. melitensis. The cycle of endocytosis, intracellular replication and
  programmed cell death continues. CAM, Chorioallantoic membrane; AE, Allantoic ephitelium.
  (G) Schematic representation of B. melitensis intracellular trafficking in chorioallantioic
  trophoblasts. Trophoblasts invasion of B. melitensis is mediated by heat shock cognate
  protein 70 (Hsc70) and Ezrin. From this point until reaching of the replicative
  niche, intracellular trafficking is similar than that reported in macrophages (i.e.,
  BCV goes from early BCV -red- to intermediate BCV -green- and to replicative BCV).
  Intracellular presence of Brucella induces ER stress that triggers production of
  the pro-inflammatory cytokines in a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)
  1/2—dependent manner via activation of NF-kb pathway, and activates caspase pathway
  leading to chorioallantoic trophoblast apoptosis. These molecular responses of B.
  melitensis-infected trophoblasts may contribute to better understanding the pathogenesis
  of placentitis and abortion in small ruminant brucellosis.'
