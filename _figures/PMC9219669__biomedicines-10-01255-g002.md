caption: Representation of cell signaling pathways leading to apoptosis. Apoptosis
  can result from the activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways.
  The extrinsic or membrane pathway starts by the interaction of a death ligand from
  the TNF (tumor necrosis factor) family, TNF, FAS-L, TRAIL (TNF related apoptotic
  inducing ligand), and NGF (nerve growth factor) to the respective receptors, TNF-R1,
  FAS, TRAIL-R1-R2, and p75-NTR, which subsequently activate a caspase cascade (caspase
  8 and 3). In mitochondria-mediated apoptosis or intrinsic pathway, proteins of BCL-2
  family (BAX, BAK; BCL2) and cytochrome c are released, binding to the apoptotic
  protease-activating factor-1 (APAF-1) and caspase 9 (CASP 9) forms a complex called
  the apoptosome, which is capable of recruiting caspase-9, -3 (CASP3) and -7, and
  inducing apoptosis. Several apoptotic regulators are also represented, such as the
  CASP inhibitors (namely the IAPs—inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) and the IAPS inhibitors
  SMAC/DIABLO (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct inhibitor of
  apoptosis-binding protein with low pI). In neuropathic pain (NP), oxidative stress
  (OS)/ROS generated exogenously or endogenously can activate p53, which activates
  the proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins that can inhibit the functions of the antiapoptotic
  proteins, such as BAX and BAK. Besides, OS can induce nerve apoptosis by activating
  BAX through protein kinase A (PKA) and p38 pathway. Transmembrane death receptors
  such as FAS, TRAIL-R1/2, and TNF-R1 can also be activated by ROS.
