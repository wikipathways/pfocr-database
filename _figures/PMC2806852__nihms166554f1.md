caption: Hypothesized regulation of the different routes of Ca2+ influx and/or release
  from stores by NTs, and its effects on intracellular Ca2+ levels. (A) CA1 pyramidal
  neuron at rest (left). Intracellular calcium concentration is represented following
  the standard convention utilized to display data from imaging experiments using
  Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes (blue to red, low to high Ca2+ levels, respectively).
  The diagram to the right is an expanded view of an excitatory synapse on a dendritic
  spine framed by a box in the apical dendrite at left. (B) Pre-synaptic release of
  excitatory neurotransmitter from afferent fibers depolarizes the post-synaptic membrane,
  eliciting Ca2+ elevations by influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and
  NMDA receptors. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors also contributes
  to Ca2+ rises by release from IP3-sensitive intracellular stores. Ca2+-induced Ca2+
  release from ryanodine stores further amplifies dendritic Ca2+ elevations. (C) Our
  model proposes that, in addition to evoke Ca2+ changes by itself, BDNF enhances
  dendritic Ca2+ elevations through other routes evoked by synaptic activity. BDNF
  binding induces autophosphorylation of TrkB receptors, and subsequent activation
  of the PLC-γ/IP3signaling pathway, leading to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores.
  Activated TrkB receptors also trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of voltage-dependent
  Ca2+ channels and NMDA receptors, enhancing Ca2+ influx into spines and dendrites.
