  The biosynthetic pathways of the amino acids with different color backgrounds were
  reinforced by gene overexpression, leading to different performance of glucoamylase
  production. The metabolic enzymes (EC numbers) and the encoding genes overexpressed
  in this study are shown in red. Amino acids in different color backgrounds represent
  the different glucoamylase production performance of the corresponding overexpression
  mutants (Table ) in shake flasks (Red background means the reinforcement of synthetic
  pathway of this amino acid increased the glucoamylase production in the corresponding
  mutant compared to CBS 513.88; blue background means glucoamylase production decreased
  in the corresponding mutant; orange background means the corresponding mutants perform
  similar glucoamylase production with CBS 513.88). 3PG 3-phosphoglycerate, PEP phosphoenolpyruvate.
