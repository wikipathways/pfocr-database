caption: Scheme of molecular mechanisms that obesity can influence during carcinogenesis
  of the mammary gland. The abnormal increase of leptin levels in obesity is an event
  which can positively regulate transcription of genes associated with tumor growth
  and proliferation such as Cadh-1 and CP450Arom, respectively. Solid lines indicate
  a mechanism or pathway established experimentally. Dashed lines indicate a mechanism
  or pathway not determined yet. Arrowheads indicate upregulation and flattened heads
  indicate downregulation
