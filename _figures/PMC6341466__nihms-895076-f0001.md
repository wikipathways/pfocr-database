caption: GPI anchor pathway and phenotypic findings of GPI anchor disorders.(a) The
  11 steps of mammalian GPI anchor biosynthesis and protein attachment. The genes
  associated with each step are labeled. Underlined genes have been associated with
  congenital human disease. Note PIGT in step 10.(b) Summary of the clinical features
  described in cases of congenital GPI anchor biosynthesis disorders. The most common
  features are highlighted in blue. * Note that somatic mutations in PIGA and PIGT
  in hematopoietic stem cells can cause paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria manifesting
  with hemolytic anemia, bone marrow failure, thrombosis, and smooth muscle dystonia.
  This is distinct from the clinical entity caused by germline mutations in these
  two genes. Additionally, acquired mutations in the GPI transamidase complex subunits
  have been implicated in human cancers.
