caption: BMPs stimulate adipogenesis at multiple stages. BMPs are secretory proteins
  and expressed by both adipocyte and stromal vascular cells with higher levels in
  adipocytes. BMP4 stimulates angiogenesis, which serves as stem cells niches for
  adipogenesis; BMP2,4,7 all play roles in commitment of multipotent stem cells to
  preadipocytes; BMP2 and BMP4 activate Lox mainly through Smad signaling during commitment;
  BMP4 and BMP7 also acquires adipocyte with beige activity during terminal differentiation
  through P38/MAPK pathway. BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; PDGFRβ, platelet-derived
  growth factor receptor beta.
