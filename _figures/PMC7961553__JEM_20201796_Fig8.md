caption: Model for AIM2 function in microglia as a negative regulator of EAE. The
  damaged double-stranded DNA released by dying nerve cells activates both cGAS and
  DNA-PK pathway in microglia. On one hand, cGAS senses double-stranded DNA to activate
  its downstream signaling effector STING via the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine
  monophosphate. Upon activation, STING recruits TBK1, which phosphorylates IRF3 at
  Ser386. At the same time, dsDNA activates DNA-PK to phosphorylate AKT3, which enhances
  IRF3 Ser385 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser385 facilitates STING-TBK1
  to induce IRF3 Ser386 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of Ser386 and Ser385
  is required for IRF3 dimerization, which promotes IRF3 Ser396 phosphorylation and
  translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of genes encoding antiviral
  inflammatory cytokines. In this process, AIM2 can interact with DNA-PK and blocks
  the binding of DNA-PK with AKT3, which suppresses AKT3 activation and downstream
  IRF3 Ser385 phosphorylation. Such effect inhibits cGAS and DNA-PK comediated-IRF3
  activation and transcription of inflammatory cytokines. Thus, AIM2 in microglial
  cells negatively regulates the DNA-PK–AKT3 axis to inhibit neuroinflammation synergistically
  induced by cGAS and DNA-PK, thereby protecting against the onset of EAE.

  description: Model for AIM2 function in microglia as a negative regulator of EAE.
    The damaged double-stranded DNA released by dying nerve cells activates both cGAS
    and DNA-PK pathway in microglia. On one hand, cGAS senses double-stranded DNA
    to activate its downstream signaling effector STING via the production of cyclic
    guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate. Upon activation, STING recruits
    TBK1, which phosphorylates IRF3 at Ser386. At the same time, dsDNA activates DNA-PK
    to phosphorylate AKT3, which enhances IRF3 Ser385 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation
    of IRF3 at Ser385 facilitates STING-TBK1 to induce IRF3 Ser386 phosphorylation.
    The phosphorylation of Ser386 and Ser385 is required for IRF3 dimerization, which
    promotes IRF3 Ser396 phosphorylation and translocates to the nucleus to activate
    transcription of genes encoding antiviral inflammatory cytokines. In this process,
    AIM2 can interact with DNA-PK and blocks the binding of DNA-PK with AKT3, which
    suppresses AKT3 activation and downstream IRF3 Ser385 phosphorylation. Such effect
    inhibits cGAS and DNA-PK comediated-IRF3 activation and transcription of inflammatory
    cytokines. Thus, AIM2 in microglial cells negatively regulates the DNA-PK–AKT3
    axis to inhibit neuroinflammation synergistically induced by cGAS and DNA-PK,
    thereby protecting against the onset of EAE.
