caption: 'Different molecular mechanisms that can induce time-delay necessary for
  the generation of oscillations in transcription factor activity. A) Inclusion of
  multiple intermediate steps that take a minimum amount of time, such as transcription,
  translation, transportation; B) Inclusion of a threshold concentration, in the form
  of a feedback loop that generates an on/off-like response, necessary for a molecule
  to become biologically active; C) Inclusion of degradation/sequestration steps that
  prevent functionality. Examples are: inclusion of a saturated degradation step or
  inclusion of a complex sequestration step; D) The NFkB pathway is regulated by the
  sequestration of NFkB by IkB, rendering NFkB inaccessible. Only upon phosphorylation
  of IkB by IKK, IkB is degraded and NFkB becomes functionally active; E) Oscillatory
  behavior is generated by the P53-induced transcription of Mdm2, which in turn binds
  to P53 and results in accelerated degradation of P53; F) Axin2 governs at least
  a part of the oscillatory behavior of the Wnt pathway. Axin2 transcription is under
  control of B-catenin, and upon translation Axin2 can either bind B-catenin, inducing
  degradation, or bind the LRP receptor complex inducing degradation of Axin2 itself;
  G) A negative feedback loop controls oscillations in the Notch signaling pathway.
  Upon stimulation of the Notch receptors they are cleaved and their intracellular
  domain, NICD, is translocated to the nucleus where it promotes the expression of
  Hes1. Hes1 in its turn inhibits its own promotor, thereby creating a negative feedback
  loop; H) Glucocorticoid signaling is a prime example of several time-delay steps
  inducing oscillations. First, glucocorticoids are synthesized de novo upon stimulation
  by ACTH. Upon release, glucocorticoids bind to and activate the GR, the activated
  glucocorticoid receptor is translocated to the nucleus where it induces the transcription
  of several GR-responsive protein coding genes, as well as several microRNAs. Some
  of these microRNAs form negative feedback loops with the GR, locally inhibiting
  GR expression. Furthermore, the activated GR is engaged in a classic negative feedback
  loop to the brain, where it inhibits the production of ACTH and other upstream mediators
  of the HPA axis.'
