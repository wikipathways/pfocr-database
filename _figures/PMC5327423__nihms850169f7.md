caption: The earliest TRIR data show the protein modes (reported in -) are a result
  of instantaneous perturbation (< 100 fs), consistent with changes in H-bond strength
  rather than protein conformation. The singlet state in that perturbed environment
  (1FMN*†) relaxes to a triplet, (3FMN†), which in C450V can only relax back to the
  ground state. In AsLOV2 the pathway to A390 is dispersive (indicated by the mixed
  character of the 3FMN/A390 recovered in the EAS). On a longer time scale A390 relaxes
  directly back to the ground state in Q513A, while wild type AsLOV2 undergoes further
  structural evolution on the hundreds of μs timescale leading to signalling state
  (SIG) formation.
