caption: (A) Expression of IGF1R, ITGB3, and TIMP1 are in equilibrium in the presence
  of normal level of PRKCZ. (B) These same cells, when stimulated with IGF1, can decrease
  the expression of TIMP1. (C) Over-expression of PRKCZ increases either translation
  or stability of IGF1R, possibly leading to constitutive activation of IGF1 signalling
  cascade that results in transcriptional repression of ITGB3 and increase cell survival
  through proliferation. (D) Repression of ITGB3 in PRKCZ-expressing cells is dependent
  on IGF1R expression as IGF1R knockdown by siRNA derepresses its expression. (E)
  IGF1 stimulation activates negative feedback mechanism, leading to a decrease in
  IGF1R transcription; ITGB3 expression is derepressed. (F) In addition to IGF1R transcription
  suppressor, other signalling pathway downstream of IGF1 cascade, such as PI3K/AKT,
  may be activated to derepress the expression of ITGB3.
