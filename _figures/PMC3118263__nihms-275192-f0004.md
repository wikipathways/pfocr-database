caption: Pathway analysis links the differentially expressed gene signatures of the
  MED29 transduced Hs 700T and MIAPaCa-2 cells to a cellular network involved in cell
  cycle, cancer, and genetic disorder. This network is characterized by involvement
  of several cyclins and other cell cycle related proteins, most of which are downregulated
  through MED29 expression. Green color indicates downregulation and red color upregulation.
  Lines and arrows indicate connection and dashed lines a weaker connection.
