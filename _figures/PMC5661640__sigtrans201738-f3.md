caption: Schematic presentation of suggested pathways of PTEN involvement in neuronal
  survival. PTEN regulates the conversion of Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate
  into Phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bis phosphate (PIP2). PTEN activation leads to cell
  spreading and growth by inhibition or dephosphorylation of FAK1 (protein tyrosine
  kinase 2) and SHC transforming protein 1 in cytoplasm and by inhibiting cyclin D1
  in the nucleus. PTEN depletion activate Akt signaling pathway which in turn regulate
  all downstream cellular effects such as cell growth, proliferation and cell survival.
  PTEN depletion is sufficient to trigger mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that
  alters downstream signaling pathways for local protein synthesis by increasing P70s6
  kinase activity. This pathway also influences many apoptosis factors either by transcriptional
  regulation or by direct phosphorylation.
