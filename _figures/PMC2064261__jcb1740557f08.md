caption: Model showing how altered cytoarchitecture and diminished scaffolding function
  of keratin networks could lead to up-regulation of the Erk1/2 pathway in plectin-deficient
  keratinocytes. The scheme depicts plectin as a cytoskeletal sequestering platform
  for RACK1 (WT). Absence of its scaffolding partner (KO) leads to accumulation of
  RACK1 (and possibly other plectin-binding regulatory proteins, e.g., the nonreceptor
  protein kinase Fer) at the cell periphery. As a consequence (direct or indirect),
  membrane-associated PKCδ and c-Src activities become activated, leading to higher
  activation of Erk1/2 and cell migration.
