caption: MyD88 played a critical role in alveolar macrophage-mediated inflammatory
  response to CNTs. MyD88 mediated CNTs toxicity by linking IL-1R or TLR-dependent
  signaling and acted on downstream IRAKs and TRAFs, thus inducing proinflammatory
  NF-κB pathway. Also, MAPKs was involved in toxic response and MAPK inhibitors for
  p38 and JNK reduced levels of TNF-α and IL-1β. MyD88-specific inhibitory peptide
  blocked the production of TNF-α and IL-1β
