caption: Average rate constants and flux distribution of apo B lipoproteins in response
  to the diet high in complex carbohydrate (CHO diet; A) and in response to the diet
  high in monounsaturated fat (MUFA diet; B) in 12 subjects. Ovals represent apo B
  lipoprotein fractions separated by apo C-III and apo E contents and by density;
  the numbers inside the ovals indicate the plasma pool sizes (mg). The dotted lines
  represent the direct secretion into plasma of each lipoprotein type, and the numbers
  next to the dotted lines indicate the percentages of total apo B secretion into
  each fraction. The solid arrows connecting the 2 plasma lipoprotein compartments
  represent the lipolytic conversion from the originating compartment to the receiving
  compartment. Arrows exiting a compartment without going into another compartment
  represent direct removal pathways. Numbers next to these conversion or removal pathways
  indicate the average rate constant (pools/d) of each pathway, and percentages inside
  parentheses indicate the mean relative proportion of apo B flux rates out of each
  originating compartment (n = 12). *Significant difference between the CHO and the
  MUFA diets, P < 0.05 (paired t test).
