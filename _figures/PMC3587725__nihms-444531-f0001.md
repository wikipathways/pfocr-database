  NF-κB binding and induces VDR and CYP27B1 expression, the enzyme that catalyzes

  (VDR) is increased. In the presence of locally high levels of 1,25(OH)2D, ligand-bound

  the NF-κB transcription factor that binds to the promoter proximal NF-κB binding
  site in the DEFB4 gene and induces HBD-2 expression together with the VDR:RXR heterodimer
  that binds to the VDRE in the promoter of DEFB4 gene. Indirect induction: In the
  presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, the VDR:RXR heterodimer binds to the VDRE in the NOD2 gene
  promoter and induces the expression of the NOD2 protein. Activation of NOD2 by its
  agonist muramyl dipeptide stimulates the NF-κB transcription factor that binds to
  the promoter proximal NF-κB binding site in the DEFB4 gene to induce its expression.
