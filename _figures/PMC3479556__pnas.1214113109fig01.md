caption: Control of SREBP-1c transcription, cleavage, and stability via the AKT-mTORC1
  signaling pathway. (A) During fasting or in the absence of growth factors, SREBP-1c
  transcription and cleavage are depressed and nuclear SREBP-1c (nSREBP-1c) is destabilized
  and degraded. (B) SREBP-1c abundance, stability, and processing are increased on
  stimulation of the AKT-mTORC1 signaling pathway, leading to an increase in the transcription
  of lipogenic genes. 4EBP, 4E binding protein 1; P, phosphorylated; SCF, Skp, cullin,
  F-box containing complex; Ub, ubiquitin.
