caption: Signalling pathways that regulate cell wall remodelling of Candida albicans.
  The HOG1, CEK1 and PKC MAP kinase cascades and the Ca2+–calcineurin signalling pathway
  control a number of cellular processes including cell wall synthesis and maintenance.
  Upstream of the MAP kinase cascades are membrane sensors (Wsc family, Mid2, Mtl1,
  Sho1 and Sln1) that detect alterations in the wall and convey the signal to the
  internal components of the pathway. The PKC pathway plays a critical role in the
  response to echinocandins and the first component that is activated is Rho1, which
  also acts as a regulatory sub-unit of β-(1,3)-glucan synthase. Rho1 activates Protein
  kinase C, which phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinase kinase kinase Bck1,
  which in turn activates the MAP kinase kinase Mkk2, which then phosphorylates Mkc1.
  A number of transcription factors contribute to the response to echinocandins including
  Cas5 and Sko1. The Rlm1 and Bcr1 transcription factors also control the expression
  of a number of cell wall related genes. In S. cerevisiae Pkc1 is involved in targeting
  Chs3 to the plasma membrane in response to heat shock. Significant re-wiring of
  signalling pathways is evident in C. albicans, compared to the S. cerevisiae paradigm,
  for example, the role of the CaSko1 transcription factor in response to caspofungin
  is independent of Hog1 MAP kinase but involves the Psk1 PAK kinase. The calcineurin
  pathway is activated by calcium that may enter cells through membrane-localised
  channels Cch1 and Mid1 or a third minor channel Fig. 1, alternatively calcium may
  be released from intracellular stores. Ca2+ binds to and activates calmodulin (Cmd1)
  that in turn activates the phosphatase calcineurin, which is made up of two sub-units
  Cna1 and Cnb1. Calcineurin dephosphorylates the transcription factor Crz1, which
  moves into the nucleus and induces expression of genes through binding to CDREs
  (calcium dependent response elements) within their promoter sequences. FK506 binding
  to Fpr1 or cylosporin A binding to cycophilin Cpr1 results in calcineurin inhibition.
