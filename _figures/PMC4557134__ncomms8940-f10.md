caption: Hepatic AA signalling regulates systemic lipid metabolism via a neuronal
  pathway. This neuronal relay from the liver to adipose tissue is mediated by the
  hepatic mTORC1/S6K pathway. This neuronal inter-tissue (liver to adipose) system
  decreases adipose LPL expression and suppresses plasma TG-hydrolysis activity, thereby
  raising serum TG levels. Namely, this neuronal mechanism produces inter-nutrient
  (AA to lipid) coordination. Furthermore, excessive activation of this pathway, under
  conditions of sustained over-nutrition during obesity development, contributes to
  obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia.
