caption: Acylcarnitine difference between Septic-S and Septic-NS increases with decreasing
  fatty acid chain length. Acylcarnitines show an increasing concentration difference
  between Septic-S and Septic-NS with decreasing chain length when mapped to their
  corresponding acyl-CoA in the KEGG pathway map of mitochondrial beta-oxidation (map00071).
  Left halves correspond to Septic-NS, right halves to Septic-S. Concentrations were
  z-scored, tanh-transformed to map into the [−1, +1]-interval and averaged by mean
  for both patient groups.
