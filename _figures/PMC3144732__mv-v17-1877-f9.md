caption: 'Cell signaling underlying the regulation of actomyosin contraction. A: MLC
  phosphorylation: MLC kinase (MLCK) drives phosphorylation and MLC phosphatase (MLCP)
  induces dephosphorylation. MLCP is a trimeric complex consisting of a phosphatase
  (PP1cδ), a myosin-binding subunit (MYPT1), and a subunit of unknown function (M20).
  MLCP activity is regulated by kinases like ROCK and integrin-linked kinase (ILK)
  through phosphorylation of MYPT1 at specific sites. This inactivates the catalytic
  subunit, thus preventing MLC dephosphorylation. B: Autoinhibition of MLCP: The substrate
  site of PP1cδ is accessible when neither Thr696 nor Thr853 is phosphorylated. However,
  when MYPT1 is phosphorylated at Thr696 or Thr853, the phosphorylated residues interact
  with the active site of PP1cδ and suppress the phosphatase activity. While both
  ROCK and ILK are known to phosphorylate Thr696, phosphorylation at Thr853 seems
  to be regulated exclusively by ROCK.'
