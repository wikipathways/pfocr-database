caption: Gasdermin-related functions in infectious and non-infectious diseases and
  cancer. Infectious diseases. During infections, GSDM-mediated pyroptosis is, in
  general, beneficial for the host because it leads to successful pathogens eradication
  by mediating innate immune cell recruitment, NET- and MET-osis. However, under some
  circumstances, detrimental pyroptosis occurs which causes unwarranted and permanent
  tissue damage. Non-infectious diseases. GSDMA and GSDMB polymorphisms are associated
  with asthma susceptibility, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and increased risk of
  multiple sclerosis. GSDMD and GSDME mediate pyroptosis and cytokine release associated
  with many immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as Cryopyrin-associated periodic
  syndrome (CAPS), Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), rheumatoid arthritis, and type
  1 diabetes. PJVK-deficiency triggers excessive generation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), which cause hearing impairment due to cell death of auditory cells and sensory
  neurons. Cancer. GSDMA reduces the growth of gastric cancer cells by promoting apoptosis.
  On the other hand, GSDMB overexpression has been linked to metastatic and invasive
  properties of breast cancer cells. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells (i.e., M1 macrophages,
  CD8+ T cells, and NK cells) promote cell death of cancer cells via a mechanism mediated
  by the granzyme-GSDMB/D/E pathway.
