caption: In the presence of xylan, transient complexes are formed including a large
  protein complex that was observed in Ste7-GFP pull-down assay. The large complex
  consists of the NikA, Ste7, SteC, SteD, MsgA, MpkB, SskA, SskB, FphA, MpkA, GskA,
  PbsA and SakA proteins, resulting in SakA phosphorylation and HOG (high osmolarity
  glycerol) pathway activation. Phosphorylated SakA is mainly nuclear. SakA phosphorylation
  may occur i) either through the phytochrome photoreceptor FphA which activates the
  SskA-SskB-PbsA signaling cascade and/or ii) through the histidine-specific protein
  kinase NikA which relays a signal to SteC-SteD, resulting in PbsA-mediated activation
  of SakA. In addition, this complex regulates and increases PKA activity which in
  turn controls cellular localization of the CreA repressor complex. In the presence
  of xylan, the CreA-repressor complex has low levels and it is mainly cytoplasmic
  with a small percentage also observed in the nucleus. CreA-repressor complex localization
  is therefore regulated by the HOG and PKA pathways as well as additional, unknown
  signals in CC-de-repressing conditions which cause its nuclear exclusion and degradation
  (a). Upon the addition of glucose, the MAPK dissociates into smaller protein complexes,
  likely resulting in SakA de-phosphorylation and HOG pathway inactivation. Complex
  dissociation may be caused by i) either Ste7 de-phosphorylation by the phosphatase
  MsgA and/or ii) phosphorylation of PbsA by the glycogen kinase synthase GskA, resulting
  in a weakening of PbsA-SakA interaction. Inactivation of PbsA and subsequent decrease
  in SakA phosphorylation results in decreased PKA activity and constitutes a signal
  for CreA repressor-complex translocation to the nucleus and repression of target
  genes such as those encoding xylanases (b). Protein names are indicated in each
  shape; xylan is represented by polymers in purple and red and glucose by blue hexagons;
  P in orange squares represent phosphorylation events; arrows show the direction
  of phosphorylation with solid arrows representing direct phosphorylation and dashed
  arrows representing indirect phosphorylation and/or regulation. Membrane lipid bilayer
  and cytoplasm are depicted in light brown and nuclei are shown in light blue.
