caption: Summary of the glucose-TOR-PD signaling network in plants. A forward genetic
  screen uncovered two mutants, ise3 and ise4/reptin-1, that decrease TOR activity
  and increase PD transport. As a component of R2TP, Reptin promotes assembly of the
  active TORC1 dimer (). spaghetti, another R2TP mutant, also decreases TOR activity
  and increases PD transport (). OXPHOS promotes TOR activity and is disrupted by
  loss of ISE3 () or inhibition of the glucose-glycolysis-OXPHOS-TOR signaling axis
  (). Direct assays reported here demonstrate that TOR restricts PD transport (),
  and TOR activity correlates with decreased PD transport during leaf maturation ().
  Chemical, genetic, and physiological treatments that impact each step in this pathway
  are indicated; each of these conditions affects PD transport, as described in the
  text.
