caption: (A) XBP-1s cell-non-autonomous stress signalling in C. elegans. The HSR,
  the UPRER and the UPRmito are regulated by the nervous system. The AFD neuron-directed
  cell-non-autonomous HSR in C. elegans requires activation of a signalling pathway
  that depends on the neuronally expressed guanylate cyclase 8 (gcy-8). Transcellular
  chaperone signalling can also occur independent of neuronal control when activated
  in non-neuronal tissues, such as muscle or gut []. (B) Cell-non-autonomous stress
  signalling in mammals. Expression of transcriptionally active XBP-1s in the POMC
  neurons of mice triggers cell-non-autonomous XBP-1 splicing and activation of the
  UPR in hepatocytes (liver), resulting in improved glucose utilization and insulin
  sensitivity. Rats subjected to restraint stress produce stress hormones along the
  hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis (such as adrenocorticotropin) which activates
  HSF1 in the adrenal gland of the kidney and hence up-regulates the expression of
  HSP70.
