caption: 'Combinatorial assembly of the zeaxanthin biosynthetic pathway using the
  GS system. (A) Scheme of the heterologous zeaxanthin biosynthetic pathway in E.
  coli from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and pyruvate using enzymes from P. agglomerans:
  FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; IPP, isopentyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate;
  crtE, geranygeranyl synthase; crtB, phytoene synthase; crtI, phytoene desaturase;
  crtY, lycopene cyclase; crtZ, b-carotene hydroxylase. (B) Scheme of the assembly
  of level 0 parts and level 1 TUs for zeaxanthin production with multiple level 0
  Anderson promoter parts (http://parts.igem.org/Promoters/Catalog/Anderson) into
  a polycistronic level 2 genetic device using Golden Standard assembly. (C) LB petri
  dish plate image showing colonies of E. coli cells transformed with the mix of level
  2 parts for zeaxanthin production. Yellow colonies are positive colonies producing
  zeaxanthin, while the blue colonies are negative colonies carrying the empty vector.
  (D) Restreaking of different intensity yellow colonies selected by eyesight for
  subsequent analysis of the promoters used (1 to 5), 0, negative control colony.
  (E). Heat map showing the combination of Anderson''s promoters for each CDS part
  in the five selected colonies.'
