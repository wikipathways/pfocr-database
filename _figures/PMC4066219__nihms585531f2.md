caption: IL-15 impacts distinct cell types to mediate its pathogenic effects. (i)
  In the lamina propria, IL-15 endows mucosal dendritic cells with inflammatory properties
  in a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent manner, and subsequently with the ability
  to prevent the differentiation of regulatory T cells and to promote inflammatory
  Th1 cell responses leading to the loss of oral tolerance. (ii) IL-15 renders effector
  T cells resistant to the suppressive functions of regulatory T cells through a mechanism
  involving JNK and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K). (iii) IL-15 impacts on intraepithelial
  lymphocytes by inducing the expression of NKG2D. The synergy between IL-15 and NKG2D
  cytolytic signaling pathway promotes the binding of the NKG2D-DAP10 complex to distinct
  adaptor proteins including PI3K whose activation promotes the phosphorylation of
  the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK), and JNK. This leads to cPLA2 activation, which in turn critically regulates
  NKG2D-mediated degranulation and cytolysis, and induces the release of arachidonic
  acid, a precursor of the pro-inflammatory compounds called leukotrienes. (iv) In
  patients with refractory sprue, IL-15 leads to the expansion and survival of an
  abnormal subset of CD3− intraepithelial lymphocytes by activating an anti-apoptotic
  cascade involving the phosphorylation of Jak3 and STAT5.
