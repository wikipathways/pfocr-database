caption: Proposed mechanism for P. cocos on MAFLD. Poria cocos activation of hepatic
  FXR, which can activate PPARα, inhibit SREBP-1c, reduces lipid deposits. Activation
  of hepatic FXR, which can activate SHP, inhibit SREBP-1c, reduce TC, TG, NEFA levels
  and inhibit lipid synthesis. Activation of hepatic FXR, which can activate SHP,
  reduce CYP7A1 expression and inhibit BA synthesis and lipid absorption; In addition,
  decreased free bile acids and increased bound bile acids in the intestine can inhibit
  FXR expression, promote FGF15/19 expression, and reduced bile acid absorption by
  binding to FGFR4 and inhibiting CYP7A1 expression. FGF15/19, fibroblast growth factor
  FGF15/19. FGFR4, fibroblast growth factor receptor 4.
