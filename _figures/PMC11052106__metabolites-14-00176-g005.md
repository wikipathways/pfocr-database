caption: Metabolic pathway plot of the differentially abundant metabolites among the
  three yields in Bozhou. Red, yellow, and green indicate the relative concentrations
  of metabolites at low yield, intermediate yield, and high yield, respectively. △,
  *, and □ represent p values of metabolites using nonparametric tests that were less
  than 0.05 for the low-yield vs. high-yield, low-yield vs. middle-yield, and middle-yield
  vs. high-yield comparisons, respectively
