caption: 'Scheme of signaling pathways triggered by biotic- and abiotic-tested LRR-RLKs
  and crosstalk among them. The LRR-RLKs regulate various plant processes, including
  growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. After perceiving
  abiotic and/or biotic stimuli by the LRR-RLKs, activation of diverse signaling,
  such as MAPK activation (BAK1, PEPR1/2, SERK4), Ca2+ influx (BAK1), reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production (RPK1, BAK1, RLK7, SOBIR1), BR signaling (BRI1, SERK2,
  SERK4), ABA signaling (KIN7, PXL2, RPK1, BRI1, SERK2, BAK1), jasmonate (JA), and
  salicylate (SA) (PEPR1/2, LRR1, PSKR1) occurs. Some LRR-RLKs may activate several
  signaling pathways depending on the type of stimuli: RPK1-ABA and ROS pathways;
  BRI and SERK2—ABA and BR pathway; PEPR1/2—MAPK and JA/SA pathway, SERK4—BR and MAPK
  pathway, BAK1-BR signaling, Ca2+ and MAPK pathways. Senescence may be associated
  with SARK and BIR1. Defense mechanisms against biotic stress stimuli are mediated
  by JA, SA, ROS, and MAPK pathways, and also additionally followed by LRR-RLKs: NIK1,
  EFR, RLP23, RLK902, NIK3, and FSL2. Yellow color indicates tested abiotic stimuli,
  blue color is for tested biotic stimuli, and green for both stimuli.'
