caption: 'Molecular pathways linking endoplasmic reticulum stress and subcellular
  Ca2+ movements to efferocytosis in atherosclerosis: Effects of upregulation of sarcoplasmic
  reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  receptor (IP3R), ORAI, transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC), oxidized low
  density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL), and [Ca2+]i on the calcineurin-mediated and calmodulin
  kinase II (CaMKII)-mediated cellular pathways associated enhanced or diminished
  efferocytosis. (a) The Orai1-activated increase of [Ca2+]i stimulates calcineurin,
  which results in triggering of two signaling pathways including calcineurin–apoptosis
  signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-p38/JNK and calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT) []. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK), and p38 MAP have critical roles in the modulation of class A scavenger receptors
  (SR-A) expression []. The NFAT transcription factors act as negative modulators
  of SR-A expression []. A signaling pathway, which positively modulates the SR-A
  expression and stimulates foam cell formation in vitro, is calcineurin–ASK1-p38/JNK
  signaling pathway, while the calcineurin–NFAT pathway is a negative regulator of
  SR-A expression []. Activation of ASK1 via a negative feedback mechanism restricts
  the inhibitory influence of NFAT on the expression of SR-A []. (b) The released
  Ca2+ triggers CaMKII, which leads to activation of apoptotic pathways. Especially,
  CaMKII has many roles including the signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1 (STAT1) activation, triggering the proapoptotic signal transducer and stimulation
  of the FAS death receptor by JNK [,]. ER stress leads to an increase in [Ca2+]Cyt,
  which in turn prompts FAS death receptor expression via the CaMKIIγ and JNK pathways
  in vivo []. CaMKII knockdown enhances macrophage efferocytosis receptor tyrosine-protein
  kinase MER (MerTK) expression, which in turn increases efferocytosis, and, in atherosclerotic
  lesions, should ultimately result in smaller necrotic cores. The increase of ATF6
  leads to an enhanced efferocytosis through the expression of MerTK and in the absence
  of CaMKIIγ in macrophages []. Cleavage of ATF6 leads to an increase of C/EBPα-homolog
  protein (CHOP). Increase in the CHOP promotes cytosolic Ca2+ in the macrophages
  via CHOP-mediated stimulation of oxidase ERO1α in the ER, which in turn triggers
  Ca2+ release from the IP3R channel in the membranes of ER and also in an increased
  expression of the death receptor-5 (DR5) and in decreased expression of the death
  receptor-5 (Bcl-2), a mediator of cell survival [,]. These alterations result in
  increased cellular apoptosis and in reduced efferocytosis, a combination which is
  particularly pro-atherogenic.'
