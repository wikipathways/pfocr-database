caption: A. UVB induces DNA damage, causing the release of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)
  by keratinocytes and melanocytes. POMC is cleaved to αMSH, the endogenous agonist
  for the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) in melanocytes. Activation of MC1R signals
  via Gαs to increase intracellular cAMP levels through activation of adenylyl cyclase
  (AC). cAMP renders protein kinase A (PKA) catalytically active, phosphorylating
  cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) which upregulates microphthalmia-associated
  transcription factor (MITF). The subsequent MITF-driven increase in expression of
  melanogenic enzymes like tyrosinase (TYR) leads to an increase in melanin within
  melanosomes (brown circles) and melanin transfer to keratinocytes, which occurs
  in 12–24 h after UVB exposure.B. UVA, detected by an as yet unidentified melanocyte
  photoreceptor, leads to retinal-dependent activation of Gαq/11, which stimulate
  phospholipase C-β (PLCβ) to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). IP3 binds its cognate receptor
  IP3R, increasing Ca2+ flux from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pathway also
  activates transient receptor potential cation channel A1 (TRPA1), leading to Ca2+
  influx and a further increase in intracellular Ca2+. Ca2+ from both sources is required
  for the increase melanin synthesis that can be detected 1 h after exposure (; ;
  ).
