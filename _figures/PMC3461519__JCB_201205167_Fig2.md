caption: B-RAF kinase inhibition by Zelboraf, and molecular mechanisms underlying
  resistance to Zelboraf treatment. (A) Raf kinases function as a critical node of
  a signal transduction pathway initiated at the cell membrane by RTK stimulation,
  leading to activation of the MAPK pathway. The constitutively stimulated kinase
  activity of B-RAF V600E oncogenic mutant in melanoma is blocked by Zelboraf (PLX4032)
  treatment, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. (B) Molecular mechanism of resistance
  to Zelboraf treatment in melanoma. Drug resistance was shown to be mediated by different
  mechanisms that bypass PLX4032 inhibition of oncogenic mutant B-RAF, including expression
  of activated NRAS Q61K and KRAS K177N, activation of RTKs that reactivate MAPK and
  induce PI3K/AKT stimulation, or by mutational activation of members of the MEK kinase
  family. (C) Various positive and negative signals that regulate Raf and the MAPK
  pathway. The activity of RAF kinases is regulated by homo- and herterodimerization
  of the three Raf isoforms, and by interactions with additional factors that exert
  either positive (Src, KSR, and CNK) or negative (ERK, 14-3-3) effects on the MAPK
  signaling pathway. Red and yellow bars in the Raf molecule represent the regulatory
  αc helix.
