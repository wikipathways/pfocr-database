caption: GSK 3β regulates the key signaling proteins of the Wnt pathway. In the presence
  of Wnt, β-catenin is stabilized and can induce gene transcription. Wnt binds with
  its co-receptors Frizzled and LRP5/LRP6. Axin and APC interact with phosphorylated
  GSK 3β at Tyr216, which leads to β-catenin stabilization and cytosol accumulation.
  Subsequently, β-catenin is transferred into the nucleus where it activates the transcription
  of related genes by forming a complex with transcription factors as TCF/LEF. Then,
  TCF/LEF upregulates the proto-oncogenes (c-Myc and cyclin D1) and cell invasion/migration-related
  genes (MMP-7 and Cdc37). GSK 3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; APC, adenomatous polyposis
  coli; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphocyte enhancer factor; MMP-7, matrix metalloproteinase-7.
