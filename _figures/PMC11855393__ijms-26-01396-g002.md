caption: 'Overview of AR and associated pathways and their potential inhibitors in
  triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Inhibitors are shown in red. Androgens are
  synthesized from cholesterol by CYP17 lyase. CYP17-lyase inhibitors seviteronel
  and orteronel block the production of androgens from cholesterol. Upon entering
  the cell, androgens may be converted to DHT, a stronger AR agonist. Androgens activate
  AR, causing its release from HSP complex. AR subsequently dimerizes and translocates
  into the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of target genes. Antiandrogens
  including bicalutamide, enzalutamide, darolutamide and proxalutamide, inhibit androgen
  binding to AR. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and AR signaling pathways have significant crosstalk.
  Activation of AKT induces upregulation of AR through several mechanisms. Taselisib
  and alpelisib inhibit PI3K, therefore inhibiting AKT activation. AR also regulates
  the cell cycle. After the binding of a ligand, AR induces the translation and accumulation
  of D-type cyclins and their associated CDKs. Palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib
  inhibit the CDK4/6. Abbreviations: triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); androgen
  receptor (AR); androgen (A); dihydrotestosterone (DHT); heat shock protein (HSP);
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K); mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR); phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3); phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN)'
