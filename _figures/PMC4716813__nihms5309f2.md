caption: (A) Pathway of hyperglycemia-induction of intrarenal RAS activation and kidney
  injury in diabetes. Hyperglycemia stimulates Agt gene expression via Nrf2 expression
  and enhances ROS generation and pro-fibrotic gene expression via activation of NADPH
  oxidase and TGF-β1 signalling by Ang II, respectively, which eventually leads to
  kidney damage. (B) Antagonistic effect of exogenous Ang 1-7 on intrarenal RAS activation
  and kidney injury in diabetes. Exogenous Ang 1-7 improves ACE2 levels which effectively
  degrades Ang II and inhibits its downstream signalling. Ang 1-7 also limits Ang
  II formation by inhibiting Nrf2-stimulation of Agt gene expression and attenuating
  the ACE2/Ang 1-7/MasR axis, which eventually leads to a healthy kidney condition.
