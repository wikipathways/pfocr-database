caption: 'In CTX, mutations in the CYP27A1 gene lead to sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency,
  resulting in reduced production of chenodeoxycholic acid and upregulation of the
  rate-limiting enzyme in the bile acid synthesis pathway, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase.
  Increased levels of serum cholestanol and urinary bile alcohols are biological markers
  in CTX. HMG-CoA: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA.'
