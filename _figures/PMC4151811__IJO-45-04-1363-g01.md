caption: Differential regulation of TGF-β/Smad signaling after acute or chronic liver
  injuries. (A) After acute liver injury, loss of hepatocytes rapidly induces a wave
  of cell proliferation. TGF-β plays important roles during liver regeneration. TGF-β
  inhibits HSC growth by downregulating c-Myc expression by pSmad2C and pSmad3C pathways
  (left); TGF-β signaling in turn enhances HSC growth and collagen synthesis via the
  CDK4-dependent pSmad2L/C and pSmad3L/C pathways induced by cytokine (CK) signal
  (right). However, Smad7 induced by pSmad3L/C signal terminates the fibrogenic phospho-Smad
  signaling. This negative-feedback mechanism of the fibrogenic TGF-β/CK signal results
  in a transient collagen synthesis in the activated HSC, which may thus contribute
  to tissue repair. (B) Several conditions in chronically damaged livers favor human
  hepatocarcinogenesis, mostly resulting from recurrent cycles of cellular proliferation,
  inflammation and fibrosis. In MFB and pre-neoplastic hepatoycytes, CK activates
  JNK, which phosphorylates Smad2L and Smad3L (left). The JNK-mediated Smad3L phosphorylation
  leads to a hetero-complex of Smad3 with Smad4 in the nucleus where the complex stimulates
  MFB and pre-neoplastic hepatycyte growth by upregulation of c-Myc transcription.
  After COOH-tail phophorylation of cytoplasmic pSmad2L by TGF-β signal, pSmad2L/C
  translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the pSmad3L and Smad4 complex, which
  then stimulates plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) gene transcription
  (right). In contrast of Smad7 induction in HSC via pSmad3C pathway, pSmad3L cannot
  induce Smad7 in MFB and pre-neoplastic hepatoycyte (left). Under a low level of
  Smad7, the fibrogenic phospho-Smad signaling can constitutively promote ECM deposition
  by MFB, which may eventually develop into accelerated liver fibro-carcinogenesis.
