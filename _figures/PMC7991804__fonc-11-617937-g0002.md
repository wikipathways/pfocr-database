caption: 'An overview of mechanisms of GC resistance in ALL and pharmacological strategies
  to overcome it. (Left) GC resistance in ALL is related to different genetic aberrations
  (see references in the text), which cause () upregulation of Notch, IL7R, Flt3,
  and MEK/ERK pathways, with a consequent upregulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Glut1
  and acceleration of cellular growth and metabolism; () downregulation of the proapoptotic
  proteins (BIM) and upregulation of the antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1,
  and A1), with a consequent apoptosis inhibition; () overexpression of MDR proteins.
  A hypermethylation of BCL2L11 results in its inaccessibility to the transcriptional
  upregulation by a GR (left and upper right). The mTOR activation causes upregulation
  of glycolysis (middle right) and OXPHOS, and inhibition of autophagy. Upregulation
  of glycolysis can be opposed by the inhibition of hexokinase (HK), the first glycolytic
  enzyme. Ca2+signaling is involved in the NFAT activation via the Ca2+-dependent
  dephosphorylation by calcineurin (CN). A sustained Ca2+ signal is achieved due to
  a repression of the recycling of ORAI (main Ca2+ influx component) and Kv1.3 (mediating
  K+ efflux, which supports Ca2+ influx) proteins via the PI3K/SGK1 pathway (lower
  right). The above mechanisms can be opposed by inhibitors of FLT3, IL7R, γ secretase,
  Akt1/2, P-gp, glycolysis, PI3K/AKT, SGK, and mTOR as well as by BH-3 mimetics and
  hypomethylating agents. A possible toxicity of PI3R/AKT/mTOR inhibitors as well
  as of glycolysis/ hexokinase (HK) inhibitors 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP), 2-deoxy-D-glucose
  (2-DG), 1-(2,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1H-indazol-3 carboxylic acid) (lonidamine, LND) needs
  to be considered. Some re-purposed drugs may improve antileukemic protocols: ()
  TGC, which targets mitochondria and OXPHOS; () CBD, which targets mitochondria,
  causes the MTP-driven necrosis and inhibits P-gp; () TAM, which targets mitochondria,
  induces autophagy, inhibits P-gp and enhances the sensitivity to GCs; () anthelmintics,
  which inhibit GLUT1 and Hes1. For more details please consult the text.'
