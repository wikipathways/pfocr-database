caption: The benzoic acid biosynthetic network in plants. Solid arrows show established
  biochemical reactions, and dashed arrows depict possible steps not yet identified.
  Stacked arrows show the involvement of multiple enzymatic steps. The CoA-dependent
  β-oxidative pathway leading to BA-CoA formation is localized in peroxisomes and
  shown with a gray background. The proposed routes of the non–β-oxidative pathway
  in cytosol are also depicted. BA-CoA, benzoyl-CoA; BAlc, benzylalcohol; BAld, benzaldehyde;
  BALDH, benzaldehyde dehydrogenase; BB, benzylbenzoate; BPBT, benzoyl-CoA:benzylalcohol/2-phenylethanol
  benzoyltransferase; BSMT, benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase;
  CA, cinnamic acid; CA-CoA, cinnamoyl-CoA; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; Eug, eugenol;
  EGS, eugenol synthase; IEug, isoeugenol; IGS, isoeugenol synthase; 3H3PPA, 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionic
  acid; 3H3PP-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoyl-CoA; KAT, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase;
  MeBA, methylbenzoate; 3O3PP-CoA, 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoyl-CoA; PAAS, phenylacetaldehyde
  synthase; PEB, phenylethylbenzoate; PhAld, phenylacetaldehyde; and PhEth, 2-phenylethanol.
