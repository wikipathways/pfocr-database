caption: Schematic representation of ECM deposition-induced inflammation and fibrosis.
  A IL-1β induces LOX overexpression in PCOS ovaries through the ERK1/2-JNK-cJun pathway.
  B LOX interacts with AGEs to regulate collagen synthesis. C Altered TGF-β signaling
  contributes to a prenatal propensity to PCOS or polycystic ovary development. D
  High fibrillin-3 expression predisposes individuals to develop PCOS, and increased
  levels of fibrotic factors accompany NLRP3 overexpression. E The increased expression
  of 11β-HSD1 disrupts insulin signaling and ECM remodeling. LOX, lysyl oxidase; AGEs,
  advanced glycation end products; TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta; NLRP3,
  NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3; CTGF, connective tissue growth
  factor; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin. Image created with bioRender.com
