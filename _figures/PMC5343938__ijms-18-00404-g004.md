caption: Role of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway in antitumor
  immunity. Dying tumor cell-derived DNA is delivered to dendritic cells (DCs) through
  an unknown mechanism. The DNA is recognized by cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS to produce
  cGAMP for STING activation and cytokines production, which stimulate the maturation
  of DCs and stimulate the cross-presentation of tumor associated antigens (TAA) to
  CD8+ T cells, which exhibit an antitumor immunity after proliferation and infiltration
  into tumor microenvironment.
