caption: Anti-cancer effects and cell death pathways regulated by cannabinoids and
  the classical cannabinoid receptors. The activation of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs)
  drives sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activity driving reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production and leads to activation of cyclin kinase inhibitors
  resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest [,]. Agonism of cannabinoids receptors increases
  ceramide synthesis to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress driving phosphorylation
  and activity of the transcription factor eukaryotic translation initiation factor
  2A (eIF2α), leading to upregulation of p8 and its downstream targets cyclic AMP-dependent
  transcription factor ATF-4 (ATF4), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and tribbles
  homolog 3 (TRIB3). Activation of p8 inhibits the Akt/mTORC1 axis, driving autophagy-mediated
  cell death pathway upstream of apoptosis [].
