caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the host response towards vvIBDV infection.
  These KEGG pathways were generated using DE genes from IEL-NK cells obtained from
  RNA-Seq. (a) Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. (b) Toll-like receptor
  signalling pathway. (c) Apoptosis pathway. The down-regulated DE genes are highlighted
  in blue and up-regulated DE genes are highlighted in red. Pathways were adopted
  from KEGG pathway database. The green and white coloured boxes are default colours
  generated by the software, depicting genes that were not the DE on RNA-Seq, and
  unidentified genes in the organism-specific pathway, respectively.
