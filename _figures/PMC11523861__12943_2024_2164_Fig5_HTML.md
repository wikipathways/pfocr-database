caption: Molecular Mechanisms of Tryptophan Metabolism in Digestive System Cancers
  (a) Tryptophan metabolism plays dual roles in digestive system cancers, promoting
  or suppressing tumor growth. In colorectal cancer, altered metabolism enhances tumor
  cell proliferation and survival through upregulated transporters like SLC1A5 and
  SLC7A5, increasing tryptophan uptake and metabolism. Kynurenine, via AHR signaling,
  supports cancer growth and immune evasion. b In liver cancer, gut microbiota-produced
  metabolites such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-aldehyde (IAld) inhibit
  tumor initiation and progression. c Pancreatic cancer progression is driven by the
  JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which increases IDO expression to support tumor growth
  and immune evasion. Conversely, the myeloperoxidase (MPO) pathway suppresses tumors
  by inducing oxidative stress and promoting cancer cell apoptosis. d In gastric cancer,
  kynurenine fosters cancer cell proliferation, migration, and NK cell loss, creating
  an immunosuppressive environment that facilitates tumor growth
