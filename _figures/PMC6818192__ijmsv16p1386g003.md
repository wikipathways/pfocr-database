caption: 'Cell signaling regulation of endogenous H2S in the central nervous system.
  Physiologically, H2S is an important signaling molecule and regulate L and T type
  Ca2+ channel. As a key regulator of Ca2+signaling in neuron, the concentration of
  NaHSis increased.The activation of cAMP/PKA may open the Ca2+ channel initiates
  phosphorylation which helps to open several Ca2+ channels. Besides, champ/PKA pathway,
  cell signaling is mediated by MAPK, ERK, P13K, and PKC pathways. Abbreviations:
  NaHS, sodium hydrogen sulphide; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; MAPK, mitogen
  activated protein kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; ERK, extracellular
  regulatory kinase.'
