caption: The effects of UVA and UVB radiation on skin tryptophan lead to pro-inflammatory
  pathways. Following UVB exposure (right side), Trp is converted into FICZ, which
  binds to AhR. The binding-associated conformational modification leads to the dissociation
  of c-Src from the AhR inactivating complex. This tyrosine-kinase protein phosphorylates
  EGFR, whose activation initiates the downstream Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk 1/2 signaling pathway,
  thus leading to the transcriptional activation of the COX-2 gene. Activated AhR
  translocates to the nucleus, where it promotes the transcription of CYP1 genes.
  Exposure to UVA radiation (right side) sensitizes FICZ and promotes the generation
  of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which activates EGFR in a ligand-independent feature.
  This triggers the downstream Ras-Rac-MEKs-p38 pathway, culminating in CREB (cAMP
  regulatory element binding protein) activation and translocation to the nucleus,
  where it triggers the transcriptional activation of the COX-2 gene. The figure was
