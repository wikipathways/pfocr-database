caption: 'Fat Transduction signaling in taste bud cells. In taste bud cells: (1) free
  fatty acids (FFAs) binds to cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), and CD36 interacts
  with GPR120. This triggers a signaling cascade involving α-gustducin which activates
  Ca2+, dependent phospholipase (PLC). (2) PLC cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphophate
  (PIP2; bound to the membrane) into diacylglycerol (DAG) (stays in membrane) and
  inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3) (free in cytosol). DAG can phosphorylate protein
  kinase C (PKC), which helps to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinases
  (ERK) pathway. (3) IP3 leaves the membrane and binds to IP3-gated calcium ion channels
  on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This opens the IP3 channels and releases
  Ca2+ stores from the ER into the cytosol, increasing intracellular calcium levels
  ([Ca2+]i). (4) The increased [Ca2+]i triggers several events that lead to membrane
  depolarization of the cell. (4a) TRPM5 channels (a Ca2+-gated sodium channel) open,
  allowing Na+ to come into the cell. Additionally, Delayed rectifying K+ (DRK) channels
  close, preventing potassium from leaving the cell. (4b) The calcium release from
  the ER requires that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) replenish the ER’s calcium
  stores. (4c) STIM1 activates Orai1 (calcium release-activated calcium channel) to
  enable the influx of calcium into the cytosol. Subsequent opening of calcium homeostasis
  modulator 1 (CALHM1) channels allows for additional calcium influx into the cell.
  (5) Increased [Ca2+]i and CD36-induced Fyn/Src kinase activation contribute to phosphorylation
  of the ERK1/2 pathway. This can activate cAMP signaling, which promotes transcription
  of cellular regulation factors. (6) Depolarization throughout the cell leads to
  the release of serotonin (5-HT) and ATP, which act as neurotransmitters. Serotonin
  binds to its receptors, and ATP binds to purinergic P2X2 and P2X3 receptors that
  cause neuronal excitability, further relaying fat chemosensory signals to the brain.
