caption: In its simplest form, the ATR-CHK1 pathway consists of three main steps.
  The first is the generation of ssDNA gap between the MCM2–7 helicase complex and
  the DNA polymerase. The generation of ssDNA gap can occur on either leading or lagging
  strand but most often occurs on the leading strand due to the discontinuous nature
  of lagging strand synthesis. Then, the ssDNA is recognized and bound by the heterotrimer
  RPA complex which is the substrate that facilitates the binding of the ATR-interacting
  protein, ATRIP. ATRIP binding catalyzes the recruitment of the ATR kinase to the
  site of the stalled fork. ATR binding to chromatin facilitates the activation of
  its kinase activity. Active ATR phosphorylates several substrates including RPA2,
  ATR itself and, most importantly, CHK1 kinase. Once phosphorylated by ATR, CHK1
  disperses throughout the nucleus, amplifying the signaling cascade. The four main
  objectives of this pathway are to inhibit the progression of the cell cycle, halt
  the firing of any late-firing replication origins, promote the initiation of replication
  from local dormant origins, contributing to various DNA repair pathways, while stabilizing
  and allowing for the restart of the stalled replication fork.
