caption: Biosynthetic pathway of carotenoids from γ-carotene in C. fritschii PCC 6912.
  Genes identified by orthology for enzymes which can catalyze pathway steps are shown
  together with significant changes in regulation (with –1.5 > log2 fold change >
  1.5 and p-adj < 0.05) under UV-B treatment (4h4d samples) illustrated by the purple
  bars. Numbers in squares indicate the order of elution on the HPLC corresponding
  to . For myxol 2′-methylpentoside and 2-hydroxymyxol 2′-methylpentoside the glycoside
  is represented as a fucoside.
