caption: 'The mechanism of non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. The mechanism of
  non-canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway under normal physiological condition, involves
  the non-canonical Wnt signaling. The Wnt/Ca2+ pathway is initiated by the interaction
  between Wnt5a and frizzled (Fzd), leading to increased Ca2+ mobilization through
  the activation of protein kinase G (PKG) and inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC).
  This rise in Ca2+ signaling subsequently activates two Ca2+-sensitive enzymes: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II (CamKII) and protein kinase C (PKC). CamKII can stimulate the
  TAK1-NLK pathway and modulate canonical Wnt signaling, while PKC influences the
  morphology of the F-actin cytoskeleton. Elevated Ca2+ levels can also activate the
  calcineurin/NFAT pathway, resulting in the activation of NF-κB. Additionally, the
  Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is initiated by the binding of a non-canonical
  Wnt ligand to Fzd, leading to the activation of downstream rho-associated protein
  kinase (ROCK). This activation affects the cytoskeleton by promoting actomyosin
  contractility and protrusion collapse. Furthermore, the downstream JNK/JUN pathway
  can be activated to modulate actin cytoskeleton organization'
