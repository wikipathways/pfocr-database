caption: Illustrates the inhibition of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway by disulfiram
  in renal fibrosis. TGF-β and other injury factors activate this pathway, leading
  to the phosphorylation of IκBα. This results in the release of NF-κB complex (p65
  and p50), which translocates to the nucleus to promote the expression of genes related
  to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inflammatory cytokines. Disulfiram
  inhibits this pathway by preventing the phosphorylation of IκBα (in vitro), thereby
  blocking the release of the NF-κB complex. DSF was found to be unstable within the
  p65-p50 complex, and further investigations need to be carried out
