caption: Infection mechanism and spectrum prediction(A) The virus-host interaction
  network. Nodes represent proteins, viruses, and hosts; edges represent relationships
  (i.e., PPI, infection, protein-homolog similarity, and organism-protein belonging).
  The color of a node indicates its organism. The thickness of a protein-homolog similarity
  edge indicates its level of similarity. For the full network, refer to the viral
  entry graph (), interferon signaling pathway graph (), and infection graph ().(B)
  IMSP learns a representation for each potential edge, which contains a structural
  embedding and a content embedding. The structural embedding captures the local structural
  features of an edge. The content embedding captures the attributes that reveal biological
  aspects of an edge. The representation of each edge is derived by concatenating
  its structural and content embeddings, where S stands for a structural embedding
  element and C stands for a content embedding element. A Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
  is trained to take the edge representations as input and reports negative (non-connected)
  edges whose corresponding edge representations are classified as infection or PPI.
  Note that no-interaction is also a potential class for the classification task.
  See  for calculation of the structural and content embeddings.(C) Exemplar predicted
  edges are highlighted and colored accordingly to their types. Existing edges are
  dimmed.
