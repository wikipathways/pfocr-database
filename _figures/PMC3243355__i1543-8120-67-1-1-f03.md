caption: Overview of the elaborate genetic interactions between glucose and hormone
  signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana.Glucose signaling mediated by HXK1 leads to increased
  ABA levels and induces both ABA synthesis (ABA1-3 and AAO3 gene expression) and
  ABA (ABI3-5, ABI8, ABF2-mediated) signaling to control seedling development. Other
  ABA-insensitive signaling mutants (abi1-1, abi2-1) do not exhibit the gin phenotype,
  suggesting distinct ABA signaling pathway for Glc signaling and the vegetative stress
  response. The glucose insensitive (gin) phenotype is mimicked by ethylene precursor
  treatment of wild-type plants and is also displayed in constitutive ethylene biosynthesis
  (eto1) and constitutive ethylene signaling (ctr1) mutants, whereas the ethylene-insensitive
  mutants etr1-1, ein2, ein3 as well as mkk9 exhibit glucose hypersensitivity (glo
  phenotypes). Glucose and ethylene signaling converge on the regulation of the ETHYLENE
  INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) TF to differentially modulate its protein stability. The bifurcate
  and antagonistic CTR1 and MKK9 pathways are both critical in determining ethylene-signaling
  specificity through two MAPK phosphorylation sites with opposite effects on EIN3
  stability. In addition, HXK-signaling positively and negatively interacts with auxin
  and cytokinin signaling, respectively. More details on hormone and sugar interactions
  are presented in the text.
