caption: 'Expression profiles of DEGs in pathways related to IAA, GA, and ABA hormones
  and reactive oxygen species accumulation. (A) Expression profiles of DEGs involved
  in the IAA pathway under HT and HT+EBR treatments. (B) Expression profiles of DEGs
  related to the GA pathway under HT and HT+EBR treatments. (C) Expression profiles
  of DEGs associated with the ABA pathway under HT and HT+EBR treatments. (D) Expression
  profiles of DEGs connected to the H2O2 signaling pathway in the plant MAPK signaling
  pathway under HT and HT+EBR treatments. Sample names are displayed at the bottom
  or top of the color block. Gene symbols are shown on the left or right side of the
  color block. Changes in expression levels are indicated by color changes: green
  indicates a decrease in expression level, and red indicates an increase in expression
  level. All data are means of three biological replicates (n = 3). Means with different
  letters in each treatment represent significant differences at p ≤ 0.05'
