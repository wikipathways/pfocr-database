caption: Figure 1. Hypothetical model of molecular mechanisms of miR319-mediated plant
  salinity and drought stress tolerance in creeping bentgrass. The accumulation of
  mature miR319 was elevated upon salt and drought stress, which causes downregulation
  of at least 4 putative target genes of miR319 (AsPCF5, AsPCF6, AsPCF8, and AsTCP14)
  as well as a homolog of the rice NAC domain gene AsNAC60, and therefore positively
  contributing to plant abiotic stress response. Hormones might also regulate miR319
  and its targets, and the expression level of the miR319 targets might be a balance
  of miR319-mediated target cleavage and hormone regulation of the targets. Furthermore,
  HKT gene families involved in salt exclusion mechanisms as well as mechanisms controlling
  the timing of gene expression network are also hypothesized to play an important
  role in this pathway.
