caption: Schematic representation of a dualistic model depicting the development of
  ovarian cancer. Low‐grade carcinomas are thought to develop in a stepwise manner
  from an atypical proliferative tumor through a noninvasive stage (LMP) before becoming
  invasive. These tumors are frequently associated with K‐RAS or BRAF mutations and
  loss of PTEN. Somatic high‐grade carcinomas (most commonly serous) develop from
  the ovarian surface epithelium and/or inclusion cysts without morphologically recognizable
  intermediate stages. K‐RAS and BRAF mutations are less common in these tumors, whereas
  TP53 is frequently mutated as well as members of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In hereditary
  forms of this disease (far left), the initial step in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers
  is thought to consist of a TP53 mutation followed by genotoxic injury (p53 signature).
  In the fimbria, a tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (TIC) develops in some instances
  and may invade locally or spread to other peritoneal surfaces, such as the ovary
  and pelvis. Depending on the location and rate of tumor growth, the tumor might
  be diagnosed as a primary tubal, ovarian, or peritoneal carcinoma. Whether somatic
  ovarian cancers arise via the fimbria route remains to be demonstrated.
