caption: Schematic networks detected in sarcoidosis patients illustrating the most
  predominant altered metabolic pathways and the biochemical linkage among the metabolites
  detected in sarcoidosis. a MetaboAnalyst 3.0 output. NMR data were uploaded into
  MetaboAnalyst 3.0 software and significant metabolic pathways arranged according
  to the scores from the enrichment analysis (y axis) and from the topology analysis
  (x axis). b The three major pathways include fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis/TCA
  cycle, and homocysteine/methylamine pathway. The metabolites that are significantly
  increased in sarcoidosis patients are depicted in red, whereas the metabolites that
  are reduced are in blue (p < 0.05). Dashed arrows indicate multiple step processes
