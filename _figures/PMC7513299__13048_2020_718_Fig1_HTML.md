caption: The role of adipocytes in EOC metastasis. Adipocyte-secreted cytokines, such
  as IL-6, IL-8, IL-11 and IL-33, induced EMT and detachment of EOC cells by inhibiting
  E-cadherin expression. Adipocytes affect the travel of EOC cells in the peritoneal
  fluid through modulating several functions including (1) ascites formation by secreting
  VEGF, which increases vascular permeability; (2) EOC anoikis resistance by secreting
  IGF-1, IL-6 and IL-8, which activate the survival pathway and EMT of EOC; (3) EOC
  movement by secreting MCP-1, IL-6 and IL-8, which activate the mitogenic pathway
  of EOC. Adipocytes affect EOC implantation through modulating (1) EOC adhesion by
  secreting TNF-α and HGF, which promote CD44 expression; (2) EOC invasion by secreting
  Leptin, which promote MMP2 expression. Together, these roles of adipocytes facilitate
  adipocyte-induced EOC metastasis
