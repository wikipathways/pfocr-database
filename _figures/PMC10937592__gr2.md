caption: SCFAs play a protective role as an intestinal barrier. Ethanol, LPS and toxic
  substances act on the intestinal epithelial barrier which could trigger an inflammatory
  response and cause damage to the intestinal barrier. Butyrate upregulates HIF target
  gene expression to enhance the epithelial barrier. Butyrate might enhance the abundance
  of tight junction proteins claudin-1 and ZO-1 through activation of Akt/mTOR mediated
  protein synthesis, which enhance the epithelial barrier. SCFAs bind GPR43 on colonic
  epithelial cells to stimulates K (+) efflux and hyperpolarization, which lead to
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The inflammasome pathway maintain the integrity of
  the intestinal barrier by ensuring the repair and cell survival under stress conditions.
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; ZO-1, zonula occludens-1;
  GPR43, G protein-coupled receptor 43; NLRP3, NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain
