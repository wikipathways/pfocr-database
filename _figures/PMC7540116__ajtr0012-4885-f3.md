caption: Mechanisms of metformin inhibiting cancer invasion and migration. Metformin
  inhibits cancer invasion and migration by activation of AMPK and inhibition of EMT
  processes. In addition, metformin also inhibits invasion and migration through these
  pathways. Such as, metformin works by inhibiting MALAT1/miR-142-3p or by inducing
  DNA methylation to antagonizes H19/let-7 axis; and the oncogene YAP promoter is
  inhibited by metformin by competing with IRF-1. It also reduced SUV39H1 by inhibiting
  integrin-FAK signaling. By inhibiting HIF-1α, metformin affects CAIX and PKM2 signals
  to achieve the effect of inhibiting invasion and migration. Metformin works by alleviating
  oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling through the COX2 pathway. Moreover,
  Ca2+ dependent PKCα/ERK and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways are inhibited by metformin.
  MALAT1, metastasis-related lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1; H19, long non-coding
  RNA H19; IRF-1, interferon regulatory factor-1; SUV39H1, H3 Lys9 histone methyltransferase;
  HIF-1α, hypoxia inducible factor-1.
