caption: a Cytosolic short 5’-ppp-dsRNA is sensed by RIG-I and activates signaling,
  leading to the induction of IFN-I and limited apoptosis with slow kinetics. This
  apoptosis is dependent on genes regulated by IRF-3 and IFN-I. b Cytosolic dsRNA
  introduced by the injection or transfection activates TLR3 through endosomal entrapment
  as above. In contrast to endosomal dsRNA, cytosolic dsRNA activates PKR, which results
  in the induction of SG and translational shutdown, leading to the downregulation
  of cFLIP and apoptosis through the activation of caspase 8. In addition, PKR was
  reported to promote the mitochondrial pathway in order to activate caspase 9; therefore,
  robust apoptosis was induced via caspases 8/9. c Extracellular dsRNA is incorporated
  by endocytosis and sensed by TLR3. TLR3 signals TRIF and activates signaling, leading
  to the induction of IFN-I and the expression of cFLIP in order to negatively regulate
  caspase 8. The TLR3 signaling complex also recruits FADD to activate DISC containing
  caspase 8; however, due to the effects of cFLIP, apoptosis is suppressed. When cells
  are treated with extracellular dsRNA and CHX, caspase 8 promotes apoptosis because
  of the downregulation of cFLIP.
