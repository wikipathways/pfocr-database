caption: Hypothetic pathways for IPMN initiation and progression to IPMC. In available
  murine models, KRAS appears critical to IPMN’s initiation in both the intestinal
  and gastric-PB pathways. The early association of KRAS and GNAS is supposed to correlate
  with the differentiation toward the intestinal subtype, associated to CDX2 expression
  and RNF43 alterations. In these lesions, GNAS signaling is supposed to drive carcinogenesis
  and induce a unique molecular program (in which KRAS mutations may be later selected
  against), leading to the occurrence of colloid type carcinomas with less aggressive
  features. Contrarily, other mutations such as PTEN or LKB1 (among others) might,
  in association with KRAS, induce the differentiation toward the non-intestinal pathway
  relying on a classical KRAS-driven carcinogenesis. Like cPDAC, common mutations
  such as TP53, CDKN2A, or SMAD4 accumulate during progression of these lesions, resulting
  in a tubular IPMC almost identical to cPDAC. GNAS mutations may occur also in this
  subset but at later stages, without taking over KRAS induced processes.
