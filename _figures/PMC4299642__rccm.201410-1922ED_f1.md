caption: Myristoylated alanine-rich c kinase substrate (MARCKS)-regulated phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) balance in the modulation
  of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway in normal and lung
  cancer cells. (A) In its basal state, unphosphorylated MARCKS interacts with PIP2
  via phosphorylation site domain (PSD) and prevents its conversion into PIP3 by PI3K.
  In response to physiologic stimuli, MARCKS is phosphorylated by protein kinase C/Rho
  kinase, which leads to its dissociation from PIP2, and possibly PI3K, and its translocation
  into the cytosol, where it participates in granule (mucous) secretion and cytoskeletal
  remodeling. PI3K converts PIP2 into PIP3, leading to activation of the AKT signaling
  cascade required for cell growth, survival, and other functions. On dephosphorylation,
  MARCKS translocates and sequesters PIP2 and phosphatase and tension homolog converts
  PIP3 to PIP2, thereby restoring normal balance of PIP2/PIP3 pools. (B) In lung cancer
  cells, MARCKS is persistently hyperphosphorylated through either a PKC-dependent
  and/or a PKC-independent manner, which causes its cytosolic retention and the accessibility
  of PIP2 to PI3K. This promotes increased AKT activation, leading to tumor cell growth
  and acquired resistance. Treatment of cells with the MPS peptide corresponding to
  MARCKS-PSD binds and sequesters PIP2 and possibly prevents MARCKS phosphorylation,
  thereby inhibiting AKT activation and tumor cell growth. Thin and thick arrows indicate
  physiological and pathological levels of signaling, respectively.
