caption: Maps of coronal brain sections A (-0.00 mm), B (-0.26 mm), and C (-14.36
  mm) depict key elements in the ascending pathway that links hindbrain metabolo-sensory
  and preoptic neuroendocrine motor neurons, the sole conduit of neural outflow to
  pituitary gonadotropes. The sagittal rat brain image in the lower left corner illustrates
  rostrocaudal levels of sections A-C (vertical red lines) and caudal fourth ventricular
  cannula implantation site (black arrow) used for localized induction of neuroglucopenia
  by glucose antimetabolite administration. A2 neurons are estrogen- (they express
  classical estrogen receptors, e.g. -α and −β, and are a source of steroid feedback-driven
  norepinephrine signaling to the reproductive neuroendocrine axis) as well as glucoprivic-sensitive.
  Among hindbrain catecholamine cell groups, dorsal vagal complex A2 cells (green
  circle; section C) are singularly sensitive to hindbrain neuroglucopenia in steroid-primed
  OVX female rats, resulting in diminished AVPV alpha1 adrenergic receptor activation
  (section B) and pituitary LH output volume (right of section C). Current research
  supports the notion of A2 neurons are a common substrate for opposing steroid activational
  and glucoprivic effects on LH. The current studies did not assess hypothalamic GnRH
  release during hindbrain glucoprivation, but evidence for 5TG-induced truncation
  of the LH surge provides plausible indirect evidence for inhibition of this hypophysiotropic
  signal to pituitary gonadotropes. Comprehensive understanding of the metabolic regulatory
  circuitry revealed here will require insight on connectivity between glucoprivic-sensitive
  AVPV substrates and rostral preoptic GnRH neurons (blue circle; section C).
