caption: A potential molecular mechanism underlying IT exhibits an anti-amyloid effect.
  Here, we propose a novel molecular mechanism in which the p38 MAPK-p53-HSPB1 axis
  could play a key role in the anti-amyloid load. The p38 MAPK-p53-HSPB1 axis showed
  upregulation in the livers of mice with exercise (top left) or systemic AApoAII
  amyloidosis alone (top right). In particular, phosphorylated HSPB1 showed an exercise-dependent
  increase. Exercise additively enhanced this phenomenon in the amyloid-reduced liver
  and greatly increased levels of phosphorylated HSPB1 outside the cell. Phosphorylated
  HSPB1 colocalized with amyloid depositions, which in turn could inhibit fibril formation
  (bottom).
