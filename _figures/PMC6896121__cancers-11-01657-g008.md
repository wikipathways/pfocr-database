caption: The therapeutic effects and mechanisms of AC009 in colorectal cancer (CRC)
  cell treatment. After Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) extract AC009 treatment, CRC cells
  may undergo apoptosis through the caspase-3- and caspase-9-dependent signaling pathways
  and further downregulate the Bcl-2 expression. In addition, AC009 also caused cell-cycle
  arrest in CRC cell treatment. AC009 also promoted miRNA-27a expression and further
  inhibition of KRAS expression. Then, p-Erk, which is a downstream protein of KRAS
  signaling pathway, was also downregulated and further caused the cancer stem cell
  (CSC) markers to decrease after AC009 treatment in CRC.
