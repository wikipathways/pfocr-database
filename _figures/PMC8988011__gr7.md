caption: Proposed mechanism of action of GA-017. GA-017 inhibits the kinase activity
  of LATS1/2 and subsequently stabilizes YAP/TAZ, inducing the expression of YAP/TAZ-regulated
  genes. The gene products consequently enhance the proliferation of cells. Subsequently
  observed changes in MST1/2 and LATS1/2 are indicated on the left. A possible feedback
  is also shown. LATS, large tumor suppressor protein; MST, Mammalian Ste20-like kinase;
  TAZ, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif; YAP, Yes-associated protein.
