caption: Schematic representation of the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. Long-chain
  fatty acids need to be transported into the mitochondria by an active transport
  system. Because fatty acids in the cytoplasm are activated as acyl-CoA esters, they
  must be bound to carnitine for transport across the mitochondrial membranes. In
  contrast, medium- and short-chain fatty acids do not need an active transport system
  and can easily undergo β-oxidation. This pathway consists of four cyclic steps.
  Each step shortens the acyl-CoA by two carbons. The electrons generated by each
  oxidative reaction are transferred to FAD or NAD+ and are forwarded to ubiquinone
  or the respiratory chain, respectively. (1) Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (very long-,
  long-, medium-, and short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, i.e., VLCAD, long-chain
  acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), and
  SCAD, respectively).; (2) 2,3-Enoyl-CoA hydratase (LCEH and SCEH). (3) 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA
  dehydrogenases (LCHAD and SCHAD). (4) β-Ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (LCKAT, MCKAT, and
  SCKAT). MIM, mitochondrial inner membrane; MOM, mitochondrial outer membrane.
