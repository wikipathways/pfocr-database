  the aerobic pathway is shown for P. denitrificans or Sinorhizobium meliloti (the

  and B. megaterium; the structure of vitamin B12 with the lower ligand 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole
  (DMB) and the upper ligand consisting of either 5′-deoxyadenosyl, methyl, hydroxyl
  or cyan group, with their respective names being adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), methylcobalamin
  (MeCbl), hydroxocobalamin (OHCbl) and cyanocobalamin (CNCbl); the gene names are
  in blue, red, and black and used throughout this work. The anaerobic and aerobic
  cobalamin pathways are characterized by the early and late cobalt insertions, respectively.
  In the anaerobic pathway, CysG is a common enzyme for siroheme and cobalamin synthesis.
  Whilst decarboxylation of UroIII leads to the biosynthesis of hemes and chlorophylls,
  methylation of UroIII at C-2 and C-7 results in the synthesis of precorrin-2, that
  is also the last common intermediate in the synthesis of coenzyme F430 and siroheme
  [,,,].'
