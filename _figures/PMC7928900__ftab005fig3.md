caption: Pathway analysis of ACE2 network. The pathway analysis based on Reactom database
  suggests most of the proteins in the ACE2 network were found to be associated with
  functions such as the disease, immune system, autophagy, cell cycle, programmed
  cell death, transcription, DNA repair and signal transduction.
