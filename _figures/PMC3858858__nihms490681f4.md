caption: Overall PI3K and MAPK-Erk signaling is complex, but can highly influence
  the balance between cell survival and death. Multiple pathway inhibitors exist to
  further research cell signaling mechanisms. Though normal or pathological conditions
  can stimulate apoptotic cell death directly through death receptor and caspase activation,
  numerous signaling activities and interactions within a cell can indirectly influence
  cell fate. PI3K and MAPK pathways may individually, or through crosstalk, impact
  cell survival. For example, Akt may activate Erk to inhibit apoptosis. A variety
  of compounds targeting proteins within these cascades can help deepen our understanding
  of the complexities of PI3K and MAPK signaling in CNS pathology and protection.
