caption: 'Schematic diagram of the potential mechanisms of HDAC3 in microglial activation
  and/or neuropathic pain. Injuries including spinal cord injury and ischemic stroke
  not only induce HDAC3 expression, but also promote HDAC3 activity through phosphorylation
  modification by the LRRK2/MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. HDAC3 expression and activity
  have several effects: (1) They inhibit the Sirt1/Nrf2 pathway to decrease the expression
  of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), leading
  to the transcription of inflammation-related genes; (2) They decrease STAT1 expression
  and acetylation, as well as NF-κB p65 acetylation. Acetylated NF-κB p65 and the
  complex formed with acetylated STAT1 and NF-κB p65 both suppress the transcriptional
  activity of NF-κB p65, thereby reducing neuroinflammation; (3) They induce the formation
  of the AIM2 inflammasome through diminishing STAT1 acetylation and subsequently
  enhancing STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation in microglia. Furthermore,
  HDAC3 promotes NF-κB p65 deacetylation and nuclear localization, contributing to
  the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and neuroinflammation. The deacetylation
  of NF-κB p65 also enhances the activation of downstream NF-κB target genes related
  to inflammation, such as Cox1 and Cox2, which are enzymes involved in PGE2 synthesis.
  Additionally, TET2 can recruit and interact with HDAC3 and acetylated NF-κB p65,
  leading to p65 deacetylation and consequently downregulating the transcription of
  proinflammatory cytokine genes in microglia'
