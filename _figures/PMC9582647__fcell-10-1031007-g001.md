caption: 'Proposed mechanisms for membrane triggered aging in neurons and hypothalamus.
  Changes in lipid composition give raise to an “old membrane”. In hippocampal neurons,
  this old lipid context favors receptor subunit interaction and ligand independent
  activation of TrkB and Insulin receptors. Constitutive activation of these receptors
  greatly increases the activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Enhanced PI3K will have
  multiple consequences in old cells: 1) phosphorylation of IRS-1 favors a feedback
  inhibition of IR signaling, leading to insulin resistance. 2) In neuronal cells,
  insulin resistance also leads to impaired insulin-triggered memory formation. 3)
  Akt inhibits GSK3b activity and impairs the AMPA receptor endocytosis required for
  proper synaptic plasticity. 4) Overactivation of mTOR by PI3K leads to impaired
  autophagy which, in old individuals, contributes to trigger inflammation and aging.
  5) Increased PI3K in the hypothalamus appears to activate NF-kB, leading to microinflammation
  and decreased secretion of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), which is a main
  determinant for aging. 6) decreased ω-3 PUFAs in old cells or impaired function
  of G protein-coupled receptor GPR120 would both contribute to trigger proinflammatory
  signals through overactivation of TLR4. 7) Enhanced PI3K activity in the hypothalamus
  may impair leptin signaling via Socs3, leading to aging-associated obesity. 8) Stress-induced
  levels of cortisol would increase AKT signalling. 9) The inflammatory context reached
  by PI3K overactivation will result in the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines
  as IL1β, which further contributes to activate PI3K as part of a positive pro-aging
  loop. 10) Impaired response of the NMDAR-CaMKII pathway due to lipid alterations
  will alter the pattern of MeCP2 phosphorylation in old neurons leading to changes
  in the genome structure.'
