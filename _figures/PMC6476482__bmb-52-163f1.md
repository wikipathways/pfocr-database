caption: The fMet-mediated protein synthesis and fMet/N-end rule pathway in eukaryotes.
  In the stationary phase or upon starvation for nutrients, stress-activated kinase
  Gcn2 increases the cytosolic retention of mitochondrial formyltransferase (Fmt1)
  and also partly, its activity. As a result, Fmt1 augments the fMet-tRNAi in the
  cytosol and subsequently upregulates Nt-formylated proteins. These Nt-formylated
  proteins are important for the survival of cells against specific stresses and are
  destroyed in a proteasome-dependent manner through polyubiquitylation by Psh1 E3
  ubiquitin ligase targeting the N-terminal fMet residues of Nt-formylated proteins.
