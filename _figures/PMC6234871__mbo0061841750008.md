caption: 'Model of HAD2- and PFK9-mediated metabolic regulation. Abbreviations: fru6P,
  fructose 6-phosphate; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; gly3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; pyr, pyruvate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; DOXP,
  deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate, MEcPP, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate;
  IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate. Black circles represent metabolites. Key metabolites
  (FBP, DOXP, and MEcPP) are shown in purple. The glycolytic metabolites DHAP and
  PEP are imported into the apicoplast and are converted to gly3P and pyruvate, respectively
  (, ). HAD2 may act as a negative regulator of PFK9, directly or indirectly, or may
  inhibit glycolysis downstream of PFK9. Loss of HAD2 results in increased substrate
  availability to the MEP pathway. In had2 strains, reduction in PFK9 activity may
  counteract or bypass metabolic perturbations due to loss of HAD2.'
