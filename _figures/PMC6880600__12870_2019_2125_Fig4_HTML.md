caption: 'The Coral2 module-based phosphatidylinositol (PI) signaling system networks.
  a: The network for PI signal system. This network was constructed by extracting
  those Coral2 genes which annotated to the PI signal pathway as seed nodes, with
  an edge weight cut-off of 0.4. The hub genes present in the network were coded red
  and the nodes with at least three neighbours within one distance were coded yellow.
  The node size represents the level of connectivity. b: The sub-netwok for hub genes
  in PI signal and candidate hub-interacted genes. The sub-network was built by extracting
  hub genes in the UPP and the selected candidate co-expression genes connected to
  more than one hub genes'
