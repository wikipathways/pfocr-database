caption: Remodeling of hepatic intermediary metabolism in fenofibrate-treated mice.
  Fenofibrate treatment promotes adipose tissue lipolysis, thereby enhancing hepatic
  influx of glycerol and fatty acids. In the liver, fenofibrate promotes fatty acid
  β-oxidation in peroxisomes and mitochondria. PPARα target genes are indicated in
  blue (see also Ref. ). Acetyl-CoA generated by β-oxidation is used for ketogenesis
  and energy supply but also serves as a substrate for fatty acid synthesis via de
  novo lipogenesis and fatty acid elongation. Acetyl-CoA transport over the mitochondrial
  membrane is facilitated by increased pyruvate/malate cycling, which generates NADPH
  to support the lipogenic flux. In parallel, hepatic glucose uptake and glycolysis
  are suppressed, and the contribution of acetyl-CoA from hepatic glucose metabolism
  to the lipogenic flux is consequently reduced. Glycerol is converted into glucose
  6-phosphate via the gluconeogenic pathway. Glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P) cycles through
  the pentose phosphate pathway to triose phosphate and back to Glc-6-P and PPP, thereby
  generating NADPH.
