caption: Differential effects of leptin and adiponectin in vascular endothelium. Dual
  effects of gAD and fAD on endothelium with and without inflammatory stimuli. Circulating
  fAD gets cleaved by leucocyte elastase (secreted from neutrophils) releasing globular
  domain (gAD) fraction. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 receptors following engagement with fAD,
  signals downstream activating the following pathways (a) AMPK, (b) cAMP-PKA, (c)
  MAPK, and (d) PI3K-Akt. Activation of cAMP-PKA/AMPK causes increased NO production,
  decreased ROS generation, suppression of NF-κβ pathway leading to reduction in IL-18,
  and endothelial adhesion molecule expression. These events collectively lead to
  a decrease in EC permeability, motility, and migration. Activation of AMPK/PI-3k/Akt
  signalling pathway specifically leads to eNOS phosphorylation and NO release. In
  vitro studies have shown that gAD independently activates NF-κβ via AdipoR1/AMPK-Akt
  pathway. Proangiogenic/inflammatory effects of gAD have been shown to involve AMPK-Akt
  pathways. However, these pathways (AMPK-Akt) also contribute to an opposite effect
  of gAD in coexisting states of hyperglycaemia and inflammation. In hyperglycaemic
  and hyperinsulinaemic states, gAD improves endothelial dysfunction via activation
  of Akt-AMP-eNOS pathways and suppression of endothelial ROS generation via inhibition
  of NF-κβ signalling. The binding of leptin to its receptor (OB-Rb) leads to the
  phosphorylation of Ob-R/JAK2 complex. Subsequent activation of downstream signalling
  cascades including PI3k/Akt-STAT3 activation results in transcription of genes [MCP-1,
  TNF-α, IL-6/-2, and endothelin-1] involved in proatherogenic/angiogenic and inflammatory
  effects, potentiating endothelial proliferation. Additionally, leptin signalling
  in ECs also activates endothelial cell adhesion molecules, MMPs, and VEGF resulting
  in impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation promoting hypertension and atherosclerosis.

  description: Differential effects of leptin and adiponectin in vascular endothelium.
    Dual effects of gAD and fAD on endothelium with and without inflammatory stimuli.
    Circulating fAD gets cleaved by leucocyte elastase (secreted from neutrophils)
    releasing globular domain (gAD) fraction. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 receptors following
    engagement with fAD, signals downstream activating the following pathways (a)
    AMPK, (b) cAMP-PKA, (c) MAPK, and (d) PI3K-Akt. Activation of cAMP-PKA/AMPK causes
    increased NO production, decreased ROS generation, suppression of NF-κβ pathway
    leading to reduction in IL-18, and endothelial adhesion molecule expression. These
    events collectively lead to a decrease in EC permeability, motility, and migration.
    Activation of AMPK/PI-3k/Akt signalling pathway specifically leads to eNOS phosphorylation
    and NO release. In vitro studies have shown that gAD independently activates NF-κβ
    via AdipoR1/AMPK-Akt pathway. Proangiogenic/inflammatory effects of gAD have been
    shown to involve AMPK-Akt pathways. However, these pathways (AMPK-Akt) also contribute
    to an opposite effect of gAD in coexisting states of hyperglycaemia and inflammation.
    In hyperglycaemic and hyperinsulinaemic states, gAD improves endothelial dysfunction
    via activation of Akt-AMP-eNOS pathways and suppression of endothelial ROS generation
    via inhibition of NF-κβ signalling. The binding of leptin to its receptor (OB-Rb)
