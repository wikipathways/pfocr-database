caption: TNIP1-mediated signaling pathways. The canonical NF-κB activation (left)
  and cell death (middle top) pathways are mediated by the TNFα-R. (Left) In the NF-κB
  pathway, intracellular proteins are recruited to the TNFα-R to form complex I, which
  facilitates the phosphorylation and subsequent activation and polyubiquitination
  of NEMO. IκB is then targeted for degradation, allowing the p65/p50 NF-κB heterodimer
  to translocate into the nucleus. TNIP1 inhibits NF-κB activation by preventing NEMO’s
  polyubiquitination. Additionally, TNIP1 blocks the processing of p105 to the NF-κB
  subunit p50, therefore decreasing the available pool of NF-κB. (Middle top) In the
  programmed cell death pathway, complex I dissociates from the TNFα-R and recruits
  FADD and caspase 8 to form complex II. Complex II mediates the activation of caspase
  3 and tBid, leading to apoptosis. TNIP1 prevents the recruitment of caspase 8 to
  complex I which prevents the signaling cascade. (Right) EFGR initiates a MAP kinase
  pathway leading to the phosphorylation and activation of ERK2, a MAPKK kinase. ERK2
  can phosphorylate cytosolic and nuclear substrates including various transcription
  factors. ERK2 nuclear translocation is inhibited by TNIP1. (Middle nucleus) TNIP1
  represses nuclear receptors transcriptional activity. Upon ligand-NR binding, TNIP1
  exerts its inhibitory effects on either PPAR or RAR. Red (□) denotes TNIP1’s inhibitory
  functions.
