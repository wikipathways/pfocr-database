caption: A model illustrating the alterations of the UPR signaling pathway and the
  responses of mitochondria by the absence of KDELR–Erd2. The absence of Erd2 impairs
  the retrograde transport of the xDEL-containing ER-resident proteins, inducing UPR.
  As a result, mitochondrial respiration and the production of mitochondrial ROS are
  enhanced by a transcriptional program that is controlled by UPR. Both UPR induction
  and the increases in mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial ROS production
  are required for maintaining cell viability of cells lacking Erd2. ER, endoplasmic
