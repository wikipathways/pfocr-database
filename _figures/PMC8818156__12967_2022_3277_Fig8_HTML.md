caption: Mechanism diagram. Overexpressed CENPF could induce the expression of CDK1,
  augment G2/M-phase conversion, promote cell proliferation and lead to the accumulation
  of abnormal gene mutations, namely TMB, during the process of DNA replication or
  cell cycle. Meanwhile, these tumor signatures, including DNA damage, etc., might
  trigger the activation of the p53 signaling pathway and the downstream expression
  of p21 and Bax, thus inducing p53 mediated anti-tumor effect by arresting the cell
  cycle of G2/M-phase and boosting cell apoptosis in ACC
