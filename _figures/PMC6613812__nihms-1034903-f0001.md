caption: In Drosophila, amino acids, sugars, and fats control the release of insulin-like–peptides
  (ILPs), which bind the insulin receptor homolog (InR). Downstream signaling is mediated
  by insulin receptor substrate (Chico) binding to InR, followed by recruitment of
  phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), which leads to enzymatic conversion of phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4)-bisphosphate (PIP2) to PIP3. Akt kinase recognizes PIP3 to control cell proliferation
  and growth. TOR kinase can also be regulated by the availability of extracellular
  amino acids which enter the cell via Slimfast. TOR kinase activation leads to phosphorylation
  of effectors such as S6 kinase, which stimulates protein translation and cellular
  growth.
