caption: (A) In wt mice C/EBPβ-mRNA translation into LIP is modulated by calorie/nutrient
  availability through mTORC1 signalling, while expression of LAP is not affected.
  Together with other mTORC1-controlled pathways (Pathway X and Y) LAP/LIP expression
  ratio determines healthspan and survival. The different pathways may either be,
  modulated (C/EBPβ), activated (Pathway X) or inhibited (Pathway Y) by mTORC1 and
  may have different sensitivities to mTORC1 modulators (e.g. rapamycin or nutrients),
  creating diversity in response (e.g. based on gender, genetic background or age).
  In addition LIP is upregulated by mechanisms during aging that are not well understood.
  (B) Genetic ablation of the C/EBPβ-uORF prevents the mTORC1-dependent and/or age-associated
  upregulation of LIP and results in C/EBPβ-dependent health- and lifespan extension.
  The C/EBPβΔuORF mutation mimics reduced mTORC1 signalling only at the level of LIP
  expression, leaving mTORC1 control of pathway X and Y unaffected.
