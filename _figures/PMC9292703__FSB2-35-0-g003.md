caption: Endogenous tryptophan metabolic pathways. In the gut, about 1%–2% of dietary
  tryptophan is metabolized through Tph1 mediated 5‐HT pathway. About 95% of dietary
  tryptophan is metabolized through IDO1 mediated kynurenine pathway. (1) 5‐HT pathway
  of tryptophan metabolism occurs mainly in the enterochromaffin cells. (2) Kynurenine
  pathway of tryptophan metabolism occurs mainly in the intestinal epithelial cells
  (shown) and antigen‐presenting cells (not shown). 5‐HT can enter portions of the
  kynurenine pathway via conversion to 5‐hydroxykynuramine by IDO1. 5‐HTP can also
  be converted to 5‐hydroxykynurenine by IDO1. Key enzymes are represented in blue
