caption: Integration of publicly available resources as a foundation for InnateDB.
  More than 100 000 interactions were integrated into InnateDB from the Molecular
  Interaction (MINT) database (); the IntAct database (); the Database of Interacting
  Proteins (DIP) (); the General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) ()
  and the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) (). Cross-references to
  more than 2500 pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  pathway database (), the NCI-Nature Pathway Interaction Database (PID) (http://pid.nci.nih.gov),
  Integrating Network Objects with Hierarchies (INOH) pathway database (http://www.inoh.org/),
  NetPath (http://www.netpath.org) and the Reactome database () were also incorporated.
  Up-to-date versions of Ensembl (www.ensembl.org) provide details of human and mouse
  genes, transcripts and proteins along with rich protein and gene annotation from
  the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) (), Gene Ontology () and Entrez Gene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
