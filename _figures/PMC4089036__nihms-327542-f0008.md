caption: Model of inflammatory response to EAEC. Adherence of EAEC to the apical site
  of the epithelium and possibly other contributing factors triggers activating of
  PKC-δ which upon translocation to the host cell membrane participates in activation
  of iPLA2. Upon activation, iPLA2 then facilitates release of arachidonic acid from
  the membrane to the cytosol from where it is metabolized into HXA3 through the 12/15-LOX
  pathway. The signal transduction cascade culminates in MRP2-facilitated apical release
  of HXA3 which forms a chemotactic gradient causing migration of IL-8-recruited PMNs
  across the epithelium to the site of infection.
