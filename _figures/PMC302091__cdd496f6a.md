caption: Fig. 6. Decrease and replenishment of UDP-GlcNAc levels in EMeg32–/– cells.
  (A) Scheme depicting the synthesis of nucleotide sugars (boxed) with the pathway
  relevant for EMeg32 activity in bold. Main routes for further use of UDP-GlcNAc
  are indicated. Doubleheaded arrows represent several enzymatic steps not depicted
  in detail. Adapted from . (B) EMeg32+/– (dashed line) or EMeg32–/– (solid line)
  EBs were labeled for 90 min with [3H]GlcN and analyzed by HPLC. Positions of GlcN-6P,
  GlcNAc-6P and UDP-GlcNAc standards are marked by arrows. (C) HPLC elution profile
  at A254 nm. Cells used were C3a+/–, 56IIa–/– or 56IIa–/– MEFs supplemented with
  10 mM GlcNAc for 24 h (–/– GlcNAc). Arrows indicate elution positions of UDP-GlcNAc
  and UDP-Gal; the peak between is UDP-GalNAc. (D) Titration of GlcNAc into the culture
  medium for 24 h and determination of UDP-HexNAc:UDP-Hex ratio by HPLC at A254 nm.
  EMeg32–/– MEFs (56IIa, open square; 22a, open circle); +/– MEFs (C3a, filled triangle).
  56IIa or 22a MEFs re-expressing EMeg32 (filled square or circle, respectively) were
  also analyzed. The UDP-Hex levels remained unchanged.
