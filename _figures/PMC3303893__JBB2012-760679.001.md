caption: The schematic diagram of base excision repair (BER) pathway for DNA repair
  throughout the cell cycle. BER is important for removing damaged bases. BER is initiated
  by DNA glycosylases (e.g., MPG), which recognize and remove specific damaged or
  inappropriate bases, forming AP sites. These are then cleaved by an AP endonuclease.
  The resulting single-strand break can then be processed by either short-patch or
  long-patch BER.
