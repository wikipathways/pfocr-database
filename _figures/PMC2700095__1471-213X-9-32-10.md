caption: 'Alternative kinetic model incorporating unknown transcription factor (TFx)
  activation by Eda/Edar signaling. This model is a diagram of the alternative hypothesis
  that is more consistent with the quantitative mRNA data for Eda/Edar signaling than
  the hypothesis that NFκB1 serves as the main signaling pathway mediating Eda/Edar
  signaling. Black arrows represent processes (chemical reactions, transport, or binding).
  Rectangles represent states. A state is a molecule or complex in a physiologic place.
  The states are color coded as follows: Yellow is the unknown transcription factor
  TFx and its upstream activation signaling pathway; purple are the mRNA''s; green
  are the promoters that are upregulated by TFx; red are the promoters that are downregulated
  by TFx. Places are represented by the background ivory or mauve bands of color and
  are labeled at the bottom of the diagram. Green and red dashed lines represent,
  respectively, positive or negative regulation of process by states. Processes with
  only starts or ends cross the boundary of the modeled system. This diagram was produced
  by ProcessDB software .'
