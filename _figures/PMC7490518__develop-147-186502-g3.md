caption: Signaling pathways leading to Myosin II activation. Myosin II can be activated
  by the ROCK, MRCK, Citron kinase and MLCK kinases and is inactivated by Myosin phosphatase.
  The activation of ROCK is controlled by GPCRs and their downstream G proteins, as
  well as apical polarity proteins Crumbs (Crb) and Bazooka (Baz), and microtubule
  networks (MTs). In Drosophila, the ligand Fog binds to GPCRs to activate heterotrimeric
  G proteins, which in turn bind to different RhoGEFs to activate the Rho1/ROCK/Myosin
  signaling pathway.
