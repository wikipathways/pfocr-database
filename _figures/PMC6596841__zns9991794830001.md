caption: Gpr17 signaling pathway following lysolecithin insult. The signaling pathway
  tracked in primary rat OPCs and differentiated oligodendrocytes (labeled as OL lineage
  cell) in vitro. Lysolecithin treatment increases Olig2 expression in oligodendrocytes
  via an unknown mechanism. Following this, Olig2 upregulates Gpr17 expression. Gpr17
  activation leads to reduced intracellular cAMP levels with subsequent decrease in
  PKA activation. This in turn affects the expression of several downstream genes,
  including downregulation of c-Fos, which results in upregulation of Xaf1, a proapoptotic
  gene that leads to oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, Epac1 is downregulated
  as a result of this signaling cascade, which leads to an inhibition of oligodendrocyte
  differentiation. Green represents the factors that are induced in this process.
  Red represents the elements that are inhibited.
