caption: A schematic diagram of molecular interactions stimulated by HMW-HA . We propose
  that HMW-HA activates two distinct signaling cascades, one ERK-dependent and another
  NFκB-dependent, which lead to the induction of differentiation and invasion in epicardial
  cells. CD44 and MEKK1 are important for the activation of both cascades, although
  HMW-HA may also activate ERK1/2 via other mechanisms.
