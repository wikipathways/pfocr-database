caption: Schematic illustration of the inhibitory effect of black radish extract (BRE)
  in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. BRE may be beneficial in
  treating inflammation through its selective immunomodulatory effects, which may
  be mediated by Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) inhibition and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2)/heme
  oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signal transduction pathway activation, respectively. The arrows
  represent the activation, whiles the T-shaped arrows indicate inhibition. ATF4,
  activating transcription factor 4; IL, interleukin; NO, nitric oxide; iNOS, inducible
  NO synthase; KEAP1, Kelch-like epichlorohydrin-associated protein 1; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; P, phosphorylation; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor alpha.
