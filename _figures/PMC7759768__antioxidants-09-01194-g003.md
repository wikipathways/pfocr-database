caption: 'Major sources of oxidative stress in Parkinson’s disease and the corresponding
  antioxidant defense mechanism in dopaminergic neurons. (A) In a pathological state,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) act through a series of mechanisms resulting in cell
  damage and lipid peroxidation, which causes Parkinson’s disease. When anthocyanins
  are involved, they block ROS. (B) In a physiological state, there is an absence
  of ROS, which promotes cell growth without lipid peroxidation and a healthy cell
  is seen. The arrows represent an uninterrupted pathway. The T represents a blocked
  pathway. Abbreviations: UPS, ubiquitin proteasome system; α-syn, α-synuclein; AMPA,
  α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; DR1
  and DR2 (dopamine receptor 1 and 2); DA, dopamine, DJ-1, Protein deglycase []. Licensee
