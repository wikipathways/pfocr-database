caption: 'Meta-organism entangled metabolic pathway of microbial 3M3SH malodor biotransformation
  steered by human precursor thiol conjugate substrate in ABCC11 haplotypes. Results
  assimilated into a functional cartoon model of skin microbiome/human mutualism that
  entangles human ABCC11 transporter activity and microbial pyruvate + 3M3SH biosynthesis
  in osmidrosis. Steps are as follows. Host axillary apocrine gland metabolism initially
  generates S-glutathione-3M3SH conjugate molecules that are transported into intracellular
  vesicles by ABCC11 membrane transporters. Within the vesicles, S-glutathione-3M3SH
  is converted to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH by a gamma-glutamyl transferase step9. Shedding
  of fragmented vesicles onto the skin surface exposes the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH, becoming
  available for commensal bacteria uptake transport via POT10,11. Relative magnitude
  concentrations of the human thiols on the skin surface are proportional to ABCC11
  functional transporter activity, as positively correlated with expression by copy
  numbers of the wild type C allele vs. mutant T allele SNP rs17822931 (CC ~ CT > TT).
  A unique anthropogenic clade of Staphylococcusexploits host-supplied thiol substrates
  to generate pyruvate as an energy source along with 3M3SH byproduct10,12. Niche
  suitability of host axillae to adapt Staphylococcus residence harbored on its skin
  depends on the presence of the starting S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH conjugated thiol precursor
  supplied by host’s shed apocrine gland vesicles. Thus, relative abundance of Staphylococcus
  harbored on axillae skin is positively correlated with copies of the C allele (CC ~ CT > TT).
  Volatile 3M3SH is the dominating thiol byproduct of the pyruvate biosynthesis, contributing
  to axillary malodor phenotype, in particular attributable to Staphylococcus hominis expression
  of these enzymes7–14,16,18. The meta-organism mutualism genomics of odor binary
  phenotype manifests as a host Mendelian autosomal recessive familial trait, as in
  Fig. 5. The microbial transporter and enzymes are described in Fig. 4. Key: “S-glutathione-3M3SH”
  is glutathione-S-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol conjugate; “S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH” is (S-(6-hydroxy-4-methylhexan-4-yl)-L-cysteinylglycine);
  “Cys-3M3SH” is (S-(6-hydroxy-4-methylhexan-4-yl)-L-cysteine); “3M3SH” is (3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol)'
