caption: Working diagram for the mechanism of SA application improved alfalfa freezing
  tolerance in SA signaling transduction. Exogenous SA could improve the free SA in
  alfalfa leaves after freezing stress primarily through the PAL pathway. Moreover,
  SA induced MAPK cascades to regulate WRKY22 to participate in the SA signaling pathway,
  including the NPR1-dependent pathway and NPR1-independent pathway. We hypothesize
  that the hub gene MPK3 contributes to WRKY22 binding to the W-box to promote the
  expression of NPR1 genes downstream and NPR1-independent related genes against freezing
  stress. In the NPR1-dependent pathway, NPR1 enters the nucleus, which could bind
  to TGA1 with the as-1 element to regulate the expression of PR1 genes to defend
  against freezing stress. In the NPR1-independent pathway, WRKY22 could directly
  regulate the expression of SODs, PODs, APXs, GSTs, and HSPs. Collectively, SA enhanced
  the antioxidant enzymes of SOD, POD, and APX to improve freezing tolerance in alfalfa.
