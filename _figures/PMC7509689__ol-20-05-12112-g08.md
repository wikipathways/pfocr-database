caption: Schematic diagram summarizing the proposed effects of MET on endometrial
  carcinoma cells under normal and high glucose conditions. Pathways () and () are
  influenced by MET under normal but not high glucose conditions. The MET-induced
  increase of PGR-B transcript levels is lost in Ishikawa cells under normal or high
  glucose conditions when KLF9 expression is reduced via pathway (); instead, induction
  of PGR-A transcript levels is observed. Pathway () depicts MET-mediated inhibition
  of PGR-A expression in response to MPA administration under high glucose. Induction
  of PGR-B expression by MET is mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase and other
  yet unknown pathways (). Lines with an arrowhead and with a blocked bar represent
  pathway promotion and inhibition, respectively. MET, metformin; E2, 17β-estradiol;
  PGR, progesterone receptor; MPA, MPA, medroxyprogesterone acetate; siKLF9, siRNAtargeting
  Krüppel-like factor 9.
