caption: 'In vascular endothelial cells, binding of apelin or elabela/toddler (ELA)
  to the apelin receptor results in Gαi-mediated inhibition of cAMP production and
  activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT signalling cascades, leading
  to vasodilatation. In cardiomyocytes, activation of the apelin receptor leads to
  a Gαq-mediated increase in cardiac contractility and cardiac output through activation
  of the phospholipase C (PLC)–protein kinase C (PKC) pathway with subsequent enhanced
  activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) and increased intracellular pH. The increase
  in intracellular Na+ activates the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), leading to a rise in
  intracellular calcium and increased myocardial contractility. Apelin-13 is thought
  to promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via PI3K–AKT–ERK1/ERK2–p70S6K and PI3K-induced
  autophagy (not shown). The metabolic effects of apelin receptor activation have
  been proposed to be mediated via Gαi and Gαq. Signalling via β-arrestin leads to
  apelin receptor desensitization and internalization. The internalized receptor is
  targeted for degradation or recycled to the cell surface. β-Arrestin-mediated signalling
  may also contribute to the actions of apelin. DAG, diacylglycerol; eNOS, endothelial
