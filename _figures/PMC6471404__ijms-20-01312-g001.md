caption: Schematic model showing multiple signaling networks active in Populus in
  response to NaCl stress. NaCl induces the efflux of intracellular ATP (iATP) and
  an increase in extracellular ATP (eATP), which is sensed by P2K1 in the plasma membrane
  (PM) and leads to the induction of H2O2 production. This stimulates the movement
  of Ca2+ into the cells via Ca2+-permeable channels. The elevated cytosolic Ca2+
  concentration initiates the SOS pathway by stimulating Na+/H+ antiporters, such
  as SOS1, localized in the PM to extrude Na+, or activates CBL10, forming the CBL10–SOS2
  complex, which may indirectly target the NHX type antiporters to the tonoplast to
  compartmentalize Na+ into vacuoles in green tissues. The elevated cytosolic Ca2+
  also stimulates tonoplast-localized NHX1/3 to accumulate Na+(K+) into vacuoles.
  Besides, the elevated cytosolic Ca2+ increases H+-ATPase activity in the PM, which
  activates a H+ pump to supply a proton gradient for the Na+/H+ antiporters, stimulating
  the extrusion of Na+. A proton gradient supplied by the H+ pump contributes to the
  activation of NADPH oxidases, which leads to H2O2 production. H+-ATPases can also
  inhibit the efflux of K+ by further polarizing the PM. All these signaling components
  help to maintain K+/Na+ homeostasis in Populus cells.
