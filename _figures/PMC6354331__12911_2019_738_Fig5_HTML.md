caption: 'Enrichment analysis with DAVID 6.8 of the associated genes for the 4 novel
  diseases and COPD. Two enriched KEGG pathways shared by the four diseases. a Venn
  graph to show the number of overlapping enriched KEGG pathways among the 4 diseases.
  LI: Lung injury; PS: Pulmonary Sarcoidosis; COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
  Disease; ALI: Acute Lung Injury. Two KEGG pathways are shared by the four diseases.
  b HIF-1 Signaling pathway. c Pathways in cancer. Different colors of the box represent
  the genes in the pathway that are shared by different diseases. Blue: ALI & COPD;
  red: ALI & LI & COPD & PS; yellow: ALI & COPD & PS; black: LI & COPD; purple: ALI
  & LI & COPD; orange: COPD & PS; gray: COPD unique except for LPAR1 which is LI unique.
  RELA belongs to LI & COPD, ERBB2 belongs to ALI & COPD, MMP2 and MMP9 belong to
  ALI & LI & COPD, LPAR1 is LI unique. Since they correspond to the same KEGG symbol
  with other genes, the colors are represented by the first gene in each group'
