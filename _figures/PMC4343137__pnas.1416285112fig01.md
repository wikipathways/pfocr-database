caption: Currently characterized tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathways. The core enzymes
  present in all tetrapyrrole-synthesizing organisms are shown in the blue box. The
  protoporphyrin-independent, ancestral heme biosynthesis pathway of the Firmicutes
  and Actinobacteria described in the current study is shown in orange. The primitive
  heme pathway of the archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria is shown in the violet
  box, and the modern heme pathway of Proteobacteria and eukaryotes is shown in the
  red box. Enzyme abbreviations are those abbreviations currently in acceptance and
  are shown with single solid lines. Pathways involving more than a single enzyme
  are shown as double-line arrows. The dashed line represents a proposed pathway for
  chlorophyll synthesis in bacteria that do not use protoporphyrin. ALA, 5-aminolevulinic
