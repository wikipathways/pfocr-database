caption: Participation of cell cycle regulators in metabolic pathways. The E2F‐pRB
  pathway is involved in several metabolic pathways. In glucose metabolism of pancreatic
  β‐cells E2F1 regulates Kir6.2, a key component of the KATP channel, controlling
  glucose‐induced insulin secretion []. Moreover, E2F1 also enhances glycolysis in
  bladder and prostate cancer cell lines through the SIRT6 that inhibits the transcription
  of several key glycolytic genes such as GLUT1 []. Furthermore, E2F1 stimulates glycolysis
  by upregulating the expression of the enzyme 6‐phophofructo‐2 kinase/fructose‐2,6‐bisphosphatase
  [, ]. E2F1 also induces expression of PDK1/4 in pancreatic cancer cells and PDK4
  in the heart. PDKs inhibit PDH and thereby oxidative metabolism [, ]. In addition,
  associated to pRB E2F1 modulates the expression of key genes implicated in mitochondrial
  biogenesis or oxidative phosphorylation, such as mitochondrial topoisomerase 1 (Top1mt)
  [], PGC‐1α [], cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 COX4, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit
  7C [, ]. In nucleotide metabolism, E2F1 induces dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine
  kinase, TS and RNR [, , ]. Deletions of RB family members increase glutamine uptake
  and conversion to glutamate, mediated through elevated expression of the glutamine
  transporter ASCT2 and GLS1 activity in MEF [] and upregulate enzymes involved in
  elongation, long chain fatty acid family member 6, and desaturation of fatty acids
  by stearoyl‐CoA desaturase 1 []. Cyclin D1 has an E2F1‐independent role in the control
  of oxidative metabolism. It directly modulates the activity of the transcription
  factor NRF1, the mitochondrial voltage‐dependent anion channel [, ], mitochondrial
  electron transport chain components COX and ATP synthase [] thereby inhibiting oxidative
  phosphorylation. In addition, cyclin D1 inhibits HKII and pyruvate kinase (PK),
  which are involved in the glycolysis pathway as well as the lipogenic enzymes acetyl‐CoA
  carboxylase and fatty acid synthase levels []. In adipocytes, cyclin D3‐CDK4 complex
  phosphorylates IRS2 at serine 388, thereby creating a positive feedback loop that
  maintains adipocyte insulin signaling []. In addition, the CDK4 also represses FAO
  in an E2F1‐independent manner through direct phosphorylation and inhibition of AMPKα2.
  Cyclin D3–CDK6 kinase phosphorylates and inhibits the catalytic activity of two
  key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, 6‐phosphofructokinase (isoform PFKP) and
  pyruvate kinase (isoform PKM2) in T‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia []. Interactions
  between the cell cycle machinery and metabolic enzymes indicated by arrows may be
  either direct or indirect. Color codes represent proteins belonging to the cell
  cycle machinery (red) or to metabolic pathways (yellow).
