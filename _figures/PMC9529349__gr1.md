caption: Molecular mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation caused by SARS-CoV-2
  infection and therapeutic targets by P. ginseng-derived substances. The first step
  is priming, the TLRs–adaptor molecule MyD88 pathway, which stimulates pro-IL-1β
  and NLRP3 transcription via NF-kB activation. Stimulation of the caspase-8 protein
  complex by PAMPs or DAMPs can activate NF-kB transcription. The second step is NLRP3
  inflammasome assembly. The cytosolic sensor molecule NLRP3, the adaptor protein
  ASC, and the effector molecule pro-caspase-1 constitute the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  When pro-caspase-1 turns into caspase-1, active caspase-1 leads to the maturation
  of IL-1β and promotes pyroptosis, a type of intrinsic inflammatory cell death. The
  NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia and astrocytes, activated by various external and
  endogenous stimuli, causes IL-1β maturation and pyroptosis. High levels of IL-1β
  bind to receptors of glial cells, neurons, macrophages, and endothelial cells. It
  interacts with other cytokines to activate Th-cell signaling, resulting in the aggravation
  of the inflammatory cascade within the CNS. Therapeutic targets for controlling
  NLRP3 inflammasome may be inhibited by P. ginseng-derived substances (PG); Red marks
  designate therapeutic targets where PG exhibit their regulatory effects. ASC, apoptosis-related
  speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  CARD, caspase activation and recruitment domain; DAMPs, damage-associated molecular
  pattern molecules; GSDMD, gasdermin D; GSDMD-NT, gasdermin-N domain of GSDMD; IL,
