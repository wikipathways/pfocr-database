caption: α4β1 outside-in signalling induced CD25 expression, co-stimulation of CD69
  expression and activation of the MAPK ERK pathway. Unlike TCR signalling, ERK activation
  occurred independently of TCR ESC proteins. In contrast, TCR ESC proteins were required
  for the induction of CD25 and co-stimulation of CD69 by α4β1 outside-in signalling.
  Lck, ZAP-70 and Vav1 were required for CD25 induction and CD69 co-stimulation by
  α4β1 outside-in signalling; however, SLP-76 and LAT were only required for CD69
  co-stimulation.
