caption: Integration of cell wall remodeling and the heat response network. Plant
  perception of heat involves several pathways in different compartments. The cell
  wall is the first protective barrier in plants that is exposed to heat. Heat stress
  (HS)-triggered pectin methylesterases (PME) activity, accompanied by Ca2+ mobilization
  from apoplastic sources, is involved in cell wall remodeling and is crucial for
  plant thermotolerance. During recovery time after HS, PME performs linear demethylesterification
  on highly esterified pectin residues and interacts with Ca2+ to form a pectate gel
  lawn, which causes cell-wall stiffening. During non-lethal HS, acidic PME acts randomly
  on pectin and promotes the action of endo-polygalacturonases (PG) to contribute
  to cell-wall loosening and the release of Ca2+ through Ca2+-permeable channels (green
  oval) in the plasma membrane, thus causing a transient increase in [Ca2+]cyt oscillation.
  This is followed by induction of a Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent pathway to activate
  the master HS regulator HsfA1s, which directly triggers HS-responsive transcription
  factors, including HsfA2, HsfA7s, HsfBs, and dehydration-responsive element-binding
  protein 2A for downstream HsfA3 and HSP gene expression involved in the acquisition
  of thermotolerance. Histone modification and several epigenetic regulators, including
  small RNAs and transposons, are involved in the HSR and HS memory. MicroRNA156 targets
  the SQUAMOSA promoter-binding protein-like gene family, which downregulates HS-inducible
  genes and therefore maintains the expression of HsfA2 and HSP genes during recovery
  from HS for long-term adaptation to HS. The retrotransposon ONSEN, as a target of
  HsfA1s and HsfA2, can be modulated by siRNAs for the regulation of HS memory. Through
  heat-intolerant 4 (HIT4), HS can relax the silencing of transposons, whereas they
  can be silenced by deficient in DNA methylation 1 (DDM1) and Morpheus’ molecule
  1 (MOM1). However, the HS-induced cell wall-related transcript profile needs to
  be further explored with regard to the maintenance and modification of cell wall
  integrity.

  description: Integration of cell wall remodeling and the heat response network.
    Plant perception of heat involves several pathways in different compartments.
    The cell wall is the first protective barrier in plants that is exposed to heat.
