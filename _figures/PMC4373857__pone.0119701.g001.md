caption: 'A CoA-independent, non-β-oxidative pathway of L-phenylalanine side chain-shortening
  is shown in blue, whereas a CoA-dependent, β-oxidative route is shown in purple.
  Benzaldehyde, benzoic acid and/or benzoyl-CoA undergo condensation with pyruvate,
  a reaction putatively catalyzed by a ThDP-dependent carboligase. 1-Phenylpropane-1,2-dione
  undergoes transamination to yield (S)-cathinone, which is reduced to cathine and
  (1R,2S)-norephedrine. N-Methylation is restricted to Ephedra spp. and does not occur
  in khat. Activity has been detected for enzymes highlighted in yellow, and corresponding
  genes are available for enzymes highlighted in green. Enzymes highlighted in red
  have not been isolated, although database mining revealed numerous potential candidates
  (Tables  and ). Abbreviations: CoA, Coenzyme A; NAD(H), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;
  NADP(H), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; ThDP, thiamine diphosphate.'
