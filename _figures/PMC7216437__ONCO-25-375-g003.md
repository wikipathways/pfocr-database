caption: ATM functions in DNA damage repair pathway. Specific types of DNA damage
  result in the activation of specific DNA repair signaling pathway. Single‐strand
  break (SSB) is mainly repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which
  needs PARP that recognizes and binds to sites of SSB. Then, PARP catalyzes poly(ADP)
  ribosylation of itself and recruit DNA repair proteins such as DNA polymerase β
  (POLB), DNA ligase III, and scaffolding proteins such as X‐ray cross‐complementing
  protein 1 (XRCC1). In the case of double‐strand break (DSB), homologous recombination
  (HR) plays a crucial role. The H2AX and MRN complex recognize the DSB and recruits
  ATM and ATR, which can eventually induce cell cycle arrest through p53. Subsequently,
  ATM can cause the recruitment of BRCA1/2 and PALB2, which determine the RAD51 loading
  and the subsequent DNA synthesis. In addition, PARP plays a role in activating ATM
  necessary for HR. When PARP action is inhibited by the PARPi, SSB is converted to
  DSB at replication. In cells with functional HR pathway, the DSB will be repaired.
  In cells with a dysfunctional HR pathway, as is the case with BRCA1/2 and ATM, the
  lesions go unrepaired and cell death ensues.
