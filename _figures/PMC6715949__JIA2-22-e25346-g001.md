caption: Mucosal innate immune responses to STIs in the female genital tract that
  could potentiate HIV transmission risk. Depicted are several of the modes through
  which STIs might increase the risk of HIV acquisition. Infection with STIs results
  to physical abrasion, ulcer formation and increase of pro‐inflammatory cytokines
  resulting in inflammation. Inflammation increases the availability of HIV target
  cells in the sub‐mucosa. During N. gonorrhoeae infection, TLR2 and 4 detect lipooligosaccharide
  and induce a NF‐KB driven immune response resulting to production of cytokines.
  Infection with C. trachomatis results in death of some cells which in turn produce
  elementary bodies. C. trachomatis infection is detected by inflammasomes resulting
  to production of IL‐1b and IL‐8 through the NLR3 pathway. TLR9 detects the CpG island
  in Genomic material of the HPV virus inducing an immune response through the MYD88
  pathway. TLR3 detects the viral nucleic acid to induce an immune response through
  the IRF and IR7 pathways.
