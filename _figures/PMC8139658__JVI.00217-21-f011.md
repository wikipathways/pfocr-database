caption: Model of SERCA modulates autophagic, inflammatory, and mitochondrial responses
  during influenza A virus infection in human lung cells. SERCA-regulated autophagic
  flux, the inflammatory response, and mitochondria function are shown. Influenza
  A virus induced the blocking of autophagic flux, aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction,
  and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by upregulating
  the MAPK-JNK pathway through SERCA activity inhibition.
