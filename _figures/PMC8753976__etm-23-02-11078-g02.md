caption: Role of exosomes in the pathogenesis of DCM. BM-MSCs-Exo carry molecular
  targeting proteases, such as plasmin, MMP-2 and MMP-9, which activate the TGF-β1/Smad2/3
  signaling pathway, thereby promoting cardiac muscle fibrosis. miR-204 carried by
  islet cells-Exo inhibits the expression of iSIRT1, aggravating myocardial energy
  mechanism disorders. ADSC-Exos activate the key promoters of the cardiomyocyte apoptosis
  pathway, caspase12 and CHOP, by targeting GRP78, inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
  miR-320 carried by CDM-Exos inhibits IGF1, Hsp20 and Ets2, inhibiting cardiac endothelial
  cell migration and blood vessel formation. EC-Exos release Mst1, inducing cardiomyocyte
  apoptosis. DCM, diabetic cardiomyopathy; BM-MSCs-Exo, exosomes derived from bone
  marrow mesenchymal stem cells; ADSC, adipose-derived stem cells; iSIRT1, insulin
  receptor substrate 1; miR, microRNA; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; Hsp, heat
  shock protein; CHOP, C/EBP-homologous protein; CRP78, 78-kD glucose-regulated protein;
  CDM, cardiomyocyte; Ets2, E26 transformation-specific proto-oncogene 2; Mst1, mammalian
  ste20-like kinase-1; EC, endothelial cell.
