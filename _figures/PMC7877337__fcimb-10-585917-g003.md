caption: Virulence factors and related effects in P. gingivalis OMVs. (1) P. gingivalis
  OMVs can be internalized into cells by an actin-mediated pathway that utilizes host
  receptors, especially α5β1-integrin, which is controlled by PI3K and depends on
  caveolin, dynamin, and Rac1. (2) P. gingivalis OMVs can be internalized into cells
  through the fimbria-dependent lipid raft pathway, which is dependent on PI3K and
  Rac1, and involves various regulatory GTPases. (3) P. gingivalis OMVs can exert
  virulence by affecting different receptors on the host cell surface, such as activating
  PRR receptors and degrading TfR receptors. (4–6) P. gingivalis OMVs can activate
  or degrade a variety of biologically active substances in host cells, inhibit cell
  proliferation, promote glycolysis, apoptosis, and cause host cells to produce a
  variety of inflammatory factors thereby promoting the formation of an inflammatory
  environment.
