caption: Relationship between individual genes composing the ‘blood vessel development’
  ontology group. Diagram is based on searches of scientific article databases, experimental
  data, and data concerning gene expression and gene location. The thickness of the
  lines in the graph reflects the degree of gene co-expression as presented in the
  summaries of scientific publications
papertitle: Vascular restenosis in coronary artery bypass grafting might be associated
  with VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling pathway.
