caption: 'Cells of innate immunity and network of mediators in OA synovitis. Synovitis
  in osteoarthritis is mainly driven by the activation of innate immunity. This activation
  is triggered by proinflammatory factors released following the loss of cellular
  homeostasis. Each type of immunocompetent cell releases mediators to promote/counteract
  low-grade inflammation. Eosinophils and M2 macrophages exert an anti-inflammatory
  activity under the modulation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and the release
  of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13). Thus, boosting these immune
  cells and the release of their mediators could be useful to re-establish cellular
  homeostasis and counteract synovitis. In contrast, M1 macrophages, NK cells, DCs,
  neutrophils, and MCs actively fuel the vicious cycle that keeps low-grade inflammation
  and synovitis alive, leading to OA progression. The release of proinflammatory mediators
  (such as IL-1, TNF-α, and ROS) following immune cell activation leads to worsening
  of synovitis features, cartilage degradation, and bone remodeling. Furthermore,
  the chemotactic activity of these molecules attracts more immunocompetent cells
  from the bloodstream, thus corroborating the proinflammatory milieu. Abbreviations:
