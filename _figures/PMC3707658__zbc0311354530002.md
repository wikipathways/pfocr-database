caption: Experimental GDP-6-deoxy-l-gluco-heptose synthesis pathway. This experimental
  pathway was obtained using the surrogate 6-deoxy derivative generated by the C4/C6
  dehydratase from the 6-deoxy-d-altro-heptose synthesis pathway DdahA. The pathway
  results from the combination of the CE, MS, and NMR spectroscopy analyses described
  in these studies.
