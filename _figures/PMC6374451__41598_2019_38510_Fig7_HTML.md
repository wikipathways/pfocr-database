caption: Schematic overview of DNA demethylation during glioma progression. (a) Somatic
  mutations, CNAs, genomic fusion, and demethylation in the promoter and enhancer
  of RB, PI3K-AKT or MAPK pathway genes upregulate cell cycle and cell growth-related
  genes, which accelerate cell division and lead to passive demethylation preferentially
  in late-replicating regions. Upregulated genes by the demethylation such as IGF2BP3
  further accelerates cell division. (b) When DNA replicates, the methylation pattern
  is maintained by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) by copying it to daughter strands.
  However, in vigorously dividing cells, passive demethylation may occur at late-replicating
  regions due delayed maintenance of methylation.
