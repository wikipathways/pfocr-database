caption: YAP/TAZ mediated pathway through mechano-transduction. A cell probes its
  ECM mechanical environment via membrane receptors (e.g. integrins) to transmit force
  which regulates the stability of focal adhesion complexes containing focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK). FAK phosphorylates and activates mechanoresponsive signalling elements,
  such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and transforming protein Ras homolog
  gene family member A (RHOA). Simultaneously, the intracellular force regulates the
  nuclear translocation of transcription regulator such as yes-associated protein
  (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ).
