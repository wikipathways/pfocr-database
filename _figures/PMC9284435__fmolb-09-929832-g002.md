caption: Association of ferroptosis-associated genes with metastasis or recurrence
  of endometrial cancer. ASSP2 and p190A inhibit migration of endometrial cancer via
  inactivating the Hippo–YAP signaling pathway. YAP promotes the expression of SLC7A11
  directly or through inhibiting ATF4 degradation. YAP also promotes the increase
  of IL-6, IL-1, IRS1, and GAB2, which may inhibit lipid peroxidation to promote invasion
  or migration. TGFβ1 promotes the expression of FSP1, which inhibit lipid peroxidation
  to promote invasion or migration. After Nrf2 dissociated from KEAP1, activated Nrf2
  inhibits lipid peroxidation to promote invasion or migration. p53 enhances the expression
  of CDKN1A to promote lipid peroxidation. MGST1, FANCD2, and DDP4 may promote invasion
  or migration through inhibiting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. HOMX1 may restrain
  invasion or migration through promoting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Moreover,
  increased ubiquitinated degradation of p53 results in the decreased expression of
  CDKN1A, which results in reduced ferroptosis and enhanced recurrence. FANCD2 and
  YAP may promote recurrence through inhibiting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.
  BAP1 may prevent recurrence through promoting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.
  P in the graph represents phosphorylation.
