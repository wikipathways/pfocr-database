caption: Model depicting an indirect pathway linking expression of activated Notch
  (NotchIC) with the inhibition of E2A. NotchIC has been shown to activate the pre-Tα
  promoter through association with the CSL transcription factor, and thus may induce
  aberrantly high levels of the pre-TCR complex (). Signaling through the antigen
  receptor complex in thymocytes acts to inhibit E2A activity, at least in part through
  the induction of Id3 transcription by a Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK)-dependent
  pathway that activates the early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) ().
