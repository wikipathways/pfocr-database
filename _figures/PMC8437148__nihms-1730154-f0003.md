caption: (a) Current engineered receptor designs are largely restricted to a specific
  set of cell and tissue types. For example, RASSLs are most often used in neural
  cells, CARs in T cells, and SynNotch receptors in both T cells and a variety of
  epithelial cells. (b) Existing engineered receptors could be employed in new cell
  and tissue types. For example, RASSLs could be used to activate G protein-coupled
  receptor pathways in cells of the hematopoietic lineage, such as blood cells. Neural
  cells could be engineered to sense extracellular ligands recognized by existing
  MESAs but not existing RASSLs, then provide a specified transcriptional output.
  (c) Various engineered receptors can be combined to provide novel functions, a concept
  that has already been used to combine CARs with SynNotch receptors []. For example,
  a T cell could be engineered with a SynNotch receptor that binds a highly expressed
  cell surface marker on cancer cells, triggering proteolytic cleavage of a transcription
  factor (TF). This TF could then localize to the nucleus and activate transcription
  of the arrestin-TEV protease involved in the Tango assay. Then, only in the simultaneous
  presence of an extracellular ligand as well as expression of the arrestin-TEV protease,
  a second TF could be released. This would effectively create and AND-gate requiring
  both the proximal recognition of a cancer cell marker as well as the presence of
  an extracellular ligand. (d) Novel fusion receptors could be developed to perform
  unique functions. For example, one could imagine a chimeric RASSL-GPCR, where the
  extracellular domain of the RASSL allows it to be activated by its pharmacologically
  inert agonist while the intracellular domain of the GPCR allows activation of a
  GPCR pathway not typically coupled to the RASSL. This could be used to potentially
  control stem cell differentiation, or even allow one neurotransmitter to activate
  a neuronal pathway that it does not natively activate. Another possible chimeric
  receptor could involve the fusion of a MESA extracellular recognition domain to
  the intracellular signaling or costimulatory domains of CARs in T cells. Thus, rather
  than recognizing a tumor cell surface antigen, the receptor could instead recognize
  an extracellular ligand that in turn leads to T cell activation.
