caption: (a) Elucidation of cancer targeting mechanisms of ligand-modified NPs. IL-13
  peptide modification increases glioma distribution, selectively elevates internalization
  by glioma cells rather than macrophages and microvessels, and changes the dominant
  internalization pathway from macropinocytosis to receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent
  endocytosis. The photos and images shown were produced by Dr Huile Gao. (b) IL-13Rα2
  expression in various cells including U87, Raw246.7, HUVEC (human umbilical vein
  endothelial cells), bEnd.3 (cell line used as brain microvessel endothelial cells),
  A549 (human non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell line) and C6 (rat glioma cell line).
