caption: Simplified scheme of innate immune recognition mediated by PRRs. TLR2/TLR1,
  TLR2/TLR6 heterodimers, and TLR2 homodimer are controlled mainly by the MyD88-dependent
  signaling pathway and/or the TRIF-dependent signaling pathway using sorting adaptors
  TIRAP/Mal and TRAM. MyD88 recruits IRAK4, IRAK1, IRAK2 and TRAF6 and induces inflammatory
  responses by activating NF-κB, MAPK, and IRF5. TRIF recruits TRAF6 and TRAF3, which
  leads to activation of MAPK and NF-κB. The signals from cell surface PRRs control
  the ultimate fate of the cell and production of intercellular signals inducing inflammatory
  response to infection. A different set of PRRs and amplification mechanisms operate
  in detecting bacteria inside the cytosol. Bacterial small nucleic acids secreted
  into the cytosol and bacterial mRNA are recognized by RNA-sensing RIG-1 or DNA-sensing
  Aim2 and NLRP3. Such structural components of bacteria as, for example, flagellin
  or peptidoglycan are recognized by NLRC4 and NOD1/2 receptors, respectively. Recognition
  of intracytosolic bacterial nucleic acids activates inflammasome(s) through the
  adaptor molecule ASC, which leads, in turn, to activation of caspase 1 and production
  of IL-1 beta (IL-1β) and IL18.
