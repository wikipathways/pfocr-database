caption: Conserved relationships between TORC1, RNA Polymerase III and lifespan. The
  growth-promoting, anabolic functions mediated by Pol III activation represent at
  least one mechanism downstream of TORC1 that shortens adult health and survival
  (). The “Odd Pols” Pol I and Pol III have also been implicated in disease states
  (; ). TORC1 also controls the translational regulators S6 Kinase and 4E-BP1 as well
  as the autophagy regulators ATG1 and ULK1 (), and the H3 H4 Axis (). NB Histones
  H3/H4 regulate expression of an autophagy cargo adaptor Bchs (WDFY3 in mammals).
  Pol III is also regulated by MYC (as are Pol I and Pol II) which has also been implicated
  in the TORC1 pathway and in ageing (; ; ; ). This figure focuses on work in the
  worm, fly and mouse. Studies in these three model systems demonstrate that all of
  these TORC1 outputs can affect lifespan, as summarised here. As the structure and
  biochemical function of Pol III is well studied, it is possible to design inhibitors
  that may provide therapeutic effects (; ).
