caption: '(A) Role of TRIMs in the control of p53 tumor-suppressor protein. TRIM proteins
  modulate the tumor suppressive activity of p53 e.g., in response to irradiation
  (IR) or genotoxic drugs via diverse mechanisms. P53 antagonizing TRIM proteins (red)
  can either directly interact with p53 and thereby promote p53 ubiquitination and
  proteasomal degradation or indirectly, via facilitating the association with the
  ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 which targets p53 for proteasomal degradation. Alternatively,
  the p53 negative regulatory TRIM25 interferes with the transactivation potential
  of p53 and consequently with the transcription of p53 controlled genes due to an
  impaired formation of a ternary p53 activation complex of p53, Mdm2, and p300 which
  is critical for p53 acetylation (Ac). Instead, the p53 inhibitory TRIM29 upon p300
  dependent acetylation binds to p53 and enhances the sequestration of p53 in the
  cytoplasm thereby preventing p53-triggered transcription of p53 target genes relevant
  for tumor suppression. By contrast, some TRIMs promote stabilization of p53 either
  though directly binding to Mdm2 thereby preventing p53 proteasomal degradation (TRIM67)
  or by preventing the formation of a ternary complex of p53, Mdm2, and p300 which
