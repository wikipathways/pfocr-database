caption: Reactive oxygen species/hydrogen peroxide promotes zebrafish heart regeneration
  via a de‐repression mechanism involving the Dusp6. Upon injury, growth factor signaling
  activates the Ras/MAPK pathway. The activation, via phosphorylation, of Mek1/2 and
  Erk1/2 induces expression of dusp6. Dusp6 in turn dephosphorylates ERK1/2, thus
  de‐activating the FGF/Ras/MAPK pathway, which is necessary for heart regeneration.
  However, injury also stimulates H2O2 production close to the site of injury site
  via the activation of Duox and Nox2. The elevated levels of H2O2 reversibly inhibits
  the Dusp6 phosphatase via the oxidation of its catalytic cysteine, thus sustaining
  Ras/MAPK activation. Thus, the production of H2O2 promotes heart regeneration by
  a de‐repression mechanism. DPI and apocynin are inhibitors of Duox/Nox2. Catalase
  is an enzyme that destroys H2O2. CI is an inhibitor of Dusp6. U0126 is an inhibitor
  of Mek1/2. Adapted from Han et al
