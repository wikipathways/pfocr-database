caption: ATM regulates mTORC1 activity through AMPK in response to elevated ROS levels.
  Elevated ROS levels activate ATM, which in turn phosphorylates and activates LKB1
  at Thr366, which then phosphorylates and activates AMPK at Thr172 []. AMPK is also
  activated by IGF-1 [] and the AMPK activator AICAR [] in an ATM-dependent and LKB1-independent
  manner. AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 at multiple sites, which results in TCS2 activation,
  and then active TCS2 inhibits mTORC1 activity []. In addition, ATM directly phosphorylates
  HIF-1α (one of the subunits of HIF-1), which also promotes TSC2 activity and therefore
  blocks mTORC1 []. Moreover, mTORC1 promotes the expression of HIF-1 [] and, as part
  of the larger mTOR complex, regulates cellular growth and protein synthesis. Inhibition
  of mTORC1 activity by TSC2 induces autophagy, a catabolic process that functions
  as a cellular salvaging pathway during periods of reduced energy supplies within
  the cell. Autophagy also functions as a tumor suppression pathway by inhibiting
  cellular growth. Unregulated mTORC1 activity might lead to cancer by promoting excessive
  cellular growth and cell division. In addition, high levels of mTORC1 activity result
  in increased ROS production in mitochondria by increasing oxidative metabolism through
  expression of the mitochondrial transcriptional regulator PGC-1α and other mechanisms
  [, ]. Therefore, ATM activation by the excess ROS generated by high mTORC1 activity
  may function as a feedback mechanism to regulate mTORC1 activity.
