caption: In normal conditions, the protein levels of RGS4 are maintained in low concentrations
  in the neuronal cells by the Arg/N-end rule pathway, which facilitate various signal
  transductions mediated by GPCR. Moreover, the Arg/N-end rule pathway appears to
  have a neuroprotective role in neurons for the clearance of various proteotoxic
  C-terminal protein fragments implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. When the
  Arg/N-end rule pathway is genetically or chemically inhibited, RGS4 levels are elevated
  to hydrolyze GTP of G protein's α subunit, which results in inactivation of GPCR
  signaling.
