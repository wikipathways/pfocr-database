caption: 'PAK4 signaling pathways. PAK4 promotes cellular proliferation (top). PAK4
  regulates cell mitosis to facilitate proliferation by phosphorylating Ran and activating
  the LIMK1/cofilin–1 pathway. PAK4 improves the binding of Mdm2 with P53 to facilitate
  the ubiquitination and degradation of P53 and increases G6PD activity. Furthermore,
  PAK4 promotes ubiquitination degradation of P57 kip2 and P21 degradation. PAK4 and
  ERα activate each other, thus forming a positive feedback loop to upregulate the
  expression of CyclinD1. PAK4 activates the c-Src/EGFR pathway and upregulates the
  expressions of CyclinD1 and CDC25A. In addition, PAK4 phosphorylates β-catenin and
  enhances its nuclear import. Endonuclear β-catenin and TCF/LEF work jointly to upregulate
  the expressions of c-myc and CyclinD1. PAK4 promotes cellular metastasis (right).
  PAK4 interacts with DGCR6L to improve the phosphorylation level of LIMK1 and cofilin.
  PAK4 facilitates metastasis by activating CEBPB/CLDN4 and PI3K/Akt pathways, inhibiting
  P53, activating SCG10 and N–WASP, and inhibiting RhoA exchange activity mediated
  by GEF–H1 in a kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, PAK4 protects RhoU from ubiquitination
  while binding to and activating eEF1A1 in a kinase-independent manner. PAK4 phosphorylates
  the integrin β5 subunit while inhibiting the activity of integrin. The connection
  between integrin and VN activates PAK4, thus regulating the cell movement through
  the negative feedback loop. PAK4 phosphorylates paxillin and facilitates the decomposition
  of adhesive spots. Induced by activated CDC42, PAK4 induces filamentous pseudopodia
  formation. Moreover, PAK4 inhibits pseudopodia maturation mediated by PDZ-RhoGEF.
  PAK4 promotes drug resistance and regulates cellular aging (bottom right). Phosphorylation
  of Bad by PAK4 endows tumors with Gem resistance. Meanwhile, CDDP resistance is
  imparted via PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways. In addition, PAK4 inhibits the senescence-like
  growth arrest of cells mediated by the RELB-C/EBPβ pathway. PAK4 mediates cell senescence
  by activating the MEK/ERK pathway and the P16 INK4/P19 ARF. PAK4 inhibits cellular
  apoptosis (bottom). PAK4 inhibits the activity of Bad by phosphorylation. It can
  prevent the release of cytochrome C in mitochondria and inhibit the activation of
  caspase–9/Caspase–3. In addition, PAK4 can inhibit apoptosis by inhibiting caspase–8.
  PAK4 facilitates the binding of TRADD to TNFR1 while inhibiting apoptosis under
  TNF-α inducement and NF-κB mediation. Moreover, PAK4 activates both PI3K/Akt and
  MEK/ERK pathways, thus having an effect on NF-κB so as to inhibit apoptosis. PAK4
  promotes oncogenic transformation (bottom left). PAK4 interacts with Smad2/3 in
  a kinase-independent manner to block TGF-β induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Besides,
  PAK4 phosphorylates Smad2 in response to HGF, thus mediating the ubiquitination
  of Smad2. PAK4 upregulates FoxC2 expression and downregulates ParvB expression.
  PAK4 inhibits antitumor immunity (left). PAK4 induces the expressions of ZEB1 and
  SLUG, thus inhibiting the expressions of Claudin–14 and ICAM–1/VCAM–1, respectively.
  PAK4 upregulates the expression of PD–L1 via the β-catenin pathway. Activation and
  inhibition of proteins are indicated by arrows and blocked lines, respectively.
