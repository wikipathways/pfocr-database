caption: Proposed model of HER2/3 signaling in epithelial cells. Injurious stimuli,
  including IL-1β, induce protease-mediated ligand shedding, which is followed by
  autocrine or paracrine epithelial HER receptor activation. This induces activation
  of intracellular signaling pathways, including TGF-β and Rac, with subsequent modulation
  of tight junction and adherens junction proteins and regulation of epithelial cell–cell
  adhesion. IL-1β activation of HER2/3 through shedding ADAM17-induced shedding of
  neuregulin (NRG)-1 serves as a prototypical pathway.
