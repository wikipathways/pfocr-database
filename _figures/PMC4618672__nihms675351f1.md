caption: Key signaling cascades in HCC. The MAPK pathway is stimulated by growth factors
  (GFs), such as VEGF, that activate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), followed by Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
  activation. The genes linked to this pathway lead to further expression of GF production.
  GFs in setting have both autocrine and paracrine functions. Stimulation of RTK also
  activates the PI3K-Akt-mTOR cascade which eventually leads to hypoxia inducible
  factors (HIF-α). Wnt activates the frizzle trans-membrane receptor leading to dishevelled
  (Dsh) to the membrane allowing β-catenin to accumulate in the cytosol and eventually
  the nucleus. Once in the nucleus β-catenin interacts with transcription factors
  and facilitates tumorigenesis.
