caption: CO prevents inflammatory responses via inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway.
  (a) Inflammatory stimuli such as TNF-α and LPS lead to activation of ECs, which
  in turn activate inflammatory signaling cascades. The association between TLR4 and
  MyD88 inhibits IκB kinase activity, leading to NF-κB activation via p65/p50 nuclear
  translocation in TNF-α-stimulated ECs. CO significantly reduces TNF-α-induced Nox-mediated
  ROS generation, NF-κB activation and the expression of adhesion molecules such as
  ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and selectins. (b) Inflammatory stimuli induce (i) the recruitment
  of monocytes to the endothelium, thereby promoting their transmigration into the
  arterial intima, (ii) ECs apoptosis and (iii) VSMC proliferation. CO diminishes
  this inflammatory activation by reducing the expression of adhesion molecules, stimulating
  EC survival and inhibiting VSMC proliferation.
