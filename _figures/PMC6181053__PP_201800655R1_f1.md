caption: Biosynthetic pathway of DCA and related meroterpenoids in R. dauricum. DCA
  synthase is an FAD oxidase that catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of grifolic
  acid (GFA) to produce DCA. Two DCA analogs, cannabichromeorcinic acid and diterpenodaurichromenic
  acid, also are produced by DCA synthase. The proposed aromatic PT would catalyze
  the prenylation of OSA at its C-3 position using three different prenyl donor substrates,
  farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), geranyl diphosphate (GPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  (GGPP), to produce GFA and its prenyl analogs as the substrates for DCA synthase.
  Thick arrows indicate the main metabolic route leading to DCA as the major constituent.
  aThe absolute configuration of these DCA analogs was not determined ().
