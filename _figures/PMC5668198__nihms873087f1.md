caption: Microglial derived signals determine NSC survival and differentiation in
  EAE. Conversely, NSC derived signals cause immunomodulation in microglia via paracrine
  factors and signaling pathways. Resting microglia stimulated by IL-4 in vitro, promotes
  Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mediated oligodendrogenesis from adult NPCs
  in mice []. On the other hand, microglia-derived tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)
  induced the expression of the BH3 (Bcl-2 homology domain-3) in NPCs by an NF-k B
  (nuclear factor- kB)-dependent mechanism and, increases NPC apoptosis by a mitochondrial
  pathway []. Soluble factors released from mouse microglial cells direct the migration
  of NPCs in vitro and in vivo []. In the EAE brain, microglia produce stromal cell-derived
  factor-1 (SDF-1), monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and hepatocyte growth
  factor (HGF), responsible for the inflammation-induced attraction of transplanted
  NPCs into white matter lesions []. In an allogeneic co-culture model, both human
  NPCs and microglia showed increased survival and proliferation, and the release
  of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) was also upregulated. NSCs can induce a
  significant up-regulation of the surface molecules CX3CR1 on microglia which is
  associated with a neuroprotective phenotype, and triggering receptor expressed on
  myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) [, , , ].
