caption: The classical and basic view of transforming growth factor β signaling pathway
  during liver regeneration. Generally speaking, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)
  superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor (RII), which recruits and phosphorylates
  a RI. The RI then phosphorylates receptor-regulated Smads. Then complexes accumulate
  in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation
  of target gene expression.
