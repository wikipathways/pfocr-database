caption: Schematic representation of proposed metabolic pathways for the preservation
  in comparison between the cold storage (CS) method and high-pressure gas (HPG) method.
  The CS preservation method is characterized by lactic acid production, a by-product
  of anaerobic metabolism, the polyol pathway that causes oxidative stress, and anaplerotic
  utilization of glutaminolysis. Conversely, the HPG preservation method is characterized
  by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and a shift in glucose metabolism toward
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). PPP acceleration increases cellular reduced
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) amounts, providing reduced glutathione
  (GSH) that benefits reducing oxidative stress.
