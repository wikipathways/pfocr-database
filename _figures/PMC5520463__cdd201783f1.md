caption: The serine synthesis pathway (SSP) diverges from glycolysis utilising the
  intermediate 3P-glycerate, which is converted by PHGDH, PSAT-1, and PSPH into serine
  and then glycine. Removal of exogenous serine and glycine causes activation of SSP,
  however Vousden’s study demonstrates that tumours, such as Eμ-Myc- and ApcMin/+-driven
  lymphomas and intestinal lesions can be susceptible to serine and glycine (SG) deprivation.
  Concurrent SG dietary restriction and biguanide administration might improve anti-tumour
  effects when associated with a reduction in antioxidant defence. On contrary, Kras-driven
  pancreatic tumours appear resistant to SG-free diet as observed from the ability
  of Kras to promote expression of PHGDH, PSAT-1, and PSPH and thus boost activity
  of SSP. This figure is re-adapted from Amelio and Melino
