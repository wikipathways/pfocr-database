caption: Diagram of norrin as a multifunctional ligand for three receptors/binding
  proteins. Norrin binds to LGR4, which is also the receptor for R-spondin proteins.
  LGR4 presumably cooperates with Frizzled (Fzl) receptors activated by Wnt ligands
  to promote the internalization of LRP5/6, leading to increases in β-catenin levels
  and the expression of downstream Wnt pathway genes. Norrin also interacts directly
  with Fzl4 and an auxiliary membrane protein Tspan12 to promote LRP5/6 internalization
  and to increase β-catenin levels. In addition, norrin binds to BMP2/4 to block the
  activation of type I and II BMP receptors, leading to decreases in downstream Smad
  activities. Mutations in humans associated with Norrie disease result in diverse
  phenotypes probably because of differential activation of Wnt signaling mediated
  by LGR4 or Fzl4 as well as differential BMP antagonistic activities.
