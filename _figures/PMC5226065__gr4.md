caption: Mechanisms underlying SQ induced self-renewal. (a) Graph (inset) shows in
  cell western results for total ERK 1/2 for SQ (red) and flat (blue) across 0, 1,
  4 and 24 h. ERK 1/2 was consistently lower on SQ when compared to the control (significantly
  at t = 0), and decreased progressively when moving through the cell cycle. ***p
  < 0.001, t-test. RNAseq analysis generated a network in IPA that links ERK 1/2 and
  adhesion-based signalling on SQ 24 h following release into the cycle after synchronisation.
  ERK 1/2 was also indicated to be down-regulated here. (b) Several genes associated
  with cell cycle progression (CDK1 (cdc2), cyclin B, cyclin D1) and those related
  to cycle repression (p18INK4C, p19INK4D and p21cip1) were up-regulated (green) on
  in cells on SQ (arrows point to all named genes). (c) Canonical pathway analysis
  underlines differential regulation of cell cycle (denoted as *) and adhesion (denoted
  as §) in cells on the SQ topography compared to those on control. A general trend
  of down-regulation can be observed across the majority of signalling groups for
  cells on on SQ. Note that only pathways with p < 0.05 are shown. A two-fold change
  cut-off was applied for RNAseq data (n = 3). (For interpretation of the references
  to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
  article.)
