caption: 'A, Hepatic BCAA metabolism. BCAAs induce: excess formation of alanine, which
  serves as a substrate for gluconeogenesis, contributing to hyperglycemia; excess
  formation of α-ketoacids, leading to increased levels of C5 and C3 acylcarnitine
  levels and subsequently excess formation of malonyl-CoA, which inhibits β-oxidation;
  hepatic lipid droplet formation and steatosis; activation of mTOR and its downstream
  target S6K, which contributes to serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and hepatic IR,
  which in turn promotes hyperinsulinemia and influences substrate deposition into
  fat; and export of free fatty acids, which leads to VLDL formation and muscle IR.
  α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; BCKA, branched-chain keto acid; pSer-IRS-1, serine phosphorylated
  IRS-1; S6K, S6 kinase. B, Hepatic ethanol metabolism. Ethanol induces: DNL and dyslipidemia;
  JNK-1 activation, which serine phosphorylates hepatic IRS-1, rendering it inactive,
  and contributing to hepatic IR, which promotes hyperinsulinemia and influences substrate
  deposition into fat; hepatic lipid droplet formation, leading to steatosis; and
  stimulation of the reward pathway, promoting continuous consumption. (Reproduced
  from Lustig.) ACC, acetyl CoA carboxylase; ACL, adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase;
  FAS, fatty acid synthase; MTP, microsomal transfer protein. C, Hepatic fructose
  metabolism. Fructose induces substrate-dependent phosphate depletion, which increases
  uric acid and contributes to hypertension through inhibition of endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase and reduction of NO; DNL and dyslipidemia; hepatic lipid droplet
  formation and steatosis; muscle IR; JNK-1 activation, contributing to hepatic IR,
  which promotes hyperinsulinemia and influences substrate deposition into fat; and
  CNS hyperinsulinemia, which antagonizes central leptin signaling and promotes continued
  energy intake. (Reproduced from Lustig.) ACC, acetyl CoA carboxylase; ACL, adenosine
