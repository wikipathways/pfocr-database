caption: Representation of the proposed cellular pathways involved in the acetylcholine
  (ACh)-induced proliferation of human tendon cells. ACh stimulates membrane-bound
  muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChR) that in turn activate matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMP) to cleave a cell-surface-associated epidermal growth factor receptor ligand
  (EGFR ligand). The ligand then binds to EGFR, which in turn increases cell proliferation
  through the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). The results of the present study identify a potential
  role for each of these steps (see Figs. , ). Artwork by G. Andersson
