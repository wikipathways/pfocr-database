caption: Isolation of vhp-1 suppressors. In wild-type animals, the VHP-1 phosphatase
  restrains activation of the JNK MAPK cascade to normal levels. In vhp-1 mutants,
  the hyper-activation of the JNK cascades causes larval arrest and death. Downregulation
  by RNAi of any of the components of the JNK pathway, for example mlk-1, or a factor
  that positively regulates the activity of the JNK signaling is sufficient to suppress
  mutant vhp-1 lethality. The novel genes discovered by this screen were named svh
  (suppressor of vhp-1 lethality).
