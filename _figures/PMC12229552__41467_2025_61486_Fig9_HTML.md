caption: In degenerated NP cells, upregulated EZH2 enhances the methylation of lysine
  234 in DDX1. Methylated DDX1 interacts less with MATR3, leading to reduced enrichment
  of splicing factors at splicing sites and consequently promoting the generation
  of MATR3-S through exon 14 skipping. MATR3-S promotes excessive opening of chromatin
  accessibility, thereby aberrantly activating Wnt signaling pathways to promote NP
  cells aging and apoptosis. Additionally, a strategy based on cationic LNPs for delivering
  mRNA cargo overexpressing MATR3-L effectively alleviates the progression of IVDD
