caption: 'Comparative analysis of transcript and protein abundance in the HSP60-HSP70-TLR2/4
  signaling pathway in children with severe malarial anemia. MetaCore™ was employed
  to illustrate genes with their respective protein products in a cohort of 35 children
  (non-SMA, n = 19; SMA, n = 16) for whom both RNA and protein data were available.
  Pathway maps were created without applying thresholds to view all transcript and
  protein relationships. The transcriptome data mapped to 54/54 nodes (Padj = 9.041
  × 10−13), while the proteome data mapped to 30/54 nodes (Padj = 7.413 × 10−10),
  illustrating the strong biological relationship between the transcriptome and proteome
  data in the pathway. The lack of a protein match for some of the nodes was because
  12 of the proteins were not in the SomaScan array. The details of symbols used in
  these figures are available at the following site: https://portal.genego.com/legends/MetaCoreQuickReferenceGuide.pdf
