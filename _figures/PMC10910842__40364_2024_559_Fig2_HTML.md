caption: 'The roles of the kinesin-2, 3, 4 family members in HCC. (A) Kinesin-2 family:
  KIF3B may influence tumor cells proliferation and apoptosis via an effect on Akt
  signaling pathway. (B) Kinesin-3 family: Tumor promotion: a positive feedback loop
  has been described between KIF14 and ETS1 in Akt signaling transduction. Transcription
  factor ETS1 up-regulates KIF14 expression, and KIF14 promotes tumor development
  by stimulating Akt signaling, which subsequently activates ETS1 to further magnify
  this effect. Both sorafenib treatment, KIF14 interference, and transcriptional suppression
  by Sox17 can disrupt the cycle by inhibiting KIF14 expression. Moreover, the tumor
  promotion mediated by KIF14 may also be correlated with post-translational modification
  (ubiquitination) of p27Kip1. Tumor suppression: the single nucleotide polymorphism
  (SNP) of KIF1B (represented by rs17401966) has been reported to protect against
  HCC. (C) Kinesin-4 family: KIF4A protects tumor cells from apoptosis by stimulating
  PI3K/Akt signaling, and both FOXM1c and hepatitis B virus (HBV) can positively regulate
  KIF4A expression at the transcriptional level. And two underlying associations:
  KIF4A and p53 signaling, KIF21B and tumor cell proliferation and survival, remain
  to be further investigated'
