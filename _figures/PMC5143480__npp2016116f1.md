caption: Contributing factors to suicidal behavior etiology. Genetic factors can predispose
  individuals to behavioral traits that predispose them to exhibit suicidal behavior.
  Proximal factors with an underlying immune component can induce a sustained immune
  response, which, then, is known to modulate a variety of downstream effectors including
  modifying monoamine metabolism, increasing tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine
  pathway, and dysregulating the hypothalamic–pituitary axis. KYN, kynurenine; KYNA,
  kynurenic acid; MS, multiple sclerosis; NE, norepinephrine; QUIN, quinolinic acid;
  SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; 5-HT, serotonin.
