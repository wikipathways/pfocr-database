caption: Mechanisms of DAMPs exposure. Differential mobilization pathways can be observed
  between Type I and Type II ICD inducers, defined by their off-targeted or targeted
  effect on the ER, respectively. Exposure of CRT in the plasma membrane upon treatment
  with Type I ICD inducers requires an intrincate pathway with activation of the ER
  stress–ROS signaling mediated by the activation of the PERK, and the ensuing phosphorylation
  of eiF2α. This is followed by the required cleavage of B-cell receptor-associated
  protein 31 (BAP31) by preapoptotic caspase-8. Bax/Bak activation is also mandatory
  in this process. Finally CRT relocation also requires anterograde ER-Golgi trafficking
  and the exocytic pathway in a SNAP23-dependent manner (). Along all the way from
  the ER to the plasma membrane, CRT is accompanied by ERp57. Upon treatment with
  Type II ICD inducers fewer requirements are needed, since this pathway only relies
  on PERK, Bax, Bak, and the secretory pathway. Regarding ATP secretion upon type
  II ICD inducers treatment, it follows a pathway quite similar to that of CRT, except
  for Bax/Bak and involving partially caspase 8. Type I ICD inducers require an independent
  pathway mediated by autophagy as ATG5, ATG7 and BCN1 are required in ATP release.
  Moreover, other molecules involved in different cellular processes like lysosomal
  exocytosis (LAMP1), membrane blebbing (ROCK1), apoptotic machinery (caspases) and
  membrane permeabilization (PANX1) have been shown to be essential in type I ICD-induced
  ATP externalization (). CRT, calreticulin; eIF2a, eukaryotic initiation factor 2;
