caption: 'Tumorigenic mechanisms of Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal cancer.
  Studies have suggested the following tumorigenic mechanisms of F. nucleatum in colorectal
  cancer (CRC). (1) Increase in tumor cell proliferation: F. nucleatum increases the
  expression of oncogenes such as c-Myc and Cyclin D1 and microRNA-21, directly promoting
  tumor growth. (2) Suppression of the anti-tumor activity of natural killer (NK)
  and T cells: The activity of NK cells and T cells are suppressed by F. nucleatum
  through interaction with the T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) receptor
  expressed on NK cells and T cells, binding and activating the carcinoembryonic antigen-related
  cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) 1, arresting T cells at G1 phase and increasing
  the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. (3) Generation of pro-inflammatory
  microenvironment: F. nucleatum induces pro-inflammatory cytokines production by
  cancer cells and immune cells. (4) Promotion of chemoresistance: F. nucleatum promotes
  chemoresistance to 5-fuorouracil (5-FU) by up-regulating baculoviral inhibitor of
  apoptosis protein repeat 3 (BIRC3) in CRC cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/Nuclear
  factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, which results in inhibition of cancer cell apoptosis
  and reduced chemosensitivity to 5-FU. F. nucleatum also promotes chemoresistance
  by modulating autophagy. CRC cells infected with F. nucleatum activate the TLR4
  and MYD88 innate immune signaling pathway, causing the loss of microRNAs miR-18a
  and miR-4802, and up-regulating autophagy elements, ULK1 and ATG7, which ultimately
  leads to inhibition of cancer cell apoptosis.'
