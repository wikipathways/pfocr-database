caption: 'Possible interactions of the retinoid pathway with bone morphogenetic protein,
  Hedgehog (HH), and WNT/β-catenin signaling. Retinol enters the cytoplasm and is
  converted into an active form: retinoic acid (RA). Cellular retinoic acid-binding
  protein (CRABP)-bound RA is translocated to the nucleus. On the nuclear binding
  of RA to retinoic acid receptors (RARs), conformational changes cause the ligand-binding
  domain to expose a binding site for coactivators. RARs and retinoic X receptors
  (RXRs) form heterodimeric complexes and bind to retinoic acid response elements
  (RAREs) located at the enhancer regions of RA target genes and initiate gene transcription.
  In the absence of ligands, the coactivators of RARs and RXRs are replaced by co-repressors,
  resulting in transcriptional repression of the target genes. RAR agonists inhibit
  phosphorylation of Smad1/5 and stimulate degradation of Smad1/5. RA stimulates gene
  expression of Shh and Ptch1 in chondrocytes and regulates Ihh gene expression negatively
  and positively in chondrocytes. RA stimulates gene expression of Wnt2b, Wnt4, Wnt5a,
  Wnt5b, Wnt14, Fzd8, and Lrp5 and 6 in mouse chondrocytes. Unliganded RAR-γ is associated
  with β-catenin and inhibits the β-catenin transcriptional activity in mouse chondrocytes.
