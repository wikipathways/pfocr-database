  Gain-of-Function (GoF) mutations found in CLL and other BTKi-sensitive malignancies
  . CD79A and B GoF, found in WM and ABC-type DLBCL, and very rare in CLL, are labeled

  primary GoF mutations in adult T cell leukemia as reported (). The MYD88 L265P GoF
  mutation in 95% of WM patients, and also in ABC-type DLBCL, and in some CLL patients
  induces an activated endolysosome containing TLR9 and the BCR.
