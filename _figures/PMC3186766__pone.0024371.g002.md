caption: (A) The diagrams represents signaling in the synaptic cleft (square = pre-synaptic
  neuron, oval = post-synaptic neuron, circle = glial cell). Green represents downregulation
  of pertinent receptors, red represents upregulation of pertinent receptors. WNV
  induces downregulation of glutamate receptors on the post-synaptic cleft as well
  as glutamate uptake receptors on glial cells. (B) Dopamine receptor signaling pathway.
  The graphic shown is for the exposure analysis, but was similar in all analyses.
  Green represents down-regulation of transcripts, red represents upregulation. Dopamine
  receptors (DRD5) and downstream signaling pathways as well as enzymes that create
  dopamine (TH) were downregulated, while MAO (enzyme that degrades dopamine) was
  upregulated. This network was generated through the use of IPA (Ingenuity Systems,
  www.ingenuity.com).
