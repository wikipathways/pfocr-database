caption: 'The diversification of the innate immune arsenal in amphioxus. (a) A simplified
  model of extracellular and intracellular innate immune signaling in human. TLR signaling
  involves recruitment of a number of TIR domain-containing adaptors, including myeloid
  differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP),
  TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF), TRIF-related adaptor
  molecule (TRAM), and sterile α and HEAT-Armadillo motifs containing protein (SARM),
  which in turn activates transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) that ultimately lead to tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) and type I interferon (IFN) production. NLR signaling can also stimulate
  inflammatory responses via the NF-κB pathway. Also, NLRs can form the inflammasome
  with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and procaspase-1, leading to
  the generation of the active form of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. (b) The diversity
  of the innate immune system in amphioxus. Novel domain architectures as well as
  significant expansion in receptor number are evident. Selected ''direct connection''
  gene models are shown against a pink background. The cellular localization of amphioxus
  TLR proteins is still unclear; some of them could be localized in endosome in a
  manner equivalent to that seen in mammals. Domains: BIR, baculovirus inhibitor of
  apoptosis repeat domain []; CARD, caspase recruitment domain []; CASPASE, caspase
  []; DD, death domain []; DED, death effector domain []; IPAF, ICE (IL-1β converting
  enzyme) protease activating factor; LRR, leucine-rich repeat []; NACHT, NAIP, CIITA,
  HET-E, and TP1 []; NALP, NACHT, LRR, and PYRIN-domain-containing protein; NB-ARC,
  nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, R proteins, and CED-4 []; PYRIN, amino-terminal
  domain of protein pyrin []; TIR, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor [,]; TNFR, tumor necrosis
  factor receptor []; WD40, Trp-Asp 40 [].'
