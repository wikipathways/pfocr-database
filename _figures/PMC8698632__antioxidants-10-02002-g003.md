caption: The results of the present study in patients with CCS are framed according
  to a possible pathophysiologic diagram where “high HO-1” plasma levels reflect a
  compensatory response to an unbalanced redox state that stimulates Nrf2 activation
  and HO-1 production. In this context, a higher oxidative stress is putatively linked
  to adipocyte and endothelial dysfunction, as well as inflammation, all of which
  are factors that may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and predispose
  to ischemia and myocardial dysfunction. On the other hand, higher oxidative stress
  may stimulate the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway with a potential protective feedback, causing
  reduction in cholesterol levels, less vascular remodeling, and improvement of cholesterol
  efflux. The final effect on coronary artery disease pattern would translate into
  a more diffuse coronary atherosclerosis, mainly with non-obstructive and calcified
  plaques, together with higher predisposition to myocardial ischemia and dysfunction.
