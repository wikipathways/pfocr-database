caption: Pathogen responses linked to autophagy in Drosophila melanogaster. Autophagy
  is linked to defense against several intracellular pathogens in the fruit fly D.
  melanogaster. Intracellular peptidoglycan of the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes
  binds to the peptidoglycan recognition receptor PGRP-LE in hemocytes, which induces
  autophagy and clears the pathogen via Atg8 targeting. Infection by Mycobacterium
  marinum, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and Wolbachia, a common insect pathogen,
  is also cleared by autophagy. In particular, clearance of M. marinum and S. enterica
  involves the ubiquitin ligase PARK2/park and Atg8 targeting. Clearance of viral
  infections has also been linked to autophagy. Specifically, binding of the vesicular
  stomatitis virus (VSV)-G glycoprotein to the pattern recognition receptor Toll-7
  inhibits activation of Tor through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt pathway. Because
  Tor negatively regulates autophagy, its inhibition by VSV-G signaling results in
  induction of autophagy, which restricts viral replication and promotes organismal
  survival. See text for details and  for autophagy genes linked to immunity in D.
  melanogaster.
