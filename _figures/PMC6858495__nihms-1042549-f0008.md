caption: Activation of PC-3 by PAC-1 and its derivatives via chelation of labile inhibitory
  zinc. (A) PAC-1 binds zinc, alleviating inhibition of PC-3, allowing for autocatalytic
  formation of caspase-3. (B) Chemical structures of reported derivatives of PAC-1.
  Deviations from PAC-1 are highlighted in blue. (C) A variety of kinase inhibitors
  that target mutant proteins found in cancer are effective as single agents and in
  combination with MEK inhibitors. However, this initial efficacy is short-lived,
  and resistance invariably occurs through a variety of mechanisms surrounding MEK
  reactivation. (D) PAC-1 treatment synergizes with targeted kinase inhibitors and
  leads to robust activation of PC-3. These increased levels of caspase-3 activity
  lead to dramatic reduction of MEK levels via caspase-3 mediated cleavage. This protein
  degradation strategy sustains inhibition of MEK and the MAPK pathway and delays
  the onset of resistance. (E) Time course of phosphorylated MEK1/2 levels upon treatment
  of vemurafenib (BRAFv600E inhibitor, Vem), PAC-1, trametinib (MEK1/2 inhibitor,
  Tram), and combinations as indicated. Experiment was conducted with A375 cells (BRAFv600E
  cell line). PAC-1 combined with vemurafenib leads to persistent phosphorylated MEK1/2
  suppression and increased apoptosis as measured by PARP-1 cleavage. Reprinted with
  permission from ref 207 (some blots have been removed for simplification). Copyright

  (10 μΜ), trametinib (3 nM), and combinations thereof. PAC-1 in combination with
  kinase inhibitors dramatically decreases the occurrence of resistant cell growth.
