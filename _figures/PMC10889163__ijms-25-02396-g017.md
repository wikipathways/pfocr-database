caption: Proline metabolic pathway in soybean. Positive and negative correlations
  between the gene expression of GmNAC19 and each of the four genes involved in the
  proline metabolic pathway (i.e., P5CS, OAT, and P5CR involved in the synthesis of
  proline and ProDH involved in the breakdown of proline) are indicated by blue and
  red arrowed lines, respectively, with the Pearson correlation coefficients indicated
  next to the lines (Table 2). Symbols “*” and “**” indicate significant differences
  in the correlation coefficients determined with p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively
  (Table 2). Symbols “↑” and “↓” indicate up-regulation and down-regulation, respectively.
