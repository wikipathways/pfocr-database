caption: ER stress signaling pathway. Upon induction of ER stress, the ER chaperone
  BiP binds to unfolded proteins and dissociates from three ER stress sensors, namely
  PERK, ATF6 and IRE1. Activated PERK attenuates protein translation by phosphorylating
  eIF2α. Phosphorylated eIF2α also enhances transcription of ATF4 and subsequently
  increases cytoprotective gene transcription. In addition, phosphorylated eIF2α induces
  apoptosis through upregulation of CHOP. ATF6 becomes an active transcription factor
  by translocating to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved by proteases. Activated
  ATF6 stimulates the expression of ER chaperones. ER stress also triggers IRE1 autophosphorylation
  to activate its endoribonuclease activity, which results in the production of spliced
  and active XBP-1s, leading to the expression and production of ER chaperones and
  ER associated degradation proteins. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α
  (eIF2α); C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP); activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6);
  X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1).
