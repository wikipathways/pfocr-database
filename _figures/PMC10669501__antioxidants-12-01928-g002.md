caption: The interplay of NRF2 in Kupffer cells and HSCs during the progression of
  chronic liver disease. In the context of CLD, elevated levels of ROS play a pivotal
  role in amplifying inflammation. An increase in ROS accelerates the degradation
  of IκB, a natural inhibitor of NF-κB. Therefore, more NF-κB translocates to the
  nucleus, fostering the production of pro-inflammatory and growth factors such as
  IL-1B, IL-6, and TNF-a. Kupffer cells then secrete these cytokines, among which
  growth factors are recognized by hepatic stellate cells (HSC) via receptors. This
  recognition process subsequently triggers the formation of SMAD complexes that migrate
  to the nucleus, promoting fibrotic responses. NRF2 has a dual role in both inhibiting
  the pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling pathway and modulating HSC activation. NRF2
  prevents the degradation of IκB and curtails the translocation of NF-κB. This transcription
  factor further dampens the inflammatory landscape by inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and bolstering the formation of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine.
  Specifically, within HSCs, NRF2 thwarts the formation of fibrosis-promoting SMAD
  complexes and diminishes the expression of fibrogenic mediators like PDGF, CTGF,
  and ET-1. All graphical figures are created by using BioRender (https://biorender.com;
