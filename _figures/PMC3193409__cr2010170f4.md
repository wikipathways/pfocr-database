caption: 'Expanding role of ubiquitination in protein kinase activation in diverse
  NF-κB pathways. TCR pathway (upper left): Upon TCR stimulation, the serine/threonine
  kinase PKCθ is activated by a tyrosine kinase cascade. PKCθ promotes the formation
  of a protein complex composed of CARMA1, BCL10 and MALT1. MALT1 recruits TRAF2 and
  TRAF6, which catalyze K63 polyubiquitination that leads to the activation of TAK1
  and IKK. NLR pathway (upper center): In response to bacterial peptidoglycans, cytosolic
  receptors NODs recruit TRAF proteins and target RIP2 for K63 ubiquitination, leading
  to the activation of TAK1 and IKK. RLR pathway (upper right): After viral infection,
  the viral RNA binds to the cytosolic RNA helicase RIG-I, which then binds to unanchored
  K63 polyubiquitin chains synthesized by the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25. This binding
  activates RIG-I, which transduces the signal to MAVS, a mitochondrial membrane protein.
  MAVS in turn activates IKK and TBK1, leading to the activation of NF-κB and IRF3,
  respectively. NF-κB and IRF3 enter the nucleus to induce the transcription of type-I
  interferons (IFN-Is). DNA damage pathway (bottom): Genotoxic stress caused by DNA
  double-strand breaks triggers the sequential modification of NEMO by SUMO1 and ubiquitin.
  Monoubiquitinated NEMO exits the nucleus together with ATM and this complex promotes
  K63 polyubiquitination of ELKS and/or TRAF6, which in turn activates TAK1 and IKK.'
