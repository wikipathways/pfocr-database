caption: The nuclear receptor pathway involving FTZ-F1 and HR39 regulates the EcR-B1
  expression in muscle and initiate dismantling. FTZ-F1 and HR39 positively and negatively
  respectively control the EcR-B1 expression at the postsynapse. FTZ-F1-mediated EcR-B1
  expression leads to transcriptional regulation of target genes involved in postsynaptic
  degradation. Then, TGF-β/BMP signaling is supposed to be induced in response to
  postsynaptic degradation. We propose that this signal produced by the dismantling
  muscle is received by the motor neuron where activation of EcR-B1 expression (by
  TGF-β signaling and nuclear receptor) triggers the axon retraction. In addition,
  glial cells and macrophages participate to the NMJ dismantling process.
