caption: Polyamine synthesis proceeds with the decarboxylation of ornithine to form
  putrescine via the action of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Spermidine and spermine
  are then formed in step-wise fashion by spermidine synthase (SPDS) and spermine
  synthase (SPMS). Both SPDS and SPMS utilize decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine,
  a product of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), as a substrate for spermidine
  and spermine synthesis. Together with ODC, AdoMetDC comprise the rate-limiting steps
  of polyamine synthesis. During catabolism, spermine can be directly oxidized to
  spermidine by spermine oxidase (SMO). Induction of Spermidine/Spermine N1-acetyltransferase
  (SSAT), the rate-limiting step of polyamine catabolism, results in N1-acetylated
  forms of spermine and spermidine. Through the subsequent activity of polyamine oxidase
  (PAO) spermine can be converted to spermidine and spermidine to putrescine. The
  precursor to polyamine synthesis, ornithine, is synthesised by multiple routes.
  As an intermediate of the urea cycle, ornithine is synthesised from arginine by
  arginase. The urea cycle may also act as a vehicle to link the TCA cycle to polyamine
  synthesis as aspartate is used to form argininosuccinate that is subsequently combined
  with fumarate to make arginine. Arginine may also be taken up as a substrate and
  synthesised directly to ornithine. Both proline and glutamate can feed into ornithine
  synthesis through Δ1-Pyrroline 5-carboxylate that once catalyzed to Glutamate-γ-semialdehyde
  can be converted to ornithine by ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT). Finally, glutamine
  can also feed into the urea cycle via carbamoyl phosphate that enters the cycle
  at citrulline (not shown).
