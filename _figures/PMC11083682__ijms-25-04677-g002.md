caption: Schematic representation of the influenza viral degradation of cellular proteins
  involved in the interferon responses. (A) During influenza virus infection, the
  RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway is activated to promote the production of type
  I IFNs. Viral NS1 targets OTUB1, which is a key regulator of RIG-I for proteasomal
  degradation, therefore antagonizing the RIG-I activation. Viral NP and PB1 interact
  with MAVS, leading to the degradation of MAVS through autophagosomes with distinctive
  mechanisms, thereby blocking the MAVS-mediated activation of the downstream factors.
  The M1 protein of IDV interacts with TRAF6, which positively regulates MAVS and
  mediates the K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6, triggering the degradation of this
  protein. IAV NS1 induces the ubiquitination and degradation of SPL, resulting in
  an impaired activation of IKKε. PB1-F2 protein from influenza A/Brevig Mission/1/1918
  (H1N1) strain binds to DDX3, which contributes to type I IFN induction, leading
  to the proteasomal degradation of this protein. (B) Influenza viral HA triggers
  the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IFNAR1, leading to the degradation of
  this receptor. Cellular proteins CK1α and PARP1 are critical for HA-induced IFNAR1
  degradation. IAV PB2 protein targets JAK1 for ubiquitination at lysine 859 and 860
  (K859/860), while PA from H5 subtypes of IAV interacts with JAK1 and induces ubiquitination
  of JAK1 at K249. Both viral proteins are capable of triggering the ubiquitination-dependent
  degradation of JAK1, leading to impaired signaling transduction for all three types
  of interferons (type I, II, and III). IAV also upregulates SOCS1, which promotes
  proteasomal degradation of JAK1. Influenza viral NS1 interacts with DNA methyltransferase,
  DNMT3B, and induces the dissociation of DNMT3B from the promoter regulatory regions
  of the JAK-STAT regulator, transporting DNMT3B into the cytoplasm, followed by the
  ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of this protein. Influenza virus infection
  upregulates the expression of an E3 ligase of IFNLR1 called FBXO45 by a yet-unidentified
  viral mechanism, which in turn mediates ubiquitination of IFNLR1, leading to the
  proteasome-dependent degradation of this receptor. Viral HA also induces the phosphorylation
  and ubiquitination of IFNGR1, resulting in the degradation of IFNGR1, thus suppressing
  the type II IFN-mediated antiviral defense
