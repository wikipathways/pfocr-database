caption: Schematic of the two commonly activated pathways and genetic aberrations
  involved in thyroid cancer, as well as the targeted therapies studied in thyroid
  cancer. The MAPK and the PI3K pathways are activated by the receptor tyrosine kinase
  (RTK). Increased activity of the receptor tyrosine kinases (purple bars) by growth
  factors, as well as mutations along the pathway, results in oncogenic activation
  of the MAPK pathway, leading to activation of MEK and ERK and, subsequently, tumor
  progression. The PI3K pathway is negatively regulated by PTEN and is activated by
  mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT, and mTOR. The PI3K pathway can also be activated
  by RAS and NF1 mutations, as there is a cross-talk mechanism with the MAPK pathway.
  TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene and plays a role in apoptosis. TERT activation via
  TERT promotor mutations promotes cell immortality. Patients with TERT promotor mutations
  that coexist with BRAF or RAS mutations have a worse prognosis. In green are drugs
  that can potentially target along these signaling pathways to shrink tumors or halt
  their growth. AKT, protein kinase B.
