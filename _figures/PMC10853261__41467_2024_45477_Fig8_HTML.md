caption: The GC/GR complex activates Klf9 gene transcription in macrophages. KLF9
  caused macrophage deactivation through recruiting chromatin silencer SIN3A/HDACs
  complex to the promoter region of Il6, Ptgs2, Arg1, and Chil3, thereby inhibiting
  p65 and STAT3 binding to the promoter regions and expression of these genes. Deactivation
  of macrophages leads to reduced secretion of IL6, PGE2, etc., causing decreased
  phosphorylation of STAT3 in adipocytes. STAT3 signaling pathway disruption in adipocytes
  decreased beige adipocyte thermogenesis and increased lipid accumulation, ultimately
  leading to adiposity
