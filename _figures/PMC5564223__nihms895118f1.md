caption: Proposed mechanism of the influence of Notch and Wnt pathways in the oncogenesis
  and stemness maintenance of breast cancer cells in the absence of estrogen. Following
  the estrogen inhibition by estrogen antagonist drugs, Notch pathway activation induces
  the expression of estrogen-responsive genes via the IKK-α cooperative chromatin
  recruitment of Notch-CSL-MAML1 transcriptional complex (NTC). NTC promotes the recruitment
  of transcriptional co-activator proteins such as p180 and p300 on the estrogen-responsive
  gene promoters resulting in the expression of the downstream Notch target genes
  including cyclin D1 and c-MYC, both involved in tumor formation, rapid progression,
  aggressiveness, and poor prognosis. E-cadherin inhibition as a consequence of Notch
  activation induces the accumulation of free β-catenin (β-catenin) proteins in the
  cytoplasm followed by their entry in the nucleus facilitated by Wnt pathway. Inside
  the nucleus, β-catenin binds to the TCF/LEF protein and acts as a transcriptional
  co-activator of the Wnt target gene c-MYC whose upregulation has been associated
  with the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics by epithelial cells also known
  as the EMT.
