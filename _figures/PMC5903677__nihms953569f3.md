caption: Therapeutic targets for brain injury for nanoparticle mediated drug delivery.
  Brain injury leads to a cascade of secondary damage events (denoted in grey boxes).
  These secondary injuries are potential targets for therapeutics where NP delivery
  may be useful. Potential interventions strategies are highlighted with red/green/blue
  font where inhibitors/blocking agents are in red, neuroprotective agents via pathway
  modulation in green, and targeting ligands in blue.
