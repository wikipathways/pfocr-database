caption: Mechanisms by which radiation enhances and inhibits immune response. Irradiation
  of tumor leads to immunogenic cell death and release of tumor neoantigens. Multiple
  DAMPs secreted from apoptotic tumor cells facilitate the uptake and presentation
  of neoantigens. Released ATP and exposure of CRT send the ‘find me’ and ‘eat me’
  signal to APC and phagocyte respectively. HMGB1 promotes maturation of APC through
  binding with TLR4. As a result, APC migrates to lymph nodes and presents neoantigens
  to T cells mediated by MHC pathway. In addition to antigen presentation, type I
  IFN via cGAS-STING pathway and a variety of other cytokines and chemokines also
  take part in T cell priming and activation. The activated T cells, especially the
  CD8+ T cells proliferate, home to tumor, and exert their killing effect. Apart from
  the irradiated tumor site, effector T cells also migrate to distant tumors and drive
  abscopal effect. However, immune escape appears after radiation, which limits the
  efficacy of radiation. Upregulation of immune checkpoints, such as CTLA-4 on Tregs
  and PD-L1 on tumor cells, inhibits the activation and function of T cells. TGF β
  secreted by Tregs is capable to significantly increase the number of immunosuppressive
  cells in the TME, including Treg, CAF, MDSC and M2 phenotype macrophage.

  description: Mechanisms by which radiation enhances and inhibits immune response.
    Irradiation of tumor leads to immunogenic cell death and release of tumor neoantigens.
    Multiple DAMPs secreted from apoptotic tumor cells facilitate the uptake and presentation
    of neoantigens. Released ATP and exposure of CRT send the ‘find me’ and ‘eat me’
    signal to APC and phagocyte respectively. HMGB1 promotes maturation of APC through
    binding with TLR4. As a result, APC migrates to lymph nodes and presents neoantigens
    to T cells mediated by MHC pathway. In addition to antigen presentation, type
    I IFN via cGAS-STING pathway and a variety of other cytokines and chemokines also
    take part in T cell priming and activation. The activated T cells, especially
    the CD8+ T cells proliferate, home to tumor, and exert their killing effect. Apart
    from the irradiated tumor site, effector T cells also migrate to distant tumors
    and drive abscopal effect. However, immune escape appears after radiation, which
    limits the efficacy of radiation. Upregulation of immune checkpoints, such as
    CTLA-4 on Tregs and PD-L1 on tumor cells, inhibits the activation and function
    of T cells. TGF β secreted by Tregs is capable to significantly increase the number
    of immunosuppressive cells in the TME, including Treg, CAF, MDSC and M2 phenotype
