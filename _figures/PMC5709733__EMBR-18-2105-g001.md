caption: Metabolic inputs regulate epigenetics and cell signaling to promote changes
  in cell fate. Glycolysis produces metabolic intermediates that feed into the folate
  and one carbon metabolism cycle to produce S‐adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is
  a cofactor for DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTs).
  The energy released from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation also converts
  AMP to ATP and NAD+ to NADH. AMP stimulates AMPK activity, and NAD+ is a cofactor
  for sirtuins, so increased energy production decreases the activity of these enzymes.
  Glucose‐derived acetyl‐CoA enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to form citrate,
  which can be converted back to acetyl‐CoA by ATP‐citrate lyase. This source of acetyl‐CoA
  (but not acetyl‐CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation) contributes to the pool of
  nuclear acetyl‐CoA that is essential for histone acetylation by histone acetyltransferases
  (HATs). α‐ketoglutarate (α‐KG), which is produced in the TCA cycle and in the cytoplasm,
  is an essential cofactor for TET and Jumonji C enzymes, which demethylate DNA and
  histones, respectively. The energy released from oxidative phosphorylation converts
  FAD to FADH2, and FAD is a cofactor for lysine‐specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), so
  a reduction in FAD levels inhibits LSD1 activity. Increased oxidative phosphorylation
  also generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote oxidation, carbonylation,
  and hydroxylation as well as increase the levels of JNK and p38/MAPK pathway activity.
  Low levels of oxygen (O2), for example in the HSC and satellite cell niches, increase
  the activity of the hypoxia inducible factor‐1 (HIF‐1), which promotes glycolysis.
