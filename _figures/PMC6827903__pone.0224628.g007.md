caption: In general, RA canonically binds to nuclear RARs to control the transcriptional
  expression of RA target genes. Based on our results, we propose a novel concept
  that RA signaling also functions via an alternate signal transduction cascade in
  the cytoplasm, independent of the canonical pathway mediated by nuclear RARs, to
  control meiosis. In isolated XX and XY germ cells, external RA noncanonically stimulates
  the ERK1/2 signal transduction pathway in the cytoplasm. The phosphorylated ERK1/2
  moves to the nucleus and contributes to Stra8 expression to stimulate meiotic initiation.
  Although the details of the molecular features of this proposed alternate RA-stimulated
  ERK1/2 pathway remain unclear, it is possible that crosstalk between the canonical
  and noncanonical activities of RA impact the transcriptional regulation of Stra8
  to induce entry into meiosis.
