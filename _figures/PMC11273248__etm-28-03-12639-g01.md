caption: Mechanisms of flavonoid compounds exerting protective effects on SAH. (A)
  Baicalin, baicalein and quercetin increase the activities of SOD and GSH-Px, while
  decreasing the MDA level, thus inhibiting oxidative damage. (B) Luteolin and baicalin
  inhibit oxidative damage by activating Nrf2, and luteolin also inhibits the NLRP3-mediated
  inflammatory response through regulating Nrf2. (C) Rutin inhibits the inflammatory
  response by inhibiting the RAGE-NF-κB pathway. (D) Apigenin inhibits the TLR4-induced
  inflammatory response. (E) Baicalin prevents t blood-brain barrier disruption by
  inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. (F) Puerarin attenuates apoptosis by regulating
  the Bcl-2/Bax/cleaved Caspase-3 pathway. (G) Pinocembrin inhibits the inflammation
  mediated by NF-κB by promoting SIRT-1. (H) Scutellarin promotes the Erk5-KLF2-eNOS
  pathway, thus reducing CVS by promoting smooth muscle cell relaxation. (I) Baicalin
  maintains the expression levels of GPX4 protein and inhibits the ferroptosis after
  SAH. SAH, subarachnoid hemorrhage; OS, oxidative stress; SOD, superoxide dismutase;
  GSH-Px, glutathione peroxidase; MDA, malondialdehyde; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  RKIP, RAF kinase inhibitor protein; CVS, cerebral vasospasm; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases;
  BBB, blood-brain barrier
