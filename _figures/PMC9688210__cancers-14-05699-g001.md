caption: Interaction between TET2 and RHOA mutations. TET2 loss increases HSPCs self-renewal
  and proliferation. Cooperativity between TET2 loss and RHOA G17V in T cell lineage
  suppresses the CD8+ T cell differentiation and endows the naïve CD4+ T cells with
  a competitive advantage, skews cells differentiation toward Tfh cells, and induces
  abnormal Tfh cell activation and transformation. ICOS exerts its costimulatory function
  via the ICOS-PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway, which is essential in driving Tfh lineage
  differentiation and maintaining the Tfh phenotype. In addition, ICOS activates AKT
  via PI3K. By phosphorylating the transcription factor FOXO1, AKT reduces the transcription
  factor KIF2, leading to a significant increase in the number of Tfh cells. Both
  of these pathways play an essential role in promoting Tfh lineage specification
  and AITL transformation. HSC, hematopoietic stem cells; MPP, multipotent blood progenitors;
