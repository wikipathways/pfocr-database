caption: The predicted function of miRNAs interacting with circPSEN1s is summarized
  in this picture. circPSEN1s act as sponges for specific miRNAs, including miR-597-3p,
  miR-616-3p, miR-1972, miR-4279, miR-4668-5p, miR-4687-3p, miR-5584-5p, and miR-6755-3p.
  This interaction leads to the rescue of their target mRNAs, which can be either
  specific (WTIP (WT1 interacting protein), TGIF (TGFB induced factor homeobox 1),
  SMAD4 (SMAD family member 4), PPP1CB (protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit beta),
  and BMPR1A (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1A)) or common (QSER1 (glutamine
  and serine-rich 1), BACE2 (beta-secretase 2), RNF157 (ring finger protein 157),
  PTMA (prothymosin alpha), and GJD3 (gap junction protein delta 3)). As a result,
  the TGF-beta (transforming growth factor β) and Hippo (hippopotamus) signaling pathways
  are predominantly influenced.
