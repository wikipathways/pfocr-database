caption: 'Schematic Diagram of Mitochondrial Impairment Caused by Mutant Huntingtin.
  Mutant huntingtin (mHtt) enhances the activities of: (1) NMDA receptors (NMDARs),
  especially those containing NR2B subunit via increased receptor trafficking, (2)
  voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) via association with mHtt at the cellular membrane,
  and (3) type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor (InsP3R1) via direct
  interaction with mHtt in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), effects that lead to increased
  Ca2+ loading. mHtt translocates into nucleus and interferes with CREB-dependent
  transcriptional processes by binding to CREB-binding protein (CBP) and TBP-associated
  factor 4 (TAF4), which at least in part leads to transcriptional down-regulation
  of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARα) coactivator-1α (PGC-1α).
  Impairment of the PGC-1α pathway by mHtt may give rise to the decreased activity
  of PPARγ. Since PGC-1α and PPARγ play a pivotal role in mitochondrial biogenesis
  and respiration, energy metabolism, thermogenesis, and detoxification of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), the defects in PGC-1α/PPARγ pathway is likely in turn to contribute
  to mitochondrial impairment in HD. As a result of increased Ca2+ loading and impaired
  transcriptional processes, mitochondria in HD undergo functional deficits including
  Ca2+ handing defects, a decrease in ATP production, an increased sensitivity of
  mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) loss to Ca2+ loading, and a decrease in ROS
  defense'
