caption: A simplified hypothetical illustration of signaling in response to low and
  high LET IR in U-1810 cells. The NSCLC cell line U-1810 can resist apoptosis when
  treated with low LET IR. However, in response to high LET IR, these cells start
  a proapoptotic signaling through an early activation of JNK. Left, a hypothetical
  explanation is that high LET IR causes a decrease of 14-3-3 and possibly phosphorylation
  of c-Abl by JNK (I). As a consequence, c-Abl cannot form a complex with 14-3-3 (II)
  and is allowed to translocate to the nucleus (III) where it is activated by IR-induced
  DNA damage that in turn through activation of MKK4 mediates a late JNK activation
  (IV). This subsequently leads to activation of various proapoptotic signaling molecules
  and activation of mitochondria resulting in an apoptotic cell death. JNK may also
  phosphorylate the transcriptional factor c-Jun, which can increase expression of
  Fas ligand (V) and thereby activate non-mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signaling
  (VI). High LET IR also deactivates p38 that in turn inhibits the IGF-1R-mediated
  survival signaling in these NSCLC cells (VII). Right, in contrast, low LET IR can
  neither activate JNK-mediated apoptotic signaling (VIII) nor inhibit p38-mediated
  survival signaling via the IGF-1R/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway
  (IX). As a result, U-1810 cells can resist low LET IR-induced apoptotic cell death.
