caption: 'Evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein Quaking (Qki) and its role
  during later stages of neocortical development. (A) Domain structures of Qki in
  Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Mustela putorius
  furo, and Homo sapiens according to https://www.uniprot.org or https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.
  The RNA-binding motif K homology (KH) domain is colored in red, Quaking (QUA; QUA1
  involved in homodimerization and QUA2 involved in RNA binding) domains are labeled
  in cyan, and nuclear localization signal motif is in rose. The UniProtKB of NCBI
  accession numbers are indicated below for Qki protein in D. melanogaster: held out
  wings (HOW) (NP_524447.2); C. elegans: Germline Defective-1 (GLD-1) (Q17339), M.
  musculus: Qki (Q9QYS9); M. putorius furo: Qki (XP_004769624.1); and H. sapiens:
  QKI (Q96PU8). (B) Qki is selectively expressed in proliferative regions in the developing
  neocortex where it promotes the cell fate switch from neurons toward glial cells.
  Qki synergistically controls the expression of gliogenic regulons (shown in box
  at bottom center) by binding targets’ 3′UTRs and stabilizing target mRNAs associated
  with glia-, astrocyte-, oligodendrocyte precursor-, astrocyte precursor-, oligodendrocyte-,
  and astrocyte-specific genes, as well as cell-surface signaling receptors, and endocytosis
  pathway genes.'
