caption: Honokiol and ionizing radiation (IR) affect Notch signaling. (A) Upon binding
  to a ligand, the transmembrane Notch receptor is cleaved by γ-secretase, allowing
  the intracellular domain to translocate to the nucleus, where it can activate a
  variety of transcription programs, including that of its own ligand. Notch signaling
  can, therefore, play a role in synchronizing signaling across cells in a population.
  (B) Western blot readouts of proteins affected by honokiol and/or IR from Ponnurangam
  et al. are represented as discrete digital values of activate and inactive states.
  (C) The initial proposed interaction network describing the effect honokiol and
  IR on cellular signaling with cross talk to the Notch pathway. Black edges with
  arrows indicate activating regulations and red edges with blunt ends indicate inhibiting
  regulations.
