caption: Gene networks associated with intestinal processes and diseases. Red indicates
  that relative mRNA levels are increased for the transcript, while blue indicates
  that relative mRNA levels are decreased for the transcript. The square entities
  refer to cell processes, the oval entities refer to proteins in general, triangles
  represent ligands, and receptors are those molecules embedded in the membrane with
  the mushroom cap. The arrows indicate direction of entity regulation. (A) Gene networks
  associated with leukocyte functions, including leukocyte adhesion, tethering/rolling,
  migration, accumulation, differentiation, and interaction with endothelial cells,
  were all altered. The mean fold change of the entire network is ~10% (1.1-fold).
  (B) Overall suppression in the classical complement system in the colon of b1/2-ARs
  KO chimera. The mean fold change of this gene network is ~21% decrease (1.21-fold).
  (C) Gene networks associated with intestine function, including barrier integrity,
  secretion, and motility were decreased by 6.5% (1.065-fold). (D) Gene networks associated
  with intestinal conditions including intestine morphology, enteritis, ileitis, and
  inflammatory stress are decreased by 7.5% (1.075-fold). Complete data are presented
  in Appendix  and . All genes within a pathway are located in Appendix .
