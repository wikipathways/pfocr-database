caption: The HP diet induced decreased hepatic expression of enzymes involved in amino
  acid catabolism. Enzymes and factors whose mRNA expression is higher and lower in
  the livers of HP diet-fed rats are shown in red and blue, respectively, in comparison
  to their expression in the livers of control diet-fed rats. Also see  for DEGs related
  to amino acid metabolism. Amino acids are represented by white letters and down-regulated
  pathways are represented by blue arrows. TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
