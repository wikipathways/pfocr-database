caption: "WNT signaling pathways. (A) Canonical WNT/\U0001D6FD-catenin signaling pathway.
  Absence of WNT ligand: WNT signaling is in an “off” state when a WNT ligand does
  not bind to the receptors Frizzled (Fz) and LRP5/6. In turn, the destruction complex
  (APC, Axin, CK1, GSK-3\U0001D6FD) will phosphorylate cytoplasmic \U0001D6FD-catenin
  leading to proteosomal degradation. WNT binding: WNT signaling is turned “on” when
  a WNT ligand binds to the receptors Fz and LRP5/6. Following binding, the Disheveled
  (Dsh) scaffolding protein recruits and complexes with the destruction complex, subsequently
  impairing \U0001D6FD-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. \U0001D6FD-catenin
  will accumulate in the cytoplasm where it will translocate to the nucleus and interact
  with TCF/LEF factors to regulate transcription of WNT target genes. (B) Non-canonical
  WNT/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. Activation of WNT/PCP is independent
  of \U0001D6FD-catenin and does not require WNT ligand binding to LRP5/6 receptor.
  After WNT ligand binding, Dsh is activated which then activates RhoA and Rac1, resulting
  in activation of ROCK and JNK signaling, respectively. Activation of these signaling
  pathways mediate cytoskeleton remodeling, cell polarity, and cell motility. (C)
  Non-canonical WNT/Ca2+ signaling pathway. WNT ligands bind to Fz inducing the activation
  and recruitment of Dsh and G-proteins. Here, Dsh activates phosphodiesterase PDE
  which inhibits PKG and subsequent release of calcium ions. In addition, Dsh activation
  induces expression of PLC which functions to activate IP3 and DAG. IP3 promotes
  the release of calcium ions which activates expression of: Calcineurin and subsequently
  NFAT leading to greater control of cell polarity, CAMKII which induces TAK1 and
  NLK to repress WNT target gene transcription, and lastly, PKC which promotes CDC42
  expression and downstream cytoskeletal rearrangement."
