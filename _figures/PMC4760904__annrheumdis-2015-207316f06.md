caption: Agrin and LRP4 are central to a chondrogenic signalling network. Agrin is
  a paracrine signal which supports chondrocyte differentiation through a pathway
  requiring both LRP4 and α-dystroglycan which upregulates SOX9 and its transcriptional
  targets COL2A1 and ACAN. Agrin-induced chondrocyte differentiation is not associated
  with chondrocyte hypertrophy. LRP4 interacts with other pathways regulating chondrocyte
  differentiation including WNTs and BMPs.   ACAN, aggrecan; BMPs, bone morphogenetic
  proteins; COL2A1, collagen type II; FZD; frizzled receptor; LRP, low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.
papertitle: Agrin mediates chondrocyte homeostasis and requires both LRP4 and α-dystroglycan
  to enhance cartilage formation in vitro and in vivo.
