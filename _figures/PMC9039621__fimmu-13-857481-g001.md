caption: Overview of the complement system. The complement system is a collection
  of plasma and membrane-bound proteins which form part of the innate immune response
  against invading pathogens as well as performing other immunological roles. The
  system can be divided into three pathways (classical, lectin, alternative). The
  classical pathway is typically antibody-dependent and relies on the binding of C1q
  protein. The lectin pathway is antibody-independent and utilises lectins such as
  mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolin-1 (FCN-1) to bind glycosylated regions
  on the surface antigens of pathogens. The alternative pathway is activated from
  spontaneous hydrolysis of the C3 protein and an absence of regulatory proteins on
  the microbial surface. In the context of viral infection, complement activation
  aims to limit infection through the promotion of inflammation and chemotaxis, the
  opsonisation of virions, the aggregation of virions, the direct lysis of virion
  and infected cell membranes, and by aiding the development of the adaptive immune
  response. (Ab), antibody; (Ag), antigen; (DC), dendritic cells; (FB), factor B;
