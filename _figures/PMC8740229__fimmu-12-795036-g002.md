caption: TREM2 and neuroinflammation. TLR4 mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  in central nervous system (CNS) through regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway. NLRP3
  inflammasome recruited and activated caspase-1, produced IL-1β by shearing pro-IL-1β
  and then induced neuroinflammation, which could damage dopamine neurons. However,
  TREM2 negatively regulated TLR4-mediated these neuroinflammatory signaling activation.
