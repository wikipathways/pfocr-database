caption: '. Leptin, through its receptor ObR (A) and the interleukin 6 pathway, by
  means of its receptor GP-130 (B), activates the transcription factor STAT3, which,
  in the nucleus, transcribes the gene of SOCS3 that suppresses the leptin signaling
  pathways. However, it also activates the transcription of metalloproteinases and
  aggrecanases, cartilage degradation proteins. Signaling pathways of inflammatory
  cytokines: tumor necrosis factor alpha through the tumor necrosis factor receptor
  (C), interleukin 1β by its interleukin receptor 1β (D), and the saturated fatty
  acids, that are recognized by the Toll-like 4 receptors (E). These pathways culminate
  in activation of the transcription factors NF-kβ and AP-1, that transcribe the genes
  of inflammatory proteins (interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha,
  induced nitric oxide synthase among others).'
