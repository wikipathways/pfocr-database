caption: Biological interaction between glucose and genes up- (light grey) or down-regulated
  (white) in primary hepatic stellate cells after overexpression of Smad7. Genes linked
  to glucose by binding or regulatory interactions are depicted as interconnecting
  lines between glucose and the gene symbols. Pathway analysis was done with Pathway
  Architect software (Stratagene).
