caption: 'Top panel: Path of T-cell precursors through the thymus during development.
  A major pathway for adult murine thymocyte development is depicted, with cells shown
  from the point of entry into the thymus at the cortico–medullary junction through
  their migration to the outer rim of the cortex during the progression toward commitment,
  on the left-hand path. Early T-cell precursors (ETP), double negative (DN) 2 subsets,
  DN3 subsets, and DN4 cells are defined as described in . In the adult thymus, the
  immigrants initially enter the thymus through vessels near the cortical-medullary
  junction, and migrate outward through the thymus as shown as they pass through the
  indicated stages. Note that at any given cell cycle, the ETPs appear to have the
  options either to continue their expansion, with minimal differentiation, in the
  cortical-medullary junction region or to differentiate into DN2 cells (presumably,
  DN2a cells as shown) and begin their migration outward through the cortex. For β-selection,
  they are situated in the extreme outer portion of the thymus (subscapsular zone).
  The reversal of migration for later stages of thymocyte development is shown on
  the right-hand path. Broken arrows depict alternative developmental pathways that
  are still open to ETP and different subsets of DN2 cells that are likely to correspond
  to DN2a and DN2b cells.'
