caption: Lipid droplets (LDs) and the molecular mechanisms regulating immune response
  during protozoan infection. Interferon (IFN)-γ receptor signaling induces transduction
  of GTPases family molecules—immunity-related GTPases (GKS e IRGM proteins) and GPBs
  subfamilies—that play essential roles in membrane vesicular trafficking, autophagy,
  and antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory responses. IRGM are abundant proteins on
  LDs and “protects self-vesicles” from GKS and guanylate binding proteins (GBPs)
  destruction by autophagy machinery. The inactive GKS and GBP proteins built a pool
  of molecules available on cytoplasm and could have a stable association with the
  IRGM-deficient membrane, as parasitophorous vacuole membrane and eventually as LDs,
  to target them to autophagy, or lipophagy, respectively. LDs provide fatty acids,
  and lipids employed the phagophore membrane, implying their enzymes [steryl esters
  (STEs) and TAGs] on autophagosome biogenesis. IFN-γ signaling induces upregulation
  of LDs, and it appears to involve perilipin 2 (PLIN2)/ADRP that physically associates
  with IRGM. LD is also related to cross-presentation pathway since depletion of LDs
  by pharmacological inhibition of DGAT and by PLIN2/ADRP deficiency led to decreased
  LD biogenesis and cross-presentation since MHC-I surface expression, and the rate
  of antigen-presenting cell conjugated with T CD8+ lymphocyte are reduced.
