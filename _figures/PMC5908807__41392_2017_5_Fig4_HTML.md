caption: YAP signaling is associated with unfavorable prognosis for PDAC. Multiple
  YAP/TEAD-regulated genes are associated with unfavorable survival of PDAC patients
  (indicated in red). Growth factors (TGFα, EPEG, and HBEGF), a specific integrin
  (ITGA2), GPCRs (P2Y2R, GPR87) or an inhibitor of the Hippo pathway (MUC1) that stimulate
  YAP activity are also associated with unfavorable survival in PDAC. Conversely,
  YAP inhibitory pathways, including STRAD/LKB-1, PKA/LATS, and TSC/mTORC1 are associated
  with a favorable prognosis (indicated in blue). The key feature is that each component
  of the network has an impact on survival of PDAC patients, as derived from the Pathology
  Atlas, as well as additional references cited in the text. An unfavorable prognosis
  for PDAC is in red and a favorable prognosis for PDAC is in blue. All prognostic
  associations are highly statistically significant (p < 0.001). Further details are
  in the text
