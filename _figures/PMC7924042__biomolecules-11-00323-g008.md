caption: Cardioprotective mechanism of catalpol in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Under
  hyperglycemia, the production of AGE is increased, leading to activation of AGE–RAGE
  signaling pathway with increased ROS production and activation of NF-κB. IκBα acts
  as an inhibitor of NF-κB, which is able to inhibit apoptosis. Nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB binds to Neat 1 promoter. Neat 1 then inhibits expression of miR140-50;
  this then stimulates expression of HDAC4. As a result, apoptosis occurs with downregulation
  of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax and Casp-3. Catalpol has been shown to inhibit
  apoptosis in in vivo studies, where expression of Neat 1 is inhibited, leading to
  increased expression of HDAC4. Hence, there is increased upregulation of Bcl-2 and
  downregulation of Bax and Casp-3. In in vitro studies, catalpol has shown decreased
  production of ROS, which then decreases the activation of NF-κB. Catalpol also increased
  the expression of IκBα, which inhibits the activation of NF-κB. Catalpol inhibits
  Neat 1 expression, which causes upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax
  and Casp-3, leading to attenuation of apoptosis.
