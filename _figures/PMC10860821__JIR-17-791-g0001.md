caption: Mechanisms of three types of pyroptosis pathway. In the canonical pathway,
  PRRs detect signals both inside and outside cells and trigger the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, which boosts the expression of multiple genes. Other factors, such as ion
  flow, mitochondrial damage, and reactive molecules, can also activate NLRP3 inflammatory
  vesicles. These vesicles then change GSDMD into GSDMD-NT, leading to the formation
  of membrane pores as they aggregate and insert into the plasma membrane. Additionally,
  Caspase-1 helps create functional IL-1β and IL-18, which exit through these pores.
  In the non-canonical pathway, intracellular LPS triggers the activation of pro-caspase-4/-5/-11
  via GBP and then promotes the production of active IL-1β and IL-18. LPS activates
  the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways and activates GSDMD-NT by binding to the receptor
  in the alternative pathway. It leads to the forming of the GSDMD pore and NLRP3
  inflammatory vesicle through caspase-8. Then IL-1β is activated and released extracellularly
  through the GSDMD pore. The process can be inhibited by cFLIPL. It’s worth noting
  that there is mutual regulation between the canonical and non-canonical pathways
