caption: The mechanisms underlying radio-resistance in CSCs. Upon radiation, multiple
  signaling pathways are triggered to induce resistance and maintain stemness in CSCs.
  First, radiation induces the expression of Exo1 and RAD51, which are involved in
  DNA repair. The JAK/STAT3 pathway is triggered by radiation, then activates the
  following CCND2 signaling and subsequent G1-to-S transition. Radiation also alters
  the cell cycle through ATM/ATR-associated signaling. In CSCs, miR-18a-5p overexpression
  degrades ATR and HIF-1α, thereby overcoming resistance to radiation. Additionally,
  ΔNp63α promotes the transcription of ribosome S6 protein kinase 4 (RSK4). Then,
  RSK4 phosphorylates GSK-3β at Ser9, which leads to the transcription of β-catenin-mediated
  stemness-related genes. Moreover, autophagy-related proteins are upregulated in
  some CSCs, where CSCs are involved in radio-resistance
