caption: 'Illustration of lactate and SCFA biogenesis in the common mucosal niche
  of epithelial cells (EP) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in humans. Under anaerobic
  conditions, glucose is preferentially catabolized to L-lactate (LL) via glycolysis.
  Cancer cells also utilize glucose to make L-lactate in the presence of sufficient
  oxygen via aerobic glycolysis. Boosted glycolysis pathway generates highly reactive
  intermediates detoxified through methylglyoxal pathway to D-lactate. Generated L-
  and D-lactate (DL) can be used to replenish the pyruvate pool for TCA cycling or
  be exported via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1-4) to extracellular space. Healthy
  commensal microbiota of gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts are able to produce
  lactate and short-chain fatty acids through homo- and heterofermentation of glucose.
  Locally produced lactate by EP cells and lactate together with butyrate (B), acetate
  (A), and propionate (P) by LAB can trigger neighboring EP cells through specific
  GPCRs: hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors (HCA1/2) and free fatty acid receptors (FFAR2/3).
  Alternatively, monocarboxylic acids can be actively taken up by EP via MCTs or SMCT1
  and exert their intracellular inhibitory action on HDACs or to fuel the TCA cycle
  (lactate and pyruvate, Pyr).'
