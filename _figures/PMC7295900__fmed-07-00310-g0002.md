caption: The SARS-CoV-2 transmission from bats via unknown intermediate to humans
  causes infectiousness known as COVID-19 disease. The binding of S protein to ACE2
  receptor initiates the life cycle which is then followed by conformational changes
  in the S protein, which further facilitates the fusion of viral envelope and host
  cell membrane. Following the fusion through endosomal pathway, SARS-CoV-2 then releases
  RNA into the host cell, which is translated into pp1a and pp1ab. Next, viral proteinases
  cleave the translated proteins into small products, meanwhile a series of sub-genomic
  mRNAs are produced by polymerase enzyme through discontinuous transcription, which
  are then translated into specific viral proteins. These viral proteins and genome
  RNA are assembled to form virions in Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, which are
  later transported out of the cell via vesicles. This figure was designed by updating
  and modifying the information from our previously published paper ().
