caption: a CRISPR/Cas-mediated point mutations can be achieved by base editor or HDR-mediated
  CRE swapping. In some Capsicum species, a mutated W-box in the MYB31 promoter is
  not recognized by the activator WRKY9. Base editor and CRE swapping can change the
  motif TTGGC to W-box (TTGAC), which can be bound by WRKY9, resulting in increased
  expression of MYB31 and higher pungency level. b The R6 motif insertion mediated
  by HDR confers trans-regulation by flavonoid-related MYBs, which can bind the R6-containing
  promoters of the genes encoding enzymes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway,
  resulting in enhanced expression of these genes and higher anthocyanin levels. CRE,
  cis-regulatory element; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase.
