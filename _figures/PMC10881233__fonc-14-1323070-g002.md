caption: 'Mechanism of action of cryoablation combined with immune checkpoint blockers.
  Following cryoablation, coagulative necrotic tumor tissue releases a large number
  of antigens, prompting APCs to uptake these antigens and increase the expression
  of MHC molecules and co-stimulatory ligands CD80/CD86. T lymphocyte activation requires
  two signals: Firstly, the TCR recognizes antigen peptides bound to MHC molecules
  on APCs, providing an antigen recognition signal; secondly, the co-stimulatory receptor
  CD28 on T cells binds with CD80/CD86 on APCs, transmitting a co-stimulatory signal.
  These two signals together promote the activation and proliferation of T cells.
  Activated tumor-specific T cells can recognize and destroy both local and distant
  tumor cells, realizing the immunological effect of cryoablation. (A) However, in
  the abscopal tumor tissue, the binding of PD-1 on some T cell surfaces to PD-L1
  on tumor cells inhibits co-stimulatory signals, leading to impaired proliferation
  and reduced cytotoxicity of T cells, transforming them into “exhausted” T cells,
  and thus triggering tumor immune escape. (B) The combined use of PD-1 inhibitors
  can block the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, restoring the signaling pathway and thus reviving
  the proliferative and effector capabilities of these “exhausted” T cells to achieve
  the objective of killing tumor cells'
