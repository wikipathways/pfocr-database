caption: A model for ATL-1 activation in response to replication fork stalling and
  following processing of DSBs. (A) RPA-ssDNA complexes generated following replication
  fork pausing/stalling following hydroxyurea (HU) treatment recruit ATL-1. ATL-1
  and RAD-5/CLK-2 are both required to stabilize stalled replication forks and to
  activate the S-phase checkpoint to transiently arrest the cell cycle to provide
  time to restart DNA synthesis. (B) MRE-11 is recruited to DSBs generated following
  IR-treatment. Once recruited, MRE-11 is believed to recruit ATM-1 based on studies
  in mammalian cells and also regulates DSB processing. RPA-ssDNA complexes generated
  by DSB resection recruit ATL-1. Together, ATL-1, RAD-5/CLK-2 and ATM-1 cooperate
  to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis via the cep-1/egl-1 pathway.
