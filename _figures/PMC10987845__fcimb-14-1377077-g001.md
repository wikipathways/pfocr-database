caption: Glycan biosynthesis mutants were screened for immune stimulatory properties.
  (A) Schematic of experimental flow of approach to assessing glycan assembly mutations
  on host immune recognition and response to H. pylori. (B) Schematic of putative
  glycosylation biosynthetic pathway including five genes targeted for mutation and
  their roles in glycoprotein and lipopolysaccharide assembly. GP, glycoprotein; GT,
  glycosyltransferase; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; OST, oligosaccharyltransferase; UndPP,
  undecaprenyl diphosphate. Images were created using BioRender
