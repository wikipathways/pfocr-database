caption: Biosynthesis of galactolipids in the chloroplast envelope membranes in Arabidopsis.
  The three enzyme systems are represented. The main pathway is mediated by MGD1 and
  DGD1 which provide the bulk of galactolipids for all chloroplast membranes in normal
  growth conditions. MGD2/3 and DGD2 are activated in response to Pi deprivation,
  and SFR2 is activated in response to a freezing stress. Flux of galactolipids between
  IEM and OEM are facilitated by PA-mediated contacts with N-DGD1 (as proposed by
  ). The MGD1-MGDG association in the IEM forms a HII platform that allows the transit
  of galactolipids to newly synthesized thylakoids through a non-lamellar/non-vesicular
  process (as proposed by ). This process might involve other cellular partners such
  as the IM30/VIPP1 protein (). Can MGD1, inserted in a locally non-lamellar microdomain,
  have access on one side or the other side of the IEM, or even both, has yet to be
  determined.
