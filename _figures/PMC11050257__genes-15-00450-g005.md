caption: Schematic representation of MYC protein and its signaling pathway. (A) The
  protein structure of MYC includes a transcriptional activation domain, nuclear localization
  signal (NLS), and DNA binding/MAX dimerization domain. (B) Transcriptional activation
  of MYC expression. MYC transcription is regulated by the receptor signal transduction
  pathways, including the TGFβ, TCR, RTK, and WNT pathway. (C) Regulation of transcription
  by MYC. MYC binds with Max and binds to the target DNA sequences or E-boxes (with
  the sequence 5′-CANNTG-3′), thereby controlling the transcription of genes associated
  with cell growth and proliferation
