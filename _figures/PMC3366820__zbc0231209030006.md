caption: Proposed model by which α2β1 integrin mediates doxorubicin resistance in
  T-ALL cells. Doxorubicin (Dox) activates JNK, which induces the downmodulation of
  Mcl-1 levels, thus allowing activation of the mitochondrial death pathway. Ligation
  of α2β1 integrin with ColI activates the MAPK/ERK survival pathway, which inhibits
  the ability of doxorubicin to activate JNK and subsequently to downregulate the
  levels of prosurvival Mcl-1. Maintenance of Mcl-1 levels leads to the protection
  of mitochondria and to the inhibition of cytochrome c release and caspase activation,
  and subsequently to the decrease in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.
