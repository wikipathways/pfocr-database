caption: '(A) H2A.Z in euchromatin. Euchromatic genes that are not transcribed (OFF)
  do not carry H2A.Z on their promoter. Like for any genomic region, some random nucleosomes
  may be decorated by the presence of H2A.Z (red). At euchromatic genes that are transcribed,
  a cycle of H2A.Z recruitment followed by H2A.Z-enhanced RNAPII recruitment is observed
  at the promoter. In the transcribed region, transcription promotes the depletion
  of randomly incorporated H2A.Z. The exact mechanism by which this depletion occurs
  remains unknown but we have depicted what we currently consider to be the most likely
  option, that is: dimers are removed in the front of the elongating polymerase and
  reassembled in the wake of RNAPII as previously established . We propose that dimer
  reassembly is biased toward H2A-containing dimers, leading to a depletion of H2A.Z
  from transcribed regions. (B) H2A.Z in heterochromatin. In heterochromatin, H2A.Z
  covers large regions encompassing several genes. Several H2A.Z molecules are therefore
  associated with heterochromatic genes. It is possible that the absence of transcription
  in these regions leads to this accumulation of H2A.Z via the random incorporation
  pathway. Alternatively a mechanism that specifically targets H2A.Z to heterochromatin
  may exist.'
