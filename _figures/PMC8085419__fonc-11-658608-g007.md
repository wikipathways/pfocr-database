caption: LCT-3d selectively kills gastric cancer cells but not normal cells via inducing
  ROS triggered apoptosis by activating death receptors and the mitochondria pathway.
  ROS scavenger NAC can block cell death, while Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 has no effect
  on LCT-3d-induced cell death. The promotion of ROS-induced apoptosis by LCT-3d depends
  on the up-regulation of DR5 but not the inactivation of Nrf2.
