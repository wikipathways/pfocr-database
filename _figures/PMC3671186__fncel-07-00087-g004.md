caption: Model of mechanism of repression of neurogenic bHLH transcription factors
  by BMPs. (A) In differentiating neurogenic precursors, bHLH transcription factors
  hetero-dimerizes with E proteins, which bind to E boxes and promote expression of
  neuronal genes. (B) Activation of the BMP signaling pathway leads to increased levels
  of Id and Hes proteins. Id and Hes proteins sequester E proteins away from bHLH
  transcription factors, which leads to transcriptionally inactive complexes and also
  enhance degradation of bHLH monomers. Furthermore Hes proteins can bind to N boxes
  sequences in neural promoters and recruit the Groucho family of transcriptional
  repressors.
