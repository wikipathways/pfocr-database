caption: (A) At high sterol levels, the sterol binds to Loop 1 and induces conformational
  changes in SCAP, thereby increasing its affinity for INSIG. Then, binding of SCAP
  and INSIG triggers a second conformational changes in SACP, leading to the dissociation
  of Loop1 and Loop7. This conformation prevents COPII from binding to SCAP. In addition,
  sterol is combined with INSIG to keep the stability of INSIG. These interactions
  help the INSIG/SCAP/SREBP complex to be preserved on the ER membrane. (B) In a sterol-deprived
  environment, the reduction of sterol leads to ubiquitination and rapid degradation
  of INSIG. This gives the SCAP/SREBP complex an opportunity to escape ER. Deprivation
  of sterols also triggers conformational changes that enable Loop1 to bind to Loop7,
  which allows SCAP to bind to COPII. Then, COPII transports the complex to the Golgi
  apparatus via vesicles. (C) When in the Golgi, SREBP will be continuously cleaved
  by S1P and S2P proteases, ultimately releasing the N-terminal active domain. This
  active part enters the nucleus and binds to numerous target genes of SREBP, leading
  to downstream effects.
