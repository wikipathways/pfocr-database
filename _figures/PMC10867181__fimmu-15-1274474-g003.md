caption: Hypoxia regulates the metastatic cascade. In the TME, hypoxia stimulates
  EMT, metastasis, and vascularization. Briefly, hypoxia stimulates the vascularization
  via influencing SCF, LOX, SDF-1, VEGF, PDGF, ANGPTL-4, and Ang2 genes, participates
  in metastasis by establishing a metastatic niche and modulating the expression of
  LOX, CAIX, MMPs, and SDF-1/CXCR4, and increase the expression of Twist, Slug, TCF3,
  Snail, ZEB1, and Smads transcription factors to affect the mobility and plasticity
  of tumor cells to undergo EMT. Meanwhile, hypoxia activates the HIF1α, which induces
  the transcription factors involved in EMT through various signaling pathways. Additionally,
  hypoxia-regulated EMT and vascularization also participate in metastasis by increasing
  cell motility and plasticity and enhancing permeabilization for metastatic tumor
  cells, respectively. EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; HIF, hypoxia-inducible
  factor
