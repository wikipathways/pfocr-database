caption: The role of NAMPT in mammalian NAD metabolism. (a) The salvage of NAD (red
  labels) is predominantly by NAMPT, the rate-limiting formation of NMN from NAM and
  α-D-5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). NMN is converted to NAD by three isoforms
  of NMN adenylyltransferase (NMNAT, EC 2.7.7.1). NMN can also arise from phosphorylation
  of nicotinamide riboside (NR), an additional salvageable NAD precursor (nicotinamide
  riboside kinase; NRK, EC 2.7.1.22). Other ways to generate NAD include its salvage
  from NA and the de novo synthesis from L-Trp. The NAD pool needs constant replenishment
  because of NAD use (blue labels). Lifespan extension may be promoted by SIRT1 through
  FOXO/p53 deacetylation. Stress stimuli (IL-1β) enhances NAD production through NAMPT
  over-expression. Likewise, STAT 3 (through an IL-6 signaling pathway), NF-κB and
  TNFα, up-regulate nampt (red DNA). PGE2 is implicated in arthritis (via mPGES-1
  up-regulation). FK866 and GMX17778 inhibit NAMPT. (b) The pyrophosphorolysis reaction
  catalyzed by NAMPT
