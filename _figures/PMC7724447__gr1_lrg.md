caption: 'Potential role of statins and PCSK9 inhibitors in COVID-19 pathophysiology
  and complications. I) SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Statins are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2
  main protease (1). Effective cholesterol reduction by statins or PCSK9 inhibitors
  could suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection by either blocking its entry into the host cells
  or inhibiting its replication through the disruption of lipid rafts (2). II) Pneumonia
  and sepsis. Statins have been associated with improved outcomes in patients with
  viral pneumonia (3). III) Innate immunity (acute respiratory distress syndrome,
  cytokine release syndrome). Statins and PCSK9 exert immunomodulator properties (4):
  a) Statins inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme of mevalonate pathway leading to reduced
  levels of its downstream products. These are critical for GTPases mediating multiple
  steps in the immune response, such as cell migration, activation, signaling and
  cytokine production; b) Statins suppress toll-like receptor expression leading to
  an immune response shift towards anti-inflammatory response; c) Statins stabilize
  the levels of MyD88 after a proinflammatory trigger, such as hypoxia, and attenuate
  the activation of NF-κB; d) Statin-induced up-regulation of ACE2 receptors potentially
  ameliorates the cytokine release due to the increased production of angiotensin
  1–7; e) The over-expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors by statins and
  PCSK9 inhibitors could increase endotoxin clearance and inhibit the initiation of
  an unbridle systemic inflammatory response; f) Statins have been associated with
  better outcomes in patients with hyper-inflammatory acute respiratory distress syndrome;
  g) PCSK9 loss-of-function (LOF) genetic variants have been associated with improved
  survival in septic shock patients and a decrease in inflammatory cytokine response
  both in septic shock patients and healthy volunteers after lipopolysaccharide administration.
  IV) Cardiovascular complications. Statins and PCSK9 inhibitors are associated with
  improved endothelial function, reduced oxidative stress, less platelet adhesion
  (5) and increased atherosclerotic plaque stability (6). Statins may protect against
  heart failure development (7) and exert anti-arrhythmic properties (8). V) Thromboembolic
  complications. Human and experimental studies suggest that both statins and PCSK9
  inhibitors exert antithrombotic properties (9). Abbreviations: ACE2, angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; GTPases, hydrolases of nucleotide
