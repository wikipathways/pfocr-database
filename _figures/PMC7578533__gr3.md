caption: The Nrf2 pathway. In the absence of oxidative stress the basal levels of
  Nrf2 are very low. Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm through its association
  with the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) which constitutively targets
  Nrf2 for ubiquitin dependent protein degradation. Oxidative stress modifies cysteine
  residues in Keap1 resulting in the release of Nrf2 from ubiquitination. Subsequently,
  Nrf2 is able to translocate to the nucleus and induce transcription of genes which
  contain the binding site, antioxidant response element (ARE) in their promoter.
