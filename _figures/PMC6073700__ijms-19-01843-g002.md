caption: The SOCS proteins mechanisms of GHR-JAK2-STAT pathway inhibition. The SOCS1,
  2, 3 and CIS have the same mechanism of phosphorylation inhibition of STAT by competitive
  binding to phosphotyrosines of the GHR. The SOCS1 and SOCS3, because of the KIR
  domain presence, can act also in a different manner. Both of them can bind to JAK2;
  however, SOCS1 can bind directly to JAK2 inhibiting its enzymatic activity and SOCS3
  before binding to JAK2 requires binding to GHR, which leads to degradation of the
  GHR-JAK2 complex directly or indirectly by ubiquitination. Another mechanism of
  SOCS1 and SOCS3 action is dependent on the PIM-1 protein, which probably stabilizes
  their phosphorylation and prolongs their inhibitory action. CIS, SOCS—suppressors
  of cytokine signaling; Box 1—proline-rich domain; GHR—growth hormone receptor; JAK2—Janus
  kinase 2; FERM—N-terminal 4.1, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin domain; KIR—kinase inhibitory
  region; P—phosphorylation marker; PIM-1—proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein
  kinase; STAT—signal transducer and activator of transcription; Ub—ubiquitination.
