caption: Hyperglycemia, derangement of cell metabolism and oxidative/nitrosative stress.
  Hyperglycemia associates with accumulation of fructose-6-phosphate and hexosamine
  pathway (1) to N-acetylglucosamine, accumulation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and
  associated activation of PKC (2), activation of polyol sugar pathway (3), and glucose
  autoxidation and non-enzymatic protein glycation (4). These metabolic events are
  either regular physiologically important components cell metabolism (1, 2 and 3)
  or are normally under strict control of intrinsic intracellular defense mechanisms
  (4). However, under conditions of chronic hyperglycemia activation of these pathways
  leads to a global derangement of the cell and tissue homeostasis, which culminates
  in an uncontrolled cascade of abnormal protein modifications, oxidative/nitrosative
  stress and pro-inflammatory conditions.
