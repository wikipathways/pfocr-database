caption: 'Phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways. Enzymes and representative reactions
  of each major pathway branch are shown. In all panels, capital letters marked with
  asterisks designate corresponding panels of  for structurally characterized pathway
  enzymes, and color indicates highly represented enzyme classes: cytochrome P450-catalyzed
  reactions are highlighted in red, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) reactions
  are green, and O-methyltransferase (OMT) reactions are lavender. (A) The general
  phenylpropanoid pathway leading from phenylalanine to p-coumaroyl-CoA, the entry
  point to each major downstream pathways. Additional offshoot product classes are
  indicated. (B) Monolignol biosynthetic grid leading to polymeric lignin, oligomeric
  lignans, and monomeric phenylpropenes. Newly discovered ‘third dimension’ shown
  in blue. Monolignol end products are in shadowed boxes. (C) Structurally characterized
  lignan reductase reactions. (D) Flavonoid pathway leading to anthocyanin pigments,
  isoflavonoid ‘phytoestrogens’, polymeric phlobaphenes and condensed tannins, and
  various antimicrobial phytoalexins. Related biosynthesis of resveratrol is also
  shown.'
