caption: Visualization of DEGs involved in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  signaling pathway. Each box depicts DEGs from four treatments vs. control comparisons
  thus divided into four segments, the left half represents Sp-R treatment vs. control
  with first segment (left) 24 hpi and second 48 hpi. The right half is depicts Sp-S
  treatment vs. control with first segment (left) 24 hpi and second (right) 48 hpi.
  White box or no color fill means no DEG was assigned to that KO term. Color gradient
  represents log2 fold ratios with red representing upregulation and blue representing
  downregulation in treatments vs. mock samples. White segment in between colors means
  that term was not differentially expressed in the respective comparison.
