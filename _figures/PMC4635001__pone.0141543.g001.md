caption: In contrast to the mammalian fatty acid synthesis pathway in which reactions
  are catalysed by a single protein (FAS or FASN), each acyltransferase, condensation,
  reduction, and dehydration reaction of the fatty acid synthesis pathway of Yersinia
  pestis is catalysed by a discrete enzyme (highlighted green). FabG (highlighted
  blue with red lettering) is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed enzyme,
  which performs the first of two reduction reactions within the pathway. Homologues
  from other organisms are not highlighted. Image adapted from the KEGG PATHWAY database
