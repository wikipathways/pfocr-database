caption: '(A) Activation of the kallikrein-kinin system Top: The scheme depicts platelet-derived
  polyphosphates (PolyP) acting (intravascularly) as endogenous activators of the
  KKS (contact phase of coagulation). The proteolytic cascade is initiated as the
  negatively charged PolyP (long chains) bind to (i) FXII and (ii) HK, via the histidine-rich
  (D5) domain. PolyP-induced conformational changes in FXII lead to its autocatalytic
  cleavage. FXIIa then cleaves the plasma kallikrein (PK) zymogen, generating PKa.
  After several cycles of reciprocal activation between PKa/FXIIa, FXIIa activates
  FXI, the downstream effector of the intrinsic coagulation pathway, whereas PKa cleaves
  HK, releasing the internal nonapeptide bradykinin (BK, green rectangle). In inflammatory
  conditions, the plasma-borne HK/LK diffuse through post-capillary venules. As the
  extravascular levels of kininogens rise, these kinin-precursor molecules undergo
  cleavage by tissue kallikrein (TK), which liberates the decapeptide lysyl-BK. Acting
  by the paracrine mode, the intact form of kinins (BK or Lysyl-BK) binds at high-affinity
  to BK2R, a subtype of BKR that is constitutively expressed in a broad range of cell
  types. Bottom: The scheme depicts the activation requirements of BK1R, a GPCR subtype
  whose expression is strongly upregulated in inflamed/damaged tissues. Generation
  of high-affinity ligands for the inducible BK1R depends on metabolic processing
  of the intact kinins (BK or lysyl-BK) by the metallopeptidase kininase I (carboxypeptidase
  N or membrane-bound carboxypeptidase M). (B) BK1R is an inducible gateway for T.
  cruzi entry in cardiovascular cells. T. cruzi relies on the enzymatic versatility
  of the major lysosomal cysteine protease (cruzipain) to release LBK from HK molecules
  docked to the host cell surfaces via binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Once
  released, the short-lived lysyl-BK is rapidly processed by membrane-bound carboxypeptidase
  M, generating [des-Arg]-lysyl-BK, which then enhances parasite infectivity through
  the signaling of the inducible BK1R.'
