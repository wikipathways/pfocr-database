caption: Possible pathways involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and cell apoptosis.
  (a) Angiogenesis pathway in non-treated tumor cells. (1) Tumor cells secrete VEGF
  into the extracellular matrix and then bind to VEGFR on endothelial cells to activate
  the NFAT signaling cascade for VEGF-induced angiogenesis. (2) VEGFR pathway activates
  phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and releases calcium via inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)
  to activate calcineurin (CaN) activity via calmodulin (a calcium-binding protein).
  Activated CaN regulates NFAT dephosphorylation to enter into nucleus to regulate
  cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression that can stimulate angiogenesis process.
  (3) VEGF-mediated angiogenesis induces more VEGF secretion for blood vessel formation.
  (b) Anti-angiogenesis pathway in M1S9-treated tumor cells. (4) M1S9 extract might
  inhibit CaN activity without inducing NFAT pathway. As a consequence, it will limit
  (5) VEGF release from tumor cell and limit (6) the dimer formation of VEGF to VEGF-R.
  (c) Apoptosis pathway in M1S9-treated tumor cells. (7) M1S9 extract activates caspase-8
  in tumor cell that govern the apoptosis pathway (adapted and modified from Zhao
  et al., 2016).
