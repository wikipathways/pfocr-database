caption: Gene network analysis of DE genes in the infected group. (A) Genes that were
  significantly up-regulated. (B) Genes that were significantly down-regulated. IL-17A
  and IL-17F are two homologs in the IL-17 family. Light green lines represent connection
  between genes co-mentioned in an abstract in published studies, cyan lines represent
  putative pathway connections found in homologs in other species, black lines represent
  co-expression in Bos taurus or homologs in other species and pink lines represent
  experimentally determined association.
