caption: The role of FOXO1 and FOXO3 in regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  and autophagy in pancreatic cancer. Sirt1-mediated deacetylation of FOXO1 and FOXO3
  can activate themselves, leading to their nuclear translocation and promoting autophagy.
  SIRT1 deficiency can induce NF-κB signaling in pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia
  muscles, enhance Nox4 transcription, and induce FOXO expression. In the nucleus,
  FOXO1 and FOXO3 bind to β-catenin to inhibit its transcriptional activity. LINC01197,
  as a target gene of FOXO1, can also bind to β-catenin to inhibit Wnt / β-catenin
  signaling. In addition to transcription of autophagy-related proteins, acetylated
  FOXO1 can directly bind to ATG7 to induce autophagy
