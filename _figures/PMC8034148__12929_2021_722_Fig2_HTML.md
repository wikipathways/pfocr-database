caption: 'Regulatory mechanism of necroptosis. Under ischemic conditions, TNF-α activated
  TNFR1 then triggered the assembly of complex I. The activation of caspase-8 would
  result in cardiomyocyte loss through apoptosis pathway while, the inactivation of
  caspase-8 in complex Iib induced the phosphorylation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 and formed
  pro-necrotic complexes or necrosomes. Then, the activated p-RIPK3 would phosphorylate
  MLKL to p-MLKL which will be translocated from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane
  and mediate membrane breakdown, leading to necroptotic cell death. Under prolongation
  of ischemic insult, the impairment of the autophagic machinery leads to accumulation
  of p62 which causes necroptosis dependent cell death. In addition, the intervention
  with several cell death modulators could improve cardiomyocyte viability under ischemic
  conditions. Pan-Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD acts as an effective caspase inhibitor resulting
  in prevention of apoptosis. Necroptosis is inhibited by Nec-1 which inhibits the
  activity of RIPK1 while Alliin prevents necroptosis cell death by mitigating necroptosis
  markers. TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α; TNFR1: tumor necrosis factor receptor 1;
