caption: Structure and function of CcO. (a) The H-pathway, comprising a water channel
  (blue line) and a hydrogen-bond network (red arrow), is the pathway for proton pumping.
  An electron from Cyt.c is accepted at CuA and transferred to heme a3 via heme a.
  Protons stored in the proton pool (highlighted in light blue) are obtained from
  the N-side of CcO via the water channel. (b) Structure of the Cyt.c-CcO complex.
  CcO is shown as a black Cα trace, Cyt.c as a light blue ribbon drawing and heme
  as a red stick model. (c) The reaction cycle of CcO comprises six steps. In the
  R-state the proton pool obtains four protons via the water channel. A proton is
  then transferred from the proton pool to the P-side of CcO via the hydrogen-bond
  network upon electron transfer at each step of the reaction step from the P- to
  F-, F- to O-, O- to E- and E- to R-states.
