caption: 'Stress and depression drive an increase in corticotropin releasing factor
  (CRF) that activates mucosal mast cells and leads to an increase in gut permeability,
  coupled to gut dysbiosis and decreased butyrate production. This drives alterations
  in the gut-liver and gut-cardiac axes, with a decrease in butyrate’s histone deacetylase
  (HDAC) inhibitory activity regulating CYP1B1. Increased gut permeability also drives
  an increase in oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which activate tryptophan
  2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), leading to a driving
  of tryptophan down the kynurenine pathway, with a resultant decrease in serotonin,
  N-acetylserotonin (NAS) and melatonin synthesis. An increase in the NAS/melatonin
  ratio from CYP1B1 and probably mGluRgpI, P2Y1 receptor, CYP2C19 and O-demethylation
  leads to NAS activation of TrkB, as well as brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF)
  induction, in turn increasing cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-response
  element binding protein (CREB) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways,
  which all contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The suppression of melatonin
  drives alterations in mitochondria, including via melatonin’s interactions with
  the sirtuins and PGC-1α, with consequences for IDH2 and AMPK-mTOR regulation of
  mitochondria. Alterations in the gut drive changes in the gut-liver and gut-cardiac
  axes that, along with kynurenine activation of the AhR raises CYP1B1 levels. CYP1B1
  may also contribute to LVH via the hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and 6β-HT.
  A number of microRNAs known to be altered in LVH, including miR-7, miR-375 and miR-451,
  all act to regulate 14-3-3 and therefore the stabilization of AANAT at the start
  of the melatonergic pathway. Similar processes can underpin hypertension, which
  is the major driver of LVH. 6β-HT: 6β-hydroxytestosterone; AANAT: aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase;
