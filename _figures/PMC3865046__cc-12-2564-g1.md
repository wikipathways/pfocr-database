caption: Figure 1. Checkpoint activation and regulation of the replisome complex.
  (A) The replication checkpoint in fission yeast. Replication stress activates the
  Rad3-dependent checkpoint pathway, which is mediated by Mrc1 and the Swi1-Swi3 FPC.
  Rad3 sends a checkpoint signal to downstream checkpoint effector Cds1 to arrest
  the cell cycle and facilitate DNA repair pathways. Functional human homologs are
  indicated in parentheses. (B) SCFPof3-dependent replisome ubiquitination in response
  to replication stress. Natural impediments generate replication stress that activates
  SCFPof3 and ubiquitinates several replisome components for degradation. Replication
  stress also causes RPA accumulation, leading to checkpoint activation.
