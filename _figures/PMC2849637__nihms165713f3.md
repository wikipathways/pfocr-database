caption: Metabolic pathways active in proliferating cells are directly controlled
  by signaling pathways involving known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. This
  schematic shows our current understanding of how glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation,
  the pentose phosphate pathway, and glutamine metabolism are interconnected in proliferating
  cells. This metabolic wiring allows for both NADPH production and acetyl-CoA flux
  to the cytosol for lipid synthesis. Key steps in these metabolic pathways can be
  influenced by signaling pathways known to be important for cell proliferation. Activation
  of growth factor receptors leads to both tyrosine kinase signaling and PI3K activation.
  Via AKT, PI3K activation stimulates glucose uptake and flux through the early part
  of glycolysis. Tyrosine kinase signaling negatively regulates flux through the late
  steps of glycolysis, making glycolytic intermediates available for macromolecular
  synthesis as well as supporting NADPH production. Myc drives glutamine metabolism,
  which also supports NADPH production. LKB1/AMPK signaling and p53 decrease metabolic
  flux through glycolysis in response to cell stress. Decreased glycolytic flux in
  response to LKB/AMPK or p53 may be an adaptive response to shut off proliferative
  metabolism during periods of low energy availability or oxidative stress. Tumor
  suppressors are shown in red, and oncogenes are in green. Key metabolic pathways
  are labeled in purple with white boxes, and the enzymes controlling critical steps
  in these pathways are shown in blue. Some of these enzymes are candidates as novel
  therapeutic targets in cancer. Malic enzyme refers to NADP+-specific malate dehydrogenase
  [systematic name (S)-malate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating)].
