caption: Proposed mechanism of the inhibitory process. The novel polysaccharide derived
  from algae extract upregulates the phosphorylation of JNK, activates the downstream
  cascades of p53, caspase-9 and caspase-3, and then leads to the inhibition of cancer
  cell proliferation, induces cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. By contrast, the
  polysaccharide does not affect the cancer cell migration, which is mediated through
  the p38 MAPK signaling pathway or the downstream MMP-9/MMP-2. JNK, Jun N-terminal
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.

  via JNK, not via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.
