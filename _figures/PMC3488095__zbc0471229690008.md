caption: 'A model for SAHA mediated effects on α1AT folding and trafficking. In non-treated
  conditions (left panel) Z-α1AT can be recovered in 4 pools. These include: 1) the
  pool being actively managed through the calnexin cycle (orange circles); 2) the
  major (>85%) pool targeted for degradation by the ERAD pathway (including its links
  to EDEM3-OS9-SEL1L) after hand-off from calnexin (blue circles); 3) a minor but
  cumulative toxic aggregated pool triggering liver disease (clustered black circles)
  (, , –); 4), an inefficiently secreted but partially active polymeric Z-α1AT pool
  that can be found in serum of Z-variant patients (clustered orange circles in Golgi
  and extracellular pools) (). After SAHA treatment (right panel), we suggest that
  Z-α1AT is redistributed between the various pools to promote export. We observe
  a decrease in the ER retained Z-α1AT accompanied by an increase in the ERAD pathway
  as well as increased secretion of a functional form Z-α1AT (green circles). We suggest
  that the HDACi SAHA promotes remodeling of the ER proteostasis network either transcriptionally
  and/or post-translationally (PTM) to partially restore the secretion of functional
  Z-α1AT.'
