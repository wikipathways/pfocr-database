caption: Hypothetical model illustrating the idea that diabetes mellitus induces Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD) pathology and cognitive dysfunction. Both type I and type II diabetes
  mellitus (DM) eventually cause aberrant insulin signaling. Histopathological evidence
  in animal model studies suggest that DM aggravates both β-amyloid protein (Aβ) and
  tau pathology via aberrant insulin signaling, leading to neurodegeneration. Several
  studies show that aberrant insulin signaling also causes cognitive dysfunction by
  itself. That may be why DM patients exhibit greater susceptibility toward developing
  AD. Modification of the insulin signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic
  target for preventing cognitive dysfunction in DM and AD patients. Red arrow, increase
  or upregulation; blue arrow, decrease or downregulation.
