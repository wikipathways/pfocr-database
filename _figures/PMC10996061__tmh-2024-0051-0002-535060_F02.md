caption: 'Impact of amotosalen/UVA treatment on phosphoproteome signaling and platelet
  pathways. The treatment clearly upregulated the MAPK signaling pathway and inhibited
  the myosin light chain (MLC) protein involved in regulation of actin cytoskeleton.
  Each phosphosite is represented in specific color based on the significance, red
  for upregulation and blue for downregulation after treatment, as defined in Fig.
  1. Unknown: impact of the expression on protein activation is unknown, but the phosphosite
  is known'
