caption: Differentiation of T helper (Th17) Cells and Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) signaling
  pathway. Th17 cells arise from the differentiation of naïve cluster of differentiation
  4+ (CD4+) T cells following stimulation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This
  process is driven by the combined action of interleukin-6 (IL-6)and transforming
  growth factor-beta (TGF-β). IL-6 binds to its receptor (IL-6 receptor, IL-6R), activating
  the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3)
  signaling pathway and resulting in the phosphorylation of STAT3. Simultaneously,
  TGF-β engages its receptor to induce the phosphorylation of SMAD2. Once phosphorylated,
  STAT3 (p-STAT3) and SMAD family member 2 (SMAD2; p-SMAD2) translocate to the nucleus,
  where they cooperate with the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor-related
  orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) to bind the IL-17 promoter and initiate IL-17A transcription.
  Upon secretion, IL-17A binds to its receptor complex (IL-17RA/IL-17RC), triggering
  downstream signaling cascades. The intracellular similar expression to fibroblast
  growth factor genes/IL-17 receptor (SEFIR)domain of the receptor interacts with
  the SEFIR motif on the nuclear factor kappa B activator 1 (Act1) adaptor protein.
  Act1 then recruits tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and
  TRAF2/5, which bind to its TRAF-binding sites, activating the classical nuclear
  factor kappa B (NF-κB) and MAPK signaling pathways. These pathways collectively
  amplify the pro-inflammatory responses mediated by IL-17A. These signaling cascades
  ultimately contribute to glial cell activation and BBB disruption, key processes
  in IL-17A-mediated neuro-inflammation
