caption: Noncanonical WNT pathway signaling. The WNT signaling pathway activates proteins
  that promote the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and cell differentiation.
  These two processes cause the activation of HSCs, which will cause liver damage
  if the stimulation persists. However, SFRP5 is able to inhibit the WNT signaling
  pathway, so the pathway is inactivated, so the liver is protected. PLC, phospholipase
