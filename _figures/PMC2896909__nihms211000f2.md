caption: Diagram showing some key features of AQP2 recycling. AQP2 recycles via a
  constitutive pathway through a trans-Golgi and/or the recycling endosome. Inhibiting
  clathrin-mediated endocytosis induces apical accumulation of AQP2 in a VP-independent
  manner. Upon VP interaction with the basolateral (V2R), cAMP elevation activates
  protein kinase A (PKA) and AQP2 phosphorylation increases on residues S256, S264
  and S269. Increased activity of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC), for example via
  nitric oxide, also results in AQP2 phosphorylation and membrane accumulation. The
  MAP kinase pathway is essential for hypertonicity-induced AQP2 surface accumulation.
  AQP2 interacts with the SNARE regulatory protein Munc 18-2, and this interaction
  may be regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylated AQP2 at the plasma membrane
  is located in endocytosis-resistant domains; its interaction with hsc70, which is
  involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, is inhibited. Non-phosphorylated AQP2
  interacts strongly with hsc70 and this may lead to AQP2 accumulation in clathrin
  coated pits, followed by endocytosis. MAL, the myeloid and lymphocyte associated
  protein, is also involved in AQP2 endocytosis by an as yet unknown mechanism. In
  addition, the actin cytoskeleton is centrally involved in AQP2 trafficking – actin
  depolymerization alone results in cell surface accumulation of AQP2 - but whether
  the endocytotic or exocytotic pathway is involved remains uncertain (Adapted from
  ref. ).
