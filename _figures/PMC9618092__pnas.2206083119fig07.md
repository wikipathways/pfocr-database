caption: A summary graphic of the proposed mechanism by which ABCA7 dysfunction is
  associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. (1) A reduction
  in expression/activity of ABCA7 is associated with an increase in AD risk, as well
  as a reduction in blood-plasma concentrations of lactosylceramides. In our putative
  mechanism, we rationalize this with a reduction in the flux of lipids through ABCA7.
  (2) ABCA7 has more affinity to export phosphatidylserines (PSs) than phosphatidylcholines
  (PCs) across the plasma membrane compared with other ABCA lipid transporters (e.g.,
  ABCA1) (). With a reduction in the function of ABCA7, intracellular concentrations
  of PSs increase relative to PCs. (3) As PSs accumulate intracellularly, so does
  serine (PS is broken down to CDP-glycerol and serine). Serine and palmitoyl-coenzyme
  A (CoA) form 3-sphinganine at the start of the ceramide synthesis pathway. (4) In
  the ceramide pathway, 3-sphinganine is synthesized in the ER, which after some steps
  is converted into ceramides and, in subsequent steps, glucosylceramides and lactosylceramides
  in the Golgi apparatus. At this stage, there is a branch point. (A1) Ceramides,
  glucosylceramides, and lactosylceramides can all form lipid rafts () in the plasma
  membrane. (A2) Lipid rafts encourage interactions between β-site APP cleaving enzyme
  1 (BACE1) and amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) to make amyloid-β, which ultimately
  forms plaques (). (B) Ceramides are broken down to sphingosine in the ER, a precursor
  for sphingosine-1-phosphate via SPHK1, both of which are increased in inflammation
  as well as induce inflammation in a feedforward step. Because of disrupted PS metabolism
  and a failure in exporting PS to the extracellular space, blood concentrations of
  lactosylceramide decrease.
