caption: Model of the role of BANK1 in B cell signaling. BANK1 is primarily expressed
  in B cells and is involved in B cell signaling pathways. During BCR activation,
  BANK1 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and binds the Src family kinases LYN and BLK
  (1-2) []. BANK1 also interacts with PLC-γ2 [], regulating BCR-induced calcium mobilization.
  BANK1 attenuates CD40-mediated AKT activation (4) []. Following the PI3K/AKT pathway,
  the transcription factors FOXO1 and AICDA appear to increase in subjects with BANK1
  risk variants, resulting in an increase in plasma cells, memory B cells, and germinal
  center B cells (5) []. BANK1 interacts with TRAF6 and MyD88 through endosomal TLR7
  activation (6), triggering an IRF7-dependent production of IFNα and several proinflammatory
  cytokines. In the absence of exon 2, in BANK1–D2, there is a significant decrease
  in binding to MyD88 compared to BANK1–FL []. Finally, BANK1 binds to TRAF6, forming
  a complex with the sequestosome protein p62 and the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD.
  In these structures, BANK1 promotes TRAF6 sequestration, diminishing IRF5 activation
  and type I IFN induction, and this is modified by a mutation in the amino acid position
  40 in exon 2 (W40C) (7) [].
