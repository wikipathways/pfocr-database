caption: Human EGC can produce PUFA metabolites derived from n-3 or n-6. Among the
  21 mediators secreted by human EGC, only two by-products of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2),
  15dPGJ2 and 11βPGF2α were misproduced by CD EGC that express less L-PGDS and AKR1C3
  but the same level of COX1 and COX2. 15dPGJ2 and 11βPGF2α glial production regulates
  IEB healing through PPARg and DP2 dependent pathway.
