caption: Multiple promising targets for regulating cancer metabolism. Targets for
  cancer metabolism are divided into two primary groups, including bio-catabolism
  (bio-energetics) and bio-anabolism. Although increased glycolysis, termed the Warburg
  effect, contributes to cancer growth through biomass production, the main energy
  source of cancer remains unknown. The inhibition of anabolism may induce cancer
  cell death. However, the mechanism of cell death is unclear. Notably, all targets
  are context-dependent and do not work for all cancers. Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate;
  LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; ME1, NADP-dependent malic enzyme; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; Ser, serine; OAA, oxaloacetic
  acid; GLS1, kidney type glutaminase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle, Kreb cycle;
  THF, tetrahydofolate; CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferase; 3-PG, 3-phospho-glycerate;
  Gly, glycine; ACSS, acetyl CoA synthase; FASN, fatty acid synthase; ACLY, ATP-citrate
  lyase.
