caption: The RAF/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways are shown. Proangiogenic
  and proliferative growth factors activate the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. The small GTPase
  RAS and the serine/threonine kinase RAF are the key molecular signal regulators.
  Intermediate signaling is regulated by MEK, which is responsible for phosphorylating
  and activating the final downstream signaling ERK molecules. ERK regulates cellular
  activity, indirect inducers of gene expression, and transcription factors in the
  AP-1 family such as c-JUN and c-FOS and cell cycle-related kinases. Binding of these
  growth factors to their receptors also activates PI3K, which subsequently produces
  the lipid second messenger, and in turn activates serine/threonine kinase AKT. Activated
  AKT also phosphorylates several cytoplasmic proteins, most notably mTOR. The activation
  of mTOR increases cellular proliferation, and inactivation of BAD decreases apoptosis
  and increases cell survival. This pathway is negatively regulated by the phosphatase
  and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), which targets the lipid products
  of PI3K for dephosphorylation.
