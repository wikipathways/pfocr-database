caption: Model for regulation of PtdIns(3,5)P2synthesis and degradation. PtdIns is
  phosphorylated by the PtdIns 3-kinase Vps34 to generate PtdIns(3)P, which is essential
  for vacuolar protein sorting through interactions with FYVE and PX domain-containing
  proteins. PtdIns(3)P can be further phosphorylated by the PtdIns(3)P 5-kinase Fab1
  to produce PtdIns(3,5)P2. Fab1 kinase activity is regulated by the upstream activator
  Vac7. The generation of PtdIns(3,5)P2 is essential for the maintenance of vacuolar
  size control and homeostasis through interactions with unknown effectors. Fig4,
  through its Sac1 polyphosphoinositide phosphatase domain, functions with Sj12 and
  Sjl3, in regulating PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels by mediating the turnover of this lipid.
