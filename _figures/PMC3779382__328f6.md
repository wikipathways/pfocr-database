caption: Therapeutic modulation of EBV infection and associated signaling pathways.
  Strategies to inactivate EBV infection or EBV-associated oncogenic pathways have
  been explored in lymphoma cells. Many therapeutic targets have been identified.
  (1) Conventional chemotherapeutic agents or radiation target DNA. (2) Different
  strategies disrupting miRNAs can be offered. (3) EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells
  are engineered and reinfused to patients as immunoregulatory therapy approach. (4)
  Lytic cycle of EBV is induced by a couple of agents, and antiherpetic agents targeting
  virus in lytic cycle are added. Agents targeting the (5) NF-κB pathway, (6), PI3K/Akt
  pathway, (7) PKC pathway, or (8) MAPK pathway can be tried. Monoclonal antibodies,
  Brentuximab vedotin and Rituximab, are available targeting for (9) CD30 and (10)
  CD20, respectively.
