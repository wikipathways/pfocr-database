caption: a | Organismal view. In model organisms, synthetic lethality describes the
  genetic interaction between two genes. If either gene is mutated by itself, the
  organism remains viable. The combination of a mutation in both genes is incompatible
  with viability and results in lethality. b | Pathway view. Two genes are considered
  to be synthetic lethal when they contribute to an essential process. For example,
  when either gene ‘A’, ‘B’ or ‘C’, or gene ‘1’, ‘2’ or ‘3’ is mutated, the organism
  or cell remains viable. However, the combination of these mutations (‘A’, ‘B’ or
  ‘C’ with ‘1’, ‘2’ or ‘3’) results in death.
