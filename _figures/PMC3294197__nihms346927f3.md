caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of genes that are differentially methylated (P<1.8
  × 10−6) between normal mucosa of cancer patients and controls. Genes in shaded symbols
  denoted by a star are significantly more methylated in cancer patients; genes in
  shaded symbols without a star are significantly less methylated in cancer patients.
  The top functions of this network are lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry,
  cellular growth and proliferation.
