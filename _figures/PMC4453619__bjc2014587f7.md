caption: Molecular genetic model (adapted from ; ; ; ). This in silico model is highly
  simplified and points out the crucial essentials of our results. (Top, left; canonical
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway) The destruction complex Axin1 leads to the phosphorylation
  of β-catenin. Phosphorylated β-catenin is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase
  and then degraded proteasomally (off-status). The activation of the two receptors
  FZD and LRP5 by Wnt leads to membrane recruitment of the destruction complex. The
  E3 ubiquitin ligase is no longer able to ubiquitinate β-catenin of membrane-associated
  Axin1 (on-status). Consequently, the cytoplasmatic amount of β-catenin increases.
  MiR-23a and miR-24 lead to the downregulation of FZD5. Subsequently, Wnt cannot
  adhere to its receptors, the signal transduction is precluded and the Wnt/β-catenin
  signalling pathway remains in its off-status. In this case, the β-catenin phosphorylation,
  ubiquitination and degradation take place without any regulatory inhibition. The
  cytoplasmatic β-catenin amount decreases. Consequently, two inverse effects seem
  to occur. First, the lack of cytoplasmatic β-catenin could result in the destabilisation
  of catenation between the cadherin–catenin complex and the actin cytoskeleton. This
  could be responsible for the observed loss of cell polarity in the cell lines of
  group A. Second, an increase of cytoplasmatic β-catenin leads to an increase of
  nuclear β-catenin as well. βeta-catenin bound to TCF/LEF acts as a negative transcription
  factor (). It suppresses the expression of E-cadherin. Subsequently, the decrease
  of β-catenin leads to an increased expression of E-cadherin. This function of β-catenin
  seems to be a compensatory long-term feedback mechanism to maximise the small amount
  of cytoplasmatic β-catenin trying to restabilise the connection between the CCC
  and the cytoskeleton. (Bottom, right) Further, this attempt of compensatory feedback
  mechanism could be abrogated by the simultaneous downregulation of HNF1B. The expression
  of E-cadherin is enhanced by HNF1B serving as a positive transcription factor ().
  Thus, our results emphasise that the upregulation of miR-24 leads to the downregulation
  of HNF1B followed by decreased expression of E-sadherin with the loss of cell polarity.
  (Top, right; CCC) The cadherin–catenin complex (CCC) forms homologous cell–cell
  adhesion. The CCC includes the stable membrane-associated β-catenin pool. The E3
  ubiquitin ligase leads to the ubiquitination of E-cadherin. Previous to the following
  endosomal degradation of E-cadherin, β-catenin dissociates from E-cadherin. Subsequently,
  the cytoplasmatic pool of β-catenin increases. We suppose that, most likely, TMEM92
  interacts competitively with the E3 ubiquitin ligase and stabilises the amount of
  the CCC. MiR-24 leads to the downregulation of TMEM92. Downregulated TMEM92 fails
  to block the E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, E-cadherin degradation is increased.
  The amount of E-cadherin decreases, cytoplasmatic β-catenin increases after dissociation,
  and the CCC and intercellular adhesion are destabilised. Possibly, the increase
  of dissociated β-catenin is immediately intercepted, because the same mechanism
  leads to a decreased pool of cytoplasmatic β-catenin. By competitive binding, TMEM92
  inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase and consequently blocks β-catenin degradation.
  Thus, the gene silencing of TMEM92 by the upregulation of miR-24 appears to increase
  the degradation of β-catenin as well as E-cadherin. This mechanism also leads to
  the destabilisation of the CCC.
