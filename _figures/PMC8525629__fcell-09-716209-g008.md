caption: The role of exosomal miR-500 in the communication between macrophages and
  HSCs. In LPS-treated macrophages, miR-500 was highly expressed and then included
  into the multivesicular endosomes, which were secreted into intercellular space.
  After these exosomes being uptaken by recipient cells, the miR-500 in exosomes would
  inhibit the expression MFN2 by binding with its 3′ UTR, consequently promoting the
  proliferation and activation of HSC via TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway and accelerating
  liver fibrosis.
