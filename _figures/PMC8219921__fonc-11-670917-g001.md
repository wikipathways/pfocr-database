caption: A schematic illustration of the crosstalk between lncRNAs and Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway involved in the modulation of the sensitivity of glioma cells to chemotherapeutic
  agents. Downregulation of lncRNA H19 could promote the sensitivity of glioma cells
  to temozolomide via inhibiting EMT through the suppression of the Wnt/β-Catenin
  signaling cascade. Silencing of H19 could downregulate the expression level of β-catenin
  and its downstream targets c-myc and Survivin in temozolomide-treated glioma cells
  (). Besides, downregulating the expression of lncRNA MIR22HG could suppress the
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via loss of miR-22-3p and -5p. This could in turn
  lead to attenuating cell proliferation, invasion as well as tumor growth in glioma
  cells. MIR22HG silencing could result in downregulating the expression level of
  β-catenin, a key transcriptional regulator of Wnt, along with the inhibition of
  several Wnt downstream targets, containing c-Myc, cyclin D1, and LEF1, as well as
  a reduction in the expression of phospho-GSK3β (Ser9) in tumor cells (). Besides,
  upregulation of lncRNA MIR155HG could promote temozolomide resistance in glioma
  cells through directly regulating canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation via
  binding to PTBP1 in tumor cells ().
