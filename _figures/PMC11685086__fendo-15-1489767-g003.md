caption: Nanotechnology and immunotherapy for ovarian cancer (OC) targeting FSHR.
  Follicle-stimulating hormone peptide (FSHP) facilitates paclitaxel nanoparticles’
  (NPs) targeting of ovarian carcinoma in vivo (14). The FSHP-NP-PTX system recognizes
  metastasic lymph nodes of ovarian cancer and can be captured by the lymph nodes
  by FSHP-NP-PTX passively targeting the lymphatic system, thereby significantly inhibiting
  cell proliferation (105). An siRNA-targeted NP delivery system with follicle-stimulating
  hormone (FSH)β 33-53 peptide as the targeting ligand inhibits the migration and
  invasion of ovarian clear cell cancer cells, which is an effective targeted therapy
  strategy for ovarian cancer and a stable delivery system for siRNA (106). FSH peptide-conjugated
  NPs with an increased amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG) grafting and encapsulated
  short hairpin RNA (shRNA) can silence the FSH target gene, growth-regulated oncogene
  α (gro-α) (107). Moli et al. (108) designed a novel FSH 33-targeting dendritic macromolecular
  nanocarrier as a potential delivery platform for OC cells that express FSHR, which
  is a highly effective active targeting medium and has the potential to block the
  FSH signaling pathway cascade while selectively delivering chemotherapy drugs, potentially
  enhancing its therapeutic effect. Preparation of ovarian cancer FSHR NP vector carrying
  therapeutic plasmid growth-regulating oncogene α (pGRO-a) short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
  (FP21-PEG-PEI/pGRO-a). A strategy to treat human ovarian cancer by redirecting primary
  human T cells to target FSHR laying a foundation for further development of FSHR-targeted
  immunotherapy (109). In addition, T-cells redirected against FSHR+ tumor cells with
  full-length FSH represent a promising therapeutic alternative against a broad range
  of ovarian malignancies, with negligible toxicity even in the presence of cognate
  targets in tumor-free ovaries (89). mAb targeting the external domain of FSHR using
  an in vivo-expressed FSHR vector and identifying an effective surface targeting
  mAb D2 AP 11 (10). DB7.2xD2AP11 DNA-encoded bispecific NK cell engager exhibits
  in vitro expression and binding to Siglec-7 and FSHR, which induces potent killing
  in multiple ovarian tumor lines and decreases tumor burden in vivo (110)
