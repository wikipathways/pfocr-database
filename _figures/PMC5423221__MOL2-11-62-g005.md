caption: The metastatic niches in the bone marrow. In order to survive, DTC reside
  in different compartments in the bone marrow, so called niche. Niche occupancy depends
  on the pro‐survival interactions between metastatic cells (orange) and host stroma
  composed of different cell types of bone marrow (red or blue). In perivascular niche,
  sprouting neovasculature promotes micrometastatic outgrowth by secretion of periostin
  by endothelial cells (red) and Wnt signaling activation in metastatic cells. Mesenchymal
  cells in HSC niche (blue) release chemokine CXCL12 that, by CXCR4 receptor binding
  in metastatic cells, signals through PI3K‐AKT pathway. SRC kinase alterations in
  DTC amplify AKT pathway activation. DTC can also interact with osteogenic cells
  (blue) by formation of heterotypic adherens junctions between N‐cadherin and expressed
  by metastatic cells E‐cadherin. Therefore, mTOR signaling is activated promoting
  tumor growth.
