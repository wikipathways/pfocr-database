caption: In light, BR signaling inhibits BIN2 activity, which induces accumulation
  of active BZR1 to promote plant growth, whereas sugar induces the phosphorylation
  of BZR1 to suppress BR signaling probably through increasing BIN2 activity by unknown
  sugar signaling pathway. The black bars and arrows indicate previously reported
  mechanisms; the blue arrow indicates findings made in this study.
