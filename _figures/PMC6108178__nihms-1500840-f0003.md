caption: All the driver mutations associated with MPN, increased TPO, MPL, JAK2V617F,
  CALR or LNK activate the JAK/STAT pathway. Calreticulin (CALR) binds to MPL and
  induces constitutive activation of JAK/STAT. Lymphocyte linker (LNK) protein, a
  member of an adaptor protein family, is required to express MPL on the cell surface
  []. Only in PMF patients, however, activation of JAK/STAT signaling results, by
  a mechanism stillvpoorly understood, in a RPS14 deficiency which leads to reduced
  GATA1 mRNA translation in megakaryocytes. Insufficient GATAI content retards megakaryocyte
  maturation increasing expression of p-selectin on their cell surface and triggering
  a process of pathological emperipolesis of neutrophils which lead to death of megakaryocytes
  by para-apoptosis. Dead megakaryocytes release TGF-ß in the microenvironment increasing
  the bioavailability of this growth factor. TGF-ß is then responsible to activate
  fibrocytes inducing bone marrow fibrosis.
