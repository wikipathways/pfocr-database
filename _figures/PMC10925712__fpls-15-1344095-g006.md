caption: Schematic model for the metabolic engineering of CHLSYN, TyrA, HPPD and HPT
  genes to achieve high seed tocochromanol contents in Arabidopsis. (A–C), three scenarios
  of combinations of different genetic backgrounds for the chlorophyll salvage pathway,
  the TyrA and HPPD pathway regulating HGA content, and the HPT expression level alter
  the balance between GGDP and PDP, resulting in tocotrienol or tocopherol synthesis,
  respectively. The thickness of the arrows represents flux through the metabolic
  pathway; the sizes of the blue, green and yellow circles showing HGA, PDP and GGDP
  contents were adjusted according to the metabolite pool size under each scenario.
  The dominating product of the pathway, i.e. tocopherol or tocotrienol, were shown
  in bold letters. According to the results, (B) scenario would be the best option,
  resulting in elevated PDP and HGA levels, as well as a favored condition for the
  tocopherol biosynthesis
