  The three major pathways for PE biosynthesis are (1) mitochondrial decarboxylation
  of PS by Psd1, (2) endosomal decarboxylation of PS by Psd2, and (3) incorporation
  of Etn via the CDP–Etn Kennedy pathway. The two major pathways for PC biosynthesis
  are (1) methylation of PE by Pem1 and Pem2 and (2) incorporation of Cho via the
  CDP–Cho Kennedy pathway. Phosphatidylserine is biosynthesized from PA in a two-step
  reaction involving CDP–DAG synthesis followed by the addition of serine by Cho1.
