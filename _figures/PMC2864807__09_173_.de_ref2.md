caption: A simplified view of differentially expressed proteins according to PPAR
  signaling pathway resulting from Pathway Express tool analysis. All the illustrated
  proteins were downregulated in Group B (CD patients with Marsh II窶的II) with respect
  to Group A (Controls and CD patients with Marsh 0窶的). Protein abbreviations correspond
  to Entrez Gene official symbols.
