caption: The main redox signaling pathways in normal HSCs. The biological functions
  of normal HSCs are closely regulated by ROS. ROS can activate the PI3K, MEK, and
  JAK signaling pathways to promote cell proliferation and differentiation. Excessively
  high ROS levels activate the p38 or p53 signaling pathway, leading to cell senescence
  and apoptosis. Additionally, ROS upregulate the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1, which
  block excessive ROS production through feedback inhibition, thus maintaining intracellular
  ROS at a normal level to maintain the quiescent state and normal function of the
  cells. This figure was drawn based on existing research data; its accuracy and more
  precise signaling mechanisms must be confirmed and supplemented by extensive, in-depth
  studies.
