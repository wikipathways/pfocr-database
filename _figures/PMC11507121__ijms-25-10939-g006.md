caption: Transcription and expression analysis of genes related to wax synthesis pathway
  in leaves of ‘Ningqi I’ goji and ‘Huangguo’ goji. Main pathways of plant wax biosynthesis
  are fatty acid de novo synthesis, fatty acid elongation, decarbonylation pathway,
  and acyl reduction pathway. Expression level gradually increased from blue to red.
  Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs); acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); palmitoyl carrier
  protein thioesterase (FATB); long-chain acyl-CoA synthase 2 (LACS2); β-ketoacyl-CoA
  synthase (KCS); ultralong-chain aldehyde decarbonylase 1 (CER1); alkane hydroxylase
  (MAH1); ultralong-chain aldehyde decarbonylase 3 (CER3); fatty acyl-CoA reductase
  2 (FAR2); wax ester synthase (WSD1). ‘N’ stands for ‘Ningqi I’ goji leaves and ‘H’
  represents ‘Huangguo’ goji leaves
