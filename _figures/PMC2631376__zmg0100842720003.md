  delivered to the brain is metabolized to pyruvate, which is translocated into the
  mitochondrion where pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase catalyze the
  balanced synthesis of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate for the net synthesis of citrate.
  Because isocitrate dehydrogenase activity is suppressed during energy surplus (and
  the cis-aconitase equilibrium lies in the direction of citrate), citrate accumulates
  and is translocated from the mitochondrion into the cytoplasm by a regulated anion
  transporter. Citrate then undergoes cleavage by ATP:ctrate lyase to produce cytoplasmic
  acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. Acetyl-CoA is poised at a metabolic branch
  point with multiple options, one being reductive chain elongation to form long-chain
  fatty acids catalyzed by FAS, a pathway initiated by the ACC-catalyzed conversion
  of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. This option is prominent during periods of energy
  surplus when ACC is maintained in the active state. During periods of energy surplus,
  ACC is held in the catalytically active state by 1) dephosphorylation and 2) feed-forward
  allosteric activation by citrate. 1) As discussed above, when the cellular [ATP]
  is elevated, [5′-AMP] is low. Because 5′-AMP is an activator of AMPK and ACC is
  an AMPK substrate, when [5′-AMP] is reduced, AMPK activity is also low. Under these
  conditions, hypothalamic ACC exists in the dephosphorylated/catalytically active
  state. It should be noted that phospho-ACC can be dephosphorylated by a protein
  phosphatase and although it is likely that this enzyme is regulated, its regulatory
  mechanism has not been elucidated. Importantly, leptin also promotes dephosphorylation,
  thus, inactivation AMPK and thereby default activation of hypothalamic ACC. Although
  the molecular mechanism by which leptin promotes dephosphorylation and inactivation
  of AMPK remains obscure, it has been shown that active glucose metabolism in the
  CNS must occur concomitantly. 2) As illustrated, cytoplasmic [citrate] would be
  expected to rise in the hypothalamus as it does in other tissues () in response
  to increased glucose flux. Citrate is a bona fide allosteric activator of ACC (,).
  Malonyl-CoA can also undergo decarboxylation catalyzed by MCD, an enzyme known to
  be present in the hypothalamus. How MCD is regulated, however, has not been elucidated.
  In physiological states of energy surplus, such as feeding after fasting, the level
  of malonyl-CoA in the hypothalamus, notably in the Arc, increases concurrently with
  marked perturbation in the state of activation of hypothalamic neurons as measured
  by changes in c-Fos expression. These changes rapidly lead to increased expression
  of the orexigenic (NPY and AgRP) neuropeptides and decreased expression of the anorexigenic
  (POMC/αMSH and CART) neuropeptides, which suppress food intake and increase energy
  expenditure (Fig. 2). The brain-specific CPT1c, a malonyl-CoA binding protein of
  unknown catalytic activity, may serve as the link between increased malonyl-CoA
  during energy surplus and the changes in expression of the hypothalamic neuropeptides.
  The molecular mechanism by which this occurs awaits elucidation of the reaction
  catalyzed by CPT1c. C75 refers to 3-carboxy-4-octyl-2-methylenebutyrolactone. Ac-CoA,
