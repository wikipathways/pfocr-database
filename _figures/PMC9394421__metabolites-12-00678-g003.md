caption: Metabolic pathway summarizing the compound-induced changes in the C. reinhardtii
  metabolome identified by NMR and GC-MS (metabolites of interest). Metabolites that
  were only identified by NMR are colored blue. Metabolites that were only identified
  by GC-MS are colored red. Metabolites identified by both methods are colored black,
  and metabolites not identified are colored grey. The total numbers of metabolites
  of interest within these metabolic pathways that were identified by either NMR,
  GC-MS, or both techniques were 14, 16 and 17 metabolites, respectively. Reprinted
