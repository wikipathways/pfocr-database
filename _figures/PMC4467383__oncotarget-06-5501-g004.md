caption: (A) Fused with NUT gene, BRD3 may encode BRD3-NUT fusion proteins in NMC,
  which is similar with BRD4. Specifically inhibiting BRD3-NUT fusion protein can
  block BRD3-NUT gene transcription, and inhibit NMC cell growth. (B) Pan-inhibitors
  I-BET762 and JQ1 inhibits BRD3. (C) As the only member of BET family can bind with
  transcription factor GATA1, inhibition of BRD3 through BRD3-GATA pathway by clinical
  experimental compound, RVX-208, may be a therapeutic strategy in hepatocellular
  carcinoma. (D) The least known BET family member, BRDT, is also been detected the
  anti-cancer capacity in leukemia by an unspecific-target drug Dinaciclib.
