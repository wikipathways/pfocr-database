caption: 'BRCAness phenotype in GBM that leads to impairment of the homologous recombination
  repair (HR) and PARPi sensitivity. (a) The mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)
  enzyme results in the newly acquired ability to produce the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate
  (2HG) that inhibits lysine-specific demethylase 4A/B (KDM4A/B), which removes methyl
  (Me) groups from histones (H). In turn, the methylated histones will hinder the
  interaction of P53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) with double-strand breaks (DSB) and
  HR repair. (b) The overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or
  the constitutively active EGFR variant III (EGFR vIII) will lead to activation of
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and consequently the activation of DNA-dependent protein
  kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) that will inactivate ATM through phosphorylation.
  (c) PTEN transported to the nucleus induces the transcription of RAD51, an important
  component of the HR. In GBMs where PTEN is mutated or null, the transcription of
  RAD51 is reduced, and the HR is impaired. (d) MYC protooncogene directly suppresses
  the expression of CDK18 through interaction with its promoter that is responsible
  for activating the ATR through phosphorylation. ATR is an important component of
  HR. (e) ERβ is a cytoplasmatic receptor that suppresses the transcription of different
  components of the HR, such as RAD51, ATM, and ATR. IDH: isocitrate dehydrogenase;
