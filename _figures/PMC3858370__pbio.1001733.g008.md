caption: The figure depicts a model in which different ligands released from sLNv
  postsynaptic targets (TIM+PDF− as well as the lLNvs) modulate the activity of the
  BMP signaling cascade in the sLNvs acting through the TKV/SAX/WIT receptors. In
  turn, this signal results in a transcriptionally active complex (including schnurri)
  that down-regulates Clk expression. Reduced Clock levels would then give rise to
  decreased per transcription and therefore reduced PER levels, thus slowing the pace
  of the molecular oscillator.
