caption: Notch signalling pathway. Interaction of the ligands Dll4 and Jagged with
  the Notch-ECD activates the secretases ADAM and gamma-secretase cleaveage the two
  domains of Notch (ECD and ICD). Notch-ICD is released in the cytoplasm as an active
  form and translocates into the nucleus. In the nucleus Notch-ICD interacts with
  the CSL protein that in the absence of Notch-ID is inactivated by the a co-represor.
  Activated CSL forms a complex with proteins p300 and MAML1 that activates the transcription
  of Hes and Hey Notch related genes. ECD, extracellular domain. ICD, intracellular
  domain.
