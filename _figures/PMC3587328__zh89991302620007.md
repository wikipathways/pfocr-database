caption: Simplified scheme of cdB3-based control of glucose metabolism in RBCs. (A)
  Energy metabolism in RBCs proceeds through either the EMP pathway (orange arrows)
  or the HMP pathway (blue arrows; also known as the pentose shunt). Both share G6P
  as initial the substrate. The HMP is the sole source of NADPH in RBCs and generates
  fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which rejoin the
  EMP before glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD/GAPDH), a key regulatory
  point. The EMP generates NADH (used by met-Hb reductase) and ATP (to drive ion pumps)
  and 2,3-DPG (to modulate Hb p50). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and O2− are the principal
  endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) encountered by RBCs. Both ROS may be generated
  internally (not shown); however, only H2O2 can cross the membrane directly. O2−
  enters RBCs through Band 3 (anion exchange protein 1 or AE-1). H2O2 and O2− are
  ultimately reduced to water by catalase or GSH peroxidase (GPx). (B) O2 content
  modulates EMP and HMP balance via reciprocal binding for cdB3 between deoxy-Hb and
  key EMP enzymes (PFK, Aldo, GAPDH, PK, and LDH)., In oxygenated RBCs (right half
  of stylized oxygen dissociation plot), sequestration to cdB3 inactivates these EMP
  enzymes, resulting in HMP dominance and maximal NADPH (and thus GSH) recycling capacity.
  In deoxygenated RBCs (left half of oxygen dissociation plot), deoxy-Hb binding to
  cdB3 disperses these EMP enzymes, creating G6P substrate competition and thereby
  constraining HMP flux, limiting NADPH and GSH recycling capacity, and weakening
  resilience to ROS such as O2−. (C) In SSRBCs, SSHb binds abnormally avidly to the
  RBC membrane at cdB3., We hypothesized that this biases normal EMP/HMP cycling (disfavoring
  HMP), rendering SSRBCs vulnerable to oxidant attack. In support of this, we found
  that by blocking the EMP with KA (at the point normally inhibited by cdB3-GAPDH
  binding) restored resilience to oxidative loads, presumably by lifting the G6PD
  substrate constraint.
