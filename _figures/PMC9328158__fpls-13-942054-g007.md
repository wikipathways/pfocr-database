caption: Proposed model of reductant supply for FA biosynthesis seed. This model shows
  that green developing seeds have two pathways for generating NADPH for FA synthesis
  during seed development. i.e., (A) Photosynthesis (B) Oxidative pentose phosphate
  pathway (OPPP). Six to eleven days after flowering were chosen because seeds de-greening
  starts at 11 DAF.
