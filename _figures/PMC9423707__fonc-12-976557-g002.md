caption: Signaling involved in anoikis resistance mechanism of glioma. EGFR, IGFR,
  TrkB, TGF-β and the hippo pathway are signaling pathways involved in the anoikis
  resistance of glioma. NF-κB is a common mediator in these pathways, for it regulates
  the expression of several anoikis-related proteins. Similarly, the hippo pathway
  promotes anoikis resistance through its transcription factor TAZ. Apart from transcription
  factors, EGFR also represses Bim expression through Erk/MAPK pathway. Meanwhile
  TrkB upregulates Bcl-xl and downregulates FasL and Bim through PI3K/AKT pathway.
  The signaling of TrkB and TGF-β triggers EMT as well, which promotes cell detachment
  and anoikis resistance. And there are also EGFR signaling triggered by the hippo
  pathway, and β-catenin promoted by TGF-β, indicating the connection between adhesion
  molecules and signaling pathways goes both way.
