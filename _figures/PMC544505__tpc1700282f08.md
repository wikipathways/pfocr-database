caption: A Hypothetical Model for the Role of AtCLH1 in Plant Defense.The activation
  of defense pathways in response to two necrotrophic pathogens, the bacterium E.
  carotovora and the fungus A. brassicicola, is shown both in AtCLH1 RNAi silenced
  and wild-type plants. Positive effect is shown with arrow line and suppressing effect
  with end line. The strength of either positive effect or suppression is presented
  from low (dotted line) to strong (thick solid line). Pathogen attack results in
  activation of defense responses and increase in the levels of SA and JA. Pathogens
  also damage tissues, and this in turn releases chlorophylls from the membranes.
  In AtCLH1 silenced plants (A), the degradation of free chlorophyll is not initiated
  rapidly, and this results in enhanced ROS accumulation as a result of the phototoxic
  nature of chlorophylls. ROS enhances strongly SA-dependent defense that in turn
  suppresses JA-dependent defense. This builds up the resistance to E. carotovora,
  but simultaneously the plants become susceptible to A. brassicicola. In wild-type
  plants (B), AtCLH1 is rapidly induced after pathogen attack and initiates the degradation
  of free chlorophyll molecules. The emphasis of defense is directed to the JA-dependent
  pathway that suppresses SA-dependent defense to some extent. This results in susceptibility
  to E. carotovora but resistance to A. brassicicola.
