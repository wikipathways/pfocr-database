caption: Model of Proposed Mechanism for Nuclear GHR ActionPlasma membrane localized
  GHR induces STAT5 activation, and other pathways, by the classical Janus family
  of tyrosine kinases-STAT pathway. STAT5 translocates to the nucleus and binds to
  its DNA recognition sequence to initiate target gene transcription. In certain cellular
  conditions, such as during the proliferative phase in liver regeneration and at
  defined cell cycle-regulated times in progenitor proliferative cells, the GHR escapes
  its degradative pathway after GH addition and is translocated to the cytoplasm (possibly
  via the sec61 translocon) and then to the nucleus by the importin-α/β mediated classical
  import pathway. This process may involve its interaction with the NLS-containing
  protein CoAA, which mediates the interaction between GHR and nuclear import machinery.
  Once in the nucleus, the GHR can act as a transcriptional activator in conjunction
  with CoAA to initiate transcription of a subset of target genes to regulate cell
  cycle progression. Imp, Importin; JAK, Janus family of tyrosine kinsases.
