caption: 'Hepatic metabolic pathways of Met. In the liver, dietary Met is activated
  by conversion to SAM in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase
  (MAT) SAM (approximately 98%) is preferentially used as a donor of methyl groups
  for different methyltransferases that transfer them to a variety of acceptor substrates
  (nucleic acids, proteins, phospholipids, and neurotransmitters) with the simultaneous
  formation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) that is further hydrolyzed, by S-adenosylhomocysteine
  hydrolase (SAHH) to yield Hcy and adenosine. The latter reaction is readily reversible
  and may cause a chronic elevation of Hcy level. Under normal conditions, Hcy can
  be either converted into cystathionine by the transsulfuration pathway or used again
  for the synthesis of Met. Cystathionine is converted to Cys via metabolic reactions
  mediated by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), consecutively.
  In the liver, there are two separate remethylation reactions catalyzed by betaine
  homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) and methionine synthase (MS). In the liver,
  methyl groups used for Hcy re-methylation are provided by both methyl tetrahydrofolate
  (MTHF) and by the oxidative metabolite of choline, betaine, whereas in other tissues
  only MTHF is used as a donor of methyl group for MS. The dashed line indicates the
  lack or weak expression of a given enzyme in the brain. Abbreviations: DNMT–DNA
  methyltransferase; GCL–γ-glutamate-cysteine ligase; GS—glutathione synthetase; THF—tetrahydrofolate,
  Ser—serine; Vit. B6—vitamin B6; and Vit. B12—vitamin B12.'
