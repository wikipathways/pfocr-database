caption: 'Oncogenic viruses exploit the Notch signaling pathway. Notch ligands (Delta-like
  or Jagged) on the signaling cell bind to Notch 1–4 receptors on the receiving cell,
  generating the Notch extracellular domain (NECD) and the Notch intracellular domain
  (NICD). Subsequently, the proteolytic cleavage of NECD by γ-secretase, generates
  NICD translocation into the nucleus where it binds with the transcription factors
  (TFs): recombining binding protein Jk (RBP–Jκ), cAMP response element-binding protein
  (CREB), forming an active complex that regulates the transcription of Notch target
  genes. On the (Left side): EBNA2, HBx and Tax proteins encoded by EBV, HBV, and
  HTLV, respectively, promote cell proliferation or epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) through a direct interaction with the transcription complex, leading to tumorigenesis.
  On the (Right side): LANA protein, encoded by KSHV, prevents the activation of the
  transcription complex, resulting in an accumulation of NICD and increased cancer
  cells proliferation. EBV, Epstein Barr Virus; HBV, Hepatitis B Virus; HTLV-1, Human
  T Lymphocyte Virus-1; KSHV, Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus.'
