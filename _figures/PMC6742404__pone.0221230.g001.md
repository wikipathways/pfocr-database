caption: The canonical mechanism of TH action involves uptake of L-thyroxine (T4)
  or triiodothyronine (T3) into the cell by TH transporters, including the monocarboxylate
  transporter 8 (MCT8), L-type amino acid transporters (LAT) 1 and 2, and organic
  anion transporter protein (OATP) 1c1. Cellular deiodinase 2 (DIO2) converts T4 to
  T3, which has a higher binding affinity to the TH receptors (THR) α and β. DIO3
  converts T4 to reverse T3 (rT3) and T3 to T2. The general model of TH regulation
  of gene transcription involves TH receptors (TRs; genes THR) that reside in the
  nucleus bound to DNA as homo- or possibly heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor
  (RXR) complexed with among others nuclear co-repressor 1 (NCOR1). Upon ligand binding,
  the TR-RXR complex releases NCOR1 and recruits activator proteins to initiate transcription
  of target genes, which include DIO3, kruppel-like factor 9 (), myelin basic protein
  (MBP), myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein (MOBP), and hairless (HR)
  [reviewed by 26]).
