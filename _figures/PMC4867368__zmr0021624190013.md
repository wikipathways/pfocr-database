caption: The Listeria monocytogenes lipoate-scavenging pathway. Lpa denotes a lipoamidase
  activity encoded by an unknown gene(s) that cleaves lipoate from host proteins or
  peptides (). This bacterium encodes two lipoate ligases, but only LplA1 functions
  during invasion of the host in pathogenesis (). This is probably due to its more
  efficient utilization of lipoate (). LplA1 is largely specific for modification
  of the H protein of the glycine cleavage system. Following attachment to GcvH, the
  lipoate can be transferred to the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases. The transfer reaction
  has been shown to be reversible ().
