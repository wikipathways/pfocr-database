caption: Common pathways for microbial higher alcohol production. Three different
  recursive metabolic pathways, fatty acid synthesis (a), reverse β-oxidation (b),
  or an artificial pathway engineered from l-leucine biosynthesis with enzymes LeuA
  to LeuD (c) can serve to provide different precursors with carbon chain lengths
  as indicated. Reaction steps for which shifted chain length control has successfully
  been reported are highlighted in red. For description and abbreviations, see text
