caption: Schematic representation of hypoxia-related signaling pathways enriched by
  target genes of DE miRNAs in different tissues, including (A) the HIF-1 signaling
  pathway in heart, and the insulin signaling pathway in (B) muscle and (C) liver.
  The up and down arrows in red indicate up- and down-regulation, respectively, of
  DE miRNAs or genes. The clip art of tissues were created on our own.
