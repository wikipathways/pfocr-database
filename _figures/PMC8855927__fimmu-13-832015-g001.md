caption: The role of itaconate during mycobacterial infection. Itaconate, produced
  by immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1) from cis-aconitate, modulates TCA cycle by regulating
  succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, as complex II) activity. Dimethyl itaconate regulates
  the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS. In addition, dimethyl
  itaconate inhibits SDH and decreases the production of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS)
  in LPS-treated macrophages. It suppresses the expression of NLRP3 and ASC in NLRP3-activating
  conditions. During Mtb infection, IRG1 and itaconate downregulate inflammatory responses
  at the transcriptional level and neutrophil recruitment through inhibiting the production
  of mtROS and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In Mtb, itaconate has an antimicrobial
  activity for methyl citrate lyase (MCL) in the methyl citrate cycle (MCC) and isocitrate
  lyase (ICL) in glyoxylate shunt, enzymes that are needed for Mtb survival. Moreover,
  itaconyl-coenzyme A (CoA) targets B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM-B12)
  to restrict bacterial growth. Mtb effector Rv2498c participates in itaconate dissimilation
  to confer resistance to itaconate. During M.avium infection, tumor necrosis factor-
  α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 activate interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1)/IRG1
  through the autocrine/paracrine signaling pathway. AcCoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; ASC,
  apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; M-CoA, methylmalonyl-coenzyme A; MSU, monosodium urate;
  NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; S-CoA, succinyl-coenzyme A; TLR4, toll-like
  receptor 4.
