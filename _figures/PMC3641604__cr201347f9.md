caption: Model of the innate immune antiviral response triggered by IFNβ and TNFα
  in AECs. SeV infection of AECs triggers the secretion of IFNβ and TNFα. Binding
  of IFNβ to its cognate receptor activates the “classic” antiviral pathway mediated
  by the ISGF3 TF. Additionally, the synergism between IFNβ and TNFα induces late
  DUOX2 expression through a non-canonical antiviral signaling pathway. This pathway
  involves STAT2 and IRF9, but is entirely independent of STAT1. Late DUOX2 induction
  and H2O2 production is essential for the cells to mount an efficient antiviral state,
  at least in part through the regulation of IFNβ and IFNλ levels at late time points
  of infection. The importance of this novel airway antiviral defense mechanism is
  underlined by the observation that pathogenic RSV is able to counteract DUOX2 induction,
  suggesting that RSV has evolved a strategy to evade the DUOX2-dependent antiviral
  response.
