caption: HDACs regulate expression of homeobox transcription factor HoxA9, which regulates
  the expression of endothelial-committed genes in progenitor cells, including endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), VEGFR2, etc., promotes endothelial cell differentiation
  and neovascularization. HDAC3 expression is induced by VEGF activated Flk-1-PI3K-Akt
  pathway. During embryogenesis HDAC3 deacetylates p53, which activates p21 and promotes
  endothelia progenitor cell differentiation. SIRT1, a member of class III HDACs,
  negatively regulates forkhead transcription factor Foxo1 transcriptional activity
  and rescues the expression of Foxo1 target genes, such as VEGFR2. HDAC7 inhibits
  myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) activity, which regulates MMP10 expression in endothelial
  cell, and is related to the vascular remodeling.
