caption: Endodermal progenitors generate hepatocytes and cholangiocytes that surround
  the bile duct system in adult liver. The Hering canal cells give rise to bipotential
  oval cells, which are capable of generating both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.
  Hepatocyte regeneration is responsible for liver growth after partial hepatectomy.
  The exposure of the adult liver to hepatotoxins induces the proliferation of oval
  cell, but hepatocytes are slow to respond or do not respond at all to toxic injury.
  (A) In the hepatocytes, MST1/2 is activated by proteolytic cleavage that resulted
  in the loss of the Sav1 interacting SARAH domain. Cleaved MST1/2 is required to
  phosphorylate Mob1, but SAV1 is not required for Hippo pathway activity. This facilitates
  YAP phosphorylation, resulting in cytoplasmic retention by 14-3-3 binding and degradation
  by ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner. LATS1/2 activity is unaffected by MST1/2
  inactivation in hepatocytes. But loss of NF2 decreases LATS1/2 and YAP phosphorylation,
  suggesting that the existence of unknown kinase other than MST1/2. Additionally,
  RASSF family proteins seem to have a role in MST1/2 regulation. LATS1/2 might indirectly
  inhibit YAP by activating unidentified kinase distinct from MST1/2. (B) In the oval
  cells, MST1/2-regulated phosphorylation on YAP Ser127 is unaffected by Sav1 inactivation.
  However, Sav1 regulates YAP protein level and localization via as yet defined mechanisms.
  There are no clear links between MST1/2 and LATS1/2 activation in oval cells. The
  mechanism underlying the inactivation of YAP inhibits oval cell proliferation. However,
  the role of oval cells in liver regeneration remains controversial.
