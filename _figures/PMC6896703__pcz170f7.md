caption: Expression of SL pathway genes, downstream targets BRC1 and BRC2, and the
  modulating effect of GR24. Young AXBs (YB, left column) and mature AXBs (MB, right
  column) on single-node systems in water control (–▪–) and 10 �M GR24 (‐‐▪‐‐). Gene
  expression was analyzed at 0, 3 and 5 d post isolation. (A) MAX1.1 and MAX1.2. (B)
  D14a and D14b. (C) MAX2a and MAX2b. (D) D53-like1 and D53-like3. (E) BRC1 and BRC2.
  Values represent the means of three biological replicates �SE (n = 6 plants). Values
  were calculated relative to the AXBs at t = 0, set at 1. Two-way ANOVA (P-value
  shows statistical significance between treatments; NS, not significant). Asterisks
  indicate significant differences with day 0 within each treatment (Fischer’s LSD
  test; P-value at least <0.05).
