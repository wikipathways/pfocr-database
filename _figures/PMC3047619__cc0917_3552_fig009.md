caption: Attenuated cytoplasmic dsRNA sensing in hESCs. The major cytoplasmic dsRNA
  signaling pathways are shown. TLR3 is shown as associated with endosomes, while
  in some cells it may also appear on the plasma membrane. See text for details. Proteins
  depicted by green boxes are expressed in hES cells, while those depicted by grey
  boxes are not. The red “X”s indicate that the signaling pathway for each known dsRNA
  response system is severely compromised in pluripotent cells.
