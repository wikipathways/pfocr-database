caption: NF-κB, MAPK and Oct-1 pathways for expression of β-defensins. NF-κB can be
  triggered by various stimuli, such as E. coli and LPS. Upon activation, IKK phosphorylates
  IκB kinase, resulting in the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB.
  Additionally, PPARγ inhibits the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus through
  physical interaction, and E. coli significantly diminishes this interaction (cross
  sign). This process releases the NF-κB dimer, allowing it to move into the nucleus.
  In the udders of healthy cows, there exist a notable amount of active NF-κB factors,
  primarily NF-κB p50 homodimers, contributing to the continuous expression of β-defensins.
  Stimulation predominantly recruits NF-κB-p65, altering the balance from primarily
  p50 homodimers occupying the resting promoter to heterodimers (NF-κB-p65, -p50).
  S. aureus deactivates the TLR-4/MyD88/NF-κB axis (represented by a T-line) by obstructing
  MyD88-dependent signaling, which serves as the principal regulator of the TLR signaling
  pathway. Exposure of MECs to LPS triggers a robust activation of the MAPK pathway
  (depicted by thick arrows). This activation includes the phosphorylation of MAPK
  components, JNK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38, which correlates with an increase in β-defensin
  expression. S. aureus activates JNK1/2 (thick arrow), reduces the phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 (dashed arrow), while exhibiting no impact on p38 MAPK levels (solid arrow).
  Stimulation of the MAPK pathway can lead to the activation of AP-1. Oct-1 operates
  as a transcription factor in the regulation of β-defensin expression. However, it
  remains unresponsive to LPS stimulation (indicated by the T-line), and the cascade
  associated with this process has not yet been explored (indicated by a red question
  mark). AP-1 = Activator Protein-1; E. coli = Escherichia coli; ERK = Extracellular
  Signal-Regulated Kinases; IκB = Inhibitors of κB; IKK = IκB Kinase; JNK = Jun Amino-Terminal
  Kinases; LPS = Lipopolysaccharides; LTA = Lipoteichoic Acid; MECs = Mammary Epithelial
  Cells; MAPK = Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase; MyD88 = Myeloid Differentiation
  Primary Response 88; NF-κB = Nuclear Factor-Kappa B; Oct-1 = Octamer Transcription
  Factor-1; P = Phosphorus; PPARγ = Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma;
  S. aureus = Staphylococcus aureus; TLR = Toll-Like Receptor.
