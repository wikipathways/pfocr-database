caption: 'The strategy for determining heterodimeric interactions among the various
  polypeptides encoded by the Arabidopsis ACS gene family members. (A) The principle
  of the method: schematic presentation of an active heterodimer formation by coexpressing
  the K278A and Y92A mutants of two ACS polypeptides X and Z, respectively. (B) The
  construct: a pQE double-gene construct used to coexpress the K278A and Y92A mutants
  of various ACSs as His- and T7-tagged proteins with the T5 promoter. (C) The E.
  coli strain JAde6. The biosynthetic pathway of isoleucine in the E. coli auxotroph
  JHM544 is shown (shaded blue). The pathway was engineered to allow Ile prototrophy
  by integrating ACC deaminase into the genome, yielding E. coli JAde6 (). The strain
  can metabolize ACC synthesized when transformed with a functional ACS heterodimer.
