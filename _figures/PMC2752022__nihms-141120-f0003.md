caption: The role of Akt-FoxO pathway in regulation of heart size. Left, FoxO factor
  phosphorylation is decreased under conditions of Akt inactivation. Under these conditions,
  FoxO factors remain in the nucleus and activate atrophy-related genes, including
  the ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF-1, which promote protein degradation. Atrogin-1
  also interacts with and represses calcineurin by targeting calcineurin for ubquintin-mediated
  proteolysis, leading to inhibition of cardiac growth. Right, Various physiological
  or pathological hypertrophic growth stimuli result in the activation of Akt through
  phosphorylation. Akt activiation leads to inactivation of FoxO factors through phosphorylation
  and nuclear exclusion, thereby limiting the expression of atrophy-related genes.
  Akt activation also increases protein synthesis through the mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR)/S6 linase (S6K)-dependent signaling pathways.
