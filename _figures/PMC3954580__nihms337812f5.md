caption: 'Proposed MEK5 regulation in breast cancer: Similarly to MEK5/ERK5 pathway
  activation in physiologically healthy tissue, activation may occur through extracellular
  stressors, mitogens or cytokine activation to promote survival, anti-apoptotic signaling
  and proliferation of cancer cells. Some of the microarray analysis of breast cancer
  tissue samples as well as experiments completed by our laboratory suggests that
  activation of this pathway may lead to epithelial mesenchymal transitions (EMT),
  metastasis and invasion especially in more aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer.'
