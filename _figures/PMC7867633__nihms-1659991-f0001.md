caption: 'Sex-specific effect of mitochondrial functions in tissues with high energy
  demand. Interactions of pol II and POLRMT with the nuclear and the mitochondrial
  DNA, respectively, have been shown. The female sex hormone estrogen (E2) regulates
  expression of transcription factors PGC-1α, NRF1 and NRF2 that are important for
  the expression of TFAM, a transcription factor. TFAM is essential for mitochondrial
  biogenesis. Both TFAM and E2 regulate expression of genes located on the mitochondrial
  genome. Through the MAPK signaling pathway, E2 also regulates expression of antioxidants
  GPX and MnSOD that localize to the mitochondria. PGC-1α, NRF1 and NRF2 are known
  to be downregulated in SMA, although it is not yet known if the downregulation is
  more pronounced in males. Details of pathways depicted here are described in the
  body of the main text and the accompanying references (see ). Abbreviations: E2,
  estrogen; ER, estrogen receptor; MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; GPER, G
  protein-coupled estrogen receptor; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; MAPK, mitogen associated
  protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; NRF, nuclear respiratory factor;
  PGC-1α, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha; pol
  II, RNA polymerase II; POLRMT, mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase; TFAM,
  transcription factor A, mitochondrial.'
