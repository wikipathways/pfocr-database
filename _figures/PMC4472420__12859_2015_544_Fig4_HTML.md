caption: Outline of the strategy to create a lactose metabolic pathway. Six cloning
  vectors were constructed from five PCR products and the pYPKa vector linearized
  using blunt restriction enzymes ZraI, AjiI or EcoRV (A). Two S. cerevisiae expression
  vectors were formed by homologous recombination between three PCR products and a
  linearized pYPKpw vector (B and C). The thick blue line represents the linear pYPKpw
  vector. The two expression cassettes were fused by homologous recombination into
  a two gene expression vector (D).
