caption: 'VacA interferes with T-cell activation and proliferation by manipulating
  the T-cell receptor pathway and the cell cycle. Upon the stimulation of T cells
  via TCR and CD28, two major pathways are activated (the Ca2+-dependent pathway and
  the MAP-kinase and NFkB pathway). The anion-selective channel activity of VacA is
  thought to depolarize the plasma membrane and to prevent the opening of the CRAC
  calcium channel, either directly or via the blocking of the ER-located Ca2+ sensor
  STIM1, which is operated by calcium released from intracellular stores. Alternatively,
  VacA might also block calcineurin activation directly. This might result in abrogation
  of transcription of IL-2 and IL-2Rα genes. At low doses, VacA inhibits T-cell activation
  by inducing a cascade of phosphorylation events involving a still unidentified receptor,
  Vav, and MKK3/6, resulting in an increase of the active form of p38. Vav induces
  actin rearrangement through the small GTPase Rac, which leads to inhibition of T-cell
  proliferation. Abbreviations: CRAC: Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channel; CD28: costimulatory
