caption: Experimental design. Experiments were conducted both in vivo and in vitro,
  as indicated. In vivo experiments were conducted in wild-type mice (WT), MMP3-KO
  mice (KO) mice, and WT mice administered MMP3 (WT + MMP3) and included assessments
  of susceptibility to isoflurane anesthesia and BBB permeability to intravenously
  administered dyes (Evans blue, sodium-FITC). In vitro assessments included measurements
  of barrier integrity via TEER using ECIS system in monolayers of BMVECs and in cocultures
  of BMVECs and astrocytes via Transwell assay. The abundance of junctional proteins
  was also evaluated via Western blot.
