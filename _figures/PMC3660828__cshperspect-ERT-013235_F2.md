caption: Biosynthetic pathways of aminoglycerophospholipids. (A) Biosynthesis of aminoglycerophospholipids
  in yeast. Formation of PS is accomplished in the ER and catalyzed in a CDP-DAG-dependent
  reaction by the PS synthase, Pss1p. Decarboxylation of PS yielding PE occurs in
  mitochondria (via Psd1p) and a Golgi/vacuolar compartment (via Psd2p). Three-step
  methylation of PE in the ER catalyzed by Cho2p/Pem1p and Opi3p/Pem2p leads to formation
  of PC with S-adenosine methionine (SAM) as methyl donor. PC and PE can be formed
  also by the CDP-ethanolamine and CDP-choline branches of the so-called Kennedy pathway
  making use of exogenous or endogenous choline (Cho) and ethanolamine (Etn), respectively.
  SL, sphingolipids. (B) Aminoglycerophospholipid biosynthesis in mammalian cells.
  The major mechanism of PS production in mammals is base exchange with PC (PSS1)
  and PE (PSS2) as substrates. A major route of PE and PC production are the CDP-ethanolamine
  and CDP-choline pathways. In mammalian cells, PE can also be produced by decarboxylation
  of PS. In hepatocytes, a single methyltransferase catalyzes methylation of PE to
  PC. (C) The Land’s cycle describes a sequence of deacylation and reacylation. PE
  and PC are converted to lyso-PE and lyso-PC and vice versa.
