caption: '(By Figdraw, ID: RASTR41933) Mechanism of fibrosis promotion by malignant
  tumors: Tumor cells secrete pro-fibrotic factor TGF-β and activate CAFs through
  the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Furthermore, tumor cells and CAFs secrete inflammatory
  factors (such as IL-1 and IL-6), which can further induce the production of additional
  pro-fibrotic factors, thus further activating CAFs. The activated CAFs promote the
  synthesis of collagen, fibronectin, and other ECM components, and affect ECM degradation
  and remodeling by regulating the secretion of MMPs and TIMPs. Additionally, the
  activation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway is linked to the occurrence of EMT
  in malignant tumors, and the interaction between EMT and ECM remodeling further
  accelerates the fibrosis process'
