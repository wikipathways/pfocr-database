caption: Arrows indicate activation of downstream components or steps. Dashed arrows
  indicate potentially more than one step. Arrows labeled with “?” indicate steps
  that have not been experimentally verified. Regulation of proteinases by serpins
  is indicated. A dotted line represents weak inhibition of HP6 by serpin-4.
