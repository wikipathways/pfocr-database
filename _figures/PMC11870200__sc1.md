caption: Schematic illustration of NBP@mSiO2-PEG-cRGD/I3C for tumor-targeting chemo-photothermal
  therapy in a controlled manner. NBP@mSiO2-PEG-cRGD was firstly synthesized by wrapping
  NBP within mSiO2 modified with cRGD, followed by loading I3C into pore channels
  within mSiO2 to obtain NBP@mSiO2-PEG-cRGD/I3C. When the nanocomplex was intravenously
  injected into 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mice, it would target the tumor due to cRGD/integrin
  αvβ3 interaction. Afterward, under 808 nm laser irradiation, NBP@mSiO2-PEG-cRGD
  demonstrated superior photothermal conversion to simultaneously induce PTT and promote
  the release of I3C from NBP@mSiO2-PEG-cRGD/I3C at the tumor site. The released I3C
  initiated the chemotherapeutic process through inhibiting the phosphorylation of
  AKT by upregulating the expression of PTEN to restrain the activation of PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway. As a result, NBP@mSiO2-PEG-cRGD/I3C realized precise and efficient
  chemo-photothermal therapy to combat 4T1 tumors
