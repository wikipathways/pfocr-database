caption: Mechanisms of action of drugs targeting contact activation. Blue figures
  represent factor XI and factor XIa, and green figures represent factor XII and factor
  XIIa. The catalytic domains of factor XII and factor XI are indicated by CD, and
  the serine protease active sites of factor XIIa and factor XIa are indicated by
  AS. The red T-bars indicate the parts of the molecule with which individual drugs
  interact. In the case of the antisense oligonucleotide, the drug targets factor
  XI mRNA in hepatocytes, reducing production of factor XI protein. GAG, glycosaminoglycan;
  SMI, small molecule inhibitor; MAb, monoclonal antibody. Drugs marked by an asterisk
  (*) are being studied in phase II trials.
