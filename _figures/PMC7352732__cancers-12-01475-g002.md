caption: Ferroptosis is the result of an accumulation of lipid reactive species. ROS
  production is inhibited by metabolites derived from the amino acid cysteine, and
  glutamine by the antiporter xCT (−) transporter/SLC7A11. In addition, the p53-related
  lncRNA (P53RRA) is also involved in the regulation of SLC7A11. For a full explanation,
  see the section on Glutathione synthesis and ferroptosis cystine-glutamate antiporter
  (xCT)-GSH/GPX pathway and p53.
