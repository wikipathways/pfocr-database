caption: Potential mechanism of action of Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and Globotriaosylsphingosine
  (Lyso-Gb3) in Fabry’s disease podocyte. The accumulation of Gb3 in lysosomes inhibits
  AKT and mTOR pathway leading to the dysregulation of autophagy signaling in the
  podocyte. The inhibition of mTOR prevents the recovery of autophagosomes and lysosomes
  from autophagolysosomes by negative regulation. The formation of the autophagolysosomes
  causes podocyte foot processes effacement thus injury. Lyso-Gb3, the deacetylated
  form of Gb3, also plays a role in podocyte injury by promoting inflammation, fibrosis
  and dedifferentiation of podocytes. Lyso-Gb3 activates both the NOTCH signaling
  pathway, through γ-secretase, and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) leading to the release
  of chemokines. NOTCH-1 activation also promotes the transcription of HES genes and
  genes coding for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins thus inducing, respectively,
  the dedifferentiation and fibrosis of the podocyte.
