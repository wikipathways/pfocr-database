caption: It is believed that the rapid increase of synaptogenesis, by modulating prefrontal
  and hippocampal glutamatergic synapses, is a convergent mechanistic pathway underlying
  the beneficial behavioral effects of RAADs. Ketamine and scopolamine have been shown
  to precipitate glutamate neurotransmission surge by blocking interneuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate
  (NMDA) or muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptors, respectively, leading to inhibition
  of GABAergic input on glutamatergic neurons. This glutamate surge stimulates α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid (AMPA) receptors and activity dependent release of brain derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF), which in turn stimulates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
  (mTORC1) signaling and increases translation of synaptic proteins. LY341495 induces
  a glutamate neurotransmission surge presumably by blocking presynaptic metabotropic
  glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3). Rapastinel is believed to increase postsynaptic
  glutamate neurotransmission by exerting partial agonist properties on intrasynaptic
  NMDA receptors. Ketamine, traxoprodil, and Ro25-6981 were proposed to increase synaptogenesis
  by blocking NR2B-containing NMDA receptors activated by ambient glutamate. (2S,6S;2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine
  [a.k.a., Z-6-HNK] has been shown to increase glutamate transmission and elongation
  eukaryotic factor 2 (eEF2), however, the underlying pathways leading to these changes
  are not fully known. Alpha 7 nicotinic ACh (α7-nACh) receptors induce presynaptic
  glutamate release as well as increase ambient extrasynaptic glutamate by activating
  astrocytic glutamate release. Considering preliminary evidence of α7-nACh inhibition
  by (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK, future studies should examine whether the (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK
  induced increase in eEF2 is related to its effects on astrocytic α-7-nicotinic-ACh
  receptors.
