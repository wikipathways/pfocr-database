caption: Biosynthesis of UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). The pathways from
  [U-13C]-glucose to the four biochemical subunits are outlined. The glucose moiety
  (red) is directly incorporated into UDP-GlcNAc. The acetyl moiety (blue) is incorporated
  via glycolysis. The ribose moiety (yellow) is incorporated via the pentose phosphate
  pathway and pyrimidine biosynthesis. The uracil moiety is derived from acetyl-CoA
  through the Krebs cycle to form aspartate where it is combined with carbamoyl phosphate
  leading to pyrimidine synthesis (green).

  pathways based on 13C mass isotopologue profiles under non-steady-state conditions.
