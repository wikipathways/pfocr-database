caption: '(A): Differences between oxidative phosphorylation, anaerobic glycolysis,
  and aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). In the presence of oxygen, nonproliferating
  tissues first metabolize glucose to pyruvate via glycolysis and then completely
  oxidize most of that pyruvate in the mitochondria to CO2 during the process of oxidative
  phosphorylation. In tumor cells, even when oxygen is available, glucose is metabolized
  through aerobic glycolytic pathway generating lactate. (Adapted from Vander Heiden,
  et al., with permission) (B): Schematic representation of various metabolic pathways
  1-13C Pyruvate participates in and the corresponding NMR peaks.'
