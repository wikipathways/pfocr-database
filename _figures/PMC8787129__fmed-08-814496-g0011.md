caption: Renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) in liver fibrosis. Angiotensinogen is cleaved
  by renin into Angiotensin I (Ang I), which is further converted to Angiotensin II
  (Ang II) by Angiontensin-Coverting-Enzyme (ACE). Ang II is the agonist of AT1R,
  which signals G-protein dependent via Janus-kinase 2 (JAK2), Argef1/RhoA/Rho-kinase.
  This constitutes the classical RAS, which is known to lead to activation of hepatic
  stellate cells (HSC) and thereby to fibrosis and their contraction. The G-protein
  coupled pathway is terminated by beta-arrestin-2 binding to AT1R, which may terminate
  the contraction, but still may induce fibrosis via ERK-activation. Ang II may be
  further metabolized to Ang1-7 by ACE2, which represents the alternative RAS-pathway.
  The alternative RAS-pathway may block contraction via mas-receptor (masR) stimulation.
  The role of masR and beta-arrestin-2 are still under investigation and be crucial
  to elucidate the mechanisms in HSC, but also may offer therapeutic options for liver
  fibrosis and portal hypertension.
