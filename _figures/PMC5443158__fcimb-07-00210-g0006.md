caption: Proposed schematic model illustrating the contribution of TpxD and CodY to
  the pneumococcal global transcriptional response to H2O2. Under oxidative stress
  conditions H2O2 activates directly or indirectly a cascade of genes and transcription
  factors (TF), among them CodY (1). We speculate that CodY activation by H2O2 is
  due to a conformational change originating from specific cysteine oxidation (2).
  As a result, CodY binding to tpxD regulatory sequence is enhanced, leading to TpxD
  up-regulation (3), thereby preventing the accumulation of high H2O2 levels. BCAA
  are known to enhance CodY binding to DNA (4), thereby inducing tpxD expression (3).
  Under oxidative stress conditions, CodY modulates the intracellular level of BCAA
  through the up-regulation of the BCAA transporter, brnQ (5) and down-regulation
  of the BCAA biosynthetic machinery (ilv) (6). Consequently, the need for pyruvate,
  which is the central precursor in BCAA biosynthesis, is expected to decrease (7)
  leading to a shift in glucose catabolism toward the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  This metabolic shift will result in increased NADPH formation (8), thus enhancing
  TpxD recycling by the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase system.
