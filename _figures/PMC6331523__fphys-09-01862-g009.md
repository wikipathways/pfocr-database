caption: 'The effects of different stent techniques on angiogenesis. Stent techniques
  affect angiogenesis via two main ways: different stents will produce different mechanical
  forces in blood vessel and result in the risk of angiogenesis; different stents
  will affect TGF-β/Smad2,3,4 signaling pathway differently. Smad2 and Smad3 forms
  complexes after interacting with TGF–βsignaling pathway diff, which is phosphorylated
  by T Smad2 and SmaHeteromeric complexes of Smads 2, 3 and 4 can translocated to
  the nucleus together, resulting in inflammatory gene expression and production of
  angiogenesis. Red arrows showed an increase in the activity and blank arrows shows
  no function in the activity.'
