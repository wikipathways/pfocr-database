caption: 'Regulation of prophenoloxidase cascade and muscle contraction pathway. (A)
  During Euscelidius variegatus infection with flavescence dorée (FDp) or chrysanthemum
  yellows (CYp) phytoplasmas, the prophenoloxidase (ProPO) cascade, which produces
  melanine as innate immunity response, is regulated in reverse manners, being activated
  in FDp and inhibited in CYp-infected insects. (B) The expression of most of genes
  involved in muscle contraction was altered upon CYp infection (indicated in colored
  boxes). DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; RyR2, ryanodine receptor; TnC, troponin
  C; SERCA2a, calcium-transporting ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum. Data
  in the heat map of expression are indicated as follows: red and green correspond
  to up- and downregulation levels, respectively, during CYp infection compared with
  infection by FDp. (Republished from reference  with permission.)'
