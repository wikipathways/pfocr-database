caption: The RXFP2 receptor consists of a low-density lipoprotein (LDLa), 10 leucine
  rich repeat domains (LRR) and 7 transmembrane helical domains (TM). The mature INSL3
  hormone is formed by a B-chain and A-chain joined by disulfide bonds. The predicted
  INSL3/RXFP2 binding model shows a B-chain high affinity-binding site in the LRR
  (bold arrow), as well as an A-chain low affinity-binding site in the extracellular
  loops of the TM (dotted arrow). After binding, the Linker region helps direct the
  LDLa module towards the extracellular loops of the TM to activate the receptor,
  together with the N-terminal region of the INSL3 A-chain (lightning symbol). INSL3
  activates the RXFP2 receptor causing coupling to the Gαs subunit, which activates
  adenylyl cyclase and increases cAMP levels. This signaling mechanism has been proven
  in mouse Leydig and C2C12 cells, rat gubernacular cells, MG63 cells and primary
  human osteoblasts. cAMP downstream signaling through phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR,
  and S6 has been found in C2C12 cells, as well as activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway
  in primary human osteoblasts. In rat female and male germ cells, INSL3 activation
  of RXFP2 has been shown to cause coupling to the GαoB subunit, which inhibits adenylyl
  cyclase and decreases cAMP levels. INSL3 structure is from PDBe (entry 2H8B).
