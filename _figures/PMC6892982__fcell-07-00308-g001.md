caption: Autophagy regulators and functions associated with anti-aging effects. Different
  cellular components can be degraded by either non-selective or selective autophagy.
  These forms of autophagy are regulated by PI3K, mTOR, and AMPK, as well as the transcription
  factors TFEB and FOXO, which are accountable for the transcription of many genes
  involved in the autophagy process. (A) The different steps of non-selective autophagy.
  Upon autophagy initiation, a phagophore is formed and expanded, thereby producing
  an autophagosome. The matured phagosome fuses with the lysosome, initiating degradation
  of the autophagosome’s inner membrane. Cellular components captured within are subsequently
  degraded and released into the cytoplasm. Autophagy occurs under basal conditions
  in the cell, but can be up-regulated during stress. The autophagy process is inefficient
  during aging. (B) A lifespan curve illustrating the positive effects of enhancing
  autophagy during aging to improve the recycling of different cellular components,

  have been demonstrated in several model organisms. It has been shown in a number
  of studies that the lifespan of long-lived mutants is (reduced upon down-regulation
  of autophagy. In addition, there are a few critical studies showing that up-regulation
  of autophagy by overexpression of one of the autophagy genes extends lifespan. (C)

  of various cellular components, such as ribosomes, protein aggregates and lipids,
  via selective as well as non-selective autophagy. In addition, autophagy plays an
  important role in the DNA damage response and the nuclear-associated genes, TFEB
  and FOXO, play important roles in regulating autophagy. (D) Defective mitochondria
  are cleared by the cell through mitophagy. This is the process whereby damaged depolarized
  mitochondria can be degraded by the PINK1-Parkin pathway, which is ubiquitin-dependent.
  In cells with healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is continuously degraded, while Parkin
  is in the cytoplasm. Upon stress, PINK1 is stabilized on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, where it phosphorylates ubiquitin and E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. Once
  Parkin is recruited to the mitochondria, it then ubiquitinates some of the outer
  membrane mitochondrial proteins. These polyubiquitin K63-linked chains are phosphorylated,
  creating a degradative signal for autophagy. Receptor proteins involved in this
  pathway include NDP52 and TAX1BP1. These proteins recognize phosphorylated polyubiquitin
  chains and link damaged mitochondria to LC3-II. Another mechanism for mitochondrial
  degradation involves receptor-mediated autophagy by BNIP3, NIX and FUNDC1. These
  receptors also interact with LC3 via the LIR domain and target depolarized mitochondria
  for degradation. For mitophagy to occur, damaged mitochondria must be separated
  by fission. Healthy mitochondria are essential for cellular ATP production and the
  maintenance of cellular energy homeostasis. (E) The ribophagy receptor NUFIP1 mediates
