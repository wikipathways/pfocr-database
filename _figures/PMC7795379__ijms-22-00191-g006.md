caption: Overview of the roles of ROS, lipid signaling, and phytohormones in guard
  cell SAR. Guard cell SAR overlaps with basal immune response, which involves recognition
  of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by receptors such as flagellin-sensing
  2 (FLS2) and brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated kinase 1 (BAK1), activation
  of Botrytis-induced kinase 1 (BIK1). BIK1 then activates respiratory burst oxidase
  homologs (RBOH) D/F to generate ROS. Palmitic acid, an activator for Toll-like receptors
  TLR 2 and 4, may also activate FLS2. Additionally, systemic immune signals activate
  biosynthesis of salicylic acid (SA), promoting H2O2 production via peroxidases.
  SA biosynthesis starts in the plastids and pathway intermediates are transported
  by enhanced disease susceptibility 5 (EDS5) to the cytoplasm to produce SA. SA binds
  to its receptor non-expressor of pathogenesis-related (NPR1), a key regulator of
  SAR. Abscisic acid (ABA) can also activate RBOH, adding to ROS signaling. Ultimately,
  both SA and ABA act on membrane anion channels, driving water to move out and stomatal
  closure. Primed guard cells showed decreases in octoxynol-2, related to linolenic
  acid, an essential fatty acid found in chloroplasts, from which 12-oxophytodienoic
  acid (12-OPDA), a precursor for jasmonate (JA) is derived. JA is a precursor for
  jasmonic acid isoleucine (JA-Ile) which binds to coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1)
  and the COI1/SCF complex blocks RBOH D/F generation of ROS. During pathogen-induced
  stomatal opening, the Pst toxin coronatine (COR) structurally mimics the JA-Ile
  and binds to COI1. COR also represses SA synthesis, leading to reopening of stomata.
  Intercellular accumulation of ROS leads to oxidative stress and membrane alterations.
  Oxidation of fatty acids and lipids helps to reduce oxidative stress. Cellular redox
  perturbation regulates key signaling proteins including mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MPKs), NPR1, and lectin receptor kinases (LECRK). Glutathione (GSH) is
  important for the glutathione redox cycle and detoxification involves GSH peroxidase,
  GSH reductase, and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs).
