  types of stress: Cytokine storm, oxidative stress, and ER stress, each of which
  stimulates the others [,]. (B) NRF2 activators to interrupt the positive feedback
  loop [,]. NRF2 activators can stimulate the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway and induce p62 and
  the reduced form of glutathione (GSH), important regulators of ER and oxidative
  stress [,]. NRF2 activators also suppress the NLRP3 inflammasome, a potential contributor
  to cytokine storm in COVID-19 [,].'
