caption: Model of modulating effect of RA on IFN-γ production by NKT cells via the
  PP2A-ERK pathway. The activity of MEKs (also known as MAPKKs) in the NKT cells was
  induced by the signaling cascade triggered via TCR and CD28, which promotes ERK
  phosphorylation and IFN-γ expression (solid arrow). RA increased the PP2A activity
  to de-phosphorylate p-ERK and, subsequently, reduced the IFN-γ expression (dot arrow).
