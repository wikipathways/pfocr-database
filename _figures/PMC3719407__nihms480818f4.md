caption: A functional link between the BMP system and GnRH-induced FSH transcription.
  BMP-6 and GnRH mutually augment FSHβ transcription in LβT2 cells. GnRH activates
  FSHβ transcription by activating the ERK pathway, which is negatively regulated
  by BMP-7. GnRH also provides a feedback inhibition of BMP-Smad signaling by suppressing
  Smad1/5/8, in part via increasing Smad6/7 expression, and reducing endogenous BMP-7
  expression. There is a functional link between GnRH action and the BMP system for
  regulating FSHβ transcription in gonadotrope cells.
