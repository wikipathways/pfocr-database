caption: Schematic model of the interplay between triggering receptor expressed on
  myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-induced inflammation after
  subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The TLR4-induced inflammation suppresses the TREM2
  signaling pathway to exacerbate SAH-triggered inflammatory response in microglia.
  After SAH onset, the activated TLR4 pathway can interfere TREM2 by inhibiting the
  increment of TREM2 expression and cleaving TREM2 into a secreted form.
