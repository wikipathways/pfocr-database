caption: Proline generates GSH and NADPH to counter oxidative stress. Proline can
  shuttle between the mitochondria and cytosol to form the proline cycle, which transfers
  electrons from NADPH into the mitochondria and stimulate flux of the pentose phosphate
  pathway. Proline catabolism can stimulate NADPH formation by driving malic enzymes,
  folate cycle and reductive carboxylation through IDH1/2. Glutamate, cysteine and
  glycine forms the tripeptide GSH, which is used by antioxidant enzymes to scavenge
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG) is then reduced back to GSH by NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase, thereby
  consuming NADPH. 3PG 3-phosphoglycerate, αKG alpha-ketoglutarate, Asp aspartate,
  IDH isocitrate dehydrogenase (isoforms 1,2), GSH glutathione, GSSG oxidized GSH,
