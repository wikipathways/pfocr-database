caption: '( A) Major CXCR3 signaling pathways in leukocytes. CXCL9, CXCL10 or CXC11
  bind to CXCR3 to mediate chemotaxis and T cell skewing. Different domains facilitate
  ligand binding, with the N terminus of CXCR3 facilitating binding of CXCL10 and
  CXC11. R216 in the second extracellular loop (green star) is required for chemotactic
  responses for all 3 ligands. All three ligands can induce calcium flux, pERK, and
  pAKT, though CXCL9/10 require Gαi2 for pERK and β-arrestin2 for pAkt. CXCL11 can
  activate PLC and PI3K/AKT to mediate migration independent of Gαi. Internalization
  of CXCR3 induced by CXCL9/10 requires the C terminus, whereas CXC11 requires the
  3rd intracellular loop. CXCL9/10 can activate STAT1/5 to enforce Tbet/RORγT expression,
  whereas CXCL11 activates STAT3/6 to enforce GATA3 expression. ( B) CXCR3-dependent
  and independent signaling pathways in endothelial cells. CXCL10 activates cAMP,
  PKA and MEK in dermal endothelial cells to inhibit m-calpain and dampen angiogenesis.
  In cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, CXCL10 activates the p38/FAK pathway
  to induce migration, but not proliferation. CXCL10 also exerts effects on endothelial
  cells independently of CXCR3, but in a manner that requires GAG binding. ( C) CXCR3
  signaling in pericytes. Pericytes activate Src, Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways downstream
  of CXCR3, which mediate chemotactic responses. Kidney pericytes exhibit increased
  proliferation downstream of CXCL9/10, which is ERK-dependent (inhibited by PD98059).
  Interferons inhibit proliferation of pancreatic stellate cells via STAT1, though
  it is unclear whether this response is via CXCR3 ligands. ( D) Fibroblast responses
  to CXCR3 ligands. Intestinal myofibroblasts exhibit calcium flux and phosphorylation
  of PKB, ERK, p90RSK induced by all three ligands. All three ligands induce actin
  polymerization in a Rho-associated coiled coil-forming protein kinase (ROCK)-dependent
  manner that is independent of PI3K and Gαi. Signaling in skin dermal fibroblasts
  has not been fully mapped, though CXCR3 deficiency leads to hypertrophic and hypercellular
  scarring in mice via increased extracellular matrix proteins, including tenascin
  C, fibronectin, type I & III collagen, MMP9 and decorin. Color key: CXCL9 = red;
  CXCL10 = blue; CXCL11 = yellow; CXCL9/10 = purple; CXCL9/10/11 = green.'
