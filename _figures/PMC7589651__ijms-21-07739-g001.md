caption: Schematic diagram of O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation processes of protein
  and their possible pharmacological interventions. Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  (HBP) leads to UDP-GlcNAc formation and regulates O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAc transferase
  (OGT) is inhibited by BZX2 whilst O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is inhibited by PUGNAc, Thiamet-G,
  NButGT and NAG-T. These OGT and OGA inhibitors are targeted to modulated O-GlcNAc
  levels in neurodegenerative diseases. Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and glycolysis cycle
  regulate protein phosphorylation. Kinase and phosphatase regulate phosphorylation
  and dephosphorylation, respectively.
