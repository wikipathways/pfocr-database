caption: T cell immune checkpoints for anti‐tumor immunity. There are three major
  T cell activation signals, signal 1, signal 2 and signal 3. Signal 1 is MHC‐antigen‐peptide
  complex‐TCR signal that activate tyrosine kinases including ZAP70. Signal 2 is the
  co‐stimulatory signals from CD28, in which mostly PI3 kinase is involved. Signal
  3 is the cytokine receptor signals that activate the JAK/STAT pathway. T cell activation
  by TCR, co‐simulators, and cytokines is blocked by (1) PD‐1, (2) CTLA4, and (3)
  SOCS.
