caption: FAT10 protein actions in cancer development and progression. Chronic inflammation
  regulates the F adjacent transcript 10 (FAT10) gene expression as well as downstream
  targets through tissue necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Nuclear factor- κB/Signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (NF-κB/STAT3) pathway, which is responsible for
  upregulating the FAT10 gene expression. Overexpression of FAT10 further mediates
  the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, proliferation, chromosomal
  instability, DNA damage repair (DDR) resistance, and apoptosis. This leads to cancer
  development and progression; Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β); Proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen (PCNA); mitotic arrest deficient 2 (MAD2); Tumor protein p53
  (p53).
