caption: We identified genes and pathway associations, which have not been described
  before in skeletal myocyte differentiation or have been reported to have a different
  regulation than the one observed in the current study. A plus indicates upregulation
  during differentiation and a minus indicates downregulation. Moreover, we show genes
  which are inversely regulated by TNF-α, but have not been defined before, to be
  regulated in skeletal myocyte differentiation and response to TNF-α.
