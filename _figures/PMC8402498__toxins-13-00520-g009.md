caption: Canonical pathways activated in E. coli 536-infected Caco-2 monolayers. RNA-Seq
  of Caco-2 cells and subsequent bioinformatic pathway analysis by the Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis software (IPA) revealed “Colorectal cancer metastasis signaling” to be
  activated after infection. The symbol legend is embedded into the figure. The dataset
  from the experimental infection is overlayed in a pre-existing pattern of pathways.
  Orange color indicates activation and blue color indicates inhibition patterns.
  Grey nodes indicate no sufficient data or inconsistent data for a clear prediction.
  The pathway was visualized using the molecule prediction tool of IPA. Dotted lines
  indicate that the connection is not direct, and some nodes (not depicted) might
  be affected in between. In this pathway analysis, following the arrows for inhibition
  in the Wnt pathway or for activation of cytokine-induced NF-κB pathway as well as
  the activation of AKT and ERK, the prediction calculation concludes in the function
  symbol in the nucleus. The predicted biological function in the selected pathways
  is indicated with the gear wheel-like symbols, pointing to migration, metastasis,
  anti-apoptosis, cell survival or cell proliferation.
