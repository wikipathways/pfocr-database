caption: Regulation of GLI by Sufu in the Hh signalling pathway. (A) When the Hh pathway
  is quiescent without an Hh ligand, the GLI proteins are suppressed by Sufu through
  multiple mechanisms. In the cytoplasm, Sufu impedes importin β1-mediated nuclear
  transport of GLI1, while nuclear Sufu promotes CRM1-mediated GLI1 export from the
  nucleus. In addition to impacting the nucleus-cytoplasm shuttle of GLI2 and GLI3,
  binding of Sufu to GLI2 and GLI3 facilitates the SCF (Slimb/β-TrCP) ubiquitin ligase-mediated
  partial degradation of GLI2 and GLI3 following sequential phosphorylation by PKA,
  GSK3β and CK1. The partially degraded GLI2 and GLI3 are transported into the nucleus
  to function as transcription repressors (GLI2R, GLI3R), and Sufu can also recruit
  co-repressor, such as SAP18-mSin3-HDAC and p66β to suppress GLI activity in the
  nucleus, which can be reversed by Hh signalling. Meanwhile, Sufu binding can preserve
  a pool of full-length GLI2 and GLI3 by blocking their Cul3-HIB/SPOP ubiquitin ligase-mediated
  complete degradation. (B) Following Smo activation by Hh ligand binding to Ptc1,
  the suppressive cytoplasmic complex containing Sufu, GLI2/3, Kif7 and other proteins
  is recruited to the primary cilium tip, where dissociation of the complex releases
  the preserved full-length GLI2 and GLI3, while Sufu is destabilized. Without suppression
  by Sufu, the full-length GLI2 and GLI3 can function as potential transcription activators;
  however, they are susceptible to complete Cul3-HIB/SPOP-promoted degradation. Thus,
  the transcription activators CLI2/3 are labile and cannot continuously activate
  gene transcription in the absence of Hh signalling, and CLI1 is also transported
  into the nucleus accompanied with Sufu to stabilize it. In the nucleus, destabilization
  of Sufu, such as SCF (Fbxl17) uibiquitin ligase-mediated degradation of Sufu, results
  in dissociation of the SAP18-mSin3-HDAC-containing suppressive complex. GLI, glioma-associated
  oncogene homologue; Sufu, suppressor of fused; Hh, hedgehog; Fbxl17, F-box and leucine-rich
  repeat protein 17; Smo, smoothened.
