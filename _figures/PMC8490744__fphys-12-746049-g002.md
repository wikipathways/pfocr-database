caption: Mechanism of irisin actions linking energy homeostasis, obesity, inflammation,
  and male reproduction. (A) Irisin acts via activation of the AMP activated protein
  kinase (AMPK), P38, MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) pathway; (B) irisin-activated
  pathway upregulates glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression and transportation
  to membrane, aiding cellular glucose uptake that follows increased glucose metabolism
  and energy expenditure; (C) irisin also induces the expression of mitochondrial
  uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) that aids conversion of white adipose tissue to brown
  adipose tissue, resulting in raised total body energy expenditure, as well as facilitates
  pancreatic β-cell regeneration that contribute to irisin-mediated reversing of insulin
  resistance; (D) irisin downregulates nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) thereby playing
  role in suppressing inflammatory responses; (E) irisin-induced activation of Nrf2
  (nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor) may increase production of antioxidant
  enzymes thereby curbing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress
  (OS); (F) irisin may act on the HPG (hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal) axis or directly
  upon the testicular cells to regulate male reproductive functions. Moreover, irisin
  actions to improve metabolic balance as well as to reverse obesity, inflammation
  and OS, may confer ameliorative impact upon obesity/inflammation/OS-mediated male
  infertility.
