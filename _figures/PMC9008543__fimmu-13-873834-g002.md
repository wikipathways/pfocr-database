caption: A schematic diagram of T cell depletion caused by continuous antigen stimulation
  and PD-1. Continuous antigen stimulation increased the level of glycolysis in T
  cells and inhibited beta-oxidation in these cells. The decrease in oxidative phosphorylation
  indirectly increases the level of glycolysis. In addition, continuous antigen stimulation
  not only directly increases the levels of intracellular ROS and NFAT, but also increases
  the level of intracellular calcium, resulting in the accumulation of intracellular
  ROS indirectly. High levels of ROS affect the synthesis of ATP, thereby affecting
  the synthesis of DNA in T cells. Activation of the PD-1 signal pathway inhibits
  the transcription of PGC-1 α, resulting in an increase in the level of ROS. The
  PD-1 signal pathway also inhibits the phosphorylation of Drp11 at Ser616. Continuous
  antigen stimulation cooperates with the PD-1 signaling pathway to prevent mitochondrial
  autophagy and self-renewal, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria
  in T cells.
