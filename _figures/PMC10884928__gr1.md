caption: The metabolic pathway of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and the
  interaction between gut microbiota and hostWhen the imbalance of gut microbiota
  leads to damage to the intestinal barrier, the microbiota or metabolites can translocate
  to the liver through the gut-liver axis, affecting liver NAD metabolism. On the
  one hand, the host utilizes amino acids or vitamins from dietary to synthesize NAD
  and its precursors, and the host derived circulating NAM is one of the main sources
  of microbial NAD synthesis. On the other hand, the gut microbiota can utilize dietary
  fiber that the host cannot metabolize to synthesize NAD and supplement the liver’s
  NAD pool. In summary, exogenous NAD supplements or dietary can promote gut microbiota
  and host NAD metabolism and their crosstalk, jointly promoting liver NAD pool levels.
