caption: Proposed AKAP12 signaling downstream of β2‐AR.  AKAP12 scaffolds multiple
  kinases, in addition to polybasic domains, which control its interactions and signaling.
  Under the unstimulated β2‐AR state, AKAP12 is found mainly within the cytoplasm.
  However, when β2‐AR is stimulated, the polybasic domains found within the AKAP12
  signalosome targets the complex to the cell membrane. This colocalization of the
  signalosome facilitates a stable binding of β2‐AR and AKAP12. Activation of PKA
  is associated with increased levels of cAMP in its proximity. β2‐AR stimulation
  induces local increases of cAMP. AKAP12 is important for PKA activation through
  scaffolding and collocating PKA near areas of high cAMP levels. The active form
  of PKA phosphorylates multiple downstream molecules, such as CREB (cellular transcription
  factor), SRC (tyrosine kinase), and GRK (G protein kinases), all playing a role
  in downstream signaling of β2‐AR. Importantly, PKA phosphorylates AKAP12, which
  stabilizes the interaction between AKAP12 and the β2‐AR, even during post‐internalization
  of the receptor. On the other hand, phosphorylation of AKAP12 by PKC decreases AKAP12–PKC
  scaffolding (1), inhibits the PKC‐Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (2), and induces translocation
  of the AKAP12/PKA/β2‐AR complex to the perinuclear space (3). AKAP indicates A‐kinase
  anchoring protein; β2‐AR, β2‐adrenergic receptor; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; cAMP,
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CREB, cellular transcription factor; EPAC, exchange
  protein directly activated by cAMP; ERK, extracellular signal–regulated kinase;
  GRK, G protein kinase; MEK, mitogen‐activated protein kinase; PDE4, phosphodiesterase‐4;
  PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PM, plasma membrane; Raf, rapidly
  accelerated fibrosarcoma; and SRC, tyrosine kinase.
