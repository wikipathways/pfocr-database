caption: IGF-1 promotes protein synthesis through the PI3K/Akt1/mTOR pathway. Activation
  of Akt1 phosphorylates transcription factor FoxO and thus promotes its export from
  the nucleus to the cytoplasm. However, in the absence of IGF-1, FoxO is translocated
  to the nucleus and promotes the transcription of genes that are involved in protein
  degradation. Similarly, myostatin promotes FoxO- and Smad-2/3/2 dependent pathways
  and leads to protein degradation. Both MuRF1 and MAFbx1 are ubiquitin E3 ligases
  that facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin to protein. The polyubiquitinated protein
  is shuttled to the proteasome for degradation. In the autophagy-lysosome pathway,
  the assembly of the VPS15/VPS34/ambra1/beclin1/barkor complex triggers the formation
  of autophagosomes, where the damaged organelles are isolated and to which LC3 is
  recruited. The autophagosomes then fuses with lysosomes for degradation.
