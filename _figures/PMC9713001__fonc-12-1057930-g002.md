caption: 'Metabolism alterations in PDAC-CC. The upper panel shows that pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-derived cachexia (PDAC-CC) arises from the multi-stage
  progression of precursor lesions, known as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia
  (PanIN). PanINs are characterized by a continuum of increasingly stroma features
  (from low-grade dysplasia developing to high-grade desmoplasia). A desmoplastic
  response induced a fibro-inflammatory microenvironment, stimulating an aberrant
  metabolic response that is associated with cachexia. During early-stage PDAC, histology
  can be used to identify several distinct types of precursor lesions. The most common
  types are microscopic PanIN, low-grade (PanIN-1 and PanIN-2), and high-grade (PanIN-3).
  The progression to PanIN and to PDAC is associated with cachexia development. Multiple
  metabolic alterations follow the progression of cachexia, resulting in the reprogramming
  of glucose, amino acid, and lipid pathways. Metabolic alterations include nutrient
  scavenging pathway), such as glycolysis glutaminolysis, autophagy, proteolysis,
  lipid oxidation, and micropinocytosis (Most of them were upregulated during the
  development of cachexia). However, early-onset cachexia can arise independent of
  the PDAC stage, occurring in the pre-diagnostic PDAC stage. More than one-third
  of cancer patients were malnourished before chemotherapy, implying that the cachexia
  occurred early and followed a poor response to chemotherapy. Interestingly, some
  of cachexia occurs after the chemotherapy. The lower panel: The metabolic alterations,
  including increase glycolysis, glutaminolysis, lactate transport and autophagy …
  etc, in PDAC cell associated with PDAC-CC, primarily due to promote the expression
  in key enzymes (HK1/2, GFPT1, and LDHA) and transporters (GLUT1, MCT1/4, SLC7A5,
  and SLC1A5). The metabolic shift from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis is tightly regulated. HK1/2, hexokinase;
