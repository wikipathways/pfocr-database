caption: 'Ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and the signaling cascade pathway. (A) Model
  for the ET biosynthesis pathway. The precursor SAM is produced by SAMS with methionine
  as substrate. SAM is converted to the intermediate chemical ACC by ACS with the
  release of MTA as byproduct. MTA is recycled to methionine through the so-called
  Yang cycle. The rate-limiting enzyme ACS is highlighted in red. (B) Model for the
  ET signaling cascade. In the absence of ET, CTR1 phosphorylates EIN2 and the ET
  pathway is therefore blocked. In the presence of ET and when it is perceived by
  ET receptor (i.e., ETR1, ETHYLENE RESISTANT 1), the kinase activity of CTR1 is inactivated,
  the EIN2 CEND becomes dephosphorylated and cleaved. CEND subsequently translocates
  into the nucleus to attenuate EBFs E3 ligase function. In addition, CEND may bind
  to the UTR of EBF1/2 mRNA to perturb EBF1/2 translation in cytosol. Stabilized EIN3
  protein then activates ERF transcription factors (i.e., ERF1 and ORA59) to elicit
  the ET response. Abbreviations: ACC, 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid; ACO,
  ACC-oxidase; ACS, ACC synthase; CEND, C-terminal end of EIN2; CTR1, constitutive
  triple response 1; EBF1/2, EIN3-binding F-Box 1/2; EIN, ethylene insensitive; ER,
  endoplasmic reticulum; ERF, ethylene-response factor; ET, ethylene; ETR1: ethylene-resistant
