caption: 'Lymphoid-tissue resident commensal bacteria can colonize gut-associated
  lymphoid tissues such as Peyer’s patches, isolated lymphoid follicles and mesenteric
  lymph nodes. Lymphoid tissue-resident commensal bacteria share many properties:
  they are typically aerobic, environmental microbes that are broadly resistant to
  antibiotics. One member of this group, Alcaligenes spp., is a potent inducer of
  intestinal IgA responses. Anatomical containment of Alcaligenes spp. is mediated
  by IL-22-producing RORγt+ innate lymphoid cells. Loss of this pathway results in
  dissemination of Alcaligenes spp., systemic inflammation and tissue pathology.'
