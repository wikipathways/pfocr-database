caption: A comparison of the molecular pathways regulating flowering time in (A) arabidopsis,
  (B) rice and (C) temperate cereals. Vernalization and long days promote flowering
  in arabidopsis and temperate cereals wheat and barley (A, C), whereas short days
  promote flowering in rice (B). The role of FT in mediating the day-length response
  is conserved. The role of the CO protein might also be conserved. In rice a pathway
  involving OsMADS51 and Ehd1 promotes expression of Hd3a (FT-like) in short days,
  while Hd1 weakly activates Hd3a (dotted line). In long days Ghd7 represses Hd3a.
  In arabidopsis and the temperate cereals vernalization is required for the long-day
  flowering response, but this response has evolved independently in these plants.
  In arabidopsis, FLC represses FT to block the day-length response until FLC is itself
  repressed by vernalization. In temperate cereals, VRN2, which is distantly related
  to Ghd7, blocks expression of FT1 in long days. VRN1 is induced by vernalization
  to repress VRN2 and to allow long-day induction of FT1. PPD1 is required for long-day
  induction of FT1. Warm conditions also promote expression of FT in arabidopsis,
  while SVP represses FT at lower temperatures. FT-like genes might have similar roles
  in regulating thermo-sensitive flowering responses in cereals. SVP-like genes are
  induced by low-temperatures in barley, but it is not known whether these genes inhibit
  expression of FT1 at low temperatures in cereals.
