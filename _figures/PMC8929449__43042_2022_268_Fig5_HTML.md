caption: Upstream regulators dexamethasone and miR-8. A Chemical drug dexamethasone
  is predicted to be activated in smoker buccal mucosa with P value = 1.10 × 10–06
  and Z score = 0.438. B miR-8 is predicted to be activated in smoker buccal mucosa
  with P value = 8.90 × 10–02 and Z score = 2.1. Different shapes represent the molecular
  class of the protein. Red and green indicate upregulation and downregulation, respectively,
  while blue and orange indicate inhibition and activation, respectively. A solid
  line indicates a direct interaction, a dashed line indicates an indirect interaction,
  and a dotted line indicates inferred correlation from machine-based learning. An
  asterisk indicates that multiple identifiers in the dataset file map to a single
  gene or chemical in the Global Molecular Network
