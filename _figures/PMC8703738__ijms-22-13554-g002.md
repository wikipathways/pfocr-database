caption: An outline of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)/major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) class I presentation pathway. The majority of the degradation of proteins
  destined for antigen presentation by HLA-I occurs in the cytosol by the proteasome.
  These peptides are then translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), by the transporter complex associated with antigen processing (TAP), where
  further trimming may occur. Peptides are then loaded onto HLA-I molecules with the
  help of chaperones and the resulting stable complexes are transported from the endoplasmic
  reticulum to the surface of the cell. The incorporation of HLA-I molecules into
  exosomes generated through the MVB pathway is thought to occur by internalisation
  of HLA-I molecules from the cell surface.
