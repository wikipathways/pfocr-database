caption: As shown, binding of PD-1 to its two ligands activates inhibitory signaling
  pathways that induce phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the PD-1 cytoplasmic
  structural domain upon antigen stimulation, leading to recruitment of SHP-2 to attenuate
  T cell activation signals and modulate metabolic reprogramming during initial T
  cell activation, inhibiting the TCR and CD28 signaling-driven upregulation of glucose
  and upregulation of glutamine metabolism, thereby antagonizing cell activation stimulatory
  signals transduced through the TCR and CD28 pathways and thereby inhibiting T lymphocyte
  function. Antigen stimulation of the organism induces T lymphocytes to overexpress
  CTLA-4 and recruit large amounts of the phosphatases SHP2 and PP2A into the cytoplasm,
  thereby inhibiting TCR signaling and leading to a decrease in both T cell proliferation
  and cytokine production. Alternatively, PD-1 and CTLA-4, expressed on Treg cells,
  can regulate the immune function of T cells directly or indirectly by regulating
  the expression of inhibitory ligands on APCs. “↑” represents an increase in quantity
  or magnitude, while “↓” represents a decrease. (Created with https://smart.servier.com/,
