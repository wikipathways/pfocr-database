caption: 'Uridine and its metabolism (A). The mechanism of uridine synthesis and catabolism
  and the role of uridine in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and glycogen synthesis
  (B). Relationship between ATP consumption and uridine. UTP is produced by the phosphorylation
  of UDP with ATP used as phosphate donor, a decrease in ATP concentration results
  in decreased phosphorylation of UDP to UTP, leading to increased UDP and uridine-5′-monophosphate
  (UMP). These changes accelerate the degradation of uracil nucleotides (UTP→UDP→UMP→
  uridine). G-6-P: glucose-6-phosphate; F-6-P: fructose-6-phosphate; GlcN:glucosamine;
