caption: — Schematic representation of fibroblast reprogramming (education) by CRC
  cell-derived sEVs. (A) Although both colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116 and HT29)
  release sEVs, HT29 produces these vesicles in greater concentration, which can be
  explained, at least in part, due to higher amounts of mediators of biogenesis pathway,
  as well as Src kinase. Interestingly, HT29 not only has a higher amount of Lmwptp,
  but this protein is part of the sEVs cargo. (B) In relation to the biological relevance
  of these sEVs, in the present study, it was observed that they can educate normal
  fibroblasts, stimulating them to proliferate, migrate and acquire the characteristic
  of myoblasts.
