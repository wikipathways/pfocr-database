caption: Biological regulatory network (BRN) of IP3R with tumor suppressor and onco-proteins.
  The IP3 mediated Ca+2 signals play an important role in cell proliferation via the
  Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) pathway triggered by Calcineurin. It
  also mediates cell migration by activating Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphatase and Ca2+/CaM-kinases
  (CaMK). Whereas upon inhibition of IP3R, the activated Calcineurin also triggers
  the downstream apoptotic pathway by de-phosphorylating BAD that results in activation
  of members of the Bcl-2/Bax family.
