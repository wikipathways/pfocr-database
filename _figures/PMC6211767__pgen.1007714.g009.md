caption: The presence of oxygen is sensed by the protoglobin domain of the SK NmpU.
  During high oxygen conditions, NmpU is “on”, autophosphorylating and subsequently
  phosphorylating the receiver domain of the hybrid RR-SK NmpS. We propose this would
  maintain NmpS in an “off” state. Additionally, the first receiver domain of NmpT
  serves as a phospho-sink for NmpU. When oxygen is limiting, perhaps in certain soil
  types/depths or during multi-cellular development, NmpU switches to an “off” state,
  leading to the loss of phosphorylation of NmpS and turning “on” the second branch
  of the pathway. NmpS phosphorylation of the RR NmpR under these conditions activates
  NmpR leading to modulation of the expression of pilR, which in turn regulates pilA
  expression influencing T4P-dependent motility.
