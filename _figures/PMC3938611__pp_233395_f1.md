caption: 'Schematic overview of terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways. The
  names of compounds and select enzymes (italicized) are as follows: ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase; CDP-ME, 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol; CDP-MEP, 2-phospho-4-(cytidine
  5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol; CMK, 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  kinase; DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; DXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate;
  DXPS, DXP synthase; DXR, DXP reductoisomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FLS,
  flavonol synthase; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; FPPS, FPP synthase; GPP, geranyl diphosphate;
  GPPS, GPP synthase; HDR, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase; IPP,
  isopentenyl diphosphate; MCT, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase;
  MTS, monoterpene synthase; PAL, Phe ammonia lyase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; STS,
  sesquiterpene synthase. Note that although some sesquiterpenes in tomato are synthesized
  via the  pathway (as shown for simplicity; ), most sesquiterpenes are derived from
  the cytosolic mevalonate pathway. [See online article for color version of this
