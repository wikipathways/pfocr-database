caption: Recognition of viral genomes by cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene
  I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) trigger mitochondrial
  antiviral signaling (MAVS) activation that lead to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1),
  IκB kinase-ε (IKKε) induction of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IRF7
  (tan arrows). Viral genome recognition by endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)
  (green arrows) and TLR7 (orange arrows) will activate TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing
  IFNβ (TRIF) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) signaling
  pathways, inducing IRF3/IRF7 and inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase (IKK)α/IKKβ/IKKγ,
  and activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to produce IFNα/β and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  Virus-induced mitochondria damage activates the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) (pink
  arrows) and stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway to induce IFNα/β production
  via IRF3 and IRF7. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) associate with RNA-induced silencing complex
  (RISC) in the cytoplasm to target viral RNA for inhibition or degradation. miRNA
  biogenesis starts in the nucleus as pri-miRNA and processed by Drosha into pre-miRNA.
  Pre-miRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm and cleaved by Dicer to produce mature
  miRNAs. Argonaute (Argo) and TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP) are proteins essential
  to the formation of RISC (blue arrows). Double membrane vacuoles, called autophagosomes,
  will engulf foreign cytoplasmic material and fuse with the lysosome for degradation,
  inhibiting virus replication (red)
