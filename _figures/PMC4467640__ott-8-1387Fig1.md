caption: 'Cellular regulation mediated by extracellular matrix (ECM).Notes: The action
  of ECM components on the major signaling pathways of tyrosine kinase receptors,
  their links, and the outcome on tumor cell and chemotherapeutic response. Inhibition
  or activation of potential sites could be used for therapeutic intervention in anticancer
  treatment. The ECM proteins and proteoglycans, directly or after binding to integrin
  receptors, through PI3K/AKT/mTOR (yellow) and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (purple) pathways,
  significantly influence cell proliferation, apoptosis, and response to chemotherapeutic
  drug. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a role in regulation of p53 activity and apoptosis
  and controls critical proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation and migration.
  The pathway is also connected to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, among many others. As
  a response to ECM biopolymers, the mTOR kinase regulates translation of protein
  synthesis of some key molecules such as cyclin D1, p27, pRb, and c-Myc. mTOR inhibitors
  suppress the translation of mRNAs involved in cell growth and migration. The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  pathway can also be activated by ECM components. Phosphorylated ERKs get activated
  and will be translocated into the nucleus, where they phosphorylate further transcription
  proteins, such as Fos, Elk-1, CREB, and Gata-1. These transcription factors bind
  to promoter regions of many genes, like growth factor and cytokine genes, which
  are important in promotion of growth and prevention of apoptosis in case of different
  cell types. Mutations in the tumor often activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  pathways. Inhibitors targeting these pathways could be successfully combined with
  chemotherapeutic drugs and/or radiotherapy that inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.'
