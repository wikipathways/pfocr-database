caption: Effects of metabolic regulation on tumour metastasis. Glycolysis and Mitochondrial
  oxidative metabolism jointly contribute to the invasion and migration of tumour
  cells. Under the condition of sufficient glucose, normoxia, and low LA, glycolytic
  tumour cells can enable tumour cells to shift to functional mitochondrial oxidation
  in a manner of activation dependent on AMPK, thus leading to anti-anoikis apoptosis.
  In addition, glycolytic flux can activate EMT-related molecules SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST,
  and ZEB1, and stimulate Yap/YAZ-signaling pathway to drive cell movement. With the
  starvation of glucose, hypoxia, and increased lactate acid, glycolytic tumour cells
  can absorb LA and use glutamine for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. AMPK activated
  by glycolysis also can enable tumour cells to shift to functional mitochondrial
  oxidation. The glycolytic tumour cells with glutamine for metabolism showed more
  aggression, and together with glycolytic tumour cells with glucose for metabolism,
  both can activate EMT to drive cell metastasis. The dotted arrows represent that
  there is a multi-step regulatory pathway between the upstream and downstream of
  molecular events, which is a brief description rather than one-step regulation.
