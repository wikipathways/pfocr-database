caption: VPA impacts the B cell differentiation into plasma cells and in the isotype
  switch and maturation affinity of immunoglobulins. There are various signals by
  which B lymphocytes can differentiate into plasma cells that produce one or another
  immunoglobulin. CD40L+IL-21 promote IgM production and isotype switch into IgG and
  IgA; LPS+IL-4 induce isotype switch into IgG1; CD40L and IL-4 enable isotype switch
  into IgE; and IL-4+IL-5+LPS+TGF-β+dextran-conjugated anti IgD (not shown) prompt
  isotype switch into IgA. Isotype switch is mainly mediated by AID expression, while
  the naïve B lymphocyte differentiation into a plasma cell is governed by Blimp-1.
  VPA interferes with those mechanisms by inhibiting several HDACs, which promotes
  an increase in acetylation of the H3 that is next to the codifying genes for multiple
  miRNAs, which then block mRNA for AID (Aicda) and for Blimp-1 (Prdm1). Besides,
  VPA inhibits the expression of the early activation molecule CD69 and of MHC-II.
  Furthermore, this effect could be employed to reduce the generation of autoantibodies
  in mouse experimental lupus models. Green arrows indicate the processes, molecules,
  or mediators in the signaling pathway that are augmented and/or promoted by VPA.
  Red arrows indicate processes, molecules, or mediators in the signaling pathway
  that are inhibited by VPA. Figure based on [].
