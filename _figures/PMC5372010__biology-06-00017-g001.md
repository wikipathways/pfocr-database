caption: 'Cartoon of glucose metabolism via pyruvate in neurons (left—N) and astrocytes
  (right—A) and of glutamine-glutamate (γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) cycling. This figure
  shows (i) metabolic pathways; (ii) metabolic rates (µmol/min per 100 mg protein
  or 1 g wet wt); and (iii) inhibition by excess extracellular glutamate or glutamine.
  One molecule of glucose is metabolized by glycolysis in the cytosol to two molecules
  of pyruvate in a complex and strictly regulated pathway (not shown). In both neurons
  and astrocytes pyruvate metabolism via acetyl coenzyme A (ac.CoA) leads to formation
  of citrate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle by condensation with preexisting
  oxaloacetate (OAA), an end result of the previous turn of the cycle. Citrate oxidation
  in the TCA cycle includes two decarboxylations, resulting in re-formation of oxaloacetate,
  ready for another turn of the cycle, and reduction of NAD+ to NADH (and a single
  FAD to FADH2), leading to large amounts of energy (ATP) via re-oxidation in the
  electron transport chain. Pyruvate carboxylation, which is active in astrocytes,
  but not in neurons, creates a new molecule of oxaloacetate, which after condensation
  with acetyl coenzyme A, forms citrate that is metabolized in the TCA cycle to α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG), which can leave the cycle to form glutamate (glu), catalyzed by aspartate
  aminotransferase (AAT). Further metabolism by the cytosolic and astrocyte-specific
  enzyme glutamine synthetase leads to the formation of glutamine (gln), which after
  transport to neurons is converted to transmitter glutamate or GABA in complex reactions
  (reviewed in []). Released transmitter glutamate is almost quantitatively re-accumulated
  in astrocytes, together with at least part of the released GABA (upper line of glu-gln
  cycle) and re-accumulated in the astrocytic cytosol. Here, 75%–80% is converted
  to glutamine and re-enters the glutamine-glutamate (GABA) cycle. The remaining 20%–25%
  is oxidatively degraded. This paper suggests that the default mechanism for the
  initial conversion of glutamate to α-KG is also transamination by AAT (see ), but
  it does not exclude a minor contribution by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Operation
  of AAT in two opposite directions is thermodynamically possible since the reactions
  take place in two different compartments (cytosol and mitochondria) and also are
  temporally separate. α-KG is metabolized via malate, which can exit to the cytosol
  and be decarboxylated by cytosolic malic enzyme to pyruvate, which is oxidized in
  the TCA cycle via acetyl coenzyme A. Another possibility is that malate does not
  exit the TCA cycle but is further metabolized to α-KG after condensation with acetyl
  coenzyme A, allowing re-synthesis of another molecule of glutamate from only one
  molecule of pyruvate []. The degraded glutamate/GABA must in the long term be replaced
  by a quantitatively similar production of glutamate from glucose, in the first case
  by complete de novo synthesis from one molecule glucose, in the second from one
  half of a glucose molecule. However, temporary fluctuations in the content of glutamate
  occur. The initial part of GABA metabolism is different, as all GABA is metabolized
  via succinic semialdehyde, succinate and α-KG to glutamate. Numbers in black show
  rates re-calculated as µmol/min per 100 mg protein based on rate of glucose uptake
  in our own cultured astrocytes, and those in red are in vivo rates from []. The
  percentage distribution between metabolism via pyruvate carboxylation and acetyl
  coenzyme A is based on averages of results tabulated in []. Those for glutamate
  metabolism to either α-KG or glutamine are from []. The in vivo results that 40%
  of 0.8 µmol/min per 100 mg protein is metabolized via pyruvate carboxylation is
  consistent with the pyruvate carboxylation rates found by Kaufman and Driscoll []
  and overall the correlation between the metabolic rates in vivo and in culture is
  remarkably good, although other authors have described lower rates of glucose metabolism
  in cultured astrocytes. It should also be kept in mind that lightly anaesthetized
