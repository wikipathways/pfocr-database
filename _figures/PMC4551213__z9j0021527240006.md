caption: A force-sensitive signaling network involving TRPC6 and TRPM4 channels in
  cerebral artery smooth muscle cells. A stretch-sensing pathway in cerebral artery
  myocytes that includes 1) activation of AT1R, Src tyrosine kinase, and PLC-γ1, leading
  to the generation of IP3; and 2) Ca2+ influx through TRPC6 channels onto IP3Rs,
  promoting CICR that results in activation of TRPM4 channels, which are responsible
  for pressure-induced depolarization of the plasma membrane. PM, plasma membrane;
  ΔVm, change in membrane potential. [From Gonzales et al. ().]
