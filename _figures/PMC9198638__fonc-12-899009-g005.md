caption: Salvicine-mediated anti-proliferative and/or anticancer effect pathway. As
  an initial step, salvicine produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and binds to the
  double-strand (DS)-DNA moiety, the cysteine residue (a). At the same time, it enables
  disruption of the double-strand DNA (b), additionally inhibiting the rapidly proliferating
  cells, including cancerous cells. Salvicine directly interacts with the DNA-dependent
  protein kinase enzyme (DDPKE) (c), which is why the inactive enzyme functions with
  the inhibition of cellular growth (d), halting the rapidly propagating cancerous
  cells. On the contrary, the c-myc protein plays a key regulatory role during DS-DNA
  growth, but it directly binds with the promoter region of the c-myc gene (e) and
  interestingly yields a malfunction enzyme (f), which damages the DS-DNA (g) and
  subsequently downregulates metastasis. However, telomere repeat binding factor-2
  is synthesized by the trf2 gene that plays a fundamental role in normal cells, and
  salvicine binds to the trf2 gene (h) and shuts down the expression of the telomerase
  protein (i) that induces apoptosis (j), which mediates the anticancer effect. Finally,
  salvicine disrupts the cell–extracellular matrix adhesion protein, mainly integrin
  β1 (k), which is involved in cell cycle arrest (l) and hinders neoangiogenesis (m)
  and even cancer metastasis.
