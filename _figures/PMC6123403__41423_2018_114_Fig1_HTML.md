caption: S1P from lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) is secreted in a SPNS2-dependent
  manner, promoting naive T-cell survival via S1P1. Sphingosine kinases (SK) 1/2 transform
  sphingosine into S1P, which is secreted by LEC through the specific transporter
  SPNS2. S1P can be dephosphorylated by S1P phosphatases 1/2 (SPPases) or irreversibly
  degraded into phosphoethanolamine (PE) and hexadecenal by S1P lyase (SPL). Inhibition
  of SPL by DOP (deoxypyridoxine) increases the level of S1P in lymph nodes. S1P binds
  to S1P1 expressed by naive T cells, which then survive most likely upon activation
  of the AKT pathway. SPNS2 or S1P1 deficiency impairs this signaling, inducing loss
  of mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis. Mechanistically, PINK1 accumulates in
  mitochondria and induces ubiquitinylation of mitochondrial proteins, leading to
  mitophagy. Overexpression of Bcl-2 counteracts apoptosis induced by the loss of
  S1P/S1P1 signaling. Bcl-2, B cell lymphoma 2; PINK1, PTEN-induced putative kinase
  1; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate; S1P1, S1P receptor 1; Ubq, Ubiquitin.
