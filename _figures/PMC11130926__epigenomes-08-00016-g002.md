caption: Schematic representation of comparative genomics-driven approach to identify
  novel Q transporters. (1) Identification of knowledge gaps in metabolic pathways,
  e.g., missing Q precursor transporters. (2) Construction of Sequence Similarity
  Networks (or SSNs) for signature enzymes in Q pathways, e.g., E6 (TGT) and E9 (Qng1/QueK).
  (3) Investigation of genomic neighbors and fusions for Pfam families of query signature
  enzyme. (4) Generation of candidates. (5) Expression of candidates in engineered
  E. coli strains lacking indigenous Q precursor transporter. (6) Detection, quantification,
  and localization of Q-tRNA using various technologies. Enzymes in Q biosynthesis
  pathway are represented by E1 to E9. Among them, E6 (TGT) and E9 (hydrolases) are
  signature enzymes of q salvage
