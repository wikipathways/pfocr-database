caption: Proposed model of rituximab (RTX)-mediated inhibition of the nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) pathway in primary Sjögren syndrome salivary gland epithelial cells (pSS
  SGEC). The NF-κB signalling pathway is constitutively active in pSS SGEC and these
  cells express low levels of Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP). In a co-culture
  system with pSS lymphocytes, on ligation to CD20, RTX up-regulates RKIP expression.
  RKIP inhibits the activity of the NF-κB pathway, culminating in decreased expression
  of NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory genes.
