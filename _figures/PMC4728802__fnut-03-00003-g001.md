caption: 'Metabolic pathway in the generation of anti-allergic/inflammatory lipid
  mediators from the dietary oil. ALA is enriched in some kinds of dietary oil (e.g.,
  linseed oil) and absorbed into the intestinal tissues where it is metabolized into
  EPA after several reactions mediated by various enzymes (e.g., elongase and desaturases).
  EPA is epoxidized by CYP450 to generate 17,18-EpETE, which exerts anti-allergic
  properties in the intestine. Abbreviations: ALA, α-linolenic acid; CYP, cytochrome
  P450; EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; EpETE, epoxy eicosatetraenoic acid; LA, linoleic
  acid; OA, oleic acid; PA, palmitic acid; SA, stearic acid.'
