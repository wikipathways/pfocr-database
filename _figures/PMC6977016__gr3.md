caption: Role and mechanisms of frequently-studied traditional herbs in treating NAFLD.
  Four frequently-studied THM (silymarin, curcumin, berberine, and resveratrol) are
  registered in ClinicalTrials.gov for clinically testing their safety and efficacy
  in treating NAFLD. Berberine and silymarin were subjected to a phase 4 clinical
  trial. These four representative traditional herbs show hepatoprotective effects
  in improving NAFLD/NASH in preclinical rodent mouse models via various molecular
  pathways mainly including cell death modulation (via inducing autophagy or inhibiting
  hepatocyte apoptosis), lipid metabolism modulation (via activating FXR, PPARA, PPARG,
  AMPK, SIRT1 or antagonizing LXR), anti-inflammation (via inhibiting TLR/MYD88 or
  NLRP3 inflammasome pathway), anti-oxidative stress (via activating NRF2), modulating
  liver-gut axis (via changing microbiota composition, repairing leaky gut to reduce
  the release of LPS or harmful bacteria, modulating intestinal FXR signaling or SIRT1
  signaling, or producing microbiota products such as active bile acids or herb drug
  metabolites).
