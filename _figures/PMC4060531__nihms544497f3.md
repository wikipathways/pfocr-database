caption: Schematic representation of a GC centrocyte, expressing a functional surface
  BCR, CD40 receptor and TLR/IL-1R. Engagement of these signaling cascades in normal
  B cells converge on the activation of the NF-κB transcription complex, and induces
  the expression of hundreds of targets genes, including IRF4 and the NF-κB negative
  regulator TNFAIP3/A20. IRF4, in turn, downregulates BCL6 expression, allowing the
  release of the plasma cell master regulator PRDM1 and the development into a differentiated
  plasma cell. In DLBCL, a variety of genetic lesions disrupt this circuit at multiple
  levels specifically in the ABC-subtype, and contribute to lymphomagenesis by favoring
  the anti-apoptotic function of NF-κB while blocking terminal B cell differentiation.
