caption: 'The clinical role of Aldehyde dehydrogenase-1A1 (ALDH1A1) in pancreatic
  cancer. ALDH1A1 regulates several hallmarks of cancer as a clinical regulator to
  control chemoresistance, prognosis and cancer stem cells. In pancreatic, RA binds
  RAR to drive ALDH1A1 to induce higher expression of ALDH1A1 which is responsible
  for significant activation of the AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway in regulation of chemoresistance,
  prognosis and cancer stem cells. ALDH1A1: Aldehyde dehydrogenase-1A1; RA: Retinoic
  acid; RAR: Retinoic acid receptor; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; AKT: Protein kinase
  B; GSK3β: Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta'
