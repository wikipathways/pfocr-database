caption: AKAP-Lbc integrates multiple signaling pathways. GPCRs such as M1 muscarinic
  receptor (M1-R) initiate a signaling cascade involving PKC-mediated activation of
  PKD and phosphorylation of HDAC in the nucleus. In another pathway, Gα12-coupled
  receptors such as the lysophospholipid receptor (LPA-R) stimulate the intrinsic
  Rho-GEF activity of AKAP-Lbc. When cAMP concentrations are low (top panel), PKD
  activity is relatively low and Rho-GEF activity relatively high. Gαs-coupled receptors
  such as βAR stimulate production of cAMP (orange cloud) by adenylyl cyclases (bottom
  panel), leading to the activation of PKA. Phosphorylation of AKAP-Lbc by PKA accentuates
  PKD signaling and curtails Rho-GEF activity. For simplicity, both panels show conditions
  where Gαq/11 and Gα12 pathways are active. HDAC, histone deacetylase; LPA-R, Lysophosphatidic
  acid receptor; βAR, beta-adrenergic receptor; LC3, microtubule associated protein
  light chain 3.
