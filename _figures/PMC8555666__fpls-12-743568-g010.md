caption: Cytoscape analyses (interactive networks) of different PAs form with the
  transcript abundances of genes analyzed during drought and salinity stress. Positive
  (red) and negative (blue) correlations of cellular levels of PUT-F, SPD-F, SPM-F,
  PUT-C, SPD-C, SPM-C, PUT-B, SPD-B, and SPM-B, and transcript abundance of PAs biosynthesis
  and catabolizing enzymes genes are shown. Also included in the Cytoscape analysis
  are the Pearson correlations of selected drought (A) and salinity (B) stress maker
  genes and photosynthesis processes and carbon fixation pathway genes. Other details
  are given in the section “Materials and Methods.”
