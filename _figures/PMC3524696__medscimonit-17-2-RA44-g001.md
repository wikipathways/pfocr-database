caption: The schematic diagram represents the ischemic preconditioning pathway in
  cardiomyocytes. IPC induces cardiomyocytes to release adenosine, bradykinin and
  endogenous opioid which occupy their specific G-protein coupled receptors. After
  that, the signal will pass into the cytosol via the activation of the enzyme series
  including PI3K, PDKs, Akt and NOS. The latter enzyme produces NO which acts as signaling
  molecule to activate sGC and resulted in the cGMP formation. Then, cGMP activates
  PKG which has the separated mechanism on the mitochondria, the direct and indirect
  mechanism. The direct mechanism of PKG is on the R1 protein on outer mitochondrial
  membrane which then activates the opening of mitoKATP channel on the inner mitochondrial
  membrane via the phosphorylation of PKCε1. The indirect mechanism of PKG is the
  phosphorylation of ERK and GSK3β which then act on mitoKATP channel. However, the
  mechanism of how GSK3β activates the opening of mitoKATP channel is still unclear.
  After the mitoKATP channel opening, K+ then enters the mitochondrial matrix and
  H+ is ejected out of the matrix to balance the positive charge. When H+ level decreases,
  the electron transport chain is interrupted and leads to the formation of superoxide
  anion and then H2O2. Finally, H2O2 will act as signaling molecule to activate PKCε2
  which then inhibits the opening of mitochondrial permeable transition pore (mPTP).
  This inhibition of mPTP opening helps to protect mitochondrial damage during I/R
  injury. (Modified with permission from []).
