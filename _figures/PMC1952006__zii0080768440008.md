caption: Proposed models for nitrate regulation of motility, biofilm formation, and
  virulence in P. aeruginosa PAO1. (A) Nitrate sensor-response regulator function
  in motility and biofilm formation. (Top) In wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1, nitrate
  activates the autophosphorylation of the nitrate sensor NarX. Transfer of the phosphate
  to the receiver domain of the response regulator NarL results in either activation
  or repression of target operon transcription. Pathways leading to motility and biofilm
  development are operative. (Middle) In the double mutant ΔnarXL, loss of the nitrate
  sensor NarX results in an inability to activate NarL. Swimming and swarming are
  both diminished in ΔnarXL, suggesting impairment of flagellar synthesis and/or function.
  As a consequence, biofilm thickness and biomass are enhanced compared to the wild
  type, possibly due to a defect in organism dispersal from the biofilm. The membrane
  nitrate reductase operon narK1K2GHJI is not activated in the nitrate sensor-response
  regulator double mutant. However, derepression of the periplasmic nitrate reductase
  operon napEFDABC in ΔnarXL permits growth under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions
  (unpublished observations), allowing biofilm formation. (Bottom) In the response
  regulator mutant ΔnarL, the cognate sensor target is absent. Inability of NarX to
  activate NarL results in a significant increase in rhamnolipid production. As a
  consequence, ΔnarL displays a hyperswarming phenotype that likely diminishes its
  ability to form a biofilm. It is unknown whether an alternative sensor activates
  NarL to stimulate rhamnolipid production or whether phospho-NarL represses rhamnolipid
  production. Cross talk with other sensors or response regulators that modulate flagellar
  function may also explain why the individual ΔnarL and ΔnarX mutants swam normally
  while swimming of the double mutant ΔnarXL was impaired. Despite alterations in
  biofilm formation and swimming in the regulatory mutants, all were as virulent as
  wild-type PAO1 in C. elegans. (B) Nitrate dissimilation in motility, biofilm formation,
  and virulence. (Top) In wild-type PAO1, both membrane nitrate reductase and periplasmic
  nitrate reductase contribute to nitrite formation. We propose that further reduction
  of nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) provides a signal to stimulate rhamnolipid production,
  resulting in swarming and normal biofilm formation. It is unknown whether the regulation
  of rhamnolipid synthesis by NO is direct or indirect. (Bottom) This model is supported
  by the phenotypes of the nitrate dissimilation pathway mutants. The membrane nitrate
  reductase mutant ΔnarGH is defective in rhamnolipid production, swarming, and biofilm
  formation but not in swimming. Hence, it appears that NO is not involved in regulation
  of flagellar synthesis and/or function. While the periplasmic nitrate reductase
  mutant ΔnapA shows no phenotypic differences from wild-type PAO1, swarming is completely
  ablated in the double nitrate reductase mutant ΔnarGH:ΔnapA. Swarming was also ablated
  in the nitrite reductase mutant ΔnirS but not in the nitric oxide reductase mutant
  Tn::norC. For clarity, the latter two mutants are not indicated in the diagram.
  The absence of an adequate level of NO signaling results in avirulence of both ΔnarGH
  and ΔnirS in C. elegans.
