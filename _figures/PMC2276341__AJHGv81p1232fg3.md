caption: Network analysis of target genes. Interaction networks were generated using
  Ingenuity pathway analysis. The figure shows one example of an important functional
  pathway identified via this approach, which centers on Wnt/β-catenin and IGF-1 signaling
  pathways. Genes shaded in gray were identified as significantly (P<.05) enriched
  in ChIP-chip analyses; others were brought into the pathway on the basis of relationships
  within the Ingenuity knowledge database. Solid and dotted lines represent direct
  and indirect interactions, respectively. Node shapes represent the class of molecule—vertical
  diamonds represent enzymes, horizontal diamonds represent peptidases, ovals represent
  transcription factors, squares represent cytokines, triangles represent kinases,
  hexagons represent translation factors, and circles represent other classes. Further
  information can be found at the  Web site.
