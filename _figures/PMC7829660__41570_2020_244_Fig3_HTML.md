caption: a | General structure of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with its three main domains,
  lipid A, core oligosaccharide and O-antigen polysaccharide. b | Structure of natural
  lipid A from Escherichia coli. c,d | Structures of chemically modified monophosphoryl
  lipid A from Salmonella minnesota R595 (clinically approved, panel c) and from Neisseria
  meningitidis (panel d). e | Schematic representation of LPS/Toll-like receptor 4
  (TLR4) signalling pathway and lipid A mechanism of action. LPS-binding protein (LBP)-associated
  LPS (or lipid A) is first transferred to CD14 and then delivered to myeloid differentiation
  factor 2 (MD2), enabling formation of the LPS–MD2–TLR4 ternary complex, which drives
  dimerization of TLR4 receptors. LPS/TLR4 signalling involves intracellular recruitment
  of Toll/interlukin-1 (IL-1) receptor domain-containing adapter protein (TIRAP),
  TRIF-related adapter molecule (TRAM), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)
  and Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing interferon-β (TRIF) co-receptors.
  While the MyD88-dependent pathway promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine expression,
  the MyD88-independent pathway mediates the induction of type I interferons. Part
