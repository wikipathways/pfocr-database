caption: Working model of the role of vitamin C in Schwann cell myelination. Vitamin
  C is classically known to promote myelination by serving as a cofactor for P4 hydroxylase
  which stabilizes collagen during basal lamina formation and is necessary for myelination.
  Therefore, vitamin C is thought to indirectly promote myelination. Here, we present
  a novel epigenetic pathway whereby vitamin C promotes myelination via TET-mediated
  demethylation. Vitamin C induces demethylation in promoter and gene body regulatory
  regions of genes involved in Schwann cell myelination (Krox20, PRX, and MBP) and
  ECM organization (Laminin-2 subunits, Collagens I and IV). Demethylation correlates
  with increased transcription of these genes and promotes their relevant functions.
  Therefore, vitamin C may promote myelination 1) indirectly through P4 hydroxylase
  activity, and 2) directly via active demethylation and transcriptional regulation
  of genes relevant to myelination
