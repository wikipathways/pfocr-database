caption: Physiological function of the MacroH2A1.1_PARP1 axis. Stressing signals generated
  during DNA damage repair, senescence, hormonal response, heat shock, or differentiation
  promote the binding of macroH2A1.1 to activated PARP1 creating the macroH2A1.1-PARP1
  axis. On the one hand, when macroH2A1.1 is highly expressed, this interaction leads
  to the inhibition of PARP1 activity which reduces PARP1 consumption of nuclear NAD+.
  In this way, the macroH2A1.1-PARP1 axis influences mitochondrial activity through
  subcellular NAD pools turnover. On the other hand, macroH2A1.1 and active PARP1
  act in concert in order to regulate gene expression and as a consequence regulate
  stress signals response. Crosstalks between those both pathways implicating sirtuin
  and other PARP enzymes may additionally influence the physiological outcomes of
  the macroH2A1.1-PARP1 axis. The question marks illustrate the lack of knowledge
  regarding some steps in this axis pathway.
