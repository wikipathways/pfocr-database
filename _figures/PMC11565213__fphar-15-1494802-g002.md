caption: PIK3CA gene mutation activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway will resist
  the action of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody on EGFR signaling pathway, resulting
  in resistance to EGFR monoclonal antibody in colorectal cancer patients. Also causes
  resistance to BRAF inhibitors in BRAF V600E colorectal cancer. However, activation
  of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway may enhance the sensitivity of colorectal
  cancer to PI3K inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors, thereby inhibiting the tumor. Secondly,
  PIK3CA gene mutations not only upregulate the expression of PD-L1 by activating
  the PI3K signaling pathway, but also increase TMB to produce more neoantigens, which
  will increase the sensitivity of colorectal cancer to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
  Finally, PIK3CA gene mutation may promote tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell infiltration
  and metastasis by activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thus reducing the targeting
  and penetration of vaccine or cell therapy. It is also possible to alter the number
  and activity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by influencing the tumor microenvironment,
  thereby affecting the effectiveness and durability of vaccines or cell therapies
