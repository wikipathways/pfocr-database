caption: An illustration of spontaneous DNA double strand break induction and their
  roles in maintaining the stemness and tumorigenicity of cancer cells. Mitochondrial
  permeability changes in cancer cells allow spontaneous, sub-lethal activation of
  the apoptotic cascade that includes the cytoplasmic leakage of cytochrome c, caspase-3
  activation, CAD activation, and EndoG nuclear translocation. The presence of spontaneous
  DNA double strand breaks activates ATM, a key player in DNA damage repair pathway.
  Phosphorylated ATM activates NF-κB and Stat3, two factors well known to the maintenance
  of tumorigenicity and stemness of cancer cells. Adapted from ref. .
