caption: Loss of fumarate hydratase (FH) is associated with the familial form of type
  2 papillary RCC and results in the activation of several pathways. The loss of FH
  activity suppresses flow through the citric acid cycle in the normal direction and
  impairs the cell’s ability to use oxidative phosphorylation, forcing the cells to
  be dependent upon glucose and glycolysis for energy production. The loss of canonical
  tricarboxylic acid cycle function results in usage of the reductive carboxylation
  pathway and increased glutamine uptake for fatty acid synthesis and, in a similar
  manner to clear cell RCC, provides a series of potential targets for therapy (highlighted
  in red) involved in the conversion of glutamine to fatty acids.The highly increased
  levels of fumarate (Fum) result in inhibition of α-ketoglutarate depenedent enzymes
  such as the prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). In normoxia, the PHDs hydroxylate the HIF-α
  transcription factors to allow for VHL-dependent degradation. In fumarate hydratase
  deficient RCC the HIF1α accumulates and activates downstream targets. This results
  in increased levels of vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF), lactate dehydrogenase
  A (LDHA) and the glucose transporter, GLUT1, that support the high levels glycolysis
  required by this aggressive form of renal cell carcinoma. A therapeutic approach
  utilizing the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib is currently being evaluated.
  In addition, the elevated levels of fumarate result in succination of multiple proteins
  including the KEAP1 protein, which, as part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with
  CUL3, targets the NRF2 transcription factor for degradation. Succination of KEAP1
  inactivates KEAP1 and inhibits NRF2 degradation, resulting in activation of the
  NRF2 antioxidant response element (ARE) transcription pathway. While mutation of
  fumarate hydratase is rarely seen in sporadic type 2 papillary RCC, recent studies
  have reported activation of the NRF2 pathway in sporadic type 2 PRCC due to inactivating
  mutations of CUL3 or activating mutations of NRF2. An intense effort is underway
  to develop therapeutic agents that target the NRF2 ARE pathway.
