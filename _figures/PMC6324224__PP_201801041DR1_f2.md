caption: Indole compounds and putative enzymes involved in the synthesis of IAA in
  D. dichotoma using hypothesized biosynthetic pathways of higher plants (; ; ). d/D
  and e/E stand for putative homologous sequences in D. dichotoma and E. siliculosus,
  respectively. Capital letters stand for RBH, small letters for non-RBH. In brackets,
  relevant reaction codes of EctoGEM are mentioned (). Enzymes in gray-italic font
  were only checked in EctoGEM and not included in the RBH analysis because they are
  currently judged as lacking evidence (; ). Bold black line denotes pathway presently
  thought to be dominant in Arabidopsis. Dotted black lines denote hypothesized conversions,
  with unidentified enzymes. Gray lines denote the pathways which are judged as unlikely
  according to .
