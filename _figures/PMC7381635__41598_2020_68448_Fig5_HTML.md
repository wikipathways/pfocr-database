caption: Differentially abundant features codified by the fungus-growing insects’
  microbiota. Summary of abundant CAZy families and KEGG pathways that are more abundantly
  codified by the FGI microbiota when compared to other hosts (White test, Bonferroni
  corrected P < 0.05). Possible metabolic roles for these functions were speculated
  according to the literature (Supplementary Table ). Diverse studies suggest these
  functions participating in plant biomass metabolism, biofilm formation, fungal biomass
  metabolism, general nutrition, and antimicrobials biosynthesis. Abundance and statistic
  comparisons of each CAZy family and KEGG pathway may be found at Fig. , and Supplementary
  Figs. . Ant gardens, termite combs, and beetle galleries depicted at the center
  exhibit characteristic structures deriving from the metabolism of plant biomass.
