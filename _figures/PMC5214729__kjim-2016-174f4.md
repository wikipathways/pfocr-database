caption: Proposed renoprotective mechanisms in diabetic nephropathy (DN) through adenosine
  monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. The AMPK signaling pathway
  responds to energy stresses that cause fluctuations and imbalances in the adenosine
  monophosphate/adenosine triphosphate (AMP/ATP) (or adenosine diphosphate [ADP]/ATP)
  ratio. As the ATP level falls, there is an increase in the AMP level, which triggers
  the activation of the AMPK pathway. The upstream regulator of AMPK, liver kinase
  B-1 (LKB1), allows for AMP phosphorylation at a specific site on the α subunit of
  AMPK. Two other subunits, STE-related adaptor (STRAD) and mouse protein 25 (MO25),
  form a complex with LKB1 to enhance this process. Ca++/calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ), which is induced by an increase in intracellular Ca++,
  is also able to activate AMPK. AMPK activation then stimulates its downstream signaling
  pathways which are involved in oxidative stress, mitochondrial biogenesis, glycolytic
  flux and lipogenesis that modulate cell growth and metabolism. AMPK also activates
  sirtuins (SIRTs), especially Sirt-1, which exerts renoprotective effects via improving
  cellular metabolism. This consequently exerts favorable renoprotective effects by
  reducing apoptosis, inflammation, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis,
  and albuminuria in type 2 DN. Adapted from Kim et al. []. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
  FoxO3, Forkhead box O3; HMGCR, 3-hydroxy-3-metylglutaryl-CoA reductase; mTOR, mammalian
