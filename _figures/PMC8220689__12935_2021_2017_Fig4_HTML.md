caption: CircRNAs in JNK pathway. Dysregulation of JNK Pathway is involved in the
  cancer development. There are 4 circRNAs (circ-102004, CircMAN2B2/miR‐145, CircUBAP2,
  and circLPAR3/miR-198) that have significantly increased expression and 1 circRNA
  (circ-ZKSCAN/miR-330-5p) that has decreased expression. Some of them regulate this
  pathway through miRNA sponging
