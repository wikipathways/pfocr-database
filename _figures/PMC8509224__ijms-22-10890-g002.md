caption: Major factors affecting adipose-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (ASC)
  differentiation into endothelial cells (ECs). Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2)
  activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, leading
  to the phosphorylation of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), which decreases its transcriptional
  activity. As a result, the levels of miR-145 decrease and the levels of its downstream
  target V-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS1) increase,
  which upregulate the transcription of EC-related genes. VEGF, on the other hand,
  activates ERK signaling pathway via VEGFR2 activation, leading to upregulation of
  EC genes, while MMP2 and -14 induce VEGFR2 cleavage and decrease in downstream signaling.
  Additionally, environmental factors such as shear force, hypoxia, EC priming of
  ASCs and 3D culture conditions enhance endothelial differentiation of ASCs.
