caption: Outline of the experiment. (A) HisA catalyzes the fourth step in the l-histidine
  biosynthesis pathway, the conversion of ProFAR to PRFAR. In minimal medium, deletion
  of hisA is lethal and mutations in hisA affect the growth rate. (B) Experimental
  system of this study. Error-prone PCR (EP-PCR) was used to introduce random mutations
  into the hisA gene of Salmonella enterica. The gene was introduced into the chromosome
  with λ red recombineering by counter selecting sacB. The fitness of each mutant
  was measured by relative exponential growth rate in M9 minimal medium. The relative
  fitness (s) per generation was calculated (0 for neutral, positive for beneficial,
  and negative for deleterious mutations). (C) Mutated genes with only one mutation
  were placed under control of the l-arabinose inducible promoter ParaBAD and exponential
  growth rate was measured under growth limiting concentrations of l-arabinose.
