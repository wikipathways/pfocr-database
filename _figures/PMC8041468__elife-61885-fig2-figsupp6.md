caption: (A) Network illustrates the regulatory relationship between TFs and their
  target genes in motility pathway. Circles indicate TF proteins, and squares indicate
  target genes. Red arrows show the binding sites located in the putative promoters
  of the target genes, establishing the regulatory relationship. Black arrows indicate
  that we did electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) validation, demonstrated
  in panel B. To save space, ‘PA’ is removed in the names of all TFs and their target
  genes. (B) EMSA validation (head-to-head) for predicted binding of PA3594 to the
  promoter of flgB. By contrast, the promoter fragment of katB is used as the negative
  control for P PA3594. Note that the up-shift bands of DNA in gel were observed in
  the experiment. The fragments of negative control DNA showed no binding to PA3594.
  The TF motif of PA3594 is shown in the upper panel of EMSA. Arrows indicate half-sites
  in dimeric binding.
