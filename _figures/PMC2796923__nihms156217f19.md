caption: a) Biosynthetically, UDP-α-d-glucose (3) is derived either from glycolytic
  intermediate 12, or from β-d-galactose (101) via the Leloir pathway (see text for
  details). The pentose moieties of calicheamicin (104) and avilamycin (107) are likely
  derived from a UDP-α-d-glucose (3) precursor. A separate group of UDP-sugars are
  derived from the glycolytic intermediate fructose-6-phosphate (13) via UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine
  (5, see text for details). Compound 5 is likely the biosynthetic precursor of many
  aminoglycoside sugars, many of which are 2-aminosugars (see ).
