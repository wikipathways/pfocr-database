caption: Proposed mechanism between mTOR Signaling Pathway, Inhibitors and Photodynamic
  Therapy (PDT). PDT down-regulates AKT-mTOR pathway because of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production. 1. Photosensitizer is injected into a targeted tumor. 2. Laser
  light is emitted at a particular wavelength. 3. Cells become activated and release
  reactive oxygen species, which results to tissue destruction and cell death. Interaction
  with inhibitors phosphoinositide 3-kinase (I1), rapamycin (I2) and mTOR kinase (I3)
  to enhance cell death through the P13K/AKT-mTOR pathway.
