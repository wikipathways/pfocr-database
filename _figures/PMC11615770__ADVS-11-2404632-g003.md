caption: Quantitative heterologous pathway design algorithm (QHEPath) and the synthesis
  pathway of spermidine. a) Schematic for the algorithm QHEPath. b) The yield of the
  native spermidine synthesis pathway P0 and multiple pathways P1–P4 with higher yields
  than P0 were obtained by the introduction of heterologous reactions using E. coli
  as the chassis. c) The native biosynthetic pathway P0 of spermidine and pathway
  P2 with a higher yield achieved by the introduction of two heterologous reactions.
  Black arrows represent native reactions and red arrows represent heterologous reactions.
  The numbers on the pathway diagram represent reaction flux. pyr, pyruvate; accoa,
  acetyl‐CoA; oaa, oxaloacetate; akg, 2‐oxoglutarate; glu, L‐glutamate; acglu, N‐acetyl‐L‐glutamate;
