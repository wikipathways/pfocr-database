caption: Peroxisomal reactions involving the cofactor NADPH. According to this study,
  NADP-IDH and two enzymes of the OPPP, namely 6-PGL and 6PGDH, are targeted to plant
  peroxisomes with high probability (see Supplemental Fig. 4, C–E) and can provide
  NADPH for reductive matrix enzymes. Two NADPH-dependent reductases of plant peroxisomes
  carry a PTS1, i.e. OPR3 of JA biosynthesis, which converts OPDA to 3-oxo-2-(cis-2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic
  acid (OPC:8:0) and DECR of the NADP-dependent degradation pathway of unsaturated
  fatty acids (see ). Oxidation of NADPH in the course of the ascorbate-glutathione
  cycle has also been reported ().
