caption: On detecting cytosolic DNA, cGAS synthesises the second messenger cGAMP which
  can be exported to adjacent cells or the extracellular environment using gap junctions
  and exporters. Within the cell, cGAMP can go on to bind STING anchored to the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). STING is subject to numerous posttranslational modifications, then
  transported from the ER to the Golgi where it forms a complex with TBK1 and is phosphorylated
  by TBK1 at Serine 366. This serves to recruit the transcription factor IRF3 to the
  complex, which is also phosphorylated by TBK1. IRF3 and NF-κB p65 then promote the
  production of IFN-Is and chemokines including CXCL10 and CCL5. An alternative non-canonical
  STING signalling pathway has been identified in human epithelial cells. This pathway
  does not require the activity of cGAS, but the DNA damage sensing proteins PARP-1
  and ATM, as well as the DNA binding protein IFI16 which shuttles between the nucleus
  and cytosol. cGAS-independent DNA damage sensing favours the activation of NF-κB
  over IRF3, generating a more pro-inflammatory cytokine profile that is distinct
  from canonical STING signalling. In cancer cells, canonical STING activation can
  be re-wired to induce the activation of NF-κB p52, which also induces a pro-inflammatory
  cytokine profile that may aid tumour progression.
