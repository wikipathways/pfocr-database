caption: Summary diagram of the PI3K pathway and cellular activation pathways. PI3K
  is divided into three classes, of which class I can be subdivided into classes IA
  and IB. Class IA features tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs), and class IB is associated
  with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). When the corresponding receptor is activated
  by a growth factor (L) or a chemokine (C), PI3K is recruited to the plasma membrane
  and is activated, leading to the phosphorylation of PIP2 to produce PIP3. PIP3 recruits
  and binds AKT and proteins with pleckstrin homology (PH) structural domains such
  as PDK1. Subsequently, AKT is phosphorylated and activated by PDK1 and the mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), triggering several phosphorylation-based
  signaling cascades. In addition, PTEN negatively regulates the activation of PIP3
  by 3’-phosphatase activity, which converts PIP3 to PIP2, thereby stopping the phosphorylation
  cascade
