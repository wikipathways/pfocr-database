caption: Impact of 14 days of circadian disruption on mammary gland transcriptome
  signatures of late gestation dry dairy cows. Functional annotation and pathway analysis
  of the 862 genes differentially expressed in mammary tissue between control (CON,
  n = 6) and phase-shifted (PS, n = 6) treated cows at P < 0.05 found that genes downregulated
  (green) by circadian rhythm disruption enriched categories related to oxidative
  phosphorylation, fatty acid transport and metabolism, remodeling and deposition
  of the extracellular matrix (ECM), immune response, and associated with the lysosome.
  Also, downregulated in PS cows were the β-adrenergic receptors, ADRB2 and ADRB3.
  Whereas genes that were upregulated (red) in PS cattle enriched RNA processing,
  markers of differentiation, and cell cycle.
