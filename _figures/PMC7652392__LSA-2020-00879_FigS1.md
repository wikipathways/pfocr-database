caption: The FASII pathway is localized to the apicoplast (green), whereby ketoacyl-acyl
  carrier protein is synthesized by condensation from CoA-activated precursors. The
  molecule is sequentially reduced, dehydrated and reduced to produce a fatty acyl
  chain. This cyclical process generates free fatty acids (FAs) as the final products.
  The FA elongation (ELO) pathway proceeds on the cytoplasmic face of the ER and catalyzes
  condensation a malonyl-CoA molecule with a fatty acyl-CoA derived from the FASII
  pathway. The products of ELO-A, ELO-B, and ELO-C are then cyclically reduced, dehydrated,
  and reduced by ketoacyl-CoA reductase (KCR), hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase (DEH),
  and enoyl-CoA reductase (ECR) to finally produce free FAs with two additional carbons
  with each cycle.
