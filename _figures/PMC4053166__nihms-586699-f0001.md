caption: Inactive IRF-3 remains in a closed conformation in the cytoplasm. Microbial
  infection-induced signaling pathways activate IRF-3 by phosphorylation of its specific
  Ser/Thr residues by TBK1, causing conformational changes, dimerization and nuclear
  translocation of IRF-3. In the nucleus, IRF-3 binds to ISRE of target genes, recruits
  the essential co-activators and induces gene transcription. Phosphorylated nuclear
  IRF-3 is exported to the cytoplasm and is recruited to a Ser/Thr phosphatase, PP2A
  by the adaptor protein, RACK1. PP2A dephosphorylates IRF-3 and terminates its transcriptional
  activity; dephosphorylation of IRF-3 also prevents it from being degraded by the
  proteasomal machinery. In another pathway, IRF-3 is activated by phosphorylation
  of different Ser residues by TBK1, interacts with BAX, translocates to mitochondria
  and triggers cellular apoptosis.
