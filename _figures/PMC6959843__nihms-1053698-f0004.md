caption: The sugars most commonly consumed are the monosaccharides glucose and fructose
  and the disaccharides sucrose, maltose, and lactose. Glycogen and starch are polysaccharides
  composed of the glucose disaccharide, maltose. The difference between glycogen and
  starch is that glycogen is more highly branched. A) Following ingestion of these
  sugars, they move down the esophagus into the stomach where there is minimal digestion.
  In the small intestine is where the majority of digestion is completed. Enzymes
  maltase, sucrose, and lactase all convert their respective disaccharides to their
  monosaccharide precursors. These sugars are then transported via channels to epithelial
  cells of the small intestine and ultimately to blood vessels. B) Fructose and glucose
  leave blood vessels and enter hepatic or non-hepatic tissue dependent on the affinities
  of those cells for the monosaccharides. Fructose almost exclusively moves into hepatic
  tissue due to fructokinase’s high affinity (low Km) for the sugar. In hepatic tissue
  fructokinase is converted to glyceraldehyde and subsequently glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  both of which are involved in the process of glycolysis. C) The key steps in triglyceride
  synthesis shown in the pathway are the production of Acetyl CoA in the mitochondria
  which ultimately leads to the creation of fatty acids through a process of reduction,
  addition of the production of glycerol which serves as the backbone of triacylglycerides,
  and the production of TAGs via condensation reactions between glycerol and fatty
  acids.
