caption: The role of RTKs and ERα36 in the development of tamoxifen resistance. EGFR
  induces tamoxifen resistance by enhancing the glycolytic pathway. The increase in
  EGF signal transduction induces a decrease in P53 expression, which leads to the
  inhibition of cell proliferation. TAMs secrete CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), which
  activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. NF-κB promotes the secretion of CCL2. ERα36
  contributes to the upregulation of EGFR, which increases ERK phosphorylation. The
  decrease in IGF-1R expression leads to the inhibition of FoxO1 expression, which
  results in the development of tamoxifen resistance. IGF1R mediates the expression
  of PAK2 and leads to drug resistance.
