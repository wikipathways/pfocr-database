caption: Investigated strategies targeting the FGF23-αKlotho-axis to ameliorate uremic
  cardiomyopathy. Dietary phosphate restriction causes a reduction in circulating
  levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, while the use of phosphate binders
  or nicotinamide do not. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving calcimimetics
  show lower circulating FGF23 levels associated with reduced cardiovascular death
  and heart failure. Calcitriol therapy in 5/6 nephrectomized rats causes less activation
  of the FGF23/FGF receptor (FGFR) 4/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells
  (NFAT) signaling pathway and improved left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However,
  treatment with active vitamin D shows no improvement of cardiac phenotype. The use
  of FGF23 neutralizing antibodies in uremic rats leads to decreased parathyroid hormone
  (PTH) levels and increased vitamin D, but causes aortic calcification and enhanced
  mortality. In contrast, targeting FGFR4 using anti-FGFR4 neutralizing antibodies
  attenuated LVH in vivo and inhibits FGF23-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in
  vitro. Treatment with recombinant αKlotho reduces uremic cardiac remodeling without
  affecting high FGF23 levels (This figure is created with BioRender.com).
