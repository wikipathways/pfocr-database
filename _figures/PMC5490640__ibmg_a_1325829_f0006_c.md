caption: Ubiquitin chains and ubiquitin enzymes in the TNF-induced NF-κB and apoptosis
  pathways. Different linkage types of ubiquitin chains, Met 1-, Lys 11-, Lys 48-,
  and Lys 63-linked ubiquitin chains play a critical role in the TNF-induced canonical
  NF-κB and the TNFR complex II-dependent apoptosis pathways. Ubiquitin chains are
  generated by the E3 ligases, cIAP, LUBAC complex, and SCF-βTrCP. These ubiquitin
  chains are hydrolyzed by two DUBs, OTULIN and CYLD. A20 is a hybrid of E3 ligase
  and DUB. Ubiquitination of the substrates, including cIAPs, RIPK1, NEMO, and IκB-α,
  impacts on the downstream signaling pathways. The TNFR complex II-mediated apoptosis
  pathway includes RIPK1, TRADD, FADD, and Caspase 8. Activation of Caspase 8 leads
  to Caspase 3-dependent cleavage of PARP and apoptosis. The LUBAC complex (HOIP,
  SHARPIN, and HOIL-1L) and the CYLD–SPATA2 complex regulate the TNFR complex II-induced
  apoptosis pathway. E3 ligases are indicated in red, DUBs in purple, and transcription
  factors in green (see color version of this figure at www.tandfonline.com/ibmg).
