caption: The co-localization of CHMP4B and ALIX is an essential regulatory event in
  the autophagic degradation of micronuclei. CHMP4 proteins are essential components
  of the MVB pathway where they interact with ESCRT-III to recruit the ALG-2 interacting
  protein (ALIX). CHMP4B shows the greatest binding affinity towards ALIX. CHMP4B
  plays an essential role in the recycling of micronuclei (MN), which is dependent
  upon its recruitment and interaction with ALIX at the endosome. CHMP4B localizes
  to micronuclei in the lens of the eye to facilitate autophagic degradation and prevent
  cataract formation. The D129V mutation in CHMP4B is linked to cataract formation
  likely as a result of a blocked interaction between CHMP4B and ALIX, which leads
  to decreased autophagic degradation of MVB cargo and accumulation of micronuclei.
