caption: 'Activities of S genes targeted by TAL effectors.Our in-depth understanding
  of the molecular mechanisms underlying TAL effectors (TALe) action revolutionized
  the quest for their targets in planta. Because TALes act as bona fide eukaryotic
  transcription factors which DNA-binding sites are highly predictable, transcriptomic
  approaches combined to in silico target promoter search allows for rapid identification
  of their target gene candidates. To such an extent that nearly 10 classes of S genes
  have been discovered since the elucidation of the TAL code in 2009 [,]. Their function
  is quite diverse, ranging from sucrose (SWEET) and sulfate transporters, enzymes
  involved in the biosynthesis pathway of various compounds such as polyamines (arginine
  decarboxylases), ABA (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase) or even small RNAs (the
  methyltransferase Hen1), to different types of transcription factors (LOB, bHLH,
  bZIP, ERF) involved in the control of various phenotypes such as host cell enlargement,
  pustule formation, watersoaking, and so on…It is expected that other categories
  of S genes will be discovered as novel TAL effectors with major or even moderate
  virulence functions are characterized. The potential is high because the majority
  of Xanthomonas species rely on TALes to infect their host and only the S genes corresponding
  to 7 pathosystems have been investigated today when there are at least fifty species
  or pathovars of Xanthomonas with unique features that remain to be investigated.

  TALes and for which a function is described. Text in brown refers to the types of
  activities conferred by S genes. Primary and secondary targets are shown in purple
  and green (text, shape), respectively. Abbreviations: SWEET, Sugars Will Eventually

  dioxygenase. Forms: cylinder, nutrient transporter; hexagon, biosynthetic pathway
  enzyme; two-ovoid, transcription factor; Pacman-like, cell wall-modifying proteins.'
