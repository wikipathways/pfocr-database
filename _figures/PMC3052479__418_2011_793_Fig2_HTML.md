caption: 'A model for the hydroxyurea-induced checkpoint signaling and modulation
  by caffeine, 2-aminopurine, staurosporine and sodium metavanadate. The mechanisms
  connected with the S-phase checkpoints are set in motion under the conditions of
  replication stress [under the influence of hydroxyurea (HU), an inhibitor of ribonucleotide
  reductase (RNR)], which results in the phosphorylation of Chk1 kinase by superior
  kinases: ATM and ATR. The activated Chk1 can inactivate Cdc25C phosphatase by phosphorylation
  on Ser216, which results in the inhibition of Cdc2 activation and G2/M passages
  (orange pathway). Caffeine (CF), 2-aminopurine (2-AP), staurosporine (ST) and sodium
  metavanadate (Van) induce the premature condensation of chromosomes (PCC), most
  probably by omitting the mechanism that blocks Cdc25 phosphatase and Cdk1/cyclin
  B complex (red and blue pathways)'
papertitle: Premature chromosome condensation induced by caffeine, 2-aminopurine,
  staurosporine and sodium metavanadate in S-phase arrested HeLa cells is associated
  with a decrease in Chk1 phosphorylation, formation of phospho-H2AX and minor cytoskeletal
  rearrangements.
