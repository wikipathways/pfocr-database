caption: 'Metabolism is a key feature of every quiescent cell. Quiescent cells generate
  ATP by glycolysis and OXPHOS. Metabolism can be weighted toward anabolic reactions
  or toward catabolic reactions. Glucose is one of the main nutrients from which all
  types of cells generate energy. Glycolysis converts glucose into pyruvate via sequential
  enzymatic reactions, which lead to the generation of intermediate metabolites that
  can enter other pathways, such as the PPP. These coordinated metabolic processes
  are critical for successful biosynthesis and cell growth. Pyruvate generated from
  glycolysis can enter the mictochondria and can be converted into acetyl-CoA entering
  the TCA cycle or can be converted into lactate in the cytoplasm and excreted from
  the cell. Glycolysis also helps in the maintenance of the NAD+–NADH redox balance.
  Cells also use glutamine (Gln), which is metabolized by glutaminolysis, and lipids
  (TG, FA, and glycerol), which are metabolized by fatty acid oxidation. The intermediates
  produced by these catabolic processes enter the TCA cycle. The TCA cycle provides
  key substrates for biosynthesis, such as citrate, which can be exported to the cytosol
  and form the basis for FAS, whereas OXPHOS generates a high number of ATP thereby
  providing the high levels of energy required for cell growth. Abbreviations: α-KG,
