caption: Production of reactive oxygen species by the Duox pathway. In basal conditions,
  dietary yeasts or small amount of uracil from commensal bacteria activate the G
  protein alpha subunit q (Gαq) and phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), thereby inducing the
  synthesis of inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3), which binds to IP3 receptor in
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Calcium ions are then released from ER into the
  cytosol, resulting in the activation of a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing
  enzyme Dual oxidase (Duox). Duox expression is strongly induced by the large amount
  of uracil produced by pathogenic bacteria. PLCβ mediates this Duox upregulation
  through triggering the MEKK1/MEK3/p38 MAPK pathway and activating Activating Transcription
  Factor2 (ATF2).
