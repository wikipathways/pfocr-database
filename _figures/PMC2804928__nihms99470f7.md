caption: '(A) Low cognitive demands in working memory: Activation of the pathway from
  area 46 to area 9 predominantly engages CR neurons (via 46-cr), which disinhibit
  pyramidal neurons. This pathway is consistent with disinhibiting activity in area
  9 and enhancing relevant signals (large green triangle). Innervation of CB neurons
  is low, but a few may be activated (via 46-cb); this pathway is consistent with
  suppressing moderate noise (small green triangle).(B) High cognitive demand: The
  pathways from area 46 and ACC (area 32) may act in synergy. When noise increases
  during high cognitive demands, suppression engaged by the area 46 pathway may not
  be enough. ACC may be recruited to suppress excessive noise by strongly activating
  CB neurons through efficient large boutons (via 32-cb). ACC may also engage CR neurons
  to further disinhibit the relevant signal drowned out by excessive noise (via 32-cr).(C)
  High cognitive demand: Large ACC boutons may overpower the effects of small area
  46 boutons to reverse decisions. CB inhibitory neurons activated by large boutons
  from ACC (32-cb) may overpower CR disinhibitory neurons engaged by small boutons
  from area 46 (46-cr) to suppress a previous signal (green, old signal). CR disinhibitory
  neurons may be recruited by large boutons from ACC (32-cr), overpowering CB neurons
  engaged by area 46 (46-cb) to enhance a new signal. In addition, the two pathways
  may recruit PV inhibitory neurons (46-pv and 32-pv), potentially shifting the temporal
  dynamics to reverse the response, with the large boutons from ACC acting as drivers
  (32-pv).'
