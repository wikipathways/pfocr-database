caption: N-Glycan processing and N-glycan-mediated quality control in the ER of plants.
  The OST complex transfers the assembled N-glycan precursor to accessible Asn residues
  within the glycosylation consensus sites of nascent polypeptides. The first N-glycan
  processing step is carried out by α-glucosidase I (GCSI). Upon trimming of another
  terminal Glc residue by GCSII, the protein with a mono-glucosylated N-glycan may
  enter the calnexin (CNX)/calreticulin cycle. Proper folded glycoproteins are released
  from the quality control process and can exit the ER. Aberrant glycoproteins that
  cannot attain their final conformation are sent for degradation by the ERAD pathway
  which requires MNS4/MNS5-mediated Man trimming and recognition by OS9. The class
  I α-mannosidase MNS3 hydrolyses a single α1,2-Man residue from the middle branch
  (B-branch see also Figure A) of the oligomannosidic N-glycan. MNS3 may act on folded
  as well as on partially folded glycoproteins. The subcellular site of MNS3 action
  is still obscure. While MNS3 has so far been exclusively found in Golgi-like structures
  (), ER-resident glycoproteins display N-glycans that have been trimmed by the MNS3-like
  ER-α-mannosidase activity. This figure is available in black and white in print
  and in color at Glycobiology online.

  description: N-Glycan processing and N-glycan-mediated quality control in the ER
    of plants. The OST complex transfers the assembled N-glycan precursor to accessible
