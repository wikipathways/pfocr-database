caption: Sugar nucleotide biosynthetic pathways identified in the genome of P. falciparum.
  The numbers refer to the enzymes and known or candidate genes described in . Predicted
  known fates of sugar nucleotide donors according to the glycoconjugates described
  in P. falciparum are in italic type (or marked with a question mark if the fate
  is unknown). Sugar nucleotides identified in this study are boxed. Dotted lines
  indicate confirmed salvage pathways, and sugars, taken up from the medium, are underlined.
  The discontinuous arrow (step 4) represents the glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase
  activity (EC 2.3.1.4) for which a candidate gene is not yet identified. HK, hexokinase;
  G6PI, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; GFPT, glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase;
  GNA, glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase; PAGM, phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase;
  UAP, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase; MPI, mannose-1-phosphate isomerase;
  PMM, phosphomannomutase; MPG, mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase; GMD, GDP-mannose
  4,6-dehydratase; FS, GDP-l-fucose synthase; PGM, phosphoglucomutase; UGP, UTP-glucose-1-phosphate
  uridylyltransferase; GALE, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase; GK, galactokinase. The suggested
  pathway for the biosynthesis of UDP-Gal through the activity of the UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase
  enzyme is indicated with a gray discontinuous arrow (see “Discussion”).
